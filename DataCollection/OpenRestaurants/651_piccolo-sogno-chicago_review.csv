We sent an appetizer back to the kitchen due to how terrible it was, and still got charged for it. Two of our main courses were fine, but the other was clearly waiting on the heat lamp for over half an hour. The seafood was lukewarm, burned, and over seasoned. Overall, definitely not worth the price.",0.3614,0.816,0.095,0.089,0.3736111111111111

2017-08-09,5.0,"I thought that I had definitely had rated Piccolo but guess this is my first review. After dining 3-4 times on Piccolo's ever popular outdoor patio, I am obviously a fan! Located at the intersection of Grand/Halsted/Milwaukee Piccolo pops out on the corner of this intersection and welcomes you into its Italian eatery. There is always a wait for the outdoor patio in the summertime because well it is a getaway within the city! Walking into Piccolo you would never expect such a city getaway, but you feel like you are traveling through Tuscany surrounded by trees and the city's  blue sky. It is truly a joy and even if you are not a big fan of Italian food, I recommend waiting 20-30 minutes and enjoying drinks or appetizers on this patio. Even though you are sitting very close to the other diners, it is an experience seeing how busy the restaurant is and the flow of dishes and drinks that they so easily deliver. Now let's get to the important part of this review the food and service. I mentioned the service in my previous paragraph, it is impeccable! The Italian Eats, well starting with the bread basket are all very good! I've enjoyed the salads, the Frito Misto (grilled seafood topped with arugula) and even Pizza for appetizers. A lot of people start with the Pizza for an appetizer because it is light and gets the meal started perfectly. I have enjoyed all the pasta dishes too: black ink spaghetti, Papardelle Boar ragú and last night I ordered the orchietti. The only thing I questioned from my pasta last night is that it was served with a white wine sauce. I asked for their Marinara which was provided instantly, however, it was more of a Vodka sauce.. the Halibut last night was definitely a great dish too.  See you next summer, Piccolo!",0.9976,0.777,0.218,0.005,0.42823809523809514
2017-08-06,3.0,"My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner. The patio seating is AMAZING! One of the best outdoor seating options out there! Of course, we got seated at probably the worst table outside, but I don't hold that against them...someone's gotta get the crappy table, right?  I wish the food was just as good as the ambience. But unfortunately that was not my experience. You can tell everything is thoughtfully made and made with care, but I just didn't think the flavors came through at all. I wasn't a big fan of the calamari starter, although perhaps I'm the odd one out because it looked like every table was ordering them. I had one of the pasta dishes (I added shrimp to it as well). The pasta sauce was just ok. But I loved the different textures and thought the shrimp were well cooked. My husband had the short rib with polenta. I tried the polenta and just didn't like it at all. He liked the short rib (I can't comment because I'm vegetarian). We ended our meal with ricotta cheesecake which was good. They had a really large wine selection, so if that's your thing, you might like the place! I had a nice time with my husband, but I don't think we would come back. I wasn't impressed by the food.

Nothing here is nowhere near traditional. Pasta and some red sauce. You will not find it here. Not regular marinara or meat sauce any way. As far as I am concerned they are trying to be way too creative. It is also pricey for the portions. Had the oricchette pasta special. Was supposed to be and sold as garlic, oil, sausage and a touch of crushed pepper. It was water, oil, and not a hint of garlic or pepper. The sausage was crumbles white pork fat. I mean it was white fat. I tried it. Did not eat a thing. The person I was with hated the dried out fish with no taste also. The other persons pizza was just all right.

They brought out the salads and at the same time dumped the appetizers on our table. When I mentioned it, he could have taken the salads back, brought plates for the appetizers. Instead, he just looked at me and walked away. So we ate our salads, had cold appetizers on plates that had salad dressing on them and no offer to refill bread. Our dinners were no better.

Alberto said, ""I'll bring you four instead of three so you can all have one."" The antipasti was good, but not particularly interesting, but the squash blossoms were superb. For Primi my wife and I split the Stracci Di Farro - pasta triangles with muschroom, asparagus and black truffles, and our dining partners had a appetizer-sized order of Ravioli.

As first time guests, we asked the server to go over the menu and some of his favorites. He read it in Italian, not the least bit helpful considering none of us speak Italian.

Off the bat, this has been on our ""must go"" list for a few years. Our friends and us were all really excited to finally visit this place.  Everything was great. The place looks nice, it is dimly lit, and there was great ambiance. Our waiter was this authentic Italian grandpa who made a few jokes and snubbed us a few times when he was busy with other tables and we were unsure of what to order and had questions. No problem... part of the charm.  The appetizers were great (calamari and a pizza) and we were pretty hungry so we really enjoyed them. The entrees were also very good, though the portions were quite different if you ordered a pasta dish (on the smaller side) or an entree dish (1/2 a duck or a whole Cornish hen). The desserts were delicious, especially the 1000 layer cake. When we got our bill, that's when the rating stars started dropping. Apparently this place charges for every soft drink refill. No, they are not using the fancy glass bottles like the other ""old school"" racket places, no no the Diet Cola here comes in a glass with ice.  It is not about the $2.50(!) per glass that they charged, it is about the principle. Why not TELL us ""hey folks, just so you know we did not offer free refills on soft drinks"". That would have eliminated some of our frustration and probably added a rating star back.  I took one star off for nickel-and-diming us with their archaic practice of charging for refills, and another star off for soiling their own reputation and in small part negatively affecting our otherwise great night!  Shame on you!

The birds are signing your favorite top 50 love song and everyone is laughing and smiling like they are at a People magazine shoot. This is the feeling I had while sitting outside on the beautiful patio at Piccolo Sogno. The sun was the perfect temperature and the patio resembled a rustic Italian restaurant in the heart of Italy.  To start, the service was perfect. Both knowledgeable and perfectly attentive, our waiter could not have presented himself better. He was instrumental in picking out the amazing rose that my lips had the pleasure of greeting. It was as light and crisp as the wind running through my hair.  For our appetizer, we shared the prosciutto pizza. How can you go wrong with carbs and prosciutto? Well I'm here to tell you that you cant. If I wasn't sitting with my boss, I would have downed the entire pizza myself as an appetizer. The prosciutto laid crisply and thinly over the impeccable pool of homemade sauce and crust. To start, I had the caprese salad. The mozzarella was creamy while the tomatoes almost tasted as if they were sun dried out of the patio that morning.  Fresh doesn't begin to describe what was occurring on that plate of deliciousness. If you happened to find yourself at the table across the way, you may have seen me questioning whether I should lick the plate or not. (apologies if you actually did witness that) When my last bite left the plate and enter the euphoric state that was occurring in my mouth, you may have even witnessed a small tear going down my face. It was beautiful. I almost feel like a better person because I experienced it that salad.  For my entrée, I let the waiter choose. With so many great options, I was overwhelmed and too afraid to not pick the best option. He selected one of the specials for the day, the mushroom risotto. With each bite, I contemplated more and more going up and hugging my waiter. WOW what a great selection he had. The risotto was thick and the mushroom flavoring was divine. I studied abroad in college in Italy and this meal knocked me straight back to that time. Finally the dessert. At this point I had fallen in love with piccolo and my waiter and didn't think it was possible for this fourth course to top the rest, but of course it did. The pana cotta was light and the perfect way to end a perfect meal with coworkers. I truly don't have enough good things to say about this place and I am already counting down the days until my next reservation.

The server seemed to not care that this group was being horrendously rude. The table was cramped and the service felt overly utilitarian. The pasta dishes were both good, but the portions were small and the quality was not immediately discernible as it should be for a restaurant of such an allegedly high caliber. The mozzarella and pepperoni appetizer was boring and lacked flare. Admittedly, the cheese was of high quality.  The drinks were above average.  On the whole, I am just missing the ""wow"" factor here.

2017-04-17,1.0,"Extremely disappointing meal on Saturday.   Ordered the squash blossoms, burrata, ribeye, pasta special and bustine.  All dishes were average to below average.  Squash blossoms came 3 to an order for $12 - absurd pricing for a truly minuscule and sadly bland appetizer.  The burrata was a golf-ball sized portion of burrata filling (apparently giving us the ""shell"" would have been too big a portion) for $16. The ribeye steak was poorly cooked - no char, which caused it to have zero Maillard reaction and thus is just a rubbery ribeye.  They need to make their grill hotter before grilling steak.  The bustine was fine.  The pasta with crab special was awful - basically a fist sized portion of plain linguine with some small chunks of crab.   The waitstaff started off fine but then disappeared for meaningful stretches.  Best part of the meal were the drinks - the bartender gives you a huge pour when you order our liquor.  Think four fingers of scotch for a single drink - completely at odds with the food.  I would drink at this bar any day of the week.   I would caution people against thinking this is ""good"" Italian food because everyone is running around speaking Italian and the menu has words and dishes you don't recognize.  The flavors are mundane, the prices absurd for the quality / portion size.  This is highly unfortunate - Piccolo Sogno used to be a good restaurant.",0.9014,0.839,0.105,0.056,0.5171957671957671

This dish was full of wonderful flavors.  I had the griglia mista and the prosciutto di parma.  The griglia mista was perfectly grilled calamari, shrimp and octopus served with arugula.  The smoky grilled flavor was brightened by the lemon and caper olive oil. It was delicious! The prosciutto was presented with a flower made up of cantaloupe melon. I liked the taste of salty meat with the sweetness of the melon.  There was confusion of when the branzino was to be served as we requested the gnocchi to be served as a second course, but they brought the fish out first.  So the gentleman took it back and we were served the gnocchi as requested.  I recommend making reservations for this restaurant as on a Wednesday evening it was full.

I also felt that it was a generous portion. My friends had the spaghetti neri and a special ravioli dish with truffle. They all really enjoyed their meals as well.

Otherwise, the waiter will gladly bring one for you within your preference and price range. Bottles ran as low as $40 and all the way up!  The food. This is where I was underwhelmed. Chickpea fritters-this was my favorite item. Crisply fried, delicious flavor. I'm a sauce lover, and they came without anything to dip, so I dipped in olive oil. Simply delicious and gluttonous.  Caprese salad was okay. The tomato was marinated and a softer texture. I hoped for more flavor. We ordered one to share, and they served us each a portion on our own plates, which was a nice touch. We decided on the prosciutto pizza and the lobster risotto (special). The pizza crust had brick oven crispy edges with a more soggy crust, typical in Italian style pizzas. It just lacked anything that made it stand out. I've had (much) better, and so I guess my standard was high. The risotto was exceptionally saucy-too saucy (and I'm a sauce person), undercooked and had a fishy flavor. My very first bite was without any lobster, and the very first flavor I tasted and thought that crossed my mind about it was ""fishy"".  If/when we return for our outdoor dining experience, we'll try pasta entrees.",0.9949,0.834,0.155,0.01,0.5709702380952382

We started with fried calamari and an arugula salad which could have been the best ever.  The calamari was perfectly done with no greasy feeling at all--accompanied by a light dipping sauce. For my main course I had the spinach pasta bolognese ( half order which was ample) which was delicious.

Not a comfortable environment to be chatting and celebrating with friends  Food was hit or miss this time. The salad we got had a delicious lemon parmesan vinaigrette. Our other app was flavorless . Same with the pasta, one , the ragu pasta we loved and the seafood one was a miss. The shrimp was seriously over cooked  .  Nothing was nearly as good as i remembered .

2016-11-28,4.0,"I'd been to Piccolo Sogno a long time ago but my gf wanted to go for her birthday so we went the other night. Overall, the food was great and the service was great. We started with the fried calamari, which I know is a bit of a standard option, but we hadn't had it in a while and it was great. Very lightly fried so it was crispy but not oily at all and the sauce it came with was delicious, must've added some cream to it. I opted for the pappardelle with boar and she went for the ragu. The pappardelle was the better option I think and it was great. The pasta was clearly house-made and freshly made it was great. The wild boar sauce was also full of wild boar, not just a couple chunks but there was enough wild boar that I actually had sauce/boar left over after eating all the pasta.  Her ragu was fine but there are better options on the menu. We had noted on the reservation it was for a birthday but as he asked about dessert and there had been zero mention of a birthday (at the hostess stand, as we sat down, etc), we feared they'd forgotten. They must've slow-played the hand or heard us mention the birthday because after asking what we wanted for dessert, they did bring us the Mille Foglie which was the highlight of the meal. Strongly recommend - imagine a deconstructed cannoli.  Only complaint I have is that we were seated at the very back of the restaurant next to the kitchen despite the fact there were a number of open tables throughout the restaurant.

They seated us off in a corner, where it was completely empty. After a number of Caucasian couples showed up and were the seated with the others in the middle, a Chinese couple showed up and were promptly seated next to us, off in the corner.  At this point, we thought it still could have been a coincidence (despite being one of two non-white couples seated quite conspicuously in the corner away from everyone else).  However, a third couple (half Chinese), were also promptly in the ""time out"" corner, next to us and the only other Chinese couple.  At this point, the outdoor area is over half full with the only three non-white couples seated off in a corner.   To be fair, we do not know for sure if this seating arrangement was intentional, but it certainly appeared that way to us.",0.4223,0.949,0.03,0.021,0.32262806637806635

Here's what we ordered:  Griglia Mista (Grilled calamari, shrimp, octopus, arugula in lemon and caper infused olive oil): My roommate and I usually love everything this dish consists of, but we were both surprisingly underwhelmed...The seafood felt a little undercooked, but perhaps our palates just aren't accustomed. Not sure.  Spaghetti Neri (Black spaghetti with mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari): Incredible. We actually really enjoyed all the seafood IN this dish and felt it was cooked well, which is a little confusing. My roommate enjoyed the sauce in particular.  Stracci Di Farro (Farro flour pasta, asparagus, leeks, truffle oil, parmesan, etc): Also incredible. I love truffle oil. Note that the pastas come in appetizer portions! I'm really not a fan of giant portions, so this was exciting for me.  Pana cotta: Served with fruits and caramel. Ugh it was so good. So many flavors in perfect harmony :') We also ordered a bottle of red wine, and our total was just over $50 each (!!!). Our server, Leonardo D. (Leonardo DiCaprio?¿) was great as well.

Outdoor space was full but the interior of the restaurant was maybe 40% full (we wanted to sit inside). So why couldn't we get an earlier reservation? I realize there are a ton of factors that go into this, but it really seemed like the earlier times may have been restricted to make it seem more in-demand. Anyway... - Indoor dining area is very cramped - Solid bread and oil/vinegar - Fried calamari wasn't great - Excellent wine list. I defer to my gf on these matters but she said it was a great selection and this seems to be the common refrain - She had the Tortelli Primavera and enjoyed it. Definitely made with a ton of butter...so good - I had a pizza that was on special with bacon and caramelized onions. Very tasty and a good size as well, probably in the neighborhood of a typical thin crust medium pizza  I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it since I've lived in the area and always wanted to go.

Rude. I am not even exaggerating when I tell you that the minute we put down our forks when we were done with our appetizers, they came and swooped away our appetizer plates and put down our entrees. We were given our bill before our desert came ""just so we have it"".  Rude.  I do prefer my food served hot rather than not-so-hot, but this was beyond.  It was served so extremely hot (WITHOUT a warning from the server)  that the roof of my mouth was still sore days later. I had 2 bites and could not tolerate anymore because of my burned mouth.  And to balance it out nicely, my dining partner's ravioli was not even lukewarm, so much so the sauce had hardened when it was put in front of her.  I will say that the bread, caprese salad and ambiance were nice, but the service bombed and we will not be back.",-0.8755,0.845,0.064,0.092,0.46067251461988296

2016-02-24,1.0,"GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT!  I've been to Piccolo Sogno restaurant many many times and always enjoyed and recommended it. This is why I can't believe what happened there last Thursday night, 2/18/16. My friend and I arrived on time for our 9pm reservation and were greeted as usual and seated at a table in the enclosed porch area. The waiter, who was new to his job (he didn't seem to know a lot about the menu and at the end of dinner said he wasn't sure what grappa was) , took our wine order and recommended that we start with the antipasti. That was the end of anything that could be called a normal, much less a fine fine dining experience that evening at piccolo Sogno. THEN: The waiter came back and said that there was suddenly no more antipasti because of a mysterious ""problem in the kitchen"" which he never explained. We ordered a different starter and began to eat when we noticed an acrid odor and dust particles in the air which were not sole fixing. We asked to be moved from the smell and the waiters immediately understood. We asked for a table in the main dining room but were told we would be better off on the far side of the room we were in. We noticed that the restaurant wax emptying out fast and at 9:20 were told to make our dinner orders because the kitchen was closing. We had checked in advance and chosen Piccolo Sogno in part because the kitchen closes at 10 pm on Thursday nights, so we asked what was wrong. Again the waiter referred to the ""problem"" in the kitchen. We very sincerely asked the waiter if we should leave under the circumstances since we didn't want our dinner to be rushed. The waiter assured us that everything would be fine and that  we would not be rushed, so we ordered more wine and our entrées. For the rest of the meal we listened to drilling sounds and watched trees in the garden shaking to the sound of drilling. Every few minutes it seemed that's other waiter would come from the kitchen or dining room, quickly stare at us, and rush away. We were told barely midway through our entrees that we slid order dessert now if we wanted it since the dessert chef wanted to go home. It was still not even 10 pm. To top off this bizarre experience, our  bill, which came to $245.00, had nothing comped and no apologies or even goodbyes were offered from our main waiter, who had disappeared, or any of the others who had popped in as we tried to eat our meal. Aside from the invisible workers who must have been doing the drilling, the restaurant was deserted as we showed ourselves out except for one employee doing some paperwork at the bar.  The bottom line: The food we managed to get was ok, but the experience was one of the worst I've ever had, apart from the company of my friend, who I had really wanted to treat to a special dinner. I can no longer think if this restaurant t as a place to visit or recommend, not because  they had the misfortune to suffer an unexpected kitchen ""problem"" but because, when we asked if we should just leave in light of the issues the restaurant was having, we were assured that there was no need and that our meal would not be rushed or in any way compromised. How can a restaurant do this and expect to be thought of as a place of hospitality? As I said, I am shocked. $245.00 for a dinner for two a construction site with no apology, explanation, or compensation? Piccolo Sogno?

Before placing our orders, our waiter dropped off a bread basket at our table. There were 2 different types of bread and then breadsticks. I'm not going to pretend like I know the difference between the two types of bread, but I do know that they were super fresh and tasted great with the EVOO.  For my appetizer I had the twice baked bread. The flavor and spice in this was great, but it had a mushy consistency and that kind of turned me off. My friend had the oxtail which she sad she really liked.  For my second course I had the salmon and it was delicious! A nice crispy grilled outside and a flake off on your fork inside. The vegetables (especially the Brussels sprouts) and the garlic white wine sauce were delicious. Paired great with the salmon. I really could eat the vegetables and the sauce as a meal on their own.  Finally, for dessert I had the Mille Foglie (1000 layer pastry) with cream. This was great, but if you don't have a sweet tooth it might be too sweet you. The pastry was super flaky so it made it hard to eat with a fork. The filling almost tasted like raw cookie dough and I for one, am not mad about that. The cream was so fluffy and fresh. It did not have that fake too sweet taste like some of the stuff you buy from the store.    Oh, I also want to mention that this place has the softest, thickest, best paper towels that I have ever seen in any restaurant bathroom. I would go back to this place just to wash my hands!  All in all, I really enjoyed my time at Piccolo Sogno. I'm really excited to come back during the summer to enjoy their patio!",0.9989,0.727,0.24,0.033,0.5927099044746102
2016-02-06,2.0,"Honestly, I was a little disappointed with this experience.  We went during Restaurant Week and ordered off the prix fixe menu.  The waiter came to our table 3x to see if we were ready to order and we we were not - he was visibly annoyed and stormed off.  Mind you, the 3 attempts occurred in the span of 2.5 minutes!  For the first course, we all ordered salads. One of the salads didn't come out. When it finally did, everyone else had finished and the salad had ingredients that were requested to be removed from the preparation.  I had ordered the rabbit and it was bland and way overcooked.  My friends each ordered salmon and it too was overcooked and dry.  We had asked for another round of drinks those never came.  I will say that my dessert rocked though.",0.54,0.901,0.062,0.037,0.6616666666666666

The service was efficient and prompt, although not super friendly or warm. The soup sounded amazing when the waiter described it (fennel sausage, white bean, escarole, etc.), but I felt the flavor fell short and it was a little bland. The pasta was good, although the portion could have been a little bigger for my liking. The cream sauce was light and very different from your typical white sauce.  Side note - The crowd inside was entertaining because it seemed like half of the restaurant knew each other, knew the owner, etc. Gave off a little Goodfellas vibe.  Overall I would say I might come back outside of restaurant week for a dinner and see how the food and service differs from my visit today.",0.9465,0.842,0.132,0.025,0.43962121212121213

Servers paid such close attention to our water cups & plates and were constantly cleaning, so nice to see, not lazy at all!  We both had a different menu item, started with the twice baked bread.. Which is delicious and something I have never seen before and he had the ox tail which he said was very good. For dinner he had the Cornish hen and greens, which I've never tried and the skin was so crispy! The greens were actually very tasty too! My dish was the salmon, wonderfully made! Dessert, I didn't want it to end. I had the panna cotta, my god it was so good. And he had the flaky pastry with cream & chocolate chips.. Like a deconstructed cannoli, but differently flavored pastry.  Reservations saved us, we were seated right away. From then on, dinner service was so speedy!

Including about 7 options in the appetizer and entree categories and about 5 options for dessert. At $33 per person, the menu was well worth the money.  Entering the restaurant we were greeted by the host and were offered the pleasant option of a coat check. We were seated in their closed off patio, which did not have the same ambience as the rest of the restaurant but was not uncomfortable. Our waiter was excellent, paying close attention to our water and wine glasses throughout the night. The bread and olive oil was brought to our bread quickly, and the Focaccia bread in particular was delicious.   For appetizers we started with the La Ribollita which is essentially soup that has been soaked up by bread and then pan fried like a pancake. Sounds weird, but this was absolutely amazing. It was easily the best thing I ate all night and all the food I had was delicious. We also got the spinach salad which was good but nothing special.  For our main dishes we got pappardelle with boar Ragu and the salmon. Both were tasty, filling and well presented. For dessert the Panna cotta and Mille Foglie (similar to puff pastry with cream) were both excellent as well.  Overall we did not have any food that we wouldn't recommend, and the wonderful service made it a great experience.  The great deal with restaurant week made it all the better.  I will definitely be back with a healthy appetite!",0.9978,0.713,0.264,0.023,0.6032142857142858

We started the meal splitting the chick pea fries and beet salad. Both were great. The chick pea fries had a great texture and perfect amount of cheese on it. The salad was on point. You can never go wrong with beets and fennel.  For my meal I had the spaghetti neri, appetizer size. Perfect amount of pasta for me to enjoy without feeling too stuffed to have dessert too.

2015-12-28,3.0,"Had never been here before but always drive by it so finally decided to give it a go. Made reservations via OpenTable and later had to adjust them (adding on) which the host easily and nicely accommodated.  When we arrived the valet parked our car ($10; free if you're there for lunch) and we waited all of 1 minute for our table. The hostess took us to the back room that adjoins the patio which in the summer I'm sure is nice and with the doors open, quiets down the noise. However, we went the day after Christmas and I'm guessing because we were a table of 5 we got seated with the big parties which became a competition to see who could be the loudest table. My poor in-laws had a hard time conversing with us across the table. Honestly, I felt worse for the couple seated next to us at the only two-seater table in the room. Deduct one star for ambiance -- which yelp says is romantic. Maybe up in the front room, but not when you get seated in the back room.  As for the food, I felt it was a bit overpriced compared to some of the other local Italian restaurants that seem to serve up generous portions of amazing food for under $20/entree. The menu was also not as varied as I would have liked -- the specials were mainly all fish-based and from the main menu I found maybe 3 dishes I would be interested in trying.

It was good I guess but I don't know why it was $14 for the thinnest crust with a tiny bit of sauce and a tiny bit of cheese and 2 leaves of basil. Needed some seasoning in my opinion, the sauce could have used some salt and pepper. The Picollo Ravioli were not good. I was so confused by them. Is it sweet is it savory I have no idea. The filling was a little gritty. The pasta was a little tough. The pappardelle with ragu was not impressive either. The ragu needed some sort of moisture.

I was recommended this place as one of the best Italian restaurants in the city, but sadly it's one of those places with a lot of pretense and little value to back it up. It's definitely popular among the stuffy older crowd. We started our dinner with burrata and prosciutto , which was excellent and the only enjoyable part of our experience. The burrata was incredible actually. The entrees weren't so much. The food came out so hot I actually burned my tongue. We had to wait 10-15 minutes for it to cool down.  I had their fish and seafood stew, which had no fish in it, but 70% calamari. The shellfish wasn't cleaned property, the sauce was good, but overall nothing to write home about. My foodie in arms had their veal meatball pasta, which was lackluster. The meatballs were good, but the pasta and the sauce were quite bad. We barely ate a half of our entrees, but were never asked if we liked them or wanted to take leftovers (which we did not).  The service: 2/5. We were there to celebrate a birthday, which I informed the restaurant about beforehand. At no point during our dinner this was ever acknowledged.

I ate very slowly and took small bites just to savor the dish for as long as I could. My Mom ordered the tagliolini di castagna, which came with really tender veal meatballs.

To sum it up on how much I love these places well...We spent NYE with a large party for dinner here...special occasions...here, my last 2 birthdays I chose...here, friends or family in town...we take them here, just because...here. Most places can't hold a candle to consistency but these two nail it every time. They are local Chicago owner/operated chef-driven restaurants, both have beautiful interiors and lovely outdoor patios. Service is always good, friendly and not pretentious, you will feel comfortable here all dressed up or casual. Now for the most important part...the food!!! Everything is fresh, flavorful and authentic. I've been to Italy and yes this place will take you there! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu I have tasted my way thru most of it. What you should get --Pizza Diavolo yes I'm a pizza freak & it's one of my favorite restaurant pizzas I never go there without ordering it as an app...its divine!! --Spaghetti Neri or Pappardelle con Cinghiale 2 of their best pastas in my opinion, plus you can order any of their pastas as an appetizer portion if you want to sample --Salmone, the preparation changes but it's always amazing, this is usually what I order for my entree. --The Whole Branzino is delightful, flaky melt in your mouth goodness --The Mare, Polpo and Griglia Mista all good --All of the salads are great and the sides are tasty too --Note they can be a little olive oil heavy on some dishes but if you prefer just ask and they will make it lighter for you Please whatever you do don't skip dessert, you must order their homemade gelato it's heavenly, I'm a gelato nut and extremely picky and theirs passes my test! It's smooth, creamy and not too sweet with subtle flavors that don't over power. I want to say it's even better than the stuff I've had in Italy, yep it's true!

When the waiter brought our cocktails he requested us to order our entire meal at once, we were both hesitant to do so since we did not want to be rushed and preferred to have our dinner paced. We explicitly expressed this to our waiter that we wanted our meal paced and do not want the salad immediately after the appetizer and entrée immediately after the salad. The waiter understood our request and told us not to worry he will take care of everything. The appetizer arrived which was an antipasto platter with roasted vegetables with prosciutto. The presentation was very nice as well as the combination of the platter. We finished the antipasto and a few minutes later were served our salads. We both overlooked the turnaround time between the appetizer and salads. As we finished our salads the waiter came by with our entrees in hand, removing our salad plates and placing the entrees in front of us! Whoa! I lost it! Either the waiter is being rushed by management to turn over the tables as fast as possible or Piccolo Sogno wanted us to eat as fast as possible and get the hell out. The waiter told us he doesn't have control over the kitchen and brought our the entrees to us since they were ready. I told him this is unacceptable since we had already requested to pace our dinner appropriately. The waiter sent the manager to our table and he offered to take our entrees away until we were ready for them. What an insult! We requested our check and left.

On top of that, I always have a craving for Italian on my special day. If you decide to check in, make sure to make reservations because it does fill up quickly. For a table of six, we were seated at a room further in the back. The waiters were all dapper and attentive. For starters, we ordered a bottle of red wine called Primitivo Salento Sasseo 2011. It had a full body flavor with subtle hints of fruit and spices. Hands down the best red wine I've ever had. Each bottle is priced at $50, but if you truly have the moolah to spend, I'm pretty sure I saw a $900 bottle on the menu. Jinkies! Furthermore, I ordered the Spaghetti Neri which contained a generous portion of seafood and pasta. The flavors were rich and the pasta was black, which I'm assuming is colored by squid ink. My stepmother ordered one of the listed specials which was the lobster ravioli. Since it was my birthday, I've received two plates of biscotti made two ways:  1.) Biscotti with almond and raisin 2.) Biscotti with chocolate and hazelnut  As long as you order a coffee on the side, dunk the biscotti like a beautiful basketball and feel the sparks fly as you take a bite.

We're not big drinkers, so I can't comment on the wine at all.  But, we do LOVE good Italian food - all of it, from pasta to seafood to meat dishes.  So, we decided to try all of the above.   We started by splitting the beet salad.  It's a very pretty salad...and it definitely tasted as good as it looked!   Then, since we couldn't decide on what entrees to order, we each decided to order a pasta dish as an appetizer.  (BTW, what a great idea - to offer their large pasta dishes in appetizer-sized portions!)  We both ended up with the Spaghetti Neri.  It was truly amazing!  I couldn't believe the quantity and the quality of the seafood in the dish.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was incredibly tasty.  We both agreed that it was the best nero pasta dish we'd ever eaten. For our main courses, we ordered the branzino (Italian sea bass) fish special, as well as the roasted duck (which is served with Tuscan kale, fennel sausage, and a cauliflower puree). The fish is prepared whole, presented to the table, taken back to the kitchen for de-boning, and then brought back to the table for eating.  The fish was super fresh and light, and wonderfully prepared with a citrus butter sauce.  It was excellent.  The duck was even more delicious!  And what a generous portion!  The fennel sausage in that dish is scrumptious.  Everything was perfectly cooked and very tasty. For dessert, we took our waiter's recommendation and got the molten chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream.  It was so yummy!  My boyfriend isn't a huge fan of hazelnuts, but even he couldn't help but rave about (and devour!) this dessert. The restaurant was very full and happily noisy...  It's not the most intimate and romantic dining experience, but still a very nice, warm atmosphere.  So, that's perhaps the only ""negative"" thing I can say about Piccolo Sogno.

Unfortunately, the food itself was mediocre at best. Burrata with prosciutto--average, with no attractive presentation. Fava bean and arugula salad with lemon and olive oil--a large plate of greens with a good 3 cups of fava beans (sometimes less is more...). Four-cheese ravioli with a sausage red sauce--OK. Fried calamari--nicely crisped nice but not seasoned at all. I asked for a second round of lemon wedges, just to give it some oomph, and applied salt and pepper liberally. With all the great calamari out there--fried with lemon wedges, parsley, pepperoncini, etc--it seems as though they could apply a little more imagination. Or, make ""simple"" outstanding.

This really grossed me out. A waiter very kindly apologized and took the dish away and brought out a new version of the risotto. The new risotto had a completely different texture - now I know cooking risotto is a skill because I've taken some classes on Italian cooking - but I think flavor and consistency should stay the same. Furthermore, the majority of the restaurants that I visit always make the dish complimentary if there is some mistake on their behalf (such as hair, accidentally making the dish with meat, bringing out the wrong order, etc).

2015-04-15,5.0,"I should have written this review ages ago. A recent date to Piccolo Sogno inspired me to get online and sing their praises. This place is a must if you like Italian food. The dishes are unique and flavorful, and the ambience is unmatched. Chef Tony Priolo is a true artist and as humble as he is gifted. The servers are knowledgable about the menu and will make genuine recommendations. Our server, Riccardo, was probably the best server I have come across in a long while; his personality is a true compliment to the dining experience. And the bussers were on point and stealthy.  Things you should consider, though there are always specials worth a try: Pappardelle with spiced wild boar ragu; Spaghetti Neri; Rosticciana (braised beef short ribs). People rave about the Branzino; I just haven't tried it yet. We had a special ravioli with shrimp and cherry tomatoes and it was killer.  In my opinion, on a date, split a salad, appetizer, pasta and main course. They'll split it for you. Don't forget dessert - we had a chocolate lava cake (flourless maybe?). Servers are knowledgeable about the wine list. The white wine Riccardo recommended was a compliment to our evening (I just wish I remember what it was). The outdoor patio, btw, is one of the most beautiful in the city. Rain or shine, though, I would put Piccolo at the top of my list.",0.9863,0.807,0.166,0.027,0.46604010025062653
2015-04-12,1.0,"RATS! A decapitated one at that.  It was laying lifeless (naturally) at the front door greeting us. My wife and I looked around, received not more than a shrug from the underwhelmed valet entourage, looked back at each other, and scurried off...like the rodents that are likely still nesting in Piccolo's kitchen walls.  We love Piccolo for its romantic outdoor seating option that transports us to a world far from Chicago. It's truly unique and a gem that has captured our consideration anytime Italian food is in order.  But, back to the rat. Or was it a mouse? Tough to tell with its head is missing and innards spilled over the front door threshold. I digress.   Since Piccolo is one of our staples, and we do want it to continue to succeed here in our backyard, we called to inform them of the issue and perhaps greater health code headache that awaits them once they dig a bit deeper. (Was that a peppercorn on your plate last weekend? Let's hope).  I got hold of a gentleman answering phones. He was charming and welcoming at first Ciao. I followed my greeting with a detailed recap of what we had just experienced. (Reminder: dead rat, headless, valet shrugs, wife gags, reservations canceled, scurry away...) He paused, thought about it for 5 long uncomfortable seconds (as I took a sip of my beer across the street at The Dawson. Yes, we bounced back nicely) and said, ""ok, thanks. I'll let them know. What was your name again? Ok. *click*). No apology, no plan of action, no please let us make it up to you, no phone call back from management, no disappointment, no free ""I Survived The Piccolo Zoo"" t-shirt. What you see is what you get. Thoughtless, brainless, faceless - the restaurant and its gone too soon furry friend alike.  It was a case study in what not to do customer service 101, health code violations 101, and any other 101 course you take that teaches you that when your goal is to turn a profit, you handle these sensitive situations like this (enter quote from top tier MBA program here). Piccolo clearly skipped class.  I think you get the picture. No need to beat a dead rat. Piccolo came up short, its food safety is suspect, its customer service response is inexcusable, its garden is beautiful but we won't be back. It's never easy, but when something dies, you just need to appreciate the time you once had together and move on. Arrivederci Piccolo.",0.9263,0.812,0.115,0.073,0.5075

After recommending the perfect wine in response to my typically vague description of light fruity & not too dry, he took our order of: CODA DI VACCINARA (oxtail), STRACCI DI FARRO (farro pasta) and CONIGLIO ALLA CACCIATORE (hunter-style braised rabbit). We mentioned we're sharing the dishes, but instead of serving it family style, we were given our own portions for all 3 dishes. Everything tasted excellent. The oxtail was fork-tender and flavorful. We waved away the bread basket too early so I couldn't soak up the excellent oxtail sauce. The farro pasta was similar to regular fresh pasta, which I was very surprised about, but the flavors of the mushroom sauce were spot on (ok I'm a mushroom-lunatic, so maybe I'm slightly biased...). The rabbit was not dry at all and again the sauce was richly flavored. In hindsight we should probably have ordered something light to counterbalance the heavier dishes, but I thoroughly enjoyed everything.

Constant hustle and bustle around us with waiters and busboys yelling and running. Waiter was polite and decently attentive but not engaging or helpful at all.

A little overdone with the rosemary and not enough cauliflower to be called cauliflower soup (which was what sold me when the server mentioned it). Later we had the cornish hen dish as well as the duck. The polenta in the duck dish tasted more like cauliflower than the soup did. Highly recommend the duck dish, plus, the serving size makes it shareable. The hen was excellent but the greens in the dish were a tad too bitter for my taste and did not seem to go well with the dish other than the beautiful pop of color. Dessert was amazing and even though we were incredibly full already, we had to have even the last crumb.

Our pasta was cold as well and after 80 minutes of waiting we were starving and shoveled it down.

This caprese was different than the ones I've had in other places because the tomatoes were oven dried. The tomatoes didn't overwhelm the dish at all. This is a great appetizer.  We split the stracci de forro pasta. The kitchen split it into two plates, and the portions were huge. The pasta was full of flavor and the vegetables were cooked perfectly.

This isn't just a restaurant that uses quality ingredients, they use these ingredients to make everything from scratch. The detail and love that Piccolo Sogno puts into their menu items is really what takes it from incredible to extraordinary. There wasn't one thing on the menu that I'd say was just ok. Everything was a brand new and wonderful experience. Even my Bellini was exquisitely delicious.  You have not lived until you have tried pasta made in house.  There is absolutely nothing like it. You cannot replicate that quality with anything prepackaged. The entrée menu was so extremely tempting, but based on the other reviews I knew I had to try a pasta and I'm so glad I did. How they managed to make something as simple as ravioli taste so incredibly delectable is beyond me, but they knocked it out of the park. I was lucky enough to sample some other pasta dishes from my friends I was dining with and it was all delicious. The seafood in the Frutti Di Mare was such a fabulous quality that it took me off guard! While I did not taste it, several people got the leg of lamb and they all said it was the most amazing lamb they'd ever had. When you're dining with several European foodies, that's an enormous compliment. We ordered three desserts, but the hands down winner was the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake.

2014-10-02,3.0,"I went to Piccolo Sogno for my sister's 25th birthday party. It was a last minute plan and I have to say they were very accommodating with accepting the party of 8 for that same day.  When we arrived at the restaurant I loved that they had valet parking for $8. Not bad for saving me 1/2 hr trying to find parking in Chicago. We were seated promptly with the rest of the party in the outside patio section. I loved the patio with the tea lights, heating torches, and the big tree in the patio. I loved the wooden deck area and the space in general was very welcoming.  As far as the food, I was not too impressed with it. I felt like I have tasted better Italian food in other restaurants. I tried really hard to like it because of all the great reviews and the beautiful setting but it just didn't click with me. For appetizers our table ordered grilled veggies which were ok, nothing special. We also ordered the calamari which was pretty standard and I ate it no problem. For my main meal I was going to go for the Piccolo Sogno ravioli because of all the positive things said about the dish but I decided to try something different because my sister-in-law ordered the ravioli so I figured I would try some from her plate. I went for the Stracci di Farro which had everything I love asparagus, mushrooms, garlic, pasta, and although I hadn't had truffle oil I figured it couldn't be bad. Well, when I got my dish I was excited but when I tried it I hated it. I really just did not like all the oil and the smell and taste of the oil threw everything else off. I passed my plate around the table for the rest of my group to taste and they seemed underwhelmed too. I ended up not eating it and just taking bits from others plates.  My younger sister had the pizza which was good with a thin crust and good meaty ingredients on top. I mostly helped her finish that. My brother in-law ordered the Gnocchi D'estate  which was pretty good. The ravioli was also pretty good but I wouldn't say it is my favorite pasta as a lot of people have mentioned.  Overall the rest of the food was ok/good but not what I expected. I think I had hyped it up in my mind and by the time I got to the dinner I was underwhelmed with the food. I can say I have tasted better food.  I will say, I would give this place a second chance because of the atmosphere and the service was phenomenal. The waiters  were excellent always making sure our glasses were full, friendly/approachable, and were so attentive. I didn't mention to the waiter that I did not like my plate but he picked up on it when I had set it aside. He asked if I would like it to go and politely told him I would not. He then asked me if I did not enjoy the food. I told him I did not particularly like that plate and he whisked it away saying he would make sure I was not charged for it and offered to take another order of something else. I was embarrassed because I don't like to make a fuss at restaurants but I also was so grateful that they did not charge for a plate I basically had not touched. I did order dessert and enjoyed the panna cotta and my sister had a really delicious chocolate cake with hazelnut  ice-cream.  Overall, I would say that I would return to enjoy the patio area and maybe give the food a second try.

Our entrees were crazy good.  I had the stewed rabbit with semolina pudding (basically like polenta), and it was so tender and flavorful and awesome.  The boyf had the spaghetti neri ""frutti di mare.""  The handmade squid ink pasta was perfectly cooked and totally delicious, and the sauce was simple and perfect and showcased the seafood and the pasta very well.  (I don't know if they make their pasta in house or not, but whoever made it, well done.) Our appetizers were good, but the chickpea fries really needed some sauce or something.  They were perfectly light and crispy, but just kind of begging for some acid and moisture.  I loved the boyf's squash blossoms, but he was slightly underwhelmed and a little annoyed that there were only 3 on the plate for like $12.  (But bonus...the sauce from the squash blossoms was great on the chickpea fries.) The gianduja dessert was amazing.  We both took a bite and made the face.  The ""OMG foodgasm"" face.  The ricotta cheesecake was very good, but just a little grainier than I'm used to.   The service started off very swift and attentive.  But, it did slow down as the meal progressed.  It's a large place, and they were busy, so I understand why.  And we weren't in a hurry, so it was okay.  But sometimes the waiter would come with the glass for the wine, but then not come back with the actual wine for a long time, or someone would come with the bowl for the seafood shells, making us think our food was coming, but then the food wouldn't come for another 20 minutes.  The waiter would come drop something off but then not stay for us to ask for a drink or some dessert, so we'd have to wait for him to come by again.  He was working hard in a busy, tightly packed restaurant, so I don't want to fault him too much (especially because a lot of the delays were probably not his fault).  But it seems like 1 hour and 45 minutes for dinner for 2 was a little excessive by American standards.  Again, we weren't in a hurry, so we didn't really mind that much, but I imagine they'd like their patio turnover to be faster than that.  I will say that all the employees I saw seemed to be working their asses off, so maybe the delays are just the nature of a relatively large, high-end restaurant like this.

The hostess I made the reservation was short, which gave me a bad feeling from the start. When we arrived, about 15 min early for our reservation, I checked in with the hostess. She said they were running late. When I asked how long it may be (10 min, 30 min, etc), she said just come back at 930, and she would tell me then. The male host was also, just rude and gruff. While waiting at the bar, he came up to tell us the table was ready. When he asked us if we had a tab open, he said ""you need to pay the tab"", as if we planned to just walk away. Then he just stood there impatiently while the bartender rang up the tab. Our server also sucked. I believe his name was Rudy or something. Didn't welcome us, didn't explain anything about the menu, and only said are you ready to order. We had to ask for water refills, ask for dessert menus, ask for salt (the food was barely seasoned). They made our small, respectful party of 4 seem like we were doing them a favor by patronizing their restaurant. Last but not least, I am usually able to look past crap service when the food is amazing. Here, again, Piccolo Sogno failed. The lobster risotto was hilariously bland. The pizza diavolo was about as good as a Red Baron frozen pepperoni, the gnocchi was dry, and the truffle pasta special was undercooked to about 2 notches under al dente.",0.6322,0.842,0.086,0.072,0.5021756978653531

Seriously, it  makes you feel like you are a million miles away from the city. Everyone at the table had received a glass for their wine. The entire time we were there I had the strong feeling that no one knew which table was who's. A guy walked up right after I sat down and goes, did someone get your drinks yet? We obviously had a bottle of wine sitting in the middle of the table and everyone but me had drinks. Pretty obvious answer. I did ask for a glass while he was there.. which he never brought. Just a few minutes after that another guy walked up and asked if anyone had come to the table yet. Uh.. yes someone has, then he walked away. Then it took over 10 minutes for yet another person to come by and ask if we were ready to order. We said we were ready to order apps but not our meals. He said if he only took my app order without the meals, it would take 45 minutes for our meals to come out. I thought that was weird, but ok that's fair. We put in our order. The burrata and carpaccio were both delicious. While waiting for our meal, we had waiters yelling over our table to each other and it just seemed like utter chaos as far as the service was concerned. I shared the gnocchi and seafood spaghetti with a friend. They were both very unimpressive and have had much better for much cheaper. The seafood seemed rubbery and overcooked. The gnocchi was in a red sauce. I appreciate different spins on food, but this just didn't work. When we finished our food, a waiter came up and asked if we wanted more wine. When we said no, he walked away and someone brought a check like 5 minutes later. I guess we don't get the option of dessert or coffee? During the entire meal, not a single waiter gave a name or introduced themselves. There were so many we couldn't keep track. When we were leaving, a bunch of staff was standing inside talking to each other and when we walked by they started yelling random phrases in Italian and Spanish, I guess as a way to say goodbye?

All were lukewarm to cold except for the corrected ones that came out hot. - At 9:15pm, all we wanted to do was to leave so we requested the bill.  Instead, they said our desserts were coming.  We didn't order desserts.  They said it was for the mixup in the food.  That's very nice - but we didn't want or ask for it.  What we wanted was to leave.  The manager apologized again and said he would take care of it on the bill. - The bill finally came at 9:30pm and was not itemized.  We had no idea if anything was taken off, no idea if service was already included.  We contemplated asking for an itemized bill but were too worried we wouldn't leave the joint until 10pm.  All we wanted to do was to go home. - Valet guy rocked.  My car was ready in less than 2 minutes.  That was the highlight of the night.",0.9869,0.811,0.13,0.059,0.5462698412698412

The Spaghetti Neri could have used more seafood but the taste was quite delectable. The Fettuccine was a little oily but delicious as a small portion.

It was the perfect amount of food, the risotto was cooked to perfection and the saffron enveloped the dish with tasty goodness. It came with seafood as well, which I normally would say, ""put more in,"" but the chef had chargrilled the octopus well and it added a perfect smokiness to the dish.

It is a beautiful patio I must say But it was busy and really really loud. We sat and a couple minutes and we were greater by our server. He asked if we would like a cocktail or wine. We all ordered drinks and chatted while we waited for them while we looked at the menu. I told my friends about some of the dishes I've had here before . Our drinks arrived and we chatted some more while deciding what to order. We waited a good ten minutes before our server came back to take our order . We all ordered  we had the grilled app with shrimp and calamari to start And I had the Fava bean and pecorino salad which I've had before . Jim ordered the asparagus salad and our server quickly said we don't have that tonight? Really isn't not asparagus season? So he ordered the kale salad . For entrees I had the Special pizza with black truffles. Jim had the shortrib with mashed potatoes and brocollini. Peter had the whole roasted fish and Cricket had the gnocchi.  We also ordered a bottle of Amarone. We asked the server to pick us one med priced one. We finished up our cocktails and waited and waited and waited for our server , food or even the wine ? What happened? Now its 8:45 we've been here for an hour and fifteen minutes and we haven't seen any food yet. Our server seems to have disappeared? I asked several Bus boys to find our server. Mean while The Manager, I assume, was talking to a server actually sort of yelling at him right in front of our table while doing so hes picking his ear?? Sort of gross I must say.... well finally the server comes with the wine pours us a taste and its sort of on the warm side. So peter ask to have it chilled down before we have some. So what does the server do? He pours everyone a taste. So finally the food comes My salad had no flavor really needed seasoning but of course no salt or pepper on the table So I'll ask our server right? wrong don't see him for another 15 minutes or so. I'm starved I cant wait and eat it anyways. The grilled app is good nice char on the shrimp and calamari. The kale salad was also good. Now entrees come The short ribs were good but the mash potatoes and brocolli were over cooked and muddles together. My pizza was ok nice flavor, the whole roasted fish was the winner great flavor with the roasted fennel. The Gnocchi was good and very rich. Dessert we had the ricotta  cake and the custard in filo dough. both were good. When the check came I noticed the Amarone was on the bill as open wine? which is unusual because I didn't check the price on the list So hopefully it was rung correctly.  A bit suspicious.

Not too soggy with oil, the sprouts were literally still crisp and fresh. For dinner we wanted to split the Mediterranean bass and the steak. So they brought out 4 plates with it already spit for us. Not a carb in sight! (I try to eat low carb). The steak was cooked perfectly. It was moist, had flavor and wasn't too tough. The bass...... I don't think the English language has a word that is adequate enough. We ate everything and still had room for dessert!!!! And boy was the creme cake and pudding good. The entire experience was very Italian, and by that I mean that we were there for a couple hours enjoying and biding our time. Our glasses never emptied either. (So attentive).

So I made reservations over a month in advance, and even then only had an option between two time slots! I started thinking there was a good reason this place was popular!  So we arrive for our 8:30 reservation, mind you it's winter in February. There were already so many people crowded in the entrance and bar area waiting for tables and the hostess tells us the party at our table hadn't left yet. So we wait - about 40 minutes for our RESERVED table. Strike one. Then the hostess proceeds to lead us to a table STUFFED in the corner of the drafty back tent that they apparently use for extra seating. Strike two. Thank god the waiter was a nice, genuine Italian (impressed my dad) and suggested a good wine. When the appetizers came out, the mixed grilled calamari tasted like the grill it was cooked on! I couldn't stand to choke it down. Then the entrees came out, way too fast, and my ahi tasted just as terrible as the appetizer! Strike three. My dad's wild boar and parapadelle was the only good dish of the evening, aside from the pizza we shared but who can screw up a pizza?  Later, in the middle of the night I woke up with a pounding headache and began vomiting. I couldn't link it to anything! I'm a frequent red wine drinker and I couldn't see how that could have been the issue.

Even a simple order such as a dirty martini seems to be problematic.

2014-02-01,4.0,"I'd been wanting to try Piccolo Sogno since I moved back to Chicago this summer. I was fortunate enough to snag an 8:30pm reservation last night during restaurant week.  My review of this much talked about Italian eatery breaks down into two components, one which lived up to the hype and one which did not.  First, the food: Very good. Our dishes were solid. We had the spinach and the arugula salads to start. In my opinion, the spinach salad was the winner here. The crispy fried panchetta made it a stand-out. A bit dry, but I added the house balsamic and that fixed the problem. The main courses we chose we the boar ragu and the cheese ravioli. Both pastas were very fresh. I particularly liked the brown butter sauce on the ravioli, which you'll enjoy if you don't mind a touch of sweetness with dinner. Deserts were less thrilling. As others have said, the panna cotta was a bit watery almost, and wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. The ricotta cheesecake was light but also not as flavorful. The sauce and fresh berries on both were great, though. Overall: very solid, but nothing epic. There are equally great Italian restaurants in the city. Props for a huge list of bottles with a variety of options ranging in price, though.  Second: the atmosphere. This was a let-down for me. It was loud, which is understandable for a busy Friday night, but so much so that my date and I had to raise our voices to hear one another across our two-top. It's a very big, open space so the sound just echoes in here. Service was good, but not remarkable.  I'll be back again, but only when it's nice enough to dine outside on the patio, which, I think, is why others truly rave about this place.

Many ordered the fresh homemade pasta and raved about it.  I didn't have it this time, but the black ink squid spaghetti and the Bronzino fish are always two favorites, A friend and I enjoyed the salmon and the risotto special that evening. Both perfect. The wine list is extensive with many great producers and varietals. Thank you Piccolo Sogno for another special evening.

Space was incredible and our service was very, very Italian, in a good way.  Used the A La Card discount deck to bring the total price down by a few bucks, but even without it, I thought the value proposition was very fair.  Now I have tough decisions to make when I come to this area...La Scarola, or Piccolo Sogno?  It might come down to atmosphere...if you want ""mobsters used to eat here with celebrities"", La Scarola is the call, but for a classier open space, Piccolo Sogno gets the nod.  I thought the pasta at both locations was excellent and the prices are similar.",0.9576,0.879,0.107,0.014,0.5655555555555556
2013-12-20,5.0,"Impressed? Well, I'm not sure that even begins to describe my experience at Piccolo Sogno. My Italian wine group decided to head here for one of our monthly tastings. My friend had arranged for us to have a table and told them about our dinner theme. To say we were made welcome from the get go would be an understatement. This was A+ service the whole way and I didn't want to wait til the end to bring it up.  The GM was the one who was handling us and he understood very early on that we were going to want to share with each other. Not only did he arrange for the dishes to come out like that, they personally split up the courses.  We started off with the Burrata and the Griglia Mista. Since I'm not the biggest fan of octopus or squid, I let my friends have some more of that one. The burrata was damn good. The cheese was done perfectly and they also had prosciutto along with it. This was a great way to start things off. We next moved onto the veal and boar ragus. We were drinking Amarone and heavier dishes were needed. Both ragus were spot on with just the right amount of sauce and meat.  The finale were the short ribs and the duck. Now the food had been really filling up to this point, but these dishes were too good to pass up. The short ribs were tender and filled with flavor. This dish alone would've been great. But, then came the duck. Flat out, this was special. This was easily the star dish and one to search out. The duck was done perfectly and the polenta with it just added to the savoriness.  Piccolo Sogno was a complete knock out. We will be back here for another higher end dinner. The food and service was absolutely stellar and I have nothing but the greatest praise for them.

Quite honestly, I think they can skip the whole reveal...it wasn't that interesting to me but the sea bass was mouth watering. Mmmmmm Service: Top notch!

I've tried my fair share of Italian restaurants in Chicago and Piccolo Sogno is definitely one of the top ones. Stracci de Farro: an excellent dish if you love your truffles. Pasta is cooked just right and the truffle flavor isn't overwhelming unlike a lot of pasta with truffle dishes I've had in the pasta. Highly recommend this.  Calamari: soft and delicious. One of the main defining points of a good calamari for me is their chew factor. If it is chewy and hard to bite off, it's not good. The calamari here was done very well - the meat was soft and the breading was just right. Would love to try the grilled calamari next time.  My friends ordered some specials that night - grilled whole branzini and risotto with pesto and grilled shrimp. Both were very tasty and everyone in the group was very happy with their meal.

This is absolutely the route to go at Piccolo Sogno as they were all original and fresh. I went with the spaghetti neri ""frutti di mare"" and loved all of it. The spicy tomato sauce was fantastic, there was plenty of seafood, and the black spaghetti rocked. Others at the table ordered the pappardelle, gnocchi, and fettuccine and were very happy.

2013-08-05,2.0,"To steal the wisdom of another reviewer, if it wasn't for the ambience of the outdoor patio, a visit to this much-hyped restaurant wouldn't be worth it.   To further elaborate, I think Chicagoans are desperate and enamored with the few outdoor venues to enjoy the little slice of summer we get every year.  As such, it's almost willing to forgive lackluster food when better Italian food can probably be had elsewhere.   We chose Piccolo Sogno for our anniversary dinner - our mistake for succumbing to what many swore to be the romantic vibe you'd get from this place.  Instead, our ""romantic"" dinner felt more like a zoo with swarms of people who were easily impressed and fooled by the fake Italian accent of Hispanic waiters who, yes, were fluent with a Romance language- just a different one.   Now let's get to the food.  The burrata with prosciutto was served ice cold, you'd think it  just came out of the freezer (or perhaps its Trader Joe's container). Those who love burrata know full well that it's supposed to be creamy and delicious, not ice cold and almost gelatinous in consistency.  We also had squash blossoms and it must have been sitting under the heat lamp for too long because it no longer had that light and airy texture of well-executed fried vegetables. The spaghetti neri ""frutti di mare"" was just ok, pasta was a tad overcooked.  For our second course, I opted for the branzino, a delicate sea bass that was prepared and presented whole, then later served in fillets- delicious with all the roasted vegetables.  Hubby had the rib eye and good with arugula and tomatoes it was served on.   Now I get tickled pink when I see panna cotta on the dessert menu and this too was a disappointment- closer to flan rather than the softer consistency of better panna cotta.    The only thing I was happy about is knowing that we got the itch of trying this place over with and am eager to move on to better Italian eating.",0.9904,0.782,0.164,0.054,0.5585365853658536

2013-07-28,4.0,"Items selected: Focaccia, Rustic White, Grissini, House Balsamic and Olive Oil Margherita - Tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil Gnocchi d'inverno - Spinach and potato gnocchi, mushrooms, oven dried tomatoes, toasted garlic, herbs Anatra e spinaci - Wood roasted, shredded duck with mushrooms, aged balsamic tossed with baby spinach Millefoglie Americano Much like New York and Philadelphia, one of my favorite things about Chicago is the wide range of mid-priced Italian restaurants throughout the city - not the typical ""red sauce"" places that are ubiquitous in any ""Little Italy"" and packed with tourists, but rather the chef driven spaces where businessmen hold meetings, locals go to meet friends, and the maitre d' knows (or at least seems to know) everyone in the room...especially the round table of big guys that may or may not be ""Family,"" - blood relatives or otherwise; all these things present in spades at North Halsted's 5 year old hot spot Piccolo Sogno. Translated as ""Little Dream"" and without doubt a work of passion from the kitchen to the front of the house the first thing one notices at Piccolo Sogno is just how friendly everyone is - smiles abound, chairs are pulled out for ladies, and whether they are real or not the Italian accents are thick and never cheesy.  Seated quickly next to a table well heeled socialites happy to pay corkage on a duo of vintage Barolos even at lunch it was mere moments before I was greeted by my server, Gabriel, with a bread basket to go with olive oil and balsamic already on the table and working through the soft pillows of focaccia as I made my decisions it would not be long before my order was placed and even less time before the first of four courses arrived; the wood fired Margherita crisp and lightly charred, but unfortunately a bit bland with far less basil or acid than I'd have preferred - a flaw leading me to only eat 2 slices, something my server noted after I declined to have the rest boxed up to go home, with the item subsequently removed from my bill. Moving on to better things, paste and secondi followed next with each showing far more attention to seasoning than the pie, first the small pillows of tender green pasta interspersed with intensely sweet tomatoes, hefty notes of garlic, plus tableside shavings of slowly melting pecorino and then the rich, crispy duck over tender spinach finding balance in a sea of earthy mushrooms and sea salt brightened up with aged balsamic. With an Americano offered on the house as I perused the dessert menu it would not be long before I rejected my server's suggestion of tiramisu in favor of a puff pastry tower sandwiching vanilla custard and with the pastry baked to order with the cream added a la minute I'll simply say that anyone who goes to Piccolo Sogno and doesn't order this is making a huge mistake as it is every bit as good as the Mille Feuille at Au Cheval and therefore nearly as good as those throughout Paris - a truly exemplary dessert whose shattering layers caught the attention of the ladies to my left and a table of four just behind them - both placing their orders shortly thereafter and, judging by their ""oohs and aahs,"" further cementing my sentiments above that this, by itself, is a reason to put Piccolo Sogno on the short list.",0.995,0.855,0.117,0.028,0.43967248598396136

Effraim, our waiter, was excellent...knowledgeable and attentive - there was always the right amount of attention paid to our table without the staff being intrusive - great balance with their service!  The noise level is appropriate for robust conversation or quiet dining.   We were served another complimentary item from the menu for dessert, an order of their biscotti - they were so good, we ordered a second, along with their ricotta cheesecake and berries.  They were both the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.  We are already planning our next visit to Piccolo Sogno so we can experience their patio - and I'm so looking forward to it!",0.9988,0.773,0.227,0.0,0.6380119047619048

2013-07-19,4.0,"Came here on a Saturday night with another couple and had a fabulous time. We had reservations for 8:30pm but since we requested outdoor seating, we had to wait another half an hour to get seated outside. It was kind of annoying but we saw how packed it was and the whole world wanted to enjoy their remarkable outdoor patio. It is like a fairy tale, I mean absolutely beautiful, covered with trees, hanging lights, wooden floors, it's just remarkable. I wasn't sure where it felt like but definitely not Chicago, it was so unique and the patio itself gets 3 stars from me. Plus, the weather was the perfect 70 degree so it wasn't cold nor hot, we could have sat there for hours. Our server approached us right away and got us a bottle of wine to split with our friends. It was pretty average but it got us tipsy so no complaints there. Now here is the food that we ordered and shared that night: -The Calamari frite-served in a paper artichoke, it was tasty but I wish it had some kind of marinara sauce with it, since it just had a lemon slice. A tad on the bland side. -The Prosciutto with melon-very tasty and fresh, was a nice touch to add on top of our pizza. Definitely a great sharing item.  -The funghi misti pizza-Mixed mushrooms, herbs, fresh mozzarella, truffle oil. It was okay, not the best I've had. Davanti Enoteca definitely makes it better.  -Ravioli Piccolo Sogno-Four cheese ravioli, pine nuts, butter, Marsala glaze, parmesan curls. My favorite dish of the night, some of the best ravioli I've had in this city.  -Gnocchi d' estate-Spinach and potato gnocchi, mixed tomatoes, toasted garlic and spinach. My husband ordered this and it was very delicious, I had to steal some to try and I thought it was very tasty. Our friends also got the stewed rabbit which seemed to be okay. Overall I think Piccolo is the place to get your pasta dishes, that's where they really shined. Oh and for dessert we got the panna cotta with berries and caramel sauce, super tasty and we gobbled it right down despite the fact that we were full. I feel that the food was pretty good, not the best Italian in Chicago in our opinion but that outdoor patio just brings it to another level. I would come back just for that patio since it left such a great impression on us. A great celebratory place.",0.9985,0.684,0.249,0.067,0.5764787361485476

If I was reviewing just based on the recent time, I'd give it a two but averaging my experiences puts the restaurant at a solid three perhaps more like 3.3. I ordered the insalata mista, the burrata, a prosciutto pizza and the four cheese pasta. The insalata mista tasted under dressed and poorly dressed. The only saving grace was the balsamic that sits on every table which rescued the salad. The burrata was alright. It was very simple. The cheese rested in a prosciutto rapper. I've had better preparations but this was  alright. The prosciutto pizza was my favorite dish and was on the whole pretty good. Finally, the four cheese ravioli was bland and under seasoned. It had a strong buttery flavor which contrasted poorly with the cheese in the ravioli.  The service was awful. I usually am a pretty large tipper but this guy received around 12%. Not only was the kitchen extremely slow but our waiter was very inattentive. While the food was taking forever, it took him around 30 minutes to meander over to our table. Once he finally got there and we requested an update on our food, he never came back to give us even the simplest of explanation or apology! A pet peeve of mine is flies and due to the open setup of the restaurant there were a lot of them.  Overall, I've had some good times here but its never been outstanding or wow.

We started out with the Griglia Mista and the Burrata Con Culatello. While the seafood salad was light the mozzarella was rich and decadent and probably some of mozzarella I've had. It was a great combination for us to start out with. I got the pasta special of the day which was a ravioli with truffle, mushrooms and cheese. It was very delicious and flavorful. I also tried my dad's Fettucine Con Polpettine, which was excellent! My boyfriend's steak was huge and juicy as well. They even substituted potatoes for him.

But within 30 minutes, it was supremely packed for a Monday night.  We ordered off the Chef week menu, which was great because they were the same portions/sizes as the regular menu. We ordered  grilled calamari - love the grilled flavor and not over done oxtail - sauce was great, especially with the bread stewed rabbit - absolutely loved this dish. Everything worked together and very savory noodles with wild boar ragu - deliciously homemade noodles! It wasn't a huge portion, but still very meaty. gelato - delicious, but the boy thought it was hard discerning the pistachio taste. He didn't know what it was and guessed that it was green tea. LOL.  panna cotta - did not like this dish whatsoever. It tasted like water.  All together with a bottle of wine, it was about $140-160 for the both of us. I would have given this place 5 stars if it weren't for the panna cotta and the service. When I arrived, I hadn't even taken my coat off until the server pounced on us and asked us what we wanted to drink. ""Uh, just water."" Then he came back with the water and asked if we knew what we wanted. ""We haven't touched the menus yet."" I can understand if we're the first table at a new restaurant, but come on. Common sense should tell you to wait until a couple takes off their coat and actually bring the menu in front of them before asking what they would like.

2013-03-06,3.0,"I was really excited to try this place and scratch it off of my Must-Do in Chicago Dining list. I was pretty disappointed. My fiance and I came here for Valentine's dinner and was immediately displeased when we had to wait 15 minutes for our 10PM reservation, which we arrived 30 min early for. FYI, half of the restaurant was already empty. They sit my very tall bf and myself into the smallest corner table, literally inches from two other tables. I could smell the people next to me and hear every word spoken. I was pretty uncomfortable from the start. The main dining room was seemed nice but just wayyy too crowded. I think someone dropped a plate or two simply from not having room. If you are claustrophobic, I'd suggest you go elsewhere. We ordered a pinot (which they ran out of) and had to order another. That's ok. Understandable. It's V-day after all. The server was pretty nice and I had very few issues with him until the end. We then ordered the grigla mista, consisting of octopus, shrimp and calamari to start. This was completely tasteless. I've had MUCH better calamari, shrimp and octopus in a number of other places throughout the city. My boo ordered the pappardelle con cinghiale (wild boar ragu pasta) and I had the Stracci di faro because I'm a sucker for truffle. He said mine was way better than his. We finished the night with the hazelnut dessert and that was the absolute best part of the night. The majority of this 3 star review is dedicated to that dessert. God bless that dessert. At the end of the night, I wasn't feeling too well and really wanted to leave. The waiter was no where to be found. We had to contact another waiter to call our waiter. Even then, we were waiting about 15 min with no sign of him. He finally got us on our way and the restaurant gave me a rose for V-day. Nice touch but a little too late. I just wasn't satisfied.  I found the food here to be in line with Italian comfort food more than anything else, which is cool but not really up my alley. What I did like is that they offer half-size portions which we did because we wanted to enjoy different things.  Living in Chicago really spoils you with great food. Maybe I picked the wrong dishes, but I used yelp and foursquare to base my selections on what I thought I'd like. Maybe this is a better seafood place. Or maybe I just need to go in the summer and see the patio everyone raves about. Either way, I don't see myself eating here again.",0.9935,0.791,0.149,0.06,0.5986031746031746

It was over cooked and burnt at the grill marks. I love grilled calamari, but not there strongest. The lentil soup was amazing. For dinner I got a risotto with a creamy saffron sauce and mussels. It was very undercooked. Risotto should be slightly soupy and this looked like a pile of rice surrounded by mussels. The sauce was soo good though I did not want to complain.

2013-02-05,3.0,"My boyfriend and I made a reservation here for restaurant week 2013, and we were really disappointed with our choice as we only had one good dish and we had our order forgotten by the staff. For the first course, we chose the coda alla vaccinara (Roman style braised oxtail stewed with aromatic vegetables) and the la ribollita ""da delfina"" (twice cooked bread and vegetable soup in the style of Da Delfina in Artimino, Italy). The coda alla vaccinara was the best dish. You don't need to know any more. Skip the rest of my review, if you're set on trying this place out.  I love stews, so the coda alla vaccinara was naturally my favorite. I actually thought that the other items could wow me too, but it was unfortunate that this wasn't the case. The meat fell off the bone. It was very tender. The vegetables had just the right amount of softness. This dish was perfect.  The la ribollita ""da delfina"" surprised me. When I read ""soup,"" I expected something, well, you know, soupy! This dish came out to us flat, like the soup content was pan-fried. It didn't taste bad. It was just unexpected, and the most interesting parts were the  slightly crispy pan-fried parts. Everything else about the ""soup"" was kind of boring.  After the staff cleared our table, we waited for about 10-15 minutes before we inquired about our second course dishes. We suspected that they had forgotten about our order. We had a good time talking, but that wasn't the point. We had finished our first course dishes rather slow, and we were actually expecting them to serve us the second course almost right away since we ate the first course so slowly. The server told us that it'd be another two minutes when he asked the kitchen for us. Strange, but ok, fine.  For our second course, we ordered the pappardelle con cinghiale (wide flat pasta with spiced wild boar ragu) and the merluzzo al forno (baked East Coast cod wrapped in pancetta, stewed cannellini beans, escarole, garlic and lemon). Of the two, I liked the pappardelle con cinghiale more but it wasn't anything special. A lot of people on Yelp liked the wild boar ragu, but it wasn't very special to me. I liked the wide flat pasta. That was my favorite part of the dish.  The cod wrapped in pancetta in the merluzzo al forno was delicious, and so were the escarole--braised and it still retained its crunch. The cannellini beans were a little undercooked. This dish would have been delicious had it not been for the undercooked beans. It was for this reason that I like the pappardelle con cinghiale more. Finally, for our third course, we ordered the panna cotta al zafferano (eggless vanilla, saffron and honey scented custard with caramel sauce and berries) and the mille foglie (""thousand layers"" of crispy pastry dough layered with vanilla custard and chocolate chips). The honey and caramel flavors in the panna cotta were a little too strong, but it was otherwise delicious. I can see why my boyfriend's favorite dessert is the panna cotta. I liked the mille foglie a little more, as it was crispy and flakey, almost like a (much) lighter pie crust, and the custard was good, not too overpowering in any one flavor. I like that the restaurant participated in Restaurant Week because I got to try it out, but unfortunately I don't think I will be returning.",0.9974,0.804,0.154,0.041,0.5567519545131485

2013-01-03,3.0,"Every year I look forward to my birthday.  I LOVE birthdays.  My birthday, friend's birthdays, your birthday... your birthday is the ONE day a year that you can be a narcissistic bitch and it's completely OK.  For me, there is added excitement, as I get to create a list of a minimum of 4 restaurants that I want to dine at for my birthday and the SO will take me.  Price, location, and atmosphere do not matter - it's about me, and I win forever. Out of the five restaurants I chose this year, Piccolo Sogno emerged as the Chosen One.  Based on friend's reviews and my old trusties on Yelp, I could not have been more excited to finally try this place.  Birthday magic would be mine. There was some good, and there was some bad, and just some downright disappointing; needless to say, the magic went awry pretty quickly and things just never really got any better. Within a minute of sitting down we had a food menu and wine list in hand.  A minute or so later, our waiter asked us for our drink order.  Bit quick, considering there are hundreds to choose from in this book.  He disappeared for quite a while before reappearing, and the overall time to get out bottle was a bit lengthy.  Oh well, my bottle of #515 Chianti was delicious. But onto the food.  For me, Piccolo Sogno was a winner here.  The bread and breadstick basket is a key to my dining happiness and had enough variety to keep me satisfied.  My insalata di pere came out quickly and was delicious, but it certainly did not hold a candle to the cecina fritta.  Chickpea fries covered in parmesan?  Slap my ass and make out with me... that shit was out of this world!  For my main entree, it was recommended I choose the salmon over the gnocchi (two total opposites, I know, but both sounded great) and, although it was a bit more mustard-y than I hoped for (this is my fault), it tasted great otherwise and I finished every last bit.  I subbed the asparagus for broccolini without any issue. But Piccolo Sogno got a serious no-prize for their slow service.  The appetizers came out super quick, which was nice, but we were a bit confused when the table next to us, who came in about 20 minutes later, had their entrees served before us.  In a non-discreet way, several waiters (and other staff?) gathered next to our table, spoke quickly in Italian, and, when they broke up, our waiter told us our food would be out shortly.  I am not fluent in Italian, but I can read expressions, and, essentially, they forgot to put our order in.  I was in no rush, and certainly do not mind wine and conversation with wonderful company, but it would have been nice had they said they made a mistake and subsequently comped an appetizer, another glass of wine... SOMETHING.  I am positive it had a negative effect on the SO's perception of the seafood risotto (on special).  It's the little things, especially when you're dropping over $100 on dinner. Maybe when they're on their A-game or the patio is open it's a better experience, but overall this was more subpar than on par.  It kills me because I had such a great list this year.",0.991,0.789,0.143,0.068,0.5291458961913508

Had to make reservations about 15 days before the D-day and promptly received calls for reminding us of the reservation. The attire is dressy but they won't turn you away if you're casually dressed. The complimentary bread was addictive!

2012-12-22,3.0,"My wife and I finally made it to Piccolo Sogno (Italian for little dream) for our first time; I had heard a lot about this venue from peers and had really looked forward to our meal. While the food and overall experience were decent, I am afraid it fell short of expectations and for me was just not a special or upscale experience. Certainly not bad by any means, but I have enjoyed other Italian venues in the city at equal or even a lower price point (Balena would be my top pick in this range).  Piccolo Sogno has a nice space with exposed brick walls, white linen table clothes and dark lighting to set the mood (though makes reading the menu - especially the wine list - a bit of a challenge). For warmer months there is a nice outdoor space. There is a small parking lot ($6 fee) and the Halsted bus will drop you within a stone's throw. The biggest negative ambiance wise is the tables (especially the two tops) are ""fun sized"" and spaced very close together; this definitely detracts from an otherwise upscale, romantic ambiance and at times it was hard to maneuver because table space was at more of a premium than land in Manhattan.  Service was generally positive; not the most attentive and friendly service I have experienced by any means, but no complaints. We were not pushed to over order when we asked for advice on how much to order, pacing was adequate, and silverware was replaced after each course. Perhaps the only knock on service was it seemed as though the busboy would start hovering as we would be nearing the end of each course and would swoop in like a vulture the split second we scooped up the last full bite.  Piccolo Sogno has a full bar and a vast wine list with most wines falling in the $8 to $12 range (per glass) or $30 to $70 range (for the bottle). As I am not very familiar with Italian wines I opted for one of the lesser priced Pinot Nero (Italian for Pinot Noir) - our choice of wines when dining out and ordering by-the-bottle as it tends to pair well with most foods. While it was nice so many wines were inexpensive, unfortunately the wine tasted just that - inexpensive with a coppery aftertaste. If you are not familiar with wines it may be best to order by the glass so you do not put all your eggs in one basket.  The food was the biggest disappointment of the night. Based on feedback I had received I was expecting my meal to rival the best Italian venues I have frequented and it was no better (perhaps even a step below) chain venues such as Mia Francescas and Maggianos. For my appetizer I had the Griglia Mista (grilled calamari, shrimp and octopus with arugula and caper & lemon infused olive oil). This was not a good start; the octopus was overcooked (it had a bit of a rubbery texture and was not at all tender as properly cooked octopus should be) and surprisingly had a fishy aftertaste (I had not previously experienced that with octopus); the calamari was bland with the shrimp being the only tasty portion of the first course. There was a bread basket with breadsticks and two different breads and olive oil already tableside; the bread was decent, but nothing to write home about. We were rather starving and the basket was automatically replenished when it was low.  Next my wife and I split a pasta (one of the specials of the day); the pasta featured mushrooms, shaved black truffle, parmesan and ricotta cheeses. The pasta was well cooked and this dish was the star of the night; great balance of flavors with nothing overpowering the other components. My entree was the half roasted duck with fennel sausage and faro polenta. While the polenta was pleasing, the duck unfortunately was edible, but fair at best - dry, overcooked and lacking in flavor.  Portions were on the generous side and as we were pleasantly full we opted to skip dessert as nothing was jumping out at us and we were at this point a bit underwhelmed with the overall meal. Our total bill (including tax and gratuity) came to $140 for the aforementioned food, a pizza (consumed by my wife as her entree) and the $36 bottle of wine.  Had I not been looking so forward to this dinner I likely would have left feeling better than I did, but since I had such lofty expectations that were not met I sadly left Piccolo Sogno let down. This is by no means a bad venue, but in my opinion it is a fair venue that has been unreasonably hyped up as being among Chicago's best Italian cuisine - I do not recommend avoiding Piccolo Sogno, but would advise tempering one's expectations.",0.9977,0.791,0.144,0.065,0.48762065294323337

They then sat us at a table that we didn't prefer and they quickly and happily re-sat us -- this is usually not the case with snobby hostesses, so...bonus! Our server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, but respected our space and didn't try to rush us out on a Friday night. MUST HAVE: Gnocchi: pillowy, delectable. Parpardelle: melt-in-your-mouth pasta with wild boar ragu. The flavor is incredible. We had a chocolate lava cake with hazelnut gelato for dessert. The gelatos are out of this world, would have been happy with just a few scoops of that! Chef Tony is adorable and friendly. He came out to say hi and ask how everything was going. He found out that my friend and I were reuniting from our days of being 3rd graders and he treated us to two glasses of prosecco. Class act, Tony! Will 100 percent be back.

2012-12-17,5.0,"I may be a little bit biased because on my very first visit to Piccolo Sogno last night...I also happened to get engaged!!  But to be fair, my boyfriend...excuse me, my fiance...and I had already declared our dinner a 5 star experience well before I had any clue what was really going on.  I will try to focus just on the dining experience and leave my emotions out of it. We had a 7pm reservation last night and were seated immediately at a lovely table near the window where we were facing everyone, but no one was facing us (I found out later that this table was already pre-arranged with the restaurant prior to our arrival).  Our waitress was very friendly and rather than pick our wines ourselves, we explained to her what food items we were both thinking about ordering and she made excellent recommendations and gave each of us the perfect pairings.  A basket assortment of fresh bread was brought out and the olive oil and aged balsamic was at the table for use. They were happy to do an appetizer portion from their daily specials menu, and we started with their risotto of the day, which was a rich and elegant mix of wild mushrooms and truffle oil.  The risotto was perfect - smooth and creamy, full of flavor, the porcini broth brought out the truffled flavor and we added just a little bit of freshly grated parmesan.  The appetizer portion was huge (quite honestly, I would have considered it an entree size) but luckily the risotto somehow managed to be full of flavor and delicious...without being heavy or overbearing and allowed us to still be hungry for our entrees. For our entrees, I went with the Spaghetti Neri seafood pasta dish and my fiance chose the wild boar pasta.  Both were highly recommended on yelp and we went with it.  My entree was perfect - the black spaghetti had a heartier texture and flavor that carried the red pepper and stronger seafood flavoring very well.  It somehow makes for a nicer blend of all the ingredients.  The seafood was very fresh and tasty, without any type of over seafoody taste or aroma.  The mussels were smaller and less overpowering, the calamari was perfect, and the shrimp were large and cooked perfectly.  The tomatoes and sauce blended perfectly with the red pepper flakes, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.   I only tried a noodle of the wild boar dish, but it tasted fantastic.  A heartier and stronger flavor to it, but it seemed to work very well with the boar - which my fiance enjoyed immensely. Great portion sizes for the entrees - I ended up taking half of my dish home and he finished just about all of us, but not completely.  For food this delicious and well prepared with such high quality, the prices are very reasonable and the portions are pretty generous. The proposal happened during the dessert portion of the evening, and while I will keep the mushy details to myself, and not give out his trade secrets on how he did it, I will say that the restaurant was involved to a degree, our waitress was involved, and they helped make everything perfect and just as he had intended.  They played their parts well and also managed to keep it private and intimate for us, without causing a scene or doing anything to take away from our moment.  Before leaving, the manager brought out a dessert plate with the word ""Congratulations"" written along the frame in chocolate and also came by to give us a genuine congratulations and shake my fiance's hand.  It was a nice touch without being cheesy. Even if last night's visit to Piccolo hadn't been such a momentous occasion, I have no doubt I still would have been blown away by the food, service, and ambiance and every one of these stars would still be deserved.  We'll be back...not just because it's now a special place for us...but because the food is just so freaking good!",0.9994,0.758,0.219,0.024,0.5796813725490195

2012-12-01,3.0,"It was Friday night & me and a few friends wanted to get a good dinner. We made an attempt to go to La Scarola, which we all love, but they were jam packed. So we walked across the street to Piccolo Sogno. I had read reviews and I was interested in trying it.  My overall experience was good. It was crowded, but we were seated within 10 minutes. The staff was very nice and accommodating. The waiter asked about food allergies, which was awesome because two people at our table did have some. He made sure the dishes that we were being served were allergen free.  To start we ordered the fried calamari. It was good and very tender. Not chewy at all. We also ordered an antipasti appetizer. It was OK.  My friend ordered the Funghi Misti pizza. Good, but the truffle oil was a bit over powering. One of my friends wanted the duck, but they were out of it. A few of my friends ordered the pasta dishes. I tried the pasta and wasn't impressed. I ordered the Rosticciana which is braised beef short ribs, polenta, & greens. The ribs were very tender and very good. The polenta was good. I just wish they gave me more than a spoon full. It was kind of a tease.  Then came dessert. I don't remember the name, but it was a flaky layered pastry with custard & chocolate chips topped with powdered sugar. That was the biggest disappointment. When I do decide to splurge on dessert I really want it to be yummy. This just sucked. All my friends thought it sucked too. We just didn't get it. The waiter was nice & offered us a different dessert, but we said no because everyone was pretty full at that point. I think he took it off the bill, but I'm not positive.  Overall I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but I wouldn't be anti going back if someone I knew wanted to go. Last note: The bathrooms by the bar were gross. You would think that a nice restaurant would remodel their bathrooms. That was definitely a disappointment!",0.9963,0.699,0.222,0.079,0.5102975702975704
2012-11-30,3.0,"Ehhh kind of just a B for me this time Piccolo....ordered the Griglia Mista and it was flavorless and chewy as all get out.  You know its a bad sign when you use up your entire bottle of balsamic vinegar they provided by dumping vinegar all over your food to provide SOME semblance of flavor...All i got was grill marks and arugula, and chewiness. Other bore came with the rib eye entree - guess who else showed up, the famous arugula again.  3/5 of our orders had a crap load of arugula, and I like arugula as much as the next person, but could we get a little more creative with the garnish or side items please?  A big ass rib eye deserves a veggie.  I get the hole concept, pairing the heavy rib eye with a light side salad, but I was totally underwhelmed. ...without your awesome summer patio, and instead sitting in that craptastic back room with ancient wallpaper and close proximity to the ever-constant swinging kitchen door, the lackluster food was nothing to write home about.  Oh by the way, if i see another stupid molten chocolate cake on a menu I'm going to freak out...haven't we seen enough of that?

The servers, especially Arturo did an outstanding job.  They were so attentive and you can tell they took pride in their work, which was taking care of their patrons.  So rare to find.  They knew their menu and described the items we inquired about perfectly.  Interested in wine?  Well they have their own wine expert that will guide you and offer you some suggestions based on what you have ordered.  Love it.  There was another gentleman there walking around and talking about these truffles they had in house.  Who needs entertainment, when the staff was entertaining enough.   Guys, if you want to take a special lady there, you have to take her here.  Its sexy, a bit pricey, but she will love you long time for it.  This venue is perfect for a dinner meeting, girls or guys night out.  Its just fun and a hip place to go.  What are you waiting for, make that reso.  They will not disappoint you.",0.9984,0.77,0.23,0.0,0.6282076719576719
2012-11-17,1.0,The food was good overall but i feel we were ripped off with the truffles.

2012-11-04,5.0,"I've been meaning to check out Piccolo Sogno ever since I moved to Chicago; during the half of the year when the place opens up its supposedly breathtaking outdoor seating, getting a table here can be as challenging as at most Randolph street establishments. Let me be the first to say it's worth coming here in November too.  The theme here is classic Italian, high quality ingredients, no frills. Pear salad and beet salad ($9) are both minimalist, sparsely dressed, yet superlative takes on classics; the arugula and goat cheese involved in both salads are both sublime. Antipasti platter (MP) is truly a smorgasbord, with prosciutto, Pecorino, and a melange of chilled mixed grilled vegetables. It's a little bland and devoid of focus, however; probably my personal low point. Griglia Mista ($14) is a much better antipasto, with a mixture of grilled octopus, calamari, and shrimp. All of the above are fine and good, but at least judging by this visit, Piccolo Sogno shines with its pasta. Frutti di Mare ($21 full portion) is made with squid ink blackened spaghetti, a well-balanced, spicy rich marinara, and perfectly cooked clams, mussels, and calamari. This was one of the best dishes I've had all year, bar none. Gnocchi di Autunno ($16 full portion) is no slouch in its own right - spinach and potato gnocchi are impossibly tender, and the accompanying melange of butternut squash and roasted mushrooms is as thoroughly autumnal as a fourth quarter Northwestern football choke job (but far more pleasurable). Whole branzino (MP) is roasted in salt, which gives the fish an impossibly moist texture; too often when one orders whitefish out, it's overcooked, but this is perfect. Braised short rib ($25) is served in a classic style, cooked low and slow for hours with a vaguely dessert-y mixture of spices on top of a mound of mashed butternut squash. Dessert list all looked good; we went with the biscotti ($8), a mixture of chocolate and hazelnut, only very lightly sweet.  The meal is served at a slow pace (though we did have four courses, which augmented this), which adds to the Italian authenticity. Pricing is high, but you can share as we did and try a lot of the menu for less money. All in all, it's a good thing that this place has more going for it than its outdoor space, which is only good about four months out of the year in these parts.

2012-10-07,4.0,"I walk in to Piccolo Sogno to confirm my OpenTable reservation and am instantly referred to as ""Bella"", so I know these guys OBVIOUSLY know what they're talking about.   The host walks us out onto the patio, which is the main reason we chose Piccolo Sogno for dinner (I'm all about outdoor dining!), and it did not disappoint.  We step out from the dining room, onto the wood deck, and I am so glad this is where we choose to eat on this beautiful Chicago night.  I subconsciously give myself a pat on the back.  Trees, dressed with white lights, sprout up through and around the deck.  The ambiance is beautiful and romantic.  I'm only kicking myself for waiting so long to dine here.   We're seated and an Italian gentleman greets us.  As I look around, it appears that all of the servers here are Italian.  We start off with a couple glasses of wine, along with some of their delicious - can't stop reaching for more - Italian breads, which we smother in olive oil & Parmesan, as we browse the menu.  Our dinner went as follows (feel free to copy, I eat well):  *Insalata Di Pere ($9).   Delicate baby arugula lightly dressed with lemon oil, garnished with Capriole Farm goat cheese, over Chianti poached pears.  Yum.  Light and refreshing.  A perfectly delectable start to our meal. *Sformato Di Zucca ($10).   A local squash flan, atop a parmesan cream sauce.  Squash FLAN?!  I know, it sounds odd, but it's delightful.  Plus, how many times do you get a caprese salad or calamari from an Italian restaurant?  Live a little, you'll be glad you did when you taste it's creamy goodness. *Spaghetti Neri ""Frutti Di Mare"" ($19).   This pasta dish is made with string cut black spaghetti, which is a squid ink pasta, yum!  I know squid ink doesn't sound like the most appetizing thing, which is probably why they don't put that in the description, but I hunt out Italian places for this type of pasta, so give it a shot!  The squid ink deliciousness is tossed with a sauce of San Marzano tomatoes and red pepper flakes.  Mixed throughout are clams, shrimp, calamari, and then the dish is surrounded by mussels.  I'm a sucker for seafood pastas. *Coniglio All' Agro ($23). This dish is a slow stewed rabbit, cooked to perfection, with white wine, lemon, and rosemary.  The light and moist meat had my inner foodie applauding the choice of rabbit for dinner. The reason for the 4 star rating, rather than 5, is because aside from the great food and ambiance, the servers seemed a little weeded and less attentive than I had hoped.  Secondly, the tables seemed to be close enough for our neighboring table to eavesdrop on our conversation, or vise versa (Which, let's be honest, I did! Her dad like totally doesn't hate him!).  And finally, our first glass of wine had a lipstick stain on the glass, which I know from working in a restaurant, that the glasses are not scrubbed, but rather put through a hot bath and steam.  But hey, we're not too finicky!  We just requested a new glass, so problem solved.  As long as we're taken care of and served good food, we won't complain. Aside from that, I still cannot wait to go back to Piccolo Sogno.  I'm excited to try out more of their dishes that grabbed my eye and had me debating my choices for a good half hour.  As much as I do want to go back, it may not be until the weather is warm again, because the main attraction here is the alluring patio.  If you live in Chicago, or plan on visiting, treat yourself to a gratifying meal, out on an exquisite patio.  You deserve it. ;)",0.998,0.809,0.158,0.032,0.5157792207792208
2012-10-05,2.0,"Meh. We made reservations for a birthday dinner. We got to the restaurant early and had a drink. About 3 bartenders behind the bar talking loudly and ignoring us. Finally received drinks and bartenders simply carried on their personal conversation loudly as if we weren't there. A bit disturbing. We told the hostess we would sit the bar for a while because we were there 1/2 an hour early and we ended up sitting there for about 45 minutes. Finally my husband went up to the hostess and said we'd like to be seated. So we were: right next to the kitchen. I got up and asked the hostess if we could be moved, it was a special occasion, we'd made a reservation, etc. and she said she would try. Ended up getting a four seat table a little farther back. The place was packed on a Thursday and they did the best they could. It was much better than the first table.  We had buratta and fried calamari. My husband had a rabbit entree and I had a crab filled ravioli special. The buratta was fresh but kind of tasteless. The calamari was ok but nothing great. My ravioli was kind of meh and just didn't have any kind of special flavor or wasn't particularly savory. My husband liked his rabbit. They did give us free biscotti and a chocolate/hazelnut molten cake for the birthday. Which was nice.  The room is very bustling and it's not a great place to talk. There are MANY badly placed tables and only a few nice ones. The front of the room is nicer than the back and I'd ask for a table by the front windows if you must sit inside. I have a feeling that many people just 'pop' in here for an Italian meal during the week! Which the price point doesn't suggest to me. The waitstaff were all around and loud and talking to each other around our tables as if we weren't there. I got the feeling that they really didn't care if we were there at all. Our waitress was kind but indifferent. Not really the special night we had planned. We won't be back, simply because we didn't think the food was that great, the service wasn't really caring, warm, or discreet, and the whole place seemed to be too rocking for a nice evening out.  We prefer to go to La Luce on Lake/Ogden and may go there to have the experience we didn't receive at Piccolo Sogno.",0.9152,0.814,0.11,0.076,0.5562554112554113

The food was excellent, and if you are frugal like me, you can still have a nice meal without breaking the bank if you order wisely. My husband and I shared fresh bread and olive oil (complimentary), the panzanella salad, the carpaccio, the ravioli, and the salametti e cippola pizza which was plenty of food. All were delicious and my husband thought the pizza was the best he had ever had.   The only negative aspect were the hostesses.

I think we got one of the best seats in the house because they put us next to this lovely lit up garden that smelled absolutely amazing.   We started by ordering the chickpea flour fries. The food runner looked like he crawled straight out of an italian movie, with his Luigi-like mustache and thick italian accent. Love. The chickpea fries, though--I thought they were okay. A bit salty. I think they needed to be balanced with a dipping sauce. Maybe some tomato or some sort of cream sauce. Add rosemary? I would definitely change that recipe.  For my meal I ordered the spaghetti neri frutti di mare. Translation: black homemade pasta (it's squid ink) with shellfish. I finished my plate. My date got the homemade spinach and potato gnocci. Wowwwww...his was so delicious. I mean, crazy good and fresh pasta tasting. I really wish I had his dish instead, to be honest. Best gnocci I have ever had.  We decided to get desert and I really wanted tiramisu. But I was shocked that they didn't have it on their menu. Nor did they have canoli's. Is that too cliche? I don't get that. It really would have topped off the meal but we settled with the flan. And it was just okay. I could really taste the egg in it.  Piccolo Sogno is absolutely lovely and the food is pretty good.

We had dinner on a cool 70 degree Chicago night. It was gorgeous.  The food then hit. We began with the peach salad which is subpar at most. The highlight is the goat cheese that they used. The peaches didn't taste special. It should be the highlight of the dish, but nothing memorable.  We then shared two appetizer portions of the black truffle ravioli and black spaghetti. The black truffle was not great. Just because a restaurant uses truffles doesn't elevate the dish, you still have to execute the recipe. However, the black spaghetti was amazing! The sauce and seafood was so amazing! We then split the grilled steak with arugula and grape Tomatoes. This was ok, not amazing and worth $29.  We then finished off with the hazelnut chocolate cake which was fantastic!  It was a great way to end a decent meal.

2012-06-29,5.0,"My wife & I make Piccolo Sogno our ""wedding anniversary celebration"" restaurant every year...and we're never sorry. The food is ALWAYS spectacular. We went on the most perfect day in Chicago EVER. It was a Monday, the temp was about 71º, and we got there early enough to sit outside on the patio. It was perfect. Typically we go to PS in December, as that's when we got married; so this was our first outdoor eating experience. We despise the heat/humidity, so I was a little apprehensive about eating outdoors, but the conditions were perfect this time. We ordered an appetizer to share; the grilled antipasto salad which included beets, asparagus, zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant; excellent prosciutto, sharp aged cheese, and a chick pea/white bean mix that normally I don't go for but was excellent.  Main course: ravioli Piccolo Sogno, my wife's favorite that she orders every time. And with good reason, it NEVER disappoints. I ordered the chicken this time, with rapini, broccolini (I think) and lemon. It was a flattened cornish hen. Taste was awesome. Typically I order a pasta dish, but felt like fowl. Taste was awesome. I should mention the bread basket with 2 different kinds of bread and the best breadsticks I've had anywhere. If you're expecting ""Olive Garden""-style breadsticks, do NOT go to PS. This is real, actual Italian food. You'll see when you get there. I come from a half-Italian family, so I KNOW what good Italian food tastes like (my great grandmother was born/raised in Italy). Piccolo Sogno is the GOODS. From that bread basket to the thick balsamic vinegar on the table to the menu...it's worth every penny. For dessert, my wife ordered a limoncello. It's the real deal, and terrific. I was too full for dessert.  The service: spectacular. At our previous visit for our anniversary, we needed a day away from our young son...and sure enough, about 15 minutes in to our evening the staff seated a young yuppie family with 2 complaining girls our son's age RIGHT NEXT TO US. We hemmed/hawed, but finally did ask to be moved. The staff was great, they accommodated us & moved us to a different part of the restaurant that was child-less...was more busy, but we didn't have to put up with poor parenting & fussy kids. We'd put ""it's our anniversary"" on our OpenTable reservation, but for whatever reason the host/hostess didn't think to keep a potentially loud family with bratty kids away from a dressed-to-the-nines couple there celebrating an anniversary. ProTip: I know it's not always possible, but do try to find a sitter once in awhile, and also don't bring your kids to a nice, expensive restaurant.  I digress...this visit, in the summer, was perfect. Again the staff was great, the food was outstanding, and we will be back. The food has never disappointed. The bill can be pricey if you're not careful, so we go maximum once per year (with this exception, as we were celebrating something else this week). The location can be tough to find if you don't know the city well, but we've been there enough now to know where to go.  Highly recommend this establishment. You really can't go wrong. I'd say get there early; when we got there around 5pm (our preferred eating time), there were 2-3 other tables full outside; by 6pm it was nearly full, and after 7pm it was maxed out on the patio.  We'll be back, for sure, no question.",0.999,0.78,0.193,0.027,0.5855501195912155

Followed by splitting the mediterranean sea bass, it's not on the menu but it's their signature dish.

For entrees, I had the rabbit, which was a tad overcooked. Several people around me had ordered the special, a truffle pasta, and the smells were making me drool. From the look of it, the truffle pieces were pretty small -- not shavings so much as dots -- but there was a good amount in there. The pizza also looked very good. We also had a couple of desserts to share over coffee -- the mille foglie and something else chocolatey -- they were good, if pretty standard. The only thing I didn't love was that they didn't know who had ordered which dish, so we kept having to direct them to the right people each time they showed up with food. Since we were sitting in the same places all night, it seems like they could have made a note of who ordered what.

Somehow the gods were with us,  because we were able to get a reservation for 9 people on a Friday night. We arrived and we had to wait a little, so we had drinks at the bar. We got seated not in the big room, but a little side room next to the patio. My only criticism is that the room was so dark, we all pulled out our smart phones and installed the flashlight app, so that we could read the menu. But once we ordered, the darkness only lit by candlelight actually created a very cozy atmosphere. Although everybody liked their food, I can only speak to what I ordered. I had the beet salad, which was mixed with citrus segments. It was so yummy that I tried to copy it at home the next week. As Main course I had the milk braised pork shank and wow that was delicious (yes, I know - I used delicious - Bobby Flay would call me out on that). The meat was so succulent and tender I was able to pull it off the bone with my fork. I think the greens on the side were Kale, which can be hit or miss, but in this case it was a big hit and went perfectly with the meat. It was a large portion and luckily I applied the Martina Navratilova style (where you cut the portion in half immediately after serving) - otherwise I would have devoured the entire meal because it was so good. Even the next day the other half of my portion was so delicious and the flavors kept very well. There are many great Italian restaurants in the city, but not many of them leave such a great memory.

Heeding the recommendations of others, we started off the meal with the off-the-menu antipasti platter--generous and delicious portions of prosciutto, parmesan-reggiano, olives, and numerous cold roasted vegetables--and washing it down with the fantastic house breads--grissini, foccacia, and Italian baguette. For our mains, we had the Stracci di Farro and Spaghetti Neri. I loved the truffle oil and deep mushroom flavors of the Stracci di Faro, though was less impressed by the pasta triangles, which seemed heavy and doughy like a flat and oversized gnocchi. The black ink spaghetti in the Spaghetti Neri was delightfully chewy and fresh but was milder in squid ink flavor, a flavor that I personally enjoy. The seafood in the pasta was plentiful and good--lots of calamari and shrimp and a few mussels and clams. Finally, for dessert, we shared the house made dark chocolate gelato. While this seemed a little overpriced at $8, I've recently discovered that not every restaurant can pull off in-house gelato, and the smooth and creamy texture was a sweet (wink, wink) ending to our meal, even if it doesn't win the bargain award. Service was quite attentive, almost overboard at times. I don't think my water glass ever went more than a inch from full before it was refilled, and our bread basket was filled without even asking.

Finished with chocolate lava like cake also pretty good. And we got a reasonable bottle of vino. I'd go back but not unless someone else wanted to go.

I want to say I was blown away by Piccolo Sogno and the reality is that if I want to spend that kind of money on Italian food, there are several other options in Chicago that won't disappoint. The menu itself lacks a little pizzazz for me. Of course, I read other people's Yelp reviews before joining my friends for dinner here as I wanted some guidance prior to ordering. There were a number of ""special"" items that people commented on in their reviews and just my luck, none of them were being featured the night I was there.  The wine list is overwhelming and the little direction I received from the server steared me towards one of the more expensive varieties; which if I wasn't sure where to begin that certainly wouldn't have been my starting point but I took the advice I was given and was underwhelmed by the choice. It was rather bland and not very spicy and did not pair well with my bland ravioli with pine nuts in a brown butter sauce.  That's right, bland was the word of the night. Portions left me hungry. How's that possible at an Italian restaurant in Chicago?!?! I pretty much devoured half of my friend's margharetia pizza which wasn't at all special.  To break it down for you. There were four of us. We each had two glasses of wine, two pizzas, one ravioli, and one spaghetti bolognese. The bill came out to $45 per person.  Service was great and the ambiance is delightful.

A very nice wine was recommended (only Italian choices,which was great).  Where they dropped the ball was in the food, at least to my taste.  We started with a grilled seafood appetizer of calamari, octopus and shrimp which was slightly overlooked and was cool by the time we stopped eating it.  This was followed by specials, a pasta with chanterelle mushrooms for my daughter and sea bass for me. The description of both sounded very good.  The pasta had singular flavoring; we expected that it would have the various tastes of the ingredients, but it didn't.  The sea bass was basically mushy and flavorless.

If I was rating the food alone, Piccolo Sogno would certainly receive four stars. The food was not only authentic (which is so difficult to find), but absolutely delicious as well.

Our waiter was very nice, but his Italian accent was so thick I think I only got half of what he said (just the important parts- ""sea bass..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.......prosciutto.."") A little pricey, but reasonable for the relatively generous portions and very unique dishes. Chickpea flour fries: Tastes very similar to polenta fries (such as those at Quartino's), but less dense and grainy. Braised oxtail: Tastes like the braised Chinese-style oxtail that I grew up with. Tender, moist, and a hearty appetizer to get you started on your way to that wild boar. Wild boar Ragu Tagliatelle: Yummmm. Comfort food at its best, even if I'm too unrefined to taste the difference between boar and pork. If I grew up with this stuff, I would be probably be twice as strong and twice as happy. Roasted parsnip and chopped black truffle stuffed pasta: Pretty much a ravioli, the parsnip filling is fairly mediocre, but the black truffle taste and fragrance is extremely strong. Very good considering the price of black truffle oil versus the price of the dish, but can be a little overpowering at times. Fruitti de Mare Spaghetti: Very straightforward sauce + generous helping of shellfish, which is always a favorite. The best part of this dish? The black spaghetti, which has a different texture than the usual and is a famously uncommon dish in the states.

Dinner included a round of fried calamari (better w/o the marinara, imo), a special ravioli (w/ lobster/shrimp/anything-w/-a-shell), a gnocchi invernali, a rare ahi tuna, a puff pastry/custard dessert and a blueberry tart (godalmighty,yes!), and two glasses of jammy/spicy red wine. I'm re-gaining weight just thinking about it.  I had the gnocchi inervali and I LOVED it, except for the gnocchi. But I think I just don't like gnocchi, so that's my own fault! (Doughy potato-pasta balls? Really, Italy?) I've already decided to return in my fat pants and ask for the invernali sauce all over some angle hair pasta.  The blueberry tart reconfirmed my belief in a higher being: imagine everything good about dessert - then douse it with blueberries. And then warm it up. It was on the a specials menu, so let's all start a call-in campaign to get it on the menu through blueberry season. 312-421-0077, go! Our waiter and his slew of helpers were nice. The only really bittersweet moment was when we finally allowed them to take away our calamari - after being asked four times to remove it, we started to feel as if it's customary that some calamari should go back to the kitchen and be reunited with the chef.   Don't pay for parking, just drive around back and park in the loading zone spot. (It's only zoned from 9a-5p, yer welcome.)",0.9621,0.874,0.102,0.024,0.5700680272108843
2011-12-16,3.0,"HI KIDS! I'm back up in the cut! Piccolo Sogno was like the Piccolo without the Sogno, if that makes sense to any of you. Things were just ok fellas. The parking was easier than a Easy-Bake Oven, so that was nice. Our waiter was pretty awesome, he was so into his job. It's like he was getting paid to serve us or something, really on top of things. So the bread and Olive Oil situation is always what i look forward to. I like to call it ""THE MIXTURE"". Again things were just ok. Bread was your standard bread. I was really hoping to sit in the main dining room where all the hustle & bustle was. I like eating in the packed room to soak up the atmosphere and make fun of everyone sitting around me. But my Feline & I were seated in the 2nd smaller colder dining room where we didn't have that many targets to easy drop on. I had some raviolo and my gf had the Orange Chicken with Fried Rice. Both were again just ok. I'd eat there again if i happen to be around the area attending a Volleyball Serving class or something. Or let's say if my 6 year old cousin wanted to go to the new Tractor exhibit nearby.  Actually he doesn't like Tractors that much, so that last sentence would never happen. He is more of a firetruck kind of kid. He likes the horns and the hose and all jive.  My cousin is a great fella.

So like I said, we were a little rushed, etc. just because of our situation.  So I think I would have enjoyed it more if we didnt feel rushed to get there, starving, etc. The service was great.  He explained the menu perfectly, specials, etc.   The food-YUM!  We started with the grilled calamari.  It was perfectly seasoned and grilled.  Also, we did the appetizer portion of the gnocchi because we wanted to try it but didnt want it as a meal.  It was FANTASTIC.  I loved every bite.  There was nothing left on the plate when they cleared the dish!  HA.  Then we did the pork shank and the seafood stew.  Again, both were really good.  By the end, we were both in carb overload, but it was worth it!

The food was just ok.  They don't offer pepper or cheese with the bread and oil and their bread is quite bland.  Definitely skip it unless you are starving...or even if you're starving.  It's that underwhelming.   We started with the Griglia Mixta which was the highlight of the meal.  I liked that it tasted char grilled.  Next we decided to split the Paglia e Fieno con Vitello and the Tagliatelle con Cinghiale.  After ordering, I was a bit concerned that our pastas would be quite similar, one being veal ragu and the other wild boar ragu.  Turns out that they were pretty different, although, they were just ok in the taste department.  Nothing interesting or worth mentioning about either. On a bright note, the servers were very good and our waters were always refilled.  The food actually came out quickly as well, which was nice since I was dying to get out of there before my head exploded.  OK, maybe I need to work on my stress level. On the way out I noticed that they had a table full of delicious looking antipasti.  Didn't see that on the menu but I wish I had.  I might have had a different story to tell.

Fuggedaboutit.  So in efforts to win my boo over to Italian food, we decided to hit up Piccolo Sogno. Upon being sat I instantly regretted sitting inside instead of outside. The outdoor eating area at Piccolo Sogno looked beautiful. Inside things were still hopping as evidenced by the woman at the table next to us who was so drunk she not only managed to break the steam on her wine glass, she also almost knocked over a table on the way to the restroom. In the restaurants defense, she looked like one of those Gold Coast cougars who had probably been drinking steadily since 4:30. I really enjoyed my Caprese salad. It tasted very fresh.  I also had the black spaghetti which came with clams, mussels, and shrimp. I don't think I can go back to regular spaghetti. My boo ordered another pasta dish that was also quite tasty. Service was pretty good and the wine list was extensive enough for two non-wine drinkers to find a good bottle that was also reasonably priced. My only real critique of Piccolo Sogno was that the menu seems somewhat limited. I felt like there were maybe only one or two dishes that I would want to try. What I did try was excellent, and it's always better to have a small menu that you do really well. I guess I just wished there were a few more choices. Did I convince my boo that she likes Italian food? Well, it looks like the jury is still out. I'm still searching for that knockout Italian place that will blow my boo away.

We finished the meal with a hazelnut chocolate cake served with hazelnut ice cream.  It was very rich, as expected, and was served piping hot so that the chocolate center was oozing out with every bite.     All in all, I was happy with the experience.  The service was A+, but  I wasn't blown away with the food like I was hoping to be.  I'll give it another shot in the spring when it's nice enough to sit outside on their patio.  I was happy with the price though.  For an appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and a bottle of wine, it was only $100 before tip.  Not too shabby.",0.996,0.812,0.188,0.0,0.5521604938271604

We were lucky to be able to sit on their gorgeous patio, as requested, enjoying every bit of one of the last best nights left in Chicago this season. Why do we live here again? But that's another story...  The patio was definitely the highlight of the meal, but it was somewhat of a roller coaster after that. Our waiter was not very helpful and kept coming back every 30 seconds as we were trying to decide between the prixe fixe with the wine pairing and ordering off the regular menu. Finally, we went with ordering off the menu, because NO pasta dishes were on the prixe fixe and I was in the mood for some pasta.  First of all, our apps arrived before our bottle wine. We ordered them at the same time and they both arrived quickly. Don't get me wrong, we were hungry, but we didn't want to have our nice romantic dinner be over in 35 minutes... Felt a little like a chop shop...  Zucchini blossoms that we got were good, but only 3 little pieces on a plate. Panzanella salad was awfully soggy, especially since I just read in Cooks Illustrated about how NOT to make the bread soggy. Disappointing.  Pasta was definitely an improvement. Their 4 cheese ravioli were pretty yummy, especially pine nuts adding a nice touch. A little too much butter... Their papperdelle with little veal meatballs, raisins and eggplant were pretty damn amazing though! Definitely the best part of the meal.  Good coffee and good panna cotta.  So, 3 stars is all it gets. 4 for the patio and 2-3 for the food. 2-3 for the service. There are much better Italian restaurants in Chicago!",0.9962,0.72,0.225,0.055,0.5633394383394383

My second experience involved an extraordinarily hot evening.  Despite the heat, even the outdoor space (which is the real draw, here; seriously, it's gorgeous) was packed.  That said, there was a wait for our food.  I'm talking 55 minute wait for an order comprised of gnocchi and a pizza.  To bide our time, we ordered the mixed olives, however the olives were terrible, yo'.  As in Nancy Reagan, ""Just say, ""No!"""" The only thing worse to have served us would have, perhaps, been a can of black olives...or a tennis shoe.  Finally, our gnocchi and pizza were at long last served to us without an offer of freshly ground pepper or parmesan.   Oh, and my pasta was bland on account of a dull tomato sauce. In short, I think the service during the cold weather months far surpasses the service in the summer months.  During the former, there are just fewer customers and plates to prepare and I think that the kitchen can focus more on the food, and the waitstaff on the service.  Still, go in the summer for the lovely outdoor seating under the trees strung with cafe lights.  The ambiance may (or may not) distract you from the food.  In the winter, go for a wonderful meal in a cozy setting.",0.6588,0.887,0.062,0.052,0.6256410256410257

2011-07-11,3.0,"My first visit to Piccolo Sogno was both a success and a failure. The food was outstanding, but they simply failed from a service standpoint. We arrived almost exactly on time for our 7:30 pm reservation. The hostess asked us if we wanted an inside or patio table. Considering that 75% or more of their tables are on the patio and it was a beautiful summer evening, we requested the patio. She said all the tables were full and she would let us know when a patio table opened up.  We proceeded to the bar to order a couple of drinks. I tried to order two different glasses of wine and they were out of both! C'mon guys, you not only can't honor a reservation, but your wine list is either incorrect or you have poor inventory management? Fortunately the third wine I asked for they had in stock. My wife ordered a martini, which she enjoyed, but it seemed like a pretty ordinary martini for the $13.50 price tag. After waiting for about 45 min with absolutely no word from our hostess, I went over to the desk and asked when our table would be ready...the hostess almost seemed surprised that we hadn't been seated yet and told us we were next on the list. Gee thanks, I guess having a reservation only entitles you to get on to a second list to be seated. At this point we started our contingency planning to decide on another place to go for dinner, but after almost exactly a 1 hour wait we were finally escorted to a table outside. After so much griping about the horrendous wait, I almost have no energy left to talk about the good stuff...that being the food. I must say the food was amazing.  The special ""truffle gnocchi"" was incredible. The gnocchi was tender and with a light truffle sauce and topped with generous black truffle shavings - a rich, beautiful dish. We actually ordered it as an appetizer  by requesting a 1/2 portion. The shrimp linguini was equally good. A superb tomato sauce with plentiful large shrimp and hand cut linguini. A hefty serving and it looked so good that the couple next to us asked what it was. The margharita pizza was delicious as well. Very thin italian style crust with fresh buffalo mozerella cheese and a light tomato paste.

For my entree, I ordered the stracci di farro and I really enjoyed it. Truffle oil was included in the description and after a bad truffle oil experience I worried about them going overboard. My worries were definitely for nothing because the pasta had the right amount of truffle oil and didn't overwhelm at all.

The restaurant is just classy enough to feel a little special, but not so special you feel weird in jeans even though there may very well be some guys in suits at the table next to you.  The patio is expansive, but they pack a lot tables out there so it feels a little cramped when full.

All told, it was a nice enough meal and setting but not outstanding.  Oddly enough, the one thing that really stands out was the balsamic vinegar.  I don't know what they do to their vinegar but it was so rich and flavorful, I'd have been content to just snack on bread dipped in oil and vinegar all night.  It was that good.

2011-06-28,5.0,"If you're looking for the best patio in the city, look no further. Sure, you can find a good patio in Greektown, but you'll also be smelling cars and listening to them honk. Just north on Halsted lies Piccolo Sogno. It almost seems misplaced. I say this because it's a few feet from Emmit's and Richard's, the diviest of dive bars. PS is so modern and elegant, you don't even feel like you're in the city, let alone in the somewhat industrial part. I made reservations for the patio specifically a few weeks prior at PS for my beau's bday. I had originally thought that it was going to be old Italian with a little bit of modern flare. It turned out to be far beyond my expectations, and quite contemporary, but without losing the organic Italian feel. Their wine list is for everyone. You will find everything in your price range, and if you don't understand what is being offered, the waiters are more than experienced in telling you what's to be expected. Their bread with olive oil and balsalmic was amazing, 3 kinds, no salt or pepper needed. Immediately (while reading the menu online before dinner), I knew we had to start with the Griglia Mista (seafood salad). I was actually a bit nervous, not because of the wide array of tentacles, but because the last time I had grilled octopus and squid, it was chewy and way too heavy on the lemon. I was pleasantly surprised that everything was very fresh, and not over seasoned. We both agreed that the octopus was perfect without anything added, not even lemon. The shrimp were perfect as well, not too fishy, mostly seasoned with pepper and other herbs. For the main courses we started with the clam and pancetta pizza. The pizza was large, about 6 slices, on thin crust that had the best combination of onions, light white cheese, and a very flavorful oil in addition to the clams and pancetta.  On to #2. No matter where we go, the beau loves his short ribs. The chef was kind enough to split up our plates for us without even asking! What service, I tell ya! (There was no split fee, either ;)) No wrong way for short ribs, we finished every bite. Our server, Humberto, was delightful. Of course, at the end of the night, we received a Happy Birthday chocolate gelato dessert that was cold, creamy, and rich. Ugh, to live in Italy and end every meal with that would allow me to die happy at any age.

2011-06-05,3.0,"Here is how I can sum up our dining experience at Piccolo Sogno: a slow and steady decline. I'll break it down chronologically 1. Bread - the foccacia and other bread was great. I almost ate the whole basket by myself. You can accent the bread with olive oil or balsamic vinegar. 2. fried calamari - superb. Some of the best I've ever had. A light breading which allows the calamari taste to remain present. Not over-fried. Just a delightful way to start the meal.  2.5. the marinara sauce. Did not come out with the calamari. Maybe about 3 minutes after the squid hit the table. WHY? Anyways, I did not enjoy the marinara sauce, because it tasted like tomato bisque. But the other three diners at our table loved it because it tasted like fresh pureed tomatoes. To each their own... 3. Entrées: gnocchi, pork tenderloins wrapped in prosciutto, pasta with asparagus and truffle oil, short ribs, and rizzoto. I sampled everyone's entrées, and the best was the pasta w/ asparagus. But that may have just been the truffle oil entertaining my taste buds. the gnocchi was a little too salty. The pork tenderloins were too thick, which made chewing a chore. the short ribs were average, and the rizzoto was no more memorable  than the other dishes. 4. Pepsi. the waiter asked one of our diners if she wanted another pepsi. She said yes. The pepsi never came. After we had settled the bill, a different server approached our table asking if anyone had ordered another pepsi.  5. Spilled water. As one of the waiters was clearing the table, he knocked over a glass of water. Fortunately no one was splashed with too much water. And I am not faulting the guy for something that was unavoidable, but merely giving a factual recount of our dinner. So as you can see, the food was underwhelming.

I just let the waiter pick one out for me instead of making a blind guess and he did a fine job. - The food is mostly bland. It is rustic Italian, true, but I was hoping for a little more out of some of the dishes, particularly the Porchetta, which came out a little dry. I kind of wish that I had ordered a pasta or the fish special instead. We also tried the insalata di carciofini, burrata con culatello, and griglia mista. Everything was OK, but nothing was great, except the pizza. If this restaurant were anywhere else, it would be alright to serve average food, but it is in the same neighborhood and price bracket as such flavor sanctums as Girl & the Goat and Carnivale. I was just a bit underwhelmed. -- The patio is amazing, but I'm going to go ahead and recommend that you don't let them seat you by the plants along the wall. An uninvited guest popped out and said hello at the end of our meal. I tried to downplay it and I didn't want to make a scene, because I know that it is hard to keep wildlife away from patio dining areas and I know that they are probably doing everything that they can to do so. Yanyao even named the critter ""Giuseppi"" and pretended that he was part of the waitstaff, but I can definitely see other people freaking out if they had seen what we did.",0.994,0.805,0.165,0.03,0.6083646616541354

2011-05-24,4.0,"I'm really glad Piccolo Sogno is in my 'hood.  And anyone who knows me at all is fully aware of what a complete and shameless snob I am when it comes to Italian food.  I guess that's what living in Italy for 3 years before running a one's own Italian restaurant kitchen will do to a person.  So for me to approve means that the place is the real deal. It was definitely hard for me to choose from the menu of beautiful, seasonal classics (and some equally delicious looking non-classics).  Fresh fava beans with pecorino and arugula, Roman-style braised oxtail, fried squash blossoms and pancetta & local egg pizza are just a few that piqued my interest.  Luckily for me, Piccolo is kind enough to offer half portions of pasta so we were able to order a couple of different ones to taste AND a secondo (the protein course).  I love it when restaurants make it easy to order and taste lots of different things. Our first choice was a spring tortelloni filled with buffalo milk ricotta and artichokes lightly sauced with fava beans, peas and parsley.  What they didn't tell me was that the base of the sauce was butter.  I guess I should have assumed so since it's an extremely rare case that any restaurant's priority is watching the status of my thighs.  Regardless, the pasta was beautiful and thin and cooked perfectly.  I can't say that the flavor of the artichokes really came through and I guess it was still a bit early for favas because the ones they used were dried.  The real component that enticed me was the buffalo milk ricotta and, while it was good, I felt that it would have been better appriciated simply smeared on a piece of bread with a sprinkle of sea salt.  Pretty, though, huh?                     This is just my half of the half... Next was another handmade pasta called 'paglia e fieno' which translates to 'straw and hay' for its yellow and green color.  It was served with veal ragu that was more reminiscent of a true 'Bolognese' sauce than a simple ragu.  (I guess I'd better explain:  A ragu is any stewed meat sauce.  It's made in every region of Italy according to what's available and usually has a tomato sauce base.  Often the meat is cut in large pieces that break down on their own with low and slow cooking.  A 'Bolognese' is the specific style of ragu that originated in Bologna.  It, too, has a tomato base but the meat is always ground.  The biggest difference, though, is the addition of a dairy product during the final stages of cooking, usually milk and/or cream and sometimes butter, too, which this one most definitely had.  This makes for a lighter colored, richer flavored sauce.  So, all 'Bolognese' is ragu, but not all ragu is 'Bolognese.'  Get it?)  Not too shabby for a half portion. Lastly we had the Sapore di Mare (the flavors of the sea).  It could have been a slight mistake on my part to order this because I make a similar seafood stew at home and I should have known that I'd like mine better.  I make mine a little soupier than this one and I'm convinced that they unnecessarily added cream.  Plus, I felt that it needed a hit of a fresh herb to add another dimension.  Maybe I'll make one soon and post it.  It's one of my favorite fast, low-cal dishes to make.  You'll see... mine's better:). As usual, I already know what I'm going get next time I go.  It's their amazing antipasto spread.  It reminds me of how they do it in Rome with a huge variety of grilled veggies, cold braised bean and a little salumi and cheese.  That, and I really want to try one of their pizzas.  I know it's not going to be Spacca pizza but I'd be happy if it was Roman-style, too.  Check out this lovely spread... Even the coffee was real deal.  Short, deep, rich and sticky with a thick crema.  A perfect finish. I really liked the ambiance of the place, too.  It's a pretty, white tablecloth joint that's elegant but not pretentious.  We sat at one of the little 2 tops in the bar area.  I'd happily sit there again or at any other seat in the resto including the bar.  I hear their patio is the best in the city for outdoor dining during the summer.  I can't wait to check it out. The overall service was pretty darn good, too.  I can't say that our waiter was as knowledgeable as I would have liked him to be but the rest was great.  Smooth, friendly, thorough.  The short version (out of 10)... Food:  8.5 Service: 8.5 Ambiance: 9 Overall impression:  8.5 Would I go back?   Yup.  Can't wait for patio weather!",0.9992,0.817,0.17,0.013,0.5372538212815989

2011-05-07,3.0,"4 starts for the quality of the food.. which is obviously very much reflected in the prices (read: $$). I'm kinda on the fence about this place, so I'll post the Good and the Bad, and I'll let you decide: GOOD: Our waiter was definitely 5 stars. An Argentinian dude, that saw that we were speaking Spanish to each other and took the opportunity to explain the dishes and the menu in Spanish- excellent cause we didn't have to translate anything to our grandma. For a fancy restaurant, he was able to understand my dad's terrible jokes and play along with. He rocked. The antipasti was delicious, especially the cauliflower, the sun-dried tomatoes and the grilled zucchinis. The added olive oil and thick (honey-like) balsamic vinaigrette made pretty much anything we dipped in, pretty effing tasty.  He also recommended that I get the stracci: a papardelle-type pasta with garlic, asparagus, leeks and white truffle oil. It was overall tasty, but nothing out of this world.. and pretty much disliked by everyone in my table. People at our table seemed to really enjoy the fruitti de mare pasta waaay over my dish.  BAD Our host/sommelier showed up with 2 bottles of wine that he had decided we were going to drink. Unfortunately for him, my family is as wine-snobby as it gets, and we weren't just going to drink anything he put in front of us. We noticed that although the wine selection was 'extensive', it really only had italian wines and they were all the same brand (just different year)... not really my kind of variety. After noticing that there were no petite syrah, shyraz, malbec or merlot, we gave up with some 07 Pinot noir that wasn't all that bad.   Overall, an OK place for a fancy dinner with a large group - mostly for the service and the attention that you get. However, for a food addict like me, I though that the prices really did not represent the quality and taste of the food, and just felt like I was paying for 'ambiance' and really overpriced wine.",0.9644,0.83,0.118,0.052,0.5321553884711779

2011-05-05,2.0,"The fact that I am sitting at my desk contemplating a snack after finishing lunch here nearly two hours ago should speak volumes. As a venue, the spot itself is nothing spectacular as it is located along a rather industrial stretch of road and the valet lot for parking is smack dab against the restaurant. The decor was also artless with very little to look at on the walls and not a very inviting area right when walking in.  As to the food itself, I have experienced tastier Italian food even at middle-market or lower end places (or even chain restaurants). To start, I had the pear salad. The leaves were *exclusively* dandelion greens, which to me was unacceptable and uninspired. I would have preferred a spring mix. The pears themselves were mealy and not much to write home about.  For the main, I opted to go with the appetizer-sized portion of pasta. It was very a small portion of cheese ravioli. There were essentially four on the plate. Note that I'm not complaining as the dish was fairly bland, and there is no way that a larger portion of such a dish could have been endured. Even the bread selection was uninspired. I reached for a bread stick that must have been from earlier in the week: to say that it had passed its sell-by date is putting it charitably. The questionable execution of these dishes could be overlooked had the service been more pleasant. The server seemed to stop by at awkward moments. I also got the sense that she was checking in only as a formality, as these overtures were devoid of empathy or, for that matter, genuine interest. in how the meal was going. It seemed there was a lack of continuity, with one member of waitstaff announcing the specials, the server inquiring as to the dishes, and yet another removing plates.  As I needed to get back to the office quickly I opted out of coffee or dessert. I did take a peek at the dessert menu--even the gelato selections seemed uninspired (cappuccino and strawberry flavored).  Even a mini chain like Caffe Bacci would be preferable to this spot.

2011-04-21,1.0,"I've read so many great reviews of this restaurant that I chose it as the venue for an important dinner with my wife and another couple visiting from out of town. Leaving nothing to chance, I made a 9:00pm reservation and we dutifully checked in at the restaurant, everyone dressed up for our fun night out, at 8:45pm. Upon arrival, we were told by a host in a gray suit that, "" it might be a bit longer"".   No worries! I thought, we'll go to the bar and split a bottle of Prosecco. I should note that he could also have been a manager, but certainly in title only, as it became clear that he was managing nothing.  I'll refer to him as ""The Cheap Gray Suit"" for the duration, as the word and title ""host"" allude to some level of hospitality, of which there was not a  whiff. At 9:15 I politely inquired with The Cheap Gray Suit if he had any better indication of the time we might be seated (trust that I am not re-coloring this to my favor, we were truly courteous and very reasonable in all our encounters with The Cheap Gray Suit).  We were told flatly, and now surprisingly, a bit rudely, that it would be longer. Back to the bar to try to keep everyone's spirits up... At 9:30, after watching a number of parties of four, who arrived after us, be seated my wife checked back with The Cheap Gray Suit.  Again, nothing.  No apologies and no updates, other than it would be a longer wait.  This time, The Cheap Gray Suit added a dash of highbrowed aloofness for good measure.  Is there anything more off-putting than being subject to unwarranted snobbery? Actually, there is!  Unwarranted snobbery directed toward someone else in your company.  That was the final interaction with The Cheap Gray Suit we were prepared to endure.  There are too many other fine restaurants in the city. If any of the staff had made any effort to even acknowledge our wait, we still may have gritted our collective teeth and pressed on (not to let one spoiled Gray Suited apple ruin the bunch.)  As it happened, we were ignored, the hour was late and the wives were fading.  We informed The Cheap Gray Suit we were leaving on the way out the front door, and departed for a fine sushi dinner at Mirai Sushi. I eat out frequently, and completely understand a busy restaurant and the possible resulting delays, but it wasn't the wait, it was the pathetic attitude of The Cheap Gray Suit that spoiled our experience.  The Cheap Grey Suit was unwaveringly unapologetic, smarmy and obviously could care less that we would be, and were, waiting so long (despite having a reservation).  When we told him we were leaving he, remarkably, continued to maintain a perfect balance between unapologetic rudeness, smirking attitude and a dreamy vacancy. A fantastic example of somebody who has no business in that business. Pity, as this is obviously a fine restaurant, to have such an sad amateur as the first (and in our case, last and final) point of contact.",0.9349,0.803,0.113,0.085,0.5483593073593073

We spotted this gem over a year ago when we first moved into the neighborhood.  When we first started going it was very easy to get a table but now you DEFINITELY have to make a reservation a few days in advance, even during the week.  This is due to the praise they received over the last year, particularily for their outdoor dining space, which deserves all the praise it gets.  Nothing beats sitting on the back patio at Piccolo on a warm summer's night.

We picked a worth occasion (Erica's mom's birthday) to make a return trip, though I sincerely hope it's not another year before returning. There's a lot of Italian restaurants in the city, especially lately, but I still believe Piccolo belongs with the best of them, especially per dollar spent. The pizza and pasta are fresh and delicious, our service attentive and well informed and everything else complimentary authentic.

I want to try other new Italian restaurants for comparison sake, but PS will remain a solid go-to for great Italian in the city. We started with a wood fired, tasty fresh pizza to share (that they cut and served on individual plates for us...nice touch). I might need to try more of the pizzas because they are awesome. I also had a fresh green salad and Jordan had a minestrone soup. The salad was ok, nothing special, but nothing wrong with the mixed salad. We should have ordered another pizza. As I said, everyone was in a pasta mood, but we all ordered very different dishes. Jordan loves fruit de mer pastas (sea food pasta) and that was his choice. Erica had the ravioli, I went with a special wheat pasta with meat sauce, and Jean ordered the stracci di farro (Farro flour pasta triangles, leeks, asparagus, garlic, truffle oil) - the dish I was going to order but she was the birthday girl so I gave in :) I'd say my whole wheat spaghetti was the least interesting and number four on the taste level. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it, but having made a lot of wheat pasta at home, it's hard to make it fantastic without gallons of oil,butter,garlic, cheese, etc. I appreciate the option of a healthier dish - though I should have ordered something I normally don't eat at home to enjoy the fruits of great cooking at Piccolo. Erica's ravioli ""piccolo sogno"" (Four cheese ravioli, pine nuts, butter, Marsala glaze, parmesan curls) was very tasty, especially for a traditional pasta dish. She shared with us but only reluctantly. It was a good order. My favorite though was Jean's stracci. I loved the richness of the pasta and the flavors of the garlic, cheese and asparagus. I would love to have an entire plate of that - a great dish. And since we were in a celebratory mood we finished the meal with three scoops of very good gelato. The two flavors we loved the most were brandy/raisin and chocolate chip. Again, another plate I didn't want to share.  We had a great meal at good value. Erica wants to return when the weather allows them to open up the back patio. I know there is good Italian in the city but this must be one of the best. I look forward to going back without waiting 13 months.",0.9991,0.707,0.243,0.05,0.5297222745048833

The bar area was pretty cool--it reminded me of an old school Chicago bar from the 40's.  We ordered the margherita pizza and the insalata di pere salad as appetizers. The pizza wasn't as crispy as I would have liked-but that's probably my only complaint. For our entrees I ordered the stracci di farro   Farro (flat pieces of pasta, asparagus, leeks, garlic, truffle oil)---the truffle oil REALLY made the dish. My bf ordered the tortelli  alla bolognese   (potato and fennel stuffed saffron pasta tossed with a meat and tomato ragu).

Looks: Piccolo is well decorated and I absolutely love their old fashion chandeliers. The tables are well spaced apart so you have your privacy and be intimate with your table. Staff: I was greeted by the front staff when I arrived and when I left the Chef/Owner Tony Priolo was near the door and he thanked us for coming in. Although we did not have one specific waiter, it seemed like we actually had 2-3 different people taking care of us, each one was polite and knew their menu inside and out. Food: For appetizer my boyfriend and I had the Soup of the day which had eggs and veggies (I am terrible with remembering names). This dish was warm, savory, and different. I never had a egg soup taste this good and I was sad face when I finished it. My main entree was ""Penne Integrali All' Arrabbiata"" which consisted of whole wheat noodles, spicy tomato sauce, and fresh mozzarella. This dish was not spicy which is good, because you don't want your dish too spicy and not be able to concentrate on how yummy it is but yet it had a kick to it. Loved the spices and the fresh mozzies. The dish was plentiful and I ended up taking some home. My boyfriend had the salmon dish which he liked a lot but unfortunately I did not taste it since I am not a huge fan of salmon.

Plus, the staff was very friendly and the service was very quick...I sat up at the bar and they set me up very fast, I had silverware, plates, water and a bread basket within minutes of sitting down.  For the antipasto, I had the zuppa del giorno, which was a cauliflower and potato soup. It was tasty but it was missing something, after adding a little salt and pepper the flavor really opened up. I think some truffles would have elevated the dish.  For the primo, I had tagliatelle del cinghiale, tagliatelle with wild boar. This dish was very comforting, I imagine that if I had an Italian grandmother she would cook me something like this. The dish had subtle hints of nutmeg, cinnamon and rosemary which was well balanced. The boar meat was also very tender.  For the dolce, I had the saffron and vanilla panna cotta.

Friend's entree: Paglia e Fieno con Vitello (""Straw & Hay"") - also delish.  The veal ragu makes it meaty and hearty and awesome. 5. For dessert, the baked stuffed apple is the way to go!

It was a tagliatelle with wild boar ragu.  We had tried a wild boar ragu in Tuscany this past summer, and Piccolo's version was very comparable.  The meat wasn't quite as tender, but overall the taste was right.  For entrees I had short ribs which were good but over-salted I thought, and my husband had some gnocchi dish which he liked.   Service was good but kind of slow, and confusing.  I think we literally had 10 different people at our table at times throughout the night.  There was someone who I presume to be our waiter (he took our order), someone who filled our water, someone who dropped off our entrees, someone who boxed them up, an add'l person who took drink orders later in the night...

Undeniably, the environs of Piccolo Sogno are positively lovely. Warm, glittering, classy, dripping in chandelier lighting... everything date nights and special outings are made of! And then, of course, there's that patio. Mama Mia! One of the best - and sexiest - in the city, this outdoor space is absolutely made for warm nights, long meals, flowing wine and loud Italiano-style conversation. It's secluded and beautiful, yet utterly full of life and energy. Bring on the belly laughs! Should one point and one alone in regards to Piccolo be made, it is this: do not miss the patio.  Surely that still leaves curiosity to the effect of service and food, right? Well, I'll tell you this, there is room for improvement in each category. During my two visits to PS, service was slow and a bit monotone both times. Staff here seems to lack the aura of familiarity and warmth that any good Italian restaurant's servers should have.

Yep, you heard it. While our Ravioli Piccolo Sogno (four cheese ravioli, pine nuts, butter, Marsala glaze, parmesan curls) was positively tasty and everything carb decadence should be, it was pretty much the only dish that was truly well-executed all evening. The much hyped House Antipasti Platter was a snoozefest in tones of prosciutto, parmigiano, olives and cold grilled zucchini. Ho-Hum. Then there was the flavorful, but definitely crust-mushy Mozzarella and Arugula pizza, followed by the whole fish, salt-crusted Branzino that arrived to our table lukewarm at best. I was seriouslythisclose to sending it back, but knowing the cook time of a whole fish (and not wanting to look like a brat in front of my elegant dining companions), I put up and shut up with the obviously ill timed main course.

2010-10-13,3.0,"One indian summer evening, a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead met at Piccolo Sogno for a long-overdue night out. Plans were made so long ago that we weren't even sure how it came to be that Piccolo Sogno was chosen. And again, since reservations were made long ago, we had no idea that it would be warm enough to sit outside in mid October and enjoy their lovely patio, but indeed it was. Outside seating is well sought out so when we arrived at prime dinner hour, we were told there would be a short wait; this was no problem, as it gave us time to enjoy a glass of wine at the bar. We were shown to our table and we are all surprised at the size of the patio, as well as the crowd. Holy cow - this place was Jumpin' Jack Flash! We started perusing the menu as well as the specials and immediately decided that whatever we ordered, we would share. It's so much more fun that way. The server went over the specials with us, all of which sounded incredible and just made our decisions that much more difficult. Then he promptly disappeared. For like 20 minutes. We were hungry gals by then and wanted to start stuffing our faces. Finally he appeared and we started rattling off our choices: an antipasto platter, an arugula pizza, ravioli ""Piccolo Sogno"" and the pan-roasted, salt-crusted Branzino. We told our server that we didn't really care what order the food came out, hoping that it would be paced accordingly. The antipasto platter arrived, as well as the white bean soup that I ordered. The soup was good, but it lacked deep flavor. The antipasto platter sounded better than it was; it had the usual suspects of grilled vegetables, olives, Pecorino, and proscuitto, but it just didn't ""wow"" me. By now our wine glasses were long empty and then appears our branzino - the main course. We thought it odd that our pizza and ravioli hadn't yet been served as they are considered second courses. The branzino was fileted and de-boned off to the side so we didn't get to see them do it tableside, which I would have enjoyed.  The server brings our branzino to the table, along with the pizza and ravioli. He never asked about more wine, and in fact whisked away the wine list before we could even inquire about ordering more. He brings it back and once we agreed on ordering a bottle of red, we deferred the selection to the blonde in our triumvirate of Yelpettes. The bottle of red is poured. To be honest I don't recall what it was, but it was very smooth and drinkable. We passed the food around and dug in. My verdict: Ravioli - very good; nice sauce. Would order again Branzino - light and delicate, and juicy grapefruit segments and capers were a nice complement to the fish Arugula pizza - decent, but I thought it was a little bland and we all agreed that the crust should have been crispier Once dinner was finished, we were asked about dessert. The others declined, but I talked them into sharing a panna cotta, which is my all-time favorite Italian dessert, and one I don't generally let pass me by. Piccolo Sogno's was quite good. Nice balance of vanilla, saffron and caramel, and plentiful berries on the side; we enjoyed this. In summary, their patio was lovely, the service was spotty, and the food was good, but not remarkable. The company was ten stars though; I'm sure we could have eaten anywhere and had a good time, but we'll likely not rush back to PS.",0.9974,0.796,0.155,0.049,0.5087152777777777

But I'd read only positive things about Piccolo Sogno, so I was excited when Rick picked this place for an impromptu date night.  For starters, the service is top notch. Our server was polite, easily made recommendations, wasn't pushy at all, and was uber-prompt but not rushed.  I also dug the ambiance. Romantic but still good for groups. Even though it was chilly, they had the patio open and it looked like a little garden of Eden. We opted to sit inside, but were next to the open patio doors so got a little of both worlds.  We got the bread soup for an appetizer. Our server warned us that this is more like stuffing and not really soup. We were still sold on it, and I'm glad we got it because it was delicious and not something I had ever seen before. Soup-flavored stuffing is the only way to describe it, but trust me, it's better than it sounds. I opted for the house ravioli and loved it. Stuffed with four cheeses and covered in what had to be primarily butter. The pasta had that perfect al dente chewiness that I can never replicate at home. I can't promise that this is the best thing on the menu since I only tried a few things, but I can promise that you won't regret ordering it. I begrudgingly traded plates with Rick halfway through the meal because I felt bad that his gnocchi wasn't as awesome as the ravioli. It was perfectly passable, but the pillows were a bit too starchy and didn't absorb the other flavors very well. The gnocchi sauce was also heavy on the butter but just wasn't as delicious as the ravioli sauce.    Yummy bread basket. We each got our own plates for pouring the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I like it when places let you DIY on this. There is a sweetness to the house BV that makes it unusually flavorful.

Now to the food.  I know this restaurant is rustic Italian, but I kept looking for the TOMATOES and SPICES...where were they??  The food was so BLAND, and I think the lack of tomatoes was part of the reason why.  We ordered the pizza as an appetizer...crust that was only slightly thicker than a piece of copy paper, some cheese, and mushrooms, that's about it.  BORING.  Also got the calamari.  The coating tasted, I dunno, kind of rancid actually.  I've been disappointed every single time I've had calamari stateside; nothing compares to having it in Spain on the coast (which I have done multiple times in multiple places in Spain), and this was no exception.   We also had the proscuitto/fig appetizer and I was not into that so did not try that, but I LOVE fresh figs and these did not look that juicy at all; plus, I thought there could have been more figs on this dish in proportion to the calamari.  I did get the caprese salad and wondered why it did not seem to have any balsamic vinegar on it.  There was, however, a cute small bottle of balsamic on the table, so I availed myself of it.  It was served on this gigantic plate too, which made it seem like I was getting a teeny-tiny portion.  I thought it was overpriced at $13.   For an entree I had the risotto, and this is only the second time I've had risotto.  It was supposed to have tomatoes in it, but by then it was dark and I did not see any tomatoes (unless they were yellow).  The risotto was just OK.   The waiter came with a beer for the person next to me and tripped, and spilled the beer all over my place setting and my lap--quite  disappointing!  The head waiter came over promptly, gave me club soda and a napkin, and offered to pay for the dry-cleaning.  As my pants were machine-washable microfiber, and dried quickly, I told him it was no big deal (I would just smell like a bar! -- and I am not a big drinker, and did not order any alcohol that night--how ironic!). The service was slow like molasses.  By the time I got my food, I was not in the mood to eat.  It had been a long day already.   So for me, I would rather go elsewhere - Trattoria Dinotto is much higher on my list!.",0.8488,0.858,0.081,0.062,0.4451127819548871

I've been driving by it for the last year, so curious about what the story about this place.  All it took was a really sunny day and a picture of their fabulous outdoor patio to finally get me there.   First, since we don't have many sunny days left - definitely take advantage of their patio. It's proably the best one I've ever had al fresco dining at. Now, the patio definitely is the selling point, but even if this place didn't have it I would still give it 4 stars.  The food and service were great.  I started out with a special gazpacho that was perfect for the warm day and surprisingly filling.  I personally hate it when I can differentiate gazpacho with salsa, but the consistency of this one was much like a bisque with more texture.  Delish. As my main course I got the grilled seafood salad and this is absolutely one of my favorite dishes.  Who can say no to grilled shrimp, calamari and scallops served over a bed of arugala in a light vinegrette.  It's just what I was hoping for and definitely filling. I haven't tried their dinner menu, but based on my first experience there I'll be sure to come back again.",0.9898,0.722,0.22,0.058,0.5888615216201423

First of all, I do have to say that the outdoor patio is lovely.  It is quaint and romantic.  And, let's see, what other nice things to I have to say about this place . . . oh yeah, nothing. This place was filled with senior citizens!!!  I mean, seriously, it was 7:30pm on a Saturday night when I went and I sh*t you not, the average age of the people dining there was probably 68.  Old suburbanites.  A double negative. But enough about the atmosphere.  The food is the most important, right?  It was crap.  Crap!  We got the antipasta appetizer platter.  It had some cooked vegetables, proscuitto,and cheese on it.  It was not horrible, but not good either.  Very, very average.  For dinner, I had the gnocchi and my husband had the pappardelle with lamb meatballs.  Both were horrendous.  The gnocchi was incredibly bland.  It tasted like some boiled puffs of flour with some Hunt's canned stewed tomatoes on top.  Yum.  And the pappardelle - including the meatballs - was completely dry.  The meatballs looked like something right out of a can of Dinty Moore.  Yum yum. It was just bad.  This is an Italian restaurant - I certainly expected some good, basic Italian pasta dishes.  And I certainly didn't find it here.

On a recent visit for dinner, the food was above average, service was adequate though unenthusiastic, and the atmosphere was lively though hardly unique. I suppose I anticipated a special, one-of-a-kind experience here based on the tremendous buzz it has received, and that wasn't what we got.  The fish dishes our party ordered were well-prepared and nicely seasoned, though, again, preparation and presentation were not particularly unique. The short ribs were fattier than many I have had, but above average overall. Liked the extensive Italian wine list, and service was knowledgeable enough to make relatively informed recommendations. We did have dessert, but I don't remember what it was now, which tells you it was nothing that special. We were seated very near the outdoor patio in an unheated area on a relatively cool evening, which made it less comfortable than I would have liked. Neat space, however. Prices are on the high side as expected but not unreasonable for the quality of food. Of course, the location is somewhat unusual but convenient enough to downtown and the highway and offers easy valet parking.  There is no question that this is a solid restaurant that serves well-prepared Italian and contemporary American cuisine. It should be in the rotation among restaurants in this tier, but it isn't so unique or spectacular that I would place it above many others like it.",0.9874,0.833,0.156,0.011,0.44600464576074333

If we had stopped with the wine, I'd say this was a solid 4 stars, but the food isn't worthy of such a rating.  If I recall, for appetizers we had calimari (it was fine, if not a little too salty), fried zucchini blossoms (WAY too much breading! definitely took away from such a delicate dish!) and the chickpea frites (the waiter raved and while these were OK, they weren't rave worthy). For dishes everyone got a range of poultry, to meats, to pastas. My pasta had mushrooms and truffle oil, and was tasty, but not stellar. Essentially the same sentiments were shared around the table. We got an assortment of desserts to share, and they were tasty but didn't blow us away. I think we raved most about how tasty the fresh whipped cream was....  It wasn't a bad meal by any means, just not worthy of all the praise this place gets.

2010-07-07,2.0,"Ok, but nothing to write home about... If you're a tourist or a someone on a first date, maybe. Otherwise, stir clear. To start, yes, the patio is really as cute as everyone says. Lovely landscaping. However, having been to much better al fresco spaces like Miami's Wish, or Isla Verde's Water Club, etc, etc... big whoop. Went 5th of July btw, mid-evening, reservation made.   Entry/Valet  - quick and easy. However, the hostess puts us in the *only* sunny spot on the patio, conveniently located next to the busing station.  Now, it's 6 pm, the sun is beaming and it's a comforting 89 degrees with 100% humidity. We said ok to the patio *after* the hostess told us she'll make sure we'll get shade, so I still don't know what gives. After asked to be reseated, she proceeds to move us to shadier spot next to yet - suprise! - another bus station... the former and the latter  tables being the smallest in the whole place,   Now, again - it's 6 PM and the place is more than half empty. So... I know we're both on the smaller side but seriously, do you *only* reserve better places for fat people?  We're always well and appropriately dressed; have all of our teeth and don't have a screaming kid with us, so we're sort of used to getting nicer tables *shrug*. Especially when 70% of tables are available.             So, space. Space is my biggest gripe about the seating - patio is jam-packed with tables, some literally 4 inches apart. So not only you are treated to a high-pitched babble about some buzzed Trixie's first date (omg... really? shut up! no way!), but you also have a pleasure of feeling some patron's cough into your neck.  Also, the older Italian folks (imaging Jersey Shores people in 30 yrs or so)  can give you a bit of a sneer as you squeeze by to walk across to the restroom... so.... learn to fly before you visit *eyeroll*.   The service - bus and waiter service friendly and responsive, no problem there. Very pleased. No grated parmesan offered with pasta - odd, but no big deal.  The food - average and un-imaginative. Poor value as well. The grilled seafood medley we had as a starter was nice, but nothing special. It was however fresh.   The entrees. Braised short ribs - dismal amount of really, really fatty pork ribs drenched in olive oil, swimming atop of cream of wheat and a few leaves of spinach.... Meh. Fatty and boring. Not worth $25 by any means.     Fruiti di mare was good, but again, rather on the bland side. Can't describe the sauce. It had an odd carrot-ey aftertaste. The best thing about it was homemade noodles - that really was good.  Could have been better *with* parmesan, but.... See above.  Desert - hazelnut cake and gelato were lovely, favorite part. Could have been just a small bit bigger. Normally, the $8-10 desert is share-able, even at *nicer* places which Piccolo definitely strives to be.  House chianti was also surprisingly good.  Will not return.  Many better Italian restaurants around; Campagnola or Café Lucci, off top of my head.

They have a number of very large umbrellas, which create almost a roof, leaving an almost cozy feel. There is a lot of vegetation and greenery (perhaps the most at any outdoor dining space I've experienced in Chicago). 2) The FOOD! I had the ravioli: four cheese ravioli, pine nuts, butter, Marsala glaze, and parmesan curls. It was nothing short of fantastic: perhaps one of the best pasta dishes I've had, ever. I literally wanted to lick the bowl! (I resisted.) My friends each also had pasta (the lasgna, the gnocchi, and a tortelli special), and all of those were also outstanding. (We like to share bites.) One of our two appetizers was very good---I highly recommend the cecina fritta--chick pea flour fries wth parmesan. They were unusual and delicious. The desserts were also good.

The interior of the restaurant wasn't anything to write home about so I'd most likely always go during warmer weather. This place isn't bumping by any means and it was filled with old people. Not that that's a bad thing we just found it odd being one of the youngest in the place. Perhaps it's different on a weekend.  The wine list is very extensive and we settled on a bottle of Chianti. For an app we had the grilled calamari, shrimp and octopus. It was delish. The wood grilled flavor was very apparent the everything was cooked to perfection. Well, I can't speak for the octopus cause I can't stomach all those tentacles but my husband seemed to enjoy it. For entrees we shared the halibut and short ribs. Both plates were practically licked clean. The short ribs were tender and cooked perfectly atop a polenta. The halibut came on top of some farro thing that was also really tasty. I can't really remember what we had for dessert. It was some chocolate cake with ice cream and some hazelnuts. It was good but today I'm wishing I didn't waste calories on it.  Our waiter was great throughout the whole meal. Very attentive and helped us with our food choices. I really liked how you can order app portions of all the pastas. I'll be doing that next time I go back. I had to deduct half a star because we waited a good 15-20 mins for our check after we finished eating and after we drank our wine.

I had salmon for my entree and the man had braised short ribs. Delicious. Delectable. And any other words that could possibly describe my food-happiness. We ordered a puff pastry custard type napolean for dessert and they wrote ""Happy Anniversary"" across the plate in chocolate. Nice touch. The wine list was fantastic and my wine snob boyfriend spent a long time perusing and making choices for us. I had a lovely Moscato with dessert and he had something too. Honestly by that time I was in such a pleasure induced fog that I'm not even sure what he had. Special mention goes to our server, Alfredo, who wins my ""best server ever"" award.

The bussers and other staff were great, but, let's be honest, you go out to be treated well at the door and at the table.  A few examples:  The waitress waited until our glasses were empty each time to ask us what we'd like for our next course. We like to order a different wine for each course, and we got the feeling that she was upset we didn't order a bottle. No one likes an empty glass! Second, when another table ordered a bottle, the waitress placed their wine chiller near out table, so we had to stare at it, and walk around it when we got up. When we asked her to move it, she acted like we were out of line.  Finally, the hostess was rude when we said we were going to go across the street while we waited for our table. The bar at PS was too crowded, and people were standing 10-deep at the door. It just didn't make sense to wait with the crowd for 45 minutes.  Since the food was above par, we might return for a bite at the bar or if we were only ordering one course. But we don't intend to bring guests.",0.9695,0.821,0.132,0.047,0.4984375

House Bread-AMAZING.  They have the cutest little containers of balsamic vinegar to accompany the house olive oil for dipping, and offer up 3 fantastic types of bread. Insalata di barbabietole-Farm beets with buffalo ricotta topped with shaved fennel and small pieces of grapefruit.  Very Refreshing and a great start. Pasta Special of the Day-Butternut Squash Tortellini drenched in Brown Sage Butter topped with Walnuts.  This was good; however I don't think it beats Tratorria No. 10's Butternut Squash Ravioli. Whole Fish of the Day:  Woodfire Seabass with Sea Salt Crust.  This was flaky and uber fresh; however my only complaint would be that when they filet the fish in front of you, they toss the crunchy bits and skin which to me, is one of the tastiest parts of fish, especially when woodfired and crusted. Porchetta Alla Romana-Roasted Pork-Mmm, perfectly moist inside and crunchy and thick on the outside. Dessert: Chocolate Cake filled with real cocoa gooeyness, topped with Cinnamon Ice Cream.  Yum.

The antipasto platter was, in fact, very good, as were the calamari.  Of course, both of those are kind of hard to screw up, but still they were both excellent.  The calamari was especially tender and lightly breaded.  I had the wild boar ragu pasta dish as my main course, and it was just OK.  None of the flavors stood out, and I've definitely had much better ragu sauces.  My boyfriend's short rib dish was tasty, but not a stand-out.  Desert was also good, although evidently not very impact-full because I can't recall what it was.

My friend also had the twice-cooked vegetable bread soup and liked it but it was definitely different but slightly overcooked. But there were absolutely no complaints about the main dish. I had the wide noodles with spiced wild boar soup. It was incredible. It tasted like pot roast and egg noodles but a billion times better. My friend had the roman style pork and that was also to die for. She was talking about it for DAYS. I would absolutely go back just for those dishes. Unreal.

We pull into the parking lot for an early dinner at the very Chicago intersection of Grand and Halsted and are greeted be 2 sparkly-toothed men in valet jackets who whisk away our American (ok, Japanese) car and open the door to a quaint bistro in small-town Italy. Piccolo Sogno, fittingly translated ""Little Dream"" welcomes you with a cozy and ""just dim enough"" ambiance. The beautiful Italian hostess ushers us to our table where our beautiful Italian waiter greets us immediately with more sparkly teeth and a wine list to top all wine lists. Wine?

Mr. beautiful waiter placed the salad in front of me and my breath caught on the beauty of it all. Who would have thought a salad could take my breath away? Multicolor beets, light green shaved fennel, fresh and creamy buffalo ricotta and just the perfect amount of cherry red balsamic vinaigrette. An assault on all my senses: spectacular.  Dinner was mushroom pizza for me; paper thin Italian pizza dough with the perfect crisp and drizzle of truffle oil and the creamiest of all mozzarellas. The rest of the table's pastas left us all with dazed and happy looks as well. Homemade gnocchi, fresh sauces, perfect portions to savor.  Dessert: Holy Hazelnuts. A pretty little plate with chocolate hazelnut lava cake, hazelnut gelato, and drizzled with creamy chocolate sauce. A sinful dessert.  Our waiter was attentive to perfection but not hovering. The rest of the wait crew hid silently somewhere to exchange my forks, fill my water, and give me a new napkin before I could realize I needed any of this.  The restaurant is small but just safe of too cramped. Ask to sit in the dining room because the bar area seemed less.. authentic (and loud).

We told him her name and how to spell it.  He also said he never sings and has a terrible voice and assured us that wouldn't happen.

2009-11-28,5.0,"My friend had been raving about Piccolo Sogno for a while so we finally made plans to meet there one night with another friend. I remember going there when it was Timo and I was eager to see the latest incarnation. The decor is simple and classy, the bar was packed, so was the restaurant and the atmosphere was lively.  Since I was a little late, they had already gotten the party started with a tantalizing antipasti plate and a nice bordeaux, which we were allowed to bring for a nominal corkage fee. Sublimely roasted asparagus, caulfilower, tomatoes, carrots, portabella mushrooms and zucchini adorned the plate and delighted our tastebuds. I was informed that we were having the steak and pasta for an entree so I surreptitiously unbuttoned my jeans to make more room. When the server brought out our entrees I felt as if I had been teleported back to medieval times! My eyeballs had to be placed back into their sockets because I have never seen a piece of meat this huge in my entire life! I was informed it was a porterhouse and we were going to share it... thank God. This delicious piece of meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection and I don't do rare steak,  but this was absolutely delectable. We also shared two sides of pasta--  savory butternut squash ravioli and a mouth-watering ribbon pasta with a red meat sauce that were just out of this world. I don't know how I found room for the sorbet , but I did.  This was a great time! Service was  impeccable, we had an awesome table near the window and the chef even came over to see how we were enjoying our meal. A great place for couples and large parties. They should have wheelbarrows near the doors because you have to be rolled out of here after a meal.

We started with the prosciutto and vegetable platter to start as well as the calamari, which were both excellent. For the main courses I ordered the pappardelle con cinghiale and my friends had the duck, gnocchi di spinaci and braised pork. The gnocchi, which was my original choice was the clear winner with the meat dishes fairly decent.  The decor of Piccolo Sogno is a bit dark, but has a little old world flair you would expect of any Italian restaurant. I'd definitely take a date to eat here... my only real complaint was that the bathroom was very common. It could have been a bathroom at a local deli or pizzeria, but still had the personalized high end towels with the restaurants insignia and all on it.

2009-11-02,3.0,"I had an affair on Saturday night. Go ahead and tell my wife because she was there and actually encouraged it. OK, now get your dirty minds out of the gutter.  Our favorite mid-priced Italian restaurant in the city is Follia - for that matter it's one of our favorite restaurants of any kind for the food, the atmosphere, the owner/staff, etc. However, after hearing so many great things about Piccolo Sogno, we decided to step out on our very solid and wonderful relationship with Follia and thought there's nothing wrong with having an alternative on the side. The menu looked very similar to Follia both in terms of selection and price so we figured we'd be in for a great meal.  Early in the day, we knew we were going to be running a little late for our reso, so I called and the host was very accommodating - actually pushing us up 1/2 hour even though they were booked for the night. We arrived and were seated right away. The restaurant is definitely charming and although it was way too cold to eat in their ""famed"" outdoor area, the feeling was definitely that of something not smack in the middle of the city. I couldn't quite put my finger on where this ""out of the city"" feel was - but on further consideration, I'm going to go with the suburbs (which isn't exactly what I had in mind). The crowd was on the older side (which is fine) but made it feel like a place best suited to go with your parents and/or for a weekday meal as there really wasn't too much in the way of excitement.  The wine list was extensive and moderately priced. We settled on a nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. For apps I had the fried calamari which was excellent and Amy had the caprese salad. I must denote that caprese salads are pretty much her favorite thing in the world so to say she was disappointed was an understatement. Yes, the mozzarella was creamy and delicious, but it was served with sundried tomatoes as opposed to regular ones which ultimately killed the dish.  For entrees, I had the green and white ribbon pasta with veal ragu. It was tasty but somewhat amateurish and basic and didn't really have any umph after the first few bites. Amy had been looking forward to her dish all day which was the truffle ravioli, mushrooms, cheese, etc. The dish was drenched in truffle oil to the point of being very overwhelming in a bad way. A few of her mushroom bites tasted ""like they were still in dirt"" and although we can both appreciate food ""of the earth"" this I believe was unintentional, again, in a bad way.  We opted to skip dessert and move on with our night. The bill was reasonable - just over $100 for everything mentioned.  We might give this another try in the warmer months to experience the garden but until then, it's seems that our best bet for this sort of meal is to stay faithful to Follia. It's a few days later and we're both still feeling guilty!",0.9943,0.8,0.15,0.05,0.5055339775167362

After settling in for a couple of minutes we quickly ordered a delicious bottle of wine.  Our server Frederico (?) was absolutely lovely and attentive.  He was super friendly, and completely honest.  The wine list is huge, and when we asked him his opinion of a wine, he didn't hesitate to say that he was unfamiliar with it.  This is a response I prefer over a BS answer.   So far so good, but it just gets better.  We ordered the Insalata di Pere, Sformato di Zucca as appetizers, and my friend and I shared the special Raviolini di Mascarpone, and the Rosticciana.  Can you say ""Mmmmmmmmmm.""  The sformato is a must-have, and an awesome autumn treat.  The raviolini (if you love mushrooms the way I do) was bomb, and the rosticciana (braised short rib) is comfort food at its finest.  Let me tell you, we annihilated our food without regard for anything else and enjoyed every moment of it. Was I full afterwards, you ask?  You bet, but who cares?  We ordered dessert anyway...and a bottle of Moscato D'Asti (Don't judge...we both had a long day alright?).  We went with the ""Thousand Layers"" dessert which was the only thing that didn't wow me.  It was good, but not amazing, and I am a connoisseur of all things sweet. Don't worry I'm almost done.  I'll end this by mentioning the fact that after two bottles, apps, entrees, and dessert, our bill was only $130.   In my experience, there are few times when the clouds part, a light shines down, and the restaurant gods smile upon me (cue harp music), but Piccolo Sogno is restaurant nirvana.  Everyone should go once before they die.",0.9982,0.712,0.247,0.041,0.6428352274506121

Although I have eaten at the restaurant, very good, I couldn't recall what I ate so I wasn't compelled to write anything.   This event was an office party held in the huge outdoor patio, which is perfumed by lillys and other beautifully maintained flora, we were greeted with antipasti, and a wine tasting to start us off. The wines were all Italian and ranged from a rose to a Barbaresco.  All four wines were mid range quality but perfect for this kind of event. The restaurants wine buyer led individuals through the four wines and showed great patience at the new comers that would infiltrate the line half way through. The Antipasti consisted of perfectly roasted eggplants, onions, squashes, asparagus and beets, there were two unmemorable cheeses and a nice creamy pecorino, crusty bread of course and  an olive tasting. A very nice easy to schmooze beginning.    A large communal table was set up in the shade and other tables of 6 were set up around the patio, the kitchen began bringing courses out family style, not the family style I grew up on either. First was Barrata cheese and proscuito ,then figs and proscuito,  a wonderful asparagus risotto, there was whole wheat penne in rich tomato sauce, but not drenched, just enough sauce to let the pasta shine. The main course came next with a decadent roasted pork with crispy skin and an herbacious undertone.  To liberate my palate from the unctious pork, a platter of Branzino (mediterranean sea bass) was dropped before me with a light lemon sauce and cooked wonderfully. What impressed me the most about the food was that the first communal table started its samplings an hour before my table was set, the kitchen responded flawlessly and all the food was outstanding. For dessert a table was set with canape's stuffed with creme anglaise and berries, chocolate sauce and hazel nuts, several biscoti and a few more things frankly I couldn't cram into my gullet.    Why only 4 stars a few of the planners stated the entire patio was to be reserved, but the restaurant served a few diners in the back of the patio, a few of the guests didn't like the tables being set up for regular service before 5 o'clock, the time we were supposed to be out, but this is typical for a party like this, also guests seemed confused by the service, and didn't understand how and where to eat but once again that may not have been the fault of Piccolo Sogno.   I highly recommend them for dining and for catering , and the patio is really more than you will expect.",0.9961,0.815,0.152,0.033,0.5531555944055945

I was in Italy. :::::::::::sigh::::::::::::: That is the sort of (not so 'little') dream that Piccolo Sogno induced in me the minute I walked in (out?) their outdoor space. I had heard of it, seen it, anticipated it but was still wowed. A real stunner. So much so that I decided right there and then that I would have my birthday dinner right at this very place. Damn right. But you know that they say.... Good looks aren't enough. You have to sustain them. So munching away on bread and gressini I waited on the food with mixed emotions. Apprehension, fear, hopefulness, excitement..... I loved it. My insalata di pesche was perfect. The arugula was nice and crisp, really fresh and peppery. It came with sliced and diced peaches and creamy goat cheese and a wonderful vinaigrette. The best salad I have had in a long time. I had then opted for the pasta special: orecchiete (little ears, isn't it cute) with fresh wild salmon, green and yellow zucchini, basil in a creamy tomato sauce. Once again - match made in heaven. So flavorful. And with an appetizer size serving I didn't have to feel too guilty about it....... What a great idea. Even so it's still a very generous serving. European size, I would say (wink-wink). I am holding on the 5th 'til next month. Just to fend off bad luck.",0.9955,0.693,0.239,0.068,0.5288220551378447
2009-07-18,1.0,"First visit last summer was seriously disappointing.  Food was expensive and mediocre.  Friend talked us into trying it again.... We agreed.  (After all, they must do something right to still be open, egh?) Arrived on a Thurs - shortly after a downpour.  The beautiful garden was open and they were seating patrons.  Unfortunately the tables and chairs were still sopping wet and despite the request for many napkins to sit on 2 of the 4 of us left with soaking wet butts.  (seriously irritating and NOT sexy.) The garden seating is no doubt beautiful and quite enjoyable on a less wet night.  This must be the main draw as this place is still open and taking hard earned money from folks like us.  The food was, as in the first visit, mediocre.  The ingredients and the menu were interesting, and if executed well - would be a great treat.  But...the execution was lacking. The worst part of the whole experience was the absolutely terrible service.  We waited too long for our cocktails and then one didn't arrive and it was another 5 - 10 minutes for the 4th cocktail to arrive.  After our orders were placed our waiter was not to be seen.   The food was delivered, but no waiter to ask, is everything OK? (and it wasn't)  After our drinks were empty for some time we finally caved and asked the bus boys to see about getting our waiter.  The second drinks were empty and the food nearly finished, and again, no waiter.... Seriously?  Where the heck did he go? As if after taking the food order, he was no longer needed?  I felt as if I was inconveniencing him by requesting another drink and then the check.  Uhm if it wouldn't be too much trouble could someone find our waiter so we can pay and get the heck OUT OF HERE?  Absolutely the worst service I've received in a 'better' restaurant in a long long time.    Can't figure it out.  How do they stay in business?  Don't let your friends talk you into going here.  You'll be disappointed and wishing you picked something else.

2009-07-17,3.0,"It's a given that the outdoor space here is hands-down fantastic! However, I need to base my reviews on the food. I had the Carciofini salad as an appetizer (baby artichokes with arugla and shaved parmesan) to start. The ingredients were fresh, but it tasted like the artichokes were steeped in balsamic vinegar, which overpowered the delicate flavors of the ingredients. For the main, I had the Farro di Stracci pasta. I thought the Farro pasta would be a nice change from the standard semolina, but the pasta was almost gummy and under-seasoned. I don't even think the pasta water had been salted.  Service was a touch scarce and the hostess was able to squeeze in a large party finto the garden without reservations. All in all a good place and I would go back, especially for the outdoor dining. However, the food was a touch disappointing.

2009-06-05,3.0,"I was really excited to eat at Piccolo Sogno because I heard great reviews about it and always pass it by with curiosity. I finally had a chance to dine there a few weeks ago and my review is very mixed.  Cons: I made reservations through American Express for 7:30pm on a Thursday evening. After everyone in my party arrived, we approached the hostess and she replied we needed to wait 10 minutes. We proceeded to chat outside, noticed a lot of nice cars and sugar daddies, then went back inside after 15 mins to follow up on our reservation. The hostess then said another 10 min. We played this 10 minutes after 10 minutes game one more time and finally I asked the hostess what the hold up was. It was getting late, waaay past our reservation time and we've been more than patient. The hostess told us they had an unexpected number of walk-ins and the kitchen was overwhelmed, as a result, out of consideration for my party of 3, she would rather have us wait than to sit at a table to wait for food to come out. I challenged her and asked what's the purpose of reservations if they don't honor it and instead seat all of their walk-ins? I was also surprised and didn't believe that a restaurant such as Piccolo Sogno would have an ""overwhelmed"" kitchen when it was obviously not a full house and I assume the chef is not a newbie and must have prior experience preparing for a full restaurant. The hostess apologized and told us she would speak with the manager. After being seated, our waiter was very friendly but we could tell he was overworked and a bit frustrated. Another point deduction because although I don't expect all waiters to carry a shining smile when the restaurant is crazy, it's never a good thing when your patrons can tell the restaurant is in chaos. We also had to flag down a confused bus boy many times because our waiter was nowhere to be found.  Pros: Excellent food. Not your typical huge family style Italian dinner. We could tell everything was made with quality, not quantity. We started out with the fried calamari, very fresh and lightly battered, not the type of oil you recycle again and again. My two girlfriends ordered pasta dishes: Four Cheese Ravioli and Potato and black truffle stuffed pasta whereas I ordered the special of the day, a mixed vegetables dish, perfectly grilled and fresh. The ravioli was boiled to perfection the sauce did not overwhelm the cheese, it was a perfect pair. As for the truffle pasta, you could not go wrong with truffle! We devoured our food and didn't have any leftovers. The decor was very nice too. Nothing grand, just very simple and tasteful. We didn't have a chance to sit outside but from afar it looked trendy and refreshing. It turned out the hostess did speak with the manager because we received free dessert, which was perfect as well...right amount of sweetness and size.  Overall, if it wasn't for the horrible reservation organizing skills which I'm not sure who to place the blame on, dinner was a pleasant experience. Parking was fairly easy too with plenty of street non-metered parking available, hard to come by in Chicago!",0.9969,0.79,0.163,0.047,0.594973544973545

2009-06-02,5.0,"This ""little dream"" is one that I do not plan on forgetting!!!!         It took about 15 minutes or so for the service staff to get their stride after we were seated, maybe they give you that time to take in the extensive wine menu, wine novel is more like it.  However once the meal started to progress they stepped it up and ended up doing a great job; attentive, friendly, and efficient.    Once we settled our cocktail and wine selections we started our feasting.  For Antipasti we selected ""Burrata con Culatello""(prosciutto with fresh mozzarella), the two staples of Italian cuisine, and they were both marvelous.  We also selected the ""Griglia Mista"" that included calamari, octupus, and shrimp.  The shrimp and calamari were entirely perfect with that wonderful grilled flavor and a hint of lemon while the octupus was good but nothing in comparison to the shrimp and calamari.  Lastly we ordered a white pizza from the specials that had rosemary and mushrooms on it, I wish they delivered... enough said.   For primi piatti (first course) we ordered three small orders of pasta.  I love that they give you a choice between small and large portions, the small was just the right size for all three of us to try.  We ordered the following pastas (listed in order from extraordinarily delicious to plain delicious): Pappardelle with porcini mushrooms and asparagus (this was from the specials), ""Gnocchi di Spinaci"" , and the ""Ravioli piccolo sogno"".  All of the pastas were clearly made fresh which makes all the difference.  I definitely suggest ordering anything that has the pappardelle noodles, they were a highlight of the entire meal.    Secondi piatti (second course) consisted of the ""Pesci Interno"" that happened to be an Italian sea bass that day.  It was cooked perfectly, seasoned with just the right amount of sea salt that really balanced well with the pieces of citrus fruits they garnish with and the grilled whole pieces of fennel served on the side; seeing that empty plate after the fish had been devoured was a sad moment for everyone at the table.    I Postri (desserts) were an important selection, as it was my birthday, and the servers selection of chocolate cake with hazlenut gelato was an excellent choice.  We also ordered their sorbet.  I think that their gelato and their sorbet were the shining stars of the dessert course. Lastly, let me say that it was refreshing to walk into a restaurant that is well lit; I could see everything on my plate, no candlelight necessary.  I enjoyed sitting inside with a view of the open kitchen, but next visit I will definitely remember to ask for a table on their patio as it is absolutely gorgeous!

The waiter did not explain the specials or point out any changes to the menu (something we overheard at the table next to us 2 mins later) - so we ordered a shared starter (spaghetti) that arrived promptly. Nothing special really - pasta was ok, but no spaghetti, but homemade we guessed. No parmesan offering from the waiter - who then filled up my tap water with ice tea accidentally, apologized and took my glass away. Took another 10 mins for a new glass to arrive. Both mains (salmon and pork) a bit overcooked. Sides small.  Dessert ok - but was left at the counter too long so our ice cream arrived already melted.  2 secs after the dessert arrived the waiter came back to present us with the check we hadnt asked for - strange way to say ""Time to go"".

It's a harsh start, but I wanted to end the review on a good note.  The greeter honored our reservation and we were seated immediately on the outdoor patio.  To start, the calamari was done well and the batter was not too heavy.  The funghi tartufati pizza was commendable.  But it was the pasta dishes that really won me over.  The stracci di farro was refreshing.  The pasta is made with imported farro flour and tossed with asparagus tips and mushrooms, then topped with truffle oil and parmesan curls.   The spaghetti nero ""frutti di marre"" was my favorite of the night.  The black spaghetti melded with the thick san marzano tomato sauce and there was just enough green chile to stimulate your palate with every bite.  Hidden throughout the dark strands were the array of fresh seafood.   As far as ambiance: Dining al fresco under the fig trees with a glimpse of the night sky was just sublime.  This experience ranks up there with the outdoor cabanas at Volo.  I guess this is as close to dining on the Italian countryside I can get for now...sigh*",0.985,0.841,0.124,0.035,0.5768939393939395

I had the special salad, thinly shaved artichokes and arugula. It was just like the carciofi salads I've had in Italy. My husband had the Ribollita, which was NOTHING like is was in Firenze. They took all the solid parts of the Ribollita and made a pancake out of it, kind of like Ribollita al salto. There was NO broth. Ribollita is bread soup, not bread! He said it tasted good , but it was so filling he had to leave most of it behind to save room for the entree. I was pleased that they allow appetizer portions of pasta here, and I had four beautiful ravioli Piccolo Sogno, four cheese filled clouds swimming in a lovely buttery sea. It was well done, although the Marsala drizzle could use some fine tuning. My husband had Branzino, which he highly praised. It looked like a nice piece of fish and it was cooked perfectly.

She replied that there was ""no way to know"" and that there were other parties in front of us but refused to tell us how many.  Here is the best part... as we were in the middle of speaking to her (kindly) she cut us off, pointed to the bar and again said ""you can have a drink at the bar.""  It was as if she was programmed (to suck) and had no customer service abilities.  She could see the bar and she knew darn well that it was way too packed for us to even have a chance at getting a drink.  She was extremely rude and we were appalled.  Unacceptable.

(That was a good idea... nice and low-key.. for a beer to kill the time.) We headed back over there and sat at the bar for a little bit and ordered wine. The bartender took our order.  About 10 minutes later, the hostess seated us but our wine wasn't here and it turns out the bartender didn't even put our order in. So we get seated and our service for food was not that much better. Our waiter was nice and everything, but just wasn't attentive enough for this type of restaurant. It wasn't the worst service, but let's just say that I am definitely docking points due to being disappointed by the service.  Let's talk about the food now. The food was tasty, but we were not overly impressed by it. We started with a beet salad that had ricotta cheese on it. The idea was good, but the cheese pairing wasn't right. The sweetness of the beet needed a stronger cheese to offset it. Then we tried a special ravioli purse that was filled with shredded beef. The flavor was good and it was nicely presented. We also got the crispy pork entree, which was nice and fatty... the way I like it! And it came with rosemary potatoes on the side. Bonus!  Now onto the atmosphere. I felt like I was in a fancy, eclectic house. There were fancy crystal chandeliers and brightly colored blue walls. It was different, but in a good way. The room was pretty intimate and cozy. I would definitely like to go during the summer and try out the nice outdoor patio. The clientele, I would say, is more along the lines of older people with money. I did feel a little younger and also under dressed. It is not fancy in there, but people did dress a little nicer.  Overall, it was a good dining experience.

I am happy to report that this one lives up to her - and our - expectations.   Pre-entree extravaganza: the bread basket was great and plentiful - and it is here that I will exclaim that this is hands down THE BEST focaccia that I have ever eaten. EVER. No tomatoes in or on it - just rosemary and perhaps some olive oil and garlic. It had a hint of sweetness to it which I had never experienced before. I am in love! Another thing I need to rave about right now is a side dish we ordered called caponata. OMG! I had no idea what this was and Lori explained that it is a Sicilian eggplant dish, a cooked vegetable salad made from chopped fried eggplant and celery seasoned with sweetened vinegar, and capers in a sweet sour sauce. This dish also had raisins in it and, while usually served cold, this version was served warm. TO DIE FOR! My friend ordered the insalata caprese which she loved. My partner devoured her insalata barbabietole comprised of local beets, shaved fennel, Imported buffalo ricotta, greens & citrus oil. I ordered the fried calamari served in a paper artichoke - perfectly prepared. Entrees: quattro formaggi ravioli (""Ravioli di ""Piccolo Sogno""); 2 orders of spaghetti nero ""frutti di mare"" (string cut black spaghetti, mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari with San Marzano tomatoes, green chilies); I ordered my favorite autumnal pasta - the exquisite cappellacci di zucca (spiced local pumpkin stuffed ravioli, brown butter, sage, walnuts), the leftovers of which I am looking forward to polishing off today for lunch.  Oh joy! Desserts:  I am a huge dessert fan but Italian desserts don't do a thing for me and nothing peaked my interest on their menu so I simply ordered the gelato which was very good (3 small scoops of choc chip, white choc, pistachio). My friends ordered the saffron panna cotta with caramel sauce and berries and pronounced it wonderful. Perfect cappuccinos.

I do agree with a previous Yelp reviewer who mentioned a language barrier with the bus staff. This is true - when I passed a bus guy a plate to ask for some grated cheese for my partner, he immediately disappeared with the plate before I could ask him for the cheese.

Regardless of warm weather, my husband and I arrived at 7:30 for our reservation at Piccolo.   The hostess told us it would be about 10 minutes until our table was ready so we made our way to the bar where I was disappointed to hear they were out of Sauvignon Blanc.  Cold weather and no sauvignon blanc?  This was not turning out to be a good night! Fortunately, things soon turned around. The sweet bartender introduced me to an Italian Riesling that I liked enough to order a second glass of it later during my meal.  My husband stuck with his usual- jack and coke. I wasn't thrilled with the table they sat us at (near the hustle and bustle of the kitchen), but the service turned out to be top notch.  And the food was quite good as well: Complimentary bread basket- warm, soft, and delicious! Complimentary beef croquettes- usually not a beef fan, but these fried little balls of beef were quite tasty Caprese salad for me- both the mozzerella and tomatoes were so fresh! Butternut Squash soup for my husband (a special)- he loved it so much that he used the bread to mop up every last bit of soup Fruitti De Mare pasta for me: With the attempt to not overeat I ordered the half portion.  It was the perfect size for me, although they charged us pretty much the same price for the main entree so probably a rip off to order the half portions.  I would order this again next time- loved the black noodles and seafood that topped it. Ravioli stuffed with salmon (a special- highly recommended by the waiter): My husband found it to be pretty bland and I agree based on the 1 bite I had. Custard for dessert: Best thing we had all night! All this came to about $100, which I thought was reasonable for the amount of food and quality of service we received.  However, my favorite Italian restaurant (La Scarola!) is just right across the street.

Little lights are placed tastefully throughout this green space. Ivy crawls on the wooden fence. A true escape from urban madness. A place to rest the senses...

The patio is really something, as said in ALL the other reviews. It will be interesting to see how Piccolo stays open through the winter, with half their space blanketed under Chicago snow.

She came around when we needed her and kept my wine glass full so that by the end of dinner I was in a haze (but my memory is 100% for this review).  My decision was easy when our waitress let me know they were out of the ""special pasta,"" a fabulous-sounding squash ravioli. Instead, I had the penne arrabiata, which was good but not fantastic. I love that they have whole wheat pasta, but I was left feeling that I could have made my meal at home. The salad was delicious and something I probably could not craft myself. We split the ensalada mista and caprese.  As I said before, the dessert really left something to be desired, such as 3 more scoops of gelato.

2008-08-27,3.0,"So the food is pretty good and the patio positively rocks.  HOWEVER, I have a major gripe.  This may come off as insensitive and/or politically incorrect, but I don't really care.  And it's a generalization, but since in the typical restaurant scenario a diner does not interact with the entire staff, it's one I'm prepared to make.   The bus-staff has insufficient command of the English language to properly do their jobs.  There, I said it.   How, you ask, can this be possible?  Simple.  Aside from filling up water (and iced tea) and replacing spent bread, the bus staff is responsible for taking plates away from people.  I'll not get into a sub-gripe about the inappropriateness of taking a plate from a diner when someone else is still eating, which bothers the shit out of me, and instead focus on the language skills required to perform this one task.   Scenario 1: I may or may not be done eating, but there is food on my plate.  Necessary phrase knowledge: ""Are you through with your meal, ""Can I take that,"" ""No, I'm still eating,"" and ""Yes, please take it.""  Of course there are variations, but these are simple enough and distinct enough that even a rudimentary voice recognition package could discern what the intent is.   Scenario 2: There is a substantial amount of food on my plate, but it appears as if I've stopped eating.  Additional required phrase knowledge: ""Can I wrap that for you?""  That's it.  He should already know ""yes"" and ""no"" (and again, the many variations), and the additional context of actually having the person standing in front of you making wild hand gestures that have no purpose outside a restaurant should help.   Scenario 3: There is no food whatsoever on my plate, AND EVERYONE ELSE IS DONE EATING: It is now appropriate for you to ask about taking my plate...I'll even lean out of the way for you.   We're not talking buffet's here, so those are about it.  That's 5 total phrases (and variations) that a competent bus-person should know.  I'd like to point out (1) that this is most certainly LESS English than was required at whatever interview took place prior to employment and (2) certainly within the grasp of a broad array of the huddled masses that take refuge in these United States.  I fully support many immigrants and hope that in the future there are more job opportunities for them; likewise, I do not resent the general lack of English skills among the immigrant class, as I don't fluently speak any other language and I do travel abroad.   That said, the 3 or so bus-persons I encountered in my recent visit to Piccolo Sogno failed the 5-phrase test miserably.  Ignoring the fact that (I'm actually not ignoring it) they attempted to take plates from people in my party long before actual consumption of food had ceased, there were at least 2 other observed instances of total lack of understanding of the phrases noted above.  No, I don't want you to take my plate.  Really.  I know I'm not stuffing food into my face at this moment, but I will be soon, so please leave me to it.",0.986,0.81,0.122,0.068,0.4005400432900433

The decor is just lovely...from the paint colors, to the ceiling, to the little chandelier sconces to the nooks in the walls where a vase of bold brilliant flowers fits perfectly. I ate here on opening night. We got the peach salad which tasted exactly like summer!!! - fresh sliced peaches, goat cheese, arugula, light dressing. Also, the calamari fritte was whimsically presented in a ""paper artichoke"". It was hot, crispy and flavorful. I got the beef with polenta dumpling and greens (broccoli rabe, maybe?). The meat was very tender and rich and the bitter greens were the perfect foil. I tried the gnocchi - first time I had gnocchi with veggies IN the gnocchi itself which gave it a hint of fresh herbal taste. Broth was kinda salty for me. Dessert was house-made chocolate chip gelato. Our server didn't know the whole menu yet and failed to tell us about the special antipasti...when there was a table display of all kinds of yummy things.

2008-07-30,4.0,"Delicioso!  My very generous boy took me here for a fantastic dinner last night.  First off, let me say, the outdoor patio is a peaceful sanctuary despite the busy intersection (Grand/Halsted/Milwaukee); we could only hear a touch of traffic noise over the din of the restaurant, and the garden setting is beautiful.   Our waiter was pleasant, and I could listen to his Italian accent all day long; love it!  They use a team approach to serving, which can be a little bit much, but efficient, I guess.   I started with the caprese salad, which was fresh and great (hard to mess up, really), then on to the gnocchi, which was heaven in my mouth (second only to the orgasmic gnocchi at A Tavola).  It's a little rich, but the portion size was perfect.  By the way, I love that they offer both appetizer and entree portions of the pastas, so you can opt to enjoy a three course meal without busting the bank, or your belt.  The boy had the zucchini appetizer (sort of a breaded zucchini with cheese in a tomato sauce), which was very tasty, and then the whole fish of the day, red snapper, which was somewhat bland but still very good.  We split a dessert - not sure on what it was called, but it tasted similar to a sorbet (but was firmer and less melt-y) and it involved peaches.  It was good but not great.  We also shared a bottle of wine that was yummy.  I'm not sure what the grand total was for the night (thanks to that aforementioned very generous boy), but from perusing the menu, the prices seemed very reasonable for the quality of food, service and atmosphere. We got there early (about 6:30), without a reservation, and waited only about 5 minutes for a patio table (it was a weekday, by the way), but there seemed to be a crowd accumulating by the time we left, just after 8pm.  I would definitely recommend this place for any event, from a date to a large gathering. As an aside, I'm sort of a freak about checking out the bathroom as a final measure of the restaurant, and although the bathroom was very clean and attractive, it was nothing special.  Feel free to ignore this point if your mother did not pass this little quirk along to you.",0.9976,0.74,0.211,0.049,0.5468724279835391

Also, wine list is good, we had a nice bottle for a very reasonable price. Seemed like there were a ton of new waitstaff.  Noone waited on us until, after about 10 minutes, we flagged someone down.  She very honestly told us she was 'in training' and had been employed there for all of an hour.  But she had worked as a waitress at Timo and to her credit, she waited on us and did a fine job.   Food was very so so. Fried calamari - not so great.  No sauce came with the calamari, then they brought steaming hot marinara when we asked for sauce.  My husband got the roast chicken which was very bony, not very meaty, and so tasteless that he sent it back. He got the veal ragu over ribbon pasta instead which arrived very quickly.  But honestly - tasted a lot like chef boyardee.  I got the gnocchi with mushrooms.  I liked the mushrooms quite a bit, but the gnocchi was very bland. It is made of spinach and ricotta (not potato) and is larger than typical gnocchi so you have to cut it up.  It tastes like - nothing. Like they took wonder bread and converted it into my dinner.

2008-07-28,4.0,"As a preface, I'm ""funny"" about Italian restaurants.  I travel Italy often, love to cook and love to cook Italian.  Authentic Italian.  Until relatively recently, it was almost impossible to get good (by my standards) Italian food at a restaurant, especially in Chicago.  Italian in Chicago has long meant spaghetti and meatballs, eggplant ""parm"" and other ""southern Italian"" foods.  The problem is, the so-called ""southern Italian"" specialties found in places like Taylor Street are not really authentic for even Southern Italy.   I have to say, I was skeptical about Piccolo Sogno because I think it is, for the most part, southern or Sicilian in emphasis.  I looked at the menu on line.  OK, I thought, this looks pretty good, I'll give it a try. Guess what?  Piccolo Sogno is good (that's saying alot from me, believe it).  The pasta with veal meat sauce was really good.  I make meat sauce, but it's never as good as I want it to be.  This sauce was good!  And, the pasta was perfectly cooked.  I had the Porchetta and what a pleasant surprise that was.  It's a rolled roast (the waiter said its basically the boned meat from the suckling pig)  The seasoning was not overdone (I'm ""sensitive"" to the over-use of fennel -it was there, but it was good).  They've left the skin as a part of the roast as well, so you get that flavor and chew that the skin can give, crackly and chewy as well -just a little pan sauce and some roasted potatoes -perfect.  My friend had the roast duck, and that was very good, too.  Again, that had some ""fennel sausage"" involved, but the fennel was not overdone -the subtle flavor that fennel can have, but rarely does, was present. As far as appetizers, I enjoyed the zucchini flowers -perfectly fried and light, with a perfect cheese filling.  I topped everything off with fresh berries in Zabaglione -a very light Marsala wine foam. There are some minor flaws -the kitchen is a little slow, probably still getting their legs in a restaurant just a week old -but the waiter was good at making apology and explaining exactly the situation. Finally, if this is any sign, I noticed that a surprising number of diners around us were speaking Italian. I'm looking forward to going back.  For one thing, they have a man making pizzas in a wood oven and I'm betting they are good.  Lunch of a pizza and salad would be just the ticket. Prices, by the way, are pretty good, and the pastas are available in appetizer size portions as well, so doing the traditional appetizer, pasta and meat course is very do-able. Oh, and one, one more, more thing.  The patio looks great.  We didn't get to sit there, but the dining room is so open, and right next to the huge doors opening to the patio that it seemed as though the inside dining room was more an extension of the patio, so it was almost like being on the patio anyway.",0.9986,0.8,0.193,0.006,0.5105120678408349

I wish there were more places like this in the city.  Food: The food was OK which was such a disappointment since we had a hard time choosing what we wanted because everything on the menu seemed really good. We tried the Frutti di mare which failed miserably. The juices from the shells of the mussels and clams dripped all over the sauce and made the pieces awkward to eat as well as messed with the flavor of the pizza. The pasta dish, Pacceri di 'Ciro', that my girlfriend ordered was, served with monk fish that night, smelled and tasted so ridiculously fishy that we had to send this back. I'm really surprised it even made it to our table because of the smell. The Malfatti ai Funghi Misti which replaced the Pacceri I would recommend. I had a tasting portion of the Lasagna, which turned out really good because of the béchamel, and the Battuta di Pollo, which was OK since the chicken was too salty to even enjoy the goat cheese. Service: Our waiter was very attentive the entire night, but I was really disappointed with the manager. The time we sent back the Pacceri, the manager didn't even acknowledge our issue nor apologized for the dish even though he was clearly standing right next to us listening.

Piccolo Sogno has been open for about a week.  Yet the service was spot on and the atmosphere one of a restaurant open much longer.  Piccolo Sogno has fine Italian food served outdoors amidst trees, ivy and plantings that rival Room 21's exceptional outdoor seating area. We arrived for dinner and since I hadn't asked to be seated outdoors in the reservation- there was a 20 minute delay to get seated.  ""Fine"", we said.  ""We'll have our drinks and appetizers at the bar"".  We ordered some shaved prosciutto (we watched as they cut the meat) and fresh figs (mmmm) .  We also had a wood grilled calamari, shrimp and octopus plate served with arugula.  The only misstep of the night was in our favor as their computer system somehow ordered us two of this dish so we had twice as much of this delicious starter. We then moved to our table outdoors.  This patio is huge and probably will seat 125 people.  There are mature trees all up lit, ivy on the walls and just a great view of the city.  For me it was like a ""hidden garden"" as I had no idea this was even here. Our server knew the menu well- offering many suggestions and helping us to find that perfect wine (Amarone- which I loved but others at the table thought was a little spicy for them).  I thought the prices were reasonable given the high quality, fresh food experience that we had. For our pasta course- we got to try three as the server suggested 3 smaller sized portions so that we could taste a range of the menu.  The ravioli stuffed with 4 cheeses and covered in toasted pine nuts was my favorite.  The gnocchi was not potato but spinach and cheese served with mushrooms.  Also very good.  The final pasta was a simple bologonese sauce over pasta which was a little salty for me. For our entrees- we had the crusted lamb which was stellar and one of my friends had a margarita pizza.  The lamb was excellent and I can only assume the pizza was good as well given I never got even an offer of a bite of it!

My family and I decided to get there early, anticipating a busy opening night for them. We were greeted politely and since they weren't busy yet, we had the pleasure of choosing our seats. The décor of the restaurant has a modern yet classic Italian feel. The out door patio is a sight to remember; you are immediately taken out of your city element and brought to an Italian village scenery, there is a huge tree that centers and covers almost the entire patio. They even have a fresh herb garden for which they use in their dishes. As you can see from the pictures I posted, we were able to try many items on the menu, ALL of which were amazing. For appetizers, we had the wood grilled calamari, shrimp and octopus. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and the calamari had a nice bite to it. For the pasta, you are able to order any of these items as an appetizer portion, which is great, that way you can bring a group of people and try one of everything! We had the appetizer portion of the spinach and ricotta gnocchi, mushrooms and herbs. Most gnocchi can be very filing and heavy; however this was light and very flavorful. For our entrees, I had the Mushroom pizza...I don't even like mushrooms but for some reason I love theirs! The mushrooms are nice and meaty with a little chewy and crunch, this was topped with fresh rosemary and truffle oil. My mom ordered the ""Sapore"" di Mare, which included assorted shellfish and fishstew, the broth was out of this world and had a little kick. My dad had the Chicken breast, with local spinach, grapes and goat cheese which looked great but unfortunately, he ate all in the blink of an eye because I didn't get to sample it. As for dessert, we had a caramelized pineapple with gelati. I have never seen this offered as a dessert and I must say, it was one of a kind. The sweet with the sour, the warm with the cold, it just makes sense and we loved it. Tony Priolo, Owner and Chef of Piccolo Sogno has redefined what Italian food should be.
