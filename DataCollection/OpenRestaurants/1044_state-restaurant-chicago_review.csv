Another yelper was having a fit of not being able to tip using the gift card, but that's how it's always been. Usually that's how places run because they take the tip after from the card, so using a credit or debit card ensures the servers get their tip. So stop having a cow Steph U, get over yourself, and just don't come to the place again.

They were out of a ton of different things??? Like we tried to order the Spicy Christopher and they were out. We tried to order a cookie skillet and they were out. I ordered the carnitas bowl and it was missing half the ingredients. It was also extremely salty and my water glass was empty for a long time before it got refilled. When I asked the waitress about all the missing items as we were finishing up, she gave them to me as sides, which was nice but why the F weren't they already included in my meal?? When it came time to pay I paid with a gift card. After waiting 10 minutes to ask if I could add tip on the gift card, we were told by a hostess that we couldn't with no explanation. She then awkwardly runs off. We flag down our waitress again and ask why we can't and still no explanation, so instead we had to charge a personal card for a penny and then add tip. It was ridiculous and we still didn't get am explanation as to why we couldn't use the gift card.  There were so many instances in which a manager should have come over to explain or apologize but she never did. This place is the worst. Anyone want a $96 gift card?

Everyone had the best time and everything went smoothly. When we got there, we had our table already set up and one of our friends was already sitting at the table waiting for us. We were 30 minutes late, but the host made no problem of that and directed us to our table. As more of our friends joined our table, we ended up having 17 guests- we did not plan for that many people to show up! The manager and two other employees were so kind and made accommodations so everyone could have a seat. It was also nice of the server to periodically check in on our group to collect additional orders/ to make sure everyone had everything we needed. When it was time to close out the tab, our server flawlessly split our bills per person (it was a surprise everyone remembered what they ordered). To summarize: food was great (the buffalo chicken flatbread was our favorite), service was even better. We would love to do this again! I received positive feedback from everyone.

We double checked and simply told her that it expired 2018 and the reason for the decline was because of the scratches and asked if she could type the card number in. She did not like this request what so ever, but followed through with it anyway. The waitress came back to the table and pretty much threw the check at the member of my group while telling her to have a good night (So thoughtful right?).

I took off a star because their trivia seating policy feels like a little much to me.  Since you can only be seated once five people have arrived, a group of four of us stood around for about 20 minutes, waiting for our fifth friend to arrive.  This whole time, there were a TON of open tables, we were super hungry, and I bet we would have ordered an additional round of drinks if we had been able to sit sooner.  The bar did fill up eventually, so I see why the rule exists, but I think it could be relaxed a bit (e.g. let groups of 3-4 people sit down or something like that).  This would also allow staff to start serving people sooner.  Our waitress was very kind, but the service was a bit slow once the bar filled up and trivia started.",0.9792,0.83,0.17,0.0,0.5542397660818715

2016-11-02,1.0,"Large space, dozens of TVs, good food, good beer selection, great trivia. So why the one star? Because I've never seen a bar or restaurant with more pointless, arbitrary, frustrating, mind-numingly stupid rules than this one. I've also never seen a bar or restaurant lie to its customers.  I came to State for Game 6 of the World Series on Tuesday. Before leaving, I asked if I could make a reservation for Game 7 on Wednesday. The hostess said that I could but not until 10 a.m. on Wednesday morning.  Why that was a rule, I have no idea. So, what do I do? I call State at 10 a.m. to make a reservation for a party of eight. No one answers. I call again and again, as do two other people in my group. No one answers. One friend leaves a voicemail and sends an email. No response. I send a Facebook message. No response. We try again and again throughout the morning. Well, I just called the restaurant again and got a recording saying that no more reservations were being accepted but that half the restaurant was still available for first-come, first-serve seating. ... Thanks, State. Thanks for your absolutely horrible customer service and for lying to loyal customers who frequent your establishment on a regular basis. As for Tuesday trivia: If you don't have many friends, this is the place for you. That's because State won't allow parties of five or more to be seated unless the entire group is present. Well, guess what, State? Some people actually work and have jobs, and it's not always easy for the schedules of 6-8 different people to magically align, especially when they are coming straight from work in different areas of the city/suburbs. Because I live in Lincoln Park and my schedule is usually flexible, I showed up to trivia over an hour early one night to get a table for our large group, as everyone else was coming straight from work and wouldn't be able to arrive until right around 8, when trivia starts. Although the restaurant was basically empty, I was denied seating because my entire party was not present. After 45 minutes of standing and waiting, I was forced to lie to the hostess and claim that, as it turns out, we would only have four people in our group. I was seated immediately and then snagged chairs from surrounding tables to accommodate my group of six because heaven forbid State do that for me. Bottom line? If you're job-less, friend-less, and don't mind having your plans thwarted by lies and tyrannical nonsense, this is the place for you. If not, you may want to find a spot that's a little less customer-unfriendly. There are plenty of places in Chicago that would be happy to help you give them your money.

It's an awesome deal for a week night and one we will definitely take advantage of again.  They always have some kind of drink special going on which is also a plus. Their salads are great, but their pita's are actually my favorite. The menu is large, so everyone will be able to find something.

2016-02-29,5.0,"I don't normally review bars and most nightlife, but State deserves one. I've been here numerous times throughout college (DePaul) and I still come back for a number of reasons. Their food is solid. I remember years ago that their offerings were more gourmet and it slowly changed to more standard bar food. While I preferred the former, their food is still enjoyable. I recently came Friday evening with my boo and majority of their food items were $6.99. Most places don't offer deals on a Friday. I got the stuffed bleu arugula burger with tots and it was good. Of course I've had better burgers elsewhere, but in relative to other bars and value for your money, State is where it's at. They also have a sizeable selection of beer that's on tap, which is a big plus. I recall they have 4-5 amber/reds (my fave) in which most places only usually have the one option. I've never had a problem with service, contrary to other reviewers. All have been quite good. At this recent visit, we were checked on regularly and they were able to change the channel for us on a nearby screen without a problem. What's best about State is the sports aspect of it, in that they for sure are not short of screens. I always worry when at a bar that I won't have a seat or view to catch whatever game that is on. Not an issue here, as everywhere you turn, you will be in plain sight of a tv screen...even in the washroom! For the ladies, there is a screen upon entering and as I hear, the guys had screens above the urinals. I hate missing a second of a game, so I really appreciate this. Another extra plus for State is that they make boxing fans, like myself, very happy. They've always aired the big boxing matches (e.g. Mayweather and Pacquiao matches) for FREE. Many might think that this is customary, but most bars will charge a cover for such fights since they are PPV. They've also been awesome in coordinating past fundraisers/guest bartending with various school groups. Overall, State imo is the best sports bar in Chi-city. I can come and be part of the crowd for a big game or enjoy a solid meal on a quieter evening that will leave me more money to spend on beeeeeer. **On another occasion, their service was exceptional. It was a warm evening so the windows were open. All of a sudden, we noticed a fly flew into my glass of beer that was half full. We weren't even going to bring it up as it wasn't a big deal especially as it wasn't State's fault. However, our waiter noticed us chatting about it and was deeply apologetic. A manager promptly came over, comps our beer, gives us a new one, free shots, and a gift card.

I'll probably be going back every week just for this. If free stuff doesn't appeal to you, they have mediocrely-priced pitchers and mixed drinks to distract you.

The Rock Shrimp was pretty tasty, but not as crunchy as I had hoped but the flavor was pretty good.

I have never written a yelp review, but the reason I am writing for this place is because with the high cost of the food the orders should be much more consistent.  I have ordered takeout from them 3 times. The first time my $12 sandwich was supposed to come with fruit. When I got home there was no fruit. I called and they apologized and said I could get a side free next time. I had changed my sandwich bread from ""ancient grain bread"" to white bread. It was amazing. And of course the mac n' cheese was amazing. The next time I just ordered the mac n' cheese. When I got home it looked like they had barely given me any. The size of the order was much smaller than last time but I paid the same amount...almost $14.  The last time I picked up from them, I ordered the same sandwich as the first time and the mac n' cheese. The guy asked me what side I wanted and it came with fries. I told him the website said fruit, and I was told I'd get free fruit for last times mistake. He told me the website was wrong, and its fries. I would have to pay a fee of $3 to get fruit?? What?? I also requested the bread be white. When I got home, I saw they gave me some rye/sourdough bread that is so tiny it made my sandwich smaller than a homemade deli one.   And again, my mac n'cheese portion was tiny!

I came by this past Saturday to meet some friends and catch up while watching some of the college football championship/rivalry games.  If you show up with a group of 6-10 peeps, the booths and large tables here are pretty sweet to watch a game.  And if you think $12 for a 32-ounce Coors Light is the way to burn through a day of drinking, this is your spot.  We tried the Queso Fundido and the buffalo-wing sauce/bleu cheese tater tots; the queso was an epic fail (almost completely tasteless but it's a big skillet of cheese) but the tots weren't too bad.  We also had a $12 cocktail that was pink, fruity, full of grenadine, vodka, Red Bull and lemonade; bleh.

She was fantastic (didn't catch her name...), and alerted us to the $5 entree (anything on the menu with a few exceptions) with the purchase of an alcoholic beverage. The food was great. The four hummus appetizer was delicious, and when I asked for extra cucumbers, I received easily two to three full cucumbers' worth. Unnecessary, but generous, and I'll take it (it was a lot of hummus). The tuna tartare was fresh and mild, and the chicken pita was delicious. Fries on a sandwich? Slathered in tatziki sauce? Yum.  There was a chip in the rim of my glass, which, as a veteran server, I know is a totally normal, accidental occurrence. If someone catches it before it hits the table, great, if not, well, we're human and something like that can be hard to see, especially in a dimly lit restaurant. I alerted her to it so she could throw it away and was simply expecting a new beer (I hadn't drank that much yet anyway). End of story. Instead I was greeted by a manager who offered a very kind and generous compensation. It was an accident, and their handling of a mild situation was out of this world.  Too often people who dine out make something out of nothing, generally to get a free meal. Most people need to realize that accidents and mistakes in restaurants happen. Humans serve your food, not robots. And this wasn't even our server's fault. It was probably another overzealous glass's fault. This was the most exceptional handling of a benign situation I have ever experienced.  I know that I can count on State's quality and genuine desire to provide their diners the best possible experience. And delicious food.

2013-11-04,3.0,"State is just fine.  Speaking for the restaurant aspect of the place, I mean. The atmosphere is that of an upscale and trendy bar, but the food is pretty average.  I came here for brunch with my boyfriend after a night out and enjoyed a solid hangover meal. We had the chorizo omelette and the corned beef hash with two juices. The chorizo omelette was pretty delicious, but I wouldn't recommend the corned beef hash at all.  The beef is cubed instead of ground and there is lots of fatty gristle in there which makes it pretty hard to eat.  Also, this not only goes for State, but can restaurants please stop serving fried potatoes in place of hashbrowns?  I think some nice crispy hashbrowns would have made my meal a lot more enjoyable.   Anyway, I think I just ordered the wrong thing, I think State is definitely worth a try!",0.9868,0.696,0.241,0.063,0.6849537037037037

The walls are mounted with multiple tvs and the interior is very modern. This seems like a great place to catch a sporting event. I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation and flavors of the brunch served. My chorizo omelette was spiced well and filled with cheese making it savory and hearty. The potatoes served here are so crispy definitely some of the best I've ever had. My girlfriend's corned beef hash had good flavor but the beef was in chunks, not ground. Some pieces were very fatty and it felt like I was chewing gum at times. Definitely not a satisfying texture. However the rest of the brunch was on point and the service was excellent.

I pay for my drink (2 minutes after last call) and I am immediately, and fiendishly, being yelled at by the bouncers to exit the bar.

I like to give the benefit of the doubt, but I specifically made a yelp account in order to adequately express how badly we were treated last night at State. It was truly the worst customer service experience I have ever had. PLEASE READ THIS, it will save you from ruining an evening. We got to State late in the evening after a party, and went to the bar to get drinks. No sooner had we been sold our overpriced drinks (I am talking 60 seconds after I finished paying, and with no warning) the bar announces that it is closing and a bouncer comes over to kick us out. Mind you, we were not drunk or argumentative, and we tried to quickly (although admittedly grumpily) finish our drinks (which I remind you, we had been handed not but 2 minutes prior). Here is where it gets ugly.  At closing, one bouncer, whose name I wish I knew (large bald caucasian man) may have been the rudest person I have ever encountered. He came up to me and told me to ""stop talking and start drinking so that I could get out"" and yelled ""c'mon c'mon c'mon"" in our faces as we tried to swig the drinks that we were just sold.  He literally shooed us like birds as we put on our coats and prepared to leave. He herded us (all grown adults, mind you) like cattle to the door, and told us that our purchases were not his problem, and neither was our customer satisfaction. This man never even approached the situation from a polite or even neutral perspective, but was immediately confrontational, and treated us with extreme disrespect.  Now, I understand, closing is closing, but the fact that last call is even allowed to occur such that patrons only have time to pay for a drink, but not to consume it, is bad practice. I have never been treated with such nastiness and disrespect in a place of business, and I strongly urge you to take your patronage LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE.   Signed,  Disrespected and Dissatisfied",-0.933,0.731,0.12,0.149,0.5909774436090225

Plus the $5 Friday deals are amazing. -Great selection of beer and liquor. I'm not a beer drinker, but they have a ton of beers on tap. Every time I've ordered a drink with liquor from State, they've made it perfectly. They don't overpour to where the drink tastes bad, and they don't underpour so you only taste your mixer. -Great place to watch any sporting event. There are TVs everywhere you look. Not a bad seat in the house, even if you want to watch a big game and the bar is crowded. -Staff is friendly and attentive. Waitresses are constantly checking to see if you need anything. All staff members are always friendly and helpful. Good service even when the bar is super crowded. Cons: -This is a meathead, frat boy haven. Try counting how many times you hear the words ""bro"" or ""dude"" throughout the night. It gets old quickly. No one cares that you're VP of your fraternity, dudebro. -The crowd is really young--bordering on underage.

2013-09-13,1.0,"My girlfriend purchased a Living Social Deal- $25 for 2 flights of beer and sliders, for use on a Thursday only. I'm normally not the type to buy groupons/living social deals like this, but I'm always down to check out a new place so I went along. First walked in, place was busy. They have a ""special"" menu for the deal, but it was essentially any of their pre-selected flights as well as any 6 of the sliders you want. Beer selection was very good. I'm a huge craft beer buff. I've been to breweries from Delaware to California. Alaska to Florida. I've been to most of the major craft beer bars in Chicago. Their selection, while very good, didn't have anything that got me overly excited to try.  The sliders were surprisingly tasty and good sized for the deal. I was expecting something much smaller so we ordered some extra food (rock shrimp appetizer), which was battered well and had a sort of sweet/sour/spicy sauce on them. I quite enjoyed the shrimp as well. All in all, it as a pretty good experience until we got the bill. I would have normally given this place 4 stars (3.5 if I could, but it was closer to 4 then 3). It was a little loud and busy for me, but otherwise, very solid. The way they charge this deal is by ringing it in at $52, marking 18% gratuity on the bill, taxing it, and then comping $52. I'm not cheap. I actually bartend and have managed in a restaurant myself. I know how it is. When things are done incorrectly though, it bugs me. I know why they are doing this - certain people using these deals tend to be cheap, and the servers want to get a decent tip on the full ""value"" of the meal they are serving. I used to manage a restaurant and I get that, we had done similar deals before ourselves. The problem is, you get taxed on $52. We didn't purchase something that cost $52, we purchased something that cost $25.  Furthermore, while out of practice I totally do tip on the full value (we actually left a few dollars more than the 18% since service was good and I usually tip more than 18%), that's just not the way it's done. If you offered a $3 beer special that was normally $6, and me and some buddies came in and drank 20 beers total, you wouldn't charge us tax on $120 and you wouldn't put the gratuity on $120. It's a $60 tab and if you add gratuity and tax, you do it on $60. Honestly I've never seen a restaurant do it like this before. It's either an incorrectly worded/advertised deal, or it's rung in incorrectly. In the end, there's plenty of other bars in the city with food/beer that is as good that I didn't feel like are trying to nickle and dime me and over charge me.

That's why I didn't come over here as much"". That IS NOT an excuse. We are customers and should be treated as such!  Anyways, State as redeeming qualities. It IS a decent sports bar. Awesome place to watch the game. TVs everywhere. Also, you really can't beat 1/2 off wines and $5.00 food plates on Wednesdays. The manager was super nice and it was nice of him to comp us. The seating is GREAT for large groups.  Despite this experience, I'll probably be back.",0.988,0.831,0.126,0.043,0.4471428571428571

I'm really horrible at trivia,but when in Rome...do as the Romans do and play trivia.  They had 7 different categories with 7 different questions in each, with categories like sports, history, entertainment, music...pretty basic trivia questions.  It was free to join with an $800 cash prize. But the best part of trivia night was definitely the raffle at the end.  Everyone that played got a raffle ticket.  They raffled off awesome prizes like Sony noise cancelling headphones, a power juicer, blue ray players....for a random Tuesday night, some people walked away with great stuff! Okay back to the actual restaurant.  They had a great beer list with pretty decent descriptions of every beer there...so it's a cool place to go to try something you've never had before.  We got a large pitcher of 312 for $18.  The food was pretty middle of the road. I'd come here on their $5 night if I wanted to try out more of the menu.  The appetizers selection was great, but the rest of the menu was a little lacking.  I got the fish taco appetizer.

They have a crap load of t.v.s, but they also do my pet peeve; play awful music during commercial breaks (I don't know why I just hate it). I've never had bad service there, I don't remember it being world class but I've never had a complaint. The food is very food. While there on Sunday, I had the quinoa salad, which was huge but good. I also had the French onion soup, again good but I wasn't expecting that big of a portion, but man was it good! I am not complaining about the size, I just wouldn't have ordered so much. But I got to bring the salad to work Monday. I've also had some of their sandwiches and Panini's, which are always good. They also have a pretty large tap beer selection. I am not a big beer guy, so a lot of the stuff there, I can't really write about. But they also have a decent selection of booze, which is nice.  Yes, its close to DePaul, yes students go there but it's not like McGee's! Lot of tight t-shirts and spiky hair, you know times can be douchey (is that a word?).

2013-02-25,4.0,"Simply referred to as State, is an upscale bar located right on DePaul campus where you'll find a great mix of young professionals and college students. With an identity of a sports bar, State has a full menu that competes with popular all American restaurants in quality and price.  Even though restaurant is in its name, it'll probably won't be your top choice for dinner. Instead, it's most likely that you'll be meeting a group of friends for drinks or to watch the game. But because it's more than a typical sports bar, the food and beer selection is much better than what you would normally expect. After several rounds, you can't help but order something to munch on. Popular items are  1/2 pound burgers on a pretzel roll, sweet potato fries, and flatbreads. It was a Thursday night so they had $5 deals on burgers and all drafts with an extensive menu featuring well over 50 types of beers.  For only $5, I tried several that I've never heard of or seen before. Much better than your typical overpriced Miller products that you would expect from bars in the area. For the location, State does an excellent job of offering what you want without the added premium - at least for the weekdays.

Awesome for the sports fan and what's even better is the big board that has all the latest lines and odds. 100% the place to go if you're a sports fan.

I love how spacious the restaurant is and the booths are huge. Also there are TVs EVERYWHERE - on the walls, by the bar, in the restrooms (which are surprisingly nice)... The food was way better than I was expecting from a DePaul-area sports bar; try the parmesan crusted tilapia and the truffle mac 'n' cheese bites, skip the seafood pasta. The specialty cocktails also exceeded my expectations. Again, I wasn't expecting drinks served with orchids.  As another reviewer stated, Wednesday is a great day to come if you just want to give State a try. For $5 I doubt you'll leave disappointed.

We went with friends last weekend to use our Groupons that allowed 2 beer flights per person plus an entree per person.  The beer flights are great and they've got a nice menu that pairs wheats and ciders or seasonal ales and all sorts of various combinations.  Aside from the flights, the beer menu is extensive and they have something for everyone. I wouldn't recommend going here just for the food, but if you happen to be drinking there or watching the game and feel like a bite, they have a pretty good offering.  I went with the ahi tuna entree which was dismal.  The tuna was overcooked and sliced too thick and the sauce was overly sweet and overpowering.  The brussel sprouts were charred nicely though, and the broccoli was seasoned well and fresh. My fiance got the bbq flatbread, which is gigantic and easily enough for two people.  He enjoyed it quite a bit and my friends enjoyed their Chicago burger and mac and cheese. Definitely a great place to go for a big game, a friendly atmosphere, clean enough that you would eat there but not so stuffy that you would feel awkward wearing a jersey and flip flops.",0.9958,0.712,0.244,0.044,0.5595610119047618

2012-11-03,2.0,"Fooled me twice, shame on me.  I really, really want to love this place.  Its close to home, it has a great beer selection and its nice looking inside.  But I think they have some sort of identity crisis going on.  The decor looks like a moderately upscale restaurant, and the sharply dressed hostesses and waitstaff reinforce that.  But the hundreds of TVs showing all the sports say college sports bar.  All that, while odd, is just a ""meh, whatever"" for me.  BUT, where I really have to take issue is with the food.  The menu has all kinds of really terrific sounding options, and we have been there twice now and tried four apps, four entrees and two desserts.   The chicken wings were pretty good, and the calamari was light but really, really bland. The mussels were huge and super fishy tasting.  I could smell them from across the table and it wasn't nice!  I was really jazzed to try the Truffle Mac N Cheese balls with Bacon Aoli.  They were crisp, piping hot and....mealy.  Super weird soft/grainy texture, with no discernible pasta base at all. The two fish entrees the spouse tried were both, in his words, average, not bad, not great.  I had the pork belly sandwich (overly complicated and gamey) and the BBQ half chicken.  The chicken looked absolutely beautiful but was so dry it made me thirsty just looking at it.  The risotto cake it was served on had a nice texture, but the flavor was just..odd.  I ended up leaving a large meal that I had hoped to split between dinner and lunch the next day.  Desserts:  Here I have nice things to say.  BEST skillet cookie I have ever had....and I've had a few.  The raspberry tiramisu was pretty good.  Not a lot of flavor but the mascarpone was very creamy. Here's my assessment in a nutshell.  I think someone read some descriptions of food from other places, and said ""I can make that"" and assembled them on their own.  Then they sent them out to tables without ever tasting them first to see if they were any good.   My advice to them, if they care at all, is this: Simplify your menu and do basic foods right.  Skip the cilantro in the sweet corn, it doesn't work.  Do fewer upscale twists, nobody really wants goat cheese and honey on a burger.  Decide who you are...if you're a college bar at heart, adapt the menu accordingly and stop pretending to be fancy.

First of all, I actually know a few answers - it's not the kind of trivia that you have to be a complete Wikipedia nerd to excel at.  Still, don't plan on winning against the 70 or so other teams - it just won't happen.  Second, they have their very large and intense trivia crowd down to an art.  Service is speedy, paying at the end of the night is seamless, and they don't dilly dally with the trivia questions.  Also, the food is awesome.  I've had burgers and salads, all of which are better than your average bar food.  And we also indulge in the delicious chips and guac from time to time!",0.9822,0.744,0.221,0.035,0.5054928989139515

Second, it isn't ""trivia.""  It's more like ""questions from this week's edition of 'People' or 'Us Weekly'.""  The host appears to fancy himself as a glorified Ryan Seacrest (and I mean this in the worst way possible) who dresses himself and his minions up in suits to ask a bunch of obnoxious celebrity questions like ""who is older, Jennifer Aniston or Courteney Cox.""  I am not making this up.

Granted, every single TV was showing the fight, so there was never a bad view. But, I couldn't get over the nightclub feel personally.  There was a decent beer list, but nothing that would make me really notice in all honesty. Fairly standard fare of some major craft brews and normal macro taps.

Their Santa Fe Chicken and State Chicken sandwiches- both extremely popular dishes, was nothing to write home about. I regret I didn't stick with a salad.

While we certainly didn't expect some effusive greeting, a simple ""have a great night, thanks for dining in"" would have sufficed.  The 50+ TVs in this place, also distracts from the dining experience. While I am sure this is great for sports fanatics, its pretty jarring for those who are just trying to grab food and drinks.

I was surprised to see that they also do bottle service at the surrounding tables (but of course it's exorbitantly overpriced as usual, at roughly $200-$300/bottle). However, when we walked in, a girl gave us each a drink ticket for giving them our emails. For the most part, love the food menu here, and the wait staff is definitely efficient. Good bartenders too; word to the wise, you should try and get their premium beers since it wasn't too much different on prices from their domestic beers (a difference of a $1 for most). There are also jacket-wearing security guys, which I normally hate, but I can appreciate that they're all wearing matching outfits that look classier rather than obnoxious (plus they are probably the most laidback guys, and they act graciously, pretty much just to kick a person out for doing something stupid every now and then).",0.9875,0.748,0.197,0.055,0.4713369963369963

State had some blue-purple lighting theme going on. As mentioned, the walls are lined with HDTVs.

Dripped grease, so you can imagine. Could smell the truffle oil in the meat and some on the fries! There was supposed to be bacon, but I didn't taste it much. It was all: meat, pretzel, meat, pretzel, truffle flavour heaven. The fries were thinly sliced, and probably lightly seasoned. They weren't plain potatoes, that's all. The whole dish was perfection. I was very hungry and thought I might need to order more, but actually finished with a quarter of the fries still left.

Loads of beers and a huge central zoo of a bar, State hosts an attractive trending towards douchebaggy clientele. The benefit of watching sports in an environment like this is that there are enough people and TVs to make going seem kind of like an event. Bathroom attendants. At a sports bar. So, yeah.

2012-04-13,4.0,"I hate to love State. Its overall way too loud, too young, too dark, and my bill is usually too high, but I can't help it! Many Sunday mornings, my football-loving girlfriend and I have wracked our brains trying to pick a Lincoln Park bar that shows both Ravens and Giants football, offers a substantial salad menu, doesn't smell like vomit and beer from the night before, and offers reasonable sunlight exposure. All we can come up with is State. It's McGees's rich kid next door neighbor where wobbly tables, confetti cannons, watery scrambled egg buffets, and toddlers are banned. I also hate to admit that I love the dance music played during commercials. The highlight of our football season was finally making it to one of the front window booths with dedicated tv. Its spacious, bright, and no one can block your view. Its definitely the way to go. The Sunday scene at State is very different from Tuesday Trivia and $5 Fridays. The 50 tvs are turned on, but the focus is more about the dining, drinking, and mingling with friends.  I recently went to State for the $5 menu night. Everyone at our table was giddy with ordering whatever they wanted for $5 plus a beverage. Our group started with the Shrimp Ceviche and Upside Down Nachos. No complaints whatsoever. The Ceviche was surprisingly authentic and freshly tangy. Given no need to consider price, everyone had their pick of entrees from salad, pasta, toasts, burgers, etc. The Asian Chicken Salad had pretty standard ingredients, but was a good portion and very fresh. The Jambalaya pasta is spicier than expected, but still  creamy and delicious. The Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna is my friend's favorite. Its savory and of gourmet quality that merits its $17 price tag, but its a steal on $5 night! The toasts and burgers are always spot on. The Quinoa Salad is a group favorite and a big enough portion to share. Its certainly a very unique and deliciously nutritious dish for a sports bar. Get the dressing on the side for a healthier meal. Beware of the 450 calories or less menu. Its a calorie and price rip off. The wraps are basically the size of an egg roll with nothing on the side. My girlfriend and I finished our Spicy Chipotle Shrimp  and Grilled Chicken wraps in two bites, got ""hangry,"" and then ordered sweet potato fries. State's lighter fare and salad menu is very healthy and delicious. State also allows healthy substitutions to its unhealthy options e.g. lettuce instead of buns, side salads instead of friends, etc. Unfortunately, State can get impossibly crowded and doesn't really offer drink specials when people would actually want them. Most of the specials are on the food. Since the food is so good, I won't complain. My love-hate relationship with State is really more love. I'm just bitter that when State is packed, I have to go to McGees to sip my coffee at a wobbly corner table surrounded by toddlers and confetti cannon shrapnel.",0.997,0.726,0.191,0.083,0.5695555555555555

Other weekday nights - Since I'm such a fan of Wednesday, I don't make it on other week nights too often.  I have been to play trivia before and remember they had some great prizes, I think they gave away a Wii.  There tends to be good drink specials during the week as well. Weekend Days - 3 stars - State has a ton of TVs, all HD.  This makes it an ideal place to watch sports. Weekend nights - 1 star- On the weekends this place turns into douche bag central.  The place gets over packed with the kind of guys that muscles that are going useful to look at.  Dance floor break out where table were earlier, the placement always seems awkward. The drink specials disappear and you have to elbow your way to the bar to wait for an overpriced drink. It's not that I don't like State, I do but only on certain days.  If everyday was Wednesday, they would be sitting at 5 stars but I think I owe it to the Yelp community to includes all personalities of the bar.

My friend ordered a fancy drink of champagne and liquor mixed with fruit juice which had cherries at the bottom, melons floating on top, and had a real flower hanging off the side.  It definitely put us in a tropical mood.  No one had any complaints about their burgers or wraps. The only thing I was disappointed in was the size of the appetizer I ordered (which may have just been my fault in not reading the menu close enough).  I ordered the tomato and mozzarella lettuce wraps which came as a section of balsamic vinaigrette-soaked cherry tomato and mozzarella balls next to a pile of lettuce leaves. It was tasty, but not nearly enough. Stick to the burgers and fries. Our overall bill was less than $200 for ten people, so it is reasonable.  The waitress informed us she could only charge up to three credit cards, so be aware of this if you do go in a group.

The only downside is that it can be a little pricey, but apparently they run different deals everyday, so I'll definitely be back. Two friends and I showed up around 7:00 on a Tuesday (which I quickly learned was trivia night). We must have gotten there at just the right time because the place quickly filled up after we were seated. I'm not sure what I was expecting in terms of decor or vibe, but the restaurant is very modern and trendy. Definitely more sleek and sophisticated than I would have thought based on some of the other restaurants/bars in the area. Our server greeted us right away, and we ordered the spinach dip appetizer to share, and I ordered the truffle mac & cheese as my entree. The menu was large and pretty vegetarian-friendly, and even had a list of options for less than 450 calories.  Our appetizer was out really quickly, and our server was very attentive and available, even though the restaurant was quite busy. As for the food, it was just all-around awesome. We were able to get the spinach dip without bacon, and it came with both chips and sliced soft pita bread, so it was nice to have a little variety. There were large chunks of artichokes in it, and as a spinach dip aficionado, I'd rank it high among my favorites. But the mac & cheese is just phenomenal. Again, they had no problems doing it without the bacon, and the entree came out just as creamy and decadent as I was hoping. The pasta was perfectly cooked spiral noodles and the sauce was luscious, rich, and smooth without being greasy. The dish came topped with crumbled garlic croutons and a generous helping of chopped green onion, which was perfect to cut through the richness of the cheese. Not to mention, it was a huge bowl of pasta-- I ate maybe 1/3 of it and still had a ton leftover for lunch the next day. It's tough to justify shelling out $14 for mac & cheese (without any meat), but I'd definitely do it again. My friend had a burger which she raved about, and I tried a couple of the thin-cut french fries that came with it-- they were amazing. Great food, great service, and a ton of variety on the menu?

There is a very large menu offering a wide variety of food from burgers to salads to specialty entrees (Sesame-Crusted Ahi Tuna, Barbecue pork shank). Over the course of finding myself eating here I end up dissatisfied either with the food, the service or both.  One particular night I ordered the ""OH MY"" Burger. It was Black Angus patty topped with apple wood smoked bacon and smoked ham. Topped with melted Gouda cheese, fried egg and grilled onion, served on a pretzel bun. The place was empty at 10pm on a weeknight. The food took a while to come (which was fine I am patient if the food is good) and without warning my entrée came on sesame seed bun (saying they were out of Pretzel buns AFTER giving me the food) and looked burned (I ordered it done medium). I re-ordered (something I never do) because the other member of my group got the wrong food and I felt it would be awkward to be finished before her food came out. I then ordered the Barbecue pork shank ($24) hoping for better luck. We then proceeded to wait for 45 minutes for our next meal to come out. When it arrived the sweet potato fries were black, burned to a crisp and tasted like charcoal, my pork shank was a great first bite. Then I got further in realizing it was still very cold on the inside. Not just lukewarm, it felt like ice. The center bone felt like a Popsicle. We got the ""manager"" at the time, who was conveniently close by obnoxiously and unprofessionally taking shots with the table next to us.

With the nachos, they've started putting the ""fillings"" on the bottom and the chips on top. I asked for the pulled chicken version but there was no chicken to be seen. When we dug under the chips it was just a congealed mess of melted cheese and hidden jalapenos. Not very impressive. The wings were somewhat better but just a borderline value at $5. The BBQ sauce was good but the ratio of ""drums"" to other pieces was not great and there was not a ton of wings on the plate. Drink quality was also inconsistent. One drink was good, the next one was extremely watered down. Everyone in our party sent back at least one drink during our visit.  Entrees were good sized but bland. I had the Southwest Chicken Salad. Plenty of ""stuff"" in the salad but the dressing was gloppy and bland. The server was very nice but disappeared for long stretches.

I heard that the food was good from one of the other guys in the group.  Many of us got burgers and found them to be severely bland and underseasoned.  I'd go so far as to call mine one of the most tasteless burgers I've ever eaten.  It's a real shame because some proper seasoning could easily make these great because they were technically cooked properly and clean (i.e., not dripping with grease all over the place).  Don't bother coming here for food. One other issue I had was with our seating arrangement.  When we got in, the place was maybe 25% full with a ton of empty tables, yet they seated our group of 11 at one square table.  I was off the corner eating on my lap just so that the others around me could eat on the table.  Even by the time we left, the place was only about half full, so I don't understand why they decided to put us there when they could have easily combined a few of the other tables near us. We didn't have any issues with service and found that our servers were attentive in filling up our glasses.  They also gave us a round of shots on the house before we left since it was a bachelor party. Update: Following this review, a customer service rep followed up with me and offered a deal to come in again with the promise of better food, and apologizing for the seating arrangement issue above.  I'm not taking them up on the offer simply because I'm in Michigan and would rather try new places when I'm in town, but I'm glad to see they care about their customers.",0.9885,0.833,0.129,0.038,0.4910851714423143

A friend and I dined here on Friday night and we were REALLY impressed. The vibe was way different than my first visit & we were really excited to find out (just about) everything on the menu was $5 with the purchase of a beverage. Our server informed us that she was training but she was very knowledgeable and if she wouldn't have told us (I appreciate the honesty), I would have thought she worked there for years. We started off with some drinks- I had the watermelon cooler, which was yummy, and my friend had a lemon drop martini- while browsing the menu. I wanted to order about 10 things but we decided on 3. When the food arrived, I was happy we didn't order the entire menu like I wanted to. Everything looked great and tasted amazing! The truffle mac & cheese lollipops were unbelievably good and I think I will crave them every day for the rest of my life! The capri flatbread was terrific and huge!! Mmm and the upside down nachos w/chicken were oh so good! We weren't able to finish everything but I wanted to because it was all so delicious! After dinner we both ordered another drink- the state martini. It arrived in a tall pilsner type glass adorned with a fresh flower and floating peaches & cherries. It almost looked too good to drink... almost. I'm a big fan of martinis containing champagne so I adored this drink. At $14 a glass, it's not going to become the drink I order every single time I go there but it does rank up there as one of my favorite cocktails of all time (everyone has a list like that right?).

Mixed drinks were outright lousy. Despite having lots, it was hard to get drunk with such a weak pour. Probably better off getting beer if you plan on drinking.

Service is always horrible, wait times all over the place, and food is hit or miss (somethings have been delicious others I wouldnt take home to my dogs). They have lots of tv's and alcohol so it is a good place to go with a group of friends after work. So, then how did we get to the 1 star review? My hubs and I were trying to eat healthier etc. and hadnt been going to state as often. A few weeks ago on a thursday we went with a friend and ordered drinks and food. Fast forward to the bill and only the food was 1/2 off. If any of you have been to state in the last year or so on a thursday you will know that the deal used to be that all food and drink was 1/2 off on thursdays. However, apparently they had changed the 1/2 deal to only apply to food a couple weeks earlier. OK- well no one told us, it wasnt on the menu with the specials, it wasnt on the signs in the window, the hostess didnt mention it and when I questioned the server she actually said ""I will check"" and came back mumbling about how the policy had changed. I would have been fine paying full price for the alcohol had I not felt they were trying to hide the fact that the policy had changed. After talking to the manager she took some money off of the bill but was SUPER SUPER rude about it. When I suggested that the servers mention it when they come to the table she actually said that wasnt a feasible option. UM OK?

Due to it's convenient location, fun crowd, good music, large, elevated booths, ambience, tons and tons of tvs, I'd say this has to be my favorite bar in the DePaul campus area.

2011-02-07,4.0,"When you step through the double doors of State, you had better be prepared for a blitzkrieg on your senses of sight and sound.  I walked in and was immediately plowed over by its wall of sound.   We went to State after the first choice, McGee's, which The Weatherman said was supposedly the place to be for Sunday football, was completely dead.  Nobody was at the tables, and there were maybe 15 people at the bar.  Yet, they were asking $30 for food and drink.  I don't think so.  I was reluctant to go to McGee's anyway, as it's a college bar in my eyes. So off we went to State and procured three seats at the almost entirely open bar.  Nobody was out to watch the Super Bowl anywhere this year.  The tables all seemed to be pretty well packed, but nobody was standing around to watch.  I didn't think this was so bad, so we remained at State for the first half of the game.   I was surprised at how clean State was.  The place is actually pretty nice for a sports bar.  I'd say it's a bit more upscale than their Four Corners rivals.  Even the bathroom was nice, with plenty of stalls and urinals.  They get five stars on the general cleanliness and bathrooms. Two of us ended up ordering the sliders.  You get three for $10.  Fries are not included.  That's a flat out rip off.  The sliders are passable, but they're certainly not as good as PJ's.  For a ten dollar sticker price, State needs to throw in fries for free.  I never want to see more white plate than food.   Obviously, the most memorable thing about State is the blitzkrieg assault on your senses by the televisions, the sound and, for me, the blowers up in the ceiling.  The televisions are ubiquitous and at every possible angle.  Should you decide to fall down and puke on yourself, you're going to have a television angled at you so you can not miss a snap, pitch or shift.  As for the blowers, it was like the Blizzard of 2011 Part Deux, as I had a clipper blowing straight down on me almost the entire time.  Don't these people know how hard it is to keep this hair perfect? The sound at State deserves its own paragraph.  As I stated earlier, it attacks you and bowls you over immediately upon entry.  The first thing I did after breaking the plane of the second door was point to my ears.  It's so loud, you cannot even hear the person sitting next to you.  It's so loud, appendages may shatter.  It's louder than the UC and Wrigley - combined.  It's just ridiculous, actually.  It's entirely too loud and totally unnecessary.  I guess the line of thinking at these places that blare the PA is that you'll drink more because you certainly aren't going to be able to communicate with anyone except by phone.  Turn.  It.  Down.   State is a good place to watch the game if you can avoid hearing loss from the obnoxious sound levels and seizures induced by the flashing televisions.  Bring shades and earplugs, and you'll be good to go. State is five stars for service and cleanliness, one star for the sound and three stars for the food because it's overpriced.  I'll give it 3-1/2 stars overall.",-0.3646,0.837,0.082,0.081,0.5246626984126983

2010-12-09,3.0,"I wear my sunglasses at night  So I can, so I can...  not mow some poor pedestrian down with my car.  I'm only slightly exaggerating when I say that this place has about 8 million TV's in every nook and cranny. Every time I drive by, the blinding glare from the TV's is absolutely ridiculous; if State had a glass roof, I have a strong suspicion you'd be able to see if from Mars.  The fact that they call this place a cafe is truly laughable. I can't think of one aspect that makes it cafe-like. I do give them kudos though for kicking it up a notch, aside from the TV's, this is not your average fratty sportsbar. They have a nice array of high and low tables, and booths. Sans TV's, it would actually have a sleek, almost lounge-like feel; too bad the contrast the bar's low lighting and the bright light of TV's creates is headache inducing.  So why did I come here (as this is clearly not my scene)? Three reasons: (1) the menu sounded appealing, (2) it was down the street from my next stop, and most importantly (3) half off all food and wine on Wednesdays.  My experience at State started off strong, very strong. Our server seated us and we were brought a basket of tasty pretzel dinner rolls. She even forewarned us that they were likely out of Gumballhead and guided us toward a backup selection. Sadly, while service remained friendly, the attentiveness took a nosedive faster than a Blue Angel at the Air & Water Show. We waited for at least 10 minutes while she and about 3 other servers chatted up a nearby table. We also waited a long time on our check; thankfully we had exact change or we'd likely have been impatiently searching for her again. It must be a job requirement that you have to be a petite brunette to work here, finding our server was like looking for a needle in a haystack!  Anyway, I ordered a hard cider and the Garden Burger. The burger was billed as a black bean burger with pepper jack and red pepper aioli. The latter two items were right, but my burger was not a black bean burger, but a run-of-the-mill, store bought, regular veggie burger - booooo! It was fine, but without the spice and kick of the black bean burger, it was boring; the red pepper aioli did nothing for the burger. At $10, they need to step it up; a lot. For my side, I upgraded to the State fries; my advice to you is to skip these. For $2 extra, I got a handful of feta, seasoning and some lemon juice thrown on top of some regular fries; hardly worth the extra dough.  Bottom line: You won't find me hurrying back here. Even at half price, $24 for two mediocre burgers and two beers, didn't seem like much of a deal. You definitely won't find me here on a weekend when it's trixie-chad central (I'd rather pour bleach in an open wound); however, on a slower sports weeknight, it's probably one of the better choices in the immediate vicinity.",0.972,0.875,0.087,0.038,0.47698341473341477

I think that the only thing that really made this place worth our time and money was the fact that the burgers were $5.99 and they offered sweet potato fries.  We came in on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. Actually, it was pretty damn dead. You'd think service would be swift, yes? You'd be sorely mistaken. Granted there were six of us but we all jumped on the burger deal, which are pretty easy orders (or so we thought). We waited for about 20 minutes after we ordered and then had to ask the manager about our food. With a completely unamused and expressionless tone, he explained that the waitress was new and he would see what was going on. He came back with the bill and actually took 10% off the total. That was thoughtful. But I almost felt like the apology was more so to just get us off their backs rather than being sincerely sorry about the delay. Again, was it just us? Definitely not, especially when we saw there were only 2 other tables eating at the same time. The fries were great--crispy and plentiful.

State is a nicely appointed establishment with a nice menu and occasionally great specials - particularly the $5 everything-on-the-menu Thursday special that is currently offered. I found the service to be expedient and polite, although it was hard to communicate with the waitress, as the music was too loud.  More on that later. The food, while good, is priced about 25% higher than it should be, based on the quality.  There are upscale choices on the menu, but the ingredients don't stand up to the taste test, and most dishes I sampled seemed to be rather bland and unexciting (I only tried items the last page of the menu).  The tater tots were good though. I found that the number of televisions on during dinner time is obnoxious - there is more light provided by the TV screens than by lamps in the restaurant.  It felt like I was at Best Buy.  Also, the music was at an obscenely high volume during the time I dined; I had to strain my voice just to be heard by the person sitting next to me. Don't get me started on the weekend nights here - the place is filled with drunken college students and underagers.  I don't recommend it. All in all, I feel this establishment has an identity crisis.  It tries to be a decent restaurant during dinner hours, but way too many TVs are on and the music is too loud.  At night, at least on weekend, it turns into a drunken college shi*t show.  Not exactly my scene, hence the rating.  Not sure why it's named ""State Restaurant & Cafe.""  Should be ""State Bar with seating that is laid out to make you think it's a restaurant and has a nicer menu than most, but it's still just a bar.""  Really rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Oh - one more thing.  They use 14oz ""pint"" glasses - the fake, down-sized beer glasses you'll find in some bars around the area.  This practice is disappointing, as you get less beer, but the prices remain the same.  Owners claim the glasses are ""standard,"" however they are not.  Check the links below for more information. tinyurl.com/2c9cwf7 online.wsj.com/public/ar…",0.7301,0.858,0.081,0.06,0.5239397639397639

They are there for your football pleasure. Our drinks were never empty and food was quick. 4) The huge flat screen in the girls bathroom.

I do know there have been several instances I've ended up here for one reason or another and have been welcomed to a totally chill and pretty groovy experience. Your bloody mary DIY bar on Sunday's is especially choice, as are those State Fries (deliciously crispy frites covered with feta cheese, garlic, oregano and lemon) and, of course, that frothy and fabulous Pumpkin Pie Martini that almost seems TOO GOOD to have ever been procured at a sports bar.  Then, there's also those times I've arrived on a - seriously swarming and surely over capacity - game day to cheer on my favorite team, only to be greeted by an intense level of douchebaggery so flagrant and unashamed it can only be categorized as repugnant. And therein lies the dilemma. Two very distinct ends of the social spectrum and not a whole lot of middle ground in between.     Is it a great place to catch a game despite the teeming throngs of fans? Well, yes, the energy is certainly undeniable and check any another Yelp review to quickly grasp the magnitude of the insane A/V set-up in this joint. True, the sheer overabundance of LCD's and Plasma at State is a little gratuitous, but one thing you can say with certainty is there ain't a bad seat in the house. Not even the toilet seat... yup, for your pottying convenience there's also a jumbo flat screen in the ladies loo. Boys? You'll have to report back and let me know.

2010-09-20,4.0,"*As a preface to this review I wanted to note that I am writing this both as a patron and also on behalf of my alumni association who recently hosted a party here* This past Saturday my college alumni chapter held a college football game watch at State Bar.  We broke up with our previous bar after about a year due to their poor service and understaffing issues and have been on the hunt ever since.  Our main criteria for a bar were a large space, ample television viewing, and a decent drink special.  We were expecting between 50-75 people with the possibilty that more would come in.  State Bar has all 3 and, after weighing out our options, we decided to go with them. For the most part, State Bar came through on everything.  The specials were clearly outlined for everyone's ease.  They had a fair amount of waitresses patrolling the floors and everyone seemed happy with the service.  They have over 100 TV's and, while not every screen was playing our game, everyone had a great view from wherever they were seated.  The staff was more than friendly and told us how great of a crowd we were.  They met all of our expectations and I would definitely hold another alumni event there. Since nothing is ever perfect, there could have been a couple changes.  Our package included unlimited domestic drafts during the time frame.  Instead of the drafts being in standard pint glasses, they were in smaller plastic cups (somewhere in between 8-12oz.) that were dedicated to the person.  It's sometimes a pain to run back up to the bar or wait for your waitress to come around to get a refill, and since our team was losing (horribly) the beer flowed faster and faster down people's throats.  The waitresses did do a great job of proactively trying to solve this problem by coming around with pitchers, but a pitcher only goes so far and it probably caused more running around than necessary.  Also, because of the layout and how people were dispersed, it was difficult for the staff to reach certain parts of the bar (namely, the raised level) easily, so those seated in the comfy booths sacrificed more timely service than those who were at the tables.  Fair trade, I suppose? On another note, I have been to this bar quite a few times as a normal customer, and have never had an issue.  Although the menu may seem a bit pricey at first glance, it should be noted that most of the menu isn't your typical ""bar food"" and many of the entrees are closer to the gourmet side.  I ordered a Southwest salad once and it was probably the biggest dinner salad I have ever seen.  I actually took half of it for leftovers and still had trouble finishing it.  That's a lot, especially for someone who can pound down the better part of a large pizza.  Also, if you stop in on Wednesday night, their entire menu is half off and they have half off bottles of wine, too.  Not a bad deal. I'll definitely be back and recommend this place.",0.9435,0.862,0.089,0.049,0.5100198412698412

My boyfriend and I came all the way to State from the west side because it was a BEAUTIFUL day.  It was the first day of the year that the weather pleasantly surprised us all with a 64 degree day.  We wanted to sit inside of a restaurant (hey it aint summer yet), but still be somewhat ""outside"".  State was the perfect choice, with their garage style windows that open all the way up.   Sure enough when we drove by, the windows were open and there was even a booth open and inviting us in!  Score. Unfortunately, the booth was reserved.  So we sat at the bar to have drinks as we bided our 35 minute wait time.  Meanwhile a couple with a young boy eventually sat at the empty booth.  We noticed the boy kept jumping outside of the window.  At this point, it has been an hour since we were told a 35 minute wait time, but it's all good!  We are drinking fabulous drinks, and munching on a yummy shrimp cocktail.   We are finally sat in our long awaited booth, when they shut the windows!  Apparently the little brat kid's parents asked them to shut the windows because they couldn't lay down the smackdown on their kid.  Just kidding.  I am really mad at the RESTAURANT because, hello, they weren't the only people in the restaurant.  Who reserves a window booth, then demands the windows shut, ruining it for all the other booths who share the window?  And what kind of restaurants oks that, when there is another table that has been waiting over an hour to sit at a window booth to enjoy the nice evening? Then they outright lied.  They said they would reopen the windows, but sure enough, after a lot of avoiding we got an honest busser to tell us that the manager was not going to open the windows.  They really thought that if they just kept TELLING us they were going to open the windows, we'd order food, then be stuck anyways.  WRONG!  We canceled our app order, and the lying manager had the nerve to tell us that we had to pay for the food we ordered. Um, suck it?  Why don't you pay me for the two hours I wasted, liar.

I told him that my gift certificate was NOT a promotion but rather pretty lame consolation for 1 week of throwing up (and had I gone to the hospital State would have been shut down for just as long). He claimed he remembered what happened to me yet the type of certificate I was given is a one time use.

2010-05-12,3.0,"I had to decide on three stars because its tuff to review this place because it really all depends on what day of the week you go and the intent of your evening. For example its a great place to watch any sports game during the week especially if it falls on a Wednesday. I was their last night (Tuesday) for the awesome Hawks game and the place was packed, but I never felt over crowed and our waitress made it seem like we were one of two tables instead of one of thirty tables. There are TV screens everywhere including the restroom so you will never miss a second of the game due to a drunk over-sized head stepping in your way. The $13.00 dollar pitcher special was also great.  On Wednesdays they have half off all food and wine bottles. The food at this place is much better then food you would expect at a sports bar. During the week there is a great mix of people which creates a great atmosphere for mingling.  I have also been to State for a Halloween celebration. They had a $30.00 all you can drink special. Again, given that it was Halloween and the place was packed I don't recall ever feeling crammed. However, the beer was served in a very small plastic cups. I am not sure if it was the intent of the bar to try and limit the amount of beer served by using the small cups, but it only contributed to the bar being jammed all night long. Overall it was still a blast and I would go back.  The one time I went to State and didn't enjoy myself was on a random Saturday night. I swear after walking in and looking around I entertained the idea of going back outside to make sure I had walked into the right bar. The entire atmosphere was different then the times I had remembered. The crowd was very young and half dressed or very over dressed for a sports bar. Don't get me wrong I love getting all dressed up on the weekend, but not typically for a sports bar lacking a dance floor. Oh and did I mention the crowd was very young including the group of girls camped out in the bathroom while they debated over who was going to take their puking friend home.  I would recommend this place for an sports event, but would caution you on the Saturday visit. Unless that's the night you are aiming to have.",0.9935,0.825,0.135,0.04,0.5040572977158344

The breaded mac and cheese bites. Holy calories, that shot was good. Another wow factor was the Bloody Mary bar. $7 for 2 oz of vodka and a full garden of crap to put in there. Peoples were stacking their drinks, it almost doubled the height of the glass. Crowd in the morning (11am -noon) was diverse. Families with kids, couples of all ages.

State is obviously built for DePaul kids who have plenty of their parents money to spend on food, booze, and gasoline for the SUV they received on their 18th birthday. The collection of massive televisions probably makes this a great place to watch football with the fratty types who grew up in Ohio and Michigan. I do happen to love football, but I don't happen to relate so well to the latter. Dudes in ""Affliction"" shirts just fan the flames of my self-righteous disposition. I can't help it. I'm judgmental. So be it. Oh, and the music is awful, and probably a little louder than it needs to be. (although maybe *I* just think it's too loud because *I* think It's bad. I mean, somebody likes this crap, otherwise they wouldn't be playing it.)  Some trixies will inevitably ""woooo!"" by or before 9pm, at which time I will imagine a scenario where they're set ablaze, before returning to my food.  All of that being said, I've been to this place on several occasions, and will continue to patronize State for a couple of reasons.  Every Wednesday, State has Half-Price food. Yes, as I'm sure the staff is forced to explain 9230402 times, every Wednesday, everything edible is half price. Oh, and so are bottles of wine.  This. Is. Awesome. The food, well, it's really good. Every time I've got a Wednesday night free, I roll into the equally gorgeous and hideous Lincoln Park neighborhood to try something different (which isn't difficult to do here, because they're always mixing up the menu) and I have yet to be disappointed.  The folks who work here are totally down to earth, and really good at what they do.  Every Wednesday State is packed with drunken goofballs clamoring for half-priced food and wooing and probably tipping poorly. (Just because your food is half-price doesn't mean your tip should be) and these ladies and gentlemen, slammed as they are, never lose their cool. They are attentive, and the food arrives in a reasonable time-frame, regardless of the establishment's traffic.   Let me elaborate on what an awesome bargain this Wednesday night special is.  This evening a friend of mine and I sat at the bar. I had a bowl of very tasty roasted red pepper soup,  a half-slab of ribs (it was more like 2/3 of a slab) with a generous portion of garlic mashed potatoes, and some mixture of corn and bacon that was strangely amazing. My friend had A bowl of tortilla soup, and a hot pannini style sammich (state calls them toasts?) with ham, salami, cream cheese, and  tomatoes. (he claimed this was the best thing he'd eaten in weeks) with a side of  state fries (french fries covered in feta cheese, lemon juice, and oregano. totally awesome) Oh, and we had a bottle of overpriced French red wine, because I suck at choosing wine.  our tab, with tax?  $36.

The place was packed with college age guys drinking beers standing up by their tables. For some reason they were all standing up and drinking. I think there was a girl with them and she was sitting. I'm used to diversity in a crowd. I'm used to dining with a younger crowd and older people, married couples, gay people, etc. This place was not at all diverse. It was the same everywhere you looked. Every girl looked like the next and every guy was standing up with the same beer. I was bored looking at everyone. So then you can look at one of the many many tvs. It was playing sports. Blasting sports actually. It was so loud I had to yell across the table to my company for them to hear me. The waitress was extremely kind and the food was good. I loved my burger.

I decided to give it another try on Black Wednesday, based on an open invitation on Facebook for a party that included a $30 all-you-can-drink drink package from 9pm-1am.  We arrived to the bar right around 9pm and were given 16oz. plastic cups that were to be used for the package.  When we paid, we confirmed that our $30 entitled us to domestic draft beer and call drinks from 9pm-1am.  Everything was going well until just after midnight when the manager (so I was told by the bartender) decided to cut off the drink package.  So, our group was screwed out of 1 hour of drinks, which the bar had told us we were entitled to.  I asked a bartender if I could speak with a manager and he informed me that the only manager there was the owner, who was partying at a table with a group of friends.  I decided against approaching him, since he wasn't actually working.  I never did find an on-duty manager, which makes me wonder a bit.   From that point on, the night went straight downhill.  By the end of the night, the floor was covered with standing puddles of bar scum, which the bouncers had no inclination to take care of (I know because I asked one of them to clean up near our table, and nobody ever came).  It was nearly impossible to get a drink.  Apparently the bartenders had their groups of friends in the bar and were definitely more concerned with getting them drinks than anyone else.  It was strangely reminiscent to the University of Illinois in C-U's bar scene, which would be fine, provided I was still 20 years old and didn't know any better.   I will never step foot in State again.  Their terrible disregard for customer service is appalling.  In addition, I will actively campaign for my friends and acquaintances to avoid this bar.

After a lackluster football year (for us...10 wins is apparently reason to lambast your program...yeah, I know, simmer down Notre Dame fans, we are ungrateful...), and decades of Pat Summitt kicking ladies b-ball butt, our basket-Vols were woefully outshined. Some of you may know that I was the mascot for the good ol' Univ. of Tennessee...yes, Smokey...the hound dog. 30+ lb. head and fur suit running Heath Shuler and Peyton Manning onto the field. Good times, good times...and a full scholarship, to boot. However, in basketball: I felt like more people were there to watch my halftime antics than to watch the game (we were 5-22 one year...not good times). This year -- our team (for a fleeting moment) is #1, and we went to watch them play this past Tuesday night against Vanderbilt (a loss...there was the fleeting #1 moment). My good friend, a Vandy grad, and I decided to go to State to watch the game. We sat at the bar -- drank Fat Tires, had $5 burgers with mozz and State fries (feta and greek spices on the delightfully evil, crispy fries), as well as a spinach and artichoke dip with freshly baked pita. All of it good! Jacky and the girls and I have been brunching it here since the BYO days, and have always been fans of their spacious interior and kid-friendly atmosphere. So -- not only were we sitting at the bar with friendly patrons, friendly bartender, and a heckuva basketball game going on, but it was Trivia Tuesday -- and as noted by others, this is a contest not for the faint of heart! At least 100 people in there -- a good range of 21-40 yo were there at every table! The questions? They were hard! I thought we old guys at 35yo would smoke the backwards baseball hat crew, but we were wrong...the music was wonderfully 1991ish in context, so I knew the age of the trivia ""master"" immediately (what's up, my brother...I feel your Rusted Root and Morrissey...), but I was still stumped on a bunch of those questions.

2008-02-21,4.0,"One of the great things about Chicago is the myriad of weeknight dining deals.  I love how restaurants will throw out kick ass food specials just to get you to brave the cold and eat at their establishment on a Wednesday night.   Such was the case last night when my friend and I had dinner at State.  My friend suggested State specifically because all entrees and bottles of wine are 1/2 off are Wednesdays.  Seriously -- any entree on the menu (this includes burgers and sandwiches) are 1/2 off.  I don't care what type of restaurant you are -- if I can eat your food for 1/2 off, then I'll be more than happy to give you a try. As luck would have it, the food at State was actually pretty good too.  I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Alexander, which consisted of chicken breast stuffed with spinach and feta cheese and drizzled with a creamy white basil sauce.  To be honest, it was pretty damn good.  My friend ordered the Flat Iron Bourbon Steak, which she said was pretty tasty, especially the garlic mashed potatoes that came with it.  We also ordered a side of sweet potatoe fries, which went really well with the chipotle ranch dressing that we asked for on the side (fries + ranch = awesomeness).  The rest of the menu looked appetizing too (think contemporary American) so I'm pretty sure anyone can find something to eat.   State also has a pretty healthy liquor selection, including a list of specialty cocktails with cute names like the Rocket Fuel and the Eye Opener.  I opted for just beer, as Fat Tire and Smithwick's on tap was just fine by me.  Service was ok -- our server was very friendly but a little MIA at times.  The crowd was mixed when we were there last night; half the folks looked like they were in their early 20's and the other half looked like they were in their early 30's.  Parking can be tough if you don't live in the area but it's do-able.  I believe State has food specials on other nights as well, though I will probably come back again on a Wednesday just to take advantage of the 1/2 off deal.  If you haven't been to State before, it's worth checking out!",0.9907,0.811,0.159,0.031,0.5608091787439613

2008-01-16,4.0,"I've been holding off on my review of State until I had something more to say than the trivia night is fun (which I have now gone to about 10 times now, and it is one of the things I look forward to every week).  Here are a couple of my other feelings about State: #1 - The service is really good.  The restaurant is always packed on Tuesday nights when I go there, and the drinks always come quickly.  Last night I chatted up the bartender while waiting for a table, and she was also really friendly.  At a lot of nicer bars it seems like service is an after-thought, and I don't feel that way about State at all. #2 - The bar is not trying to be something it isn't.  I say this because the bar is nice enough that they could pretend they were nice enough to have one of the guys in the bathroom that I loathe so much, but they realize there are TVs all over the bar and that people are not going there to have paper towels handed to them for $1. #3 - The food that I've had has been decent to great.  I made a mistake and ordered a panini once, and it was gross.  I don't know how a turkey-club panini doesn't taste good, but it just didn't.  The burgers on the other hand have been very good.  For a healthier option try substituting turkey for beef, and adding grilled veggies instead of fries, and you will still have a very good meal. #4 - Another reason to really like State is that on the last few trivia nights they have been giving away quite a few free parties.  I have about 3 or 4 friends now who are going to be able to drink for free on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday from 8 - 10 simply for going to a bar.  You have to really like that! I know this was a long review, but after going there about 10 times I feel like I really have a good feel for it.  I am cashing in my free party this Saturday from 8 - 10, so maybe you can meet me and 19 of my friends at State this Saturday!",0.9975,0.769,0.206,0.026,0.4723271889400921

Also, this is the second week in a row that they have done away with giving you rolls on your table...which is my general rule-of-thumb marker for a semi-classy place.

I met a group of 20 friends in from out of town for a grad school reunion night and it was perfect!  A dozen of the people had dinner there and said the food was fine.  The rest of us just came by for drinks at 9. I didn't pay extremely close attention, but I think drink prices seemed to be comparable to most Lincoln Park or Wrigleyville bars.  I did not hear anyone complain of the prices - and my friends were all from out of town, mostly smaller markets. As mentioned by some other Yelpers, the bar is HUGE.  Ceilings are high, tables are plentiful (hightops and regular) and there are a ton of bar seats.  I think every seat had a good view of a tv, bcs there were so many.  Atmosphere is very similar to other upscale sports bar/restaurant hybrids.  This would be an excellent place to watch a game. My friends and I (mid 20's to early 30's) LOVED the music (mostly popular pop/R&B/rap from 90's to now).  There were some excellent mixes. As I see it, there were two drawbacks.  (1) NO DANCE FLOOR.  Or maybe the areas to the left and right of the bar are supposed to be for dancing but instead they were overcrowded with the second drawback (2) really nasty super made up butt hanging out trixies w/IQ's of 50 and the equally greasy slimeballs they attract.  I don't have a problem w/the typical trixies/chads, in fact it makes me miss my early 20's.  You could almost see the STD's flying around this group.  I wanted to run straight to my dr for a shot after being within 20 yards of them.  Hopefully I can say this w/out getitng in trouble.  I can't imagine greasiness is a protected class of people. Other than these 2 areas, the bar was not crowded.  Music was loud, but I was still able to converse w/my friends and still have a voice the next day. I hope this bar succeeds.  I had little exposure to the employees.  One bartender that served me multiple times seemed friendly, but had laryngitis.  I will definitely plan on going back to this bar.  I think this place would be great anytime you had a big group and wanted seats.

Our waitress was PERKY.  And training another waitress.  We got a lot of intrusive attention. The food was okay.  I might eat here again, if at a large group event or for the food special, but I wouldn't take my parents here.

The food was quite good!  We ordered the Buffalo Calamari.  It had a great spiciness and the calamair was tender and plentiful.  My only complaint is that a light and cripsy coating would have added more texture and would have dispersed the spicy ""Buffalo-ness"" better.  We both ordered steaks -- NY strip for me and Flat Iron Bourbon steak for my other half.  Both were tender, juicy and perfectly prepared!  I was more attracted to some of the other side dishes that were offered, so I requested a couple of changes.  Rather than the mashed potatoes and broccoli, I requested the State fries and the asparagus. The State fries are YUM YUM YUM!!!  Lightly battered potatoes toseed with feta cheese, lemon and herbs -- SO DELICIOUS and light-tasting (even though we all know fries are anything but light).  The asparagus was nicely grilled and was a perfect compliment to the steak.  My partner said the Bourbon steak was excellent.  He offered some to me, but I was too busy devouring my own. The service was very friendly and attentive without being annoying.  Our server was great -- he was fun and had great suggestions.  Even the bussers were nice, polite and friendly!
