2017-09-03,5.0,"Fantastic dinner for a reasonable price.  Our party of four shared a cheese plate, pretzels with melted cheese, the mac and cheese, bourbon shrimp, the duck club sandwich, and green curry beef tenderloin.  The cheese plate had exceptionally flavorful cheese and meats, with fresh French bread. The pretzels were soft bites with a delicious beer cheese. We were all happy with them as starters. For our main meal, the duck club and mac and cheese were fantastic. The mac and cheese was the perfect blend of crispy and creamy, and may have been the best I have ever tasted. The duck club blew us all away and is large enough for 2 or 3 people to share.  The green curry tenderloin and shrimp were also good, but not as exceptional as the rest.  I also had a beer flight, and they have a good pour (4 oz, I think) for each. Fork had about 15-20 beers on tap with a great mix of styles.  All this was only $125. We were surprised it wasn't closer to $200 given how much we ate, the food quality, and that a couple of us had drinks.  Our server was great, answering all our questions and checking on us regularly. My only complaint was that our courses came out really quickly. Next time I will ask them to space it out a bit.",0.9867,0.812,0.167,0.021,0.6078483245149912
2017-08-30,5.0,"Dinner Review: 4.5 stars Fork is a great neighborhood spot to check out for standard American food.  I had no trouble getting a reservation the day before for a group of 5 for my first visit.  Their menu has a great selection of both wines and beers available.  I am a big fan of wine and beer flights, so I decided to try their ""Afternoon Delight"" sparkling wine flight.  This flight included three generously poured glasses of sparkling wines and a piece of paper with the names of the wines.  All three of them were excellent, and it was difficult to pick a favorite out of the three.   As an appetizer, I tried the merguez slider (made with ground lamb).  This slider tasted good, but the meat was a little too overdone.  I'm glad that there was a light coating of a sauce on top to provide some moisture.  For my main meal, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  The shrimp included in this dish were very large, and the sauce on top of the grits was spicy.",0.9628,0.81,0.161,0.029,0.5380952380952381

2017-08-14,4.0,"I've been here mostly for brunches with some buddies who live in the area. Experiences have been generally good. Food is delicious, the staff helpful, and the rest very decent. Food: I've only had brunch here, and they tend to be delish! I've had the fried chicken and waffle as the highlight of the menu - waffles were tasty, a bit sweet and a bit wheaty-ish, with a very decent syrup (not sure if its pure maple syrup or not). For the sides, bacon (both kinds) and sausage (pork) were very tasty, with the nice tastes of maple and smoked applewood complementing their appropriate meats. Drinks were refreshing with the sangria, the mimosa, and another one that escapes me for the moment, but the bar is more than competent on their cocktails and beers. Oh yeah, I think the bacon dates are to die for...okay, maybe not that great, but still sinfully tasty. Yummy! Service: Fork's service is...decent. I can't say I've had a bad experience, but they just don't quite push the envelope of showing up often enough so I can have my overfill of 6 or more coffees. Refer to Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs. Though the RD reference is mostly in jest, but proves the point: do more of better! Otherwise, nothing to complain about, serves us well. The maitre'd or check in area folks are friendly and helpful. This place is fairly popular, so please please please do your due diligence and book a reservation. A group of us, which was 12 people, booked it at least 2-3 days ahead of time. It worked out just fine. We happy! Misc: Furnishings are good, reminding me a bit of the 1960s or something with some mix of some wood and brick. Bathrooms are towards the back, if not a bit smallish, and there are more tables towards the back and other side of the restaurant. This one's a keeper when I'm in the neighborhood, but parking can be a bit troublesome - there's a pay lot about a block SE from Fork, both Chicago Park and another pay lot which seems okay but I never did it.",0.9914,0.759,0.177,0.064,0.5830409356725146
2017-08-14,4.0,"Came here for breakfast while in town visiting family. It was busy so instead of waiting for a table, we opted to sit at the bar. The bartender was very nice and helpful and suggested a mimosa flight for me, which hit the spot.  While looking over the menu, I was torn because there were so many things I wanted to try! I have always wanted to try chicken and waffles, and seeing that they had been voted best in Chicago, I figured this was the place to finally take that leap. Unfortunately, it fell a bit short for me. If I took my time to ensure that all ingredients were represented in each bite, it was solid, but I was disappointed that the chicken couldn't stand on it's own. There's nothing better than a good piece of fried chicken breast, but this was only OK. It was saved by the fact that the waffle was outstanding. It was still decent, but I wouldn't get it again and can only imagine how good this dish would be if the chicken was better. Not sure how it won best in Chicago - maybe I came on an off day. My fiance ordered the standard eggs benny that came with breakfast potatoes, all of which were delicious. Friendly staff, cute atmosphere and reasonable prices.

2017-06-13,3.0,"Would you like a side of swears to go with your eggs and toast? I wasn't expecting it either, but let's take it back to the beginning... So we were in the area and we were hungry for some Sunday brunch. It was between Fork, and a restaurant across the street. Both were opening at the same time, but we saw a line of people waiting to get into Fork. Usually this indicates that a restaurant may be throwing down some tasty food, so we decide to get a table here.  We are immediately seated and of course it looks like everyone is putting their orders in at the same time. Understandably, the kitchen has its first order rush of the day. Whoever was leading the kitchen must have thought that insulting the staff and swearing is what gets food out quickly to the table. I don't think it works that way, but it didn't stop us from hearing a good 20-25 minute drill sergeant tirade from the back. Now, luckily we were the only people in that certain area. There were no kids seated in the room with us, but I can imagine that others could hear in the next room over too.  I didn't have my kids with me, so honestly I thought it was entertaining, awkward, and fascinating all at the same time. Our server was awesome though. She apologized for the f-bomb ""commotion"" and offered us some free doughnuts.  Our food was actually decent too. I would have liked my smoked salmon Benedict to be a bit warmer. I think the hollandaise sauce was fresh out of the fridge and that is what cooled it down. The coffee was also done pretty well and it wasn't hard to get refills from our server.  I would feel a bit wary bringing my family of little kids here, if this is how it gets when it's busy, but maybe I just visited on a really odd day. Seemed like the workers were used to it, though. *Shrugs* All I can say is that I left full and somewhat amused.",0.9953,0.781,0.181,0.038,0.5181577681577683

2017-05-08,3.0,"I visited Fork on a weeknight following a class at Old Town School of Folk Music. The restaurant wasn't too busy, but had a healthy number of occupied tables for a Wednesday evening. The interior is very cozy and dark, so I imagine this would make a great spot for a date.  We chose to dine at Fork because I was looking to eat on the lighter side (ie: salad), and the menu seemed to have some good options.  We started out with two cocktails. I tried the Hemingway - rum, cherry, grapefruit, and lime. This cocktail is not as sweet as it sounds, but tastes perfectly like tart cherries. I loved it, and it was a value at $11 (at least by Chicago standards).  My meal, on the other hand, was less impressive. I ordered the jamon & asparagus salad (romaine, jamon wrapped asparagus, spiced puffs, lemon garlic vinaigrette). You guys, this salad was so unimpressive for $13. There was barely any dressing, the ""spiced puffs"" were like a savory, boring version of Honey Smacks cereal, and the salad included 4 tiny, ham wrapped asparagus spears. I was still starving after I ate this. I would be embarrassed to serve this as an entree to a paying customer. If it is not intended to be served as an entree, then the server should point this out. I guess I was expecting some more asparagus and ham.  My boyfriend ordered the ""duo of tenderloin medallions,"" which is $22 and listed as a ""large plate."" Well, don't expect this ""large plate"" to come with any sizable portion of veggies or any side. It was literally two small steak medallions with 2 or 3 broccoli florets. Our bill was $57 plus tax and tip, and we left hungry. Next time I will try Gather instead.",0.9843,0.799,0.143,0.058,0.47807539682539685
2017-04-30,2.0,"Story time: We get to the restaurant have a brunch reservation and get seated immediately. Not bad as I placed the reservation the evening before and the place was busy, though we probably wouldn't have had to wait. We get seated and the waiter probably takes 10ish minutes to come over and take our order. He was gone for so long we just ordered everything when typically we order drinks and he lets us browse the menu, which is completely fine. We order coffees, fresh doughnut holes (as a starter), cobb salad, the sausage scramble (which comes with potatoes and toast), and the chicken and waffle (dark meat). Drinks come out fine, no problem. Then the doughnut holes come out. I pick one up to bite in and it tastes like it was sitting out. They were very cold and had the same consistency a half-day old dunkin donut had. The filling also didn't taste fresh. We send them back and don't even want more, because at this point we know are food is probably going to come out soon. And it does. The salad comes out fine... because how can you mess up a cold salad. The scramble it self comes out fine but the potatoes are cold and the chicken and waffle is also cold. They also don't bring out the toast. We send back the potatoes and the chicken and waffle and ask for toast. At this point the kitchen has messed up 3 different things and we are not happy.  They bring out potatoes hot almost immediately which begs the question, why would you serve cold potatoes in the first place? Then they bring out the toast and I wait a bit for the chicken and waffle which is fine as I figured it may take a bit to prepare. They bring one out which was white meat, send it back because I ordered dark. The new waffle came out which was dark meat, but was still not hot (which meant it was sitting), but at this point there has been too much shenanigans with food that I just ate it. The food itself all actually tasted really good. The chicken and waffle was really good (though I wish I got the full effect) and all the other entrees were great. They also did everything that they were supposed to from a management perspective and took the doughnuts and the chicken and waffle off of our bill. That being said when you go out to eat, it is about the overall experience and that was ruined by too many mistakes coming from the kitchen.

The deserts were also outstanding. Being billed as a farm to table restaurant, the prices were a bit higher than an average night out - but the quality, presentation and creativity of the dishes was outstanding. They have 20 beers on tap but not a good mix of styles if you are an old german like me. Remember, this is Lincoln Square. The tap line consisted of 5 IPAs and 14 types of ales from porters to Saisons. The one saving grace was the Stiegl Pils on tap. I would love to see some more styles of craft beer at restaurants instead of 19 different kinds of ale.

Long wait times for check and avoided us during food delay. The check was incorrect and had to flag down someone to ask about getting if discovered. After this they took off the meals and 2 of 5 drinks.

2017-03-04,5.0,"Been meaning to come here for awhile and finally had a chance to check it out. This place is Fork-ing great! (see what I did there?) I got here a little before 10AM on a cold and snowy Chicago morning. There was already a few people outside waiting. Once inside, we were seated quickly at a booth just fine. Me and the homies got to mingle and talk at a really good and warm atmosphere. Our server quickly got us all waters and coffee. The server explained us the recommended items on the menu (The ""Showstopper!"") and even went above-and-beyond to address my vegetarian friend (he always has 90-questions and substitution requests, and we all bust his balls on his ordering method all the time). I split The Showstopper with one of my homies and could barely finish half of it. The Showstopper consisted of 2 belgian waffles, a pound (yes, a freaking pound) of prime beef patty, cheddar, swiss, tomato, arugula, dijonnaise, burnt ends, house-cured bacon & ham. I mean, it had me at a pound of prime beef. Now you're telling me it has burnt ends, bacon, and ham??? As our frosted-tip annoying dude from Food Network would say, Shut the front door yo! The server said that if one person could eat all of it at one sitting, the person gets it for free. This beast did not come even close.  Overall, food was on point, service was on point, and atmosphere was on point. I had a really pleasant experience at Fork. It was fork-ing fanstastic.  BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the back, the men's bathroom consisted of two urinals and cramped stall. Stall was somewhat dimly lit, but was in decent shape. The door was nice and secure so if you need to make some room for the Showstopper, you can poop to your content, not having to worry about someone busting down the door after eating a Showstopper.

2017-03-01,3.0,"so I went here for brunch with my friend.  as you walk in the door they have an article from Time Out proclaiming their chicken and waffle dish as the best of its kind in the city of Chicago.  perhaps it would have been the best of its kind had it not been burnt when I received it.  the chicken was so black in parts that it looked more Cajun than anything.  I figured, since they brought it to me despite how it looked, that it was supposed to look that way.  I was wrong.  I only noticed the Time Out article as I exited the restaurant.  and I pointed to it and told my friend ""My chicken didn't look anything like that!"".  I could have dealt with the burnt chicken if it weren't for the service.  my waiter, who was wearing the tightest skinny jeans I have ever seen, continuously came by the table as we were taking our last bites for food.  naturally after brunch you want to sit and chit chat and drink your coffee undisturbed.  well, this waiter continuously came by every 2 minutes after leaving the check on the table until finally he quite rudely exclaimed ""I'm leaving for the day and I need to close out your bill.""  so that explained why he was hovering around my table.  What he should have done was when he left the bill the first time he should have said ""Here's your bill.  I'm leaving in about 30.minutes and need to cash you out if you don't need anything else.  but please feel free to stay and enjoy your coffee.""  Problem solved, check would have been paid immediately.  Instead he chose to have a hissy fit tableside and lost out on some of his tip.  Considering all the other places there are to eat brunch in Chicago I will DEFINITELY think twice before coming back here.",0.9738,0.85,0.113,0.037,0.5836805555555556

2017-02-28,4.0,"We had a very pleasant birthday dinner (mine!) on a Sunday night in late January.  The venue: Comfortably appointed. Enough light for my middle-aged eyes to read the menu, but not so much light that I wished for sunglasses. We sat in the main room, not too far from the entrance. The restaurant was not busy at all, surprisingly. I can't speak to what the sound level is, because, with it nearly empty, it was easy for us to hear each other speak. Service: Prompt and professional. From the waters to the menus to the meal to the drinks -- everything came in good order. Not rushed, not slow. Alcohol: Oh boy. Lots and lots of wine. Different flights available. You can create your own. I have become a huge fan of Spanish reds, and I liked what I had very much. My friend went with a flight of chardonnays, and she was happy, too. Being the would-be oenophile that I am, I wish there'd been a more generous pour, but hey. What we got was typical. Food: Here's where things got a little challenging. I am vegan; my friend has multiple food allergies and a very sensitive stomach. And, neither one of us has a huge appetite. Our selection, based on these personal restrictions, were limited. It would be nice if there had been more options.     That being said, what we had, we enjoyed very much. We started with the warm marinated olives. Oh boy -- SO GOOD! We both remarked that we hadn't seen olives served warm before. This was an innovation we both enjoyed. We then ordered the garlic cilantro fries and the mushroom flatbread to share. My friend had a pulled pork slider. Everything, repeat, everything was delicious. Again, we remarked on how good the fries were. They definitely had a kick to them. The mushroom flatbread was big enough to share. My friend kept the pulled pork slider for herself, and she said it was very good. Parking:  Street only. On weekend nights, this area can be very congested. There is street parking, plus a lot just south on Lincoln Avenue, and another lot at the Brown line Western Avenue stop. Not a problem if you have to walk a block. Bottom line: We very much enjoyed our time at Fork and would happily go back again.

We then got the date wrapped in bacon app. It was so yummy. Could have eaten all of them by myself. But I refrained.  Dinner I got the Duck Club! It was so yummy. My friend had me try her fries.

But lo and behold, the menu was extensive and interesting, and I was pleasantly surprised by how hearty each shared dish was. It's clear Fork knows what they are doing. I came in with a group of friends and we ordered seven or eight dishes- and absolutely no complaints about anything we ordered. Each dish was beautifully plated and tasty in its own way. We opted to just share and pass and had a great time doing so... and that's what the art of tapas should be! Standouts include the bacon wrapped dates and mac and cheese. Fork has a hip atmosphere, great people, and spacious seating. My group sat in a cozy wrap around booth with plenty of room. The drink menu also looked phenomenal.

2017-02-20,1.0,"After playing soccer, a group of friends and I wanted to grab brunch. A few of them had been to Fork in the past and recommended it. With it being a warm day during mid winter, the patio was open which made for a wait. Once seated, Niko came by, standing casually with his hands in his pockets, not seeming overly friendly. Once we got our drinks, we were told they were out of a few items which made us need a few more minutes. Once ready, we asked how many donuts were in an order, being told they were out of those also. He gave us a defensive answer about it being busy etc which I do understand...people run out of things. After getting our food, we never saw Niko again unless he came by to splash coffee in our cups, as well as on the table and even someones shirt. Why do people top off someones coffee when its 3/4's full? Its not that fun having to keep adding cream and sugar every time they come by like its your water glass? And if you're going to poor more coffee, why not ask? And not splash it around like you could care less. The food was mediocre. Everyone at the table needed salt or hot sauce. Someone said if they werent starving they would have sent it back. Not once were we asked how anything was. I think Niko needs to realize in this industry, you make money by being personable tableside. I dont care if its busy or not, its part of your job.

2017-02-18,2.0,"I don't know if I've just been unlucky, but I feel like fork has really gone downhill over the years. When I first moved to the area years ago, Fork was little haven of good food and good wine. It was a place I always took my friends. Over the last year or so, every time I'm in I feel like things get worse and worse. The menu has stayed fairly stagnant, with only a few dinner specials per week.  What really inspired this review tho was my last visit.  We arrive to the restaurant later on during a Friday evening. It was a warm day and the restaurant was VERY hot. Like slightly making me nauseous hot. But the hostess said they could sit us quickly, so hunger won out more then anything else. We waited about 10 min and then were ready to be sat.  As she brought us to our table, it had not yet been cleaned from the last patron. She escorts us back to the bar area to wait for it to be cleared. After a few minutes she takes us back to that same table. We sit and I immediately put my hand into crumbs, clearly it wasn't cleaned very well. We take a peek at the menu and make some preliminary decisions on wine and appetizers. And then we wait. After about 5 min a waitress comes to the table to say there will be ice water out soon and would we like to order anything. We order our 2 go to appetizers and a bottle of wine. Then we wait some more. It's so hot, and it's been about 10 min of sitting and there is still no water at the table. We look down at the appetizer plates we were given and they are both dirty. My date and I try to decide if we should stay as we are both very uncomfortable at this point.  Finally we get some water and one of our appetizers is dropped off... even tho we still haven't gotten our wine. We open our silverware roll ups and see that the silver ware is so dirty it's literally still caked in food.  At that point we got up to leave.

When the waitress finally took my drink order after 20 minutes of sitting with nothing but my friends water to sip on...i noticed that her face was red and there was snot running down her cheeks. She seemed completely high on cold medicine and proceeded to spill wine all over another guest. We spoke with the table next to us and they said that ""they have asked for their check and to-go boxes repeatedly and they were upset"" I know waitressing can be hard but I think it's the manager's fault for letting this girl serve tables if she came to work almost comatose on cold meds. The food was delicious but it did not make up for the service. Also, at one point, the lights went out. Weird. I don't think I will ever be back here.",0.2152,0.882,0.054,0.064,0.5731045751633987

The last two times we've been (the time before this was for dinner) have been disappointing and we can no longer enthusiastically recommend this place to our friends like we used to.  I sincerely hope this establishment gets back on its feet some day, but we will also not be going here again any time soon.",0.9153,0.809,0.121,0.069,0.4513812033377249

2016-09-20,2.0,"TL;DR - nice location and service, grossly inflated prices. The location and sidewalk tables can't be beat on a beautiful day in Lincoln Square - very chill, nice to sit outside and relax with a drink. The service was great, too - attentive, pleasant, efficient.  Fork loses stars because it's so damn expensive. I get it, it's kinda prime real estate in the Square, but wow, if you're going to charge $25 for 5 charcuterie or cheese items, it might be nice if your portions are a little bigger. Two of the cheeses we had were each a single slice measuring about the size of a playing card and 1/8"" thick and 2 tiny wedges of another cheese. The 2 meats we had were also tiny portions. There were about 4 walnuts and some blackberries on the board as well. Ridiculous. Troquet's cheese and charcut plate is far better, and they are paying rent in River North. The other indication of gross price gouging was the wine. We had just returned from the Art Institute where we had a nice half bottle of Qupe Chardonnay. The half bottle at the AIC was $18, which was fine - it's a museum, it's downtown, you expect to pay a premium for food and drink. A half bottle of the same wine at Fork was $30... seriously, $30 for a half bottle of wine that you can get in a museum in downtown Chicago for $18. I have no idea how they come up with their pricing, but, I guess PT Barnum has got it right: there's a sucker born every minute, and clearly , a lot of them are keeping Fork in business.",0.9521,0.779,0.141,0.08,0.5363425925925926

Both were noted on the menu as ""voted best in Chicago"" so obviously we had to try it. I'm also just a self proclaimed fried chicken and waffles enthusiast.  I loved my meal! The waffle was perfectly crispy and the syrup was delicious. They provided just enough chicken to eat with the waffle as well. My boyfriend tried it and said it was probably the best one he's ever had.  The duck club was HUGE. It was a two tiered sandwich. We paid an extra $2 to get a side of garlic fries which were yummy.

The drink menu was pretty extensive with plenty of great beers and cocktails to choose from. They also had a large customizeable charcuterie menu with a ton of different options to choose from - we asked our server for recommendations and he was happy to oblige. Everything that he recommended was really good and the plate itself (we did the choose 3) was surprisingly filling when split between 3 of us. The dinner menu was solid and offers a bunch of shareable options which we decided to go with. We ordered the special sliders, a flatbread and the duck confit poutine. Everything was solid although we were all full within 10 minutes. In regards to the rest of the menu, I will say that if you want your own plate rather than to share one, and you don't want a burger, you don't have the largest selection. Not to say there aren't plenty of good options, their menu just seems to be geared more toward sharing which can be great for groups. I'd be really interested to come back for brunch as all the brunch food pictures I saw on Yelp looked amazing. Overall, service was eat, food was solid and the atmosphere was very laid back.

2016-06-02,4.0,"I've been to Fork a couple times and I would have no problem coming here again if someone suggests it and I would recommend it to others. Their Brunch is solid and there are so many options that it's easy to please everyone, even if you come with a larger group. Service was a bit spotty on the first visit, but I had no issues the second time. I highly suggest making reservations because it's been packed both times I went, with a line out the door and curving around the building. The first time I went, I had my heart set on a few items and was not interested in sharing: - The Fork ""Poutine"" is fantastic and some of the best I've had in Chicago. It's not exactly authentic, but it's super tasty! - The Mac n' Cheese is also divine, especially with added bacon. My friends were envious of it. - The Mimosa Flight is fine, but something fun to try once and skip on following visits, in my opinion. You can get ""unlimited"" but that's for juice and not for champagne and I'm not into juice diets. The second time I went, I had very good items but they were not as impressive as the first. However, my friend and I split a meal and really enjoyed it: - The House-Smoked Salmon Benedict is quite good. I only wish the blood orange would have been more prominent in the Hollandaise sauce. It was a salty dish, but that was expected. - The Duck Confit Hash was incredibly salty, which was too bad since there seemed to be a lot of good flavors hiding under all that sodium. Sadly, I only had a few bites before I gave up and grabbed a glass of water (and I LOVE salt!). - The Garlic-Cilantro Fries have exactly the right amount of everything. They are fine all on their own, but the side of Sriracha Aioli takes them to the next level.",0.9944,0.712,0.204,0.084,0.5287789987789988

People make reservations with days in advance and they get seated first. I was there, waiting for a table as well and listened to all the exchange, you are not being honest about your review.

2016-05-24,1.0,First time we came here was great.... the second time- we will NEVER go back.  All 4 of us who went have worked in the industry and were appalled by the manager's behavior from this particular situation: When I walked in a mom and son asked for a table for 2 (manager not around).  The hostess seated them at a 5 top- mind you we had 4 people and 2 infants which we were willing to hold.  The manager tried to seat us and let us know because of reservations we would have to eat in 45 minutes.  We declined and asked how long for another table and he said they wouldn't be able to seat us.  We asked why a party of 2 was placed at a 5 top and the manager told us they were expecting a party of 5.  I was shocked that he blatantly LIED to us without even knowing I had heard them say there were just 2 of them.  He had a condescending tone with us as well.  We will never go back and I would not recommend coming here if you have kids. This was only the tip of the iceberg from that particular experience but when a manager cannot speak with customers honestly or admitting there was wrong doing there is a serious problem.,-0.6675,0.868,0.056,0.076,0.5416666666666666

We got seated as soon as everyone arrived and spent quite some time trying to figure out what to order because everything on the menu looked so good. Finally decided on getting the fork poutine to share and we each got our own entree; I ordered the chicken & waffle. I highly recommend both. The duck confit in the poutine was so juicy and tender and the duck gravy and cheddar sauce complemented each other perfectly. I could seriously eat this all the time if I wasn't health conscious. The chicken n waffle was also delicious; there were two large pieces of fried chicken with a great mix of sweet and salty seasoning as well as a very crunchy piece of candied bacon. The waffle was also not too heavy which I appreciated. My friends also enjoyed their entrees which included the chicken n waffle, duck confit hash and a benedict.

For me this is very important to having a good BLT. Our server was perfect in her attentiveness, and was amusing as well. My companion loved her quiche too. They have a good beer selection on tap, something I really appreciate. We sat and talked for a long time, but were not bothered or made to feel like it was time to go.

Giant, homemade biscuit with a perfect over-medium egg and thick bacon in the middle DROWNING IN GRAVY.  So delicious and satisfying, and the fries were as awesome as other Yelpers say. We got the orange creme brulee and peanut butter bread pudding for dessert, which were closer to 3.5 stars.

The people are nice but clueless. Whether at the bar or seated, getting the staff's attention is an arduous task. One time we just gave up and sat there and after 15+ minutes the manager ended up taking our order.  So we thought a solution to this would be to order takeout. Altho the time in transit is a drawback compared to dining in, its worth it not to have to deal with the service. We've done this 4-5 times. But even that has proved difficult. I called last weekend for an order and was just told plainly that they weren't doing take out right now bc they have two large parties. I asked what the wait was and she said they just aren't doing it right now. So I ran some errands and called back in two hours and was told again that they weren't doing takeout bc there was a large party. I don't understand how large parties would impact takeout to the point where there cant be a wait.  So unfortunately it looks like Fork is going to be pulled from my rotation. I tried, i really really tried, but it didn't work. So my search for duck confit hash continues :(",0.1546,0.828,0.089,0.083,0.5691326530612244

The hostess said it would be 25 minutes but it was about 10. That gets brownie points in my opinion. We ordered the chilaquiles, the mushroom hash and warm olives. I am an olive freak but that dish was impossible to eat. The olives tasted awful! My husband said his dish was dry and I agreed with him, nothing to rave about but I absolutely loved my mushroom hash. I think they make their own english muffins and jelly. Both things I never eat but I inhaled yesterday. The portions were big but if my dish is that good then I am okay with that.

Okay.. bad start but the reviews claim deliciousness and I was ready for some of that.  I decided to get the duck club and it was $17, which I initially thought was slightly pricey for a sandwich but they did not skimp on the meat! It was a triple decker sandwich and it came with a bunch of fries. Super excited, I finally took a bite into the sandwich and it was just okay. Not bad but it wasn't great. Everything was just slightly too salty.  On top of the food, service was less than average. Our water cups were constantly empty and finding our waiter just seemed more difficult than it should've been.

I shared it with Andi and it was plenty for two.  This rib eye was F'in FANTASTIC! Now, I can be critical of food, I've been called worse than a food snob, and when I tell you this rib eye was as good as Jordan's at HALF the price, I mean it.  The Really good news is that the same chef/ owner dude who came out to ask me how I liked the rib eye, told me he was gonna serve it at their new location across from Lou Malnati's at the old Chalkboard which is opening next year.  So, be prepared and be sure to visit them when they do.   Mellody and Nikki also liked their short ribs and seafood stew so it's not like there isn't a thin else on the menu. I'd also recommend the Bliss which is a cocktail made with Buffalo Trace and jalapeño. Try it.",0.9692,0.77,0.175,0.055,0.5496487989135047
2015-12-19,4.0,"I am updating my review because I was a little disappointed in the food at Fork this most recent time we visited.  The service was still good, the decorations are great and they are kid friendly and parking is easy...all great things.  We started with the duck confit toastinis which are small and a perfect 2 to 3 bite treat.  They were very delicious.  What I was looking forward to was their chicken and waffles which they are supposedly known for.  I was beyond disappointed though.  I have had a lot of chicken and waffles in my years but this one was probably at the very bottom of my list.  The chicken was cooked well.  I ordered dark meat.  The waffle was the problem.  It was not nearly as crispy as it should have been.  That would have seriously made all of the difference.  My husband ordered the same thing and had the same complaint.  I think we would eat here again but would steer clear of the ""voted best"" chicken and waffles.  Or we would make it clear to make the waffles crispy.",0.95,0.787,0.151,0.062,0.5705128205128204

Two of us went with the breakfast melt, which has bacon and ham, egg, arugula, tomato, and cheese on some good Italian bread. It came out nice and hot and is a good size for the price.

The menu offers some good brunch items, fans sweet or savory brunches have some great things to choose from.  And who doesn't love names like Hangover Helper for a possible choice.   We opened with an order of mini donuts to share...luckily we asked for them at a good time because we got the last order available!  It was a perfect amount to give me the ""sweet"" option because I am usually a ""savory"" person when it comes to Brunch.

Although our server was really friendly, it seemed like everything was off. It took a while for us to order, all our meals were served in different times and sides like my toast almost never came.  It seemed like when we asked for anything from the gent that was helping our server, we were met with a little attitude--and I don't think we are demanding at all.  When it's like the basics (like missing food or refills) I don't think it's asking too much at all.

The staff is always on point recommending their favorite cocktails and dishes (love this! do not understand when waiting staff cannot tell you about what they serve), elegantly breaking down the specials, always checking on you to see if you need anything else, and adorable to look at might I add!

Protip: you can always mix and match the flights, substituting one glass for another.  I usually end up finding one of the glasses I loved the most in the flight and having a full glass of that once I'm done.  They also have a large beer selection.

There was nothing remotely tomato-y about it, and nothing remotely appetizing about it, either.

Then the sad happened.  The beet salad should have cheese, and there were a few bits, but not as much as usual.  You really need the cheese to offset the taste of the beets.  The 'dumplings' are not dumplings, they are gnocchi.  That's not the problem -- gnocchi is good.  I love gnocchi.  The problem is that the gnocchi had been in the broth so long that they were falling apart.  The broth had an unusually large amount of onion, as well, which really detracted from the other flavors.  And although the gnocchi were falling apart, the carrots were almost crunchy.  The peas that were part of this dish earlier in the season were absent. Maybe that's better.  They *were* the best damn peas I've ever had -- they're probably not available any longer. Our waiter did not appear for quite a while after our food was served.  Usually, after the food hits the table, the waiter comes around to check.  Not tonight.  We waited and waited, with our water glasses and drinks empty.  We finally got his attention and called him over to get another glass of wine and I ordered a starter to round out the meal: the 50/50 bacon burger.  (Wonderful!  Crispy and flavorful, with aioli and pickles) We also had to wait too long to get our dessert order in.  Pot de creme and blueberry crisp.  There wasn't a lot of crisp with the blueberries, but otherwise the desserts were good.  Then the waiter did something that really ticks me off:  He brought the check without being asked.  We were not lingering -- we hadn't even finished our coffee.  People were not waiting to be seated.  We felt that after somewhat lazy service, he was in a big freakin' hurry to get rid of us.",0.9837,0.835,0.11,0.055,0.5243922305764411

I took them up on the offer, and they definitely succeeded in changing my opinion. My wife and I returned for my birthday on a busy night. The server was running around between all the tables efficiently taking orders, serving food, and handing out drinks. Not once did I feel unattended to. The ambiance continued to be classy, yet casual. Great for date night or to grab a good meal and a couple of drinks with friends. Most of the food continued to be delicious (mussels, salad, bacon wrapped date chorizo, burger, and a salmon dish). My burger was mediocre compared to burgers you can get nearby but the rest was very good.

They were to be packed to the gills with people and was hosting a private party in the 2nd dining room.  Unlike all of our other visits, they seated us and then forgot us. My other half ordered florentine benedict which was wonderful. I ordered a BLT with mayo which ended up without mayo. When it arrived, fries were ice cold. I was half done with my sandwich by the time hot fries arrived. Kind of expected a table side visit from the manager or some sort of credit. All of this for $42 for 2 people for brunch.

Ultimately we had to leave.  There was no apology.  No explanation about what the problem was.  Maybe they didn't have eggs for same sex couples.  No rainbow sprinkles for the french toast.  Who knows.  We did hesitate on leaving and really wanted to try this place but my fear was that if our experience to just get a table was this bad who knows what kind of disaster awaits us if/when we do finally sit down.  I wish I could tell you about the food but it wasn't meant to be.",-0.9766,0.8,0.069,0.131,0.4118055555555556

Ordered the Poutine special, which was pretty good.. Your average Poutine with pulled pork & home made giardiniera-- which was the highlight of the dish. My husband ordered the steak frites, ordered medium rare. When it came out it was a rather raw flank steak. The waiter was GREAT about seeing that it was undercooked & took it back to get it fixed. However, when the steak was returned, it was half the portion he previously had and completely well done.  I had the burger, which was also a major let down. It was as if they had pre-made burgers patties that they put on their grill and tried to pass for a hand-shaped burger. Their garlic cilantro fries are fantastic. I'd recommend those to anyone. But the end of our meal was a let down... We seemed to be forgotten after we had gotten our main course. The restaurant has so much potential. Their beer and wine list is great!!

Fork put their own twist on this by adding braised duck. It was a huge serving and I was almost too full to eat the grits. When they came, there was no issue eating it, it was so good.

We split the homemade donut holes as a starter, because who doesn't love donut holes? They were so fresh, I wish we ordered more. I ordered the eggs benedict which is indescribable. First off, the English muffins are HUGE. Nestled on top was a delicious piece of grilled ham, topped with poached eggs. I was silent the entire time eating because it was just so good. Their breakfast potatoes were crispy and complimented everything on my plate. One friend got the Hangover Helper, which was smothered in gravy and overall an amazing choice.

They offer a selection of wine flights, which I chose the Smells Like Fruit Spirit, a collection of 3 white wines. My friend chose the Pinot Wizard, 3 red wines. Each flight cost around $15 and were decent pours. They set you up with three glasses immediately and give you a paper that describes each wine in order. They also have cheese and charcuterie flights with a la carte options. We ordered the french cheese flight and the smoked duck breast. Delicious, even though we only ended up with a small portion of duck. I'm not a huge fan of intensely flavored cheese, so this was the perfect choice for me. The cheese plate came with great variety of crispy bread, olives, pickles, candied pecans, fruit, etc. More extras than I thought we were going to get. They also give you a paper describing each cheese, which I love because I want to find my favorites later. We later ordered the House-Made Sausages and the House Pretzels. The pretzels were soft with a little bit of crunch. The beer cheese sauce, made with Half Acre, was tasty. A small portion again, but you can ask for more. The sausage was juicy and a great portion for two. It came with creamy potato salad. You could taste the mustard, but it wasn't too overpowering. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgable. We never felt like we were waiting for service.  The ambience was nice, dim lighting and big open windows. I love places where you can get various plates to share.

I also tried the grilled cheese, which was nicely grilled and had a generous amount of melty cheese in between; I just wished they used a better bread that would complement it more, as it was a little too thick.  This came with a cup of tomato soup, which was pretty okay, but more on the thicker consistency (I didn't mind this, and definitely do the grilled cheese dipping action!).  My friend had a burger, which was pretty okay, with a freshly-ground patty and toppings.  The strawberry rhubarb cobbler was a tad too overly sweet and more strawberry jam than the rhubarb.  The ginger ice cream, while interesting, was more on the forgettable side.  The restaurant also has a patio seating, so you can dine al fresco.  Parking is semi-difficult, but can be found in the residential off streets. +duck breast crostini +grilled cheese (request a substitute bread!) +limited residential parking",0.9879,0.826,0.174,0.0,0.534472049689441

The decor is warm with exposed brick walls and dimly lit dining room. A few TV's are above the main bar but I wouldn't call this a sports bar or a place to watch the game. More of a ""if the game is on and you're out dining with some boring coworkers and want to catch the score, you can."" The front windows open up to the sidewalk on Lincoln so what's nice is you can sit inside yet feel like you're outside. We did just that as the rain was coming down pretty good but we were able to enjoy the fresh air and be protected by the awnings outside. Service was cordial. Andy our server was nice. Not too friendly, not unfriendly, just professional. The ancillary staff was excellent as not a water glass went empty nor did a plate sit on the table for more than 2 minutes once completed. Kudos to the busing team. The unsung heroes of our dining experience... We started with a Chef's Selection of Charcuterie which consisted of pretty much a little of everything. Meats, cheeses, olives, dried cranberries, etc. It was a nice way to start off for 4 and just the right size and variety. For dinner we had amongst us a steak with fries, a soft shell crab sandwich and two orders of mussels. One French style (mine) and one a nightly special with fresh herbs and a broth. Steak was reportedly good and so were the special mussels.  My wife very much enjoyed her crab sandwich and it was large enough that she took half home. My french style mussels were also good although they lacked a bit of the creamy richness that other places I've had this style of mussel (think Le Bouchon in Bucktown) but still decent.  Beer list is very interesting with some nice quirky choices on there including a lite cranberry beer and a bitter lemon. Other more traditional choices may be found as well along with a nice cocktail list and wine list. What's nice about Fork is you can go for small plates, big plates or just share a whole lotta stuff. The menu I must admit was a bit all over the place but that may serve you well if you have a diverse group who all like different things. A kinda of ""something for everyone"" place.  For desert we shared (meaning I ate most of it) a bread pudding made with pretzels, peanut butter and chocolate topped with chocolate ice cream and drizzle. It was decadent and so rich I nearly passed out. Worth saving room for... Overall a nice place with good service, nice atmosphere and decent food.

It was so good that not only did we go there for dinner one of the nights we were there, we also went back for their Sunday brunch. Service was great and it turns out that the GM was also from the Metro Detroit area which was pretty cool. They offer a lot of small plates which worked perfectly the night we had dinner there as we had a fairly large and late lunch that day.  The GM took his time to give us suggestions and ask us what we like and didn't like food wise and we even trusted him to surprise us with a few items that he thought we'd like. Never would I have ever ordered beef tongue prosciutto on my own, which is one of the things he surprised us with, but it actually was really good.  When we came back for brunch I was egged on (no pun intended) to try and conquer the Showstopper challenge which is two Belgian waffles, a one pound prime beef patty, cheddar and swiss cheese, tomato, arugula, dijonnaise, maple braised short ribs, house cured bacon and ham. I was told many have attempted it and very few have actually succeeded.  Holy crapsticks was it good and yes, this fat kid conquered the beast in just under 30 minutes. The chef personally hand delivered it to me and praised me with a ""not worthy"" bow upon completion. I was stuffed to the gills, but it was worth it.

The bloody mary was uninspired and chunky but not particularly good.  Just throwing stuff into a bloody doesn't make it better.  It needs to crafted, carefully, and never forgetting that I want a buzz off of it too not just 16 flavors of cheese cubes!

We had, what we both believed, to be the worst service of our life there.  We were seated quickly, however, everything else went downhill... Our food took over 45m to come out, the longest I've ever had to wait there. The waiter was less than attentive, our drinks ran empty during our wait and he never even checked on us without my having to pull him aside (twice) to find out what was taking so long. Offering a shallow ""sorry, we're very busy"" to attempt to compensate. (hint: they were not that busy, by the time we got our food most of the section was empty and some had already received and eaten their entire meal) Even my friend who is from the south and epitomizes southern charm was fuming. The manager eventually came over to check on us (and the table next to us that was also complaining about the horrible service) and she offered a short apology and nothing else... no offer to compensate for the poor service, nothing, just a ""sorry"" and off to do whatever else it was she was doing. (it definitely wasn't getting her ass involved in fixing the situation by any means) The final kicker came when we asked for our check... you would think after all this they would promptly grab the ticket and get it to us. NOPE. It took ANOTHER 15-20 mins *JUST TO GET OUR CHECK* I will never go back here and my friend, who didn't complain about anything else the entire weekend, even asked me ""can we promise never to eat here again.""

2015-05-05,5.0,"I went to Fork for the first time this past weekend. The atmosphere was great. Sat at a table right up front by the window, and luckily the weather was purely amazing. Warm breeze, 70 degrees. On a Saturday night, there weren't any disturbances from the people walking passed the restaurant. Our waiter was as equally amazing. Very personable, knowledgeable on the menu. I actually ordered based on his suggestions, which I rarely do. For an appetizer we ordered from the cheese and charcuterie menu, and the servings were a little small for 4 adults, but held us over until we received our entrees. I ordered the salmon, with pees. I have never been asked how I would prefer my salmon cooked, and based on my friend's choice, I opted for medium rare. It actually tasted really good!  The only annoyance I found with this establishment, is when you are a frequent visiter to the restroom, especially after 3 cosmos, the urinals in the men's restroom are right next to each other, and have no dividers. They are also right in view of the door to the restroom, so when the door opens, you are literally on FULL DISPLAY. I am pee shy, so this kind of a situation is a pure nightmare for me. There is a stall, but with it being on a Saturday night, it was always in use. Next time I visit, i will make sure I don't consume that much liquor, as to avoid the frequent visits to the urinal display! Bottom line, the atmosphere, food and service is top notch.

The Bloody Mary was really good except I might ask next time if there is horseradish in it and if so, pass on that. I know lots of people are totally into that these days but I hate horseradish. Our server was super knowledgeable and offered her favorites right off the bat, which I love. We had the chicken and waffles and the farmhouse burger. Both were really good, although I don't think I would order the chicken and waffles again-only because it's a bit too decadent. I got the candied bacon on the side b/c I don't eat pork and my boyfriend said it was way too much. Might work well all together, though so not sure if that is really a negative. And the burger was amazing, albeit messy! Also had the cilantro and garlic fries-good stuff.  The only slightly negative I might add, though it's no fault of the restaurant so I won't deduct stars, is that there were a ton of children and strollers. Maybe it's just b/c it was Saturday brunch but the table next to us had a child (not a baby) who was screaming from the moment they walked in so it kind of ruined the ambience.

2015-04-27,1.0,"This review is written after several attempts to allow Fork to prove us wrong / get off our s***-list.  My girlfriend and I live a few buildings down from Fork and have been to Fork several times: for brunch, dinner, and drinks.  In more than one occurrence, the service was poor to the point of being offensive.  Allow me to explain: Instance #1: Breakfast. We arrived at Fork 20 minutes before opening on a Saturday, which was no big deal, we simply walked down the street to get a coffee from Grind.  Coming back at 10:05, five minutes after opening, we see that several groups of people had been seated, yet the restaurant could not have been more than 15-20% full at this point, and there was no one waiting to be seated besides us.  The hostess informed us it would be 15-20 minutes prior to being seated and that we could sit at the bar while we waited.  You could imagine our reaction at this point.  However, we sat at the bar, had a Bloody Mary (which was delicious) and waited patiently.  20 minutes go by and still we have not been seated.  My girlfriend went up the hostess, who was not more than 15 feet from us, to ask the status.  With much attitude, she dismissively told her that she was aware of us waiting and that'd it be another 10 minutes.  It's one thing to have to wait when a restaurant is obviously full, but all they had to do was seat us at a table and get us going with some coffee and we'd have had no issue.  The attitude towards us from the front of house staff was rude, curt, and dismissive, and not what you'd expect from any decent restaurant. Instance #2: Brunch - Sunday, 4/26/15 The Ravenswood 5K was being held in the area, which brought a lot of traffic to the local eateries, including Fork.  We arrived at 10:30 or so, and I put my name in on the waiting list.  They told me 20 minutes, and that they would text me.  Great, we'll wait and get a coffee, no big deal.  I checked in after 20 minutes, no update, told it would be longer.  After an hour, my girlfriend goes to check, and she is very rudely told by whoever the male host was that there's nothing he can do, people are eating their breakfast and you just have to wait.   Look, Fork.  You're busy, we get that.  But perhaps you could be honest with us form the get go and not quote an overly optimistic 20 minutes?  And when your estimate is off by over 40 minutes, perhaps instead of being rude and annoyed towards us, you could try being decent and apologetic?   We moved to wait inside, and were finally seated, perhaps due to the close proximity of our group (four people) to the host station.  Food took over an hour to get out and our waitress continued the trend of curtness and poor service.   Conclusion:  Fork's food is great, and their menu is fantastic.  If they're not busy, or you have a reservation, it's likely a good bet your service experience will be fine.  I would recommend to Fork that they work to improve their front of house experience on all levels.  You had tables sitting empty the entire time we were eating, all while people were waiting outside and inside the restaurant.",0.4349,0.866,0.064,0.069,0.468440303657695

Not sure I would step foot back into this establishment based on the service. Unfortunately, the friendliest & most helpful staff member was the busboy.  From the moment we walked in to a nearly empty restaurant, even the hostess tried to refuse to seat us at a booth because she said they were all reserved for dinner later in the evening. Whaaaat??? We got our booth & then got the cold shoulder.  The disappointing service continued when after ordering, we got our main entree before our appetizers. No one ever came back to check on us during our entire meal. We, ( meaning I ) had to get up & ask for clean dishes for our mussels. Our waitress never even came back to see how we were doing.  We would've ordered after dinner cocktails had someone paid the slightest bit of attention to us. The chef even came out & checked on 3 tables and didn't even look in our direction.  Almost no one had a smile on their face & when I asked who was the manager, I was advised they were not even in the building.  The waiter on the table to our left, must've checked in on the guests at least 5 times.  The only time we felt they even glanced our way was to free up the table as more dinner guests began to arrive.  Sadly, this is the poorest example of customer service I've ever received in a restaurant. I expected more.  Born & raised in this neighborhood, the transition has been exciting to witness. Sadly, I suspect that being of Latin American descent might have played a role in the inferior service we received. This is not what customer service should ever look like in any establishment.

Our group opted to share everything so we could try more of Fork's offerings. Highly recommend this approach! To start with, we had the bacon wrapped dates, garlic fries, mushroom flatbread, root veggie hash, lamb flatbread, and charcuterie plate. The charcuterie offerings at Fork are so impressive. They have a huge selection of both cheeses and meats and you can mix and match, everything we tried was delicious. The lamb flatbread and bacon wrapped dates were also standouts. For entrees, we had the mussels, which were fantastic. They came in a very rich and flavorful broth, highly recommend this. Other noteworthy entrees were the sweet potato gnocchi, very unique, and the shortrib, which was so tender and tasty. We shared a couple desserts that were on special, but sharing one or two between a group is more than enough after sharing multiple dishes at Fork! Portions are large and the savory dishes are very filling. Overall, Fork is definitely one of the best Lincoln Square spots. Warm and inviting interior, come in with a few friends and share some items.

I used to live 3 blocks from here and would come to this particular spot often when it was Square Kitchen. After Square Kitchen, I'm pretty sure there was another restaurant here before Fork took residence about 4 years ago. I had an absolutely fantastic experience. I sat at the bar and Mike, simply put, was awesome and made some great recommendations. The service was spectacular. I felt like I received everything I ordered within 1 minute of having ordered it. I don't know how they do what they do, but they do it so very well. The Sweet Potato Gnocchi (with shitake mushrooms, beer braised fennel, scallions, brussel kraut sauce, truffle oil & pecorino cheese) was unreal!!! The truffle oil was legit; you could taste the truffle. I also had a half order of the Belgian style mussels (as opposed to the French style Mussels offered) which were good. I've had better (Hopleaf), but these were not bad at all and were very serviceable. I recommend dipping the accompanying bread in the belgian ale broth. I finished off with an order of the bacon dates which are bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and drizzled with a delectable blue cheese sauce. These were bombs of sweet, salty and smoky flavor. They came with four and when I saved one for my brother and he realized how amazing they are, he also realized how much I must love him for having not finished them all off myself and for saving one for him. I had a beer that was great. In addition to also having a number of wine options, you can do a sampling by getting a wine flight. The atmosphere is perfect too. I love the natural exposed brick/wood combination and chic overall vibe. I would, without question, love to come back here before I leave and will definitely try to.

I had some tea (which was in a bag, not loose, bummer) and the roasted vegetable hash - veggies like beets, butternut squash, and more.  It's a seasonal dish, the veggies in the hash apparently change throughout the year, but are always served with arugula and eggs over easy.  The dish was really filling but was a great healthy option.  I loved the colorful veggies, and they tasted great especially after I broke the yolk and it poured out all over them.  This dish comes with toast, and even though it's vegetarian I know it will fill you up.

After i created my perfect bite of bacon, waffle, syrup, and chicken... my mouth was filled with happiness. The combination of the fluffy waffle, brined juicy chicken, crispy skin, and candied bacon was the perfect balance of flavors to complement the existing textures and salty and sweet flavor. Hands down best fried chicken and waffles I've ever had. The fried chicken itself is probably one of the better pieces of fried chicken I've had in a while, and the waffle was absolutely perfect.       The smoked salmon benedict was equally as satisfactory. The salmon was smoked in house and (coming from someone from seattle) was amazingly delicious. The smoky flavor paired beautifully with the bloodorange hollandaise sauce and runny egg.       I had to think for a while what i wanted my ""last bite"" of food to be. i ended up choosing the fried chicken and waffle bite, and i left fork in pure happiness.

Everything about our experience was on point.  We were quoted 30-45 minutes for a wait, but got seated in 15! The hostess was super accommodating and friendly. The bloodys were fantastic. We then proceeded to order (nearly) everything off the menu and eat tapas style. The bacon wrapped dates were amazing! As was the ""hangover helper."" My absolute favorite was the ""eggplant caviar"". There were a couple items on the menu that they ran out of (and I can totally understand why- all of the food is so good). Our server was such a good sport about it- he even had us pause our ordering as he ran to reserve the last ""hangover helper"" for us before it ran out. We were eternally grateful.

The front area is big enough that we didn't feel like we were in the way of people coming and going. The inside is nicer than I was expecting, but it's not like we felt out of place in casual clothes. Looking for something small, I had the duck liver mousse (foie gras for the fancypants). Never had it before and had no idea what to expect, but with the grape jam, white port gelee and the small, perfectly toasted pieces of bread, it was so, so good. Very rich, smooth like butter and delicate. Garlic cilantro fries -- a bit passable. Could use more garlic. There's also an extensive beer/wine menu, which you can all get as flights. They're divided by cost so if you want to mix and match, you pay per sample, otherwise you pick 3-4 for one set price.

The best of the evening... 5 star service - our server was a very gracious and unassuming guy who took great care of us -- really good food -- my favs were the Cheese and Charcuterie selections, the beef skewers with amazing hummus, the pulled pork sliders, and the beet salad. Tastes of each were enough to call it a meal. The wines selection was top notch...a really interesting mix... I tried a French Syrah that was delicious (and not something I usually drink).

Big comfortable space with large windows that bring the outside in.  In our case, a warm rainy night, which made the place feel more cozy and comfortable. This giant guy came over from behind the bar to take our order.  At first we were a little intimidated as he kind of looked like someone you'd see on Ice Road Truckers or Ax Men, but he was a gentle giant, couldn't have been nicer and was spot on in his food recommendations.

The service was as average as the food.  $100 for a dry brisket sandwich, average chicken burger and a sweet (NOT spicy as requested) bottle of red.  And the smores dessert?  Chocolate chip cookies with fluff.  It was gross.  We barely touched it - but our server didn't say a word.  Just took it away!

One of our favorites is the bacon wrapped dates.  These delectable treats are not what you would find at your typical tapas restaurant.  Fork puts a savory spin on these typical sweet appetizers.  The sauce is a cream based, peppery delight that plays so well with the sweetness of the dates.  Try it. Today, I tried the poutine which is a delicious combination of french fries, shredded duck confit which is then covered with cheddar cheese sauce and a delicious duck gravy.  The result is a super rich dish that became a much higher dish than the combination of its parts. The Bloody Marys are, if ordered spicy, will burn your tonsils but in a delicious way.

The pretzel bites had the right amount of crunch on the outside with a fluffy inside/middle.  We also both had the flight of mimosas. This is a great idea as most places don't offer you the chance to try different varieties. We decided we wanted to go with regular mimosas for the rest of the meal.

Even though we rolled up without reservations and the place was busy, the hostess was so nice and accommodating and tried really hard to get us a spot. We ended up only having to wait 15 minutes. That must be some sort of brunch record. Our waitress, Kathryn K, was also extremely nice and helpful, and not in that overly peppy annoying way some waiters/waitresses wanting tips can be (especially when you're hungover). She even let us split the check individually between the 9 of us. This is unheard of, people. We would give Fork 5 stars for service alone, but the food and drink also deserve praise. The brunch menu is extensive and you can also choose from the lunch menu, which includes their poutine, which is out of this world, which means it is really good, which means you should try it.

We came about an hour before closing on a Wednesday night, and there were still plenty of people there. I usually take that as a good sign, and I was not wrong. I'd been wanting to try Fork for months because I drive past it on my way to work and it's always busy, so I'm very glad that my expectations were well met. We started off with some of the cheese and house-made charcuterie. I can't remember which two cheeses we got, but they were both soft, like brie. I believe one was Camembert though. They were both fantastic. We also got the duck prosciutto, chorizo, and country pork paté. All three were VERY good. I would definitely go back just to try some more of the house-made selections. I loved the cornichons (or tiny pickles, as I like to call them), pickled onions, and olives that came on the side as well. They were perfect accompaniments. The dish that I know I will be craving in the near future though... The Fork poutine. Oh. My. God. The amount of duck they put on it... I felt like we were ripping them off by only paying $11 for the dish! It was a tad salty, but for that kind of a dish, I like salty. The saltiness came from the duck confit, which went so well with the fries instead of the traditional gravy. Definitely will be returning for that dish soon.  We finished with a small order of the mac and cheese. They use three cheeses, and oh my, was it good. Not salty, like a lot of mac and cheeses can be, just perfectly cheesy and noodley (I know that's not a word, but I don't care.) We couldn't finish it though because we were so stuffed from everything else, and it actually reheated pretty well the next day. Overall a great experience at Fork.

Looking over the menu we saw so many things that sounded delicious but it had been a long time since I had duck confit hash -- in fact, since I can't get it in the town we moved to, I only have it when I make it myself. We ordered that and the grape tomato goat cheese omelet, as an egg white omelet.  The hash was exactly what I hoped for. But the omelet surpassed expectations - I had thought it would be a very familiar treatment. Instead, the tomatoes were quite a surprise. Yes, there were the grape tomatoes as described in the menu, but they shared the spotlight with a kind of tomato confit- a sauce that had a thick rich taste, very fresh, not too sweet, highlighted with basil. I've heard that the test of a great chef is in their ability to make the ordinary extraordinary -  it was just perfect",0.9896,0.788,0.196,0.016,0.6138888888888889

If you've never had Truffle Tremor Goat Cheese...go find some - it's truly amazing. Our entrees were the Wild King Salmon and the muscles in a dill broth. I'm not doing those descriptions justice - they were both specials for the evening and both were tremendous. Only complaint was the salmon was a bit overcooked. We were full after that, but chef brought out a good carrot cake w carrot sorbet. Then he brought out probably our favorite bite of the night.

We typically make reservations on the weekend because it is always busy, especially when it is nice out.  The outdoor seating is great, right a long the side of the restaurant.  The hosts are super friendly and very accommodating when possible.   Julio is usually our server and he always makes it a great experience for us at Fork.  He is very knowledgeable on the food, the beer and the wine.  He makes great recommendations for drinks,  I can honestly say the staff is very well trained on the product. The menu is very consistent, we usually go for brunch or lunch.  We have on occasion been there for dinner.  I typically order a nice crisp beer and we almost always start off with the duck crostini's.  They nice thin cuts of duck breast with this delicious jam, cheese, an arugula leaf and truffle oil all sitting on a nice piece of small crusty bread.  Perfect bite to get things started.  You get two in the order.  Then we move on to bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and covered in a tasty blue cheese sauce that works so well with the sweetness of the date.   Since its the weekend, I have to order eggs.  I usually get the duck confit hash!  If you like duck confit, you will love this dish.  Its a nice combination of potato hash with duck confit and arugula.   It is just a heavenly mixture.  Sitting on top of all that is a couple of sunny side up eggs.  Paired with a couple slices of wheat toast, its the perfect breakfast.  Wifey usually gets the Florentine Benedict, its your typical eggs Benedict but with spinach.  The other day they had a special braised short rib Benedict, i was jealous of wifey for ordering it. I love coming here and I highly recommend it to everyone to try it.  It has a great variety of dishes.  I've tried something from each category and I can say I have not been disappointed.  The staff is wonderful, management is helpful, the food and drink selections are great.  Give it a go... do it!",0.9976,0.784,0.204,0.012,0.6009243697478993

My sister is a foodie and carefully reviewed the menu in detail with the manager, which she had to do from afar in LA. We didn't bring a cake, but rather chose dessert items from their standard menu.  The space was ideal for our party size of roughly 35 people. The private room had space for a gift table and a space for the 'crafts' that we set up: a decorating station for onesies and bibs. The room was intimate enough to play a few shower games but was still large enough to stand and mingle. We brought minimal decor. The space is homey and comfortable.

2014-05-19,4.0,"I've been to Fork four times so far, three times for dinner, and once for brunch.   I'm a def a fan.  Make a reservation though for the peak hours or else there can be a bit of a wait.  I think they quoted a 45min wait for brunch one time, so we went somewhere else.  However, given the area-wait times aren't uncommon during peak hours.   They have a nice variety of drinks.   I'm a beer fan, and they have flights!!  My girlfriend isn't as big of a beer fan, but loves wine...and they do wine flights!!  They also have cocktails, sangria, and other drinks as well as non-alcoholic options.  So, booze for all!  The beer list covers a lot of ground from brews from down the street (literally, they have Half Acre which is a few blocks down on Lincoln) to imports to the familiar domestics.  When you go here, come thirsty.  The only catch-they take the drink menu when you order your food....so, either ask to keep it or pull it up via your phone.  It makes sense since at least the tables for 2 are on the smaller side, but hey-that is the biggest negative I can think of about this place.  Try the Beermosa for brunch!   The food!!   I've had their 23 flavors brisket, prime farm house burger, and then the Hangover Helper for brunch.  The brisket has a great sauce, was very tender, and the texas toast was just toasty enough to not get soggy with the mound of delicious beef.  The burger was good-nice flavorful meat with nice toppings.  The Hang Over Helper is their version of a breakfast bowl (biscuit, meat, eggs, bacon, cheese, and gravy).  If that was on the menu all day, I'd get it at least 50% of the time I go there.  The food is priced quite well, you can spend a lot if you want, but most entrees are around $15 with the other courses being in the $5-10 range.  We typically spend more on booze than food here.   The service has been good.   All of our waiters/waitresses have been good with timely drink refills, checking in on us, and clearing plates.  It seems like they employ a bit of a team here as opposed to solely one server-there have been times where when they see an empty beer glass, they'll offer another even if they aren't our main waiter.  My favorite time so far, was when we sat at the bar during the week.  The bartender was nice, funny, and extremely helpful.  She knew a ton about wine, and answered and educated my girlfriend about them while ensuring that my beer glass wasn't ever empty until I said when.     The decor/seating is pretty good/cozy overall.   The vibe is entirely different for brunch than for dinner.  They have two rooms plus outdoor seating.  We went once when it was snowing and got seated by the front windows...that was a drafty meal, to the point we put our sweatshirts on.  We've sat at the bar (read about for my views of that), in the middle of the main room, and once in the second room.  My preference, in order, is: Bar, 2nd room, middle of main, by the windows.  The second room has a fireplace, and was a bit quieter than the main room with a bit more shoulder space.  I'm not a small guy (about 6ft 2, 230....I'm a power lifter), so shoulder/belly space can be an issue for me when the tables are jammed together or when sitting at a bar.  I've yet to have that issue at Fork.  The place is mostly darker wood and brick colors inside with the same color wooden chairs.  It feels like it has been there forever, well maintained, and upgraded over time.  Not a dive feel at all, but not so incredibly fancy/upscale that you would feel out of place wearing jeans.  Maybe not a band t-shirt, but not much more than that.   Overall, I'll def be going back, probably within 3 weeks.  We went twice last weekend, once for date night, and once for brunch.  They have a great menu that I plan on trying at least half of, great service, and awesome drinks.  The price range I put, includes 2-3 drinks each.",0.9981,0.856,0.128,0.016,0.4874772313296903

My friends and I all enjoyed the Spicy Reds. Great wine! For food, the best thing on the menu is the bacon date chorizo appetizer: oh my GOD! I have never seen bacon date apps this big...each piece is four times the size of the typical version, and so, so good. I could eat a bunch of these for dinner and be fully satisfied (and fat...but happy fat). The asparagus flatbread pizza was good, but perhaps had a tad bit much asparagus, at least for my taste.

Once we did find parking and got into the restaurant, everything was great. We started off with drink flights. I had crisp white wines, my husband had some sort of bourbon barrel brewed flight, I think. We both enjoyed every pick - wine and beer, which was quite unusual for us. The takeaway: Fork has great beer and wine. We started with 2 small plates - the poutine and the chicken and dumplings. The dumplings were butternut squash gnocchi and the chicken was cooked to perfection. The real scene stealer for me though was the poutine. Oh my goodness. I don't know if it was the cheese, the gravy, the duck confit, or just the mixture of them all together but this was one of my favorite dishes I've had in a long time. We rounded out our impromptu meal with a cheese and charcuterie plate. We had a couple cheeses (can't remember the names) that were delicious. We added the house-cured duck prosciutto and we very pleased. You really can't go wrong with any of the meats and cheeses, in my opinion. Finally, the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.

My friends and I used to frequent a number of places in Lincoln Square, becoming regulars. As much as we wanted to continue to go to the other places, we just couldn't deny that the food at Fork is better. Worlds better really. I go for brunch and for dinner, usually on the weekend. As for the brunch they have a number of creative entrees (I like the salmon eggs benedict and brioche French toast for a change-up); everyone has their favorite and even simple items are excellent. Dinner is likewise varied in terms of the choices but always excellent and a gourmet experience. Appetizers, extras, coffee, and ciders are delicious as well. Service is superb, I will particularly mention Lauren, Katie, Stephanie, Cesar, & Kelly (and Bailey too) but no matter what you feel taken care of and appreciated as a customer. Even the chef will take care of you if he notices something.  The atmosphere is comfortable and unhurried. It manages to be a good environment both for dates and for groups, and families fit in as well during the Saturday and Sunday brunches. You have to ignore the earlier reviews for Fiddlehead which was always a mediocre place. Since Fork came in it is very difficult to go anywhere else nearby-- for food it is head and shoulders above places like Bad Dog, Daily Grill, Grafton or Latitude.",0.9944,0.7,0.245,0.055,0.5691220238095239

However, I really wish they would streamline their drink service and add additional bartenders, especially for busy weekend nights and brunches. On a recent Saturday, we waited nearly 20 minutes for our two glasses of wine. It isn't the server's fault - with one bartender to serve the entire restaurant, plus wait on all the patrons at the bar, it's completely understandable.  The back-up then spills over and customers wait longer in general.

We've enjoyed the food, but it's never been a favorite. Tonight's visit was spontaneous, almost accidental, and for dinner -- but  well-rewarded.  We wanted to go ""light.""  So I had their French chacuterie -- good, but not memorable.  What made up for this was a spectacular crabmeat ""Slider.""  The diminuative title did not prepare me for the substantial sandwich that arrived on the table:: the so-called Slider was an almost 2 inch high production of crab, slaw, sauce, and roll, with a half-moon slice of apple toothpicked on top. This delightful creation rang several changes at once:  a hot, crispy fried patty of sweet crabmeat, contrasting with the coldness and mild vinegar taste of the slaw and the soft bun, all happily married in the middle, with  Mornay sauce presiding.  It was delicious and so well constructed that it held together to the last bite.  Fran had a beautiful light beet and goat cheese salad, followed by a wonderful mushroom dish with egg, presented in a small frying pan -- just the right touch in presenttion, combined with a fine combination of flavors. Our vanilla bean creme brule was topped with a welcome extra-thick layer of carmelized sugar, and big enough for two.  (Even though I was forced to undertake the lonely task by myself). My only quibble is what I remembered only when my cocktail arrived --I thought, yipes,  I made the mistake again!  I simply don't like their drinks.  They incline to overly sour or bitter,. On an earlier visit I sent back a margarita and even the re-make was undrinkable. (The original turned out to be their signature drink).  Tonight it was a Sidecar, the drink famed as the ideal combination of strong, sweet, and sour, normally served with sugar around the rim.  It came with no sugar and no detectable orange flavor from the sweet liqueur ingredient.  I assume their nod to sweet is the sangria, but I would have hoped they could do better with at least one of their actual cocktails. That aside, a fine meal!  But how about it, Fork?  Come up with a sweet one and you can  the Skip Landt.",0.9981,0.729,0.227,0.044,0.54505291005291

I for one am definitely a fan, particularly of their Sunday brunch.  They just so happen to have my favorite brunch entree in all of Chicago, so get ready: Fried chicken and waffles.   That's right.   If I could have any brunch entree at any restaurant in all of Chicago, I would pick Fork's fried chicken and waffles.  Personally, it's the best fried chicken I've had in Chicago.  And yes, I've had Longman & Eagle's fried chicken and waffles and it is simply not as good.  Fork's fried-chicken is incredibly juicy and the crust is nice and thick and moist, probably due to their buttermilk batter.  I love it, it's great.  The waffles are fine (hard to get excited about waffles personally) but the fried chicken is the show stopper.  Absolutely fantastic. As for dinner, Fork is also a quality choice.  They have a nice eclectic variety of options, which kind of have the whole farm-to-table thing going on, which is cute, but also typically delicious.  Can't go wrong with good old-fashioned burger either, and Fork's burgers, while nothing amazing, will almost always hit the spot. Lastly, they've got a more than solid craft brew selection, and they offer beer flights which I always enjoy.  Service is fine.   So while Fork may not be a super-amazing restaurant, it is certainly a good, solid option.  I would say that their brunch is great, largely due to their delectable fried-chicken, so you really can't go wrong at Fork for brunch.  One of the best brunch options in the city in my book, and a very good restaurant overall.",0.998,0.662,0.278,0.059,0.6343343051506317

I loved the ambiance, it was perfectly lit and had a warm vibe. We ordered several small plates, including the corn, pulled pork, mussels, and the duck. We also ordered a 3 cheese plate. I didn't like a lot of what we ordered. I normally love pulled pork but I couldn't even finish one bite of the one we ordered, it was way too sweet and it just didn't taste good, my husband didn't like it either. The mussels were cold and the sauce had no flavor.  The roasted corn was AMAZING. It had sweet bacon bits and onions mixed in and it was so flavorful. The cheese platter was also very delicious. We ordered the special pumpkin cheesecake desert which was TO DIE FOR! It was freshly made and it was very unique. I might go back just to have that. The service was great, our waiter was very nice and he was timely.  Overall, the food was just okay. I would like to go back and try other things on the menu. I liked the vibe and feel of the restaurant it was very cozy and comfortable. And the service was good.

2013-09-20,2.0,"Is it bad that I thought the best part of my meal was the conversation?  My friend and I arrived at Fork for dinner on a Thursday night and we were promptly seated. First thing I noticed were chunks of things stuck to the inside of my water glass. Disgusting. I looked around at other (empty) tables to see if I could grab a clean glass, and the glasses within reach were dirty as well. Ick.  We waited and waited for a server to take our order. Finally a guy who I think was the manager came over and said ""Your waitress will be right over, she's in the middle of a conversation with someone."" Really? Uh, OK. He began to fill our water glasses and I quickly asked for a clean one. He said ""You're right, let me find you a clean one."" OK, water glasses filled now. Waiting, waiting...Finally our waitress came over and took our drink & food order. It took a while to get our beer and then our food arrived quickly after that - brought to us by someone else. My friend had the small order of mussels, and I had the house-smoked brisket. I was a bit disappointed. It arrived as an open-faced sandwhich, which was fine, but the brisket was dry and needed more BBQ sauce because of it. The greens on the side were just that, greens, nothing else but the dressing in a little cup. The dressing was good, but the greens could have had an additional topping like tomatoes or cucumbers.  I asked my friend how she liked the mussels. She said they were good. At one point I heard some crunching coming from across the table. I looked up and asked ""Is that sand?"" and she said ""Yes."" Now, I know mussels can have sand in them, but to be able to hear it from across the table kind of wigged me out. My friend doesn't chew with her mouth open.  We finished our meals and sat for quite a while before our plates were taken away. I can understand if your tables are full and you're short-staffed that it can take a while, but the place was practically empty. Once the plates were removed by our waitress, we sat and waited again. And the hostess came over with the dessert menu. We took a pass, waited for our bill, then paid it and left.  It might have been an 'off' night for Fork, but I'm in no hurry to go back.",0.9828,0.864,0.104,0.032,0.553469387755102

We loved being able to sit by the open window. The service was excellent! We never had to ask for a refill for water ( I love that!! ) The food was outstanding!!  I love that you can order flights of wine. I started with a spicy red flight and my husband had the European flight. Both were delicious! We started with one of the appetizer specials : Watermelon with aged balsamic, prosciutto, and parm (I believe) It was AMAZING!! We loved it and could not stop eating it. We next had the house pretzels with half acre beer cheese sauce. These were the best pretzels and cheese sauce we have had! Again we couldn't stop eating, but we had to because we knew we were going to be too full :) Next we had a small order of mussels. WE LOVE MUSSELS! These mussels were in the most unique sauce. The server said to save bread for the sauce and I am so glad we did, it was a blend of melted goat cheese, white wine and spices that was so delicious! I could have licked the bowl. We next had The mushroom crostini. It was very flavorful and again we couldn't stop eating it! For our main plate we ordered pulled pork with root beer bbq sauce. The pork fell apart, so moist, very unique and tasty! I loved the root beer. We ended our tasting journey with a variety of cheeses and the most amazing chocolate mousse. The mousse had the perfect texture and the toffee bacon was incredible. There was not an overwhelming bacon taste and it complimented the mousse perfectly. We had such an incredible experience. The price point for this caliber of food was spot on. What a great night! We can't wait to come back and try some new specials and have some menu staples. Thank you for a delicious meal Chef Tim!

2013-09-16,5.0,"This was a first: Never have I been chased down the block by a restaurant owner.  It's not nearly as crazy as it sounds.  In fact, it was quite touching.  My party and I had shown up at prime dinner hour on a weekend, no reservation--of course there was going to be a wait.  We waited a bit, but then our hunger got the better of us and we headed down the street to look for somewhere less busy.  Then we heard quick footsteps behind us on the sidewalk.  It was the owner! He apologized for the wait and implored us to return.  He probably had a million other things to do, and not to mention the promise of other willing customers, but he felt bad that we'd waited 20 minutes instead of the promised 10-15.  It was such a genuine gesture on his part, and a true reflection of Fork's service in general.  Usually you only notice service when it's bad, but Fork's staff are skilled at somehow letting you know that they're taking good care of you without being fussy or pretentious.  This was maybe my third or fourth time at the restaurant, and the staff have always been friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.   I really can't praise them enough and am truly surprised to see that this place isn't rated more highly here. As for the food: I've tried a good portion of the menu and have been impressed all around.  Some favorites include the summer squash ""spaghetti"" and the eggplant ""caviar,"" both delicious.  Have also really enjoyed the charcuterie, cheeses, poutine (a little on the salty side, but still great), and mac n' cheese.  The presentation is attractive without trying too hard.  And to say that the wine and beer list is extensive would be a grave understatement.

I would say that although 3/4 of those times was great, the latest 1/4 was bad enough that I would reconsider going there again for brunch.  I'll start with what I've liked and move on to the most recent debacle in service. (yes, service, not food).  The good: Dinner food has always been great. Dinner service always great. In fact, I'd count it among my options I present to out-of-town visitors when we're considering dinner options in Lincoln Square. The atmosphere is interesting but not pretentious and I've never enountered any difficulties with wait or service at dinner. Plus, they have interesting flights whether it's cheese, charcuterie, or the hands down favorite--the beer flights. It lets you try out a variety and if you like one enough that you want more, you can always order it. It's a nice option though.  Brunch first time around was fine. Our party of 5 arrived right about opening time, great service, food was good, no compaints.  Brunch second time was bad enough to make me re-think this as a future brunch option. We arrived about 5 minutes after the restaurant opened, on a day when there was a local run even in the neighborhood. That makes me think: management should prepare for more customers than usual. What we arrived to however, was a few scattered tables that were full, but many many empty tables. Great news, right? Not so....even though we were just a party of 3, we were gruffly informed by the host that they the number of people they had seated had exceeded their number of menus and they would not seat any additional parties until the seated parties had ordered, freeing up menus. Ok.....seems odd that you have less than half the menus available for the seating you have, on a morning you could expect extra volume...but we found it even stranger that you couldn't at least seat us and just let us wait for a menu to become available. Instead, a crowd of waiting customers accumulated at the host station and out the door. With a restaurant half full of empty tables. Not only that, but it was within 10 minutes of opening. so we waited...and as soon as a few spare menus opened up, the party of two who arrived behind us was seated...after that another party of four, until we asked why we weren't being seated. By the way, there were never any apologies, never any assurances--the communication from the host stand was that it was reasonable that we should wait for a free menu in order to be seated.  After some negotiating, we finally were, but after waiting a good 20 minutes (keep in mind, multiple multiple tables were available just to sit and have coffee while we waited for menus). After being seated the service and food were fine. But the front end experience was enough that I don't think I'll go back, especially with the many other brunch options in the neighborhood that treat customers more respectfully...and I actually think based on this experience, I would not risk going for dinner for fear of the ""menu deficit."" I suspect this is poor management and feel bad as the food and waitservice has always been good but it's bad business to make multiple parties wait to be seated until menus are available when half the seats in the restaurant are open. News flash: you should have enough menus to cover all the seats, especially on a weekend with an event that will bring more business to you.

We looked at the menu and their prices was decent to the type of food they offered - We ordered the bacon-wrapped dates - Which in my mind was the best thing you could have ordered for an appetizer.

Shaken and then poured, and with a beer chaser coming standard! Chicago only puts tomato juice with vokda and hot sauce, sick!!! You are so close to Wisconsin and you can't get creative?

I was starting to get sick so my appetite wasn't all together there. I did however order poutine for the whole table and I got the soup and grilled cheese option. The poutine was delicious! My grilled cheese was a little salty, but I appreciate the two types of cheese and bacon. I also liked that I had an option of tomato or mushroom soup. Went with the mushroom and it was yummy. My husband exclaimed that he had the best french toast ever. It was a bananas foster inspired brioche french toast with just the right amount of sweetness and crunch.

First, the wine and beer selections were both carefully chosen and reasonably priced (my favorite combo). I'm a big fan of the wine flights. The food itself was fabulous - a nice blend of old time favorites and completely new flavorful twists. The kale salad was out of this world. The mussels (which I order pretty much everywhere I go) were among my favorite - both flavorful and extremely meaty and tender. Everything we had was great. I am not ordinarily a huge fan of the growing trend to include grits with dinner meals in Chicago, because most Chicago chefs do not get it right, but the grits here were the best I have had outside of the South and complimented the BBQ sauce well - we scraped the plate clean. The chef is big on farm to table, which is important to us when we're looking for a nice meal on the town - it was evident during every course that each ingredient was meticulously chosen and gingerly prepared. I would highly recommend for both a fun date night or a big group (they have great booth spots).",0.9977,0.688,0.303,0.009,0.5915568954854669

The sauce is delicious, especially when soaked up with the toasted bread provided with the dish. The garlic cilantro fries are good, not sure if they are worth the extra money though since the regular fries are good as well! The bacon-wrapped dates appetizer is amazing. Then again, I think bacon-wrapped dates anywhere are good, but theirs have a blue cheese dipping sauce that is perfect with the dates. Now on to my favorite part... wine flights and cheese plates. I would come just for this alone, since in life I would prefer to just live off of cheese and wine. What's nice about both of these is that you can order their planned selections or you can order your own mix. Wine flights are grouped in threes but you can also order wines in the 6oz or 2.5oz size on their own. The cheese plates also have pre-set options, OR you can mix your own selections together for a plate. Perfection. Don't forget about dessert. Delicious options, and if you get the ice cream (which I would normally never order for dessert at a restaurant because I'd rather just go to an ice cream place), you can pick three different flavors for the little scoops they give you, and can choose from unique flavors like blood orange or pear moscato sorbet, banana, pumpkin, porter, something or other chocolate with bacon, etc. YUM.",0.9954,0.784,0.198,0.018,0.6181782209559988

Plus I wanted to validate that ""Chorizo check. Dates check. Bacon check. Is pretty much an orgasm in your mouth,"" as he said, especially when it's drizzled in blue cheese. Honestly, if you go to Fork and don't get this dish, you are seriously missing out! To give you a full sense of the experience though, I feel like I should take a step back.  From the moment I walked in, I had a good vibe about this place as the hostess warmly greeted us with some sarcastic comment like, ""oh no, god forbid your fifteen minutes late,"" which quickly put us at ease and affirmed it was not a pretentious place. Taking in the surroundings as she escorted us to our table, I couldn't help feeling warm and cozy in the rustic setting with funky-patterned couches, distressed wooden tables and a brick wall decorated with country-inspired art. Admittedly, I had a couple of tasty bourbon cocktails before we went to dinner though and I was in good company, so that could have contributed to it. We decided to go the wine flight route as it had been recommended on a previous review and we both really enjoy the whole wine tasting experience. I got the European Red flight and he got the Pinot Noir flight, both of which enveloped us in luscious berry flavors, spice and vanilla, with a smooth finish. Although I have to say, I wasn't a fan of my last glass as there was a little too much licorice flavor in it for me, but to each his own. I would definitely recommend doing the wine flight though, as it not only complemented the food, but it made for a good conversation starter too. Now onto the food. We had the bacon dates stuffed with chorizo, as I mentioned earlier, and the burrata smear to start, which came with pistachio pesto, fleur de sel and tomato jam that we spread onto toasted bread. It was soooo good! And it came in a cute little mason jar on a personalized cutting board, which was adorable. Then we had gnocchi with foraged and tame mushrooms, fennel, parmesan cream and truffle oil. Need I say more?! It honestly melt it your mouth it was so good. We finished with the rack of lamb, which was presented well, but was a bit dry and bland for both of our liking.

Allow me to elaborate.  They have snacks, salads, soups, pates, HUGE cheese selection (almost overwhelming), charcuterie, small plates and large plates.  You can try a lot of food here, which is what we did.  Let's not forget about the wine options.  They have several flights to choose from and an excellent ""key"" that describes each wine (E.g., bold, buttery, jammy, spicy, etc)  It was very helpful. They also have a Port flight. Score! On the menu: -Bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese dressing: GENIUS to add blue cheese dressing. It gives it more moisture which sometimes the dates need. - French onion soup - definitely on the sweeter side, which I don't love but I ate the entire crock and ordered it a second time. I cannot resist melted cheese - Beet Salad - Mmmm. It has pears mixed in which I loved - Mixed Greens - standard. no complaints - Duck Poutine - DING DING DING. We have a winner!!!! Pls get this. You will love it. They pour a cheese sauce and then gravy at your table. mmmmmm. more please - mac n cheese - order the small plate. it's big, rich and delicious.   - Dessert = volcano type toffee cake goodness.

When he finished, she told him ""6.50"" and then put the ten he gave her in her tip jar.  A server yelled at a busboy to bus tables right in front of us.  Like uncomfortably loud.

The pork chop made you wanna scarf it down in about 30 seconds it was that good.  The chop was cooked perfectly, was super juicy and was on a bed of spaghetti squash, bourbon glaze and some candied pecans.  It was amazing.  We were e-mailing this morning about how good it was.  If you want a Chop....go to Fork...you'll leave wanting to lick the place. If you want a finger licking, awesome feeling, super served meal at a great local Chicago restaurant.... eat at Fork.  Don't think about it, you'll be super satisfied!",0.9973,0.772,0.201,0.027,0.5790504248837584

2012-10-26,3.0,"Fork is definitely more than three stars, but isn't quite deserving of a true four star ranking. That aside, here's how my recent trip breaks down: I made a reservation for 7pm on a Thursday night, and the restaurant was about half full when I arrived. Not quite necessary, but it's nice to accrue those opentable points! The drinks: My friend and I both decided to try one of their wine flight offerings. I opted for the Pinot Noir flight, and I was satisfied with it. The wines obviously weren't outstanding, but they weren't the cheapest swill from the bottom of the barrel of wine selections. We asked the waiter for his suggestion of a nicer hard cheese that would pair well with our wine, and he recommended the Three Year Cheddar which was wonderfully tangy and had a nice subtle undertone of herbs. I was a fan of this and it was served with a few pieces of bread, apple, and candied pecans.  The food: We decided to share a few small plates and settled on the root vegetable hash and one of their specials. The vegetable hash was amazing--I adore fall vegetables and I liked their unique spin on the vegetables. They lightly sauteed celery root, carrots, parsnips, fennel, sweet potatoes and onions and topped it with fresh arugula and a fried egg. The vegetables were well seasoned and weren't doused in butter or an oil, and the fried egg on top made the dish very savory and slightly rich. I could have eaten this alone and been satisfied. But... I'm glad I didn't! The special of the evening was a pheasant sausage with squash, green beans, and light beans. The pheasant was lightly spiced and sliced thin among the vegetables. It had a similar overall seasoning on the dish as the vegetable hash, and the only ""alarming"" fact of this is my concern that all their dishes may be seasoned similarly. That aside, it all was very tasty and my friend and I enjoyed every bite. The service: They were prompt, but certainly not friendly. The waiter seemed a bit put out when we asked for a recommendation on the cheese.  The atmosphere: Not too loud, not too quiet. I loved how we weren't sandwiched in to the point of hearing what the tables around us were saying. Major points there. I'll definitely be back to try their beer list and their brunch. Hopefully my next experiences will boost up the rating to the four stars that it has almost achieved in my eyes.",0.9977,0.761,0.199,0.04,0.5603330220977281

I wasn't that impressed with the chicken, though. While it was seasoned pretty well, the coating of the chicken wasn't crispy and the actual meat was a little dry.

Fork promotes itself as a gastropub but is really much more of casual bar that has gastroish items on the menu with a big beer list. Service was slow but friendly and overall it was adequate. Regarding food we wanted the pretzels and beer cheese but they were out, bummer of a start.  Grilled corn elotes were not anything to get excited about.  Very small amount of corn with minimal seasoning, though the aioli was amazing.  And the corn was probably a touch undercooked. Watermelon gazpacho was a-okay but not a lot of flavor.  I am not a watermelon lover so take that with a grain of salt. Next up was the mushroom flatbread.  Crispy crust but a little flimsy in the center.  Ingredients were good.  Overall a pretyy good item.    I ordered the chicken burger.  It was well cooked and seasoned with a nice roll and decadent cheese, they advertise it has peaches on it but there were almost no peaches on there and the ones that were on the burger were razor thin with NO TASTE.   Lose the peaches or add more.  In any event, this one was okay but not great. Shrimp and grits were runny.  Also, they could use more shrimp.  I would not order this one. Mac and cheese was very good but probably too rich.  The first few bites are amazing but once you get about 5 bites in the jarlsberg and fontina can overwhelm you.   So I am torn.  Nothing was great and they do try to be creative so I give them credit.  I'd say it is a-okay.",0.9896,0.729,0.189,0.082,0.5312698412698411

Tim is the kind of Chef worth following to any new restaurant and we were happy to find that again, he has created dishes to die for.  He has only been here a few weeks so i am excited to see what other new things he brings to this place. The small plates were so fun to share but they also had special sliders and other great small bites. I don't even like lamb but I liked it here!  The space is beautiful yet casual, amazing beer on tap, great drink pairing with the food.  Also, great area!!

The service is typically very good. We had a minor mix-up with our server on a recent visit which was really no one's fault, but our server went WAY above and beyond the call of duty and sent us home with a bottle of wine! (Fork sells carry-out wine and cheese that can be purchased whether you're dining there or not.) My wife and I were both shocked but very impressed at how much they clearly care about their customers (or at least this particular server), and the lengths she went to to make sure we had a pleasant evening and would come back again. My only complaint is that the weird trip-hoppy/electronic/world music they play is pretty awful, but we've spent so much time making fun of it that now it's just a running joke that provides a few laughs with each visit.  Other perks: there are two TVs at the bar if you want to check in on a baseball game or something, but if you're not interested you'd hardly notice them.

When it was time for the bill, they overcharged us for the bottle of wine that we ordered.  The waiter caught it as I was re-checking the price again so I'll give them that.

I would HIGHLY recommended the beer flights, generous pours and the price was about right.  The ambiance/vibe is very chill, relaxed and really makes for a nice dining environment.  The place is self-described as a gastropub type restaurant, but it's really much more casual and less pretentious than some of the other gastropubs (Hopleaf, anyone?) around town.  Our waitress was really friendly and overall, pretty attentive.  It was a nice evening too, so the windows were open to the sidewalk street, which made for a nice urban dining setting.  Now, let's get to food. We ordered the garlic-cilantro french fries as a starter.  Below-average.  I love garlic and cilantro and french fries, so I thought this combo would be fantastic.  Instead, the garlic was really over powering and the fries themselves were underwhelming.  They almost tasted microwaved, as the texture was a little moist and soft.  Not good. My fiancee and her Mom ordered the mushroom gnocchi to share.  It was good, not great though the variety of mushrooms was a nice touch.  I've had better gnocchi at many other restaurants around Chicago.  I ordered the Farmhouse Burger MEDIUM-WELL and it arrived cooked medium-rare, almost raw.  I was starving, so I decided instead of complaining and having to wait for another burger, to just dig in.  I ate maybe 1/4 of the burger and had to stop.  Interestingly, our waitress noticed the preparedness of the burger, apologized, and took it back to the kitchen to show the cooks.  At this point, I'm expecting the burger to be taken off our bill, but instead we received a couple scoops of ice cream as an apology.  Gee, thanks.   This is a place we'll probably hit-up again, but probably just for drinks.  As I said, the beer list is great and the beers flights are even better, but NONE of the food (including our dessert, a bread pudding dish which was maybe above average) we ordered met expectations.",0.9976,0.744,0.212,0.044,0.49004597443372955

I would also like to increase my rating to 5 stars. I like everything about this place. The farm house burger is one of the better burgers I have had in some time and the chicken in waffles is just awesome. Metropolitan coffee was also a nice surprise.Can't wait to go back already! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I finally made it over to Fork, and am very glad that I did. First off, Fork has a very solid beer and wine list, which they break up into flights if you are interested (Hoppy beers, session beers, Belgian Beers etc.) As a beer snob I really enjoyed this. The flights are reasonably priced and a great way to try multiple strong beers without going overboard. The food was equally fantastic. They do a ""small plate"" thing, however, we later realized that the ""small plates"" were not that small. We ordered five, and by the end wished we had gone with three so we could have tried desert.  The burrata smear was amazing, the duck poutine is still in my dreams, the smoked salmon flat bread was surprisingly good, I've had better mussels and the veal sliders were solid but a little greasy. Everyone at the restaurant was very nice and accommodating, but service got a little slow when it got busy.

Two people told me they didn't care for it (prior to explaining that they both ordered the grilled cheese - not to hate on anyone, but who goes to a charcurria (sp?) and only orders grilled cheese?!)  At first glance, I was completely overwhelmed by the menu. Drinks alone took me 20 minutes to figure out since there is so much and everything sounds so great. I love the fact that you have the option to create your own flights. Really appreciated the amount of information about each beverage down to a distinct flavor profile description. It's important to note that our server was extremely patient and well educated on the ways of the beers, wines and more. Sadly, my friend wanted to try the sangria; which is advertised as the best in town and they were out. Wow, must be real good then....turns out the owner is in Vegas and won't share his recipe. Interesting little tidbit.  On to the food, almost as overwhelming as the beverages. I must say that I am not one who is prone to make decisions especially when it comes to something as important as what I will order at a restaurant so this truly is a dilemma for me. Luckily I was there with a friend who is the take charge type and he just asked questions and ordered. I happily just said, I'll split anything you want on the menu and that we did. It was a great plan - we tried the pork and duck smear....sounds gross, looked gross, tasted incredible!  Next up, we had the Italian meat flight. Good, but not a very good value in my opinion. Also, I'll add that they give us 3 tiny little pieces of bread and I'm sorry, but these prices weren't what I'd consider nominal so throw in a few more slices of bread at least. This just didn't have any wow factor for me. Round 3, the poutine. YUMMY!!! My body hates me for this, but I could eat this several times a week. It was loaded with succulent duck with a gravy and cheese sauce. It was heavenly and absolutely horrible for me, but I relished every biteful.  I also got to try the farm burger. Unfortunately, the egg was overcooked for my taste but the brioche bun was delectable smothered in a dijon mayo. Was also able to taste a bit of the brisket in root beer sauce. SO GOOD!  I was thoroughly impressed with the entire meal. I certainly wouldn't come here regularly, but it's a fun place to check out every so often. I don't know about the value for what you get but I do think the small plates and smears with a few drinks is fun and there's a movie theater nearby so you can make a whole fun date out of it for sure!

2012-01-26,3.0,"Now I have been in Fork all of once when it was previously Fiddlehead and I can gladly say I will not miss it. I walked in one random Saturday morning when I did not need to catch up on sleep from the week when I saw they had breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised by the menu offerings and juice selection; I am a sucker when it comes to fresh juice and it doesn't matter how expensive it is when it tastes THAT GOOD... The Chicken and Waffles is a thing of beauty and and the single piece of Candied Bacon is a damn tease. The Breakfast Potatoes are a little off-putting, though,  because they are really garlic-y. Normally, I would go for that but not as a breakfast side but that is probably a personal preference. Since then I have been back multiple times during breakfast and even my father has been won over with their Eggs Benedict (a dish which he is almost a Michelin inspector of solely).  I have returned once during dinner; their fare not quite as alluring to me as their breakfast. The Tomato Soup had a very strong acidic taste to it. The Duck Confit Club was well made but the greens, dressing and bread overpowered the confit which I felt was lost within the sandwich. The Crème Brûlée was very nice; tradtional and  garnished with some berries. The restaurant is very popular over the weekend and unless you are coming in by yourself to eat at the bar I would suggest calling ahead. Dinner during the week was quite vacant but it was the middle of the week so your millage may vary.

The host indicated 15-20 minutes.  No problem, I said.  After all I had gotten there early for this exact reason.  The problem is that we weren't seated until nearly 12:30.  That wouldn't have bothered me except there were at least three tables that could have accommodated my party that sat open for at least 15 minutes before we were actually seated.  Frustrating! When we were finally seated I found that the prices on their menu differed slightly from those posted on their website (not by a ton, but that's still irritating) and our waiter was someone who feels that being contrary with a smile on his face constitutes comedy.  After taking our drink orders tersely and then practically throwing the glasses down on the table (my girlfriend's spilled a bit... he really did just toss them down) he disappeared for another ten minutes before taking our food orders.  Admittedly when he returned he was apologetic and did seem to get our food orders expedited to make up for it, but still. I agree with the previous poster who said that the garlic cilantro fries were a disappointment.  I had high hopes, but they were just ho-hum.  The turkey pannini was perfectly tasty, if nothing terribly special.  Though the tomato jam was quite a nice addition to the crisp, buttery bread and thick, melty cheese.  I was a little put-off by the appearance of my friends' tomato soup (the washed-out color of tomatoes in January.  I know it's January and it's tomato soup but if it looks that unappetizing, maybe come up with a seasonal alternative... squash anyone?) but I didn't taste it so I don't know if it was any good.  They seemed to enjoy it (both finished it) but I still didn't think it looked very appetizing - particularly with a pool of what looked like finely chopped basil floating in olive oil on the top. Overall, our lunch was pleasant, but not without frustration.  If the restaurant is new, I'd probably go back for a brunch in the summer to see if things improve, but if it's been there a while, I won't be back.",0.9926,0.794,0.148,0.058,0.4524237614237614

It took us awhile to find out what we hadn't tried before, but it seemed to be pretty local. No shame in that, Chicago has some fab beahs. Like I said, we had some cheese (goat and cheddar varieties) and meat and moved onto some small plates of Mussels (Belgian, oh SO GOOD) and the braised porkbelly.  The atmosphere was dark and romantic in the back room, and energetic in the front with more smaller tables. We actually came back for a night cap another time and got seated right by the fireplace. We had the ganache cake and a wine flight. The cake was SO RICH, it hit the spot. It was exactly what I needed and I was so happy we stopped in. They must have heard my 3rd stomach grumbling to know I'd be pleased with chocolate and wine, a girl's close-to-next best friend after diamonds. Actually, I think I like chocolate more than diamonds, but I digress... This place is great to bring friends and family.

For dinner, I had the brisket sandwich, which was very tasty- I even enjoyed the sauce, which is not always the case. My husband was a little less impressed with his entree.  He ordered the house gnocchi, which in his usual poetry he described as ""tasting pretty much like it sounds on the menu"".  He got the larger portion, which I think still left him hungry, and he spent most of dinner gazing longingly at the grilled cheese and tomato soup one table over...",0.9903,0.799,0.186,0.015,0.49605222734255

When Fork opened up I was pretty meh about going and the menu looked like every other new spot coming to the city.  I read the reviews and they were pretty mixed so it seemed Fork would be fairly mediocre. After my wife and I decided not to drive to Berwyn to try a restaurant out there due to ridiculous Friday night traffic we walked through Lincoln Square just to look for a drink and an app to start out our night.  We happened upon Fork and thought what could be so bad about a drink and a small starter. Well, to my surprise, Fork had 3 Floyd's Zombie Dust on tap!  The only other place I've had this so far is Maria's in Bridgeport.  My wife found a good glass of wine (great selection of beer and wine, I must say) and we were off. After perusing the menu we opted for the warm marinated olives and the chicken liver pate.   The olives were fine but a little too warm. They were tasted but a hot olive just doesn't do it for me.  However, the pate was phenomenal and came in a nice sized glass mason jar. The only downside is you are given 3 small pieces of toasted crostinis but we were able to request more for no charge.  The pate was really smooth and delicious and had a really nice rich flavor. After finishing our pate we decided to stay rather than venture out to somewhere else we had no idea where to go. We split a burger with cheddar and it was really great. We both are burger fans and like to try burgers all over the city. Fork's did not disappoint and was cooked to medium-rare perfection and was really really moist and juicy.  House-made chipotle ketchup was already on the very nice bun and we opted for the garlic-cilantro fries for a buck extra.  A fine choice but beware as the fries are pretty garlicky.  We also appreciated the burger and fries split on two separate plates for us. We find this is a nice bonus when kitchens and servers recognize we are splitting something and do it for us. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were fairly attentive and pleasant. They got bogged down a few times and it took a while for us to get their attention on two occasions but it was fine as orders were picking up.

My friend ordered the PBLT.  The P(ork) B(elly) was sliced thin and was basically just thick bacon.  She asked for her egg to be cooked medium-well.  They either didn't listen or don't know what that means because it came out really runny.  Overall, it was just ok.  She said the mixed greens were really bland and could have used some more dressing.  Our table also ordered the farmhouse burger.  I didn't hear anything good or bad about it. Of note: I uncharacteristically ordered coffee (hangover...) and it arrived in a really dirty mug.  I requested a new cup and he apologized, but I can't believe it ever made it out of the kitchen!  Also, Fork has notoriously slow service.  I knew this ahead of time so it didn't bother me, but just keep that in mind if you're in a hurry.",0.9784,0.806,0.14,0.055,0.5514081289081288

I loved this place as Fiddlehead, but I'll tell you this; Fork is always packed now, so they're doing something right. For staff alone, they get 5 stars. From the hostess, servers, and even the owner, the service is stellar and it's appreciated. The wine list has shrunk, but don't get me wrong - it's still huge in comparison to other restaurants. The main event here is the beer, and if you're into that you'll love it. I have to be in a beer mood and with the wine available here I just never am. They carried over the cheese menu from Fiddlehead so it remains outstanding. They have the best selections here, and as a bonus, they have a special menu for carryout cheeses! Inquire about it - they even beat Whole Paycheck's prices! I'm not the best person to review the food menu as it's porky and meaty, and I'm neither. So, all I can say is I've had their eggplant smear on the goat cheese baguette and it's excellent. The mushroom gnocchi can be hit or miss. I've had it twice, once it was to die for, the next time it just wasn't that great. And the artichoke appetizer while tasty, is a bit of a mess. Definitely not a first date choice.

An anemic cheese flight ($12) should have been more like for the teeny tiny slices of 3 cheeses plus 3 almonds, 2 pecans and 4 thin slices if bread and apple. (I was at the John Hancock 96th floor Signature room the other day, where you pay for the views, and had a cheese plate for $11).   And the worst offender - one of their seranno ham plates - 2 or 3 slices plus a dolop of mustard ($12 ish - my friend ordered it and I am not sure of the exact price.)

2011-07-17,4.0,"Back when it was Fiddlehead, and even in the early stages of being Fork, the service was my chief complaint. Not the food, which was divine, and not the prices (which are a tiny bit elevated but for good reason--the quality). Well, the service gets better and better at Fork. Today I found myself unwilling to head down to Ribfest but seriously jonesing for some BBQ. I placed a phone order to Fork for their brisket (which I know to be delicious) and garlic-cilantro fries. The hostess and bartender were welcoming on the phone, and upon my arrival, offered me a seat at the bar while the back-of-house finished packaging my carryout. The bartender knew exactly what I had ordered and offered me a glass of icewater while I waited. Given the fact that it was about 90 degrees outside, and I had walked from my apartment, I was thrilled. He also commented that the brisket was a great batch; he'd had it for lunch. I asked how long they smoke it and got a different answer than the wait staff has told me, so I guess I'll never know. :) Less than 3 minutes later, my food arrived, and the bartender wished me a nice and cool evening. I added a tip onto my bill, which I don't always do for carryout. Even though it was a good 15 to 20 minutes until I consumed my garlic-cilantro fries, they were wonderful and still crispy. If you have not yet had these fries but have been to Fork, what is WRONG with you? :) All kidding aside, the brisket is as good as I remember it (definitely more tender with tastier BBQ sauce than some of the city's BBQ-only joints), and the texas toast underneath soaks up all the great juices. Topped with fried onion straws, it's a perfect summer dish, albeit a bit of a heavy comfort food. I have yet to bring someone to Fork who has had the garlic-cilantro fries and not declared something to the effect of, ""I never want to eat any other kind of fries again."" DELICIOUS.

As for the atmosphere, it's good.  It can get a bit loud during the prime of brunch, but not so much that you cannot hear your companion.  And even though this seems to be a mecca for the stroller-toting set, my experience was always that the kind of parents that go to Fork are respectful of other diners and you don't encounter some of the same problems you get at other kid-friendly places.  (i.e.kids running around or yelling/crying loudly.)",0.9549,0.833,0.137,0.03,0.6584325396825398

Our waitress was incredibly attentive, was very enthusiastic about the food, and even gave suggestions as to different beers to order based on our initial orders. I really wish I could remember her name. Anyway, we started off with the French charcuterie flight, which is comprised of saucisson sec (salami), pate de champagne and magret fume (smoked duck breast). I was not a huge fan of magret fume, but I would eat the pate everyday if I could. The saucisson sec was also delicious, but the pate was simply amazing. We also shared the spring vegetable ragout, the braised pork belly, and the seared diver scallops. My only real complaint is about the order in which the food came out. The braised pork belly came out at the same time as the charcuterie, which we ate first, so it was no longer hot by the time we ate it. Regardless, it was cooked very well and the cheese grits had a wonderfully smooth texture. The seared scallops came out second and were equally as delicious. They may have been ever so slightly overcooked, but I didn't notice. The vegetable ragout came out last, although I think it should have come out first. It also wasn't the best note on which to end the night. This is not to say that it was not good, but it definitely was not amazing.  Overall, it was a great experience.

Never mind, I thought, just give me the bagel and cream cheese. I then pressed if I could get a side of the eggs. The waitress looked at me perplexed, walked away without warning and returned saying they could. Very well then, that was my order. The other half ordered some scramble with sausage and toast and potatoes.  Two minutes after ordering, my side of over easy eggs arrives. I looked at the server perplexed. I tell him, that's part of my order and questioned if the other food was coming because 1) I didn't want to eat alone and 2) how could I even eat runny eggs with just a fork.... The server ignored me and off he went. Fifteen minutes later, the rest of the food comes and the waitress just casually says ""Sorry 'bout the eggs."" The bagel was old. The cream cheese was lowfat Philadelphia cheese. $2.50 for that? What a rip off. My other half thought his food was terrible. Dry, old eggs with terrible tasting sausage. Dry and old toast without so much as even jam or jelly (on the side, as advertised). Then minutes later, the waitress brings us our bill. What a terrible place.

Sunday was a hot, gorgeous preview of the summer-to-come and I enjoyed two delicious tequila-based cocktails made with agave syrup and grapefruit juice; a perfect choice for breakfast-y food and the highlight of my meal.  I was impressed with the beer and wine lists but disappointed in my entree; I chose the breakfast melt sandwich which includes bacon, ham, cheddar, fontina, arugula and carmelized onions. I ordered without the bacon and ham but was still charged full price; in situations like this I can never understand why there isn't a base price if you order it vegetarian and an add-on price for the meaty version, especially when you have three breakfast sandwich options and none are vegetarian. I might not have minded so much had the sandwich as I ordered it not been a soggy mess; the bread was not thick enough to stand up to the toppings and I had to eat it with a fork and knife. Not to mention the irritating fact that I forgot to specify which bread I wanted, the waitress never asked and it was brought out to me on white, which I never eat if I can possibly help it. My waitress was friendly and seemed to know the menu but she was training another waitress and I think it distracted her on some level; I ordered a side of potatoes, she forgot to bring them out, I said it was fine and to forget about it but still had to ask to have them removed from the bill 20 minutes later. But it was a busy Sunday and the service wouldn't stop me from giving Fork another try.

I wouldn't have thought a chicken burger could be anything special but Fork proved me wrong. The grilled chicken salad with beets, bleu cheese and champagne vinaigrette was also lovely. I appreciate the fact that it was clear the chicken breast was actually cooked at the restaurant. I hate the fake grilled chicken that comes out of a bag so many places use.  The drink menu is expansive -- wine and beer included. Many great options to choose from.  The music in Fork is terrible. But it's laughably terrible rather than detrimental.

2011-05-02,5.0,"Okay, I forgive you.  It's been a few years plus a name change and a facelift (for you), and now I can officially and definitively offer this restaurant my forgiveness for getting rid of the banana-chocolate french toast.  I wish I could say something noble like ""my forgiveness cannot be bought"", but it totally can.  So I'd credit whomever added the banana white chocolate bread pudding to the menu with buying my forgiveness and my love.  Good job dude or dudette - thanks to that addition, I'm back and I'm ALL IN. I'd never had wine flights here before, but my dude and I had both the ""crisp"" and ""interesting"" ones, respectively, and both found things we adored and wanted to purchase (ironically in the flight the other one had, but that's good).  Quick suggestion, Fork - encourage people to keep their little wine flight papers that say what's what.  I was too lightheadedly giddy to grab mine, but I wish I had now. For food, we split the iceberg & blue salad (delicious and a larger portion than we'd have guessed or hoped for), the French charcuterie (awesome, especially the saucisson sec - salami of some sort rolled in herbs de province? Um yeah!),and the mac & cheese small plate (pretty tasty but the only thing that didn't really set off fireworks for me).  For dessert, we split a pricey but delicious flight of madieras, the middle of which went perfectly with the aforementioned love-buying bread pudding.  My guy had the chocolate cake which was gorgeously rich & bittersweet, but I still think I had the winner for desserts, especially with the booze pairing. A little expensive, especially with the 3 flights we ordered, but worth it.  It's difficult for me to think of this place and not be hungry.  The next time I visit won't be so long this time and can't come soon enough.",0.9972,0.76,0.222,0.019,0.5093253968253968

Persian feta--not bad i loved that they didn't skimp on the pairings--we got apples, pickles, candied walnuts, taosted bread and bread w raisins i got the Metropolis coffee--they didn't have soy which i would have liked--the coffee was way too strong. i drink strong coffee at home and i didn't finish my cup here. this was literally the only thing i wasn't 100% pleased with so in the scheme of things not such a big deal.

2011-04-19,4.0,"Fork used to be called Fiddlehead Cafe.  While it was Fiddlehead, I went there about 3-5 times and the quality was consistently good.  The food was always tasty.  The service was always good in that I do not remember a bad experience. Now that it is Fork not much has changed.  The interior is a bit different but is still very nice.  Dark decor, candles, it's romantic.  Or you could bring a group of friends, a fellow girlfriend, your family, etc. The service is still good.  My date and I went there Valentine's weekend.  It was my first time there as Fork and his first time there at all.  Valentine's weekend is potentially a disaster at restaurants, like other holiday weekends.  Our waiter was fantastic.  He did not rush us.  He answered questions, he gave us suggestions that were all very good.  The food was great.  Try any kind of cheese that your server recommends and you should do well.  Same goes for the wines.  He brought us out some extras on the house.  My date had a beer flight; I had the Spicy Reds wine flight.  We were both very happy.  The mood was intimate and romantic.  I suggest that you start with the warm marinated olives.  Try the house gnocchi as an entree or split it with your date.  You won't be sorry you tried it.  The mussels are incredibly yummy and are served one of two ways: Belgian or French.  If you haven't had mussels before or you are not a huge fan of seafood, opt for the mussels to be served French style.  The sauce, the preparation, and the bacon will help to counter the mussels taste and texture.  They're great. We walked out of there satisfied but with room for dessert elsewhere.  Parking was surprisingly easy - we parked in the square about 1-2 blocks south of the restaurant.  It might have been luck though.  We called ahead for reservations at 8pm and it was neither empty nor packed. One thing: if it's not warm outside ask for a table away from the windows.  Or wear your coat like I did.  The wine and company will warm you up.  Wink implied.",0.998,0.74,0.23,0.03,0.602843137254902

These people can call this place ""don't come here"" and heards of people will still come.  Fork is nestled in the B-E-A-utiful Lincoln Square Village. Obviously there was no parking but it was a nice day for a walk because he ended parking far. Me and my friend had drank the night before so we were a bit hungover. We managed to crawl out of bed and get our asses there for this food...so my expectations were set high.  It was brunch time and the place was packed. Its OK, never fret, they have this waiting area with couches and they brought my hungover self some water. I was so comfy talking with my friend over a cup of water on comfy couches. The hostess came over and asked if we needed anything while we waited (how sweet) and that the server was cleaning off our table and would be back to get us shortly. There are two rooms decorated very ""homely"" and modernly. They have a bar you can also sit at but can be very dangerous while at brunch.  We were seated at a table with the perfect amount of sunshine to top off my day. I laid eyes upon the menu and fell in love. I looked around and saw what everyone was getting. Chicken and waffles and eggs Benedict. My friend said he was def getting chicken and waffles so I know I could mooch off of his. I ended up deciding of soft scrambled eggs with truffle oil and shitake mushrooms with a triangle of puff pastry. BEST DECISION EVER!!! As a guilty starter, we ordered the garlic cilantro fries served with a siracha...yes i said siracha.... aioli. AMAZING. I know you might be worried about the breath factor but as they as, 2 garlics cancel out each other. Trust me, WORTH IT. They also serve mimosas, Bellini's, and champagne. (BRUNCH EXTRAVAGANZA). The chicken and waffles can out with some candied bacon on top with a warm fluffy waffle. The candied bacon was a perfect addition to it. The chicken was fried golden and was so juicy. I never knew how much they complimented each other with maple syrup all over them. The truffled soft scrambled eggs with shitakke mushrooms and a puff pastry triangle was simply described best as a life changing experience. The flavors in the truffle eggs with shitakke mushrooms was so developed and subtle at the same time. The eggs were cooked perfectly soft but not runny or disgusting. The puff pastry was an added touch that complimented it perfectly.  Our server was amazing and the whole team looked really laid back and loved what they do. I know there is no dress code but it seemed a bit more than your regular Sunday sweatpants so bust out your good jeans and sport coat. If i could make up my own dress code, I would say, trendy casual. The pricing is pretty reasonable for the Lincoln Square area. I enjoyed my visit there from beginning to end.

The Cheese Plate - for $12 we expected there would be a little more to it than an apple slice cut in slivers, 4 almonds, and 3 pieces of cheese - each half the size of a slice of American cheese and just as thin. Certainly not enough to share - maybe enough for someone just wanting a 'taste'.  Other places are far more generous by comparison.  The things that will likely keep me coming back:  - Menu variety. The Chicken Burger was surprisingly good that I'd definitely order it again.

My gripes: -$5 for a small plate of ""seasonal fruit"" which equaled pineapple, blueberries, and cantelope.  Not exactly what I would deem seasonal and probably just purchased in bulk.  -Multiple pieces of silverware with gunk and crust on them -Lame brioche French toast that I could have done up better -Cold rye toast--I know it's difficult to keep toast hot, but this was so cold that no butter would even melt on it.

I have to say - I thought service was fantastic.  Everyone that we interacted with was super nice and accommodating.  We didn't have to wait for our reservation and the menu 'tweaks' some of us requested were accommodated as well.   The food is good, but nothing special.  I had the farm burger with a fried egg.  It was good and the burger was done as requested, but it was just ok - I wouldn't seek it out as a fantastic burger.  I was inadvertently given the garlic fries.  These were good, but quite greasy.  I ate a few since the taste was delicious, but I couldn't make it through many of them due to the grease factor. Fork does have a great wine and beer list.  I think the flights of wine are set up a bit oddly - but you can find some good and interesting wines on the list and they are all reasonably priced. The atmosphere is nice.  I actually prefer sitting at a table in the bar area, but the regular dining room spot is nice and cozy as well (but people watching in the bar is fun!).  The restaurant is appropriately dark and cozy - so this makes for a good spot for a nice out with friends or a date. Value-wise, this is a great spot.  I think the 5 of us paid something like $30pp for dinner and drinks (I will say we didn't have appetizers or dessert), but this is a pretty good deal.   Overall, it's cute for the area.  I think it's a better spot for drinks or snacks - I wasn't that impressed with the food.",0.9985,0.695,0.287,0.018,0.6042110082899557

Our server was kind and engaging - offering nice wine coaching and great validation on her food 'favorites' as well.  She was in the weeds almost all night, servicing the entire back room.  There was lots of confusion between the server and the expediter about what had been delivered, e.g., 'the mussels will be here soon!' when they had already come and gone.  So, I agree with previous reviewers - they have service problems but I think it's a process problem: everybody who came to us directly was extremely good at what they were doing.

The chef got it right to us and took it off our bill, which we appreciated, but it was an odd thing to have happen at a place so focused on getting things right at the table.

Our server informed us that they were now ""less casual"" but the management, chefs, and service staff are the same. The beer list was awesome.  I believe they have about 75 varieties of craft brews. Enough said. The food was awesome. Olive Oil Roasted Beets - The combination of beet and blue cheese is somewhat expected, but the addition of pistachios was an appreciated new texture and taste. Pork Belly - The pork belly itself was a perfect combination of crunchy and smooth.  It sat atop a bed of white cheddar grits which we scraped from the plate so as not to miss a drop. Mussels - We had our choice of Belgian (brothy) or French (creamy) style.  We went with Belgian and dug in. This, however, is where the wheels fell off the wagon. The dish was supposed to be served with fries. It arrived, however, sans frites. Let's be honest, I don't need a basket of fries. But would I eat them? Sure.  However, just as we were reaching to pull the last mussels from the broth, the fries arrived. Yeah... I don't really want them anymore. They seem like an afterthought at this point. Next - coffee and desserts. We each ordered coffee with a shot (Godiva Dark for him, Godiva White for me) and decided to split the white chocolate banana bread pudding. We wait.  And wait. Our server brings us another coffee each (free - to compensate the wait, we assume). I believe I visited the restroom twice at this point due to the large volumes of coffee consumed. Still waiting.

I ordered the gnocchi with morel mushrooms in a bechamel sauce  with a balsamic reduction drizzled over it. The gnocchi were fat slabs of semi-cooked dough, there were a few on top distinguishable from the clumpy bed of paste-like pastamush beneath them. The balsamic was too sweet and syrupy and the bechamel was slightly cold and gummy.  This was when I realized why the place had been empty that Saturday. I also realized why the place needed to advertise their beer list on a giant banner outside the building. Folks, the impressive beer list is a ruse, a red herring, a distraction, something to keep your mind off the fact that the food is terribly overpriced slop masquerading as gourmet cuisine.

It took a while to get served, but that was probably because I went on a Friday night. My dish was well worth the wait. I've had a lot of chicken at many places, but never as good as Fiddle head's roasted selection. It was fresh, juicy and yes, yummy.  My date ordered her usual Mac and Cheese, with pink salmon. Their cooks must really use some secret ingredients because I their fish taste very good. I might also add they have an excellent selection of wine from around the world.  The Atmosphere  Fiddlehead has a quiet, romantic, laid back front room with open windows during warmer months. If you are able to call ahead, or even request a window seat, then you will really have a wonderful time. They keep the room very dimly lit, which is nice because you can focus on your date.

A look at their fantastic beer menu and one bloody mary later and we were settled in for a nice lunch/brunch.  Fiddlehead has a nice menu with a mix of brunch and lunch options. The usual faire with sweet and savory options, salads and sandwiches. I went with a very nice duck hash and the wife had a solid grilled chicken salad with peaches. We gave them big points for creativity and originality but they just missed the mark on execution. The salad was flavorful but slightly overdressed. The duck hash was solid and really tasty but my toast came out cold as ice and almost tasted stale - and as any hash lover knows the best part of an egg over-easy on top of hash is dipping the toast in the runny yolk.

The decor is nice.  I ordered the French Burger with fries. My husband also ordered a specialty burger with fries.  I really liked that they knew how to cook a medium and a medium well. Both burgers were flavorful. The baguette was fresh, the brie was melted nicely, and the onion marmalade was delicious. My husband's burger has a nice amount of BBQ sauce on it; he liked that it wasn't drenched in sauce, and he could still taste the meat. Both the baguette and his hamburger bun held up well to the weight of the patty. There was a heaping portion of french fries on each of our plates, as well as a side of ketchup.  The food was good, and the bill was reasonable. The only criticism I have is that the food was very salty. Perhaps I am a bit sensitive to salt, as I am cutting back on my sodium intake. There were salt and pepper shakers on the table; if one wanted to add more salt they can, but it is hard to make something less salty.  To keep in the French style of the plate, it would have been nice if they had mayo instead of ketchup as a condiment, but I am being a bit picky. I am sure I could have requested it.  I'm a mac and cheese girl, so I am looking forward to trying it next time. The watermelon gazpacho sounded good, too.

2010-03-16,3.0,"So, I came back for brunch here a few weeks ago, and... well, it was different than I remembered. The menu had completely changed since the previous time I'd been here, which I guess is normal for a restaurant. But it seemed a lot smaller, and nothing really stood out to me. I had been so excited to come back and eat at the restaurant that made me like gravy for the first time in 29 years (see previous review), but it's not even on the menu anymore. Sadness. I eventually went with french toast and it was not great. At all. It was very soggy, and didn't have a lot of flavor. In fact, the only thing I could taste were the flavors from the apples that topped my food. So basically I was eating flavorless soggy bread and... well, that's no fun. I ordered a side of bacon (because I can't brunch without bacon), and it also was not good. It tasted like someone had popped some Oscar Meyer bacon in the microwave. Sigh, really? I can do that myself at home. I just remembered this place being good, and my brunch just wasn't. And maybe it's the new menu, maybe it was an off day... who knows. For what it's worth, my friend really enjoyed her egg dish - I think she got the truffled eggs. Her daughter got the kid's PB&J, which comes toasted, which the menu doesn't note. Luckily her 3 year old was having a non-picky day (you know how kids are), and ate it. The PB&J came with really greasy fries which she also gobbled right up. The mimosas were just as weak as I remembered them, but bonus - and the only reason I gave 3 stars and not 2 - they didn't charge us for any of our mimosas, and we had 4 between the two of us.

2010-02-11,5.0,"Wow, I wrote my first review for Fiddlehead even BEFORE I spent almost an entire summer drinking there at the bar. You think I exaggerate, but let's ponder how else everyone who works there knows my name... Congratulations, Fiddlehead. You just earned your fifth star. I've always adored this place: Amazing wine selection, friendly servers and bartenders, chill soundtrack, great patio. Up the street from my apartment (yeah, I'm biased). Oh, and cheese. Sweet Jesus, the cheese. But the food never really got me. Brunch was too sticky-sweet; dinner was too salty. And everything was too expensive. Though, for that, I blame the neighborhood. And the nearby Old Town School for bringing all those ritzy North Shore people down for guitar lessons.  And then...!!!! Fiddlehead got a new chef. Which I found out about when one of the kitchen staff walked by with a plate full of French fries, a potent punch of roasted garlic floating behind it. Those, friends, were the new garlic cilantro fries.  I got an order for myself and was in seventh heaven -- though my breath went straight to the seventh circle of hell, I'd imagine. The chef came from a French restaurant and has incorporated a lot of those flavors and techniques into Fiddlehead's revamped menu. I haven't tried a lot of it, though, because I still can't really afford to dine at Fiddlehead as much as I'd like. Ah, but wait. Enter the new weekday specials. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, Fiddlehead becomes affordable for broke kids like me. Tuesdays: $8 wine flights. Wednesdays: $5 burgers, $8 specialty burgers and $1 off any draft beer. Thursday: FREE CHEESE NIGHT. Sweet Jesus. Order a cheese plate to eat there; take home the same amount for free to enjoy later. Um. Let me back up and discuss Wednesday. I ordered a burger with cheddar, fried onion straws, bourbon barbecue sauce and an impossibly soft, toasted brioche bun for $8. Is there anything higher than seventh heaven? Because I was there. As a Kansas City girl, I'm mighty picky about my barbecue sauces, and ohgoodlord. So, try that. Plus, Ephemere on tap? (And a buck off on Wednesdays?) The newly pumped-up beer selection at Fiddlehead has put them toe to toe with Hopleaf, as far as I'm concerned, minus the snobbery, bad lighting and thunderous din. Actually, the lighting's still bad, but it's much more pleasant at Fiddlehead.  If you tried Fiddlehead before and weren't too impressed, give them another try.

2010-01-17,3.0,"Maybe it's just that I'm kind of losing patience with the trendy and upscale sort of places that seem to spring up in, well, trendy and upscale neighborhoods like Lincoln Square and Andersonville, but I have to say that Fiddlehead Cafe underwhelmed me at brunch today.  We walked into a restaurant with a lot of open tables, but it took close to half an hour for our party of eight to get seated.  And for the life of me I don't know why since if anyone had actually bothered to clean off the empty tables in the front and push them together we could have been seated in ten minutes or less. Once we did get seated, we couldn't get enough menus for everyone.  Again, in a restaurant where there are a number of empty tables, and many people already have their meals, why on earth was there some kind of menu shortage?  They haven't just opened or started with brunches, it's not like they didn't know they might need a bunch of them.  Ditto the cups for coffee or tea.  It's not like they didn't know that people might want one or the other with their brunch, but while they seemed to have a nearly limitless supply of glasses for mimosas and champagne, people at our table had to wait for cups.  Not long, but there was a lag. Once we ordered, the food came pretty quickly, but there were immediate problems.  One of the folks at the table ordered smoked salmon and asked for it without onions, emphasizing that she was very, very allergic to onions.  And yeah, it arrived with onions.  When she sent it back she asked them to please make sure that they remade the plate because if they just picked the onions off she'd become quite sick.  I think that finally got through because she seemed okay through the rest of the meal.  And to the credit of the server, it really was handled quickly and politely. Another of our number got the wrong kind of sausage, a mistake less potentially disastrous, but bespeaking a sloppiness which might have been marginally acceptable had the place been jammed, but was absolutely not this morning.  And I noticed that the watercress on several of the dishes was wilted, and looked sort of funky.  There's just no excuse for that.  Leave it off if it doesn't look right. I'd ordered chilaquiles, and what I got tasted okay except that I got lumps of scrambled egg, and tortilla chips that were not only still very crisp but had bonded to each other in difficult-to-cut hunks.  And it was cold.  I know eggs don't hold heat for very long, but I don't expect the entire dish to be cold.  It was topped with some scallions, but very little crema and I didn't see any of the queso mentioned on the menu.   Yet another member of our party ordered the banana pancakes and while I didn't ask, I sure didn't see any of the Nutella that was promised.  She was also the only person to order pancakes, and yet we got two plates of butter and syrup.  I don't know if they expected us to put it on the tortilla chips or something. The bottom line is this:  As pleasant as the service was -- and everyone was refreshingly free of the upscale 'tude you get from a lot of servers in these places -- it failed to make up for the fact that there was a lot of sloppiness about the meal.  Lack of basics, wrong orders, missing ingredients, ingredients not the freshest and dishes not really well thought out or executed.  I don't feel I got my money's worth, frankly. Three stars because there was nothing seriously wrong with either the food or the service, and because I'm feeling more generous now than when I left the place.",0.9074,0.799,0.113,0.089,0.5536891078270388

While I can't fully remember my daddy-daughter date with my father at Fiddlehead back in May (something with apple tarts and fancy beers that left me content - a solid four), I will not forget my near perfect catch-up date with a friend this Monday. Ever. Too lovely. A five. Claire had been in France far too long - and we were also quite famished. Muse over the menu or amuse with travel tales? Time was of the essence - so we got down to business and our server (presumably the manager?) played the best sommelier assist I have seen in a long time. Split perfectly down the middle, we opted for the French cheese plate (my favorite - St. Andre, Villefranche de Rouergue - cow's milk), grilled cheese (with bacon and candied pecans on brioche - yum), soup, and bread pudding with dried cherries and pumpkin. Our server (whose name I wish I knew), helped us put together our own trio with a red from their three primary red flights. Taking our coats, checking on us often, pairing with care - he even brought us two glasses of sparkling Moscatel to finish our meal with. The crisp, floral taste countered the warm pudding beautifully.  And this doesn't even make mention of the inviting atmosphere!  Carefully chosen lighting lightly illuminates the warm, organic space perfectly. Great for a cheese plate and glass of wine with a group or an intimate date with a love. Depending on where you sit - the busy bar, a cozy booth, a window-side table (with open windows in the summer!) - you can achieve a variety of feelings seamlessly.  A truly lovely dining experience.

There were some other good things that weren't outstanding.  My wife had a very good chateaubriand.  The cheese selection is nice, esp. the buttermilk bleu.  And the garlic-cilantro fries are a nice side dish.

Secondly, our waitress, fine at her job, nice enough, adorable, gave us space when we (see ""I"") couldn't decide, came back quick enough to take our order when we knew what we wanted...okay, why then only 2 stars? Well, we ordered wine and beer and two cheese flights..one was their Spanish Flight, the other of our own 3 choosings... Their beer selections (and wine too, actually) like many have said already here, were good, expansive.  Their cheese offerings were a pretty good batch of some really great cheeses too (I work in a cheese shop, I do know a thing or two). However, three of the six total cheeses that arrived seemed wrong.  Well, they were the right ones, but they were just so wrong! The Valdeon seem gritty and just some sort of ""stale"" ,  the gruyere surchoix was musty and dry (should be firm, but...) all of the butteriness and any creaminess had left it, and the biggest disappointment (really the horror to me) was that my FAVORITE cheese of all time, (I was soooo excited to find it on their menu) Ewephoria Gouda was so hardened it couldn't be cut with their knives...it was chalky, and although it still had a caramel note, it had lost it's moisture and grassy sweetness. Their cheese selections are wonderful, or at least COULD be, if they just learn when to cut them, know when  its been kept too long, and how to properly care for and wrap them.  Lastly, on the service end, although our waitress was very nice, we had sat outside on a Saturday night.  We sat late, maybe 10:30p...when the other table left, the bussers started removing all of the other tables, and our server asked if we were okay, needed anything else. We made a joke about being kicked out, and she replied ""No, I mean, I could get you another round if you want""...we laughed, said no, and got our check and paid it. No more than 10 minutes later (probably more like 5) a snippy little blond man came out and literally said "" You know, we CLOSE our patio at 11 and its already 11:20...."" and snippily told us we had to leave....okay, Mr. Snippy, I work in the same industry... THERE ARE A THOUSAND OTHER WAYS TO CLEAR CUSTOMERS FROM A PATIO!!!! You had no manners, no grace, and no couth. You were not gracious, and you made us feel unwelcome, after we tipped our waitress pretty decently for her service. Luckily, you came out AFTER we conveniently paid our bill, otherwise, she would have sadly ended up paying (in a poor tip) for your rudeness.

So, I ordered a glass of wine and the summer vegetable pasta entree (I know, I mention the extensive beer list and then order wine. Shut up). The server specifically said there was asparagus in it, which I was happy about and was one of the selling points. I was a little :( to see there was no asparagus in the dish. It was a little bit bland but with a couple dashes of salt it was good.  I was ready to order a second glass off wine but then the server didn't come back for another 22 minutes (I counted)! When he did return I ordered the second glass and after it was delivered he disappeared again. I always always always order dessert, but he didn't even ask, just brought us the bill after he had disappeared for another 20 minutes.

In concept, the idea was lovely: eggs scrambled with truffled goat cheese, shiitakes, and arugula, and served sandwiched between two wedges of puff pastry. However, I am disappointed again and again by restaurants that overcook their eggs. It's such a no-brainer! Any kid can do scrambled eggs right - it just takes a little attention. But these were quite rubbery.  My boyfriend had the Eggs Florentine, which looked a lot better than mine. We were both impressed by the fresh ingredients used at Fiddlehead, and the menu items were well-thought out. They just need to work on their execution a little.

In contrast to other reviews, our water glasses were clean and kept full -- Just sayin'.   My co-diners all got Chilaquiles, which they all enjoyed.  I tried theirs and while I agree it was a nice dish, I am very glad that I departed from the trend and indulged in the Cap'n Crunch French Toast (made with brioche) & house-made chicken sausage instead. I was a little bit skeptical of the chicken sausage since I have found it kind of gamey in my experience. Undeterred by bad memories, and determined to dine out of my comfort zone in this wonderful city, I was delighted to find that in this case, the sausage was well seasoned and tasty -- Moist but not too greasy. It was definitely not pork breakfast sausage, or even a self-deceptively 'healthy' alternative, but good in its own right.  I accompanied my meal with a fresh Carrot/Orange juice from the raw bar.  Overall, the meal was excellent.

She was very kind and did a great job describing the specials.  I had a hard time finding something I wanted to eat on the menu. However, one of the specials sounded just amazing. It was a tempura fried prawn on a bed of zucchini and squash served with gnocchi with marinara sauce. My co-diner and I both thought that sounded awesome and decided to split it along with the vegetable strudel. The kitchen was kind enough to split the dishes for us! Each dish was brought out on separate plates which made me feel like I had 2 dinners. The prawn was just as expected -- wonderful! It was definitely one of those times that I was very happy I made the decision that I did. The vegetable strudel was good too but too much after I finished my first plate. We also ordered the chocolate trio. It was not what I expected but it hit the spot.

I would say that the worst part of the entire experience was the owner.  At our request, he came to our table towards the end of our meal.  He was so incredibly rude.  He continuously told us that he had tables that had had great food and service.  I ask you, what good does that do me?  I had neither.   By this point it was close to 1:00 am.  Our plans for New Years had been ruined.  He finally conceded to comp part of our bill after a long and drawn out argument.  His overall treatment of us and his inability to fully acknowledge the extent of his shortcomings was enough to ensure that I will NEVER patronize his establishment again.",0.8238,0.828,0.097,0.076,0.4758881922675026
2009-01-03,3.0,"This place is a tough one for me to review.  I so want to like Fiddlehead Cafe.  It's in one of my favorite parts of town (Lincoln Square), and there's tons of fun stuff to do all around it.   Like the Davis Theater for a cheap first run movie.   Or Old Town School of Folk Music for a cool concert or nifty-shifty music lesson. Or Fine Wine Brokers for a really great bottle of wine from friendly and helpful staff.   Or Quake for childhood toy nostalgia. Or Laurie's Planet of Sound for awesome music and videos. Or Merz Apothecary for a little bit of pampering. I've been to Fiddlehead a couple of times now and the reason I really want to like it is that the service is really good, everyone is friendly, and the food is pretty tasty.   The servers here are all really friendly.  I've never really ""wanted"" for anything (It's like they have spies in my coffee cup.  It gets empty, yet before I go to drink more they refill it.  Happiness!  I don't have to constantly readjust the cream and sugar from an overzealous coffee dilution incident!) The first few times I got the Spicy Bloody Maria (w/ Tequila instead of Vodka) and the Chilequiles.  You can have chorizo added to the Chilequiles (yes, please!) and it's fairly tasty chorizo, but each time I've ordered it, the bed of nachos is soggy and the scrambled eggs have been a bit rubbery.   I understand that you want the food to arrive together, but perhaps they could deliver the chiliquiles to the table in two dishes (the nachos in a bowl and the eggs, sour cream, and salsa on a separate plate).  It also would allow the servers to slide the eggs/etc. off onto the nachos with a bit of panache while preserving the desirable crispiness of the chips... I recently got the Eggs Florentine Benedict.  And my experience was a bit better.  The English muffins were nicely toasted and the eggs were poached to perfection.  I would've liked a bit more hollandaise sauce ( I had more egg yolk than sauce) and I honestly felt that it was poorly flavored as well.  Fewer things in this world are as sad as weak sauce.  I've heard great things about the burger's but I've yet to try one.  Maybe next time... And I guess that's why I'm giving Fiddlehead only three stars.  It's close, so close (in my opinion) to being a solid recommedation that it's minor things that stick out and keep it from being four stars.",0.9948,0.805,0.167,0.028,0.5263257575757576

Not familiar with that term? Depending on the establishment, ""intermission"" can either be the menu that bridges the time between breakfast and lunch, lunch and dinner, or in our case, brunch and dinner (this was a Saturday.) Usually there are four or five main courses, a few apps and a soup to choose from. It almost always includes a burger, salad, sandwich, etc. Oh and most important--this meal usually occurs between the dreaded shift change when either your waiter is dying to go home or too consumed with sidework to pay attention to you (Not so at Fiddlehead, yay!) So I had some friends in town and we were starved. Trouble was, we spent the early part of the day shopping for boots (Oops, out-of-towners got hit by the snow) and had missed lunch. Not in the mood for the college football crowds (love the game, hate the noise) we really wanted a place to chill, drink some wine or beer, rest our weary tourist legs, etc. We also weren't sure if there would be 3 or 6 of us...anyway, the point of all these details is that the staff accommodated all of our high maintenance needs. They were even friendly about it! Also, the cheese flights are included on the intermission menu! And they have Persian feta! And my friends were delighted! Thank you, Fiddlehead...minus .5 stars though because we didn't get our aioli with our bbq sandwich but it tasted good anyway...

We were looking over the menu and noticed that there was a direct blast of cold air hitting us from overhead.......we asked about adjusting it and were told they were not allowed to adjust it.......(note to self, when meal comes, be sure and eat quickly so your hot food doesn't get cold) Ordered two coffees and two Bloody Mary's, they were fine......coffee was actually excellent. Ordered our meals and when they arrived. I ordered Eggs Benedict, received some fish and egg dish......I saw the paltry amount of potatoes on the plate and asked for an additional side of them......they took away the erroneous order and a minute later brought me my correct order which had even a smaller amount of potatoes.....about enough for 4 fork fulls.........btw, never saw the additional order of potatoes. When the original order was brought to the table, one of our group had ordered a burger and fries.......but there was no catsup or mustard, so we asked for those to be brought to us along with some Tabasco. Several visits to nearby tables by our waitress and still no condiments. The other guys asked the waitress again and she stammered that she would return with it again........it never happened.......I finally tired of two of our group waiting so they could eat so I tried to get the attention of two ladies at the Hostess Station........they reacted like they didn't know how to respond with something like, ""Is there something I can do for you?"".........So I get up walk over and now they are joined by what I assumed was the manager or owner........I sternly, but politely informed him about the fact that we had been waiting for condiments so we could eat and were tiring of the inability of the waitstaff to get their act together.......(trust me, it was not busy in this place) Condiments finally come, oh but geez somehow they forgot the Tabasco.......well at least one person could begin to eat.........that is as the cold air is blasting on the table top and naturally I knew it was going to be a problem if any of the meals got messed up........so finally the Tabasco gets here.........and now for me to start eating.......how do you mess up Eggs Benedict........well they succeeded to do so......no flavor.......Hollandaise was poor.......no tartness at all.......isn't there supposed to be lemon in the flavor somewhere?..........The ham had no flavor as well.........sad, very sad. The waitress finally comes back to the table after hanging with the hostess staff behind the bar, not even at the Hostess Station and cleared the plates I had stacked since they sat so long, empty in front of us. Then returned with our check and just dropped it on the end of our table with not a word to us. No attempt was ever made to apologize for the lack of service or errors made. The other three felt equally unimpressed. And the worst part of the meal was paying the bill totalling $77.00 for a bad experience, sad food and a poor excuse for service.......

First thing to change was the salad with the duck confit in phyllo, they had a potato and fennel soup... sorry I love potato soup and the fennel made it an easy call... they served it table side... I love that and it was really good too. VV had the mussels with chorizo and Israeli cous cous, the mussels were excellently prepared. Then I had the salmon with the potato bacon gratin, darn tasty. The salmon was tender and flavorful and the potato... well it had bacon, hard to get better than that! Vamsi had the red snapper special with lentils, I thought it was really good too, but I was too busy cleaning my plate. Then we had dessert. He went with the chocolate fudge ganache cake, chocolate heaven. I went a little healthy with the sticky toffee pudding with the Guinness ice cream, Guinness has vitamins and minerals.... at least in my head it does.  I definitely want to come back and try some more wine flights and have some of their lovely cheese plates. The nice thing is a bunch of their wines and cheese you can buy at the cafe! Very nice, clean, casual atmosphere, (though if you go early you will probably be dining with kids, just an FYI), but a nice little treat that I will be enjoying again, hopefully sooner than later.",0.9966,0.765,0.228,0.007,0.5768278018278019

Also, I found the bread they served with the cheese plate overpowered most cheeses due to the inclusion of what I think was caraway or fennel seed.    Both the smoked salmon and duck confit were alright but certainly not worth the price paid for them and again tiny portions not befitting the cost.  I get what kinda of restaurant the Fiddlehead is shooting to be, but I just don't think they are quite capable of delivering on expectations.   With so many quality restaurants in Chicago to choose from, I don't expect that I will make a repeat visit.",0.8545,0.879,0.085,0.036,0.33611111111111114

There was no wait, and this being the the first nice weekend, we opted to sit outside.  As soon as I sat down I realized that my chair was partially off the sidewalk.  It was too late, my chair tipped back, a leg snapped off, and I was crushed under the plastic carnage.  It was terribly embarrassing and not my favorite start to a meal.  Shortly after I had been given a new chair, the waitress came over to give us our water.  She had put ice and cold water in glasses straight from the dishwasher.  By the time the glasses reached our table, they were cracked around the entire circumference.  We weren't off to a great start. I was torn between the chilaquiles (a favorite of mine) and the truffled eggs.  I took my server's recommendation and had the truffled eggs.  B ordered the eggs with cheddar and ham.  Now, I'm all for full-disclosure so I will say that I LOVE salt.  I can't live without it.  And, I probably over-salt...just a little.  When dining in restaurants, though, I really try to enjoy dishes as they have been prepared.   But take my word when I say that there wasn't a grain of salt in my entree.  It hadn't been seasoned at all.   I tried to eat it, but finally gave up and asked the server to please bring salt and pepper.  The mini salt shaker did it's job and I was back in business, but I was still wishing I had gotten the chilaquiles.  The cheddar, ham, and eggs were decent.  Nice, sharp cheddar.

The brunch menu is pretty limited, but has some variations on solid brunch items. Some griddle, some eggs, some sandwiches... The gf got the Mediterranean egg plate, I got the, oh yes, Cap'n Crunch French Toast. And that is with peanut butter, in case you were wondering. Hers was a nice egg dish, basically over easy eggs over some chunky tomato sauce, but it's got some cucumbers. Tasty. Hash browns appear to be deep fried; how can that be a bad thing? (She did ask for crispy, too, and I wouldn't have wanted them less done than they were.) Mine was pretty much as amazing as you would think Cap'n Crunch French toast could be. With peanut butter. Nice cereal crunch, but not like overwhelming, gimmicky crunch. Topped with some (slightly not-so-fresh) Crunchberries.  Service was decently polite attentive, if not a little slipshod. Coffee was quick and refelled pretty often. Tasty, too.  As we waited for food though, I was presented with a side of bacon. No, that's not mine. And we did have to wait for and flag down the waiter for her accompanying toast.  A little part of me feels it was a bit pricier than it could have been, but I'd definitely go back again.",0.9866,0.771,0.168,0.06,0.5696770662287903

We got there around 9:30 and had a great seat by the big windows in the front.  It got fairly crowded by the time we left, seemed like the local crowd was rolling in.

The staff is wonderful, helpful and attentive. But the glory of this place is its menu. Fiddlehead is both a wine bar and a first class bistro. It has an excellent wine list the rival of any place in Chicago. They offer about three dozen wines by the glass, far more than other restaurants, plus they have a wonderful selection of ports and madeiras by the glass. The menu does an excellent job of describing the wines and suggesting pairings. The sommelier is also very helpful. Fiddlehead is an excellent restaurant to learn about wines whether you are a complete beginner or more knowledgeable.  Another great part of the menu is the cheese selection.  There are about two dozen cheeses that you can mix and match. Like with the wines, the menu describes them well. Choosing a ""flight"" of three to five cheeses and a ""flight"" of three glasses of wine is a ton of fun. Of course, Fiddlehead has entrees also. A little surprisingly, the variety of entrees and appetizers are not as vast as the variety of wines and cheeses.  Still, the entrees and appetizers are excellent quality. Everything we had was excellent, meats, greens, and breads. We plan on making the Fiddlehead Cafe a part of our regular visits to Old Town School concerts.",0.9957,0.785,0.215,0.0,0.6714102564102563

The last, ""Wow"" came out more like ""Wmphw!"" as I began to chew the potatoes and instantly withdrew my left hand which was in the process of a programmed grab for the ketchup bottle.  These taters where a balance of creamy, crunchy and sweet and would be going down naked.

2007-04-25,5.0,"Wow -- mixed reviews from the Yelp crowd...and some love brunch, some hate it, some loved their dinner, some hated it... Count us in the 'love' column. We've gone twice, and both times were a big success. Our first time was last last year -- perhaps weeks after opening, according to the owners who were there, and we got the VIP treatment. a.) it was a slow SNOWY night, b.) I had just returned from a long business trip, so was excited to have a good date night with dear Jacky and was definitely in a good-to-be-home mood. We started off with some flights, and given that we are big BIN36 fans, we chatted up the owners about their hopes and dreams for this place, and got some good insight on how excited they were to be in Lincoln Square, etc. The wine was predictably good, enough so that we jotted a couple down from each of our flights to buy from a store later (which we did). We did a couple small apps -- the chips with the blue cheese aioli was my fave, and Jacky loved the olives, and both of us loved the seared tuna (that was really good -- a tomato-pancetta jam gave it a little salty/rich bite, as did the olive tapenade and grapefruit). For dinner -- I was definitely smitten by their 'signature dish,' a slow roasted pork shank with lentils and pears that was just amazing. Really really good -- last weekend, our second visit -- I stuck with the pork thing (coincidentally) because it was the special, but it was better than the shank -- a stuffed shoulder equally braised with a mixed greens/arugula salad with fiddlehead ferns and cannellini bean puree. Absolutely phenomenal. Now Jacky -- she is a chicken and fish kind of girl, and not very adventurous -- this IS an adventurous menu by those standards. While this all thematically falls into what I dub 'forest comfort food' - there are a lot of unique choices that I find to be intriguing. Jacky had a fish dish the first visit that she really enjoyed, and this time, she tried the pasta special which I thought rocked (my bite), but she deemed too spicy (a clam pasta with garlic and other goodies). The server was very competent and attentive, and she subbed in the chicken breast and truffled sunchokes which Jacky was in love with. So dinner was saved. The desserts were very fun; this time we had the trio of cheesecakes (peanut butter, dark chocolate and banana), and a couple cups of coffee.  All in all -- a great dining experience -- I'm curious about brunch, esp. after reading your reviews, so will check it out. But for dinner -- I think the bottom line is this place is worth trying to get your own hit/miss opinion.

And now, on to the food.  Mixed reviews.  For some of the items I thought the were suffering from a case of, ""trying-too-hard-itis.""  One of my dining companions had a sandwich with (dry!) duck confit, and goat cheese, and duck liver, and some type of jam, and cinnamon-sugar, and i was kidding about the last one but you get the idea.  The soup of the day, which was an onion bisque type thing was delicious, and my husband enjoyed the lamb risotto, but was miffed that it came as sortof a porridge in a bowl with no veggies on the side.   which brings me to:  I was a bit annoyed when I wanted to change out the polenta on my trout entree for some veggies instead and was told that they can only remove items, not substitute them.  So, not too friendly on the accommodating people with food needs.  Flexibility is always a nice quality in a restaurant, and was lacking at Fiddlehead.  Veggies are cheaper than polenta too last time I checked!  Okay, now onto the odd.  odd. odd. odd.  (1) made us wait 20 minutes when we had a reservation and there were obviously tables open.  (2) two (2) people came up to say ""hi"" to us after we had been seated.  They weren't there to bring us water, or tell us the specials, just to say hi.  Which was nice, I guess, but...odd.  (3) As we were finishing our meal two (2) men were carrying three (3) umbrellas from the outside dining area through the main dining room into a storage closet.  They knocked down at least one (1) glass and made much noise and commotion.  It sorta killed the post dinner buzz, and made me believe that the place was not run by professionals (sorry).  The place not being packed to the gills like every other lincoln square eatery should have been a clue.   In honest, I probably won't be back...unless its just for some onion soup and a wine flight (or two.)",0.9395,0.831,0.106,0.064,0.5068499622071049

2007-04-15,2.0,"I'm  not really sure what happened here. Last fall, right after it changed from Square kitchen to Fiddlehead Cafe, a friend and I went here and had a really great breakfast. We shared an omelet and the chocolate french toast, which was one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. OMG it was so incredibly good. It's been months and I can still remember the chocolate bread, nutella, cherries and even more chocolate-y goodness. I had an omelet, which was well done which was served with really tasty homefry potatoes, which were well seasoned and plentiful....it was a very nice experience. So, today, we had a friend visiting and we wanted to show her a good place to have breakfast before she had to fly off, so we decided to revisit our old delicious breakfasts place. The wait really wasn't bad for our table, it's really to be expected on a Sunday morning, however, it did take kind of a while for us to get our food after we ordered. I was really disappointed with our food in comparison to our last visit. I don't know if it was because I had too high of expectations, but the food really wasn't anything special. I ordered the black truffle omelet and it wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't anything special. I could barely taste the truffle...and I don't think that I enjoy ricotta cheese in an omelet. Also, the plate just didn't seem very generous in comparison to the last visit. The fiddlehead potatoes were almost laughable. The are kind of like tater-tots and reminded me of the hashbrown potatoes served at McDonalds, but worse. Mine were overcooked and didn't have much flavor. Also, I was pretty sure that the toast I had last time was way better than this visit. The bread for my toast reminded me of the stuff you can get for $.69 a loaf at Jewel, really nothing special. One of my friends got the Captain Cruch french toast and it was okay, but not really anything special. I always put peanut butter on my french toast and pancakes anyway, so it really wasn't that much of an addition to put some cereal on top of that. So, all in all, except for the black truffles, (which I couldn't even taste) I probably could have gotten a better breakfast at the Golden nugget. However, the food doesn't seem to be that expensive, but the brunch drinks will really bite you in the butt. I probably won't be going back here any time soon since there are so many better places to eat breakfast in the area.
