While one can get normal rolls and nigiri, they informed me that their special nigiri is really where it is at. I am normally not a soup person, but they directed me to a sweet potato soup that was delicious. Service was impeccable. Water kept getting filed. What we fantastic is that they could sense we were full yet had not served one dish. They asked if we still wanted it or if they should cancel it. We cancelled it. Never have I had service that attentive that I cancelled a last dish. We have historically been partial to Kai Zan for our go to sushi meal, but I think we may start straying. Sorrry Kai Zan, Macku is great! FYI - Thursday nights are when the $75 omakase is reduced to $50.",0.9741,0.799,0.16,0.041,0.5792063492063492
2017-07-25,5.0,"HOW THE HELL DOES THIS PLACE HAVE 4 STARS?! The answer is: People don't know about their omakase. CHICAGO, LISTEN TO ME CARFEULLY: If you're looking for basic sushi, this place is just fine. Fresh as hell fish, delicious rolls, etc. But if you are looking to have your culinary minds blown to pieces, ORDER THE FREAKING OMAKASE. Here's the deal. They have 2 omakase options: 1) ""The Jake Special"". Ok I call it the Jake Special because Jake Arietta frequents NIco Osteria and every time he goes, they bring out off the menu things to him one after another until he cuts them off. I love the mystery and excitement and trust in chef behind this approach. They call it like ""unlimited"" or something like that, but that's one option. Obviously it's not going to be cheap, but holy shit you're going to eat like royalty. The second option: 2) ""Name your budget"" - this is the approach we took. We set our budget at $75 per person, which they said is generally the low end of what you want to spend for something like this, BUT, this TOTALLY filled us up, i think we got around ...9 courses maybe? It was insane! We ate SO much and it was absolutely EPIC. And everything was off the menu, and so perfectly coursed and paired and unique and artistic. Grant Achatz would enjoy it, like that's the level of epic this omakase was, i'm freaking serious. So GO TO MACKU. ORDER THE OMAKASE (pro tip: it's $50 pp instead of $75 on Thursdays) and ENJOY. Chef will talk your ear off at the sushi bar and you'll learn everything you've ever wanted to know about japanese cuisine, whiskey, sake, EVERYTHING. This dining experience is one of the best we've ever had in Chicago. ENJOY!!!",0.9908,0.754,0.178,0.068,0.5411507936507935

My boyfriend and I discovered the Macku omakase deal and looked forward to our reservation at this nearby sushi bar! We were seated in a cozy corner of the small restaurant. The service here is friendly, patient and expedient at bringing our plates in a timely manner.   I believe we had around 10 dishes starting from a oyster trio and ending with an udon. The oysters were a delight and the highlight of the meal for me. Accompanied with a theatrical dry ice display were three zestful bites of oyster, each highlighted with different toppings. Another favorite was the white asparagus soup with kimchi, crab and a beet-truffle sauce.  The soft-shell crab curry dish was promising, but the sauce was way too salty. The hand roll was really lackluster in flavor. I felt kind of robbed that one of the dishes was a classic udon. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but felt very standard and a cop-out for an omakase dish. But my biggest complaint was the nigiri. I did enjoy how with each fish, they'd bring a duo - one traditional and one with a more modern topping, but all three of our nigiris came out slimy! It made me wonder if the fish had gone bad or was the last of an older batch. I could not get over this and let me with a bad taste. Do yourself a favor and get a reservation at Kai Zan. This place wins in all aspects (ambiance, service, quality, creativity, taste, plating, price)!

First off, I would consider Macku kind of like a hidden fine dining sushi fusion experience. A very specific way to describe a restaurant in one sentence but these are exactly my thoughts after my meal here. And what better way to start off a fine dining sushi fusion experience with a glass of chardonnay? Well that's what I did, and then we started the night... Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu, as well as everything the Chefs had up their sleeve for specials for the night. He guided us through what to order, and based off our tastes and his recommendations we chose the following: Maguro (tuna steak): tasty, terriyaki/mushroom flavor. A solid appetizer for two. Nama Sake signature nigiri: delicious, the fresh salmon was rich and buttery to the palate  Shiro Maguro signature nigiri: this tuna and wasabi combo was pretty tasty, though we liked the salmon better White Tuna Ceviche signature sashimi: fresh, light, appetizing Rainbow roll: not a huge fan of the non-sushi rice, but a well done classic roll nonetheless Uni: the uni here was interesting, as it came out kind of like a taco that we wrapped ourselves to eat. I'm not too familiar with uni, but this one was pretty good. Lots of different buttery and rich flavors packed in a square of seaweed. This was definitely a solid amount of food to leave us full and satisfied. It was a beautifully presented meal, each coming out one by one. I would have liked to try the Omakase on their amazing Thursday night deal. The decor and ambiance of Macku was simple and elegant, yet could also pass as casual.

2017-06-01,4.0,"Have been here twice and had mixed experiences. The first time me and my boyfriend came just us two and got the omakase. We had amazing service and most dishes were fantastic. It was 75 a person, higher compared to other omakase dinners we have had but there was a ton of diversity in the dishes and they were all really well crafted. You can tell them what you don't like and they will cater everything else around that. Snails kind of grossed us out but we didn't tell her not to bring them so that was our fault. Also weren't the biggest fans of the ramen as the final dish - the ramen itself is good but we would have preferred more sushi or fish. Anyways, we overall had an amazing meal and were raving about it to all of our friends after we ate there.  My parents came into town to visit so we decided to bring them here, but opted out of the omakase because we didn't want to spend that much for 5 of us.  Bad idea. I definitely do not recommend this place if you are just looking for sushi- I only recommend it if you are planning on doing the omakase dinner.  The menu was pretty confusing, the portions were EXTREMELY small yet very expensive (it was like we were at a French restaurant) and we sadly ended up having to get pizza afterwards because we were still hungry and didn't feel like spending a ridiculous amount on tiny portions.  They also were out of their nigiri tuna (what sushi restaurant runs out of nigiri?) so we had no other option than to get the bluefin, which was 8 dollars for ONE PIECE.  So silly.  We were mega disappointed in our second visit, but I hate to give this place lower than 4 stars because we had such a great experience our first time and the fish was so good. Do not come here if you don't plan on doing omakase, or if you don't want to spend 100+ dollars to leave here full.",-0.7944,0.77,0.1,0.13,0.5852314814814815

Luckily, all of this is backed up by great food.  The sashimi was excellent, as were the apps we tried plus the plain makimono and the signature items.  The service was spectacular and we had a couple of good recommendations from our server.  One could tell that the regulars at Macku are all the way in; it seems like being a regular here has fringe benefits that are worth it.

Service: we came on a Thursday at 5:30, so our waiter was extremely attentive and spot on in his presentation and explanation of each dish.   Food: we started with caviar (the orange big kind, sorry, call me ignorant) served two ways - one the traditional way and one with lychee flavored pop rocks.  What a cool experience!  Next came the asparagus soup poured over a dumpling with a small piece of foie gras.  HEAVEN.  Then rare scallops with some sort of thick butter sauce - like butter on butter - amazing!  Then came the series of paired nigiri plates (5 in total if I remember correctly) - each prepared delicately, presented beautifully, and deliciously fresh.  We began reaching our stopping point right when the waiter told us our last course was arriving. Overall: superb dining experience for way more food than what you'd get at the same price at a trendy restaurant with a pre-fixe menu.  I highly recommend it...but be prepared to incur at least a $200+ bill for 2 people if you want to try omakase and drink.",0.9919,0.778,0.21,0.012,0.5988350340136055

We also ordered a couple of the more ""basic"" rolls (spicy tuna eel, caterpillar) and those were executed perfectly. None of that spicy mayo needed here to disguise poorly made sushi.

Mouthwatering!  The final course, fried chicken atop a drained bed of rice, left much to be desired.  The dryness of of the chicken paired with the mundane sauce made for a dull conclusion to an overall good meal.

Here's the deal: if you want exquisite, creative sushi, sashimi and cooked entrees with some genuine original flair, then Macku is for you. If you want inexpensive, mainstream Japanese fare with noise and glitz and an emphasis on rolls and cheap drinks, then Macku is not for you.  I've eaten at a few of the best sushi joints from New York to San Diego, Miami to Seattle -- and Chicago's finest, like Katsu. And Macku ranks with the best. The food is bold and completely original. The embellishments on what might sound like ordinary dishes is amazing.  Best bet: go with the omikase and sit at the bar with chef Macku. Go with his suggestions and try not to worry about the bill (maybe give him a $ limit when you sit down).

Uni Uzura: this is uni with raw quail egg.  not on the menu but you should ask for it.  uni and the egg pop in your mouth and blend in well together.  altho, if you like uni and egg yolk A LOT, then maybe the combo is not for you.....it's good but cancel out some of each other's best flavors. i'm one of these people but i liked this one a lot too. ""fresh"" uni:  the uni comes ""out of the shell.""  i thought this meant that the tentacles would be moving but is was cut in half, ice was inside the shell and uni is cut into 4 pieces and put on top of them ice.  this last tidbit is important.  more on this later.  white Asparagus soup: 2nd best dish we had here.  comes out on flat plate and i think many others have commented on it but it's creamy deliciousness.  Duck: great presentation.  like i said, dish looked much more expensive due to how they arrange your food but only 15 bucks.  but it's duck so it's good.  catch was that the sauce it came in was a bit too buttery/caramelly.....don't know how else to put it or i don't know what the culinary description for this attack on palette is but it wasn't for me.  i think too ""western?""  instead of eastern asian.  you might enjoy.   cod: same as duck.  great presentation but similar palette issues as duck.  not sure if all entrees are like these but both these were. botan ebi: had 2 of this.  one after the other cause so good.  you can't go wrong with the bruleed motoyaki and it was excellent.  also, fried head is good.  ties with asparagus soup for 2nd place. handroll: can't remember which handroll wife had but it was good. either the unigi or shrimp tempura.  she got done gone pregnant (yes!!) and she is staying away from raw sushi despite how much she loves them.  so it was one of the cooked ones.  very good.  flan: ladies and gentlemen, in first place, flan!!  this thing was god's gift to eaters.  we all eat so that means all of us.  wow.  so very, greatly excellent.  there is a pic of this in the gallery by someone else.  you need to try this one. overall, great place.  there was a bit of a blunder but despite it, it was still deserving of 5 stars.   oh, the reason uni coming fresh out of the shell here might be a problem is that you need to order 4 if you're going to order uni.  that's why i couldn't have another uni uzura because i didn't want the whole thing and wife couldn't have any.   we'll definitely go back and order the omakase.  neighboring table seemed to have it and dishes looked great.",0.9983,0.765,0.178,0.058,0.48251986804618385

Space was what I expected, cute and intimate. We were greeted warmly and service throughout was perfect. Our server was very helpful and everyone was just very friendly.  We got the tuna tartar to start, although our maki rolls came out first, but no big deal, as no item took too long to come out in general. I thought the tartar was pretty good and had a spicy kick to it. Think it could have used a bit more brightness though. The accompanied shrimp and cream cheese rolls were pretty good as well. The shrimp tempura roll was also quite good, but not outstanding. The only somewhat disappointing item was the spicy spider roll. As another Yelper noted, they used imitation crab stick. While I did see that they also used soft shell crab, this was completely masked by its lesser counterpart. For a place with such creativity and finesse, using imitation crab was quite a letdown. Anyways, I got the live uni as mentioned was a special for the night. Many places don't even have uni, let alone a live one, so if you're into that type of thing, it is a must try for sure. It was delish for me and I could definitely taste the difference between fresh and not fresh uni. A server was describing the sea urchin to my boo, as he's never had it before, comparing it to oysters, which is a good comparison. Since the boo isn't a big fan of oysters, he thus didn't care for the uni. More for me! We also got the Japanese flatbread and a beef tenderloin entrée. Both of these were fantastic. The beef was a little smaller in portion than expected, but the flavor was amazing. The balsamic reduction was super yummy and balanced. The sweet potato strips were also a nice touch. The flatbread was also very good and all components worked very well together. Almost never order dessert but thanks to fellow Yelpers, definitely is a must at Macku! I'm a sucker for anything green tea, so we got the green tea mousse and the popular asparagus pudding. For not being a cake type of dessert, both of these were beyond satisfying! The green tea mousse was delish and full of matcha flavor. Having it paired individually with mini marshallows, chocolate, biscuit sticks, and raspberries made it very fun and functional. Aside from the asparagus pudding from being beautiful in presentation, it was delicious. Not even sure how to describe the flavors, but it was amazing. We had a Gilt City voucher so that helped but still a little pricier than your average Japanese spot, but as indicated, it is more than your average spot, and is definitely a standout and what I've been looking for.

2015-03-10,2.0,"Wow, this was really disappointing.  I came here years ago and really had a good meal.  And with Macku Signature being 2 blocks from my house, I have been there a few times and it has been great each and every time.  So, I figured going back here would be a can't miss.  I was wrong.  Dead wrong.  Now there were certain aspects that were very good, but as an overall experience, it failed.  The space itself looks run-down.  The shelves that hold the glassware are dusty.  The windows are dirty.  Paint is peeling.  The bathroom was unkempt.  The heating duct vents were grimy.  Not appealing.   The service was good. The cocktails were average.   Not one of the better Old Fashioneds I've ever had, and my girlfriend's drink lacked punch. The food started off very good, stayed there for a couple courses, then went steadily downhill.  The udon was flavorful but far too salty.  The seared tuna appetizer was quality, but the sauce was heavy and masked the fish instead of enhancing it.  The signature hamachi was perhaps the best item we had all night, but it fell short of the execution of the same dish at Signature.  The flying fish special was good for what it was, you could tell the fish was high quality, and the presentation was excellent, but be warned that flying fish has a VERY fishy finish.  The most disappointing items were the sushi rolls, both hand rolls and regular.  Bland, the fish was not high quality, and ridiculously they used CRAB STICK.  Our meal cost $170, and we friggin' got friggin' crab stick in our friggin' roll.  That is lame.  I would expect that from one of the all-you-can-eat places, but not Macku.  That is some major weak sauce right there.   There really ain't no way in hell I am ever going back to this Macku.",0.8303,0.738,0.146,0.116,0.5239739519739519
2015-03-07,5.0,"I don't normally review, but I had such a pleasant time last night I thought I would share.  Our server was extremely attentive. We wanted to share a bottle of white and were thinking of an interesting white which was served by the glass and he offered us each a taste to decide if we wanted to purchase the bottle. Our next course was out shortly after we finished our last, without overlapping plates on the table or too long of a wait in between. Still, we never felt rushed and felt that the meal progressed at a comfortable pace. My boyfriend is still getting into sushi, so we did two fish dishes and two meat. We started with the bison appetizer. The tenderloin was cooked excellently, very tender and the berry reduction was divine. Not a huge portion, but wasn't expecting that thanks to the photos the other yelpers have provided. Next was the White Tuna Ceviche. It was a deconstructed ceviche and amazing. I loved the salsa that came with it and the presentation was wonderful. There were 6 pieces of tuna total. We then had the venison which I had not seen reviewed prior. The cut was large, cooked perfect, very tender and flavorful. I loved the japanese curry and the mashed potatoes on a bed of spinach gave it some heartiness. Finally was the Hamachi Ebi Tempura. I liked this the least but the bf loved it. I think he felt good cause he was eating sushi I picked for him! :)  The cilantro gave nice flavor but I was hoping for a little more kick with the jalepenos in it.  For dessert, we were deciding between the sesame flan and the white asparagus pudding. Our server said the flan was his favorite, but we decided to be adventurous and try the pudding. Wonderful texture, presentation and flavor. And not too sweet but the chocolate and raspberry glaze on the side was a nice sweet accompaniment. Total food cost was $60, wine was $40. Total time in the restaurant was about 1:45 (as I said, we took our time!) Would definitely go back!",0.9985,0.725,0.243,0.032,0.5459077380952381

We ordered exclusively from the Signature Nigiri section (with the exception of one hand roll) and none that we tried were stellar. The majority were only adequate, with a few being near inedible. Many of the flavor combinations were either missing a beat or had too much going on; the descriptions sounded promising but the execution was anything but. As for the near inedible ones, the hokkigai (surf clam), for example, comes to mind. It was so chewy and such a large piece that I was working on it for a solid two minutes and could not break it down. When your jaw fatigues from nigiri, you know something is wrong.

I just went back last night, as as usual, the fish was super fresh, we had great service, and the experience was mostly good.  However, the rice was a significant let down last night. It was undercooked, and improperly seasoned; it seemed like it was left soaking in water for a while before being cooked (which is good), but cooked to 80% of where you want sushi rice to be (which is bad, very bad). Rice is more than just a vehicle for premium fish; its constitutes a significant portion of each bite sized nigiri, and a larger proportion in te-maki. If this had been my first trip, it would have earned Macku 3 stars. I'm leaving this at 4 stars, but it really should be a 3 of based on just last night. Benefit goes to the great experiences I've had in the past.  I understand that every place can have an off night, but for the rice to be THIS off...regardless, although my faith in Macku is shaken, I still look forward to my next visit.",0.9588,0.821,0.141,0.038,0.4222222222222222

2015-01-10,2.0,"Okay so I just recently had dinner here and I was not impressed at all. First of all, it's pretty small and tables are right next to each other so you are right in your neighbors food: I think there's only like one or two more private tables by the window so I would request those if you get there. But it's not overly loud here which is nice but I didn't feel like it was intimate either.  Let's get to the important stuff. Our service was eh. Our server seemed cold the entire dinner, didn't smile, didn't offer any good recommendations, felt annoyed if I asked for a straw or extra sauce or anything. It's like I get it's not the best job being a server but work for your tip. Anyways, when making my order of like ten different things he just looked at me and didn't write anything down as to show off or I don't know what, but then he had to come back three more time asking me to repeat what I wanted. That's a star right there. Then all the sushi was brought out at random times which I'm not the biggest fan of. Just the whole service left a sour taste in my mouth and we also felt kind of rushed out of there even though I made reservations like a week in advance. Then onto the sushi. I really didn't like it. All the rolls were over stuffed with rice and very little fish. My spicy salmon had cilantro in it and didn't say that in the description so can we say gross. The eel spicy tuna roll had no eel. The individual eel pieces for $5 a piece were tiny. I mean where is the fish?! I felt like I'm on survivor eating all rice. Maybe I should have just ordered sashimi where I could have experienced their fish because I can't tell you much on the quality of it since I ate mostly rice and seaweed. I guess I have to stick to what I like when it comes to sushi and stop experimenting with new sushi places. Oh well, they really need to revamp their service and add more fish to all the rolls.

When I went to make the reservation, I was re-directed to open table, which I use all of the time, so I was happy to make my reservation this way, but.... when I arrived at the restaurant, they told me that only the other location uses open table, not the original one on Clybourn.  Not only that, but they would not give me the restaurant points since only one of their restaurants participates with open table.  Had I not been re-directed on line to make the reservations, i would not have thought twice about it, but now that I was, and they wouldn't honor it, I was not happy.  Really??? they only honor this at one restaurant and not the other?  I don't like being misdirected and misled, so I'll now think twice about going back here, even though I've enjoyed it in the past.  Back to the other reason for three stars.  As I mentioned, we have been coming here for years and my wife loves the Cod dinner and she loved the way that they made the Gomae.  the Cod was as always quite good, but they have cut down the portions by what seemed like more than 50%, as the meal was significantly smaller than it used to be.  And the Gomae, although also quite tasty, used to be made with spinich, bananas, and peanut sauce, but the peanut sauce is now missing, so it's a bit more run of the mill than it used to be.

I had high expectations for this restaurant as my dietitian colleague dines here frequently. Since kitchen sanitation audits are part of our daily jobs, the fly situation is an all too familiar indication of a possible bigger issue. My husband and I were the first customers here on a Sunday evening and had to change tables after about 20 minutes because the flies were so bad. Our first dragon roll came out and the server had to immediately pick it back up off of the table since two flies were already on the dish. We moved closer to the front door, only to have to watch someone kill flies on the front window with an electric bug zapper racket. We were given a comp dessert for the trouble (white asparagus pudding - pretty good), which unfortunately could not be given to go (we wanted out of the fly zone). I would have to disagree with the employee (manager, owner?) statement that the soy sauce is the cause of the flies. This seems like a new and hopefully temporary issue for Macku, but unfortunately we will not be returning. Maybe it is related to whatever water supply problem closed the restaurant earlier this year, however ceilings and vents could also use some cleaning.

Then another large fly decided to sit next to my wife. Fed up and not wanting to deal with the fly, I asked the Hostess for a fly swatter.

I left hungry, $98 lighter, with fly gut stains and upset over the ""ATTACK OF THE FLIES"" and ""eh"" response from the staff over the situation.  My Wife wasn't exactly thrilled, either.

We ordered a variety of signature nigiri - salmon, hamachi, unagi, tako and one order of the signature sashimi mebachi (big eye) which we had assumed for $15 would include more than one piece, but it was in fact one piece that we split (and it was delicious!).   The signature nigiri is what makes Macku stand apart from the other top sushi joints in Chicago.  They add a certain wow factor to nigiri that was exciting at first, but after the first round, we wanted to go back to the classic style and appreciate the fish on its own.  We added a few non-signature nigiri - another order of hamachi, white tuna, and sea bream. Overall the quality of the fish at Macku is about as good as it gets in Chicago.  The salmon was a tad bit disappointing, but everything else was perfect.  On top of it, we had delicious cocktails - both the saketini and the lychee martini were refreshing and perfectly made.

There are some places, like Sunda for example, that completely over sauce their sushi. Rolls come swimming in paint like sauces that just leave the raw fish getting super lost in the sauce, and I can buy sauce at Jewel, I probably shouldn't buy raw fish at jewel...I come because I want RAW FISH, with sauce, with accouterments designed to compliment not mask the fish. Macku has mastered this. Amazing sashimi, things like burdock root go well with the fish and don't overpower it. Beautiful beautiful plating in general.  On to the soup, usually when I get sushi I have blinders on, I want raw fish and I want nothing else besides alcohol and MAYBE tea after. But I love soup, I love pureed soup, I make broth all the time and take it to work in a travel mug like tea (there have been some awkward moments with that), I love stews etc I have my wedding registry is for nine different kinds of bowls, stew bowls, pasta bowls, deeper bowls etc. I was tempted by the soup, so I went for it. Amazing, amazing so good. On to Decor, nothing super special but clean, pretty etc.  Drinks, get the saketini, but only get 2. it's like straight alcohol. One of the most clean simple cocktails I've ever had.  Service: Damn good, the server offered to tailor a prix fix multiple course meal for us.

It did not include dessert per our request.  We started out with a white asparagus soup which had well developed flavors. After that, the chef brought out courses that included hamachi and other courses that I can't remember. But next time you're here, definitely ask for the chef's choice option.

Pairing wine with sushi can be tricky.  We tried several and all deserve four or five stars.  It is a bit on the expensive side (averaging $50 per person easily). All the sushi that we tried was ethereal and ubiquitous. Some recommendations: (1) Salmon roll you may want to try the dry rosé (one pairing hint is pink on pink).  The salmon makes the tart cherry and citrus in the wine pop and turns to sweet brininess. (2) Unagi nigiri goes perfectly with Gewürztraminer wine, which is an exotic match with matching the spicy sauce on the sushi while at the same time setting off the earthiness of the eel.  The spicy tuna roll balances beautifully with a barely off-dry Riesling.  (3) Crab roll (also known as the ""Spicy Spider"") pairs perfectly with Grüner Veltliner, because the sweet crab and the citrus in ""Grüner"" turns to gorgeous lime, and all of its aromatics make a showing. It a wonderful amalgamation. (4) The shrimp nigiri pairs nicely with Pinot Gris. The apple and aromatic stone fruit in the wine are the perfect marriage to sweet shrimp. Service was excellent. This is a small and narrow restaurant. They do have a carry-out and/or delivery service. Their menu is very extensive.  ""Yay!

I hope for Macku's sake this was an off night.  One of my fellow diners is a former sushi chef himself and both him and myself, as well as our third all shared the same unfortunate experience in 100$ agreement. Right down to the basics, the rice was extremely overcooked and not seasoned at all.  The soy, all 3 of us felt tasted more like Soba sauce than soy.  The Saba special was bland and tasteless, surprising since Saba itself can be fairly bold.  The Bonito nigiri had the consistency of cat food.  The Hamachi Ebi Tempura... a disaster.  All I got out of it was cucumber and scallions. Scant hamachi to be found.  I could go on and on with each and every component we ordered but in short, sadly enough, even the spicy tuna roll was inferior to rolls I have bought pre-made in the corner grocer.

This is the midwest, and unless you get fresh fish daily straight from fish markets like some of the top sushi places in the country, you don't get that kind of quality.  But that said, if you're willing to sacrifice just a little bit on the freshness, then Macku gets the innovative flavors right better than any other sushi restaurant I've been to in Chicago, and definitely gives you the best value for the price range. This isn't quite the traditional Japanese purist's nigiri, but it also isn't the Americanized cream cheese crap that masquerades as sushi in other restaurants.

2013-03-14,5.0,"This is a long overdue review especially as I've been coming to this restaurant since it was Kaze in Roscoe Village. Don't let the ""signature sushi"" (i.e., modified) aspect of this spot fool you: even sushi traditionalists should not pass up a trip here, and Macku deserves a 5-star rating about as easily as a restaurant can. First off, let's get it out of the way: the sushi quality is top notch. It is on par with Chicago's top spots. It's not a bad thing here to just let the chefs carve some sashimi up and enjoy it. Of course, the signature sushi should not be missed. Personally I find the signature salmon - topped with enoki mushrooms, truffle oil, and chives - to die for. It is among my favorite all-time dishes anywhere. Foodies should of course eventually try them all. It is not uncommon for my sushi-loving friends, on their first visit, to create their own sampler by ordering one of each signature sushi on Macku's menu - and promptly upon finishing, immediately order another round of every single one! The hot dishes are no slouch either. For sure, get the soup. Macku's white asparagus soup is always my favorite but it really doesn't matter what it is, the soup is always amazing. I'm a big fan of the duck and venison entrees as well. That is yet another reason why Macku shines: It is truly a place where a large group of people can dine and likely find something that everyone can enjoy - and all at a very high level of preparation and execution. Macku is an easy 5-star, and one of those restaurants that really makes me miss not living in Chicago anymore.",0.9806,0.832,0.136,0.032,0.5922766439909297

A suggestion to anyone who has the pleasure of dining here. Ask your waiter to have the chef plan your meal. Indicate your likes, he/she will tell you what is freshest, unique, seasonally available. Let them know number of courses and if you are wanting to put some budget constraint let them know as well.

Chef Macku-san and the rest of the chefs and staff have absolutely nailed it when it comes to sushi. Their specialties are absolutely spectacular and if you ask for one of their set menus where they decide what to make you you won't regret it.

This is definitely the best sushi in Chicago. What an incredible meal! Zagat and Michelin rated, of course. I cannot believe I waited this long to try Macku. We started with the bison appetizer - very tender and flavorful. The thoughtfulness of the dish as well as the presentation was awesome. This dish is going on my ""Crave List"" along with... pretty much every single nigiri we ordered. The nama sake nigiri - with truffle oil, mushrooms and chives (OH MY!) - was amazing. Also loved the hamachi with the sauteed banana pepper and the shiro maguro with the banana wasabi puree.  Everything else we ordered was also incredible - akami, otoro, kanpachi, miso soup, and udon.

2012-10-15,2.0,"Macku, Macku, where to start.  After reading the reviews and hearing so many great things I expected much more from what my neighborhood japanese restaurant had to offer.   The location on Clybourn is a bit removed, and rather industrial, which only added to my personal lure of discovering a hidden gem for an original meal.  I could see how this might be off putting to some, but whatever doubts you may have about the presentation and ambiance of the restaurant should be quickly quelled upon entering the restaurant.  It's, cute.  It's intimate.  It's tastefully decorated.  The chefs are clearly the focal point of this place.  Their elevated, sort of on stage and working fervently.   Having lived around the corner for the better part of the year I finally decided to make the trip to Macku to indulge in their ""omakase"" experience, a multi-course, chef-driven meal.  The terms are negotiable, as I understand it, and craving a wonderful experience I chose to negotiate the ""price doesn't matter"" option.  ""Just wow me.""  Unfortunately, as I'm sitting here  now, I'm having great trouble trying to remember any of my dishes.  I recall having a couple of dishes taken directly from the menu that lacked the inspiration I was looking for.  I was given a 2 oz amuse soup of sorts, can't remember what it was.  The grand finale to my meal was a selection of generic nigiri.  All of this, with two sake pairings, came to the price of $120...for 1.  I expected to spend to enjoy, I just wish there was more to enjoy. The service was outstanding.  Really.  My server was engaging, knowledgeable, and generally passionate about the meal he was hoping to help create.  He assisted me in pairing a couple of sake throughout the meal. **4 stars for ambiance. **2 stars for food.  **5 stars for service. **1 star for the experience.

2012-10-08,5.0,"When I Yelp, I try to rate each business based on how well they're doing what they set out to do. So, a greasy spoon might get five stars for having really awesome over easy eggs and super nice waitresses. Likewise, a dive bar might get five stars for having $2 beers and lots of weird characters sitting at the bar. But Macku, wow. This gets more of an objective five stars. Rating this meal against all other meals one might eat in Chicago, this one excels.  Macku is an excellent place to go for a Very Special Occasion, such as a significant anniversary or a round-numbered birthday.  (Thanks again, Honey! Great choice!) A few basics before the food:  The ambiance is modern and clean, with high backed booths, soft lighting, and a pastel color palette.  The service is excellent -- our waiter was enthusiastic, informed, and gave us great guidance without pretension. Nearby parking on the street was surprisingly easy.  While this meal is so fabulous that it's absolutely worthy of a splurge, it's not too outrageously expensive. We ordered absolutely everything we wanted, and it came out to about $35 per person, comparable in price to many lesser sushi places.  On to the food. In a word: mind-expanding. It's definitely strange for a sushi establishment to be known for its soup, but Macku is, and you should partake. The sweet potato soup was spectacular. None of the flavors were expected, but they complimented each other incredibly well: sweet and savory broth, salty chives a distinct seafood flavor.  The signature sashimi is a must. The hamachi was an intricate, surprising dish: a soft, delicate piece of yellow tail on top of a firm, pretty slice of beet, with a complimentary crunch of toasted pine nuts, and the mild spice of parsley oil and sweet arugula puree. I felt like royalty eating food this good. Fancy sushi often seems needlessly complicated, with flashy ingredients competing for the spotlight. Usually, I'd rather just eat the fish without all the fanfare. But this was fancy and indulgent in a very deliberate and thoughtful way. The flavors all improved each other. The textures and flavors were perfectly balanced and each bite seemed complete.  We also had a nice selection of nigiri. The fish was perfect -- flavorful, soft, and beautifully presented. The uni was the best. The one signature nigiri we tried wasn't really my cup of tea -- it was tuna with shiitake mushrooms and a salty and spicy soy sauce -- I think I'd have preferred simply the tuna. However, if I ever get the opportunity to come back (here's hoping!) I'd definitely want to try other signature nigiri.  Finally, even though we'd already eaten too much, we had a poached pear dessert with green tea ice cream.  A perfect end to the best meal ever.",0.9991,0.734,0.256,0.01,0.5978935185185182

2012-07-25,5.0,"If I'd have died right after this meal, it wouldn't have been a bad way to go. Having just visited Chicago, I HAD to write a review of this place because thankfully, it did not disappoint! (I was torn between trying out Macku or Arami.) MAN what a meal. Had a bit of a bumpy start, as they were out of the cava and the sweet potato soup already at 7:15 p.m. (and I was convinced I could've snagged a glass of that cava if I could only have gotten the waiter to stand still for a moment so I could order it!) Regardless, things settled into a groove nicely thereafter. We had the bison appetizer, which was very flavorful. We were forced to try the white asparagus soup since they were out of the other...and we were SO THANKFUL we did. My SO isn't exactly the most adventurous eater and this soup was his very favorite item of the whole evening (I agree it was good, but have to disagree it was the meal's ""star."") It behooves me to say this is the meal where I found out (after 6 years!) that my SO is the ""roll guy"" at sushi places - as many times as we've been - and that I'm the ""fish girl."" I really hadn't figured this out before now but...wow. Okay. That said - our amberjack sashimi was really superb. Juicy and buttery beyond belief. At our waiter's suggestion, we ordered the Hamachi, Hirame and Nama Sake from the signature nigiri selections...and I can only swear at you in expletives to describe how ungodly good they were - I'd give one of my toes (at least) to have a piece of the Hirame and/or Nama Sake RIGHT NOW. In fact I wanted to go back on my own a day or two later to gobble down more of them. (Crushingly, I wasn't able.) At this point this sushi vs. rolls disparity became evident, so boyfriend orders the spicy tuna roll...which arrived and was visually disappointing but VERY tasty - and very spicy since they used chili oil in lieu of spicy mayo (thankfully.) I only mention how it wasn't visually interesting because we saw a vast array of artful rolls coming past us repeatedly. Dunno what they were but I wish I did! We finished by sharing the black cod entree and again.....STAGGERINGLY good. Incredible. What a flavor combination! HOLEEE CRAAAAAP. Macku rocks it. Kills it. Whatever. We escaped for about $100 because we didn't drank that much or eat dessert and it was worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY. My only complaint is that the waiters seemed pretty stressed out - not rude but terse. It's a small joint that's popular so it gets busy no doubt, but I swore one waiter was going to knock me down TWICE when I was going to the restroom and he was coming out of the kitchen...and really not apologetic either time (and I wasn't shuffling around like a dinosaur either.) No need for that really but whatevs. Otherwise a more or less perfect experience (for me at least!!)

2012-04-05,2.0,"I decided on Macku because one of my besties is in from out of town and I wanted to impress her with somewhere new instead of my normal routine; Arami, Sushi Wabi, Sai Cafe, Hachi's Kitchen. She lives in Barcelona and has eaten sushi all over the world including Japan. I also picked it due to the accolades I have read here on yelp as well as other places online. My experience at Macku was quite the opposite of many reviewers so I went back and re-read a few posts. I noticed that there are a high number of folks that were having their first sushi experience at Macku and really have no frame of reference. Yes, there are also many that claim to be sushi experts too -  I'm just trying to figure this out..... The atmosphere is quite like many small neighborhood sushi restaurants. There are a few tables up front,  a sushi bar on one wall,  banquete seating along the other -  small tables w/ white table cloths, candle, bamboo, yada, yada.... The service was accommodating. The only thing I noticed is that he never asked us how things were. But if he is good at reading body language and facial expressions he - perhaps that explains it. I felt bad because tables are pretty close together and my friend is pretty animated and loud so I'm quite certain the people eating on either side heard her NOT enjoying her sushi. She kept insisting that I say something to our server but I wasn't up to it. Win some lose some.. 1. White asparagus soup: Presentation is formal, poured at the table, shredded crab?, flavorless red swirls on the bowl (guessing beet puree?). Flavor of the soup is unaturally and overly sweet.  Yes, I know asparagus is sweet but I didn't detect even the slightest hint of asparagus flavor nor anything that resembled asparagus? This sweetness was something different. Didn't taste crab either but the shredded bits of something I just assume/hope were the crab. Just very one dimensional flavor. It was a caramel pudding color and the texture was also that of a light pudding. I was really bummed by this because I love asparagus and every other asparagus soup I have ever had. I just made a killer asparagus quiche for myself last week! So my point is that for me not to like asparagus soup - is odd. P.S. They say this is a special but I've seen it in many reviews going way back so they always have it. This seems a sneaky trick to get your $. Most people won't ask the price when ordering the ""special"" soup. $15 = ridiculous and insulting for this.... 2. Sweet potato soup: Came out like a boiling cauldren of orange pudding. The server said it's served in the same pot it's cooked in. It was still cooking/boiling for 5 minutes after he put it down! They must use the same base in the soups because that sweet flavor - same as the asparagus - I'm not a fan. Also, this was so thick you could eat it with a fork. The only good thing I can say is it was a tad better than the asparagus soup.  3. Sushi: We had two rolls, tuna tartare, yellow tail sashimi and salmon nigiri.  I won't go too far into the sushi except to say that what bothered me most were the tough overcooked shrimp, the rolls were sloppy and some falling apart, rice was bland and very gummy,  tuna tartare was lacking flavor and my friend didn't like the salmon or the yellow tail due to appearance and texture which she has ordered almost every time we have ever been for sushi. The yellow tail was gelatinous like bacon that's just started to cook not firm as it should be, a bit grey in spots & darker than I have ever seen. The salmon was an unaturally bright orange so it's probably farm raised where they use artificial coloring. Wild caught is more of a red/dark pink color. If you're wondering which is better for you and has less toxins - it's wild. I wish I had left after the soup. Don't let the unique combinations & presentations or the pomp and circumstance fool you.  It's all smoke and mirrors to justify the price and distract from what's important - the true quality, flavors & substance of the food which I found to be lacking.  We each had a flight of sake and our bill was $65 each w/ tip. Quite an expensive mistake that I won't make again.  I feel the need to say something positive. Staff was nice, cucumber & avocado were fresh, easy street parking and nice array of sake to choose from.

2012-03-18,5.0,"A close friend of my son is a sushi aficionado who believes that Macku is the only place to go in Chicago for this type of food.  My son has accompanied his friend to Macku a couple of times within the last several months and has extolled the quality of the food.  Knowing that I had never eaten sushi, my son invited me to join the two of them to try it out.  So on a weeknight in early March the three of us dined at Macku.  It is located on north Clybourn St. in a lively section of town having numerous restaurants and bars.  My son's friend had made reservations for 7:30 p.m. and when my son and I arrived shortly before then, the friend was already seated at a well placed table in the rear end of the dining room.  The restaurant, which is set up with tables as well as a counter with stools, seats approximately 46 and is very comfortable.  On the night we were there it was bustling with customers. My son's friend, who is a long-standing patron of this restaurant and well acquainted with the staff, graciously consented to do all the ordering.  He was very ably assisted by our waiter John who was professional and extremely informative.   As to what we ate, please understand that because I am a complete neophyte relative to sushi, I am not capable of providing the Japanese names of the approximately 10 dishes we shared.  However, I can say that most of the food was either specially ordered or the special of the night.  It included white tuna ceviche, asparagus soup with foie gras (the only dish that was cooked), tuna tartar, spring rolls, spicy tuna rolls, and asparagus pudding for dessert.  Our meal was accompanied by a pouilly-fuissé that was selected in coordination with John. Prior to our dinner at Macku I had very mixed feelings as to what to expect.  I thought that I probably would like some items, dislike some, and be indifferent to the rest.  Well, I am extremely pleased to report that I was greatly surprised as to how phenomenally good all the food was.  Everything was extremely fresh, wonderfully flavorful, very colorful, and beautifully presented.  Most important, nothing in our food had the remotest hint of any ""fishy"" taste.  Moreover, we all agreed that our wine, which was very tasty and refreshing, was the perfect accompaniment to our meal.  During our dinner while course after course was presented and consumed with great relish by all three of us, I kept saying that I couldn't believe how good the food was.  This dinner at Macku was certainly one of the most unique and best dining experiences I ever have had!",0.9974,0.81,0.177,0.013,0.5625221483942415
2012-03-13,4.0,"Macku was my first sushi experience ever. I was super excited that there was ""good sushi"" in the Chicago area and was even more excited to test and share if it was an amazing experience. - Being my first sushi ever, I'm no expert and relied heavily on recommendations. I tried the salmon, hamachi, and whitefish nigiri - each was really good; the fish melts in your mouth and has surprisingly clean flavor. Pretty great experience, though a bit pricey. - As a safety dish (heh), I ordered the cod entree - which featured a chocolate-based sauce. The cod was panko-fried and cooked perfectly - the quality of the fish was very fresh, but I felt like the whole thing was still too safe, even as a safety dish. It came the strawberries and chocolate, which made the dish slightly a dessert - but the sweetness was balanced enough not to overcome the fish. - Since Macku isn't easy for us to get to (trains + buses would take 40min one way), we tried a few extra dishes to get the full experience. We tried the spicy scallop handroll, which was spicy (sometimes it isn't heh) and had about 50% scallop. We also tried the special spicy tuna roll which was expensive ($15) but overall enjoyable. - Lastly, we ended on the white asparagus pudding with strawberry purée. The pudding is very creamy and smooth - and tastes slightly like the white asparagus it's made of. The surrounding pattern is basically a strawberry sauce that nicely complements the pudding's creaminess. Very unique and tasty. I would definitely come back to Macku's, especially to try their tasting menus or specials.

To be honest I didn't remember much about it since we last went when we had a 12 day old newborn and I've done my best to block those days out.  But according to my 2010 review I was a fan so I agreed to make reservations there. It turns out that Macku was way better I remembered (or at last way better than my 4 star review).  We were seated near the window in this cozy little restaurant and ordered some cocktails, an uh-mazing lychee martini for me.  When it came to food we ordered a few things off the menu, but mostly stuck with the specials...since someone wise once told me ""there's a reason they are special."" And special indeed because everything we ordered was to die for. As for what we ordered off the regular menu: * sweet potato soup: incredible and so filling * nama sake nigiri: really does melt in your mouth * hamachi ebi tempura: probably my least favorite of everything we ordered, but still really good and fresh For dessert the birthday boy decided he wanted some mochi, but our waiter urged us to get the asparagus dessert instead. I was skeptical since I don't typically like veggies in my dessert, but our waiter had led us in the right direction all night. He did it again because this was easily one of the best (and prettiest) desserts I've eaten in a long time.  We left very full and satisfied with this meal. My husband and I are a bit obsessed when it comes to sushi and both agreed Macku just may be the best sushi restaurant in Chicago.

The sweet potato, carrot and white asparagus are also richly gratifying  purées. Get a flight of nigiris to sample divisive toppings including banana wasabi and cow cheese.

Anyway, this place is a winner. Went here with a good friend this week and this place is a real improvement. Sleek, minimal decor - pretty typical for a sushi restaurant, but still appealing. Nice lighting, serene and clean bathrooms.  Started out with a chilly, immaculate Martini. Well done.  The ""Chef's Special"" alleviated ""what to order"". Surprise us! Started out with a delicious soup. Yose Nabe, a soup with sea bass fish cake and quail egg. I loved this, and could see myself coming by for lunch on a cold winter day and eating this whole bowl. It was PLENTY for two to share, it'd be a meal for one. This was probably my favorite thing. Then time for my second and LAST Martini, just as appealing as the first. Two Martini Limit firmly in place. The goodies. The Chef's Special is sort of a license for the chef to run wild. I'm okay with chefs running amok in the kitchen, in fact, I encourage it. The dinner we had started with a petit lamb chop. Mmmm, baby lambie - that was tender and juicy. Next was a plate with Super White Tuna with slightly hot spices. Mmmmmm . . . super white is my FAVORITE. This was fantastic too. One plate had two sushi pieces topped by a baby octopus. Oh, my. I nibbled they tiny feet of the baby octopus, but was unable to consume the diminutive cephalopod. I am an omnivore, but would prefer my food remain unrecognizeable. The next sushi bites we had were decadent. Regular sushi pieces, but with extras - a dab of foie gras - that was my favorite. Delicious spices and flavors.  The dessert . . . mon dieu, this thing was over the top. A hockey puck shaped pastry shell topped with sort of spicy . . . cotton candy and a Lotus flower. Break the shell and molten chocolate and some sort of white stuff (!!!!) oozes out. And . . . almonds. Could there be more flavors to this thing? Hardcore dessert fans would love this thing.

I was pleasantly surprised by the upscale vibe you get when you walk in, and it's not distinctively a vibe of ""I'm in a sushi restaurant"".  It feels very neutral in this way...Macku is much more formal than your average sushi restaurant, and the prices reflect that. Appetizers, Soups (not your run of the mill miso soup anywhere to be found), Sashimis...all very fancy schmancy.  None of the entrees sounded particularly appealing tho. After reading other reviews, we knew we had to try the sweet potato soup...there also was a special mushroom soup, so we ordered both. The mushroom soup was delicious, with shrimp, mussel, and truffle.  The sweet potato, however, was icky...thick, gravy consistency and way to sweet. It got sent back right away, although our server seemed annoyed and didn't apologize or say he would take it off our bill. Later we came to find out that he didn't' take it off our bill, not to mention the special mushroom soup was $15.00, holy cow...I should've licked the bowl for that price, but it was delicious so it's not a big deal. Our other appetizers, the hamachi sashimi with parsley oil and beets was delicious and so wonderfully out of the box. The desserts were also a nice diversion from your usual sorbet and green tea ice cream options at other sushi places. We had the Asian pear with fried bananas and sake reduction... yum!   I will be back, but I think will try for a less moody server. Our table neighbors told us they always got this one server who just brings over what he thinks is best that night...they say ""surprise us!"" and they seemed very happy with what everything they got.

Speaking of which, I acknowledge the seeming ridiculousness of ordering sweet potato or asparagus soup when your mind is thinking ""sushi"", but release your hesitation. Truly. Both soups are phenomenal.  The asparagus includes a dumpling atop fois grois.  Hoity-toity? Mayhaps. Stick your pinky in the air and work with it---you won't care.

Now, if you are like myself and are after very creative and different presentations of primarily sashimi and higher end dishes with innovation,  attention to detail, and expert level presentation, then Macku is for you.  If you wait for the chef to suggest the use of soy, then this is for you. If like myself, you always order Omakase, and let the chef roll, then dining here is an ABSOLUTE MUST.  You will walk away on cloud nine. So with that taken care of, I sat at the bar and ordered Omakase.  The chef asked what my price expectation was - a very nice touch.  I told him ""I have no limit"" and received the below.  Wound up being about $125 before tip with a very nice house sake. First course was  Edamame soup with miso, clam, coconut foam and dill.  Side of ginger croutons with edible orchid.  This was the most creative presentations of edamame I have experienced to date.  The color and texture of the soup as well as the flavor profile was amazing.  If you are used to steamed and salted edamame as a starter, this takes that game from JV or Varsity to Pro at a whole new stadium. The next course was red snapper sashimi in balsamic reduction with chives and pine nuts.  The fish was super fresh and tasty.   The balsamic reduction with chives was a perfect compliment.  Kudos on the pairing and reduction.   The next course was four preparations each presented separately on the same plate. Chilled spinach with crawfish tempura  Lobster salad - lobster crème, almond, mango, ikura, endive Minced spicy tuna with chili puree with cilantro oil Mini toasts with currant jelly Absolutely wonderful creations, and the presentation and flavors were first class.  Five stars again. The next course was a horse mackerel with ginger soy vinaigrette.  The mackerel was incredibly fresh and the house vinaigrette was a perfect compliment.  Kudos on the vinaigrette Five stars again! The next course was  Skate breaded with gyoza dumpling with froi gras honey and fried skatewing and bone.  Ok, I got to say this - the presentation on this dish rivaled or was the best I've seen for a fish presentation.  The skate and dumpling were to die for.  The fried skate bone texture and flavor were outstanding.  The timing and temperature on the frying were spot on. The final course was four more sashimi preparations: Ika with tobika, Salmon with enoli mushroom chive, and Flounder with froi gras and Bonito with chive.   Again, these were all five star and the creativity and presentation were best in class. So there you are.  If you are looking for every day rolls at a bargain price, drive on by.   If you love top notch Japanese, you cannot leave this off your list. AMBIENCE - A SERVICE - A+ (I was at the sushi bar and had a chef waiting on me) FOOD - A+ (for innovation, presentation, and amazing flavor profiles )  PRICE - A",0.9993,0.775,0.206,0.019,0.5347763347763348

Macku is more than just a sushi place though - it's quaint and casual, with a great ambiance and intimacy.  Each plate is very artistically done. It's obvious the chefs at Macku pay close attention to detail and take pride in their work. My date and I started the meal with the tempura. It was a small portion, but a perfect starter. Next we tried the Hamachi nigiri. I highly recommend this as well as the Hamachi makimono. The flavors are seriously great and the roll was one of my favorites, I will absolutely be returning to order it again. For dessert we had the ""special"" chocolate mousse, which turned out to be really special because it was $15 on the bill... all of their other desserts were $8.

Not only are they plated so artistically, but the food is as good as it is presented. I think my friend and I found our new favorite sushi go-to. We started with the white tuna ceviche appetizer special, which was just so fresh and melted in your mouth. Second, we dined on the hamachi signature sashimi with yellowtail, red and golden beets, pine nuts, swwet arugala puree and parsley oil. WOW; I really wanted to ask for a straw to sip up all the puree left on the plate. What a stunning plate; fabulous choice for sashimi. Third was the rainbow roll, a standard, classic roll with a variety of fish, but I have to say it tasted so much better than any I've ever had. Light, refreshing and pure. Last, but certainly not the least, we had noticed a dish that the other table had ordered that looked exotic, so we asked our waiter what they were having. Turns out, it wasnt anything they had on the menu!! Love those kinds of finds....next time you go to Macku, please ask your waiter if the chef can make the Japanese flatbread.

We also got the sesame flan, which was great.  Somehow tasted like peanut butter?!  Again, very unique.

After trying this restaurant, this phrase best describes the place: ""do not judge a book by its cover"". The restaurant interior is awesome, it's small and trendy (+1 star). But let's face it, the major part of the restaurant's review should be based on the food and not how the place looks. The staff was friendly except the sushi chef, he seems kind of pissed off and didn't say welcome or anything. Let me talk about the food. I love sushi and I am always trying to find my favorite sushi places to go. And there are so much better places around this area than Macku. Judging by the quality of the food, Toro and Sushi O Sushi have the best sushi around this area. I had salmon spider, sweet potato tempura, spicy salmon, and yellow tail ebi tempura rolls. The tempura was so thick and hard that my friend almost got her mouth scraped with that thing. I couldn't even taste the soft shell crab (spider) or the shrimp tempura because of it's hard and thick textures. Second, where is chef's special sauce on the top? Each sushi chef makes his own specialty sauce for special rolls, I was expecting something on top of our rolls, but there were none. If I wanted to just eat sushi and rice, I would've ordered nigiri or sashimi pieces.     I would come here if I need somewhere candlelit and quiet, but not for the food.

Presentation was nice and there were lots of little pieces. However, I think there were too many little pieces there just for show and to keep the description long. They didn't have much to do with the taste. Then we ordered almost all of the Signature Nigiris. Nothing special. Why are they signature? The fish was also room temperature so I was a little weary of how long they were left out. We then ordered some more Nigiris and Entrees. Nigiris were ok, like other sushi places. The Entrees again were overdone with presentation and little paste decorations. The waiter said to just mash everything together. Why not just put the past where it belongs or make sure the main dish is solid, then add your garnishes and decorations.  I mean, would a pea size of sweet potato affect the overall taste, nope.  For dessert we shared the asian pear. It was good with the sake reduction sauce. I liked it. So, there you go.

Personally, I tend to be more of a traditionalist when it comes to food and find myself being more fond of well done classic dishes over a strange fusion of cuisines that many times, in my opinion, don't go together. You have both options at Macku - the restaurant offers classic sushi items as well as special sashimi and nagiri dishes with a twist. The traditional sushi items (I tried spicy tuna & rainbow makimono) were outstanding.  However, the special sashimi & nagiri dishes were hit or miss.  Some of the ingredients  seemed to overpower the delicious, high quality fish.  Other positives, the ambiance and food presentation felt hip and trendy in a good way and the service was excellent.  Not sure I'll go back, but if I do, I'm going traditional Japanese all the way.",0.9596,0.816,0.168,0.016,0.5151953601953602

2010-11-12,4.0,"Macku is a nice little space that seats roughly 40 people. The decor is simple and elegant, much like its predecessor restaurant Kaze and it takes advantage of its brick walls and blends together an intimate environment. Rereading my own review of Kaze, I discovered that they also retained a lot of the menu (I thought some of my selections were eerily familiar!), clearly past favorites since these were included in my omakase (chef's choice). Much like its predecessor, Macku goes beyond your typical sushi restaurant into culinary and visual treats with its French influenced Japanese fare.  Our waitress was polite and knowledgeable, going through the specials at length and took disappointment out of the equation immediately by informing us of seasonal items that were unavailable.  I ended up ordering: Sweet potato soup - hearty, but really flavorful made with lobster broth Nama sake nigiri - I just assumed since it included truffle oil that it'd be delicious, but I didn't really taste it. It was interesting but the flavor definitely overwhelmed the fish Shiro maguro nigiri - excellent, a carryover from Kaze but much more distinctive than I (didn't) remember. The banana puree was very complementary and added a unique twist.  Whitefish tempura - another Kaze carryover, was very nice aesthetically, but a little underwhelming. The tempura skin was not crunchy and almost nonexistent, essentially a layer of starch. The whitefish was excellent and tender, though I didn't think it particularly retained the flavor of the broth it was sitting in. Hotate salad - very unique, possible my favorite item. Large grilled scallops and bonito on top of what seemed to be a vege roll....rolled and stuffed with veges! lots of texture and crunch and very satisfying Tuna zuke roll - a special that evening, it was a pressed roll alternating tuna and shrimp with topiko on top Sake spider roll - bit unusual in that I've never had salmon included in a spider roll, but this roll was just average I had the benefit of a  restaurant.com  certificate, but even without it, the meal came out very reasonable for a dinner for 2, and I was pretty surprised that I was actually full.  Would return!",0.9963,0.81,0.184,0.006,0.5765320910973085

2010-10-13,5.0,"Honestly, I had to write a review to defend Macku from the very few people who have given this place negative reviews as the reviews are so absurd and clearly come from individuals who have no idea what  a good restaurant is or who have never had a meal in a great restaurant and thus cannot process the delight that is Macku.  My wife and I have been going to Kaze/Macku for 4 years and it is hands down the best sushi in Chicago (Mirai is second) and some of the best sushi in the US period. My wife and I have had sushi all over the United States (Nobu in Vegas, Miami and NYC), Morimoto (Philadelphia), Katsuya (LA), Bond Street (Miami) etc.) and this place is better than all of these places. If your sushi taste is California rolls and tuna rolls, don't review this place and waste people's time as it is obvious you have never had real sushi and probably think Kamehachi and Bob San make amazing sushi! Most of the negative reviews seem to come from people in this bucket which is why I am making this comment. First, the soups are unreal. The mushroom and carrot soup are just delicious.  Also if Macku ever has a special soup order it as they are always delicious If you want to start with a salad you cannot go wrong with the Hotate salad with scallops or the seaweed salad with fried shrimp, both of which are insanely delicious.  If you like pieces with toppings and creativity than Macku is truly paradise. I suggest trying the Sake with truffle oil and mushroom toppings, the White Tuna with wasabi banana puree, and the Katsuo which is bonito with fried garlic and tomato mushroom puree.  All are so good it is like eating delicious French butter!  Also the Mebachi (i.e. big eyed tuna with pickled onions, chives, truffle oil and soy) is orgasmic. I guarantee if you go with guests you will be fighting with your guests to see who gets the last piece of any of the aforementioned items. Any special roll they have ever made is pure culinary bliss and just order one of each and if they only have one order two of them.  The all time classic is the special spicy tuna with sweet potato and tempura! One of the best rolls of all time.  The creativity and the taste is insane.  The basic rolls are all good too, however we never order them cause it is a waste of time, when you can eat all of the specialties Macku has to offer. Like I stated in the intro if all you like are California rolls and spicy tuna rolls, it probably means you think Cheesecake factory and Maggiannos are delicious and MK, Avec, Blackbird, Perennial and Spiaggia are pretentious and not amazing, and thus have no idea how to judge real food as you have never tasted it! As far as dessert, the Asparagus pudding is one of the best desserts in the city. Who in the world would have ever thought that asparagus would make a great dessert?  Macku did and that is why he is a genius. He is one of the most creative and talented chefs.  In sum, I have never been to a sushi restaurant as creative and good at using unique flavors and combinations of flavors to create amazing dishes. The amount of friends that my wife and I have converted to dedicated fans of Macku is endless. My aunt from Brussels first sushi experience ever was Kaze and it blew her out of the water as she appreciates creativity and quality in food! As far as the staff and hostess, they are wonderful and know how to treat loyal customers. In four (4) years we have never had bad service EVER.  So any of the comments about bad service are absurd and come from people who are used to getting food sitting under heat lamps and which is brought out immediately when ordered instead of being prepared and made fresh as is done at Macku. Tip for these people: if your meal is done and served in 25 minutes it means the food is not made fresh and more than likely not good. Also who wants to eat a meal in 30 minutes! Great food is meant to be appreciated and slowly enjoyed! Thus, if you don't want fresh and delicious food do not come to Macku and post a review about something you know nothing about. One can only hope that Macku chooses to open more restaurants so that more people can be exposed to the greatness that is Macku.",0.9994,0.759,0.212,0.03,0.5757271825396827

The only thing that I would do differently is order an appetizer before eating the wonderful sweet potato soup.  The reason being, the soups are so rich that on an empty stomach it was difficult to enjoy after a few savory bites.   You can find a $25 coupon on  restaurant.com  for Macku which will help with the final check.  The price point is higher than I usually spend on a date night but it was worth every penny and I can't wait to go back.  Be sure to make a reservation though.",0.9432,0.848,0.126,0.026,0.5058703703703703

Then we ordered a special roll they had off the menu in addition to the spider salmon roll, crunchy shrimp roll and spicy tuna.

They weren't the worst but they were probably as good as pre-made ones you can get a trader joes. They all kind of ended up tasting the same even though they were made differently. Not sure if it was the rice but they also kept falling apart. Based on the rolls themselves I wouldn't go back.

I agree with an earlier review that complemented the waitstaff for their knowledge of the dishes.  And these are not simple sushi preparations.  Most have several ingredients in both the fish and the sauces.  They are a bit rote when reciting them, but it was much appreciated when each dish arrived to remind us what we are eating. We had several individual sushi pieces, rolls,specials, gomae and deserts.  Nothing disappointed.  The fish was the freshest I have had in Chicago and the preparations were creative and melded ingredients with precision in both taste and texture.  Gomae with fired bananas and sweet potato shards?  Sounds odd, tasted amazing.  Granted, some of the combinations border on fussy when described but not when eaten.  True, the price point is a bit higher than many sushi places, but here you definitely get what you pay for.  I was a fan of Kaze but, at least based on my first visit, this place blows them away.",0.9423,0.799,0.133,0.068,0.48580086580086584

I am so glad that we did! It was amazing.  We started with the chef's special, the white asparagus soup with lump crab meat, a foie gras dumpling and a beet/truffle puree...AMAZING! We were fighting over the last drops. As Dave said to the waiter...there's a lot of flavors going on in that bowl...I don't know what any of them are, but they're fantastic!  Then we chose the grilled lamb chops with the spicy asian slaw, which were cooked perfectly, spicy and delicious. From there we each had two pieces of nigiri, each of us tried the super fatty white tuna and the salmon with mushrooms and truffle oil. The fish was so fresh and flavorful, it would have been a sin to use soy sauce (even though they make their own low-sodium variety in house). From there we split a rainbow roll since we couldn't get enough of the fish...it was everything you want a rainbow roll to be, generous portions of sashimi that were almost too beautifully presented to eat. To round out the meal, we each had a handroll (spicy tuna and spicy scallop). Everything was wonderfully made, and even the spicy tuna handroll had generous chunks of tuna instead of just being a mushy, mayo-y mess.  The bill was reasonable, the service was EXCELLENT, and the vibe was cool contemporary and understated. Our server described every special in a way that made me want to try everything, and he was fantastic in every sense of the word.  FIVE STARS!

We were trying to be budget conscious so we picked out our own nigiri and maki instead of doing the chef's tasting menu. The chef's tasting menu started at $100 a couple and up, where the chef would include his favorite dishes both cooked and uncooked.  The space was cute and trendy-ish, with lots of earth tones.  I was kinda iffy on the place because I was afraid it was going to be one of those fu-fu places with pretty food but mediocre taste/substance.  I was pleasantly surprised... We ordered a few pieces of nigiri and a couple of maki rolls.  Let's begin with the maki.  Not great. They were nothing special. Now, let's get to the good stuff. The nigiri pieces were fantastic!! Huge portioned, super fresh, inventively tasty AND pretty.... We ordered a couple of pieces of the signature as well as the regular nigiri.  Our favorite was the Shiro Maguro, which is white tuna with a banana wasabi puree.  We ended up getting more nigiri at the end of the night.  Being budget conscious here did not pay off, because we ended up paying about $100 for the meal for the two of us, without alcohol.  That being said, we will still definitely return, next time skipping the maki and ordering the nigiri and other items on the menu.",0.9938,0.798,0.191,0.01,0.6369214119214119

2010-07-15,5.0,"There are sushi places, and then, there are Sushi places. Macku is one of the latter. My husband, three-year old and I have been here twice, and are still dazzled: What was this that just became us so astonishingly well?  On our first visit, we opted for the chef's choice. While it was quite amazing, and even though most of what we got hit right on, we felt more confident the second time around, and ordered ourselves. Meaning another round of the  arugula bonito salad, and some four or five of the handpicked special nigris. The fish in this place is out-of-this-world - or rather, I guess, from those very places in this world where they are indeed the best. Being from Norway, and spoiled silly with great salmon, the Scottish variety they serve at Macku still is far ahead of even the best of what we get. The chef then works wonders with it, combining it with all sorts of discreet toppings at least I had never thought of, making a sushi unlike any other sushis, and tasting, for lack of appropriate vocabulary, divine. The taste is best described as mild, yet opening up new tastebuds synapses connections. It's really just something else entirely, and positively so.  And these were just the specials on the menu! We had room for more, and asked the friendly, knowledgeable and interested chef to improvise a couple more nigris, and went through that roof we had just thought we'd hit. Beer battered, sea urchin topped pacific oysters? The world's best scallops sprinkled with sea salt shaven off the rocks of this same Japanese island I cannot for this review recall the name of? Toro - that delicious fatty part of the blue fin tuna that has your mouth shout for more, even though your stomach says no no no? Oh, heaven! I've been to some fancy fish places, but this one really places them all in another league. And is it look-down-your-nose fancy? Not at all. Classy, for sure, but friendly like your favourite neighbour. Discreet, but present and considerate service, nothing but happy and interested faces even when our son played all over the floor with his cars, and happy laughs at his certainly weird desire for wasabi, of which he even got another helping just for himself after having devoured ours.

Both were very heavily battered and the fish was completely lost in the sauce. To make matters worse, the chocolate miso served with the cod was too sweet, too thick, and completely overpowered everything. I don't think I tasted the fish in my dish at all. Decor is modern and simple; perfect for a sushi joint. The reason why I'm still giving this place 4 stars is because I'll be back for the sashimi/sushi only.

I've been two times now, and both have been outstanding experiences.  We've stuck mostly with the signature Sashimi and Nigiri, which I think is the way to go.  I had previously been a little bit weary of sashimi because the first time I tried it, it reminded me too much of the texture of a tongue.  This, however, was a totally different experience.  Try the Himachi signature sashimi, the fish is so fresh and flavorful and the sauce was so delicious that we scraped it of the plate. Really, every dish brings up a new discovery about texture and taste.  Really interesting combinations that I've never seen.  We also had a couple great macki and hand rolls (these aren't as innovative but still delicious and a more filling addition to the meal).  Tried the little fried crabs- these were a new experience, and not bad, but I have to admit that all the little legs creeped me out a bit (I have a thing about little legs).  One thing I do wish is that they would print out the specials, I can never follow the detailed descriptions of the many special choices.

I cringe at the site of ""California Rolls,"" and have been to many places around Chicago, so the fact that Macku is my second favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago speaks volumes! Decor: Cute and minimalist. I like the clean lines. Some people like really dark places, I personally, like light, vibrant places with clean lines. I really like to look at my food before it enters my mouth. This places is perfect for that. (I get the whole dark ambiance thing, but I can't help but thinking I'm probably putting a piece of gray tuna in my mouth because I can't see it) Food: Ridiculously good! We started off with the Spicy Tuna Tartar special which was a nice 2-person portion. The Tuna Tartar itself was pretty standard with some nice heat. The expected avocado encased the tuna but they added a twist--spring rolls. The spring rolls were pretty tasty. They were pretty much crab rangoons in a spring roll form with thin spring roll wrapper.  We followed that with the Fried River Crabs -- OMG! If you've ever walked into Japanese markets like Matsuya in Rolling Meadows, you've probably seen these morsels of goodness in the snack aisle, but these are prepared fresh. I definitely recommend that everyone tries these. There's nothing better than sweet, salty, spicy! For our mains, we tried a couple signature sashimi and nigiri. This is how you win a girl's heart! These were absolutely amazing. I could eat this everyday and be the happiest girl in the world. We tried the Hamachi and Mebachi Sashimi Signatures and the Hirame and Nama Sake Nigiri's. All had great flavors and textures.  We sampled a couple rolls: the Pink and the Dragon. Both were very good. The Dragon Roll was one of the best that I've had even though I don't order this particular roll very often. But I guess the stand out of this roll is that the avocado was sweet and buttery. The eel was cooked perfectly and didn't have any rancid fatty taste and the unagi sauce wasn't your ""traditional"" thick, gunky, Hershey's chocolate syrup-looking sauce. The sashimi was quality here. I tried the Super White Tuna, Botan Ebi, and Unagi. I was really craving Uni but it was 86'd by the time I got there. BUMMER! ""NO SOY RECOMMENDED!"" This is what you hear when you go to quality places. I can't stand looking over and people drenching their fish in soy. I like tasting the different mineral qualities of my pieces--thanks! The server and food runners do a good job of explaining how certain dishes should be eaten and always would tell us if soy was recommended, which it often wasn't because most of the pieces came seasoned to perfection! The cherry on top is that they house brew their soy, which is a low-sodium soy. You can most-definitely taste the difference between this soy and Kikoman! There is just tons of umami that jumps onto your tongue from this soy. I would suggest they start selling bottles of this stuff to make extra money because this is some superb soy sauce. (I never thought I would go on and on about soy sauce...geesh!) In addition, the rice at Macku is superb! It actually feels light and doesn't make you feel guilty about downing all those carbs. Too often, I go to sushi places around Chicago and the sushi rice is, too cold, to hard, too soft, too smushy, lacking flavor, or by some sort of perfect storm all the above. The rice here is perfect. I would say Mirai-perfect, but then again, I'm pretty sure Macku once made my perfect sashimi and nigiri at Mirai. Service: Okay, this is the reason why Macku gets a 4 star instead of 5, but I am willing to modify my review in the future if I go back and the service is picked up a little).  The server recommended some great dishes but the intonation in her voice did have very much confidence. I'm not sure if she was new on the job, but hanging around many in the industry, I have experienced servers that seemed more knowledgeable about the food they serve, even if they BS-ed everything.  May be it was nervousness. I docked half a star for this. The other half star they were docked was because after finishing my drink, the server didn't ask if we needed another round until we were almost finished with our meals. At this time, I think it was too late for another drink. Overall a great experience. I will be going back VERY OFTEN. I wish they would deliver their signature pieces that seem to be missing from their delivery menu. (I get it, it won't be as pretty at home, but dammit I want it at home!)

2010-05-17,3.0,"Wanted to really like this place - beautiful room, excellent service, slightly imaginative nigiri and even a slight ikazaya slant. While prices were high, they were acceptable. The imaginative nigri just wasn't that tasty - I'm ok with non-traditional, but it just felt like they were piling on random flavors on top of each slab of fish. I've had much better.  They do serve some amazing soup and I had hoped that they would have a stronger izakaya menu. Not so much. I'd recommend they downplay the raw fish and silly maki, maybe Chicago patrons are ready for a japanese restaurant that doesn't serve maki.",0.9889,0.681,0.319,0.0,0.5437179487179488
2010-05-11,5.0,"I haven't written a Yelp review in three months, but Macku Sushi pulled me out of retirement. I visited Macku with a friend about three weeks ago and since then, I have been back four times. I legitimately think this is one of the best sushi restaurants in the city.  Macku is an unassuming storefront restaurant near the intersection of Clybourn & Webster by the Webster Place Theater and Pequod's pizza.  I'm not going to get into aesthetics, because as much as good decor matters, I'd go back to Macku again and again even if it was a fly-infested dump. Three words: WHITE TUNA SASHIMI I can guarantee even maki-only sushi eaters will fall in love with this fish.  I've had super white and white tuna other places, but the quality of the fish here is unmatched. It's fresh, not fishy, mild and buttery. The white tuna literally melts in your mouth. Plus, for only $6 you can get six large pieces of sashimi, which in my book, for this kind of quality, is very affordable.  As if the white tuna sashimi wasn't enough, we also ordered the shiro maguro, which is white tuna nigiri with a banana wasabi puree. The chef, carefully arranges the sushi on a bed of sticky rice, squirts a dollopy line of the banana wasabi puree on top and then blowtorches the top for a carmelized, smoky flavor that brings out its fruitiness. It's amazing. I fell in love. I am in love! Here's the thing...it gets better.  Try the caterpillar maki. It's freshwater eel, crispy shrimp, roe, topped with avocado, sesame seeds, and an unagi sauce that will have you licking the plate. Seriously, I LICKED THE PLATE! The night I was there they also had a tuna tartar appetizer on special. I strongly suggest going with any specials that sound good to you on the night you go in to dine. Usually, specials feature the freshest fish they have that day and its hard to go wrong, even if that particular type of fish is out of your comfort zone.  Normally, I am not a fan of mackerel. I find it fishy and much too oily. I tried the saba, which is mackerel, fresh basil (basil??? I know!), sesame seeds and a spicy ginger sauce. The freshness of the basil and the kick of the ginger really tempered the greasiness of the fish and I learned to love mackerel in a whole new way.  When you go, you'll be tempted to find a cozy table in the back...the decor is very romantic with low lighting and modern tables, but I urge you to try sitting at the bar. Yes, it's a bit cozy up there and you are sharing space with other diners, but watching the chefs put on their show is worth it!  I asked a lot of questions about the fish that was lined up inside the window shelf on the bar. Had no idea what sea bream was or amber jack. The chef even let me taste and gave me a rundown of what its good paired with.  I have never tried an entree at Macku, always just sushi, but the entrees look delicious. I have my eye on the panko black cod with bok choy and chocolate miso.  Don't be afraid to try dessert. I had a chocolate pear green tea tarte that wasn't very memorable, but the menu is inventive and exciting.  White asparagus mousse! If you are at all enamored by food, you will appreciate the creativity.  Be sure to make a reservation when you go. The place is small and fills up quickly. I've never had a problem getting a table at the time I want, even when calling the same day.  Macku is a rare find in a city overrun with sushi joints. It combines amazing quality, gastronomic ingenuity, affordability and a great atmosphere all in one.  Don't go back to Coast. Don't head to Mirai. Skip the line at Toro. Make a reservation at Macku.

The Sweet Potato Soup is a definite must-try if you're a sweet potato lover - first level is the sweetness of the sweet potato, and ends with a luring fresh lobster. The Maguro (seared tuna) could have been a bit better, but I was very impressed by these dishes.  The sushi is the big disappointment. For a restaurant where 75% of their two-page menu is Sushi, I expected much more. The fish was indeed very fresh, but the technique and quality of the rolls were definitely not up to par. The sushi was not rolled tightly, and was cut sloppily. We ordered 5 different rolls, but was not impressed by the quality, taste, or uniqueness. The last thing that contributed to costing Macku 2 stars is the extremely slow service. We were there on a week night, but it took a very long time for each course to be served. =(",0.9766,0.763,0.199,0.038,0.6094708994708995

2010-04-01,5.0,"Outstanding! This place just took sushi to a new level. We went because my friend had given me a gift card and highly recommended it.  We started off with the toro tartare. It's not on the menu, but a special that they seem to offer every night. It was a nice way to start a meal that only got better. Anything that's crispy and creamy is genius in my mind.  Then we had the ankimo (monkfish liver) topped with tempura shrimp and pear puree. Wow. I highly recommend this dish. We got the white asparagus soup and were still talking about how good it was 3 hours after our meal. It's on the pricier side ($12), but worth it. They place a kimchi/pork gyoza in a bowl and slowly pour asparagus/crab puree on top.  They were out of the hirame signature nigiri, so we tried the madai and nama sake. The freshness of the fish rivaled with SF's.  We ordered the salmon spider and a spicy scallop hand roll. The salmon spider was simple, yet very good. Don't bother ordering the spicy scallop hand roll. I've had better and could probably make better. Then the otoro~ O M G. Only a few sushi places carry otoro on occasion so definitely get a piece. $8 of heaven If you're contemplating whether or not to get dessert like we were, just go for it and order the sesame flan. We were blown away by the presentation. They topped the creamy flan with spun sugar. Were we on Top Chef? The dessert was Padma and Tom Collichio worthy.

2010-03-31,4.0,"Being a California native, I'm always hoping to find good quality sushi in Chicago, but thus far I've been pretty skeptical. I'd heard some good reviews about Kaze and so when a friend and I decided to take advantage of this unusually balmy March evening and try another sushi place, we opted for Macku. My friend and I came around 8 pm without reservations and were immediately seated at the bar. The server came around and informed us of the specials, and brought us water without ice. That in itself deserves a star.  We ordered the toro tartare, a special of the night. The dish came out with a disk of toro tartare surrounded by slices of avocado, two shrimp spring rolls, and various garnishes around the dish (masago, truffle oil, I forget the specifics). It was yummy, although the shrimp flavor overwhelmed the toro a bit, so next time I'll opt for toro nigiri instead.  Our next dish was the Mebashi (big eye tuna, pickled onions, burdock root, chives, truffle oil, soy), which was melt-in-your mouth delicious. We also ordered the rainbow and hamachi ebi tempura rolls. Ordering the rainbow roll is always my strategy for filling up while being able to try different kinds of fish. The fish here is really much better than any fish I've had in Chicago thus far, which is definitely a plus in my book. We really enjoyed watching the sushi chefs prepare the food--it was obvious that they were really skilled at what they were doing. One of the chefs even paused to ask us if everything was okay, which was really nice (I think he was probably the owner--I saw him later introduce himself to people sitting at another table). We ended the night with the sesame flan, which, in addition to being visually delightful, was really unique and flavorful. I'm a big fan of flans and custards and this dessert dish did not disappoint.  On our way out, we were thanked by the chefs and the hostess, which, in my experience, is rare outside of Japan, and definitely left me in a good mood.

2010-03-31,4.0,"I'll admit, I never went to Kaze sushi in Roscoe Village though I had heard of it before closing. Lucky for me the family business didn't end, it just moved. This time the brother of Kaze has the name on the door, Macku Sushi. I knew this wasn't your ordinary local sushi joint, but I was presently surprised with the menu offerings and execution of this upscale Japanese establishment. Ironically enough of all the different plates Erica, Alyssa and I tried, the sushi was the least impressive. Everything else from the soup to the dessert was very tasty and noteworthy for the presentation and overall quality. I might go back for some special sushi, but more likely return to try the entrees I missed this time around. Whatever you choose though Macku is no secret, and the limited tables could make getting a reservation tricky. I wasn't the only person who wanted to see what the other half of that family could produce. As for what we ate, we started with my favorite Japanese starter, gomae. This wasn't any ordinary gomae, as it was served with a fried banana and sweet potato crisps. While I prefer my gomae simple and served chilled with sesame peanut sauce, I do take some blame for not reading the menu closer and reading the fine print. It's not what I expected, but I appreciate the varying textures and combination of flavors from the spinach, sweet bananas and crispy sweet potatoes. The presentation, like everything else served, caught my attention. Our server also informed us of the specials that evening, including an asparagus puree soup that sounded too good to pass up. I am glad we didn't, as the soup was by far Erica's favorite dish of the night, and it could have been mine as well. As with everything else, the presentation was top notch with flavors to match. Who would imagine consuming white asparagus soup with foie gras and a raspberry reduction in a Japanese restaurant? It doesn't stop there. Alyssa was craving agedashi tofu, but it wasn't offered on the menu. Lucky for us they could accommodate our needs and presented us a large square of tofu with garnishes and some ridiculous sauce. Erica doesn't love tofu so Alyssa and I did the damage, and we did it quickly. After all of this, we did order sushi too. In retrospect we probably ordered maki rolls that do a poor job of highlighting the talents of the sushi chefs working hard in front of us at the bar.We went with the classics: spicy tuna, hamachi and spider salmon. The fish was fresh, but the rolls were lacking in flavor and served with too much rice. Next time I will stick with either sashimi or maki rolls that are more creative, such as the one that requires the blow torch. Just to make sure we turned over every stone, we ordered the dessert platter, featuring fresh fruit, mochi and green tea ice cream. I'm not sure who's idea that was, but we sent back a clean plate. The mango, apple and oranges were all cut in unique designs, and the chocolate mochi and green tea ice cream hit the spot at the end of the meal. This was just another example of the high class presentation and food quality served in a quaint neighborhood Japanese restaurant. Even though we didn't order sake (not sure how we missed that), the total bill for our 3 starters, 3 rolls and dessert came in around $60. That qualifies as good value in my book, especially for what you receive. I enjoyed Macku for the different perspective on Japanese food that is usually forgotten between sunday night cheap sushi BYOs. I would return, and recommend, to Macku to explore the rest of the raw fish offerings, as well as the other entrees (Cod, Venison, Duck or tempura). This city could use upscale ""sushi + more"" places, I'm just glad one is close to me.",0.9961,0.802,0.141,0.057,0.5339334045584047
2010-03-28,4.0,"Wow. I absolutely love the decor. When i walked in it was much smaller than i expected. It was 6:00pm on a wednesday and only 4 tables were occupied. But it turns out all the other tables were reserved for 7:00pm so we couldn't get one.  There were two seats left at the sushi bar so we took them. When going to a sushi restaurant i always look for interesting signature maki but none of theirs appealed to me, but the entrees look pretty unique. Our waitress was very nice and helpful in explaining the specials. I loved how she explained the dish and followed it with the cost of it. I've always hated it when I ordered a special and then find out later on my bill that it costs way more than what I expected. We ended up ordering 2 entrees, 1 roll, and 1 dessert. Food: Cod $15 - The sauce on the black cod was very interesting and a little sweet. I liked it! The sliced strawberries on fish gave it an unusual taste, not bad but I could do without it. My waitress suggested I alternate taking bites of the cod and baby bok choy. It was nice because the sauce on the fish was sweet and bok choy sort of became a palate cleanser. Rack of lamb $15 - this was special, if its available get it! There were two thick pieces of lamb, it was simple and good. But what I really loved were the sides that came with it. There was a baby eggplant covered with chives, soooo good. Then there's the red apple onion salad that was covered with sesame seeds. It was amazing! I tried to request if I could have an additional side dish of it but was denied and was told that it is a ""garnish"". Bummer! There was also 3 thinly sliced avocados on the plate too, I love avocados, but it seemed to do nothing for the dish. Hamachi Ebi Tempura Roll $8- I found this dish to be quite bland. Since I sat right at the sushi bar I saw all the rolls that were being made. Everything seemed so simple and uninteresting to me. I wanna know where and what the names of the rolls I saw on the website are! White Asparagus Panna Cotta $8 - I originally wasn't going to order dessert but when i saw the words ""white asparagus"" in a dessert I had to try. It tasted like regular panna cotta, could barely taste the asparagus. The pool of berry puree that was surrounding it was too tart for me, so I didn't eat too much of that. I enjoyed my entrees a lot. Definitely will go back especially for my apple onion ""garnish"" I will probably try a few appetizers next time and no rolls unless I can find out what the pictures on the website are!",0.9976,0.796,0.173,0.03,0.5283606330776143

Having said that, we were so wowed by the japanese curry sauce on the venison dish, that I can't not be a fan of this place.  The dishes are inventive, so try things from all parts of the menu.  They have a great list going from warm/cold appetizers, sushi, entree to dessert.",0.9774,0.791,0.162,0.047,0.6914285714285714

It was a completely unique experience and I will definitely go back. First, let me say that the meal was a fixed menu. It was 5 courses and cost $160.00 for a couple. I expected to pay more to be honest however it is still alot of money.  All of the courses were things I have never had in my life. Custards and Lobster and strawberries... man I felt like I had injected the essence of butter into my veins after that.  It was super super good though. The only complaints I have, and that keep me from giving it 5 stars is that when we left, we didn't feel satisfied with the amount of food. We literally went (sorry to say) to McD's and got some french fries to fill out the craving.  The other problem which kinda made me a little miffed was that we were there for 2 hours. Some people were getting courses before us who were seated after us. I think the problem was that since the cooks were making the same food, the waitresses were just grabbing things, regardless of who was to get them. Lastly, i was told when I made reservations that we had to use the fixed menu for valentines day. I was excited for sure but when we got there, people were ordering whatever they wanted. Now, they did ask if we wanted anything off the menu and we declined but I think it threw the chefs a little off because things were taking awhile. Anyways, the regular menu items looked awesome and way more filling and I even overheard a sushi snob say ""Come on? sashimi with sauces? this is B.S!"" only to love it when he got it. I highly suggest any of the sashimi. Its completely different then most sushi places because it is in a sauce. Believe me sushi snobs, it is awesome.",0.9751,0.845,0.111,0.044,0.5467395676219207

2010-02-16,4.0,"My recent dinner at Macku was a great experience, but definitely not flawless. We arrived five minutes early for our reservation and were seated promptly.  The restaurant is small with small tables along a wall (a bit like blackbird) and a sushi bar.  The interior is modern, but dimly lit and a bit romantic.  We were given a menu and our waitress recited a number of specials as well as an option for an omakase-style meal based on our food preferences and number courses we wanted.  We opted for the omakase.   I would recommend ordering a la carte, as the omakase features only on-menu items.  Also, our waitress said she would check up on us after every course to take into account our preferences and see how many more courses we would like, but she stopped by 2 or 3 times and had entered in a number of courses for us without even asking what we wanted.  She also forgot (or ignored) one of our preferences (served us anago when we asked for no eel).  However, given the fact that service was generally good and the good was great, this was not a huge complaint. The food was for the most part, delicious.  We started with a sweet carrot soup with king crab and a biscuit (similar to or the same as something you could find at a chinese supermarket).  It was well presented and quite tasty though a bit oversalted.  We were also served a number of sashimi plates: madai with a balsamic reduction, a yellowtail-like fish topped with monkfish foie gras and a slice of a baby orange, and bluefin topped with soy sauce, truffle oil, and other unkown ingredients (very good but a bit salty).  The one warm dish we were served were fried japanese river crabs (about 2.5 inches in size) to be dipped in japanese curry (very good but the batter was a bit salty).  We finished our savory courses with a sushi flight: anago, sake, bluefin, hamachi, and wagyu, each with toppings (our waitress misidentified a couple of these).  Of those, wagyu was definitely the highlight.  The sake and hamachi were also good but the bluefin and anago were unremarkable.  Our meal ended with desserts: white asparagus pudding and sesame flan, both of which I highly recommend. All in all, the meal was a great experience.  The food was great and the service was good.  However, nothing was without its flaws.  I would definitely return, but I would make sure I ordered a la carte this time.",0.9982,0.761,0.215,0.024,0.5207602339181286

The servers seem pretentious and management does not understand how to deal with their restaurant's mistakes.  When we arrived, there were 2 other tables (of two) and a couple of people at the bar. We ordered 2 entrees and a few rolls for an appetizer. After we finished out rolls, that's when it began, we waited...and waited...and waited for our entrees. Finally after about 40 minutes (mind you the restaurant was NOT busy at all during this time) our server came and told us that the chef was having issues with the sauce (some type of pineapple concoction) that went with my entrée and it would take about an extra 15 minutes to complete, is that ok? I said fine, no worries. Then about a 25 minutes later, our server came out again letting me know that the chef was having such issues with the sauce, that he doesn't feel comfortable serving it but can make an parsley butter sauce instead. I actually don't like parsley enough to have a sauce made of it so I asked if he could do some other type of sauce (at his discretion) that didn't include parsley, the server told me that the parsley butter sauce was his only suggestion. She then asked if I would like to order something else off the menu. I ordered something else and by this time, the place was busy so then we waited and waited again. During this time, we should have just gotten the check & left. Our entrees came out (finally) and the server told us they would work ""something"" out with our bill. I was thinking that they would at least comp my entrée for all the trouble and wait time, but no, they ended up giving me a 15% discount which was about $8 (the entrée was $15). When we left we told the woman at the front (who authorized the discount) that 15% was an insult for the time we waited for our food and she said that we should have said something earlier & they could have changed it, but my question is why couldn't they just do that in the first place to keep their customers happy & coming back for more?

Bison appetizer, delicious, tender, and made with perfection.  I don't think i've ever had meat this tender.  We also had the japanese river crabs with a curry sauce that was absolutely delicious!  And this was all only the beginning.   Next we had some soups, I had the white asparagus soup - i think everyone in chicago should try this soup.  it is unbelievable.  My friends had the sweet potato soup and the carrot soup, and though I didn't have theirs (because then I would have had to share mine) they were extremely happy with their soups too.   My friends and I are huge sushi fans, so obviously we had to have sushi for the rest of our meal.  We were just going to get all sashimi and nigiri, but we were intrigued by their signature nigiri and signature sashimi plates.  Since they were 'signature' dishes, we gave it a shot.  And i don't think I'll ever see sushi the same way again.   We started off with the madai sashimi - i think there was a balsmaic reduction with pine nuts.  Un-freaking believable.  It melts in your mouth and then you just want more.  we also had the hamachi sashimi with beets.  Equally as mind blowing.  The chefs know their stuff without a doubt.   Then we tried some signature nigiri pieces with toppings.  We each got five pieces.  I had the Salmon, White tuna, flounder, Unagi, and the baby squid, all with different toppings that accented the taste of the fish.  Every single bite was absolutely amazing.  I have no words, everyone must go and have a taste of this stuff.  Make reservations though, they are kind of small.  We went on a Monday night and still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.   We ended the night with macku's asparagus.  It's a dessert.  we had to try a dessert that has asparagus in it, i mean, who has the tenacity to actually put asparagus in a dessert.   but holy crap, if asparagus was ever this good when i was a kid, i wouldn't have fed them all to my dog.  Macku gave us one of our best dining experiences in a longgg time.  Service was friendly, the wait staff was knowledgable and every dish came out as beautifully as it tasted.",0.9928,0.856,0.122,0.022,0.5668188293188293

Then a few short weeks after my visit, Kaze closed and once again I came back to realization that I would have to wait once again to go to LA to get my fresh sashimi and amazing dishes.  Wrong. Hella wrong.  Macku brings it back. The chefs, the dishes all with a slightly more upscale decor.  I will say this, I think you need to go the way of the Chef's tasting. The surprise will keep you wanting to come back for more and more. I wasn't that hungry, (I know, I was shocked too), so my friend and I did a little smattering of tastiness.  First off was soup, I with my carrot miso blend, with Alaskan lump crab on the bottom a simple stand of chive and a rice cracker to dunk with, was as great as I had remember it. Oh my the flavor with just a hint of spice and delicate balance of earthiness and savory. Then off to my river crab, small but of course enough to throw a few people off their game. They are flash fried, but are whole soft shell crabs, so you eat them whole. Holy wonderfulness Batman, as tasty as they are fun to eat.  Then the toro tuna tartar with spring rolls. Still really really good, a little oily with the spring roll, (at least mine was), but really it was a lovely combo of avocado and tuna and heaven. Then came the big eyed tuna sashimi. Lean back, lean back and while you throw that rock away I can eat your portion. Loved it. The flavors were well blended and the tuna was melt in your mouth heaven. Then dessert came. I am what you may call a purist. If I am doing dessert I love a cup of caramel, a mountain of chocolate, a stream of delicate vanilla.  But of course we went with the black sesame flan.  And gosh darn it, it was pretty and tasty. Not in the ""I am going in to a diabetic coma"" tasty, but a subtle and gentle way to end the evening. I do, (and this is rare), wish our server came by at least a little more frequently, like maybe one or two more times, to check on us, but really this is minor because he did offer some some great suggestions and ideas and was there when he needed to be there. The price is not bad, but certainly I like the element of surprise so when I come back and I have some starving in my belly, the Chef's tasting it will be. Until then, I look forward to having this location stay for a long time.",0.9979,0.797,0.168,0.035,0.4351441985244802
2010-01-18,5.0,"Calling all fans of Kaze Sushi! Calling all fans of Kaze Sushi!  Fret no more my pets, while the doors of our beloved Kaze may be closed forever, the phenomenal stylings of the brothers Chan - you know, the boys behind such favorites as Kaze, Mirai and Heat - are back in full attack with the newly opened and quite stylish Lincoln Park digs of Macku.  Boasting almost the identical menu as our adored Kaze, the caliber of fare is still as unwavering, inventive and tasty as ever. While a Kaze enthusiast is naturally guaranteed to be in absolute bliss here, it doesn't take a familiarity of wunderkind Chef Macku to appreciate the level of craftsmanship and ingenuity behind his dishes. Items like velvety sweet potato soup with lobster, monkfish, foie gras and a sweet prawn in addition to the delectable 'unagi don', freshwater eel served with balsamic reduction and creamy avocado and tomato puree are just the tip of the iceberg in a long list of fabulous entrées, speciality nigiri, delightful makimono and righteous desserts.  The new modern and lovely digs of Macku - albeit a bit small - are far more suited to the sophisticated palate of the Chan provisions than Kaze ever was. Great for a special occasion, date night or just feeling sexy... the low lighting, chrome and glass finishes and flickering candlelight take this sushi star from utilitarian to positively urbane.  Reservations, of course, are a must as is the kani, truffle and sea urchin nigiri with a helping hand of hamachi ebi tempura: yellowtail, shrimp tempura, avocado, cilantro, jalapeños and masago. Oy. Domo arigato and then some, I'm glad being mad for Macku!",0.9949,0.76,0.207,0.033,0.6538173947264859
2010-01-18,4.0,"If I had one type of cuisine to eat for the rest of my life, it would have to be Japanese. I am a bit of a traditionalist and prefer fresh sashimi, hand rolls and izakaya fare, but Macku's combination of traditional + inventive menu was an absolute treat.   The decor of Macku is simple, watery and clean. The dim lights, cool music and comfortable seating make it ideal for a sexy date night. The tables are little too close together though, and we could hear our neighbor's whole conversation during dinner! I couldn't stop staring at the amazing orchids on the sushi bar... they were beautiful.  We started with the soup. I had the traditional udon, one of my favorite dishes for a cold winter night. It had a generous amount of Japanese seven spice that gave it a nice kick. I loved the tempura and mushrooms in the hot broth.  Next up were the river crabs in peanut sauce. It took a while to get used to, but then I couldn't stop eating the little popcorn like crabs! We also had the toro tartare, a diced toro wrapped in avocado, served with shrimp and cheese spring roll. Now I'm the girl who always says cream cheese in a Japanese restaurant is totally wrong. But I liked it. A lot. Finally, we had the fatty tuna sashimi... this was the clear winner of our dinner. The tuna melted on the tongue, while the toppings created a spicy and fragrant aroma in my mouth. It was perfection! We ended our dinner with the black sesame flan. LOVED it!  I will definitely back!",0.9983,0.696,0.29,0.014,0.6345238095238096

2010-01-12,5.0,"I've lived in Tokyo so trust me on this one.  I rarely give 5 stars to anything but here is why I gave it to Macku:   Fresh and flavorful fish (high quality!) Portions are good size and I like the simple presentation Ambience is soothing yet hip and they have nice music but not too loud Interesting menu with lots of choices for non-sushi eaters Overall I really thought this was great value (you get what you pay for) and the experience was relaxing.  I wouldn't eat here all the time but if you are going to pay a few more dollars for very high quality and interesting fish options, choose Macku.  I had amberjack for the first time and enjoyed it. The space is small and they take reservations...in fact, they encourage it.  Let them know if you plan to see a movie at webster because they will squeeze you in if they know you are departing and freeing up the space.   Itedakimas!",0.9934,0.714,0.255,0.031,0.5212486772486772
2010-01-11,5.0,"Needless to say, I completely agree with all the other reviewers:  5 stars!  The hubs and I were so excited to see a sushi place coming into the place (as we live very close and don't really like Tsuki) and we were doubly excited when we found out it was going to be the chefs from Kaze.  Unfortunately, we never had the chance to go there, but we had always wanted to try it.  Anyway, we went for the chef's tasting, because we were celebrating that evening and it seemed like a good way to go per the waiter's recommendation.  I've never done a tasting quite like this before, but at Macku you sort of name your price and let them know if you just want food or if you want pairings as well, and then you just sit back and relax while the chef brings you course after course of yummy-ness until you hit your preset price.  It was a lot of fun, we didn't know what was coming next, but everything was delightful and the progression of courses flawless.  Of course, they have a standard menu of rolls, sashimi and nigiri as well if you just want to go that route.  We sampled several different kinds of sashimi, a wonderful white asparagus soup, a lightly battered and fried white fish, a spring-roll-like item with an avocado and tuna tartar (omg, this was to die for), a nigiri flight, and to finish things off green tea mousse (a nice, light and sweet ending).  Service was impeccable, all of our dishes came out with well presented descriptions and we were never in need of anything.",0.9918,0.763,0.186,0.051,0.5101851851851852
2010-01-08,5.0,"Had dinner last night at Macku and it was delightful. The food, service, and overall experience were reminiscent of Kaze (their former restaurant in Roscoe Village), but definitely taken up a notch. We started with the Udon soup and tempura.  The udon soup seemed the perfect way to start the meal on a cold, snowy January evening...hot and spicy!  The spiciness of the soup definitely characterizes Chef Macku's style, bold, daring, and complex. The udon broth seemed to have much more complexity that I'm accustomed to from the typical American ramen-ya restaurant, you could actually pick out the green onions, vegetables, and herbs that had been used to construct the broth. The tempura was simply exceptional, it was prepared with madai fish lightly breaded and then fried. The tempura was then served on a plate covered with parsley puree and red chili oil. It was a unique mixture and a far departure from the typically bland tempura sauce I'm accustomed to. Topped with inari mushrooms and cream and with a spoonful of sauce, it was a sensational first course.  I was initially shocked to see the spoonful of cream on the madai tempura, but thought it was a thoughtful contrast to the spiciness of the chili oil.  Our next course was the kampachi sashimi plate, which consisted of kampachi in spicy soy sauce and topped with tiny slices of jalapeno. I really enjoyed this dish. The kampachi sashimi pieces were much larger than typical sashimi and had been lightly cooked with a blowtorch to bring out some of the oils in the fish. It was a dish that relied less on creative inspiration and more on skill. Also, the jalapeno was small enough, that it never interfered with the kampachi flavors.  We then moved to the chef special nigiri, which came highly recommended by our server.  The first was the salmon topped with crushed inari mushrooms and truffle oil.  The salmon seemed to be fresh and of a high grade, but I thought the truffle oil was too much; it overpowered the subtle, buttery quality of the salmon instead of complimenting it.  Next we had the hamachi topped with wasabi banana pepper paste.  This was one of my favorites.  The hamachi was flavor was wonderful and the mildly spicy paste provided a simple, yet inspiringly unique perspective on nigiri sushi. This seemed like it could make for an excellent maki roll, but I feel like the absence of the nori here was definitely not a minus.  We finished our meal off with some nigiri: madai, uni, whitefish, and a spicy tuna roll. By the way, the rolls are very reasonably priced, our spicy tuna roll was $5 for 6 pieces.   Overall, we had a delightful dinner. Our server was very friendly and offered some great recommendations. I found the food quality to be exceptional, and the dishes seemed very well designed exuding with creative inspiration. I will definitely be heading back to Macku soon, and p.s. you might be able to snag a gift cert on  restaurant.com .",0.9989,0.787,0.202,0.012,0.5168787202380952
2010-01-05,5.0,"If you've watched shows like Top Chef, the judges are always talking about having a ""style"" or an ""identity."" I really didn't know what that meant, but I do now. Every dish I try at Macku has character. I don't know if it's the ingredient palette (several dishes have traces of pickled onion, truffle oil, or a touch of garlic),  the textures (think lots of silky purees) or the flavors (hints of sweet within the savory, spice and smokiness). In every dish, you taste a central theme or identity. The dishes don't taste the same, but you can definitely tell there is an unified intention, a clear vision. I find that powerful and in the case of Macku, I find it incredibly tasty. Macku in a class by itself. There's a care and attention that their chefs give to each plate, even down to each individual piece of sushi. I had: Carrot Soup, Tempura Appetizer w/ parsley butter beure blanc, Tuna, Yellowtail and Salmon special Nigiri, Caterpillar Roll and Beef Tenderloin.",0.9838,0.817,0.175,0.007,0.4437423687423688
2010-01-01,5.0,"I went to Macku on opening night, New Years Eve 2009.  The place is beautiful - it has that peaceful, restrained, zen ambiance that so many sushi places try for and miss. The servers know their stuff and explain it well.  Like at Kaze (the predecessor to Macku, which closed recently), they urge you to try the Signature Nigiri.  Perhaps it's my honky tendency toward quantity that prevents me from ordering these tiny morsels, but I just can't bring myself to pay $7 for one piece of fish, no matter how creative the toppings. Here are the items I've tried, all of which I'd highly recommend: * Sweet potato soup - rich and spicy * Cod - perfectly cooked fish with a warm, thick, chocolaty sauce and strawberries on top - but it's savory, not too sweet * Toro tartare special - wonderful tuna tartare accompanied by two fried rolls filled with cream cheese and shrimp I'll definitely be back, and it'll be hard to branch out from these three favorite dishes.  Maybe I'll make it a New Year's resolution to order a Chef's Choice one night and put it in the hands of Macku's capable cooks to create the perfect dinner for me.",0.9948,0.692,0.265,0.044,0.613487445887446
