Called to ask why the receipt was so expensive on delivery (medium pizza no toppings, soft drink, and mozzarella sticks $37 before tip?!) and got a lot of BS from the owner about ""competitors"" putting false prices on Yelp and how they can't get Yelp to change it.  Do you really think we're that stupid? Suggest corrections is right there on the Yelp menu with a link to log in for priority corrections as a business owner. ""Mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini"" $5 on the Yelp menu is actually $6.50 + $6.50 (two separate items) so it rings up as $13 instead of the $5 you thought you ordered. Pizza is $17.50 instead of $14. ""i'm very sorry, I'm deeply sorry"" if you're so sorry than comp the bill so we pay for what we thought we ordered, not waffle your way through excuses and BS and nonsense about how you're going to get your ""attorney"" to call Yelp in the morning.

2017-05-13,1.0,"I've lived down the street from this establishment for nearly 2 years. At one point I called the meatball sandwich, fries and soda ""hands down the best deal in town.""  Fast forward to about October or November, the great meatball sandwich I would sometimes get twice a week went from 3 meatballs down to 2. At first I thought this was strange but time after time, only 2 meatballs. Could I really complain, after all, it was still $7.25 with tax. Even though I felt I was being cheated, the sandwich was still a good one.  Tonight, after working a 12 hour day and not really having a chance to eat dinner, I let the time get past 11pm and I didn't have many choices. ""I'll try the meatball sandwich again"" I said to myself. What did I get? 2 meatballs, with a nice space in the middle of my sandwich, however, this time I was charged $8.34. Why in the last 4 or 5 months did I lose a meatball and pay $1 and some change more? I'm all about loyalty and I've been a loyal customer here as well as many of the neighborhood places that have good food, give you good service and treat you fairly. Pat's is friendly, has good food, however, I no longer feel treated fairly. I may get a thin crust pizza from here still from time to time, but to me, it's no longer good for anything else. To me anyway. It's no longer the ""Best Deal in Town"" and with the quality, won't ever be again.  Update 5/13/17 Went in there tonight at 11:35pm. Everyone was still working. Saw a half a dozen people in there. 3 of them looked at me. The guy that normally takes the orders was standing off to the side on his cell phone. I waited for a good minute or two and then bounced.

It is a little pricey but that is because it 100% worth it.  I found my new go to pizza place and could not recommend this place enough.",0.7145,0.863,0.096,0.042,0.540206228956229

This is the staple of a walk up counter pizza joint. They do not have slices, but no worries, they are usually quick. I typically don't even call ahead, but just stop in and order. 25 mins later, my large pizza is ready to take home (have been in here during lunch and it's even quicker with their individual pies). There is very minimal seating; more or less counter space to grab their special on your lunch break. The owner is extremely friendly and accommodating. I've only had their thin crust pepperoni and sausage, but I'm afraid to try anything else, because I enjoy it so much. The crush is thin and crispy with a great balance of savory sauce, toppings, and cheese. Most importantly, the flavors just work together. I have no complaints or critiques.

Good stuff for a hungry dinner/late night situation Con: A little bit pricey though in my opinion, $23 for large 2 topping, and the 1 topping wasn't that much cheaper like $20-$21 if I remember correctly, and it doesnt stop there, the Medium or one size down at 14 was only a few dollars cheaper at like $19-$20.

I didn't realize finding a ""regular"" pizza that wasn't deep dish or thin crust would have been so difficult, so I searched Yelp for places in the South Loop and just called around asking who had what I wanted until Pat's said yes. I knew I wanted a regular Papa John's-type pizza that wasn't Papa John's, but in hindsight this was my mistake and I should have just ordered from there and been totally satisfied. Instead I got a super thick pizza from Pat's... the sauce was about 3 times the necessary amount and there were gobs of cheese everywhere. It looked like a heart attack waiting to happen. The pepperoni was visibly on top of the pie, but the sausage was imbedded somewhere within, among the sauce and cheese ridiculousness. If that's your thing, great, but it's not mine and I was highly disappointed... especially for $28! Seriously, I almost choked when the lady over the phone gave me the cost for ONE pizza delivery which should have been my sign to hang up (again my fault) but I figured it must be good given the solid star ratings...

2013-06-08,2.0,"So this is cheap ""Italian food"" at a price way too high. I put Italian in quotes because the menu is so extensive, everything from thin crust pizza to BBQ and steak. Any time you see a menu with this much stuff and this much range, you know you are in for some trouble. One wonders just how often they sell the 19 dollar Shrimp Dinner. Yes, the prices are way too high for a place like this. They sell a side of toasted bread and butter for $2.75, basic tortellini is 13 dollars! You could easily buy 3 or 4 bags of better quality tortellini from Trader Joes for that price. The pizza is spendy as well, unless you get a plain cheese. I had sworn this place off after going twice last summer, its only a 2 minute walk from where I live. But being in Chicago(downtown no less) there is plenty of great, more authentic, Italian food nearby, that actually is less expensive. Panozzo's Italian Market has real Italian food(no pizza, but hey who needs pizza), its actually less expensive too. It's maybe 12 blocks away, but it's worth it. Anyway, for my most recent and hopefully final visit I was dragged here by some friends who wanted pizza for a friends' birthday. Not eager to spend double digits on an average pizza, I decided to go for an Italian eatery staple, an Eggplant Parmesan sandwich. At 7.25 it was NOT worth it, soggy, no flavorful sauce, very little cheese, soggy eggplant that wasn't really seasoned. I ordered a cannoli and got carrot cake instead, which wasn't too bad, but I ordered a cannoli and last time I checked, cannoli and carrot cake don't sound much alike. Bottom line: Not worth it, walk a little more and find Italian food that is better and lighter on the wallet.",0.9847,0.839,0.13,0.031,0.3559321175278621

I paid over $15 bucks for a relatively small, very thin crust pizza and only one topping.  I could see padding the price if there was some serious overhead but this is a carry-out/delivery only storefront.  Since this is a cracker type dough, you obviously use significantly less of every ingredient you top it with from the sauce, the cheese and the extra goodies.  I just don't see the justification of this high price tag especially since upon opening the box I was so disappointed. Sausage was scarce and so was the sauce, which ended up creating a very dry product.  I get the need for restraint when dealing with a cracker crust but this was down right stingy.  I knew I was only going to eat a couple of the pieces so I stole chunks of meat from other squares to beef up my slice.  That's kind of pathetic.  Glad I wasn't sharin.",-0.5895,0.86,0.068,0.072,0.6980390211640213

He was in fact VERY nice and apologetic and although he said they were slammed, didn't try to use that as an excuse for the cold food.

My coworkers and I go there all the time. When we have guests at the office, we order Pat's. The pizza? Not the greatest, by far. Cracker-thin crust that gets hard too quickly, all the cheese comes off, but it's good enough in a pinch. The other stuff, though, really nice. You'll get probably the best burger anywhere near Printers Row, and the prices are cheap. (I don't understand the ""$$""  in the description -- for six bucks you can get a really good cheeseburger and fries!) Sandwiches are very enjoyable, mozzarella sticks are excellent (which is very important to me!). I haven't really dealt with many of the staff -- about 75% of the time I deal with the son of the owner, and he's a really friendly guy. There's a woman there from time  to time, darned if I can remember her name, but she's also quite friendly. The only real complaint I have about this place is that the fries leave much to be desired -- but a little bit of salt is a big help. Well, that, and the drink selection is odd -- either a can, a one-liter bottle, or a two-liter bottle -- I prefer the 20-ounce bottle, myself...but that's just one guy's opinion.
