2017-09-01,3.0,"A weekday visit seemed in order as I had the day off. So instead of opting for our favorite place, we decided to try Bongo room, as there was no line and it's been a while since we had the most delicious pancakes with a lemon mascarpone cream that was so memorable! Our server sat us and within 1 minute came back and asked if we knew what we wanted. Uh, no. Maybe coffee first?  Sadly, there was no special pancake offered on the weekdays, so we went with the blackberry and Meyer lemon pancakes and a breakfast burrito.  Both were forgettable. I noted to my dining buddy, the croissant sandwich had one egg..one egg? He said I could add another, but if anyone has ever eaten a croissant, it is larger than an English muffin and those hold one egg.  So the pancakes were less than spectacular and the burrito was just all spinach tortilla and some tasty scrambled egg. Melting cheese on top seemed dumb and there is a size down from huge tortilla that could have held the fillings of this burrito prefecture.  We ate a 1/3 of the pancakes and just 1/2 of the burrito and regretted our choice of bongo room for brunch.  My only tip to those waiting in the huge line on the weekend, if you're going here and can convince your friends to do a coffee walk and find another place in the area for food, you will be grateful that you went to eat brunch at any other place.   Maybe do a traveling meal...coffee and a danish, then go find an egg dish at another place like Fairgrounds, then wander off to find some good sausage or bacon and a cocktail at Covey.",0.9538,0.849,0.104,0.047,0.5921579743008315

The wait here on a Sunday morning was about 35 minutes, they take your name and phone number and then text you when at able is ready which is really nice. The place is clean and the atmosphere is really cute. Our waitress was really nice, and even though the kitchen lost our orders initially apologized a thousand times and made sure we got everything correctly and as fast as possible.  I had the Chocolate French Toast Tower, which was good but I got bored w/ it pretty fast.

While the place was busy, they were effective in seating us and putting in our order when we were ready. I ordered the Smoked Mozzarella & Turkey Sausage Sandwich and a Black Raspberry and Grapefruit Mimosa. My boyfriend ordered the Banana Pancakes and an Espresso. When we tried each others food, we were delighted and decided to share. The sandwich was potent and delicious while the pancakes were refreshing and tasty. It was the perfect combination for us.

We told them we know what the 4th person wants and are going to order for them and they will be here in 5 minutes.They said no they cannot seat us because too many people in the past have lied and said they are going to order and then they don't. We said okay fine we will seat with just the three of us. (We again will just order for the 4th). The host again was like if we seat you 3 then no one else can seat with you! Um sorry what?? His attitude and the manner in which he said it was the biggest issue. After we ate and paid we asked to speak to the manager. She was no better saying we have just had this issue in the past so we don't allow it. We said honestly if that's your policy fine but you should really figure out how to say it without calling your patrons liars. She rudely responded with okay so what else are you looking for? I said nothing we have already paid we just felt the need to let you know the attitude from the host was not appropriate. Truly poor service.",-0.8885,0.835,0.059,0.106,0.525
2017-08-19,4.0,"Typically there's a wait but that's just evidence of the food quality.  The pancakes are just insane. You can get half an order or just one pancake.  Last time I couldn't decide and got two half orders. When I have a pancake this good I typically lose my mind once that sugar hits me. This time I evaluated the portion size before I had my first bite and was able to determine that half an order is really a full order other places. Will I just get one half order next time and be sensible? I don't have a crystal ball and may not be able to resist The white chocolate pretzel pancakes are heaven. To me they are closer to cinnamon roll pancakes but to be honest I don't really care what they call them. Get these.  On this visit I also had the Meyer lemon pancakes which were great too but get lost in the light cast by the white chocolate pretzel.  I've been here several times and each time thought the server could have been better. They lack a little enthusiasm and customer service acumen. This would bother me more but on each visit I was impressed by service and attitude of the bus person. Filling water, clearing dirty dishes with a smile.  Each time I asked the bus person about what the best new pancake was and I got answers far superior to anything I've gotten from the servers  The wait for a table is tolerable as you can just go next door to volumes book store/coffee shop and browse the well appointed selection.

2017-07-08,4.0,"The breakfast burrito was quite filling and tasty. I recommend doing what my husband and I did: split a savory item, since they are pretty generous portions, and then order one, two or three different pancakes. There are so many fun flavors of pancakes, and they sometimes have special or different ones, and they will allow you to order just one instead of a stack. The only bummer is that you have to order up front and it all comes at the same time, so you're trying to slam the first part of your brekkie to get to the sweet part, hoping it's not just a cold, sad, sweets experience. This particular location was a great second breakfast spot to go to from the Robey. Just know that the queue starts a little while before 9am and there is no ""kids only"" section, sadly, so if you have a hangover, this may not be the spot for you.

We were lucky because when we sat down, the wait time had changed to an hour. The place was jammin' with families, friends, and couples, all talking, eating, and laughing. Perfect! I immediately felt at ease as I slid into our booth, prepared to dive into a big plate of something--all the dishes around me looked marvelous and I couldn't decide, so I closed my eyes, let the roulette take over, and chose the goodies :) The sausage patties were pretty tasty; not greasy or fatty. I thought the Fruit Plate was pretty large for a side order; I enjoyed the medley of grapes, watermelon, cantaloupe, apples, pears, strawberries, and of course the chilled bananas. I did not share the chilled bananas.  The Tomatillo Salsa Scramble was light and surprisingly very filling! The egg white scrambled with grilled chicken, spinach and avocado was a protein heavy meal and the side of tomato slices and multi-grain bread rounded out the healthy portion of my brunch. I decided to get 'sinful' (as the menu says) with the White Chocolate & Caramel Pretzel Pancakes. Yes, that's right: white chocolate. caramel covered. pretzel. pancakes. The generous portion of three pancakes was more than enough due to the layers of crushed pretzel covered with white chocolate cream and buttery caramel.

The decor, walls, and chairs are very cute.  Our server was nice and helped us with menu options. Having read reviews we knew we wanted to split the Vegetarian Croissant Sandwich and pancakes but weren't sure which pancakes to go with. I have a sweet tooth but don't like things to be overly sweet. After the server assured us that the White Chocolate Caramel Pretzel Pancakes were a good amount of sweetness we decided to order that but asked her to bring it out after food so they wouldn't get cold.  Food: -Vegetarian Croissant Sandwich (we got ours with scrambled eggs) was very good. The Croissant was buttery, flaky, and basically perfect. The vegetables inside were very fresh and I loved the dill mayo they used! I asked for extra :) The house potatoes were well seasoned.  -White Chocolate Caramel Pretzel Pancakes - Holy hell. I have no words. These were AMAZING. They had the perfect amount of sweetness with a little bit of salty and a great crunch. The pancakes were well made (and I'm very picky when it comes to pancakes!) and were beautifully dense. If you get one thing here, GET THESE.

I called Bongo Room first and explained that I had suffered a heart attack three weeks ago, and I would not be able to stand and wait for a table. The manager, Maria, said that there was nothing she could do. She said that it wouldn't be fair to the other customers. When I called the other restaurant, the manager was as nice as can be. She put my name down, and by the time we got there my name was called we were seated immediately. The consideration I was given in itself is enough for me to give this other restaurant my business.

My friend, Sarah, and I got seated at a corner table, which was hard to navigate to and from because the tables in the restaurant are all packed one right next to the other. In a single moment of silence I could hear the entire conversation of the people sitting next to us and getting up to go to the bathroom was impossible. Our server, while attentive, was pressuring us to eat our food quickly. He brought the check before we were even halfway finished with our meal and came back multiple times to see if we had put our cards out. I could also go for slightly better lighting in this place. Such great food deserves a spotlight.",0.9575,0.807,0.135,0.058,0.5148550724637682

Not much has changed since that time other than subtle upgrades to the interior. This is still one of my favorite brunch/breakfast spots in the city.  Upon arrival there was a 30 minute wait.  We decided to walk around a bit while we waited. The one thing I noticed was the number of newer places that have opened up in this section of wicker park. When a place can stay in business for 20 years it tells you something about its success. The things I love about this place are 1) Coffee (they serve intelligentsia) 2) fresh ingredients in all of their menu items 3) awesome pancakes and French toast 4) efficient service.

Not the greatest for large crowds but the food is amazing! Worth the wait. My husband and I have been here over 5 times and each time we have been very happy with our food and service. I'm a savory breakfast person and my favorite is the BLT Benedict. My husband loves the sweet stuff and has yet to come across a French toast or pancake he didn't like.

The food was really pretty good - had the specialties of the Blackberry, lemon brioche french toast and the White Chocolate Caramel Pretzel Pancake. But perhaps I was expecting a bit more - so this might be on me. The pretzel pancake was dry and even the heaping amount of delicious white chocolate (which had a distinguishable cream cheese flavor) and caramel wasn't enough to moisten it. Actually the highlight of my meal was the side of sausage and the house potatoes. I'm sure we'll return, but we'll perhaps go with something on the savory side. The croissant breakfast sandwich sounded really yummy.  The decor is really cool and the ambiance, other than noise, is a really good reason to visit too.

2016-09-22,4.0,"We had breakfast at The Bongo Room and it was good. There are three locations in Chicago: this one, which is the original, in Wicker Park, Andersonville, and South Loop. These restaurants only serve breakfast, lunch, and brunch and do not accept reservations. Brunch is served on Saturday and Sunday. We chose this restaurant because we were looking for a good breakfast spot near our Airbnb in Wicker Park and this was the top search result on Yelp. This is a casual American restaurant (with a bar serving alcohol) and it's been in Chicago since 1993. It's a popular place. On a Monday mid-morning, it was busy. Luckily, our group of four didn't have to wait. However, several parties after us had to (early lunch crowd). The breakfast menu was pretty simple with eggs (any style), croissant sandwiches, breakfast burritos, omelettes, pancakes, and standard stuff like bacon, ham, and sausage. They have a variety of coffee drinks as well as teas and juices. They also have seasonal specials. Here's what we went with: Seasonal specials: * Lemon Brioche French Toast ($13.25) - warm Meyer lemon cream, blackberry coulis, fresh blackberries, shortbread-poppy seed streusel * Red Velvet Pancakes ($11.25) - red velvet chocolatey cocoa hotcakes topped with warm vanilla creme and toasted walnuts Savory (regular menu): * Chorizo, Potato & Avocado Omelette ($13.75) - chorizo, potato, avocado & queso fresco cheese omelette, salsa, tomatoes, toast * Spinach, mushroom, and smoked ham omelet (custom omelette) My favorite was the lemon brioche French toast. The lemon cream and blackberry coulis were tangy and delicious. The toast was just covered in the stuff. The red velvet pancakes were filling. Three thick pancakes come to each pancake order. You can mix and match pancakes, but it'll cost extra. I decided to get all three red velvet pancakes, but it turned out to be too much for me to eat. The pancakes were thick and the stack was topped with a good amount of creme. However, the pancakes were so dense that I had to ask for more creme, which they brought in a bowl. Yum! The portion size on the pancakes is so big that I suggest sharing an order. Otherwise, you'll probably have leftovers. The omelettes were yummy. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. What I like best about the omelettes is they are relatively healthy. If you customize an omelette, they start at $12.95 each and include 3 ingredients of your choice from a list of 30+. Additional ingredients are $1 each (meats are $1.50) and egg white omelettes cost $13.75. Service was great. The staff seems friendly and cool. TL;DR - I give The Bongo Room 3.5 stars rounded up to 4. If you're looking for quality, comforting American breakfast food, look no further.",0.9961,0.838,0.153,0.009,0.41668331668331665

I have came here multiple times and have been obsessed with the breakfast burrito entree. It's MASSIVE. It's filled with creamy guacamole that's paired nicely with the spinach tortilla and stuffed with scrambled eggs. The house potatoes are crispy and cooked to perfection. For under 10 dollars it easily tops any other breakfast place in the city.  I never order sweet entrees for breakfast but I have tried their strawberry and banana pancakes and they are great. Massive portion sizes again so don't order a savory and a sweet entree unless you intend on splitting it with someone. The ambience is noisy and lively, typical for a trendy breakfast place.

2016-05-22,1.0,"The food here was good and solid breakfast food.  But our server basically ruined the whole meal for us.  We came here on a Sunday early in the morning and the place was definitely busy.  We placed our order and waited around as people around us got their food.  Ok so what?  Well we just kept on waiting.  We saw people come in after us, order, and get their food while we kept on waiting.  After we saw two groups who arrived after us get their food, we asked our server, Andrea, how our food was coming just cause it had been a while and she blew up at us.  She yelled: ""I want you to spend the whole day here with me so your food is never coming.""  You would think she was joking, right, but no she was definitely mad at us for asking and her tone was angry, more than anything.  She seemed to be offended that we were asking.  She continued with the snarky attitude, lobbing more insults at us in a much harsher tone as the morning went on - like when she visited our table she was just angry and mean, not funny or nice, making us feel bad for even sitting at her table.  Guess how long it ultimately took for our food to come since we ordered? 42 MINUTES!!!!! Seriously?  That's not ok.  We counted a total of 5 groups arriving after us (some well after we arrived), getting their food and leaving.  Not once did Andrea ever apologize or offer any sense that this was not ok.  Here's the thing - we don't mind waiting for food especially when places are busy, but 42 minutes??  When we asked on our status, we were just being nice and asking - we thought it was reasonable to just ask to make sure there wasn't any sort of mixup.  All the busboys/girls were really nice, but Andrea probably shouldn't work in the service industry - we asked for a status on our food and you blow up at us and make us feel stupid for asking the rest of the morning.  Yeah, no thanks.  Even the people sitting on the table next to us told us she needs to work on her attitude and we didn't even say anything to them - they could just hear how she was talking to us.  If you go here, try and not get a table with Andrea with the Purple Hair.  She may be better than Becky with the Good Hair, but probably not by much.",-0.983,0.791,0.081,0.128,0.6054287918871253

Once I got there they had already started eating, I was extremely hungry and food looked good. But no one would come by me to take my order,  so 10 min later I asked a waiter for a menu. And as I decided what I will eat , the manager comes up and says ' I Am Sorry We Will Not Be Able To Serve You Today As Our Policy Is That We Don't Accept Joiners'... For good few seconds I thought she was joking...Ha ha ha  Whaaaaat? You are kidding right???!! She was not. The restaurant is small not like they have a hundred tables to serve and the kitchen can't handle one more extra order??? It was around 1pm, so the rush was dying out . Tables around us were empty, and now she tells me she will not let me eat!!!. Ok, so what am I supposed to do?  I paid $20 for a cab to get there, my friends are eating am I supposed to sit there and watch them eat? Or am I supposed to go somewhere else and eat by myself and talk to them on skype? What kind of ridiculous rule is that? And she had the nerve to stand there and argue with us about it. Her rationale is that if I will order food it will take 30 min for order to come out and we will sit there 'forever' ( why 30 min to wait for eggs or pancakes is another mind blowing thing she said and do I really want to be in place where the standard for breakfast to come out of the kitchen is 30 min ) but once again, the restaurant wasn't even that busy!!! Ok, so now is just dumb arguing from the manager's side. My friend says, 'so what's the difference if I finished my pancakes and I want to order a BLT benedict now, can you please order a BLT benedict?' And the manager DID NOT LET him order food. WOW!!! That is a first! As far as I know in a competitive restaurant business managers and owners bend over backwards to please their customers that is how they make their money isn't it?  But no, Bongo room is on completely different end of this spectrum. They refuse to serve you brunch!! And if you ordered one meal that's it you are cut off, no more food for you !!! They would rather turn away a paying customer just to follow some ridiculous rule that the owner has set up. Not taken into consideration the circumstances..Never experienced that before in the restaurant ... If this isn't a bad business practice I don't know what is..If this ridiculous rule exists, the way the manager handled it was despicable.

Sorry to say this will be the first and last time we will go here. I had to let myself cool down over night and think about what to write in case I said the wrong thing. Never had i felt like being discriminated against and ignored like I had here. We both are asians. Not your typical glasses with khakis and polo Asian. We sat down next to 2 nice ladies. We sat there and I was getting very annoyed about how long it took for them to come ask us what we wanted. 10 mins in, a group of 4 came in and within 5 mins they were attended to and orders were taken. I was extremely upset at this point. It's been 15 mins and no one took our orders. I got up, walked over and ask them if someone was going to take our order. The waiter said there was only 2 of them and that they were busy. I then said so why the group of 4 had there orders taken already and I have been here waiting. The other waiter gave me a look. Then a few mins later my order was taken. I had the French toast and my wife the red velvet pancake. As we wait for our food, more  customers came in at least 10. They were all attended to and orders were taken within 5 mins. It took 40 mins from the time we came in to the time we had our food. Of course those group of 4 had there food way before us. Food was good but nothing to go and brag about. One of the 2 ladies next to me wanted her leftovers to go. One of the staff took her plate and packed it and put it in a bag for her. My wife did not finish her pancakes so I asked for the check and for it to go. The waiter took my credit card then I was handed a box and a bag...why did I have to pack my own food when my neighbor's food was packed for them. They ran my card and then gave it to the 2 ladies also. I'm pretty sure she did not have an Asian name. I signed, left a decent tip still and left. I left here with a feeling of being discriminated against because of the color of my skin. No one have to be asked to be serve, if I have been sitting there I should get served first. I should not have to pack my own food. Either do it for everyone or don't do it at all. Read the bill before you give it back to  the table, make sure you 100% sure know who's credit card that was.

I went early since others had said it gets crowded quickly,  well... I was the first one there today which was OK with me. I was greeted as soon as I walked in with a warm hello. I went to the restroom first and this was the first time that I have ever experienced a hand dryer to be connected to the sink which was interesting and great at the same time because one the restroom is small which is OK but you didn't have to turn in a different location to dry your hands after washing them. (Can we say convenient?) Now by the way I have experienced all sorts of hand dryers but this one wasn't any ordinary hand dryer either this dryer was so POWERFUL let me repeat  so powerful that it actually was blowing  my hair as I dried my hands,  that was interesting to say the least. I would love to have this at my home. Now, after leaving the restroom and as I was sitting at my table my waitress asked me if I would like coffee I opted out and I decided to try one of their teas instead since it was a tad chilly in the restaurant ( no crowd so no heat from individuals well  I just have to guess that is why it was a little chilly). Well I ordered one of their white green teas which is call Pearl licious. The aroma alone was so inviting and the taste was delicious. Now, I had expected to order something not as popular on the menu just because I wanted to see if their non-popular dishes was as great as the ones that everybody talks and takes pictures of. But of course that didn't happen because the caramel pretzel pancakes kept calling my name and I was going to get a full order but the waitress advised me that half a order would actually be fulfilling just as well as a whole order so I went with that and a turkey sausage patty on the side. Along with a glass of orange juice that was icy cold  which was great for me because I love my orange juice cold not like some restaurants that give it to you at room temperature. So as I was enjoying my tea she brought the pancakes and sausage. As I dove straight into the pancakes it was a little different than other pancakes I've had in the past, it wasn't as fluffy it was a little bit more dense but that is maybe because of the fact that they wanted the Pancake to stand up to the pretzel crumble that they had between the two pancakes. At first I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the non-fluffy pancakes but as I was eating  more and more bites in my mind I was thinking who cares how fluffy or not this pancake is, it was just amazing!With the sweet white chocolate caramel on top and the pretzel crumble in between it was just the perfect blend of sweet and salty. The turkey sausage wasn't a perfectly round sausage patty that you would either get from the grocery store or a fast food chain this sausage you can tell was handmade because of the quality of the meat and it had pepper flakes in it nothing too overpowering it was good also. As I didn't finish my pancakes or sausage I was glad that I got half the order, the food was amazing. The only complaint I may have is that the orange juice was a little over price to me. Breakfast for 1 was close to $30 (I know, right??? ) but worth the experience.",0.9989,0.781,0.188,0.031,0.5257307771593486

Drink orders were taken promptly and the St. Germaine Sunshine Cocktail is delightful. There were a few brunch items with descriptions that sounded to die for, but I couldn't take my eyes off of the Deconstructed Lobster Roll Benedict. I was torn between savory or the Cranberry and Orange Pancakes. Fortunately, my friends are big on sharing, so Osi V and I ordered our own main courses and split the pancakes. I use the term ""split"" loosely because it was more like we ate about a quarter of the cakes combined and I brought most of it home. These pancakes are so good! They are thick without being too dense and have a good amount of cranberries and orange. The icing goes well with them and the gingerbread crumbs on top add a pleasant, unexpected element. The Deconstructed Lobster Roll Benedict was everything I wanted and more. I had recently asked a friend about her favorite lobster rolls in Chicago and this had been on her list. I can totally see why! It's a lot of food with a lot of flavor. The green goddess Hollandais was very good and the eggs were poached to perfection. The yolk was a beautiful, bright orange!

There was a mix up with our drinks, but the server gladly and quickly made a second mocha. We ended up splitting the tomatillo salsa scramble with chicken, avocado, and very good English muffins, per our server's recommendation; it was pretty good but just needed salt (full disclosure=it was from the vegetarian section of the menu). It wasn't a completely authentic Mexican salsa, but it wasn't experimentally-condimented (i.e. not bad combination of spices which upset my stomach a.k.a. passed the test.)

It was MLK day, and we weren't sure how crowded it would be, so our group of 5 arrived around 10:30 and were told we had a 45 minute wait but to come back in 20 minutes or so to check if a table had opened up. After browsing Myopic Books nearby, we went back after about 15 minutes and were given a table. Packed with people and super busy, our waiter seemed anxious to get our order in, but there were so many options it took us forever to decide. We finally decided to share the special Raisin Brioche French Toast and an order of the Caramelized Apple Hotcakes for the table, and I split a Bongo Room Crab Club with a friend. The food arrived pretty quickly, and we were wowed by the portions--they were huge! The Crab Club came with a side of hash browns, which I wasn't a fan of: there wasn't much flavor or crunch. The sandwich, however, was great--the crab was flavorful and the lemon-basil aioli complemented everything perfectly. The stars of the show for us were the sweet items--the mascarpone that came with the hotcakes was to die for, and the hotcakes themselves were so fluffy. I would have preferred for them to be a little more spiced/apple-flavored, but my friends really enjoyed them. The french toast was great as well--the brioche had been cut into thick slices, and the creamy sauce that was drizzled on top was just sweet enough.

The spinach wrap was soft and OK, but certainly nothing to write home about. The house potatoes (which are popular) were flavorless and lacked crunch. The salsa they served was straight out of a jar, but their other creamy sauce was decent. I ordered the iced coffee, which turned out to be just regular brewed coffee poured over ice. No cold brew iced coffee. Disappointing. Overall, a mediocre place with no oomph. I would not go back. My scrambled egg guacamole burrito was $10 and the coffee was $3.25.",-0.2907,0.878,0.058,0.064,0.49644536019536023

We were surprised when we didn't need to wait for a table but it was later than usual for us about 11:30 on a friday. We both ordered omletes and I asked for a side of bacon extra soft, I always order my bacon that way because crispy bacon gets caught in my throat and causes gagging ever since I had a severe head trauma! Our order showed up quickly faster than it should be and it wasn't our server that delivered it, we started to eat and the first piece of bacon I picked up fell apart in small pieces, soft bacon should not do that so I tried another piece which was so crispy it fell apart in my mouth. before I could catch it the bacon was in my throat causing me to start gagging, it took all my energy to keep from having any food in my mouth come flying out and i managed to cough into my napkin to get rid of it! When our server came over to check I informed her the bacon was way to crispy and dry to be cooked extra soft, her response was I asked for the softest pieces we don't cook bacon for every order it is cooked in the morning and held throughout the day! I told her I've worked in the food industry for many years and have never heard of such a practice st any good breakfast place but she sharply said ""Every restaurant does this!"" I know for a fact in the past we have been here and the bacon was cooked perfect before and freshly cooked because it was hot but it seems as they have gotten bigger quality has dropped! I instructed my wife not to tip our server because her attitude was poor at best but my wife still left her $5  for a tip way more than she deserved!

2015-08-24,3.0,"My girlfriend and I - man did we get lucky. We were living in a broken hovel above a BBQ place in Little Italy when some friends who lived in Wicker Park informed us that they were moving to Seattle and ""Did we want their apartment?"" We were dining at Girl and the Goat when they asked us and normally I don't make decisions drunk as hell, but their place was a palace compared to ours. Their pipes never froze, it didn't smell like mesquite and rendered pork fat all the time, they didn't have black mold in their kitchen, and their ceilings were like, pretty tall (Guess what? I never thought I'd care about high ceilings - but I do! Sue me, I live in Wicker now and I'm a yuppie AND I LOVE IT). I'm not done describing their place: They had parking spots included, exposed brick (see yuppie concerns above), and Wicker's a vibrant neighborhood where there're things to do - we're talking class. And Wicker doesn't have a police presence that makes you feel like you're a British bureaucrat living in 1840's Macao (To get a taste of that visit Taylor Street on any Friday night and observe bros in their natural habitat, flexing their constitutional right to wear backwards hats and talk shit while a constant stream of UIC police SUVs and unmarked CPD Narcotics cars prevent these idiots from stumbling across Roosevelt to their certain - and justified - deaths). What was I talking about? Oh yeah, so at that drunken Girl and the Goat dinner my girlfriend and I pulled out our abacus, crunched the numbers and decided YES! We'll take it! And we moved to the Palisades of Wicker Park. I immediately felt like a Sex and the City character. Or like Hanna from Girls. I'm kind of a Charlotte meets Hanna: quirky on the outside; Jewish on the inside and outside... Anyway, my buddy's wife told me one of the highlights of her WP life was that every weekend she could call ahead and get a table at Bongo Room. Pretty Swanky stuff, you guys. Well I'd never been to the Bongo Room so I was excited. I love breakfast food. Brunch is fine - I'm not here to bore you with basic-bitch brunch stuff. I'll do brunch, but I'm really more excited about breakfast FOOD. So our first weekend in Wicker came and holy shit the line for Bongo Room is insane. Picture what the line for the cure for death would look like and then connect that image with Bongo Room, which we're talking about here, and you have a pretty good idea of what the line for Bongo Room is like: it's really long. I decided to wait. I mean I wasn't going to barge in there and be like, ""Hey, you know S____ who used to live near here? WELL I LIVE IN THEIR PLACE NOW AND I EXPECT SERVICE, DAMN IT!"" No, I'm not a dick. We waited. We went the following Monday. And it was fine. Yeah, it was good, you know? The specialty pancakes are really sweet but otherwise forgettable and they have coffee and stuff. And hey, I really love coffee - probably more than the next human - but there was nothing about either the coffee or the pancakes, or any of the other items I sampled for that matter, that made me think, ""You know, I would kill someone to eat here,"" which is essentially what I feel like people do when they loiter in front of Bongo Room on a Saturday or Sunday morning waiting God knows how long with their whining children to get in and eat adequate pancakes. I mean, it just seems misguided to me. Point is, the quandary of Bongo Room's popularity has slowly driven me insane. EVERY weekend I pass a huge line pouring out of Bongo Room and I just can't figure out why people are willing to wait so long! Is it just the FINE pancakes, or is there something else? Is everyone pranking me? Are you in on this?! WHAT AM I MISSING? Seriously though, is taste really that subjective? Like, are there some people that really think this place is the bee's knees? I mean, if taste has no intrinsic nature, then what about morals? Are all actions equivalent? Does murder = child birth = picking up your dog's poo = lighting your dog's poo on fire on your neighbors stoop? Did the enlightenment mean nothing? Are we really no better than animals??? I just don't understand and it makes me feel dumb. Really dumb. Like so dumb that I just want to give up and stop using words and start communicating through grunts and gestures and eventually my grunts will become music and my gestures will become dance and I'll strip naked and just grunt and dance and eat and sleep and eventually winter will come and I'll die.

Overall, everyone enjoyed their meals.  Service was good.  Food was good and the portions were huge.  Half of the sandwiches will be enough for a normal person so sharing is caring.",0.9966,0.715,0.269,0.016,0.5778571428571428

The croissant sandwich was pretty good but greasy, and they were nice about substituting items which some places are overly picky about. The blueberry pancakes were flavorful but a bit overwhelming with the amount of cream that was on top. A half order was enough for a normal person. Can't imagine eating a whole order.

2015-07-20,4.0,"What a fun experience ! I researched unique brunch places in Chicago and was most excited to try out The Bongo Room. As someone with a big sweet tooth, the many flavored pancakes and French toasts were an attraction. I ordered a single serving of six (yes six) and enjoyed tasting the variety. My favorite pancake was the toffee pancake with the famous white chocolate pretzel pancake a close second. The red velvet pancake was also yummy. The pancakes' thick creme sauce, which smothers the pancakes, was good- not overly sweet. I do believe they use the same base cream sauce for all of the pancake toppings (which isn't really a big deal since most people would probably order one or maybe even two single servings). The staff was also terrific, my waitress was gracious (and even double checked if I meant to tip her as much as I did). The only drawback is the long wait: I was told I would have a 20 minutes wait and it ended up being a 60 minute wait. The restaurant does offer the option of texting you when your table is ready so you can explore the local area (or get an amazing latte like I did at the coffee shop next door- The Wormhole... try the honey bear!)",0.9904,0.8,0.188,0.012,0.44620535714285714

First I would like to start by saying I've always had good things to say about The Bongo Room. I have recommended all my friends, I usually go about once a month if not twice. I recommend The Bongo Room to a friend that has not experienced it, and shared how excited I was for her to try it. When I checked in John tell me 45mins to an hour. As we waited outside the entire time I over heard other customers  that were newly walking in to check in saying ""oh its only 45 mins"" and being called in before us! It almost seemed that tables with more people were being called first, and they were not going by a first come, first served basis. After waiting 55 minutes outside, my friend goes inside to check the waiting time  as I watched her 7 year old son outside. She comes out first and says he said 90 minutes to you. JOHN then storms out and loudly blurs out ""I TOLD YOU AN HOUR AND A HALF"" in front of other customers, and I said discreetly ""oh I could've sworn you said 45 mins to an hour"" again he yells out ""PEOPLE HEAR WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR"". I was in total shock and embarrassed. My friend proceeded to say I'm sorry what's your name, he say ""I'M JOHN AND I'M THE OWNER"",  turns around, shuts the door behind him. We could not believe what just happened. Talk about someone becoming too snotty with success. JOHN is rude, and he just lost a loyal customer; I have nothing good to say about The Bongo Room.

Since we are gluttons we ordered 4 different pancakes, a sandwich, and a bfast pretzel roll to share.  This was totally unnecessary because the pancakes are huge and we could just have been fine with two.  The food came out in about 15-20 min which wasn't bad considering how much food we ordered.  The red velvet pancakes which were highly recommended were so so to me.  I enjoyed the cranberry and the pumpkin pancakes way more!!! The pretzel roll breakfast sandwich was delicious and huge.  Honestly we would have had been fine just ordering that dish for 2 people. They do not skimp on portions here !! So beware of over ordering, you really do not want to end up with leftover pancakes. Pancakes were $4 each which is decent since they were the size of my face.

I had a burrito with eggs, sweet potatoes, avocado, and more, which he also tried.  Later, I found out that he went so far as to tell our dad about how great it was.

But when you go in expecting to get your favorite dish (the white chocolate pretzel carmel pancakes, for instance) and they don't have them that can be a bummer. I am more of a savory breakfast person, and I think the menu is sort of lacking in that department. But everyone loves sweets - and they let you order a smaller version of some of the sweet dishes, which is a huge plus. But that just makes it more tempting to eat way too much. I would avoid this place on the weekends - there are tons of great brunch places nearby. But if you are looking for some good breakfast during the week, it's a great place.

2014-12-23,2.0,"Yesterday was my second time visiting the Bongo Room.  After struggling to find something that stood out on the savory part of the menu, I ordered the tomatillo salsa scramble.  This might have been one of the worst brunch meals I've had in Wicker Park.  This review gets two stars because the service was decent and even a low-end Wicker Park brunch is still decent.  I also invited myself to taste a decent portion of my girlfriend's best friend's omelette.  In short, my gut reaction to this place is that if you like bland savory options, then this is THE place for you!  I did not particularly enjoy my meal, and the tomato slices just seemed a bit random.  I did not agree with the way the chicken was prepared and found it a bit on the chewy side, and it tasted like it was just steamed without anything to add flavor.  The omelette was equally bland though I don't expect much in the way of spice in an omelette (though plenty of places jazz these up with their own sauces and by spicing the vegetables).  I guess it's more telling to say that the omelette was bland compared to other omelettes I've had (and I eat plenty :-) ). My girlfriend got one of the specials, which was a cornbread pancake with cranberries inside and a tub of orange butter on the side.  This pancake was fairly good, and is a decent option for people who like a sweet brunch.  I'm an egg brunch kind of guy, but my girlfriend is the opposite, and I usually wind up having to help my girlfriend finish her food (and sometimes insist that I do).  This was one of those occasions where I insisted on helping her, but I think it was mostly that she was hungry because I had delayed our brunch trip.  The pancake was certainly better than my meal, so I helped myself to more than she would have cared for me to, but it was a little too dry for them to deliberately serve it without any sort of syrup. I can safely say I would rather buy sweet than savory at the Bongo Room, but I can find definitely find better choices in both categories at other restaurants in Wicker Park.  Birchwood Kitchen and Toast Two are two that I would easily place well above these guys for their savory brunch capabilities. With all that said, service was quite good (though the busboy giving us refills was not receptive to our expressions of gratitude).  The ambiance is pretty cool.  The drink choices looked quite interesting, but I can't report on that until I try them (something for a future review or an update to this one).",0.9961,0.832,0.149,0.019,0.5640243902439024

We came together as a party of 4 on Sunday at 10 AM and thank god for the holidays because somehow we only had a 20 minute wait (I hear it's normally an hour).  My friends and I were overwhelmed by the choices, especially the pancakes. We decided on the pumpkin and the red velvet, but our server let us know we would be missing out if we didn't order the gingerbread. She was right. We ordered them all and the gingerbread was the best - it had all the goodness of a gingerbread cookie but also warm and fluffy. The pumpkin was a bit bland but came with a special cup of their whipped cream. So good that I wished they sold it in tubs. Luckily, there was enough where I could slather it on every pancake. The red velvet was pretty tasty as well. I've been trying to be healthy as of late and liked that they their chicken and avocado egg white omelette with a side of sliced tomatoes was located at the top of the menu. It was a big dish and was nothing too different from what I could make at home, though the chicken was ample and pretty tender. My friend raved about her eggs Benedict and no one at my table could finish their potatoes. I have to say that bongo room does portions right.  Service here is good and bad. When we finished our meal, we were asked at least 4 times if we needed anything else - definitely a polite way of asking us to leave but I can't blame them given how packed this place gets. The food here is really solid though I think savory food lovers might pick somewhere else first because the sweets are really where bongo room shines. The chocolate tower French toast is legendary.",0.9966,0.75,0.212,0.038,0.5232239982239982
2014-12-08,4.0,"I left the Philly chill to visit Chicago the weekend following Thanksgiving (it was warm?!? Windy City - have you not earned your name?) My friend (the local) recommended we come here for brunch. We arrived early (before 10) and had to wait about 20-30 minutes. Though I usually hate waits, I will wave the white flag: this was well worth it! I ordered the black bean and sweet potato burrito. It was truly delicious - I had a huge appetite that morning and struggled to put a dent in it. While I thought I would hate the spinach wrap (not something you normally throw on a proper burrito), everything worked. I wish I could have tried their cocktails - my friend asserts they are phenomenal. However, due to state law, those are not to be had until 11 am (still better than Jersey!).

And that's because it is the gold-standard for brunch in Chicago.  We love the Original Pancake House, Walker Brothers, Nookies, and of course, Ann Sathers, but none of them top The Bongo Room.  Which is why you'll always have to wait for a table. For this particular brunch, I had a red eye coffee, a bloody mary, and the beef tenderloin eggs Benedict.  Everything was delicious.  We'll return many times in the future.  Mazel tov.",0.5043,0.896,0.059,0.045,0.4643939393939394

2014-11-18,5.0,"Food is outstanding. A lot of the food is super-rich, so if you like something a little toned-down, the seasonal pancakes are great (Lemon Poppyseed in the summer, Carmel Pear in the fall).  Usually when brunch places offer dishes that are this over-the-top, side dishes or basic breakfast items can suffer.  Not so with The Bongo Room! Besides having deliciously bombastic pancakes and  various eggs benedict dishes, their execution of basic breakfast food is also stellar. Their breakfast potatoes are crispy on the outside, smooth on the inside, and so flavorful. Their poached eggs are gooey, spreadable, and taste wonderful.  The only thing I wasn't too fond of was the Bloody Mary. Boozy, yes, snacks, great, but too acidic for me. My friend didn't like hers either. Service is great--food comes out fast and the servers are very nice. If your party is greater than 2 people, and it's a weekend, the wait is long (over 30 minutes).

The white chocolate pretzel pancake was probably a little better, since it was covered with white chocolate syrup which made it a little less dry, but also made it diabetes inducingly sweet. after about a quarter way, my friend gave up on trying to eat the pancake at all. I didn't have much of the vegetarian option but I did try the side of breakfast potatoes and they were so salty! It was like eating potatoes which had been dunked in and rolled around in salt All in all, I was really unimpressed by the food at the Bongo Room, everything we had was either too sweet, too salty, or too dry. :(",0.9692,0.813,0.14,0.048,0.4383424908424908

Gosh, it was perfect and I wanted more! I don't really know what else to say apart from that you can actually taste the lobster without it being too fishy, and you can tell the meat came from an actual lobster instead of some sort of imitation meat.

I originally was going to order the strawberry and banana pancakes and just as our server came to the table I noticed there was, wait for it....a menu with SPECIALS. Gotta love specials.

I'm sure the other option would have been equally delicious, but if red velvet anything is every an option, I'm in.  Brace yourself, because their pancakes are HUGE.

Today I met a group of coworkers for breakfast. Within a few minutes of arriving and waiting for the rest or our group, we were told by our server that we needed to know exactly how many in our group were coming (we couldn't remember if it was six or seven people), because they don't allow add-ons. Huh? Apparently they get so slammed that it's difficult to accommodate additional guests. Good thing the food was worth every bite, because even before getting situated, I was completely turned off by our server.  Whew, good thing we guessed right (yay!), because we didn't have to turn anyone away in the pretty empty space. After getting all seven (7) of us settled at our booth, we oooed and awwed over our extremely hard-to-decide-what-to-get menus and dreamed up our breakfasts.Yep, I sooooo wanted to get something from the sweet side of the menu, like the lemon and blackberry graham cracker crusted pancakes, but I'm cutting out sugar and opted for an egg white omelet with baby spinach, roasted red peppers and fontina cheese. Sides included yummy chunky potatoes and choice of bread. I appreciated that the food was lightly seasoned.  Special notes: Lunch doesn't start until 11AM. The portions are ginormous so come really really hungry. Great urban vibe. Not as busy as I remember. Menu that caters both to your sweet or savory side.",0.9853,0.848,0.13,0.022,0.45024630541871924

2014-08-13,4.0,"The Bongo Room has been on my Chicago food bucket list for several years now so my husband and I decided that it was time to finally check it off. We woke up early on a Sunday morning and headed to their Wicker Park location. They also have locations in Andersonville and the South Loop (no alcoholic beverages in the South Loop) and all locations open at 9am on Saturdays and Sundays. We arrived around 8:45am and there was already a line forming out front. By the time the doors opened the line was down the block and by 9:10am every seat in the restaurant was full. Moral of the story - get there early or be prepared for a long wait! Before I arrived I already knew one of my must-orders, the White Chocolate Caramel Pretzel Pancakes. These aren't on the menu but they're one of The Bongo Room's most popular items, and now I know why. These giant, plate-sized pancakes are completely drenched in the white chocolate and caramel topping and all I can say is Wow. I don't even like white chocolate, but these pancakes were ridiculously good. They offer a half order so you can have just one pancake if you want to try a few different things, but my guess is you'll be wishing you had the whole stack - I know I did. I've also heard that the Red Velvet pancakes, another off-menu item, are pretty fantastic as well. My husband and I shared the pancakes and also ordered a couple of the savory menu items. He went for the Chorizo Potato Avocado Omelette and I tried the Deconstructed Lobster Roll Benedict. Like the pancakes, both were huge portions and very good. If you're a fan of avocado and chorizo, this omelet is totally stuffed with both. The Eggs Benedict was topped with a green goddess hollandaise that was a really delicious twist on one of my favorites. The buttery buns beneath the eggs could have been a bit more fresh, but I was still happy with my choice. Both of these dishes came with a side of The Bongo Room's House Potatoes that were really great as well. My recommendation - don't miss the sweeter side of things at The Bongo Room. Red velvet pancakes, chocolate French toast, white chocolate caramel pretzel pancakes...they're all winners and they're what makes The Bongo Room extra special. I'm usually more of a savory breakfast girl myself but this is where I will make the exception.

When it arrived, I tried the potatoes first, which were lukewarm at best. The English Muffin was hot and the butter melted. Then I broke into the egg and yolk ran all over my plate! That's not over-medium! I wouldn't have sent it back because of the potatoes, but because there were 2 fouls, I did. While I waited, I was given a fresh-but-cold English Muffin and a side plate with my sausages on them...ummmm...WTF?

2014-08-03,1.0,"Just got back from brunch at the Bongo Room, and I have to say, I was terribly disappointed. After having read the reviews here, I expected that the food would be better than IHOP, but I was wrong! First, we were told that it would be a 30 minute wait for a table for two. Actual wait time? 1 hour 20 minutes. After we were seated, my husband and I found out that the acoustics of the restaurant are so bad that we actually had to shout at each other at the top of our lungs just to hear one another, despite the fact that we were 2 feet apart from one another. The wait and the ambient noise weren't the worst part, though. That would have to be the food.  I ordered the pancakes with meyer lemon and blackberries. They cost more than $10 and do not come with any side items. The cakes were so dense and gummy that I was unable to eat more than half of one pancake. The lemon curd was not the punch of citrusy acid I was expecting -- it was much more like a lemony creme anglaise, which, when combined with the blackberry syrup was so intensely and cloyingly sweet that the 3 actual blackberries on the dish tasted savory. There was absolutely no balance to the dish, and I left feeling sick at my stomach. All I could think to myself when we left was, ""I want to wash my mouth out with bacon.""  And sure, you can order a side of bacon there... for about the cost of a full pack of bacon at the grocery store.  After spending $10+ for inedible pancakes, I wasn't about to give them the opportunity to disappoint me with meat.",-0.4103,0.832,0.085,0.083,0.48991147741147756

So I'm no stranger to waiting an hour to an hour and a half for a table at brunch joints, especially on a Sunday, but usually the wait is justified by a delicious meal. This is not the case at the Bongo Room. I ordered a stack of french toast with raspberry and vanilla sauce. It was sickeningly sweet. There was no finesse, no balance, just sweet on sweet on dry tasteless french toast. Speaking of the toast, there was a stack of 3 slices, the top slice was covered in sauce, while the other two were bone dry, and tasteless.  I thought maybe I ordered the wrong thing, perhaps I should have ordered an omelet, maybe that is what people are talking about when they give this place anything more than 3 stars, but then I saw my neighbor had ordered just that, and they were not happy either.

The food was very good as was the service. While we were eating, a MOUSE RAN UNDER OUR TABLE AND CONTINUED TO SCURRY AROUND UNDER THE SURROUNDING TABLES. The waitstaff and hostess tried to corner it with brooms, all while people were sitting at their tables and eating. The hunt continued for 10-15 minutes; the mouse scurrying about, brooms and rags attempting to corner the mouse. An employee finally captured it in a plastic cup and carried it away through the restaurant. We never saw a manager come out to address the issue or offer apologies to the patrons. A few of us lost our appetites, not finishing our meals. We checked any bags we had on the floor, etc. We were taken aback by the nonchalance of the scene. When we paid our bill, there was no offer of a discount for the mouse disruption or apology. I realize there are mice in old buildings in the city, I just don't want to eat with them.

The wait was more than an hour, and the inconvenience of the busted door hasn't helped to ease our experience when checking on our wait time. The atmosphere was festive and hipsterish. The décor was antiquated comparing to the other two locations, but by far this one was the most crowded.  The Lobster Roll Benedict ($14.95) was stacked with perfectly poached eggs oozing into bits of lobster on toasted buns, and dressed in green hollandaise. The side of house potatoes was starchy and soft from the initial bite to the core. There were good textures on the lobster and the bread, and the savory hollandaise provided some finesse to this definitive winner. I recommend it. The Lemon and Blueberry Danish Hotcakes ($9.95) came with plenty of blueberries and a hint of lemon in the backdrop. I wished the Hotcakes were more finesse, as the texture could be softer for me to cut into. I wished the ricotta encompassed more wow factor, but the subtle lemony tangy finish was enough to save the day. Service was very absent with little follow up on our requests. I was especially turned off when they called the wrong name when they tried to seat us.

My husband and I joined another couple here for brunch on a Saturday. Note: We expected a wait given the popularity and the hour. I was told that a party of four would be 30 minutes, so we chatted outside in the muggy heat for about 40 minutes. I get that estimates are just that: estimates. But it's not the extra ten minutes that bothered me. At 40 minutes, a girl came outside with a piece of paper and started going up to people and taking their names and how many people were in their party. Ummmmm didn't we already do that more than half an hour ago? Why am I getting the sense that things are not organized... I decided to go inside and ask the hostess how far up the list we'd made it. I was naturally met with attitude and told that we'd been waiting 30 minutes, the time she'd originally allotted. No, I said. It's been longer than that. I was met with a very fake smile and another estimate of about 15 more minutes. Yay. I went outside and told the group maybe we should consider somewhere else. But right as we started throwing out suggestions, someone came out and called our name. Magically, the table was now ready. Makes you wonder how many times in the past you've waited unnecessarily because you didn't say anything. Of course, the food was very good. I should have gone with one of the outrageous pancake options they offer, but I was in a lighter mood and opted for the egg white omelet with tomatillo salsa, chicken and avocado.

The bread and butter of Bongo Room is their creative pancake combinations.  You definitely have to order one of them even if you're not a pancake person.  Seriously, just order one.  Share it with your dining companion. I knew I didn't want to order a whole stack of pancakes.  Thankfully, you can order just one, which will set you back $5, which is kinda high for a pancake. To save room for said pancake, I ordered the two eggs any style (basted) with a side of bacon.  In terms of eggs and bacon, they were good and cooked well.  However, there was absolutely nothing about them that distinguished them from any other basted eggs & bacon that I've eaten at any other brunch joint.  Bottom line: kind of a fail and wished I would have sprung for a more adventurous dish. For the pancake, I ordered the red velvet.  And wow, it was humongous and thick.  It was sinfully delicious.  Like, I could literally feel my thighs expanding as I shoved bite after bite into my mouth.  It was topped with a generous helping of cream cheese frosting, which had the perfect amount of sweetness. However, it soon got to be overkill after eating a few too many bites.  And, I think the middle wasn't as cooked as it could have been.  Nonetheless, I'm glad I tried it and definitely would be interested in trying their other creative pancake combinations. My fiancé ordered a chorizo potato avocado omelette, which was delicious.  However, the potatoes were a bit of let down since they mushy.  I prefer my breakfast potatoes to be nice and crisp. Our server was great, checked up on us the appropriate amount of times and constantly made sure our water and coffee were refilled.  Our takeout boxes were also provided quickly, which was nice. Price wise, Bongo Room is comparable to others in the area... not super expensive, but not the cheapest by any means. I'd give it another chance to other a different breakfast dish and to sample another pancake creation.  Also, the lunch menu looks pretty good so maybe I'll try that next.",0.9938,0.813,0.169,0.019,0.6036165577342049

The white chocolate and pretzel pancakes I had here are to date the best pancakes I've ever eaten. The bloody marys here are also quite good. Unfortunately, the last two times I've been here I have been refused service and given the bill so they could rush me out.

I think brunch at any restaurant is usually the least interesting, least inspired, and probably made by the lowest guys on the back-of-the house pecking order.

There was no wait (as expected), but still a good amount of people considering it was a weekday.  I came with a friend and we ordered two things from the specials menu:  1. Apple cranberry brioche french toast (vanille bean brioche with brown sugar and butter sauteed apples and dried cranberries, vanilla bean cream, and oatmeal streusel crumbs): HEAVENLY. There was a wide variety of flavors and textures to keep my taste buds happy, and the portion was generous. The one thing I have to complain about was the fact that after you got past the first layer of toast (it came with a stack of three), you didn't really have sufficient cream/toppings leftover to enjoy the other two. We ended up finishing almost 2 of the slices and then left the rest because there was nothing to top it with.  2. Chicken fajita omelette (red and yellow peppers, and some heavenly cheese (?) sauce): so good. The chicken and peppers were light enough to balance the rather heavy creamy sauce, and the flavors just.... well... worked! The potatoes on the side were on the blander/mushier side, but at least the omelette itself was great. Verdict in terms of food: I was afraid it would be overhyped, but the food lived up to its standards for the most part.  Service: DID NOT LIKE. Our waitress was really aloof and cold, and the only time I felt like she was being decently polite was near the end when we got our check.

Was told 45 but that it might be quicker. Walked around the neighborhood a bit so wait was not bad at all. Tried the two eggs over easy with a choice of toast and breakfast potatoes. As a breakfast potatoes fan, found them to be very tasty and more soft/casserole like than crispy like some other places. Overall, portions are giant and they seem to be known for their sweet menu items, such as the red velvet pancake we tried. It was decadent, to say the least and barely made a dent into the one pancake. The others ordered the brioche apple cinnamon french toast and the breakfast burrito. Reminds me of ""treat yo self"" food like after running a marathon or completing a long training run. The service was very good, though you could tell they were wanting to turn over tables pretty quickly, so definitely not a place to linger on the weekends.

If it wasn't because my sister was here from out of town and really wanted to try this place, I would have left after 10 minutes of waiting. It is very small and you can't even walk anywhere without bumping into other clients, tables, servers etc..(I went to the Wicker Park location). They don't accept reservations which is a bummer and there is street parking but it's such a congested part of the city that it's very hard to find one. There is really no area to wait so you really just have to stand outside and wait to be called. Besides all these misfortunes, the food is well worth the wait. Everyone at our table raved on how delicious their meal was. I had a omelette special that came with chorizo, avocado, tomato and a couple other ingredients I can't remember, but what I do remember is that it was the best I've ever had. I also ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice to die for. My sister had red velvet pancakes and that's exactly what I will be ordering next time I go back. The server gave us all the condiments we needed so we didn't have to ask for anything which is rare in any restaurant. Our water glasses were refilled constantly and the prices for the quality of food were awesome!!

The Bongo Room has good brunch, the ambiance is nice and it's in a hip area of Wick Park  that is pretty close to the Damen Blue line stop, so it's easy to get to without a car.  If you are using a car to get here, expect to pay for parking on the street. It's only open until 2:30 PM every day, which I personally think is a shame because the food is good, and the portions are large. it's one of the few places that does breakfast and brunch that late during the week and doesn't have a diner atmosphere -which has its pros and cons. Pro's its nice to get there and have a later brunch on a day off during the week, cons it can be crowded and they do really try to rush you out the door when the clock hits 2:30 PM.  The 2 eggs any way, choice of meat, with toast and breakfast potatoes is huge and one of the cheapest things on the brunch menu. The breakfast croissant is slightly more expensive and comes with potatoes as well, and is really delicious. They have multiple flavors of mimosas, and they're delicious (the raspberry is my favorite)! I wish they'd do bottomless mimosas during the week like they do during Sunday brunch for $15.00. One weird thing I really want to try their eggs Benedict- it looks fantastic and it's next on my list.  Cons: The seating is kind of uncomfortable The waiters can't bring you a new drink til you finish your first They try to rush you out a bit close to closing.

We were a party of 6 and had already waited an hour for our table, and when they finally had our table ready, she would not let us sit down because we were missing one person who was on their way to the restaurant. We told her we would order for him, but even then she would not let us go to our table because it is their ridiculous policy to not seat a party unless it is complete. After a lot of convincing, one of the waitresses took us to our table, but immediately after we say down, the hostess came back and told us we were not allowed to do that, and made us STAND beside our table (being totally in the way of all the waiters and customers), and a minute later proceeded to give our 6-person table away to a party of 3!! Not only was that a poor business decision on her part but it was also extremely disrespectful and poor customer service. She didn't even apologize and instead just told us we would have to wait for another table (after an hour wait...)  At this point we were just so angry that we wanted to leave, but after having waited for so long and having heard great things about the food, we decided to ignore her rudeness and stay. We finally got another table and after arguing with her for 15 min, were allowed to sit down and order for everyone (including the guy who was late and hadn't shown up yet).  The food was good and the rest of the brunch went fine, but I have never been treated this way before at a restaurant, and for that reason, I will not be going back to the Bongo Room.

2014-01-01,1.0,"Having repeatedly seen Bongo Room on various lists for best brunches in Chicago (and specifically for best omelette and for best pancakes), I finally took my mother here on her visit to my neighborhood, eager to impress.   My mother loves sweet breakfasts, and was persuaded by three of the waitstaff to order one of their pancake dishes--the hostess said she would trample a crowd for these.  My mom decided on the Bananamisu pancakes.  What she got was a ridiculously huge plate of thick, tough pancakes, smothered in a cloyingly sweet, stiff gluey sauce, accompanied by a mousse-like glob of something else equally sweet and gooey.  According to my mother, it was ""everything you don't want on top of your pancakes.""  As an omelette lover, I asked if the omelettes were highly recommended, and was told: ""we aren't called the best brunch place in Chicago for no reason.""  I ordered the special omelette (beef, butternut squash, spinach, and whipped sage ricotta, replacing the beef with mushrooms).  The filling itself was delicious, but it was encased in an unappetizing-looking shell of egg, uniform in color and texture, perfectly round, with no browning whatsover.  It was obvious that the filling had not been cooked with the egg, but rather, placed in a pre-cooked ""egg shell"" resembling a store-bought wrap--the filling could be completely slid out of the egg, leaving no sign of itself.  It very well could have been Egg Beaters, cooked in bulk in microwavable molds.  As anyone knows, an omelette should be slightly browned on the outside, while soft and juicy on the inside, the filling co-mingling with the egg a bit.  It would appear that the chef has never seen or eaten a real omelette.   We have not been able to stop talking about this breakfast disaster for two days, and cannot believe that Chicagoans wait in line daily for this sorry excuse for a brunch. (To be fair, we will say that the breakfast potatoes were decent (though not very crisped on the outside), and the Bloody Marys superb, with a unique smoky flavor.  Also, our waitress was very nice and helpful.)",0.9787,0.787,0.142,0.071,0.5375814536340853

2013-11-11,3.0,"The Bongo Room is nothing special. A friend of mine and I had been dying to try this restaurant. The Bongo Room was shrouded in mystery for us. She had tried a couple times unsuccessfully to get a table. I've walked by on weekends and seen a line out the door, and I've heard of people waiting over an hour to get in. We decided to stop in on a weekday when we were both free at about 1:30. We were excited to see that there was no wait and we were seated right away. They had both the breakfast and lunch menu available, and we both ended up ordered off of the breakfast menu. My roommate got the breakfast burrito. It looked pretty good, eggs, guacamole, and cheese. She seemed to enjoy it. I got the cannoli hotcakes. These were not what I was expecting at all. Firstly, when the said that the hot cakes had ""ricotta"" in them, I was expecting a lighter, fluffier texture and to be able to taste some of the cheese. These pancakes weren't bad, they were just average in terms of both flavor and texture. Secondly, I did not expect them to be absolutely drenched in the ""pistachio"" cream, which I wish actually tasted like pistachio rather than just being green, sweet goop that made the pancakes way too soggy. Since the plate was absolutely covered in the cream, when I tried to scrape any of it off the top, I would inevitably be dunking the piece I had cut off in the gooey mess, defeating the purpose. It was drizzled with chocolate, which tasted like the chocolate syrup that come in squeeze bottles. As you can probably tell,  I was pretty unimpressed. So the Bongo Room is still shrouded in mystery for me, because I just don't understand what the hype is all about. The food here is not memorable and the atmosphere here is average.

I took my mother in-law, who's visiting from Sweden, to the Wicker Park location. She is celiac and was interested in an alternative to toast with her meal. The waitress was quite annoyed and rude by our inquiry proclaiming the toast was ""complimentary"" and there was nothing she could do, nor wanted to do for that matter. First of all, toast is not ""complimentary"", it is apart of the cost of the plate you order at a restaurant. Yeah, I know, it's just toast, but still apart of the full serving. Second, celiac is a disease, not a dietary restriction by choice. Having recently been to Portland and Denver, where the gluten free accommodations are abundant at most restaurants, I've grown tired of the lack of compromise in Chicago. Sure, you can go to a specific restaurant for gluten free options, but why not appease the widest range of customers possible, especially being a breakfast joint. As much as I love this place, there are so many great breakfast restaurants in the neighborhood, many of which substitute the toast with a side of fruit for a extra buck or two.

That has now switched to sushi and tequila. Anyways, I was in the area on a Wednesday around 11:30am so we thought why not try such a well reviewed place with multiple locations to boot. And we came in, had no wait, than again I am pretty sure if it was a Saturday morning the line would be out the door. We got seated and the place has a bright, charming atmosphere with brick walls and cute little tables with lots of light coming in.  We weren't too hungry and just ordered some potatoes to share, which were just okay, should have went for some bacon and sausage, but what we were really there for were the hotcakes! Damn, were they good. The flavor they had that day were lemon and blueberry hotcakes (which taste like extra large pancakes) and ricotta cheese on top. The portion included three plate size hotcakes and so it was more than enough to share with two people and we easily could have shared them with three. They were light, lemony, full of fresh blueberries so I would be interested to see what other options they come up with in the different seasons.  Considering brunch isn't my favorite anymore, I think Bongo Room is definitely worth a visit for getting a cup of hot chocolate or coffee and ordering those hotcakes. The waitress, after seeing that we couldn't even finish three of them told me it could have been ordered in a half portion so that is something to keep in mind.

It was supposed to have artichoke in it, but I don't believe I found a single piece of artichoke. Mostly just the tomatillo salsa, which was fine, and bland potatoes. I'm a big fan of breakfast potatoes and these were a huge disappointment. Big chunks of potato, no flavor, no crunch, . Oh, and they do the omelette here where the eggs are whipped up and cooked into a big fat pancake, the ingredients are placed inside, and the egg pancake is closed. The result is something like wrapping a waterbed around... anything.... It should be enough that there is a waterbed in this omelette metaphor. I like for my eggs to get to know the other ingredients a little more, and at the very least for some salt to be introduced.  A lot of people have said very good things about the sweet breakfast items here, but as someone with a strong preference for savory breakfasts I have to say I did not enjoy my breakfast here at all. Perhaps I was oversold, but I found this omelette to be beyond boring and basically flavorless.

No booze at the South Loop location, so if you're looking for a mimosa, go elsewhere.  VERY quick service also.  You can tell they want you in and out--no lazy Sunday morning brunch here.",0.7373,0.864,0.085,0.051,0.4302083333333334

Reading the Yelp reviews I was a bit nervous about all this talk about sugar running thru veins etc, but when I got to the Bongo Room, there were lemon blueberry pancakes on the menu. Fact: they are fabulous. The ricotta, I think, makes them a bit fluffier than the other types of pancakes and obvi embedding things in pancakes = winning. (That is to say, we also had the berry banana pancakes, which just have fruit syrup and fruit on top and it was underwhelming).  Be warned though: this is a heavier pancake, and they're each about the size of a dinner plate. Luckily, you don't have to order the whole set of 3 (although I do think the price gets close enough if you order 2...).  Came on a weekday morning, so there wasn't a wait.

They used to also have fresh squeezed orange juice, but in the past few visits I've noticed that the taste is no longer fresh. Then I saw that they no longer squeeze their own orange juice, they purchase it from somewhere and the taste is more concentrate than fresh. So believe you me, don't spend the $4-5 per glass for this OJ. Everything else though? Do do do order, this place is phenomenal.

About an inch thick, so when they grill them the middle is juicy and soft and the outside is crunchy. My husband got one pear pancake and two pumpkin carrot pancakes, which were to die for.

Besides ordering their rich Intelligentsia Coffee (drinking it black, btw), our savory was one of Bongo Room's specials, the Deconstructed Lobster Roll Benedict ($14.95), while the sweet was the Lemon and Blueberry Danish Hotcakes ($9.95)--all dishes famously executed in 2-3 servings.  The poached eggs were cooked and tasted splendidly with an adequate amount of sweet lobster shreds, savory green goddess hollandaise, and toasted, buttery buns underneath.  The house potatoes were quite of a potato lover's paradise: perfectly fluffy b-fast starchies seasoned with thyme, but what made it greatly tastier was adding black pepper, lots of Cholula sauce, and (to DL) a pinch of salt. As for the 3-stacked sweet side, I enjoyed the plentiful blueberries that still attained its juice when I cut the lemony hotcake.  The ricotta and Danish filling atop the stacks were just-right tangy and nicely creamy.  The most conspicuous concern, though, was that the cakes themselves were a tad hardened, resulting in a not-so-fluffy texture and more effort to cut through the piles. Conclusively, our waitress could have been friendlier but was minimally attentive, such as refilling my coffee with no need for me to ask.  Overall brunch was satisfying, but I fully bet the experience would have been more pleasurable if they could improve these noted issues.  I heard the Red Velvet Pancakes were smashing at Bongo Room, so to me that would be a reason to come back.",0.9952,0.776,0.183,0.041,0.5016956162117453

CLEANLINESS: 3.5/5 (I wish they would wipe down each table after every customer with disinfectant) QUALITY OF FOOD: 3.5/5 TASTE OF FOOD: 3.5/5 (their food tastes slightly better than Yolk's, but I was surprised that their food wasn't BETTER, based on the very positive Yelp reviews.  I'd honestly probably choose Walker Brother's over Bongo Room.  Their food is of similar quality, though Bongo Room has a far better presentation and variety.  If you want a ""sweet"" or ""dessert-like"" breakfast, Bongo Room is where you should go, though.) ---------- (**note: I rate each eatery relative amongst its type/range in THAT city.  So, no, I'm not rating this restaurant compared to Alinea or some Michelin-star restaurant.  I rate it and analyze it's component qualities (above) from 1-5 compared to other eateries with similar food type, aura, and price range) For a breakfast place, this place is just surprisingly alright.  I was expecting something amazing based off Yelp reviews and photos of their plating presentation.  I will say it is very affordable here. I would definitely never be a regular here for a few reasons. 1) THEIR WAIT.  I can't be a regular at a place that has a 30 min-1 hr+ wait and doesn't take reservations.  Like, I have places to be, things to do, and work!  If it were spectacular, I would perhaps try to come once every now and then, but it just tastes ok. 2) Their food looks far better than it tastes.  Not that it tastes terrible, but it's just ok. 3) I come here when I want a dessert-y breakfast, which they excel at in presentation and variety (taste is above average)... but I do not always want a dessert-like breakfast. 4) it is LOUD LOUD LOUD here.  It is very popular, a very small space (thin and long, like a long hall-way), and people are crammed together in tiny tables.  If you are lucky, sit at the bar away from other people.  It can get too hard to hear other people, sometimes.  If you want a quiet time to eat or think, don't come here.  The atmosphere at Yolk is better than here (so is the space arrangement there!) 5) I hate how they do/make their potatoes.  SO DRY. If you want a more quality or delicious ""just the normal stuff"" breakfast (like the basic breakfast food types, like no red velvet pancakes/french toast, etc), go to Walker Brother's.  They make more delicious pancakes/etc. at Walker Brother's.  I really like their 49-er pancakes, which are served in layers, each layer as thin as a crepe and oh-so-buttery.  I even skip the syrup on the 49ers, because I enjoy the pancake so much.  I feel Bongo Room just runs away with variety and presentation, and their hype is built off that, not necessarily taste, which was unimpressive. Of course, if you're looking for an ACTUAL quality brunch, I suggest the Grand Hyatt and Four Seasons.  AMAZING LUNCHES!!  I prefer the Hyatt but my best friend prefers the Four Seasons. Hyatt, then Four Seasons, then Walker Brothers, then Bongo Room or Yolk, then IHOP ( an example scale of where Bongo Room lies in taste and quality relative to other eateries.  of course, price is higher at Hyatt and Four Seasons, though actually not by much! )",0.9982,0.767,0.174,0.059,0.5666805879305881

At Bongo Room, I've had the red velvet pancakes, the chocolate tower french toast, the chorizo omelette, and this weekend, the croissant sandwich...bottom line, every bite of every meal has been essentially perfect, and I've taken about 15 different people there, and each time two things have happened: everyone agrees that the food is incredible, and everyone agrees that there's too much food on the plate (on this recent visit, four of my friends tried to take leftovers out before realizing that they should never take breakfast food home to try and reheat). Like everyone else who is in the know, take the advice of showing up to wait in line with your entire party at 8:30 AM if you have a party of more than two people.  Otherwise, you really can slide in here at other times of the day on the weekend with two people and not wait too long (30-45 minutes) and the bar turns over frequently. Just be prepared for the Bongo waitstaff to hover over your table as soon as you finish your meal/last cup of coffee so they can get other hungry people into the space.  It's not rude...it's business at a busy restaurant in America.  If you want to hang out for an hour and talk smack with your friends after you eat, no sweat, just do it in Europe!!",0.9902,0.846,0.139,0.015,0.38804347826086966

Our strategy is simple: hubby and I split one savory and one sweet dish, usually the two eggs and meat or the make-your-own omelette.  The real dilemma is whether to get a whole stack or half stack of pancakes.  This is one of the few places in Chicago that has perfected the pancake - fluffy, delicious, and not soggy or bogged down by the sides and sauce.  I usually smother regular pancakes with both butter and syrup, but Bongo Room pancakes stand alone with the accompanying sauce...no need for additions!   And the combinations are phenomenal.  My all-time favorite is the banana toffee crunch pancakes, which I haven't seen on the menu for a while.  Please bring them back Bongo Room!  A close second are the white chocolate & caramel pretzel pancakes.  Other flavors have come and gone, but have not made an indelible impression on my stomach (and thus my heart) as those two.

I am a French toast person, and the one on the menu sounded so good, but I went with the red velvet hotcakes to be ""adventurous.""

I had heard a lot of really great things about their sweet offerings before going there, so a friend and I decided to split an order of red velvet pancakes and choose a couple other items on the savory side. This turned out to be a brilliant idea ultimately, as the red velvet pancakes, while good, were almost too decadent for my liking. I quite liked the pancakes themselves; they were incredibly fluffy with a nice, balanced chocolate flavor that was not too overpowering or too weak.However, the sauce used was a bit too cloying for my taste (trying the vanilla bean sauce used was comparable to chomping down on a vanilla candle from Yankee Candle, minus the waxiness). I dont know, maybe I just don't have a big enough sweet tooth but the pancakes were just not my jam. However, the eggs were phenomenal. I'm a huge fan of eggs, and the tomatillo salsa scramble was great. Really deliciously innovative and done right (and by done right I mean cooked to perfection and more than plenty avocado within). The potatoes are pretty good too, but nothing too special. So, overall: great breakfast food, huge portions, unconventional (but really freakin' good) offerings, and cool atmosphere.

Yes, there is a wait.  Sometimes over an hour. 3 tips on how to deal with it: 1- show up 5-10 minutes before they open at 9am.

The wait to eat at The Bongo Room can be quite long, but in all honesty, the staff makes up for it in excellent service (the hostess works SO hard to make sure that people outside get a fair chance to claim their spot that they've waited for), SUPERQUICK bussing of tables (these two people got up from sitting next to me and my friends, and I SWEAR there was a new couple there AT A CLEAN AND DRESSED TABLE within 90 seconds) and such a wonderful, awesome and varying menu (*fans self*). I had the Pumpkin & Carrot Spice Hotcakes, which I think is a seasonal item.  If heaven has a specific taste, those pancakes had to be somewhere close if not it.  A friend of mine had the Red Velvet Pancakes and they were amazing as well. I also had an Omelette where I chose the toppings.  The freshness of the ingredients and the rustic redskin house potatoes really appealed to my personal sense of great tasting food with functional looks. Personally, I'm thrilled how they dress their pancakes.  The sauces take it a step further than your traditional breakfast offerings and it truly makes breakfast a special experience. Price wise, you could be looking at roughly $25 per person to have a nice meal (without an alcoholic drink, but throw coffee in there). If you came to this page to decide whether or not to go the Bongo Room, ask yourself this question: do I want breakfast, or do I want a breakfast EXPERIENCE?  If you answered the former, The Golden Nugget will do you just fine.  If you answered the latter, run, don't walk to The Bongo Room.

The host staff usually seems overwhelmed and confused. The wait staff doesn't seem to care to be personable at all. They also tend to be rude. I think because the place gets such huge crowds - they believe that merits them to rush through everything and be rude so as to hurry a table up and out.

We got to the restaurant and when the host asked us why we had said our party was ready when it wasn't, we made up an elaborate story about how we drove from the coffee shop and our friend somehow got lost. For an hour. Across two blocks. We tried recruiting a stranger to pretend to be our fifth, but apparently the hipsters in Wicker Park are a bunch of lame party poopers and they refused. We kept checking in with the host and telling him to give our table away, but he seemed determined to catch us in our lie and insisted he'd have our table ready. By the end, about an hour had passed since we told the host we were ready and we had changed our story to incorporate a fender bender, seeing as how that would be the only plausible explanation for why it took so long. It was either that or telling him she had gone into labor, despite not being pregnant. Alien abduction? We're not exactly criminal masterminds here. Anyways, when our friend finally arrived she looked fittingly frazzled, and the host took pity on us and even commented on what an ordeal she must have gone through. Our lie had paid off. And even though we can probably never show our faces at this place again, it was worth it, because dammit if their food isn't good. How can you not love a place that serves red velvet pancakes. Yeah, you read that right. Red velvet pancakes. It's like somebody read my list of fantasy foods and turned one into a reality.

The wait was about 30 minutes so we grabbed coffee nearby before we sat down. The place was completely packed and people were practically eating elbow to elbow. The restaurant was echoing from the nonstop chatter at every table. When my friend and I finally got seated at a table, it was an awkward spot near the door.  We quickly ordered the Tomatillo Salsa Scramble which was probably more on the healthy side since it had egg whites in it. Since my friend and I are girls and don't eat very much, we decided to split that dish and we also ordered two side caesar salads. The food was okay. I mean it's an egg white scramble... there isn't really too much to do to jazz it up without it losing its' sole purpose of being healthy. I shouldn't have expected very much since we did order something that was on the healthier side. No big deal. The annoying thing was that there was table next to us in the corner and the server had to keep squeezing past my friend's chair to get through. Why are you going to put tables like that when you have to keep asking a customer to move so you can get through? It got super annoying and our server wasn't very nice to us either. I understand it's busy, but you should still slap a smile on your face and pretend to like your job. This was probably one of the worst places we went to during our Chicago trip.

Only facial expressions and sounds. ...And I'm definitely making that sound right now just thinking about how great breakfast was at The Bongo Room. My friend and I checked this place out on a lazy Saturday morning. I think we missed the rushed, arriving just before noon. We immediately scored sweet seats right in the front of the restaurant at a high-top. Although I feel like I was decor-roadkill (like fashion-roadkill, but more tragic because it's not your fault), I loved the look of this place. The pull out chairs (as opposed to the bench) aren't exactly conducive to sitting properly at your table unless you know magic that allows you to scoot yourself in without having Stretch Armstrong legs. Fortunately, that's the only bad thing I have to say about The Bongo Room. Oh, and my friend would prefer hand towels in the washroom so that he doesn't have to touch the handles. ...and the parking situation could be better, but they're working on it, sooo... Everything else was FAN-tastic! My friend had the red velvet pancakes, and even after the gentleman sitting next to us told him specifically not to get the full order, he got the full order. It was like having an entire red velvet cake for breakfast. They were so thick and rich, after the bite that I stole from him, I was SO done with them. I had the vegetarian croissant sandwich. It was delicious. I would recommend getting the eggs a different way (I had them scrambled) as that would probably keep the sandwich together a little better. However, the sandwich was still good as it was. The potatoes that came on the side were seasoned to perfection and cooked just the right amount. It was a great breakfast for the both of us. I would also suggest splitting a savory item and a sweet item if you're dining with a friend. The portions are so large that it's difficult (unless you've been held captive for a week without being fed) to finish any one dish on your own. You may as well get a little of both flavors.

2012-05-27,2.0,"I still don't get it. After an intentional hiatus of several years, I came back here yesterday to visit with some old friends whom I don't see very often.  That was the only factor which made the long wait tolerable. We checked in at 10:50 and were seated at 11:35.  At the time that we were about to be seated, I heard them quoting newcomers 60 to 90 minutes.  The hype machine rolls on, I guess.  I don't understand why people make this a destination.  There are so many other options nearby, not to mention other neighborhoods. My breakfast was bad.  Not ""just okay"" but bad.  For some reason my dish came out about five minutes after the rest of the table's, so I'm not sure what was going on back there.  I ordered the rock shrimp benedict and asked for the remoulade hollandaise on the side after seeing benedicts going to other tables drenched in sauce.  The sauce turned out to be fine and in fact I also used it on my breakfast potatoes.  But the benedict was awful.  The english muffins were limp and chewy and the shrimp were tough and rubbery.  Also, the dish was nearly tasteless.  A sparing application of the hollandaise added some flavor, but when your main ingredients cannot stand on their own without a dousing of sauce, you have a problem. I do have to say that the single lemon ricotta & sour cherry pancake that I ordered for ""dessert"" was damn good.  Way too sweet, but damn good. The service was adequate but lacked personality.  Some of us enjoy a little happiness with their weekend brunch, you know? In the attic of my mind, this place seems like a relic of the early aughts.  I associate it with a time in my life before I knew anything about decent restaurants, in the pre-pre-Yelp era, and in the years before a plethora of spots sprung up to accommodate this town's brunch obsession.  Now, there are so many better options, all with shorter waits.  When I dated a girl who was a brunch nut but only knew a few places, and later when I had friends who lived nearby for a couple of years, I would shrug and find myself tagging along to the Bongo Room.  But now that I know better and usually control my own brunch destiny, there is no reason to come here and suffer long waits for mediocre food.  Except to catch up with some good friends.  For that I would be willing to go anywhere.",0.9482,0.806,0.114,0.08,0.4908298826777088

The hubby had an omelet.  Pretty standard.  The house potatoes were rather disappointing.  They were not very crispy and they were seasoned with dill.  Which was a flavor out of left field for me, I was not feeling it.

Let's be real, I'm not going to wait an hour for pancakes, no matter how delicious they look.  I ended up free on a Friday morning, and decided to hit up Bongo Room in hopes that on a weekday there wouldn't be a wait. My boo and I hit up Bongo Room at around 9:30 on Friday morning and there was no wait at all. The place was still relatively full, but if you want to check this place out without waiting, definitely come on a weekday. I had been drooling over the white chocolate caramel pretzel pancakes since I first saw a picture of them on Yelp, so I didn't hesitate to order them. My boo has no sweet tooth and ordered some sort of breakfast croissant sandwich dealy. In my imagination, these pancakes tasted awesome. In reality, they were just OK. I definitely wouldn't get them again. They were light and fluffy, but after about half of my plate I just got sick of the taste. My boo was unimpressed with her breakfast sammich, and didn't see the appeal of the place. At the end of the day, I'd say be wary of having too high expectations when visiting The Bongo Room. The dishes all look pretty, and obviously take skill to execute, but between all the hype and the pretty pictures on Yelp something was just missing on my visit.  The Bongo Room will most certainly not be taking a spot among my favorite Chicago breakfast spots.

2012-03-02,3.0,"Here's the thing - Bongo Room was one of my first Chicago brunch experiences EVER, about 2 years ago.  What I realized this past weekend was that while my initial dining experience here was *really* good... I had over-hyped it in my head. Here I am two years later and I've sampled plenty of other Chicago brunches to know that Bongo Room is in fact delicious, but not all that it's hyped up to be.  I would have given it 3.5 stars if half stars were permitted in the ranking.  Here's my assessment: FOOD - reall good.  the first time i went, all i remember was the tower of french toast (it was new year's day morning, so we ordered that as an ""appetizer"" for the table).  we were not disappointed.  the hand-shaved chocolate flowers adorning the tower were pretty cool. - most recently my boyfriend and i split the vegetarian croissant sandwich (egg sandwich on a deliciously flaky croissant packed with yummy veggies and mayo pesto), and the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes.  The pancakes were good, but super heavy.  They come in an order of three large ones, and they are just so dense the two of us had trouble making it through more than one each. SERVICE - prompt and attentive, though it's clear they try and get people in and out of there as quickly as possible to turn over tables.  i can't blame them for wanting to keep things rolling, but i always find it annoying whent he server walks by and drops the check on your table without asking if you wanted anything else. WAIT - the wait time just isn't worth it.  I got here at 9:30am on a Sunday and still had to wait 35 minutes to be seated.  By the time I sad down, the wait was up to an hour.  Again, Bongo Room is good... but not THAT good.  There are just so many other good options out there that you do not need to wait an hour here! All in all it's a great place to visit... just not worth a super long wait, and frankly i'm not sure when there's not a super long wait!",0.9951,0.79,0.167,0.044,0.5180828215711938

Large and stuffed with either sweet potatoes and black beans or traditional eggs and guacamole these two options will definitely leave you full and happy.  With regards to the complaints about wait time: Good things come to those who wait! So wait it out and you won't be disappointed! Quick Tip: Both the pancakes and french toast can be ordered in single servings eliminating the need to pick just one!!  To summarize: Although I miss living in Chicago, I really, really miss weekend brunches at the Bongo Room and have yet to find any place comparable in Minneapolis or otherwise.",0.992,0.697,0.221,0.081,0.5742698412698413

I can't imagine it getting any better than this. The standard fare (omelettes, breakfast burritos, etc.) are phenominally tasty, using fresh & properly seasononed meats & veggies. However, what really stole the show for me were the more dessert-like breakfasts. Chocolate stuffed french toast - Oh my. This was ridiculously good. The flavor was so rich and the presentation so, well presented? I took a picture of it and e-mailed it to all of my friends back west to make them jealous. I spent six days in Chicago, a land of many awesome restaurants, and had to go back a second time by myself: It was that good. I had white chocolate and caramel covered pretzel pancakes. WTF?

We ordered the Reuben with a Caesar salad and also the Pumpkin Pancakes. The Reuben and Caesar were fairly decent, in fact they were pretty amazing until I tried the pancakes!  The Pumpkin Pancakes almost made me slap myself!  The pancakes themselves were so thick and dense filled with chunk of gooey chocolate.  The vanilla creme on top was heavenly!  I could die happy after eating those godly pancakes!  I am a bona fide pancake lover and make pretty darn good pancakes myself, but I have never tasted better pancakes in my life!  I could eat them for a week straight and love 'em more and more each day!  Thank you Alex for this recommendation!

So some lady friends and I planned to go around noon on a Saturday, so fully aware of wait times, one who lives nearby went about hour early to put our names in. They told her it'd be about an hour and a half, so we decided to meet and share mimosas at her place before heading over. We headed over at the appropriate time and were told it'd be longer. Other groups of different sizes in a non-seemingly logical way were being called (couples, then groups of 6 etc), while our group of 4 continued to wait. We were thankful for a nice day but urged the original friend to go back in and ask about us. Apparently the host had not forgotten about us and when he finally sat us, we got apologies and two pancakes on the house.  So the food was pretty great. The free pancakes were the famous pretzel hot cake and a pancake with cinnamon apple business going on. They were good. Very dense and unlike fluffy pancakes I usually get. Super sweet and perfect for sharing while we waited. I ordered the beef tenderloin Benedict, which had great flavor. Unfortunately, I found the meat a little tough to cut. House potatoes were good. They came with all the meals, and all of us friends enjoyed them. Is the menu seasonal? I wish the waitress explained, but I assumed so since the menu said a big ""fall 2011"" on the top. That could be interesting.

Larger groups are highly discouraged unless you go during the weekday. I love the decor of this place. I especially loved the light blue tiled wallpaper with the candle sconces. I also love the fact that the wall had niches to store your coats and belongings in while you are dining. I had the Tomatillo which consisted of grilled chicken, egg whites, avocado, your choice of bread (I chose the whole grain bread), sliced tomatoes, spinach, and I ordered an additional side of potatoes. It was really good. I was impressed by the fact that I did not have to ask them to substitute the egg whites since it is a healthier solution. Also, I had a sample of my friend's red velvet pancackes. It was very delicious.

Lowlights: --Service and Crowd/Noise -- It's VERY popular on weekends; it's on my running route and I have to cut through a substantial crowd outside each Saturday/Sunday.  That being said, our hostess could have been a bit less hostile.  Also, when I have to yell across a table while hungover at brunch to overcome the noise, I'm not a happy camper.  The unfriendly staff and long wait are the #1 reason this doesn't deserve 4 stars.

She told me that they have red velvet pancakes, so it was an EASY decision to have brunch here. They didn't have the red velvet pancakes on the menu the day I was there, but they had an impressive list of yummy pancake dishes to choose from. I was close to choosing the strawberry-banana pancakes after seeing another diner at another table with a big fat stack covered with juicy looking strawberries, but my stomach told me to go with the banana-heath bar pancakes. Listen to your stomachs people, for they are most wise. The wait for the food wasn't bad, but the anticipation was nearly killing me. I sipped a tasty mango flavored iced tea while I waited. The friendly waitress brought both my friend & I gigantic plates with equally gigantic pancakes, covered in plump slices of banana & a butter toffee cream sauce. We also got the hash browns, which were chunky red-skin potatoes cooked to a heavenly crisp. I also added bacon as a side, because no pancake should go without bacon.  But oh those pancakes.  They looked so scrumptious I had to take a couple of sexy pictures of them before I dug in. I'm posting them for your delight! The sauce on top was a perfect compliment to the perfectly ripe bananas & the moist cakes; I didn't even THINK about syrup. Eating that delicious breakfast made my entire face happy.

Now actually I didn't eat cake - but their red velvet pancakes were just as delicious if not more! Big, fluffy, moist, full of flavor and warm when served - I was too anxious for these big bad boys that I picked up the forks the moment our server came out with the plates!  But about 10 minutes earlier, I was debating between a breakfast burrito and strawberry banana pancakes. I asked our awesome server which one he'd recommend, and thank God to his honesty, he said: ""If the strawberry banana pancake is your choice of pancake, I'd recommend going with the burrito. It's not the best of our pancakes.""  What could I have say in response to that? Except to step up my game and order the red velvet pancake - I felt like I was morally obligated to do that! But hey, the red velvet pancake is perhaps one of their most famous brunch item. And they did not disappoint! Each piece was big, and it made me think of a layer of a cake - topped with vanilla sauce and walnuts - yes I ate a mini wedding cake for breakfast!!!! And I'd do it over and over again if I could!  But that's not the only highlight of my breakfast there - my dinning partner got the chorizo and avocado omelet, and it was delicious! It came with house potatoes, toast and this to-die-for salsa, which was, well, to-die-for! I'm not too crazy about chorizo, but everything else about that dish was super! Now to the stuff you really want to know about:  1. How long was the wait? about 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad. We got there at around 9:30am, so we might have been the luckier ones. But people were coming in and out, so I'd say the wait isn't as bad as people make it to be.  2. How was the services? Excellent. Waiter = awesomeness! He had on collection of cool T and sweater (extra point), and he recommended something that changed my life (well not quite but close).  3. Was it really up to the hype? Yes, absolutely. And more!

So when I attempted the Bongo this Labor Day morning with some friends knowing that it was more famous for its pancakes and the like than its salty and hearty options, my expectations weren't particularly high to begin with. We had to wait an hour and twenty minutes for a table. Whatever, it's a holiday. We'd have to wait anywhere we go and bless the staff who come in to work on a national holiday. The service was excellent throughout the meal. The waitress refilled our coffees diligently, was prompt but didn't make us feel rushed, and was friendly without being overbearing. No complaints there. It is a kind of strange atmosphere, though-- like it's trying to be hip but just misses the mark in a way you can't quite explain. Maybe it's the color scheme-- the dull, unappetizing blues and greens make Bongo's seem more like a suburban hair salon than a city eatery.  My three friends respectively ordered orange-ricotta griddlecakes, the chocolate french toast stack, and eggs benedict. I got an egg white omelet with mozzarella, basil, tomato, and chicken sausage. The griddlecakes were alright, but they were intensely sweet, even with the ginger butter on the side. My girlfriend liked them for the first few bites, but really couldn't finish more than one of them. My omelet was mediocre-- the sausage was flavorless, the eggs a touch overcooked, the mozzarella unexceptional. Y'all, for a year I had a student job making omelets in my college cafeteria, and for all that I didn't give the remotest shit about that job, I made more tender and flavorful omelets. It's not that hard. After dousing that puppy in Cholula it was alright, but I wish it had had some bite and flavor on its own. To Bongo's credit, my other two friends really enjoyed their entrees. It's not that the food was awful. It was hugely portioned and entirely edible-- akin to what you might expect out of a 24-hour diner. Yet there's a certain price point at which my expectations start to change. The omelet was $15.  For $15 an entree, I could have eaten at Lula or Birchwood Kitchen, both of which have wowed me with their offerings. At Longman and Eagle last weekend I got a phenomenal duck confit hash with the most delectable potatoes and tender duck meat and finger-licking sauce for $2 less than I paid today.

We all split the caramel cream pancakes (I think) which were stuffed with pretzel crumbs. It's a pretty interesting idea and that was more of a dish to be shared as a dessert. The coffee was way too strong. Restaurants should always stick with a medium blend and not french roast on crack. The service was good and unrushed perhaps because they were not in need of additional tables. The thing that bugs me is the high prices. Charging $13 for eggs benedict is too high. I would expect to pay that in a nice hotel not in a neighborhood spot. Coffee is $2.75 a cup and because of its strength you really avoid getting a refill. If you do, just one. Great racket guys!

2011-08-22,4.0,"We ate at the Bongo Room for brunch during a recent trip to Chicago, and I've been hearing about this place from my brother-in-law, his girlfriend, and my husband (who ate there on a previous trip). The wait on Sunday at 9am was 40 minutes, but we made use of the Starbucks located down the street during our wait.  The place is pretty small, so you can see why with any decent crowd that there'd be a wait. The staff ask that you order once only (no re-ordering or adding to your order) so that they can have as quick a turnover as possible. As soon as all your food comes out, they put the ticket down on your table so that you can take care of it as soon as you're done eating. It's also quite distracting that as soon as you finish any glass/plate that there's immediately someone to pull it away -- almost sometimes as soon as you put it down. Beware if you're someone who likes to take their leisurely time finishing every morsel on your plate. My husband and I both got the breakfast croissant sandwiches which were tasty, but not over-the-top.

My wife usually gets the breakfast burrito and potatoes. I actually really like the potatoes. Whenever we have out of town guests, we always bring them here. There is always a line. We came at 10am and waited an hour for a table of 4. I do wish the place was bigger because the line sucks and it's always packed. But the food is delicious and worth the wait.

First, the red velvet pancakes. When I tell you that these were the richest most fluffy pancakes I've ever had, please believe me. Wow. They were simply delicious and the fact that they weren't too sweet really allows you to enjoy their flavor. I, like many people love anything red velvet, and these pancakes did not disappoint.  But the star of the show was the BLT eggs benedict. They were cooked to perfection AND come with spinach and thick cut apple smoked bacon. I think that's pretty much all you need to know.

To top it off, she also has the worst luck when she is the customer.  For the most part she always ends up getting the worst dish and service whenever we dine in a group or with family.  I was hoping that Bongo Room could turn this curse around...they did, but they did snag.  Anyway, to the food.  We arrived there two Tuesdays ago around 12:30; the place was bumping, but we were seated within a minute. We both ordered coffee to start off and our waitres was friendly and allowed us plenty of breathing space to narrow down our food options. We both selected out of their special menu which consisted of the omelet with chicken breast, avocado, tomatillo salsa, cheese and spinsh. I selected the brioche french toast with rasperry puree, cream, and chocholate crumble.  I was initially hesistant about my decision since I am a huge fan of a good balance breakfast that includes a portion of eggs, but I went with my gut. Both of our plates come out in a timely fashion--but to my dismay, they ran out of spinach and they asked my mother if they could substitue with basil; she agreed.  Both plates were aesthetically pleasing and my mother really enjoyed that her food was nice and hot--she did complain about the quality of the basill however, for being Mexican; she realy enjoyed her dish and the tomatillo salsa (which later on inspired her own breakfast twist).  And, my selection was superb.  The dish was not overly sweet and I almost killed my whole dish.  It was a great balance, the vanilla sauce complimented the rasperry and chocolate crumble. My only complaint would be texture.   My rating is closer to a 4.5, however my momma raves with a 5 star rating...so 5 it is!

2011-06-05,4.0,"A friend and I wanted to try out a new brunch place, as we often look to The Bristol for our Sunday morning adventures.  We heard excellent things about The Bongo Room and decided to give it a shot. I was slightly apprehensive on the ride over.  We were told that oftentimes folks can wait up to two hours to get a table.  As a precautionary measure, we arrived at 8:45am, fifteen minutes before their schedule opening.  A smattering of bleary-eyed brunchers were waiting outside discussing which dish they were going to order (and what mistakes they made the night before).  There was a particularly amusing, OCD-inclined woman hell-bent on creating a line that made this short wait more entertaining.  My initial worries were quashed when we were let in at 9am and seated immediately.   Our server was fairly standard.  She managed to get everything to us on time, warm and with a half-smile.  There were a few moments where I felt as though she could have chosen a warmer approach but, all-in-all, she was decent. The quality of the food was excellent.  It became abundantly clear that inventive combinations of fresh ingredients make this place unique.  I ordered the BLT Benedict w/ pesto hollandaise sauce and a side of roasted rosemary potatoes.  My friend had the Breakfast Burrito and a single side of Chocolate French Toast.  My chief complaint, however, is that these dishes were extremely hearty and filling.  As I walked to the bathroom, I saw another dude with some berry pancakes, overflowing over the sides of his place.  Most people don't have that kind of appetite in the morning.  I know I certainly don't.  I'd recommend cutting down the portion sizes and saving the need for to-go boxes.  If you're not going to have paper towels in the bathroom (seemingly to save paper), why not eliminate the need for boxed leftovers as well? BOTTOM LINE:  This is definitely on my list of great brunch places in Chicago.  While the portion size is at times overwhelming, the innovative culinary creations make it worth a trip.  Get there before it opens to limit any stress caused by having to wait!",0.9924,0.811,0.156,0.033,0.5256307665398574

Red velvet pancake was impressive and not just because it was red velvet.  The pancake consistency is the best I've had (that I can remember).  I don't normally enjoy pancakes from breakfast places because they're just okay, but this pancake was amazing.  The texture and consistency was ridiculous.  I can't even comment on how legit tasting the red velvet flavor was because I was so impressed by the pancake consistency.  We actually got another pancake dish per our server's recommendation, but it was not memorable compared to the deliciousness of the red velvent pancake. When you're ordering, keep in mind that the portions are large and in charge, esp. the pancakes.  We could've done without the 2nd pancake order.",0.9959,0.695,0.275,0.03,0.5195767195767196

I ordered an omelet with bacon, mushrooms and swiss.  My friend ordered the croissant sandwich, which has egg, bacon and muenster.  The food took a little while to arrive, but that's to be expected for how busy they were.  Once we were handed our plates, the food looked good, the hash browns that came with each order were perfectly cut potatoes sprinkled with rosemary and salt.  My omelet looked great, and my friends croissant was golden and flaky.  However, once we started eating we both realized that the food was all look and texture, no flavor.  The eggs were boring, the bacon in my omelet wasn't crispy but it wasn't too soft either, it was just hard and flavorless.  And I love bacon, like most sane people, so how are you going to serve mediocre bacon?!  The potatoes were just starchy and the spices seemed to be non existent, even though like they were thoroughly spiced.  We are both big fans of salty breakfast, and after looking around at other plates we realized that perhaps, The Bongo Room serves better sweets for brunch.  I would probably go back again, but I would definitely not order the same thing.",0.994,0.782,0.173,0.045,0.5731452455590387

So we ordered 2 different kinds, and even got an omelet. (definitely suggest doing this, since their pancakes, though delicious, are quite heavy, and I dont know what we would have done if we got 3 of each)  We got one pancake that was white chocolate cream cheese with berries, and another with cream and caramel. The pancake itself was very fluffy and thick, and the cream was suprisingly not overbearingly sweet. But very heavy, so I had a small slice of each and was happy. You can choose 3 toppings for your omelet (we got spinach, mushroom, and chicken sausage).

2011-04-23,5.0,"This is by no means somewhere you'll want to go every single weekend (because you'd probably end up doubling your weight in like, two months), but it's a great place to go for a kicked-up-a-notch brunch once in a while.

The Bongo Room's food runs the gamut from traditional (omelettes) to extremely creative (chocolate tower french toast). The menu changes seasonally, meaning you're unlikely to have the same thing twice. I like that in a restaurant. smoked duck breast eggs benedict: Brandon's dish...amazing. I typically don't like duck all that much, but this was seasoned and cooked perfectly: full bodied, hearty and decadent ( The eggs in combination with the duck were rich, but not greasy like you'd expect.  The dill breakfast potatoes that come with it are a refreshing take on hashbrowns (you can't go wrong with fresh herbs). french toast w/ creme anglaise, bananas & walnuts: this dish was insanely rich. I literally only got through about a third of it before I had to stop (but that's okay, it made a lovely dessert a couple of days later). The toast itself was custardy and soft, the bananas were deliciously caramelized, and the creme anglaise was just sweet enough without making me feel like my teeth were going to fall out. raspberry pear mimosa:  I was feeling like a breakfast beverage, and this did just the trick.  The raspberry and pear flavors are extremely fresh (read: they clearly don't use gross bottled flavored syrups), and whatever champagne they used was a decent quality. Normally, I'd protest paying $8 for a mimosa, but this one was delicious and larger than a normal glass of champagne. I think it was worth it. Tables are a bit close together (but not uncomfortably so), and when the restaurant is at it's most crowded it seems as though the various conversations going on throughout the restaurant make for a cheery, bright vibe.

My omelet was great, even though I'm pretty sure I'd fall in love with anything with loads of fresh avocado. The chocolate tower french toast, though. Jesus Christ that thing was delicious. The chocolate bread is dense and bitter enough to hold up against the sauce and the bananas, and it's the best example of dessert for breakfast that I've ever had. By the way, why aren't there breakfast small plates places? I feel like it makes perfect sense to have plates of eggs benedict, waffles, cinnamon rolls, ham, potatoes, etc. to pass around.

The white chocolate caramel pancakes are unreal. Probably not something I could ever order as my main meal (the 4), but the one pancake shared b/w friends is a perfect sweet addition to your meal.

My friends had the traditional eggs benedict, one of the breakfast burritos, and we shared one red velvet pancake. With our coffee the bill came to nearly $50 for three people (I'm not used to Chicago prices, clearly.).  We learned a valuable lesson - if you want to try one pancake (which they offer up) know that the one pancake will cost 75% of what a full stack would be.

We ordered the oreo pancakes, the pretzel pancakes with white chocolate and caramel, the red velvet cakes, the chorizo omelet, the brioche french toast, the egg whites with tomatillo sauce and a couple orders of hash browns (that's what the menu called it, but they are breakfast potatoes).  The oreo pancakes include one whole oreo and, it seemed at least one whole banana sliced on top. The pancakes themselves seemed to be plain under a dusting of oreo crumbs, chocolate and cream.  And, they were better with their topping then without. The pancakes seemed somewhat dry and flavorless when removed from their dessert like decoration.  The pretzel pancakes were filled with pretzels--really filled and covered with caramel and white chocolate. The caramel didn't have much flavor. The white chocolate was very sweet and rich but I liked the plain pancakes with the pretzels best on their own. They were crunchy, salty and seemed suitable for breakfast.  I would like to order them sans topping.  The french toast was the best dish we tried.  The brioche is light, not greasy and very tasty and covered with caramelized pears (lots of them and in slices not chopped up) and a dusting of oatmeal.  Very tasty.  The sides of potatoes  are tossed with herbs and were actually fairly fresh, an accomplishment with this type of potatoes which tend to sit on the back of the grill and get poorly reheated. These were good, tender red potatoes. But, I wasn't so fond of the dill on the potatoes. They serve might leaf tea which just isn't strong enough for me.  The intelligentsia coffee was just okay.  The egg whites with tomatillo sauce had a very slimy texture as egg whites are want to do. But the sauce was good and I liked it with the avocado and potato sides.  It's served with big slices of tomato which might be a great addition when tomatoes are in season.  The omelet with chorizo was fine.  Overall, I would say the restaurant does what it promises: big servings of dessert like breakfasts efficiently served.",0.9971,0.798,0.185,0.018,0.44005693581780553

However, I suggest ordering only one or two of a specific pancake or French toast so you can sample more of their fantastic offerings. This past visit, I had one pumpkin spice pancake with brown sugar cream mousse and glazed pecans ($5), one caramelized apple pancake with praline cream and toasted walnuts ($5), one white chocolate caramel pretzel pancake ($5), and one slice of chocolate bread French toast ($6.25). The pancakes are deliciously rich, sweet, over-the-top. The chocolate bread French toast is a chocolate lover's dream. The smoked duck breast benedict  ($14.25) and BLT eggs benedict ($13.75) were deemed worthy as well. The portions are large. During prime brunch hours, expect to wait. The wait is worth it. They don't encourage waiting inside so you have to retreat to your car or nearby shops during the cold months. Water and coffee are constantly replenished, and bussers eagerly clear your table of finished plates. Available street parking. The south loop location is awesome, too.",0.9919,0.776,0.212,0.012,0.4967942176870749

My bf had the Chorizo omelet. It was really tastey! The portions were also huge.  There was just enough flavor, not bland and not salty.  The potatoes were also full of herbs. Yummy! I had the red velvet hot cakes. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but man am I glad I ordered these hot cakes! They were soooo goood!! I wish we had these in Cali!!!

A perfect, pristine morning of sunshine and cool breezes. A cardio scupting class followed by an intense, Im-going-to-throw up abs class. My heart was pounding with excitement on the North Ave bus heading with my friend to Bongo Room for brunch; a reward for our insane workout. The wait was 20/25 minutes...I was starving. I couldnt even wait for a hot, steaming cup of coffee. A two-seater table opened up and it was ours, all ours. Where do I even begin with the menu, not to mention their specials. I was overwhelmed by the amount delicious words popping out of the menu at me: creme, mousse, glazed, praline, walnut, orea, vanilla, apple spice, cinnamon, its all even too much to think about. Im salivating while I type. If its one thing I ask, please, Bongo Room, PLEASE keep the Pretzel batter pancake with ooey gooey hot caramel and white chocolate sauce on the standard menu....not just as a special for the season!! I cant live without it. Ive never tasted something so good in my life. And yes, we ACTUALLY compared it to sex. As my friend so perfectly put it, our meal was a food orgasm.

2010-11-14,3.0,"Weekend brunch got back!  The silver lining about a rather boring Halloween party the night before was that I was up early enough to make it to Wicker park on Sun morning, beating the other revelers to the start of the line for the Bongo Room. It turned out to be only a 30 minute wait and that was comfortably spent gazing at the cute bakeries and restaurants that stud the stretch of Milwaukee avenue.  Got back to the Bongo Room in time to snag a perfect spot by the window and kick off a nice Sun brunch. The Chocolate French toast was a leading contender until I saw it actually being brought out for another table and the thing was humongous! With no chance of sharing something that rich with my friend, I decided to step it down a notch and picked another delicious seasonal french toast with praline cream, caramelized pears and pecans - it was rich but ridiculously good!  The menu at the Bongo Room isn't as extensive as what you might get in some other places in the city but seasonal faves done fabulously well more than compensates for the somewhat limited choice. Add to that a comfortable, friendly, bustling environ and a friendly staff - it definitely makes for a pleasant way to start a weekend afternoon.",0.9908,0.744,0.214,0.042,0.5304050355774493

2010-11-02,2.0,"Attended: Oct, 31st, 2010. 12pmish. Party of 8 First of all, this place is highly overrated. I've heard so many great things about this place and I was severely disappointed.  Pros: I didn't mind the wait because the Worm Hole is a couple doors down, and they have rocking coffee and an awesome ambiance. Check them out. At any rate The Bongo Room's wait was 1 hr, which to me meant that it must have been a hot location. The menu is quite creative and the ingredients are quite good. Bussers were really nice and were very helpful throughout the meal.  Cons: The server that we had for our meal was not as friendly as she could have been. She barely only came back to the table and wasn't helpful at at. When it seems like you do not want to help a customer that doesn't sit well with me. The space in this place ins't adequate for large groups, and there were too many two and four top tables. Three booths in the back that cannot comfortably sit 8 doesn't cut it either. The flavors of the food missed completely. It wasn't that great to be perfectly honest, it was simply meh. The tastiest portion of the meal? The potatoes were seasoned well. As someone who doesn't like hollandaise or pancakes and waffles doused with sugar and chocolate I wasn't impressed with the menu offerings. Whereas they were creative they wasn't enough for everyone. Brunch drinks are way overpriced and complete profit generators for the restaurant. Not to mention the $15 per person ticket price for breakfast. The kitchen staff looks very undertrained for a busy Sunday morning. Especially I noticed that the hollandaise wasn't kept in a proper place to keep a safe holding temperature. Above the ranges near the hoods, sucks temperature out of items and the kitchen. I realize it's to keep the hollandaise at a decent temp, without breaking it. But you shouldn't cut costs at a price of your customers health. Also with large groups they charge gratuity. If they do this to you, and service isn't up to par. You don't have to pay the gratuity. This doesn't make the service staff work better, it makes them work less.   Overall I'd say there are other places for a good breakfast on a Sunday. The price just wasn't worth the flavor and the ambiance of this place. Seems like people just wait in line because it's supposed to be good. You could argue that quality is a factor, however it's not that much better than IHOP or Denny's in comparison.Not to mention I could get a better tasting meal there. For good breakfast go to Clarke's on Belmont. You'll save money, and have a better meal.",0.9957,0.769,0.171,0.06,0.5091798941798944

The restaurant is rather large and has large group booth seating in the back.  There are only two bathrooms in the back.

Personally, two eggs (in any style) on an english muffin should never be more than $10. What is up with this weird better-than-thou pricing? I got a breakfast burrito that was stuffed with essentially a four-egg omelette and diced half of an avocado. A slice of cheese was slightly melted on top of the burrito casing. Overall, just the salsa that was served on the side was yummy. It was just lacking. It needed some herbs. Then, my husband and friend both got hot apple ciders that they serve in a tall glass and a straw. Don't they know how hot the liquid is and how impossible it is to hold the glass without burning yourself? I actually burnt my tongue because my hubby asked me to try it. And without knowing that it was hot, I sipped from the straw... and well you figure it out. Hot drinks never get straws. They get handles on a mug.

2010-09-12,5.0,"Well it's my oldest daughters birthday, 22 years already. Where has the time gone? I still remember, just like it was yesterday, her sleeping in her little crib right next to the bed my wife and I would sleep in, in our little, one bedroom apartment.  In our family we always pick a place, so where did my daughter decide she wanted to go for her birthday meal, The Bongo Room. I have tried twice before to experience The Bongo Room but to no avail. The wait is usually at least an hour plus long, and that's just too long to wait.  Well this time we are told the wait will be just 40 minutes, but to check back in 20 minutes. So we wander around the neighborhood for a little bit and low and behold we get our table in 20 minutes. That seems to be a good sign, I hope.  So I start by ordering the Beef Benedict with Scrambled Eggs instead of Poached Eggs. I prefer Scrambled Eggs, not really a Poached Egg type of guy. I know they are all eggs but it is just what I prefer. The beef was sooo tender and it was very tasty too. My dish also came with an English Muffin and Hash Brown Potatoes. The hash browns were really good, seasoned just right, I only added a little bit of salt. I also had a side of bacon, a breakfast just isn't a breakfast without a side of bacon (even if you order bacon as your main dish, you should still order a side of bacon, yum).  My wife ordered a half order of the Lemon, Ricotta and Blueberry pancakes. She was thrilled that she could order the full order (4 pancakes), half order (which she did order, 2 pancakes) and a quarter order (1 pancake). Maria is a light eater and usually does not like that most places do not have smaller order sizes for adults. She also ordered a side order of sausage patties. I will agree with Maria her dish was very good. She of course let me sample some. Actually just about everyone let me sample some, boooo to those who didn't!  My birthday, daughter ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. That was like eating desert for breakfast. Her pancakes were truly delicious!! They were a little bit on the rich side but still really good. Her boyfriend ordered the 4 Berry French Toast. He had to make a fast trip over to Walgreens. So while he was gone and his food showed up I had to give them a sample. Don't worry I told him I sampled some of his food when he got back. The French toast was sooo light and tasty. They were really good. I think I would get this next time, of course with a side of bacon (which is what he got was a side of bacon too). The Berrys on his French Toast were very fresh tasting too.  My oldest son ordered two scrambled eggs and bacon. He was the only one to not let me sample any of his dish. Which is probably good since he thought it was just okay. He even left some bacon on his dish when the waiter took it. I couldn't believe it as I still had some room for some bacon. My younger daughter ordered a Cheddar Cheese and Bacon Omelette, which after complaining for a while finally let me sample some. I tell you these kids now a days, not appreciating their hard working parents. Well we both thought her dish was good. And finally my youngest son ordered a Breakfast Burrito. He never said what he thought of it but I thought it was average, I actually thought the Breakfast Burrito at Victory Banner was better.  So our total bill came to roughly $120 dollars. Which for seven of us was pretty good I thought. That even included an 18% tip, I guess because of party size, even though no one ever said why. Our waitress/server Pearl was extremely friendly and patient. Even though I will say we told her it was our daughters birthday and that got us nothing. I don't say that just to get something, but come on Bongo Room the place is packed, business is going well I think you can afford something for the birthday person. I don't know maybe a side of bacon (hint, hint). And finally the food was original, fresh and very good tasting.

But if the devil is in the details, TBR really earns its 5 stars.  Sure, you may have a bit of a wait if you go during prime brunch time; however, once you sit down, the staff is great, the restaurant is comfortable (one can never under appreciate tall ceilings with effective ceiling fans), the interior design is simple yet well thought out, and--this I delight in--the house coffee is Intelligentsia and the house tea is any number of varieties from The Mighty Leaf!  I love when places have that sort of thoughtfulness and consideration.

The menu says the potatoes are hash browns, but they arent: They are similar to roasted potatoes but are excellent.

(1470 N Milwaukee Ave, Chicago 60622).  If you go between the hours of 10:30am-12:30pm be prepared to wait for at least 30 minutes or longer.  But I'm telling you... it's worth the wait IF you are a huge fan of breakfast. Favorite top two dishes from The Bongo Room: If you are feeling ravenous- order the Breakfast Burrito which has  a jalapeno tortilla with guacamole and scrambled eggs topped with melted cheese and sour cream, salsa on the side served with hash browns.  Might I mention,  I don't know where they get their salsa ingredients, but it's very fresh (every time).   And there is something about their hash browns too. Crispy, but not too crispy. Just love and I don't even need or want ketchup with them! If you crave hollandaise, the way I do from time to time... you should try the Eggs Benedict.  The eggs are cooked to perfection, the toasted English muffin provides a good base and I substitute the ham for spinach.  It's ooey, gooey, wonderful.    I'm a huge fan of Bongo Room.",0.9905,0.786,0.214,0.0,0.65

But I have already digressed.... A breakfast burrito is a standard-issue fare for a place like this, but the Bongo Room's was one of the better ones I've ever had.  The fresh house-made salsa was better than what you get in many Mexican restaurants.  (By comparison, one of the few breakfast burritos available in Cincinnati is served with sludge that probably is Pace Picante Sauce.)  Chipotle (?) sour cream and guacamole were good, too, and the eggs were perfectly scrambled.  ""Hash browns""/home fries were great, too, although not quite the flavor bomb their mouth-watering appearance suggested.  The wife got the blueberry pancakes, which came with this delicous sugar-cookie butter; she said it was almost as good as her mama's blueberry pancakes, and that's saying something.   The Bongo Room serves good strong coffee and, on the weekday morning we were there, we had great service.   If I were more enamored of breakfast food in general, I'd probably go with a five-star rating.  Plus, I read about these nightmare lines on weekend mornings.   But based on one weekday-morning experience with no line in sight, it's a soild four-and-a-half.",0.9954,0.768,0.204,0.028,0.5926339285714285

My rating of Bongo Room is above five starts because everything is beyond great :) For those of you who complained about not being served a mimosa or some iced tea.  GET SOME PERSPECTIVE.... If you are going to give one star based on not getting some champagne or some flavored water then you need to go elsewhere and stop complaining about every little thing in life.  If you don't like waiting.... Go somewhere else like IHOP or Denny's where I am sure they are never shot staffed on a table or some powdered  iced tea.   SOOO sorry Bongo Room brews their iced tea fresh therefore may run out....  Bongo Room is a must if you like great service, amazing food, and very tasty coffee :)  LOVE LOVE LOVE Bongo Room!",0.9966,0.636,0.287,0.077,0.5840996168582376

Get the Red Pepper, Feta, and spinach eggs benedict.  Legitimately the best benedict I have ever had. Feeling a little sweet? Snag the sweet potato breakfast burrito.  Stuffed with sweet potatoes, black beans, and eggs, this is a meal that you cannot go wrong with. Feeling really sweet?  Check out the zucchini pancakes.  I personally did not enjoy the pretzel pancakes like I did the zucchini ones.  It's a little bit like desert for breakfast but what is wrong with that?

Our waitress was friendly.  So that's not the problem.  However, she withheld the fact that they were out of the chocolate tower french toast until my fiancee tried to order it.  That's a problem because I think she should have been more upfront about what she couldn't serve us. The coffee - kinda weak - that's a problem.  But more so, for the prices that Bongo Room charges, I would at least expect real milk for my coffee instead of the creamer packets on the table.   Probably the thing I like least about my experience today is the fact that their menu still reads ""fall 2009.""  It's March 27th, 2010.  Not even winter anymore.  It's spring.  Me thinks it's time for a menu change - Bongo Room, and a change of scenery for me.

2010-03-26,1.0,"Seriously??!!!!!!!!!!  You are not going to serve me a mimosa????!!!!!!!! Ok, well some gal pals and I ventured to The Bongo Room for some brunch on a bright sunny Sunday.   Their menu options were disappointing to me because I am not one to eat desert for breakfast but hey, if you are all about eating a pancake sundae for breakfast, than go for it.  Since none of the overly sweet breakfast items suited me, I decided to go with the original Eggs Benedict and I will say they were VERY delish! the best I have ever tasted.  I would love to return to The Bongo Room for that menu item alone. However, the reason why I will very much likely not return to The Bongo Room is for basically telling me and 6 of my friends, ""Sorry, you gotta go. we need your table."" As we all enjoyed our intelligentsia coffee, scarfed down all our meals which each of us were very pleased with what we ordered, we decided it was mimosa time! ""One raspberry pear mimosa for each of us please!"" That probably would have added another $100 to our already $100+ bill. After the waitress takes our order, she tells us, ""well I will have to check if we can serve you anything else."" then she walked away. we were all stumped, and didn't understand why it would be a problem to serve us anything else if we are at a restaurant and have not yet paid our bill.  Well our nice waitress did come back and said the Host said no, she was not allowed to put in our mimosa order because they needed our table. so in my mind...""No! No mimosa for you!"" Sounds much like the Soup Nazi from Jerry Seinfeld.  That alone is BAD service, your customer is dining at your establishment, you serve them until they are done and pay for their bill. Is that lack of common sense or am I the only person who expects to be treated as a valued customer when I am dining somewhere? Its not like we were all sitting there taking up their space. a few of us were still eating.  their mimosas are about $10 each... I believe, that would have been an additional $70+ for 20 more minutes. BTW, the time it took that waitress to go ask that fugly host if their party of 7 was allowed to drink a mimosa, then come back to tell us no, then go get our bill, then come back and pick up our money (20 minutes later)... they could have served us our mimosas and we would have been done with them by the time she came back to pick up our payment for the bill.  But instead they refused service... so for that I will likely never return to Bongo Room. if I do go back, it'll be a fluke out of nowhere for some odd reason...  Ahh... damn you Bongo Room! You ruined such a lovely gal pal sunday... we were so looking forward to those raspberry pear mimosas. Perhaps put disclaimer signs all over your establishment...

And usually, I leave happy.  However, this time I was floored by the asinine seating policies of their staff.  We were told the wait for 2 people was 20-25 minutes, so we left, came back, and were still waiting 40 minutes later.  Which is fine; it was crowded.  However, we then watched two other parties (who got there after us) be seated first, and I finally had to speak up when, not one or two- but THREE- booths were cleaned and then left vacant while several couples of us stood around waiting to be seated (for a good 15 minutes).   When I mentioned to a server that we had been waiting for an hour and pointed out the many open booths, I was told ""we don't sit parties of 2 at the booths."" WTF?! Although brunch logic shows that the smaller the party, the shorter your wait for a table, you would rather have several couples loitering in the aisles, starving, for the amount of time it would take us to eat a meal and leave?  And meanwhile, several booths sit unused...until a party of 4 chances in and is seated immediately?    Fortunately, we were seated a few minutes after the server went over to vent to the hosts about my complaint...but the fact that they don't have a better (or at least a common sense) strategy for the Sunday brunch rush is staggering. To be fair (2 hours later), I enjoyed my Breakfast Croissant Sandwich, and I appreciate that they do half-orders of the super-sweet pancakes for those of us who would just like a little taste.  But the aggravation we had to endure means my next visit to Bongo Room will be even rarer.",0.9883,0.84,0.132,0.028,0.3936111111111111

2010-02-08,2.0,"I decided to take a random trip out to Chicago this past weekend to work on travelling around as much of the country as I possibly can. As I was riding the Blue Line out from O'Hare one morning, I was wondering where I could find the best breakfast spot along the track. A quick search on Google pointed me to an old Chicago Sun-Times article whose writer could not further emphasize the amazingness of the pancakes at Bongo Room. I love pancakes. I was sold. Unfortunately, some things in life can't be exchanged for refunds... As soon as I caught a glimpse of the prices (but not sooner than realizing how much Milwaukee and Williamsburg share in common), I knew I was in for the almost comfortably expensive breakfast I get in spades right here at home. The place was packed and people were waiting, but having come alone, I had no problems getting in. Service was fairly quick and attentive, though the staff looked understandably busy. Unfortunately, that's where my positive reception of this place ends. I started off my breakfast with a caffe mocha, and was immediately disgusted to see that they use -- out of all things --- Hershey's chocolate syrup as the base. Now, I wouldn't normally care about this -- a mocha's a mocha -- but Hershey's is absolutely NOT appropriate in a $4.50 12-ounce drink, nor was it acceptable that it tasted exactly like hot chocolate with a zing. But hey, I came for their show-stopping pancakes, so this will probably be a small oversight. Wrong. I ordered a basic breakfast: plain pancakes with one of their eggwhite omlettes (it had canadian bacon, mushrooms and lots of cheddar). It didn't take too long for them to prepare my plate, but good God did I wish it did after I tried to cut into them. All three of them were incredibly hard to cut through, making them my first batch of super tough pancakes. As far as how they tasted...to the bread bakers reading this, do you remember the first batches you made BEFORE you learned how to bake them *just* long enough? Remember that doughy, tough, ""not at all done yet"" taste that you could only cope with because it was your first batch and knew that it'd get better over time? These pancakes tasted EXACTLY like that...except worse because PANCAKES AREN'T MADE OF DOUGH. For those that prefer their bread off-the-shelf, here's what I'm trying to say: their pancakes tasted like a warm play-dough. This was with powdered sugar AND syrup. Yum. I asked the couple sitting next to me at the bar about their Red Velvet pancakes, since they were also eating them slowly. They said it was one of the best pancakes they've ever had in their life. Either they've never had pancakes before, or something was *way* off. After asking the waitress, it turns out that the plain pancakes are actually the ""base"" they use for all of their other creations (including their buttermilk pancakes). Lovely. Again, I wouldn't be too pissed if I was out $10 or so. However, this *amazing* four-star entree didn't cost $10, but /$17.43./ That was *without* the pancakes, as the waitress was nice enough to not charge me for them.  As my other reviews indicate, I'm pretty leniant and usually try to maintain a positive attitude about the places I visit. However, despite the pretty good service I received, I simply cannot give this place a good rating. I'm a breakfast guy and can tolerate pretty bad breakfast (I usually like good ones, though), but this the first batch of pancakes I did not finish. While their flavored pancakes might be the solution for world peace and the end of Operation Freedom, I cannot recommend a place that can't even get the basics right.",0.9968,0.772,0.157,0.071,0.5463529621063867

Went this morning with a friend and avoided a long wait by sitting at the counter. Got the vegetarian croissant sandwich (filling but you will not look attractive trying to eat it!) and my friend got the breakfast burrito, recommended by a fellow counter diner.  We couldn't decide between the sweet pancakes (brown sugar and apple... red velvet... oh my!) and opted for one piece of the Chocolate French Toast Tower.  This thing covers an entire plate. It comes out covered in bananas, chocolate shavings, and a banana white chocolate sauce. I seriously have no idea how you could finish a full order.  I cannot wait to go back. If I could, I would tomorrow. In short:  1) Get counter seating if with a small group and starving 2) Ignore the people ogling your food- it's too good to look away. 3) If you have the stomach for it, grab a full order of sweet pancake options or the french tower. If not, split it with your group or get one piece- that can be breakfast on its own. 5 out of 5. Fantabulous.",0.8663,0.827,0.103,0.07,0.418859649122807

The smoked salmon Benedict with hash browns were delicious and well balanced.  The Bongo Room's take on hash browns are the way of the smashed and seasoned red potato.  Smoked salmon by design, is very salty.  The low-sodium nature of the hash browns provided great balance with the salty salmon.  The eggs were perfectly over-easy and the dill hollandaise was a delightful accent. The omelet was somewhat of a disappointment.  There were spots where the sweet basil was too overpowering and other spots in the omelet where it was non-existent.  They went a bit too heavy on the butter in the frying pan as well.

Even though I was on a second date, I had no issues with chowing down, cleaning my plate and leaning back from the table in ecstasy. We sat in one of the window nooks and watched the scene on Milwaukee. It was a great experience. I'd thought often of coming back, but I was never able to motivate. Fast forward to the present...and, I'm back. I didn't come on a date, so there were no worries of poor etiquette and/or embarrassment. It was raining (again) and I didn't have an umbrella (not even Vanessa's). We didn't get a sweet table in the window nook. We sat smack dab in the front of the restaurant at two two tops smooshed together. The food -- still as excellent as I remember. I started things off with a hot apple cider. It was served in a pint glass, wrapped in a napkin (so as not to burn myself). It was spiced, hot and quite satisfying on a cold December morning. The big question of the day was to go sweet or savory. I felt like I should get something savory, seeing as I went to town on sweet stuff the last time I was here. On the other hand, I AM the Sultan. Decision made. Sweet. Now, what to get? I was deciding between the red velvet pancakes, chocolate french toast and the apple pancakes. Since I was drinking a hot apple cider, the apple cakes were out. I am not really a french toast fan -- no matter the amount of chocolate, etc. ensconced within. So, I went with the red velvet cakes.

I've always found them to be good, and the best plan if you are with a few friends is to order ONE pancake of the types you want to try, and then you all share. Getting a full stack of three is just waaaaaay too much to eat on your own. I like this Wicker Park location because it is laid back and not obnoxious. As always, it's best to go on a weekday if you can, or try to hit the off hours on the weekends because there will be one helluva wait.",0.9787,0.781,0.192,0.026,0.439010989010989
2009-11-20,4.0,"After living for a whole year in Chicago, I finally tried the much talked about Bongo Room! I'm a big fan of brunch, so I was pretty excited to check it out!  Like any other brunch place, there was about a 20-30 min. wait. The restaurant itself is a bit small, so I always see a pretty large amount of people waiting around outside. But this time, I was determined to wait it out! And I wasn't disappointed!  Our server was very friendly and I enjoyed the bright, cheer decor. I ordered on of the french toast specials, which was covered with pears, some sort of cream sauce on the plate and sprinkled in cinnamon, It was absolutely delicious, if not too sweet for me! I'd steer away from it if you don't eat many sweets. So I balanced it out with some of the potatoes on my friend's plate. They're doused with dill and are definitely worth the order! Just dip it in some ketchup or chow down plain! And the omlettes re definitely a yes to order! I'll definitely be back again to try some more of their food!",0.992,0.74,0.236,0.024,0.4999841269841271

2009-11-16,3.0,"I've been haunting the streets of this neighborhood for the better park of a decade. It's hard to spend this much time in Wicker Park/Bucktown without stopping at this iconic Chicago brunch/breakfast spot at least a few times.  I popped in this past week to satisfy a late afternoon pancake craving with a friend.  Pleased to grab an immediate stool at the bar, we posted up and dove into the menu.  After looking it over, I went for the cranberry-walnut pancakes with a side of bacon. My partner in crime opted for a chorizo omelet.  I'm usually an egg guy, but passed at the 10$ price tag on an omelet. How much can eggs really cost?  Our food arrived and I was immediately wide-eyed by the mammoth pancakes. I give the thumbs up to this dish- moist, all of the flavors were there and not overly sweet.  The omelet sitting next to me was very run-of-the-mill and confirmed my initial suspicion of ""how much can you pay for eggs?"" Good, but not a 10$ egg.  I had two bigger points of disappointment- 1) The bacon was an absolute joke- fried within an inch of becoming ""Bacos"" and looking very, very sad on the plate- at 3.50$ for the side.....I'll pass next time. 2) They use basic corn syrup based pancake syrup- at a place that is supposed to be ""boutique"" and is priced this way, I would at least hope for the option of real syrup. If you specialize in breakfast and market yourself as premium, it should follow suit throughout.  The highlight (and reason for a solid 3 star experience) was the staff. Everyone was very nice, attentive and professional. Hats off to that.  In the end Bongo Room has a long standing tradition and won't be hurting for crowds on the sidewalks any time soon. For my money, I think I'll pick up breakfast at a place like Cozy Corner- very solid, consistent food at a very fair price, using most of the same ingredients as the kitchy joints when it comes to the breakfast staples.",0.943,0.828,0.11,0.062,0.4415811965811967

A friend of mine who happens to be a huge fan told me I have to get there once they open, which is 9AM on Sunday. We went today and met at the door at 8:55 and the line was getting longer by the minute. We walked in and our party of six was able to get one of the two big tables they have. Lots of sweets on the menu as it was difficult for most of us to choose. I saw they had some interesting mimosas on the menu such as the grapefruit mimosa,  raspberry mimosa and the raspberry & pear mimosa (which i was destined to have), but they do not serve alcohol until 11AM (damn!) I ordered the French Toast that was on special which was covered in sliced pears and some sort of white chocolate creme sauce and the right dose of cinnamon. I also ordered a side of thai chicken sausage which was great. The three huge slices of french toast was tasty and very fulfilling, but sad to say it was so much I could not finish it (that almost never happens). I tried someone else's potatoes and they were off the chain! (yum). I also tried a piece of the Chocolate Tower French Toast and it was good but just too rich. The service here is pretty good except they brought the check a little too early for my taste. The atmosphere is very chill and laxed and I also enjoyed  the selection of music while eating.

The french toast is good to try, but too much for an entire meal.  You can get a slice as a side, but no person with a normal appetite will be able to finish the side and their normal dish.  Instead, I recommend spitting a french toast dish and a salty dish with someone if you can swing it.  You will then get the best of both flavor worlds, save money, and not waste food.

2009-10-16,4.0,"File this one under my not-yet-created list:  ""Places to brunch on the weekdays because I hate to wait for brunch.""  One dad in town required one PTO day, which subsequently required brunch someplace. Cuz, face it, I'm not one to wait for my eggs and coffee, ya hear? Not this chick. And if I have a day off, I am gonna spend the morning immersed in eggy goodness and fat cups of hot coffee. This is usually accompanied by the anger I feel at the other people also imbibing who I presume to be independently wealthy and able to brunch every day with no wait.  Fortunate for us, Bongo Room saved us a prime people-watching table right by the front window at which we could imbibe on our overpriced breakfast. Nice work, BR. You're off to a good start.  Honestly, though, our breakfast was not overpriced. Everything was plentiful and delicious. Big steaming mugs of coffee took the edge off the rainy, dreary day. My only gripe? If you're charging almost $3 for drip coffee, may I please have some real cream up in this joint? Cuz while the little ""leave 'em on the table"" mini-cartons are worlds better than powdered coffee mate, I am snotty about coffee and how I drink it. I like my real cream, k?  Caffeine-snobbery aside, my breakfast was nothing short of fantastic. I went with the veggie croissant which was smeared with a basily mayo and piled high with fresh veggies and other delightful fillings: sprouts, spinach, 'shrooms, muenster cheese, and one perfectly hard-cooked egg. Survey says? Perfection on a cwasssawn (that is my idea of how you pronounce it in French. Correct me cuz I'm wrong, Ms. Aurore.)  Dad had the manly breakfast burrito which was lovely as well. Huge, presented beautifully, and stuffed to the brim with eggs and a little kick of spiciness. Both dishes came with some gorgeously-seasoned red potatoes that had the Irish gal in me shrieking with delight.  Service was great as well. Our mugs stayed steaming, and our dirty plates were whisked away promptly.  Soooo....the verdict? Great food, BIG coffees, no wait on weekdays. Now, get the real cream and a permanently reserved table for me whenever I feel like the veggie croissant and you can have your fifth star.  UPDATE: I was contacted by Bongo Room and they advised me that they will not give me a permanent reservation. Sucks for me.

Hey, when you've got nothing to do during the day, you might as well wake up and eat some breakfast.  I got to the Bongo room and looked at the menu and there was so much on it that I wanted. All of the pancakes sounded delicious, but since I am most definitely a savory breakfast person, to an omelet I went. And it was the right choice. I got the egg whites, which were fifty cents extra, but I am ok with that. That's not a ridiculous price by any means, and in fact, is one of the cheaper prices for egg whites that I've seen. You can choose what is in your omelet and there were so many delicious cheese options! That was the hard part for me, but If I had gotten three cheeses, I would have been disappointed in myself. In the most delicious way, of course. So I chose to get roasted red peppers, spinach and feta. Mmmm mmmm. The omelet was nice and very thick, which I very much appreciated. I really enjoyed that the egg whites were thick, light and fluffy, because sometimes when you order egg whites, they totally suck. But these ones were good, and my ingredients were folded into the half moon of delicious egg. Yummy. The potatoes were also very delicious, what with the touch of dill. Amazing because I love dill. I also got a side of bacon, medium cooked, which is how I like it, and they did a very good job. I tried to eat everything but really couldn't. I wish I had, because it was delicious but I just figured that running the rest of my errands wasn't possible if I were in a food coma. Ugh. I only took away one point because as another poster says, they only serve eggs benedict on the weekends. Not that I would ever order that (seeing as how I don't like egg yolks) but I would appreciate the full menu when I come, just so I can see everything.

Despite the many people waiting outside, we were never made to feel rushed, which made me love them even more.

I mentioned to the waitress that I was pondering the Chocolate Tower French Toast but leaning more towards the Eggs Benedict and she said that many people didn't know that you could ask for just one slice of the Chocolate French Toast, which I promptly did. Delicious!  Warning: I've had the Chocolate Tower French Toast dish before and it really is a massive tower (has serious height and width). You would need to run like 20 miles to justify eating this dish, seriously. So, unless you're a linebacker, I would suggest ordering just one slice or a half order or whatever smaller portion of this dish they'll allow  - or share it.

They have an EXCELLENT location, but it's so sad to walk by that place and see it closed up at dinner time. The sandwiches are all good. Their potato salad is excellent too (I highly recommend it). If I could get one after 2PM, it would be even better. The prices aren't very great. I don't like the idea of a Reuben with potato salad costing as much as it does.

I got the spinach, feta, and red pepper eggs benedict dish - amazingly tasty. And a single (yes, they let you order just 1!) banana crunch pancake. I just wanted a taste of the sweet to see what all the fuss was about, but I ended up devouring both dishes. I just couldn't stop myself.

The banana white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes fueled me for a day of sightseeing in Chi-town without leaving me with the dreaded sugar crash. Moreover, the coffee here is brewed to impeccability and certainly played an important role in helping me stay awake in the morning traffic.

I had an omelette, which was quite good, and my friend opted for the breakfast croissant.  Also very good, but neither of us was thrilled with the potatoes.  There was a flavor to them that I just didn't enjoy.  Not terrible, but everything else was so much better that it stood out.  Also, prior to getting her actual meal, my companion was given an order of pancakes with chocolate covered pretzels - our server put the order in wrong.  Not the biggest deal ever, but a little frustrating when you're ravenous.

It was a great brunch all round.  I suppose you are wondering WHY Bongo is not a five star review- well, their menu is a tad small, and they have no daily specials.

So on to the food--the eggs benedict with spinach, roasted red peppers, feta, and poached eggs on two toasted English muffins, all smothered with a delicious hollandaise sauce.  It's TO DIE FOR.  It's sooooo good.  And it comes with a huge side of ""hash browns,"" which are really like roasted red potatoes, but they are perfectly seasoned and crisp on the outside. Yummm.  It's hands-down the BEST brunch food I have ever had, and definitely the best out of all the brunch places I've been to in Chicago. Another favorite is the breakfast burrito (also with a side of potatoes), which comes with this amazing seasoned sour cream and salsa.  I don't really know what's in it but it's so freakin' good. Don't forget to order one piece of the white chocolate-caramel pretzel pancake (you'll be too stuffed to finish an entire order, and it's more of a dessert-type dish so you probably wouldn't want it as your main entree).  It's seriously heavenly.  One bite and you can't help but smile.  I don't even like pretzels but they're really just there for a bit of crunch.  It's ooey gooey melt-in-your-mouth yumminess.   I've also tried the chocolate tower french toast, which some people love, but it had too many bananas in it for my liking.  The strawberry-banana pancakes are basically just that--normal pancakes with fresh banana and strawberry on top--so nothing special...but the strawberry whipped cream on top is really good.  Also, the omelettes are pretty standard--you have your choice of toppings but you can get that anywhere.  Stick to the specialty brunch items instead. The waitstaff are hit-or-miss...the same people are always there, but it just depends who you get.  No one is rude or anything, but some people are more attentive than others.

I suggest going on a weekday, if possible, to avoid the hour-long wait to be seated, but if you choose to go on a weekend (and you stand in line forever and a day) the pancakes can not be missed; they are indulgent. Tip: if you have your heart set on a savory dish you can order a side of a pancake/flapjack or french toast.  You get one pancake at a fraction of the cost.",-0.4694,0.891,0.044,0.065,0.525

Village area for about 3 or 4 years now and I sure as hell have experienced A LOT better - especially when considering the wait and the price. Why anyone would wait in a 45+ min. line on a Sun. or Sat. morning is beyond me (note: my wait was probably just about as long until I chose the bar seating, but still I'll never do it again). What all these people are lining up for also boggles my rattled mind. I mean, don't get me wrong - you got some guests from out of town and you want to show them the hopping brunch scene in the new and cool bucktown neighborhood. If these guests are good enough company where conversation comes easy, you don't mind dropping a few dimes on brunch, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers, and creepily drooling over people's food through the window, Bongo Room is your place. However, my questions lies here: why go somewhere that takes as long to get in as it does to eat and pay at other restaurants? Not to mention, the place doesn't even serve over-the-top mouth-watering food? Maybe I was too hungover for the crowd and not in a good mood. Maybe I hated the hashbrowns and am too picky. All I'm saying is don't waste your morning hour waiting for someone to call out your named so that you can experience okay service and mediocre food among the masses and masses and masses......",0.9512,0.838,0.115,0.047,0.6473391320613543

2009-01-03,5.0,"See profile site for full review with formatted pics. Columbus and even more-so Ohio in general lacks good breakfast spots.  Somehow over the course of many years Bob Evans and Cracker Barrel have become the standard with the occassional IHOP thrown in for variety and trans-fatty repulsiveness.  Sure, Columbus has recently received a gem of a breakfast spot in the form of Zen-Cha, but in general the places that serve a good pancake or french toast have a single option and lack the kitsch that makes them fun.  With that said, along with fine dining dinners and unique desserts an awesome breakfast/brunch spot is always a must when I travel.  From Griddle Cafe and Doughboys in LA to Norma's in New York to Tableau, Payard, and Bouchon in Vegas I've had some hits and misses along the way......on 12/31/08 Bongo Room hit it out of the park. Arriving around 9:30am at the Wicker Park location we managed a parking spot directly in front of the building and were met by a restaurant that was only half full - none of those obsurd waits of legend.....of course when we left at 10:45 there was a line out into the cold streets.  On entering the Bongo Room our server, a friendly young lady named Lani, greeted us with a big smile and a spring in her step and were were seated immediately at a booth for 6 - good thing, we ended up needing the room. Enamoured with the sheer decadence, both my sister and I opted for a half order of the White Chocolate and Carmel covered Pretzel pancakes.  Between the two of us we received four of these crushed pretzel coated pancakes topped with white chocolate cream and buttery caramel and of all the options it was these that were closest to completion at the end of the meal. While my mother and aunt both contested it was simply too sweet, the pretzle pancakes were without a doubt my sister's favorite choice of the meal.  With notable crunch from the pretzel topping and absolutely smothered in creamy white chocolate and drizzeled with caramel the dish was moist, sweet, succulent and absolutely over the top in every way. My sister's second 1/2 order, also ordered by my aunt, was the Banana Peanut Butter Chip Pancakes with warm white chocolate sauce, chocolate crème anglaise, and fresh bananas.  Named by my aunt as her favorite choice of the meal, these four monsterous pancakes also neared completion between the four of us and the delectably fresh bananas paired with natural peanut butter and milk chocolate was nearly as tasty as the banana crepes at Tru the night before, yet clearly less refined.  Amazing. My aunt's second half order was the only miss of the meal, in my opinion, and that is only because everything else was so darn good.  Apple-pear and Dried cherry French Toast composed of Brown Sugar Crusted Brioche with warm apples, pears, dried cherry compote and apple pie spice crème anglaise with candied pecans, while tasty, simply had too much going on to be ""great"" and despite the multiple ingredients lacked the sweetness necessary.  While the addition of pure maple syrup (heads up Over Easy) helped, the dish just wasn't up to par with the other wonderful choices. The next 1/2 order was Pumpkin Carrot Cakes comprised of pumpkin spiced cakes with shredded carrots, vanilla bean cream sauce and cinnamon orange crème anglaise.  Expecting something 'pumpkin pie like' this dish was a fantastic surpise in its taste, texture, and consistency which more closely represented a moist carrot cake topped with sweet icing.  Honestly, had there been some raisins in this dish it may have rivaled even the best carrot cakes I've ever tasted (Bouchon and Worthington Inn) but even without it was truly remarkable. My mother's other 1/2 order, the Red corn and Cranberry Flapjacks entailed ground red corn cakes with cranberry pieces and toasted pecan honey maple butter and was decidedly her favorite of the meal.  With or without syrup the dish was incredibly hearty and Thanksgiving-esque, like a GREAT cornbread but more fluffy.  This was likely my second favorite option of the meal. My second 1/2 order, and my favorite of the meal, was the Pear Tarte-tartin Hotcakes comprised of buttermilk hotcakes topped with torch-bruleed pear slices, warm caramel sauce, and vanilla bean icecream.  Perhaps it was the buttermilk, perhaps the icecream, perhaps the carmelized pears, I'm not really sure....but this dish rivaled Keller's Famous Bread-pudding French Toast for my favorite breakfast item of all time.  The buttermilk hotcakes were simply fluffier than the pancakes of other dishes, the icecream sublime, the bruleed pears crispy and perfect.  Amazing. On future visits, I think 5-6 1/2 orders for 4 people would be more reasonable, or perhaps 8 single pancakes if there were more options. Great/friendly service, great quality ingredients, great prices, a good vantage point of the kitchen, wonderful coffee.....a strong competitor for ""best breakfast ever"" and a DEFINITE return visit.",0.9996,0.78,0.203,0.017,0.5084251606978878

The most interesting things on the breakfast menu are pancakes, french toast and waffles covered in chocolate sauce, ice cream, carmel sauce, glazed pecans and the like. This kind of super-sweet, ice-cream-for-breakfast menu is not my thing, so I ordered an omlette. And ... it was delicious! And totally unexpected.

And, instead, it was a perfect omlette -- fresh chopped tomatoes and spinach, just the right amount of jack cheese, eggs cooked perfectly and folded over the veggies and cheese, with mulitgrain toast that was exactly what multigrain toast should be. It was great, and the service was prompt and friendly.  On the down side, the ""hash browns"" were not hash browns -- they were chopped, herbed potatoes, and the bacon was too greasy.

2008-10-01,3.0,"6 years ago I actually used to live right across the street and used to watch crowds wait outside on any given Sunday morning.  I never went. After *finally* going I still don't exactly understand why people wait for this place. Their savory breakfast fare is lacking and uncreative. The choices were pretty much ""2 eggs,"" an omelette, a croissant sandwich, or a breakfast burrito.  Stuff you can get anywhere.  My SO ordered an omelette and it didn't look like they cooked it right, but I'll let him review his own food...! (As another aside, they serve savory items with what they call ""hash browns"" ...only they're not... they're home fries or roasted potatoes, but definately not hash browns.) Everyone here mentions you can get smaller portions to try different things... I had even read that before, but didn't know what the exact parameters of this were...  The menu makes no mention of it, and even goes as far as saying ""no substitutions"" etc.  Why on earth wouldn't the waitress inform us of this, as it seems like it could take our meal up a notch...?? I ordered what they called berry cheesecake flapjacks.  Basically it was a plate of pancakes topped with some sliced bananas, that were then doused in a cream sauce, then doused by swirls of raspberry sauce.  It was good, but might as well have been a banana split sundae.  I actually thought the sauce was going to be more on the cheesey side than whipped cream side, but it wasn't at all.  No idea why they even bother to call it a ""cheesecake"" flapjack, if there was any element of cheese it was undetectable.  I ate a lot, and an hour or two later really regretted eating as much as I did! Their lunch menu actually looked better than their breakfast menu if you ask me... Who knew they even served lunch??

The meal was above average, but they doused EVERYTHING with sauce (I'm looking at some photos I took from my brunch there and the sauce makes me want to throw up).  My favorite was probably the eggs benedict, except the chef went a little overboard on the dill.  Otherwise, it was pretty perfect.  The french toast wasn't soaked properly so it tasted like chocolate bread with creme anglaise.   I'd definitely go back if I'm in Chicago (because I haven't found a lot of great brunch spots in Chicago), but next time, I'm definitely asking for SAUCE ON THE SIDE.",0.9881,0.797,0.189,0.014,0.4096590909090909

Our experience starts with the inevitable -- waiting for a table.  We had mentally accepted the possibility of a long wait, as is Bongo's reputation.  So as the birthday boy and I settled in to enjoy the views on Milwaukee, we were excited and surprised to only have to wait a couple of minutes.  As we entered the dining room the host joked, ""Sorry for the long wait!""  Sarcasm, I liked him already. Located in the center of eclectic Wicker Park, Bongo Room offers an aesthetically pleasing environment for all senses!  The long narrow dining room boasts a combination of old world charm, with exposed brick and colonial columns, mixed with modern stainless steel ceiling fans and wall treatments.  The small, open kitchen reminded me of an old school diner minus the excessive grease and flies.  Our server was nice, accommodating, but not over-the-top.  My mimosa was delicious, with fresh raspberry and pear juice.  The food, though, the food is what WOW'd me!  And isn't that the goal?  The above mention French toast can be ordered by the slice and that is exactly what we did.  It acted as a dessert to our delectable egg breakfasts and created the perfect balance of sweet and savory!  They had me at ""dill"" which was cooked into the potatoes and was an unexpected and delightful surprise!!  I don't know how they did it, but a simple omelet with onions, spinach and Muenster cheese what out of this world!

I remembered the food being really good and tasty so why not. Upon arrival I was told 45 minutes. Okay thats fine. We could look around at some shops, etc to pass the time and hopefully not pass out from hunger. I saw two seats at the bar. ""could we just sit there"", I asked and was quickly told it was included in the wait time. Ok. So we will wait. no biggie. Came back in 30 minutes... a little longer. 20 minutes later we were called. Wouldnt you know it, we got put it the same two seats at the bar area that I had asked about just 45 minutes earlier. It was evidently included in the wait. Upon sitting down we quickly got our drinks and then we ordered. Not to much later the food came. My girlfriend got the pretzels pancakes and I ordered the ""chocolate tower thing"". Oddly some sort of french toast with berries was put in front of me. I sent it back and waited while eating some of the Pancakes she ordered. Minutes later the waitress came and said ""all I heard was french toast."" I just sat in amazement at her explaination. What happens if she hears someone say pancakes, would she get clarification since there are half a dozen different kinds or would she just choose what she wanted to serve you. Also, how does one mix up ""Chocolate tower thing"" and the words french toast.  Anyway. it didnt stop there because another 10-15 minutes went by and they still hadnt brought me what I ordered. So I called over to the waitress and cancelled the order, which she had no problem doing. She didnt say, I'm sorry, or can I get you something else, or its almost ready let me put it in a to go for you and take it off your bill, because of the trouble and my horrible waitressing abilities.  So the feeling of it being just an extreme privalege to just be in the place and be served at all didnt sit well with me. So after almost 2 hours of my time, I had some iced coffee (25 cents more than regular,,,, I guess the ice there is expensive) and one pancake that had crushed up pretzels in it with some sort of cream on top of it.

So yeah, the food is really good.  Really good.  Well worth some road rash.   The service ain't always so great though.  On very busy days after about an hour of waiting, you still might have to wait 20 minutes for someone to bring you some coffee.   Here's my tip for enjoying the food:  If you're there with others, make a deal with someone to switch plates 1/2way through.  One person can get one of their delicious benedict dishes and someone else can get the pancakes.  I feel like the pancakes are a bit too sweet to eat in one sitting but a 1/2 order of both is a great breakfast.",0.975,0.823,0.16,0.017,0.6764743589743589

And if you're not in the mood for a sweet breakfast, don't worry -- their salty dishes are just as good. I had a BLT benedict and my bf had a breakfast burrito with sweet potato and black beans. Even though the burrito was vegetarian, it was full of flavor and was just as satisfying as its meaty counterparts.  I love Bongo Room and I would make it a must-stop if you're in the Chicago area.

But one bite into the toffee banana pancake smothered in creme anglaise, and all my wildest dreams had come true. This is a big deal, because I hardly ever like: A.) Sweet things for breakfast B.) Anything with toffee C.) Pancakes that weren't made by my mom. So you can imagine my delight and surprise when the bite of pancake in my mouth was the single most delicious bite of brunch food I've put in my mouth EVER. I was there on a Sunday with two of my girlfriends, and we did have to wait 45 minutes (which I expected, based on other Yelp reviews), so I brought along my Patience Cap and it was no biggie. We ordered a single toffee banana pancake and a single pear french toast for the table (brunch appetizers - unorthodox, but highly recommended), and then for my ACTUAL meal, I had the sweet potato and black bean breakfast wrap. WHOA MOMMA! It was a fiesta of flavor dancing the cha-cha on my tongue. Cilantro, sweet potato, egg, cheese, chipotle sour cream, all living in perfect harmony. Another thing I don't like, potatoes for breakfast (hashbrowns, or as you Yankees call them, homefries), are just not my bag, but the ones at Bongo Room were fantastic - not at all greasy, just full of fresh dill and LOVE.

I came here last Sunday after a very long and fuzzy night. I was tired. I was a little hung over. I just wanted to curl up and lay in bed. Yet I had to meet a friend here for breakfast. Why do I do these things to myself? So I ventured off and got here shortly before they open. There was already a bunch of people waiting for it to open as well, they seemed a little more perkier then me, perhaps they had gotten some sober sleep. I sat at the counter and my friend joined me a few minutes later. She was going to show me the ropes. We decided to order our own breakfasts and then get two pancakes, one each of a different kind. Our server was smiling and friendly, checked up on us often and refilled her coffee frequently. I went with the breakfast burrito, my friend went with the BLT and we went with the chocolate carrot cake and the pumpkin pancakes. I had heard how rich they were so I was glad that we only got two. We chatted while waiting, then our food came. First was her food and the pancakes. Mine came a minute later, but we looked at the pancakes. ""Did we order the lemon coconut one?"" ""I can't remember what I said two minutes ago, either way its fine, it looks good."" Then my food came, with another two pancakes. Apparently I was trying all of them that morning. Why did I have that last beer? We ate. It was great. I love the fresh salsa that came with my burrito and my friend's dish was delish. The pancakes were sweet. They were rich. They were damn tasty. I found I loved the coconut one and the pumpkin the best, the coconut was refreshing and I appreciated that. What I didn't appreciate the way I tried to eat everything. I didn't, I couldn't but I tried. And I left way too full. Though it was full and packed, I have to say this, people have in previous reviews about lingering here after breakfasts, I disagree. This is a small place, a lot of people want to eat here, the servers want to make money and for all of that to happen, they need to turn tables over.

In a city where there are so many great places to try for brunch--roughly 148 of them in Wicker Park alone--why wait for an hour and a half just to get a table at Bongo Room? Once we finally got seated, my experience here was good. Our server was sweet and made sure we got everything we needed, but it was nothing remarkable. A small herd of cattle was sitting in the booth behind us, it would seem, so I have to dock a few points for the rodeo we experienced--bolt down those benches, y'all! Our food was delicious.

The fact that what he was served was the half order speaks to why this country is obese. Either way, though, everything we ate was just splendid.

Yes, the breakfasts are creative and tasty...if you like SUGAR & YEAST for dessert, oh I mean breakfast. Smores pancakes, Oreo Cookie Flapjacks, Key Lime Cheesecake Pancakes? I personally can't handle that much crap that early in the morning and need some substantial basics. And I haven't tried an omlette because I think it's hysterical that they charge $8.95 for an omlette with a whopping choice of 2 ingredients. I will say you get a hell of a lot of pancakes. I couldn't finish the pumpkin, white chocolate, whatever else, god only knows what I was thinking, flapjacks that I ordered...and I can pack it in.  But for the basics? I'd say the two-egg option is totally worth it...for the potatos alone. mmmm...i think they're red, and cooked with herbs (and porbably loads of butter).  Anyhow, I probably wouldn't complain about the price so much if the atmosphere wasn't so annoying. On weekends, it's so packed, that your guaranteed to have someone's ass in your face while you're eating, if you're on the ground level. And on the weekdays, it's so quiet that there's bound to be some loudmouthed, egotisitical, inconsiderate moron ruining everyone else's conversations. The services is so, so...I guess depending on who you get. I don't really feel like they care about the customers, and I really don't like being served cold coffee.

With that said, the atmosphere usually puts a damper on the experience.  EVERYONE knows about this place.  While that's not a bad thing, it makes getting a table here a huge pain in the ass.  Which is a problem that could be easily solved, except that this place refuses to take reservations.  WHY?  Seriously, why?  I hate being all excited for some amazing flapjacks, only to arrive and be told that there's an hour and a half wait for a table. My other problem with this place is how close the tables are to each other.  There's nothing worse than trying to enjoy a beautiful, fragrant, dense, delicious plate of pumpkin pancakes while being subjected to the inane conversation of the annoying hipster trash sitting next to you.  I haven't been back since February for this very reason.... The people sitting next to me were so obnoxious that it took every ounce of self-control in me not to stab them in the eyes with my butter knife.  Normally I would have asked to be moved, but where were they going to move me to?
