2017-09-04,3.0,"Roof is a nice rooftop bar/restaurant that can be enjoyed in any weather situation. The space features an open space that can be closed off with a glass retractable roof and large sliding windows. They also have a traditional interior space that can be utilized.  I arrived late afternoon to order drinks and food. The beef skewers were over-cooked and very well done. Next up was the chicken and chorizo paella that we had for dinner. The rice was slightly undercooked and the bottom layer was burned. I understand that Paella should have a tasty bottom crust, but that shouldn't mean it's burned. A manager confirmed that it looked burned but our waitress insisted on giving us a tutorial session about where and what paella is as a dish. Basically, just defending the dish that was delivered to our table. The waitress also seemed to just avoid our table.  My feedback to them included it was good and very flavorful because we enjoyed eating our dinner.

I also had the banana icecream and it was super good. Staff is friendly and the place is beautiful. I love that they have heaters on when it's chilly outside so we weren't freezing. This place is great for celebrating or just to sit down and eat with friends or a date. I can't wait to come back. I also was a guest at the hotel and you still have to follow the rules (wait in line like everyone else).

2017-08-13,1.0,"Racism at its finest. Last night me and my guy decided to try out the rooftop. When we arrived there was a small line (8 people ma'am) ahead of us so we decided to wait. @ this point it's almost midnight. They said the club closed at 3 so we thought we'd take the $36 deal and valet. The security takes pride in being a racist bastard. We made it all the way to the front. Which took 30 mins alone. I paid close attention to everyone who was allowed in because I knew once I made it to the front it would be a problem.  When we made it to the front of the line. The security completely stopped entry. He processed to let his people in for free. Groups of 6-12. Some people he charged 50 per person to get in and some 10 per person. I guess who you are to him dictated your amount to pay. Once he went to the middle of the line I was at the front of and pull selected people I began to get frustrated. At this point it's 12:40 and I'm trying to understand why the line came to a complete stop. I asked over 5 times and was ignored. When a different security walked passed I asked him and he said he didn't know. My guy told the man who was ignoring us he was acting like a kid because we were ignored and he processed to say ""your a grown man wearing sneakers""  Yet they were red bottoms. It shouldn't matter what shoes he have on especially if over 15 men with beat up pumas were more acceptable because they were white. I think the think that makes it worse is that by the time they pulled our car around. He cleared the full lined that formed behind me and my guy. We were the only ones aside the few who walked off to not get in...Will never come back and I don't recommend anyone black visit because there is a possibility you will feel the embarrassment and judgement we dealt with last night.

And to top it all off, you were our server and had such a pleasant and thoughtful air about you.  From your wonderful Romanian accent to your delightfully pleasant service, we were very impressed with you.  Even though we ordered one drink and a dessert, you did not make us feel in anyway less important than some of your other big parties.  You treated us with the same and genuine care and attention that your other parties were received.

I was super excited about the whole experience. I knew celebrating my birthday at the Wit would have been great! With the beautiful scenery was just what I needed to end the celebration. Oh!! was I wrong!! Let me start off by saying, I have never in all my life witness such despicable, unprofessional, demeaning and racially motivated behavior. To anyone!! Especially in a leadership role!  Like many outings that I've attended some of the attendees does not arrive as the same times as others. My 3 sisters arrived at the venue maybe around 9:45pm and after waiting patiently for 45 mins to a hour decided to inquire about the wait. The ""Manger/Bully/Boss/Racist!! Blairy was more than offended because of the complaint about the wait.  The way he responded and how he treated those 3 ladies was heartbreaking to say the least. My husband decided that he would go down and talk to him to try to resolve the issues, To much avail nothing productive came from that conversation. I myself went to try to talk to him and I was tongue lashed! Accused of disrupting ""his process"" simply by inquiring. As calmed as I was at that moment I could see exactly who I was dealing with. But the saddest thing is that the security was upset with his behavior towards the customers as well but because of him leading they had no choice but to follow suit! Eventually after being there just a hour spending hundreds or $$ on parking,food and drinks I decided that the best way to deal with this issue or maltreatment, dis-just and what seemed to be an underlined issue of racism was just to leave and take my business somewhere else.! When exiting there was also an attempt to at least make peace with the situation. Again, Epic fail! His arrogance would not allow him to extend an apology for his behavior, our experience and most importantly ruining what should have been a great night. However, My hopes is that someone who cares enough about The Wit and it's public reputation. Will find reason and will investigate his behavior and mal-treatment to the customers who Patronize this business and contribute to its success to fix this issue. No need to poll the voice of the customers externally. I'm sure your internal customers can speak to this situation as well! As most of the security watched in disbelief that this is happening again!!  Thank you for your time,  A not so happy Customer!",0.9783,0.761,0.146,0.093,0.4888516865079366

2017-05-22,3.0,"I've only ever been to ROOF for events, most recently a company party last week, so this review is for the space as an event venue rather than coming here on a typical night for a bar/club atmosphere. As with any rooftop space downtown, the views are what make the place... and the views here are stunning! If you're looking for an instagrammable spot, this is it. Most of the space is enclosed indoors, with a small outdoor area. The outdoor area has been hella windy every time I've been here so I mostly stick indoors. The event space itself is long and narrow, which is something to consider depending upon what kind of event you are throwing. There's plenty of seating, which is nice. The staff was excellent - our server was super attentive with our drinks and a lot of fun to boot, and the bartenders were great also. The only downside of this place was the food.

You get in, order drinks and dance you butt off while maintaining a good buzz.  Simple, right? Well.... About a month ago my girl and I were in the city celebrating a very special birthday and we decided to check this place out. We arrived around 11:30pm and got in the back of the line about 20 people deep. Figured the place was hopping and we were just about to have awesome time. The wait wasn't long and within 15 min we got in only to discover that the line was there to make the club look busy since the club upstairs was half empty. We got a round of few signature drinks and since no one was at the bar our drinks showed up right away. One star!  The place has amazing views of the loop so we found a spot by the window and started our little party. We don't need much to have amazing time and are very self sufficient but that's just a side note. ;) Finished our drinks and right before midnight we got on the dance floor and that's when things turned for the worse. The DJ that was spinning made everyone on the dance floor look confused. It got so bad that number of times everyone stoped dancing while the DJ was getting too creative switching beats. We stayed on the dance floor for as long as we could but after seeing people leaving and more people looking around not knowing what was happening with the music we decided to split and ended up going to a small club in river north where we drank and danced our butts off till closing.",0.9764,0.822,0.122,0.057,0.5036687271062271

Ours was by far the largest group present that afternoon.  I don't think the wait staff suffered in tips, but that is because we are very nice women!

Near us was a group of all white women seating on a couch having a good time, some leaning on arm rest and sitting back of couch. These ladies were there for at least 45 minutes to hour on the couch. They got up and went to the bar and dance and then left. No one question them if they had reservation. They did not receive bottle service that comes with reservation because they didn't reserved a seat. Fast forward some time.

My friends came over by and my boyfriend seat near me. So there was group is near the couch. Sercurity comes up within 2 minutes to tell me I can't seat there. I understand places have policies but let's be honest every female who ever heels know this feeling and know their feel like it's being stab by knives.

Don't get me wrong it was a lot more chill, smaller and overall just easier to move around. I was loving it! Drinks were flowing, everyone was dancing and it was just an all around great time. Then....though not done to me personally I was able to experience first hand what kind of service they gave on ""busier"" nights.  I gotta admit even in Vegas I haven't experienced such rude, douchebag behavior from any line level staff....and this was a security guard.

I also didn't bother to tell anyone else because I was over the boogie atmosphere so I just got the fuck out. If you like to over pay for shitty drinks make sure you stop by the Wit while you're in town!

Waited 15 minutes and did not have a waitress come over to ask what we would like to drink. Ended up having to flag down a young gentleman and ask him to send over a waitress. Our waitress started off very cold and not friendly but by the end of the night seemed to lighten up. One of the girls food order was wrong, and when one meal was delivered some of the bread slid off and into the water glasses.

2016-07-09,3.0,"Went here for one of their events on June 25th. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. Roof on The WIT has gorgeous views of the city. The crowd of people is mixed. The weird thing is, during the 5pm hour the type of patrons coming in were chic and classy but as the night grew older all these drunk nasty women that were apart of bachelorette parties showed up. We decided to split at that point.  Now as for the food and drinks, I was not completely impressed. We ordered:  Pineapple Express (cocktail): it was a 3/5. The drink looked so festive, like you were on an island somewhere but you couldn't taste a drop of alcohol. They put waaayyy too much ice which watered it down. I recommend asking for no ice to see if that makes a difference but for the price it's definitely not worth it.  Frozen Cocktail: The staff raved about these frozen cocktails but then they weren't ready when we were going to order them. Finally towards the end of the night I got to try it and again 2.5/5 not the best either.  Sushi Rolls: They had a decent selection of sushi rolls. The one they raved about, Diablo Roll, is the one that they didn't have all the ingredients for and weren't serving that night. What a disappointment! We got the Cured Salmon Roll & Roof Roll instead. My friend and I are both sushi addicts so anything tickles our fancy. Eating those was the highlight of the night.  Snacks: We had the Duck Fat Fries. They were ok but cold. I despise cold food!!! I think it would have been better if they were fresh out of the kitchen. They also have this special hotdog that the staff raved about and it was the worst. I couldn't even finish it. So bad! I would never ever recommend that to anyone. The nerve of them to even charge for it.  Desert: Macaroons. They come in an assortment of flavors and they were decent. I'm not really into macaroons, as much as my friend is, but they seemed to be fresh.  All in all, Roof on The WIT has a extremely friendly staff, decent views of Chicago but I would eat before you come. The drinks are ok but don't waste your money on too many.

When the manager approached us, I explained to him that the server had overcharged us.  I informed him that they charged us a total of 25 drinks.  For one type of drink the server placed 11 orders.  I told him that the server charged us drinks she never brought to the table, however he did refused to listen to me.  He was extremely condescending and and he attempted to make it seem as if I was too intoxicated to understand.  Unlike some of my other friends, I had not consumed much.  Nevertheless, he made it seem as if I was ignorant and unable to reason.  Seeing that he was not going to help resolve this issue, my friend put in his card down.

I'm an east coast oyster fan so not sure I'd order these again but nice presentation, shucked perfectly and came with PLENTY of lemons... If only I liked west coast oysters. Nice mignonette but an odd frozen cocktail sauce. Cheese and meat plate - I could eat this everyday. It comes with 3 lovely cheeses and 3 different and distinct meats, a really really good mustard, and a tart but not too sweet cherry chutney. Yummy yummy holy god yummy toast.

Additionally outside the hotel I was accosted by a couple of people before I got very far (the previous night, though, no problems!). I may be from the boondocks, but these tools _really_ need to improve their scam game. So, it was definitely a stay-in sort of night.  I thought being a 'rooftop bar' meant it would be open, but why would I want such a thing on a cold night? Fortunately, it's enclosed. It was really loud and some mook was yelling a lot. There was a game on TV, but I don't think he was even watching it. He was just some dumbass on a mission to create a Sports Bar vibe in a place that didn't seem to be shooting for that. The bartender was pretty attentive and made a nice Manhattan but this place really wasn't what I was looking for, I was looking for more of a chilled out scene. Also when the hotel is called 'the Wit', why no paintings of clowns on the wall? Do they think they're better than that?

2015-11-14,4.0,"A few friends and I went to ROOF on theWit because we were staying at theWit hotel that makes up this whole building. We figured why not try it out, and for what it's worth, it's a pretty nice roof bar but it's a bit too clubby for me. We didn't go here when it was popping at 11pm or whenever, since the last thing I wanted to do is get stuck on the roof with hundreds of drunk twentysomethings. Around six or seven, it was only about half full, so if you just want to come here for the view and to have a drink, that's the optimal time. While we were there, they were setting up for later that night, including removing some of the furniture and turning into more of a dance club. That's not really my scene, so I'm glad I was able to check this out when it was a functioning restaurant and bar. I personally didn't get food, but everyone around us seem to be ordering desserts only. The service was fine, but everyone here is dressed for the night. Even when they bring out desserts for someone's birthday, they have these fake LED lights that take the place of a Roman candle (like how clubs normally bring you champagne and things like that). It was kind of funny to watch, since Chicago regulations probably prohibit them from using live fireworks. When we went, it was about 55° out. But from what I can tell, there is a very nice aspect of the roof comes off, but now that it's winter, that's not going to happen anytime soon. So I would say that during the winter months and colder nights, this is a bit more cramped in here then they would like.",0.9701,0.856,0.113,0.031,0.6023333333333334

2015-11-10,3.0,"I had company visit me from out of town who were staying at the Wit so I decided to have them join me up on the 27th floor bar for some cocktails and to take in the view. The ambiance here is wonderful, especially for people who have never visited downtown Chicago before. There is a breathtaking outdoor area on the far side of the bar which overlooks lake Michigan which is a prime opportunity for photography, especially right at sunset. However, like so many other places I have been which hang their hats on scenery, everything else is either average or less than average.  The food we had is overpriced and trendy to the point of being almost a caricature of fine dining. If you have people with you who are wanna-be sophisticants (no shortage of those in this town), they will probably act impressed, but legit foodies will just sigh. Remember that annoying person in high school that tried so hard to be cool but still failed miserably? This is the culinary version.  Specialty drinks here were similarly tossed about haphazardly with no real theme, or rhyme or reason for that matter. Having a decent selection of top shelf liquor is only step one folks. Generating signature cocktails that are unique enough to stand on their own merit is the real artistry behind it. Having a bottle of Louis Tre above the bar like an altar does not impress me.  Lastly, our cocktail waitress, while smoking hot, managed to make two mistakes on two different rounds for our party. This is a minor fault, at least to me as a former service industry employee. I know sometimes it's just an off day, but this combined with the mediocrity of everything else just dumped gasoline on the fire.  With so many other great places nearby for cocktails and food, I would really only reccomend you stop in here if you are staying at the hotel and feeling particuliarly lazy.",-0.846,0.779,0.105,0.116,0.5973106060606062

Somehow though you managed to alienate Chicago's party and A-list crowd.   Not that you won't get somewhat of a showing now and then but overall the word on the street I hear is avoid.    Perhaps, it was lack of service or even caring when folks are spending $$$$ on bottle service.   Hint: most people don't want their guests having to walk around searching and searching just to find someone to even check-in with.   Love places that feel they can sell VIP service without actually providing it!   In it's class, ROOF ain't the only place in town with management completely clueless of how to provide an elevated customer experience but to date it was the worse in my experience.    This said, at least they treat everyone equally...equally bad. Alternative Suggestions: *** Miss the old lounge vibe or want to hang with friends ***:  Check out craft cocktail bar Celeste (my overall absolute fav), Cerise at the Virgin Hotel (OK the food really isn't that great but otherwise... maybe they can send something up from the The Commons Club), IO Urban Roofscape at the Godfrey Hotel, or for a unique experience Untitled (especially Thursdays).   SOHO House is great just about any night of the week if you have a membership or friends who do. *** Seeking views ***:  Cerise or -if willing to drop the club experience- Cindy's at Chicago Athletic Hotel which may be the best view in Chicago.   This is just to name two.  In recent years, Chicago has really turned up its game in this department and the city today is dotted with amazing rooftop views. *** Want a scene*** :   In general, the majority of places will have a better crowd scene than ROOF; especially just about anywhere in River North.  Of course the answer here really depends on what night but in general the #1 ""club"" scene is still probably Underground or Studio Paris.   You still may encounter much of the same BS getting-in but at least these actually are usually a place to be seen.    Now if your idea of a good scene is a celeb sighting, I've personally seen more at Celeste than anywhere else.

Being a Chicago native and considering myself a connoisseur of rooftop bars I felt at home from the moment I arrived at the venue - in style that is - to the minute I walked out (thanks to Julian).  Getting out of my Uber to start the Saturday night I saw a huge line curling down the block and immediately thought, here we go again... But, a friend of mine told me to ask for a VIP host, Julian Cardona, when I reached the door and he actually came down from the rooftop to greet me, pulled me and my entourage under the rope, and we skipped the entire line. Boy was I in for a great night. As we were escorted into the elevator and got to the roof I realized how huge and packed of a venue it was. Julian was able to clear out a previous table reservation and put us in one of the best and private seats in the house (with one of the best waitresses in the staff).  Long story short, after experiencing an incredible evening he even escorted us back down and called an Uber for us! Before leaving he mentioned to come back next Sunday.

We got the Michelada pitcher; I forget what exactly went into, but all you need to know is that Cholula was one of the mixers. Very spicy and unique!

They have a patio in the back area which overlooks Chicago.  GREAT view.  I highly recommend going back there with a drink if you want to relax from the high paced music scene inside.

2015-07-30,2.0,"My first experience at the ROOF, and likely my last. The company I work for recently held a summer holiday party at the ROOF, which everyone was understandably excited for as we were promised a roped-off area fit for the size of the party (approx 30-40) and well as an open bar.  Upon arrival, we were told that our roped off area would be open to other patrons as well. To make amends, the manager offered us another hour of open bar, which in my opinion is a fair trade-off. The appetizers offered were great, with a vibrant presentation, full flavors, and a general quality befitting an upscale rooftop bar.  The attendants on the floor delivering drinks (with their telltale blue outfits) were very quick, courteous, and accurate throughout the night. Their great service alone would make the ROOF worth going back to. BUT! The entire experience was soured by the surly, rude, and cold raven-haired bartender with piercing eyes that could see into your soul who was serving drinks behind the north-facing side of the bar. Me and my girlfriend had arrived about an hour after the open bar period started and began to order drinks when the bartender swung a finger in my face and cut me off mid-sentence to tell me that we could only order one drink at a time, which wasn't an issue, because that was our first drink. As I was mingling with co-workers, I casually asked around to find out what people thought of the service, and at least EIGHT people all generally said the same thing: everything was pretty great, except the bartender is rude, to avoid her at all costs, and get your drink from a server in a blue outfit.  Maybe she was having a bad day, maybe she was upset that she had to work a private party, I dunno. But I highly doubt our Friday night open bar from 6-8PM was really cutting into her tips at a trendy rooftop bar that is open until 2AM. This all occurred about two weeks ago  and even now, when people mention the party, they go ""it was a fun night, but I don't want to deal with that one bartender again"" FULL DISCLOSURE: I am a former restaurant manager at a high-end bar/bistro, so I am factoring in that ""manager's eye"" that can develop when going to another bar or restaurant, but I think number of similar sentiments by my co-workers justifies this write-up.",0.9502,0.862,0.096,0.042,0.5239455782312924

The waitresses have to wear these blue and white uniforms which felt extremely tacky and leads me to believe the ROOF on theWit has an identity problem... I didn't know if I was in Chicago, Miami, or Las Vegas!! I became so confused... This came as a blessing, however, since service was scarce and I had to hunt down my waitress at least 3 times. I considered walking out without paying, but I hunted her down for the bill and waited another 20 minutes for change. If you know you're going to be that busy, add some more staff. I got a bit more confused.... The drinks and food are on the more expensive side. For one drink and one appetizer, I spent over $30. If I was in Vegas, I could have gotten the drink for free at a machine. If I was in Miami, I would have gotten a buzz off of said drink. Sadly, I was in Chicago and I paid a lot of money for a weak drink. I was so overly confused at this point.... The flat breads were really good, however, and I think reasonably priced! The sushi roll was mediocre and the wasabi was obviously paste-y horseradish that had been tinged green. I had to eat it sitting at a lounge couch because the nicer tables were already filled with a wide range of root top goers including young, ambitious professionals, older tourists, young sexy ladies, a family taking family portraits....

Each song was on for like 15 seconds and boom another song..then boom another. Couldn't even really get into the music with that DJ style. They need to get a new DJ. The songs were good but whoa not sure why they were mixed that way. 2) The capacity issue. I get it. Its a roof top and there are fire codes and what not but if someone who is paying hundreds of dollars for a table walks downstairs to go smoke and wants to come back he's out of luck if it is at capacity. Well uhhh how about if they have a wristband dont let another random person take their spot! Super frustrating system they have going on.

Recently returned for a friend's birthday party only to find a completely different kind of service.  Last Friday night, I bought a friend a drink for her birthday from a bartender who I tipped relatively well. My friend was socializing with her friends, but one of the go-go dancers who got up the table accidentally kicked her drink. I waited for an employee to walk by to help clean the spill. And this tall, bald guy with a beard in a suit passed us by, as he was placing ""Reserved"" signs on the tables. I politely asked him, ""Excuse me, sir. My friend's drink just got kicked off the table by your go-go dancer. How can we get a new one?"" His very condescending and dismissive response was ""I don't know. Buy a new one? I don't watch drinks."" And he simply walked away from the spill as if it was not there. Unimaginably sassy and completely unprofessional.  Slightly disconcerted, I walked to the same bartender who made the drink and briefly explained what happened. This bartender threw a mini tantrum, saying ""That was a $20 drink!"" He shook his head, began making the drink, seeming very upset. I said ""Thank you"" and handed him a $5 tip. Suddenly his mannerism changed, smiled and said ""Thanks! Here you go, buddy.""

So in that regard, the location certainly lost some of its appeal. Decor is snazzy, dark with the city lights illuminating two sides of the building, music was loud and not my taste.    When we were first seated, we requested seats near the windows, but none were available. The hostess was cordial, but initially we didn't see a server for some time. Finally, the server stopped by and handed us one menu (we were a party of 4). In the interim, a table at the window opened, but we could neither find our server nor the hostess. So, we just moved over and made our cocktail selections. Finally, a different server popped up and we asked that she find our server so we could order. (Disclaimer - We actually had a good server, she explained the drinks well, made good recommendations, took care of special requests and was friendly and competent. It seemed like she just had too many tables.)  The cocktails were good, though the size was small. I had a 'London Lemonade' which was fantastic. I'm a Lemon-Drop-girl-hold-the-sugar, and this was spot on. We found that the drinks ordered from the menu were far superior to off-menu drinks. They are definitely mixing up some tasty concoctions!  Lastly, the 'bouncer,' hostess and bathroom attendant were really exceptionally nice and friendly. Staff who don't get tipped but treat customers well are always a nice touch.

There is always a long line to get in later at night. However if you get there early, around seven or eight when it's just like any other normal hotel bar, you can grab a seat in the main room along the catwalk, a prime seating area that is rarely reserved. Then watch as the night goes on and people flood the place hoping you'll leave so they can grab your seat.  Music is always good and I love that they do fashion shows fairly often.

We booked a table (bottle service included), but never really got bottle service, or at least what bottle service could have been. Servers intermittently came around to pour cranberry-based drinks. It was one of those trendy nights where the dance floor area of the Wit was fully decked out as a club and dancer ladies clad in neon feather boas shook up on stage, which was kind of what we wanted I guess. Might I add, the music was SUPER loud. Anyway, we had a good time. I'm never quite sure how I feel about the Wit as it's definitely a fun rooftop bar to visit with your friends. However, it also tends to attract a particular brand of douche-y people that get really drunk, dance up on you not realizing you're not their friend, when in fact their friend is right in front of them dancing up against someone else.  The experience was fine, but what came after was different. I had left my purse on the couch while drinking, talking with friends, dancing, but at the end of the night I realized both my iPhone and my LV wallet with $200 in cash and all my ID's were missing. My friends and I searched our table and everywhere around it, to no avail.  During the coming days I called the bar again and again and even visited on a few occasions to see if I can recover anything. Each time I found nothing and the managers at both the hotel and the bar offered no help. Around three days afterward, I got an email from one of the managers saying they'd found just my ID's in a trash bag somewhere. Thank goodness!

Here is a break down of everything: Getting Inside: If you have a reservation you can skip the line.  Depending on the day the price for reserving will vary. It will include bottle service or a table minimum. Without a reservation get ready to stand.  From my experience it seems that they begin to let people in around 11:30pm. The cover is $10 for women and $20 for men. Ambiance: Its dark, sleek, and sexy.  There is a lounge in the front.  The vibe is a little more chill, but the music is still pumpin.  Its the place to sit and chat, hang out by the bar, or talk to that person you just met. In the oudoor space, whith a retractable roof, you feel the club vibe. There is a long table where Go-Go dancers will hop up and dance. The DJ is on the stage and the walls are lined with booths where those who have bottle service sit. Be sure to GET DRESSED.  They will not let you in, unless you are dressed right.  Men I would not try sneakers.  Ladies, you will see the straps come out.  Its a great place to go if you have been waiting to get dolled up. Drinks: The wine is excellent. The price is high. $16 and up. The cocktails are tasty but not strong at all. They will run you $14. Shots start around $7. Mixed drinks start around $10. They give a decent poor and the presentation is lovely for all of their drinks.  Id definitely say stick to the wine or mixed cocktails. Tuesdays they have $5 Coronas Food: Not like hotel food at all for being a part of a hotel.  But some of the dishes are misses.  Id stay stick to the mushroom flatbread. Impressively delicious.  And the chicken churizo sliders. Skip the white bean dip and skip the chicken skewers. Both were dry and lacked flavor.  Again, a bit pricey.  Everything is $14 and up for these small plates.  Id say stay stick to the two I mentioned above and it makes it worth it. Service: During the week and before 10pm service is awesome!  Attentive, kind, and want to give you tons of info on what to order.  After 10pm, good luck. It gets packed, so just know what you want and snag the first person you can to order.  At the bar, talk loud, clearly, and fast to get what you need because they are trying to get to everyone. If you are coming to visit Chicago Id say stop by here between 6pm and 8pm or after 12pm to avoid the line and then just be ready to pay for a pricey but energized night.",0.996,0.821,0.143,0.035,0.5797656840513983

Didn't really live up to the hype, wouldn't recommend it. Wasn't bad but there are better spots in the city.",0.7747,0.716,0.174,0.111,0.5635416666666667

The ROOF space at the Wit hotel has a beautiful view, trendy sleek furniture, a nice wine selection, and a good craft beer and cocktail menu.  Prices are high, but you're paying for the location.  But man, are the servers the biggest jerks in the world.  In. The. World.  I was there once with a friend and we were both looking appropriate in business casual wear.  We sat there for 40 minutes, like lepers, as servers walked us by with nary a glance.  Finally, my friend ordered a bottle of wine at the bar, and shortly thereafter we were handed an insincere apology. We had to ask three times for a bucket in which to chill our pricey bottle of white.    I experienced similar (lack of) service when there with a fairly large birthday party.  It doesn't appear as though they are understaffed ... it seems as though the staff is simply aloof or catering to a very specific designer scene-ster crowd. I'm deliberately choosing to not be part of that crowd, so if that means future trips to the Wit aren't in my future, that's the way it is.

Reminded me of a club in South Beach.  The menu of cocktails and beer were unimpressive and drinks were pricey. Luckily this evening there was no cover.  Ok no issue it is a trendy cool place so prices are going to be on the higher side but they had such a limited menu. I guess I am use to more creativity with cocktails and better beer choices. Our server was good she gave us good service.  I couldn't understand why the roof wasn't open. It looked like the ceiling and walls were glass but why were they closed.  Maybe they open it during certain times. Who knows?  My other issue with this pretty space is there was no music. If there was we sure couldn't hear it. Beautiful space but we were quite bored there so most of us left after about two hours.

Anything goat cheese related is a hit in my book. Though the food we tried was quite good, due to the atmosphere, noise, and the challenge in getting a table near a window, I don't think we are entirely sure we will hit this place up again.  I can't image why a high end hotel like theWit would be geared towards kids likely either just lawfully allowed to drink or those who haven't got anything better to do on a Thursday night than party.",0.8898,0.755,0.138,0.106,0.5398784722222222

We started with about 15 girls, but that number dwindled as the night went on. We were not really dressed in ""club attire,"" as we were at a day event before going out. We sat at the middle bar where the go-go dancers do their thing, trying our best to stay out of the servers' path while dancing. After an hour or two of having a blast, two bouncers approached our party and asked THE BRIDE to leave. ""There have been complaints from other customers. You've been over-served."" I'm fairly certain the only ""complaints"" were from the staff because we didn't choose to pay for a package or bottle service. Speaking of the staff, they are a lackluster group, at best. If I'm going to spend $14-20 on a cocktail, I'd much rather stroll over to a place that serves it with a smile and some character.  After they ruined a perfectly great and memorable night, we realized the bride lost her veil during her time being escorted out. They took her into a staff only room.

You have to know that we were wearing beach clothes and it became pretty apparent that we were the oddballs without our bandage dresses, stilettos, and Louis Vuitton Speedy bags. Obviously we had missed a memo. We got our mimosas and some small bites and found a spot at the end of the community table. The DJs were good and the people-watching was more than prime. All of the servers were dressed as Justice League characters, which was pretty entertaining but what was more entertaining was all the rubber necking going on between the guys and the Wonder Woman costumed servers. Then things really got fun when the dancers got on the tables and performed some kind of S&M themed dance, much to the pleasure of every male in the room. My girl friend and I were dying laughing at this point, and really enjoying our $20 mimosas (ridiculous!). We stayed for a few hours and then decided we had had enough for a lazy Sunday and called it quits. The tab came and it wasn't pretty.

2014-07-21,2.0,"Went here for a birthday celebration and was looking forward to it as I've heard a lot of hype.   I would not return and do not think it was worth the price we paid to be there.    This is for a younger crowd, no doubt, who still think it's cool to be treated as if you're lucky to be there while paying through the nose for the ""privilege"".  We were a group of 13 and had a $1500 minimum for our 3 hour party. This meant we wouldn't have to wait in line  (oooh, aren't we special?/)  But make no mistake, you WILL be waiting at some point.   We had pre-ordered appetizers, which were delivered slowly, but much, much faster than the drinks.  Over 3 hours, I received 4 drinks and that was because by the third time we had to order, I asked the server to bring me 2 so I would not have to wait.  Everyone in our party experienced the same.  We were given 1 booth to seat 13 people and told some would have to stand.  I asked for the table next to us, since it was open and our party was spending $1500--minimum.  We did get this table so that's why I will at least give it 2 stars.   The drinks were watered down to say the least.  Food was decent.  It was quite obvious the server was not giving us the full attention she would have if the bill (and of course, tip)  were not already set.    Now, as far as the ""rooftop experience"" the open air was great on a summer evening, though some of the views are of the a/c units on the roof next door. The experience changed at 10 p.m when the roof and side windows were shut and the DJ began.  Loud, thumping music and hot as a greenhouse!  No longer a ""roof top-- just a club.  And I am too old for a club.  I was expecting a more high-end, relaxing experience for the price.  This was an over-priced Studio 54-vibe.",0.9393,0.893,0.072,0.035,0.4466880341880342

I'll start with the bad:  We arrived at 4:45 and stood in a short line (there was only 2 groups in front of us when we got there) for an hour, which was ridiculous.  When we got in the place wasn't even that crowded.  Why the bouncers were holding everyone up from going in (unless you bought table service or knew someone already in there) is beyond me.  The drinks are expensive ($7 for a bud light, $12 for a shot of Belvedere vodka), but it's expected at a place like this in the city.  Just be prepared.  The staff wasn't very friendly - the girl bartenders didn't have any positivity to them and were so rude.  Also the retractable roof was closed even though it was 80 degrees and sunny - I didn't understand that either. In any case, the vibes were really good here.  It did feel like a private party in a sense - smaller crowd made it feel like you're at an exclusive club.  Manufactured Superstars is a pretty well known DJ who perform in big Vegas venues (XS Nightclub for example) and I liked how we were able to get right by the DJ booth and have enough room to move around and dance.  Good looking crowd for the most part.  There half naked, attractive girls that worked there dancing on the center tables which was nice to add to the scenery.  Music was good, nice sound system.  The views are incredible.   Overall I would come back but get there early to avoid waiting an hour to move two feet.",0.9891,0.768,0.172,0.06,0.5272108843537415

(this isn't 100%, but a good majority)  the guys there all have at least 3 buttons on their shirt undone and are constantly looking around for a hookup, the women all look alike- short black dress with heels they can't walk in and they all look like cracked out party girls.  The girl dancing next to me was in her mid 20s, had on a wedding ring but proceeded to grind and make out with a random guy (not her husband)  that she later went home with.  I thought this was going to be a classy place... was very disappointed.  These people dress to impress and have all the confidence in the world, but no real class or character.    Like I said before; great location, great music, good atmosphere, just awful people.",0.9823,0.782,0.154,0.063,0.4843869731800766

A few times as a regular paying customer on a Sunday, once reserved a cabana ($1500), and for memorial day Sunday reserved a table ($800). This particular weekend we even decided to be guest of the hotel as well!!!!! I reserved this for a 30th bday celebration and had 6 friends fly in for the weekend. This was suppose to be the highlight of the weekend but NO it was NOT! First of all we were all CRAMMED into two tiny little couches with a tiny coffee table for our table. We were going to eat brunch but without a table we did not. I thought we would have been out in the main room with an actual table. I asked to be moved but was told there were full. The tables that were ""reserved"" that we couldn't sit in remained empty the entire time we were there. So we order a bottle of grey goose and our ""server"" Taylor brings us the bottles, ice, and mixers. Everything is fine, (just fine) when one of my friends asks our server for a beer and she looks at him like he's crazy so he goes to the bar to order it. Even though we HATE where we are located at least now we have a drink in our hands. We then order a second bottle and it comes out. Then service started to slow down a bit. We ran out of ice and mixers and were left for a long time like that. I then got up and flagged down another server who was amazing! I told the server I flagged down that we were out of everything and had been for a while and wanted another bottle. She said she would send Taylor over. After waiting FOREVER on Taylor to return my friends were so furious with service that they decided they would rather spend their money elsewhere. So when Taylor did finally come over I told her we were ready to leave and need the check. She brings over the bill and we were charged for 3 bottles. I told  her we clearly didn't have 3 bottles and she said ""but you asked for a 3rd one"" and I said ""but we didn't order it so you need to take it off""! She gave me attitude and stomped off. She came back with the correct bill and we paid and got the heck out of there! We had planned on staying the entire day and though out the evening but didn't. We would have spent a lot of money there that day like I normally do when I visit the roof for Sunday but nope not this time and NEVER again! Oh and did I mention earlier in our visit I went to the restroom where I crossed paths with Taylor and she grabbed my wrist and asked me what was in my hand? I opened it and said its a starburst I got at the bar! She said ""bummer I thought it was something fun""! So I'm guessing she wanted drugs? Before we left she was crying to another server like drunks girls do! I'm only guessing she was drunk from the way she was acting etc! Anyways point is I have spent a lot of money at the roof and use to love it, my friends were not impressed and I will never go back and really there are way better places where I can spend tons of money!

We were first taken to State and Lake, where we sampled some appetizers (the pretzels there are amazing!!), including some cheese, prosciutto, and deviled eggs (which is supposed to be really good, but I thought was just alright). They carry Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc, which is my favorite sauvignon blanc from New Zealand. I had the Hummingbird, which has blackberry preserves-- delicious. We were then taken up to ROOF, where we tried the duck fat fries (still a bit soggy), the sushi (which was pretty darn good!), and some pizza. I actually had a chance to try the Pizza Tetto- pizza with pine nuts, mushroom and sausage-- a pretty interesting combo. I just love anything with pine nuts. For cocktails, I tried the skinny model diet-- not my favorite drink.  I really like the Lounge/Living Room area--- there's AMAZING views from all around. Also, there are some super soft fuzzy black chairs-- and I love the decor-- houndstooth furniture mixed in with some black couches.I love mixed and matched furniture. But once I walked into the Atrium, I was even more blown away. It was so light and airy, and felt so relaxing. There was even live music on Tuesday night--- a guy playing the guitar who was REALLY good. I could have hung out there for hours, just sipping on cocktails, snacking on sushi, and listening to the singer. Then we were taken to a private theater room, where we were served desserts from the Phoenix Room.

When we went it was so strange. Remember it's on the roof of a hotel so there were a fair amount of tourists as well as folks who like us were just passing through so on the earlier side, the crowd was decided older. My guess is as the evening progresses, it shifts younger. View is fantastic and like many clubs, it has a DJ, abstract images projected above the bar for no apparent reason (I guess it's cool?) and an attractive waitstaff. Cocktails were good so I give them props for knowing how to make an excellent Sidecar and Pimms Cup. Not your average club-goer drink and both were very well done. My advice is the older you are, the earlier you should go. When we left around 8 it was starting to fill up and the crowd was changing.

On the off nights it is an enjoyable  place for a nice drink and chat but be careful of the movie night nights because they are so loud!  I did, unfortunately, have a lousy experience with a server and with a bartender. The server was a young woman who seemed to be having a lousy day. She came by and rudely asked us what we wanted to drink. When my father asked for a drink, she said, we don't have that. This, I knew to be untrue because I had ordered the same drink only moments earlier at the bar. I proceeded to kindly tell her that I, in fact, was drinking what he requested. She turned to me and told me I was wrong and that she knows what they serve. I kindly replied and told her to just go and ask the bartender to serve it. She came back several minutes later with my father's drink but with no apology for arguing against us. I know it's not terrible but it was still unpleasant and unnecessary. An appropriate respond would have been, 'I'm not sure if we have that but let me go check.'  The other experience with the bartender on a separate occasion was far worse. I wasn't even getting my drinks for this guy but when I went to close out my tab the guy, some immensely buff crew cut guy, as I was approaching said, 'what do you want?' Aggressively as if I was doing something wrong. When I told him that I wanted to close out my tab he said, 'I don't have a tab for you, what do you mean close it out,' I looked for my server that had been helping me earlier before I left to stand outside and he said, 'hey! I said you don't have a tab,' then I saw her and said to her hey can I close out my tab?' The bartender guy then yelled, 'so you had a server not a tab!' And when I tried explaining to him that I closed out my bill with her and opened a tab he again yelled and said, 'I told you you don't have a tab and now you need to close out your bill with your server!' I then saw my server hand the bartender my bill and tell him the situation and then he came and threw it, literally, down in front of me. Very unpleasant and unprofessional.

Not half bad, but served in half a martini glass (the one's with no stem, which I dislike). The music was ear-splitting but I actually took out something I wanted to read. At which point a waitress came over and said, ""I see you're trying to relax, but if you want anything just let me know."" Always selling here.

The first night we were able to get a table, but in the middle of our enjoyment and our food, someone rushed by and slapped a ""reserve"" sign on it, and asked if we were leaving soon.  When I snapped 'no' plus the rest of the company is all here for a conference (and pointing a bunch of them out), we got a very nice ""Oh, then, never mind the sign, stay as long as you like"".  Not good.  The waitress was not particularly good either, we had to flag her down several times.

The space is nice, but they're trying too hard to give off some exclusive club vibe where you have to reserve the tables for a price (in the open-air area, that's what I overheard the server say, again, I really wasn't paying attention).  Laughable, and I've experienced better rooftops.",0.9891,0.841,0.138,0.021,0.5269978106185003

While walking to the front door of TheWit we were met by a lady with a badge (Hotel Security) telling us that the entrance to the bar was around the corner. Rounding the corner we find there is a line to get into the bar. First clue that this place is full of it!  Standing in line, and not understanding why we were made to wait outside near garbage bins, two groups ahead of us decided it was not worth the wait to get in. When the folks arrived, they said that they had called and made reservations, but upon calling and asking the bar staff how to avoid the line, we were told there is no reservation under their name, and if there was one, it would have cost $100/per person. Seriously!? Where do they think we are, it's just Chicago, it's not New York. I've been to New York plenty of times, and I have never experienced this. Finally we just gave up and left.  After finding another place to eat, which was much better than the Roof, we came to collect my father's car at TheWit. While standing there waiting, that same security guard had the gall to try to shoo us off the sidewalk. Again, another failure by the management at TheWit.  For the same money you would drop drinking $14 water down drinks, you could cross the river and hit up a plethora of better places.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I have been here before, but it has been a few years.

Located in the Wit Hotel, patrons of Roof are forced to wait outside half way into a garbage-y alley for a table/entrance into the bar. Close to 1/2 an hour later, we just decided to throw in the towel. The line hadn't moved and it was close to 90 degrees. Just not worth it. This isn't NYC!  Now, the question may be, why not wait in the Wit?  Well, there is now a security guard outside the hotel checking key cards. We were even hustled away from standing on the sidewalk. I wonder if the hotel and Roof have simply experienced a high level of nonsensical behavior because this is such a ""coooool place"" (can you sense the sarcasm?)

2013-08-25,3.0,"While at the Mondrian Hotel in Miami, I met some visitors from Chicago and was referenced a few spots to visit during my stay in Chicago. Roof was one of those spots and coincidentally happened to be a walk across the street from my hotel! Woo hoo for minimal walking and not having to take a cab! The hotel itself is really contemporary and chic. Lots of white and silver accents. Anyway, you take the elevator up to the roof and you're there! It's a sexy little lounge by night and apparently a day party by day.  My experience at ROOF was on a Thursday night and I was immediately charmed by the sexy little couches, candles, and long tall windows overlooking the skyline and sky scrapers of Chicago. The music consisted of house music and remixes of top 40 hits. What gave ROOF a unique and memorable touch was that there was a violinist playing along with the contemporary hits. ROOF is a sexy little spot that boasts dimmed neon lights and a giant LED screen (sound familiar, Miamians?) with a live DJ. What I noticed was that there were a lot of tourists and people in shorts and flats. I keep reading reviews saying ""dress to impress"". I dressed up because I'm from Miami and that's what we do when we go out (lol) but had I worn flats and a day outfit I would've fit in just fine. Heck, I could've gone straight off the plane and been fine. As the night progressed, I did start to see older men in suits and a more sophisticated crowd pop in. The service was not great... Our waitress was really difficult to get ahold of and she rarely came by. The drinks were alright, I tried one of their signature drinks from the menu and it was good but not anything to go home and write about.  ROOF wasn't crazy full which I liked but I heard that it gets pretty rowdy during their Sunday day party. On my last night out in Chicago (Sunday), we decided to check out ROOF again and one of their day parties was just about over but the lounge was still open. When we were going in, there were some drunk people fighting outside the entrance and when we took the elevator upstairs, the whole staff was dressed in super hero costumes. I creeped on instagram and saw some rowdy pictures of the place during the day. I'm kind of glad I didn't go during the day because it would've reminded me of some trash box Miami spots. I think it's a little bit corny that The Wit has stickers all over the elevator that say how ROOF is one of the top roof lounges in the world...

How could I not try a drink named Angry birds.  It gets a little extra credit from me for using one of my favorite herbs, sage, in the mix.  It came together with the grapefruit juice to make a very mellow and slightly tart drink that wasn't overwhelmed with an abundance of sweetness.  The show-stealer was the  Bangkok Surprise.  It successfully combined basil, mint and lemongrass into this drink that disguises the strong nature of the alcohol involved by playing it off of the herbal notes and creates a pretty awesome drink.  It even inspired me to make a few drinks of my own.",0.9927,0.729,0.232,0.039,0.6913333333333332

The DJ was FANTASTIC! Also, since it is in the hotel, the crowd was mixed between club & casual clothes, which I loved!  The only gripe I had was that the bartender sucked! I'm sorry, but for a $13 cocktail I expect a good drink. My drink was watered down, my friend's mojito tasted off, and my other friend's drink was horrible. So if you're looking for a good cocktail, you won't find it here.  I asked for a glass of wine (since I knew they couldn't mess that up), but the bartender said he did not have it. Wtf?

When we got the bill, she said her manager wouldnt take it off, so we asked to speak with her. She argued that the drink was made right and she samples everything, we didnt argue that it was made wrong, rather that it wasn't what we expected.

When a customer is hurt by a staff, something should be done, at least as simple as an apology for instance.  In a nutshell, I went there with a few people for my birthday on a Monday night. We had a bottle service and expected to have a blast. The night started off nicely and pleasantly until I had to use a ladies' room. I was walking towards the room by the bar, next thing I know, this server came out of nowhere and smashed his tray right in my eye. It was so painful and unbearable for a few minutes. That server asked if I was ok, apologized, then walked away. This incident was witnessed by my friends and couple other people by the bar. I didn't want to make a scene so I sat back down at the table and asked for a bag of ice. I sat at my own birthday party with a bag of ice on my bruised eye until the end. The bill came to $595 with 20% gratuity. I asked our server if there was anything the manager could do about the whole ordeal.  Our server kept walking back and forth delivering the messages from the manager. The final message was that there was nothing he could do because the server that hit me with a tray left for the night and wasn't there to tell his side of the story.

2013-03-31,3.0,"This is a difficult review to make. Although I love the ambience and the views of the city are some of the best, the $20 cover for guys is kind of ridiculous as well as the prices for bottled beer are incredibly too high. I can understand mixed drinks, but not beer. Besides that, the service is very good and the bartenders are very pleasant considering the amount of traffic this place sees. That's also leads to another point. This place gets incredibly crowded in the warmer times of the year. Some of the best nights to check out the ROOF at the wit are summer nights, but it makes it quite difficult to enjoy it when you are elbow to elbow with tons of people. It also makes it quite difficult to then go to the bar to order drinks. Personally I would think restricting less people in to increase the movability would increase everyone's overall experience. I thought that's why cover charges existed to offset the the restricted admittance, especially a $20 cover (for guys, $10 for gals). Anyways, By all means check this place out, but be prepared to pay cover on weekends, to have to pay a little bit more for cocktails, and to have to deal with lots of people on great summer nights.

I mentioned it again and, of course, got back a drink with so much tequila I could have been breathing fire.  I worked at a tequila bar at the time and knew tequila very well and, again, it was well liquor and absolutely not what I paid for.  I also began to notice that we were some of the most overdressed people there.  We had some spare time between a wedding ceremony and the reception, so I was wearing heals and a dress, while other guests were in jeans; awkward, to say the least.  Bottom line, even if you can afford to buy the place, it really is not worth the money.  The decor is not meant or stationed right to be able to quietly converse with someone if it so happiness to be busy, so I would not recommend it for an intimate or first date.  The view is great, but there are definitely better alternatives.",0.1763,0.831,0.081,0.088,0.4935293703586386

That area would be good for larger groups. The two stars come off for my drink and what happened at the end of the evening. First my drink. I ordered a Desert Oasis and it was straight up nasty. It was like drinking pure lemon juice or something. Not at all what I was expecting. My salivary glands are still recovering from the shock. After forcing myself to drink it, when I should've sent it back, I went with a beer. Can't go wrong with that. The second issue was that our server came by at 7:30 to inform us that the bartender was going to be issuing a last call at 7:45 and then we had to move to the other side of the bar (to the less intimate setting.) The majority of the people there were very small groups, or on dates, it seemed.

I had heard so many good things and that this was THE place to visit. I guess I wouldn't have been as disappointed if it hadn't been so built up for me. To be fair, the bar itself wasn't bad. And the view was incredible! The problem that I had was that it was so packed that we couldn't move. Normally in such a situation I would turn around and just walk out, maybe come back another time, but after the wait and the cover to get in I was determined to at least give it a chance. After about 20 minutes my friends and I were able to secure enough seats for about half of us. Also I was luckily to have within our little crew someone who is able to get to the front of the bar and get served immediately. So we always had a drink in our hand. That along with the view made the night fairly memorable.  The problem was I might have been there by myself. The music was so loud that I wasn't able to hear my friends talking directly into my ear. Every now and again one of us would motion  for a few of us to walk around and take a look at the views in other directions, but just communicating that took a couple minutes and the required navigation through the crowd just to get to a different window almost made it not worth it.  The drinks were fine, nothing spectacular. Though I did get a chance to see some of the groups that ordered table service. That look pretty cool. A small crew of waitresses would dance out with a bottle of vodka and mixers with sparklers on top and then serve a group of people that looked very comfortable in cushiony sofas. It looked very nice, but thats coming from someone who was struggling not to fall off of a seat/planter that I was sharing with someone else, while I was holding an empty drink because I wasn't in the mood push my way through a crowd to the bar and I didn't have the heart (or the necessary vocal cords) to ask my friend to go.

We had the luxury of arriving in a party bus so we didn't have to worry about parking or valet; awesome way to start the night. The crowd was a little packed when we arrived because they were showing one of the NBA Finals games on the TV, but it loosened up as soon as the game was over. There is a huge section that's wide open with tables lining the walls and middle (pictures available), and TV's as well. This is the section you want to be in if you plan on dancing and being a little wild. There's another section on the opposite side of the roof where it's definitely more lounge-ish, with leather couches and raised tables available; I spent most of my time around here.  The walls are massive windows revealing some of the beautiful buildings in Chicago, showing off the bright lights we love to see. The view was a perfect backdrop for relaxing comfortably and enjoying a few drinks with a group of friends. The size of Roof accommodated our group perfectly to the point that everyone was comfortable and able to move loosely should they decide to wander off in the crowd. The service was suprisingly nice. I say ""surprisingly"" because the bar areas are kind of small and I imagined it to be difficult to get a drink, but it wasn't. BUT, when you DO get your drinks, be prepared to cough up a few extra dollars because it isn't cheap. My friend ordered a pitcher of mojito and dished out a cool $110, yes, $110, not including tip. But again, it should be expected when you're venturing into a place as deep into the city as Roof is. I enjoyed the overall attire, which is dressy (men in dress shirts/blazers, women in dresses/heels). It definitely veered from some of the trash you might be used to seeing around Chicago.

Cover was $10, which I didn't care for since there were no special guest djs; there wasn't even a dance floor for that matter, nor anything really special about this place. Had I known I probably would not have bothered with the place. Anyhow, paid cover. Waited for the elevator man, got up to the Roof and was sadly disappointed-- not a real rooftop patio. Sure, the entire place is encased in floor to ceiling glass windows so you can see the buildings around you, and the place itself was very visually stunning and modernly decorated, but I expected an open-air patio. I do believe there is a door to the open air part of the 'roof' but I did not see it. Then again I didn't look too hard, I suppose.

At the end of the night another hostess comes and offers dessert on the house. REALLY!!! We declined the offer. We did not want to risk having to wait another hour for dessert.  Let me tell you it was a party of four we were there from 6:30-9:30 to eat appetizers and drinks and the bill was over $300.

However, it is a hotel bar, so I don't know what one could expect (or hope for) other than unpredictability and diversity.

I visited during the daytime in winter and I couldn't have been happier with my time there. It was just after one of the few snowfalls we had this winter; the air was clear, the view stunning. As a side note about the view, if you have innocent voyeuristic tendencies, maybe you like to watch strangers walk in and out of their kitchens and living rooms, this is the place to go. Other than the view, they have some really cool fire features, nice bathrooms, interesting drinks, great snack/light meal options.

During the summer weekend nights, expect a little wait and a small cover fee, but normally worth it.  Biggest complaint I've heard of is the price of drinks, but they are normally pretty well mixed and ""c'mon man"" (or woman) you are living in Chicago and if you want a nice night out, you are always going to pay a little more. It was like $10 on average for a mixed drink and I have no real complaints of paying that much. I do really enjoy getting a small appetizer with the drinks, and have been really impressed with the Foraged Mushrooms & Spinach Flatbread. Just something about it coming out on the hot plate and always hits the right spot. I really like the trendy atmosphere, upon walking into the Wit they normally have a band or good music playing, once you arrive up on the ROOF, it is an amazing view of the city as well as great decor. If you go with a group of several people, plan on putting in a reservation or waiting for a table. I'm a fan of the usual cover band on the weekdays, except sometimes it takes away from the mood. Usually a great selection of music, although sometimes it seems like it is overpowering your conversations and are a bad attempt at covers. We've definitely had some great times on the roof/patio, but as of late our experiences haven't been as great as it seems like they have been understaffed this winter and early spring.

So might want to leave earlier to get a seat.  They do charge a cover but since we were guests of the hotel we did not have to pay that. I believe it was around $20 bucks.  This was a very fun, trendy and stylish bar. It was a bit pricey but great views of the city. There were a few negatives though. 1) Its a very small space the pictures make it look huge but none of the outdoor areas were open due to it being winter so maybe those areas are bigger. 2) Due to it being a smaller bar/ lounge they do have the music super loud and almost a little unnecessary, I think if they had the music lower it would have a bit more of an intimate feel as oppose to a club. But on that note the music was really fun hip-hop/club music. 3) The tables were reservation only so if you didn't get a spot at the bar you are standing and almost feeling in the way. Luckily we got a spot at the bar after waiting for a few people to leave. But move fast!! The service was pretty good,  although we really only dealt with one bartender and he didn't know how to make two shots that we ordered I had to look them up on my iphone for him.

2011-10-26,2.0,"I attempted to visit the Roof for the second time a few weeks ago. A few Elite Yelpers and I met for cocktails last year at the Phoenix Lounge event. I loved the views and the vibe was pretty swanky. I had a fabulous time. One of my friends, who was visiting Chicago for Chicago Ideas Week as a speaker, wanted to grab after-dinner drinks with his colleagues and us. I chose the Roof, as it was close to their dinner venue, it had a happening scene, and I had that a positive experience from before. Unfortunately, my boyfriend, David, couldn't get in. When he gets gussied up, he looks pretty damn dapper and clean-cut. He was dressed in fashionable, yet classic Italian clothing. It was very appropriate for the Roof, except ... For his shoes.  No, they weren't Nike, Converse, or anything flashy or tacky. They were nice, conservative, dark (black, even) sneakers. They weren't dirty or worn at all.  The bouncers acted ""too cool"" for him. As if they were doing my boyfriend a favor by letting him into the establishment. Actually, my boyfriend didn't even ask to go in yet (we were still waiting for my friend) and the bouncer took it upon himself to refuse David entrance to the Roof. The bouncer was extremely rude and insulting.  I'd like to note that David was with me and we weren't in a group of poorly dressed male d-bag wannabes. If I was a bouncer, perhaps I would be a little lenient if a guy (dressed to the nines) wants to come in with his girl.  Anyway, the bouncers' arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude prompted us (a group of 8+) to seek another bar. It wasn't worth the hassle or cost (men = $20, women = $10, drinks = $$$). (For the record, there were numerous other groups that were unhappy with their experience that night as well, even the ones coming out of the lounge. I thought it was particularly amusing that MANY other groups like ours went elsewhere after encountering the bouncers at the door. I'm sure the Roof lost hundreds to thousands of dollars that night in drinks, cover charges, tips and more.)

2011-10-07,4.0,"I've been coming to Roof since it opened and have always had a great time here. I think the main trick to Roof is to come during the week, not on a Friday or Saturday, if you're looking for a more normal experience. If you want lines around the corner and more of a scene, then come on the weekend. Once in a while this place is even packed at 5 pm during the week, but I've found that to be rare. Most recently I came here after work with a friend on a Thursday. We had no problem getting a table right away. My gin gimlets were delicious as were the fries. I will say, however, that their portions of fries have gone way down in size over the past year or so. Roof is hardly the first place to do that kind of thing, however. The service was great considering there was only one server for the entire indoor area. She brought our drinks quickly and had a nice attitude.  The drinks are not cheap here, but they are in line with what I would expect at a bar like this in this location. One thing that's a bit annoying here, however, is that if you order a gin and tonic, for example, and don't specify the type of gin, they'll automatically give you Hendrick's or something of that caliber (rather than well gin). So if you're looking for a cheap mixed drink (or cheaper), then I would recommend specifying that that's what you're looking for. As for the clientele here, I feel it really runs the gamut. Yes, there are people in suits, etc. but there are also plenty of people who just wander in for a drink in their tourist duds--this is a hotel, after all.

Trust Fund Babies - ""It's just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as it is a poor man,"" right? Wrong.  That's great that you have millions of dollars, sir, but you can not dress, you are bald, and you still live with your parents at the age of 28, so while I will certainly take the drinks you're buying, NO, I do not want to go to dinner with you.  If you're so wealthy, get your own place.  And a stylist.    2. Clingy Girls - If I had a dollar for every girl that made sure to mark her territory if her boyfriend looked my way, my children would be trust fund babies too.  I'm pretty sure every girl in this bar thinks she's at a middle school dance.  If you look at their man or their man looks at you, watch out, because you're about to witness some softcore porn.  She will jump on him and start sucking face while her rear end hangs out of her dress just to keep you away.  In fact, my best advice to you ladies is to just keep staring at your drink, because one wrong look (even the unintentional ones) and the girls turn possessively psycho.   3. Starvation - Don't plan on eating here.  All we wanted was an appetizer.  We asked three employees and each one said they'd send someone over and mysteriously that someone never came.  Now I realize that most of the half-dressed ladies in the bar probably don't eat, but we had money to spend and tummies to fill.  Had I gotten some nourishment, I probably would have drank more too.  Your loss.  (Oh wait, probably my loss...of 3 pounds due to starvation.)        4.

2011-08-23,3.0,"On an otherwise gorgeous Sunday afternoon, my friend noticed a woman come out of the bathroom here in a t-shirt wrapped just under her breasts, black underwear and high heels. She tapped this obviously drunken woman (I mean, who leaves a bathroom like that?) to inform her that the woman had forgotten her pants in the stall. Turns out that's not the case, and that she was in fact dancing on the long glass dining table in the outdoor section of Roof, the obvious and effectively named bar at the top of theWit hotel. There're two halves to Roof, both in the physical layout and the customers who come here for the expensive drinks and bottle service they provide. On one hand you've got hard-core club goers, women and men* pumping their fist to the beats** to the loud-even-with-no-roof*** section of the club, which on beautiful days like this gets crowded even at not crowded times. The other half of the bar is an enclosed space tan couches and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the glory that is Chicago. I'd never noticed how cool the El looks from overhead, but it had a real SimCity vibe to it. On this side, at least during the day, you'll find the residents of the hotel who just wanted to have a drink, and who wear fanny packs**** and have pleated khakis with white sneakers. They don't know how they got here, and don't really know what to do except to sit there and look awkward with their $15 vodka tonic, but they paid for their drink and they're going to make the best of it. Roof isn't, obviously, for everyone and it's not really my style. That doesn't mean that it's not good, though, and if you're into that kind of a tribal-tattoo, little black dress-fest in a swanky environment with great views and expensive drinks, you should definitely head to Roof. * - both genders GTL'd to the nines. ** - not actually happening, but there was one table of guys who had a hot waitress serving them vodka shots straight out of a Grey Goose bottle.

The first time I came here was on a Thursday night for a friend's pseudo-bachelor party. We came after the roof part was already closed so it was less crowded, but still a good amount of people. Took a bit for the waitress to take our initial drink order but she made up for it by checking up frequently and making sure we were never empty handed. The DJ played some good music from what I remember, too. Friday happy hour crowd seemed to be a mix of hotel guests(aka tourists) and after work crowd, as to be expected. Again, no complaints about the service here. Oh and they played some Bone Thugs, which seemed odd given the venue, but any place that plays BTNH is alright in my book.  Overall, I'd say check this place out; if only for one drink. The view is pretty nice and I've had no problems with the service.

First, since I stay at the hotel, I get to ""fast pass"" up to the place, be it from the lobby or directly from my room. This is awesome because I have seen the line outside get pretty crazy after work. I cannot imagine spending 20-30 minutes outside for what is up there. So what is up there? Well first, dudes who have more money than brains, and the subsequent annoying ladies hoping to go home with them that night because of it. Second, staff that really could care less about you, even if you tip decently. Third are drinks that really disappoint. For example, the last mojito I had there had wilted mint, quasi-brown lime and little alcohol...it was something like $12 from a surely bartender who wouldn't even look me in the eye.

Their wine and champagne list was pretty good, although pricey.  They also serve food, although I'm not sure at what time, and we did not sample anything.   They had these built-in gas fireplaces down the middle of the seating area outside.  They had pagoda umbrellas...and the view!  What a great view!  It reminded me of Ghost bar in The Palms in Las Vegas.  I guess there is quite a line to get in on the weekend, but we had no trouble on a Sunday evening.   If I were to have any complaint it had more to do with the clientele than the lounge.  I couldn't believe how ""shabbily"" some of the people were dressed.  I think the classiness of the place would oblige one to put a little more thought into the outfit.  I'm sorry...tennis shoes are appropriate at the gym...that's about it.  I will definitely check this out again, maybe have some apps and stay a little longer.  Maybe see if the Saturday night people look a little better.  :)",0.9238,0.842,0.107,0.051,0.49061302681992336

Warning though: I can deal with expensive drinks when I'm in the city but these prices are almost bordering on insane.  In the future, I'd only stop by during non prime time, the late night crowd isn't really my style (see other reviews) Nor do I care to wait in line to get in.

It's a fun spot to get a few sunday cocktails  only- there is a DJ (be ready for a club-esque feel followed by confusion since it's day time), a phenomenal violinist, and bathing suit clad girls dancing on the center table.  Went there in a group of 4 to get brunch. Asked for coffee, it came in a dirty mug (sticky honey and coffee stains on the rim, I had to ask for a new one). Also came without cream, milk or sugar. Had to ask for all of the items, but our waitress kept forgetting them. After 15 min, got them, but then coffee was cold. Our waitress was the worst.  Not a great selection for brunch items - there were very limited egg dishes, etc. Ordered an asparagus and crispy egg dish, $14 and not at all good. Mushrooms were saturated in oil and the crispy egg dish squired yolk out unexpectedly. Gross.  The flat bread was nothing special at all, actually didn't really even like it. French toast was soggy.  All in all, the service and food was AWFUL. I was shocked that this place would not have done a better job w/ the brunch, given such an amazing location. Highly disappointed. It's far from a classy place if that's what you're looking for.

2011-06-21,3.0,"This was my first time at this bar and I was a little skeptical after reading other reviews about it. But either way I wanted to check out the awesome view of the city while sipping a cranberry vodka. So my friend and I arrived at the hotel's entrance about 11:30 PM on Thursday night. We didn't know there was a line at the elevators on the first floor to the right for the bar so we jumped on an elevator to the left and went up. We met the Bouncer who told everyone that rode up with us that we had to ride the elevator back down and get in line. My friend and I didn't cram into the elevator that everyone else got into and instead got into another just the two of us plus a bouncer guy letting people up from the line. We were talking to the hot bouncer and he told us to just stay in the elevator while he let people in from the line on the first floor. Getting to bypass the line and head back up to the bar was a great way to start the night! We got into Roof to find the place packed! There was no cover charge so we squeezed our way out onto the open bar area but couldn't find a space to get a drink at the bar so we headed inside and luckily found a spot. The first thing I had noticed were the snooty people who were surrounding us. I had read that this place attracts douchebags later on into the night and I must agree. Girls at the bar giving evil eyes to other girls and guys trying to look cool on the couches with their expensive food in front of them. The bartender at the farthest bar to the left from the entrance would not even look at my friend and I until another bartender from the bar beside ours saw us and got our drinks. $12 for a cranberry vodka was out of control! I went to many other bars on this vacation to Chicago and had not found a place that served mixed drinks for over $8 until this place. Plus our drinks were not strong at all. We moved to the first bar beside the entrance where the bartenders were more attentive. We started ordering straight vodka on ice to save money instead of ordering a dozen drinks for $200 to just feel a buzz. This place is very overpriced. But the view was great and the music was alright. If you're not comfortable around dbags and skanky girls being, well, skanks then don't come here. When we were waiting for our first drink while being ignored by the bartender we couldn't help but notice the two wasted girls at the other side of the bar grinding on  some creepy looking dudes. It wasn't pleasant but I feel like at this place it's nothing out of the ordinary. Have some class girls! The outside bar closed before 1 AM so we didn't get to enjoy the view from out there. I sat my drink on the bar by the pizza oven and a bouncer popped out of nowhere and told me I could not sit my drink there. So I picked it up and pushed my way to another bar.  So in conclusion this bar was nice but be prepared to wait awhile to get in and be surrounded by mostly snoots. And have lots of dough on you for these watered down, ridiculously expensive drinks.",0.9718,0.849,0.093,0.057,0.47546437014522114

I had the opportunity to check out Roof's brunch menu over the holiday weekend recently, and I'm still dreaming about it.  Seriously!  My guests and I started off our afternoon with some fresh mimosa's, and they were follow by their special french toast (which I seriously think they laced with 'crack', because they were seriously that good and addictive**side note** ((just say no to drugs kids)).)  The GM insisted that we try them, and I cannot thank him enough for his suggestion.  Bravo! After that we vegged on a flat bread that had scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and bacon on it - which btw is one of the dopest flatbreads I have ever had in my life!   And YES, there's more... And for the finale we had their signature Fish Tacos, that are so good - they will make you want to smack yo' momma!  For real!  I've had brunch from New York to L.A. and everything in between, but this trumped them all.  And those of you that read my reviews know how much of a stickler I am when it comes to 'customer service'....  One Word:   Phenomenal!  From the moment we stepped off the elevator until the moment we paid the bill, it was seriously a 5 star experience.  You would have sworn I was LL Cool J or something by the way they treated us.  The GM was mad-kool  and checked on us several times throughout our brunch to make sure everything was to our liking.  Little touches like that turn an average Sunday afternoon into and  extraordinary and memorable experience.   If you have the opportunity, definitely check this place out.  It's got the 'Kam Stamp of Approval'!  Cheers.",0.9857,0.837,0.13,0.033,0.4924229063117952

We went here for a Bulls game watch, even though I was highly opposed considering I felt like this was not the ideal place to watch a game. Either way, we ventured to the loop and started our watch here.  Pros:  Awesome view, interesting seating arrangements, comfy lounge couches and a bar in the middle with an encapsulated fire in the center, business professional atmosphere before 7pm, great summertime CHI feel outdoors  Cons:  This place is way overpriced. The food is OK, not anything spectacular. It turned into D-bag central at around 7pm (i.e. popped collars and guys wearing shades when the sun was downl). Not a good place to watch a game.  Major Con:  The bartenders aren't consistent and the waitstaff needs training on customer service. Example: My girlfriends ordered 2 of the same drink, some sort of strawberry concoction. 1 girl friend had way too much amaretto in her drink and requested it be taken back to the bar and remade. The waitress looked at us like we were insane and hesitated a little when my girl made her request. What's the issue? It is clear that something is wrong with one of these drinks! While one is red strawberry goodness, the other is a brown murky mess and is absolutely disgusting. For $14 a pop for a 6 ounce glass of liquid you need to get your ass back there and do it right the first time. It then took 30 minutes to get a new drink and the waitress made some lame excuse about having to find a manager to get approval to remake the drink. Give me a break! If this is true then you have poor management. End of discussion, you both suck.  Overall ambiance wise this place is great - but there are just better venues in the city with more to offer.",0.9084,0.828,0.108,0.064,0.47144014899828857

BUT when I went back last night to grab drinks before a show at the Chicago Theater, I was thoroughly unimpressed. We sat along side one of the fire pits for close to 15 minutes before my boyfriend decided to get our drinks from the bar. Every glass of white wine under $25 was out of stock which, for the start of summer on a roof top patio, is a huge mistake. After our first drink, we tried to get a server but were told that ""we were not in her section"" so we flagged down another one who seemed less than eager to earn a tip.

Our server was as chilly as the late April evening, clearly did not care about forgetting drinks or giving us ones we didn't order.  Finally when we do decide to leave because we just can't pretend its worth it anymore, it takes the better part of an hour to get the check.

And now to extrapolate... So, let's get it out of the way: the view is amazing. The set-up of the bar is gorgeous and very sophisticated.  This is mitigated by the fact that the cocktails are extremely overpriced - I actually don't mind ponying up $10+ for a quality cocktail (see Violet Hour), but these drinks flat out sucked. Watered down and not good at all. Strike one. Strike two: terrible, terrible service. If I am standing at a bar I might expect to wait, but we were seated at a table for about 3 hours with a large party and had to beg them to take our orders even the first time - seems like they're pretty silly to miss such an opportunity. Strike three: when we tried to pay our bills, they lost two credit cards and then couldn't figure out how to split up our check - AND they were really rude about it as if we were bothering them.

There's so much potential here, but the vibe is totally wasted.  When we walked in, ""Who Let the Dogs Out"" was playing.  The rest of the music was not very loungy, and more along the line of ""They're playing THAT song?""  The music does not fit with what the space is trying to be. The drink menu looked fun, and I totally expected to pay $14 for a martini, so that was fine. However, it was a sloppily made one, and it came served in a plastic martini cup.  If I was lounging at a pool, yes, then I can see why.  But for that price, at least serve a well-made drink in an actual glass. The food looked interesting, but again, it didn't seem to fit with the vibe. It's like Roof took a stab at being an elegant lounge but decided halfway through to just give up.

Ding ding; we have a winner! The concierge at the Marriott off of the Mile recommended this little gem atop the Wit hotel. I totally dig the floor to ceiling windows and the open patio along with the many community tables. Shall we mingle? Let's. Well, hello Chicago. It's nice to be of your acquaintance. You're quite beautiful from this view. My friend and I came during the middle of the day on a weekend so I can't say too much about what it's like during the night time. It was kind of crowded when we went so I can only assume that it would be ridiculously packed at night although maybe worth it to reserve a table for bottle service to drink amid the night lights of the city. Prices are on the high side but that's what you get for trying to drink close to the Gods and enjoy the view that they get. Compared to other bars with views the tag isn't so bad. Oh and I almost forgot the semi-blaring techno and hip hop... awesome in the middle of the day. What could have been better? Lower prices on the drinks and a more attentive wait staff.

The drinks? I'm not much of a drinker, I'm a sipper and I usually have 1 or maybe 2 drinks at any establishment. Yes they are pricey, so if you're planning to get trashed, I would not recommend. They're about $10-14 a pop, like the cocktail prices in a club in Las Vegas or Miami. Actually Violet Hour in Wicker Park has a menu around those prices too. The couple of times I was at the Roof, I ordered the 'Cougar Town'... I can't help it, its soooo pretty. It tastes pretty too, if you can imagine what pretty tastes like, and it comes with an edible orchid- not hibiscus as Jen K reviews below - but I grew up with orchids in the backyard, and I could never *eat* an orchid flower.

My group and I pretty much tried almost every single mixed drink there and it came to the point where I was getting way too much sugar and started ordering Grey Goose dirty martini's with blue cheese olives. This was the first time that I have ever had a martini with the blue cheese olives and fell in love with them. Whenever I get a dirty martini, I always now see if they have the blue cheese olives.

The drinks were good--though expensive (but let's be honest, I am not usually downtown, so this may be par for the course for drink prices, so if so, ignore my thoughts)  I got a glass of white wine that was delicious and a pretty good portion of wine.  The wine glass was huge! Though the glass was a little warm, which is annoying when you want a cool glass of wine. The views of the city are amazing and it makes you proud to be a Chicagoan when looking down and seeing your city.  I felt the crowd was after-workers which was nice, since I felt like it could probably get really touristy, really fast.  A neat place to spend a summer evening to get a drink and enjoy the city view with friends.  Also the lobby of the Wit smells amazing.  What is that? Lavender?

A small group of us had selected it as a venue for a 20 year high school reunion. I started reaching out to them over a month ago to try and understand our options for an event of that size.  They didn't call me back.  They didn't respond to email.  When I asked other people to try and call, their calls weren't returned either.  I even tried to go through Open Table, but to no avail. The only way I finally managed to get their attention was by Tweeting how thoroughly miserable my experience had been. Within half an hour I received a curt message along with their price list - a reservation for 1-10 people carried a $1500 minimum (well beyond our budget). Without that we just had to take our chances because, hey, it was all first come first serve now.  The bar opens at 4 and we were assured by the hostess who finally called us back that if we showed up by 4:30 we'd have no trouble being seated.  4 out of 5 of us were there on time and waded through fanny-pack sporting tourists who looked like they were on their way back from drinking Old Style's at Wrigley. After we managed to score a table, service was - at best - laborious with waits of 20 minutes for our drinks.  Oh, then there's the part where they closed half the bar for a wedding reception (something they could have told us on the phone when we finally talked to someone the day before). And the part where they suspended elevator service for the wedding party, stranding our last guest in the 100-degree heat for about an hour.  Never mind that there were four elevators working, that this was just ONE patron and that the staff had been well-advised we were expecting this person. I wasn't even allowed to go down and get them. I finally demanded my check (they didn't include a copy for me to sign so I just walked out). Absolutely no tip. I'm embarrassed that I selected it as a venue. The views are mediocre at best, the service is abysmal and I can't believe that people think this place is anything close to hot. Spend your money elsewhere - trust me when I say that the Wit won't care about you or your party even when you're laying down your cold hard cash. **Edited to add the part about the valet.

2010-07-14,2.0,"I can't believe that people will stand in lines for this place. And I mean really long lines. The Roof is, simply put, quite overrated. I was fortunate enough to not have to stand in line myself, as I came here around 5 pm on a weeknight. The hotel lobby, elevator and the space itself are nicely decorated. Very modern and tasteful. But nothing so amazing to warrant a ""must see"" rating. I wondered, then, do people come here for exceptional service? While a lot of the reviews mentioned long wait times for service and rude staff, I only experienced the slow service. Our waitress was polite and friendly enough.  I did find it incredibly rude, however, that other staff members run around dropping ""reserved"" signs on tables where people are already sitting. Why don't you just makes the seats really, really uncomfortable like a fast food joint so people will drink, eat and get out? Because that's the message here. If I'd have waited in line for 30-45 minutes only to sit down and have some clown toss down a sign telling me that my space is reserved for someone else in 30 minutes, I'd be royally chapped. So perhaps people flock to this place because it's got great food. Let me clear up that misconception right now. My friend and I had some very mediocre ceviche and ahi tuna on a tater tot...that's right...on a tater tot. Needless to say, most of the food went untouched. Half the bar is indoors and the other half, the outside area, is very jealously guarded. I don't know what it takes to get a seat out there but I'd like to learn. Maybe sitting outside is what makes this place worth the wait. But from the looks of it (no available seats on 5 pm on a weekday) I'll never know. It's also not a great value. I don't mind splurging when I'm at a special place, but this is not that place. We spent over $100 on some lame food and a bottle of wine.  Last, but not least, the people watching wasn't even good. Nothing more than your average over-baked, over accessorized crowd with big purses and sequined gladiator sandals. You can get that just about anywhere these days.

We got appetizers- fried mozz balls good, small portion.  Pizzas were nothing special.  Fries were fine but wasn't a fan of the sauce served with them.

We made the most of it and all had a good time while there, but I do have to comment further on the snotty-ness of the waitresses.  We didn't opt for a table as we were not staying long, but I observed the waitresses being rude to their tables and rude to anyone who did not auto part the sea of people as they walked by...as if they were celebrities on a red carpet that were commanding the attention of the paparazzi.  These ladies are very pretty, but I did not see one of them smile the entire time we were there.  I bet these ladies think they are making some great tips with their looks and hot outfits, BUT...I would be willing to bet they would see their tips triple if they learned to convey some type of charm and cracked a smile every now and then!!!

Their menu hasn't changed much which is good, it means they got it right the first time.  The atmosphere is a combination of what I am going to call urban REI chic.  For some reason the decor on the roof reminds me of an REI store, minus the canoe... but it would be fricken awesome if someone dragged a canoe up to the roof to honor this yelp review!   Anywhoot, the bathrooms at the roof are very stylish, and combine a dark slate with very modern glass and steel accessories.  I'm sure Patrick Bateman would say they are very good bathrooms to do coke in, and by that I mean that the bathrooms are always clean but you'll never see anyone cleaning them... it's like magic! What I remember most about the roof from my second visit is they have a decent wine by the glass list, which is surprisingly not that expensive but unique and tasty.  I'm pretty sure I had a pinot grigio, but I can't recall which one.  I distinctly remember there is a variety of sparkling wines and champagne on the roof's menu, which makes me want to celebrate something there. Perhaps my third visit to the roof for a friends birthday was proof that it's a great place to celebrate.  This third visit to the roof was a bit of an off night because it had just rained.  But the rain stopped and the roof had a nice buzz.... or maybe I was the one who was buzzed, haha.  I was plesantly surprised that I could get a simple Coors light in the bottle.  I'm definately greatful that my crew didn't get scared away by a few raindrops.  I must say that the roof is what I call a BYOP place because a lot of the crowd there on my third visit seemed like the after work type that stick to themselves and it was a friday night.  The one plus side to the crowd is many of them were probably guest's at the Wit hotel and it can be a blast mingling with the out of towners.  I definately would not consider the roof ""trendy"" anymore, but it's definately here to stay and has a great vibe.  One element to notice is the suddle background music.  It is very cutting edge with a mix of songs you'll know, and some you might want to know.   So head to the roof with your besties to cheers the most recent accomplishments in your lives... you can't help but feel high on life when your high above the streets of the loop and the stress of the daily grind!  Peace.",0.9984,0.793,0.185,0.021,0.5215725436179981

The entire clutch of them (wine bottle, wine glasses, plates and silverware) langoured, clogging up our limited space during the extended wait for the martinis to arrive.  Awkwardly, they weren't cleared when the martinis appeared or during the next fourty-five minutes or so of our stay.  As if gauging the most inappropriate time to remove them, as opposed to simply waiting until we were completely done and clearing our entire space, the staff rudely reached between us when we were just a few sips from finishing our martinis.

They don't take reservations unless you want to pay some ungodly amount for ""bottle service"" so I got there at around 730 with a friend to hold a table. The place was actually pretty empty at that point but it definitely started to fill up within the next thirty minutes. It's a great venue for groups because the tables are big and there is plenty of space to stand around yet not feel crowded. What I did not appreciate was...at about 9:45 some staff lady comes over and plops a big ass ""reserved"" sign down on our table for 10:15. So basically, we were going to have to move because our specific table was reserved. We asked if they could reserve a different table but after a long winded explanation, they could not, so we basically moved two tables down. LAME.  The staff here is incredibly snooty. Like they think they are the coolest thing to hit town since the invention of sliced bread. Come ON people, you work at a BAR. I wanted to hit them all upside the head w/ a 2 x 4 and bring them back to reality. You work at a bar. In Chicago. You are NOT better than anybody else here. So get over it.

There was no need for them to keep her out there for that long. It wasn't crowded inside, they are just trying to make it seem cool and hard to get into. I don't think I would pick this again for a birthday venue. It was a great location, beautiful view, but I can't support an institution with such rude staff. Albeit, both of our waiters were nice, a tad slow, but nice. And they were serving quite a few tables so I gave them a bit of slack.

You're paying for the view and the ambiance, so it will obviously be pricey. Oh also, the crowd here was very mixed.

We asked if we could get a late night bite, and were told ""yes- we serve til 1am"" but nothing is done to get us a table or help facilitate the process.  So we stumble around only to determine that the place is way over packed with over made girls and equally idiotic boys- where are the adults that are here during the week, I wonder?

Feeling rather big for our britches, we waltzed right past ""State and Lake"" (the nearest bar to the Wit lobby - slight breech of etiquette in terms of Hotel Bar Project) and followed the throngs of well-heeled youngsters headed up to the the 26th floor.  Dimly lit? Pah! This bar was clearly designed by WWII air raid wardens. After groping around in the dark, we found that there was no room at the bar. One of the stipulations of The Project is that we must sit at the bar so we resorted to standing rather awkwardly around a single stool with all our stuff placed on it.  I'm no stranger to awkward moments. Hell, I do awkward like Debbie does Dallas. For example - all of the following (with the exception of one that I just cooked up for giggles) are REAL awkward moments.  Watching Showgirls (not the TBS version) nestled in between your parents on the couch.  Having sex and realizing your pet is watching you a little too intently Ripping ass in what you thought was an empty office only to hear your boss clear his throat. Saying ""Hi gentlemen, how are you? Table for two?"" only to realize that one ""gentleman"" happens to be a lady with a crew cut. Yikes. Why so awkward? Well if you're not wearing either opaque tights for trousers, jewels, G-Star or one of those ghastly one-shouldered sweater dresses (""AHOY! BROAD BESSIE off the port bow!"") you'll feel like a right bumpkin.  I'd like to be chic enough for this place but alas, I'll never be a member of the Cashmere Mafia.

Though we didn't receive any complimentary bar snacks (the FIRST hotel bar this happened I might add) the bartender can't be faulted.

I forgot water for the wife and walked down to where the other was gossiping (instead of 'tending the bar'), after trying to get his attention and asked for a bottle of water. He walked away after nodding to me still talking to the waitresses and telling some guy that he was one of them now, must be a new hire or something. I walked 5 feet away back to my wife(which was the only person sitting at the bar) and I realized after 5+ minutes I had no water. I looked behind me and 5 feet away the bartender was still talking and the bottle was sitting on the bar in front of him. I got up and walked down to get it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not lazy but I'm pretty sure that's his fucking job to bring the drinks to me.  Applebee's has better and more friendly bartenders. Maybe you should send them there to train.

A long concrete high top table divides the space. Tables topped with white umbrellas surround it on either side. The umbrellas themselves are European mod, not what you would find in your backyard garden or at Home Depot. Cozy chairs with white cushions hug the tables. The clientele on this rooftop are as classy as the decor. Think Riviera in Chicago with swank clothing and prada sunglasses to bake away an afternoon on this rooftop oasis.

We tried to order an artichoke app but the waitress scoffed and said ""Those are out of season right now, and we would never serve something out of season."" You just opened within the last month - then don't put it on the cardboard piece of paper menu until it's available! The waitress then suggested fried mozzarella as a close alternative to artichoke...hmmm.

2009-08-18,2.0,"Summary: Went to the Wit at 230p on a Friday looking for lunch and a view. The service was very poor as I had a drinking sprayed on my arm by a bartender with no apology. The food was sub-par as the tuna was canned. The view was nice and a redeeming quality.  The Service: As noted, it was poor. We sat at the bar and it took awhile to even get the bartender over to us (it was not very crowded). I had ordered a BeefEater martini. She was making a Gin and Tonic. Eventually, I got the right drink and it was fine. Another bartender mixing a drink in front of us, slammed a glass down and sprayed the drink on my arm. He said ""almost gotcha"". I said ""yea you did actually"". No apology. Then he used my cloth to wipe up the mess and didn't give me new silverware until we asked for it about 10 minutes later. Please note, it was NOT heavily crowded as this was 230p on Friday afternoon. We walked right in and sat down without a line. Pretty poor service for not a fullhouse.  The Food: We tried ordering the toasted artichokes, but they said they were ""gone forever"" meaning they were off the menu. Maybe they were in the process of removing them from the menu itself? Either way, disappointing. So we ordered the Tuna Crostini, Funghi Pizza, and Salmon Crudo. The tuna used was canned (!) and the egg was presented horribly as half of the egg was topped on 1 of the 4 pieces of toasted bread. The pizza was fine but too watery as it leaked all over the plate. The salmon was sub-par at best as it had no real redeeming qualities and was about $8 worthy when we paid $15 for it. Pitiful.  The View: Nice rooftop. Definitely in the midst of the city. I would go solely for the view if I were to go again.  Conclusion: Don't eat here. Overpriced, canned meat, deplorable service.  Come for a drink/the view if you want to ""try it out"".

Luckily, I was here for a friend who was staying at the hotel and celebrating their birthday here so we got upstairs pretty quick. But while we were lounging downstairs waiting for our friend, we found it amusing the number of guys and chicks who were all dressed up and thought they were the shit, get denied access to the place through the hotel itself. If you want to be amused, then the Hotel Lobby is the place to hang out at. That said..... Pros:  1) Beer is not that expensive, about what I would expect to pay at any place downtown. Buds cost $5, mixed drinks were around $8-$10. So really, not all that terrible.  2) Place has a pretty nice view. But for me, it doesn't get all that exciting as people crack it up to be.  3) People confused me for the manager. Heck, if I come on a regular basis, maybe I can give myself the hook up! Cons:  1) WAY TOO CROWDED!!! My god, it was impossible to get to the bathroom or to get to the bar.  2) Also, this is a LOUNGE. Please....please...PLEASE turn the music down!!! Its not like I can get my dancing groove on due to #1 3) Creepy 50 yr olds hitting on my wife in front of me. Seriously? You got security running all over the place and they're not even doing anything. Of course if I become the avenger of all that's right and holy and try to retribute my vengeance upon the Viagra Crew, guess who get's kicked out.  So in my finale, as I walked out and talked to one of the employees, he informed me that the weedays were probably the best time to come because it wasn't as crowded and it was more of an after-work lounge at that point.

2009-08-07,3.0,"Situated in Chicago's downtown loop area, Roof is located on the 27th floor of The Wit hotel and has quickly become one of Chicago's must-see rooftops. Stellar views of the city, a luxurious modern decor, and great atmosphere are a few things you'll be sure to enjoy at Roof. However, you must first brave the extreme line - - wait times often reaching 2-3 hrs - - before you can get a ticket and granted entrance to this illustrious spot. If you decide to go I urge you get there before 8pm. I must really stress this because arriving after 8p will guarantee you a spot in the line... oftentimes lasting 2-3 hrs, and that's not an exaggeration. Making matters worse is the random eye sore building between The Wit hotel and Harold Washington College. Behind the rusting iron fence you'll spot multiple rats, yes RATS running amuck. I'm still baffled as to why the high end hotel has not yet done something about this. Hell, put up a mural against the fence... anything to not be forced to watch city rats go ballistic. I've been to Roof at The Wit about 3 times and EACH time seen NUMEROUS rats, once even managing to snap a pic. If you're able to stomach the rats, harassment from local bums (the security does a pretty good job of keeping them away) and mind-numbing wait in line, there's a lot in store for you at the 27th floor. Upon receiving a ticket you're directed through the hotel lobby to the elevators. The express elevator takes you to Roof and finally you're on your way to enjoying a wonderful night full of drinks, great atmosphere and even better views. **Update** At first I was thrilled to find this diamond jewel of a place but now I'm sad to report that someone in the hood must have gotten the memo because the crowd after 11p is NOT what's up.

OK, so I expected to walk in, get treated like shit, get raped on a drink or 2, and not fit in.  Quite the opposite!  It was open seating, the servers were very polite, and the view was spectacular.  I even talked to the DJ (Sadie w/ White Label) for a minute.  It was her first day.  She was playing some lounge music, and everybody there was eating it up along with their sunday glass of wine or mimosa.  The food selection sounded good, and looked the same from what I could see around me, but I wasn't hungry (aka didn't feel like dropping $30 on a beer and some food).  Not excessively overpriced though. The seating was very interesting, except for the metal tables out in the sun.  They get almost as hot as the female servers..  It took me about a 20 seconds to pick a seat, and I was happy.  I had a beer ($5 Miller Lite, I'm not complaining), and then it was on to the next spot (please see my next review to follow my August 2nd Sunday extravaganza). See you later Roof.  It will probably be when someone owes me a drink on a Sunday for something random.",0.904,0.897,0.072,0.031,0.4368589743589743
2009-08-03,5.0,"I hesitate to write this review because I fear that it will make the already long lines to get on the Roof at the Wit even longer!  The shortest time I've waited is 30 mins. and that was when we arrived at around 8:30pm.  The longest wait I've experienced there has been 2 hours (arriving at 9pm!!!).  It's crazy.  The crowd is a great mix of tourists and locals and people from all different professions.   I love love LOVE the view, the furniture, the little bonfires at the outdoor tables, the heating lamps over the booths outside, and especially the view from the smaller VIP area in the southwest corner of the lounge.  There is an indoor area and an outdoor area at the Roof.  It kind of gets crowded leaving you with not much room to move or sit down.  But regardless I always have a great time here and no one is overly creepy.  All the patrons are there usually for a good time and it usually ends up being that way.  I like that it feels like you're not even in Chicago, but instead at some trendy South Beach or Las Vegas club or something. The times I've been there have been Saturday nights and I haven't had the food, but from what I saw, it really looked and smelled good.  I was VERY tempted to steal a pizza or a fry as the waiters walked by with them.  Drinks were great though -- service was quick and friendly.  The outdoor bartenders make a really good Peach Bellini (whenever they don't run out Peach, otherwise the Mango one is pretty good as well).   I like that once you do get a seat, it can feel very nice just to relax there and take in the fresh night air.  It can get a little chilly at night though and you do feel the wind a bit more up there.   I like the Roof at the Wit, but I don't recommend that people go there.  Why?  Because, as I said earlier, I don't want the lines to get even longer or the lounge to get even more crowded.  The location seems ideal for happy hour or those staying downtown while visiting Chicago, but waiting outside can creep a person out especially if you're stuck standing in front of the vacant lot next to the Wit hotel where one can see many HUGE rats scurrying around.  Ew!  Once you're in, though, it's great!

The space is gorgeous.  As close to sexy LA as you can get in Chicago.  Roof truly delivers in their design of the canopy, the booths, white couches, plants, drinks, etc. Speaking of drinks, these things are STRONG.  I was drunk as could be after 2 blueberry drinks.  These blueberry drinks are like heaven in a cup, so I highly recommend them.  It's on the specialty drink menu.

However, I've been up there a handful of times over the past couple of months, both on the outdoor patio and at the interior bar. I must say, the people watching at Roof is like nothing I've ever experienced. Tourists, professionals, douchebags, ghettos, elderly couples, hipsters...and other categories of people that I have yet to stereotype because they seem to exist nowhere else. My friends and I have often found ourselves laughing hysterically at the display. Other than that, the service and drinks at Roof are horrendous. The first time we went, our waitress was completely strung out and, consequently, completely retarded. She messed up at least one drink in every round. By the end of the evening we'd returned at least six specialty drinks, all of which were not what we ordered or just tasted plain horrible. In subsequent visits we have stuck to wine or basic mixed drinks. The food, however, almost makes it worth dealing with the annoying people, crappy drinks and horrible service. The french fries are amazing, and the flatbreads and lamb burgers are great as well. Stay away from the parmesan chicken sliders--the chicken was not only gray in color but also fell into the category of what I call 'funky chicken'--very low quality. The view is what it is.

Around the block line surely stirred out curiosity. So it was on fine Friday night, dress, make up, couple of blings and we headed to the Roof. Luckily the line was not an issue for us as we smoothly slided through the velvet rope feeling the envious stare of the crows behind. The elevator took us all the way up and to tell the truth I was prepared for worst. I tuned my critical senses and adjusted my micro dress. Doors opened...  WHAT A FANTASTIC VIEW!  We moaned. As I stood little perplexed by the panoramic atmosphere I overheard my friend's suggestion to navigate the bar and get a drink. So we got our drinks and went to check out the outdoor area. The area was elegant yet without any pretentious aura. We got even luckier when we were offered nice table from a couple who were leaving. So seated three of us started checking out the crowd and the menu. For a place like this I expected overpriced drinks and snobby servers. Instead we got very attentive and friendly server and very reasonably priced drinks. It was quite refreshing to see such an interesting mix of crowd; yups, old sugar daddies, club hoppers, foreigners, tourists, hip hop brothers, celebrity, sports athlete, bachelorette crowd from burbs, me and etc. I certainly give credit to this place for keeping the crowd diverse and random so unlike other snobster lounges.

Valeted my car quick and easy...only $10 - i said i was going to the Roof.  Getting in:  the line was not as long as talked about, however, lines are not for me - yes i am that person.  Luckily, my friend was having her engagement party there that evening and had pre-arranged express entry for the guests. No problem getting in there. It should be noted that if you are a well dressed attractive classy female you need no list - orange club whores do not count...watching them get turned down was hilarious.  So points to you Wit hotel for knowing what is up.  Crowd:  Ppl may be talking smack on how they are pretentious.  I think not.  They do not seem to be doing any type of crowd control as I saw everyone from sugar daddies hanging out by the bar, hip twenty somethings, dbags and club whores, to fugly tourists.  I was expecting more from the crowd looks wise however the majority of the ppl were well dressed.  Service:  luckily we snagged a spot by one of the center island things.  Our waitress was super nice and attentive. I did not go to the bar during this visit so i cannot speak to that. I noticed other reviews had issues with service...i'm not sure if we got lucky or they were just ugly. Taste test:  Specialty cocktails WIN. I had the cucumber mojito perfect for a warm summer night. Also we ordered some sort of flatbread pizza...delicious.  I got a bottle of prosecco $36, not bad and the waitress was on the ball with new glasses for every bottle. loved her.  The rest:  The Dj was ok, but dont expect much from the music...lets just say i heard milli vanilli.  strange. Here are the reasons the Roof did not earn 5 stars.  They have these large patio umbrella-esque things which take up the ENTIRE walkway so you must walk on top of the base...which is fine when you first get there sober...2 hours later it could be a disaster. There is a cool private room off to the side that is outdoors.  Make friends with someone rich and get that...looked fun. Overall, i would def go back however, I would not wait in line. Make friends, look hot, its more better.  I need to go during daylight to fully evaluate the Roof.  It's def worth checking out but do not go here expecting a bargain...expect to spend $10 for a good drink $14 for a specialty cocktail and do not bitch about it being expensive, instead take your cheap self to the pub.

2009-07-22,3.0,"The rooftop of the Wit Hotel? For the grown and sexy, indeed. I took off two stars for that crazy line wrapped around the block to get in and for the sophisticated borderlining pretense that smacks you in the face upon entry.  At first I thought it was a spot soley for the Trixies and the Chads, and I wouldn't dare show up unless my swag was a hundred percent. However, it was a nice, ecclectic crowd of both twenty-somethings and up. Dudes were all shiney and suited up, and the ladies were channeling whichever Sex In the City character. I must say, it was definitely a ""stiletto worthy"" kinda place. The place was packed with an eye full of male and female pretties and yes, everyone was eyeballin' each other. They don't take reservations (so they said), yet some booths were reserved????? I didn't even groove in my seat to any music,  so I guess that means it could've been better; more housey-loungey like to go with the vibe of the place. Music always seals the deal for me. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the menu, and I was starving-which means I usually will just suck it up and take what I'm given. I was salivating over our neighboring table's lovely presented burgers...until I found out they were lamb. They looked tasty but the thought of it was like, ewwwww. Hence, an unwanted buzz from drinking on an empty stomach. Yeah, that's right people, I don't enjoy feeling incoherent from an alcohol beverage. My mojito  was stronger than what I prefer, but it was so crowded, I didn't want to bother with trying to track down our waitress and wait for the return of what might be right. She was a little snarky to our guys who, after waiting, went on their own to the bar to order our drinks, so you know how that goes.  Rarely can you go wrong with a place that's in the open air. Nice touch with the heaters on the wall and the rectangular fire pit, by the way. I also liked that the drapings of white, billowy canopies shield you a bit from the wind. Somebody was thinking.

2009-07-21,4.0,"Maybe I'm just ignorant, but I used to think that the whole ""cougar"" concept was an urban legend; something made up by frat boys to excuse themselves for being attracted to older women.  That is, until I went to Roof. The Saturday night started out innocently enough, a bunch of friends and I started our evening at Devon Seafood for Yelp's version of Chicago Chef's Week.  After dinner, we hopped in some cabs and headed to The Wit to check out their new rooftop lounge.  Roof had been featured on Metromix and in the Red Eye that week, so we knew it was going to get crowded.  We arrived just before 9:00pm and had no trouble getting in. When we reached Roof, it took me a few seconds to realize I was actually outside (hint: look up).  The décor is very swank and modern, with big booths and segregated seating areas.  We were frustrated at first as our party of 10 was relegated to sit along a rail, while couples and groups of three dined in each of the gigantic booths along the back wall.  Somehow one of my friends conned a dining couple into surrendering their booth to our party when they finished their meal.  By the time we'd settled into our booth, the place was starting to fill up and the real show began. If you can't think of anything nice to say about Roof, I'm sure you could say this: Roof offers people watching GALORE.  The place attracts people 21+ from many colorful walks of life.  My crowd identifies mostly with the non-trixie/chad population of Lakeview; we're in our 20s (now, upper 20s) are gainfully employed, and value personal hygiene, but as far as I know, none of my friends drives a Range Rover, or owns a dog named Tinkerbelle.  In addition to a few groups like us, Roof offered hipsters, suburbanites, and tourists looking for an after-show drink, and don't forget the cougars! My Roof experience introduced me to a whole new world of cross-generational predation.  The Cougar is practically a cultural phenomenon, but have you ever heard of a Jaguar?  How about a Puma?  Roof offered a whole plate of Trixies, Chads, Cougars, Jaguars, and Pumas.  As the night went on, walking to the bathroom was a matter of taking your life into your hands. An important (though obvious) thing to note if you are planning to visit Roof is that it is not cheap.  My friends and I were downing drinks called ""Randy Raspberry"", and some sort of tangerine cognac cocktail, to the tune of $12-$15 each.  Service was attentive but switched out halfway through our visit which made things confusing when the bill arrived.  Music was forgettable, but not unpleasant, and the temperature was well regulated for an outdoor venue.  Our friends who arrived after 11:00pm had to wait in line, but we were able to take over a second booth and fit everyone in.  At the end of the night, the whole place was standing room only.  The best part was that the rooftop was still going strong outside when we decided to move on to other pastures around 1:00am. In summary, Roof is a great place for summer people watching if you're looking to be entertained and blow some cash.",0.9973,0.827,0.148,0.025,0.39485673057101633

Let's be a little fair though.  To all the Neanderthal douches that come here, and Trixie idiots that probably don't Yelp and can't defend themselves; it's not your fault.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but there are very few posh lounges anywhere that get very good ratings.  These kinds of places will forever be overpriced and overrated.  And, of course, they will be inhabited by gaggles of  ""Yeah Dudes"" and packs of  ""Woo Girls.""  This is technically their domain when you think about it. And for the tourists, lets not be snooty New Yorkers.  With our deficit, we could use some external cash.  And with our sales tax, I'm surprise we have tourists at all. The kinda people that Yelp, I think have a few things inherently in common.  We want something nice, good service, and a fair value.  But to look for that at a rooftop lounge is akin to looking for a pennant from the Cubs.  Not in a hundred years my friend.  Just ain't gonna happen.  So I think Yelpers fool themselves thinking:  ""Hey, this might be the day I go to a lounge where the drinks won't be overpriced and the people won't be a buncha Euro-trash wannabe losers""   Granted, I'm not above this; I did end up coming here too.  I also had the hopes that this would be some gem hidden away like a sorority girl's gut hiding away behind a garish belt.  But no, it sticks out; like the  chest hairs between the vertical stripes of a button up shirt. For the record:  the service was pretty good for me on the Wednesday night that I went.  The marinated olives...ick; marinated in what?  WATER?!   The drinks:  overpriced, at least they had a few beers worth drinking (but cost an arm and a leg)  and their mixed drinks were nothing special.   The venue itself is pretty nice.  Half of the bar is open air.  With an LA/LV kinda vibe to it.  The view is too close to the Loop.  Reminded me of work, no es bueno.

First off, the view was amazing, but my rooftop deck view will beat that any day (plus i don't have to pay $12 for a drink that wasn't awesome). We were lucky enough to find 2 spots on the outside area, by the fire pits. The fire pits are an awesome concept, and i definitely give them props for that. However, whoever did the construction apparently didn't realize that these concrete ""counters"" weren't going to be covered up. You could see writing like ""#14"", ""#10"", etc  in multiple places on the concrete by the fire. While its a small mishap, it definitely showed their lack of considering small details. Another example: The top of the outside bar is white steel, and even thought it looks cool, my boyfriend and i could already see some rusting! Didn't this place just open at the end of May?! Other than that, the decor was awesome. I loved sitting by the fire, esp since last night was kind of chilly. It was very sleek and trendy.  The wait staff apparently thinks they're the hottest thing on the planet, because it took a good 10 minutes for a waitress to even come to us. We even went to the bar hoping to get a drink that way, but the bartenders didn't really pay attention.  This place is full of cougars who have dollar signs in their eyes. It was mostly older women, with younger men. I couldn't help but laughing at all the women who looked like they've had more plastic surgery than necessary talking to men 20 years their junior. The crowd was confusing, you have an interesting mix of people who think they're awesome, and the tourists who are just staying there.  The drinks were nothing special. My boyfriend ordered a Gin martini and asked for olives, when the waitress brings our drinks there was a lime and no olives. The martini was less than average and come the next round he just ordered straight gin. I ordered a Raspberry drink they had on special, the first one either needed more raspberry flavoring or less. It was a refreshing, light, summer drink, but it still needs to perfected. It was garnished with 2 lemon twists and two raspberries. I added the lime from my boyfriend's martini, and that helped the taste (and the look!). The 2nd one i ordered was better, but it was minus the lemon twists. Consistency people!  We ordered the fries, which came with both Pesto and Ketchup, which was a major plus. The fries were very good, and i would definitely order them again. We left around 8 and the place was filling up quickly, with a lot of people standing. The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because i love the concept and the outdoor roof deck.

The Roof didn't disappoint following the rooftop bar accented by wood and white concept. The view, however, wasn't as awe inspiring as I expected because you honestly don't get much a view smack in the middle of the Loop...unless your idea of ""view"" consists of windows to various high rises. The crowd is a bit older wavering between the 30 to 50 something crowd but it could have been because I visited on a Sunday afternoon. In fact, the best time to go may be a Sunday afternoon or for happy hour on the weekdays, otherwise expect to wait in line for at least an hour.

2009-07-12,1.0,"Fail. This new entry on Chicago's rooftop bar scene left me completely cold. The Thursday I went, I thought I would be sufficiently buzzed from a drink at State & Lake to overlook the egregiousness of a line (in Chicago? Methinks not) to get to the vaunted 27th floor. Being a weeknight, the line moved at a fairly good clip, but my evening was already soured by the bouncer yelling at two shorts-clad tourists standing in front of me.  Conditions did not improve once upstairs. There were orange spray-tans, Forever 21 knockoffs of last season's Diane  von Furstenburg, and preening, chain-wearing men in abundance. Once I finally secured a place to stand at the bar, there was no waitperson anywhere to be found in the whole writhing mess. Once I finally spotted a server, I ordered a glass of rose.  I cannot speak to the quality of other wines/cocktails, as I felt hemmed in the entire time, a feeling that was hardly conducive to ordering with abandon.  This was clearly the opposite of a chill atmosphere, as I got the overall sense that everyone upstairs that evening was trying way too hard. The space is nothing special-- think knockoff of any W hotel anywhere in the US. For all of the women who are thinking of patronizing this place, I will warn you right now that this bar features the most unchivalrous collection of men that I have had the misfortune to witness since my days in grade school. The first incident occurred when a space had cleared to my left, three dudes materialize, and proceed to ask me if there is anyone occupying that spot, as they were thinking of ordering appetizers and wanted a spot to put them (I could suggest one). Their behavior would lead the rational observer  to think that I was covered in scales, not the charcoal skirt and turquoise shirt from hugo boss black label (of this season, no less) that I was in fact sporting. After that setback, the three dudes move over to the other side of where I am sitting, a chair opens up and what does alpha dude (who looks like Ben Stiller) do but plops down and reserves the chair for his hat-wearing partner in crime (who, I must say, was glad handing around the bar like he owned the place). The second highlight (lowlight) of my evening took place when I moved over to a spot at the less heavily-trafficked end of the bar. Here, I had the pleasure of running into a dude (suit-wearing, this time) who proceeded to criticize my drink, made fun of me for using a word he did not understand, and called me into question for not being surrounded by a gaggle of other chicks (he actually had the audacity to ask me 'where are all your friends this evening')- NOT COOL. Last I checked, it's the aughts, and a single girl should feel more than comfortable checking out a new spot on her own. As if that is not enough, he then turns to two blonde women sitting near me-- I am now, for all of Wit's intents and purposes, invisible! Rarely do I spew such venom in a yelp review but Roof needs to work out some major kinks before it can step up as a destination worthy of my patronage. Fortunately for Roof, it has a neverending supply of benighted tourists, arrogant dudes, spay-tanned husband hunters, and middle-aged cougars upon which to draw as a customer base. For my part, the highlight of my evening was going home to watch a Frasier rerun and have a decent glass of wine!  Lesson learned: I will never stand in a line (much less in Chicago) to get into a purportedly exclusive place again.

Let's get on to the Mr. Hyde part of Roof.  The level of douche baggery that was maintained in this place over a period of 2 hours was baffling at best.  I understand the need to get noticed and develop a customer base... but Wow.  There were enough black tank-top undershirts and gold chains in this place that it could have doubled as a Mr. T convention.  The distant smell of palm aide and bronzer was almost enough to make anyone get up and leave.  The place was full of trust fund babies from Miami who slowly sipped their Canadian Club for most of the afternoon.

I rarely extend my social scene outside my ZIP code but some friends wanted to try something new and, for once, so was I.  Because one of said friends works for a company with summer hours and another is a teacher, they got to Roof early and got seats. I arrived at 5.30 and waited in line. Let me repeat, waited in line.

There's no denying the views are excellent, the set up great and the design/decor lovely (very sophisticated but feels casual). I don't have any complaints about the service though I would say the drink pours seemed light. But I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the crowd: d-baggery everywhere. Or suburbanites dressed to their nines (our fours but their nines).  I love that one reviewer said the food must be good because the french fries were tasty. For $9, they better be tasty. As the lowest price menu item, I am sure the fries are Roof's top seller. And that's my main gripe : if you have $9 fries, $12 mojitos (with light pours) you sure as sh*t better (all puns intended) have well-stocked bathrooms!

Upon walking into the place, my out of town friend says ""I've heard about places like this"". It reminds me of something you would get in NYC. You should know what you're getting into when you go to a place like this: Lots of people (so get there early if you want a table), expensive drinks, and maybe the best rooftop view in the city. We were nice to a couple of girls and snagged the circular table in the corner by the bar, by far the best table in the place, so either get there early or make some friends.

The idea of a rooftop bar downtown was so enticing, though, that we gave it another try.  This time we were able to get an outdoor seat -- although it was lucky we were able to, as the place was still bustling.  We were starving, so we ordered both the pizza with oyster mushrooms and the roasted red pepper and goat cheese crostini.  Both dishes were amazing.  The crostini was delicious and the pizza had a really complex flavor -- you could really taste that it was grilled, and it had an unexpected spiciness.  Another added bonus: the food was incredibly quick!  We had trouble attracting our waitress's attention for a while, but it was understandable because she had a lot of tables -- and once we did get her, she was really friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back -- not only for the food and the view, but because it's a great people watching location with a really interesting mix of patrons.  :)",0.984,0.837,0.146,0.017,0.5446969696969698

2009-06-09,4.0,"Relax... The Roof is not on fire, but it sure is smokin! After hearing many good things about Chicago's latest entry into the rooftop bar scene, I had to have a peek. Erica and I visited Roof this past Monday for post dinner drinks. We arrived around 10pm and the place was just beginning to build a crowd. We had no problem getting outdoor seating at a table or at the bar. However, if we would have arrived an hour or so later, it would have been a slightly different story. We were greeted immediately upon entering the venue. The host was extremely friendly and quick to handle our seating needs. We decided to grab a seat at the outdoor bar and experiment with a few of their signature cocktails. The drink menu is a short list comprised of house specialties and imported beers. The cocktail names and descriptions are creative, using unique drink combination's that I have not seen before. She had the Mexican Mule; I had the Randy Raspberry. The drinks were refreshing, but unfortunately not all that great. I think Roof is trying too hard to be different  on their drink menu. The bar staff was extremely friendly and quick to meet our needs. Prices seem fair, considering the location and view. Roof is gorgeous. Sleek. Modern. And ultra chic. All the makings of some high end trendy club, without the attitude. I can't stress enough what impressed me most about this place was the politeness of the staff. From the door guys at Hotel Wit, through the staff who said their good-byes upon our exit, everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. It's good to see a hip place can keep it's cool, without the arrogance. Let's hope they can keep it that way!",0.9948,0.761,0.194,0.045,0.6037673611111112

The valet is complimentary on Sunday and they will call for you from Roof to have your car pulled around. The Bad:  The mixed drinks were a conceptual failure.  The idea seemed to be to take a twist on classic cocktails but that twist was a wrong turn.  For example, the Pimm's Cup was not a Pimm's cup but rather some type of unidentifiable and unstrained juice served with a splash of Pimm's and garnished with a wilted-to-rotting sprig of mint.  The Old Fashioned was made with Jalisco, rather than whiskey and by all accounts a failure.  (Those in the group who fared best stuck to wine, cava or the margaritas.)    The music was erratic.  When we first arrived, something that sounded like an interlude from the Tavis Smiley show was on.  We asked them to change it and they put on something that sounded like Erykah Badu, followed by an instrumental version of Stevie Wonder's ""Living for the City.""  At some point they played Sam Prekop of Sea and Cake, definitely  the highlight.

Starting with the door staff and lobby staff at the new WIT wow they have it!  What a stellar attitude about this wonderful new property, themselves and the day; the vibe was just contagious! When you arrive on the 27th floor you will immediately think wow this is a phenomenal space and then you turn the corner and find yourself walking into perhaps the best rooftop bar in Chicago!  lots of seating from high top modern bar stools to sleek plush couches,arm chairs and finally the spot my buddy and I chose to occupy-Miami beach style pillowed semi-private conversation pits...  So comfy so posh!  I am already racking my brain for which friends would be perfect to just chill a lazy evening away in one of these amazing little comfort nooks... The service was great!  April was sweet and lacked any pretension!  I have come to fear self important staff at certain downtown glamour bars; Roof seems to have successfully avoided hiring any of these individuals....  Everyone was smiling and paying pretty close attention to drink levels and comfort levels! Now when we happened into Roof we were midway through an impromptu drinking tour of Chicago out of door drinking venus; this one took the gold ribbon of the day for sure!  My only complaint is that I did not give myself more time at Roof!   We only had a couple cocktails and did not even delve into the bites we kept seeing float by they all smelled and looked amazing!  I will check these small plates next time for sure! The Cocktails were beyond expectation!  Creative!  Top shelf with a twist!  Lush!  My favorite at this moment is the Tequila Old fashion made with an aged Partida tequila, agave nectar, an orange slice and love, it was divine it smelled as if I had escaped to a sweet orange grove!  Just wonderful!  The menu called for a different Tequila, April asked if I would mind the Partida instead, the supply of the other Tequila had been thoroughly depleted,  I really appreciate the heads up rather then just swapping it out, just added to the class of this entire happening! Price...  Recession minded!  Kudos to the manager who made the very smart decision to keep the drink and food prices down right affordable!   The signature cocktails are all around 12 or 13 bucks a piece, they are stiff they are fine and they are well worth it!  I have paid much more at similar venus around the country and just hope that these prices stick around, if they do they will be finding me on site quite a bit!

The views are spectacular, as is the decor. I was sad to see Miller Lite was not a drink option, so i settled for a glass of white wine, but the wine i selected was already sold out (it was only 7pm)!  Cant decide if it was understaffed last night or if the waitstaff just wasn't paying attention to us, because it took about 10-15 after i joined my friends' table for our waitress to ask if I needed a drink. Additionally, we ordered food and we had to ask for napkins and silverware since it wasn't provided to us with the food. I also asked for a glass of water and never got it... when our check came, our waitress apologized for not bringing me water because they ""ran out of glasses"".

2009-05-28,4.0,"WOW. In a word - chic.  I'm so glad I happened to read about the opening of Roof today! This lounge is located on the roof of The Wit Hotel. While it might not be the most original name ever, I am thoroughly impressed with this new spot!  First of all, it is GORGEOUS. Nice muted grey & white, big sheets of glass, very modern design. Kind of industrial/chic. There is TONS of outdoor seating - long communal bar tables with cool fire installations in the middle, big comfy booths, and also small seating areas with couches and chairs. The inside area is also quite spacious, with lots of big windows, and another fireplace inside. I was told by the GM that the lounge will always be first-come-first-serve, as in, NO RESERVATIONS. I asked about bottle service (even though that's not my style) and he said that they won't rule it out, but that is not the atmosphere they are going for. I like this place already!  Ok, so the place looks good - but what about the FOOD! There is a menu of 20 small plate selections. My friend and I tried the lamb sliders and the beef carpaccio. The lamb sliders were AWESOME! I was a bit leery, wondering if $13 for 3 sliders would be worth it. Not only were they a decent size, they were also so tasty! A nice-sized lamb patty, which was SO juicy! I know there is a yogurt sauce on there, but the red sauce was delicious! The beef carpaccio was also a nice portion, and was presented beautifully. The beef was some of the thinnest carpaccio I have EVER eaten! It comes drizzled with a light sauce, shallots, tomatoes and fresh Parmesan. Usually I like my carpaccio a little LESS dressed up, but it was still VERY good. Next on my list to try is the fresh ricotta, lots of people ordered it, and it looked delish.  The drinks! The wine list has a selection of European wines. I'm a South American wine lover, so I opted for a cocktail instead. They have a variety of specialty cocktails, created by their ""mixologist"". All the juices are fresh, all fresh herbs, homemade syrups, and they are in the process of making their own bitters. They didn't actually have a drink menu printed up yet, so it was a bit hard to remember all the descriptions that our waitress rattled off, but they all sound really interesting. My friend ordered the Mexican Mule, which was made of ginger beer, lime, agave syrup, and tequila, among other things! I ordered the Ipanema, which consists of their house-made sour mix, Brasilian cachaca, and some other exotic ingredients. The thing I love about these new fancy cocktails is that all of the ingredients are REAL and FRESH. I mean, my cocktail actually smelled good! When was the last time you ordered a rum & coke and said, ""Damn, that smells DELICIOUS!"". Both cocktails were great. Mine was a bit too sour for my taste, but these are well-made drinks, and I would highly recommend that you try one.  The crowd is the typical Loop crowd - cute dudes in suits, Pretty Young Things, mixed with the random hipster and even a tourist here and there (hey it IS in a hotel!) The service staff seemed to be surprisingly tattooed and pierced, but I suppose that reflects the hotel's young energy, modern style, and dare I say it...wry wit.  This is near my office, and I cannot WAIT to come back again and again during the summer! It's such a unique venue, being a rooftop lounge in the heart of The Loop. It's a perfect place to unwind after a long day. I would even bring out-of-towners here for a few drinks and a great view of our beautiful city!",0.9993,0.785,0.205,0.01,0.5027902519167579
