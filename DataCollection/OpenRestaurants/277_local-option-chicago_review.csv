The beer menu is pretty extensive, and I've found that the bartenders are more the willing to suggest beers that fit your taste! The Zombie Dust I had here was honestly the freshest I've ever had. In terms of food, I really like the shrimp tacos and am obsessed with the chips and guacamole.

There is heavy metal music playing in the background, so this is not a place to take a first date, or someone who you want to have a conversation with. The bartender seated us right away, and was very willing to provide recommendations for beer, which was much appreciated!  I ordered the grilled cheese with tots (but was told that they ran out of tots, so I got fries instead :( ) and he got the blue crab quesadilla. It did take about 30 minutes to come out, which was surprising since the majority of people there were just drinking. The grilled cheese had both avocado and bacon on it, which was amazing, but the cheese wasn't even melted completely. Fries were bomb though!! The quesadilla was amazing, and the blue cheese provided an interesting texture to the crab mixed in. I feel like there should have been another dipping sauce than just the soir cream and salsa provided.

I've actually always been treated fine there because I know about beer and I suppose blend into the vibe of the place. But I've seen and heard too many people treated like trash by staff to support a place like this. Like it or not, you are in the hospitality industry. Treat people with some dignity and respect you shmucks. You will put a obscure beer on the chalkboard and charge $8 for a 10 oz pour but then if someone asks you about the beer you chastise them for it. That's just bad for revenue. If you want to sell your expensive product, talk about it and educate people on it.  Clearly no one ever taught anyone who works there how to smile or say thank you. Unfortunately that type of culture is always a trickle down from ownership. I also love that they have this anti-pretentious vibe about them yet they are guilty of it in the reverse form. You don't want to deal with young well to do urban professionals, maybe you move out of your yuppy neighborhood.

I tried two draft items this visit: - Pipeworks Mango Guppy.  ABV not stated.  Clear gold, light head.  I noted a slight greenish cast, which, however, may have been an artifact of LO's odd lighting.  Strong aromatic hop nose, with a hint of green mango.  Taste likewise hops and tart green mango, nothing sweet or fruity about it. - Dieu du Ciel Peche Mortel.  9.5%.  Opaque black, medium head.  Nose suggesting dark chocolate.  Complex, dark, dare I say brooding taste of roast malt, bittersweet chocolate, dried fruit, and some hop bitterness, and a definite ethanol warmth.  A superior winter warmer, happily encountered on an atypically cool August afternoon.",0.9175,0.818,0.119,0.063,0.5027777777777779

Trust me, this place was different for me, but I'm quite open-minded, and it helped that I felt rather welcomed there. Came for a later dinner and drinks around 9:30pm. The place was half occupied and it was more spacious than anticipated. Right away, I noticed the crowd was quite diverse, which was nice. Definitely no young college kids which was great. There were a few TV screens behind the bar, which I enjoyed to catch up on some SportsCenter.  I got the jambalaya and boo got the steak tacos. These were quite tasty. Obviously, not super authentic but yummy in their own way. There were only two tacos, but these were quite massive, each being like a mini burrito. The steak was very flavorful and everything was cooked well and seasoned properly. Even the accompanied tots were above average. I was very satisfied with the meal. We tried quite a few beers, mostly of Local Option, as we have never tried them before. While most didn't suit my style, they were good beers. Very deep in flavor. I do recommend doing a bit of research on the beers beforehand, as they do offer a lot and the beer list on the giant chalkboard may be a bit hard to read. As a newbie to the place, I asked our waitress a bunch of questions, but I never felt dumb for asking, as she was very friendly and helpful. Even though she likely was judging me on the inside (as I was myself), I didn't sense any judgment for when I wanted a lighter beer. I enjoyed their pilsner (Outlawger). Overall service was quite prompt and efficient. This was a nice change of pace from standard burgers and wings and a generic local sports bar that frequent the DePaul area. Contrary to other Yelpers, I felt comfortable there and service was great. Décor is quite gnarly! Thought it was actually fun discovering all the 6's.

Local Option brews their own stuff and what they brew is potently high in percentage and deliciously good on the palate. They always have at least 5 of their owns tappings, as well as a ton of other local options...get it?! Local options! har har har. But ForRealTho, they have great options from Chicagoland breweries like Three Floyd's (yes we claim them), Revolution, Goose Island and many more. Right now, Exorcist is my favorite of their own beers they are serving up - a healthy 8.5% stout! They keep their beer list very updated on their website, so give that a look if you're interested.

The food is OK, some items better than others.   It's not terrible bar food, but you can do better if you are willing to walk a few blocks. MEH:  This bar gets crowded real fast, and can feel claustrophobic.   There's usually only one guy behind the bar, who sometimes also doubles as a food server.   Good luck getting his attention for another pour, or getting your check totaled.    The service is friendly, but insufficient. It can also get very loud in here on the weekends.   The owner wants you to know he's hardcore.   Yeah, we get it.

This place may be in Lincoln Park but boy, you would never guess it once you walk in the doors. It's dimly lit with a primarily wooden interior and plenty of rock and metal pumping through the speakers. They have a really impressive list of beers on tap. My friend and I were able to try a couple different 3 Floyds brews and then a couple specialty beers our bartender suggested. Speaking of our bartender, he was absolutely awesome! (I think his name was Dan or David, can't quite remember) He actually introduced himself when he came over to our table and shook our hands. It was great to get away from the typical Lakeview/Lincoln Park sound track and yet still be able to hear each other speak. My only beef with Local Option is they don't have the prices of their beers on the big wall menu and most of them are pretty expensive. The beers we were recommended were both $9. I know, not the end of the world, but if you're talking 9-10 dollar beers the price needs to be on the menu.

I had 2 beers, one was a cider on tap which was just okay.  We had two different guys waiting on us, and the one with the big beard was friendly and knows his stuff when it came to making beer recommendations.  I like ciders, I like fruity and lighter beers.  I can hang with some of the stouts and IPAs, but for the most part I stick to the girly stuff.  He recommended the Founders ""Backwoods Bastard,"" which was very good.  It was exactly what I was looking for:  a solid beer that wasn't too wimpy either.  I also tried my friend's blueberry stout - also very good. I think the other guy who waited on us was having a bad day, or just smelled ""suburban white girl"" at our table and didn't want to deal with it.  One of my friends asked him what his favorite menu item was, and he appeared a little bothered by that.  When we asked for separate checks (at the beginning of the meal), he again seemed put off by this and reluctantly did it anyway. We were able to sit and chat without straining.  Don't let the heavy metal cranking through the speakers chase you away.  Local Option is a relaxed establishment, filled mostly with a hipster clientele.  Unlike a lot of bars, every inch of the walls weren't covered by beer memorabilia.  The wall displaying the beer menu had a beautiful mural of turquoise and goldenrod, a hand painted, damask-like design.  That had to have taken days to complete.  The chalkboard beer menu was super easy to read too.  The food menu had a New Orleans theme going:  Po Boys, Jambalaya, Muffaletta, etc.  I ordered an appetizer for my entree, the Blue Crab Quesadilla, with a side of the beer battered fries.  The quesadilla was alright, I loved the sour cream dipping sauce that came with it.  It's definitely an appetizer portion though - Local Option isn't out to ""wow"" you with mega-sized portions, and that's okay.  The fries were good, but $5.75 for a side of fries is a little ridiculous for a bar - Lincoln Park or otherwise.  For the most part everyone was satisfied with their meal. The tables are TINY!  We barely had enough room for our plates.  It's also really cold in here.  They had two fans on overhead.  My friend asked the waiter to turn off the fan, but he said they needed it for air circulation.  I'm not a fan of suffocating, but I don't know what's up with that.

2014-09-30,3.0,"I'd been eying The Local Option for a while now, it's definitely not the typical spot you see on Webster. No pastel decor like Sweet Mandy B's or earthy looks like Range. Nope, The Local Option is a metal bar. In Lincoln Park. Came in with the boyfriend, Kara Z., and Rob S. on a Friday night for some dinner and were not disappointed. First, I had been wary of the fact that many reviews mentioned surly servers. However, I was pleasantly surprised when a bearded gentleman came over right away and continued to be incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our meal. He was able to recommend a few beers based on our tastes that were spot on. For an appetizer, we started with the guac and chips. The chips were more like cooked tortillas rather than crunchy chips, but they were delicious and paired with the guac very well. Our server didn't really have specific items to recommend, but I went with the shrimp po' boy and loved it. The sandwich was large and came with tons of big shrimp. There are several hot sauces on the tables at The Local Option, they're all extremely tasty and went with the sandwich. The only disappointment was the tator tots that I received on the side, skip these. My dining companions enjoyed other items like the tacos and blackened chicken sandwich. I managed to score a bite of the chicken sandwich and it was awesome.  Two watch-outs with The Local Option: 1) Around 9:30, the music cranks up to deafening levels. This was quite a surprise for us since we'd been able to hear each other just fine prior to this time. 2) If you're being price conscious, I would definitely ask the cost of the beer your waiter is recommending. I had checked out the menu before we arrived and felt like most beers were in the $6-9 range. However, two of the beers our waiter recommended were $11 each. My fault for not asking, but not a pleasant surprise when we got the bill. Overall, worth checking out!

A year later, I'm happy to report that my initial evaluation was a bit off but that this bar is pretty awesome. I came in one Friday afternoon for a pint or two and was immediately mesmerized by all the beer taps, to the point where I at first didn't realize the bartender was talking to me.  After some deliberation, I settled on the Vokuhila, which I kept seeing in the bottle at my local Trader Joe's and had been enticed by; there's a goat with a mullet on the label that's a play on the beer's German name, how could I not be interested? My partner-in-crime chose the Bourbon Barrel Aged Kentucky Common. Now I'm a pretty big fan of bock beers, but a good sour beer is a treat indeed. You need to try this.  The bartender was attentive and nice, giving us a rundown of how the Kentucky Common is made. Unfortunately I had a day of drinking ahead of me and didn't want to be weighed down by some delicious fried food just yet, but I definitely plan on returning here some time in the near future for a bite to eat.

2013-09-25,3.0,"Local Option offers an extensive selection of interesting, often delicious beers and a food menu of mostly Cajun-style food. The beer is easily the most expensive I've encountered in the city, so this is probably a place to avoid if you're on a budget, especially given that many of the beers can be found elsewhere at much better prices. Some specifics: Beer Quality - excellent. Rare selections from Europe and often selections I've never even heard of from good American microbreweries. Evil Twin or Mikkeller is often on tap here, which is usually not easy to come by elsewhere. Beer Prices - if you can find a beer on their menu elsewhere (usually over half of them), you'll usually pay one or two dollars less for it. Maybe their rent is too damn high? Which brings me to my next point: Location - unsuitably located in the heart of DePaul in Lincoln Park. The average DePaul undergrad won't be interested in going here to drink an $8 goblet of stout, while many beer nerds (like myself) won't be interested in traveling to this somewhat obscure location. A theory is that they keep the prices high to attract the proper clientele. I wonder why they don't just move. Beer Information - besides the beer names written on the wall, absolutely no information on premises. You can ask questions to the staff, but I gotta say, this is not generally a friendly bunch. Shelling out $9 for a goblet of beer should be accompanied by an informed decision. My suggestion is to research their selections using their online menu before going there.  Food - I've only eaten once here, so my opinion is limited. The crab cake sandwich was decent, but not all that interesting. The accompanying slaw and tartar sauce don't help that much. Fries are standard. Overall - I like what they're trying to do here, but there are too many shortcomings (price, location, attitude, limited beer information, uninteresting food) for me to really consider putting this in my regular rotation. The beer alone earns this place 2.5 stars, which I will generously round up to 3.",0.6501,0.846,0.08,0.074,0.4486963036963036

That's the air they give off.   I only say this because I called one time to see if they would have the Blackhawks game on during the playoffs.  My boyfriend had been in a few nights before and they had a band playing during the playoff game, so there was no sound for the game.  When I asked if they'd have the game on, they said yes.  When I asked if they'd have the sound on the game, the guy on the phone was a complete dick and extremely rude in his answer to me.   As a Blackhawks fans and a beer lover, I felt that was a valid question given what my boyfriend experienced two days earlier.

It's just one of those hidden gems :) The place isn't much to look at on the inside, but good beer doesn't always need a pre-made ambiance for you. Good beer can make any place seem like a palace, and such is Local Option. This place is definitely for the beer-savvy, they have hard-to-find beer on draft, let alone great bottle options. You don't find Goose Island BCS on draft hardly anywhere, so it's hard to resist that. I ended up with both of their home brews that day, one of them being Morningwood (their oak-aged coffee ale) and was completely blown away. I also tried the Dampf Loc beer, but it was the end of the keg so it tasted a little flat. I'm sure it would've been amazing had it not been the last of it. The food is why I knocked off a star. My husband got the catfish po' boy and I had the swordfish tacos. They were both just really plain. The catfish po' boy was huge because the bread was so thick and the filet was large in area, but it tasted fishy and the bread overpowered the sandwich. The toppingss were a bit weak too. So even though it was huge, it lacked any real flavor or product. The swordfish tacos had a sizeable amount of meat on them (two tacos total), but there were hardly any toppings. The menu said it had a special white sauce...I didn't see it on there. It really just tasted like grilled swordfish, cole slaw, and a tortilla. Luckily, I'm on a diet, so I didn't have to feel awful after eating it. But there was much left to be desired. However...the beer-battered fries were AMAZING. My husband got tater tots, and even though they were good, I kept having to swat his hand away from stealing my fries.

The food's good, too, but really, if your decision to come here hinges on people's food reviews, you've kind of missed the point of coming here-- this is a beer place.  Food's only served so you can enjoy more delicious beers!  That said, their guac & chips are amazing as is the creole coleslaw.   The staff is super knowledgeable so half the time, I don't even need to look at the beer menu to get exactly what I want.  Just tell them what types of beers you're in the mood for, and they're happy to offer suggestions.  I've never been steered wrong by any of their recommendations!  Yes, they might be a bit rougher around the edges compared to other place in Lincoln Park who may coddle their clientele, but they know their beers and will bring them to you, which is why they work there.   The place is metal, it's dark, they never have specials, and the prices aren't written on the beer menu (though they can be found online).  Deal with it, or don't go there, simple as that.  You go there to enjoy good beer, period-- not for the ambiance, and definitely not because you're cheap (READ: good beers tend NOT to be cheap).   They DO take credit cards, and they WILL split the bill for large parties as long as you let them know up front, that way they can keep everything straight as they're taking your orders.  If you wait until the end to tell them you wanted the bill split 10 ways based on who ordered what, or ask a million questions without ordering anything, then don't be shocked to get the ""rude"" behavior mentioned in other reviews.",0.997,0.807,0.185,0.008,0.5733082706766917

He was clearly *very* knowledgeable about beer, very friendly and very helpful.  Not only did we hear about the breweries and brewers that the beers came from, but we got informed and honest advice about what we would probably like the most.  It was a really busy night and the bartender found the time to sit down with us and make sure that we were enjoying everything and towards the end of the night as we were getting ready to pay he brought over a couple of samples, just because he thought we might like them. The beer choices on the menu are very bold. There are some very, very strong flavours on there.  To pick out a couple: De Molen Rook & Vuur tasted like a smoked, Indian tea; Boulevard Chocolate Ale was honestly like eating a chocolate bar that is made of liquid and gets you drunk. There are milder tasting things on the menu, but if you're feeling adventurous then it's definitely possible to stretch the realms of what you think beer can be.

A disclaimer: this place is not cheap.  One sign proudly declares ""No Specials Ever (so fucking metal),"" so if that turns you off, then read no further.  Why the high beer prices? Because the Option serves some of the best beer in North America, and that's not an exaggeration.  They're internationally recognized, and they flex that clout to bring in craft beers--on tap--that you absolutely will not find elsewhere.  If you can stomach the idea of investing in the experience, rest assured, after 2 or 3 of the beers here you won't even recall--or still less, care--how much you just spent.  Worry instead about how you're gonna make it home. If it's not already obvious, this is a bar for serious beer-drinkers.  It's not the kind of place you and your two dozen bros want to stop by after touch football.  As I've said, I've come here many times, I've brought many friends here, and generally the smaller the party, the more fun you'll have.  Many customers here are demanding people--as hardcore beer-ologists can be--but the staff are up for it.  My advice: be open-minded, be curious, ask questions and show interest--you're in.  A fast and sure way to get on everybody's bad side is to openly relish your ignorance of what everybody else in the bar has come to specifically enjoy. Recently, the guys here have begun brewing their own beer, and rumor has it that they're expanding to other cities.  The place is garnering serious attention, and it's because if ever there were a time and place to share in the exciting world of independent brewing, the time is now and the place is the Option.",0.8606,0.842,0.089,0.069,0.5105138888888889

I explained that we were having a good time but the music was simply too loud.  I asked why they turned it up all of a sudden as everything was fine before the way it was.  He told me that this is a metal bar and to ""go on-line and read the reviews.""  He informed me that it gets much louder, put on a slow dance song and said ""go dance with your girl"". Sure enough as I went over to my girlfriend, the jerk of an owner showed us just how loud the music can get.  What a prick.  I left immediately.   If you enjoy going to establishments where the owner mocks you and the staff treats you like crap even though your party has spent a few hundred bucks in the joint, this is the place for you.  If you like heavy metal so loud to the point where you can't carry a conversation and your ears are ringing by the time you leave, by all means give this bar a try.   I will never go back to this place again.",0.8296,0.8,0.107,0.093,0.541798941798942

First off, the front window was plastered with Miller High Life signs.  I saw it from a distance and though nope, this can't be the craft beer bar I'm looking for.  I had to stare at the sign before I believed that I was at the right place.  Of course sure enough I walked in to be greeted by a great line of craft beer taps.  I asked the bartender about it and he simply explained the the owner LOVES Miller High Life.  Okk..... Another oddity as this place only lists their beers on a chalkboard near the front of the bar.  No description, no price, and its not even categorized by style.  This a HUGE pet peeve of mine!  For a bar that claims to be a beer bar and rotates lots of different lesser known beers, not  have descriptions or anything else besides the name is absurd.  It discourages people from trying new beers that they have not heard of.   Anyways, so I ask the bartender for either a malty beer or a Belgium.  He tells me about a porter they have.  I ask what else they have and he tells me there is an English IPA......  Ya, I 'm relatively sure they have a lot more beers which better fit the categories I requested.  Well it turns out the porter he recommend was off the hook, so maybe I forgive him. It also may have been that I had a bad bartender (or am just awkward) as the other servers seemed to be socializing with patrons, offering samples, etc.   As far as the food, it is far above average pub food, but nothing out of this world.  I got the blackened chicken sandwich which had tasty zesty sauce on that was just the right amount of spiciness.

My boyfriend is a beer drinker and although he didn't know many of the names on the extensive chalkboard list of beer offerings, the beer he chose was excellent. Now, on to the food. We ate quite a bit. 7 dishes to be exact. I only write reviews when something is either very good, or very bad. The food all around was good. Not spectacular, but for a bar, some of the better food you will get. However, I have this to add and this IS the most important thing; I have lived in Chicago for 8.5 years and Chicago is known for it's food, right? Last night was the first time I have had REAL Creole Jambalaya the entire time I have lived here. Seriously! I couldn't believe it! One bite and I was hooked.

A lot of these beers you can't get anywhere in the city, or even the country. But yeah, that's already been mentioned. We went here on Christmas evening, and since I had already had my fill of rich foods for one evening, I was still able to try some guacamole w/ their homemade chips (crispy and chewy). As well as 1 of their wings (and I usually don't eat wings) which had an excellent sweet and spicy sauce. Again, we've already been told the food is good here too... Here's my favorite experience about Local Option. I've been told that this only happens on a rare occasion, but if it's slow enough they sometimes have ""karaoke,"" meaning there are no words in front of you, but you can sing whatever you very well damn please while the bartender/DJ finds the track for you on Youtube. I'm not kidding. There was this girl there, obviously a regular and has done this a few times, who is an opera singer. She had an amazing voice! She sang some Christmas carols to even ""What a feeling."" Her dad even sang a song or two. There was also another sassy regular who did his rendition of ""Sweet Transvestite."" I had to show off some of my vocal chops too. I'd like to think myself somewhat of a singer, and even though I was a bit unsure at first, I sang my usual ""go to"" karaoke song ""Heart of Glass."" Unfortunately, with the crowd by my side (and not to mention more and more beers) as the night went on...I sang a few more from Bjork to Robyn to the Misfits. Yes, that's right. I apologize everyone who was there cause I may have been a tad obnoxious, but the staff were welcoming and didn't seem to care. Then at one point, if I thought the night couldn't get any weirder, one of the bartenders did a dance around the place wearing a plastic Burger King King mask. And no, I wasn't just hallucinating.  Thank you for letting me be a drunken diva for the night. I will be back. But hopefully (for mine and everyone else's sake) there won't be singing.",0.9646,0.814,0.119,0.067,0.49078772534654896

The food is fine, fairly priced, and generously portioned.  The jambalaya specifically is good for being in Chicago (aka not spicy and not really the correct rice).

One person decided that the service was terrible because he went, for the first time, on a 3 Floyds tapping event with a party of six that all wanted food and beverages split over six separate cards and this option was rejected by the staff. If it had been any other night they may have a point but splitting that many checks is restricted by many restaurants at usual times, but to expect this amount of service time on a night like that is ridiculous. I was there and that place was packed that night and I would say that I never had to wait more than 2 minutes for a drink and that the staff was super friendly to everyone around the bar. As for the atmosphere, yes it is loud and they play metal at night, take that for what it is.

Lots of stuff you're not likely to see on tap at other beer bars in Chicago.  They've still got a line of Mikkaeler Beers on tap which feature some pretty great stuff.  They've got Dark Horse's Double Crooked Tree IPA which I haven't seen anywhere outside of Michigan until here.  Also, 3 Floyd's topless witch.  They have a few Belgian taps (Wittekerke was one) which is always a plus.  The bottle list is also pretty amazing with a huge list of stuff I haven't tried. Adding this sort of beer list to the ample seating and rather enjoyable decor and as mentioned, this becomes one of the great beer bars of Chicago.  Another huge plus are the bartenders.  The Friday night crew (guy and girl, sorry didn't get your names) are a great tandem.  Both are extremely helpful and great to talk to about beer.  They are more than willing to direct you to something new that you might like. Biggest and most glaring issue are the prices.  I know the DePaul neighborhood will support this kind of pricing but $9 a beer starts to add up after awhile.  Probably even more annoying about this is the lack of a beer list to show just what you're throwing your cash down on. In either case, it's tough not to give this place a high rating for their awesome selection and excellent service.",0.9967,0.722,0.228,0.05,0.6297647907647906

I'd be up in your beer menu on the reg if I didn't have to deal with a bunch of shrill Michigan transplants putting their beer snob cap on for the first time swarming around. Its name couldn't be more fitting - it's definitely the local option when in the area and suffers much less from the typical area clientele than other places nearby. Same really sweet, intensely knowledgeable bartender every time I've gone in. Recently, they had about 8 Mikkeller handles, including some single hop gems (still thinking about the Nugget). I paid $9 per beer, which would be excessive if I weren't a sucker for anything that I can't find on the other more selective taps in town. I did have the grossest beer of my life here once upon a time (a Creme Brulee stout), but I take full responsibility as the bartender tried to kindly steer me away from it. I've never had the food but the menu looks to be a step away from the regular bar chow with its cajun flair.

I didn't see the Gumbo on the menu either. The most disappointing aspect of my dinner was that my steak tacos were changed as well and not for the better. My steak was cut smaller, there wasn't as much sauce on there as usual and wasn't balanced and flavorful as before. THE FRIES ARE CHANGED. Those delicious little pieces of heaven of beer battered fries are now these large steakhouse fries which didn't even remotely taste beer battered. I did order some items that were new to the menu such as the Pork Rinds and the Korean BBQ tacos. Both failed to impressed me. The Pork Rinds were so hard I thought I was going to break a tooth but the sauce they came with was good. But why would I get the Pork Rinds for the sauce?

While it's fun to go during the dinner hour or later at night, some of the best times I've had at the Local Option have been during the day when it's slow.   My only complaint is that it can get pretty cold in there during the winter. Whatever you do, don't sit by the front door or windows. The door is slow to close and there is no exterior door so when people come and go, it's as if you're eating on the patio. Besides that, the front windows are quite drafty. I spent one (delicious) meal wearing my jacket and scarf.  Check out the Local Option!!!",0.9957,0.738,0.226,0.036,0.4414377289377289

2008-06-10,2.0,"I'll start off by mentioning how amazing their beer selection is.  SERIOUSLY.  If they had a club where you had to drink all of their beers and get initiated into some super cool fraternity with a jacket or a plaque, I would be all about it.  I would work my way all the way up to the President.  With all the choices I had, I had a couple pale ales and plotted my choices for next time. Unfortunately, my experience here was marred by a kitchen staff/bar staff blunder that just happened to bring out the I-will-rage-on-you side of me, which usually only happens a couple times a year.  I had my friends from college in town and our group of 5 planned for a quick dinner around 8.  At the suggestion of one of my other friends, we reneged on my initial decision to go to Goose Island and chose this place because of the close proximity to all and the supposedly excellent beer selection.  We wanted to keep it kind of quick so we could spend a full night out drinking. We got there, and saw every table was filled with people, but the place probably only had about 50 people.  My friend suggested we just walk somewhere else to grab a bite, but the 5 barstools at the bar looked like they needed to be less lonely.  We sat down, asked for menus, ordered some beers, and placed a food order.  About 10 minutes later, a table from the front moved on out, so we transplanted ourselves over there and kept chatting.   After about 30 minutes, we hadn't seen any food come out.  The same after 40.  45 hit and I was starting to get really antsy.  On top of that, no one had come to take a beer/drink order.  I walked up to the bar to figure out what was going on.  After rudely explaining myself, I was told that there was a party of 8 and 10 ahead of us, but ""yes, it is ridiculous to wait this long"" and that he would go check.  Lots of talking, frantically looking at the computer screen, walking to the kitchen window, etc.  Suddenly, we have a waiter taking our drink orders, and I figured out that they likely didn't run our order.  After about 20 minutes, we ended up getting our food.  The waiter told us that someone must have hijacked our food and apologized.  Then he went on to mention that, because we moved from the bar to a table, it confused the system.  OK.  Whatever.  All you have to do is press a button to switch the ticket, and the restaurant is about the size of a 3 bedroom apartment - we moved to a table 10 feet from the bar, not in another galaxy. We pounded our food down quick and asked for the check.  I was shocked to see that we were still charged fully for everything, maybe a beer or two missing from the final tab.  When I was a waiter, even the slightest mix up warranted at least some sort of discount.  This was ridiculous.  I would have said at least a free round for everyone.  Oh well.  Next time I want something fairly quick I guess I'll have to hit up McD's. While I am a little bitter about this, I would like to go back and try all their beverages out in the hopes of finding a new summer favorite.  The food WAS good after all, and if there is a way I can get take out, I would consider it.  It's definitely worth taking a look at, but beware of eating in... and moving tables.",0.9768,0.842,0.099,0.059,0.5247514359279064

I really missed what the Local Option brings to my life. Which is, really freaking good food. I do live in the neighborhood but I am not hugely into this as a night scene for myself, though i will say I've had pleasant experiences (it's more about my habits); I mostly come for lunch. I'm actually getting hungry thinking about it.  The seared tuna fish tacos are amazing; their white sauce is the perfect addition, along with the wedge of lime. I am also a huge fan of the shrimp po boy, which is beautiful and delicious and gigantic (and not very dignified to eat, so bear that in mind). The bayou burger is another great choice. In fact, I've liked everything but the crab cakes, and I am not a huge fan of crab cakes in general so...  I've also had time to get over their remodel, I really miss the old slightly divey feel. But, it is very clean and not overly new now, although rather loud as another reviewer mentioned. The breakup -- well, let's just say it was a combination of factors. Which turned out to be a dumb reason to not have the excellent mayo-free cole slaw and the amazing fries that remind me of my trip to Belgium.",0.9972,0.629,0.284,0.087,0.5847842056932966
2007-09-26,3.0,"I am so torn on my rating- I love the food at Local Option, and in my opinion, have the absolute best wings in Chicago.  They aren't traditional spicy wings- they have a barbeque sauce which is absolutely delicious. However, I absolutely cannot stand the atmosphere here after they remodeled a few years ago.  And the noise level- it is excessively LOUD.  Really unnecessary.  They do have the seating area in the back, which is less loud (and I think is considered non-smoking).  I still liked it better before the remodel and they tried to make it ""cool"".  Regardless, I will be back because I love the wings!   Go here if you love food as much as I do- very good bar food with a southern twist (fish tacos, etc.).  It's also a good neighborhood joint, but is geared more towords deaf smokers and sports fanatics.",0.9484,0.844,0.145,0.011,0.5281159420289854
2007-07-18,3.0,"Stopped in for lunch today and enjoyed the mahi mahi sandwich. It's always great to get a sandwich on a brioche bun. You would never know it from outside, but this place takes a seafood spin on bar fare up a notch. Other items are fish (tuna or swordfish) tacos and also burgers and other meaty items. I spoke with Tony, the owner, and plans are to make the bar into a craft beer mecca a la The Map Room and Hopleaf. They now have about 10 beers on tap, including Two Brothers, Hoegaarden, Allagash, and Unibroue. They want to double the amount of tap beers. Can't argue with that! The prices are slightly higher than expected for bar fare, but given the quality of the seafood and the Lincoln Park locale, it's worth a visit here.",0.8358,0.906,0.084,0.011,0.3611111111111111

2007-05-29,5.0,"I used to go to this place way back when they hosted the annual Chicago Pugs Against Hunger group. I'd bring my pug, Hal; he'd snort around for a bit and I'd munch on the wings or whatever they had available. Now, I'm over 21 and I've been paying regular visits to this place for dinners in the past couple of years. They have incredible swordfish tacos. Unfortunately, swordfish gets a bad wrap, but these beauties are really worth a try. Just stay away from them if you've got a bun in the oven, I guess. But swordfish or no, almost everything on the Cajun menu is a hit: the fries rock, catfish is delish, and po' boys---come on. You can't really go wrong with a food that has a hyphenated word in its title. That said, The Local Option is a great neighborhood bar if you just want to throw back a pint or spend a couple of hours eating some good grub.",0.8963,0.801,0.125,0.075,0.43412228796844177
2007-05-22,4.0,"I would always drive by and I was slightly curious about going in. I know the area, just not the bars. A friend suggested to go and watch the Bulls and I was a little hesitant. I was hungry, near starvation and needing to eat, was not in the mood for a burger or the usual bar food. So after I waded through the crowd and smoke I made to the back table area. Not totally impressed. The front seemed so much more fun lively and decorated than the back. We sat down and looked at the menu, I was quite happy seeing some things never on a bar menu, scallops, gumbo, jambalaya, po'boys. We got the wings and guacamole for appetizers and I wasn't thrilled with the wings but I swear if the guac wasn't homemade I would be surprised and the freshly made chips seared my fingers but were oh so good! I ended up getting a salad, I needed to balance the apps and beer, and although there was too much lettuce the sesame soy dressing was an unexpected joy! Service was good, just not much to say about the back eating area, literally, there is one tv and tables, so bring a good conversationalist, but come hungry too.",0.9849,0.816,0.156,0.028,0.48429951690821244

However, I will eat there if I'm in the 'hood and it doesn't disappoint. The menu has food with flavor! Not every thing is deep fried or grilled pub food. It has been seasoned!! So the fish or chicken tacos are nice. The Po-Boy is good (you're not going to mistake it for NOLA good but still...) and the easy menu just goes on.  Service is usally pretty good. The wait staff can focus on the bar section a little too long and forget that you're over there.

Somehow, this place still works.  They have a big beer selection but I uncomfortably ordered a glass of wine making sure to request ""whatever red you have.""  Our waiter (who by the way looked like he had just stepped off the golf course) was cool about it and even came to our table with the bottle when I needed a refill.  For food, we started with the cheese quesadillas  and honestly they were some of the best quesadillas I've ever had.  I think it was the added avocado - somehow brilliant.  I also had the big mixed greens salad with blackened Amish chicken.  Yum.  It was huge and as my boyfriend noted, ""now that's a $9 salad.""   I would totally hang out at this bar for just drinking and if the eats are good, well it's an added bonus.",0.9925,0.756,0.214,0.03,0.579440665154951

And since they now have the NFL package, its turning into a great Sunday bar. They offer brunch on Sunday's but I have yet to indulge. Don't be put off by its close proximity to DePaul, this bar is nothing like Mcgee's, it gets crowded on friday nights, but its never packed, and the crowd is around 25 years old.
