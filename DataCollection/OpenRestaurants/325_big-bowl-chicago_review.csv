The ambience of this place is clean and modern with good service and the menu has some good variety but the quality of food here is just not up to what it should be. I ordered the kung pao chicken and had I know that I would be eating half a can of Morton's salt perhaps I would've gone for a salad instead. There aren't many choices for a non high-end Chinese restaurant in this neighborhood but I think Panda Express might be a better alternative.  Besides the one dimensional flavors of the two dishes I got (I think they may have used the same sauce and only one type of flavor), they were just wayyyyyyyy too salty. I have been to this place twice so I feel like it wasn't a mistake that they added too much salt.  I would highly highly recommend toning down the salt in the dishes.

Nothing special but they were not bad.  I ordered the Panang Curry Chicken. As I said earlier it was flavorful and not dry. What I mean by dry is the chicken wasn't dry. Sometimes with restaurants when they serve that thinly sliced chicken it's over cooked, but with Big Bowl that was not the case. The curry was the perfect spice level and seasoned well. The chicken and rice was tender and both were cooked perfect. The rice was nice and fluffy. The curry itself had lots of flavor. The extra add in ingredients like the peas and peppers were nice as well.  Overall, I enjoyed big bowl and would suggest them to others.

He was washing some glasses right in front of me. Anyways, he finally got my drink order. I ordered the strawberry sangria. The description sounded great. Took a sip of it, and unfortunately it wasn't anything to rave about. It tasted like strawberry syrup. Had a weird consistency too. I was ready to order my entree and I told Trey. He must not have heard me because he went on to do other things even though he shook his head. I waited another 5 min and then had to flag him down again. I was finally able to order the orange chicken. It was pretty good!  Sadly, Trevor never checked on my to see if everything was ok. I put my credit card in the glass in front of me signaling I was ready to pay. He came and took payment.

The style of the restaurant and menu will require those who expect flavor to go the extra mile and clearly stress that during their order otherwise what you will get is a bland surprise. This is the first time I've had curry that tastes bland but there is a first time for everything, isn't there? I've had their food before and it wasn't as bad as it was this evening so either there is a new chef or someone in charge has a bad cold and can't tastes or smell their food enough to know when they have put too much seasoning or not enough.

To start off we had lemonades and pomegranate ginger ales. The lemonades were very much on the overly tart side, and the ginger ale oddly tasted like medicine. No bueno. To start, we had edamame, chicken egg rolls, and calamari. They were all okay, nothing special.  I ordered the panang chicken curry, one person got the pad thai, and another did a build-your-own stir fry. My panang was unlike any other I've ever had. First of all, there were peas in it. One big sign of major inauthenticity. But the flavor was all wrong--far too peanutty-- and the curry wasn't smooth. The chicken was rubbery, and overall it was not very enjoyable. I tried the pad thai, and it was actually worse. There was oddly a ton of cilantro in it and no Thai basil to be found. Definitely a different flavor than I was expecting for pad thai.

As soon as we walked in the manager, Mike brought us to a quiet table in the corner and asked our drink order while letting us know some staff favorites as we were undecided on what we wanted. Quickly after we ordered our server Sean brought over our drinks and went over the specials. Being our first time it was nice how both Mike and Sean were so patient and thorough while going over all of the specials and taking the time to answer all of our questions which we had a ton of.  For our order we got the peanut spicy noodles and the dumpling platter. My husband who lived in china for 6 months can be a bit picky about his dumplings but even he said they were awesome. My favorite were the spicy peanut noodles (they are cold just so you know when you order and you expect them to be warm).  Once we ordered the timing of the apps and dinner were spot on. I was amazed at how fast they would clear every bit of trash or old plates off our table. Again, this is going back to my initial statement of how great the service was.  Dinner I had the pad sew ew and husband had the chefs choice stir fry both of which were fabulous. My husband went with spicy and boy the stir fry had a kick, which was perfect for his liking.  All in all we had such a fun date night at this spot and as I mentioned earlier it was mostly due to the staff.

2017-01-10,2.0,"I went there with a group of six. We made a reservation and asked if the accepted the Lettuce Entertain You gift cards which they said yes to. I called again before arriving to confirm the accepted the gift cards, they said yes. When we got there we showed the hostess the gift cards and she said they do accept them. We are not from the area and we're just given the gift cards as a gift but needed to use them at one of the Lettuce restaurants. We were told three times that they accepted the gift cards and once after the hostess looked at them and confirmed that they do.  We ordered drinks from the bar and since there were six of us we did the group special for 22.95 or something like that per person and we paid extra for beef under the impression we could use the gift cards. When the bill came our waiter told us they were holiday special gift cards and could only be used during specific hours. We said we weren't from the area and that's why we asked three times even showing the gift cards to the hostess once to triple check if they accepted them, and our waiter still said no. We asked to speak to the manager and he told us the same thing. We asked since the hostess did look at the gift card and confirm that they accepted it if he could just take the gift card amount off our bill or give us a discount, and he said there was nothing he could.  The food was very good and the bar drinks were delicious. Our server (don't remember his name) was also really cool and a great server. But the manager should have compensated us a small amount for the mix up because we did ask twice before going, and showed them to someone at the restaurant who confirmed they do accept it.

2016-12-22,4.0,"We have been coming to Big Bowl for years and I'm just now getting around to writing a review.  Food- we ordered two dishes to split between 3 adults and it was more than enough. In every city I go to, I'm always on the hunt for the best pad Thai and I would say this is pretty close if not it. The chicken pad Thai had just the right amount of spice, fresh and vibrant looking veggies, and lots of fresh lime flavor to the dish. There was no over powering fish sauce or too much of any one ingredient and the dish wasn't sticky which is one of my pet peeves with pad Thai - overall the ingredients were included in just the right proportions. We then did the stir fry bar (pick your own veggies, protein, sauce and base of noodles or rice) with tofu, veggies, and coconut green curry sauce. The bar of veggies is pretty impressive and there's definitely an art to cramming all that you want into the medium sized bowl they provide. Pretty epic dish- the sauce was so tasty and coconutty, complete with all your preferred veggies and perfectly stir fried tofu.  Ambience- big restaurant, pretty noisy most of the time but accommodates a lot of guests with a mix of large/small booths and tables. Decor is colorful and nice and fits well with the overall theme of Thai/Chinese fusion.  Service- I have had the full spectrum from great servers to horrendous. The hostesses really need hugs or something as well, they always look pretty miserable to be at work. We asked for fortune cookies from the hostess on the way out and she looked at us like we had asked her for a couple hundred bucks.  bad service at a restaurant is kind of a downer. This is the main reason why they fall to a 4 star in my book. At any rate, the food is what keeps me coming back. Wish they had one of these in Ohio!",0.9828,0.811,0.142,0.046,0.5777568922305764

I ordered the shrimp and scallop in ginger sauce for dinner with jasmine rice. It was a generous portion that I couldn't finish and I wanted too so badly. Rice cooked perfectly, lots of shrimp and scallops which tasted awesome. Try the orange ginger ale to wash it all down, and apple spring rolls with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce for dessert. Our server was really friendly and checked on us often. Service was great and food came out fairly quickly. I didn't give 5 stars because they need to do something about their curb appeal. It has none. If it wasn't for the fact that my granddaughter was looking for rice, we wouldn't have gone in.

2016-05-20,4.0,"First, the negative stuff:  delivery from here - i think they use Dining Inn or CEO - is hit or miss, depending on what driver is assigned your food. But mostly, it's a miss.  I usually end up ordering carry-out and walking it home. It's so much quicker than waiting hours for food that ends up being lukewarm by the time it gets to you. 2. what happened to the summer rolls??? more importantly, what happened to the pad thai noodles and the tasty, light sauce that they were made in?  The last time I got a shrimp one, it was filled with peanuts and some kind of dreck-like green shredded vegetable that was way past its use-date.  It tasted like someone scraped together the remnants from the bottom of a food processor and threw them into the rolls.   The shrimp was fine, the wrapper was fine, but the noodles were gone and so was the sauce. It's completely tasteless unless you slather it in peanut sauce, which I don't like to do.   Same goes with the vegetable rolls, which in the past, they would occasionally switch up to include asparagus or cucumbers or avocado.  Now the summer rolls have this fried tofu stick inside them with again, NO NOODLES?! Why did they have to go and mess up the recipe?  That fried tofu inside what was once a light appetizer reminded me of the crap they used to sell at the Taipei 7-11 stores that I frequented during Junior Year Abroad.    The positives:  Nice managers, friendly servers and bussing staff.  Very tasty steamed chicken dumplings, fresh stir-fry bar, and flavorful Beef Chow Fun noodles.",0.9451,0.839,0.105,0.057,0.49375

If you're in the restaurant business, please clean the feathers from your chicken.  This is such a sloppy and unacceptable thing to happen with today's standard in food preparation & safety. Big Bowl refused to refund the order (even when pictures were provided to them of the incident), stating ""they only use boneless skinless chicken"" at their restaurants, which couldn't be further from the truth.  Get your shit together.  GrubHub, after spending 30 minutes on the phone generously offered me a whole five dollars, (and the credit doesn't even show up in my account) for a failed fifty dollar order.  Really, this isn't acceptable.  I'm disputing this charge with JPMorgan Chase if this is the game the restaurant & GrubHub want to play.  Now both Big Bowl & GrubHub have lost.

2015-10-08,2.0,"Don't go to Big Bowl if you think you're going to celebrate one's birthday in style. That wasn't even the whole issue, though. I brought my two elderly Chinese friends to lunch today, the wife doesn't understand English, but her husband, whose birthday we were celebrating, speaks a little English and has okay understanding if one speaks slowly and clearly.  For appetizers I ordered the potstickers for our table, which the waiter recommended. They were okay, a little greasy since they were fried, but my friends like them. The fried dumplings came with three special sauces, so we all had to more than double dip in the sauces and share germs. Had a waiter been available, I would have requested a spoon to put the sauces on our bread plates. Surprisingly, the soup was served before the appetizers. Common knowledge that an appetizer is served before a meal, I didn't think to specify that when ordering. So when all that food was brought to our table, I quickly told our waiter to hold off on the salads, that we want to have a leisurely lunch. We were there late morning, and I noticed there were plenty of empty tables--no need to rush us through our lunch.   After taking one bite of my squash soup, I saw there was chicken in it. Then the waiter returned to our table and apologized profusely, because I had told him that I have a vegan diet and wanted to know if it contained dairy. Today we learned that one undisclosed, secret ingredient in Big Bowl's featured roast squash soup is poultry. The waiter offered to take my soup away, but did not offer to serve me a new bowl of soup without chicken. Although he did mentioned that option when he brought me the check.  I don't understand why any restaurant would feature ""roasted squash soup"" on their menu and lead the customer to believe that they were eating a vegetable dish, hiding that one ingredient-- poultry. Because of a mistake like that, a waiter in a classier restaurant would have offered to take soup off my check--not today.  When my friends ordered a pot of soup to share, I asked our waiter to suggest a salad and he recommended the chopped salad. He kindly told them that one salad would be enough for both of them. I have to give our waiter credit for his wonderful personality. When I ordered the salad for myself, I just didn't realize that I was really ordering a salad for two, also. I could no finish half of it, even without eating much of the cup of soup. Although coined as ""chopped,"" the salad was more shredded--shredded red cabbage, shredded lettuce with a few peanuts and edamame and dried rice noodles! I specifically ordered my salad with dressing ""on the side,"" knowing salad dressings are loaded with oil. The waiter brought my salad with the dressing mixed in, and he tried to convince me that the salad was light and airy and that there wasn't much dressing. I insisted on another one, as I told him that I didn't even usually eat oil. When he returned with another salad he sheepishly told me it was made in the same bowl. But the order was still incorrect. I had to ask for dressing.  Finally when the waiter came with what I thought was a choice of birthday sampler desserts for my friend, we had all kinds of dirty dishes on our table, and I felt like we were being rushed and that no one there cared if my friend was celebrating his very special 83rd birthday. Then the waiter ignored my birthday guest, and told me about the desserts and only showed me the desserts, which was weird. So I requested the waiter to tell the birthday guest what was offered. Why tell me? My Chinese friend did understand, and he said he just wanted ice cream.  I asked his wife if she wanted some to, and she agreed. We waited for a long, long time thinking the waiter would return with two tiny portions of birthday ice cream in those same type of dishes. But when he finally came, he brought two giant bowls (I mean really, really large--like serving bowls) full of ice cream-- each containing 3, maybe 4 huge scoops, enough for a family of eight. I was at a loss for words as I was expecting a little sampler portion for this little 83-year man. They were dumbfounded, too. The waiter asked if they would like to split one, and yes, of course, please! Nonetheless, I had to ask the waiter to bring a separate dish for the gentlemen's wife. He returned with a small bread and butter dish. Well, I'm beginning to understand that if you go to Big Bowl Restaurant, about all you are are big bowls. Anyway, my Chinese friends enjoyed the ice cream, and I asked for the check. The waiter apologized again for the delay, because he said both orders of ice cream were on the bill, and he had to take one off. Silly me, thinking birthday dessert was on the house. Not so! Although, earlier I had alerted the hostess and even another waiter, but nothing else was done to recognize my friend's birthday -- no singing, no pictures, not even wishing him a ""happy birthday.""",0.9984,0.819,0.139,0.042,0.47285568908703224

The attached photo shows what the ""Slow Roasted Barbecue Pork Fried Rice, with Niman Ranch Heirloom Pork"" used to look like.  The ""heirloom pork"" has been replaced with pork shoulder (or something) plopped on top, and the rice was terribly soggy. Wet soggy (two orders).  You compare. Look at the photos.  Gone was the melt in you mouth pink pork slices, replaced with tough pork cubes. And also missing the sweet dipping sauce.  Compare the rice. Of course photos can miss-represent, but the new version is clearly ""moister"". OK, if you're going for that, but ""moister"" should not mean ""soggy"".   Seems like they replaced the fancy dipping sauce, and instead, spread the sauce ""moistened"" throughout the whole dish.  In any case, if it was simply replacing food products, no problem. Yes, heirloom pork was better, but things change. However, it was the quality of the preparation (demonstrated in the photos), and in my opinion, the sauces. The dish did not taste ""fresh"".  Using the Big Bowl, and Wildcard offers, we ordered seven dishes last week, and every single dish was not enjoyable.   Big Bowl is ""famous', I might even say it's their ""Asia style"" to use an abundance of sugar, and salt (if you've eaten there, you know that going in), but this time, the balance was off, way off, and the dish was left uneaten.

I remember the often told stories of Rich Melman visiting the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants to check up on the food quality.

Nothing too fancy but not like typical Chinese restaurants. This would almost hit the fine dining category in terms of ambience. The waitress was extremely friendly and explained everything very nicely. She was very pleasant.  The food options weren't too overwhelming. They had 6-8 dishes in Chinese, the same number in Thai and the option of Stir Fry bowl. The appetizer menu looked interesting but we skipped that and so I cannot comment about that.  I went for the Stir Fry bowl while my wife chose to go with Kung Pao noodles from the menu along with their Orange Ginger Ale, both of which she raved about.  The stir fry bowl - The vegetable selection was quite good and the veggies looked fresh. Something different about this place is that they do not stir fry your choice of protein along with the veggies. Only the veggies are stir fried and served along with rice and meat which is prepared separately.  It was delivered quickly and the taste was just amazing! The sauces they had used were just perfect and I cannot wait to go and have it again! Unfortunately that means making a trip to Chicago.

We drove to Chicago from Ann Arbor to meet with friends and before going out, we were starving and decided to eat here. I was not impressed at all. The ambiance is okay but kind of misleading. I kept asking my boyfriend if it was an attempt to be a fine dining establishment or hometown, organic based restaurant. The service was pretty good, especially for us coming in so late. To start off, we had the pot stickers which were awful. I would rather eat Ling Ling's from Costco than whatever they served here. We ordered the sesame chicken and the stir fry - both were average. I would rather eat at P.F. Chang's than eat here. Next time I'll go out hungry rather than eat here. It wasn't a horrible experience but it was pretty average.

The food is NOT drowning in sugary sauces, that cheat of cut-rate faux Chinese restaurants, and the flavor of the ingredients does come through.  The regular menu dishes are decent, though I've come to love the 'pick your own' section: you pre-select the meat (or tofu!) and the sauce, then when you're ready, go up to the selection of vegetables by the kitchen and select the blend you want.

For the atmosphere, the decoration with solid Chinese culture, as well as they have light music which makes people more enjoy the food. The menu is really easy for people to understand, because they have clearly and separate Chinese and Thai menu, also they separate their features.  In addition, in terms of the level of service, the waiter is very friendly and kindly.

2014-11-22,1.0,"Overpriced, mediocre food that lacks any cultural authenticity.  If you want mass-market Asian, Panda Express does it for about half the price, and is much kinder to your palate (and that's saying something!).    We ordered a Pad Thai and Pho.  The Pad Thai was pretty poor, with a flavor that I struggled to place.  Thankfully I called a bit of an audible and special ordered it with the crunchy sesame chicken instead of the normal chopped chicken.  Normally, pad thai can stand on its own, but I had to mix in the sesame chicken to make it edible.  On the bright side, the crunchy sesame chicken was very good, and does offer at least some hope for other dishes. The Pho Bowl was advertised as being for ""2-3 people"".  How, I have no idea - it wasn't even enough for one!  Instead of the usual beef, it came with chicken.  Ugh.  The flavor was reminiscent of  those $1 cans of instant soup you buy at a grocery store.  In fact, I probably would have preferred a good Progresso or Campbell's Chunky over what these guys had to offer.  Again, not a ringing endorsement.... The Sangria was good, but again, was expensive and fairly small/watered-down. Service was okay -- but we actually had to ask for chopsticks.  And hoisin and hot sauce for the pho.  Ugh. Chicago - you do not have to settle for this place.  There are much better alternatives just a stone's throw away!",0.9678,0.812,0.135,0.053,0.6159300595238095

Shrimp pad thai with no peanuts, no cilantro, no beansprouts and no basil :) then I pile on the chili sauce.... maybe.. MAYBE some potstickers if the company I'm with wants to split it and or their ginger ale. That's it!! I don't veer towards any other version of their pad thai.. Cuz it's been disappointing in the past. Otherwise I'm not the biggest fan of their other dishes. I find it salty, meh and an atrocity. Recently I've been here on a date night and it's always dependable cuz I order the same thing over and over again and just low key enough without being a total dump atmosphere wise for some company otherwise I'm cool with eating food from a cart down the street. Mexican corn in a cup from a dirty cart is fucking delicious.  So for a quick fix that's low maintenance cuz Lord knows we are lacking in delicious asian eats in this neighborhood and in Chicago in general... I'm allowed to be lazy after 40+ hours of work a week and not cook myself some asian flavors or trek to mediocre Chinatown or disappointing argyle.

2014-10-28,3.0,"Meh. I think I might have been biased going in because I typically don't like Asian chain restaurants... also very picky about my Asian cuisine.  I ordered the Penang curry here... which was good--- the chicken was cooked perfectly, and wasn't dry like I was worried about-- I hate ordering chicken because I'm always expecting it to come out overcooked. But it was good-- the curry wasn't bad either. I requested them to add tofu as well (well, actually I requested for a mix of half tofu, half chicken, but they said they had to add it for an additional charge, which, fine, I guess makes sense), but the tofu was just meh and flavorless. But that's the thing--- tofu is often something that a lot of Western restaurants can't do right... and I count Big Bowl as one of them. But if it's cooked right it's delicious! But whatever, I guess maybe another tofu centric dish here could be good and I didn't know.  Prices are higher than what I typically would pay for Asian food too... but I guess it's a nicer atmosphere than most Asian restaurants, so that's where the premium comes in?

We were personally greeted by the manager before our meal began and they were so accommodating to our large group. The baby needed vegetables reheated to a certain consistency and they heated it twice for us so she could get it down.  I ordered the chicken pad thai. While the flavors were there, I got more vegetable and beans sprouts than anything else. My husband ordered the pho appetizer and the bbq pork buns. The pho did not taste like traditional pho. It was like Asian Chicken noodle soup. I did like the bbq pork buns. They were tasty.  All in all, I think if they were trying to be authentic with the food, it didn't work. If they were trying to bring a new twist to traditional dishes, that didn't work either. I think they just need to pick one direction and plan this recipes accordingly.

2014-05-24,2.0,"WTF happened to you Big Bowl? Four years ago when I worked for LEYE I loved hitting this place up (granted the Cedar location...) after a double shift for a few cocktails & chicken potstickers- things have either changed or they were having a seriously OFF night last night.  Let me preface this review with the fact we decided spur of the moment to have dinner downtown on a FRIDAY NIGHT WITHOUT RESERVATIONS (yes... I know.) After attempting to get seated at SEVEN other restaurants (lowest wait time well over an hour- up to three and half at 2 places!) we decided to give Big Bowl a shot since we've had some great cocktails & appetizers there in the past.  I should have known walking in on a Friday night to NO WAIT was a red flag, I even second guessed myself at the last minute and wanted to escape to Eataly across the street (YES I KNOW- FAILLLL). But at this point we were pretty hungry, a little chilly & tired of running around so we decided to have a seat.  Ben B (not to be confused with hubby- weird!) was our server and he was... well... an experience. After determining we had been there before he immediately asked if we knew what we wanted & didn't review anything with us- especially not any specials they may have had that evening. I FREAKING LOVE their chicken pot stickers so we started off with an order of those while we discussed appetizers. My Ben was pretty disappointed in the beer list (but this is to be expected @ an asian restaurant so I'm not deducting points for this). Once we finally decided on some beers we asked the server to explain the difference between the 2 Trippels on the menu which he had to ask the bartender about (fine- I also get that not all servers are beer experts, I wasn't either so again no points lost here). Once the beers were ordered and arrived @ the table we had decided on everything else (Chicken Dumplings & Kung Pao Chicken to share)  Chicken Potstickers: Balls to the Walls AMAZING as always. Love the 3 sauces that come with this too! Honestly we should have just ordered 3 portions of these & called it a night!  Chicken Dumplings: Why the fuck are these on the menu? These are EXACTLY LIKE THE CHICKEN POTSTICKERS BUT STEAMED WITH NO SALT, NO TEXTURE AND NO FLAVOR. FTN (fuck that noise)- never again.  Kung Pao Chicken: Decent size portion for one or two (if the two are sharing something else). Decent flavor & spice profile although nothing special/different/out of the normal. We did really love the kale (@ least I believe it was kale) that came with this dish- it was honestly the best part of the dish.  So- by this point in the meal I knew we were going to be going on Yelp to review this hot mess meal and was discussing our review points with hubby. Hubby is nearly sure that the manager overheard this conversation because immediately after he ""just happens"" to stop over @ our table to ask if we're interested in a ""extra soup"" ""on him"". Hubby says sure & I said thank you. This is the only time anyone ever checks on us- we are never asked how our meal is going, how the drinks are, the appetizers, the entrees- NOTHING. I know LEYE isn't supposed to ask ""How is everything"" but never once did he say ""Is there anything else I can bring to the table"" OR ANYTHING OF THE LIKE. Talk about ""stellar"" service...Anywho! The manager brings over said ""free extra soup"" -- Hot & Sour Soup which is the managers FAVORITE ITEM ON THE MENU- TO DIE FOR HE SAYS....  I LEGIT (AND I KID YOU NOT YELPERS) ALMOST VOMITED IN MY MOUTH JUST BY SMELLING THIS SOUP. I'm sure it is an acquired taste that clearly I do not possess but JESUS H CHRIST.  NEVER EVER AGAIN.

Despite this flexibility, both Big Bowl's pad thai and lettuce wraps were, to put it as delicately as possible, cringeworthy.  LETTUCE WRAPS: Never having been to Big Bowl, my friend and I wanted to try something ""noteworthy."" Having been labeled with the logo WOW! next to it, we decided to try. And sure enough, it was ""WOW!"" WOW! in that it was sloppy gunk of dark matter with mostly softened rice noodles, sauce, green onions and sliced cabbage. It's hard to make a really good lettuce wrap filling, but it is even harder to butcher it completely. You're already serving this dish in lettuce, how can you be so cheap as to not even offer a little more substance? PAD THAI: Why would you put string beans and bok choy in pad thai? What's with the excessive use of red peppers and dressing? Where'd all the peanuts go? I may not be Thai, but I like to think of pad thai as a delicate dish where the combination of ingredients are individually subtle, but combine to create a slightly tangy with a hint of savory goodness. What I had the pleasure of eating was more like sour wet noodles with a consistently very much like that of jajangmyun. So explain to me, how has this restaurant gone so long with 4 stars?

Every dish was delicious. I was very impressed. I went there on Saturday evening the following week and ordered the same meal as on Wednesday to-go. When I got home I was looking for a repeat performance of Wednesday but instead got a lot of big surprises. The chicken dumplings were okay, but the ribs were absolutely tasteless. I searched for any kind of flavor whatsoever and found nothing. Then I opened up the hot, hot chicken noodles and found it to be completely inedible.  The noodles were soaked in vinegar and floating in a huge puddle of oil. There was hardly any chicken in the dish and there was no spicy heat at all - nothing. I tossed it in the trash and moved on to the Schezuan beef. The only thing good about this dish was the rice - which was good because I was still hungry. The beef dish itself was completely tasteless. No flavor whatsoever. How they are able to accomplish this is beyond me. And... yes - it was floating in a huge puddle of oil. I picked at it for a bit but then threw it in the trash with the chicken noodles.

($1 upcharge)  The fried rice was NOT good.  :(  Way soggy.  Mentioned not liking it to the server & he gave some lame excuse about it being organic rice.  blah, blah, blah.  I didn't like it, didn't eat half of it & he should have removed the extra charge from my bill, but whatever...  Friend had their Pad Thai & it looked amazing!!  I'm getting it next time.  We both enjoyed their Shandy drink.  A mix of honey, lemon, beer & vodka.  It sounds weird as all get out but it was super refreshing with the spicy savory food.

The food and dining experience was all pretty normal and flowed really well. The thing that set me off was the initial tone set by the doorman. As the manager explained to me their security is through a separate company so I didn't really blame the restaurant. The waiting area around the host stand and bar is pretty small especially for 6 or so parties trying to wait for a table so we were all in a tight squeeze. People were eventually waiting inside by the tables by windows filling up any space between the entrance and host stand. I apparently stood somewhere not preferred by the restaurant so the doorman asked me to move. Fine. I saw people waiting for a table too standing exactly where I was standing. Nothing was said to them. From where I was standing I moved back a couple feet a little closer to my original position and then the doorman came back to me and got smart with me. He said that he had told me before to either move closer to the host stand or behind the door and then Proceeded to ask me, ""so which one are you going to do?"" at this point I honestly was shocked and felt singled out. There were so many other people before blocking so many tables by the door. Why now and why give only me trouble? Why I stayed I don't even know. At that point I was pissed and didn't want anything else to do with this restaurant. After my party sat I informed a manager and he was very apologetic and honestly tried to make it better for me. I appreciate the restaurant for their sincere efforts but I don't think I would be returning anytime soon and will be reticent to suggest this location. I didn't seek out to get anything for free I just wanted a nice dinner in a great city.

2012-08-29,4.0,"At times I feel walking into a restaurant without any preconceived notion is the way to experience the true value of it. All I knew about Big Bowl, was based on my Twitter communications with #spicychat and that they support sustainable local produce and enjoy well-seasoned food creations. Big Bowl is one of #SpicyChat's loyal foodie supporters. Needless to say, on my recent trip to Chi-Town I had to stop by and say hello. Co incidentally, I was in Chicago to attend the #IGC12 Independent Garden Center Show (world's largest trade show and conference for independent garden center owners, managers and buyers). It seemed befitting to pay a visit to a restaurant which not only supports foodies and serves locally grown produce, but have gotten more involved with their Seed to Table innovative approach by contracting with farmers to grow sustainable/organic crops. Crops that are grown from heirloom seeds, selected by Big Bowl, and cultivated on the farm with the help of the restaurant staff. Now they are serving more than 700 lbs each week to four of their Chicago Locations. I walked into a vibrant & modern restaurant proudly showcasing an open kitchen with fresh local seasonal produce bar. Over the course of my lunch I couldn't help notice how completely packed the restaurant got. Conveniently located on E Ohio Street, it is walking distance from Magnificent Mile, drawing clientele from both tourists and Chi Town residents. A quick glance over the menu displayed a familiar menu serving classic regional Chinese and Thai specialties. There was a 'Group Share' menu, Big Bowl menu and the Classic al carte dining. Oh I wish my boys were with me. After all how much can a girl eat? The Summer Harvest Celebration menu grabbed my attention. Each time you order from their specials, Big Bowl and Free bird donate $1 to growing homes. After all charity begins at home, so I ordered the spicy Sichuan eggplant. Locally grown eggplant, freebird chicken, sungold tomatoes dressed in a spicy Sichuan sauce - yes, it was indeed 'spicy' and I couldn't get enough of it. Hands down, one of the better eggplants I have tasted outside of China. I was told by our pleasant server that their 'ginger-ale' is homemade and it is the signature drink. Not being a ginger ale fan, I politely refused and enjoyed my refreshing and cool cocktail; a nice compliment to my spicy meal. Of course personally for me Cold Sesames Noodle is reminiscent of good old times in NYC, so I couldn't help ordering a bowl. Cold noodles lightly dressed in an addictive peanut sauce, garnished with cucumber julienne; yes it was light and refreshing. Though, I didn't quite grasp the lying down bowl concept in the presentation. A meal at Big Bowl is incomplete without their signature 'From our Farm to your Table' stir fry bar. What a fun and interactive way to enjoy your meal. Now, stir fry has been around for donkey years, what makes Big Bowl special? Allow me to elaborate. Fresh local produce, protein from small family farms, curries made from scratch, freshly toasted spices and all, authentically prepared capture the essence of flavors signature to Big Bowl. Need I say anymore? My signature Big Bowl: chicken, greens from the bar, panang curry, and jasmine rice. The flavor was lighter than any Thai curry I have been exposed too. While I was just pondering that, with great pride the sweet server informed me the curries are all made in-house from scratch starting from roasting the chilies. There is not a more comforting dish for me than the aroma of kaffir leaf infusing the chicken and perfectly cooked jasmine rice. Even though I was dining alone (indeed a rarity for me), I had a wonderful time. Between the vibrant energy of the restaurant and the friendly staff, I felt at home. Big Bowl manages to re-create authentic flavors producing bold and bright flavors with fresh produce, herbs, and clean flavors. So all you people hooked on heat and complex yet comforting flavors of Thai & Chinese cuisine has to offer, Big Bowl is one restaurant I am pleased to endorse is worth the trek, regardless of which suburb of Chicago you reside in.",0.9994,0.754,0.218,0.028,0.4807319223985891

My hibiscus iced tea was very delicious, and the melange of items I ended up picking for my bowl turned out pretty good in the end taste-wise.   The only things that make this not a five-star experience is that the bill ended up being a little on the pricey side.  But I should have known better since the Near North neighborhood is usually all tourists on the weekends.  Also, in my opinion, they seemed to skimp a little on the meat (I ordered chicken) that I got.  It's a little different from Flat Top Grill (where you pick EVERYTHING), so I guess this is how Big Bowl does it.  I would be back again if I'm back down here.",0.995,0.796,0.197,0.007,0.5023015873015874

Afterwards, we ordered the BBQ'd spareribs, and were genuinely impressed. The meat was tender, juicy, saucy, and came off the bone perfectly.

2012-05-08,5.0,"I LOVE this place. It is incredibly delicious and tasty and you can make it as healthy or unhealthy as you'd like. I've been here about twenty times and almost always order the stir-fry. When you get the stir-fry you pick the type of vegetables, meat, sauce, and rice you want. Either you can have the chef choose your veggies based on the meat/sauce/rice you're getting or you can grab a bowl and choose your own mix of whatever vegetables you'd like from the vegetable bar. I always go with this option. You have the choice of filling the bowl as much as you want and usually I pile it incredibly high and then drop it off at the stir-fry station (yes I've piled it so high that I've dropped things out of my bowl while taking it to the station). The vegetable bar has about 15 different veggies with all the standards and them some more seasonal specials. There are about 6 stir-fry sauces to choose from and all the typical meats (and tofu) are available. For rice you pick between white, brown, or fried. If you want your dish to be healthier, opt for the brown rice, pile on the veggies, opt out of meat, and ask for light oil/sauce. They are very accommodating with the oil/sauce and they really do make it light if you ask for it. Conversely, I've gone with people who have asked for extra sauce and they really did go heavy on the sauce. Basically, you can create whatever you want and the end result is delicious. You can also ask for chili paste on the side to make it more spicy. They also have amazing customer service. They once put peanuts on my stir-fry dish when I asked for no peanuts (the kung pao sauce comes with peanuts, but you can opt out of them). Not only did they promptly make me a new one, they gave me a complimentary dessert and took the stir-fry off the check. They also have great Chinese New Year specials during that entire week. Last year was the year of the rabbit and they gave every person born in that year an entirely free meal (drink, appetizer, entree, and dessert) on new year. It was amazing. They have a large variety of drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic and both Asian inspired and non-Asian inspired (like sangria)). Their portions are huge--not just with the create your own stir-fry, but if you order off the menu, too. It's not too big that you'll necessarily have to get a to-go box, but you will definitely leave full, which is important for me. The exception is dessert. The desserts are small and are not meant for sharing. They are big enough only for one person and they are certainly not hefty. But they are interesting and this way you can focus on the delicious entrees. I wouldn't make the claim that this place has authentic Asian food, but if you want delicious Asian food and don't care about it being Americanized and inauthentic, definitely give this place a try.",0.9964,0.836,0.141,0.023,0.5327732683982683

Imagine my surprise when I got the chicken pot stickers and it came with a new spicy chinese mustard sauce. The original sauce was a reason I came to the restaurant - I even would take bottles home. Now it comes with a spicy chinese mustard I could get at any cheap Chinese take out. The waiter said it might be because they were getting rid of peanut oil because of people's allergies. Um...let people with allergies order their own food - don't ruin mine! Then I got the fiery chicken dish which used to come with nice white chicken pieces ride and vegtables. Now it comes deep fried with a dark sauce on it. Yes SOGGY deep fried chicken. The flavor was ok but the whole experience was like bad chinese takeout. Not the flavors it used to have AT ALL.

I ""discovered"" Big Bowl way back in 1998, when I was working in a cubicle farm in the burbs with few food options nearby.  I worked late.  A lot.  After a few nights of cuisine a'la Vending Menace, I placed a takeout order with Big Bowl.  My boyfriend at the time had me addicted to potstickers, and Big Bowl serves theirs with this crazy crack mustard.  It's probably just MSG and yellow #5, but I don't care.  It makes my toes curl.  My first time tasting this combination of potstickers and Crack Mustard, I ran around my cubible giggling.  I'm not kidding.   Fast forward to 2011.  I've been living in the city since 2002 and I'm not allowed to like chain restaurants.  I hide my occasional Cheesecake Factory cravings from my friends, from fear of being stabbed to death with a tightly-rolled copy of Time Out.  Listen.  I understand Chicago is home to a zillion amazing non-chain restaurants.  But I need to remember my suburban roots lest I become one of those city-snobs that won't venture farther west than Irving and Pulaski for fear of being sucked into the strip mall vortex.   So anyway, Big Bowl.  For years, I quietly seek out others who enjoy this VERY Americanized Asian food for what it is:  (Tasty) Americanized Asian food.  We sometimes jump into cabs and sneak away for lunch, but it's rare.  Then one day, I find out my boss also secretly likes Big Bowl and I'm on their website, looking for the number to the delivery service they use.    They have a ""store"" link.  I click it. THEY SELL THE CRACK MUSTARD.  OHMYGOD THEY SELL THE CRACK MUSTARD!!!   It's 93 degrees and humid.  Don't care.  I practically skip from my office to the location on Ohio.  I pick up lunch.  I buy a bottle of mustard.  I get home that night ready to bathe in it.  I look at the date on the bottle - it's expired by 2 months.  Could I?  Probably.  Should I?  Probably not.

Then we were given the worst table ever right by the line and people waiting. There were other empty tables so I asked the host if we could change tables but I guess not.  Food: We ordered dumpling appetizers and they were good. I ordered a mojito and it was so fresh and delicious!! The vegetable curry was great. It had a good mix of vegetables. :-) However, the pork dish that was ordered was terrible and too oily. :-( For desert we ordered the Mochi oh my so goods! They are small but so flavorable and the chocolate/caramel sauce makes them so much better!  Overall the food was decent but nothing spectacular.

I've never been to this place before, but the name, branding, and outside décor speak ""casual diner"" to me. I walk in there shocked to find a dim-lighted sit down restaurant! It probably would have been better if I looked at their website for carry-out ordering, but I figured since I was there already and had such a small request, it wouldn't be a big deal... I ordered the chicken dumpling soup (small), and fresh ginger ale. I never eat a heavy lunch and wanted to use my last LEYE scratch off so there was no turning back now. So I wait....and wait....and, what the heck is going on? How long does it take to whip up a bowl of soup and ginger ale?! Finally the woman at the carry out counter comes back with a brown box and salad and she says, ""potstickers and salad"". And I'm like, ""no I ordered the soup and ginger ale"". OH!.....??? Just an uh oh look and walks away, and FIVE minutes later she comes back with my correct order. Seriously, I could have been out of there in FIVE minutes instead of 18!!!! At this point I am very upset and just wanted to get out of there, but instead of directly apologizing and admitting the mistake, she kept asking if I needed utensils, cookie, blah blah.

I don't like PF Chang's either so I just assume it's the same sort of thing. Anyway I'll just stick to local places from now on.

The crowning achievement for me was dessert - the famed but short-lived Sweet Corn Gelato was amazing.  It is only available during August and is made in conjunction with a local gelato shop.  Online the treat got rave reviews but I was still a little wary of any dessert involving vegetables.  Trust me this dish does not disapoint.  It is a very sweet taste, like french vanilla with a little extra hint of movie-theater magic.  I'd definitely recommend heading to the Big Bowl before the end of August.",0.9943,0.779,0.211,0.01,0.5310666666666667

It was a meal of major extremes. Everything either sucked or was outstanding. There really was no middle ground here. This was not only a meal, it was an adventure. You never knew what was going to be around the next turn! Major Kudos: 1)Our server - He took very good care of us and was very fast, efficient and friendly. I could not ask for more. 2)Ginger Ale - It was a hot day and the homemade ginger ale was a hit! It was delicious and refreshing and hit the spot. 3)Shrimp Pad Thai - Not taking into consideration the shrimp, I really enjoyed the flavor medley in the noodles. I have never tasted Pad Thai quite like this. The flavors worked very well together and I am thinking that this is one of my favorites. 4)Pot stickers - They were grilled up perfectly and had an outstanding flavor. Major Suckage: 1)Atmosphere - The temperature in the place was not comfortable at all. It was way too hot in here to properly enjoy the rest of my meal. The layout is very funky too. You had to take a winding road to the restroom as they were not conveniently located. 2)Shrimp Pad Thai - I did thoroughly enjoy the noodle part of my Pad Thai. The shrimp was another story. The shrimp had an overpowering nearly repugnant overly fishy taste to them.  3)Orange Chicken - This dish was extremely underwhelming and disappointing. It did not have much flavor to it at all. As the dish sat, the sauce became extremely thick and took on a sludge like quality to it. Holy Crap and a Half:  Our server recommended for dessert a blueberry and peach crisp with homemade whipped topping. It sounded right up my alley so I decide to give it a whirl. I am very particular about my desserts and this stuff blew me away. Whenever I order a dessert in a restaurant, I am going to judge it against this particular dessert. I am confident in saying that this is probably the finest dessert that I have ever ordered in a restaurant before. It was not overly sweet as the fruit provided a good amount of natural sweetness. The creaminess/crispness and cool/warm contrasts were perfect! The dessert is what made me give this place three stars instead of two.",0.9951,0.782,0.168,0.05,0.6009985234403838

They offer chili pepper sauce or soy sauce when an entree arrives (which kind of breaks my heart a little, what people do to their food). The highlights are the tender chicken, the bits of lemongrass and ginger adding a nice fresh zing, and the freshness of the veggies. It's good Panang.

This dressing is so good, I would do shots of it if it were offered. It's a sesame, ginger, soy, rice wine vinegar concoction and it's simply delicious. From there, I usually order the mongolian beef or orange chicken. The mongolian beef has shiitake mushrooms, and while not a traditional ingredient in mongolian beef, adds a flavorful touch. The orange chicken is your basic garden-variety dish that you can find on any Panda Express in Anytown USA, but again, I'm not going to Big Bowl expecting to be transported to the heights of culinary wonder.",0.7023,0.96,0.04,0.0,0.4121527777777778

The menu featured items such as Kung Pao Chicken, Pad Thai, Fried Rice, Beef & Broccoli, and other ordinary items.  Seriously, other Chinese and Thai restaurants in the area serve the exact same thing, and I'm willing to bet the prices are lower, and the food tastes better.  I guess you can classify the menu items as 'safe foods.'  You know, you have to try really hard to F-up the dish when it's being cooked. I selected the Teriyaki Chicken Fried Rice...which isn't even Chinese or Thai.  Teriyaki is Japanese!  Whoever created the menu needs to attend Asian Cooking 101.  Hell, I'll even pay for the class myself.

The constant looking at our cameras probably was another good inclination. So right after we sat down, we ordered. Dumplings for an appetizer, and I had the yellow curry and my boyfriend ordered the pad Thai.  Right after we placed the order a man who was not our waiter brought us out an amuse-bouche. It was very tasty, and given the decor and people in here, I didn't realize that the restaurant would have done something like that. I was pleasantly surprised.  The dumplings were good, I will say that we do have a really good dumpling restaurant here in Kansas City so I wasn't super impressed. The sauce that came with them were also really tasty, even though i cant remember what they were now, there were three...  Anyways, getting on to our meal, mine was excellent. I am a huge curry fan and this wasn't too sweet or even spicy. I loved the flavor and everything about it. My boyfriend's pad Thai was awesome. It was my first time trying it and we loved it. I will say that now, having tired a few pad Thia's, i am still. The sauce was really good and the noodles were amazing.

One of them says ""Hey this place looks good"", so we put it on the list of things to do the next day. So we arrive for a late lunch after an afternoon on North Ave Beach, and boy are we hungry, hungry, HUNGRY! The ambiance is great. Red, black and bamboo with a mix of new music and old school classics playing in the background, not so loud as to be distracting though. The hostess seats us immediately. Our witty, attentive and very knowledgeable waiter asks ""Have you ever dined with us before?"" Response, ""Nope we are Big Bowl newbies."" He recommends trying one of their fresh (made on-site) flavored ginger ales.  We each tried a different flavor (you should too) and we loved them all.  After bringing our yummy ginger ales and giving us time to peruse the menu, he goes over it with us and recommends his favorite dishes.  On to the food:  Appetizers:  *Chicken Potstickers - They were very good and the 3 dipping sauces were excellent. Our waiter also brought a small bowl of Big Bowl's special chili to same. Woo kicked up some heat but was 'OH SO GOOD!' *As we are finishing our first appetizer the manager comes over with another ""Thanks for trying us"" appetizer that was delicious and free of charge.  Can't quite remember what they called it but it was chicken and portabella mushrooms in a teriyaki sauce served on a whole fried wonton. Main dishes:  *Chicken Pad Thai- Acceptable Pad Thai, nothing to really WOOT WOOT about though. *Teriyaki fried Chicken - Very good fried rice dish, veggies and chicken. *Panang Curry Chicken - This was the piece de resistance (maybe I should try to find a Chinese or Thai term that expresses the correct sentiment...nah). Chicken and rice in a light peanut-coconut curry sauce with snow peas and green beans.     If you can't find something on the menu that makes your taste buds salivate, Big Bowl also offers a do-it-yourself stir-fry bar.

The calamari was phenomenal, the potstickers fantastic. One word of advice, watch out for the wasabi infused mustard. It packs quite a kick. Oh and the deserts: try the lemon cake. Yes when you read the descriptions it won't even register as something interesting. We tried 4 different deserts (there were 4 of us- don't judge us) lol. The lemon cake was by far our favorite.

They're both got big red round dishes on the side of the building. I wonder if they copied one another.  I recently went to Big Bowl on a whim because me and my boyfriend found out Bamboo Garden was closing at 10 and since it was close to that time, we decided to come here. Good Choice. Since it is a franchised restaurant i would think everything would taste like all the same dishes we ever ate. But safely to say, this asian fusion restaurant was a bit different. I ordered the spicy sichuan beef. And man was this super spicy. Those fire breathing head indicators weren't lying about it being hot. I think it was too hot even for me. And i do like hot. But not to the point where i can't really taste the food anymore. It was good nonetheless, even though i had to blow my nose a couple of times(My nose runs when i eat super spicy foods).  But here was the highlight of big bowl: my boyfriends dish. ""sweet ginger sea scallops and shrimp"". Simply to die for!....One of Big Bowl's signature dishes. I kept eating his dish i almost forgot that i had to eat mine. The scallops were excellent and with the sauce, it was heavenly.  Perfect balance of savory and sweet.  I am totally getting that next time. The only bad thing i noticed was the portions of the meals, it was a bit on the small side and might not please the people who are looking for leftovers the next morning. Initially, i though it would be more food, but hey, i never finish my food anyways so it was a perfect portion for me.  I will also add that, ginger is really incorporated into every aspect of this restaurant; from the drinks to the food, to the desserts. I wonder why they didn't call it GINGER? But if you do go, please get the Orange Ginger Ale... I heard it was really good. I got the Passion Fruit Ginger Ale and it was ok.

2009-07-15,3.0,"Big Bowl was a dear friend during a very cold winter working in the loop. I recall the days in December and January; it was still dark when I went into work, and after sitting at a desk all day, it was dark again (and freezing) when I came out.  All I wanted to do was run home to a hot shower and plop down on my couch in a big sweatshirt. Hence Big Bowl, which is right near my ex work place.  After work, when I was hit by the cold, I would run in to the counter at Big Bowl and order myself a bowl of their chicken pho.  It was the best thing ever; it took the edge off my hunger, and rejuvenated me.  After a bowl of that pho, I felt cheered and willing to go to the gym.  I could run my errands, and use the rest of my day instead of just giving up on it.   I am wary of chain restaurants though, especially when it comes to ethnic food.  I doubted they would have good entrees, and never bothered to order a whole meal until my last visit.  I overheard - (okay fine, I deliberately listened to) a conversation between a man and a woman near me.   Man: Wow.  That was surprisingly tasty.  I mean I'm really surprised. That was a great meal. Woman: I know!  I usually hate chain restaurants, but this was great.  It actually tasted like my favorite thai place near my house.  You know Sticky Rice? !!! Sticky Rice has a five star rating from me, so this comparison excited me.   I finally got around to coming in for an entree this week, after some shopping. And this meal is what brings Big Bowl down from a five star rating. Mediocre food, with the WORST service.   I ordered the green curry with rice, very spicy.  I asked the waiter if they had brown rice, and he told me they didn't.  Fine. A few moments after I ordered, another lone diner - a very friendly and nice tourist from the UK seated very near to me, ordered.  We were close enough to talk and hear each other's orders. ""Sir, would you like white rice or brown rice with your order?  I strongly recommend the brown rice."" This piqued my attention and I looked up just in time to catch the glance the waiter gave me.  A passive aggressive glance to make sure I heard him.  Um. So my food, which came with white rice, immediately took me back to my Air India flight of 2003.  This flight is memorable for a few reasons, which I won't go into right now. But it tasted like airplane food, and *Indian* airplane food, no less.  I could not taste any Thai basil, and it tasted more like defrosted mutter paneer than anything else.  ""Fresh"" was the absolute last word I would use to describe it.  And the white rice, which was supposedly Jasmine, had none of that fresh Jasmine taste to it.  It tasted like regular long grain rice.   I thought about salvaging it with some spice, since it wasn't spicy at all.  The waiter never checked on me, but I managed to grab his attention when he walked by.  I asked him if they had any red chili pepper I could add to my dish.  He said they didn't.  I then asked if they had any kind of hot sauce or chili paste I could use.  He said they had no hot sauce in the restaurant. At this exact moment, my new British friend decided to pipe up ""Waiter, could you bring me some hot sauce?"" ""Of course sir."" and he walked away, at which the tourist looked at me and burst into giggles.   Not funny, you damn Brit.  I'm hungry and grumpy. But of course he gave me his hot sauce, and it didn't help. I didn't touch my meal after the second bite.  When I finally got ahold of the waiter again, he asked me if I wanted to wrap it up.   ""No.  Actually, I'm very unhappy with my meal.  See, if you recall, I wanted brown rice - "" ""All right.  I can clear that for you.  Do you have room for dessert?"" ""Nope.  But I would actually like to speak to a mana-"" ""Okay then.  I will be right back with your check."" When he dropped my check and ran away before I could say anything, I let it go. And the time it took from when the waiter cleared my table, dropped my check, took my credit card, and brought  me my sign slip?  No less than 25 minutes. Ugh.  Between the disapproving looks and behavior of the elder waiter (my gut is that he was being sexist and disapproved of a female eating alone, but whatever.  I've been a server and I know servers, like everyone, make judgments - but it's unprofessional to act on those judgments) and the mediocre food that wasn't even what I wanted to order,  I'm less likely than ever to come back here.   But the memory of all those wonderful cheap bowls of pho on those cold days with my shitty, stressful desk job over this past winter counts for something - they were not only a nutritional and sensuous pleasure, but provided an almost emotional reward for me each time I got through another day of thankless busy work at a computer.   So I will leave you, Big Bowl, with an ""A-OK"" by Yelp standards.  And maybe by next winter I will have forgiven this meal and will be back at your counter (hopefully with a better job).",0.9952,0.814,0.124,0.062,0.504358009976822

On the whole, it was very standard, though the chicken was very juicy. The rice was bland and heaped on the same plate as the curry, ensuring it turned into a large soupy mess. I would give Big Bowl one more chance. The food was just okay, but the prices don't reflect that fact. For $15, I want to be wowed and amazed. Big Bowl?

Aside from tthese two items (the chicken one being a biggie), the food here is delicious. I would highly recommend the Kung Pao chicken, the Thai hot pepper chicken, pad thai, panang curry is phenomenal and the coconut curry is excellent. From the appetizers, the pot sticker combo is great. I love the three sauces that they serve with them. I always end up dipping my fork in them after the pot stickers are gone! The hot and sour soup is exeptional! It is the tastiest one I've had and I am a huge fan of hot and sour soup. Their prices are not cheap, but not unreasonable. This is not a hole in the wall Chinese or Thai restaurant!

Having worked in at another upscale Chinese restaurant that also prioritizes fresh food and interesting flavors over the traditional msg fest, I was so glad to discover Big Bowl downtown! Sometimes the Loop restaurant reviews I read on Yelp are so depressing--truly mixed reviews-- that I hesitate to spend money or take a chance on any of 'em. Big Bowl is a fabulous alternative.  We went out for supper on Wednesday night with a friend visiting town on business, and we all were incredibly pleased with our meals and the overall experience. Our server was great--pleasant but not smarmy, attentive without hovering. The food came out hot and on time. We started with vegetable potstickers (delicious) and I had a pomegranate- gingerale-vodka cocktail, which was good but a little too hot gingery for my taste, though the aftertaste was pleasant, and the thai chicken panang curry. Oh MY! That was an excellent dish! The curry was a lovely peanut-lemon grass, flavorful and full without being too heavy, the peapods were crisp and the chicken was lovely. It had a little heat (as I was warned) but the server warned me about the little red peppers I should avoid in the dish--the whole thing was great! And when I took home leftovers, I think the dish improved over night in the fridge. I got two lunches out of it. My fiance had the chicken pad thai, which he loved, and my friend, a vegetarian, tried the Big Bowl make-your-own stir fry. When she asked our server's advice about the many sauces available he was able to find out what she liked and make some good suggestions.  Really, it will be no sacrifice to go back to this place.

My dish was pretty good (a crunchy, spicy shrimp dish, as I recall), but doesn't stand out in my memory. It was nice. The other member of my party had the salmon pad thai, which sounds intriguing enough on the menu, but in reality it's a complete disaster. The sum of adding salmon to traditional pad thai is simply fishy, malodorous noodles. We were there towards the end of the lunch hour rush, so the wait staff was busy, understandably. However, after our lunch was served, the waiter didn't have a chance to ask if everything was okay until he cleared our plates. At this point, we pointed out the acridity pad thai, and, to Big Bowl's credit, he removed the dish from our bill. BB has a comfortable atmosphere and is conveniently located. The fresh ginger ale, which comes in a variety of clever flavors, was brilliant. Therefore, I doubt our experience there was typical, though it's probably best to stick with the basics.

2007-06-19,2.0,"Alright, so a key thing for me when eating ethnic food of any kind is the level of spiciness.  Despite being six kinds of spicy in a metaphorical sense, sometimes black pepper can make me cry.  No, seriously: there are Doritos that I can't even smell without feeling like someone's shoving needles into my tongue.  I am a spice wuss.  I'm okay with it. So, cut to last Friday's date night, and we wander into Big Bowl for some Asian-fusion-noodle-stir-fry action.  For some reason, I'm in the mood for pad thai; usually the peanut butter spaghetti is not my favorite, but that night it sounded really good to me.  On their menu, they bill their pad thai as ""mildly spicy.""  This is always a red flag for me, since ""mildly spicy"" usually means my eyeballs will melt.  So, I line up a couple clearly non-spicy backup options, and ask the waitress if they can do a totally non-spicy pad thai.  She says sure, I do a dance of joy, all is right with the world. Long story short, whoever cooked my meal obviously didn't believe me when I said I wanted it not spicy, because what they brought out made my nose run, my face turn red, and the tears pour.  I tried to tough it out (I hate sending back a meal), but it was too painful, so I grabbed the waitress and explained that my dinner was, in fact, spicy.  Shortly thereafter, the cook comes out to explain to me that without the spices, the dish would be bland - clearly implying that he knows better than I do what my preferences should be.  I love arguing with someone else about what I do or do not like. The second version they brought out was still too spicy, but I could at least eat more than a couple bites.  The manager came over and tried to smooth things over, and the waitress was very sweet...but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  An overpriced (not to mention weak) margarita didn't help rinse it out, and my suspicion that the cooking staff were discussing how many of them should spit in my food didn't either.   While the food itself seemed okay, the attitude was abysmal, and my delicate pallette will not be visiting again.",0.0286,0.808,0.091,0.1,0.46883195307108355

I wanted to love Big Bowl so much that I tried it twice before writing this review. But ultimately, although I thought it was okay, I didn't love it.

Again, it was pretty forgettable, although better than the Thai food we had tried the time before. I appreciated the ""Mongolian BBQ""-style of picking your own mix-ins, but I've had much, much better. And if you want a meat, they just add it on top of the stir-fry rather than mixing it in.

I personally recommend the Potstickers as an appetizer, as well as the Crispy Lemon Chicken as the entree.  If your not too much into soda or alcohol - try the Hibiscus Iced tea or the Hibiscus Lemonade - mmmmm! Not a place to drive to - but just take the subway to the red line stop Grand!",0.9198,0.731,0.219,0.05,0.6575757575757576
