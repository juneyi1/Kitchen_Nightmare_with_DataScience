2017-08-16,1.0,"I was assaulted by an employee of handlebar and treated differently (by all of the staff including the manager on duty) from the white people that I went there with. As a former semi frequent diner there, Handlebar service is generally poor. I never minded because I enjoyed the food until I went there with my wife and several friends and experienced racist and hostile behavior from the manager, and waiter and I was even physically assaulted by the bus boy. As the only black person in my party they were rude and insulting to me specifically and their behavior changed only when I left after being shoved repeatedly by the bus boy (I did not retaliate).  I would not have written a review but this is a pattern since I am not the only black person that I know to have been mistreated and treated differently from white patrons.  Since, according to Yelp I am not allowed to ""draw conclusions about the broader business practices of the business"" based on my own experience, I am not going to say Handlebar is racist. I will say that I experienced racist behavior from literally everyone at Handlebar during the period of time that I have described herein. I will never go here again, and you shouldn't either.",-0.9712,0.854,0.018,0.128,0.5337868480725623
2017-08-12,2.0,This is my second experience at handlebar where I walked out sourly disappointed in the food. The service was decent. We ordered an assortment of tacos and the black catfish and grilled fish tacos were inconsumable. Incredibly salty and bitter. Their kale salad was bland. This restaurant is located in an area that has a surplus of taco venues so I would definitely skip this for other options if I'm looking for tacos. Don't recommend.,-0.648,0.858,0.038,0.104,0.5509259259259259

2017-08-01,4.0,"I have been coming here for years and absolutely love this place.  It's great for Wicker Park to have vegetarian options and I think they should have more. The ambience of Handlebar is no frills, but is a divey, rustic aesthetic. They also have a lovely patio in the back when it's summer, which is super enjoyable. The service here is always good and fast too.  I have had the same waiter here for years and he's always on top of things. The vegan buffalo wrap has been my go to meal here for years!  The buffalo seitan is chopped up into little bits and has a great, potent buffalo flavor, I wish they would put more buffalo sauce on there actually.  Their vegan ranch is so tasty and I don't like regular ranch.  The wrap comes with a side and my favorite is the smoked gouda mac and cheese.  It's just so fulfilling in every way.  I have also tried the fried pickles and mozzarella sticks.  Both are very good and have delicious breading.  My other favorite is the chili cheese fries.  The vegetarian chili is amazing with fresh peppers in there, the fries are seasoned soooo well, and the cheese on there is a nice cheddar cheese.  I always want to eat too much of this. I have had their Chicago Style Tofu sandwich and was underwhelmed by it.  It was kind of bland and there was not enough giardiniera in there.  This is why I took off a star. Their brunch is also a success.  I love their vegan biscuits and gravy, it's so hard to find a good vegetarian biscuits and gravy. Their drinks are also reasonably priced and I love their unique ideas like a vegan White Russian.  Their bloody marys are also creative and decadent.  Just try it once at least because there are so many delicious toppings in there like a fried pickle! I will continue to come here for the delicious vegetarian cuisine, reasonable prices, and tasty drinks.",0.9984,0.703,0.258,0.039,0.5804041248606466
2017-07-31,1.0,"My husband and I have given Handlebar SO MANY chances because we wanted so desperately to have another option for veg and vegan food in the city. We've been disappointed every single time by the poor quality of service (that feeling of being served by a person who is too proud/too much of a hipster to be in service to you) and the totally mediocre food.  The main reason we kept coming back is because it's one of the few restaurants in the city that has Tex Mex style queso. And it's pretty hard to get queso wrong. During our last and final attempt several months ago, we dropped in for a drink and some queso after work. We added guac to our dip order because...when is guac ever a bad idea?The menu listed queso and chips at whatever the price was and then an additional charge to add guacamole.  When our food came out, we immediately noticed that we received the same amount of chips for the two dips that usually comes out with just the queso (which we had ordered many times before). We were just halfway through our dips when the chips ran out (no surprise) so we asked for more. The waiter notified us that we could have some but at a charge.  So, I guess we were supposed to eat the rest of our queso with a spoon? Or we should ration our chips? Shouldn't the additional chips be included in the costs of the added dip that we were already paying for? We asked to speak with the manager on duty. Upon arrival, she was salty and unapologetic...and clearly didn't grasp the logic of the situation put in front of her, going off on a tangent about how expensive ingredients are currently (which directly contradicts what is actually happening in the economy) and how their chips are homemade. Clearly zero training or experience dealing with customers in these types of situations. BTW, if you've ever fried chips at home, you'll know how cheap it is. And this would be the perfect opportunity for Handlebar to provide (almost) free value to its customers. Businesses are always a reflection of the owner and this one is full of a bunch of low energy stoners who were never taught how to provide good service. The owners clearly don't know anything about customer service (or they don't care) and would rather offer very little value at a high price than create a repeat customer.  The staffing and pricing issues reflect the inexperience/carelessness of ownership. Be more hands on, solve these issues, and try to understand Lifetime Customer Value. That'll beat the strange food cost strategy of surprising customers with an extra charge for something required to consume another item they've ordered.",0.9881,0.854,0.106,0.04,0.4846904761904761

All three of us ordered their version of a Bloody Mary with the baby beer back (Miller high life glass bottle) and a fried pickle/olives/pepper/lemon wedge. The Bloody Mary wasn't too spicy and very good in my opinion.  For my entree I ordered the fish tacos and it came with their famous vegan chili and brown rice. There were 3 fish tacos with the dish (which is a great portion) but the tilapia was a little too blackened for my taste. I love blackened chicken and fish usually but this was a little too charcoal tasting for me personally.  The vegan chili had great flavor and was very good. It was a big portion so I shared the chili with the table and gave my third fish taco to a friend (who agreed the fish was too blackened) and we went on our way. All in all it was a good experience though.  Pros- Bloody Mary Cocktails/Vegan Chili Cons- Rats in the alley kept scampering by/fish was a little over cooked,0.987,0.797,0.17,0.033,0.54375

On my last TWO visits, I experienced absolutely awful service. I thought the first time it had to be a fluke. Our order was taken, our food took over 30 minutes to be delivered and that was it. We were never checked on, nobody apologized, and after waiting an extra 15 minutes when we finished eating, I went up to the hostess asking for a check. It was so disappointing since I was introducing the place to my vegan friend for the first time. Fast forward to a few weeks later, and I brought my sister-in-law there for the first time. We also experienced the exact same minimal, forgotten service. Food came out quick this time. But we were never checked on. And after sitting there looking around, holding our credit cards in our hands, clearly done with our meal for ATLEAST 15 minutes, we finally got up and asked the hostess for our check.

There was a lot of mood lighting going on, and the hipsters were spread out as far as the eye could see. The menu is very vegan and vegetarian friendly. I was feeling moderately healthy, so I ordered the blackened catfish with sides of sesame broccoli and smoked gouda mac. I really liked the flavors of the sides, but the catfish was extremely salty. I also wasn't a huge fan of all the black pepper that it was doused in. I tried my friends' shrimp and grits which was actually really rich and appropriately flavorful. I also tried the fried plantains which were bomb. I would love to come back to try some of the other vegetarian options, particularly the tofu dishes, but the catfish I could have done without.",0.9279,0.807,0.138,0.055,0.5708333333333333

Their menu is solid and if you're feeling like a vegetarian who just wants to drown in the comfort of cheese get the gouda mac. Breakfast quality off one time as of late, specifically the omelette, so perhaps a new cook?  Lots of meal experience short....  Try the: nachos, catfish, Mac, all regular brunch items especially diablos (omelette was a special), salads, tostados, maduro, nut stew and drinks. Only things I always skip are the buffalo chicken tofu wrap, grits, and the fried pickles. Just a matter of taste really, as their food is made with fresh ingredients and tastes great.

He wasn't very attentive and we had to ask the host to get his attention more than once. Because of this, we decided not to leave a tip and just pay with the next bill up ($37). We left and had walked a reasonable distance from the restaurant and we see the waiter (a youngish, tall lanky white guy) running after us screaming about our change. When he catches up to us he gets in my boyfriends face and starts going off about how dare we not tip him and that he didn't need our 24 cent tip (which wasn't even for him, we just wanted to get out of there quickly) and started going on about his woes at the restaurant. Its was the most offensive treatment I've ever received at a restaurant. I honestly can't believe that happened and don't understand how they hired someone so rude and obviously unstable. I called to let the managment know and the girl who answered knew who I was talking about before I even described him, which must mean this is an ongoing problem that they have done nothing about. I wanted to like you, Handlebar. But when I go into a restaurant, I don't expect to be harassed by the staff. It was scary and uncalled for. Spend your money elsewhere fellow yelpers.

It's a great place to go to if you're vegetarian and are looking for a place that will also please meat eaters.

Depending on the time you go there is pretty easy parking on North Ave both in front and across the street.  Food: Great variety of options for vegetarian, vegan and carnivores!  Brunch- Country Fried Portobella, Pepita Scramble, Chocolate Pretzel Peanut Butter Cake Country Fried Portobella: We did both the blackened tofu and the fried egg. If you had to choose, I'd say the fried egg. Portions are large and the dish is a bit on the heavy side. I'd recommend sharing or saving half for later. Really tasty and if you are not a fan of mushrooms, it's still worth trying. The breading and the gravy have a lot of flavor that it masks that weird taste of mushrooms (I personally do not like mushrooms, but still enjoyed the dish).  Pepita Scramble: I got it with the eggs. Perfect amount to keep you full throughout the day. I ordered it with the mixed greens (made it lighter) I'm not sure if they were onions or poblanos, but topped on the scramble was something crispy that added great flavor and texture to the softness of the scramble.  Chocolate Pretzel Peanut Butter Cake: SUPER addicting so be careful. That peanut butter frosting MMMMM. I don't believe it's vegan, but I highly recommend if you have a sweet tooth.  Price point is pretty good. For two dishes, dessert, a chai and coffe it cost about $40 total without tip.  As far as drinks go, I ordered a Chai and it was alright, personally isn't one I'd order again unless I was craving one. It didn't have as much flavor as some other ones I've had.

The chili Mac attack or fried Alvarado tacos are definitely my two favorite dinner entrees.   The black bean tostada are by far the best appetizer, the tostada is just magical and melts in your mouth.  But the best reason to come is the dessert, the fried pies are just to die for. Traditionally the filling is PB&J, which is my favorite, but sometimes the filling varies with season.

Anyway, on to the review of Handlebar.  Getting there sucked.  Not because of the venue, but just because Chicago traffic.  But the point is that only half of our party was there on time and the rest of us were late.  Some venues would say ""suck it"" and just kick our asses out or make us wait for hours.  Not Handlebar.  Despite the fact that they were pretty busy, they actually managed to fit us back in with only like a 10 minute delay.  Amazing. Many people think that Handlebar is all vegetarian.  Nope!  Yeah, there are a lot of really awesome veggie recipes on the menu, but there are also meaty dishes.  Don't worry, you'll be okay.

A few issues though: the menu didn't list that the tofu is deep fried (no biggie), it came drowning in sauce (it was more like a soup bowl), & it was ridiculously salty. Loved that it was also sour & spicy, but after a few bites, I drank an entire glass of water & had to send it back.

We waited forever for our bill after asking three different people which was kind of annoying... BUT the food is super good- and I really like restaurants that can cater to anyone (vegans, vegetarians, eaters of the flesh, etc) and the patio was cute- plus the drinks were on point. so four stars for  you- but get your staff together.",0.9513,0.797,0.153,0.05,0.6375

She got the buffalo chicken sandwich and really liked it. Get the chili fries! They did do a really good job with whatever substitute they used for the chili.  I got the tacos which were good, but left me still hungry. With that said, I would give 5 stars if they offered a few non-vegetarian dishes.

So many options that sounded amazingly delicious - but when the food arrived at the table, it was mostly meh. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (made of tofu) and it was okay, but nothing special. The hot sauce was missing the OOMPF you expect. Although, the texture was right, especially considering it wasn't real chicken. So I guess I can't complain too much. Some vegan/vegetarian places that offer Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches (out of tofu) get the texture completely off. The only reason I give this place 3 stars was the mac and cheese I ordered as a side. I honestly probably would've been happier if I had ordered it as my entree. It was so creamy and delicious.

I love that most of the menu can be made vegan and they have an array of interesting drink options.  The vegan sloppy joe was very good. I, for one, don't care for messy meals, but this one holds true to its name... It was very delicious though. My only other complaint is that you can't get a pretzel roll with it if you order vegan! The Black Bean Maduro is another excellent choice. It's a very savory dish that will fill you up. In general, portion sizes are very generous here.  Service has always been pleasant at Handlebar. On my last visit, we came here for dinner and our meals were done in less than 10 minutes. That is super fast!

Both of us were a bit skeptical as to how delicious vegan food could be, but when our sandwiches and mac and cheese came, we sang a different tune.  My ""green meanie"" was thoroughly satisfying.  Our table was also quite close to our neighbors' and we ended up eavesdropping on their conversation about the logistics of touring as a band.  Very hipster place, and very cool.",0.8828,0.891,0.087,0.023,0.659141414141414

It's a small place and it definitely has a sort of biker vibe to it -- rock music playing, tables tightly packed together and posters/signs scattered across the walls. Our waiter was very attentive and took time explaining food items, since their menu can be a little overwhelming to non-vegetarians (definitely more unique menu items than Native Foods, which is pretty mainstream). We opted for the diablos with the eggs and jack cheese, as well as the Pepita scamble. Both items were great choices! The diablo came with black beans, rice and corn tostadas. A bit spicy, but nothing too crazy. The pepita was sweeter, and the kale and sweet potatoes made a great combination. Nice healthy option for brunch.

They had a pretty good selection of music looping on their sound system, and I liked the décor and punk vibe of the interior. I ordered the fried avocado tacos with brown rice. The rice is unseasoned and fairly bland, but the tacos were awesome. Personally, I think they would fare better on corn tortillas rather than flour, but the black bean spread and slaw really gave the flavor some depth. The drinks have cute names but the beer selection is pretty small. Our service was prompt and efficient.The menu has tons of items on there that sound amazing, and I wish I could have tried more. The only negative I had was that the table we were seated at was super-small. We could barely fit our plates and drinks on it, and we were encased in a pretty narrow area.

This review is for carry out, I haven't been able to dine in yet but I'm sure its amazing. I called in an order on a Thursday night and the food was done fast (around 15 minutes). I ordered the fried avocado tacos with a side of smoked gouda mac and my roommate had the green meanie with a side of sesame broccoli. The food was uhmaazzingggg, especially for an all vegetarian/vegan place! The tacos were perfectly balanced with avocado, ranch, and a light slaw on top. They're pretty big and come three to an order-I was full after just one! Made an awesome lunch for the next day. Now, let's get to the smoked gouda mac. Do you have any doubts that a gouda mac would be anything but spectacular? No, and nor should you. Super creamy and delicious, and also a huge portion! Definitely a must here.

Waited for 15 min. before they bestowed upon me their lackluster, unimaginative vegan creation.  For one thing, it didn't seem very fresh, or visually appealing, kind of like the looks of the Handlebar restaurant itself and it's waiters!   Fries weren't even crisp, kind of soggy and greasy like they had been sitting around awhile.  Chicken, or seitan, as it's called in the vegan lexicon, was blahsville too. I don't know what kind of seasonings they put on it, or in it, it just seemed kind of weak and lacked flavor, along with the tomatoes and wilted lettuce that accompanied it.  Honestly, I could've made a better sandwich.  Guess I can cross this place off my list because I probably won't be returning anytime soon!

We were able to snag a table in their lovely outside patio Saturday evening around 7:30pm.  It took a long time for our server to come by to place orders. We finally did and our food took an extra long time to come. We heard that they have a small kitchen, but the table next to us got their food well before we did when they were seated a half hour after us. Our server was friendly, but he never really checked up on us. I understand the casual laidback 'hipster' atmosphere and certainly wasn't expecting fancy shmancy service, but it seemed like many of the servers had a 'did not care' attitude and/or were drunk. The server for a table next to us constantly came back and had to be reminded of what they wanted and seemed ultra aloof. This could all be remedied by their apparent stellar food, but that was such a disappointment. Almost everything was mad salty, especially their fries and catfish. I got the Chicago style tofu sandwich with mashed potatoes. The potatoes were meh. The sandwich was decently tasty and I enjoyed the giardiniera. However, one sad little tofu steak was swallowed by the hefty focaccia. The only positive thing was the black bean tostadas as those were very good. Everything else was barely average.

They should probably take people's numbers and text them when their tables are ready. There simply isn't room for people to wait. I was appreciative of the table because we were quoted a longer wait than what we actually had.  There were so many menu items that looked amazing, but my lovely boyfriend ended up agreeing to just split two vegetarian-friendly entrees that looked equally appetizing. We shared the pepita scramble and the green monster sandwich. Both were delicious, but I thought the pepita scramble was the standout. It was balanced with greens, potatoes, eggs, and veggies. I felt like eating that entire myself instead of sharing, but I was able to control myself. The green monster, which is a goat cheese sandwich, was a little disappointing. Even though it was filled with dark leafy greens, which is fantastic, I was sad that I could barely even taste the goat cheese. At one point I even opened it and took a look inside to make sure there was any goat cheese at all! My boyfriend agreed with my sentiments; the pepita scramble was the clear winner. I highly recommend trying it!  There were a lot of other menu items that looked veeeeeery appetizing, so I'm sure I'll be back at some point. I would like to give Handlebar five stars, but it sits at a comfortable four stars because of the scrimping on the goat cheese.

Then we decided to go somewhere else so we could sit together, and then they changed their minds (or didn't want to lose the business) so they said they had a table for 6, but they had 1 woman sitting there eating a sandwich but she'll be done in 5 minutes. That 5 minutes turned into 20 and then another 20 until they eventually just sat us at another table that was big enough and outside.

The mushrooms were sliced thick and had plenty of flavor - clearly not the oft-used canned variety.  The drawbacks. *The service was discombobulated, nearly disoriented, when it came to the logistics of turning over tables and seating the constant stream of new customers.

2015-03-02,4.0,"Handlebar is the perfect go-to neighborhood place.  They have a different special every day of the week, the the decor is fun to stare at for hours, and the servers are great.  This weekend I had my first brunch experience.  I'd give it a 5 star review for brunch alone, but I've struck out with dinners a little.  I ordered the diablos (with eggs and cheese) along with a side of biscuits and gravy.  Quick aside: I haven't eaten meat in 10 years and there are certain meals I thought I would never get  the opportunity to try...so my heart jumped with joy at the chance to try biscuits and gravy for the first time! So freaking good...almost as good as the diablos.  They include a hefty amount of this absolutely perfect chipotle sauce (with just the right amount of kick to it).  My only real complaint was how full I was by the end of my meal! Also: serious bonus points to the server/host on making sure to continually update people waiting...best brunch host I've ever seen!! I've also had dinner here 3 or so times.  There are plenty of options, but I feel like I've struck out a little.  The first time I had them, I ordered the fish tacos take out...they just didn't hold up well, even though I live really close.  Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but I wouldn't order that as carry-out ever again.  The second time I ate in the restaurant and got the avocado tacos.  That's probably my favorite thing I've gotten from there: very tasty and unlike anything I normally order.  The third time I tested my luck with carry-out again and ordered the buffalo chicken wrap.  If you like spicy food, you'll love it, but it was wayyyy too strong for me...pass the ranch dressing! However: there is one dinner menu item that is pure perfection: the mac and cheese.  I've also stolen bites of the chili mac and could eat that goodness all day. I haven't lived in the area long enough to experience the patio, but it looks like the perfect patio for happy hour or Sunday Funday drinking...if the weather ever warms up!",0.9965,0.729,0.205,0.066,0.5747962247962249

I was impressed. We came on a Saturday night around 8pm and the restaurant was full with a good 30 minute wait before we got seated. The ambiance of the restaurant is definitely of the Wicker Park variety with a little angst and soft lit candlelight.  For food, we ordered the nachos with chorizo seitan, polenta and sweet potato tots, bbq chicken seitan wrap, and blackened catfish with chili and greens. The good held its own and if I didn't know any better, I would've thought it was normal meat. Actually, I've had normal meat that tasted worse than this in restaurants so Handlebar has definitely changed my stance on vegetarian food. All of the food was seasoned and cooked well. The chorizo seitan in the nachos didn't make me miss ground beef one bit. The chili was so so tasty and the greens were cooked perfectly and seasoned just with garlic and salt. It was simple yet delicious. Obviously we over ordered a bit but I'm glad I tried everything that we did.  I would encourage everyone to come here and try some of their dishes with open minds and you'll probably come out having more appreciation for vegetarian/vegan dishes like me!",0.9944,0.759,0.209,0.032,0.5983516483516484

We were placed in the elevated seating area adjacent to the bar and our server immediately took our orders. Our party shared fried pickles and French toast as appetizers. The pickles were addictive and the my friend and I wished that they served them in French fry quantities. Following with French toast was perfect since it wasn't too sweet and came crispy while topped with fresh berries. For my main dish I had the vegan style pepita scramble. Damn good. The kale and tofu provided for a hearty dish while the onion petals added a tasty crunch. Also loved that the dish packed some good heat. Only complaint is that the potatoes looked a bit lifeless but that wasn't a big issue. Service here is friendly and my friends all enjoyed their dishes.

The diablos vegan w/blackened tofu are ridiculous...they come on homemade tostones, covered in chipotle sauce w/black beans, avocado & chorizo seitan. I'm not a big fake meat girl so would skip this in future, but otherwise this thing was where it's at. If you want a variation of this for dinner, order the black bean tostadas w/blackened tofu.

2014-11-03,5.0,"Remember the food you liked when you were a kid? There's a Dairy Queen near the corner of 73rd and Taft Street in Merrillville, Indiana, and all through high school and college, I'd go there and get a sloppy joe. Oh boy, was that thing good. Big fresh bun, and a huge pile of sloppy, messy, delicious meat. It was fantastic. I loved it. In the intervening years, I became a vegetarian. When I drove by that Dairy Queen, I'd think of that sloppy joe with fondness, but I never went in. What, me eat dead animals? Not a chance.  My friend Jean suggested we go for dinner at Handlebar. I knew Handlebar's reputation, but had never visited. Before agreeing to go, I checked out the menu online. I zeroed in on one item -- they had a sloppy joe. It was made from ""carne de soya."" A taste memory filled me mouth. OK, Jean, Handlebar it is! Although located perilously close to the hipster heaven of Wicker Park, we were able to find free parking on North Avenue. Granted, we went on a Monday night, but hey -- first impressions count.  Entering the restaurant, we saw a bar off to the right, and about half the tables were occupied. We stood at the entrance, taking the lay of the land for a minute, and giving all those oh-so-young diners an opportunity to wonder why two age 50+ women were there. A host greeted us and said, do you prefer to eat indoors or outdoors? This was the Monday in late October where the daytime temperature had reached 73 degrees. We sat outside, under a canopy. It's a very pleasant space. Since it's in back of the restaurant, there are no car or bus fumes to swallow along with your dinner. Quieter, too.  We each had a glass of red wine. Sorry, I can't tell you what kind, but we both were happy. Then, the main course. When my carne de soya sloppy joe arrived, it looked right. It smelled right. I had added avocado to it, for an extra cost, because I thought it would be the perfect fit with a spicy sloppy joe. This sandwich was fantastic. It fulfilled all my dreams. It was everything my 17-year-old self had enjoyed, and which I had craved ever since. Messy, hot, spicy, delicious. My mouth is watering for it right now.  I chose a side order of garlic mashed potatoes, and it was scrumptious. Jean had a vegetable stir-fry that was a special that night. She enjoyed it. It looked good, and I'll try to load a photo of it. She was very, very happy with her meal. It wasn't a sloppy joe, so I don't really care. Very satisfied, very happy, comfortably full, and oh so happy we came. We'll be back. I may even try something different on the menu. Well . . . maybe not for a while.

2014-09-12,2.0,"We moved to Chicago in February, and have been super excited about all the vegan options in this city. I heard amazing things about Handlebar from various people, vegan and not, and it has such good reviews here, that it was really high on my list of places to try.  We went a few weekends ago for lunch, and it was pretty damn disappointing. We tried the fried pickles, fried avocado tacos,  buffalo ""chicken"" wrap, and some oatmeal cookie dessert. The friend pickles were pretty terrible. We moved here from North Carolina, where there are a lot of very good fried pickles, so maybe I have high expectations. But these were super fried, so all you tasted was the batter- with no pickle goodness inside.  The Fried Avocado tacos were pretty boring. I really like the Baja Blackened Tacos at Native Foods, and these just didn't compare.  The Buffalo ""chicken"" wrap was similarly boring.

Mac was beyond phenomenal. We were happy as can be and asked for the bill.  That's when things flew off the handle. Hub and I wanted to pay our portion in cash and our friends wanted all their stuff on 1 credit card. Waiter dude took our $40 cash yet swiped friend's card for the whole damn bill. Umm, homey, wtf you thinking? #1, You don't deserve a $40 tip and #2, you clearly wiped your ass with my instructions. I bit my tongue, called him over, and explained the issue. He said he's sorry and would fix it. I control my breathing momentarily. He came back with the credit card swiped for only $10 less than previously. DUDE, now it's on.  I stood up and immediately walked to the bar because I couldn't wait another 15 min for him to make his rounds.

2014-07-30,4.0,"I'm in Chicago this week and had found out about Handlebar on Yelp when looking for Vegetarian/Vegan restaurants.  First of all, Handlebar has basically the coolest ambience/decorations ever. You walk in and are accosted by bright artworks and posters immediately, which add to the overall hip vibe. I sat out on the back patio because it was pretty nice out. The back patio has vines overhanging and is quaint and clean. The bathroom was clean and had some graffiti (none of which was offensive an actually added to the overall feel of the restaurant).  The service was pretty good, but it took a while to get our drinks and the check. The check probably took a while because it started to get quite busy as the lunch went on, so that's pretty understandable. Our server was perfectly nice and affable. The food itself is incredible. My group ordered the ancho-spiced veggie chili jack cheese fries to start and were pretty impressed. The fries were well done and crispy, but not oily whatsoever. The chili had a great robust smoky flavor with well-cooked beans scattered throughout. The cheese was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. The fries were a great vegetarian take on typical bar fare. I ordered the Chicago style tofu with fried plantains and my companions shared the sloppy joe with smoked gouda mac. The Chicago style tofu was incredibly fresh. The focaccia was chewy and thick, a supreme example of focaccia. The pesto tofu was blackened perfectly and had a great meaty texture. The vegetables (tomato, arugula, giardiniera) on the sandwich were fresh and slightly sweet. The dijon and garlic aioli added the perfect kick and smoothness to the sandwich. I didn't try the fried plantains, because I don't really like fried plantains due to their texture and thought when ordering that they would be plantain chips. This was just a misstep in my judgement though. I also ordered a Mexican Coca Cola, which I've been dying to try. It was a thousand times fresher and much more natural tasting than American Coca Cola. You could for sure taste the difference and the bottle was so cute. I much prefer it to American Coca Cola. The bite of sloppy joe I had was delicious and had a classic sloppy joe flavor, without any of the meat. The smoked gouda mac had kind of a thin sauce and was a bit bland, but the delicious smoked flavor was there for sure. Overall Handlebar has fresh, flavorful food that utilizes some very creative ideas (blackened tofu!) and is fairly priced. It's in a great location and has great ambience. It's a great place for any vegan or vegetarian (or anyone looking for fresh, flavorful food). The service could be a tiny bit better, but overall it's a solid place with intriguing food.",0.9994,0.72,0.271,0.009,0.6001709401709401

I find myself, every time, looking over the menu, and wishing something really interesting stood out, and wishing the prices made a bit more sense.

I also don't like that they have the boring sides for 'free' like french fries or collards, or you can get the ""Premium"" sides for additional fees on top of your expensive sandwich.

So I checked it out on my own time one night and I am so infatuated with their food/drinks/pricing. I usually get the buffalo chicken wrap but I've deviated from that a few time with appetizers. Samosas, chips & guac...so delicious. Seriously though, do yourself a favor and get that buffalo chicken wrap if you need a suggestion. The restaurant is small but usually isn't too terribly crowded, even during peak times. Wait staff is attentive enough- exactly what you want. Drinks are sooo cheap.

We were looking for a quick veg bite and saw great Yelp reviews so decided to give it a shot.  Looks unassuming from the exterior, kinda dive-ish, but has an outdoor patio which I'm sure brightens up the place in the summer.  Step inside and instantly greeted by welcoming wait staff. Chill relaxed interior, music not overwhelming or distracting, I think Joy Division was playing, set the vibe just right. Definitely more comfortable than it looks from the outside.  Menu is a veg treat! I was torn between at least 4 different items and settled for the Chili Mac and Cheese. So delish, a perfect dish to warm up my winter chill, and portioned enough that I was able to bring some home as a snack for later. Also got the Hat and Gloves cocktail, a perfect complement to my savory winter dish. The bf's dinner and cocktail was just as delicious.

2013-12-12,4.0,"Handlebar, you are AWESOME. The art on your walls is fantastic, your atmosphere is cozy and fun, and your food is wonderful. Which brings me to my question of the day: Why do so many vegetarian spots try to imitate meat with weird tempeh dishes when all they have to do is fry some pickles, put gouda on mac and cheese, and make a delicious black bean maduros?  Having grown up a vegetarian, I really hate vegetarian spots that come up with unnatural and overly-""healthy"" dishes. No, I don't want quinoa with my tempeh on flax seed bread, thank you very much! Handlebar is definitely a different breed of vegetarian restaurant. First of all, Handlbar still serves fish, which I really appreciate. I know fish is not a sustainable food, but it IS a yummy food! And many vegetarians eat fish. Secondly, Handlebar doesn't try to compensate for the lack of meat by adding soy (and other such products) to every dish. They do have quite a few seitan, tempeh, and tofu options, but for the most part Handlebar is happy to serve straight up avocado tacos and veggie chili. I definitely recommend the black bean maduros and fried pickles.  Handlebar also has a pretty good beer and cocktail selection. And for those of you, like me, who are freezing from the evil Chicago winter, check out the spiked cider. It's not particularly strong, but it'll warm you up in no time!

My friend & I walked in to have brunch this past  weekend, and were pleasantly surprised to be seated rather quickly, considering it is usually packed for brunch service. There was a bit of a delay with our server showing up, but after waving someone down, she arrived. We ordered & had more than an hour to spend, before we had to leave for an appointment. Our order was a simple no-brainer. 2x eggs, toast & potatoes. Our coffee came first & was tasty - what one would expect. Then my breakfast came, poached eggs, toast, and I had asked to sub broccoli for the potatoes. No problem. I started eating, so my food wouldn't get cold, and shared some with my friend while she waited for hers to come. It didn't come. Ever. After a good 20 minute wait, I again had to wave down the server, who was not very available - and ask where the other order was (WE ORDERED THE SAME THING!!!) - she said 'the kitchen messed up the order', and they'll fix it right away........... finally, after another 20-30 minutes, I had to wave down a different server all together, and asked for a manager - there apparently wasn't one available. REALLY?! too hipster for management, I guess. Which is too bad, because this place desperately needs some! We waited.....and waited.....and I finished my meal, and we still waited.....and the server just never bothered to come back. So ONCE again, we waved her down, and she came to say she was checking on the order. We saw table after table get their food - and they were a lot more complicated orders than EGGS, TOAST, & POTATOES. WTH, Handlebar?! How on earth do you deal with a full house, dozens of orders, one on top of the next, when you can't even get a simple order out on time - with another one that's identical???!!! Needless to say, we were livid at this point. And if your point was to make sure that we don't come back - consider yourself 'mission accomplished'! And if you chose (which really you did) - to make sure our order was f*ed up, so we wouldn't come back because we weren't obvious hipsters with multiple tattoos, a ratty sock hat, military jacket, doc martin boots, and a full beard - well....you made your choice - a shitty, judgmental, biased choice - and for that you got no tip. And now you'll have this review to deal with, and we'll make sure all our friends never come back.

They said it's an ounce and a half drink. Ohkaaaayyyyy! I thought an ounce and a half was a shot. Why not charge shot prices or make it bigger like every other bar? If you want a great Old Fashioned, go to the Matchbox.  So, because of their lack of receptivity to criticism, I decided not to remark on anything else. Unfortunately, the tone was set for the night, right out of the gates. Many times, the food can speak for itself and sort of make up for weird service, but it didn't on this occasion.  Here is my take on the food.  Nachos- chips were really stale. I guess that queso means cheez whiz. Also, I shouldn't have assumed that vegan/vegetarian means healthy.  Beet salad- that was decent. The horseradish dressing becomes too overpowering to finish the dish, though. (Lady Gregory's in Andersonville makes the best beet salad!!!)  Gouda mac and cheese- Excellent!!! Oatmeal cream pie with a side of ice cream- I could taste the salt in the oatmeal cookie. The cream in the middle tasted like butter. Why not leave the salt out of the cookie and make a vegan butter cream frosting? The $2 side of ice cream looked like it was scooped with a tablespoon and maybe measured 2 tablespoons. The waiter who was unreceptive to the drink issue, asked me how the dessert was, while looking into the ice cream dish. I lied and said it was great. Why? Because when you give honest feedback to a restaurant and they put it back on you, you don't want them to think you're all critical about everything. It's a small kitchen and I'd hate to think that they'd do anything to my food. I'm not saying they'd do that, but their reaction to the drink made me feel that they wouldn't care about what happened to my food.",0.9627,0.799,0.123,0.077,0.5465659340659341
2013-10-03,1.0,"To paraphrase Dr. Phil, you can be right - that an Old Fashioned is *technically* only an ounce and a half; or you can have a happy customer and actually fill the tiny little glass it came in. My Old Fashioned was three sips, not even kidding.  The glass they brought it in was only 2/3 full, and it was a tiny little glass.  At this point, I question if it even was an ounce and a half.  You chose to be right (although you weren't - see below).  You clearly don't want me as a returning customer, no need to worry about that. The fact that *two* waitstaff had a response to my complaint on the tip of their tongue leads me to believe that I'm not the only person who's complained, and they have their response at the ready.  Just a suggestion, if you have to have a response to customer complaints pre-prepared, maybe, just maybe, you should actually listen instead of trying to be right.  Also, since it's only an ounce and a half and some sugar (not how you make an Old Fashioned, BTW) why are you charging me cocktail prices - $9 - instead of shot prices? More I think about it, more I think you guys suck.  Food was okay, but the drink and the cheese whiz on the nachos sort of set the tone.

Favorite items: Fried Pickles w/ Vegan Ranch - The cornmeal breading was crisp and not at all mushy like many fried pickles and the vegan ranch was honestly better than any regular ranch I've had. Very zesty and garlic-y. Ground Nut Stew - This is great in the winter. A GIGANTIC bowl of a delicious sweet, spicy (healthy) stew. Add just a little salt and you're good to go. Tuna Sandwich - simply tasty. They have great options for sides, too. The fried plantains are pretty good. I come here for brunch mainly - can't go wrong with eggs. The Diablo dish is very tasty with corn cakes that are like sopes. Drinks - all kinds of tasty drinks. Splurge for the Trifecta - It's a glass of guinness with a shot of espresso and a shot of Jameson. Delicious. It is perfect for brunch, and the Jameson sort of fades into the background leaving you with a nutty, coffee/beer combo that just wins.

Grabbed brunch here last weekend with a friend.  It's always wait to be seated so far as I can tell, but the place is small enough that everything is visible (except the back patio).  Host told us there was a chance of rain so we opted to stay inside.  Got the pepitas scramble with eggs and a slice of french toast.  The pepitas scramble is fine, it has kale, poblano peppers, red bell peppers, crispy fried onions, and sweet potatoes scrambled with either eggs or tofu and topped with a pesto of some sort.  The pesto was actually great; I wish the dish came smothered with pesto instead of dabs.  The rest of it tastes like something I'd make at home for brunch on a weekend, not pay someone else to make for me.  Comes with toast (ours was not toasted...) and breakfast potatoes (a little dry). French toast was pretty yummy but not amazing.   Went again for lunch today, thought we'd have a quick lunch to start the workweek.  There were a few tables there which seems like a good sign.  I love hipsters, but the service here is hipster if you know what I mean.  We ordered immediately- the pepitas again (thought we'd try it with tofu this time) and the Monday special of Chili Mac Attack!- the smoked gouda mac n cheese that yelp loves, topped with chili, tortilla chips, sour cream, salsa.  Pepitas was just as disappointing as the first time (I was hoping for soft tofu but it comes with extra firm cubes that are sauteed), and the chili mac, while a great concept, didn't quite work: the chili and mac seem good separately, but the mac isn't cheesy/strong enough to complement the chili.   Honestly I like the mac at Mac's better (add spinach and tomato, yum!) or the Bedford (onion breadcrumbs).  Wish I loved handlebar more; the vibe is awesome, but the food/service aren't.",0.9985,0.727,0.249,0.024,0.5118355481727574

The host will ask you to wait until your whole party has arrived -- even when the place is empty (this must be a policy, but sometimes common sense and logic should take the place of a policy).   It's a little uncomfortable waiting by the front, I wish they would were more accommodating here, first impressions go a long way.    The food and drinks will make up for any bad first impression!  I really do love eating here!",0.9568,0.78,0.148,0.072,0.5442757534862798

The host, waitress & busser couldn't have been nicer. The interesting menu was aimed very much toward vegan, vegetarian or non-red-meat eaters, which makes sense as a Wicker Park bicyclist place.  I didn't have any food here, though I noticed someone at the other end of our very long table had guacamole and chips.  I saw that the plate was practically licked clean, so it must have been good.  On the other hand, these were hungry actors after a show.",0.8911,0.869,0.095,0.036,0.5439999999999998

Some of the staff are way too ""hip"" to give a shit that you are there to support their business. I met some friends here who were seated on the patio (which is in the back and pretty great) for a birthday gathering. The patio was closing, so we moved inside and grabbed a table right across from the bar. I don't know what was supposed to happen with our waiter, but he never came back and we never got a new one. I had to ask a busboy for a menu after a half hour and still no one came over, even though I saw, other tables being waited on by a gal who would look directly at us, I swear, and then turn away and keep chatting with her co-workers. So I ordered a drink at the bar. I don't remember which drink, it was a house special I believe, but it tasted like watered-down whiskey. Luckily when I took it back up, the bartender replaced it for free.  I will give props to one skinny dude who waited on us once. We decided, at his urging, to try the $1 malort shots, which I have heard described as tasting like rubber bands and rusty nails. It was pretty gross, not as bad as I expected, but fun to try a Chicago original. Anyway, he was down-to-earth and fun to chat with.  I also went for brunch once. I really only remember the biscuits and gravy, which were whole wheat and more of a turkey gravy (but vegan, with seitan) which is not what I expect from biscuits and gravy, whole wheat is fine, but I want a creamy gravy. One friend graciously finished his, saying it was ""not bad"" but another just picked at his and thought it was gross.  But the vegetarian chili cheese fries are good.  I'll go back only if a good friend is going and asks that I join, but never again of my own volition.",0.9962,0.766,0.196,0.038,0.48866728509585655

2013-01-01,4.0,"Just came back from New Years Day brunch, and was thoroughly impressed.  We were sat after a minimal wait, which is always made easier by the presence of a bar (with bloody mary's!). The bloody was pretty standard and nothing to write home about, but it was a good ""hair of the dog"" to start the day with.  The food, however, was WELL worth noting and definitely warrants re-visiting. I got the vegan diablos breakfast, it was the perfect amount of spicy (i.e. enough to wake up your taste buds, but not enough to make you cry and spout a runny nose). The black beans and brown rice that came with were porportioned well and perfect side kicks for the main dish. It was also filling enough that I had left overs, which is basically unheard of, as I enjoy over-eating as much as most people enjoy breathing. Anyway, my boyfriend got the portabella omelet, which was made with fresh ingredients and came with some toast and breakfast potatoes. He said it was awesome. I cannot comment on the taste of the omelette myself, as I was neck deep in a food fantasy swimming through delicious chipotle sauce, and dense masa cakes.  While our waiter didn't stay around and chat, he was efficient, and very quick and friendly. We waited no more than ten minutes for our breakfast, despite it being was very busy.

2012-11-20,1.0,"First I must note this review is solely about the service received and nothing else. We arrived at the Handlebar late Sunday morning on November 18,  to a short line which included a couple waiting inside the door and a family waiting outside.  So we walk up to the door and notice there is a guy taking names for a waiting list.  Well we hear him tell the couple ahead of us it will take about 15 minutes.  At almost the same time the family that was waiting outside walks up behind us and the waiter walks between us with no acknowledgement at all that we were in line and proceeds to take the families cancellation.  He then walks back between us without one single word and walks away.  We see him walking around the restaurant serving food, taking orders to the kitchen etc.  I look at my boyfriend and say is he really ignoring us.  We give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for a few minutes.  Well during our wait a guy comes in and walks between us since we were standing in the doorway.  The same waiter makes a beeline over to him and asks for his name and tells him it will be a 15 minute wait.  I say to both of them we were here first.  The customer was gracious and apologized.  The waiter proceeds to take his name anyway.  He then asks for our name and tells us it will be a 1/2 hour wait and that we could sit at the bar if we want to. Now I am the person who gives everyone the benefit of the doubt even when I know people are rude.  This guy sucked!!!!  And while we were the only black people in the place at the time I refrained from going there as I truly want to still believe 'he' was just an F'in A'hole.  For the record, the guy at the bar was awesome and friendly and provided great service.  Thank God for him we will go back because my boyfriend is vegan and loved the food but if I see that guy again I probably won't be so nice.  I will take the opportunity and make the biggest seen ever and then call the police myself.",0.9749,0.879,0.098,0.023,0.4188311688311689

Well Handlebar delivers a casual atmosphere, a small yet sophisticated beer menu, and food choices that preference vegetarian offerings. I was impressed with the continuum of beer choices that spans typical stuff (e.g., Guinness) to more obscure finds (e.g., Three Floyds Robert the Bruce) all accomplished with only about 8 or so taps. They might be missing out on being able to hit everyone's palates this way, but hopefully it will push people to try something they might not try if offered more choices. Lots of stuff on the menu sounded good and I ended up splitting the sambal tofu and a salad special. The waitress warned us that the sambal tofu was spicy which heightened my expectations for what would come. Although there definitely was a kick it's not a dish I think needs to come with a warning.

2012-10-13,2.0,"I was underwhelmed by Handlebar. After seeing Yelpers rate it a 4 and hearing from my friend that it was highly recommended to him, I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately, it didn't wow me enough to want to come back. Our table was right by the front door, so I might as well have left my coat on as it was a chilly morning. The table was also so cramped with the one behind it that we had to physically move the table so that there would be enough room for me to sit down.  Brunch is my favorite meal of the day and my main issue is typically whittling down the list of everything that looks good on the menu to my final selection. Here it turned out that the only thing that stood out were the biscuits and gravy. The gravy had a great flavor but I learned I'm not a fan of Seitan sausage - I'm not vegetarian but I am totally willing to try new things, that just didn't hit the spot for me. On the bright side, the spiked apple cider was delicious and was the perfect drink to warm me up considering the rain and cold.  What surprised me most was the service. Our waitress was barely around and not friendly. The gentleman ""greeting"" new guests kept telling the two-party groups that they could ""sit at any of the small tables up here or sit at the bar."" I finally realized he was trying to save the 4-person tables for groups larger than 2, but why not just show people to an open table? Wouldn't that be easier than having to move people when they choose the wrong table? Probably not going to be on my list to revisit.",0.9553,0.833,0.114,0.053,0.6199668499668499

Let's hope that the Sambal Tofu that I ordered is magnitudes healthier than IPAs and fries.  The kale, collard greens, broccoli, and green beans were all cooked such that they were still crunchy (because who likes mushy vegetables, anyway?).  The sambal (a chili-based sauce) was much milder than I expected, but didn't prevent me from enjoying dinner.  In fact, after resuming my horrific and disgusting eating habits later that week, I found myself craving Sambal Tofu. As for the atmosphere, it's loud and the tables are on top of one another.  The artwork that adorns the wall is really interesting; most of it pays homage to bike culture (for example, the iconic Cycles Gladiator poster). Try not to be seated by the door - unless you like keeping your coat on during dinner and enjoy random bursts of cold air every time someone enters and leaves the restaurant (which was pretty much happening on a continuous basis because it was so crowded).",0.9622,0.797,0.148,0.055,0.532967032967033
2012-07-09,1.0,"My vegetarian friend's birthday was last week, and so she chose Handlebar for some dinner - she had heard great things (and so had I) and was very excited. We were a group of 7, so we sat on the patio even though it was sweltering, which was not a big deal because we wanted to sit sooner rather than later. I am not sure if our waitress was having a bad night, or if we offended her in some secret way, but she was pretty much rude to us from the get go. It took forever for water to arrive, and then another long while for her to come to our table. We had one question about drinks and we seemed to exasperate her. We let her know we were celebrating a birthday, and another friend asked if there was anything they could do for her birthday. She said, ""Uh no, this isn't Applebee's."" Whoa. We were all a bit shocked by this... I've been to plenty of upscale/local restaurants and bars who bring out some dessert or something. We weren't asking for singing and confetti.. just a little surprise. Throw us a bone here.   We should have just left then. But no, we stuck it out.. another girl with us has a nut allergy, and so she asked if the whole grain bread had nuts in/on it. Our server replied, ""It's whole grain bread... so yes."" Again, we were kind of shocked with the tone, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world. Another friend politely informed her that she had a nut allergy. to which the server replied ""Fine, I get it. We do have sourdough you know."" No, we didn't know, that's why we asked. It was just so strange the way she talked to us, like we were idiots invading her home or something.  I'm not sure what the deal was, an off night or something, but we felt really bad for our friend whose birthday we were trying to celebrate.",0.4467,0.799,0.098,0.103,0.5581111111111112

He ordered a couple beers and I went with a Hibiscus Mint Tea Cooler.  We went with Samosas as our appetizer. Average. The pockets were a tad hardened and tough to cut into. Flavor was decent, but nothing special.  I ordered the Avocado Tacos and was not disappointed. The tacos were filling and loaded with texture. The cabbage slaw and lightly fried avocado gave the dish a fresh crisp flavor. But lets talk about that green rice side. Under or over cooked, the rice was hard and virtually flavorless; a bit of a letdown considering how delicious the main dish was. My boyfriend went with the Chard special served on a bed of couscous, which was also loaded with texture and flavor.  We splurged, and ordered the Plantain's Foster for dessert. Again, average. The plantain's we pretty darn good, but the ginger cake it was paired with was incredible dry and in my opinion did not compliment the flavor of the fruit.  Bottom line: I will definitely be back for dinner, minus starters and dessert. The menu is wide and innovative and I look forward to trying something new.

2012-03-29,2.0,"Years ago, this was my in-hood go-to vegetarian spot, and if it was summer and I had a club night to run, I'd bring the headlining touring artists / DJs here for a pre-show nosh out on the patio accompanied by some leisurely-imbibed beverages. These music types I seem to bring in always seem to be food nerds, and this consistently proved to be a safe bet. It's one of those restaurants where you aren't limited by the three-way choice between the salad, some pasta dish, and a DIY flight of sides.  Also, they take their booze seriously and their craft beer menu is fairly solid. So....fast forward a few years (last month) and my boy and I pop in for brunch on a Sunday to casually run some ideas between us before we head out for another adventure. Yes, the place is loud with all that sound bouncing around on hard surfaces, but the tables are small enough where you can hear your companion,  which might be partially due to the fact that most people are nursing a hangover and just don't yell anyway.  Then the weirdness then begins to set in.The table on our left is clearly full of newly-emigrated Trixies from Lincoln Park passively demanding validation from each other and then loudly encouraging all at the table to share some fattening and AMAZING desert selection. A woman is struggling to push a baby carriage through the double doors at the entrance only to awkwardly stumble upon a serpentine queue with this high-tech stroller outfitted with a suspension system fit for an off-road vehicle. My companion and I order our meals, he this crab-cake via black bean riff that's one of the specials of the day, and I a BBQ seitan (wheat gluten pulled in a certain way to resemble the stringy-ness of pork) sandwich, with a side of their smoked Mac n' Cheese, for max-sharing action. Well, my BBQ sandwich had RAW red onions and an impossibly crusty bread. First, red raw onions work best when they provide a bit of bite, texture, and color in mostly raw dishes: wraps, salads and the like. But we're talking BBQ here, and there needs to be some cooking of those guys. Those onions should be caramelized, providing sweetness and texture and just a hint of bite and softer texture.. But please no! Don't carmelize red onions. When you cook them they turn this hideous purple brown color that is just sickening to look at. I think Handlebar tried to combine their super ""freshie vegan wrap"" mentality with BBQ pork and ... no. I just ended up eating the M&C--which I really wish they threw under the broiler for a few minutes to get that nice crust of baked cheese. Next up, the extremely-crusty bread. Do you realize that biting into two pieces of wood with slimy stuff in the middle basically forces all the gooey insides out of the other end? This is basic fluid dynamics, people. Come on, chefs: pretend you're on a date. Do you want to look like a slob in front of your date and then go home alone and cry for 5 hours with a painfully loofah-ed mouth rubbed raw by your out- of-control rock/bread? I tried my boy's ""black bean crab cakes."" You've got to be kidding me. Fish is a delicate flavor and texture, which you'd probably want to go chasing after variations on soft tofu to get something analogous to happen. Black beans are so not it. Good god. Tasteless, mealy, bland, and nothing like fish. *Sigh* Vegan (and vegetarian) does not have to be disappointing. It can be extremely awesome and creative. For instance, Karyn's on Green has spoiled me, I think. I remember leaning back from an ""omelet"" I had there one morning and just blabbering adjectives about how delicious it was. Karyn knows what she's doing, and how to do it right and consistently. Went there for dinner and ate vegan sliders and time slowed down while I slowly noshed down a teeny appetizer.  Do you see what I'm saying? Yes, Handlebar is hip and fun (and the bike-friendliness with the bike racks outside and bike-details within, like the bar stools made from rims) and has an inclusive menu, but just a few tweaks in standards here and there and they could have the hipster-bar equivalent of something along the lines of Karyn's.

There are lots of goodies on the menu here. I have come here with meat eating friends, who always left satisfied as well. I love their sandwich options. They have some delicious sides available too. Amazing beer selection, and the waiters have always been wise with their suggestions for me when I've been undecisive about what beer I wanted to sip on during my meal. I have been here every time of the day - lunchtime on a weekday, evening on a weekend and everything in between. The atmosphere is always young, hip and laid back.  It has been my go-to for several first dates, and would reccomend it as a laid back place to sit in and have a conversation in. The menu is affordable without being cheap, as cheap comes with obvious connotations about quality. The Handlebar has always had high quality food for me, which looks good on a date as well. Their kitchen staff must be extremely dedicated to the presentation and quality of the food, as well. My sprouts are always fresh-off-the-farm stand crunchy, my avocado is always creamy and perfect and unblemished, my bread always tastes like it was pulled out of the oven that morning, and the fries are always crisp and fresh. The sandwiches look downright stacked, stuffed with contents, you could photograph any single sandwich that comes out of their kitchen and run it as a magazine ad without needing to retouch it at all. It is a big deal to me, as I have gone to restaurants with nice pics on their website of their food, only to find their sandwiches flat and squished-down looking in person. The Handlebar has been consistently awesome with every visit.  Thanks Handlebar. If I ever win the lottery I will make sure I open a Handlebar location next door to me.

I am not a vegetarian by any means but once in a while you know. Although I am looking to become one again. (yes again) At least pescatarian w a side of vegetarian.  Anyway, i read another review about the unfriendly service and i dint experience that whatsoever. I mean the hostess wasnt overly friendly or anything but she was semi-hospitable. So i ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and again I am by no means a vegetarian so im not even familiar w the terms etc. (well kind of) Whatever it was made of it did not taste anything like chicken but it was tasty. I think maybe it was falafel w wing sauce on it. I wasnt crazy about the sauce, it was tangy w a spice and stuff but i never was a sauce guy.(again i guess it was like a chicken wing sauce) But it wasnt bad for being pretend a chicken falafel wrap thingie.  But the side of garlic smashed potatoes were AAAwsome w a capital A. (a nice healthy side too...enough for two people) very Garlicky w Scallion pieces chopped on top. Very Yummy.    Oh and their to-go boxes were interesting little brown things. that looked like chinese take out but not really. The atmosphere seemed pretty laid back but it was 12 noon so i dont know. Decor was Coffee Shoppe w a twang. All in all i would def go back cause my curiosity would like to try so many other things. Plus I definitely wanna try a veggie burger.  If you visit HB def get you some Garlic Smashed Potatoes and stay away from your lover for a while cause its probably best.

2012-01-22,4.0,"We arrived a little after 7 pm on a Saturday night and the small restaurant/bar was full. There were just two small tables against the east wall available so we were seated right away. Within 5 minutes we ordered a cocktail. I had the special which on Sat. is a $5 margarita served rocks in a pint glass. I'm pretty picky about margarita's and this one passed the test. My partner in crime had an Allagash White.  For our appetizer we split an order of the fried pickles because I had read so many raves here on Yelp. Yelpers, I would like to thank you! They were so deelish we almost ordered another for dessert! They are housemade and the cucumbers are just lightly pickled and the perfect crisp texture for frying. It seems they have a cornmeal style batter and are flash fried because they were so light, crisp and not at all greasy. They come with a vegan ranch for dipping and the texture/flavor is so grand it's hard to believe there's no dairy in there.  For the entree I had the blackened catfish which was served piping hot, moist, sweet, delicate & perfectly seasoned. The blackening spices had just the right amount of heat and flavor without overwhelming the mild fish. I loved it and wouldn't have changed a thing. It comes with two sides and again after reading so many raves I had to go with the smoked gouda mac. Once more, the majority of yelpers got it right! The smokey creamy gouda and firm macaroni were a dream and perfect companion to the fish. For the second side I felt I had to get something green so I went with the collard greens. These were a miss for me as they were not as tender as I like and they were served cold. They were very chewy and bitter probably becasue they weren't cooked as much as I like. I would go with the broccolli next time. My cohort ordered the fish tacos which looked very fresh and tasty with big slices of avocado resting on top. He said they were excellent.  Handlebar is a small room and the crowd is mostly young hipster/bike messenger types. It sounded like they had an old sub-pop compilation playing which I enjoyed. Tables are small and tightly packed together which is necessary in a room this size with the amount of people hungry to eat here. After we were seated there was a pretty steady stream with an average of four people waiting during our stay. We  took our time and didin't feel rushed or like they wanted to turn the table - we were comfortable. Service was steady and unobtrusive. We stayed and had a couple  drinks at our table and by the time we left there were plenty of places to sit. It seems people eat and head out to the bars/nightlife afterwards.  Our tab with 3 drinks each without tip was about $65 which is very reasonable in my book! We easily scored rockstar parking right in front. Summary: Take a dip in the pescetarian/vegetarian/vegan pool. I promise you won't be missing a thing at Handlebar!

Anyway, I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Omelette, a house coffee and one of their Sunday-Special $3 mimosas. The two other people in my company ordered the Biscuits and Gravy, and the Eggs, Potatoes & Toast. I highly recommend the Portobello Omelette to anyone seeking a heavier breakfast. It was decadent, which I suppose can yield mixed gastrological results depending on how much you've had to drink the night before. Overall, the omelette was very, very good. My only complaint is that the side breakfast potatoes on my dish were a little soggy. They had a nice flavor but seemed like they had been sitting out under a lamp for a while.  My friend let me try a bite of her Biscuits & Gravy and, I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews, for a vegan dish it was very, very good. The Seitan ""Sausage"" was creamy, surprisingly meaty and peppery-spicy in way that wasn't painful. I'm extremely sensitive to spicy food but I could tolerate it.

In spite of the sometimes intense heat, I still love it! The salad is a wonderful blend of arugula, pears, walnuts, parmesan cheese and a honey mustard dressing. It never fails to please. There are a number of other good items that we enjoy from time to time, but the afore mentioned are our favorites. The owner seems to enjoy finding good micro brews to serve. Although I am not sure if Three Floyds still qualifies a a micro brewery, this is where I first enjoyed a number of their offerings. The staff is generally quite friendly, though not always attentive. We do enjoy the outdoor patio in back. Unfortunately, sometimes a smoker will taint the experience.

2011-09-10,2.0,"I decided to have the Buffalo Chicken (not real chicken but seitan) wrap.  What is Seitan? Okay Wikipedia help!!! Wheat gluten, also called seitan, wheat meat, mock duck, gluten meat, or simply gluten, is a food made from the gluten of wheat. It is made by washing wheat flour dough with water until all the starch dissolves, leaving insoluble gluten as an elastic mass which is then cooked before being eaten! Thanks Wikipedia I'm not that hungry anymore!!! Not being Vegan but a huge meat lover. I decided to go for it!!!  The presentation of the wrap on the plate was really pretty.  So the moment of truth. I took a big bite and  you know that phrase, ""It Tastes like chicken!"" It does not apply here!!!  The first bite was not great.  I got the ranch dressing on the side and decided to pour it on top. That may have saved my meal and I hate ranch dressing.  I could see specks of red mixed into the dressing which tells me they spiced it up.  Now the reason for my two stars...the second half of my buffalo chicken wrap only contained vegetables. Yes I was literally missing my fake chicken...it had started to grow on me!!!  Complete laziness by the chef and unacceptable.  We were the only two customers in there. There was no rush...attention to detail is key here.  I kind of felt cheated as a customer!  I was a little shocked as I took bites...hoping to find some buffalo seitan but I never did!!! The hit of this place is the Smoked Gouda Mac and cheese!!!  It deserves 5 stars. In fact, if I ever come back I am going to get a giant plate of it and one of there nice drink specials!!! Two everyday specials. $5 Tecate Can and Tequila Shot and $4 Highlife Pony and Malory shot.   What is Malort?  Wikipedia please rescue me once again: Malört, a distilled beverage, is the name of a Swedish style of schnapps called ""Bäska Droppar"", flavored with wormwood. The word malört is the Swedish word for the wormwood plant. The smell and taste is musty and extremely bitter. Malört is popularly alleged to be a cure for indigestion.

2011-04-27,3.0,"3.5 stars.   The sandwiches are delicious.  On my first visit, the S.O. and I split the green meanie and the Chicago-style tofu.  The green meanie was fresh and the thin goat cheese layer added a nice flavor.  The Chicago-style tofu was very good.  The tofu was pressed to a thin layer I have never seen before, so much so that I kept forgetting I was eating a tofu sandwich.  The giardiniera was good but not overwhelming, which was beneficial as I don't generally like giardiniera.   The veggie chili is thick but satisfying on a cold day.  The plantains satisfied my craving, but weren't the best I have ever had.   On my second visit, I had the buffalo 'chicken' wrap, which didn't actually taste like buffalo sauce or meatless chicken I have had previously, but it was good.  I would order it again when I am craving a wrap, since most restaurants don't serve vegetarian-friendly wraps of substance.  On this visit, my friend ordered a special, which was essentially the black beans maduro entree on a torta.  It was good, but the amount of bread was overwhelming and my friend ended up removing one piece of the bread and turning it into an open-faced sandwich.  I would strongly recommend the black beans maduro entree on its own.   I was surprised that this place wasn't more of a bar, but rather more like a cafe that serves food and beer.  The tables are uncomfortably packed in, and they were busy both times I was there (Sunday afternoon, Tuesday evening).  I never felt like I could just chill with a drink, but rather that I needed to order and eat my food and clear space for the next patrons.   I'm very happy to have a pescatarian-friendly place where I can order everything on the menu without worrying if there is bacon or chicken hiding somewhere.  I just wish the vibe was less rushed and more linger-worthy.",0.9919,0.756,0.183,0.061,0.6006006493506493

It wasn't too crowded and I got a glass of water pretty quickly. I ordered the hibiscus-mint tea and a vegan breakfast burrito. It didn't take very long to get my food at all, and my server was very friendly. I've seen comments here about the service and while it wasn't lightning fast, I never felt ignored or unattended.  The hibiscus-mint tea is my new summer drink, hands down. Lightly sweet and slightly minty, it just tastes like summer in a glass. Their breakfast burrito came stuffed with fried potatoes, vegan chorizo, creamy avocado and fresh spinach leaves. The tortilla was toasted and a little flaky on the outside, but soft and pliant on the inside.  It came with a side of black beans and two kinds of salsa. The beans were simply just OK, leaning on the side of being slightly overcooked and undersalted. I didn't really need to eat too many of them because I was too busy making messy love to my burrito, which was so delicious I don't know why I'm not eating it every day. i was full when I finished it, but never felt weighed down or heavy like I'd feel if I had a more ""typical"" breakfast burrito with eggs, bacon, cheese, etc. Great experience at Handlebar, and I'm looking forward to another visit.",0.9873,0.851,0.138,0.012,0.47987525019783084

I dined at Handlebar on a busy weekend night with a party of three. We arrived at around 9 and were told there would be a half hour wait, but ended up being seated within 15-20 minutes. Our waiter was friendly and the service was prompt. I ordered the fish tacos (amazingly fresh catfish with red cabbage, ripe avocado, and tomatillo salsa) and was thrilled with my choice. The tacos had a great balance of textures and flavors and the sides were delicious. The portions were generous and the prices were moderate. (OK, it felt a little pricey, but I'm totally cheap and the food was amazing, so I assume that works out to ""moderate prices."") I don't normally order dessert, but ended up indulging in the fried PB&J pies -- two mini-empanadas filled with peanut butter and jelly. The pies were a little heavy on the PB vs. the J for my taste and ended up seeming a little heavy, but I bet I could have easily offset the heaviness by adding a scoop of ice cream, were it not for my aforementioned cheapskate nature.

I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. Vegetarian restaurants usually are a magnet for this type, especially ones located in such a prime ironic-handlebar-mustache-ugly sweater or flannel shirt-skinny jean-thick framed glasses-wearing-carry my bike helmet-neighborhood. But I'm not here to review hipsters, I'm here to review the restaurant... Handlebar had a lot of potential. The wife (a vegan-terian) and I were pretty pumped to try some of the things we saw on the menu while checking out the website. We got there (we drove in a car, not a fixie) and were seated right away.  Appetizer: We ordered fried pickles. They were ok, but nothing to write home about.  Entrees: We ordered the bbq seitan sandwich (with fries) and the buffalo chicken wrap (with the mac n cheese). The bbq seitan sandwich came out cold. Well, scratch that, a few of the chunks were luke-warm. So obviously, an attempt was made to serve the sandwich warm, but that attempt failed. So needless to say, the sandwich was a huge letdown. The fries, on the other hand, were pretty great.  The buffalo chicken wrap was slightly better (and warmer!). Unfortunately, it seemed as though only one piece of chicken made it into my wrap. Bummer. The mac n cheese was alright...nothing too special, but not too bad. It got cold really quickly though, so I felt that I needed to eat it kind of fast.  Service: ""Slow"" and ""Inattentive"" come to mind. We didn't order drinks, that might have been the problem? Who knows. It wasn't extremely busy when we were seated, but it took a while for the waiter to come around. The food came out pretty quickly, but our waters weren't refilled until after we got our check.

Sure, you won't find dishes that are as artfully arranged as Karyn's restaurants, or crazy experimentations with root vegetables, but that's not the point. The purpose of going to Handlebar is to get incredibly tasty, stick-to-your-ribs goodness in large portions at reasonable prices. The deep fried pickles? The best I've had, thanks to their cornmeal and chile exterior. The black bean maduros? Everyone else on here's covered them, so all I can say is go order them, shell out for the avocado, and enjoy. Also, they really aren't that spicy, at least if you're a spicy food fiend. So far, all of the specials I've tried have been superb, and their vegan fried pies are worth buying extra to take home. I'd give it five stars, but I'm a curmudgeonly Seattleite who thinks the music is too loud, the service a bit too laissez-faire, and the strength of their bloody Marys inconsistent.

The menu is large and diverse, and obviously I loved the vegetarian-friendly fare.  It was hard to choose, but my wife had the Roasted Beet and Spinach Salad with Blackened Tofu, I had the Buffalo ""Chicken"" Wrap with Smoked Gouda Mac N Cheese, and we split the Chili Cheese Fries. The Fries came out first and they were delicious.  The Chili was rich and filling and had a zesty flavor, the cheese was melted nicely, and it was a great appetizer-size portion.  My only complaint is that the fries could have been a little crispier, but that's tough to do when you douce them with chili and cheese.   The Buffalo Chicken Wrap was a treat, as I love fried chicken.  The buffalo sauce wasn't overpowering, and the vegan ranch added a nice, cool, refreshing flavor.  I would have liked a few more pieces of ""chicken"" in it, though.  The Mac N Cheese was out of this world-definitely worth the upcharge.  It was creamy-not baked-and the gouda added a smooth, smoky flavor.   My wife enjoyed her salad, which was presented nicely and large enough to be a complete entree.  She said it was pretty standard, but done well.  She also said the blackened tofu was well-seasoned.

From the second I saw our hipster waitress in a revolting crocheted sweater and granny glasses I knew I would be in for a sexy time explosion.   The black beans maduro were mind-bogglingly good.  The plaintains in them are cooked perfectly and the BBQ chipotle sauce was as hot as Ricky Martin in tight pants back when we all pretended that he was straight.  MUY CALIENTE!  The two folks with me both ordered the blackened catfish, gouda mac & cheese, and sesame broccoli.  Both were fully thrilled by their choices.  Our tostada appetizer was also spot-on delicious. Great meal.  Great service.  Great drinks (not very stiff, but delicious nonetheless).  Great in general. Will I be left pining over Handlebar when I leave Chicago in a few days?  Who knows, but I'm always excited to have a smoldering sexy sailor waiting for me in every port.   It was real, Handy.  See you soon.

Anyway, the Handlebar is truly great.  The black-bean/plantain cake thing was so good, I felt compelled to personally cite the chef for excellence in hipster cuisine.  She graciously accepted her honors, blushing slightly.

Well, it turns out that I'm officially allergic to wheat and gluten. When I added these two things back into my diet I had the worst migraine and my stomach just hated me. I called my doctor to see what was going on and he confirmed that I might be allergic to these two ingredients. He told me to keep them out of my diet for a while to see how I felt. So, instead of wheat and gluten I've been eating rice and whole grains and have certainly felt tons better.  However, finding vegan-friendly, gluten free places to dine with my friends has been a challenge. So, I'm glad I found Handlebar. This is the kind of place that if you don't tell someone that it's all veggie, they might not know the difference and the best part is that they had a gluten free beer choice, whoot!  The food here was very spicy and well prepared. I had their Buffalo ""Chicken"" Wrap vegan style. Which boasted chicken style setian tossed in wing sauce with romaine, red onion, tomatoes, and vegan ranch dressing. So spicy and good. The side I ordered with that was the sesame broccoli which also was very good. I will have to attempt to duplicate the broccoli at home sometime soon.

We got to enjoy the humidity dined outside, and got to smoke while we slurped on IPA and waited for our food. I was having a terrific time, the waitress was super cute and friendly, conversation was flowing easily when I was suddenly blindsided. The girl brought out a ginormous platter of food, and it turns out: the platter was for me! 4 huge slices of toasted sourdough, suffocated by a whole cow's worth of seitan, a neatly slice side of avocado for some color and a heaping mound of salty fries. Oh wait, back up. A whole cow's worth of seitan? Yes, you read that right. Piles upon piles upon piles of sweetly barbeque'd seitan. For really really cheap! Holy crap, I just started giggling at the waitress like a moron, and didn't stop until I had stuffed a quarter of that stuff down my seitan hole. That's all there was room for, even after traveling 10 hours. The rest went home and fed me for breakfast and lunch the rest of my time in Chicago.

We split a green meanie and the buffalo 'chicken' wrap with sides of chili and smoked gouda mac and cheese.

The green meanie and the chili were both great- the sandwich ingredients were all very fresh (how do you find a perfectly ripe avocado in the middle of winter?) and the chili was hearty without being overly spicy (although I would have loved a dollop of sour cream and some shredded cheddar) The real standouts, though, were the mac and cheese and the wrap. Oh god the wrap. It made my meat-loving BF want to go veg. The man is OBSESSED with all things BBQ/buffalo and this more than satisfied his cravings.

It's not even appropriate music for the restaurant. Since when do cyclists & vegans get down to bass-heavy dance music?  It's not even a weekend. It is Wednesday fucking night, I'm sitting 2 feet away from my date, and we are entering double digits as we count the number of times the other needs to say ""what?"" in order to clearly understand what the other is saying.  Yeah, we tried to ask the waitress if the music could be turned down.

The seiten here is also top notch I gotta say. I got the BBQ Buffalo ""Chicken"" Wrap which was very very tasty. Seiten done wrong can be chewy or gummy but this just had the right texture. I also got the sausage seiten which was just ""meh.""  Our group also had the fried pickles which were absolutely A-MAZING. I've had fried pickles in Minneapolis and these were comparable. Pretty much deep fried battered pickle spears with just the perfect blend of saltiness and sweetness! Service was commendable and the crowd skewed young and hipsterish which jives with my vibes. The whole time we were there, they had LCD Soundsystem on the speakers which is OK I guess, but would have preferred a mix. As far as prices go, expect to spend $9-$13 per person with drinks.

The wait is usually fairly decent (we just got lucky and had a table empty right when we walked inside). However, the average is about 20 minutes or longer since it is a pretty small place. The menu is a nice variety, complete with vegan entrees, meat lover cravings, and interesting taste combos. From organic style soups and nice salads, to even just sandwiches.  What's the catch? Handlebar comes with a slightly enlarged price-tag.  We tried out the blackened catfish fillet and the seared tuna sandwich. The catfish was nicely prepared and served with two sides (choices of mashed taters, fries, veggies, soup, and a few others... nice selections). But the price was about $16 with tax.... eh.    The seared tuna sandwich was a different problem altogether.  With appearance, this sandwich was like a golden puppy at a dog show - simply SPLENDID, nicely seared, glistening red color!  BUT..... this ""dog"" ruined the show and pooped on the judges.... The sandwich tasted and smelled, no reaked, of a fishiness. (Cardinal rule of fish - if the fish smells, it is not fresh).  Further, the tuna had NO seasoning on it to maybe overcome its not-so-fresh-ness. Just bland grilled tuna. For $13.95 menu price (about $16 with tax).  Quite frankly, I expected something far superior than what arrived at our table.

2009-10-16,2.0,"In their defense, I should have read the limited one-page, two-sided menu more carefully. If I had, I wouldn't have ordered the salad with ""fried"" chicken because what was floating around in the vision inside my head was a salad with grilled chicken. But when the $10 for two cups ""fried"" chicken salad arrived, I tried to keep an open mind.  With one scan of the plate my mind closed again tighter than a popcorn fart. No salad dressing on the side (the dressing already mixed in), the ""fried"" (I heard no frying coming from that kitchen) chicken was microwave-baked hard and dry, and the two half-inch slices of rock-hard complimentary bread on the side may be good for cheap dental work but ain't good for mastication in general.  I looked to my companion (he of the equally sad-looking seasoning-slathered ""blackened"" fish fillet, cup of lumpy garlic mashed potatoes, and unusually large ice cream scoop-sized portion of chalky brown rice for $13) and said, ""It's like a meal some kid thought he once saw on a TV show and is trying to duplicate from memory.""  We both agreed that although we haven't been to the Handlebar in a while, the food quality seems to have taken a drastic nosedive and the menu appeared to be whittled down to skimpy portions of food that are more constructed than cooked: cheap easy prepped sandwiches and microwaveable ingredient-rich entrees. Even by vegetarian standards, the food is bland and has a commissary quality to it that, like most vegetarian/vegan places in Chicago, just doesn't jibe with the prices and no amount of quaint or quirky atmosphere will cover up.  The consensus is that this is the kind of place that really comes alive in summer with loads of beer foam on one's lip (slightly high) and after a sweaty bike (slightly exhausted). It's the atmosphere, not the food, that probably draws folks and made me a fan in the past. But that being so, it's also in a great location, has a great concept, and seemingly has a loyal clientele that wants to be given reasons to return, yet the menu is poorly planned, the food is subpar at best, and the overall execution of the menu makes it hard to buy their greenie-biker-vegetarian friendly shtick.  BBQ chicken wrap and grilled cheese of the same quality can be picked up at a Jewel deli counter and better seitan can be had at Whole Foods' deli counter. So why spend twice the money to get it at Handlebar for poorer quality? And why no experimentation over the years? I vaguely recall these same menu items from my last visit, but if it's truly greenie food love going on here, why no seasonal foods (soups right now, for instance)? Why no local or organic offers? Why no experimentation on the same level as they seem to enjoy experimenting with the decor?  If hipsterism is just the co-opting of symbols without any intrinsic value or meaning carried through to concept, I'd say Handlebar's menu pretty much sums up that aesthetic.",0.9964,0.806,0.147,0.048,0.5118041383219954

2009-08-09,2.0,"I had high hopes for Handlebar. You see, I'm a southerner. Not politically, or socially. Not regionally, since I'm living here in Chicago. But by birth and in terms of food, I'm a Georgian. I love fried green tomatoes, stewed yellow squash, and cheese grits. So when I saw that Handlebar offered the pinnacle of all southern breakfasts, biscuits and gravy, in a vegetarian version, I was sold and my girlfriend, roomie, and I made plans to hit up Handlebar for brunch. The first thing I noticed about Handlebar is that it is a popular brunch spot. There were no seats left inside when we arrived and they were just opening the back patio. While we waited, another 3 groups came through the door. Before the end of our meal, the entire patio was full, too. That may explain the service, as well.  We sat down and I decided to order the biscuits with seitan sausage gravy with a side of fried plantains. I also asked the server if I could get their loose leaf teas over ice. He said no. This always bothers me because all you have to do is steep the tea and pour it over a glass of ice. In any case, I got the apple juice, which is overpriced at $3.50 a glass. Come ON. We sat out in the heat and waited for our food to arrive. My girlfriend and I got ours first (she had the breakfast burrito) and then, after our server had a leisurely conversation right behind us, he went in and got out roommate's food. To explain the food: The southern biscuit is a delicate, beautiful, and mysterious thing. There are several versions, some flaky, some crisp on the outside, some a little doughy. There are as many recipes as there are grandmothers in the south and none of those recipes are written down. Regardless, this was not a southern biscuit. This was some weird whole wheat, grainy, brown, behemoth mass. It was not soft or flaky or buttery or any of those things. I'm all for health food. I'm a vegetarian, right? But once in a while you want to splurge and eat the bad stuff you miss from before you decided to be a responsible adult. The gravy was brown, like you'd expect chicken gravy to be, not white like real sausage gravy. Sausage gravy should be made with, well, sausage (or fake sausage, in this case), a flour roux, and milk. This was not. This was not what I wanted, not what I ordered, not what I came here for. Not only was I disappointed, but everyone at our table was less than impressed with their food. The potatoes were bland, the food wasn't cooked right, etc. and so we all left with full bellies but empty hearts. Add that to the fact that the place isn't cheap ($7 for a biscuit, $4 for plantains, etc.) and the service was awful and it just wasn't what we'd hope.

My girlfriend ordered the fajitas and I ordered the ""chicken"" wrap.  Both were served relatively quickly and both were so sensational that our conversation completely stopped in favor of eating, eating, eating.  The dessert was a blueberry/almond/ice cream crisp thing that, when eaten together, was a fantastic flavor explosion, the words for which quickly eluded me.  We could only communicate our love of the food in wide-eyed wonder at each other.  Seriously, it was that good.    Slathered around and over the food and tables is an ocean of fun music (from unsigned hopefuls to Led Zep) and original art, which, unlike quite a few displays in restaurants across the city, could be described as both ""original"" and ""art""! The staff?  Asshats.  The host guy came up to us, said ""Outside's full?  You want inside?  I'll be back"" and then went in the back and then behind the bar to drink some water for a while before seating us.  The waiter guy, with his too-tight black T-shirt and undisciplined hair, was feet-draggingly charming and wonderfully apathetic.  ""So yeh, uh, whaddya want?""   Taken at face value, it would have been easy to get offended.  However, seeing it as a hipster Ed Debevic's, it was actually more than fine.  It was enjoyable.

I decided to try out Handlebar after I had heard some great reviews and I had a meat filled week. I've noticed that I can eat a lot of vegetarian food and never feel overly full unlike when I have a Kuma's Corner burger. My girlfriend and I started with the chorizo nachos, faux chorizo of course. The dish was loaded with black beans and wonderful chorizo. The major difference I could taste was in the fact that it was less greasy than a ground beef nachos. Overall they were really good. I then had the tofu fajitas. For some reason, I went with a Mexican theme. The tofu appeared to be lightly fried and accompanied by some wonderful grilled vegetables and soft corn tortillas. They also serve it with a green salsa which is a nice accompaniment. My meal was great, I cleaned the plate and didn't feel overly full at all. They have a great beer selection and a diverse menu. I even had half my grilfriend's buffalo chicken wrap today and it was very good. Although, I could swear that the brown rice is identitical to the bag brown rice you can get at Trader Joe's. My major complaint is that it was awfully loud in the restaurant. Maybe I am getting old and losing my hearing but it was hard to keep a conversation with my girlfriend.

To be fair, I'm not a huge fan of breakfast food.  So I opted for a sandwich, and went for the thing I make less often at home (a BBQ seitan sandwich) over something I make a lot these days (grilled cheese with avocado, tomato, etc).  Wrong move.  The sandwich tasted only like BBQ sauce, was way too big to manage, and just bored me. Don't get me wrong.  We sat outside on a lovely sunny day.  We had a party of six and were happily accommodated.  Our server was super friendly.  Good beer on tap.    Great samosas and nachos for an appetizer.  I'd come back for the seitan chorizo and black bean nachos alone. I know from experience their African ground nut stew and other entrees are worth the trip out here.  But the brunch menu which hangs around like a clueless guest until 3pm on weekends?  No thanks.",0.9715,0.735,0.168,0.096,0.501580459770115

The soup was GREAT. The chicken wrap wasn't horrible. It was actually the buffalo sauce that I didn't like. I had a chai tea, as well, which was good...but my whole thing is, if you can easily have access to a whole box of it for cheaper and it isn't made in some special way, then...no awesome points.

Anyway, the food was fine.    The service wasn't as bad as it is as Earwax, though it was kind of tacky to be told they can't split a check on two cards when it is quite clear that they CAN do such a thing but DON'T do it because they don't want to pay the extra dollar processing charge or whatever.  This tacky bit brought the server very close to getting a ten per cent tip but my friend is such a pussycat that he gave what worked out to be 18.5 percent for service that could best be described as adequate. It's just funny that in a city like Chicago the assortment of vegetarian restaurants is so unremarkable and limited.  Thank heaven for Victory's Banner and Alice & Friends.  And the more i think about this place the more I think I might rather go to Pick Me Up, although those mashed potatoes were pretty good, so I might be inclined to check it out again if I'm in the neighborhood.",0.9936,0.768,0.21,0.021,0.43134920634920626

I was quite impressed with their unique beer selection none of that mgd and bud crap. They also have drink specials every day- veddy nize (Borat voice).  We got the nachos as an appetizers and I wasn't a huge fan on the topping ratio... LOTS of beans, one 2 oz cup partially filled with sour cream, no salsa unless requested, and not much (portion wise) of anything else. Still good but I would defo get the chili cheese fries next time.  For dinner I got the green meanie with the smoked gouda mac and cheese. The meanie was veddy nize and veddy big. The smoked gouda mac and cheese was DELISH and huge as far as a ""side"" goes. Next time I'm getting the grilled cheese though... just crazing one on this cloudy day... maybe with avocado for a nominal extra $1.50. Both of my friends got the fried ""chicken"" salad...

Your staff was scampering around trying to serve all the tables. This is a fault of management and greed to milk the workers and customers. The food definitely SOUNDED interesting. I guess I will never know. My recommendation? Make sure you go when the weather is crap (so they don't use the outdoor dining),  they don't have more than 2 tables of customers.

I'd hoped to get a peaceful cheesy feeling from the items I ordered: the grilled cheese (muenster on multigrain bread) and the infamous smoked gouda mac & cheese that I had seen hailed so much in reviews. The grilled cheese was very good: melty muenster crusted up nicely around the edges, and the multigrain bread added a nice textural dimension. The macaroni, though providing a wonderful flavor from the smoked gouda, was disappointingly cold. Had we not been on a schedule, I would have sent it back.

2009-05-01,3.0,"I hadn't been to the Handlebar in ages--years, actually--so I was thrilled when my friend Ruthie suggested it for a girls' night. Yeah, I know, a majority vegetarian cyclist bar doesn't scream ""Girls Night Out!"" but we're not your average girls.  It was one of the first super warm days of the season, so we wanted to sit on the patio. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, so we took a seat at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and helpful with the beer selection. I really wanted there to be Three Floyd's Gumball Head, but I settled for the Three Floyd's Pride and Joy, which was a Friday night special for $4. Not too shabby. For those of you who love your ""shandies"" and ""panaches,"" Handlebar is one of the few non-German bars in the city that stocks Stiegl Radler, which is this delicious mix of lemon soda and beer. It wasn't quite hot enough for it the night we were there, but man, when it's over 80 and you're on the patio, go for it!  So we sat and drank for awhile, and, after inquiring why the 20 minutes was taking so long, learned that it had started to rain. Why they didn't inform us of this is beyond me, but we kind of shrugged and chose a table by the window.  While the menu is small, it is mighty for veggies looking for some interesting options. I dallied between the Black Beans Maduro and the Ground Nut Stew, and thought for a moment of just ordering a plate of seitan Chorizo and black bean nachos, but then finally made up my mind and ordered the Fish Tacos. My three dinner companions all ordered the Black Beans Maduro, and it had pleasing presentation and just the right amount of spice. My fish tacos were pretty good; I still think that Goose Islands are the best in the city though. The fish was meaty, the avocado generous, and the rice and chili side delicious, but the tacos overall were on the dry side. They begged for the creamy, tangy sauce that is drizzled over the ones at Goose Island. Probably should have gone for the nachos.  Now for the completely unexpected bizarre part that is completely a product of my flight of fancy: well, let me give you background first, dear Readers. As we were sitting at the bar, I overheard my friend Ruthie say, ""they only accept one card per table."" I immediately pulled out my Chicago Public Radio card and said, ""Great! We can use mine!"" So when the meal came to a close, I handed my card over to our server about whom we later wondered--was he stoned? One diner at our table noticed that he tried to swipe it on the credit card reader several times, and he soon returned, saying, ""This doesn't work."" I explained to him that the card is good for two-for-one meals. He went off again, and then returned again, this time saying, ""Our chef says that we didn't sign up for this, but I gave you 15% off your meal anyway."" After some discussion, I learned that the ""card"" Ruthie had been referring to ealier was a CREDIT CARD! Ooops.  Now, don't you all go running to the Handlebar with your Chicago Public Radio cards expecting a discount, but do take note that they only accept one credit card per table, and they do not split checks.  Next time I come here, I want to sit outside with a plate of nachos and a hoppier beer or a Radler. Then I will be able to add another star.",0.9989,0.825,0.17,0.005,0.5144179894179896

2009-03-26,4.0,"""Is seitan some kind of pork?"" When one of my lovely book/brunch club ladies exclaimed this after perusing the menu I feared that my restaurant choice might turn into a disaster. I was so excited about to try Handlebar that I didn't consider the possibility that meat eaters might be less than enthused about it, especially when nursing their post-St. Patty's Day hangovers.  Crisis averted, no one was disappointed by their meal choices. The friend who asked about seitan even exclaimed that it was the best breakfast burrito she's ever had. In fact, everyone at our table (all meat eaters btw) had nothing, but praise for their meals. One even said it was the best brunch we'd met for in a really long time, yay! I couldn't decide what to get, so many things looked good. Since this place is vegetarian/vegan friendly I didn't have to eliminate a lot of menu items like I normally do, which was nice. I settled on the grilled cheese and a side of smoked gouda mac & cheese. I usually eat one item before moving on to the next, but both dishes looked so tasty I couldn't decide which one to eat first. I broke with habit and alternated between the two. Service was friendly, but slow. Since we were chatting about the book and catching up anyway it didn't hinder our dining experience much. Bottom line: Really good food, I can't wait to come back. TIP: If you're going with a larger group (5+) for brunch get there early, the place fills up fast.

The service, on the other hand, was pretty odd.  One guy brought us to our seats and told us our waiter would be right around to get drink orders...but no one ever came, so we went to the bar to order.  The bartender told us he'd send out a waiter, and eventually a third guy came out and asked what we wanted to drink.  I ordered an Arnold Palmer with vodka, and he audibly scoffed.  I've got a good sense of humor about the things I ingest, but this guy wasn't joking - he actually thought it was ridiculous that I wanted vodka in my drink and refused to let me order it with anything but whiskey.  I told him I wasn't a whiskey drinker, but he left before I was sure what I would be receiving and before even asking us if we'd like something to eat.  The drinks came out and lo and behold my drink was made with whiskey, but since it had taken so long to get even that I decided to cut my losses.  We were about to order some food, but the second our waiter dropped off our drinks he walked away.  We figured he'd come back to see how things were (especially since he'd made me a drink I was almost certain not to like), but nope - we had to go ask the guy who seated us if we could order some food (which, as I mentioned above, was delicious).  This all might have been easily explained had the place been super-busy, but there was no one in the bar and one other table on the patio, and they didn't order anything the entire time we were there.

There was a reason that Handlebar was chosen as the place to revive Yelp Chicago's vegetarian events (in the form of the first monthly Vegetarian Supper Club).  Many meat eaters that I talked to before deciding on a venue raved about this place to the point where they could put aside consuming flesh for a night and join the festivities (extra credit and thank you to Handlebar for accomidating our large group - this place doesn't usually take reservations but made an exception for us). And it was pretty easy to see why.  While Handlebar doesn't seem to try to approximate meat like some vegetarian restaurants, the food is good enough that no meat eater in our group seemed to notice their loss.  But with Handlebar's fine beer selection, it's possible to get any omnivore who did notice a loss drunk enough not to care. There is a big problem for vegetarians at this restaurant though.  Too many choices.  I solved this dilemma by ordering three sides as a meal.  The collard greens were not sauteed enough but the vegetarian chili had a nice kick and a good consistency (though, again, not really fake meaty) and the gouda macaroni and cheese...oh my...I want it again right now.

As far as I'm concerned, the food that I ate was damn good and perfect for the freezing ass Chicago temps. If you want a hearty, delicious, vegetarian meal, look no further than the 'Ground Nut Stew,' consisting of sweet potato, coconut, zucchini, kale with brown rice, peanuts and toasted coconut. I don't see kale nearly enough on menus, so I was thrilled to see it within this dish. The portion was served in a large bowl at a fair price of $8.75.  Though I am not a coconut lover, I hardly noticed it amidst the dish. There was some heat, which got the blood flowin. Absolutely tasty, filling.

2008-10-22,3.0,"Handlebar is a-ok as my stars indicate. The food is kinda overpriced, considering that everything is made of vegetables or tofu. $9 seems like a lot for a sandwich with tofu and spinach. The best thing I've had was the chili quesadilla, which was tasty but not really healthy. The beer selection is  kinda boring. The service is ok. Decor is ok, but it's a smaller place. I will probably go back, but there are so many better options for vegetarian in the area. It seems like people like it because its the ""cool"" spot in the area, and there isn't another place that caters to the bike crowd.  I think that I have a personal mental block that keeps me from loving Handlebar because I worked for several years at a similar vegetarian cafe that was AWESOME.  The food, the beer selection, the price everything was better.  I guess if you're ever in Boston, you should go to the Other Side.

My two quasi-vegan friends both had the bbq seitan sandwich which was huge and by their accounts really good. The black beans were super flavorful too. The menu in general seems to be almost ""southern"" or ""soul food"" inspired with other items like biscuits and gravy (seitan sausage of course) and gouda mac and cheese.

2008-10-18,5.0,"Handlebar is hands down my favorite restaurant in Wicker Park. Since it don't eat eggs, it rules out a lot of the brunch items from many of the ""vegetarian-friendly"" places in the area, but Handlebar has great vegan french toast and decent scrambled tofu. Brunch-wise, the biscuits and gravy are great, though the biscuits are a little heavy for my taste. My favorite is the vegan diablos, with little homemade corncakes, seitan chorizo, scrambled tofu, black beans, brown rice, and diablo sauce. Since I eat dairy, I get it smothered with jack cheese and sour cream too, but it's almost as good without. The new southern breakfast is also great, with collard greens, scrambled tofu (or eggs, if you like those), succotash, and cheddar grits. Sandwich-wise, my favorite by far is the vegan buffalo wrap. The BBQ seitan is always a classic, and the marinated tofu is good, but not as good as the rubbed and grilled tofu it replaced. The also had a marinated seitan sandwich for a short while recently that was amazing, but sadly it got bumped from the menu. Entrée-wise, I really like the tortellini, but the best entrées tend to be the specials, which change weekly. I've never been disappointed by these. Desserts aren't especially great, but I am a fan of the vegan fried pies. Fillings also change from time to time. The pecan is my favorite, so I'm hoping that comes back soon. The beer menu is great, with a revolving selection of microbrew drafts as well as a wide selection of bottles. I highly recommend trying a beermosa for brunch. Yes, this is beer and orange juice.

It's not just that I live five short blocks away and this place is great to take everyone from parents to out-of-town pals who want a taste of Chicago. It's that it's all amazing. The beer selection is large. Not Map Room large, but large enough to stand on its own. The waiters know which beers go in which glasses -- a handy feat -- and can tell you about the beers if you ask. That's fairly rare for a restaurant of this price range. Personal favorites include the Green Meanie, which is refreshing and fresh and just the thing after you've had a weekend of unhealthy food/drink and want to feel both full and not horrible, the bbq seitan sandwich, which is perhaps more than any one human can consume, the breakfast burrito, a perfect mesh of burrito-ly goodness and everything one wants in a breakfast, and the gazpacho, when they have it. The only thing I can't really get behind is the smoked gouda mac n cheese. It's tasty all right, and far more wholesome than your average box of Kraft, but its smoked flavor tends to overpower and make it taste like a plate of smoked in pasta form, rather than the smoke being a tertiary element to the cheese and macaroni. That said, I'm still giving Handlebar five stars. It's just that delicious. * I am a vegetarian, thus I do not eat fish.

Chicago dinner probably has the best selection of this type of food, but Handlebar is way cooler (I think).  It also doesn't have photos of a guru or fuzzy animals which some of the other veggie places have.

HOLY CRAP was I wrong.  I think I had one of the best meals I have had in a loooong time.  I was instantly enticed by the Gouda Mac & Cheese and I was steering away from anything with seitan or tofu.  I decided to go for the yellowtail tuna sandwich with a side of the mac & cheese. It was hands down one of the best in my life.  The tuna was cooked PERFECTLY to a medium rare and sliced.  It came with sunflower sprouts and some greens and a savory garlic aioli on perfectly toasted multigrain bread.  The gouda mac & cheese was hot and super creamy with the perfect flavor. I cannot wait to go back and try some other things on the menu.  The portions were big and all the food coming out around us looked delish! As for the atmosphere, the bar is a hike away from any trains but I will definitely bring my bike to solve that next time.  The beer garden type setting in the back was nice decorated (for an outside spot) and a great place to have a relaxing dinner.  Overall the vibe was very laid back and made for the perfect weeknight spot.",0.9972,0.724,0.248,0.028,0.5020061728395062

2008-09-02,4.0,"(Sorry, longest review ever but worth finishing) This is a letter that I sent to the owner today: I have been repeatedly patronizing your establishment for about 5 years.  I typically come in once every one or two weeks.  I usually enjoy the food and the service had historically ranged from passable to good. However, several years back I began to notice a new employee.  He usually seems to be behind the bar, but often serves as well (tall, thin, buzzed hair).  He is, by far the worst server I have ever encountered.  He is rude, smug, and does his job VERY poorly.   Over the years I have been served by him many times and each time have come away with a new depth of the absurdity of his service.  However, this past Friday (Aug 29th) absolutely topped all previous experiences and has possibly led me to consider not coming back. I had been talking to an out-of-town friend about Handlebar over the years and so when she came to visit this weekend, we were excited for her to try it.  Unfortunately it ended up being little more than an embarrassment for me.  We of course had my *favorite* waiter to begin with.  He was his typical dismissive self.  When he approaches a table, he does not greet anyone; he merely stands there staring at you with a disgusted look in his eye waiting for you to beg for food and drinks.  We were able to order ONE drink from him and our food.  Following this we never saw him again except for when he dropped off our burnt sandwiches (which was a first for me at Handlebar).  I thought better than to even consider sending them back since he surely strikes me as the type who would retaliate in some manner.   Then I made repeated attempts to get another round of drinks.  He came through our section several times but actually noticeably and purposefully IGNORED me as I tried to flag him down.  Finally about 40 minutes after receiving our food, I had to get up and walk up to the bar where I said to someone else ""Since I cannot get anymore drinks or service of any kind, can at least pay so that I can leave?"" Our smug waiter appeared shortly, made a PATHETIC apology which was more of an insult than anything else, and that was it. Let me summarize by saying that it is this man's attitude that ruins the experience.  I understand that slow service happens occasionally, but when I leave a restaurant actually feeling BAD (unwelcome, unsatisfied), that is unacceptable.  Hilariously, I went on Yelp to read reviews of Handlebar as I considered writing one myself, and found several that mentioned this same waiter.  He clearly feels that he's too good to serve, and there for, he should not.   I would highly recommend that you address his attitude with him and the affects that it has on your business. Sincerely, Crystal  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I've always likes this place and it's a darn shame that this one awful guy ruins it for people.  And you know me...if you don't bring me my drinks, you're dead in the water.  Hopefully he is ""dealt with"" in some manner one of these days or gets a job as a Rocket Scientist so he can get the respect he so adamantly feels he deserves! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE*********  WIthin a few hours, the owner responded with a very nice and accomodating note promising to address the issue.  My faith is renewed.",-0.8787,0.769,0.113,0.118,0.5035131619222527

Layered crispy, sweet plantains, black beans, brown rice, jack cheese and a chipotle-tomato sauce. ahh this was seriously the ISH! A mixture of sweet and total spiceyness but not overspicy. It was just great and very filling.  My friend ordered the the Buffalo Chicken wrap, which she wasn't dissapointed but wasn't satisfied with either. We both agreed that the faux chicken in the wrap tasted more like faux fish sticks than chicken. She had this with the side of Smoked Gouda Mac n Cheese. Now this mac n cheese was just simply dope.

2008-04-02,4.0,"Meat? Who needs meat? I've been dying to try this place for months and finally my friend Kim and I got to try this place yesterday for lunch. When you walk in, the place is not very large, tall ceilings, exposed brick, a bunch of tables, art, posters, cute, I like. We were told to sit where ever we wanted and we picked a small table in the front. Now there was a gentleman off to my left by the window who told the server how much he loved the meal and how he keeps forgetting about Handlebar and how he can't wait to come back. I get a little excited and giddy. I had been salivating over the menu all week and still was having a hard time finding something I could settle on. I was lucky for two reasons, I was done for the next six hours and there for could have a beer, they have a pretty interesting beer list and my friend Kim was willing to share an appetizer, trouble was which one? As I sipped on my small goblet of Hairy Eyeball, (yes, and it was a tasty brew), we were flipping coins between the samosas and the nachos, (okay all four appetizers), we finally ordered our nachos with soy chorizo and black beans. Kim got the grilled cheese with their Thai coconut soup and I got the Green Meanie, plantains and we split an order of their smoked Gouda mac and cheese.  We first got our nachos, holy carp batman! A huge pile of tastiness! This was big enough for four people to start off with, there was just two of us... and we had more food coming. The chips were freshly made, the black beans were great, fresh and I couldn't help not to pick at them for the rest of lunch. (On a side note, Kim got some indigestion from the soy chorizo, but on a side side note she is also 8 1/2 months pregnant and her digestion isn't what it normally is). We then got the rest of our food. We just started laughing at each other, obviously we had ordered way too much food, but we carried on. My Green Meanie, avocado, tomato, spinach, sprouts, herbed goat cheese, honey Dijon on whole grain toast which was really good as were the plantains which were crispy, sweet and savory all in one bite. Kim's grilled cheese, was ooey and gooey and cheesy goodness, although I didn't try her soup, she said it was good, though too spicy for her. Now for the mac and cheese. Crud. I am a big fan of another place's mac and cheese, this may take the top. Not overwhelming with cheese, but a great balance of sauce and smokiness. We were both quite happy with our lunch and as we waddled out because of our fullness, I couldn't help but think a few things... ""I need to go for more vegetarian places, this was great."" ...  ""Did I leave the iron on?"".... ""I can not wait to come back here."" P.S.

The owners of Handlebar got it right when they decided to open the only vegetarian-friendly breakfast/lunch/dinner/bar spot on North Ave west of  Leavitt. They have a mild cyclist bent--there's a bike rack out back and a pipe in the front of the restaurant that doubles as a rack. Oh, yeah, and there's a Four Star sticker on the pseudo-rack in front too-- ""street cred.""  Whatever, that's where the ""friendliness"", bicycle or other, ends. Let's go through the service, shall we? Every time I've been here I have been served by this tall, intimidating shaved-head guy. He glares as he's taking your order, sighs audibly if asked a question about the menu, and, in general, embodies the word ""goon."" The last time I went I was served a Brooklyn Ale that was flat. When I told the server, he apparently did not believe me and brought it back to the bar to confer with the bartender and to taste it, at length, for himself. He then returned to the table to roll his eyes and tell me that yeah, it's flat and I wouldn't have to pay for it. No offer to, um, replace my beer with another?  OK on to the food. I usually get the seitan sloppy joe. It's uneven. The first time I ordered the sloppy joe, it was delicious. The perfect blend of seitan-to-bbq sauce, onions were grilled, bread was fresh, great. The next time I ordered it, it was literally swimming in bbq sauce (tastes like Bullseye Barbeque sauce, nothing special) and the bread was stale! Ouch. The last time I went there, I again ordered the seitan sloppy joe, hoping for the same sandwich as I'd gotten the first time but again was served a steaming helping of bbq sauce and make-your-teeth-ache bread.

I was cool with my Cubanesque dish, even if it was really more hot (spicy) than packed with flavor. Dining companion thought the polenta dish was bland. He didn't complain too loudly, however, and managed to finish it all. I was unimpressed with the mac and cheese. It was just fine. I've had better, I've had worse...just sort of bland.  For dessert, we indulged in the frozen peanut butter pie with quince sauce, which I thought was a creative take on the old PB&J, but otherwise about the same as you'd find in most freezers in casual dining restaurants. I got a dark chocolate cake thing which was good and rich and probably the best thing - aside from some dark beer - that entered my mouth that evening.  In all, it was a fine place.

The staff has always been courteous and accommodating, providing you're not being a total douche bag. Go for a bite to eat, and stay for a few rounds. It's a great way to start the night or spend a Summer day. It's both a nice place for two people to have a conversation and a fun place for a small group. On a Friday or Saturday night it can be a bit crowded, but generally better than other places in the area for getting a table. In the Summer the backyard is a comfortable place to have a meal and drink a few beers, although on a really hot day you can sometimes smell the dumpsters in the alley. The best tables are in the middle. Their meat substitutes don't have that frantic air of trying too hard to please the vegetarians and vegans. It's food that you'll find yourself getting a craving for as dinner time rolls around. Breakfast has been good every time I've gone, but I usually go for lunch and dinner. Just about everything is good on the menu. Start with a huge plate of nachos for the table or three delicious samosas. My favorite dinners are the bbq seitan sandwich, the meal of three sides (plantains, mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese or chili), the black beans maduro, and the chicken salad (or wrap).

Despite being part of the Wicker Park ""hipster"" region, The Handlebar seems to draw a variety of customers. At least it did on a Tuesday night around 7 pm. My wife and I shared samosas ($8.25 for three, billed as appetizers), fried plantains ($2.50, sides) and the ""Everything Green Salad"" which has spinach, green beans, avocado, some kind of green dressing, avocado, sprouts--yep, a bunch of green stuff. The samosas were pretty good, though not terribly spicy or complex. Someone here or on the Reader said they rivaled Devon street and I'd have to differ.  As to the salad? It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. Really just a salad.  Again, as with the samosas, there was flavor, but nothing interesting about it. The plantains, though--nicely done. Fried just enough to leave them warm, sugary and with a soft center.  In fact, we were debating about having a second helping, for dessert. We should have, because the chocolate peanut butter pie that we chose instead was your standard freezer-fare entree.  You know, the dessert that the restaurant buys at Trader Joe's, then dribbles some chocolate syrup and cocoa powder on? Despite the unremarkable food, the menu has quite a selection of vegan/vegetarian entrees and the atmosphere is laid back.  I could tell, vaguely, that the music playing was indie or alternative, but it wasn't drowning out my conversation with its hipness.

I went back a couple weeks later and ordered them again, and they arrived at my table with a clump of black hair decorating one biscuit. Yikes.

Generally, the Handlebar is awesome because: (1) great concept - a biker as in bicyclist bar; (2) well-chosen, delicious beer on tap; (3) yummy, veggie/tofu focused food. Last night I had the Southwestern tofu special.  The tofu was rubbed with paprika, had a nice, smoky flavor, and was slightly crisped on the outside, but managed to stay soft and tender on the inside.  It came with a jicama and corn relish that had just enough red onion to give it a bite.  All that made me excuse the corn masa cakes on which the tofu sat were not good though, dry little yellow frisbees with no flavor to speak of. Having just finished a long bike ride, don't take the fact that I ordered more to mean portions were small; I was just starving.  So I ordered a side of fried plaintains - gooey, super sweet banana-ey goodness and the appetizer of chili cheese fries - fries stuck together by the cheese oozing through the little crevices in the mound of salty potato and vegetarian chili with black and pinto beans, onion and green pepper.  I ate the whole decadent mess even though I kind of got full a little ways into it. I would also recommend the smoked tofu sandwich and the green meanie.  The black bean maduro, while tasty, comes in a little high-falutin' tower when it should really be a mess of black beans, cheese, and plaintains.

This place is *almost* a vegetarian restaurant, they do have a few fish items on the menu, but the majority of the items here are vegetarian and most of those are vegan, or can be made vegan. I am vegan, so my experience is limited to those items, but I have found the Handlebar to be the kind of place you could take a staunch meat eater and have them leave liking the place. I really like the BBQ Seitan Sandwich, it is the menu item that I order most often. The sandwich is huge and filling and comes with a side of  your choice. The other sandwiches are good as well, but I don't find them as flavorful as the BBQ. You should really keep your eyes on the specials, there are usually a few specials that aren't on the menu, and these can be great. The entrees can be hit or miss. I can remember being so stoked to try the West African Ground Nut Stew. It was very spicy, really watery for a stew, and in my opinion not very flavorful. The sesame noodles are pretty good if you are looking to avoid a sandwich. One of the more exciting developments in recent months is the restaurant opening at 10 am for a daily brunch. The brunch menu has a few amazing items. The biscuits and gravy being one, this is a stick to your ribs meal. The biscuits are flaky and the gravy has bits of meatless sausage in it, so good. Also, the vegan french toast is a keeper.  I guess one of the things that could use some work is the desert menu. They have this vegan raspberry torte thing that is okay, but not amazing. If they would add a nice offering of vegan cakes or pies, it would really up the value for me. Also, they have a large selection of beers and wines. One word of advice though, there can be a pretty good wait on the weekends. In the summer, the patio can help alleviate some of the strain... but when the patio isn't opened be prepared for a wait.

The ONLY reason I'm giving the place four stars is because I've recently been there for brunch and dinner, and both times the service was vastly improved. Plus, they've done some alterations to the menu that make it even more vegetarian friendly and diverse than it was before. I had the blackened tofu fajitas, which were spicy, flavorful, and very satisfying. Plus, even better, I saw at least half a dozen other menu items that I'd go back to sample without hesitation.

The bad: I do wish the menu was larger by just a dish or two or changed more regularly. By far, the biggest con is the hipper-than-thou and haphazard service. Once, my girlfriend complimented our waiter on his shirt which had this interesting writing on it, asked what it said, and he actually replied ""It's a shirt from -suchnsuchaclub- before they closed.

Instead I sat at the bar, amazed how so many people could be milling around and NO one, I mean NO ONE, noticed I had no beer or menu in front of me or anything. SHIT. The bus guy methodically cleaned up about 20 glasses of water/downed beer off the bar and asked me if I needed something, then said he was just the bar back and got a bartender for me. I asked her for a local beer and she kind of giggled and looked confused. Oh, I'm sorry, is asking for a RECOMMENDATION of local beer a ""weird"" question for a bartender? I got a beer, without even a coaster, classy. She was nice enough, but shit. At one point, I looked over and the whole staff was hanging out and talking at the edge of the bar. It was kinda 'weird"".  Maybe I would be more forgiving if I was younger than my ancient 27 years, but I could see only immature or unpolished scenesters working a 'cool' bar and not too excited about having to serve people who weren't their friends or people they wish they could sleep with.

I was at a weekend seminar and had 45 minutes for my break and Handle bar was less than block away, so a small group of us headed there expecting a quick bite.  While there was plenty of seating, we were told after waiting significantly for waitress to come over that the wait time for food was long, which was rather surprising considering how few people they had in he place (like 3) ... anyway, we kept our drink orders and changed the meals to take-out. And asked the waitress to separate out tabs - which she seem to get rather annoyed with -  now here is where it really goes awry.  It took them 45 minutes to get out order to us (keep in mind we had 45 minutes for the break) to continue the waitress gave us our tabs and we were about ready to leave when the waitress comes back to me and says ""did you intend to leave me 80 cents for a tip"" - Ok, so I'd admit I'm not the sharpest pencil in the box, but I thought 80 cents more then fair. Considering she only brought us water and our drinks. Why: 1) She only had to serve drinks. 2) She had an attitude when we wanted separate tabs. 3) The food took 45 minutes (for seitan sausage, Mac & Cheese and potato's hell I can't even cook and could whip that up faster. 4) Our order was Take-Out. 5) A tip is not a given - it's a reward for quality service. Being kind and generous person, I added a buck to the payment for her tip, and bit my lip - but my real tip is: ""your nasty attitude will cost you dearly one day my pretty and you little tip too"".  After leaving and getting back to our seminar ... late I might add... and having to eat while sitting in the audience - the quality of my food was absolutely horrible.
