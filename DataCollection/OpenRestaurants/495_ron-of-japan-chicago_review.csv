2017-08-30,1.0,"This was the worst dining experience I've ever had. We had a reservation and waited over a half hour for our table- keep in mind there were plenty of tables available. This is a hibachi grill and the exhaust in the whole restaurant was not working so everyone was basically choking on dirty smoke. I've been to this hibachi and many others before and everyone knows the cook is supposed to put on a little show- our guy didn't even light the grill on fire- he just turned it on. The food was awful- we weren't even given the rice that we ordered but 3 people at our table were served rice and we were not. I've been here before and the two experiences were night and day. It was so bad we left before our dessert arrived. There are so many restaurants in this area, there is no room for horrible service/ food/ atmosphere, etc. I will never go back there and hope you think twice before you do.",-0.9625,0.84,0.021,0.139,0.5452380952380953
2017-08-29,2.0,"We were really hungry one night and we had always talked about teppanyaki so we just walked in one evening. I was surprised by how outdated the decor was, especially for a restaurant in this part of town. It's super dark and dim, but not in an intimate way... it's dark and dim as if hiding years of stains and scuffing around the whole place. There's this weird purple mood lighting that reminds you of a stereotypical Asian massage parlor... I admit, the portions are huge. They start you off with soup and salad but it's really bad soup and salad. The soup is bland and watery, the salad tasted really cheap. The quality of the ingredients are poor, even the proteins and fried rice. The chef is kind, but doesn't do any tricks except make a big fire (didn't even make an onion volcano or crack the egg in mid-air).  I don't recommend. I heard there's a BeniHana opening up downtown.

2017-06-21,1.0,"Disaster from start to finish. Everyone here is going through the motions in a tired place that has been around since the 1970s (looks it) and should have been closed years ago. It reminds me of the ambience, food, and service that one gets at restaurants in tourist areas where everything is at best mediocre and they just don't give a damn. The valet was nice.  Grandson requested this restaurant for his 4th grade graduation gift as some of his YouTube friends had been to Japanese restaurants where the chefs cook table-side. I picked this one because it was close. What a mistake.  From the tired interior to the lackadaisical staff to the bland, over-priced and poorly cooked food, it was awful. The chicken noodle soup had 3 small squares of chicken with a few microscopic vermicelli noodles swimming about in an overly salted broth. The accompanying side-salad was basically a few pieces of head lettuce, a piece of sliced tomato, and an unremarkable dressing. I had the seafood combo (shrimp, calamari, and scallops for a hefty price). The small portions were overcooked and covered in a gloppy, oily sauce. And for God knows what reason, you can have white rice or, for an upcharge of $3.00, you can have the beef fried rice and only the beef fried rice. When I asked if I could instead have the shrimp fried rice because it made no sense to me than beef fried rice with seafood, I was told I would have to pay full price for the side of shrimp friend rice ($7.95). The best part of the whole meal was the ice cream, which was pretty much the same as any I could have bought at Jewel.  The service also left much to be desired. If you're cooking table-side, you should have some personality and try to engage the quests. There was none of that; just workmanlike cooking of the ingredients. The one ""flourish"" was when our cook flamed a pool of oil, which caused the closed in space of the seating around the hibachi to become extremely hot and uncomfortable. Our waitress was nice but disappeared for long stretches. When we asked her to explain the menu she quickly went through the items and then said, ""Let me give you a few minutes to figure it out"" and then left us alone to puzzle over it ourselves. She was at least nice enough to let us know that a gratuity had been added to the bill, which arrives with a spot for an ""additional gratuity"" (I think not). The coup-de-grace was when we were eating our ice cream and  the guy who cleans the grill started spraying cleaning product and scraping the grease off the grill as we ate. This could not wait until we had finished?   Needless to say, we would never go back and would never recommend this to anyone we like.",0.8455,0.888,0.065,0.047,0.5114583333333332

I opted for the ribeye which was an expensive meal that had no flavor and the meat was not well marbled or tender.  They should be embarrassed by offering this food at those prices.  Actually, at any price!  This food was really a pathetic excuse for a dinner.  The only thing that had any flavor was the salad dressing.   The next evening I happened to go to rosebud café and got skirt steak which is a far less expensive cut of meat and it was far more flavorful and far better in quality.   Shame on you Ron of Japan, diners deserve better.  My girlfriend and I both left at least two thirds of the meat.  (we both ordered the ribeye and $80 later left most of the meal )  I think you're just too used to tourists and don't care about the quality of your food and people returning.  Sad.   I felt I should add perhaps the fault here lies in the chef, too.  He added absolutely no flavoring to the meat whatsoever.  However, that still doesn't account for the poor quality of the meat, it was very dense and not tender at all.  Also the beef fried rice tasted more like hamburger helper.  I hope they read this review and check out each chef's cooking abilities.",-0.9494,0.791,0.07,0.139,0.5131410256410256

The zucchini had no crunch and they put some disgusting egg sauce on the shrimp, which also lacked crunch and flavor.  The chicken and shrimp's flavors were masked by way too much pepper. In addition to crummy food, the plate situation is a disaster. They don't give you an actual plate to eat off of. You get one tiny plate that rests on the grill top that creates a significant distance between your food and your mouth. This inconvenience resulted in many spills. I cannot express how annoying this was.  What's worse, they don't even have shrimp sauce! It is a travesty!! The waitstaff was also very below average, but the busboys were divine. They are so bad ass they pick up the super hot plates off the grill with their bare hands. They also wiped up my area before I ate my dessert so I had a clean eating space.

Both my husband and I have worked in the service industry and typically tip 20% or more. We tipped this waiter 10%. We have tipped this poorly in years.

I'll give you a run down of some things you're likely to experience: - Sticker shock: Ron of Japan is roughly twice the price of other hibachi restaurants. The steak options are $50+ and the portions are smaller - No show: I know most people have made the same comment. While I find the lavish hibachi shows to be annoying at other restaurants, some of the chefs at Ron of Japan are absolutely difficult to be around: they don't talk, smile, or so much as say 'hi'. I wouldn't mind the lack of show as long as the chefs could be friendly -Awkward plating: They have these stone type plates that actually sit on the grill. While they look pretty, we were told we couldn't move them in front of ourselves, so that results in a lot of awkward arm stretching to reach your food  -Beef fried rice: Pretty good, but lacking the flavor of many other hibachi restaurants. The only flavor comes from the ground beef and onion mixture -Limited sushi options: There were about five roll options. I passed, as I wanted more variety -Egg sauce: If you'd like to try this, make sure you order it in advance. It's good, but the portion is too much for me. It's like a buttery egg topper for you to use for your rice. What I like to do is just save a little from my shrimp appetizer and use that on top of my rice -Good quality meat: The filet is quite good. Super tender and doesn't need much seasoning. I've also been told the chicken is super juicy The thing I'm missing the most from Ron of Japan is the flavor. The food is all fine, but they use a little oil, a little pepper, and a splash of soy sauce, and that's it. It just doesn't have the pizazz of many of the other hibachi options.  For what you'll pay taking the train or parking plus the price of the food, I've come to the conclusion that it's just as convenient to head to Northbrook and eat at Benihana.",0.992,0.814,0.142,0.044,0.5273396164021166

Walking in it did look much classier than a typical hibachi place, the seating was circular and very inviting. Our order was taken rather quickly but it did take some time for our chef to get to the table. I will add though that our waitress was incredible, we were somewhat of a picky bunch and she was running back and forth bringing us whatever we needed in a hurry. There is no ""show"" here as there is at many places, so no egg in the hat trick, no onion volcano, no catching shrimp in your mouth. For that, we were all thankful. We got a very large and very hot display of fire at the beginning and that was it. The chef was talkative throughout the meal but not obnoxious. 4/5 of us opted for the fried rice and were told the fried rice was beef only.. the 5th person requested chicken fried rice and was given chicken. The beef fried rice while it was good, was only so due to the large amounts of soy sauce it was drenched in, while the chicken fried rice was delicious. Everyone ordered a little bit differently, but collectively at the table we had chicken, filet, sirloin, and scallops. I had a bite of each but my plate was chicken and scallops. Nothing was really ""stand out"" to me, as I had anticipated it to be. I think my favorite part of the meal was the salad, as it had a creamy garlic ginger dressing as opposed to the average hibachi ginger dressing. I did not by any means have a bad experience, but for all the hype that was put on and raving that was done about it.. I was less than impressed.",0.8779,0.859,0.082,0.059,0.6548682539682538

Anyway, a couple of family members of mine were just RAVING about Ron of Japan and how much they were craving it. In all fairness, I'm always a bit skeptical when someone hypes a restaurant that much (cos they really were hyping it to be the best.food.evar!), so I told them I'd join them the next time they go.  We went this past Saturday, and had reservations for 8pm. We checked in with the hostess and told them everyone in our party was here. First thing we noted was how relatively dead it was. It was Easter weekend after all.  We sat down at their bar/waiting area and started with drinks. We had the ""Super Duper Mai Tai."" It was pretty decent. I'm not a fan of sweet mixed drinks like that so I wasn't expecting to be wowed by the drink. We were sitting there chatting when we realized we had been waiting for over 20 minutes. My brother went to ask them how much longer for our table. The hostess said she was waiting for our entire party to show up. Never mind we told her everyone was there when we arrived...she passed us up at least 4 times when calling other people.  It was about 35 minutes after we arrived that they finally sat us at a table. Luckily, we had our own table (6 of us total). I was told that most of the time they try to squeeze in a full 10 people per table, so maybe they were waiting for others. Regardless, that's silly, especially on a slow night.  Anyway, we all ordered the steak and lobster entree and added extra salads and rice. One entree is more than enough to be shared between 2 people. It's so much food! I really enjoyed the steak, and the eggsauce on the lobster and rice was good. Our chef wasn't too chatty, but was definitely engaging. Our waitress was really nice and was on top of refilling our drinks.  Overall, the food was good, had lots of flavor (especially the steak!), but for the experience it was just okay. Not the most amazing meal I've had, but it's worth checking out.

Now, the biggest name in the game, the WWE, likes to emphasize that they're not wrestling (for some reason), but that they're ""sports entertainment"". Now most hibachi places, where you sit around a chef as they prepare you food, I consider ""food entertainment"". They did not get that memo at Ron of Japan. No egg balancing. No shrimp tossing. No choo-choo train of onions spouting fireworks. No friendly banter from our chef. And also apparently, no time management. After waiting a surprisingly long time for a restaurant that was mostly empty, our chef started to cook - but not our food. See, our tablemates (which I don't get since it wasn't busy at all) decided to order a bunch of extras and sides. More power to them, but it got super awkward as our guy decided to cook all of their food first before moving on to us. Could he at least give us some veggies to distract us while he cooked up their mountain of chow?

I was celebrating my birthday with three friends on the night of October 11th, 2014 and we sat at table 16. Let me start by saying that my whole table received beef fried rice, even though only person out of eight ordered it. One of the guests in my party specifically asked for NO onions in her rice and got exact the opposite. That wasn't the worst thing to happen. At the end of our Shogun dinners the waiter used another persons dirty fork to put my leftover steak and vegetables in my to-go box! Let me also specify it was a good 2/3rd's of my steak! When I confronted the waiter about what he was doing, he simply shrugged his shoulders and said ""sorry, my mistake."" That is completely unacceptable! I have no problem paying for good food but you should've comped a meal or did something to make-up for that big of a mistake, especially when you acknowledged that it was a mistake. Other then that, the food was delicious but my left-overs were ruined which pissed me off. He was lucky to get a 10% tip...",0.4419,0.702,0.153,0.145,0.6021303258145364

If you're looking for a cheesy hibachi experience catered to the 9 year old in all of us, Ron of Japan is not the place for you.  Ron of Japan, instead, tries to be a bit more upscale and focuses more on the food than the show.  I honestly enjoy their food every time I visit.  The egg sauce is great.  Also, normally at a hibachi steakhouse I will purposely order my steak rare when I actually want it medium rare because it's easy to overcook on a flat top.  At Ron of Japan, though, I have found that the chefs pay careful attention to getting the cook just right.  I can definitely respect the intention of Ron of Japan to be more like a fine dining restaurant than a Chuck E Cheese.   The food is great, but I have generally found the rest of the experience to be sub par.  The tables are small and cramped, the reservation times aren't honored very closely, and the servers constantly push drinks on you.  On a visit last week, a bottle of chilled sake  we ordered came out room temperature.  We asked for a chiller, and all was well, but the very same thing happened with the second bottle we ordered.   The worst of it happened when I first walked into the restaurant.  I walked up to the bar to order a drink, and right in front of the service area a customer had vomited on the floor.  By no means would I ever blame the restaurant for the classless individual who puked at a bar.  However, if I hadn't been warned and held back by a friend I would have stepped right in it.  The three girls at the host stand were all too busy chatting it up with each other to warn any of the customers of the puke, and several customers had really close calls while the staff all stared at each other with a ""not my job"" look.  Pretty pathetic.",-0.5528,0.8,0.112,0.088,0.5109835600907029

Emily was very sweet.  I enjoyed the stir fried veggies that came with every meal which had carrots, onions, mushrooms and zucchinis. I hate carrots with passion but they sliced it so thin that I barely tasted it. You can also order veggies without it. The shrimp is my go to dish. They are deveined and always plump and fresh. ROJ teriyaki sauce is a nice blend of soy sauce and sweetness but not gooey-ish. It's light and good with all the dished and over the rice.  Speaking of the rice, I think ROJ has awesome white rice that has a nice chewy consistency and moist.  It's not the cheap, dry kind that falls apart.  Egg Sauce...greasy, yes, but so tasty.  It's made of egg yolk and vegetable oil I think but most of the oil gets cooked off on the grill.  Try it on the shrimp appetizer to see if you like it first, then add or leave it for the main course.    I also want to mention ROJ's sushi a bit.  They have only a few selection: shrimp, king crab, califonia, and tuna roll I think.  King crab roll is so good!  They use real king crab meat, not the imitation.  The rolls are nice bite sized 6 pieces not much bigger than a quarter in diameter so I don't have to stuff it in my face.  They also have tuna and beef sashimi which I'm a bit nervous to try because it's RAW beef.   Friends had sea bass, king crab with the fried rice ($2.50 additional) and they all enjoyed it and said it was fresh. No knife flipping nor shrimp tail tossing during dinner but Chef Peter was very funny and friendly!

(2) Food - quite bland. hibachi for the most part is quite simple in its preparation, so its even more crucial to NOT skip the only hibachi spices/flavor enhancers - ginger, garlic, and soy sauce.

(on a side note I have been to 5 to 7 different hibachi places across the country...none had served this side of heart attack) (4) When you go to a hibachi place, you expect some sort of entertainment. Its a given....you know like expecting the snack kiosks at a movie theater to sell popcorn. Each hibachi establishment I have been to has pretty much the same entertainment routine, but no matter how many times you have seen those tricks, it always fun in the company of friends.

I also asked if I ordered the fried rice, would it be the vegetarian (I currently am not allowed to eat red meat). She didn't respond to me and kept vaguely pointing to the bottom of the menu that listed ""Appetizers"".  It listed beef, chicken or shrimp fried rice. I said I wanted vegetarian but chicken or shrimp is ok. Not surprisingly, the chef cooked beef fried rice for everyone that ordered fried rice so I had to trade with my bf's white rice. He said the fried rice was not very good. Disappointing. The food was pretty good. My bf thought the crab (although delicious just because it was king crab) was bland. Luckily I was sick of the golden sauce at this point and just scraped it off my shrimp and put it on his crab.  No flair. No show. Not even a smile.

The menu's are these plastic orange shells that are really easy to read.  Pick and choose: its that simple.  The people at our table were a HUGE turn off for this experience as well, so if you go, make sure its with enough people (that you like) to fill a whole booth (approx. 8).  Any ways, after the obese man finished ordering extras of everything and coughing all over the place, and the other couples stopped asking questions - we finally got our soup.  I was actually hoping it would have tofu in it, but it was chicken.  Nothing special, but nothing bad.  It was followed by a salad that actually wasn't bad.  The dressing was really good - all be it probably unhealthy.  When it came time to cook up the food, we had one couple complaining about the smoke... UH HELLO they cook the food RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!   Don't get a perm that day and expect steam and smoke not to get in your hair.   The stir fry was ... just stir fry.  Made in increments (I liked this), and plopped on your hot plate, which would be nicer if it was tilted towards you not towards a steaming hot grill.  The food was really nothing special.  The time there wasn't anything special - minus us being there together.  My boyfriend was jipped when it came to dishing out the portions, and even lost a big piece of steak due to negligence of the cook (poor guy).  All in all, its not a good show.  For the money, I know of 50 other places I would of rather gone to that are better.   I consider ROJ the Denny's of Hibachi.",0.9628,0.815,0.119,0.066,0.5572925751497182

I was lucky if i got 3 out of 10 bites into my mouth.  The only thing they have going for them is the fact that they are basically the only hibachi restaurant in the city. I will never eat there again I rather drive 45 minutes to a different one in the suburbs.",-0.8816,0.775,0.093,0.131,0.7533641975308641
2011-01-20,1.0,"""Eek! Methinks not."" is right....  I used to come here with colleagues from work periodically about 10 years ago and it was a great place.  A friend of mine who is also a fan (but of the north suburb location) mentioned to me that I could get a free dinner for my birthday. I registered, printed out my little coupon and was somewhat excited about revisiting this old haunt.  I will NEVER visit this location (and likely not the north suburban location) EVER again.  1 - Empty. Nobody was there. Granted it was a Wednesday. Read on.  2 - My food was salty and bland. The chef was friendly enough but sadly that was his only redeeming quality.  3 - They try to rip people off.  I had the Crown dinner with Scallops  - Chicken noodle soup - bland bland bland...but somewhat peppery  - House salad - bowl of lettuce with a cream dressing that tasted like sesame seeds and fish-sauce. I'm serious...JUST LETTUCE.  - Shrimp Appetizer - These are good - the egg sauce is heavy but its basically egg and butter.  - Veggies - Stir fried - hard to screw up.  - Fried Rice - YUK. Bland. No veggies  - Scallops (Main entree) - Overcooked, soaked in soy sauce, salt was sprinkled all over them. I was not impressed.  - Rocky Road Icecream - They didn't make it - can't screw it up.  So I sat there and thought - wow....this place kinda went to hell since I was here last. We waited for the check.  Now remember that I came in for my FREE birthday entree. I was billed. No biggie - I mentioned to my server that I brought the coupon and gave it to the greeter at the door. She said disappeared with my bill and my credit card. Came back with the same bill with 18% gratuity handwritten into the margin (4 people ... I don't think so) and removed the ~22 dollars for my entree.... but ADDED 25.  We then argued it again, and they came back with a charge slip of 141.00. The original bill was 143, the corrected bill was 117.  It was all finally settled, no gratuity (I added it myself) - But my card was charged for the 141 bill AND the 117 bill and now I have to argue with them about charging me twice for a craptastic experience.  The same occurred to our table mates. They split the tab, one girl paying cash - the other paying with her card. They took the cash AND charged the full amount to the card. I wish I had my phone at the moment - its incredible that they did it to both of us.  NEVER AGAIN NEVER AGAIN - If I could give it negative stars I would.

2011-01-09,4.0,"My daughter from Oklahoma was in town visiting me and since I'd never eaten Japanese food before she wanted to introduce me to a hibachi cooked meal since she is a huge fan of that style of cooking. The main reason I moved to Chicago was to try as many new foods as possible so I was happy to oblige her desire. I asked a friend who's done a lot of eating out and she instantly recommended Ron of Japan.  I'd read the Yelp reviews for Ron of Japan so I wasn't put off at the communal eating situation since there were only 2 in our party and they were trying to accommodate as many patrons as possible on a busy night. It was our lucky night and we got to enjoy our meal with a really great group of people and before long it morphed from being like a table of 3 different parties into a large table of one party where we all enjoyed each others company and shared stories of different dining experiences around town. I'll give the customers of this place a very solid 5 star rating for making what could have been an awkward situation into a very friendly one! If that's what communal eating is all about then I want every meal to be communal! Socially it was a night to remember with fond memories.  As far as our cook goes he was courteous and good at his job. He cooked all of our orders exactly as we'd requested and the food was good. Not something to write home and tell Mom about, but it was a good meal with no complaints from any of us. The only downside to our chef was he very focused on the grill and provided no knife skills to entertain and was very short on communication. The one flavor that I thought absolutely stood out head and shoulders above the others was the egg yolk sauce. That is some pretty darned impressive stuff in my opinion. I know there are lots of other reviewers who adamantly disagree with my assessment of it, but I guess it just goes to show different folks appreciate different flavors and textures.  If it hadn't turned out to be such a fun night socially with our new ""friends"" at the table I'd only give Ron of Japan 3 stars, but the great company we had at our table brings it up another star. I don't see myself rushing right back to eat there in the near future, but I'm sure I will return at some point in the future.",0.9947,0.796,0.169,0.035,0.5730930599798525

2009-11-04,2.0,"I so want to like Ron's, but the current problems obscure what could be.  The original decor could really be used for some great retro or vintage effects - it's pretty well preserved and does add a unique feel to the place.  I like hip and modern, but it's also nice when not every restaurant has to be hip and modern in look and feel.  For example, I love that the menus are shaped like folding orange slices.  I like the 1970's red leather look.  I love the way the vents are adjustable up and down. Service was mixed.  The greeter was an older man who didn't smile and was even a little condescending in tone.  The server, though, was very helpful and friendly.  She made sure the chef knew my dining companion was allergic to shrimp, and was there just the right amount without being overbearing.  The chef didn't smile, didn't show any enthusiasm with cooking, didn't properly clean the griddle (which definitely negatively affects flavors), and cooked things in an inauthentic way.  Watching the chefs at the other tables, I don't think it was just our chef who was the problem. There are basically two glaring issues: 1) The chefs 2) The food They're related, but I'll address them each separately. First, they need new chefs.  The chefs are positively morose. I don't need a Benihana-style performance - I mean, it's fun when they do that, but it's really not particularly authentic nor necessary. HOWEVER they really have to look like they're focused and energetic and interested in cooking the food properly.  I've never been to Japan, but I've had teppan food cooked by Japanese chefs in several places in the U.S., in Panama, and in China, and Ron's are, by a wide margin, the worst of the bunch. How can any chef call himself a chef when he uses a griddle with black, carbonized food on it?  In other places, the chef makes a show of cleaning it down to the steel before beginning.  That's not done for show, that's done to make sure the flavors of the food are pure - and yes, it makes a HUGE difference. I can imagine that in 1970 when this place first opened that Chicagoans needed their Japanese food to be Americanized.  But times have changed, palates have grown more sophisticated, and Americans can handle authenticity - especially when authenticity means better flavors.  Two glaring things come to mind in that vein - first, the fried rice they make is over-soy-sauced and greasy.  In asia, fried rice has little, if any, soy sauce - it's still mostly white when it's done - and very little oil, so that it clumps together some.  Think about it - if you're using chopsticks to eat, you don't want individual, oily grains of rice, you want a bit of clump factor.  Second, one of my favorite parts of the shrimp is the tail.  A good chef will take the tail and fry it in a little butter until crispy - it's delicious.  At Ron's, they just throw them out - what a waste. The vegetables were also cooked more like steamed vegetables than sauteed vegetables.  They came out limp and oily, their flavor sharply compromised by the improperly-cleaned griddle. The steak tasted okay, although you could tell the grill should have been better cleaned.  The chicken was ok except for the flavors from the grill. Second, the food. Some of the problems with the food are because of the Chef, but the shrimp tasted like it had been frozen.  The vegetables, too, weren't exactly the height of freshness - they weren't terrible, but for the price I'd expect better quality. In summary, I understand some people like this place, and it's been around a long time.  But even if we accept their current decor as intentionally kitschy and retro (which I'm happy to do), anyone who thinks that food is worth four or five stars either has never had good Japanese food, or is out of their minds.",0.9991,0.749,0.207,0.044,0.48636341367822844

You're better off lollygagging to a Longhorn steak house rather than missing out on all of the mouth watering seafood action.

By the way when I was like 9 years old I met Mr. T here. He was sitting at a booth in the middle of 5 body guards and said to me ""I pity the fool that don't eat his food"".

2009-10-11,1.0,"As far as I can tell from the reviews, this place is sustained by the nostalgia of its oldest customers that grew up with it. Whatever charm it had back in the good old days has been thoroughly extinguished. This is a depressing little den of thoroughly bland food, heavy, unventilated smoke, shabby decor, charmless servers, and inexplicably high prices. I'm not really a hibachi kind of guy, but our cook managed to make me miss the Benihana experience. He didn't say a word during the entire meal, didn't attempt any tricks, just slowly plodded through the process of grilling our various tasteless food options. On top of all that, the service was very unaccommodating; we couldn't be seated while waiting for our fifth, even though there were plenty of empty tables. Our waitress gave us a big hassle about splitting entrees; she said there was a $5 minimum per person, after she had just served us drinks above that minimum. (We ended up ordering extra appetizers, all of which were as bad as the mains.) She also asked us up front whether one bill was sufficient; basically, she was a pushy salesperson through and through. Please don't go to this restaurant. I'm clearly not the only person to have a lousy time here. They can afford to be this awful only because people continue to blindly return. It's obvious that the place has completely fallen off, and it's been coasting on memories since.

They are angry inside and not cool. Yes we all know it's getting a little pricey, yea the chef doesn't do the standard onion train move, or spin the egg on the spatula, or throw knifes in the air..., yes the ""Japanese soup"" (chicken noodle) is not imported from Osaka, sure we all know the smell is overpowering and you should attempt to change clothes at all costs before going anywhere after dinner, yes this isn't going to be a ""low cal"" meal...get over it, and dude with the romantic ron of japan candle lit dinner for two who was appalled and walked out...everyone knows you're going to get paired up other people, relax..............I offer you this.....SO???????  Ron of Japan is a Chicago land staple and should be included in every ones restaurant rotation about once every month and a half. It is delicious, fun, nostalgic, and awesome.  Skimpy on the food? Steak doesn't taste good? I dare you to tackle this order and tell me you were not happy and full...  Water, Super Mai Tai, Fillet Crown Dinner (soup, salad, white rice, shrimp, fillet) and desert  And here are some veteran tips...write this down.  1. dip everything is the super secret awesome terriyaki/soy sauce and lick the salad bowl clean if you have to...its ok...it's the BEST dressing in the world...we understand  2. say YES to the egg sauce, and keep ordering it through out the meal (you can do that). It is yellow magic. For example, when your white rice comes...don't just say ""oh sweet, white rice, this looks plain and boring""...ask the chef for a little side of egg sauce. once it's ""cooked"" and ready, dump it on your rice then ask the chef for a little extra of the super secret awesome terrikayki/soy sauce to throw on top. Mix it around and BAM!... you will thank me later.  3. Debate another mai tai  4. Be social and talk with the other people at the table...its fun  5. Don't forget about the fried rice option...some people like it...i think its a little to meaty.  6. Debate another mai tai  7. don't forget about desert...2 words....fresh pineapple  8. absolutely don't forget about a doggy bag option (take some of your new found delicious rice concoction left over, throw some of your extra steak and throw it on top, and wrap it up. you'll thank me when your drunk at 2:32 am  If your feeling a little crazy, then make a move on the lobster tail, sumo beef or kobe beef, or get weird with a crown combo...its your dime your dance floor.  So if your looking some fancy, healthy, non smelly, modern, cheap, boring hibachi experience with the dude banging his knifes on the table and flicking chicken in his hat... then don't come to our gem of a restaurant...we don't want you. The Ron of Japan crew is a tight nit unit and we are very sensitive to our crown dinners and egg sauce. I think i speak for every loyal patron when I say, I would put egg sauce in my water if my doctor allowed it.  So call your friends, go make a ron's run...and have fun out there.  Of and if you're looking for bridges and bean sprouts, head to northbrook...you 5 star people know what I'm talking about.....",0.9969,0.781,0.164,0.056,0.545050923311793

We got our soup and salad courses and when it came time to start frying up some skrimps, they let us know that the grill was out of order in our table but that they had another table for us to move to.  Well, we moved, but this seems odd that the table wasn't working when we had to wait for an open table and someone had already eaten there. Anyway, we moved and then the frying began.  As someone below points out they put this egg sauce on the skrimps.  Let's be honest here, it sucks.  What made it worse was that the other two in our party ordered EXTRA shrimps and ended up getting MORE of it.  They said the shrimp just didn't cut it and they were a bit disappointed.  MK even tried one (hold our breath) and she couldn't even cut it with her fork, which just screams OVER COOKED SHRIMP!!!

But since there's no show, you end up having to talk to the other groups at the table with you. Drinks are about $8 or $9, but pretty tasty and strong",0.9837,0.716,0.225,0.059,0.5359375000000001
2007-04-05,1.0,"Worst $40 I have ever spent at a restaurant. My friend dragged me here when his vegetarian wife was out of town. Absolutely tasteless food. This is suburban America's conception of Japanese food, circa 1985 ...and even in that class of restaurant, Benihana is better. My suggestion, wait to go see your married friends in the suburbs and go there. You can even get a little Karaoke in.

2007-03-30,3.0,"It's ok if this is your kind of thing. I think it's vastly overpriced. And having lived in Japan, I can tell you it's not remotely Japanese (except for the rice). I also found it to be a bit confusing. The server cooked different bits of the meal at the same time, so some of us were eating appetizers, and some were eating the main part. We also didn't get the meat part with the veggies.",0.0772,0.945,0.03,0.026,0.4822916666666667
2007-03-09,4.0,"I think that I have such a strong affiliation with this place becuase I first visited it when I was 5 and apparently ordered a Gin and Tonic.  When the waitress told me I wasn't old enough to have Gin, I told her that I'd be fine with just the tonic.  Besides that heartwarming story, I love this place!  The food is always great and I especially LOVE the ""special yolk sauce"" that they provide.  Based on experience, I would stick with white rice as opposed to their fried rice.  Most of my companions that I go with (as well as myself) don't like the fried.  Other than that, you feel as though you've been in a tme warp with the decor and the people that work there.  Its just a funny rare thing to do in Chicago.

2007-03-08,3.0,"I remember going to this place with the family when I was younger. The place hasnt changed too much. Still looks pretty much the same, same old dirty carpet. The food was mediocre. I had the filet and shrimp crown combination. Appetizers was vegetibles and shrimp. The veggies were kinda bland. But I like the shrimp and the filet. I thought the portions were rather small though. I remember going there last year and  I had the lobster tail and sirloin combo for 57.95. It was well worth it. And I love that egg yolk sauce they put on the shrimp and the lobster tail. The beef fried rice was pretty good as well. Service wasnt too bad, but the place was pretty dead. Maybe 2 other tables.",0.8044,0.787,0.155,0.058,0.4845833333333334

2007-01-21,3.0,Delicious Shrimp with egg battered yolk!!! The meat was tender and flavorful......BUT  make sure you have reservations..the wait can get really long on the weekend....just like Amanda K.  we  came in a large group with reservations and we also got split up and one group had to wait an hour and 40 mins longer to get seated. If you sit with your friends you can have a good time. The Chef was excellent...beware the valet here is horrible....The food is good if you can deal with the service.,0.9537,0.814,0.186,0.0,0.6529100529100529

However, the restaurant is very crowded and quite small. Since we came in a large group, the host had to split us up. Half of us had to wait an hour after the other half was seated...AND we made reservations. Oh and one more thing, it was my birthday and all they gave me was a song in Japanese and the top of a pineapple. It wasn't even edible. Boo.",0.9565,0.819,0.181,0.0,0.34549319727891153

2006-11-19,3.0,$10 valet parking.  One hour wait with a reservation but got comp'd a round of drinks.   Fabulous hibachi food and decent service.  Must get the shrimp appetizer and beef fried rice with the egg sauce that zips you from 0-60 in artery clogging in less than 6 second.  Do get the fillet!  Lobster is a must! Do NOT get the calamari - way too fishy and all people at the table agreed.

2006-02-08,3.0,"If you're a hibachi fan, the food here is very good.  The chefs are hit and miss, but the quality of meat is great...except for the meat they put in the fried rice. Ground beef that is nothing but white usually means nasty, so I asked for veggie rice on my first visit. I also asked for some hot mustard, and the chef whipped some up and it was AMAZING.  The next time I visited, asked for the same thing. We had a party of six, seated with a party of two. The chef said no, the hostess backed him up...no Veggie rice on weekends.  We were the last seating of the night, and it was NOT very crowded...they could have accomodated.  So that hacked me off.  Then i asked for the hot mustard and they claimed not to have any, in spite of the fact that just two weeks prior, the same chef made it for me (oh, believe me, we tipped him well that first time...). Then he suddenly ""found"" the mustard powder. too late, cost him 10 percent.   Service is hit or miss, the decor is right out of the 70's, but that is kinda cool  The egg batter is the best I've ever had.  Cool place but you WILL smell of cooking oil. Don't wear suede or leather.  Limited bar, lousy mai tais.",0.6847,0.775,0.124,0.102,0.42573498964803314
