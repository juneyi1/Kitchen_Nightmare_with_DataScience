2016-09-28,2.0,"My husband and I have lived in Roscoe Village for the last 2 years and we have gone to Piazza Bella over a dozen times. Tonight we looked at their website and they had a delivery menu listed - we had a rough day and decided to try delivery. Strike 1 was when I called and they rudely told me they don't do delivery and I needed to contact Grubhub. I proceeded to create an order on Grubhub and selected the potato gnocchi. However I'm pregnant and avoiding Gorgonzola so I substituted the Gorgonzola sauce for the tomato cream sauce. We also ordered a pizza. Strike 2, my Grubhub driver delivered our order and it was readily apparent that the pizza was missing. She told us she asked the restaurant twice if our order included a pizza and was told it didn't. The Grubhub driver generously offered to go back and pick up the pizza. After opening our food we then realized the gnocchi was wrong as well - it had the Gorgonzola cream sauce. I called the restaurant and explained what had happened. They told me Grubhub must have messed up the order but offered to make a new one. Strike 3, when the Grubhub driver returned to pick up the order they told her that since she had delivered the incorrect food already they would not give her a new gnocchi order. My only recourse would be to contact Grubhub and get a refund. I didn't want a refund, I wanted to eat what I had ordered for dinner. I did contact Grubhub who confirmed that Piazza Bella had in fact received the correct order and had just messed it up. How and why Piazza Bella would not take responsibility for the mistake and send me a correct order is beyond me but shows a true lack of customer service. Good food can only get you so far, it's customer service that makes a customer want to return.",-0.7695,0.883,0.039,0.078,0.5641098484848485

The bartender started playing loud dance tunes from a Pandora station mid-meal (I know because we heard commercials periodically) and we could barely keep a conversation going across our table at times. Everyone mostly enjoyed their meals. The asparagus and fried calamari appetizers pleased everyone. Someone said the pasta sauce tasted semi-sweet (I agree). Another person remembered more meat in the bolognese dish.  After our meal, the waiter boxed up our food, then disappeared without delivering the check. Another waiter counted money at a nearby table but ignored our requests for assistance (or maybe he couldn't hear us over the dance music?).

Our waiter was fantastic: very friendly, very knowledgeable, and attentive to just the right degree. For instance, my girlfriend was eyeing one of the specials, which was Chilean sea bass with shrimp in a lobster sauce, but she didn't really want the bass. The waiter suggested that she choose another fish, and the chef could prepare it in the same manner. She chose salmon. Well, it was wonderful. The combination of that lobster sauce with the salmon was perfect. The salmon itself was delicious, but if you swirled a piece in the lobster sauce first, you got this incredible two-stage taste experience, where you initially tasted mostly the lobster sauce, but then that melted away into the taste of the salmon itself. Just great! I had another of the night's specials, rack of lamb with a Marsala sauce, with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. This, too, was excellent. Even though the lamb was cooked medium (on lamb, I usually prefer medium-rare), I have no complaints; it was still wonderfully moist, tender, and full of flavor. The seasonings and sauce were outstanding, as were the side dishes.  As an appetizer we had some baked polenta topped with a portabella and oyster mushroom sauce and some shaved cheese (which I believe was either Parmesan or Romano).  Although a large portion, it was light and rather fluffy; it made a perfect, non-filling appetizer. The mushrooms on the top were the best part, with a full, rich flavor.  At the end of the meal, (probably because it was New Year's Eve; I don't suppose this happens every night) the waiter brought us free chilled shots of Limoncello, an Italian lemon liqueur.

The supposed glaze on the steak didn't come through at all.  It also had a few big fatty tendons running through it.  The asparagus and potatoes that came with it were severely disappointing, just boiled, unseasoned cut up baby red potatoes and chopped up miniscule pieces of asparagus thrown together.  I made this concoction at home better last week with some leftover porkchops.  $28 The gnocchi wasn't much better--- an overly rich cream sauce with pieces of gnocchi.

2014-06-10,4.0,"I take everything back I said in my last review.  This place has undergone a significant update and transformation and I really like what they have done!  The menu has an entire new look -- slimmed down and more interesting pasta options.  Agnolotti stuffed with short ribs -- amazing. Ravioli with sausage and fennel -- amazing.  Spaghetti carbonara -- a really nice update to an older dish.  Yes they got rid of a few items that you would expect at an Italian restaurant, but those were some of the exact items that were becoming so predictable and boring.  Love the fact that if they have the ingredients on hand you can even go off menu for a custom dish.  Staff is as attentive and friendly as ever.  Interior is painted a moody dark blue which may not seem Italian but it creates a great atmosphere.  They gave up the lounge next door -- smart move on their part.   So happy to see the changes and will definitely frequent this place more often.",0.9918,0.722,0.245,0.033,0.47925910894660895

It is really hard to find a place that can actually use the right consistency in their Italian sauces. Portions are huge and we always end up taking food home. Service is great. They can be kind of corny at times but it adds a nice level of humor and personality to the place.  I'm always excited to go back.

The service was on par with most restaurants and given that we dined on Valentine's Day (Friday as well), I thought it was above average.

Our server informed us they recently had a change in chef(s) and also a significant change in the menu.

2013-12-18,3.0,"I feel my three star review is actually quite generous given how hit or miss Piazza Bella can be. I was excited that there was a neighborhood Italian place since I moved away from my beloved Caro Mio, but Piazza Bella does not even compare.  I've dined at Piazza Bella for brunch and dinner. Their brunch service is decent, it is a buffet. No major issues with the food or service, and the price is pretty good. Also, you usually don't have to wait to have brunch unlike the other popular brunch establishments in the neighborhood.  Dinner however, is a completely different story. The dishes range from ""not bad"" to ""wtf is this?"". On my most recent visit, a pasta dish was ordered that you could add shrimp to for an additional $6. We waited almost 45 minutes for the food to arrive, and when it did the pasta dish had three shrimp on it. That's $2 dollars a shrimp folks! Insane. The pizza I had was fine...this time. A later visit I was given pizza with dough that was not completely cooked. Some dinner pluses include the lasagna. My mom ordered it when visiting me and she loved it. I tried it and it was pretty good.  So you see, by eating at Piazza Bella, you take a risk. A risk of having to wait ages for food, being disappointed in the food, and paying too much for the food. Or, it could turn out just fine and you have a lovely lasagna and wine. So if you aren't too picky or you're too lazy to go get decent Italian food, Piazza Bella may be worth the risks.",0.9825,0.77,0.157,0.073,0.5641666666666668

2013-12-13,1.0,"Where do I begin? Why isn't there a ""no"" star rating? I have been patronizing this eatery since it opened years ago.  That was a more pleasant time with superb food, warm and welcoming staff and a place where the owners remembered your name. But then new management took over. Since that time, their overly expensive and very forgettable menu, lost me as a customer. I used to eat there once a week and then get delivery about the same. It was SO worth it! Fresh food, perfectly seasoned, great service and very knowledgeable staff. The new owners had big shoes to fill and they failed and failed some more. A week ago, I ordered food for delivery and two hours later was still waiting. I spoke to Lupe and he was apologetic and said he would return the cost of the meal, which he did. He also said that he would comp my next order. Great! So I ordered delivery last night. Carpaccio, eggplant/potato appetizers, fusili, thin crust Margherita Pizza and a cannoli. It arrived in the time promised but as soon as I opened the bag I knew this was going to be a disaster. Wrong pizza, which was a soggy salty mess laden with ingredients that had nothing to do with my order. The eggplant appetizer was totally wrong, Caprese salad was substituted for carpaccio (there was none to be had in the house), the fusili was an over cooked salty, mushy mess. In short, the entire meal was inedible. The cannoli was a cloyingly pasty puddle of goo that was obviously not fresh. When I initially called to speak with Lupe to make sure that he remembered his promise to comp my meal I was told by the phone person that he had gone home for the night, so she took the order (she was also the same employee who took my botched order several days before). When I called back to let her know about the latest order being a nightmare, I asked for Lupe and she said he was busy. What? In short, a disorganized, unknowledgeable staff, overcooked and over salted food and an eatery that thought that  it could ride the coat tails of the original owners and the stellar reputation they established.

My friend loves marinara and asked for a liberal portion of it on his rigatoni.  Well, evidently the meat sauce is just meat, no real 'sauce' to speak of (maybe that's authentic Italian, but if you want marina, the rigatoni is not your dish).  So all of that is annoying but here's the worst part.  The lasagna tasted like something was wrong with it - spoiled cheese or something.  I wanted to send it back but my friend was tired of waiting and didn't want to wait for them to make another entrée - he gave me his meal and didn't eat.  Not that it would have even been easy to send it back because nobody ever came by to ask how the food was. Later, our waiter inquired whether I would like another glass of wine - but still no worries about whether we liked the food, even though the lasagna sat barely touched.  When he asked if we wanted a dessert menu, we advised that something was not right with the lasagna and he took it off the bill.  Oh and no, no dessert menu necessary. When I started this review, I clicked three stars because past experiences were better, but based on this outing, I just can't give more than two.",0.971,0.744,0.154,0.102,0.5569327731092437

When I asked him to please switch out my wine (read on for details) for a different kind, he politely obliged without an attitude. I am grateful for this, as I was uncomfortable asking (but desperate). GRUB-  The caprino fritto was excellent. Delicious blend of goat cheese and herbs and toasted to a perfect golden. This goat cheese ""patty"" was served on top of a tomato sauce with some capers scattered about. The crostini smothered in this stuff was good. Good quantity, good value. The gnocchetti con 4 formaggi was pretty good.

I live nearby and have wanted to try this place for a long time.  It's cute, the menu looked good, and it's close to my apt.  So on a Saturday evening, my date and I stopped by for an early dinner.   It was cold, we walked in the awkward entrance (lack of lobby) and the young hostess asked if we had a reservation; I said no; and immediately, she shuttled us back out into the cold, saying ""follow me.""  No explanation.  I asked if we came in the right entrance and she said yeah, but this is a separate door.  Huh?  What the H is going on here... We walked in through a new door, just feet down the street from the main restaurant's door, and entered what appeared to be a completely separate business - a lackluster sports bar with TVs on the wall, high-top tables, and a bar.  No warmth, no ambiance.  This is not the semi-romantic restaurant that I had intended on visiting; this was a sports bar that served Piazza's menu.   We sat, confused about everything that had just happened, but this is the point where we should have just left.  We gave the food a shot.  Table bread was warm and crusty and I started with a delicious creamy potato/broccoli soup.  Entrees were not so good.  My fettuccine with vegetables and garlic/butter/white wine sauce was just plain ...plain, and flavorless and something I know I could better prepare myself at home.  Tiramisu was also not that great - and again, we recalled the last time we made this at home, and our results being equal or superior.  (I'm not THAT great of a cook either... I'm just saying, while paying moderately high restaurant prices, I expect better quality.) Servers were very friendly and quick with water refills.  At the end of the meal, I asked about the separate bar/lounge, and the waiter informed us that they use this space on the weekends (when very busy?).  Weird.  I won't be returning.",0.9477,0.819,0.108,0.073,0.5590368996083281

Also, when I come in with one other person and you tell me there's a 20 minute wait when I see three 4-tops open, it just pisses me off. - I live in Roscoe Village. I love Roscoe Village. But there are some times/places I don't want your children screaming at the top of their lungs in the same room as me. And that time is a date NIGHT out at a ""nice"" Italian restaurant. The last time this happened, I thought I was on some hidden camera show. This was not an upset, crying baby.

A 200 yard walk to piazzabella.  I've walked there with my young girls frequently and after each bad experience Ive taken a break from giving them my business, yet todays bad experience caused me to write my first  review. Today  I ordered a large cheese pizza and went to pick it up .. Total $16.46 and I provided the gal $17 cash, waited for my change, and she said ""we don't provide change in the restaurant"".   Surprised, I thought that very odd since 1) I've received change there in the past (though occasionally i just say ""keep it"" as I'm made to think I'm really putting a strain on the staff to do their job), and 2)  aren't you supposed to provide change for product or service rendered, as a general business rule? So I placed the pizza back on the counter, asked for my $17 back, walked out and ordered pizza from Dagastinos ... Much better experience, and a better value. The arrogance I experienced by Piazza Bella over the years is completely amazing.  There have been other times when I had the same ""change issue"" and I pushed back enough to make them go get my fifty cents (or so) of change.  Is it like a game for them, to see if customers just whimper and walk away?   I saw my neighbor on my walk home and he has faced the same issue many times there.  Maybe it's an expected tip by the young gal who got my pizza?  maybe she assumed that because I had my two young daughters with me that I couldn't be bothered and would just walk away from the 54 cents?  The money wasn't the point, it was the statements made and the incredulous look I was given, as if to say ""don't bother me with this petty chore of getting change for you"".  And no, they weren't busy as it was only 530pm.

I had the lasagna and while it was a bit overdone, it was good.  My other had the stuffed chicken with mushrooms plus, and loved it.  Based on the meal I would have given the place four stars. The liquor pricing is poor.  In most restaurants you get a favorable discount if you buy a bottle of wine verses a glass.  However when you do the math at Piazza Bella, there is almost no cost break between a bottle and a glass.  We did order a bottle of wine and requested a cooler to keep it cold.  Here is my only bad comment, the female bartender ignored our server twice when he asked for a cooler.  She was paying total attention to her male clients that were sitting at the bar, and only responding to the servers when she made time.  I understand this is what she does to pat her tips, but it is at the cost of the service for the rest of the restaurant.",0.5927,0.898,0.062,0.04,0.5775297619047618

But on the basis of this one meal, there's almost nothing to recommend the place.  First of all, it smells terrible. What is that, mold? Offgassing plastic? Burning mops? Yech. Service is not the biggest issue for me, but it's not a good feeling to be ignored. Sure, the Kentucky Derby was on, but you know what, waiter dude? You're at work. I don't get to watch sports all day at my job, and neither do you. But really, the food reminds me why going to Italian restaurants can be a total waste of money. Our group of four had two pastas, a pizza, and a risotto. The pastas obviously came from a Sysco truck--and all the black pepper in the world couldn't bring them to life. The little bowl of cheese on the table, which might have helped, had all the flavor of sawdust, too--like it had been grated by a machine in the '90s. The risotto was next to flavorless--and the texture made me fairly certain that it had been microwaved from a box. If these dishes were in fact made by people, those people were either asleep, incompetent, or also invested heavily in the Derby outcome. Why does it matter if the food was made by hand? It's the prices, stupid. I can eat Chef Boyardee with the best of them, but that stuff runs about a buck a can--not $15 to $20. Paying the markup in order to be ignored and disgusted by that smell (really, what is that??) is something I'm NOT going to do again.

2012-04-03,2.0,"We visited Piazza Bella twice.  The first time we were absolutely enchanted with it.  It was a Friday night and we had no problem getting a table without a reservation (I was shocked!).  Our server was attentive, really knowledgeable about the specials and menu and also what wine would be affordable but great with out menu choices.  The food took an appropriate amount of time to come out and everything was delicious.  Since we were celebrating, our server gave us complimentary limoncello shots and even had one herself.  That made me feel welcomed and like the atmosphere is truly your ""neighborhood joint.""  If I hadn't gone back a second time, this would easily be a 4-5 star review. The next time we visited was a Saturday with reservations.  It was packed but that's not a bad sign in my eyes.  Our server was prompt to give us menus, but that's where the good service ended.  There were two tables with young children behind us.  One table had a slightly fussy baby, but one of the diners walked the baby around the dining room to soothe them, no big deal.  The table behind them however had a screamer.  The type of scream that was so shrill and painful that is bores into your brain and you can't think straight.  Even more painful as I was coming off a sinus infection, not the baby's fault but it didn't help.  Another diner as they were leaving even walked up to the table to say what a disturbance their child caused.  Our appetizer (delicious, wonderful, baked goat cheese!) took a good long time to come out, so we devoured it in no time flat.  We sat with dirty, empty plates for another 20 minutes until our server came back to see what we'd like as an entree.  The whole time we tried to get his attention but when he wasn't with other tables, he was against the bar on his phone.  I can understand being busy with your other tables and our service is slower, but if you have time to text or putter with your phone, you can take my entree order.  Our entrees came out in 5 minutes.  That's a little disturbing to me.  I've worked in kitchens (FOH and BOH), 5 minutes for 4 entrees is alarmingly quick.  Everything tasted fine, but not worth the price.  Again, the fact that it took 5 minutes for entrees to hit the table makes you dubious about freshness.  If it isn't that fresh, why are the prices so high?  After we had finished it was another 20 minutes of being ignored before the bill was dropped off.  The whole time the screaming child did what they do best, screamed.  So waiting the extra time, while you see your server on his phone at the bar, having your conversations and sanity interrupted by shrill screams is no picnic.  I don't care how amazing the food is at that point, you're going to have a bad time. Unfortunately, the second experience put us off Piazza Bella for good.  I don't begrudge parents a night out with their kids.  I do get mad when nothing is done about unruliness (adult or child).  I get mad when I'm ignored.  I get mad when I'm paying good money for a dinner that doesn't match up to the price point.  It makes me sad because I love visiting local business and I'm eager to give them first crack at my patronage.  Thankfully, Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen in Chicago.",-0.6033,0.719,0.133,0.148,0.52484126984127

I ordered a calzone with mushrooms and roasted red peppers and my husband had the tortellini with proscuittio and peas. The calzone took a little while to bake, but the waitress told us that when it was ordered. The calamari was perfect - fried and not at all rubbery. The dipping sauce had a nice little kick to it. My calzone was huge. The ingredients tasted fresh. The only con was that I thought the tomato sauce was a little too sweet. The tortellini were cooked well, and the sauce was very rich. Our total bill (which included 2 glasses of wine) ran us about $60, which I thought was a bit expensive.

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the bottom line was that there was 1 (one!) server for our entire half of the restaurant.  The poor guy did such a fantastic job though.  As soon as we sat down, he gave us a heads up on the situation and that the kitchen would be running slower since it accommodates both sides, etc. But like I said, we were in no hurry so our group didn't mind and were totally understanding. This was quite some time ago now (early Feb) so I can't remember exactly what I ordered, but I know it came with homemade Italian sausage, a creamy tomato sauce, peas  and rigatoni pasta.  And it was insane.  Our group was ooh'ing and ahh'ing throughout the meal.  And because the kitchen was behind, the bread that came to our table came out piping hot each time. Silver lining. It's definitely worth mentioning that our gracious server (seriously, was so cool under pressure of handling 10 + tables with little to no help) may have ""mistakenly"" hooked us up big time for our troubles.  We were not charged for either bottle of wine we ordered.  We tipped him generously.  A scenario that could have left some people fuming went perfectly smooth thanks to him.  He recognized the unfortunate situation and still took care of us.  Awesome customer service!  I wish I could remember his name.  I blame the wine.",0.9905,0.728,0.179,0.092,0.5350694444444444

The place is very warm & cozy with some high top tables in the front across from the bar and then some regular seating in the back. The service was fantastic. Our server was over right away and he was very sweet & friendly. My friend asked if the Bears game could be put on and he took care of it right away. Then he was back within minutes with our bottle of wine, providing recommendations on appetizers. Try the asparagus and the bruschetta, both super yummy. They also bring you an assortment of rolls fresh out the oven - it was hard not to fill up on those before dinner. I loved the pasta I ordered for dinner. It had a pink sauce with mushrooms, peas, and they let me substitute the chicken for shrimp. It was a rich dish, but I was craving some comfort food on that chilly Sunday night so it was perfect. The portion size, as it always seems to be at Italian places, was huge so I had plenty for dinner the next day too. As I said before, the service really was fantastic and made the experience here that much better. The bus boy was literally over every 5 minutes refreshing our water & clearing plates. And when we finished the bottle of wine, it didn't take our server more then 2 minutes to come over and ask if we wanted another (he also comped us the 2nd bottle, which was a completely unexpected, but much appreciated surprise). At the end of the meal, our server made a point of introducing us to the manager, who said next time you stop in, just ask for me and I'll make sure we take care of you. Love that kind of attention to the customers!  Although it's fall now, I am anticipating spring already and enjoying the stellar service and delish food out on their sidewalk patio. Fingers crossed it's a short winter (yeah right, it is Chicago after all).",0.9985,0.752,0.237,0.011,0.5347973989834456

Not a big issue, but I definitely noticed. All was forgiven though when he brought us shots on the house at the end. The last two times we had Jeff, who did a great job. My wife came home last Wednesday night and said as she passed by the restaurant, Jeff had said hello, and we had to go in for dinner. This time we requested him, and had another great time. I had the lemon chicken, and I can't stop thinking about. My wife on the other hand can't stop thinking about the waiter.

Secondly, they placed my wife and I and are friends without kids with us, in the middle of three tables with four kids. This just fails the hostess test in my mind. I don't mind kids in restaurants, but in this layout, with two sides to this place, shouldn't need to battle these issues.

Has it really been almost eleven years since this restaurant opened?  I've lived in Roscoe Village on and off since 1997 and for some reason I put these guys on my meh list. I was wrong.  Dead wrong. I had the Bucatini alla Matriciana (Bucatini pasta with bacon, sweet onions, tomatoes and black pepper sautéed in white wine and herbs) because I cook a lot and I use bacon frequently as my go-to meat to add flavor. I really liked it.  I had a meal that I would have been pleased to have prepared for other people.  Add in nice ambiance, tasty bread, and a solid timely plate of calamari and we were quite happy. I ate a few pieces of my boy's pizza, and liked it too. I want to try some other dinner entrees, my interest is piqued. I think I have to re-calibrate my view of Roscoe Village restaurant patrons.  I think honestly I've avoided a number of restaurants in RV because the patrons look... well... sloppy.  Walking into a place in Bucktown like Antico feeds my inner picture of what fine restaurants are like.   Last night I gave in, I wore cargo shorts, a Yellowstone t-shirt and Skechers that some folks think are actually indoor slippers.  And we had a great meal in a nice appointed place called Piazza Bella Trattoria.  I'll be back, I might even wear a college sweatshirt next time.

Both were excellent, especially the tortellini. Portions were large enough for both of us to take left overs home. We were both very full after the main course but we were having such a good time that we decided to stick around and have a drink and split an order of their gelato. I'm definitely glad that we did... OMG if  you're as much of a gelato fan as I am you HAVE to try their hazelnut gelato. As I savored  each bite and looked out at their veranda, I could have sworn I was back in the old country!!!  Ohh... don't forget to pick up a couple of the caramelle (italian candy) on your way out... last time I had seen those was in a little shop in Sicily as a little kid... brought back lots of memories. We couldn't help but smile from ear to ear as we were leaving. Can't wait to go back! A Presto!!",0.9799,0.85,0.125,0.025,0.48103705118411

Love the outdoor seating area in the summers.

Try the lemoncello at the end of your meal too. Desert is delish and so is their espresso!  True Italian experience!",0.9821,0.716,0.269,0.016,0.6217948717948717
2010-09-17,1.0,"Been going here since I first moved to Roscoe Village in 1998, it used to be my go to place for Italian. Loved the lasagna, however it has been going down hill over the last few visits, and I will never again go back after the last visit. It started out good and went to hell fast. At first the service was up to par, we ordered our drinks and got them. I ordered the soup of the day and quickly got that. We ordered our food, gnoci for the wife and lasagna for me.  This is where it started to take a turn for the worse. A friend of the staff came in, he smelled like he had been harvesting pot for the last few days, the staff were more than thrilled this goof was here. They seemed to forget that actual paying customers were in attendance. They talked and chatted, he disappeared with the staff, a few minuets later they were back to the front laughing and having a good time. Meanwhile no one checked to see how we were doing, if they had I would have showed them the dried out hunk  of lasagna that came with my dish, which I now believe was just store bought and microwaved. The recipe is not the same as it was.  Our plates were cleared and we ordered desert, which was supposed to be a delicious funghetto, instead we got a stale pastry with freezer burnt gelato. Really?? WTF!!! This monstrosity was delivered took 1 bite and that was it, the server never came by to ask how it was, instead she decided to hang out with Pothead McGee in the front, I have been in the restaurant business my entire life, and would never ever serve that crap. You could see the ice crystals on top of the gelato, the pastry was as hard as a rock. To the servers credit the goof in the front was definitely more important than us. She never asked how it was and she could clearly see the look of disgust and the 1 bite missing. 10 minuets later we got our bill and before she could say anything off she went. Another few minuets and finally she came to take the bill we showed her the disgusting dessert and she did take it off the bill, but acted like ""wow how'd that happen"" we spent $55 on a horse shit meal, I will never go back to Piazza Bella as I would rather walk the extra few blocks to Frasca.",0.7437,0.855,0.081,0.065,0.40623456790123463
2010-08-23,2.0,"I want to say I liked this place, I really do. It's the kind of place I usually love, it serves food that I usually love. I did not, however love this place. We started off with a ""Calamari e gamberi alla griglia su un letto di Misticanza  ~ Grilled calamari and shrimp served on a bed of mixed greens (from the menu)"" at thirteen dollars for a hot appetizer. This was actually a salad with 3 shrimp and 5 pieces of minuscule calamari. It was cold, and possibly the mixed greens turned out to be a gigantic pile of salad slathered in too much oil and vinegar. Particularly too much vinegar. It was the most acidic thing I have ever eaten outside of a dare to drink a glass of lemon juice.  Next I had the ""Pizza Quattro stagioni - 4 seasons  ~ Tomatoes, artichoke, prosciutto, and black olives"" at 16 dollars. There is no mention that each element will only take place on 2 pieces, and perhaps I am ignorant to this pizza if it is standard elsewhere, but I didn't know. This made for a a quarter of my pizza being totally covered in prosciutto, which sounds nice in theory but made for a really *really* salty couple of bites. Add this to the underwhelming artichoke hearts, black olive (like every other black olive pizza you have ever had... boring), and invisible tomatoes (3 slices, under the cheese. It looked like I just had a quarter cheese pizza) and what you had was a perfectly mediocre pizza made with a nice selection of ingredients.  My girlfriend liked her ""Pizza Quattro Formaggi  ~ Gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, goat cheese, and fontinella"" just fine. Nothing complicated, nothing hard. Just melted cheese equally spread around. Details: The bread that showed up was hot, and pretty good. The water came regularly. The waitress was nice, and helpful, and timid. She would walk away about 5 feet, turn around and ask us a question that she could have easily asked while standing at the table the first time. This wasn't a problem and certainly was entertaining as we were sitting outside and could see her turn around before she made it to the front door. I may go back, but probably only if someone else really wants to go.",0.995,0.82,0.159,0.021,0.5462248635718024
2010-08-10,4.0,"Coming to Piazza Bella for lunch on a breezy summer afternoon is one of my favorite things to do.  You could spend an entire day sitting out on their beautiful front patio and watching people walk by while enjoying one of their amazing meals.  The neighborhood is awesome and the people are friendly.  Their bread and olive oil is of better quality.   Their calzones at luch are ENORMOUS! I've only ever tried a calzone from Pizza Hut and I never really enjoyed them but this one blew it out of the water.  All the ingredients were fresh, the mozarella was oozing out when i cut into it.  The crust is deliciously light and full of flavor.  More than enough for one meal.   The Pinino Caprese was light and very fresh as well.  One of the best capreses I've ever tasted and their fries were plentiful.  The only reason I'm taking a star off is because the service is not that great.  Every time I come for lunch I wander through the restaurant (which is a ghost town for some reason) and stop short of knocking on the kitchen door to find someone to seat us with menus.  Other than that it's a solid restaurant.  It's a little too pricey for me for dinner but you definitely get more than what you pay for if you go for lunch.",0.9705,0.778,0.157,0.064,0.6351851851851852
2010-08-05,3.0,"*sigh* I don't know how to feel about this place. It is right down the street from me so I was VERY excited to check it out. I've been back three times now and it has been half great/half not so great.  The first time I went I took my Mom, Aunt and boyfriend. I started with a great fresh grilled vegetable plate (very good except the eggplant, too tough) followed by the lasagna. Holy moly, that stuff is THICK. So heavy but I really enjoyed it. I could only finish a few bites but the leftovers tasted just as good. Everyone liked their items a lot (I can't remember which pasta dishes my Mom and Aunt got but they were happy!) and BF had the calzone. He loved it! We had a really sweet waitress and overall a great first experience. I thought I would be a regular here for sure.  Next time I brought my two best friends. I had the four cheese pizza and it was very good. It had a lot of flavor and all of my favorite cheeses! Mmmm.. One BF had the fettuccine with a lot of vegetables. She really liked hers and had no problem finishing it. The other BF had the ravioli and did not really care for it. She didn't think there was enough of the actual raviolis and all in all, not for her. Oh well! We had good service and a great time overall minus that.  The third and last time I was there I was on a date with my dear boyfriend. =D We sat outside since it was a beautiful summer night. Too bad it ended there. He had the lasagna and it was  good once again. I tried the rigatoni with mushrooms, sausage, and peas  in a tomato cream sauce. It was awful. Inedible. This is not an exotic dish and this is usually my favorite type of thing at Italian places. It had no flavor except the sausage. Now for the sausage.. It tasted like rotten play dough. Horrible, rotten play dough. So I would have much rather it had NO flavor like the rest of the dish. I had a few bites to make sure it wasn't just a bad bite then had my BF try it. He spit it out. Now, you know what? Stuff happens. Things go bad, cooks have off nights or whatever the case may be so I feel like my dislike towards Piazza Bella is partially my fault. I did not tell the waitress that I thought something was wrong with the dish and I should have. But since the dish was still full when she cleared my plate and I declined her offer to pack it up I wish she would have asked if everything was okay. So I take part of the blame for sure. On the other hand, it was so bad I haven't been back and it has been over a year.. =(   I WANT to give it another shot but all I can think of is that sausage.... So once again..  *sigh*",0.9854,0.676,0.19,0.135,0.5412029679721989

The service was pretty terrible from the start.  Essentially, they visited us three times: Brought us menus and water, took our order, brought our food, then disappeared for about an hour.  This wouldn't have bothered me as much if half the staff weren't standing by the door chatting the whole time, oblivious to patrons.  They must have upset someone even more than us, because as the valet pulled up right next to our sidewalk patio seats, one patron was shouting that she would never be back again. As for the food, it was hit (my lovely Bucatini all'Amatriciana) or miss (his Pasta Bolognese, which was completely bland - he could have made better himself, which is saying something). All in all, his bad pasta and the horrible service outweighed my great dish and the lovely patio.",0.9422,0.729,0.167,0.104,0.5530492898913951
2010-06-24,2.0,"I've been here 3 times.  The first time my sister and I came here, it was a slow night in the fall/winter and we shared the place with a couple and their small tots. They really do cater to little kids (what kid doesn't like pasta or pizza?) We ordered the salad special of the day to start with and it was outstanding. We both ordered pasta dishes (i forgot what my sister had, but i had pasta with vodka sauce) and it was great. We had a few glasses of wine and it was a great time. Mind you, there was only one other table in the restaurant.  The second time I ordered a pasta dish with chicken in it and the chicken tasted awful. It was dry and completely flavorless. The pasta was great, but I pushed all the chicken to the side. The server asked if everything was okay. I told them I didn't like it and was kind of disappointed that they did not try to recover by offering me something else. They apologized- thats fine. It happens! I haven't ordered anything with chicken in it since!  My third experience here was AWFUL! It was a friday night around 7:00. It was a perfect summer day and everyone was out and about because the place was hopping. I was seated right away, outside on their patio. After we were seated, my guest and I did not receive a hello or ""we'll be right with you"". 15 minutes later (no joke...i looked at my phone right before we sat down so when i checked my phone- it really had been 15 minutes) our server...we think its our server drops by to see if we can get a drink. He takes our drink order and vanishes. 10 minutes later our drinks show up and our server is about to vanish when tell him we want the calamari to start. Again, it takes a lifetime to get our course and when we receive our calamari- its cold. Obviously it had been sitting for a while and nobody ran it out to our table. We hadn't seen our server in ages so we grab the bus boy to take care of the cold calami situation. We waited probably another 10 minutes and receives hot calamari- thank goodness because now we've been there for almost an hour and are STARVING!! We inhaled the friend calamari- it was pretty good. Our server did make an appearance long enough to take our dinner order and after the calamari recook, it took about 20 minutes after that to get our entrees. (We got to PB at 7...we didn't leave until after 9. We wanted a quick dinner, but this is how busy and how awful the service was!). We inhaled our entrees- but I was disappointed because my pasta dish was supposed to have roasted peppers, squash and tomatoes in it and all i ended up with was a bunch of peas, 2 pieces of brocolli and sauteed mushrooms. Really!!?? I was already fed up so I didn't even want to bother sending it back- I was STARVING so I inhaled most of my dinner. We asked for the check and again...kid you not, it took AGES to get the check. Our server did come back to say it'd be ""one second while he grabbed the check"". five minutes later or more...we got our check. We paid cash and scrammed immediately because we were so ticked off. The calamari was still on the original bill which was annoying after how long we waited for EVERYTHING! This place needs to get their **** together. It looked like they were understaffed, but where was the manager? He should have at least been making table calls to apologize for the wait or something. I wait tables myself and this was probably the WORST service i've had here in chicago. I like their food, but maybe I'll go back in the winter when the place is dead and they only have to worry about 2 or 3 tables.  Lesson here: don't go during the rush hour. don't count on good service. dont eat the chicken.  I didn't even mention this, but this place is always crawling with kids- so avoid this place if you don't like dining at restaurants where there are lots of kids (and where parents let their kids run around, make a ton of noise and disturb other guest)!",-0.9591,0.814,0.086,0.1,0.5457814407814408

There was like 3 measly mushy pieces of eggplant so I asked the server and she said that the tomato in the description meant the sauce! Not very clear but whatev. I asked for more eggplant (since that's why I wanted that pasta) and she literally brought me a gravy dish filled with grease, some melted horrible looking cheese and something that I did not recognize (maybe at some point in it's life it could have been eggplant).   My friend ordered the caprese salad which was pretty good but its hard to screw up something so simple.

Our waiter (name escapes me at the moment) was a true gentleman and took all the ladies' orders first, skipping over the three guys randomly seated around our table.  He also offered his recommendation of some menu items that were a must-try! Even though we had a party of 8 our food came out pretty quickly.  Once I saw a calzone was on the menu my mind was made up, while everyone else ordered a pasta dish.  My calzone alone was 5-star worthy and it was absolutely huge - clearly enough for two people.  It had the perfect amount of filling (pepperoni, sausage, and mozzarella) and was just greasy enough to cure a day-long hangover but not upset my stomach.  To be honest, though, I was secretly jealous of my friend Kate's gnocchi with four cheese sauce - one bite and I was hooked.  I'll be getting that next time. Though our waiter raved about the desserts, none of us could stomach any more food by the time we were done.   Minus alcohol and with tip we all spent about $20.  Great for dates or groups - the restaurant is pretty moderate in size but I recommend making a reservation.",0.9914,0.794,0.18,0.026,0.4906633906633906

However, that simply was not the case. What now concerns me more, are you choice of words even in light of a favorable 4 star review.

2009-09-24,2.0,Have been coming to this neighborhood spot for 6 years and apparently they have new owner who has totally messed it up.  Trying for funky vibe as opposed to sticking with what worked with good Italian food with neighborhood feel.  Service and food quality have gone by wayside for most part.  One example is the manager on duty informing our party of 6 that we could not combine an outside table (it was totally empty by the way) because of outdoor patio code.  We went a block away to John's Place and they gladly combined tables and was way friendlier overall experience.  Lose the cool factor club feel and win back your core customers...some friendly advice,0.8595,0.759,0.153,0.089,0.41103896103896104

One note though - I would have given the place 5 stars but they brought us our bill and the receipt came back and they had charged an extra couple of dollars.  They said they had made a mistake ringing the original bill up.  I find it really unprofessional not to address that with a customer before actually charging it to their card.  Honestly, if it wasn't that this is the only Italian place that I've ever been excited about this would be too great of a sticking point with me and I probably wouldn't go back.  If they try that again though...",0.9955,0.759,0.187,0.055,0.41162280701754383

The wine list is pretty decent, not too expensive or vast, but some good options. One thing to note - I asked her for a different pinot noir than the one I had ordered by the glass since I didn't like it. She immediately offered to take the glass back and bring me something else. (btw - our server was helpful, efficient and way easy-going). We started with a bunch of apps - baked goat cheese was great - served breaded in a caper/tomato sauce with toasted garlic bread slices (similar to queso de cabra served at a tapas restaurant). The other apps - calamari, bruschetta - good but nothing stood out. I ordered the carpaccio - it was okay - a little thick but served with the standard arugula and Parmesan slices. Others had the lasagna which is served in an individual ceramic dish - it comes out covered in way to much cheese and entirely too heavy. The gnocchi was pretty good but, again, pretty heavy.

We ordered the gnocchi with four cheese sauce and a pizza quattro formaggi (we reeeally like cheese, okay?!) and split both.  The gnocchi came out first, just as our polite waitress mentioned it would (we didn't mind nor want to wait for both to arrive at the same time).  Oh.

It was so creamy, so delectable, we quickly gobbled everything up even to the amazement of our waitress.  The pizza shortly came out after, and while it was good, it was tough to beat the former dish. The atmosphere is quite nice and, dare I say, was a little romantic with the guitarist strumming away.  Will definitely be back, though it's not something to afford every week - especially now with the 11.5% city and restaurant/entertainment tax that crept up.  The dishes here start at about $14-15 and go up from there (ours were $15.75 each), which is a little more than something I am comfortable paying every time I dine out.  That said though, it is definitely a place to go for those special occasions...... a raise, a new job, finding out you're going to be an aunt, or maybe even just because you're craving their gnocchi in four cheese sauce.",0.9928,0.818,0.17,0.012,0.5459531273324377

Maybe it was the herd of barking ladies sitting at the bar including one standout woman with a voice so grating that it literally hurt my ears whenever she spoke.   On to the food.  Not bad, not bad.  My friend and I decided to order 2 dishes and share them.  I ordered the lasagna bolognese.  The portion size was right on point, but even for this cheese lover, I felt there was an overwhelmingly large amount of cheese in the Bolognese sauce that led to a thick, almost goopy consistency.  My friend ordered a calzone with mushrooms and garlic that totally rocked.  The bread wasn't too thick and they got the right mix of mushrooms, garlic, cheese and sauce.  Because I can't resist a cannoli, I ordered one to go.  Slightly disappointing, it was on the small side and the ricotta filling was way too sweet.",-0.9752,0.783,0.059,0.158,0.5004668534080299

The service is always great and the outdoor seating is awesome but the food is always just decent. I've had better Italian in the area so it's hard to rate Piazza Bella as one of my favorites. Their cream sauces are always a bit too thick and overbearing for me. The bread is nothing special. Desserts are okay and satisfy the sweet tooth but nothing out of the ordinary.

My fiance had a pizza.  Both of our meals were outstanding. We asked our waitress if they offer whole wheat pasta on their menu. She said no but if you bring in whole wheat pasta, they will cook it for you as a substitute for their noodles. I thought that was useful because whole wheat suits my diet better.

(In the mean time people were waiting for their take out orders for long periods of time as well.) When I did get my meal -it was not what I ordered and I sent it back twice-and rather then have them make it a third time I asked that they take it off the bill.  The server told us our wine would be complimentary and when it showed up on the bill I brought it to the manager's attention and he said he didn't know anything about it.  He was not at all apologetic or empathetic about the situation.  He became frustrated and would not let me speak to the owner -because the owner was eating dinner.   What a shame!  Piazza Bella was such a great neighborhood find that I have introduced to guests and friends over the past 8 years!

2008-05-01,5.0,"Piazza Bella is fantastic! We love this place for many, many reasons. I know I'm a known yelping rambler, and this may be no different, but I'll try to break this down into ""How do I love thee?"" bullet points - Neighborhood - One of my favorite streets on the North Side, this beautiful tree-lined street reminds me of all the best tree-lined streets in NYC, San Francisco, Philadelphia. Boutiques, neighborhood kids on tricycles being pushed around, restaurants, apt. buildings and condos, etc. etc. I love just walking on this street. Makes the heart feel good. Family - this is a TERRIFIC family place - note: definitely between the 5:00 - 7:00 hours, let's not kid ourselves here, but in the early dinner hours, you get crayon on the paper tablecloth action, incredibly warm and welcoming behavior from the hostesses, bartender (he is so funny - I don't know his name, but he's insanely nice), and Joe, the owner from Italy. He is a backslapping character right out of central casting, and you couldn't ask for a more inviting host. Authenticity - Jacky and I are HUGE Italy fans, and we had favorite food experiences in Rome, Florence, Tuscan countryside and Venice...from our experience, this is a VERY authentic Roman Osteria or Trattoria...In Rome (or Tuscany), it was the norm to see babies, children, the elderly, businesspeople, tourists, etc. , all crowded around laughing and enjoying themselves - I totally get that vibe here. From the bowls of penne for the girls, to the pizzas and entrees and split wine for us, it's just a very authentic snapshot of a true Italian experience. Food - I love the food! Truly authentic as mentioned above, and their menu is a true Italian experience - I compare it favorably to Pizza DOC, another family favorite. PB's pizza is phenomenal (we steal slices from the girls), it reminds me (this is a real compliment, not a strange backhanded one) of Papa Gino's in Massachusetts...yeah, weird...but there is something very familiar about the cheese and sauce that makes me miss Boston of all things! Someone else from NE needs to get a cheese pizza from Piazza Bella and back me up on this one... we also love their host of entrees, and feel that they are simple and fresh, and perfectly seasoned. We have not had one bad meal, ever.  Dessert - my old favorite desserts in the city of Chicago used to be the chocolate chip cookie dough eggrolls at Flavor up on W North Ave. (long gone, I think), and the Apple Quince pie at Green Dolphin Street (again, way back in the day). My new favorite? Hands down - the Tartufo Limone - oh Lord...it is Lemon gelato with a limoncello liqueur cream center, topped with pop-rock like meringue sprinkles. Unreal. It's like a souped up haute cuisine version of a lemon meringue pie...even if you sit next door in the bar for cocktails and dessert one night (something Jacky and I like to do on date night after dinner elsewhere), go try that one night...ridonkulous. Jacky swears by the equally decadent Tartufo Cioccolato   -  a zabaglione cream center, with chocolate gelato and caramelized hazelnuts, and sprinkled cocoa powder.

Roscoe), and I think this section is geared more towards dinner dining.  We peeked in the windows of the trattoria section, and it had more of a casual feel, and a different menu on the chalkboard.  Anyway, the three of us ordered pasta dishes and a bottle of wine, and the bill came to about $100 after tax and tip, and in my mind, that's pretty high.  My fettuccine was piled with veggies and a nice and light garlic sauce.  Unfortunately, the veggies tended to be overcooked and bland, with the celery coming through with the strongest flavor.  My friend ordered the pasta special of the night with asparagus, shrimp, and a lemon/white wine sauce.  I tried it and it was actually pretty good, and VERY rich tasting, like loads of butter rich.  I don't know if I could have eaten a whole bowl of it.  My other friend had the tagliatelle bolognese, and it looked good, but I didn't try it.  We sat in the front of the restaurant very near the door, and it felt pretty cramped.  The service was on the slow side too.",0.9788,0.839,0.154,0.007,0.615408163265306

I was with my new BFF Kirsten F. and we decided to split the risotto and the ""pizza verde"", a nice culinary marriage of spinach, ricotta cheese, tomato sauce and pesto.

The fact that my date looked particularly handsome in the candlelight was not enough to save this place in my book.  I wouldn't recommend it, and I won't be going back.",0.8627,0.841,0.1,0.059,0.726890756302521

The food was fantastic, and came in excellent portion size.  My fiance's gnocchi was top notch, and my veal in lemon-caper sauce makes my mouth water as I write (20 hours later). Our waitress was also excellent, but unfortunately service is where Piazza Bella Trattoria loses its 5th star.  Near the end of our meal, we couldn't help but notice the owner and a couple wait staff staring at us.  Nothing takes the taste out of dessert like staff watching you... hoping that you'll leave soon so they can seat the next couple.

Between the three of us, we had the Chicken Parm, Stuffed Chicken and Fusilli with Eggplant which were all delicious (not to mention served to us about 10 or 15 minutes after we ordered!)  We didn't have room for dessert, but we can't wait to return and try it asap!   Some other little tidbits?  The whole restaurant applauded as a young couple left the restaurant.  When we asked what we had missed, we found out they had just gotten engaged!  Later on when my buddy wanted to use the restroom, a super friendly busser told her it was busy and proceeded to let her know as soon as it was free!  Did someone say above and beyond?! To top it all off, every single member of the wait staff thanked us on the way out.  To that I say, ""Oh no, thank you!""",0.9964,0.754,0.227,0.019,0.5066192225283135

2006-08-12,3.0,"I ate here last night, 8/11/06. We sat outside.  The area is nice and quint, like much of Roscoe Village.  It's very comfortable.  It wouldn't hurt if they find some nice chairs, but I guess plastic does it. The food was 3/5.  One thing you'll notice, if they aren't really busy, is how fast it gets out to you.  Our food must have taken almost 3 minutes to get to us after ordering it.  I know it's nice to get quick service, but it tells me the food is probably more or less pre-made and just slapped together when ordered.  I don't have a problem with that because everyone loves convenience, but it's not good when quality suffers.  Tonight, the quality suffered. On top of being too quick with the order my noodles looked dry and the chicken tasted overcooked.  (I had the Farfalle alla buttera--Chicken, noodles, mushroom, sun dried tomotoes, and sauce.)  It really wasn't that good.   However, my girlfriend had the Agnolotti del mare ripieni di branzino e gamberi in salsa di aragosta, gamberetti e rucola  (Agnolotti filled with seabass and shrimp, sauteed in a lobster sauce with baby shrimp and arugola)....try saying that one!  Anyway, she liked it.  She did complain the food was out WAY to quickly, but her meal was fine. On other occasions I've drank wine, not last night.  On those occasions the staff has been more than helpful.  Also, about the staff, they were excellent.  Very good service. Overall though, just your average Italian joint and as with most of them, it's hit or miss.  Our total cost with tip was around $36- No drinks included.",0.9043,0.79,0.127,0.084,0.5315714285714285

Piazza Bella Trattoria loves serving carbs just like any other Italian restaurant.  But I wasn't blown away by it.  Decent food, decent prices, cute outdoor seating (indoors looked cozy too), and attentive service, but if I'm going to add another inch to my waistline, I'll probably go somewhere else next time.   The cheese pizza (with spinach) was good, but not great.  It lacked flavor, mostly in the sauce.  The Farfalle alla buttera would have been better with seasoning on the chicken and less cream.   But they do have quite the extensive menu, so the likelihood of finding something you would like to try is pretty high.
