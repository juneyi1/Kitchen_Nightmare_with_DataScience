2017-08-31,5.0,"We chose Bistro Campagne as our belated anniversary dinner and we couldn't have been happier with this decision! Our server Lindsey was outstanding. Not pretentious or over the top in any way, but super down to earth and friendly. She is the epitome of how you wish service was everywhere.  They started us off with a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate, which was completely unexpected and greatly appreciated. We decided that a charcuterie board was obviously the way to go, and it was superb. Two vastly different cheeses, two different styles of pate, seedy mustard, divine rhubarb jam, an assortment of pickled veggies, and homemade bread and pita chips. We were in HEAVEN.  In true anniversary fashion, we decided to order two dishes and their accompanying wines and split, so we went with duck confit and pork chop. Both vastly different, and both superb. I preferred the actual duck meat + white wine over the pork chop + red wine, but preferred the pork chop's side dishes (carrots, roasted potatoes and dill sauce) over the duck's side dishes (radishes, greens, parsnip puree). For us, sharing worked our perfectly because we got the best of both worlds!  We ended the night with the bread pudding, and it was delicious! It's certainly not for the faint of heart with its strong rum sauce, but the flavor profile was outstanding.  For only $125 total for two people, this was an absolutely wonderful way to celebrate. I would highly recommend :)",0.9989,0.645,0.336,0.019,0.643558627752176
2017-08-28,1.0,"My guy and I were SO looking forward to coming here. So many things on the menu sounded amazing, great reviews, and a super cute location. What a major disappointment & disrespectful establishment.  We were most excited for the escargot. Love it and hadn't had it in a long time. Other reviewers seemed to love BC's, but I have had better escargot on a cruise ship with a lot less attitude on the side. The charcuterie board was decent, but overpriced compared to other restaurants nearby.  Pretentious & non-existent staff were terrible to us. There were many plates crowding our small table with two appetizers arriving at the same time, so we accidentally knocked over a glass of wine. We believe this might be why were treated awfully the rest of the time. Believe us, it was OUR loss on an expensive glass of wine. No one from the staff even came to give us extra napkins to clean up or even offer to clean up the spill. I sat there the rest of the time with a wet sleeve and trying to avoid the wet tablecloth and the folks at the next table had to sit next to a spill on the floor. Maybe if our waitress had ever come back to the table after our initial order, she would have noticed the spill.  We had to flag her down to order our next course. After placing our order, the bartender came over to say he couldn't serve us the port we ordered with dessert. He wouldn't tell us why, only that it wasn't his decision. Our waitress beat around the bush and wouldn't tell us why. We were not drunk if that is what they were implying. We were very polite the entire time we were there. Our tablecloth had more wine than we did! We canceled our desert and just took our check. We left flabbergasted at what had just happened.  We spent well over $100 on our appetizers and wine and are not afraid to drop money on a nice dinner out. But we were MORE than happy to take the rest of our evening elsewhere for dessert and to be treated with respect... which we were. We certainly won't be back.",0.9791,0.839,0.116,0.045,0.49976359338061455

2017-08-11,5.0,"Chicago has become one of the world's great dining destinations in the past few years. I know some would disagree with this, but I think you can thank this little unassuming bistro on the Northside for at least part of that development. The chef here was committed to locally sourced organic ingredients long before that trend became the norm -- look up the story and you'll be impressed. After the Chef's passing a few years back this place hasn't missed a step. The staff is warm and welcoming, the food is classic but perfectly prepared and the ambiance is among the most relaxing, romantic and enjoyable that you're likely to find at any bistro around the world. Excellent, approachable wine list, prices for food are not even sort of outrageous -- you could conceivably diner here weekly without going broke -- and their little courtyard is the best place in the city on warm summer nights.

I originally came here in 2012, and remembered it as very good.  My husband remembered it as a stand out and insisted we return for this year's anniversary.  It was excellent.  The rundown: Ambiance: cozy yet cafe-ish.  We were seated looking through the shutters into the garden area, which was probably about as charming as it gets.  They also had a classical guitarist that night, which was such a lovely and warm touch - simply perfect. 6/5 (not a typo) Fondue d'artichaus - it was very creamy, rich, not oversalted, and you could actually taste the artichokes.  However, it was essentially a high end version of spinach artichoke dip.  It was very good, and if you're not too adventurous, get it, but it didn't ""stand out"" 4/5 Strudel à l'Oignon Caramélisé - same as the above - it was flaky, well executed, the onions were cooked properly, but not a standout.4/5 Confit de Canard - If you read the menu, it sounded like it would be like many plates these days - many random vegetables strewn about the plate.  However, in this case it all worked extremely well together 5/5 Steak Frites  - It was cooked absolutely perfectly temperature wise.  I just wish it had had slightly more flavor for a hanger steak.  Maybe I was in the mood for a filet?  4/5 Drinks - I don't remember specifically what I had of the cocktail menu, but I do remember it was well balanced.  As for the wine, I did what I always do at reputable restaurants and just asked for a wine that paired nicely. It was a bordeaux she brought, and it was delicious.  5/5 Pot de Creme -  Elegant and creamy and cold and sweet and rich and the perfect ending. 5/5 (hard to go wrong) I highly recommend it if you're looking for traditional French bistro fare.  Next time we'll just be slightly more adventurous with the appetizers.",0.9973,0.771,0.218,0.011,0.633875968992248
2017-06-18,4.0,"I went to Bistro Campagne for Fathers Day! (Happy Father's Day to all dads out there!) I thought the meal was amazing. My sister got the Mac and Cheese which I 100% suggest since it's a mature spin on the child like dish most of us enjoyed as kids! My other sister had the Streak Frites, being her 7 year old self, finding food for her at such a mature served place can be a struggle, but her and the rest of the family greatly enjoyed the steak; so it's good for anyone with young kids! I had the muscles and though very good I did feel the sauce could be better. It had a bit too much salt and was to hard for me to finish.           Dessert was amazing and if you're gonna eat here makes sure to save room. The most memorable thing was the Crème brûlée which was fantastically made! The Lemon dish (sorry forgetting name of it) was very good as well.

Let me recount: Parking's great: metered street parking right outside or in the lot across the street.  The place itself is super cute and French-y; lilting, jazzy music is piped through the entire place, and the inside is a cozy and winding with candles flickering everywhere. They have two schweet outdoor seating areas; one in the front, facing the sidewalk, and one in the back. I wanted to sit inside though since I prefer not sweating into my wine glass. Our server, Aneta, was AMAZING. She knew her wines (we got a lovely bottle of momay (?)), told us her preferred way of eating the steak tartare (smash the yolk into the tartare, spread mustard on a piece of rye, top with a heaping of tartare and a few pieces of pickled green bean, and then nom on the lemon pickled anchovy as a chaser), and was super funny and attentive and kept bringing back loaves and loaves of the most beautiful-sounding French bread and the most delectable, full fat butter.  We ordered the escargot (my god, that parsley (?) butter sauce is TO DIE FOR), steak tartare (my life has been changed not even kidding), salmon (with the most perfectly roasted asparagus), pork chop (OMG SO TENDER), trout (crispy af with the most bomb rice), and a side of sauteed mushrooms and cheesy asparagus.  We basically rolled out of the restaurant but I don't even care; I need to come back and try everything else on the carefully curated menu. Also, I didn't order anything for dessert because I was so g-d full. (The portions are pretty big, considering it's a French restaurant. Am I complaining? Hell naw.)

I liked the Coquilles St.-Jacques. I think I had three nice scallops and piece of pork belly. The sauce was light and tasty. The pork chop was gigantic. It was nicely done and tender. They were out of the normal veg so substituted asparagus, this was yummy. We were too full for dessert, but I'm looking forward to skipping the salad next time.

The French onion soup is no joke.  It is the real deal, and it is delicious.  Between this and the warm bread, I could've had a meal and been happy. I ordered the pork chop as my entree, and sadly, it missed the mark.  It was very very heavily salted, to the point where I had one of my friends taste it to see if I was crazy.  I'm not too sensitive to salt, but it was nearly inedible to me.  Being that it was restaurant week, I didn't say anything, but I now regret that.  My sister had the steak frites which was awesome, and my friend had the chicken that was on the restaurant week menu, both of those items were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Womp Womp for me. Dessert was great - I had the creme brulee and both of my dinner mates had the chocolate pot-de-creme.  Both were outstanding.

To be honest, I'm not usually the biggest French food fan, but after this meal I'm wondering if I've just never had great French food before... Made a reservation for Sunday dinner with friends. Walked in and was wowed by the warm decor. Got seated and looked at the Chicago Restaurant menu, which was very extensive and generous. My friend asked for a wine recommendation based on her food selection and the waitress knew her stuff! Onto the food.

Tried the Fondue d'Artichaut as well, which was louder and creamier (smaller portions though). I loved both but I'm glad I picked the strudel. For main courses, I got the Truite (trout), one of the best trout dishes I've had. Crispy and sweet skin, gorgeous mushrooms. The one thing is that my plate seemed to have a proportional excess of green lentils (I felt like I was eating them forever), but everything was still delicious. Friends got Amish chicken and pork chop dishes, which were delicious but huge! They were nothing like the heavy French preparation I've had before, these were done with a light touch that let the ingredients shine and the palate breathe.

Our table was neither cleared nor wiped as we had food debris from the previous diners when we were seated. The menus were also covered with a thin even coat of food and fingerprints. The food was adequate, no more, and very pricey for its quality. Everything is heavily salted and the 'famous' French onion soup managed to have a sheen of grease covering the top. The steak was tough and dry and seemed to be dog food grade beef. The server as well as the bus boy were virtually unable to communicate in english. They were unable to explain or even describe the food effectively and recommendations were out of the question. The bathrooms scream ""black hole of Calcutta"" and I have it on good authority that the ladies room is unusable.

The main entrees my friends got looked good, but I was disappointed with my gnocchi. It was a carrot gnocchi which didn't have the texture of gnocchi that I was seeking. Instead it was mushy, but it had an interesting green pesto chickpea sauce which added some good flavor. Friends got the lamb special, the sandwich with egg, and the beef and potatoes. There were not any complaints about these dishes, and I apologize I didn't get more deets for my fellow yelpers! Overall, this place is DEFINITELY strong in representing the French cuisine and romantic atmosphere. I would recommend Bistro Campagne for a lovely dinner in a place that's a different.",0.9952,0.718,0.264,0.018,0.5418498168498168

2016-03-30,3.0,"Tl;dr: Definitely worth a try once - super cute restaurant, food is only so-so and pricey. The only thing standing between 3 stars and 2 is the physical restaurant itself. The decor is super cute, and even thought the place is laid out amongst a few storefronts, the tables are spacious and laid out well. BC is five stars hands down if you actually manage to get table outside in the summer - super chill patio that is reminiscent of a bistro in the French countryside (of which I've actually been to in Normandy, and yes, I'm aware that's what the name translates to). That being said, the food and the service (inside or out) are nothing special.  The husband and I have been here a handful of times over the years, and have always been underwhelmed each and every time. Every time we find ourselves back here (outside patio excepted) it's because someone else chose the restaurant - I'd never come back here if it were up to me (again, outside patio seating the exception.) The last visit, we were here with a party of 8 on a Friday for a 6 pm reservation. Got the distinct impression they were going to try to get us out by 8 pm. We had ordered apps, and I couldn't decide on an entree. I asked the server to give me another minute to decide. She tells me that if I don't order now, my entree will come out later than everyone else's. Really? You can't go put those orders in, and come back in a few minutes to give me time to decide? Fine. I order one of the specials, the scallops. We get our apps and salad, which were fine, nothing special. (Their escargot is good, but Chez Simo's is better.)  We get our entrees about 7 pm, and I'm still thinking we're being totally rushed. FWIW, the scallops were good, but there were only 3 of them, and one of the 3 was very small - a guy in our group got the scallops and he had 3 large ones. Also, at Chez Simo, you get four scallops in their scallop special, and they pair the scallops with much tastier sides than what I had at BC. Husband had the trout, and it was just ok, nothing special. He wouldn't eat the braised celery, which is saying a lot, because he will usually eat anything. At some point the server must have figured out that she wasn't going to get us out by 8, and stopped rushing us. However, the rest of the staff didn't get the memo, as water stopped being refilled, and I was constantly shooing away bus staff that kept trying to take my plates before I was finished. We had coffee, and were out by 830. We'll be back, but only outside, in the summer.",0.9243,0.901,0.07,0.029,0.3918304626815265

2016-03-24,2.0,"Let me preface this by saying that we have visited Bistro Campagne often, we have always loved it and would normally give it four or five stars. That being said, this visit was not one of those times. Firstly, we went with friends on a Saturday night. We normally go during the week and, after this last visit, will continue to only visit during the week. What is normally a relatively quiet, lovely bistro was loud and crowded. We had a reservation for 8:00pm, and when we arrived at 7:55pm, it was as though no one had ever handled reservations there before. The hostess and another were repeatedly tapping on their electronic seating system, changing table assignments, and changing them again. We watched a few couples with 8:00pm reservations (we could see the reservation screen) enter slightly after 8, and be seated right away (couples of two, mind you). We were finally seated at about 8:15 (not the worst, by any means, but an annoyance when coupled with the rest of the evening). Whilst one would expect a restaurant to be busy on a Saturday night, this was particularly jarring when one's experiences have all been so different on other evenings. Our table was fine. It was in the added room, which normally we like, but was loud this evening. It just felt crowded and noisy.  Our server came over and was nice, but not to the usual standard of attentiveness one is used to from Bistro Campagne. We ordered aperitifs (two quinquina le birre, a vesper, and an old-fashioned), which were all quite nice. We had to ask for bread, which was odd, as they are normally on top of things like that. I had the moulle starter and, whilst I normally love their mussels, found these to be quite dry and of a rather blah texture -as though they sat under the heat lamp a bit before serving. The others has French onion soup, which they enjoyed, and the croquettes, which were light and airy. Our mains were the cassolette, which was flavorful, and the pork schnitzel, which I was told was good (and a huge portion). We shared the tarte au citron for dessert, and our friends shared a ""deconstructed"" creme brulee (a mason jar with a berry compote layer, a creme layer, shards of shattered sugar glass, and lavender shortbread biscuits) which, whilst tasty, was a bit of a bizarre take -as though it was too busy an evening to be bothered making a traditional creme brulee. To be fair, the lavender biscuit (which is all I tasted of that dessert) was yummy. We capped off the evening with absinthe, which was pretty good. During the meal, my husband and I drank club soda with lime, and our friends had water. As I said, the waitress was friendly, but not overly attentive. She was fairly consistent on asking if we wanted more club soda as she saw empty glasses. Upon receiving the bill, I understand why ... we were charged $3 a glass for EACH of the club sodas! Now, I am sorry if I sound cheap - and I am really just talking principle here, but at a fine dining restaurant (where the prices are more than adequate to cover costs), to charge $18 for six club soda fountain drinks -costing pennies a serving- just seems ... tacky (and, no, the irony of tackiness in complaining about paying for each club soda is not lost on me. Overall, the experience was not to the usual standard of Bistro Campagne. The bill, with tip, for the four of us was $320. Not exactly chump-change for a rather lackluster evening. When you are paying those kind of prices, it is for the whole experience, not just the food. Whilst we will return, it will NOT be on a Saturday night, and we will think twice about returning if another visit has a similar result. So, 4 stars for the food (overall, pretty good). 3 stars for service. 2 stars TOPS, for ambiance, and 1 star for the exorbitant charges for club soda (again, I hate that I sound so cheap about this, but it was the final thing to really just put me off).",0.9952,0.821,0.122,0.057,0.541453447050462

2015-07-23,3.0,"This place is lovely, very country French.  The inside dining room is broken up into smaller, more intimate rooms, and the quiet, fenced-in yard-like outside dining area must be one of the nicest in Chicago.  Tres classique!   The food is pretty standard French bistro fare, all done pretty competently if not spectacularly.  We tried the escargot - smallish snails but in an excellent garlic, parsley butter sauce.  Curiously, this was served without anything to sop up the butter - would have been nice to have some toast points.  The salt cod fritters were satisfying.  The salad lyonnaise was pretty standard - frisee greens with lardon and poached egg.  The hangar steak frites were good - the meat was prepared to the proper doneness and with satisfying flavor.  The frites were particularly good, thin ones that were nicely crispy and very tasty with the Bordelaise sauce accompanying the steak.  The roasted squash tart was also good. Desserts were also competent but not that special.  The fruit tart of the day was apricot - very delicious apricots but the crust was soggy and overwhelmed.  The profiteroles were good but when are these ever not good? All in all, this is a very nice place to have a quiet, intimate dinner when thoughtful conversation is important and you don't have to focus on the food too much.",0.9971,0.703,0.279,0.018,0.6014041514041515
2015-07-22,3.0,"This is more of a 3.5 star review. I love French bistros and this was one of the only ones open on Sunday, so we decided to come here. The restaurant itself is insanely quaint and feels just like the French countryside. The outdoor patio is beautiful and the wood floors and little nooks indoors are very charming. While it's not your traditional tile-floored bistro, it's a great atmosphere for any special occasion. As for food, we started with the brandade (salted cod fritters) and the escargot. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. The brandade were delicious and the escargot was as good as it gets. No complaints here. For my entree, I had the steak frites with hangar steak. The steak was cooked perfectly. Loved the thin and crispy frites, the herb sauce, and the bordelaise. However, the dish was on the salty side, and I have a pretty high salt threshold. I also tried the roasted squash entree which had a bitter taste to it, not sure if I could have eaten the whole plate. That said, the person who ordered it loved it so it could have just been that bite. For dessert, we had the profiteroles and their special apricot tart. The profiteroles were very good, though it's hard to mess up profiteroles. The apricot tart was tasty, but the puff pastry was just a little too soggy. It was sometimes hard to tell that there was a tart under the apricot, but other than that, it was tasty and not too sweet. Overall, this is a tough one for me in terms of star rating because I did enjoy this place. It was a very solid meal across the board, no major flaws. However, I would go elsewhere next time I'm looking for a French bistro. There are too many places in Chicago to get this kind of food, and while I liked this place, I didn't love it enough to come back.",0.9851,0.795,0.151,0.054,0.57663139329806

2015-07-16,3.0,"If this is seriously regarded as ""Chicago's most romantic restaurant"", as stated in several reviews, y'all are in serious trouble. The patio seating is pretty, and live jazz every other Sunday is a nice touch, but the service and food fell below expectations and it really isn't all that upscale. LE GRAND BALLON ROSE: Ordered the whole bottle (~$40), had buyers regret because it just wasn't that great. Maybe it needed to breathe, or maybe or expectations just got lower and lower with each underwhelming dish, because the last couple of glasses tasted the best... before we found the flies. More on that below. FRENCH ONION SOUP: Delicate and underseasoned, perhaps on purpose. I have to wonder if everyone raves about this dish because of the insane amount of cheese (at least an inch thick) or if I just caught the chef on an off day. Didn't finish this. ESCARGOT: The garlicky sauce is damn delicious. Mop it up with your bread and lick the cups clean. If your date won't kiss you afterward because of garlic breath, he isn't the right one anyway. BEEF TARTARE: This was tasty, served with hardboiled egg, pickle, and  mustard with pumpernickel. Not the best version I've had but it was probably the best app we had here. STEAK FRITE: The hangar cut is good quality and cooked perfectly but again, underseasoned. Butter-garlic sauce was minimal but divine. Fries, in contrast, have more salt than McDonalds; seemed to be the only dish on the table with any salt whatsoever.  Fries were incredibly crispy though, which was appreciated. This dish was ""just fine"" instead of ""really good"". SIDE OF MUSHROOMS: Nicely done, good complement to the steak dish and also coupled well with the frites. Wouldn't consider this a must-get item, but it's a decent side choice. PAIN PERDUE: Bread pudding with brown sugar and fig preparation. Our server warned us it was a large portion but it was normally-sized to us. And, as I predicted, it lacked flavor. Should have gone with my instincts and had dessert elsewhere. I think this is the first time we haven't finished a bread pudding dessert, ever.  Service was a little off. Our gal seemed to have far too many tables to manage, which was every table in the back room (5) and then some, guy bussing tables was friendier. We found several flies in our wine, and when we pointed this out to our server she searched around for open windows, and made several comments about us being the only ones affected. Felt this could have been handled better. Service was not on par my expectations for a $150 dinner.",0.9848,0.788,0.132,0.081,0.5492997198879553
2015-07-06,5.0,"Amazing, absolutely amazing. We've been wanting to dine on the patio here since we rode by on bikes last summer. We hyped the place up so much from reading reviews and looking at pictures, they did not fail to exceed expectations. We walked in for a 7:30 reservation on a Friday night and were sat outside immediately. The front patio was great, really pretty area, quiet, very romantic. Our hostess was really nice, had great recommendations and made us feel right at home...despite us butchering pretty much every word from the menu. We split an order of the gnudi and goat cheese salad for appetizers, then the pork chop and chicken for main courses. The appetizers were very good, the gnudi was rich, creamy and delicious. As for the main courses, I typically don't order chicken at restaurants because I feel there isn't THAT much they can do to it that I can't at home....but when I had the first bite of that chicken, it felt like a sin that I couldn't finish the whole thing. The pork chop was great, the paired sauce was perfect. The cornmeal cake was so freaking good, that should be a dessert on its own.

Having had other prix fixe meals elsewhere I was expecting less, but in both quality and quantity Bistro Campagne delivered. The Poulet Rôti Forestière was cooked perfectly with a very nice mushroom cream sauce and my wife's Rushing Waters trout was nicely brown. Brandade de Morue en Croquette (cod fritters) were very tasty. My daughters hangear steak was cooked perfectly and the pomme frites were very good. The wine pairings were done very well, to the point where I was taking sips after every bite. Opt for the Pain Perdu at dessert and you won't be disappointed. My actual rating is 4.5 stars, the small mark is for the food being a little more of the American variant of French classics, versus the authentic preps that I was expecting.

2015-01-07,5.0,"After experiencing a nearly flawless brunch, my love affair with Bistro Campagne is holding steady. How can I not love the following? Allow me to elaborate. 1) They take reservations! Breakfast/brunch is probably the meal I am least likely willing to wait more than fifteen minutes for a table. When I wake up, all I want to do is get started with a steaming cup of coffee, eat something hearty and comforting, and if I'm feeling decadent, enjoy a mimosa or two. I do NOT want to wait an hour or more for all of this to happen, so the fact that I can make a reservation, and walk right to my table is an automatic win. The only downside is they don't start brunch service until 11:00, and sometimes I'd prefer to dine a bit earlier. No big whoop though.  2) The food is divine! And not crazy expensive (at least to me; your perspective may vary). Entrees average $10-$12, and for the quality, believe me, it's a bargain. 3) The service is so genial, and the restaurant is so charming and lovely. I love all of the different rooms. It feels as if you're in someone's home in France. Start with a mimosa. It will make you happy. I close the 'Barbieri,' which featured OJ and Aperol (I'm obsessed with Aperol these days). It was delightfully bubbly and pleasingly bitter.  More on the food. You really can't go wrong with anything you order, whether it be the omelette of the day, pain perdu, duck confit hash, or a traditional croque monsieur, rest assured it will all be delicious. I opted for the omelette of the day, which featured shitaake mushrooms, spinach, and goat cheese. Easily one of the best omelettes I've had. A perfect combination and balance of ingredients. Not too wet, not too dry, and not rubbery. On the side were some of the best roasted potatoes I've ever tasted. I swapped out the toast for a housemade biscuit, which was tender and flaky and came with strawberry preserves on the side. My husband had the traditional eggs benedict which he devoured. And because we're apparently pigs, we also shared an order of crepes Suzette. We were fighting over every last citrusy spoonful of that orange brandy sauce. We couldn't stop raving about how much we enjoyed our brunch and we've already made plans to go back. One more note worth mentioning: the original chef/owner passed away last year, and BC was able to not only carry on, but thrive after his passing. His legacy lives on in this wonderful restaurant. It's just as good as it ever was. Bistro Campage is easily of one my favorite restaurants in Chicago.",0.9953,0.814,0.164,0.021,0.6251984126984127

The escargot is cooked in Pernot and the sauce is a corn starchy thick and has a strong alcohol flavor, rather than the clarified garlic butter it sound be. Although flavorful, the boef was very tough. It may have come directly from the refrigerator to the oven, without time to reach room temperature. Perhaps the most impressionable was the efficiency in which the tables were turned at $125 / hour.",0.8855,0.807,0.14,0.052,0.51875

Tables are spaced so you don't listen to people next to you, and the restaurant does provide an intimate, charming setting for dinner. The one-star review is pretty simple: they served an absolutely inedible piece of fish to my wife. When we're talking red meat, people can reasonably debate the meaning of ""medium rare"", but whitefish cannot be still be deep pink - its not just disgusting, but dangerous to eat. Less importantly, serving a dish that absolutely needs to be sent back ruins everyone's meal - I sat and let my chicken cool until my wife got her food back (at which point it was overcooked to death with visible char). I've had lots of roast chicken in this city - there was nothing wrong with the version they turned out, but it was probably bottom 50%. More annoying was that they made no attempt to atone - not comping the dish, our cocktails, or even a visit from a manager. My wife got inarguably unsuitably cooked fish, our meal was spoiled as a result - and they were fine with it. We chose the restaurant because we wanted an intimate night out without the kids - those that have them knows that doesn't come around that often. Simply, the restaurant didn't deliver. Mistakes happen, but I expect the restaurant to attempt to make it up - they didn't. With so many restaurants in Chicago, why give them a second shot?",0.9416,0.804,0.128,0.068,0.5736501924001924

2014-06-15,5.0,"My husband and I were in Chicago to see a concert at the Old Town School of Folk Music.  We were staying downtown, so we toyed with making reservations at one of the many restaurants on Michigan Ave.  Then I thought, maybe there is a good place right near the venue that we can go to so we could relax before the show.  I googled the area and found that there were many places right on Lincoln Ave., so we decided to wing it.  We got our tickets, walked a few blocks and were just about to settle on a bar and grill with outdoor seating when my husband looked across the street and spotted a tiny restaurant with a courtyard filled with plants and flowers.  PERFECT!!!  It was early in the night, so even though we didn't have reservations, they were able to seat us.  They took us into the back seating area that looked like a courtyard in southern France.  The restaurant itself is made of stone with several buildings connected to each other.  Vines and trees fill the space and tiny lights hang from the trees.  There was even a old mosaic on one of the walls that looked like it was once a fountain.  It was casual but classy.  The tables were dressed with linen and the wait staff was all in black.  The hostess handed us our menus, and after a minute I noticed that the wine, cocktail and spirits menu was four pages and the food menu was only one page.  This was my kind of restaurant!!!  Unfortunately, that meant I had to figure out what to drink!   Even though I drink my fair share of wine I am not very familiar with French wines so I asked our waitress to recommend a white wine on the sweeter side.  She suggested the Maison Foucher, LaVignedes Sablons,Vouvray, Loire 2011.  It was sweet but not too sweet for dinner.  My husband chose a Chicago brew.   When she brought out the drinks we also received a loaf of warm fresh bread.  This baked on site and has a multigrain feel.  It is dense and nutty and really good!!!!! The dinner menu is short but creative and strong.  There were chicken, beef, lamb, fish and vegetarian options.   Additionally, there were also two specials that the waitress described beautifully!  They offer appetizers, salads, entrees, sandwiches and sides.  All the food was truly French so there was no cheating for those who do not like French food.  Seeing I have not had escargot for about 20 years, I opted to order them.  They serve them in a garlic Pernod butter.  This not only flavored them beautifully but softened them a bit so they were not rubbery.  I was so proud of my husband for trying them again!!!  Lucky for me he is still not a fan so I got to eat them all!!!!  I ordered the Bologaise d'Agneau, braised lamb shoulder, with carrots, spinach and beet greens over home made pasta.  The lamb was so moist and the portion perfect!  I loved the combination of carrots, spinach and greens!  The sauce was light but rich and I ended up soaking the remainder with my bread.   Wow, was that a fantastic meal!!!!  It was such a pleasant surprise!!!   I did not realize it would be like a soup, but that presentation allowed all the flavors to combine and enhance the overall meal.  My husband ordered one of the specials, a steak with potatoes d'au gratin.  He ordered it medium well and it was cooked to perfection!!!  The potatoes were soft but not mushy and still formed covered with a tangy, rich cheese blend.   We both cleaned our plates!!!  We opted to have another cocktail instead of dessert and I decided to try one of the sweeter champagnes.  Again, I went with the waitress's suggestion.  When she brought it out she joked that the color of the champagne matched my outfit.  It was true but the color wasn't the only selling point.  It was sweet, but not sickeningly sweet and it was smooth and fruity.  A perfect ending to a fantastic meal!!!  What a wonderful surprise this restaurant was!!  Bistro Campagne is a true gem!  I was a very happy girl!",0.9994,0.765,0.216,0.019,0.6165057165057164

We ordered the Truite Grenobloise (trout), Vol-au-Vent aux Champignons (mushrooms in pastry), scallop special, mac n cheese, and spinach. The sides were standard, the Mac was made with gruyere which made it a bit different. Scallops were fresh but were small, trout was light and bright, and the mushrooms, oh the mushrooms, was disappointing. The mushrooms were lacking flavor, and the absence of a sauce made it dry and incohesive with the pastry that encapsulated it. In general, the pastry was sub par for a French bistro. We had the profiteroles which were tough but had a great chocolate sauce drizzle, and the chocolate pudding was also memorable. Service was good but we had to be the ones to ask our waitress about specials, and drinks. It seems like this place is loved by a lot of people but we were underwhelmed, maybe an off night?

Bistro Campagne is it. I've been here about 4 times now with my family. First time of course I had to get the onion soup. It was absolutely to die for! Some of the best I've had outside of Paris. Next I had the Croque Monsieur, another staple food I ate while in France. It was so good, melt in your mouth. Crispy and just delicious! Every since then I've always gotten the Steak Frites because they are THAT good. Just get the hanger steak, it's perfectly fine. It's slightly crispy on the edges, a little chewy, succulent, juicy and just so rewarding. The frites are shoestrings that go perfectly well to soak up the steak juices. Not too salty, not too sweet. Heaven!  For dessert I'm a fan of the Creme Brulee and the Profiteroles. Can't go wrong there!!  Overall Bistro Campagne is the perfect spot for an authentic, non-stuffy, non-touristy, warm and welcoming stick-to-your-ribs French food. The staff is fantastic, very attentive and knowledgeable.

2014-02-19,3.0,"My review is for their brunch offerings only. Went this past weekend with another couple. Between the 4 of us we had 3 different entrees, the croque monsieur was pretty standard, the crabcakes were good, and the duck confit, while good, was not really a value for the  money. Unfortunately the men ordered the duck and both left still hungry.

Really, you get it wrong and you don't completely remake the drink?   The server's description of the trout dish when I asked just didn't sell me--just didn't seem like she knew--and her attention to our table of two was perhaps limited in a room of larger tables.   Th escargot was average.  I've had better sauce and the snails seemed a bit chewier than they should be.  Bread was excellent. The salad lyonnaise was disappointing.  Enough with the radicchio. A bit goes a long way and there wasn't enough dressing to offset its bitterness. The poached egg was too watery. And while the idea of pumpernickel croutons is intriguing, it just made for too many favors competing in this salad--without a good dressing to pull it all together. I don't like my salad drowning in olive oil, but maybe the water from the egg diluted what was there. My duck was excellent.  Cooked to perfection and the farro bed and plum sauce were delicious.  My husband's beef bourguignon tasted more like a stir fry than a stew.  Profiteroles for dessert were nothing special.",0.8515,0.818,0.101,0.08,0.527861027861028

Food is well executed, but simple in scope. Food feels like replication of French flavors, instead of a fresh spin on classic taste. Which is fine, if that is what you want. The single time I went there, I had steak tartare and braised beef cheeks. Tartare did not come with yolk (I was a little disappoints, but understand reason for why it was not on the plate). The accompaniment of cornichons, anchovies, and a garlicky aioli and friend potatoes were nice. The actual flavor of the tartare was nice, perhaps a little heavy on the mayonnaise (odd choice considering the aioli on the plate), lacked some of the fresh herbs I would like in tartare, and was undersalted. But the meat was tasty and the presentation pleasant. Braised beef cheeks were a bit more of a let down, the meat was fantastic and braised beautifully. Meat was tender and supple, the accompanying vegetables failed to impress however. A typically spread of carrots, onions, on top of mashed potatoes with a red wine sauce feels like this dish could have been been beef bourguignon and no one would have known the difference. Again, undersalted but salt was provided when requested. Service at Campagne is fantastic! Attentive without being overbearing.",0.9939,0.744,0.219,0.037,0.48769841269841274

From then on, the server came once to drop off the wine, once when food arrived, and once when meals were done and plates removed. Water was not refilled until our entrees were done and never once were we asked if we wanted another glass of wine or anything during the meal; she didn't even stop by once. We didn't even order desert because the service left a bad taste in our mouths. I normally don't give bad reviews but this deserved some attention.

I haven't had a kir since I was in Paris and the one I received was every bit as delicious. Delicious food, delicious wine and a very friendly staff. I would come back in a heartbeat. My one meh moment was that we had made a reservation and they stuck us right by the bathrooms. So while the atmosphere of the whole restaurant was warm and inviting, we did have a limiting view and I guess I expected a little more effort, considering the reservation. That said, they were a full house and maybe they had no place else to put us. Still, the food was astounding and the service was excellent.

2013-06-07,4.0,"Came here for a special occasion on a weeknight and had a very nice time. I haven't been to too many french places in the city, and we heard quite a few good things about this place from friends so we knew we had to give it a try. It's very charming inside, simple tables with white table clothes give it an appealing elegance. Their patio is absolutely romantic and also charming, but make sure you come here when it's really warm out to enjoy it. It even has hanging lights, so definitely a pretty spot. We asked for a nice table inside as it was chilly out and they gave us a perfect table in a corner away from the crowd. It was dimly lit and cozy so you get very comfortable right away. It was a Tuesday night and when we came in most people had mussels on their table as it is a special I suppose, something to note for the future and they did smell yummy. We ordered the escargot to start. Let's just say I wasn't the biggest fan of it, but maybe it's just not my thing. We had it at Paris Club and I think they made it a little tastier because it was in a puff pastry where as Bistro's is more garlicy and authentic. Now I had no idea what to do for my entree and since there were no diets that day, I went with their burger coupled with onion frites and I'm soo glad that I did. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had (see attached pic). Wow, good quality beef with onion jam and brie cheese, absolutely delicious. It's also huge so I could only eat half of it, but I definitely recommend it. My hubby got the steak frites with the hanger steak as everyone recommended it with the french fries. I had a bite and he ate the entire thing so it is definitely tasty. But their onion string frites are amazing, better than the pommes frites so definitely get that if your dish doesn't come with it. By this point we were stuffed but how could we not get some dessert, it's me we're talking about here. We went with the creme brule and it was amazing, one of the best I've had, not overly sweet, and the top was the perfect caramelized crunch. They even gave us a candle with it, so that was sweet on their part. Our server was good and friendly and everything was brought out correct and timely. We were definitely impressed by it's non pretentious vibe in a good neighborhood. I'll have to do some other French places before coming back, but I'm happy we came here.",0.9994,0.69,0.284,0.026,0.6104452515469464

2013-02-03,5.0,"After years of driving passed this place, I finally parked across the street and went in!  Well it wasn't so spur of the moment like that.  As soon as I found out (like a month ago) Bistro Campagne was going to be part of restaurant week, I made a reservation!    Ok, so let me break it down: The restaurant itself was so romantic.  Dimly lit and cozy, you could get very comfortable very quickly and not want to leave.  There were beautiful floral and skyscape mosaics on the wall.  Another plus was that the restaurant was spacious.  I've been to many French restaurants that try to sell the cramped seating as charmingly French.  I don't buy that and I am not a fan.  BC used their space well.  They've laid out their seating in a way that doesn't take away from the intimate atmosphere but also doesn't make the customer claustrophobic.   So since it was restaurant week, my friends and I decided we would each get different things off of the RW menu so we're able to try everything.  There were three of us and three different appetizers, entrees, and desserts.   Appetizers:  One of the appys was a salad, so we skipped that and one of us got the cauliflower soup and the rest of us got the Strudel À L'Oignon Caramélisé (caramelized onion wrapped in phyllo dough).  The cauliflower soup was good, but not something I would order since cauliflower is not one of my favorite vegetables.  The onion strudel, however, should be turned into an entree.  It was delicious and I wanted more of it (If you've read my review on Taverna 750, you know I have a phyllo dough obsession). The onions were perfectly caramelized and the phyllo perfectly baked.   Entree:  I ordered the Poulet Rôti Forestière (roasted chicken, mushroom ragout, and onion fries).  The portions in the dish were more American super-sized than dainty and French-like.  The plate had a massive mound of onion fries atop half a chicken.  I of course shared with the whole table and there was still leftovers.  The chicken was so tender, I almost didn't need a knife.  And it was so deliciously seasoned.  The best chicken dish I've ever had.  The onion fries were sweet with just a hint of salt. I tried the trout and the steak frites and both were good.  However, I think the chicken was the best one out of the three.    Dessert:  We ordered the Tarte Tatin Aux Pommes (apple tart), Tarte Au Citron (lemon tart), and the Pot-de-crème Au Chocolat (chocolate pudding).  They were all good but my favorite had to be the Tarte au Citron.  I'm usually don't like lemon/citrus desserts, however, this one was mild.  It didn't have that strong tart flavor that the lemon desserts i've tried usually have.  This was more sweet than tart.   Bistro Campagne est merveilleux!",0.998,0.817,0.171,0.012,0.6247635933806145

I had heard good things and really wanted to love it, but at the end of it all, I felt that my meal there was just average.  The restaurant is very cute and charming. We were sitting in a small back room that is designed to look like the basket of a hot air balloon. Unfortunately, as cute as this room is, it's also right next to the kitchen and dish stocking area, so it was pretty loud. Lots of crashing silverware and clattering of plates. We didn't order appetizers, but they did bring bread for the table. Weirdly, the bread just arrived wrapped in a piece of wax paper--no plates. Since the bread isn't pre-cut, you just have to tear into it and hope for the best. After we were done, the table looked like 4 toddlers had eaten there given the amount of crumbs that were present. For my main course, I had the roasted chicken with wild mushroom ragout and onion frites. There was an enormous amount of chicken--easily enough for two meals. The onion frites were so plentiful that they covered almost every bit of the plate and the chicken. These were the best part of the meal. The chicken, although cooked very well, was really rather bland. The ragout was very skimpy and didn't flavor the chicken all that much. For dessert, I had the profiteroles, which were good, but nothing exceptional. Overall, the meal was fine, but I probably wouldn't come back here.

The first time it was a home run! My manfriend and I chose to be seated outside on a nice summer day. We had the mussels as an appetizer, which was my first time eating them, and they were pretty awesome. Be sure to save your loaf of bread to dip into the yummy broth. I ordered the hangar steak, which probably was a mistake. It just wasn't the cut of meat I prefer although it was pretty tasty. My boyfriend ordered the pork chop. He described it as the best pork chop he's ever had in his life. We then had the creme brulee for dessert with some coffee, which was fantastic! On our second visit we sat inside, it was pretty busy and pretty loud. Not as romantic or quiet as our last visit. As an appetizer had the mussels and the escargot. I wasn't a fan of the escargot, but I tried it twice to make sure. I just couldn't dig the texture, so it's a personal thing. My boyfriend was happy to have the other 4 pieces to himself, he absolutely loved them. As an entree I ordered the duck and he ordered the macaroni gratin. Best mac and cheese I've ever tasted! Super creamy, cheesy, and decadent. You can't go wrong with emmental and gruyere, though. My duck was pretty good, but it had an overly salty flavor reminiscent of teriyaki. The couscous that came with the duck was super tasty.  We then ordered the lemon tart for dessert. It tasted fantastic, but it was impossible to cut with a fork. We asked for a knife and we were just sawing away at this tart. I'd say if it were served as a bar that would be okay to pick up and eat with your hands, it'd be even better. But trying to cut through the resilient but delicious crust kind of ruined the dish. Good food, good cocktails, and great service.

It was as if they'd tossed macaroni noodles in a little butter, put cheese on top, baked it and that's it. Maybe for a little $3 side dish to more flavorful food this would be okay, but for $18 I was really expecting something that was at least *delicious*, if not jaw-droppingly so.

2012-06-07,4.0,"I've been obsessed with all things French for as long as I can remember.  It probably started with my French lessons in 2nd grade but there's just something about France, Paris in particular, that holds such a mystique to me.  Which is why I find it disappointing that it is apparently so hard for people to recreate the casual Parisian bistro in Chicago, so that I can get a little taste of Paris sans the $1000+ airfare to tide me over until my next trip.   For me, Bistro Campagne does a great job of fulfilling that neighborhood bistro (albeit not in my neighborhood) feel that I had been yearning for.  The interior can only be described as charming - it's cozy and quaint and actually makes you feel like you're anywhere but the streets of Lincoln Square.   The food here is always solid.  On my last visit, I enjoyed the onion tart and bone marrow appetizers.  I love the onion tart and the bone marrow was good, just not quite as good as the bone marrow at Bouchon in Vegas (which I had just had prior to going to Bistro Campagne) so that was just a slight letdown for me.  My steak frites were great - the meat perfectly cooked to my desired medium rare.  While I am generally a proponent of letting the meat speak for itself at a steakhouse, here, I welcomed the addition of the garlicky butter atop the steak in addition to the red wine sauce accompanying it.  My dad and I, not to be outdone by our gluttony, also ordered a side of the onion frites which went great with my steak.   After finishing my steak (and only feeling slightly shamed when my dad asked to take half his burger home), I decided that we should probably have dessert.  After all, we were there to celebrate both of our birthdays and what's a birthday without a little something sweet, am I right?  Right.  We went with the bread pudding and it was a great choice.  I love bread pudding but am sometimes disappointed at restaurants.  Not this time.  The only negative (if you even want to call it that) was that my dad had called ahead of time to tell them it was my birthday and they confirmed that when they called to confirm the reservation but then didn't do anything about it.  Whatever.  I'm 29, not 12, so it's not the end of the world but since they made the effort to confirm it, why not acknowledge it?",0.996,0.78,0.169,0.051,0.5279491341991341

I enjoyed it previously and I enjoyed it here again. We were on the earlier side (around 6) on a thursday, so it wasn't that filled as would be expected.  Two courses was all I could handle. I started off with the carmelized onion strudel. This was almost an entree in of itself. It was really good though and was very savory. Pretty much right away I knew I made the right choice. The roasted chicken was very large. I wasn't able to finish it, but it was a really good dish. The chicken itself was very meaty and it was hard not to inhale the onions. The sauce was a real nice compliment as well. I really like the bistro feel here and you never feel rushed. Our waitress was extremely nice and always available.  It was just a nice and relaxed meal the entire time. Very filling and I liked the heartier style of the food. This isn't really butter and cream style french food, but it's not light fare either.

2012-02-23,3.0,"I really was expecting to like this place better because I love french food (mostly because I love butter).  My husband and I came the weekend before valentine's day for a romantic pre v-day dinner to avoid the overpriced and crowded restaurants on actual valentines day. Our reservations were for 7:30pm and it was about half full at this point. We started off by ordering drinks. I ordered a french martini, which wasn't on the menu, and was told they couldn't make me it. Ok, I'm pretty sure a french martini isn't actually french in any way, but I saw the bar and I know they had the ingredients so don't really understand why they couldn't make it. I didn't push it though and went for some martini with vodka and grapefruit (I think). It was very good so I wasn't disappointed in the drink department. We ordered the pate for an appetizer and it was delicious. It was quite a large portion of 4 different pates as well. I was pleasantly surprised. Three of the four were great and when it comes to spreadable meats, I'd say that's pretty good! We also got warm bread with butter right after we ordered drinks, which we ate pretty much all of because the butter tasted so good.  For entrees, I ordered the Boeuf Bourguignon, namely because I had recently seen Julie and Julia and want to taste it. Also the reviews for it were pretty good here. I thought it was just ok. I honestly don't think I like beef in that style (reminds me of pot roast - bleh). My husband got some lamb special they were having and he really enjoyed. I'm not a huge fan of lamb so I wasn't too impressed.  We shared creme brulee for dessert (typical, I know, but I just love it too much). It was good but nothing out of this world. The atmosphere was fairly romantic. There were mostly couples there. Either alone or on double dates. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and judging by the snipits of conversation I heard, fairly drunk. I honestly think the appetizer was the best part about this place.

The food was wonderful.  The Onion strudel was delightful and, as the waiter mentioned, did taste like French onion soup without the soup.  The Butternut soup du jour was pretty good and had a fall-y, spiced taste to it.  The entrées were cooked perfectly.  My Chicken was moist and tender and covered in a cartoonish amount of onion frittes.  My companion's steak was cooked very well and had a nice char to it.  The brussel sprout and mushroom sides were good, but nothing spectacular, as were the desserts (chocolate pot-de-crème and citrus tart) -- a nice ending to the meal but nothing that screamed second helpings. As restaurant week hits chicago in mid-February, the outside patio teased of warm summer afternoons, but alas during our trip it was a cold, soggy mess.  Taking a glance at the normal menu, the prices were a bit on the high side (a firm three $), but it would be a great place for a special romantic dinner.   Tucked away in busy Lincoln Square, Bistro Campagne is the place to go with that special someone on a special night.",0.9875,0.788,0.165,0.047,0.5707142857142858

So here's my first review of this year :) ABOUT: On Monday January 16, 2012 I celebrated my 2 year anniversary with my hubby. I didn't want to go to the same restaurants we have gone to, so he decided to check out nearby restaurants that we haven't tried. After searching and giving me the option of choosing, I decided for Bistro Campagne and boy was I happy that I made that choice. The atmosphere was delightful, a little dark, candlelight dinning, perfect for a romantic evening. Out waitress was French which I loved and was very kind and sweet. We started off with drinks, my husband order a beer from two brothers and I had a great glass of red wine that went well with my entree. We didn't order appetizers because I was planning on having dessert so as soon as we ordered we were welcome with nice, warm French bread along side some creamy butter.  FOOD: For my meal I order the expensive thing on the menu which was, ""Boeuf Bourguignon"". It was the most delicious meal I ever had. It was soooo good that i decided that if I had to choose what would be my last meal on earth Boeuf Bourguignon will be it. It was breath taking. Every bite was better the then the first and with my paring of rouge wine (our waitress suggested it) it was phenomenal. The Boeuf Bourguignon was $26 and my glass of rouge was $10 and it was worth it. Now my husband had the Cassoulet (Duck confit, pork shoulder, andouille & white beans, topped with bread crumbs and duck cracklings)  which was also delicious  that dish was $22.  Now we couldn't of left without a French traditional dessert which was crème brûlée, It makes my mouth water as I am writing this. It was great! That was $8. Our bill came out to $72 with taxes and we left a 20% gratuities so it was about $86. That's not bad for a great place, great food, great service, and a special occasion. Definitely going back!!!

All dishes were served piping hot, no complaints about cold food!  We started off with escargots, which could not have been better.  They were tender, and perfectly sauteed in a delicious herb/garlic/pernod butter.  Perfect for dipping fresh mini baguette.  My friend ordered a delicious Boeuf Bourguignon, I was jealous.  It was a generous portion of tender beef cheeks and vegetables in a dark red wine sauce; it was the best bourguignon I've ever tasted.  I ordered the Cassoulet because I couldn't resist the promise of duck confit, andouille and pork shoulder.  I loved the first few bites, but wish I could have stopped there.  After a while the flavors were too muddled to taste anything, there were too many cannellini beans, and I kept getting big chunks of fat.  I guess I didn't realize a cassoulet is essentially a bean stew.  Knowing that, I'm sure it was excellent for that type of dish, but was just not cup of tea (or beans).  Oh well.  Unfortunately we were too stuffed for dessert. I would definitely come back to try other menu items, the menu looked delicious.  I noticed they have a prix fixe menu on Wednesdays, though no mention of the price.   The service, overall, was fine, but I have a couple negative notes, which is why I couldn't give this 5 stars.  We walked into the super tight entrance and asked for a table for two.  A trio walked in behind us and the host said: let me see if they have a reservation first.  They did, so we had to squeeze into a corner so they could push past us.  Really, would it have been so horrible to just seat us first instead of squeezing around that tight space?  It's not like they were trying to juggle several parties, there were just the two of us.  Once seated, I got the impression our waitress didn't like us (was it my Sorels?  There was 6"" of snow on the ground, sorry but I'm practical).  She was super sweet to the table next to us, but cold to us.  She warmed up eventually, but friendly service should be standard.",0.9941,0.748,0.181,0.071,0.5479730158730157

We started out with an order of Soupe à l'Oignon Gratinée for each of us.  It was absolutely perfect.  The soup was caramelized oniony and the top was layered by the most perfectly broiled bread & bubbly cheese.  It warmed my body on a cold Chicago night and it tasted so good that I even ignored what would turn out to be pangs of my semi-lactose intolerance. The BF had the Côte de Porc, which was Berkshire pork chop roasted in the tastiest apple cider glaze.  Note to self: must try to recreate at home.  I tried a bite and I'll have to admit that I was jealous of his meal while I ate mine... Which brings me to my Bistro Campagne order fail.  I was really craving some Steak Frites but as I scanned the menu, the Cassoulet also caught my eye: duck confit, pork shoulder, andouille & white beans, topped with bread crumbs and duck cracklings.  Sounds good, doesn't it? Well...it was disappointing.  There were two slices of andouille and maybe five bites of actual meat in the dish hidden below a layer of beans.  Beans, beans, and more beans.  My semi-lactose intolerant digestive tract, already weakened by the very delicious but very cheesy soup, could not take eating what seemed to me to be like an entire can of beans.  I totally should have gone with my Steak Frites instinct. And of course, no trip to Bistro Campagne would be complete without Gratin de Macaroni...AKA the BEST MAC & CHEESE EVER.  I was a little apprehensive, since the last time we came, we ordered the entree to share between five people.  Does Bistro Campagne offer the Gratin de Macaroni as a side dish?  Yes, yes they do.  You can absolutely get a half order of the BEST MAC & CHEESE EVER. After this visit, I am a little less enamored, but I know that I completely whiffed on my entree choice. Bistro Campagne really is a great neighborhood restaurant that is cozy and romantic.  It's an amazing date place with really great French food, and I will definitely be back for the BEST MAC & CHEESE EVER and a different entree choice.",0.9968,0.751,0.195,0.055,0.5194444444444445
2011-11-28,4.0,"I recently visited Bistro Campagne for a Friday date night with my boo. We don't go out for French food, or visit Lincoln Square, very often at all, so neither of us had much of an idea of what to expect. What we found was a cozy little restaurant in a quiet little Chicago neighborhood full of goofy looking people (no fault of the restaurant). My boo and I were seated very promptly upon our arrival and ordered up a couple of the Bistro's signature cocktails. Which were surprisingly good. For appetizers we got the mussels and the escargot. I really enjoyed the escargot, but my boo preferred the mussels. Both were served in delicious sauces. Did I mention Bistro Campagne serves fresh bread piping hot to your table? I should have because it was awesome and made soaking up the sauces extra delicious. Don't fill up on bread, though, because the entrees are delicious and very generous portions. My boo got the pork chop which I sampled and was very delicious. I got the steak frites. The steak was perfectly prepared and the fries were ok. Not sure what's up with pairing fries and steak, but hey, French fries from a French joint, ended up being pretty good. For desert my boo and I split some sort of cream puff but with vanilla ice cream instead of cream. I liked the pastry shell, reminded me of my grandmother's cream puffs, but the ice cream was kind of whatever. I'd probably order a different desert the next time I visit. I enjoyed Bistro Campagne very much. The food was all quite good and service was above average. I would recommend Bistro Campagne as a nice cozy spot for a date, and if you're looking for a post dinner walk in a neighborhood of goofy looking people, Lincoln Square has you covered. If you're a French food novice like me, you'll have a good time and be well taken care of. I'll definitely be back.",0.9985,0.738,0.257,0.005,0.555277777777778
2011-11-27,3.0,"I was craving for rustic French bistro food.  Looking at the remainder of my deck of ""a la cards,"" Bistro Campagne seemed to fit the bill.  45 minutes later, I was there.   The bread service was disappointing.  The mini baguette was way too hot to touch, and the interior was under-leavened.  I got the onion soup.  The container of the soup was Old-Country-Buffet generic rather than country rustic.  It didn't come with crouton on top, which was another source of disappointment.  I used the bread I didn't finish to sop up my soup.  The soup itself was nicely flavored.  Like most onion soup in the US, the base was beef stock, which was abound with umami and sweetness of the caramelized onions and was not too salty; but it lacked the nuances of Cognac or Sherry.  For entree I got the Beef Bourguignon.  This was classically prepared, with visible cubes of bacon.  The flavor was okay - not bad, but lacked the sweetness of onion and carrots that's usually present in the dish (the ingredients were there, but the flavors not).  The best part of the dish were the potato croquettes.  The texture of the mashed potato inside was wonderfully soft and fine.  For dessert, I got the pain perdu.  The bread was cut into the shape a cupcake, and it was swimming in a pool of caramel sauce, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Despite the rather odd presentation, the pain perdu was well soaked and had great flavors and texture.  I only wished the figs were served fresh on top of the bread rather than soaked in the bread - this dessert could really use some bright flavors from fresh fruits.  The coffee they served was aromatic and smooth.  But again, the cup they used was something you'd expect from an American diner, rather than from a French bistro.   I got a glass of 2007 Domaine De L'oratoire St Martin Cairanne Haut Coustias.  It was a special by the glass.  The wine was fruit-forward - packed with flavors of dark berries - and had a surprisingly lingering (albeit slightly bitter) finish.  It went well with my entree.   The decor was very charming.  The inside felt like a French country cottage, with dim lighting, tasteful music, and well-spaced seats.  The white papers over the table cloth was the only thing that was unwelcome.  This would make a great spot for a relaxed but romantic night out.  Service was wonderful.  The waitress and the busboys were attentive, friendly, and helpful.  I cannot speak more highly of their service.   I really wanted to like this restaurant.  The service was great, and the space was well appointed.  However, the food was just not as good as I had hoped for.  For a similar style of cuisine, I've had better prepared food at La Sardine and Mon Ami Gabi, both at a cheaper price.   Bistro Campagne wasn't bad, and because of its decor and service, I might come again if I'm in the area.  But with other cheaper and better French bistros in the city, I don't think I will be rushing back to this place soon.",0.9987,0.745,0.215,0.04,0.46945021645021645

Instead the Strudel à l'Oignon Caramélisé was amazing, and the Potato & salt cod fritters with sauce gribiche would rate as ""fair."" Unlike what has been happening at other restaurants, at Bistro Campagne the entrees far outplayed the appetizers.  We thoroughly enjoyed the trout and the casoulet - if available - was out of this world.

2011-10-27,3.0,"My partner and I had an Excellent meal here last night that matched the occassion we had to celebrate, but...but...but...you know I have to say it: I thought my meal though full of fresh ingredients, completely filling, and totally delicious was officially overpiced.  But that's the price of good French food in this city- and I know it would take years of cooking to pull off the textures that I had last night. Still I hestitate... What you're paying for is rustic bistro fair prepared with primo professional cookery detailing, a gauzily golden  cozy atmosphere, and service staff that speak in inside voices creating the hush-hush environment of your local library if there weren't so many homeless people there. The lights are dimly intimate, the servers demure and articulate, and the tile in the bathroom floor small and expensive. The bussers drop fresh, hot baguettes off at your table swaddled in wax paper as if it were as precious as a baby, and refill it again as if it was as replenishable as water. Our server was a knowledgeable charming woman who provided recommendations and was thoroughly informed about the menu.  Slowly this place filled up so much that even the bar was seating and serving which is a comment on the Bistro Campagne's populairity.  I had the Beef Bourguignon and it made me realize that I could cook my way through every cook book I have and I'll never really be able to pull this off- I could taste every single ingredient singley as I put it in my mouth- each shave of celery, each mushroom, and each bit of bacon.  The beef cheeks melted in my mouth in  a way I've never quite have had with beef. And my pototo croquettes were still hot 15 minutes after my food had been served.  This sense of individual ingredients getting their due was also present in the duck in puff pastry appetizer I had- as I found myself slowly savoring the hazelnuts that were also present. Perhaps the flavors of everything did depend a tad too much on salt, but I tend to think of french food like that so this didn't really bust the food experience. I could not cook like this, and certainly the flavors justified going out for. Now was it worth going out for a bistro meal- that quite technically means rustic meals at moderate prices at a hole in the wall establishment in its native France-  that was actually as much for an entree as I would spend on groceries for at least 2 meals for 2 home cooking from Patrica Well's inimitble  _Bistro Cooking_?  I dunno.  You'd have to decide that yourself, but almost 30 dollars for an a la carte entree is not moderate to me.  I think the smallness of the restaurant precludes the prices they have posted there-  throwing down 100 bucks for two apps, two drinks, and two entrees in a storefront restaurant on a Wednesday night was...well...  It was a tad too much considering everybody had to hang their coats on their chairs,  you spend most of the night listening to other table's conversations because they are that close, and people were brushing past me constantly because aisles between the cafe tables were small.  Outside of the food and the little bread babies  it wasn't exactly a major high end experience that I would settle paying that much for. So I would go back, but probably...probably once every two years when I HAD to have some quality French and then still with that slight sense of being ripped off to go with my completley satisfied belly.  But yes the food's terrific, (and the servings much bigger than LM across the street!)",0.9907,0.92,0.078,0.003,0.43907962109575

For you, my dear readers,I have done both (no, no, don't thank me at once), and let me say that you can't go wrong. Today we celebrate Bistro Campagne - a little country house in the middle of Chicago.  I've eaten here multiple times over the years, and it always keeps me coming back. Bistro Campagne is perfect for a laid back, rustic bistro experience.  It is cozy in the winter, and, with its quiet, heavily leafed patio, a haven from big city life in the summer.  Our latest dinner here was a few weeks ago and we enjoyed a pleasant outdoor experience lubricated with Champagne and one of our favorite Roses, Domaine Triennes.  We first had this rose at Fritz and Frites in Galena a few years ago, and to our pleasure it has been appearing on fine wine lists throughout Chicago this summer.  If you stumble across it, you should order a bottle - it has a light salmon color that belies its earthy robustness. I had the steak tartare and duck breast, while Kelly opted for the goat cheese salad and pork chop.  The steak tartare was one of the best I've had in Chicago, prepared with very little fuss so that the earthy flavors of the meat can flourish.  The duck was cooked a little over my requested rare but was still juicy and delicious.  The pork chop was coated in sauce Robert, which is a mustard base sauce, and for the summer was possibly a tad heavy.  I enjoyed it more than Kelly, and while the pork chop had more fat than others we've had, it was still tasty enjoyable for lunch the following afternoon. For dessert we split the profiteroles and they were perfectly executed.  If you like profiteroles as a general rule you will enjoy them here. If you are looking for a bit of country in Lincoln Square, you will find it at Bistro Campagne.",0.9932,0.85,0.141,0.008,0.48906926406926415

Oh my GOD the patio at Bistro Campagne is SO CUTE.  And I'm not talking about the main one right off of Lincoln, I'm talking about the smaller, more intimate one behind the restaurant.  The patio we were seated on had no more than six or so tables and had lights strung up across it, spanning from the restaurant to the building behind it, which seems to be where the kitchen or prep area is.  Both buildings look like quaint little French country homes from the outside, and so it was even more like I was eating in someone's back yard in France.  This sounds SO pretentious, but it reminded me of a teeny town I visited in France when I vacationed there in 2004. The service was also friendly - he checked on us frequently without being overbearing.  We shared the mussels (delicious) and steak tartare (also delicious - but maybe a little bland.  just a tiny bit of salt would have made a world of difference) for appetizers so I wasn't extremely hungry when dinner rolled around.  I had the tuna nicoise and the soupe a l'oignon gratinee (uh, or as I know it, despite taking French through all of high school - french onion soup!).  I get French onion soup whenever it is on a menu, and since this is actually a French restaurant, it was incredible.  The nicoise was also the bomb - I would definitely order either of them a second time.

Bistro Campagne definitely did not disappoint.  As most reviewers often mentioned the mussels are not to be missed, it s delicate, tasty and a good start to any mean.  I had some beer while waiting for my friend and found the place the same as I remember it. Christine my friend ordered the trout while I decided to indulge and eat the Calf's liver.  Both our dishes were cooked perfectly and tasted delicious.  Both meals were enough to satisfy us for dinner so no dessert on this visit.

2011-06-06,4.0,"Bistro Campagne is a lovely French restaurant in the middle of Lincoln Square with wonderful food and a quiet patio area. I went with a friend last week for the first time and we were both impressed with the magnitude of the outdoor seating area. The patio is divided into two sections with about 10 tables in each section. We were a bit puzzled by the decor, as there were mosaics on the main building that seemed more Spanish than French, and a small shed-like building that had a very German roof about it. But it's so nice to sit outside in such a quiet serene patio - something you don't find very often in the city. We enjoyed a very nice bottle of Sancerre and began the meal with tuna tartare with anchovies and hard boiled egg, which was beautifully situated in a bed of haricots vert. I thought it was lovely. We also shared the onion tart which I thought was nicely done. I chose the Poulet Rôti Forestière (roasted chicken) for dinner and thought it was wonderful. The skin was crisp and the meat was tender. The onion frites on top were such a welcome addition. We ended our meal with a large pot-de-crème and I was delighted to find a restaurant that serves it well! It was creamy, rich, and absolutely delicious. Toward the end of our meal the mosquitos started to become a problem so if you're looking to avoid the pests, eat inside or, better yet, bring mosquito repellent.",0.9955,0.744,0.228,0.028,0.55505148005148
2011-06-05,3.0,"I decided to go here for my wedding anniversary after reading so many five star reviews. Our dinner was fine. Just fine. The service was fast, a little too fast, we made reservations so there was no wait, the food was flavorful although not well presented and the wine was impressive. So why did I walk away feeling like our $200 dinner was lackluster rather than a romantic splurge? The place has a decent ambience, low lighting and a rustic interior that looks out over a nice patio.  While the menu makes it clear that Bistro Campagne serves organic vegetables and free range meats, something that I wholeheartedly support, the plating and presentation lacks zeal. I ordered the chicken forestiere with wild mushrooms. What I got was a giant wedge of chicken doused in a cream sauce with slivers, tiny slivers, of mushroom and then completely covered with fried onions. Talk about disappointment. I was hoping for a simple, elegant plate, something one would find in a French Bistro and instead it felt like I was eating at TGIFridays.There was no green on the plate, no color, no sense of aesthetics, nothing to tempt the palate.  I will say that the chicken, while not looking too appetizing, was absolutely delicious and juicy. I was hoping to see some morels when I read ""wild mushrooms,"" but you can't be too picky. The creme brulee was spot on and paired exceptionally well with a nice cognac.

The steak frites was excellent and prepared perfectly with an excellent bordelaise sauce.

And it was served with a disgusting wilted salad on the said, and not one cornichon! None!  That's criminal. Steak Frites. Me, I prefer my fries to be at least slightly crisp.  If I can hold them up and they look flaccid, that would be bad.  And, if you take my steak, cook it, sauce it, plate it and let it sit under the heat lamp for 5 minutes? Yeah. Just making it worse!  The plate looked like hell, tasted OK, and I had to send the fries back to get them crispy. The steak tasted OK, although the sauce was weak and mostly flavorless.  The green butter thing they put on the steak? Not needed.  Simplicity, please!  (Besides, it tasted like awful).

Ordering prix fixe actually doesn't save you that much money - it's like getting a free dessert with your meal, which I usually don't eat so it was a nice excuse to have an excuse to indulge in a gluttonous meal. And boy did it feel indulgent. We started with escargot, which I had never eaten and was always a little afraid to try. You can't even taste the actual snail because it's covered in oil, garlic, and pesto - a great bread dipper sauce. Worth it to order just for that! Others had the steak frites, but I chose the poulet. I thought the chicken was a step above the steak, but the steak was a solid dish. It certainly depends what you are in the mood for.

We ordered off the Restaurant Week menu and started with the house salad and potato leek soup. The salad was ordinary, the soup was divine! Tasty, creamy, and so delicious I wanted to lick the bowl. For entrees, we ordered the roasted chicken with mushrooms and onion frites. The chicken was well cooked but still moist. It was engulfed by the heaping stack of onion rings on top of it--less may have been more here. Our other entree was the trout with fresh citrus, capers, brown butter & haricots verts--also well prepared and flavorful. I think I actually liked the fish better than the chicken, which is their house specialty.  For dessert, we shared the pot-de-crème au chocolat and the profiteroles.

My dining companion had gotten a gift certificate for this restaurant, but even though the cert. was for a pretty large amount, BC is a little above our price range.  So we opted for brunch, which has a more reasonably-priced menu.  The restaurant was beautiful, and we were seated by the window, which gave me a lovely view of the closed-for-the-Winter courtyard.  Really made me long for Spring. As for the menu, there were quite a few items I was debating on, but I settled for the crab cakes, and my companion ordered the steak and eggs.  We also each ordered a cocktail - a mimosa for me, and a mimosa campagne for him.  My mimosa was delicious, but his was even better, with that added ginger flavor.  I'm getting one next time.  ;) I think our issue was that we ordered poorly.  The crab cakes were nothing like I was expecting - the texture turned my stomach, and the flavor was just so far from any crab cakes I'd ever had before, and I wasn't a fan.  Even the potato hash was disappointing to me, because it contained red peppers, which in my opinion are universally overpowering, though the boy liked them just fine.  The only thing I truly liked about this dish was the poached eggs.  As for his dish, he liked the potatoes, as I mentioned, but the sauce that was put on the steak ruined it for him.  Maybe we're just not French, but these dishes were not our cup of tea. The reason I want to give it another shot, however, is because I'm dying to try one of the sweet brunch options, like the crepes and the french toast.  For me, you just can't go wrong with these.  But I guess we'll see.",0.9942,0.788,0.176,0.036,0.5142857142857142

We got there early because I feared parking would be horrific (It was) and waited almost 40 minutes to be seated.  I wouldn't have minded too much but there is absolutely no good place to wait .  People waiting for a table jam up in the front of the restaurant and end up hovering over other tables and blocking the exit.  That's not good.  However, once we got seated, the service was fantastic.  I don't really know how the staff manages to  do such a good job without being obtrusive; but I suspect there is some magic involved. Dinner was excellent, and I finally found out why their mac and cheese is $17.  It's drop-dead good.  Everyone seemed to have a good time, and when the staff realized that something was going on, they brought me my dessert with a candle on it (They didn't sing, thank goodness!) and we ended up talking to the waiter about what the celebration was about. The food there won't be to everyone's taste, and some will think that the prices are too high.  I have no problem with either.  I do have a problem with the lack of parking and the abysmal lack of space in which to wait for a table.  Still, the service more than made up for it, and that's really what counts in the end,  isn't it? Oh, and as we left, there was a couple standing in the street, macking on each other.  If that was you, you folks need to do that in private.  Seriously.  A kiss is one thing, but that was getting kind of close to horizontal, people.",0.8941,0.784,0.114,0.102,0.5291071428571428

We capped off dinner with a very thick chocolate pudding (me) and the daily special sorbets (him).  The white peach flavored sorbet was out of this world, though I would gladly have bathed in the pudding if at all possible.  A fabulous meal, fit for kings.  I might only be able to live so well one day a year, but I'm glad I picked Bistro Campagne to go wild in.",0.9968,0.762,0.211,0.027,0.5719980694980695

The private area is a beautiful little space and they temporarily converted one side of the room to echo the charm of a chapel. With the flowers and candlelight - it was a memorable site.

2010-12-09,4.0,"Mom has been wanting to come here for over a year now. We utilized a  restaurant.com  certificate and made a holiday excursion out of it. I'm giving a 4 star review, because Mom enjoyed herself so much and her lamb was really very good and plentiful. I also loved the decor and the feel of the place and the service was very good, so yeah 4 stars works. If I based the review solely on my personal experience, it would be more like 3 stars. I had the escargot appetizer. It was ok, but I think the snails would have been better served in a simple garlic butter. For a main entree, I had the duck. It was ok, though the breast slices were rather tough. I came close to sending it back, but didn't. Chris had the steak, which had good flavor, but again I found nothing exciting or memorable about it. He also had the French onion soup, which was decent, but not particularly exciting. The creme brulee for dessert was good, but again, I certainly have had better. I admit I was a bit annoyed because they did not have any specials for the day. I was hoping to try the marrow bones or the braised ox tails, but alas it was not to be. Mom wants to come back in the summer and sit outside, so I know I will be back one of these days.

I took my girlfriend on a date; we booked on OpenTable and showed up about 15 minutes early but were seated immediately. I had the roasted chicken and she had the braised short rib, both of which were excellent (the chicken is apparently a specialty of theirs, though I actually preferred the short rib, it literally melted in my mouth and was the best short rib I can remember having). We also got a cheese and bacon gratin potato as an appetizer (it's listed as a side dish) which she liked a lot and I thought was merely ok. Their beer list was a good selection of microbrews and included some local and personal favorites (Matilda and Stone Levitation specifically), though it was not the same as the beer and wine list on their website. Service was good, quick, and polite, so no complaints there. Overall, I had a great meal at a reasonable price (entrees were in the low to mid 20s), and will definitely be eating here again!

Fantastic salmon special and a well recommended wine. Also, they have a North Shore Gin (its local!), which I had never had before. Of course, desserts were top notch, my date got the apple tart which was amazing. I got my usual profiteroles, which, while good, need some component warmed.

2010-11-16,4.0,"I walked into Bistro Campagne a little earlier than my dining companion Lauren H, and was promptly seated. I immediately liked the decor and overall vibe of the place. It was cozy and warm and the jazzy French music selection was on point. It was actually quite romantic. Wait, Lauren picked this place. Was she trying to seduce me?! Sacrebleu!  When Lauren arrived we moved outside to the patio since it was a somewhat warm night in November and it was heated. We simply had to seize what was surely to be the last alfresco dining of the year. I was very excited and knew what I wanted thanks to the yelping the place ahead of time. For me it was the all you can eat mussels and frites on Tuesdays! Yay! Yummo! That's a great deal, as I love mussels. Then ,Lauren had to go and burst my bubble and tell me it was Wednesday. Ugh.  After accepting the cold hard fact that it was not Tuesday ,I opted to order the roasted chicken instead and Lauren and I split a crab cake. The crab cake almost dropped Bistro Campagne down to 3 stars, but the flavorful, moist chicken made me reconsider. The crab cake, if I can call it that, was a flavorless, expensive, chewy, overcooked sponge. It took forever to be served. Pass on it. The roasted chicken served on top of a wild mushroom ragout with a side of frites however, don't pass on it! It was fantastic that night and even better the next day.  I was successfully seduced, but being as my friend and I are two straight females, we ended the night with a hug.",0.989,0.819,0.159,0.021,0.5396329365079364
2010-11-16,5.0,"I love this place but I admit that I'm a little bias. I've been frequenting this place so long that I've become friends with the staff. That being said, I wouldn't be frequenting so often if it weren't that good. First of all the cuisine at this restaurant is mostly local, mostly organic, and entirely free range. A good portion of the produce and meat come from Mennonite and Amish farms from around the mid west. That means that those like me who generally don't eat meat because of ethical issues dealing with the mass production of animals can do some guilt free critter eating. However, there is always at least one rotating vegetarian dish on the menu and there is always the amazing mac-n-cheese a.k.a. Gratin de Macaroni which is so good that it's worth a visit on it's own. This months vegetarian dish is two buckwheat crepes filled with wild mushrooms smothered in cheese. The dish is more complicated than that but I don't have the menu in front of me to list the combination of cheeses or the contents of the sauce. It's a very hearty dish so if you want to save room for desert (which you do) then I don't recommend an appetizer. I'm also not a compulsive dessert eater but I think that I sometimes order dinner here as a pretext for dessert. The Pot-de-Crème au Chocolat - a dense milk chocolate pudding with crème Chantilly is exceptional as is the Gâteau d'amandes au chocolate - a warm Valrhona chocolate & almond cake with vanilla ice cream.  My favorite though is the Pain Perdu - bread pudding which has recently been switched from fig with caramel to dark chocolate with cherry. There are few pairings as amazing as dark chocolate with peaty scotch and the chocolate-cherry bread pudding with a nice glass of Laphroaig is a combination made in heaven. I recommend the scotch without ice with maybe a splash of hot water to open the flavor. In summary; the atmosphere is that of a small bistro in the setting of a Victorian house. They do except a number of walk ins but if you have a party of 4 or more I highly recommend calling in advance, especially on the weekend. If you are dining alone the bar is a wonderful place to read a book or chat with the bartender or other bar diners. In the summer the patio is a must, at least once. There is an exceptional wine list and a smaller but wonderful beer list with a number of beers you won't find at most other places. The food is great for flexitarians who don't object to eating meat but abhor the practices of the meat industry. There aren't many vegetarian dishes but the ones they do have are well worth a visit. I do not recommend this place for vegans. bon appetit!",0.9953,0.765,0.166,0.069,0.5770068027210884

I wanted to use my alacard so the lovely Dallas and I went last night. we were fortunate enough to have a night warm enough to sit outside on their patio, which was lovely and earned the third star.   We started with a crab cake which took a while to be served, and I understood why when it was served--it was very overcooked, rubbery, and bland. I had been so excited for it after reading some other reviews and it may have been one of the worse crab cakes I have ever eaten.  My trout was well cooked but I thought it was also bland--until I realized the seasoning had all just pooled under some food in the corner of the plate. Once I took the caper sauce and spread it out, it was better. But still not a wow. My friend, however, really liked her roasted chicken. I thought her accompanying frites were okay but I have had better, last week even. They did not have the fig pudding as it is seasonal (insert sad face here), so I passed on dessert.  The service was adequate.

2010-11-01,3.0,"I went in really wanting to like this place and it just didn't really happen for me.   I have never been one to complain of slow service. The way I look at it is that most places worth eating at are going to be popular and hopefully most stuff is made fresh.  Both of these two factors = sometimes slow service.  What I do judge is how the server handles it.  We had a drink and an appetizer in the first hour and fifteen minutes.  Didn't even see him most of the time so couldn't order and extra drink or ask for bread.   To me that is slow - and it was totally unacknowledged, never once was there an explanation or even a hint of an apology.  Plus he spent like 15 minutes grab-assing with the table next to us bull sh#ting about a trip to Europe.  Even after all this, I would have forgiven the speed had the food done more to impress. The mussels at the beginning of the meal were good (wouldn't put them at the top of the Chicago list - have had better at a few places) My wife's chicken was solid (4.5 star worthy here - so if you go I highly recommend the roasted chicken) My lamb was very average (almost below average).  I had seen a handful of people order it as I walked through the restaurant - which is usually a great sign.  I asked the server what the chef recommends and he said medium rare (which is how I like it).  The lamb came out and there was blood tricking away from the chops.  Now I know this can happen and at that temp juices can run.  However I was surprised they just mixed the sauce with it, and didn't make an effort to wipe the plate.  And they were underdone (even for med rare).  All of this I still would have forgiven, I do not have a ""weak stomach"" when it comes to meat temp - I was OK with it.  But it was totally under-seasoned and the sauce didn't add anything either.  Closing my eyes I would have a hard time even distinguishing what protein I was even eating.  For this level of restaurant I was expecting better. I will likely give them another shot - but I was pretty under-whelmed.",0.9823,0.871,0.122,0.008,0.5289999999999999

It was a little windy out for the patio but they had heaters out there and it looked lovely. The food was all very delicious. It was your usual bistro type fare but done very well and reasonably priced. The service was great although the waiter had a really quiet voice that was a little hard to hear at times. The only thing I didn't love was the crab cake that was more like a crab souffle or mousse. I wasn't expecting it to be so different than a usual crab cake. It wasn't bad - just different. The steak frites was awesome and the duck confit was equally as good.  I definitely will go back soon!,0.9934,0.678,0.289,0.032,0.556845238095238

We had 5:30 reservations and therefore scored prime seats on the back portion of the outdoor seating area.  That patio is made out of magic--magic, I tell you!  The string lights, the trees, the absence of street noise, the perfect late-summer evening weather...you couldn't script it any better.   The service was excellent again; Veronique took great care of us and even apologized when our meal was delayed because she hadn't asked my dad how he wanted his liver cooked.   None of the food  knocked me out of my chair, but I enjoyed every dish.  The calamari appetizer was surprisingly plain but satisfactory.  I very much liked the Salade Oeuf Meurette - baby spinach with red wine-poached egg, bacon lardoons, and violette mustard -- but it was rather wetter than I like my salads. My entree was very, very good--one of the evening's specials, a barramundi with baby spinach, fingerling potatoes, carmelized red onion, and clams steamed in red pepper and Campari.  Mmmmm. We took a pass on dessert, as we planned a gelato outing afterwards.  However, we did linger for quite some time over coffee, enjoying the setting and the company.  We were never rushed or even vaguely hinted at to move along; in fact, a two-top near us sat, served, and cleared two parties in the time that we were there.   I'm going to say five stars if you can sit on the back patio on a perfect evening; still four stars if you are in the noisy (but still cozy and charming) interior.",0.9914,0.845,0.144,0.011,0.4561309523809523

To start, I ordered the french onion au gratin soup and it was delicious. I split a salad with my daughter and we had the three lettuces with pistaccios, dried prune, and gorgonzola.  Wow!  My husband ordered the special salad of the day which was very nice, too, with grilled peach and some french cheese?  I'm not sure but my husband said it was mild and very good. At our table of six, three of us ordered the steak frites, which were delicious and cooked perfectly with a rich Bordeaux sauce.  I actually don't like anything on my steak but this was good. Maybe a little too rich because I could not finish my 6 filet mignon. The frites were good, too.  However, we ordered the macaroni and cheese and then no one could eat their frites! Our son ordered the roasted chicken, which he said was very flavorful but almost too much with all the fried onions on top of it!  (He ate most of it!)  My one daughter ordered the sliced pork and said it was very good and would order it again.  My birthday daughter ordered a vegetarian meal with sauteed vegetables from the farm surrounded by puff pastry, almost a vegetable wellington and she really raved about it. For dessert, everyone ordered something different with rave reviews: Lemon tart, profiteroles w/ice cream (3 of them filled with ice cream!), creme brulee (a generous portion, too!),  chocolate almond cake, fig bread pudding and pot au creme.  I personally tasted them all and would recommend all of them for your tastes!  The true winners would be the fig bread pudding and the pot au creme with Valrona chocolate, which was what I had ordered and had to slap spoons to keep them out! of my chocolate.  I would go back just for that alone! There was a guitarist in the background, who was jus ""ok"".  Being a family of musicians and artists, I think Bistro Campagne needs someone to sing Edith Pilaf songs, with perhaps a background guitarist and maybe a smooth, light bass or small accordian.

For entrees, my friend had the pan fried pork, which she really enjoyed.  I wish I had tried a couple bites of hers, but I was too busy focusing on my braised short ribs served in a lovely broth with leeks, carrots and potatoes...with roasted bone marrow.  Roasted bone marrow.  This was a little taste of heaven, though I expected it to be a bit more creamy.  It was buttery and full of marrow-y flavorful goodness.   We forced ourselves to order cappucciono and share creme brulee.  I can't  say anything bad about creme brulee as it's my most favorite way to eat anything custard.   This is still in my top choices for places to go in Chicago.",0.9931,0.748,0.225,0.027,0.5839213564213563

Go a little early, because the space will be full by 8:00, though the staff will never rush you through your meal or out the door. Service is attentive, friendly, and deferential.  In addition to a good, focused wine list, they have an equally well-curated beer list that's well worth considering. Belgian and French-style real ales (from Europe, Canada, and the USA), and wheat beers, served at the right temperatures and in the right vessels.  The food is very fresh. Salads and first courses are light, with simple garnishes, dressings, or sauces. The house salad and the French onion soup, in particular, stand out.  Main courses are well-executed with local and organic ingredients whenever possible. Fish is cooked slightly long, to be flaky instead of moist; blessedly, steak is cooked not to government standards but to order: ask for rare and you get rare. You'll also get a nice portion of vegetables with everything. Dessert is a little less interesting, but it isn't clear that they have a pastry chef so I can't knock them too much for that.  Whether you sit inside, in one of several small rooms, or outside in the garden, you're in for a good experience. And to make things easy, they take reservations through Open Table.

There was 3 different ones, duck liver, venison and pork. It came with an AWESOME assortment of pickled vegetables and fresh mustard and 2 slices of rye bread. LOVED the pate, thought it was much better than the pate plate from Mado. My boyfriend ordered the lamb with beans and I had the beef short ribs with roasted bone marrow and spring vegetables in a light stock.  There's pretty much NOTHING better in the world than short rib. These were super moist and tender. I had to order more bread to dip in the soup...ughh so satisfying! The roasted bone marrow came with chimicurri sauce and horseradish sauce. Both were good but not really necessary.  Bf's lamb was very tender but the olive tapenade kind of overwhelmed the flavors of the lamb. OH! And we shared a side of seasonal vegetables in a butter and herb sauce. Oh god those mushrooms with the short ribs...it's like the best combination of flavors and textures!!!

Tragically, the beautiful warm day was also quite windy, so the outdoor patio was closed.  However, we were seated right next to three windows, where we could feel the sun and the breeze, and gaze into the patio.  The decor of the restaurant was beautiful, and you do feel like you are in the French countryside. We began with cocktails - a Manhattan for him, a Maria-Tini with me.  Mine was delicious - who knew vanilla vodka and Absolut Peach were such an enchanting combo?  Now I know.  Warm, crusty bread soon arrived with butter that spread easily.  Munch munch. Our appetizers were escargot, and the mussels.  We like our shelled creatures, yes we do.  The mussels were really divine - best I've had in the city, and there were so many of them!  We made short work of their delicious selves.  The escargot were also the best I've had anywhere, and they arrived sizzling hot.  As I think everyone knows, the best part of escargot is the luscious garlicky sauce in which they arrive - and we were scraping up every last bit with the bread. My male counterpart ordered the roast chicken, and I ordered the duck.  We love our poultry.  The duck dish was, as the waitress explained, extremely light.  A small (and thus, finishable) portion of beautifully cooked duck breast over delicate orzo, with very balanced flavors of Picholine olives (my favorite olives, btw) and preserved meyer lemons.    Hello gorgeous.  It would be a great dish for someone who loves French food but doesn't want to be rolled out the door on the way out.   I assisted my boyfriend with his roast chicken, which was juicy and flavorful - and do NOT neglect to eat the skin!  The skin makes the dish - crispy and delightful.  His plate was also loaded with, what I imagine are called ""onion fries"".  They were addicting, like the best onion rings you've ever had, only wee tiny. No dessert, we were too darn full. Prices were fair considering that much of their food is locally-grown/organic.  The food here is simple but superb - classic French.  I can't find a flaw in our experience here, start to finish, thus the rare and elusive five-star rating.  Go eat here now.",0.993,0.809,0.155,0.037,0.5531498015873015

Well we head to Bistro Campagne, another one of those Check Please restaurants (still trying to be a reviewer if you remember).  There are seven of us today in our group.  We arrive for our 6:00 pm reservations and the place is quite empty.  It is a cute little place with different rooms for eating.  We start with drinks, a Crab Cake appetizer, two bowls of Split Pea soup (with bacon in it) and a bowl of French Onion soup.  They also bring out bread and hummus.  Everything was good.  I think the free bread and hummus was probably the best so far but then again I am not a big fan of Split Pea soup.  Maria did think the Crab Cake was out of this world.  Usually she says it is more breading and less crab but this time it was the opposite. Well for our main course 5 of us actually ordered the Steak Friter with thin onionized fries.  This again was good.  Nobody is raving about things so far but they also are not complaining.  My youngest son ordered his usual Cheese Burger.  I really think he should write a book reviewing cheese burgers.  That is usually all he orders no matter where we go.  My oldest daughter ordered the Grilled Salmon.  This was also good.  Actually not that usual heavy fish taste that Salmon has.  She of course let Dad sample her dinner, she is the best you know. On to dessert, which we did order (except for my youngest son who is not a big dessert fan).  I ordered a Mango and Orange Sorbet.  Which the mango was good but the orange was horrible.  We also ordered 2 Bread Puddings, 1 Creme Brulee and 1 Pot-de-Creme.  Again our desserts were average to go along with the rest of our meal. I will say from a negative side the service, though very friendly was exceptionally slow for a Thursday night.  I don't think that was our server's (Aneta) fault because she was around a lot, actually so was the guy filling the water glasses.  But it did take forever for the food to make it to our plates.  I think in total we were there for well over two hours.  Also Bistro was very expensive!!  Our total bill for the night came to roughly $320 including the tip.  That was appetizers, main courses, desserts, non-alcohol drinks and a tip to cover seven people.  That is roughly $45 dollars a person!! Also I will have to mention, with a big group I usually mention when it is someone's birthday in the group.  Because most, if not all places will give the birthday person a free dessert.  Well Bistro did not!  I thought that was unusual considering how much we did spend. Overall we all left full and happy.  Nobody was complaining, but no one was jumping up and down and raving about Bistro Campagne.  It was nice to try (I always say it is nice to try a new place, I LOVE food) but I don't think we will be heading back anytime soon.",0.9948,0.838,0.126,0.037,0.47144612794612784

The quaint maisonnette or cottage is perfect to bring the mother and aunts to for a special occasions.  They'll eat it up!  Not only the food but also the adorable ambiance with mosaic tiles, charming lamps and little nooks and crannies that bring character to each side of the restaurant.  There's also a gorgeous garden for the spring and summer to be enjoyed.  The entire experience transports you to a French countryside bistro for a splendid meal. I knew that if I was going to a French brunch, that I was going all out with a hearty breakfast steak.  I sliced right in to their Petit Steak Frites which was to die for!  It was marinated perfectly with some green concoction that was stated in the menu as ""maitre d' butter"".  I of course had to order my eggs over-easy so they'd drenched my steak with more flavor.  Doesn't get any better than this!  I'd love to return for their dinner menu which people rave about.

2010-01-18,3.0,"Honestly?  For the money I spent on brunch, I wanted it to be much more memorable.  It's not that I didn't like Bistro Campagne, because I did, it's just that for the price point, I expected it to be SO much better. First things first: I made the executive decision to have a total 'fat kid' meal.  Counting the calories is ridiculously hard and sometimes you need an absolutely fabulous, fancy, rich, lusty and all-out yummy brunch, right?  French food can definitely get the job done.  EVERYTHING on the menu at Bistro Campagne is calorie-ridden, so don't go in expecting anything remotely healthy.  Ya ain't gonna find it. Fatty intensions decided upon, I was initially going to get the eggs Florentine, but when I heard the day's special, a burger served open faced on rye bread with caramelized onions and mushrooms, topped with a sunny-side up egg and served with a side of potato latkes, I couldn't resist.  Beef.  Shrooms.  Latkes.  Egg.  Sold.  I can't deal with eggs looking at me or raw beef, so I asked for my burger to be a bit more medium-well and my egg to be cooked over hard.  I know, I know.  Asking for trouble. When it came, there were some problems.  The inside was completely undercooked.  I'm talking ""I can still see the meat grinder patterns in the middle"" raw, not just a little pink.  Sigh.  I had to send it back.  It came back to my plate absolutely burnt to a crisp.  Because I was too hungry at this point to argue, I sucked it up and ate my burger.   The verdict?  Drrryyyy.  This sucker was begging for a sauce of some sort.  I suppose if I ordered the egg sunny-side up, the yolk would have served as the sauce.  However, I wish the waitress would have urged me to order something else if that was the case.  I will say, though, that the latkes were amazing.  They were served with a thick, creamy chive dip and were perfectly seasoned.  Loved them!  I also ordered a side of pomme frites (I always do at French restaurants) to share with the table.  While I wish they were a touch crispier, the garlic aioli served on the side was wonderful!  A must-try for Bistro Campagne virgins. Service was fine.  The restaurant is lovely.  I don't know, though.  I ended up paying about $34 (with tax and tip) for 1 cup of tea, 1 mimosa, a burger and a side of glorified french fries.  That seems excessive.",0.9915,0.798,0.147,0.056,0.4834519647019647

I decided for 4 stars because after all - to deserve 5 stars I have to really like everything they make a lot, right? I mean, I want to be believable after all. Anyway - Bistro Campagne is a wonderful little place. I loved the ambience, I loved that French people are working there and most of all, I love that they cook with locally grown, organic products. Yes, I am one of those people who kind of cares about that. I also think that this kind of food simply tastes better. We started our dinner with the onion strudel and the onion soup. The onion soup was tasty and very cheesy. The onion strudel was one of these out of this world dishes. I am yearning for it right now, just thinking about it. As entrees we had the chicken (Poulet Rôti Forestière) with wild mushroom ragout and a giant pile of fried onions on top (I would not recommend any of those dishes to be eaten on a first date) and the steak frites. Both tasted ok, neither were amazing. The steak came with the maitre'd butter which was lovely.  The chicken itself was very tender - the problem for me was the wild mushroom ragout. Because this mushroom ragout was just mushrooms sauteed in oil. Maybe I had a bad batch, I don't know but this is not what I know to be a mushroom ragout. And believe me - I am Austrian - I know what a mushroom ragout is supposed to look and taste like. Also the fried onions - while tasty - made me feel like I was at a fast-food steak-house instead of an slightly upscale French restaurant. It was just too greasy and too much. I know there are a lot of people who would order this dish because of exactly the reasons I don't like it though. But then the desert. We shared the fig-bread pudding which came with vanilla ice-cream and caramel sauce. This desert is one of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Ever, ever. It was just perfect. I can definitely recommend this restaurant - personally I would chose different entrees next time but it is worth to go there simply for their onion strudel and fig-bread pudding.",0.9966,0.769,0.187,0.044,0.5015252976190477

I also recommend eating a lot of bread - it's surprisingly difficult to find quality French bread in this country, but Bistro Campagne gets it exactly right. The crusts are wonderfully crunchy and crisp, while the insides are perfectly soft. Butter only detracts from bread this good. Entrees run from $12 (Croque Monsieur) to $24 (Côte de Porc à la Bière). The Boeuf Bourguignon is $23.

Food- I ordered the chicken with mushrooms and onion strings um HOLY HEAVEN. It was so good and so much food i ate myself into a food coma. The chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy and had a delicious creamy mushroomy sauce underneath. The onion strings were piled high and really good. Other dishes at the table were the salmon which got good reviews and the Boeuf Bourguignon (sp?) which was highly recommended but I thought underseasoned so not as good as I'd hoped. The fries and mac and cheese were delicious- we shared for the table. We were all too stuffed for dessert. Ok on to my not so favorite parts- It's really far away for me, I live downtown so not really worth a $20 cab both ways and would take forever on the CTA. The decor is a little odd- kind of like a preschool on the walls with ceramic hand painted leaves- I would like it more if the lighting were a bit more dim, if the walls were painted with warm colors instead of a weird mural, also there was a draft and it was freezing.

The woman who served us was French, and she had a great sense of humor, helped us with the menu, and was an all around-delight. She started off with a formal wine service (for our two bottles), but let us pour our own as the dinner progressed. Some would see that as inattentive, but I rather like pacing myself. 2. The food was delicious. My husband had the best whitefish he's ever had (paired with a apple/leek salad). My salmon was grilled perfectly, not at all overdone. The mussels we had for an appetizer were flavorful and every one of them was fresh. We ended with the fig bread pudding. Fabulous. 3.

2009-10-29,4.0,"It's hard to find ""rustic"" French food; for some reason, ""French food"" in the US usually just means ""pretentious food."" I love the flavor spectrum of French food (who wouldn't), but am usually put-off by snobby atmospheres and sky-high prices. If I'm going to pay to go out to eat, I want to pay for the food, not the tuxedo the waiter is wearing.  The food here is mind-blowingly good, and not pretentious at all. Specifically, I'm referring to the bone marrow appetizer. Don't even think about not getting it. We asked the waitress if it was good, and she said it's like ""meat-flavored butter."" That was all I needed to hear. You spoon it out of the bone, and schmear it on toast and sprinkle on some sea-salt. Holy Crap. Possibly the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. Everything else I had was also excellent, including the frites. I do appreciate that they have items on the menu which most Americans are afraid of, like rabbit. I ordered the rabbit in a mustard sauce, and it was quite good, but I prefer rabbit braised, on the bone. This was like a boneless skinless chicken breast. The mustard sauce could have had a bit more heat, but that's just my preference. Preferences aside, the quality was excellent. The bread pudding, as well, was excellent.  The only real drawback to this place is how uncomfortably tight the dining room is. If it's warm out, sit outside. It's one of the nicest al fresco spots in the city.  The prices aren't cheap, but not unreasonable either. They have a selection of french sandwiches which sounded awesome, and they were all around $10.

The setting is cute..looks like a house out of a children's book with a nice patio.  It is romantic and cute setting. That's basically about it. Not to generalize or be stereotypical..but if you are in your mid/late 50's and appear to be loaded, your service will be a lot better. Our waiter looked at us and said ""let's make this quick, I'm very busy."" Maybe this guy just got off his shift at Ed Debevics..but  that didn't sound like ""how you folk doing, would you like some drinks"" We sat about 15 minutes before, he finally felt comfortable enough to stop him and order our drinks.   The rest of the night was him ""laughing and making small talk"" with the three couples in their 50's and him just passing us by. Oh but the best part of the night, is when I ordered my dish and asked if the dish could be made without ham said it couldn't, and I said ok.

2009-09-15,4.0,"I held a bridal shower brunch at Bistro Campagne a few weeks ago. It was a cute little shower and everyone enjoyed themselves. The positives about the Bistro are: 1. The location is perfect. They are located on Lincoln Avenue right on the strip of restaurants in Lincoln Square. There was a parking lot on the other side of the street so all my guests would be able to park easily. 2. The space is adorable. The small semi-private cottage has walls adored with mixed media murals of flowers and stained glass. The mission style wood work adds to the quaint feel. The garden is private and feels like you're out of the city in a small town. Everything was serene and cozy. 3. The food was delicious. Everything was fresh, and each dish had a bit of a twist on the traditional to make it feel ""special"" 4. The wait-staff was understanding of the late pace of my guests. We didn't feel rushed. The negatives are: 1. The planning of a shower was difficult. -Getting ahold of the person in charge of planning the party was difficult. The rest of the staff was not aware of my reservation I made in advance. -Once I was there picking out the menu, I was told some key items, like French toast and Crepes were not an option because the chef could not make them all at once. I also had to wait around for a long time, 2 hours, to make my final reservation. I felt a bit put off by that.  -I felt like the wait-staff and management gave off the impression that they believed they were a little more upscale than they were since they were not very accommodating to someone who had a 25 person guaranteed reservation. 2. The wait-staff at the brunch were not quite aware of everything that I had agreed upon, like fruit bowls on the table when the guest arrived. Overall, though, I would host another small party at the Bistro. I'd make sure to make all the decisions at once so I wouldn't have to chase the planning person.  I also would love to try this restaurant for another meal other than brunch! The atmosphere and food make up for the minor short comings of the overall staff.",0.9936,0.846,0.142,0.012,0.5443426943426944
2009-09-09,5.0,"Bistro Campagne is such a great neighborhood restaurant.  The food is consistently delicious, the service is always friendly, and the ambience is warm and inviting.  We have dined here on several occasions -- twice for dinner and three times for brunch.   The brunch is outstanding -- best brunch I have had in Chicago -- better than all the top brunch spots.  And the best part is that there is never any wait, unlike the typical 1 -2 hour waits that accompany the brunch hot spots around Chicago.   Dinner is always wonderful as well.  The menu consists of traditional French comfort food but somehow avoids being overly heavy.  Our last dining experience, this past Sat. evening, was the best so far.  We went there for an 8:30 PM reservation with my parents who were visiting from out of town.  Our waiter was so great.  I am kicking myself for not remembering his name for this review.  He was friendly and very knowledgable about the menu.  We started with three appetizers -- the bacon croquettes (on special) which were decadent and delicious, the watermelon salad (on special) which combined unique flavors perfectly for a fabulous light starter, and the tomato and feta cheese plate which exhibited delicious, fresh from the farm tomatoes.  For entrees, my parents both got the trout and I had the rabbit -- both were recommended by the waiter, and both lived up to his descriptions.  My parents loved their trout dishes and were equally impressed with how the trout were raised prior to arriving at the restaurant.  My rabbit was amazing!  The meat was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was so creamy and delicious.  My husband got the pork chop and was very happy with his meal as well.  We all contemplated dessert as the menu looked so good, but were all so full, we decided not to go that route in the end.  Between the four of us, we had one bottle of wine, one cocktail, three appetizers, and four entrees, and the meal came to just over $200 with tip -- really reasonable for a high quality Sat. night dinner.",0.9987,0.745,0.25,0.005,0.6346482683982684

I had to agree - just spicy enough to be zippy without burning your mouth, and with good tomato flavor.  The menu says it's a house-made mix, and I believe it.  It's clearly not made of the same stuff most other bars are using and tastes fresh rather than canned. But girl can not live on Bloody Marys alone, so for brunch I ordered the mac and cheese (yes, mac and cheese on a brunch menu!  brilliant!).  This is some great mac and cheese - at first I was disappointed because the portion seemed small, but the mac and cheese was extremely rich.  I finished all of it because it was so good, but I probably shouldn't have.  I also got to try my friend's Croque Madame (basically ham and cheese on a brioche topped with a fried egg).  This hadn't really jumped out on me on the menu, but it was fantastic.  Better than my mac and cheese, even.  I'm plotting a return visit as soon as possible to get it....and another Bloody Mary.  Or two.  The ambiance is really nice, very sunny and bright and our table of six didn't feel crowded at all.  Our server was sweet and attentive without being obtrusive and my coffee and water were refilled frequently.  I guess it can also be very romantic (probably at night).  I later found out that Bistro Campagne is where my friend's husband had proposed to her.  Awwww.   Bloody Marys and love, how can you go wrong?",0.9978,0.729,0.202,0.07,0.6261403093434339
2009-07-26,4.0,"My boyfriend and I came upon this place while meandering about looking for a spot to have a nice cold martini after digging through vinyl at Laurie's Planet of Sound. The set up of the establishment is unique and has a beautiful ambiance. We were sat outdoors in a little garden that overlooked the rest of the patio. After sipping on the organic vodka gimlet martinis, which were amazing by the way, and we try to do the right thing even with our alcohol. We decided we definitely wanted to have an appetizer to nosh on so we were then sat at a table in the middle of the patio. Fantastic! It allowed for a great view of the restaurant both in and out. If you have never been there the construction appears to be someones house as well as an old coach house. We asked our waitress if that was the case and she told us that it used to be some old office building that the owner came in and redesigned by implementing wood trim and accents all about. It's a beautiful spot and you don't even feel like you are in the city.  While glancing over the menu we decided to try the escargot. I hadn't had it in so long that I couldn't even remember the last time I had indulged in it. It arrived in what appeared to be some type of pesto garlic butter sauce that it was baked in. It was good, but we are both are partial to our escargot dripping in buttery goodness, nevertheless we ate it all.  Next we asked our waitress for a recommendation for dinner because we were torn between the spring trout and the halibut. We decided to go with the spring trout and it was fantastic. It was served on top of a shaved fennel salad and it was perfect to share because it was plated with two fillets. We also ordered the creamy buttery mashed potatoes, which melted in your mouth. An arugula based salad with a generous amount of beets and shaved asparagus and a light dill cream vinaigrette. We found everything to be light and just delicious. At one point I told my boyfriend how happy I was to be eating such a wonderful meal . I am a vegetarian, but I do eat fish, so sometimes it can be tough when we go out to dinner. The service was spot on and our waitress told us that most of the staff had been working there for years which is rare to find in the service industry. Half way through I had finished my gimlet and was looking over the wine list for a glass of champagne. I absolutely LOVE champagne and our waitress recommended a nice reasonably priced glass that matched perfectly to what we had ordered. It was a great balance between dry and sweet. Once through we then were offered the dessert menu and I was pleasantly surprised to find so many options that sounded fantastic. I am usually partial to the after dinner drink as my dessert, but there were so many wonderful sounding options to choose from so we definitely had to try at least one! We went with the fig and brown sugar bread pudding with vanilla ice cream as well as the pommeau, an after dinner digestif. It went really nicely together, because the pommeau had a tartness to it that offset the brown sugary goodness of the bread pudding. It was so good!  This is a great spot for a date or to have a nice relaxing dinner with friends. We will definitely be back!",0.9993,0.774,0.217,0.008,0.6509883198562444

Had great appetizers of crab cakes and a chilled soup.  Also the bread and hummus type spread (gratis) were top notch bistro fare.  On to the entrees- my lamb was served with nicely seasoned fava beans but the meat was tough.  Several had the halibut and raved about it.  Onion tart was also sooo French and tasty.  The coffee is fantastic served hot and so rich.  Not sure if it is their own blend but it is worth savoring with dessert.  Two of us had dessert. My special plum tart with goat cheese gave new meaning to the word ""tart"" causing a bitter after taste.  This needed a bit of sugar.  Husband's bread pudding was heavy but then again so is bread pudding.   Will certainly go back due to the ambiance and food but this night was a bit off  in our rating due to wine service and the server leaving for periods of time.

I've been here before, about two years ago, and thought it was awesome then. This time, I found it, well, Excellent. We were seated in the annex, I guess you'd call it that, inside the courtyard inside. We started with drinks, I thought wine, but a beer (Jever) seemed like a better choice, it was a Chicago summer day, and that means humid. My friends went with Chimay. The bread arrived, crispy on the outside, warm inside, very nice. As appetiser's we decided on the Ox tails and the roasted marrow bones. The oxtails were done just right, a sweetness that made them melt in your mouth. The marrow, I've never had it before, this seemed like a good time to try them, and I wasn't disappointed. It was rich, the grilled onions with it were outstanding, a great start to the meal. For the main course, I went with the roast chicken with wild mushrooms, my guest both had the pork shoulder and loin. Wow. The chicken was done perfectly, the mushroom flavor was excellent with it, and it was amazing. The pork was outstanding, we're a group that believes in sharing our meals. Now, I've admitted to friends that the first time I went to Frontera I got all teary-eyed at the food, it was that good. I was pretty close to that here. I forgot to say the service was outstanding, our waiter was there when we needed him but he didn't hover over us, the other members of the staff were at the ready with water, I'm a big water drinker so that was great, they took the plates away once they saw you were finished. The area we were in was loud, there were a couple of larger groups near us, it got pretty almost can't think loud, but I was enjoying my food too much to care.

For appetizers we had the mussels, which were absolutely delicious, and we had lobster for our main course. This was also cooked perfectly, with a lemon butter sauce. It was just the right amount of food. For dessert, we had the chocolate souffle. Divine.

2009-04-29,4.0,"Bistro Campagne, to me, is a special occasion establishment.  Why?  Not sure....it just feels that way to me.   It was a beautiful day.......but Spring in Chicago means way too cold to be sitting outside, though they do have a lovely patio area. Luis was our server and did an overall good job waiting on us as we placed our order of the scrambled eggs dish with bacon and my date had the Goat Cheese Crepes.  To top it all off 2 mimosas made for a pleasant experience, though I did have to wait for the server to return to order the second mimosa which removes one star as reading other reviews this seem to be an ongoing issue with the wait staff.  But the food was very good. The space is cozy with low ceilings and resembling a small country house, it possesses the look and feel of some small family run place in Europe which adds to its charm. Parking is good during the day, but as the evening progresses you may find even the public parking lot across the street a challenge to find parking.  Though the Brown line Western stop is just up the street, so you can go Green if you prefer.

I've been to so many restaurants of late where you book it for one time, but get in 30-60 minutes later. Makes you think what the point of a reservation is!  The ambiance and service was very warm and inviting. The place is very cozy and welcoming, likewise with the service.  Now the amazing part, the food. The food from start to finish was just awesome.

2009-01-30,2.0,"This place started really well. Cozy, nicely decorated. Once the waitress brought the wine list, I felt that something was off. The Cahors was advertised as a Bordeaux (of Malbec varietal which most Bordeaux are a blend and Malbec is not the primary varietal). Cahors is far from Bordeaux and definitely not the same type of wine.  The intent of the wine list was probably to make it accessible to most. I found it limiting to have so few choices of good wine. The trustworthy Vouvray my wife ordered was, as expected, good.  We were then greeted with a mixture of aioli and humus, not sure exactly what that was, but this was the second red flag. It did come with a tasty French mini baguette.  We ordered pate and the 3 different choices were good (a terrine, a duck pate and a chicken mousse).  I then ordered the Cassoulet. I should have been more careful. Lamb was advertised as part of the dish (where it has no place). It should have been my third red flag.  A dish arrived that had nothing of a real, traditional southwest France cassoulet. I was so disappointed I sent it back. I ordered ""Steak Frites"" just to be safe. Again dissapointing. The fries were prepared a little too American style and, while the meat was good and tender,  the sauce and the grilling were nothing to write home about. It was even a tiny bit too salty (likely because American salt was used). My wife had the grilled salmon. It tasted a little dry and did not have anything (sauces, herbs...) to go with it.  At this point we decided to get our bill and cut our losses. I was not looking forward to the prospect of profiteroles with spumoni ice cream or similar American influence on classic french food. Overall, this place is a mediocre rendition of what French bistro food is like and certainly not from southwest France.  If you want to dip your toe into French food this may be the place for you. If you are looking for traditional French fare (bistro style), there are many other restaurants in Chicago that do a better job. 2 stinky cheese.",0.9666,0.832,0.118,0.05,0.4259996947496948

Honestly it was the first time I have ever had it, and I really enjoyed how it melted in my mouth. We also had the Choux de Bruxelles which was an interesting sweet and savory dish, based on Brussels sprouts, grapes and bacon.......... This is when I discovered moms should put bacon with sprouts if they want their kid to eat them.  I had the steak frites, could have used some salt, other than that it was a solid hunk of meat, the fries were good but nothing unique about them. I wish they could have had an aioli with them, but the hummus from the baguette service was still available and waiting to be consumed with something. My companion had the Cassoulet which I found to be a rich cornucopia of meaty goodness. We had a chocolate cake desert which was filled with gooey goodness.  The Beer list was a short selection of some of the best European beers, organics, and premium domestic micros. Each beer was served in the proper glassware for the style. I appreciate any place which highlights their Trappist selections. Sorry Chad, no Miller Light here. They also have lucid absinthe as a digestif....

My husband ordered the steak tartare appetizer and it was very salty (we get much better at Laschets on Irving). I had a salad with goat cheese and everything looked nice, but the dressing was way over salted - just too much.

My mom and I ducked into Bistro Campagne, shaking freshly fallen snow out of our hair, and surveyed the bustling dining room...on a Wednesday night! Apparently many other diners in Lincoln Square felt the same way I did: that nothing warms the heart like a little mood lighting, heavy French accents (especially broken English peppered with French phrases and niceties) and a rich, flavorful meal with loved ones. Each meal starts with a paper-wrapped mini baguette with a garlicky hummus-like spread and, if you're like me, a bottle of wonderful French wine. We settled on a Cotes du Rhone, which our delightful server gladly let us taste before we committed.  Both times I've been to the bistro, I've had the Tallgrass beef burger with aged cheddar and fresh fried onion straws. On a toasted brioche bun. My mom and I added on the broccoli rabe with crushed red pepper, and we tried (read: snarfed) the bread pudding for dessert. Everything on the menu sounds incredible, but damn if that burger doesn't taste every cent of deliciousness for $13. I can't stay away. Maybe someday I'll try something else. Or brunch.

2008-12-03,5.0,"This is my favorite French Bistro in Chicago. I've been coming here roughly once a month for the last year now. Located in Lincoln Square, it has to compete with quite a few other restaurants. I think it's one of the best in the area though. I do want to caveat by saying that I'm friends with one of the Sous Chefs; I promise to try and not be biased in my review as I genuinely love this place. The Atmosphere is very warm and intimate. The doorway leads right by the bar and seating is placed throughout several rooms. During the summer an additional outdoor courtyard is open as well; I have yet to sit out here though... my friends love the indoors... and are jerks. The decor is rustic and there is a lot of wood giving it a smaller village feel. Service has always been delightful and I'm always glad when I have Kat. The busboys always appear out of nowhere to keep the water glasses filled and the tables clear. Don't be startled by their stealthy nature. The menu rotates seasonally and keeps a few traditional dishes on hand at all times. I've had a variety of fish, beef cheeks, cassoulet, steak, and rabbit entrees that are all fantastic. Each has been always been cooked perfectly and are very well balanced. The cuisine definitely has a home cooking feel to it that makes you feel warm as opposed to some haughty new wave taste. This place is also vegetarian (not so much vegan) friendly, with a couple options at all times, including a nice macaroni and cheese featuring emmental and gruyere cheese. The steak tartare and escargot are some amazing appetizers; keep the escargot's buttery sauce for dipping your bread once you eat them up. Desserts are always fantastic and compliment the meal rather than try to stand out on their own. The plating of the food is very inviting and tasteful. I'm not much of a wine drinker but has been happy with the few bottles my friends and I have shared.  Even with a lot across the street parking can be slightly difficult at times. This is a problem with the Lincoln Square area in general since it's become so popular in the last decade. You can expect to pay maybe $20-40 a person without alcohol, varying with appetizer and dessert choices. Dress is casual to business casual, they're not pretentious at all.

I should have been clued in right there, for upon my arrival not only was she not alone, it was a full gaggle of old friends, rallied 'round to celebrate my (N+1)-eenth birthday.  I had a modest bit of concern about the menu--French cuisine usually involves techniques that add flour to all sorts of things, and if you have a gluten allergy, you have to be careful--but the waitress responded to my questions about braising and a few of the dishes with alacrity and thoroughness. I wound up getting the eggs with rabbit; I know, this makes me a bunny eater, but they're so tasty, and they make lousy pets. (Last I looked, the website advertises the dish as eggs with duck, so if you arrive having done homework, be on your toes.) Mix in a kir royale, a Bloody Mary with the right amount of horse radish, and the company of good friends, and it was everything I could have wanted. If there's a reason for the four stars instead of five, it's that the menu really is limited for someone with a gluten allergy, but beyond that, between the excellent service, the nice digs, and the nifty execution on the dishes, I really did come away quite pleased to have been ambushed so.",0.9826,0.808,0.149,0.043,0.5397869674185463

It's very cozy and if you are or aren't on a date it doesn't matter it's very laid back, but seems sorta special in a way.  You'll understand if you have visited.

The wine selection is very nice and didn't seem overpriced.  Although I wish, like in Paris, that they would have some cheaper good table wine to order.

The scallops were cooked so perfectly, and they sat atop of swirl of a corn puree, which i could have (and maybe did) lick off the plate. It was a small portion, which was my only complaint, but since I had the salad and we ordered mussels for an appetizer, i was stuffed.

2008-08-10,5.0,"I had heard a variety of things about Bistro C... read a lot. I decided the only way to find out is to just come here, which I did tonight with my friend Julie. The night was absolutely gorgeous. Warm, but the scent of fall filled the air with a cool breeze. When we arrived, (a few minutes late.. but I called to warn them), they knew who we were and asked us outside or in, I deferred it to my dining companion, so we said outside. As we moved our way to the outside, I got to see the old wooden charm, soft lighting, cozy but not cramped seating, people in comfortable, nice casual attire. Most of all, I saw people with smiles on their faces. I took that as a good sign.  We found our way outside to a small two top tucked away in the corner. Not to say we felt shoved to the side, but nestled away for our own little spot. I want to say there was a live band playing soft but lovely music... yet I have no idea where they were. We sat down and do our normal routine... we looked at the wine list. Its just how we roll. Julie was going to go with a sauvigon blanc... I suggested otherwise, ""Let's just start with some champagne."" I chose the middle one, Renardat-Fâche, Bugey Cerdon. When it came out, it was beyond a rose. It was deeper. Shoot... what the hell did I just order? One sip and my fears were erased. Sweet, like a crisp apple, slight hint of cinnamon but really quite refreshing. Our server let us know that it was lower in alcohol content than a normal glass of bubbly, so we could drink away with out the guilt of getting trashed. Umm.. hey that is half the fun too... As we looked over the menu, a small loaf of bread and dip was served, we decided to go sans plates because we were starving, well and no plates came. Then again, we never asked either. The dip was good, the bread was warm, crunchy and comforting. We were told the zucchini blossoms were almost out, so of course we asked for them to hold a dish for us, but hold that as a side. I started with the sweet corn soup, a little pureed, and pieces of crispy, smokey bacon was found through out, Julie, went with the escargot. Never having it, she told me I was having some. *Sigh*... if I must...I must.  The soup was wonderful, the bacon was a tasty treat. Still crunchy and the smokiness helped balance the sweet of the corn beautifully. Then there was the escargot... bubbling in the juices, butter, breadcrumbs and garlic. For once in a long time... I kinda went... what am I thinking!? After it had cooled off and Julie confirmed they weren't as chewy as she has had them, but really good. I decided to grow some culinary balls and have one. It was tasty. It was really good. But when something is drenched in butter, breadcrumbs and a lot of garlic it is hard not to make it tasty. Then our main meals came, I went with the salmon with lentils and Julie went with the white fish, roasted artichokes and potatoes. Simple, classic and well executed, both of them. They had well seared crusts, mine was just buttery and divine. Melt in your mouth divine. The fried zucchini blossoms were a great side dish. At this point we had moved on to a rose for me and a sauvigon blanc for Julie, matching quite well and refreshing in the cooling air. The night air was settling in, so out came the candles and on came the soft dim lights, I can only imagine the mood with an hour more of darkness during the summer months.  At this point... it was dessert time. Julie went with the chocolate souffle as I went with the Pot-de-Crème au Chocolat. Do you like chocolate? Do you like the thought of heaven being chocolate? Because I do and I was eating some heaven right there. Amazing. Our server, Danielle, was also amazing. Friendly, warm, always offering her opinion when asked.. and I suspect she was quite spot on with those opinions. The food was rich and satisfying, the portions were perfect, not too big, but matched the intensity of the richness of the food. The mood was warm, low key and just made us feel welcomed to be there. This is a wonderful evening date place, one to take the parents to or just to enjoy with a good friend, because I had just a wonderful time.",0.9995,0.742,0.218,0.04,0.5636259920634921

We had no particular expectations - but this was just bad food by anyone's standards. I might have considered that they were just having an 'off night' - but when everyone at your table complains about their food, something's terribly wrong. To make matters worse, our server didn't take the uneaten entrees off of our bill - despite our obvious displeasure. It was a very costly lesson that we definitely won't repeat.

Fish (trout) entree: My friend tried this dish and it was pretty good, though not memorable.  Maybe I just don't remember it because it was overshadowed by the scallops dish Mixed vegetables side dish: Pretty random mixed vegetables of pearl onions and other indistinguishable items.  It was overly sweet because of the pearls, but I guess that's a personal preference. Souffle dessert - standard souffle; nothing outstanding Wine: Tried the cabernet blend, which was pretty good.  They didn't have a very wide selection though, and the waitstaff seemed to know very little about the different wines.   Overall verdict: would definitely come again!",0.9955,0.709,0.272,0.019,0.5832625482625483

We were also disappointed that they advertised a ""souffle"" but it wasn't a classical souffle.  Instead, it was a basically a molten lava cake.  We ended up ordering the bread pudding with the carmel glaze.

For appetizers we had the onion tart, the crab cake and the steak tartare.  Of the three I think the crab cake was my favorite.  Not quite as formed or fried as what I was expecting- more of a crab mousse which was great on the crusty bread that was served. For the entrees we split the skate wing, the chicken and the pappardelle and ordered the mac and cheese as a side dish.  I was a bit flummoxed when the mac and cheese came out as it is huge!  Could not figure out who would be able to eat all of that if they ordered it as an entree! In fact- I was expecting small portions given what my experience has been in the past with French food- but there was plenty of food for us to take home for another meal.  I think the chicken was the best- served over mushrooms and a cream sauce then covered in french fried onions.  Very good!  I  didn't like that the skate wing was served with the cartilage attached as it made for some awkward cutting.  I was surprised that they didn't take the cartilage out versus just showing us where it was. The service was one of the reasons I went with three instead of 4 stars.  Our waiter seemed to disappear for long periods of time.  Maybe he was busy but it was a Thursday night not a weekend when I can better excuse poor service.  Finally, we were able to flag down another waiter who got us our drinks, our wine and some bread.   For those of you who drive- there is a very convenient pay lot across the street (cheap too- only $4!) I will have to give this place another try in the summer . I want to sit outside and feel that I am at a little bistro on the Champs Elysees in Paris.  Great food and slow service.  Ahh- that would be just like Paris, now wouldn't it?",0.9962,0.803,0.156,0.042,0.5322222222222223

2007-01-29,5.0,"I like returning to this place because quite frankly they seem to care. Personally I think the whole organic movement is a lifestyle choice. Organic doesn't ALWAYS translate to better. What it does mean however is that whatever farmer they buy their food from ALSO cares about their product.  The overall end result is that when I eat their pork it tastes like a pig is supposed to taste. The meals served here are simple. They are not overly elaborate which works for me.  They have an extensive wine selection but I wouldn't know. :-) I generally drink their beers which are pre-dominantly of the Belgian persuasion. I was saddened to see that they took out Goose Island's Pere Jacques from their beer selection, however Matilda is an able replacement.",-0.1263,0.874,0.073,0.054,0.518452380952381
2007-01-20,5.0,"Possibly my favorite bistro in Chicago, especially in the Spring or Summer when you can have a drink in the restaurant's garden before heading in to eat. The wine list isn't overly extensive, but is very reasonably priced and features a good number of southern French reds, which are what I tend to prefer. As for the food, it was traditional French cuisine prepared perfectly. Yes, there are steak frites, but the chef doesn't stick to an utterly predictable bistro menu that's designed to appeal only to Americans -- my rabbit, for example, was beyond perfect. The service is highly professional without being pretentious or overly formal.",0.9752,0.801,0.199,0.0,0.5842222222222221
2007-01-19,5.0,"I understand that all restaurants have their bad nights, but I am really surprised by all the mediocre and negative reviews on here about Bistro Campagne. Chef Michael Altenberg has made Bistro Campagne one of my favorite spots in the world. For starters it is a BISTRO, not a real french restaurant so don't expect anything crazy. They do love their food, but their should be no pretension from the waitstaff or in the food. They go out of their way to buy fresh, local and organic ingredients which are prepared simply, which is why the prices are a little ($1-$2) higher than comparable Bistros. If you are looking for the meal of the lifetime, this is not the place to go. In addition if you are looking to go out with a large group or entertain this is not an ideal spot, but if all you want is nice bottle of wine and a delicious simple meal to enjoy with someone special it is the perfect place.",0.9869,0.705,0.228,0.067,0.6276643990929704

Reservations are a good idea but sometimes on a Friday night you can get lucky. If not, sit at the bar.....the bartender's a really nice guy and pours excellent drinks.  My only complaint would be that the servers can be a little stuck up.

The first time I went the food was outstanding.  I went over the weekend and found the food to be on the ""just OK"" side. The appetizers we ordered were outstanding, the entrees we ordered were both just ""ok"" ...  The menu is kind of boring without specials, and this past time they had no specials  The wine list is good, but not super extensive.  They only have 2 Champagnes to choose from (and one of those being Yellow label).  I don't know if this relates to their desire to find organic selections or not--though not all of the wines on their list are organic and those that are indicate so. Service was good.   The service is paced, not slow.  Chill out and have a drink, relax, have a conversation. I'd put it somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.. Bistro Campagne is on the cutting edge of the ""organic restaurant"" movement...  He is trying to get his restaurant certified as fully organic and right now it is pretty much as close to it as you can get.    They're the first restaurant in Chicago to attempt this, and one of the first in the country.    I don't know if I care whether a restaurant is organic or not, but I applaud the attempt to do so and it shows that they're using quality ingredients.",0.8621,0.848,0.091,0.061,0.5553350970017638

The owner explained the appetizers to us, and we went with her recommendation and got the crab cake and the escargot.  My roast chicken was an enormous portion of what appeared to be a boned half-bird (with just the drumstick), remarkably tender and rich; I'd guess it was brined before roasting.  The sole was tender and fried crisp, and my friend enjoyed her calves liver (yes, it's a favorite of hers) tremendously.  The service was attentive but not pushy or overbearing and we were very pleased with the wine we chose, too.  It is more expensive than Brasserie Jo, for example, but I'm going to go back in the summer, when the garden is open.",0.9423,0.886,0.105,0.009,0.5924749163879599
