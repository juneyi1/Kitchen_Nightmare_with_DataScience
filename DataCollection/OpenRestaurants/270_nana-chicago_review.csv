Oh wait, they might not do free drinks, but on Thursdays they've got some seriously good cocktails for just $5 each (normally $8-10ish).  I've had the burger, awesome. Had the empanadas, awesome. Had the pan-roasted chicken, awesome. They also do free dessert if it's your birthday. This is a classy place, with a classy menu, for a good price.

2017-08-27,4.0,"My expectations were very high heading into Nana's. We had reservations on a Saturday night. When we got there, there were maybe about 4 tables. The owner or manager got our table ready within a couple of minutes. The vibe of the restaurant is really nice. Candle lit tables surrounded by modern art (that is for sale) add to the environment of the restaurant. We were greeted by a waitress and asked for waters while we glanced at the menu. Water was somewhat cold and no ice in our cups. We ordered the empanadas and the avocado fries for starters. The empanadas had a nice crispy outside filled with a potatoes and ground beef creamy mix. Accompanied by a chimichurri dip which was excellent. Avocado fries were also outstanding and the sauce that was a bed for them was a garlic mayo sauce that was very good. As my entree, I ordered the plantain sandwich. The plantain sandwich was filled with chicken tinga (chipotle peppered chicken mix) with black beans and rice on the side. The filling was extremely tasty but I was let down with the plantain. The plantain was hard and almost over-fried making it very hard to eat. Fortunately my wife had a Cubano and I was able to finish what she couldn't. I wish I had ordered the same as this was an absolute home run! The cubano sandwich comes with ham, shredded pork, melted cheese mustard, pickles and a fresh slaw on the side. Definitely recommend this. I added a green macha tea which was tasty, but was almost lukewarm. I would recommend trying Nanas. The fresh ingredients (other than the over fried plantain) make this experience a one of a kind in Bridgeport.",0.9822,0.846,0.128,0.026,0.6655191570881225

The veggie burger was good too. I loved the chipotle aioli and the patty was really well seasoned.

Right when you walk in you can see an open floor plan with the chef very visible, which was cool because you'd never see anything that chic in this neighborhood.  The hostess promptly greeted us and walked us into the other room where there were 3 tables with 2 people at each.

He had that ""i could care less if you came in"" sort of attitude.  It took forever for someone to finally come over and take our order.  The young lady who waited on my table was super nice but it seemed like she was the only one working.  She was doing everything from making the drinks, to taking orders, etc while the other server spent a lot of time grumpily staring at the kitchen just waiting for his orders to come out. We had the avocado fries and empanadas for an appetizer.  Not bad but not particularly good. Really didn't have much of a flavor.  We also had the cubano sandwich and spicy shrimp gnocchi.  The sandwich was super greasy and also didn't have a lot of flavor. I've had way better at other places throughout the city.  The pasta however was pretty good.  We both wanted another round of drinks but nobody ever asked us.  We tried catching someone's eye but it seems like the wait staff was going out of it's way not to acknowledge us.  We finally asked the manager looking guy if they served desert. He did bring over a menu then nobody came back to the table for at least 15 minutes.  We had enough time to google some of the items (since we weren't familiar) and put the menu off to the side to signal we were ready.  Nothing.  We finally pulled our credit cards out and left them at the edge of the table along with our purses but still had to ask someone for the bill.  The tab between the two of us was $80.  Simply not worth it.  We ended up at Cafe Jumping Bean in Pilsen for desert and coffee.  I know its a totally different place but in hindsight we should of just headed over there for dinner and saved ourselves the aggravation and money.

Anyone who knows pupusas would go crazy seeing this as they are very hard to find in Chicago, as did I. But these were not pupusas. Not even close. I get modern interpretation, fusion etc. No, these were not pupusas by anyone's interpretation. They were sopes at best (flat, un-stuffed, rather tough massa cakes). My waitress agreed.

A friend and I went here after Renegade Holiday Fair at the Bridgeport Arts Center; I had done some research to find a vegetarian friendly place for her and this was the most likely spot nearby.  We were both happy with our meals: stuffed french toast with cream cheese and pear butter for me, eggs benedict with soy chorizo and tater tots for her.  Down side: this place is comprised of two small rooms, and because some people were choosing to be loud (two kids beside us whose mother preferred to look at her phone than tell them to modulate their voices; then in the other corner a political discussion that was getting louder and louder, though gladly someone at that table shushed the major offender) it made for a less than relaxing meal.  Also, our waitress disappeared at the end when we wanted to wrap up the check; the manager finally saw me tapping my foot and took care of it.

I started off having my breath taken away by their cocktail menu. Everything looked so good! I settled on an ""Aztec chocolate"" - a hot chocolate cocktail with Mezcal and cayenne. I was in heaven.  We also got the empanadas to start. They were pretty good, although I put too much chimichurri on mine and drowned out the other flavors. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly serviceable.  I had the Cubano sandwich for a main. Damn it was good. I don't even like pork that much and it was so damn good. The bread was soft and clearly fresh, the flavors were awesome, the meats were fresh cooked... It was great. Finally, a friend of mine inquired whether they offered dessert. They don't even have a printed dessert menu, but they had a couple flavors of cake. She went for the pistachio rum cake. It came out looking pretty plain, sort of like something at a nice home cooked family brunch. It was FANTASTIC. Incredibly moist and flavorful. We were all stunned.

They're deep fried deliciousness that's a perfect precursor regardless of the time of day.   Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the bloody Mary, but I know as well as anyone that this drink is totally subjective.

The nanadicts were bland, even though it was loaded with chorizo. I would have liked the chorizo to be spicy to make this dish work.

We are all disappointed but stay, then my mom asks for the manager, she sends a man out and she asks if she can make a few suggestions. The menu we received has breakfast as the focal point, she says it would be nice to not see the breakfast items, or print something that reads breakfast stops at 2:30. He says ok ""I'll take that back as a suggestion"",  and continues to say the bus boy sat you and we are very sorry that no one told you and this has never happened before. So we kept ordering and the food was fine, it was just not what we wanted. The bill comes and nothing was removed or comped, in my opinion customer service etiquette would have been to comp an appetizer or something. It felt really rude the way we were treated as paying customers. Oh and the waitress comes back out and says I thought the manager was here but I found the owner.

Despite the crowds, it is worth the wait. I usually arrive on a weekend brunch within an hour of it opening, and have never waited more than 10 minutes for a table. By the time we leave around 13:00, there's a line out the door. Some of the best plates here include the Avocado Fries. These are a staple, and a must have! The little bit of arugula and spicy sriracha they include turns this into a mouthwatering appetizer. I also highly recommend the Huevos Rancheros here too. They are a delight, and accompanied with the toast, make a perfect brunch. Feeling thirsty? Definitely try one of their different tea lattes.

We selected the calamari, avocado fries, the meatballs and the empanadas as our appetizers (don't judge, we were hungry. Long day. lol ).  All were a hit except for the meatballs. It was something about the taste. But hey, try them if you'd like. However, my fav. Appetizers were the empanadas and the calamari. That calamari was heaven sent, I have never tasted a hint of sweetness in my calamari batter before! (It is worth the try!). I also opted for the Cuban sandwich. It has a fancy name but I can't remember it. It was delightful. I was even limiting my carbs and they were gracious enough to bring me romaine lettuce instead of the bread.

I've been here for brunch several times and fawned over the creative Benedict that day. I've eaten deep-fried avocado slices here to find that they are incredibly fresh yet crispy, a true riddle of the kitchen. The salads are perfect and tangy. The Mexican-inspired dishes are some of the best versions of them I've had. The chef is great about sourcing organic and beautifully grown produce, which you can taste. The food here is SO thoughtful, but you don't have to read Bon Appetit to know that. You only have to eat it. We came for the Sunday supper a few weeks ago on a Travelzoo voucher and were further blown away. We didn't think this restaurant could get any better, and then it did. At Sunday supper, the fried chicken is epic; the jalapeño cornbread puts the one at my favorite BBQ place to shame; the slaw, which could could have been an afterthought, was perfectly balanced between tang and sweet and salty and crunchy; the mac and cheese was memorable where most are not; the dessert donut was light and fluffy and not too sweet. I didn't write any of these dishes down. I just remember them because they were THAT GOOD. And my old brain isn't that great at remembering what I even did yesterday. I also want to thank the staff for being incredibly accommodating of us. You know, us: people with an infant.

The nanadict was also good but I wish it had a creamier sauce more reminiscent of hollandaise and the arugula made for an odd pairing.

When I arrived with my mother last weekend, I thought our brunch experience was going to be the worst.  Let me explain. My mom and I arrived around 3/4pm. We were seated on the other side and it was completely empty. At this time, they were no longer serving breakfast and only had appetizers and lunch. We quickly decided what we were going to order and were just waiting for the waitress. After 10 minutes, she still hadn't stopped by, not even to take our drink order. They weren't busy so I didn't understand why she was taking so long. Well, another 15 minutes passed and I began to think they had forgotten us. I really wanted my mom to enjoy herself, so at that point I just stood up and walked over to the front to let the waitress know we were ready to order. I was very upset. Turns out, there was a miscommunication between the manager (or owner, I am unsure) and the waitress. I guess he had told her that he had seated us but wasn't very specific as to whom he was talking about, I don't know.  HOWEVER, the reason I am giving Nana's five stars is because despite the amount of time we initially waited to order, both the manager (or owner, again, I am unsure) and the waitress gave my mother and I a sincere apology and complimentary dessert. I truly appreciate it when businesses try their best to ensure you are satisfied. Not only that, but the food is AMAZING. We ordered the avocado fries (they were the bomb), the potato soup (tasted so creamy and heavenly), el cubano (uhm, yum!), and the shrimp and oyster po'boy (so fresh and delicious). For dessert, we had the crème brûlée and it was honestly the best thing ever.

Well, apparently The hostess had placed the ""specials"" menu from a previous day/week at our table by accident.  The waitress never acknowledged this.

2016-01-03,3.0,"We woke up this morning and wanted brunch (no surprises there!). We tried to make a reservation for an hour later (12 PM), but according to the online reservation system, they were booked until 3 PM. Because Nana is in Bridgeport, we figured there was no way it could be totally booked, so we chanced it and decided to show up and see what we could find. Parking was free on Sunday, which was a major plus.  Upon walking in, we noted that it was both charming and a bit cramped. The hostess was really busy talking on the phone, walking to and from the hostess desk, all while sipping Starbucks coffee. Even though there were people waiting in front of us and people who arrived after us, we were all able to be seated immediately. This surprised me because of the lack of online reservations. I guess they count on plenty of people showing up without a reservation.  We were brought water right away, but it wasn't for several minutes until our waitress appeared. She was very friendly, and explained the restaurant's philosophy to us because this was our first visit. We were going to order empanadas, but she informed us they were sold out. So we started right with entrees. I got the coconut cheese french toast with mango syrup. It was good, but not as sweet as I imagined it would be. It was supposed to have coconut cheesecake filling, but none was visible when I opened up the two pieces of bread, which were put together like a sandwich. What I had was tasty (I LOVED the toasted coconut), but it didn't live up to what it sounded like it should have been. My boyfriend was still hungry after finishing his huevos rancheros. The portion was similar to tapas, not to a fullblown $13 entree.  A complaint I have is how small and cramped everything is. At the hostess stand, there's no space whatsoever to wait before being seated. It ended up being fine because we didn't have to wait. But I could see this place getting backed up with people with nowhere to stand. Also, the bathroom is very, very small. I had to time myself perfectly getting up from the table to walk over because there were so many people (mostly staff, but also some other customers) walking around.  Even though I did have some complaints, there's no denying the food is very good. Despite my three star rating, I do still recommend it, and we may still return.

Unfortunately it was kind of a let down. The menu describes it as having chorizo and pupuda (corn based bread) instead the traditional English muffin. Anytime chorizo is involved, I expect a lot of flavor, and I thought the pupusa would only add to the flavor aspect and give the dish a different texture component as well. To my dismay, the chorizo was actually kind of bland! And the pupusa was WAAAAY too dense for me. It was hard to cut, hard to eat, and filled me up way too quickly. Side note, I've never had pupusa before so maybe it's supposed to be served that way..? In that case, I guess I'm just not a huge fan of pupusa then.

In my most recent visit, we ordered: Avocado Fries- I was really looking forward to ordering these because of the uniqueness of it but it was nothing too exciting about it. Avocados are already buttery and bland...and then fried. Nothing too great.  Empanadas- This was actually good. I guess you have to ask your server for the empanada of the day. It was beef that day. It was very tasty and for $8.00, you get 4 huge ones.  Nanadict- Presentation looked great but I felt the chorizo lacked flavor. Huevos Rancheros-I ordered mine with chorizo and it lacked flavor.

Coming on the weekends maybe a bit challenging seating-wise.  They are usually crowded after 11:00 am but do not let that dissuade you though. Grab a beverage from the bar and wait outside of the weather is good.  It's well worth the wait. 1 to 2 people? By-pass the crowd and dine at the bar... Fast drinks and fast service. Staff has always been very friendly Everytime I've come here. Though they may not take reservations on the weekend, We usually get a table within 5 to 30 minutes.  I've hosted a birthday celebration for 18 people one the weekend and we were all seated, served and well taken care of in record time.

2015-05-12,2.0,This restaurant is very hipster it has nice paintings on the walls that are for sale.  There is no parking lot so good luck finding one in this area.  I think the restaurant is over rated.  The food has no flavor.  So for those that cook at home you will find the food is horrible.  The only thing I loved was the coffee.  My mother order chilaquiles with eggs and beans she sent it back. They had no flavor.  Plus the plating looked like some one had vomited I. The plate.  I had the salad the vinaigrette was too acidic.  The prices are way too expensive for this reason I was too generous giving Nanas 2 stars.  No definite a a thumbs down,0.9139,0.739,0.172,0.088,0.6188888888888889

I had no idea what I was in for...super quaint, cute look and feel inside. We were greeted and seated right away at a table by a window. Score! It took quite some time for our server to come by, but since we were in no hurry, it wasn't a problem at all.  In glancing at the menu, we couldn't decide on what we wanted, there were so many awesome choices, so we chose to get a bunch of stuff and split it all. Talk about ridiculously delicious and flavorful food....and organic too?!?! You cannot beat it! We got the avocado fries, which were spectacular. The avocado was creamy, fresh and super flavorful, and that aioli sauce (or whatever it was) was so delicious! We also got the meatballs which were seriously delectable as well. I ate the avocado with the meatballs, mixed together. Flavor explosion is all I have to say! We ordered the veggie omelet and the market veggies included were broccoli, zucchini, some sort of leek-like veggie and sweet potato I think. The veggies were seasoned so perfectly and cooked to the perfect tenderness. They sat inside the omelette vs being cooked with the eggs. I couldn't believe how much flavor was in that dish. Even the side potatoes and and homemade ketchup were a hit!  We also split a side of mac and cheese...if you know me, you know that I can go hard on some mac and cheese...I'm rather a snob of sorts when it comes to the stuff. Well, Nana didn't not disappoint with their tasty, cheesy version. It was fantastic....really really good. To top it all off, my friend had the best bloody mary she's ever tasted....Nana makes their on bloody mary juice of course. Even the garnish was elaborate, including large hunks of pickle, cheese and some thing we thought was an olive, but it wasn't. Spectacular! I had a glass of cava with elderflower....so, an elderflower mimosa basically. It was divine!!!  I will definitely by back with the hubs...and soon!",0.9975,0.726,0.217,0.057,0.6961822660098519

Here is the breakdown: Avocado fries-These are really rich since avocados are rich, the fried breading is rich, and the accompanying sauce is rich. I liked it, but could only eat one, which was fine because the whole table shared and 5 avocado spears came in an order. It's a true appetizer. Donuts with coconut and pineapple-one for each of us, 4. It was perfect. Soft, not coyingly sweet but very balanced in its flavors.  Huevos rancheros: Eggs were cooked exactly to my liking. The one thing I didn't like about this was that there were juices from the chorizo and sauteed veggies were spread across the whole plate by the tortilla. However, this is not Nana's fault. Foods just have juices. That's what makes them taste good. The tortilla's crisp held up well in the tasty juices, which pleasantly surprised me. All of the flavors in my mouth was yum. I had my heart set on the shrimp and oyster po' boy, but they did not have it this day, so I'll have to go back. Service was good. No complaints at all. The waitress was pleasant.

When we walked in and got on the list we were told the wait would be a half hour. No problem.  Here's where it gets fun. A group that came in right before us told the host they had a party of 4, but when he went to seat them someone must have spilled water on them because they had grown to 6. Instead of doing the right thing and making them wait for being clowns,the host lets the wheels come off. Then another group did the same thing. Not NaNas fault,but keep your cool man.  50 minutes goes by and we get a table. Menus are looked at and after a ten minute wait the waitress finally comes over and tells us she'll be right with us.  We order and all is well,right? Wrong. When the table next to us gets their order before us when they ordered 15 minutes after we did,I get worried. Another 10 minutes go by then the waitress is nice enough to come by and tell us our food will be right out,she forgot to put our order in.  WHAT WHAT WHAT?!? All you have to do is take my order and give it to the kitchen! You don't have to cook it or even bring it to the table because OTHER PEOPLE DO THAT!!!

I had to try this because it seemed like EVERYONE on yelp was raving about these avocado fries... (and I LOVE AVOCADOS)  But I didn't enjoy them all that much. The sauce was tasty overall.... but too salty... I wanted more sauce for flavor but it came with a good kick of salt in my mouth.  Nanadict Whenever I get breakfast/brunch, I have to order a benedict. It's my breakfast staple. BUT......I didn't enjoy the pupusas they use in place for a english muffin. =(  The pupusas were a little dense and overpowered the flavor of the nandict. I also felt like something was missing from the dish and reached for the chorizo sauce to try to fill the void. But their poached egg on top of the nandict was cooked perfectly. The home fries weren't that great either.  Huevos Rancheros with chorizo This is probably my favorite dish so far. I think next time I will ask to order this with pulled pork.  Luckily,  I didn't have a long wait and the service wasn't terrible. The ingredients are fresh. BUT...

I ordered the nanadict with soyrizo & I enjoyed it. the flavors went well together, especially with the runny, poached eggs on top & (seems like) homemade ketchup for my home fries. the farm greens had a complimenting citrus vinaigrette, that I really enjoyed. i did think the pupusas were a little too dense for my liking & took over much of the nanadict flavor though. otherwise, I would order this again.  my boyfriend had the grilled shrimp & fried oyster po'boy & he seemed to enjoy it. I took a bite from it & it had good flavor & heat to it. I can't really comment on the sandwich overall since I only had a bite, but I'm trying this next time.  my cousin who joined us had the el cubano with a fried egg on top. although I didn't try his, he also seemed to enjoy it & said he gives it an 8/10. the fried egg on top was an additional $2 though. kind of crazy, but it is organic.  overall, yes I would come again. it seems like the menu rotates a few items in & out so there's always something new!",0.9951,0.8,0.189,0.011,0.4596704370897919

First situation happened a few months ago where we caught our waitress on the wrong day.  She was so rude, nasty, and condescending that I wanted to walk out then and there, and several times throughout the meal.  It started when we first ordered and I asked to get peppers added to my breakfast sandwich.  She said that it was not possible, that they do not have any peppers and that she had never heard of such a request.  What is interesting to note here is that this is my regular meal (meaning every weekend), I get it every time I come, AND it also came recommended one day from NANA herself (yes, Nana as in the name of the restaurant).   Second situation was today...and while not terrible bad, I was a little embarrassed because I brought a friend from out of town.  The restaurant was empty for Sunday brunch standards yet the service was exceptionally slow.  I was able to get past all of this, but what I found completely inappropriate and disgusting was our waitress commenting under her breath about a screaming baby several tables over by saying, ""I wish that kid would shutup.""

2014-12-28,4.0,"I seldom eat brunch but Nana is so good and the atmosphere there is so chic and inviting that I could work it into my weekly schedule. Bridgeport is an area of the city I was unfamiliar with prior to going to Nana but I recommend it to North-siders leery of traveling south of Roosevelt. Nana is just one of many small businesses in the area that will surprise you. Thankfully, Nana takes reservations for brunch, which always gives a restaurant a boost in my opinion. My friends and I--one of whom had an infant--were seated immediately. When we got to our table a high chair and a sippy cup had been placed there so we didn't have to request them. The brunch menu has a Tex-Mex flair: huevos rancheros and breakfast burritos are, perhaps, the biggest draw. I had the breakfast burrito. It was tasty, prepared with chorizo and potatoes, but it wasn't heavy. My friends and I also tried the fried avocado--highly recommended--and the short rib chili which looked so good I wished I had ordered a large bowl of it for myself. Brunch is not complete without a cocktail. Both the bloody Mary and the mimosa passed muster, especially the bloody Mary, which was smoky and piquant. I was quite impressed with the service at Nana. Our server was an amiable young man who knew the menu and took time to inquire about our tastes and preferences. He checked in with us and even let us try a sample of the bloody Mary before we decided to order it. The space itself is pleasant. Cream colored exposed brick and polished blond wood tables make the restaurant bright and chic. Nana appeals to a culturally diverse group of diners. While Nana doesn't really qualify as a family restaurant, the fact that the restaurant could accommodate our friend's one-year-old indicates that kids are, indeed, welcome there. Overall, diners were sophisticated and relaxed. Anyone looking to get loud and rowdy should try another venue. I will certainly return to Nana for brunch, and I would like to try dinner here at some point. This restaurant is a good find in an unassuming neighborhood and I encourage potential customers to go there soon before it becomes too popular.",0.9978,0.76,0.21,0.03,0.6145238095238096

A friend and I started with the avocado fries (w/ chipotle lime aioli) and the pulled pork durritos. The avocado fries were ridiculously good--worth the $8. I could eat that chipotle lime aioli every day of my life and I would die happy. The pulled pork durritos were generous, served atop a puffy, bland rice(?) cake that served as a functional vehicle to shovel the sizable portion of spicy-sweet slaw, unspiced pork, and a second kind of aioli into our mouths.  I ended up getting the chickpea gnocchi in mole sauce, which was terrible. I'm a fan of gnocchi usually, but these were dry, brittle, and inedible. I tried a few times to smother it in the rich mole sauce in order to give it a little moisture but no such luck.  Given that the appetizers were so good, I marked it up as a fluke. As I was leaving the restaurant, I heard another table debating about getting the chickpea gnocchi... I wanted more than anything to warn them--follow the waitress's advice, she's recommending the prime rib! My friend got a pineapple-beet salad with lime vinaigrette for dinner (a really good and unexpected combination, especially with the fried goat cheese, which never hurts).

Came in with a friend for brunch on (you guessed it) Labor Day, and really liked this spot - atmosphere and ambiance were nice, decor was cute. We had the avocado ""fries"" to start and then each ordered a citrus cheesecake stuffed French toast. I was incredibly excited about the avocado fries since I'm obsessed with avocado - and most things only get better when deep fried (is the Southern in me showing yet?) They were pretty good - sliiightly bland, which I'm guessing is because they were a little too thickly cut. Avocado itself doesn't have a very strong flavor, so it needs some help with seasoning, but the fatter the slice, the lower the surface area to volume ratio and geometry and math etc. etc. So there wasn't really enough room for the crispy coating to give the fries more flavor. The French toast was somewhere between ""okay"" and ""good"". I enjoyed it, but didn't think it was anything to write home about. They give you a huge portion (I only finished half of mine and took the rest home), which is nice. I didn't really care for the candied orange bits, but the whipped cream and fresh fruit that came with it were good. It wasn't bad, but I think I've had better French toast at other places. Overall, not a bad place, but I'm not rushing to recommend it to friends or come back for another round.",0.9899,0.757,0.193,0.05,0.548
2014-09-21,4.0,"Delicious and unique first meal on a recent Chicago trip! Came here on a Saturday for a really late brunch and just had to wait a minute or two. While we were poring over the menus, our waitress asked if we were already told that breakfast is closed, which we were not, and we were actually all making up our minds on breakfast options. Then she came back and they were nice enough to let us still order from the breakfast menu. I see now that their breakfast is until 2:30 pm, think we may have arrived a bit after that. Love that they use local organic and fresh ingredients. We shared the avocado fries, and it was my first time having this appetizer. I love avocado, but unsurprisingly I liked them in a fried version too. For my entree, I got the nanadict, and it is one of the most interesting benedicts I've ever had. Brunch with a Latin American twist! Still tasted like a traditional benedict with the poached egg, but with a big kick of spice and flavor. I also tried my cousin's citrus cheesecake stuffed french toast. I love cheesecake and I like french toast, it was right amount of sweet for me, but I could never order that just for myself. There were occasional water (at least I hope) drops coming down on me from the ceiling.... I shifted my seat to the right and drops started coming down from there.

I enjoyed the large glass water bottles they put on every table and replaced very regularly. Unfortunately, once we ordered the wait times increased drastically. We ordered their avocado fries (fantastic), a garden omelette, cream of tomato soup and their famous grilled shrimp and fried oyster po boy. All dishes far exceeded my expectations. They all had so much flavor without relying heavily on sauces. I could have eaten bowls upon bowls of the tomato soup. It was kind if difficult to flag down our server after we were done, so I had to get the attention of a busses for our check and then waited quite awhile for it to be returned to us.

The Shrimp/Oyster Boy was AWESOME!!!  Refreshing, crunchy, and fresh.  My only complaint is that it could have used 1-2 more pieces of fried oyster and that the shrimp were tiny, but don't be mistaken.  This is the best PO BOY I ever had.  Everything complements each other very well in the sandwich.  I'd be shocked if you had anything leftover on your plate.

I'd like to say I'm always impressed with the changing menu! You definitely don't see a lot of that around this neighborhood so it is very refreshing that they offer seasonal dishes. We were seated immediately and had the most delightful server, Lance.  He was extremely courteous and asked us first what we would like to drink. He came back and kindly asked if we had any questions about the menu items. Well boyfriend and I knew exactly what we wanted already! I had the Pan Roasted Salmon and boyfriend had Churrasco. Our food came very fast and it was delicious to say the least. Lance came to check on us many times and was extremely attentive. We were also checked on by what I believe was either a manager or the chef. Delightful people!  We finished up and had to order our favorite chocolate milk that is dessert-like in flavor. Best chocolate milk ever..just try it. I must say I have never been disappointed in the food, wait times, or service in my many visits here. The food was cooked exactly as I wanted it and was fresh and had great flavor. Honestly the service was absolutely amazing, as well the food.

However, the entrees disappointed.  We got the ancho chile braised short rib which is on the regular menu and some kind of pork dish also with a chile rub.  Unfortunately, you would barely notice the presence of chiles in either dish.  Both were executed well, but unexceptional in both flavor and ingenuity.

2014-04-27,3.0,"My friend and I wanted to come here for a while now. We finally decided to make a dinner reservation and came here this past Friday. We got there at 4:25PM, and it was nearly empty and were seated right away, even though our reservation was for 4:45PM.   Service:  Despite being seated before our reserved time and the restaurant being nearly empty, we waited about half an hour before we could even place our order. Apparently the waitress that seated us could not take our order because she was not the dinner waitress. When the waitress for the dinner service showed up, we were also told that it would take a bit before we could place our order. I thought it was odd that they allowed reservations for dinner service at 4:45PM, but we were not able to place our order until 5:00PM.. I would have much preferred being told that dinner service does not start until a certain time, so that we did not have to be seated and wait for half an hour before ordering.. but that is just my opinion. I did find myself having to repeat myself more than several times to the original waitress and to one of the waiters. Other than that, the rest of the service was alright.  Aesthetics: The place itself looks pretty nice. Good ambience, and beautiful artwork hanging on the walls.  Food: We ordered the following: Avocado Fries, the El Cubano, the Shrimp & Oyster Po' boy, a side of homefries, and a side of mac n' cheese.  Quality - The ingredients used were really fresh. The serving sizes are pretty big (to me).  Taste - I was pretty excited to come here because of the high reviews. To be honest, I thought it was mediocre. I looked forward to the avocado fries, but they were not anything spectacular. The Cubano was okay. However, I could get the same, if not better, sandwich at Cafecito for one-third of the price. The homefries were just salted, which was okay. I did not try any of the po'boy so I cannot say anything about that. Price - For the quality and price, I still think it is a bit overpriced.  Overall, I was a bit disappointed after looking forward to coming here. It will most likely be a one-time experience for me.",0.9863,0.835,0.119,0.046,0.5527756892230575

The person I was with convinced me to try the avocado fries because like 70% of the reviews on yelp recommended them and somebody even claimed they were life-changing. While the sauce was good, the avocado fries were definitely not as tasty as I expected, and given that you only get 5, I'm not sure they are worth $8. The garden omelette was probably the best thing I tried, but how hard is it to make an omelette? I was really hoping for the nanadict (their Latin take on eggs Benedict) to be tasty because I love poached eggs, but it really lacked a lot of flavor I found in eggs Benedict at places like Bongo Room and Yolk.

In addition to the cider, apples were included, which would have been fine without the additional cider! The meal resulted in an acidic, apple-y taste that overpowered the brussel sprouts. And the butternut squash inside the pasta was bland, which added to the overcooked raviolis. Overall, I was not impressed with my meal.

2014-03-20,1.0,"One and DONE with this place. Only reason why is because of the wait staff. My boyfriend and I had come here because he was raving about their brunch and told me about their family style dinner on Sundays so I was all in. Granted we went on a weekend and it was busy so I understood. But the hostess looked like she wanted to avoid interacting with us. Brushed that off whatever. When we finally sit down, we get a waitress who took forever to take our order and longer to refill beverages. Fine i get it, your busy. I honestly didn't mind at that point because I was taking a while to decide what I wanted 'cause everything sounded soo good! Next is why I refuse to go back. After I placed my order my boyfriend places an order for a skillet. He asked his eggs, which usually with a skillet is placed on top of the hash, to be cooked over medium, the girl proceeds to say, and I repeat VERBATIM, ""over medium? Well you know with a skillet the eggs are mixed in with everything together. Have you even ever had a skillet before?"" RUDE! How could you say something like that to a customer?

Nana is elegant without being pretentious -- I would be equally comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt or if we wanted to make it a special night all dressed up. The food! Flavor combinations are wonderful, and the ingredients are so fresh the flavors pop. Presentation is appealing without being precious. We were only in Chicago for 2 days -- and we went both days! The first was so good we had to come back. The first meal we were there our schedule was weird so we had to eat dinner at around 3:30pm, which meant we had to eat off their lunch menu. My husband and I did a kind of tapas thing, and ordered all four starters--empanadas, chickpea frites, avocado fries and my absolute favorite dish, their tostones. We also ordered two vegetable sides to share, including the spaghetti squash in roasted red pepper sauce, the field spinach and the vegetable of the day which was roasted asparagus. Everything was delicious, perfectly cooked. The asparagus wasn't too soggy (as it so often is in restaurants), the spaghetti squash was still a little al dente. But the tostones! A dish of 5 rounds of fried plantain with little mounds of pulled pork and coleslaw on each. The pulled pork is seasoned really well, with a hint of sweet that plays perfectly off the vinegar in the coleslaw. The second night my husband had the braised shortribs with brie and bacon mashed potatoes and I had one of the specials, the braised goat with french green beans and parmesan gnocchi. The jus for the goat dish was so flavorful I almost asked for a piece of bread to sop it up once the dish was done.  But we were saving room for dessert. The restaurant gets its name from the owner's mother, who is a pastry chef. She makes all the desserts. Do NOT miss the pistachio rum cake or the tres leches cake. Just don't. Finally, I am a real fan of good service and I really notice when it stinks. The service in Nana was the best I've ever experienced. The staff all seem to enjoy working there, none of them acted put out by any request. The acid test for me of good service--i.e. how long a dirty and empty plate stays on your table--was passed with flying colors. No dirty plate stayed on the table for more than a minute, because *every* server who walked by would pick it up if they had a free hand. Both nights our servers obviously loved talking about the menu, and loved working there. That matters a lot, and it shows.  The food is the star, but the atmosphere and service are no slouch.

The Blue Scotch Kale Salad was great too.  The kale was finely chopped and coated with a light citrus vinaigrette.  The salad was filled with goodies: avocado, roasted red peppers tomatoes, pickled red onions, and cojita cheese (I ordered it without the cheese). Main Course: I ordered the Pepita Crusted Trout.  It was pretty good.  The trout was served on top of a tomatillo sabayon with mushrooms, leeks, and roasted peppers.  A really good light entree, if that's what you want. The Ancho Chile Braise Short Ribs were fantastic.  The short ribs were marinated in some magic combination of marinades and was super tasty.  It came with bacon and brie mashed potatoes, leeks, and sun dried tomatoes.

While we are familiar with Nana's seating policy (they will not seat you until your entire party is there), we did not think another person joining us would be an issue since we were already drinking our coffee and the extra chair did not take up much space or seem to bother anyone (or so we thought). Omar then came up to our table, SCOLDED US VERY LOUDLY, reminding us of the restaurant seating policy in front of half the restaurant. Like I said, we did not think this extra person joining us would be an issue but apparently Omar likes to yell. We really should just have gotten up and left.

First of all, there's an entire menu of breakfast cocktails. Hello. The Double Dirty Chai (chai, coffee liqueur, house made Irish cream, espresso, steamed milk) was fantastic. The espresso balanced out the sweetness. My favorite, though, was the Cranberry Toddy (Old Overholt whiskey, honey, lemon, cranberry preserves, allspice). I'm suffering from a serious cold, and I think if I got a few of those in me, I'd probably be cured.  We started with the Crispy Chickpea Frites with garlic aioli, harissa honey, and date agrodolce. They were tasty, but I wanted to like then more than I did. They weren't particular crispy, and the agrodolce seemed like too strong of a flavor.  Huevos Rancheros were super delicious. I had them with the eggs over easy and figured I should go for it, and got the chorizo. So flavorful....so, so delicious. The Nanadict (beautifully poached eggs, chorizo) was really nice also, but the Huevos Rancheros are definitely where it's at. The Seasonal Stuffed French Toast (chocolate chips and banana) was impressive. Tasted like it had mascarpone or something in it, as well--tangy to balance out the sweet. Cinnamon Apple Pancakes with creme anglaise were solid, but nothing to write home about.

My husband and I were seated right away; first taken midway through the main dining room, only to turn around to go be seated by the kitchen since there was not an empty table. Started off with coffees which were not freshened up for the next 15 minutes after we had to ask. When you pay $3 for a cup of coffee, you should not have to chase down the server! It was suggested that we start off with the avocado fries. They were fresh, lightly battered, and served with a chipolte aioli sauce. They were tasty, end of story. We ordered our main course, a breakfast burrito for one and the huevos rancheros for the other. Oh and a $5 tall fresh OJ.  Tick tock... tick tock. Let's just say we were there for 71 minutes and we are not slow eaters. The waitress openly admitted that she forgot to put our order in but by then I wondered what took so long for her to realize this. Meanwhile still a major lack of coffee and water refills. $49 dollars later, a few apologies, and almost a parking ticket for having gone over our hour time stamp, we won't be running back. The food was good but lacked the extra special Mexican flavor, or any flavor that would have kicked the dishes up a notch. Might I add that since we sat right next to the kitchen we saw how long the food sat before table delivery. That alone is a crime!

Being a pescatarian, I make an effort to try every spot that has popular veggie options (fish can be very pricey so I don't eat it as often when I dine out and I'm paying :P). Being in the south loop that day, I decided to take my vegetarian sister out for Mother's Day brunch at popular Nana's.  We got here only about an hour after they opened and it was already incredibly packed. I know, it's popular spot and in a cool 'hood on a very busy brunch day but they didn't want to take resos when I called earlier in the week which frustrated me a bit.  We walked in to put our names down and just doing that was an arduous task since they were using an IPad to keep track of the waiting list and the person operating it seemed like it was their first time using the device. It was kinda cold out so we crammed in like sardines for 45 min instead of the 30 we were initially quoted.  Once seated in their light wood chairs and tables, I ordered an americano, tofu scramble and my sis had the nanadict with soy chorizo instead. The server was really nice but was swamped with so many other people, it was hard for him to attend to us often.  Upon tasting my dish, I felt that the tofu scramble had 0 seasoning and I was dousing it with salt and pepper. Maybe I should've ordered a different item. Maybe my Latina taste buds are used to heavy garlic and seasonings at every meal. Idk. I was just disappointed with taking the trip over there, waiting an eternity when the establishment refused to have resos on such a big brunch day to have a breakfast i personally feel I could've made better.

The interior of Nana is beautiful and artsy and the staff is friendly. I knew exactly what I wanted to order as soon as I got there: the chilaquiles. I have been on a mission for about the past 10 years looking for the perfect chilaquiles in the city and I think I may have finally found them. They were cheesy, covered in green sauce and perfect. Accompanied by some grits and a Michelada, I was in heaven at Nana. The fiance got the huevos rancheros and could not stop raving about them. We both left incredibly full and happy.

I had the poblano bloody mary which had a nice kick to it. An interesting twist on the standard favorite. We ordered 3 plates to share; the crispy chickpea frites, baked mac n' cheese, and arugula salad with quinoa. I'm still wondering how the chickpea frites were made. Perfect crispy fries with a soft center, served with garlic aioli, spicy honey, and a sweet date compote. The mac was creamy and delicious with a little crunch from the biscuit crumbles on top. The arugula salad was good on its own, but what made it memorable were the quinoa fritters that accompanied it. I never thought quinoa could taste that good. Simply put, every dish we ordered was outstanding. I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu!",0.984,0.766,0.208,0.026,0.6535714285714286
2013-07-22,1.0,"The name should be NADA instead!  We were quite excited to check out Nana because it's supposedly an organic cafe. Unfortunately no matter if the ingredients are organic or not, some flavor profile must be created and proper execution of cooking techniques must be executed for a meal to be enjoyable.  The atmosphere is quite clean and comfortable but the food was not worth a dime. We ordered the bacon ""beignets"" to start and were very thankful we stuck with a small order. They were more like heavy cake doughnuts with very little bacon and flavor. A beignets should be able to be cut with a fork... there was NO WAY you could do that with these suckers. We also order Bloody Mary's. Which were so spicy that they were hardly enjoyable. And let me tell you... I LOVE MY SPICE! I could practically live off of hot sauce. My date gave up on drinking his.  For our meal, I ordered the Garden Omelet and my date ordered the Biscuits & Pork Gravy. Both were frustratingly disappointing. My omelet had no seasoning or flavor at all. The egg looked like it was a precooked patty. All they had to do was throw the bland veggies on one side and fold it over. Nothing was cooked together to make the omelet stay together. If your going to do this... you at least need to add a cheese to make everything stay in place. Nope... nothing. The salad was the only positive with vibrant acidity.  My dates Biscuits and Gravy was worse. He couldn't cut, let alone did he want to eat, the bottom of his biscuits because they were so burnt. The gravy was bland and he thanked god he got his eggs over easy... allowing the runny yolks to provide some flavoring. I mean how do you mess up a biscuit??? Isn't that Baking 101?  All in all...

Personally, I loved the nanadict and the cauliflower salad. The tofu scramble didn't have much taste to it, and I don't think it was because it was tofu---I am actually a fan of tofu and have had some really great tofu dishes at other restaurants. The nanadict is definitely a must try- it's a unique twist on eggs benedict and the poblano cream sauce is so much lighter, but just as good, as the traditional beshamel sauce. The cauliflower salad is delicious and satisfying even though they give you a pretty small portion.

Customer service.  Others on Yelp have mentioned the prices, but if you want to check them before you go, you'll notice that Nana does NOT post prices on its on-line menu.  They are a mystery that apparently must be unlocked by an actual visit.   This, IMO, exhibits a certain disregard to customers, who might be operating within a certain budget and cannot make a decision on the place w/out the trouble of actually going there and perhaps finding it a bit out of reach, then having to locate an alternative.   I for one don't have the time or inclination to do this, so that's lost business for Nana, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.  Bad business practice, Nana.",-0.6973,0.817,0.085,0.097,0.4498556998556999

It pairs up most of my favorite breakfast items (eggs, potatoes, chorizo) and smothers it with a poblano cream sauce on top of some pupusas which happen to add some great texture and flavor to the meal.  To top it off, the fresh greens and dressing seem to perfectly complement the meal and give it a dash of acidity that is a welcome addition to the plate. In short: good stuff.  The biscuits and ducky gravy ain't half bad either.

2013-07-10,3.0,"I frequent this establishment a few times each month. I do so because it is close to my home office.  You should know where this review is going since I prefaced with stating that my patronage has more to do with proximity than with the food. I do respect that they use fresh ingredients. The portions are always healthy Southside portions that can feed two people.  However:  1. one of the servers that has been there for awhile doesn't seem to know exactly what they are doing. I am not going to point them out, but they have been there for at at least a few visits already. 2. The dishes, while novel and complex, always seem to either be missing a dimension or just not quite right. For example: special soup today was Creamed Spinach; it tasted like and had the consistency of baby food. Example two: the raw cauliflower salad, missing acid notes, has sliced green olives that are too salty, whereas the homemade olive tapenade that it is plated on top of is missing salt. I admit, I'm picky as Hell when it comes to restaurants that are playing in arena that Nana's is touting itself as being in. So I am very harsh.  Nana's has virtually no competition in the Bridgeport area, especially as a brunch spot. The nearest good digs are either in South Loop or further North in the form of PLeasant and Nightwood. Perhaps they do not feel as much pressure to perfect dishes. I will be back though, again, the proximity. Also, I have yet to try the Sunday dinner that I have heard good things about.

So what does all this have to do with Nana? Nothing really.  I mean it.  I'm about to label this incredible establishment of Bridgeport ""my favorite restaurant in Chicago,"" and pretty much the best place to go for basically any occasion.  It overtakes Lao Beijing at this point- which is hard to believe since I go there about 80 times per week... To anyone other than myself, my thoughts on Nana would be hyperbolic... but they're not...

Since the bartender has to make drinks for all the servers, he tended to us when he could.  He was not attentive.  Or very personable.   It's worth waiting a few more minutes for an available table.   The food was very flavorful, the ingredients fresh, and even though the prices were a bit on the higher end for breakfast/ brunch, I felt like the quality was very good.

We got there right at the brunch peak and Nana sat us right away! This place was crowded but they have plenty of seating aka i didn't have to squeeze into my seat and we didn't bump into anyone!  Their menu have a southern flare, and as much as I'm not a big fan of it (I wish they have more sweet options), I went with the chilaquiles, and my brunch date had the huevos rancheros. Food came out surprisingly fast - it made me feel like they prepared them before we even order them. But everything was delicious so no complain there! We also got a soup and a side of fruit to share. The soup (of the day) was really heavy, especially for the morning. I didn't care for it that much. Fruit was, well, fruit!  We had a waitress in training, and she was really nervous I could tell. She was nice, and she tried to make small talks by the end, but it just ended in awkward nods and forced laugh - I'm not sure why, but I'm pretty sure we don't look intimidating or scary.

One of my favorite dishes here was a biscuits with duck gravy (no longer on the menu I believe). They really need to bring this dish back! Very rich and fatty and bad for you... but so good :) The Nanadict is also usually a safe choice. The dish I didn't enjoy was a sauteed softshell crab dish that is no longer on the menu. Good thing too because it was pretty bad. I am a big fan of soft shell crab dishes and cook it myself every once in awhile, so I feel like I have a pretty good idea of how it should taste and how it should be prepared. The soft shell crab in the dish I had was super greasy and had no flavor (except oil). I told my server that I didn't like it, so she took the dish away and a manager came over to ask me what was wrong with it. I told him that it was too greasy and not crisp at all, and instead of just offering another dish in its place he decided to try to educate me on their cooking process. He claimed that it was supposed to be that way because it was sauteed rather than deep fried. Regardless of how you cook the soft shell crab, who would want it soft, greasy and bland? I told him that I know how to cook soft shell crab and that they really just didn't do a good job with it. He begrudgingly asked if I wanted anything else but all the arguing with him made me lose my appetite.

2013-02-07,1.0,"I'd estimate that I have dined in at Nana over 20 times over the past 3 years and ordered carryout about 6 times over that span. The food is delicious! My wife and I love it and really enjoy bringing guests from out of town there whenever we have the chance. I have even purchased a Patrick Skoff painting off of their wall.  Tonight we decided to order carryout. I've ordered the chicken sandwich multiple times (both carryout and dine in) and the portion has always been overwhelming. Tonight, that was not the case. Not only are they not offering the usual ""anytimes"" side option (grits, mac n cheese, squash, sprouts, etc.) that used to come with the sandwiches, they have substituted this with a miniature side salad that you can finish in one bite. That was disappointing but not my main complaint. My problem was with the size of the piece of chicken, which was easily 1/4 of the size of the pieces that used to come on the sandwich. Guacamole used to be included on the sandwich and now they charge $3 extra for that. What is happening here? The price has remained the same, you no longer get a legitimate side, the guac is extra, and the chicken portion is a joke. You can't even see the chicken now as the sandwich is all bun, whereas before the chicken was overflowing from the side. I politely called them after I got home and spoke to one of the owners. I expressed my concern and he explained that they cut the portion of chicken down since so many people couldn't finish the previous sandwich portion. He really said that. Since I didn't see the price of the sandwich adjusted with the smaller portion (along with no longer getting a side and guac included), I wanted the owner to know my feedback. All he said was, ""I'm sorry about that.""  I used to own a large dry cleaners in Palatine and if I ever had a customer complaint, I would do ANYTHING that I could to make sure that they were satisfied and would be returning. I realize that Nana has been on Diners, Drive In's, and Dives and they usually pack the restaurant daily, but I feel that you should never take that for granted.

This was my first foray into Nana's and the place was packed. Those waiting for a seat were hovering awkwardly over diners as they were trying to eat their meals.

The moment we were seated, we ordered and our food was cranked out in about 10-15 minutes. The shrimp and oyster po' boy was deliciously portioned with grilled shrimp and fried oysters over a bed of giardiniera and arugula in a soft baguette. And, the poached pear brioche french toast with slivers of pear, cinnamon whipped cream and pear syrup was scrumptious. A side of bacon was plentiful, but semi-soggy. The bacon-braised collard greens were a little on the tart side. Otherwise, service is attentive when they can maneuver their way around the crowd of waiting patrons.

Service -- Jimmy the Host is much more interested in overcrowding the bar area than satisfying the hungry stomach.  It took 30 mins to be seated with tables that were still empty when I left.  Flip more pages with a short list, a walk-in duo were seated before me.  Timing is significantly slower compared to the Anniversary Party. Venue -- slowly becoming a clutter.  How many rows of ketchup and glasses do you need to serve dinner service?

2012-12-18,4.0,"Perhaps it is a mistake to be drafting this review at 11:30, when the hungries strike.  Just thinking about what I ate at Nana yesterday is tempting the tummy gremlins, but sacrifice I will.  So, Janet Jackson, chalk this up as what I did for you lately. I tossed a coin between the pumpkin walnut pancakes and the omelet of the day, which was spinach, mushroom, tomato and goat cheese.  The coin was heavily weighted towards the omelet because I used a trick coin and just really wanted the omelet.  They accommodated my request for no tomatoes, producing through omission the greatest omelet combination ever.  The egg was cooked well, though not quite as dry as I like, but the veggies were a little too oily.  I assume they were sauteed and then folded into the omelet, and they were just really wet.  Still, an excellent combination and I was mostly happy. It came with two slices of theee most major toast I've ever had.  It was very thick and very dense.  There were also home fries, which I can take or leave, and a great little green salad.  That was delightful and a great balancer of all the volume of the omelet and major toast.      The drink menu lists masala chai at $5 so I held onto my benjamin and went for the English breakfast tea for $4.  Luckily, the bill showed $2.50 which is really all tea should ever cost.  I also tried some of my husband's rompope, which was a vanilla coffee latte described as Mexican eggnog.  It wasn't too eggnogy but it was really good anyway. On a late Monday morning, I was surprised that we were not alone - there were several other parties either playing hooky like us or otherwise free to indulge in a weekday brunch (good for them!).  Our server was accurate in spite of doing the no-writing thing, but he wasn't too friendly.  It's possible he was covering the entire place himself, so perhaps he was just busy.     In addition to the pumpkin pancakes, I would also go back to try the lunch menu's lentil tacos.  So it looks like we will be back in Bridgeport sometime with a couple hours to kill between breakfast and lunch.  Just kidding, we wouldn't eat there twice in a day.  Okay, yes we would.",0.9956,0.773,0.174,0.053,0.5258991228070176
2012-12-17,4.0,"Nana was stop #1 on Anniversary Funday, and it was a great start to our excursion.  The place is charming, especially on a late morning with lots of light.  The space, filled with white painted wood, brick walls, and rustic metal fixtures, was decked out--quite tastefully--for the holidays, adding much to the overall comfortable, cheery vibe. We came for breakfast, but the specials menu caught my attention:  fried oyster chowder.  I had to try it, and was glad that I did.  Fennel, fried oysters, and a restrained hand with the cream made for an unexpectedly excellent soup. I opted for the huevos rancheros, partially because the menu noted the inclusion of vidalia onions and green peppers.  That is one of the happiest pairings in the vegetable kingdom and they added some simple but welcome personality to the dish.  Overall it was very tasty.  I wouldn't have minded another tortilla because there was so much flavorful food that I needed a little more plain starch to balance out each bite.  So I just kifed a few of my wife's home fries, large, crispy, golden cubes of potato.  Mmm, it was all so good.  Oh, and I recommend the soyrizo; you won't miss the real thing. Two more hits remained for the end of my meal.  First was the pear preserves which came with my wife's omelette--fantastic.  Why have I never seen this anywhere else?  I would purchase this by the jar.  Second was the rompope latte, described on the menu as ""Mexican eggnog.""  This is apparently a Mexican vanilla liqueur and it makes a brilliant latte.  If you want a little sweet coffee thing at the end of your meal, check this out.  It even arrives at the perfect temperature so that you don't have to wait ten minutes to take your first sip. Service was a little slow and not very warm, but it didn't dampen our experience.  Nana is way off the beaten path for us, but I would love to return to try a few other menu options (such as the po' boy and the spiked hot apple cider) and who knows what wonderful specials they might have available.",0.996,0.793,0.176,0.031,0.4895012973137974

I called a couple of friends to see who was on board and lucky me I hang out with some friends that will never let me down when it comes to food, lol. Get in the car and pick them up since it was on the way. On the way but not to Nana, but to another restaurant that never disappoints. Suddenly I remembered that I have always wanted to try this place and I make the suggestion, they were cool with it. I call Nana and ask about the wait time. No wait time right now they informed me and to Nana's we go. We get there and park close to the place. Open the door and are greeted by the hostess. Mature lady and if I'm not mistaken the matriarch. ""How many?"" She asks. ""Three"" I replied. Then she grabbed the menus and directed us to a table in the front room right by the entrance and said ""you can sit here..... I guess"". Waitress comes and takes the order chilaquiles, chilaquiles, veggie omelet, coffee, coffee, hot chocolate and french toast. She couldn't have been any nicer and professional. As we were waiting for the food I took a look and the place is cool, simple, clean and nicely decorated.  We get the food and everything was good. The chilaquiles are more like casserole style than the usual chilaquiles, very good non the less. The house fries were amazing. Coffee was good but hot chocolate was great. Don't forget the sunny side up eggs, they were cooked perfectly, about the best I have ever had. French toast was ok, it comes with agave syrup.  The food was good, the company was perfect and I was having a good time but all throughout breakfast there was something that was bothering me.  You see, I believe that words carry weight on them and a simple Innocent word or tone of voice can mean a lot. I wished I had asked the hostess what exactly did she mean when she said ""you can sit here........ I guess"" It is highly unlikely that their seating process is a random luck game where she had to ""guess"" where to seat us. I am intrigued more than mortified about the meaning of it.

The restaurant specializes in fresh organic farm to table food with a Latino twist. The menu has a nice selection with a daily specials menu that includes different appetizers and entrees. Here's what we had: FRIED OYSTER CHOWDER: this starter was on the specials menu that day. The chowder was deliciously thick with chunks of cauliflower, potato, celery and corn with a perfectly fried oyster on top. It was so good that my brunch companion ended up ordering one at the end of our meal. NANADICT: this was the star of the show. This is a play on eggs benedict. Instead of english muffins, Nana uses papusas, which are thick tortillas made of corn flour. These are then topped with ground house made chorizo with poached eggs on top with a poblano cream sauce. The dish is also served with crispy fried potatoes and a light arugula salad. The papusas were delicious! The combination of the spiciness of the chorizo, smokiness of the poblano cream and richness of the poached egg yoks was amazing. **RECOMMEND THIS** BEEF BURGER: this is an 8 ounce burger that comes with a side. My brunch buddy ended up paying a little extra to get it with truffle mac n cheese  Other than the food, the service was awesome.

Decent, with the the perfect amount of thyme and well-cooked pasta, but came out lukewarm enough to where the cheese had started to congeal. Again, like it had been sitting out too long to serve.   -Lentil tacos. These could be yummy if executed well. The tiny lentils were mixed with a really great sauce, and the coleslaw was fresh and tasty. The pineapple salsa was probably excellent the day it was made but was slightly off. The tortillas were dry and cold, which I don't get at ALL, but was consistent with everything else we ate. The rice was lukewarm. I wouldn't pay fifteen bucks for it again.  -Collard greens. These had good flavor, but on the second bite my friend got a crunchy mouthful of dirt and grit that signified the greens weren't cleaned very well. Those didn't get eaten. -I know what you're thinking. ""But why didn't you SAY something, fool!"" Service was distracted and even a bit chilly. I think it was a busier night than they had expected, so we weren't surprised when we remarked about the dirty greens to someone clearing the table and there wasn't much of a reaction.

Alcoholic beverages were sweet but lacking alcohol.  The fried chicken dinner - it's so confusing when you read mixed reviews on Yelp but we should NOT have ordered it.  The chicken was dry (which is better than raw like what other people have gotten!) - oh how I missed Popeye's chicken at that moment.  The pickled veggies and nuts were fine but those are not the main course!  The biscuit....UGH.  SO DRY AND FLAVORLESS!!!!!!!  I needed to suck down my water to get it down my throat since it absorbed all of my saliva and was still bone dry!   The best entree was what Guy Fieri liked (or pretended to like haha) - the oyster and shrimp poboy.  Not amazing but large, filled, fried the right way, on a chewy roll.  Just expect alot of seasoned mayo. And the softshell crab?  OH MAN it was horrible!  Small flimsy pieces that tasted like a dirty ocean.  GROSS.

2012-08-19,1.0,"Nana used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The food, the ambience, the service. It was always dependable. I certainly told many friends and relatives about it (those who hadn't already been there). So it came as a complete shock on my last visit when my party was treated so terribly. Thanks to an incredibly rude waitress, I'm likely never to go back again.  I had made a reservation in advance for a birthday party. We were seated at two tables next to crates of glasses and other things that should have gone into a storeroom. No big deal. I thought I was being courteous by telling Nana herself that a couple in our party would be a little late. She seemed concerned at first about holding more space than we might need (which I understood; but we had no control over two friends who were running late; that's a risk you run when you have a restaurant, eh?). But then she said not to worry. Plus, the empty space was next to these empty glasses and she said no one would want to sit there anyway. I guess it was okay for us, though.  I never would have thought about this again if it hadn't been for our server, Nikki. She took our drink orders and mentioned the empty space at our table and said that reservations were picking up and they might need that space. I assured her that Nana had okayed it (all while thinking that we'd made the reservations in advance, so if they were really pressed for space, they shouldn't have allowed our reservation or others). Nikki then sulked, rolled her eyes at us, and even turned her back on my 14 year old while he was still placing his order. Her attitude was so atrocious it's amazing she hasn't been fired. (Harrison, another server who brought out our apps, is the best and should be in Nikki's position; he's always a charm to be around).  My friend's steak was brought out undercooked according to how she placed her order. When one person in my party didn't get his beer after 10 minutes, Nikki became defensive. All this time, the table on the other side of us (far from the crates of glasses) stood empty. I kept count the whole evening and there were always 4-5 empty tables in our room. Way to make us feel like we could have a leisurely dinner. I've been to this restaurant half a dozen times and it's always been a place where I could catch up with friends and not feel rushed. I'm not sure why that's changed, especially when the place never filled up. Wouldn't they want it to look full to show off their popularity? Toward the end of our meal, Nikki snapped something about how our late friend would probably only order something to drink. What did it matter to her? If she had been nice or even just neutral, she could have made that up in tips. And when I asked for decaf tea, she again got defensive and said that their tea selections constantly change. If they cared so much about tea and changed their selection  all the time, why was it absent from the dessert menu?  If you're in Bridgeport and are looking for a memorable meal and a fun place to go, I say skip Nana and head for Nightwood.",0.9955,0.814,0.139,0.047,0.5121808143547273

2012-07-01,1.0,"There are better breakfast places people.  Period.   I have been here twice so I know this wasn't just an ""off"" day as the first time I came the experience was very similar.   Over-priced (by a lot, lot - $70 for two people after tip, are you fucking kidding me??  It's breakfast!! and not a 5 star, 4 coursed one- just a normal breakfast!!) ***********$14 for 2 orange juices!!  It doesn't take an army to fresh squeeze them you jerks - how on earth were the juices more than my actual meal.  Total and deliberate rip off, Who the F@$& do these people think they are?? Bring your own water bottle with juice in it if you have to.*************** We began with the Poptarts starter, my friend got the eggs nanadicts which is their take on the eggs Benedict and I got the duck biscuits and gravy, 2 oranges juices.  That should have been more in the $20 per person range, not $35 per person. So lemme just tell you - the cooks are no pastry chefs.  Seriously, they need to take some classes or just hire a pastry chef because they're doing things all wrong.  The poptarts were sincerely unique, plated beautifully and were my favorite.  The pastry itself though was not done under the first crispy layer, it was still flour-y and doughy.Everything else about it was pretty darn good though.  The filling was tart but in that good way, the frosting was complimentary (although could probably use a touch more to help balance the tartness), the macadamia nut brittle was a unique bonus crumbled over the dish (albeit it didn't make any damn sense to have it).  All in all I may just head back here one day just to give these poptarts another go, see if the cooks manage to cook the dough all the way through next time. The duck biscuits and gravy... don't get me fucking started.  What the heck man?  First off, way too much food and there is absolutely no point for the egg to go along with the dish itself, especially when it's just plopped on top with no place to go.  It just doesn't belong.   The gravy was ""ok"" but there wasn't enough of it for the amount of bisquit, there were larger pearl onions overpowering it and taking up space in my dish (especially being that I despise onions and these greasy, slimy little things really turned me off).  The duck itself was a little....... off.  Not completely gross or wrong as I would have sent it back, but just... off.  Either a little too gamy or it was reheated.  Nothing special what so ever.  And the biscuits... oh boy the bisquits were all wrong.  Again, they were under cooked, waaaaaaaaay too dense and floury, they're called ""cheddar"" biscuits but I didn't notice a cheddary thing about them (not even a little bit, really)....  I have tried dozens of biscuits and gravy over my years, it's my thing, my go-to... these were the WORST biscuits and gravy I have ever had.  I've had better at truck stops during road trips.  To finalized they were plated inside a bowl dish which was all wrong.  I had no room to eat my food and the dish just became this big swimming bowl of broken up pieces of biscuit, gravy, greasy onions, some green peas or green onion and the two eggs that just kept getting in my gosh darn way. I was so irritable after eating there.  That's no bueno.  Last but not least the hostess at the front of the joint was stuck-up and unfriendly.  That should have told me to leave and head somewhere else straight from the git-go.   This place has such potential!!  What I feel the problem is the head chef is far too ambitious with the dishes and doesn't know when to just stop.  Stop and let the food speak for itself.  Instead one random thing is built upon the other until the dish is just ruined.  Very amateur.",-0.9791,0.823,0.073,0.104,0.5567422524565381

Like everything sounded so flipping good, and I'm seeing stuff being served to other tables that looks so damn good. They have a nice drink list and I got some microbrew weiss beer, and BF an Arnold Palmer (made with homemade lemonade). BF and I both decided to get the Sunday Supper. The relish tray came out first and what a nice relish tray it was! A pile of organic veggies - okra,  arugula salad, olives, spicy peanuts, tomatoes, apples, some pickled red thing that was super fibrous and hard to chew (my least fav, haha), and I forget what else. Super tasty and fresh. Ok, so then this big plate with chicken, mac & cheese, biscuits comes out. Also, a plate with more veggies and salad. I must say I didn't even eat any veggies as I was devouring the most delicious chicken with the best crispy crust, and the yummy biscuit, and the mac & cheese which had truffle flavor (which I really do not love, but it is slowly growing on me). This is some seriously good chow. So I'm stuffed at this point and there is still dessert coming with dinner. There are 3 choices and BF and I both opt for the chocolate cake thingy with buttercream and raspberry gelato and fruit. I have no idea what the fruit was...looked like little grapes the size of peas (but they weren't grapes, I don't think), and little white mulberry looking things.

She said 7:00 would be better tha 7:15 OKAY. Since she had hinted that a slew of people were arriving at 7:00, we arrived at 6:50. The inside of the restaurant was empty. It took a while for any one to notice four of us standing at the reception stand. We were shown to a table next to the servers' station. I asked if we might have a quieter table. I was told the other tables were reserved. But we had a reservation! Yes, but it has to do with when you'll be finished. OKAY, nice job docking us for being on time.

2012-05-16,4.0,"I'm a little torn here about how to rate Nana. Food alone gets a well deserved 5 stars. Everything else lacked some. So let's break it down..... Food: 5+ stars Service: 2 stars - max. Ambiance: 4 stars That comes out to an average of 3.67 stars so I guess I'll round up. Let me elaborate.  Food: Nana's food is by far, some of the best local and organic dishes I've had. Everything was extremely fresh and came from local farms (Nichol's, Gunthorp, 312 Aquaponics). Restaurants that support local agriculture make me and my belly extremely happy. Four of us met for brunch on Mother's Day and ordered way too much food for 4 people, plus a few drinks, and damn near devoured it all. So obvs, we loved it. The grand menu.... // Garden Omelet - seasonal veggies, mushrooms, home fries, grilled sourdough, seasonal jam and butter, farm greens // Nanadict - poached eggs, chorizo, pupusas, poblano cream, farm greens, home fries // Grilled Laughing Bird Shrimp & Fried Oyster Po' boy - cajun mayo, giardiniera, baguette, arugula, duck fat-roasted potatoes // Grilled Hanger Steak ""Chimichurri"" - cauliflower puree, grilled ramps, yuca fries, meyer lemon // Side of biscuits & duck gravy // Side of cheddar and poblano grits // Side of roasted beets with goat cheese // Side of truffle mac 'n cheese with bacon Yep. We pretty much ate all of that. Obnoxious, I know. I had the garden omelet. Hands down, best  I have ever had. It was packed full of green veggies - green beans, pea pods, fiddle head ferns, asparagus, and spinach. It was ridiculously good and prepared just how I like it. The eggs were cooked through and the veggies were laying nicely in between the fold. Like a taco. It came with a nice arugula salad and some fresh fruit. De-lish. I wasn't overly impressed with the biscuits & duck gravy or truffle mac, which are a few of the faves on the menu. They were good, don't get me wrong, I think I just prefer the southern style as opposed to these fancy pants versions. However, the cheddar/poblano grits were to die for, as well as the roasted golden beet salad with goat cheese. On to the booze. I knew I had to have one of their infamous Roasted Poblano Bloody Marys. Holy delciousness in a glass. This was the best bloody mary I've ever had. This wasn't made with the premixed crap out of the bottle. The ingredients were the freshest of fresh, and the pureed poblanos added a sweetness to the slight kick the drink had. And a note to the wise, don't drink one on an empty stomach. I was spinning half way through the glass. That puppy was strong! Dark and Stormy, ""Creole"" Manhattan, and ""Back of the yards"" Campari and Soda also made a cameo during brunch.  Service: Here's where I have some angst. I fully understand that it was Mother's Day, and probably busier than usual. However, I feel like Nana failed to anticipate and prepare for that. Our reservations were running way behind, the kitchen was extremely backed up, and by the time we were seated at 1pm, nearly all of the specials ((including the sweet potato donuts and chicken & waffles)) were sold out. Seriously?? How do you run out of your most popular items?? I guess Gunthorp Farms can't pump out those chickens fast enough! ((Although I'd rather have no chicken, than chop shop chicken)). It was a major disappoint since some of the specials were things we had wanted to try. Props for being up front about it, at least. From the time of order to the time to table was a good hour. It was ridiculous. When we finally did get the food, there were little elements missing. For example, the roasted gouda cheese on my bloody mary accoutrement stick, or the delicious homemade jam for my toast. Sometimes it's the little things that make the dish. Our waitress was very friendly and apologetic, but you could tell she was somewhat stressed and wasn't quite attentive as she could have been.  My overall opinion: Nana itself is cozy and quaint. It's a great spot for brunch, a get together, or a date. The food itself is phenomenal, but the service lacks. Would I go back? Of course! I'll suck up the crappy service to an underestimated busy Mother's Day. However, I wouldn't come starving. Good things come to those who wait, right?!

Being an M Henry loyalist (which is having its own problems lately--no more veggie burger) I was thrilled. Every time I've eaten here, the service has been kind of off. Either it took forever for our server to come by, we got our drinks significantly after the table next to us that came later (and only after we asked), got a hibiscus tea instead of a regular, etc. But the food more than made up for it. Specifically the Signature Chilaquile Casserole and the Homemade English Muffin Sandwich. I don't know what inspires a kitchen to call something signature and then drop it from the menu, but these two gems are gone. I was so disappointed and the server strangely explained that they are making room for new items (but there didn't seem to be any newbies on the menu then).  So I try the vegetable omelet and sorry, but it was gross. The egg was flat and overcooked and then thrown in the middle were sauteed peas and mushrooms. I'm just not into pea omelets. The menu says it's ""seasonal vegetables"" or the like so I guess my fault for not asking. I don't eat meat so eliminating the heaven that was the chilaquile casserole is a total bummer and given that I could get the sandwich without meat, even less veggie options here. Annoying. I won't be back anytime soon, especially because the prices are on the high side for just so-so service and a menu I now would have to search through for something good.

I have to make an exception for Nana in case there are people out there who like me, saw this restaurant on DDD and have been meaning to try it. My gf and I went to Nana's for dinner. We made a reservation but despite that, had to wait over an hour for a table. That in itself wasn't too bad - it's Chicago, I expect to wait for a table at 'nicer' restaurants. What we didn't bargain for was the horrible service. The hostess ignored us when we came in while she chatted on the phone for about 15 mins. Then when she got off the phone, started speaking to the larger party behind us even though we were right in front of her podium. Okaaayy.  When we finally had her attention, she was rude , dismissive and didn't seem to know what she was doing. She kept disappearing for long periods of time and no one was getting seated even though you could see empty tables in the restaurant. When we finally got seated (without any apologies), it was another long wait to get the attention of our server. It took about 30 mins to get her to our table. We ordered everything at once (drinks, apps, dinner) because we were afraid we would never see her again.  For entrees, she had the veggie pot pie and I had the pork shoulder.  I thought her food tasted a bit better than mine but both were nothing special. We were supposed to meet  friends after dinner but the whole experience left us in a bad mood (and took so long) that we just went home afterwards. To summarize, Nana is an overpriced place with mediocre food and horrible service. From reading other reviews, it seems their brunch service might be better but i have no intention of ever returning to this restaurant.",-0.3664,0.836,0.077,0.087,0.6570546737213404

More details on what we had, I had coffee while waiting it is good, strong and flavorful which is important for breakfast I had the huevos rancheros, my girlfriend had the breakfast burrito, they tasted the same, the dishes looked impressive but lacked flavor.

I liked the sandwich, the bottom part of the sandwich broke apart due to so many ingredients packed in.  Tomato had to have been organic, as it was very tasty.  The Cajun mayo was the focal point as while it was good, this coming from someone that doesn't like mayo, they could of cut back on the amount as it seemed like I was getting a bunch of the mayo around my mouth from every bite, which made me feel like a gay porn actor.   Also ordered an Arnold Palmer type (non-alcohol) drink that had hibiscus tea that was very refreshing. Very loud inside so don't go here expecting a conversation-friendly atmosphere as it got pretty crowded.  Oh, and the servers here were very personable and enjoyed talking about the organic food here.",0.6835,0.838,0.087,0.075,0.6470238095238096

It's a fantastic discovery really, in such an unexpected location. Organic food, fascinating flavors, and what I'd describe as farmhouse chic interiors (which is common among organic restaurants I find) I ordered the veggie torta with the poblano chedder grits, boyfriend ordered the 8oz burger (so not adventurous of him!) with the mashed potatoes and duck confit gravy. We both left full and satisfied. :) I highly recommend the torta. Ingredients all so simple, yet there is no way I could go home and prepare anything remotely similar in flavor, there's got to be some secrets hidden within it. The grits were as comforting as expected, perfectly warming on a cool night. And bottomless coffee which really hit the spot. I also highly recommend the truffle mac 'n cheese, which I had ordered on a previous visit.  What I didn't see on the menu was the citrusy green bean salad (the name escapes me)! It was phenomenal and if you didn't get to try it, you missed out! I almost forgot the actual reason I was prompted to write the review! Flaming rosemary! Towards the end of dinner, the place began smelling heavenly. I couldn't ignore it, it was so amazing and I look over to the kitchen area to see the chef torching sprigs of rosemary.

It was very good, had a bunch of different flavors, spices, and textures. The poached eggs brought the meal together. My favorite item on the plate was the tortilla cakes (not sure the official name) that was resting under the chorizo and eggs. My girlfriend got the chicken sandwich, nothing special but the sweet potato chips were top notch.

She then got upset and said the chicken dinner was $22 per person and then passive aggressively said, ""It's alright"" and walked away. I felt like I'd been accused of stealing. It all became apparent what she meant when the food came out: my other two friends had ordered the chicken dinner as well, and all the food came out on large communal plates. Oh.

Add to this weird experience that other staff kept trying to take our plates even before we had finished and in sum it was a very off-putting service experience. The food was fine. Not great. The combination of biscuits, fried chicken, and mac and cheese made for a very dry dinner, and the cole slaw had way more jalapenos than anyone could possibly eat.

(It was not even busy.)  When we were finally seated, our waitress had an attitude from the outset.  At one point, I went to ask the hostess a question, but she was purposely avoiding eye contact with me by fiddling with the house's cordless phone. (She wasn't even talking on it; she was just aimlessly pushing buttons.) We ordered the duck confit biscuits and gravy which is advertized at $6, but actually costs $10 if you want duck (!).  We also ordered the po' boy, the most expensive sub sandwich ever, and the special that night which was tacos with various pickled veggies.  The tacos were a decent value at $3 each. The duck confit biscuits and gravy was a mixed bag: the duck and gravy were deliciously savory, but the biscuits were altogether too sweet.  I understand the idea of balancing the savoriness of the duck with sweet, but it was simply out of balance. The po' boy is a handful of fried shrimp, drowned in mayo, surrounded by store-bought bread.  I removed the bread and tried to shake as much of the mayo off as I could.  The taste was okay... but $16 for it?  I don't think so. The tacos were okay.  I enjoyed the veggies more than the taco, though.  Something's wrong with that. For dessert, we ordered the goat cheese cheesecake.  When the waitress arrived with it, we were confronted by two measly square (literally) inches of cheesecake, oozing pretentiousness.  The taste was unremarkable, and for $6 (keep in mind the portion size), I would have rather bought a frozen piece of Eli's cheesecake. The service reached a nadir as our waitress over-charged us for our food when she ran my credit card.  The bill said one thing, the amount that was charged to my account was about $10 higher.  The waitress then told me that I could leave her the balance as a tip.  Since that would have meant giving a 25% tip, I politely asked for cash.  For whatever reason, this seemed to be impossible, and the waitress refused to do anything to remedy the situation. Eventually, I spoke to a barely-coherent foreign lady who called the owner (who for some reason wasn't present for the FRIDAY NIGHT DINNER SERVICE), and we eventually left with the cash. Honestly, do *not* bother with this place for dinner.  It was truly the worst restaurant experience I've had in the last decade.  I've heard that brunch is good here, but I still wouldn't go because of the poor service.

NO.  Fruit Flies invade our table.  My children begin slapping their hands together trying to kill them.  Then our food comes...it looks DELISH...but the fruit flies are swarming...landing on our food...needless to say...we lose our appetites...!  When the server comes back we tell her about the flies...she SEES them because we have trapped one under our water glass and they are visible on the white paneled wall behind our table.  She acknowledges the problem and says she'll talk to someone.  Nana had already left at this point.  When the server returned, she gave us our check and said NOTHING about our experience.  NOTHING.  And when we opened the bill....guess what?  We were charged $100 for a meal that we couldn't/didn't even eat!!!  So,  normally I would tweet about this horrible experience, post it on my fb wall, etc...but no.  I like the fact that we have a place like Nana in our neighborhood and I don't want to jump the gun. So instead...I go to their website, send them an emial explaining what happened.....two weeks have gone by and NOTHING.  NO response to our issue ....just like when we were at the restaurant and complained...NO response so I'm sorry Nana...but I have to tell you that no matter how many times you are on the food network, and no matter how many awards you are nominated for and/or receive...none of that will matter if you don't put your customers first!!!!  Please put your egos aside and get back to the business at hand....your customers!",-0.9574,0.842,0.06,0.097,0.41744417862838923
2012-02-04,5.0,"This areas on the rise, or I'm just late to the game. Nanas a quaint breakfast and brunch spot (also serving lunch and dinner), located on a less busier part of Halstead, with an interior strait out of a high end kitchen advertisement in Bon Appetit. Plus, being this far south on Halstead keeps it less busy than some of the other breakfast hot spots in LP, WP, or DT.  On a sunny Monday morning after a long Sunday attending a Bears game, 2 friends and I came in here in full Bears attire. We probably looked out of place or lost. What once was lost, has now been found. We were fortunate enough to find ourselves in good hands.  Nana is family owned and using strictly organic products. Their menu will have you salivating and probably asking yourself, ""OH NO! What am I going to order?!?!"" My friend and I split their seasonal French Toast which was made with Michigan cherries, white chocolate sauce, and a cherry mousse filling. Wow was it good. I had their special of Steak and Eggs, with some wilted spinach, a type of reduction sauce, and a parsnip puree that nearly knocked me off my stool. My friend had a staple item that I tried a few bites of, their Nanadict. I see why they use their name in the dish, it's certainly something that will leave you saying Nana all day. The chorizo is house made, with a little kick. I make a poblano cream sauce (really easy) at home that's just like the one they use in this dish.  Nana also has a stockade of fresh squeezed juices. Their juicer was down, booh hoo, but they had some OJ still on hand. Very good. They also make a phenomenal bloody Mary along with a very appealing list of cocktails. Me thinks I gotsta take the lady here for lunch and a few cocktails on the weekend.  Nana is a perfect spot with a lot of quality food and drinks to offer.

2012-01-29,5.0,"Let's not mince words here: Nana is the perfect brunch spot. The space is sunny and warm with exposed brick walls, bead board cabinetry, and butcher block tabletops. I think that the owners reached into my mind, extracted my dream kitchen, and then built it in restaurant form. There are 2 rooms to accommodate a lot of people, but it still gets crowded. The crowds are there because of the stellar food. I ordered the huevos rancheros and devoured every single morsel. It was perfect. Did you hear that? Perfect. I cannot think of a single thing I would change about it. The menu is full of tasty-sounding dishes, and I can't wait to try more things. Our waiter, Marco, was the cherry on top of our fantastic brunch experience. I believe he's part of the ownership of Nana based on his knowledge. He made a delicious special syrup for my friend's meal, talked about when Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives came in to film, and joked with me about my clean plate at the end of my meal.

2012-01-15,2.0,"Let me preface this review by saying: 1. I live very close to Nana, and really, really want to see new, local businesses succeed in Bridgeport. 2. It takes a lot for me to take the time to write ANY review. But when a place (or a person within that place) begins to get too big for its britches, perhaps it's time they get taken to task. Honestly, my experience with the food at Nana has been nothing more, and nothing less than three stars. While it's pretty good, I've never been compelled to keep coming back and bringing friends. Perhaps if the prices were lowered, more trips could be justified. The really negative thing I've experience at Nana is the service. Absolutely abysmal. On two separate occasions, more than a year apart, it has been by the same person - I'm pretty sure it's one of the proprietors, or the proprietor's son (bigger guy, dark hair, always in a black shirt). The first encounter with this ray of sunshine was when I brought a friend from out of town to try Nana. My first experience there was just fine, if not very positive. So, I thought I'd bring my buddy to experience the new uber-trendy local, organic restaurant. First off, when we were sat, initially right next to the entrance (i.e. the door that is constantly opening with a brunch crowd coming and going on a freezing cold winter day), and asked to be moved to one of the open tables within the restaurant, we were met with a sigh of exasperation. Perhaps we were throwing off their seating rotation? They did not bring us silverware, even after our food arrived. We eventually had to go up to the bar and get it ourselves. When the food actually did arrive, I did not get what I ordered. My order was some sort of organic banana hemp pancakes. Trust me - that is exactly what I ordered. It was on the menu, and items like these pancakes are EXACTLY why I go to places like Nana - to try new, potentially delicious things. When my order came, I received plain pancakes. No biggie. Simple mistake. When I told our ""server"" (the aforementioned proprietor), about the mistake, he simply stated that I did not order the banana hemp cakes, and that what I had in front of me is what I ordered. Yep. He essentially argued with me and claimed I was lying about what I ordered. Just what in the hell would I have to gain by concocting some elaborate ruse about what I actually ordered?! He was clearly irritated that I wanted the actual food I ordered, and offered to bring out some cut up bananas to throw on top of my pancakes. What? Really? Maybe this half-assed resolution could have been common ground had I not just been spoken to as if I were a complete idiot. No sir, I want what I ordered. Of course, after putting him out, he really showed us by not returning to the table until a half hour later to collect our payment. Let me say this about the order. I am not an overly demanding person when I go to a restaurant. And, in fact, I believe I treat servers, bussers, and bartenders with a ton of respect (the same I expect and hope to be treated with). But even if I were a terribly difficult customer, and DID order the wrong thing (I did not), it's the restaurant/server's job to fix it. That's the way customer service works. To openly scoff and seem put off by a paying, respectful customer is unacceptable. The second experience was not my own, but by my significant other yesterday. Same guy, same table crammed in by the door (the temperature was in the teens [not a fun feeling to have an arctic blast constantly hit you while trying to enjoy breakfast]), and same dismissive attitude. When our loveable guy came to ""check on"" the table, he walked off before they could even say they wanted more coffee. When he did hear her request, he once again gave the look like he was going to have to bend over backwards and track down coffee beans in Central America and roast them himself. Never came back. Eventually a person came to clear the table, and he was petitioned to find someone to come back to fill their coffee - over a half hour after the meal was finished, and they were essentially ready to leave. Maybe all the press is making this place feel it's holier than thou. Maybe it's just this one guy. Either way, it should be fixed. Check the attitude, or perhaps take this fella off the floor. Also, I understand the demand at Nana. But get rid of the table by the door. Nobody wants to eat there. It's miserable. Beyond the constant blasts of freezing air, you've got the brunch crowd waiting to be seated hovering over your table. That simply sucks. Once again, I want to like local businesses. I want these places to succeed. Just don't get too comfortable and start acting like you're the only show in town. Bridgeport Cafe down the street has food half the price, with twice the portions, and the most amazingly friendly servers I've probably ever come across. They've been getting my business lately, and may continue if Nana does not improve.",0.9891,0.842,0.1,0.057,0.4090286486563083
2012-01-12,3.0,"It breaks my heart to give this place a two star rating. If it weren't for spotty service and a bus boy that stole my wife's iPhone then it would have 5 stars. Yes, my wife left her iPhone on the seat as she handled our two children and forgot the phone. This took place on New Years day. No one was sitting by our table because brunch was over and the restaurant was closing so this shouldn't have been an issue. We drove 5 blocks away and realized the phone was missing and called nana (from a different phone obviously) to see if it was there. They said no. We called the phone and it was already off and we know it had a high battery charge at the time. And, we checked the phone tracker and it was off as well, meaning that the sim card was already removed. The bus boy (and it was him) took my phone in LESS THAN 5 minutes time and stripped it down so it couldn't be tracked. There was no one in the room near the phone and no one that would look at the seat other than an employee so I'm blaming the staff! Yes, we forgot the phone so we're to blame but this is pathetic, less than 5 minutes and it was clearly stolen.  We went to nana constantly because the food is awesome and drinks delicious but they have no integrity and are staffing thieves. We live less than a mile away and will never return to this establishment. I hope the scratched up phone was worth it.   And since I'm already bashing them I might as well add a message for the owner. Don't park your white VW jetta station wagon in front (33rd St.).

2012-01-08,4.0,"Going to Nana is like seeing a duck walking down the street.  You don't know why it's there, but it seems to be doing fine, which is even more puzzling.  This restaurant looks like it was scooped up from Lincoln Park, prices and all, and plopped down in Bridgeport. During a dinner in January of 2012, it still seemed as though they were getting their restaurateur's feet under them.  I ordered a pint of beer and my partner a glass of wine; the server had time to pass our table twice before we got them.  The place wasn't crowed, so it felt like the rhythm of the staff wasn't established yet: a forgivable offense considering the rest of the night. The food was excellent.  I had the wood-smoked pork shoulder with poblano-cheddar grits, bacon-braised greens, and cranberry-jalapeno marmalade.  The pork was tender and flavorful and I fully intended to recreate those poblano-cheddar grits in my own kitchen.  My partner had a crab cake special that she raved about.  In contrast to the drinks, the food came out very quick; about a quarter of a pint's worth of time. As a native from Bridgeport, it's great to see the neighborhood getting businesses like this, but I fear that they aren't catering to the neighborhood's residents.",0.9666,0.825,0.132,0.042,0.5649206349206349

I've eaten the dijon-mustard bacon a few times and it has been both a mouth-watering delicious, out-of-this-world perfect 10, and a merely mouth-watering delicious 9.  I generally dine during the week for brunch -- and when I dine on the weekends, I usually arrive before the brunch rush. I've never had to wait for a table, but have been there as the late brunchers arrive. Our servers have never made us feel rushed during these times -- a consideration not to be ignored when you're at a popular spot like Nana. Favorites include the aforementioned dijon-mustard bacon, Poblano-cheddar grits, the baked Chilaquiles and anything containing duck or pulled pork. They also used to serve up a corn-oat waffle with fresh berries and lemon cream -- it was a welcome change for me, as it was gluten-free, and I am gluten-free. Kind of a match made in heaven. Hopefully they'll serve this again when the seasons change? (fingers crossed).

We had a ton of food because we were slightly hurting from a really fun Friday night...kind of hungover, kind of drunk again...or somewhere in the middle.  I had the breakfast burrito.  It wasnt anything special.  Eggs, chorizo, potatoes, etc...pretty standard.  I also tried the po boy, which was good.  It was high end po boy.  The shrimp was grilled, the oysters fried.  The sauce was good.  Overall, pretty tasty.  I also had a bite of the nanadict.  Again, chorizo and it was pretty good, but not blow my shorts off.  I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy....the biscuits were dense and the gravy didnt have any meat in it....it was just sauce...kind of bland and not at all what I was looking for....boo.

Our server started out fine, seemed a little uncomfortable in her role, but was friendly.  The service problem started after we placed our order and waited.  And waited.  We were relaxed and having fun planning the rest of our day, so we didn't mind the wait.  For a while.  When she started bringing food to larger tables that had been seated after us, I thought I would inquire.  I was met with a nervous ""let me check"".  She returned to say ""it should be up"" and mumbled ""something weird happened in the kitchen.""  She apologized and offered to bring us something else to nibble on in the meantime.  This implied to me that it may be a while yet, so I asked how long she expected it to be.  She replied ""In less than, say, 10 minutes?""  I thought, if she's asking me, we might have a problem. I asked for the manager, and when he arrived, the food was right behind him.  Problem solved, let's eat. The Biscuits and Duck Fat Gravy were satisfying, had to send one of the eggs back for being overcooked, but otherwise enjoyable.   The Huevos Rancheros were good, but not the best I've had.  The black beans were plain, sitting off to the side, and I don't know if I like that the tortilla was deep-fried.  The best component was the poblano cream, which I'm pretty sure Nana could bottle & sell, and without it the Huevos would have been very average.

2011-10-23,4.0,"The husband and I decided to try Nana for a late Friday morning breakfast during a recent Chicago trip. Nanadict : This is Nana's Mexican interpretation of the Eggs Benedict breakfast dish. 2 pupusa-like corn cakes take the place of the traditional English muffin halves to host housemade chorizo sausage crumbles. Each pupusa is then topped with a gently poached egg and covered with a poblano crema sauce. Home fries and a small helping of tossed spring greens complete out this dish. Cherry stuffed french toast : one of their seasonal items, the 2 pieces of egg toast surround the fruity buttercream filling center, which contained dried cherries. The toast was dipped on one side in egg and fried on the flat top griddle, and the completed toast structure topped with dried cherries, fresh huckleberries, slivered almonds and raspberry syrup, with a light dusting of powdered sugar. A side dollop of chocolate whipped cream completes out the dish. It almost felt like we were eating a decadent dessert cake instead of breakfast. Sides : biscuit and duck confit gravy, poblano-cheddar grits and house maple-dijon bacon. The duck confit and fluffy biscuits brings the traditional biscuits and gravy dish to a higher plane. The richness of the duck confit fat creates a large mouth feel to the lumpless poultry gravy, and the hand-rolled/hand-cut square biscuits melt in your mouth. The maple-dijon flavoring on the bacon slices is subtle. The bacon slices were fried a wonderful crispy brown and had an extra sheen and oil feel to them. The hubbie and I were debating whether these had been deep-fried in duck confit or fried under a weight on the flat griddle and basted. Either way, these bacon strips were wonderfully crunchy and crispy, with no chewy/gummy fat portions. The only disappointment was the grits - the cheddar cheese created a slight grainy mouth feel to the creamy grits from the cheese breaking down, and the hubbie didn't like the bits of poblano slivers mixed into the grits. The poblano does provide a nice layer of spicy sweet and I did not mind chewing on the slivers. The hubbie ordered a mocha, and was pleasantly surprised with the usage of Mexican cinnamon in the chocolate addition.

Where do I start?  We woke up this morning and Chicago Magazine had 75 best breakfast places on the cover. We opened it and chose Nana!!!  And I'm glad we did!!! I hate breakfast in a restaurant because I can usually make a better breakfast then most places.  But now I've met my match and bow to Nana.  The chef Guy...his name is really Guy...is an amazing talent.  Everything on the menu is an original idea of an old classic.  So good!!! Our waiter was really good too.  He filled us in on how everything came from local vendors.  I love that.  This is now the second business I've encountered doing this and I love it.  Every restaurant should do this. I was unable to make a choice and the waiter recommended the breakfast sandwich. He also suggested I add  onions and jalapeños to it. I am so glad I did because I think it made my sandwich out of this world. The house made chicken sausage had a nice spice to it.  The English muffin was so good. Also on the sandwich was organic cheddar cheese and an egg.  Crispy home fries and farm greens were on the side.  The House made English Muffin Breakfast Sandwich was so good...I don't know how I'm going to ever order anything else here! My wife had the Huevos Rancheros and she shared a bite with me. They were really good. I will let her review it but I have two words Poblano Cream!!!  Can I get a glass of that or a pitcher and a straw!!! WOW!!! On a side note Guy (not the chef here) from the food network stopped by  Nana's and reviewed this place for Triple D.  After breakfast, the waiter hooked us up with a special screening at the bar.  I've watched this show  a million times but it was the first time the food looked rich and not greasy.  I believe that is what they were going for.  I am sad to say I got hungry again after watching the episode.   I finally have a good breakfast place in Chicago.  Thanks Chicago Magazine for turning me on to this place and to all my fellow Yelpers what are you waiting for?

We took our time combing through the menu, The prices were average for breakfast so I ordered the ""two eggs with biscuit in duck gravy"".  I was glad I chosen the sunny-side eggs because the duck gravy was on the salty side and mixing the yolk up in the gravy made it more enjoyable.

2011-09-30,5.0,"Listen. Shut the hell up and pay attention because someone in this kitchen has lost their mind.  Duck confit gravy over gourmet biscuits? In Bridgeport? Now THAT's what I'm talking about!  There are few huge, cipollini onions and dark greens that sit along with generous shreds of duck meat. Since you're able to pick 2 eggs any style, I opted for sunny side up, which was perfect as the sinful yolk dribbled down the side of the round onions onto the bed of square biscuits suffocated in this sublime gravy with just a faint kiss of caramel. The ingredients in this dish were just made for one another.. the only thing i'd consider is a less ballsy-tasting flour, to take a back seat to the gravy. So before getting there, I knew I was in trouble when I whipped out my Yelp iPhone app to check the menu before arriving and didn't have to read the rest once I saw this dish listed. The only fear I had was that a menu change might have erased it. After shopping at my favorite Unique Thift not too far from the White Sox, I decided to snatch a tasty almond florentine from Impallaria Bakery before eventually finding some local lunch. Though it's one of the best pastries I've had, I should have put that on hold. A couple of years ago we checked out Nana, when they were half the size and was mainly a breakfast spot, in a similar vein as M. Henry in Andersonville.  We're fans of M. Henry but since I now live just a few blocks away from Nana, there's no way I'd hike to the tip of Chicago and wait in line behind 987 people for M.

The first impression is of a clean, open, bright, and airy place - a real oasis on a steamy summer morning. It doesn't have that ""sterile"" feel that some restaurants can have who use this decor. It still feels inviting and welcoming. (Be warned, however, that it is noisy - the brick walls, wood floors, and high ceilings are beautiful, but it can be difficult to hear the others at your table if you're there at the peak of service.) The service was fantastic. It was my first time, so our waiter walked me through a few highlights without feeling like he was trying to up-sell me on anything - they felt like genuine recommendations. I really wanted to try the fried chicken and waffles, but it was out of my budget for the morning, so instead, I got the omelet special (duck confit with rapini, bacon, and parmesan) and my friend got the stuffed french toast. And as I love doing, we split each in half so we could each try something sweet and something savory/salty. Both were so delicious! I could have eaten the whole loaf of the french toast bread (brioch, I think?), and it was so light without skimping on the flavor. You could tell that the berries were fresh because their flavor was so pure, not sugared-up. And the omelet was the perfect portion - once I got past the fact that it wasn't glued together with gobs of cheese like most other omelets, I enjoyed it more than those other kinds - you could taste each element and enjoy it on its own or with the other flavors. I'm not a huge bacon fan, so that flavor was a little overwhelming to me. And since I'm used to those ""other"" breakfast places, the portion of potatoes seemed small at first. But once I finished my breakfast, I didn't have that bogged-down feeling that usually comes.  Which leads me to the best part of this restaurant. The food is fresh, organic, and well-portioned, so you walk out of there feeling really good and ready to start the day. I didn't feel like I needed to roll back into bed, which is normally the case. You will feel energized, healthy, and fulfilled by this meu.  I didn't have a chance to look at the lunch menu at the restaurant, but maybe that's a good thing because I might have been tempted just to stay at my table until lunchtime rolled around. Their menu is available on their website, and now that I've seen it, I can't wait to return. And I'll definitely be taking my husband back to try their house-made chorizo.

The wait staff was pleasant and the small intimate atmosphere was nice to dine in. The menu was small but filled with good organic options.

It was cooked well but nothing I ate (and I tasted some of everyone's dish) made me want to come back for more. My husband and I were in the neighborhood last month and decided to stop for a mid afternoon meal. There were only 2 other couples in the restaurant. We were seated by the hostess who told us in 10 min. they would be serving from the dinner menu. We looked at both menus and decided we like more of the dinner options. When our waitress came over she was very cold and have a very fake attitude towards us. We explained that we may want to wait for dinner and her attitude became more apparent.

I loved that there is local art decorating the walls (interestingly enough, including jewelry) and available for purchase. We sat near the open kitchen where the cooks were as friendly as our server and we felt right at home.  We all had different specialty drinks which were fresh and delicious (sangria, margarita, mojito). We shared two appetizers (veggies with green garlic fondue and queso fundido), both of which were very tasty, but the fresh veggies and fondue (with a side of zesty guacamole) stole the show.  Our entrees included the soft shell crab (YUM), pork shoulder, torta and quesadillas. All were unique, large and hearty, though not overly-rich. The quality of the ingredients was exceptional.

Okay, Nana had great presentation for the food. However, didn't care for the fried chicken, I did like their mac n cheese, and I liked their desserts. I only tried one of their desserts, which was the chiffon cake with Crème anglaise which was very yummy. And total cost per meal was about $22, without tax and tip, which is a good value for a Sunday dinner party.  I  took a looked at the rest of their menu, wow they do have some expensive menu items. I felt that were priced fairly for some of  the items, but for the area it is in, maybe not so much. I know Bridgeport is still up and coming but it is very expensive. And a lot of customers with big pocket books can afford this fine eating establishment, but I don't plan on eating that too often because it will burn a whole in my wallet.

We started off with an appetizer of asparagus.  It had white and green asparagus, a duck egg and cornbread.  The egg was cooked perfectly.  And the yolk was not too runny and made a fantastic dipping sauce for the asparagus and cornbread.  I told the waitress I would have licked the plate if no one was watching. For dinner I had the smoked pork shoulder with poblano cheddar grits and greens.  The pork was so tender and juicy.  It had that elusive pink smoke ring inside and just a great smoky flavor without being overwhelming.  The greens were outstanding too.  I'm not a big greens fan, but this side dish had some smokiness, again not overpowering, and was well-seasoned. For dessert we had the blueberry tart with huckleberry sauce.  This was a pleasant wrap up to such a fantastic meal. I also highly recommend the kumquat sangria.  It was fruity but not too sweet. Service tends to be a little off here, in my opinion.  It took about 10 or 15 minutes after seating for our waitress to come by to take our order.  I gauge the service latency by the amount of time it took me to make a choice, as I am one of those people who likes to analyze the menu.  If I have my order ready by the time the waitperson has arrived, I know service is slow.  Having said that, once we placed our order service did flow well.",0.9912,0.823,0.148,0.028,0.5340833333333334

Next my amigo enjoyed a gorgeous-looking soft shell crab, and I indulged in blue corn house 'quesadillas' with house made ricotta with huitacoche & wild mushroom which were more like some sort of masa variation.  YUM!!  I was already full, but I ate almost the whole dish....underneath was a bed of more delicious seasonal vegetables:  fiddlehead ferns, favas, fennel...  Did I mention we ordered the onion rings?  Yep - we over indulged.  Huge fat plate.  It was a little much...but....delish, of course. I sent my espresso back after dinner (the machine hadn't been used all day), but the second our server pulled was con panna (whipped cream) and completely delicious.  So was the sauce of the nightly dessert, which included some sort of berries infused with rosemary....there was more whipped cream & a fluffy textured baked thing.  Dio mio.

2011-05-04,5.0,"If you don't live in the Bridgeport neighborhood, it's worth the trip to visit Nana. We found the food to be delicious and the restaurant's commitment to sourcing humanely-raised items to be exceptional.  We appreciate that the farms and brands are prominently listed on the menu and website.  Nana uses chicken and pork from Gunthorp Farms.  The free-range birds spend a lot of their lives outside as they are pastured at three weeks of age. The pigs are raised ""farrow to finish"" on pasture without animal by-products in their feed. They are raised free of confinement in crates.  The quality and taste of the pork in the Carnitas Burrito Platter we tasted was phenomenal!   Nana currently uses Eggsland's Best Organic eggs, which means that the hens are not in cages and are fed organic feed. However, in a recent report published by the Cornucopia Institute, Eggsland's Best is docked points for not providing adequate access to pasture for their birds (see  cornucopia.org/organic-e… ). Nana sources its beef from Heartland Meats and Dietzler Farms.  Neither of these farms uses synthetic hormones and Dietzler Farms never uses antibiotics (unless a cow is sick).  Dairy and cheese products come from Capriole, Cedar Grove, Farmers' Creamery, Hook's Cheese, Saxon Homestead Creamery and Sassy Cow Creamery.  Cream of the crop is Sassy Cow, which is a family-run organic operation based out of Columbus, WI.   The cows eat a considerable part of their diet from grass on the organic pastures located on this farm.   The Cornucopia Institute gave Sassy Cow an ""outstanding"" rating for organic dairy operations ( cornucopia.org/dairysurv… ). Room for improvement?  Consider sourcing beef products that are completely grass-fed and grass-finished to protect cattle health and improve nutritional value. Purchase eggs from hens that have meaningful and adequate access to the outdoors. The Humane Choice is a project of Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT). This restaurant was reviewed by FACT staff members Larissa McKenna and Lisa Isenhart.  FACT is a Chicago-based non-profit organization dedicated to improving the way animals are raised on farms.  For more information on our work and mission, please visit  foodanimalconcerns.org .",0.9919,0.864,0.127,0.009,0.4826190476190475

Cold vegetables aren't something I brag to anyone about. The mac & cheese tasted like mac & truffles.

Nana's sticks so much to its menu of organic, seasonal ingredients, that they don't even have Diet Coke because it's not organic! :)     While I have tried so many things off the menu through the years, my absolute favorite order is the soy chorizo and mushroom torta that is slightly reminiscent of a spicy sloppy joe with a side order of the mashed acorn squash. The acorn squash is sweet with a bit of spiciness. Sometimes I'm tempted just to go to Nana's to get a side of acorn squash to go and nothing else! I love my acorn squash, sooo much, that when my friend and I split the torta the other day, I made her order her own side. No sharing of mashed squash for me!    My other favorites are their rotating menu of bread-like items at dessert. The pumpkin beignets last fall were ABSOLUTELY orgasmic, and the corn bread when it appears is also very tasty.     I am also a die-hard fan of the desserts at Nanas. I once went in for dinner by myself and shamelessly ate the entire cookie plate by myself! My top two favorite desserts I've ever had at Nana's, though, are the chocolate mousse bacon cake and the homemade funnel cake. The funnel cake is currently on the dessert menu. Chef Guy said he used some sort of ginger pancake batter. At any rate, it was a delicately towered homemade funnel cake that was fried on the outside by melt-on-your tongue light inside! It was swathed in a pool of custard, fresh raspberries, and raspberry sauce. The best touch was the sidecar of champagne that accompanied it!     The very best part of Nana's is the great service.

Although you can see the Latin influence in the menu, it is definitely not a Mexican restaurant.  One breakfast example is biscuits with duck confit gravy -- yum!  I love their unique chiliquilas, with an absolutely delicious sauce that I can't quite identify.

The restaurant itself was clean and modern.  Was a bit surprised when I walked it because I didn't expect that considering the look of its surroundings in Bridgeport. The first thing I noticed is that they serve Metropolis Coffee which is out of Chicago.  Being organic was already good for me but it made it even better seeing that they also support local products. The menu was quite simple.  There weren't too many dishes to choose from.  My friend recommended the ""Nanadict"" which is their take on the Eggs Benedict.  The chorizo, egg, and the sauce came together really well for me.  It was served with a side of really crisp and creamy potatoes and a mound of fresh greens mixed with some vinaigrette dressing. One of the specials that day was their version of Chicken and Waffles.  After our waitress described it, my friend was immediately sold.  The crispy and savory chicken strips complemented the waffle and gravy really well.  I think the gravy is what made the dish so good!  It definitely was not your traditional sausage gravy.

I really like their decor, their dining room arranged to be sch a nice homely environment , with big windows and lot of sunlights ,it gives you a morning boost right the way .

Sunshine up eggs and toast  -- nothing special , but I like their mixed berries jam !

Nana is now serving dinner that is totally out of this world.  Their seasonal menu can't be beat!  I can honestly say that some of the best meals I've ever had have come out of this kitchen.  I had a pork shoulder with grits and greens that made me weep a little because it was just THAT beautiful and amazing.   They are currently doing fried chicken dinners on Sundays for $22 a person that is worth every penny.  I went with one other person and we got deviled eggs for a starter, biscuits, brussel sprouts, jalapeno coleslaw, mac and cheese, chicken and a full size dessert each.  We had so much food that I had dinner for the two nights following. They also now have a liquor license and a bar menu and the drinks are pretty great.  I've had quite a few ""breakfast drinks"" and they've all been great.   *For anyone who was used to BYOB here be careful because the corkage fee now that they have a bar menu is $25 a bottle except for on Wednesdays when it's free.",0.9847,0.795,0.175,0.03,0.600378787878788

But we were caught up in conversation, so time passed. Now...on to the food. We began the meal with the Hand-cut Nichols Farm & Orchard potato chips and the Queso Fundido. The potato chips were, well, potato chips. But they were burnt. So, yeah. The Queso Fundido a tortilla dish with a cheese, chorizo, and roasted peppers. Had the cheese been a little more melted, it would have been a good appetizer. At this point in the meal, I was a little hesitant on the entrees. I ordered the Classic Nana Burger and my girlfriend ordered a larger portion of the appetizer creamy macaroni and cheese.

The three entrees I had this time were a fresh peach salad, some crispy vegetable tempura with spicy aioli, and their cheeseburger with a fried egg and bacon. All three were unique, well plated, and very tasty. So, as you can see I've been to one restaurant and had two distinctly different experiences. I'll definitely come back a third time to try to see what comes of it but it'll have to wait. Their prices keep me from trying them out on a regular basis. Especially if I don't know for certain what side of the Nana coin will show its face.",0.9236,0.893,0.085,0.022,0.5407378335949764

For a veggie, they don't have the most options, but the several that they do have is amazing. I had the wild mushroom crepes and it was delish!!! My cousin and I also had the watermelon salad. The goat cheese was never a favorite, but aside from that, it was pretty good. We also had some fries, which was amazing. I could definitely taste the major difference. We also had table bar desserts, which was also very good considering it wasn't very sweet, which is something we take into consideration. I'm not big on sweets.

Nana had just started serving dinner, and was a tiny bit off their game as they ramp up. Someone forgot to flip the window sign from closed to open, which sent a bit of a ""ok, now where to eat"" scare into us. They were out of lemonade, and hadn't printed new menus to reflect a change in one of the seasonal entrees. That aside, the service was pleasant and food good. I had the fig Caprese salad for starters (fantastic) from the standard side of the menu, and a perch entree (slightly too salty) from the seasonal dinner menu. For dessert, we did the table service of little bites. Good, but I think I'd pefer a single dessert of one thing next time. What I like is that this restaurant would be ostentatious in a gentrified north side neighborhood, but came off relaxed and hip somehow in Bridgeport.  The interior space is beautiful, lofty and clean lines.

I was quite pleased with my meal, although the server didn't bring me any butter for my unbuttered toast and I had to ask for jam.  My friend was quite displeased with his experience, however.  When he ordered the burger, the server asked him if he wanted an egg on his burger.  He said no but when his burger was delivered it had an egg on it.  When he flagged down the server, she took the plate back to the kitchen to remove the egg but then the burger came back with most of the cheese gone too.  After all of this my friend did enjoy his burger and added it was one of the better burgers he had eaten. The food was great!  I'm really interested to try dinner sometime because the menu looked delicious.  I'm not completely turned off by the poor service but they really need to work on it!   I don't want an aloof hipster who acts too cool to serve me; I want a friendly and attentive server who acts happy to be there.  If it's so painful, get a different job!

Not only was the place beautiful, but the staff was super friendly and helpful. The first time my boyfriend and I went to Nana's we had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Omar, and he explained to us the concept of Nana's, and I think that it's amazing what he has done for this community.  But what about the food? My boyfriend and I consistently visit Nana's (at least once a week) after our first taste. I have to say, I've only ordered off the regular menu twice. After not ordering their special once, and not being able to order it the next week... I will never make that mistake again!  Not only is their food delicious, it looks amazing, and it is so affordable for Gourmet Organic food! I'm a huge foodie myself, and I have easily paid $50 - $70 plates of food that didn't taste as good. My advice is, go for the specials if there is one. It will be the best decision you ever made! Also, go for DINNER! Their breakfast/lunch menu is great, but OMG their dinner specials are simply orgasmic!

2010-06-14,5.0,"Well, we had been kind of ignoring Nana after our initial breakfast visit. They seemed to have quite enough business without us, thank you, and we didn't really want to be rubbing too many elbows with culinary feebles unable to fry their own eggs and make their own toast - please. That whole family breakfast thing is not really our bag anyway. Having talked with the owners we understood their cautious approach business plan and have been jaunting off to Amelia's further down Halsted for our ""real food"" fixes, meanwhile hoping that Nana would someday offer evening dining and dare we hope alcohol. However, you read it here: there's been a sea change in the neighborhood zeitgeist. Walking by Saturday we noted their new staff of black-dressed experts all suited up and ready for dinner service. The place was still basically empty at that time, so we said ""what the heck,"" went home and gussied up, returning with our French friend Corbieres. Greetings were gracious rather than breakfast-distant and we were soon perusing the menu, which is half lunch-type items and half dinner stuff. Too many good-sounding things to decide quickly, but we ended up with the quail, the skirt steak, and the asparagus salad. Yes, it all worked out. The servings were generous. The asparagus was perfectly blanched, with a nice mayonnaise sauce. The quails were spiced with sort of a tandoori treatment (which you wouldn't figure from the menu description) before frying, and satisfyingly voluptuous and tender. The skirt steak was well saturated with chimichurri and buttery in texture, very nice. Presentations were stacked, adding to the professionalness and sense of wonder. We even had an OK chocolate mousse with huckleberries for dessert. Nana doesn't give you extra stuff like bread, free salads, etc. with dinner, taking a cost-control cue I guess from Nightwood down the road (although the quantities are as noted impressively ample by contrast). However, culinarily, latin influences aside, this food could be described as Nightwood with balls; the seasoning and richness are not timid but suffuse with a home-cookin' confidence. So in summation, just like that we have become stakeholders in Nana's dinner service, and so accordingly toast a hearty welcome to the first real restaurant in Bridgeport!

Dinner - Fried quail? I'll bite - out comes 2 of em fried on top of biscuits and green beans and gravy.  Crispy, slightly spicy and (besides the wings/legs, deboned - just pick up and chow down), medium in the middle and succulent as all get out.  Asked the chef about it and he said the quail take a swim in buttermilk and his spice blend for a while before being fried.  Others had the pork shoulder (juicy and yummy), the kobe burger, turkey club, soft shell crab sandwich.  Everyone loved what they got and we all sampled each other's.   Dessert - Mousse - super chocolatey and with some sort of berry.  Strawberry shortcake-ish kind of thing - I hate strawberries as a rule but could have eaten the whole thing myself.  Various cookies, rhubarb crepes.... and for the love of all things unholy WHISKEY BACON CHOCOLATE BARS!  Good-freakin-night.

Everything was tasty and hot, although food could have been spicier. It was almost like they toned things down for the crowd. The scones were amazing. Not really scones but more like sweet biscuits, they served 6 of them with a dee-licious lemon sauce. They looked so great, the tables on either side of us ordered them as well. The omelet was average, but the ingredients weren't spread evenly and mixed well. Not sure what other waiter problems people have seemed to have here, but ours was attentive and sweet. Also, the prices are not out of line for the food they serve here. This is not a southside greasy diner, it's a restaurant. The prices are very much in line with other similar brunch places up north.

The not-so-good: Food is terribly bland and WICKEDLY overpriced.  My son ordered the child's pancake.  It was ONE pancake the size of a CD and cost $5!  That's crazy.  And the kicker?  The high price was JUST for the pancake - no kid's drink was included like every other restaurant in the city.  In this economy, $2.25 for a small glass of milk and $3 for one coffee just doesn't cut it.   There is nothing impressive about the food. I had the home skillet were the eggs where dried out and the potatoes cold and mushy.  Very, very small portion. While our waiter was very friendly and pleasant, we had to flag him down on a number of occasions for simple things - jam for our toast, the bill, etc.  Minor annoyance. I don't think there are a lot of other brunch places in Bridgeport, so that might bode well for Nana's.  However, with SO MANY other awesome brunch places in the city - with a good concentration in the South & West Loop, as well as Little Italy & UIC, it's safe to say we'll never be back.",0.9744,0.739,0.185,0.075,0.5922191697191698

The first time I was there it was soon after they had just opened, on a Sunday and it was packed!!!  The service was friendly but a bit slow, not a big deal since I could see how busy they were. The coffee was delicious and so were the chilaquiles (serving was a bit on the small side for the price). I don't remember what my friend ordered but she said it was yummy. So all in all a pleasant experience! During my second visit (about 2 months ago), again on a Sunday, again it was packed but this time the service was a.... aloof. The coffee was still wonderful but I had to flag a server down. I wasn't really sure who to flag down, my aloof waiter or one of the several people just standing around talking to each other.  This time I got the Chef's skillet. There is absolutely nothing skillet about this ""skillet"". It's a plate in the form of a skillet whereupon food is placed.  The food that was placed on the skillet shaped plate was fine but this is definitely NOT a skillet. My friend ordered the ""skillet"" too and shares my opinion. Not satisfied! My third visit was this past Friday morning, busy but not packed. I sat myself down as was stated on the sign and was immediately presented with a glass of water and offered that delicious coffee by a bus-boy.  I had a question about the menu and waited and waited and waited.....a long time! During this time a dark-haired- waitress walked past my table about 10 times. The owner(s) walked in and the dark-haired waitress chatted with them for a while. The owners then began a conversation with a table of women right next to me (who were receiving excellent service).  In the meantime there was a blond-haired woman standing about 3 yards from my table... she was just standing and smiling at people as they walked by! Finally the dark-haired waitress came over and answered my question (no oatmeal) and took my order. The veggie omelet was very good and the homemade jam is scrumptious ....BTW had to ask for jam.  Very satisfied with the food, completely dissatisfied with the service!!! Would I go back?

I discovered this place when a friend scheduled a breakfast date for a small group of us on a Monday morning.  When I arrived there was a few other folks there and no wait--we even hung around chatting after our meal was complete--something we probably would not have done if there was a wait for a table.  I ordered a short stack of buttermilk pancakes and a soy latte.  The waitress arrived to the table grumbling that they got the espresso drinks confused and my latte had a shot of vanilla, she placed the steaming cup in front of me and asked me if I really wanted her to change it.  I felt this is not a question to be imposed on a paying customer--she really left me with little option--and had it not been for the exceptional pancakes with real butter and maple syrup I might have never returned.  My friend also filled me in on the restaurant's background: family owned and organic--another reason I decided to return--giving the staff another chance--because overall our waitress could have been much friendlier.  I returned on Valentine's Day to treat my husband to a nice organic breakfast.  This time the place was full.  It was a little hard to find the hostess--if you're new to this place, look for her behind the coffee bar-- when we found her she warned us it was a twenty minute wait--something we had anticipated.  However, it  was kind of hard to figure out where to wait, there really isn't a place and we kept dodging out of the way of busy servers.  Eventually the hostess pointed us to some free seats at the coffee bar where we could sit and wait to be seated.  We did turn down the first table she offered us because it was right by the front door where a crowd of folks waiting to be seated was standing--too awkward for me.  Minutes later she seated us at another table.  I ordered the stuffed french toast and a side of bacon and my husband got the salmon scrambled eggs and a pancake on the side--we both had regular coffee.  We requested soy for our coffee and our waiter didn't seem to mind when we requested extra but we quickly discovered that their coffee is pretty good black and they refilled our cups often.  Our meal was scrumptious--everything was tasty and fresh.  A complete side-note, the music was a bonus treat: The Cure, Erasure, Prince and George Micheal!  Ultimately, it was two servers taking care of us during our meal--the name on our receipt said ""Omarcito""--and he/they more than made up for all the shortcomings of the server from my last visit who seem to have gotten the day off.    We will definitely return but I am docking one star because the hostess situation can improve.  She can move towards the front where its easier to find her and when a table becomes available I would recommend she walk-up to her waiting customers as opposed to screaming for them over folks sitting at the coffee bar (some even eating there).  The place was well staffed and everyone was hustling but it seemed that she was the only one with a case of frazzled nerves, which I think is unfortunate, since I suspect that might be Nana herself--she's got a great product and its okay if we gotta wait a little longer for it on Sunday mornings.",0.9911,0.86,0.1,0.041,0.4884945494320494

I met a friend for brunch on a recent Sunday. All the tables were full so we were directed to sit at the coffee bar to wait. No sooner than we had gotten our espresso's we were seated at a cute two top in front of window doors that I am sure are thrown open to the street in better weather.  A minute on the ambiance. The clean whites of this place make you feel happy the moment you push open the door. The enticing smell of coffee and the buzz of people enjoying their meals are just a prelude to what you will experience.  The server came over and welcomed us asking us if we were from the neighborhood (I was not but my friend was). He then took the time to explain the menu and to make a couple of suggestions.  I went with his suggestion of the Nana's baked chilaquiles. Having no idea what this was- it turned out to something like a piece of Mexican ""lasagna"" with layers of tortillas and cheese with poblano cream sauce. Served with two scrambled eggs and beans- this was a delicious dish! My coffee cup was never empty and we were genuinely encouraged to stop back in another time.  The only thing that would have made this more perfect would have been a Bloody Mary to go along with my breakfast. Nana does not have a liquor license so if you want a drink- you'll have to go to Bernice's across the street (and they make a darn good one!)

2009-11-04,3.0,"Went and check this place out yesterday, Tuesday, mid-morning after it came highly recommended from two reliable sources.  I must say they didn't do anything bad but I can't really say they did anything great either. I don't know if you want to take that as a backhanded compliment or a warning. I actually really struggled with my start allocation and settled on 3 because they are sort of new and in the hopes they improve.  They did have great coffee and unique sweetener options, which I know for some people would allow them to over look some other sub-par elements. The breakfast menu seemed to contain some old standbys and contemporary fusion takes on traditional Mexican dishes. Didn't really look over the lunch options.  We settled on Huevos Rancheros & Nanadict eggs.  The Rancheros was with a Verde sauce and black beans. It was extremely salty and I thought poorer quality and more expensive then a more traditional spot a few blocks up. I found it sort of strange that a place that serves Mexican dishes didn't have a spicy salsa to offer. The salsa roja that was brought upon request was o.k. but for people that enjoy spicy it was lacking.  We had a little bit better result with the Nanadict. Sort of a Mexican version of Eggs Benedict sans the Holidaise(See Picture). It seemed to come with the same Verde sauce but wasn't nearly as salty as the Rancheros, which is weird because it had chirizo on it. The chirizo is homemade and flavorful. The corn buns the dish came on were a bit dry and tough, not sure if that is by design or not. Would have been better if they were either a bit more fresh or softer. I got black beans instead of home-fries and I liked the beans although they seemed to be a bit over seasoned with salt as well.  Our waitress was extremely overwhelmed and that lead to some deficiencies in service. I counted about 7 or 8 tables she had going and that is at least 2 or 3 more then she should be required to handle, even with a buser/food runner.  I think people who are hard pressed to find organic and vegan options would really enjoy this place. Not sure if it was the manager or owner walking around but he was extremely friendly and nice as was all the staff.

2009-10-20,4.0,"Living about 3 blocks east of nana, I was eager to give this restaurant my business once their sign popped up mid-winter at the corner of 33rd & halsted. I'll plead guilty to judging almost every book by it's cover (or title), and say that i was happy to see a somewhat sophisticated restaurant popping up in the land of quick yumyums that is bridgeport. Then it opened in late summer, and I read many yelp reviews which were critical of the restaurant. I've been a fan of Aaron S's reviews for some time, and I've almost always found his reviews to be accurate. Seeing him criticize this restaurant I've looked forward to for so long kinda discouraged me from giving the place a shot. So, I decided to hold off on the place until I started seeing better reviews. Skip ahead some number of days, weeks, maybe months, and a coworker / fellow bridgeportian proclaimed to me that his breakfast with his girlfriend at nana was some of the best food he's ever had in bridgeport. We've had similar tastes in food in the past, with our hatred for happiness @33rd & halsted being the same, and with our enjoyment of Bridgeport Restaurant being similar as well. I'm not sure if he's followed through with my recommendation of ramova grill yet, but I decided to give nana a go based on his recommendation. I arrived at about 2:30pm on a Tuesday afternoon. I looked a tad homeless, wearing bluejeans, an enlarged blue hoody, a green shirt underneath that, and a knit hat over my head. Surprisingly, I wasn't asked to leave the moment I entered, and was instead greeted by a very nice fellow who holds a stellar likeness to Kevin Smith.  I was seated, ordered my standard coffee, and looked over the menu. My first choice was a vegetarian hamburger they offer. However, they were out of that. So, I went over their breakfast menu, and found that they also offer a tofu scramble. Having recently fell in love with tofu thanks to Jim Ching's preperation of Curry Tofu, I took a dive for that. The food took maybe 8 minutes to cook, and came out looking fucking worthy of marriage. I haven't ever been fond of scrambled anything, especially eggs, and I haven't even been attempting veganism for very long. I guess something happened to me as a child, and I got some scrambled eggs forced into my mouth by my asshole dad or something. Since then, I can't stand eggs alone, or in any sort of dish where they are used as the primary ingredient. Especially omelets. However, this dish changed my mind, and I now have an acceptance of scrambled tofu resting comfortably in my mind. Every god damn part of this dish was well prepared. Every bite was heavenly, magical, and, it was all just perfect. Aside from the stuffed french toast I once had at cafe meli, and maybe the first time I ever had cinnamon toast crunch, this is the best breakfast food I've ever had. After finishing brunch, I ordered this pumpkin bread that was drowning in some sort of banana sauce, with whipped cream. Every bite was delicious, and I regret not taking any photos. Service was excellent as well. Very nice people, several coffee refills, several satisfaction update requests, quick bill payment once I was ready to get out, and the whole bill was dirt cheap too. $14.95 for a huge ass tofu scramble, that giant mound of elegantly prepared pumpkin bread, and maybe like 3 or 4 cups of coffee.

For example, he had no burgers yesterday, because the supplier couldn't supply him! Omar said people were getting angry at him, but he is a vegetarian and believes in Nana's mission to serve organic food. He was not about to go to Jewel and grab beef on sale, just to have hamburgers. He's a believer. He also told us they've been open only for a month, and he's already got plans to expand. Bridgeport, you are lucky. This is an excellent place, and you should go there now, whether or not red meat is on the menu.",0.9738,0.817,0.154,0.029,0.7317948717948718
2009-09-23,4.0,"It takes quite a bit to impress me and from reading the reviews I was ready to be disappointed.  I have been to other restaurants rated well by fellow yelpers and have been disappointed in the past.  Nana's is really a bit of fresh air and a sophisicated restaurant in an unexpected location.  I am a Bridgeport transplant (came screaming and kicking in stillettos no less from the Gold Coast) where i was used to excellent brunch/lunch spots at my door.  We were really impressed with the ambiance, warm and bright with a hint of urban savvy. It is a open kitchen concept (reminds me of Bongo Room) and a coffee bar located in the middle of the restaurant which prepares it's fresh fruit juices.   We visited midweek  so we were seated right away and offered coffee on ther spot.  The menu has the usual eggs, pancakes, waffles, skillets etc made with fresh organic veggies.  I judge every brunch spot by their coffee and pancakes, you'd be surprised to know how easy it is to get it wrong.  THIS WAS SPOT ON!  Coffee was smooth and not overly acidic and brewed just right, we ordered Jeremy's Special, it is a skillet of potatoes with Monterray Jack, bacon and two over easy eggs with salsa roja. The dish arrived loaded with chunks of potatoes that were crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside, the bacon was flavorful and easily cut with a fork, just the right amount of cheese, and the eggs were still runny in the center.  My sister has the Strawberry Wheat Pancakes, light and fluffy, Nana's makes it's own strawberry/topping preserves which was not overly sugary or thick.  I thought it was a smart alternative to pancakes with just fresh strawberries on top becuase it eliminates the need for additonal syrup/sugar on the pancakes!  Ok now for the nitty gritty-this is a really nice place to have brunch, portions are just right for one person and I think going with the organic theme you're not going to find food smothered in cheese and butter here. Everthing is definately fresh which may account for their prices. I think bruch entrees are priced from $8-$12. A little on the pricy side but hey this is Bridgeport and least you save with free  and easy street parking!!",0.9852,0.84,0.128,0.031,0.561144883485309
2009-09-22,5.0,"After hearing lots of good things about this place I decided to go check it out last Saturday.  I went early (9:30ish) to avoid the brunch rush that some people have complained about.  I didn't have any issues.  The place was half full.  I took a  seat at the small counter area, order a cup of coffee (beans from Metropolis Coffee Co) and the nanadict.  A successful play on eggs benedict with papusas filling in for the english muffin and house made chorizo for the canadian bacon.  Great flavors and definitely plenty of food.  My only criticism was with the papusa.  In my opinion, it was a little over cooked.  Typically papusas are more tamale like in texture; they're soft and can be cut with the side of a fork.  These were cooked until crispy on the outside.  While it was tasty and texturally a good compliment to the poached egg, I still would have preferred a more traditional, softer consistency.   One thing I learned at Nana's is that they offer ""soy-rizo"" as a substitute for the chorizo if you're pork adverse.  As horrifying of a though of not eating delicious, delicious pork again, I know it's not for everyone.  One of the owners was kind enough to bring me out a little to try.  Honestly, I was shocked how good it was.  If they had put that on my plate I would not have been able to tell it was regular chorizo.  It didn't have that spongy texture some faux-ground meat products have, plus it was seasoned perfectly.   I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to Brideport and another delicious meal at Nana's!",0.9383,0.773,0.136,0.091,0.5395787545787546

2009-09-17,5.0,"This spot near Sox park really hits a home run with their food. I completely understand some of the skepticism people have about this new breakfast / lunch spot in the heart of Bridgeport, I really do.  However I think some people are too quick to judge and dismiss it. I just dined at Nana for the SECOND time this weekend.  Me and my wife came to Nana the first time on a busy weekend for brunch right after they had first opened and had the experience of waiting quite a while for a table and for our food. *****IMPORTANT TO NOTE***** Being in the service industry myself I understand the inner workings of a restaurant and one thing I must point out is that when we were there I observed that the Micros? (computerized order system that sends the customer orders to the kitchen) was completely not functioning. The servers had to input orders then reprint them at a different computer and manually hand them to the cooks. Being a server myself I can only say that THIS WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE FOR ANY KITCHEN!!!  Situations like this can bring even the best kitchen staff to a dead stop. Yes, the food that day was sub-par and somewhat inconsistent, but considering they had a restaurant full of hungry brunchers, I think it's pretty amazing that they were able to function at all under the circumstances. Because of the situation with their Micros system that day me and the wife decided to give the place another chance and came out for brunch last weekend on Sep. 13. I am sooooooo glad we did. So happy was I with everything on Sunday that I decided to completely overlook the first experience. I mean, heck, they are brand new and still ironing out the kinks of a brand new concept right? So we decided to give it another shot. THE FOOD was absolutely amazing. My wife had a rendition of huevos rancheros that I must say is probably one of the best in the city. Nice crispy tortillas topped with perfectly seasoned black beans (which I much prefer to the stewed pintos they do at Orange), then a mixture of bell peppers and onions with melted cheese that oozed out into the black beans when we started to eat it. They topped it with the over easy eggs (which were still runny just as they should be) then some mildly spicy green salsa and a huge portion of sliced avocados on top. (must have been near half an avocado, which I'm sure do not come cheap organically). I would definitely recommend this plate to anyone. It was a veritable tower of huevos rancheros, not the bland, flat plate of beans and tortillas I'm used to having at most of the places I frequent on the north side. For my plate I chose a burger. Though I am a huge fan of brunch, I am an early riser and usually only prefer breakfast fare quite early in the morning so it was nice to see that they had sandwiches available. (We arrived around 11.) Call me a hippy but I chose the Magic Mushroom burger mostly because of the name, not really expecting much. Damn was I surprised when they arrived with a burger that was nearly twice as tall as it was wide. 100% grass fed certified organic burgers raised somewhere in Wisconsin I'm told, and the beef had a really phenomenal flavor. The burger came on a very tasty bun that the sever told us came from Red Hen Organic Bakery and was slathered in roasted garlic mayo....... so good..... call me a mayo freak but I love the stuff and knew this as homemade right away when I tasted l little extra virgin olive oil in the mayo mix, and the garlic flavor was spot on. The burger itself had a load of sauteed mushrooms on top held in place by a shield of melted cheese. Can't tell you exactly what they use in their mushroom mix, but if I was Nana, I wouldn't want to let that secret out either, the flavor was just unreal. Maybe a little balsamic or something??? The icing on the metaphorical cake - the burger had a heaping helping of deep fried onions ON TOP of the massive pile of mushrooms and cheese. Served with a pickle and home-made (deliciously crispy) french fries, this burger is truly an intimidating sight when you see it heading toward your table. The server picked it up from the open kitchen window and I thought, ""damn, I hope that's us..."" then as they dropped it off at our table as I accidentally, audibly uttered a ""hell yeah..."" One of the best burgers I have had all summer. The onions could've used a little bit more salt but as a smoker maybe my taste buds are a little weaker than the norm. I was 110% satisfied. THE DECOR - My wife always rates a place partially based on their bathrooms. She said they were beautifully tiled, looked like they actually built the stalls themselves (out of wood!) and her only complaint in that regard was that the trash cans were too small.  They seem to have picked up where they dropped the ball and IMPROVED EVERYTHING!!!  Ignore the 2 negative reviews on here and definitely give the place a shot.

Once we were seated, our waiter jumped on us almost instantly and gave us his full attention.

I had the Nanadict, my girlfriend the All-American Breakfast, and my friend had the Huevos Rancheros. Everyone reported that the food well-cooked and tasted great.

2009-09-10,4.0,"I'm not trying to be rude here...but scan the negative reviews here and look for two things: 1) slow service or  2) disappointment in price or portion size. Ignore any reviews containing either.  Not only was the service respectful, quick, and everything I could have asked for (frequent without being pushy, personal and personable, etc) but this restaurant JUST opened a few weeks ago and they're still working out the kinks.  Expecting them to work perfectly right out of the box is unreasonable and if you expect perfect service, wait a little while longer to let the gears get greasy, or show up a little earlier in the day when they are less busy. As for the price/portion size: you are not going to Denny's or IHOP here.  You are going to a beautiful, friendly place that serves delicious local, organic foods.  Yes, those foods are more expensive, but organic also means less chemicals that are unhealthy and bad for you, and local means you're supporting not only the environment but also your neighbors (albeit some of them a little far flung).  And the portion sizes are perfectly reasonable: filling without feeling bloated and stuffed, delicious without being overly seasoned. I had a wonderful time at Nana and plan to make it something of a Sunday tradition from now on.  I think the problem is that some people walk in expecting a ""traditional"" diner-style brunch.  If you aren't concerned with organic or natural foods, this is probably not the best brunch place for you, but I agree with what some of the other reviewers have been saying: this is a great addition to Bridgeport, and I really want to see it succeed.",0.994,0.712,0.208,0.08,0.5270905923344946

When asking the owner for anything, he ignored our request and tried to pawn it off on the server(please note all the owners/managers hardly knew how to serve and paid no attention to anything in the room other than wondering around)...she then dropped the ball on it anyhow. Amazing that you have more than enough hired hands to do things for your guests, and no one is managing them to do what they are supposed to....SERVE!

2009-09-06,2.0,"I had no expectations about what Aaron S. and I's brunch here would be like, and yet I was still very disappointed.  I kind of expected a wait, I know brunch places are insane on the weekends, so that was no big deal. What sucked is once we got inside everything just got slower and slower. It was also very cramped and chaotic inside, not my style at all when dining out. They were just not organized at all.  We were seated and given a menu, and the person who seated us was gone in a blink of an eye.  Then we sat. And sat some more. It really seemed like eons before the waitress came and asked what we were having. Aaron started off with an apple juice and I with coffee (of course). I saw in keeping with the organic theme here that they only offered sugar in the raw and ""Stevia Balance"" for coffee sweetening. I tried the Stevia because I usually put splenda in my coffee, YECH. It made my coffee taste horrid. Why are they torturing me with that crap?  I ordered the Jeremy skillet. Aaron went with the farmers omelet. We waited, and waited. A bus boy who really was sorta creepy came by a couple of times to look at the table to see if things needed refilling, not one of the many staff that were in there asked if we needed anything, nor notice that my coffee was empty. I was getting peeved and I am sure that if you had looked close enough steam would be coming from my ears. Finally when our food was brought out, It wasn't the waitress. The guy just sat the food down and went to walk away. I snapped ""Can I have some more coffee?"" He should have asked if anything was needed before walking away.  Tiny tiny portions. Aaron lipped to me ""And this is worth nine bucks?"" I just nodded. Also um toast? Where the hell is the toast? Skillets, omelets and most egg dishes, should come with toast. Sometimes pancakes. I noticed that the salsa that was on top of my skillet was a pink color. Pink? Did you not use ripe tomatoes? Also there was ONE count em ONE lonely egg on my skillet. Boo. Also nothing was seasoned. (Nor cooked in butter). Hell there was not even enough cheese in my skillet to taste it. Any cook that works at a restaurant SHOULD know that potatoes should be salted while being cooked so that they actually taste like potatoes (the reason why you taste food in the first place is salt).  The only good things I do have the say is that it was well prepped and the bacon was super yummy. The potatoes while tasting bland, were cooked right. Nice and soft in the middle and crunchy outside. The ONE egg (grrrrrr I am a biker I need my fucking protein thank you very much) was also cooked to a perfect over easy. It is seriously sad that those three things are the only good things I can say.  I'm really sad that there is a freaking brunch place in my own neighborhood that I really don't see returning to. Maybe in the future to see if they have gotten any better.  I have never been big on organics, any experience I have had with anything with the organic label on it has been a huge let down, and this just is being added to that pile of let downs.

2009-09-06,2.0,"Brunch: n.  A meal typically eaten late in the morning as a hearty combination of a late breakfast and an early lunch, usually eaten sometime between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Nana, if you're going to open a restaurant that caters specifically (and solely) to the brunch crowd, then you need to be prepared to handle that crowd at the appointed brunching hours and provide a brunch that can serve as both breakfast as well as lunch.  Simply existing between those hours and offering breakfast as well as lunch items does not qualify as being a successful bruncheon location. We arrived on-scene at 10am and were already stuck having to wait for a table.  Meaning that even before typical brunching hours, they were ill-equipped to handle the crowd.  They gave an estimate of 10-15 minutes.  If you happen to arrive at Nana and see a little bench by the door with no occupants, have someone in your party claim it - as it will likely be your best friend while you wait, which you will undoubtedly be doing. 15 minutes later, we got our table and paper menus.  I didn't notice that the fruit drink options at the bottom were ""sodas"", because I was looking for REAL soda (Nana does not approve).  So when I went with apple juice, that meant the $3.50 granny smith apple juice instead of the $2.50 apple soda. Now I like granny smith apples.  Truly.  And what arrived at the table was a small glass of green beverage, which indeed tasted just like picking an apple off the tree and biting into it (which I've done while apple-picking in Wisconsin).  But I'm not a fan of pulp, which was about 15% of the drink.  And for $3.50 I could get a few pounds of non-organic apples from a market.  Just sayin'. It took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive, as we people-watched the groups coming in, finding out how long of a wait it would be, and then 60% of them leaving. Our food arrived and the first thing I had to say to Char O. was ""I'm paying $9 for THIS?""  The omelette was small and didn't even cover 1/2 of the average-sized plate.  The rest was some potatoes and a tiny metal cup containing my ""side of fruit"": 1 tiny segment of orange, 2 chunks of a strawberry, and 4 blueberries.  I understand it's all organic, but does that allow carte blanche to shrink the portions while still increasing the price?  And no toast??  For shame! The potatoes were bland.  Nicely-fried and crispy on the outside like I prefer, but they required ketchup.  Which was organic, of course.  My ketchup could have used with some ketchup as well, if you catch my drift. And the omelette.  Okay, I'm not a grand chef, but I know that omelettes are a BLEND of eggs, cheese and filling.  Most of the ingredients are put IN with the eggs, then the cheese and remaining ingredients are placed on top before the eggs have fully set, because panning the omelette, folding and the trip to the table provides carryover time for the eggs to fully set perfectly and melt the cheese, creating that tasty amalgam that is the omelette.  Nana prefers her omelettes to be a patty of otherwise-scrambled eggs, wrapped around a layer of your ingredients.  My Farmer's Omelette was essentially a sandwich, except the bread was replaced by bland egg patties.  There was no melding of egg and ingredients.  So either organic foods don't play well with each other or every other breakfast diner I've been to has been deliciously wrong. And while I found my service to be okay (bonus points for bringing me the check early and letting me pay when I was ready), Char was left with an empty coffee cup, which I'm told is a cardinal sin in the breakfast-centered industries.  Also, the couple who arrived just after us (but seated 10 minutes after us and served their food as we were just finishing) actually got the wrong order.  It was a nice touch of Nana to let them keep the wrong food as they hurried to get the right order to the guy, but after keeping them waiting so long for food and not getting it right, it would be the definition of ""too little, too late"" and I doubt those two will be back. As for me, I'm on the fence about coming back. On the one hand, everything was slow and the place is small and the food was expensive and bland and I actually left still hungry (which is the opposite of a ""brunch"").  But on the other hand, Bridgeport NEEDS this place to survive.  While I'm almost offended by the nature of ""organic restaurants"", this place has enough starting business (the ones they don't chase away with waiting) to survive, filling one of the 28 vacant spaces along Halsted.  Our 'hood needs more new business that can survive longer than 2 months. Nana - if your completed menu can lower prices and increase portions as well as flavor, I will be back.

Can't wait to try their lunch menu.  Overall: great addition to Halsted Ave in Bridgeport. :)",0.9313,0.791,0.179,0.03,0.595
2009-08-30,3.0,"The place is beautiful and the coffee is great. I like the organic factor, especially the eggs and the fresh fruit. However, I'm not overly wowed by Nana. The menu is not very diverse, and they were out of a basic staple, oatmeal. The waiter was ""not sure"" of several things we asked him, and the OJ, while freshly-squeezed, was way overpriced.  Finally, our bill was weird and hard to decipher, listing things under other names and vague in spots.",0.7517,0.757,0.14,0.103,0.6138888888888888
2009-08-29,3.0,"i just drove past on friday and didn't realize that they JUST opened... i kinda had the feeling that it was pretty recently, just because it seemed they didn't quite have their routine down yet... but the place is beautiful... i think i didn't make the best choice but my friend had the savory crepes and really thought they were amazing... i had a grilled cheese with an egg on it and potatoes, which were just okay.. maybe some more seasoning would be cool... i will be back, it's close and i'm really excited about the organic factor. update: i've been back a few more times... hit or miss.. yesterday it was a hit day.. i had their baked chilaquiles, and it was sooo amazing and yummy with a ton of the green poblano sauce on it and the black beans compliment it so well. 1/25/10 lunch 12 dollar salad not worth it could i have some leaves of lettuce in my salad? annnnd maybe more than 4 small peices of chicken nana...see bongo room's salads !",0.9714,0.814,0.151,0.035,0.4683574879227053
2009-08-27,5.0,"I was completely blown away by the whole experience at Nana's for lunch.  Walking into this brand new place, with coffee bar, open kitchen and one whole wall of windows gives a fantastic first impression.   Service is very friendly - Holly, our waitress was on top of everything and knowledgeable.  Since it only opened Monday, they still had only their breakfast menu, but what a menu!  We started off with a fresh carrot juice for me and a carrot/orange juice for him. I wanted to eat light, and not sweet (no pancakes or waffles), so we both chose savory crepes, mine with melted cheese, his without.  Topping this with a little hot sauce made it the best I've ever eaten! As a side dish, we split the vegetarian black beans, which were a perfect topping and complement to the crepes. I'm a bit of an espresso snob (read Intelligentsia, fresh ground every morning, made by me), so I wondered what they could do.  I tested their barista with a single espresso.  It came out excellent; a nice small draw with good head.  First time I've had Metropolis beans, and will be sure to compare them against my usual in a taste test! Topping it off was meeting Omar, one of the family business' owners, who proudly told me he actually grew up in the building.  They have event space and will ultimately do catering as well.  I saw mom and his brother, and his extended ""family"".  Clearly a great start to what I am sure will become a successful local business.",0.996,0.747,0.229,0.025,0.5985169151835819
2009-08-25,5.0,"I am in love with this place! I had the baked chilaquiles (made by Nana herself, no less) - unbelievably flavorful.  A perfect combination of texture, sweet, spice...the list goes on.  Even the eggs were farm fresh.  You can tell by the beautiful color of the yolks.  It is clear that they did not skimp on a damn thing.  Metropolis coffee to wake the palate first, of course. The space is gorgeous inside and out. Hand carved wood, white trim, brass (or copper - i always get them confused) lights hang low and inviting over the front bar. Some places have a lot of heart, and this is clearly one of them.  The owners were all over the restaurant, talking with people that they had known their whole lives.  Apparently they grew up upstairs the restaurant. I am excited to see such a bright light in a neighborhood that truly needed what they are offering.  Heck yeah.  Well done fellahs.",0.9912,0.718,0.259,0.024,0.5658333333333333
