2017-09-03,3.0,"The River Walk is just a few blocks from my condo, and it's my early morning walk almost every day. It's beautiful when the sun is rising, spectacular at night. Definitely the most positive addition to Chicago since The Bean. Had dinner at O'Briens with a friend last week and was pleasantly surprised. From the other reviews, I was expecting mediocrity, but the food and service were pretty good. The prices are in line with restaurants in tourist areas. And you can't beat the ambience, being surrounded by the lights of the city and sounds of a busy waterway.  My friend and I both ordered the steak sandwich. A generous portion of meat covered with mozzarella, caramelized onions and mushrooms. Included a skimpy container of sloppy slaw and a dill pickle spear. On crusty Italian-style bread (which I discarded because I've been Yelping way too much and can barely get my jeans zipped).  Our server Hasket was friendly and very attentive, checking back with us several times to make certain we were taken care of and our wine glasses were full. My first issue is with the disposable plates and glasses. Wonder if it's mandated by the city or perhaps insurance. My second issue is with the two single restrooms, which are little better than portable toilets. Yuk. The city does provide a few permanent types on the River Walk, but they are not convenient to O'Briens.",0.9914,0.799,0.179,0.022,0.4346954769368563
2017-08-28,2.0,"It was a beautiful night and my boyfriend and I decided to find a happy hour on the river walk + sit outside. We walked up and down the river walk to find a good happy hour deal and made our way to O'Briens. When we showed up, 3 employees were standing at the host stand and, even though they made eye contact with us, chose to finish up there conversation before even greeting us. We stood there for 30 seconds and almost walked away. I have been in the service industry for over 6 years and know how things should be done. Once we finally were taken to our table, our server came up to us after a couple minutes and just dropped waters and said ""I'll give you some time"" but at that moment we had a few questions about the drink specials. At this point we were super unhappy and things were not looking up. We ordered the sweet potato fries - good. The chicken sausage - it was okay but very small portion for price. The vegetables and hummus - again, it was okay - the pita was super dry. I would maybe try again but first we will choose other places to try.",0.9746,0.809,0.154,0.037,0.6150277777777777

Sliders seemed warmed up like a Jimmy Dean breakfast muffin.  The sweet potato fries were limp and cold.  Potato chips at $4.00 were an embarrassment to any decent restaurant. For  4 sliders chips, fries and 2 lemonades the $32.00 was way too much. -----Try anyone else on the River walk.  Even if it's a bit more money you probably will not walk/run away disappointed.

2017-07-05,1.0,"If I could give this 0 stars, I sooo would. Where to begin.. the host looked inconvenienced and utterly fed up when we asked for a table overlooking the river (especially since we had with us friends from out of town) versus the one he gave us in the dark corner under Wacker Drive (which defeats the whole purpose of picking a riverside restaurant). He first said there were no tables available overlooking the river and when we pointed out that there are two empty ones that could be joined together, he looked like we just asked him to hurl rocks up Mount Everest.  Our waitress was sweet enough but then came the food. Oh dear. How can I adequately articulate our disappointment. The obnoxiously priced almost-$10 children's hot dog came in a bun that's at least a couple of inches longer than the hot dog itself. The chips were bland and clearly cooked in over-used oil. The cajun chicken sandwich was something else - an overcooked, cold, dried out plasticy piece of chicken breast with cajun spices sprinkled on top (yes, thrown on top of a cold already-cooked chicken breast). One of the burger dishes arrived with a hair on the side pickle. By the time they replaced the pickle, a second hair was discovered elsewhere on the plate. They did offer to replace the dish, but by then, it was too late for us to wait. And frankly, we couldn't wait to get out of there anyway. This is a touristy spot and O'Briens has to be one of the worst ways to demonstrate the caliber of cuisine in a city known for its restaurants. I get that this is a seasonal restaurant, I get that it must be an expensive spot from which to run a business, I get that that they might be limited in kitchen space (though I've had incredible food from a food truck - so space shouldn't be an excuse), but there's absolutely no excuse for the crap that comes out of this place.

My husband had a corned beef sandwich which was truly the saddest sandwich I have ever seen. It was on par with something a child could have made, not what a chef or even line cook should be making. The sandwich was not advertised as cold and we were surprised that it was cold. When we talked to the server about it, he said he has had a lot of people take issue with the fact that it comes out cold. In my opinion, if the server knows there is an issue with many guests not expecting/liking the menu item how it is prepared, he should tell people as they order.

2015-10-12,2.0,"First afternoon in Chicago after the long flight from Honolulu. I had about an hour before my river tour so I strolled along the river front looking for a place to grab some lunch. Stopped here as there seemed to be lots of open seating close to the water.   Food: I went with the steak sandwich with coleslaw. Surprised me that the steak was pretty much left whole, cut i half and placed between a sliced roll. The roll was wonderful, soft chewy interior, nice crunch on the outside, best part of the sandwich. I was expecting the steak to be sliced but no..left whole you have to kind of bit off chunks as you work your way through the meal. The plus was that the meat itself was pretty tender and I was able to easily bite of mouthfuls. The slaw was okay...vinegar/mayo based it did provide a nice counterpoint to the sandwich.  Service: Nothing to complain about..decent, attentive, quick. Nothing outstanding but nothing to complain about either. Value: Okay value for the location...maybe a little on the high side for the quality of food but hey..you're in a good spot to hang out and relax.

Wait time was actually 50 minutes. 2) Once seated, was promptly told that the kitchen would be closing temporarily as they were backed up and needed to catch their breath?! Last I checked, this wasn't the first time the restaurant opened, and albeit it was a nice Chicago summer evening, it wasn't the first one of these either. We ended up waiting another hour for our meal. 3) They messed up the order. I ordered a Spinach & Mushroom Quesadilla, but what they brought out was a Chicken Quesadilla. I would've complained, but being that I have already waited nearly 2 hours, I honestly would have eaten a bag of discarded peanut shells if they brought it out. 4) To top it all off, the waiter couldn't have been any ruder to us. You would think that by working in a service industry, one would do their best to keep the customers happy, or at the very least explain the situation. Neither happened. The waiter was abrasive, unattentive, and even snapped at us when we inquired about our food. I will admit - I do have two regrets in this situation. One - that I am unable to give zero stars, because I do not think that O'Briens deserves even one. Two - that I didn't leave and go somewhere else when I had the chance. That is my fault. However, I do vow that I will NEVER go to O'Briens again. And by the looks of all the negative reviews here, I'm not only the only that feels that way.

The menu is pretty basic - burgers, sandwiches, wings and salads. It looks like everything is made in a trailer, so it's not like a regular restaurant. The food wasn't gross, but in my mind this is almost like food I could buy at the community pool stand. I was disgusted by one thing though - the service. The waiter never even bothered to introduce himself. He just walked over literally 2 minutes after we were seated and asked if we were ready to order yet. They messed up our salad order, and it still wasn't corrected by the time we finished the rest of the meal so we just had them scrap it. Also, read the small print on the bottom of the menu- there's a $4.50 meal share fee. Pretty outrageous, so you're better off ordering a meal.

As we waited for the food we were asked if we ordered three different tables food because the runners didn't know where to serve the food. The salads were less than average and filled with pieces of brown lettuce. They were served on paper plates, and we were handed plastic silverware and Paul Newman's dressing packets.

The Final Verdict: Ambiance/Decor:  5.0 out of 5.0  (for being outdoors) Staff Service/friendliness:  4.0 out of 5.0 Staff attentiveness/awareness:  4.0 out of 5.0 Seating Arrangement/Layout:  4.0 out of 5.0 Seating Comfort:  3.0 out of 5.0 Food Quality/Flavor:  5.0 out of 5.0 Wine/Alcohol Selection/taste:  3.0 / 5.0 Food Price Value:  3.0 out of 5.0 Alcohol/Wine Price Value: 1.0 out of 5.0 Bathrooms Cleanliness:  3.5 / 5.0 Final Score:   35.5 out of 50  (71 out of 100% or C- Grade) Final Comment:  Location, location, location.... keep reminding yourself of that while seating out there and keep looking at the view and not at the prices or bill...  Food is good.  Drinks are ok (too pricey - $6.50 for a Corona) but served in plastic is silly.  A better option, McCormick and Schmick just upstairs... not on the river, but the same view and half of the price if there at happy hour.",0.9968,0.768,0.175,0.057,0.6417745638200185

2008-08-25,2.0,"I wish I would have looked up the reviews on this place before meeting my family here for lunch. They did the river boat tour and I met them on my lunch hour. O'Brien's has a fantastic patio, I will give them that. My lunch was just OK but I'm not at all satisfied. You're supposed to eat until satisfied right? I got the Cobb salad. It consisted of mixed greens and I had a lot of greens that looked like mini shrubs, who the hell eats that part of the salad!? Not me! The salad also had a couple of slices of turkey, 1/2 avocado and bacon bits. I only had tomato because I stole my brother's tomato from his turkey burger. Yes they do have Leprecan's as the bathroom facilities. I would hold it if you can. No one wants to use a port a potty at a restaurant! The reason why they use plastic everything is because they're on the river. But I can honestly say I will never be back.

Easy enough-- plenty of bars in the immediate area. Stephanie spotted O'Briens from up above on Wacker and decided she wanted to experience the Riverwalk. So down we went. And then up we came. $9 mojitos should not be served in plastic cups. Nor the wine. The only beer on tap at a supposed 'Irish' pub? Don't laugh-- Miller Lite. My drinks took too long to make and then even more time was spent paying for the disasters. But, my friend got her river view.

I was in Chicago exhibiting at an educational conference.  My new friend and I decided that we would explore and find dinner together.  After walking many many blocks around the west side of michigan avenue, we stumbled across o'briens.  The restaurant is located right on the river and just screams wonderful location.  That wasn't the only thing it was screaming! We decide to try there as it smelled so good!  You could smell steaks and it was heaven (must have been the mccormick and schmidts just a block away).  We stand for about 2 mins before a hostess finally seats us.  We have a great little table next to the rail.  A really nice atmosphere to talk and get to know each other.  And let me tell you, we had plenty of time do just that. Our waiter had the look of ""i don't want to be here"" on his face when he finally decided to come take our order.  We are at an irish place and egad!  no irish beers to be found.  We order 2 domestics and are a little put out when then are delivered in 8 oz plastic cups.  They weren't delivered by our waitperson so we were a little confused by that, not really sure as to who our waitperson was going to be. We finally order our food and of course when it comes out - ALL WRONG!  Our appetizer came after we requested to still have it even though our main course had arrived.  HORRIBLE!!  My companion's food is fine, mine is not.  I had asked for my steak sammy to be medium rare.  Well done.  I ask to have it cooked again - well done again and with all the yucky onions and stuff i requested not on it the first time.   Its time for the manager visit....... I thought my dinner companion was going to hit the roof.  Again, not a good start of what could end up as being a pseudo-first date.  Charlie, the manager on duty, was fabulous.  Too bad he had to show that by removing my food, the appetizer and my 2 drinks from the bill.  All hail Charlie!! In conclusion, what a waste of a great outdoor eating opportunity.  At least the management didn't fight with me about it!  Oh well.  At least Ditka's was good that night when i finally had my dinner.",0.9712,0.791,0.127,0.082,0.6099060331203188
2008-07-28,2.0,"O'Briens is like a prostitute in the dark, it looks good from far away but once you begin the experience you immediately begin to regret it. And like any good prostitute,  this place sucks balls. If I can save at least one person from visiting this place, I will be happy.  To start there were a good 7 or 8 waiters standing around, none of who would come over and seat us. Apparently there was a hostess but she would disappear for long periods of time until an angry crowd formed at the podium. It took forever to order our food, forever to be served our food, forever to get our check. The only thing that came in less than 20 minutes was the glasses of water at the start of our meal. The food was admittedly tasty (when it finally arrived and we were actually given silverware to eat with) and the riverside view was beautiful, but it wasn't enough to save this place. My worry is non-Yelper tourists will stumble on this place like I did and have to suffer the same fate.",0.9387,0.731,0.168,0.101,0.5548245614035088

2008-07-14,1.0,"Pretty horrendous. Friend and I came here for a lunch after not being able to get a table outdoors at Smith & Wollensky's across the street. We still wanted to sit outside, so we strolled on over. The outside cafe was the only good quality about the place.  The service is pretty bad, it took forever to get our drinks and food and I think my request to get a sun umbrella for the table went into the customer request black hole.  When the food did arrive it was pretty tacky. I felt like it was something that I would get at a grade school summer picnic outing.  The hotdog and chicken wrap lunch became a two hour affair.  Very silly indeed. We did see some cool boats pass by on the river, and it was nice out, so no harm done. Just never going back and can whole heartedly recommend to anyone to skip the place.",0.8915,0.765,0.156,0.078,0.6515625
2008-06-27,1.0,"Went here today for a business lunch.  Had it been appropriate, I might have suggested an alternate location after reading these reviews!  However, I put my game face on, and as I stood on the steps leading down to O'Briens, I thought, ""Hey, there's a lot of people here, how bad can it be?""  (This is the beginning of the end.) I looked at the menu and avoided the dreaded lukewarm turkey burger...but after taking a look at the remaining choices...I opted for grilled vegetables.  Yep.  They're not really on the menu, but they were listed as a side with entrees.  I was pretty pleased with myself.  Figured I'd beat the system, right?  Hm. My dining companion ordered next.  A Caesar salad, always a safe bet for business luncheons.  ""Ah,"" said the waiter.  ""We ran out of lettuce yesterday."" Excuse me? You ran out of LETTUCE?  It's Friday lunch hour, on a summer day in Chicago.  This is a riverfront restaurant.  And you have no lettuce?  Was it really that difficult to acquire more lettuce?  Is there not a grocery store four blocks north?  Oh sure, that's right.  No one in their right mind would order salad for lunch... The voices of other yelpers howled with laughter in my head.  I lol'd to the max myself. It's not the fault of the server.  In fact, the only reason O'Brien's got a star is because the server was very good.  He checked on us multiple times, and brought me a new iced tea after mine got contaminated by a fly.  He also did not try to defend himself when I laughed at him for saying, ""Oh, we have lettuce for sandwiches, just not for salad.""  Anyway, I thought the service was just fine. The grilled vegetables were alright. A bit too greasy and I couldn't even cut the carrot with my plastic knife.  But the red and green peppers and the zucchini were cooked and flavorful. My dining companion enjoyed his chicken caesar wrap.  In fact, he was quite happy that his ""chicken wasn't drowning in dressing.""  He did eat the entire wrap, and finished off most of the accompanying side pickle.

2007-08-11,2.0,"I went to O""Brien's Riverwalk Cafe hoping that it wouldn't be AS bad as Joseph M. described, and no, our experience was not quite as abysmal.   But it was still slightly abysmal.   First, the positives (since I'm in a glass-half full mood): --The location RIGHT on the river is kind of cool.  Front row view of the Trump tower construction (but it was evening when I was there so it wasn't too loud, as construction had slowed quite a bit.)  Again, it was evening, so the boats we saw on the river were more of the fancy yachts with people who've been drinking all day.  Which was actually sort of entertaining.   -- They had these sorta cool fake owls sitting along the railing.  They're supposed to scare away pigeons.   -- Our waitress was very attentive.  And now, the BAD: -- Food sucked.  Sorry, but there's really no other description.  Unoriginal dishes that were poorly executed.  We started with a spinach and artichoke dip.  It was served cold.  Not cold as in only partially nuked, but cold as in straight out of the refrigerator.  I've had good cold spinach dips (helloooo Treasure Island), but this was NOT one.  I had a salad that sounded good but was average at best, and my date forced himself to finish his filet out of principle.   -- Poor presentation.  If I wanted to eat off of plastic plates, I'd stay at home and get delivery.   -- Bathroom situation.  Yeah, it's two or three port-a-pots.  I won't even go into all the reasons why it grosses me out to have port-a-pots as the only bathroom option at a food establishment.  Like Joseph said, they could try to hide them a little better.... Overall, I'd never go back to O'Briens Riverwalk for dinner.  I could potentially see it as a good place to get after-work drinks, however.  Just so long as it was ONLY drinks, and not food.",0.8935,0.816,0.107,0.077,0.6022938443670152
2007-06-30,1.0,"Strolling down Wacker on a summer afternoon why not take a break and pop down to O'Briens Riverwalk Cafe located down the stairs towards the Chicago River at the corner of Wacker and Wabash?   Here's why... As you sit next to the river and try to get situated you hear construction making way on the new Trump building across the river; cars whizzing by on lower wacker drive, a mere stone's throw away;  tour boats talking about how the tall white building is the thinnest building of its size in Chicago, each time they go by;  and the reassurance from your waiter that your order has been put in. The service is slow and seldom.  It was very apparent by overhearing and watching the few other occupied tables wonder out loud, ""what could be taking so long to make chips, a burger, open a beer, (etc)"" that my table was in the same waiting game.  We tried to flag our waiter, who didn't quite have the people skills to be working in the service industry, in time to cancel our order so we could pull out but it was too late.  I had the distinct feeling our waiter was new to working in a restaurant when he asked, ""how would you like it cooked?"" after ordering a turkey burger.  Not being entirely sold on eating undercooked ground fowl I opted for well done.   Half an hour later we received our cooked but not really still warm food.  Though not warm, the food wasn't really anything to write home about either.  It occupied space in our stomachs and thus had fulfilled the purpose of why we arrived at this location in life. The ambiance isn't great despite having a more unique location on the river.   As previously mentioned there's definitely sounds, though not fault of the establishment .The ""kitchen"" is in full view as it looks like a trailer that doles out food at a traveling circus or carnival.  There is a bar that sits on the sidewalk but appears to be a oversized serving station for drinks and not so much a bar.  And best of all in plain view are the porta-potties stationed to the right of the bar - it must be too much to put up a screen or room divider in front of these things.   I'm not saying don't go there, but just don't go there with great expectations.",0.9239,0.891,0.069,0.04,0.392946001367054
