I have tried all of their empenadas and not a single one has disappointed. My top three would have to be the steak, spinach, and corn. They are little pockets of deliciousness and joy and the two sauces you get with them are both very well done and I highly recommend that you mix them for an even better flavor. Their flan is also a great dessert and easy to share.

There's a number of paintings hung that appear to be from the same artist and compliments to the feel of the entire restaurant.

He ordered the Milanesa El Nandu which was very tender and delicious. I ordered the Milanesa Pollo El Nandu and was a little disappointed. The chicken was a little overlooked and the cheese did not look warm and fresh in comparison to my boyfriends entree.

The steak itself was tough and fatty, and the onions were not cooked well...they were hard, crunchy, and slightly brown (not caramelized). The rice was horrible...it tasted like dish soap. I had one bite and left the rest. My husband had the same entree, but with cheese and a side of mashed potatoes. He liked the cheese, but he also thought the steak was fatty and not that tasty.

The space is inviting and unpretentious, the service very attentive without being overbearing. Bread and drinks came quickly. The bread was unremarkable, but a good vehicle for the chimichurri and other green sauce that accompanied it. Then: the empanadas. Yum! I might just stick with those next time, but they started off our meal with a bang. Amongst us we got many different kinds and they were all delicious except for the chicken (dry). They're pretty sizable, so having a couple of these plus the bread means you'll be taking some of your dinner home. I had simply the house salad, which was nice and fresh and actually so large I had to take half of it home. The dressing was disappointing - bottles of oil and vinegar. Normally I like that, but they weren't of good quality. My Hubby had strip steak with onions - pretty good. I would come back for the empanadas, for sure!",0.9892,0.756,0.209,0.035,0.5966507936507935

Truth be told, I've yet to actually have anything but the empanadas. I know, it may be weird to write a review that basically turns a restaurant into a food truck, but, that's happening so deal with it.  Logan Square and Wicker Park are filled with lots of great options, but El Nandu stands at the top of the heap in this area.  While one will never go wrong with any of the empanadas, I keep finding myself go back to the jamon, criolla, and tucumana empanadas. I think that's more a comment as to how good those empanadas are as opposed to making a statement to the opposite. I do wish that El Nandu would deliver, but, that's more due to me being in a lazy mood when I want empanadas.

2016-02-15,4.0,"I had some hesitation initially as the storefront in the pictures didn't seem too welcoming. however, I was pleasantly surprised throughout the night.  Seating was ample at 7:30pm as there was only 1 family of 8, a couple, a small group of guys in the entire restaurant. As time passed, there were customers constantly coming in...groups and couples alike. There were at least 2-3 families/groups celebrating birthdays.   It felt very neat and comfortable place for a casual Argentinean steak dinner. It's not a fancy, low lit, large steakhouse. We were welcomed with fresh bread and 2 green sauces (one was chimmichuri/garlicy and the other was spicy/tangy). We ordered a half carafe of sangria which was sweet and refreshing (just a note: there is no fruit floating in these glasses).  Service was friendly and knowledgeable (and handsome.. :P). we ordered the following: - Criolla empanada - this was flavorful. I would go to get this again. I like the added touch of they labeled the shell of the empanadas...so helpful.  - Camarones empanada- this was fairly mild compared to the criolla but not bad. just shrimp and cheese - Churrasco Encebollado - NY strip with fried onions is a solid choice. I like that they don't over salt the meat. I asked for medium and it was just enough red for me. - Asado - The short ribs were too charred personally. it was tasty initially but the churrasco was the better choice. - I am a sucker for the their homemade flan with the dulce de leche....they give you an indulgently sweet dollop of that caramel...mmmm.   One qualm I have is that their sides could be more spruced up. I initially thought the mashed potatoes came from a box but it is not. they are real. they could make is it chunkier or more flavorful. The rice was blah... sides were generally unimpressive.

I like the empanada and it's very different than my last empanadas. I think it's because of the spice that they put in. Must Try.  The skirt steak with grilled onion is not on the menu but it was recommended to me by the waiter. The steak is perfectly cooked and the onion complements the steak really well.

2015-07-07,5.0,"El Nandu was one of the few restaurants in our part of Logan Square when we moved in 18 years ago.  I LOVE that we're still regulars after all these years and with all the fabulous places that have opened.  The waiters here could not be nicer!  Always smiling & on top of everything.  The service is warm & welcoming. I highly recommend starting off with a few empanadas ($2.50 each).  Their dough is delish & they are perfectly fried.  My favorites are the Criolla (beef, peppers & onion), Camarones, Espinaca and Jamon Y Queso.  All are great! My most coveted entree is the Milanesa De Pollo El Nandu.  The chicken is pounded flat, lightly breaded and perfectly cooked.  It is topped off with a slightly sweet homemade tomato sauce, garlic and white cheese.  It is hands down my favorite. When I'm trying to behave, I order the Pollo Al Limon.  They pound out a chicken breast, baste it with lemon juice and grill it to perfection.  Always moist, never dry.  Always. As for their sides, they have many and my go to is the rice.  It REALLY complements their steak & chicken dishes.  Again, when I'm trying to behave, I'll opt for their Ensalada Mixta.  A simple salad that they serve generously.   Last but not least, I would be remiss if I didn't brag on their chimichurri sauce.  I can be pretty gluttonous with the amount I'll spread on my bread or entree.  Super fresh & super delish! This Logan Square staple is a must try!  A fabulous Argentinan restaurant.  I adore the various slide shows of Argentina that play on the TV above the bar.  Absolutely beautiful pictures.  They should have a travel agent at the bar... I'm ready to book a flight after seeing all those beautiful pics.  Lastly, they may have it other nights too, but for sure on Thursdays, they have live music.  Sometimes just a man & his guitar, sometimes with a female singer...both are really enjoyable!",0.9978,0.763,0.233,0.005,0.5594942783314878
2015-06-22,4.0,"Came here with my bro's gangs and my girlfriend for some Argentinian experience. To say the very least, I am a fan. A small yet hungry for more fan. As our pre-appetizer (yes, appetizer for the appetizers), they provided some bread rolls with two kinds of spread. I have no idea what those were called, but they were deviously delicious. I easily consumed a whole roll of bread before my girlfriend had to slap my hand to remind me that we have yet to order. Ooops, too late. Being famished, I immediately jump on the chance of having abundant of Steak, Argentinian style of course. We quickly placed the order and await for the arrival of our meals. Meanwhile, I continue to put away those bread rolls with the spread.  We didn't wait long, considering there were 15 orders, and all 15 orders came at once. My eyes were wide opened by the sheer amount of protein that rests on my plate. Eyes were satisfied. Nose was satisfied. Now only the tummy.  Down I go. The steak was well prepared. Not too raw, but not too cooked either. I wouldn't say it's to perfection because it is not your typical American style steak. But boy does it taste delicious! Then I suddenly came to a realization: I could apply those addicting spread I used on the bread on the steak! It was definitely one of those light bulb moments, for I feel ingenious to have made that connection. As if the juicy flavor of the meat juice was not enough, the impact of the spicy sauce definitely push it over the top!  The decorations of the place was nothing too special. The walls got some artwork hanged on them, but I don't see them as anything Argentina, but that may be because I am just not that cultured when it comes to paintings. But hey, we came for the food after all! Would definitely come back and try other things on the menu. The only thing that keeps this place from a 5 star is accessibility.

But as far as we're concerned, they don't claim that it's supposed to.  My sister took us out here, along with an exchange High school student from Argentina. Not that a typical 17 year old knows an awful lot about food, but he said the meat was good and that the empanadas were small.  Agreed on both fronts. Regarding said empanadas, eating food with writing on it that is not a birthday cake was a little strange, but the CAMARONES WERE DELICIOUS! ALLERGY FYI: Although there didn't appear to be nut on the menu, my niece, who is allergic, had a reaction to the empenadas. Nothing catastrophic, although she did need to leave the table to go to walgreen's to get benadryl. Perhaps they use a peanut type oil? Not a cheap dive.",0.7598,0.827,0.094,0.079,0.5261538461538462

First off, the place exudes a very Buenos Aires (porteño) sense of style...slightly surreal art on the wall, nice brick and wood decor.  Great ambience for a nice meal out. The food is also no letdown, and while definitely not a cheap meal out, you get what you pay for in terms of quality and quantity.  The empanadas are KILLER; seriously some of the best I've had.  I do wish they had decided to include empanadas salteñas instead of the tucumanas, which are good, but not as exciting.  So it goes.  At $2.50 a pop, they're not the cheapest empanadas ever, but again...you get what you pay for. Entrees...also great.  The parrillada has all of the best parts of a rioplatense mixed grill; amazing short ribs, good chorizo (though theirs is more of an Italian sausage than a proper chorizo), and EXCELLENT mollejas (sweetbreads)...the mollejas alone are worth the price of admission, and can be orders on their own as an appetizer or entree.  They make a good milanesa, too...and one big enough to feed at least two people. Dessert-wise, I split the dulce de leche cheesecake with a friend...delicious, the right balance of sweetness and cheesecake tang.  The drink selection is solid; it wouldn't hurt them to include a white option on the wine list (torrontés, anyone?), and I'm surprised you can't get a fernet con coca, but they did at least have Quilmes.  Uruguayan beer is better (well, Uruguayan EVERYTHING is better...), but it's also not available the states, so I can live with Quilmes.

They are fried, which is not my preference for Argentinean empanadas, but they are tasty. They serve two different types of chimichurri with the empanadas and the bread. Both are fantastic, but all chimichurri is fantastic. You can put it on anything and it will taste good. I was not fooled this time around and instead of ordering churrasco, we ordered the entrana (flank or skirt) steak. Not fooled again because now I know that for some reason what they call churrasco at Argentinean restaurants in places like Miami and Puerto Rico is not the same cut of meat that they call churrasco in Argentina (or at el Nandu). I grew up thinking that churrasco was indeed flank or skirt steak. Very tender and not a lot of fat. The real churrasco is more like a ribeye cut. Not great unless you are getting really great quality meat. So, my wife got the entrana and I ordered the short ribs. Mine was just OK, the entrana was great. It is not cheap. Just a so-so value.

For our main dish, we ordered one entree and shared.  We ordered a dish that consisted of 3 different meats which came with a side of rice.  The whole dish itself was HUGE and we were glad we shared.  The platter came with short ribs, Argentinian sausage, and sweetbreads.  The short ribs were really tough and chewy, but had a nice char-grilled flavor.  The Argentinian sausage tastes like something I could have bought at Jewel.  While it was tasty, there was nothing special about it.  I was a little hesitant to try the sweetbreads, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a nice gamey-earthy taste to it.

As fellow Yelpers already mention, the empanadas are super tasty.  I asked our waiter to recommend his favorites and took his advice on the spinach.  It was very unique; super-moist but not watery, lots of spinach flavor and a lovely subtle spice blend that really worked.  And the ""stamp"" on the empanadas actually came in handy, since our table ordered lots of different flavors. We split a carafe of sangria and while it didn't come with fruit, I found that a plus.  Where else can you get an entire carafe of pourable liquid that easily fills 6-7 glasses for $15?  It's got the flavor, and I was happy to forego the fruit mash-up of inedible orange peels and apple chunks that normally take up a quarter of the pitcher anyway. Our main courses were passable, but the true standout dish was the Milanesa De Pollo El Ñandú, a breaded and sauteed boneless chicken breast topped with homemade tomato sauce and smothered in garlic and white cheese.  What??  Melt-in-your-mouth good. We skipped dessert and half of us took home leftovers, so portion sizes are pretty good.  The service was friendly, if a bit slow, but we weren't rushed and it seemed that only two waiters were handling the entire dining room, so I give them props for keeping up on a busy Saturday evening.

Quelle value! When we walked in, it was empty, and by the time we left, it was packed with people of all varieties.

Inside the hot pocket of yumminess is a creamy center with loads of small shrimp.  The empanadas are a bit on the small side, but well worth the $2.50 price for each.  They all come stamped with the name of what is inside each.  The crust is flaky, golden brown and definitely homemade.   The other empanada I tried was the maize one, (in my opinion not as good as the camarron, but still delicious.) My date and I shared a house salad topped with cucumbers, tomato, red onion and black olives that we splashed with vinegar and olive oil.  (the house dressing)  My friend Tom ordered one of the most amazing potato salads I've ever had. Also, a must-try. The only complaint I have with Nandu, is the service.  I felt it was lacking in timeliness, and observation (our bread was out for a long time, and our server failed to ask if we wanted more and my coffee refill was overlooked).  The tab could have been upped by a good twenty dollars, simply by the server asking if any guests wanted another beer or appetizer.  On a night like New Years, it is expected of the server to be most considerate of the guest's time and their need to make other engagements for the night.  This also, was overlooked by our server, as we sat for some twenty five minutes looking around and waiting for our tab, so we could pay.   I will be back to Nandu though.  The food is worth the wait.",0.9691,0.827,0.12,0.053,0.4321739718614719

Its sweeter than normal, but really tasty:) We ended the night with a flan and it was the highlight of our night. They give you a huge scoop of caramel and whipped cream along side the flan.

There is a lot of meat on the menu, although I was a little disappointed that the menu doesn't do a very good job of describing your options to you.  (For example, the sweeatbread is described as ""an acquired taste."") However, there ARE lots of options for chicken and beef, and if you're new and inquisitive enough to ask your server for details or recommendations, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised. My friend's steak was cooked exactly to his happy medium specification.  I tried it, I can attest to the juiciness and flavor.  It was topped with onions that weren't quite as caramelized as they maybe should've been. My milanese steak struck me as uninspired.  It was dry and sliced overly thin.  Even the mashed potatoes were flavorless.  All I could taste in them was milk.

The lemon chicken came with your choice of yellow rice, french fries or mashed potatoes. I've been craving mashed tats so that was perfect. Unfortunately, the mashed tats were a little thin and flavorless and did nothing for my craving.  They offer a wide variety of empanadas that are all wonderful. I especially loved the chopped green olive in the ground beef one and the red pepper in the chicken. The dipping sauces are a wonderful compliment too.

2010-08-09,4.0,"In Chicago, where restaurants often burst on the scene only to flame out spectacularly a la Icarus, it is rare when one can become acquainted with an establishment and see it grow into full fledged maturity.  For me, that restaurant is El Nandu. When I moved into Logan Square at the fin de siècle of the 20th Century, El Nandu was one of my first destinations.  The food and service captivated me immediately, and I have not been disappointed since.  Like all South American restaurants, El Nandu is a temple of meat.  Unlike many similar establishments in other Chicago neighborhoods, El Nandu is also a steal in value. No visit here would be complete without sampling the Empanadas, which have a hearty yet flaky crust and are filled with juicy steak, flavorful ground beef, and gooey cheese, either with ham or shrimp.  You should always get at least one, and if you have a large enough table, get an order of the mollejas - sweatbreads - to share.  If your friends are queasy about their meat, withhold the story of sweatbreads.  Suffice it to say, El Nandu was offalized before offal was cool. But on to the main course - the steaks.  As I'm sure you are aware, Argentine steaks are not your father's steak - no two inch thick corn fed cuts here.  Instead, these steaks make up in breadth what they lack in depth, and are pounded and tenderized into submission before being seared to perfection on the grill.  As mainstay waiter Martin will inform you, I've been having the churrasco medium rare, with Spanish yellow rice, for years and I wouldn't have it any other way.  An affordable selection of Argentinian and Chilean wines round out the menu. Finally, a note on atmosphere -  you can always count on an eclectic collection of South American art on the walls, and a South American slide show on the flat screen above the bar.  On many evenings you will be accompanied by a guitarist performing South American classics.  Arrive early to avoid the rush, but stay late to enjoy classic South American nightlife.",0.86,0.91,0.061,0.029,0.42309727309727324

Can we say ""hot pockets?""  Also the 2 oddly green dipping sauces they served with the cold, very plain bread tasted like grass with maybe olive oil and a few spices added.  Blech.  I tasted my cousin's steak covered in cheese and it really grossed me out, it reminded me of nasty cube steak.  As I side I got rice, which tasted worse than rice a roni, and it was cold.  Not to mention flavor-less.

First, they brought me bread and two of the most amazing sauces I've ever had. The chimichurri-style sauce perhaps the greatest thing I've ever ingested. It was absolutely perfect. I wanted to put it all over every bit of food I ate that night.  Next, empanadas. My dining-partner and I split three - Tucumana, Jamon y Queso, and Pollo. Our server was very patient with my pronunciation (""tu-cu-ma-na?"") and quickly brought out three warm, delicious empanadas. No worries on figuring out which was which - they are all adorably stamped with the name of their contents. (Sidenote: I wanted to beg my new Argentinean family to show me how this was done. Is there a mini branding-iron back in the kitchen? Show me! Teach me!). My favorite empanada was the Tucumana - steak, eggs, olives, and onions in a toasty-flaky shell. The smell alone made my knees go weak.  I followed with Pollo Al Ajo - chicken with roasted garlic. Perfectly tender, perfectly seasoned. I mixed some of the chimichurri sauce into the mashed potatoes I had on the side, and the result was divine.  All the while, I was being serenaded by a father/daughter guitar and vocal duo. While I was unfamiliar with the songs, other diners did not hesitate to sing along, which only enhanced the feeling of conviviality and community. If I closed my eyes a little and drifted off, I was no longer in snowy Logan Square - I'd been transported to a sunny courtyard in Buenos Aires.

BUT it also means I have seen them evolve. I can say that these days they have the best empanadas they have ever had before.  I order the queso and criolla empanadas the moment I sit down. The queso has this wonderful flavor and texture of a cheese that is both melted, but with a little body to it. How do you describe cheese? I don't know, but I love it. I've had the shrimp and cheese, but it's not the same, I have my favorites.  I also recommend the entrana. It is huge and I like to order it bloody. Very juicy and tender, and usually two or even three of us have been able to eat one of these. It comes with mashed potatoes or salad. I usually get salad, but the potatoes have been very good lately. I always finish off a meal with a cappucino and a flan. YUM. I like to sit and listen to the music and there is always a nice variety of people there. For me this is a link back to home in a small way.

Most of the entrees seem to come with a side of fries, mashed potatoes or salad. I really appreciated the salad option with mixed greens (not iceberg) and big tomatoes.

2009-10-04,4.0,"They say that man can not live on bread alone.  Well even though I have devoted my life to proving this statement wrong, I guess in the end I'm forced to agree.  However, throw some stuffing inside of it and bake it into a pastrylicious empenada, and, well, then it's a different story.  Yes, I do believe that I could live on empanadas from El Nandu alone! At $2.50 a piece, three or four actually make a decent meal even if they're labeled as ""appetizers."" Of course, being a vegetarian at an Argentinian steakhouse, I kind of had to anyway.  Besides three kinds of empanada (spinach, corn, and cheese) about the only other herbivore friendly items on the menu are salads (though this includes a mayo or mayo free optioned potato salad that is to start a revolution for). That being said, El Nandu does something that is the smartest little idea ever.  Each empenada comes to the table branded with what kind it is (so no accidentally biting the meat, as no one enjoys that).  This makes sharing amongst a large party of diverse tastes extremely easy.  Also smart, since the empanadas are labeled in Spanish, the restaurant also leaves the menus out to help with translation. The fact that it's across from the Fireside Bowl may fool some people into thinking this place is dirt cheap - it's not (though it's cheaper than some downtown Argentine places).  Mains still run over $20.00.  The portions are gigantic, however - so large that the sides of fries, rice, or mashed potatoes got pushed onto separate plates for some of my dining companions.  And they serve pancreas, which is intriguing (the menu says it's an acquired taste but I don't think it's one I want even if I did eat meat).  It's a fine dining experience in a truly unexpected place. The only (t-)bone I'd pick with El Nandu is the entertainment.  Even though they had a guitar player in the house, most of the music the party I was there with was serenaded with was muzak versions of 70s tunes.  Plus the televisions showed what amounted to a power point presentation on Argentina on repeat. But, I guess I didn't go there to be immersed in Argentinian culture.  I came there to be immersed in empanada goodness.  And this restaurant could easily survive on that immersion alone.",0.9837,0.837,0.121,0.042,0.5817901234567902

2009-02-27,2.0,"El Nandu. You teased me with your promise of acclaimed empanadas, amazing meats and Sangria to die for. So I went looking for you on this stretch of Fullerton to see what the hype was all about.  Your understated storefront did not beckon to me but I pulled open the door and walked into a surprisingly empty restaurant.  You were quick to seat me and give me a couple of green sauces (one hot and one garlicky) along with some fresh bread. The sangria must be pre-made as I could not get mine without the orange juice so I had to pass on that specialty. And the iced tea was not fresh brewed but from a can or bottle. Pout.  We went with your suggestions of empanadas (chicken-the best, shrimp -good, and the beef- eh)They were crispy, hot and very tasty and really saved the visit for me. It was only the empanadas that got you the extra star as our dinners were just so-so.  I had the breaded steak with cheese served with mashed potatoes. The steak was literally buried under the cheese and lacked any kind of flavor. I had a similar dish when I was in Argentina and it was delicious so I don't know what went wrong.. And as for those potatoes? Clearly they were from a box as they had that noticeable smell that only boxed potatoes offer up. Not good. Our other entree was the Skirt steak which was highly recommended by friends but that was simply uninspired.

2009-02-18,4.0,"El Nandu is an Argentinian restaurant in Logan Square. BF and I went to try the empanadas. There was a place in New York I used to always go to and just get empanadas for my meal so I thought we'd do that. We ended up each getting two empanadas for starters and then each ordering entrees in addition. Everything was fabulous. Very tasty. We loved the two condiments we were served even though we don't know what they were.. they were both green and delicious. We will definitely be back. This is what we had:     * Criolla Empanada: A delicious blend of ground bell, red peppers, onions, yellow raisins, hard - boiled eggs, herbs and other condiments.     * Pollo Empanada: Stuffed with tasty chicken, red bell peppers, green onions, herbs and other condiments.     * Camarones Empanada: For the seafood lover, this empanada is filled with fresh shrimp, paramesan and white cheese, herbs and other spices     * Maiz Empanada: Fresh corn mixed with green onions, red bell peppers, hard - boiled eggs, cheese, herbs and other mouth - watering condiments     * Pollo Al Chimichurri: A grilled, boneless breast of chicken topped with creamy version of our famous and popular chimichuri sauce, made of garlic, parsly and olive oil.     * Churrasco Encebollado: Our most popular churrasco!

2009-01-04,4.0,"This place was a random find for me, but I have been many times since that first dinner when my ex and I were the only two in the entire restaurant.   First, the bread and chimichurri... I LOVE this chimichurri sauce.  The  (not too) spicy, creamier sauce is AMAZING. I love it so much that I purchased a container of it to go for $5 and put it on everything I ate for the next week.  Nothing special about the bread, but both chimichurri sauces they serve with it are so good that they make that bread delicious.   I've only had the empanadas a couple times.  I have tried pollo, camarones, and jamon y queso.  The pollo is delicious... I would eat that as my entire meal (with the chimichurri) and I would be a happy woman.  The camarones was too much cheese, too little shrimp for my taste, and the jamon y queso was tasty, but I don't have much desire to have it again (I can go anywhere and have ham and cheese anything- this wasn't that great that I would go out of my way to order it).   As for steaks, the Entrana and the Churrasco are both great. I generally get into a rut when I find a restaurant and only order one entree, only try a couple things, but these two steaks are always prepared as I ordered.  Tender, juicy, tasty, and generally as one would expect from a steak restaurant.  I did try the Pollo Chimichurri (I think that is what it is called) once, and I wasn't too impressed.  Mostly because it was just a plain grilled chicken smothered in the chimichurri.  While I love that darn sauce,  I would have preferred that the chicken itself wasn't so boring.  Last time my friend ordered a steak covered in cheese and onion... and wow, they aren't lying when they have that on the menu. He enjoyed the steak, and the cheese, but it appeared that the onions were grilled separately and simply placed on top of the cheese- and there were WAY too many onions! As for sides, go with the rice or the fries.  The mashed potatoes taste like they came from a cheap, generic box. On weekends there is live entertainment- I have seen a man playing a guitar with a woman singing, and I have seen just the man with his guitar. He's great. The sangria is decent... I wouldn't recommend going to the restaurant just for the sangria, but, it is a nice addition to the meal. Finally, service seems to be on the decline here, which is terribly disappointing to me.  I believe this gentleman is a manager, and when I first started going he was always a very attentive server.  The last two times I went, he disappeared after taking our order, and the last time I was there he came back about 15 minutes after we finished our meals. They never even refilled my water.  So, hopefully he turns it around and starts to act a bit more attentive to his patrons. (FYI I haven't acted like a difficult customer, and I've still left decent tips because I want to keep going back...)",0.9962,0.778,0.16,0.062,0.5952380952380951

I really liked the camarones one. The bread and sauces they give you are awesome!  So why was I leaning towards a 3 initially?

She told us it would be 30 minutes, but looking around we could tell it would only take a few minutes before a table cleared for us, so we stuck around. I do not understand what everyone is raving about with the empanadas. They were nothing more than fried dough. We order about five different kinds. I couldn't taste the fillings in any of them. But the two sauces they provide (one's a sort of mustardy kind, the other's like tabouli minus the tomatoes and onion) make even a plain piece of bread awesome. So, points for the condiments.  Our waiter was nice. Except he brazenly hit on me, and not in that flirty way hoping to get a better tip. I was with male companions. For all the server knew, one coulda been my boyfriend or hubbby. Not cool, dude.  They clearly need more kitchen and wait staff on weekends. After we all devoured our first round of empanadas and appetizers, it took forever to grab our server to order round two. My plate of fatty-beef-that-taste-like-chicken came out, which I had to eat while everyone else waited for their food. Nearly half an hour passed before the rest of our order came out. During that time we drank all our sangria and wine cuz there was nothing to eat! They didn't even offer more bread to tide us over. And we couldn't find a server to ask for more. Their Spanish rice was super yummy.  To use the restroom, you have to go through the kitchen. I don't know how that's not a health code violation. Personally, I don't want to leave a restaurant smelling like grease because of a stroll through the cooking area. I don't know that I'll ever go back, with so many better options in the city.

I have to agree, I liked the empandas. The three of us split 5 empanadas - criolla (bell peppers, onions, raisins), jamon & queso, camarones, pollo and espinaca - all very tasty and toasty warm when they arrived. At $2.50 a piece, you could probably just get 3-4 of them and have a pretty darn good meal. For entrees, CK went with the pollo al chimichurri, DY went with the churrasco encebollado and I went with the steak milanesa. The chicken and the churrasco were both pretty good - the chicken in particular was tender and moist - while the milanesa wasn't bad, but ended up being an overload of fried steak. On one hand, it reminded me a little of chicken fried steak and on the other, Japanese tonkatsu. Probably wouldn't get it again, but would get chicken instead. The sangria was pretty good too - though the red wine was definitely noticeable, the taste wasn't as strong as at other restaurants. (Ok, call me a girl, but I like the sweeter drinks where the taste of alcohol isn't as noticeable.)

I wonder whether all the places on Check Please! have always been this busy or whether Check Please! made them popular, but there were so many people when we came. We ended up waiting for over an hour for a table.  During our wait, we had a beer and a few of their empanadas. They were surprisingly delicious and left your mouth wanting more. Their sauces were also yum-mo. After being seated, I ordered the steak with onions that came with a side of rice. I was surprised the dish wasn't bigger, considering what we get at Tango Sur, but it was tasty. It wasn't exactly the best steak I've had, but it had a unique taste that I assume is Argentinian. The rice was also delicious. Also try the sweetbread which I found quite delicate.  The service was a bit poor. We had to wait a long time to get service and another long time for the food, but the live music and busy atmosphere made up for all the bads.

I think a lot of people expect steak at Argentine places to do things it doesn't.  Unless a restaurant advertises that it imports Argentine beef, they will probably get their meat from the same place other restaurants do.  Then as far as preparation... I don't know, Argentine beef is really good, so we don't do stuff to it.  No crazy spices, no weird preparation, pretty much just meat on a fire yo.

The empanadas were good, but my appetite was a shadow of what it had been a week earlier. I choked my way through part of two tasty combinations - shrimp and cheese and chicken.  My main was less impressive. I ordered the Pollo Al Ajo - extremely simple but ulimately unsatisfying. For me, however, it was adequate, as broken-hearted eating tends to render all food tasteless. The rice accompaniment was too salty, and I used my fork to fluff it rather than bring food to my mouth. It took a long time for us to get our check. I wasn't surprised as the place was wall to wall with diners and anxious eaters waiting for their tables. A decent value for simple, somewhat hit-or-miss food. I'll go back when my heart is mended.

2007-05-30,4.0,"I love the ham and potato empanada with the chimichurri sauce.  The first time I went there my hubby and I split the steak with the cheese and onions - extremely good and definately enough food for both of us after eating an empanada for an appetizer.  The last time I went I had this breaded fried steak (can't remember the name) that tasted like country fried steak - very good, but definately fattening.  Their mashed potatoes are wonderful and definately worth craving.  Their margaritas are strong and tasty.  Ambience is good - but can be hard to hear!Overall - I go here if I can split my meal!  It's way too much food - which is great, but adds up if you are on a budget.",0.9839,0.762,0.226,0.012,0.5234615384615385

2007-04-17,4.0,"Everyone always talks about the empanadas, so I had to try something else. I read somewhere that they had good rice as a side. This is very true. I told my friend who is a vegetarian to get it since there really isn't that much to eat there that is meat-less, butter-less, taste-less... The waiter told us that the paintings on the wall were done by a family friend of the owners who lives in Cuba. I forget the name, but they are quite stunning. I say that because normally restaurants have are on the walls just to fill up space whereas here it truly looks like they belong in a gallery. So about the food: the empanadas I stole off my friend's plate were pretty good, but I'm no empanada expert. The meat I had was very tender and seasoned nicely. Everything I had tasted fresh. My friend said the sangria was divine. The mojito was so nice I had it twice. It's a winner.",0.9943,0.701,0.277,0.022,0.6265384615384615

2007-02-27,4.0,"These guys do a bang-up job grilling meats, and the empanadas are delicious too.  An entree is enough for two people if you get an appetizer or empanada.  The mashed potatoes are real, with chunks of unmashed spud in there.  The sweetbreads, short ribs, and steak are all juicy and flavorful without being overseasoned.  Also we couldn't stop eating the chimichurri and other sauce on the table with our empanadas--we all wanted some bread to dip in it! Nice atmosphere as well, though some might find the guitarist playing over a backing track and art on the walls to be a bit cheesy.  The only downside is it can sometimes take a few attempts to get a waiter's attention, though they're very personable and helpful once you grab them.",0.9143,0.861,0.124,0.015,0.5977272727272727
2007-02-19,4.0,"I've never had argentinian food until tonight. And it was quite tasty. I wasn't sure what to expect, but everything I had was delicious.  I had this sausage appetizer, and it had this liquorice taste to it. And I don't really care for liquorice, but it was still good. And for the meal I had the chicken with chimichurri sauce which was awesome. I had rice with it as well, and the rice was better than I expected. Because I've been on a roll of getting really shitty rice at restaurants recently, but this broke that streak. I didn't have their empanadas, but I'll be sure to try them next time I come here.",0.627,0.707,0.158,0.135,0.5731481481481482

We arrived around 8pm on a Wednesday night and they were at least half full, which was more than I expected and a pleasant surprise. Tables are close together, but not uncomfortably so. I wouldn't say it is an overly romantic place, but it wouldn't be terrible for a date. One random observation: the rice that came along with my churrasco was very good. Too many times restaurants send out sides that are overdone, old or otherwise sub par. Love it when a place takes care of the little details, as it is usually indicative of the care that put into everything they do.",0.9884,0.724,0.276,0.0,0.5568421052631578
2006-11-12,4.0,"Mmm, you must have the Sangria when you dine here! The empenadas are all delicious. My favorites are the corn and spinach. Most of the meats have fresh garlic on 'em....yum. Don't worry, you can tell them to settle down on the garlic if you're not into it. The Milanesa el Nandu is like having a tasty parmigiana except with steak. Be sure to specify how you want your meat cooked if you like it on the rare side because by default they will cook it medium. The Traditional Potato Salad with peas is ridiculously good as well.  On weekends, they have a guitar player kicking out the jams.  It gets really busy on weekends so be sure to call ahead if you've got a group coming or be ready to wait. It's probably best to head here during lunch or for a weekday dinner. El Nandu is all sorts of good. You should go there.",0.9843,0.777,0.21,0.014,0.6166666666666666

The server came back 30 minutes later to take our order and did not even hang around long enough for me to scream over the din ""HEY THERE ARE GNATS IN MY WINE!"" - because if Nandu has more than three tables full, it is impossible to carry on a conversation.  The exposed brick, minimalist furnishings, and incredibly high ceilings give the noise noplace to go but in your ear. I can't even remember if the food was good or not, because the ambience (or lack thereof) and disinterested service overpower any memory of dinner.  Not to mention the gnats.",-0.1007,0.922,0.03,0.048,0.47919999999999996
2006-06-17,5.0,"I love going to this place for lunch whenever I can.  Its on Fullerton, right off of California.  Plenty of parking during the day. I would recommend the empanada's if you want to get a variety and stay cheap, 8 kinds.  They are all under $3, so pick 2-3 and don't forget to ask for plenty of chimmi churri sauces.  Can't stop eating it with the bread... Sooo many empty carbs, but its worth it.  IF I could only pick 3, it would be the Tecumana, Criolla, and Camarones. Take a look at the interesting paintings decorating the walls, also.  They are by the owner's/chef's wife, who also works there. The entrees are pretty generous and very delish.  My fav is the short ribs, Asado a La Parrilla.  I think their menu is very reasonable($11-$17), especially compared to some of the other places out there. BTW - They have live music Thurs-Sat nites, and you can expect to see some good dancing. Check it out.",0.9814,0.814,0.178,0.008,0.5506696428571428
