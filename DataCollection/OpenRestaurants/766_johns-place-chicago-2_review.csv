We paid $10 for maybe 12 cheese curds around the size of a quarter. There was fruit flies in our water glasses, and all over the restaurant in general. When we asked for additional condiments, we were given remarkably small proportions and were charged without being notified. The server brought my sister a salad without dressing so she then asked for oil and vinegar, but the server only returned with an empty olive oil container.

I decided I'd try it again to give it another chance... and ordered a turkey sandwich. Um... deli turkey - and not good deli turkey (I am not a deli meat snob), but this seemed to resemble the prepackaged turkey that's shaped into a scalloped round. It was flavorless... redeeming the sandwich was guacamole and sweet potato fries... I would have done better with the grocery store for turkey.  I tried a bite of the tuna melt which was not bad, but honestly, not impressed with the turkey...  Service was friendly and efficient. I may return, but would stick to the hot items as I'm guessing they take more time with those (as evidenced by tuna melt).",0.9282,0.822,0.126,0.052,0.5750000000000001

2017-06-04,3.0,"A nice quaint corner restaurant in the heart of Roscoe Village.  John's was packed inside and out on a Sunday at 2/230pm.  We were seated promptly.  The menu is small, page one more sugary/breakfast food such as pancakes & donuts, with page 2 being for the burgers.  My boyfriend ordered the Cowboy burger and I built my own traditional burger. The burgers come with Lettuce, tomato, and pickles.  I asked for no tomato.  I saw no option for raw onion, but asked if they could give me that in lieu of sauteed, which they were accomadating.  American cheese and bacon to finish it off, with a doneness of medium rare. My burger came out with just the raw onion I asked for, and was missing the lettuce and pickles.  It took a while for the waitress to bring back the missing vegetables, so my burger sat there uneaten.  When I ate the burger, it was a dry medium rare, which is a sign that when they pressed the patties, they did so too hard. My boyfriend's burger was messy with a lot of the Merkt's pub cheddar, onion jam, and chipotle sauce.  He wound up scraping his pattie off with excess toppings. All in all, John's Place is average, and nothing special.  I'm not saying boo to it, but I wouldn't consider this a must stop with all the other restaurants on this strip.",-0.9418,0.906,0.008,0.086,0.49305860805860807

I then asked about the $5 burger/fries special...she seemed to forget(even though posted 5 times on the front window). I decided to go with the burger and fries. I even asked if fries were included, she said no and charged me $3. I also ordered a malbec and sent it back since it was rancid. I switched to pinot which tasted fine, however since she was irritated with me, she gave me less than a half glass.  The whole experience sucked. The burger was less than respectful. I paid the bill, tipped $4 and asked the busboy about the special. He said he told the waitress she was wrong, but this waitress still left the $3 on the bill. I decided to not request the $3 back.

We fought hard and were determined to stop at a cool city restaurant in our old hood, when the truth is my kids were obsessed with getting a calzone from Pockets. Okay... no. Not never, just not tonight. I remembered John's Place on Webster being super family-friendly, and so I was hoping the vibe would be the same here. I figured as much, being in Roscoe Village and all, but I called ahead to see if they had a kids menu. Yep! Score!  We made the stop in, two tired hungry kids who were ready to kill each other at this point, and thankfully we found an open table. It was refreshing to walk past other families dining. We grabbed the kids menu and got to ordering right away. I was impressed with the options (see menu picture), but it's hard with growing eight-year old boys who require basically adult-sized portions, but not quite. Once the half-cup of water came out for them, we knew we were in trouble and decided to order a bunch of things off the kids menu for variety. Our waiter was super helpful to guide us with the perfect sides that they could split and mix up to make their experience fun. We ordered sliders for each of them and then a side of fries and mac n' cheese. Perfect! Of course we had to be careful to separate everything equally and not mix any spit (their request), but we managed with the request of an extra plate. I must say, the mac n' cheese rocks! It's well-seasoned and super gourmet.  We ordered fried cheese curds for the table, and I want one right now as I'm writing this! Lightly fried in a batter mixed with onions to make the flavor supreme. I ordered a turkey burger with fresh greens, Merkt's cheddar, mushrooms and avocado. Sadly, the burger wasn't for my taste buds. Just too rich and garlicky, but I tried. Hubby got the veggie wrap, and it was a ginormous portion with hummus and all sorts of veggies inside. John's Place was the first place I had ever tried a sweet potato fry in my life (many years ago), so of course I ordered those up as my side. Still soft and basic so you can really taste the potato.  Overall, our experience was lovely. But it was time to go after my son took my lemon and put it in his mouth like a boxer's mouth guard and pretended to start boxing. I don't have obnoxious kids, I really don't, but at this point we were just done. Still love you John's Place. We will be back!",0.9966,0.769,0.172,0.059,0.4975132275132274

2014-08-05,2.0,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a good place to have a burger a couple weeks ago on a Monday evening around 4:30pm. When we were seated, there was one other couple seated towards the front with their toddler. We ordered our drinks and placed a food order for A Cowboy burger with chips, and a Roscoe burger with sweet potato fries. Shortly after that, another coupe sits down at the booth next to us, and puts a food order for 2 burgers in right away.  The server gets another table seated up front, and a food runner brings our order out- to the couple in the booth next to us. Our server goes to check on how their food is, and they inform him that it isn't what they ordered. The server looks slightly panicked and then looks at us (and yes we can clearly hear this exchange of events). He asks the couple if they had touched the plates, they say yes and they're sorry.....  He proceeds to pick up the plates and then set them down in front of us while promising that the other couple ""NEVER touched the plates""..... I'm pregnant, and I was hungry enough to eat my own arm off, so we didn't say anything to our waiter about the mix up right then and there, but in retrospect, we should have. I used to wait tables, and understand that mistakes happen- but his bold face lie about the fact that the other couple had never touched the plates when we could clearly hear that they had was not only a sanitation issue, but completely unprofessional as well.  I would've rather waited for a plate that hadn't been touched on by others. The food was decent, but his plate was served to us with regular french fries instead of chips, and the burgers were both ordered medium, and cooked well. They were both so charred on the outside that it kind of interfered with tasting any of the other flavors on the food.

But one thing that always go to us...  At one point we were in there several times a week, sometimes twice in one day when I didn't feel like cooking!  The staff knew us by name, and John saw us there regularly.  Yet he never ONCE comped a single thing or so much as offered us a drink on the house.  Seriously?  I'm no expert but I would think a free drink every 5 years or so might be worth keeping some business :)   We go back maybe once a month now and all it does is remind of us why we don't go any more.  Doesn't seem so busy these days either.  Hopefully John will get the hint and make some changes.",0.9635,0.853,0.124,0.023,0.4824162552423422

Lightly toasted both pieces of bread.... Added some soggy and flavor-less sautéed spinach (that I asked for), cucumber, tomato and some lettuce.  Never got the sprouts that were described on the menu  and it did not come on tomato foccacia... It came on a regular piece of wheat toast.  By the time it reached my table the bottom half of my sandwich was drenched and soggy and not edible..... I was so hungry and did not have the heart to tell my waiter that this looks absolutely atrocious... so I opened up one side of the bread and started cutting the tofu into pieces, drenching the taste with ketchup and fries....  Being a vegetarian I knew that the tofu was absolutely not marinated in anything...It was the ugliest sandwich I have ever seen in my life.  This is NOT TO DISRESPECT John's Place... because they are great establishment...

Case in point: goat cheese quesadilla - sounded awesome, looked kind of sad, tasted okay-ish.  (plain little tortilla folded over on a small plate topped with stale scallions - no sides, no garnish, nuthin'.  There was a satisfactory amount of goat cheese, mushrooms and spinach inside...) I'd go back to John's to try other menu items - particularly their breakfast.   I've seen a good number of other reviewers mention/complain about lots of kids in these restaurants.  Yes, there were kids there even during our Friday night meal.  The place has a 'family restaurant' vibe that must be appealing, and both locations have a lot of younger families living nearby.  I'm okay with that, as long as parents respect other diners and take responsibility for their children.",0.9943,0.743,0.216,0.041,0.50501443001443

So I decided to have dinner there on Friday with a couple of friends. All of us loved the nachos as appetizer. I again went with the Angus burger which I believe was much better at the restaurant then at the festival. The only thing that I had a problem was the brunch menu. I returned back on Sunday with two other friends telling them how good it was. But to our disappointment the brunch menu did not have much on the menu.,0.9744,0.703,0.235,0.061,0.5113636363636365

I ordered the fish tacos and I felt like I was eating solidified air. The vegetables were not fresh, the fish was not even salted and my fries were soggy. My meal was absolutely tasteless but I did eat most of it because the waitress completely ignored our table so by the time our food arrived, we had been there for 45 minutes.

I had the turkey meatloaf and I could not even finish it because it was so mushy and tasteless. I think they put too many breadcrumbs in it or they just over-mixed it to the point of mushiness. A few of us got the southwest chicken salad and for the price it was not all that special. The lettuce they used was plain iceberg and aside from the dressing, the only thing that made it southwestern was the tortilla strips.  My friend got the shrimp pasta and she said it was really good. Also, the sweet potato fries they serve are delicious!  The other thing I found ridiculous about this place is that they charge $2 per person for a ""cake cutting"" charge. We have been bringing our own cakes to many different restaurant for years and this is the first place that has ever charged us for cutting the cake. On top of charging us for the cake cutting, the waitress didn't even cut it for us. I guess John's place was charging us $2 a person to use the plates, extra forks, and one big knife to cut it. I found it to be an extremely frivolous charge.  Suffice it to say, none of us will ever be going back to this place to eat again.

First, the menus give you a bad impression because they reprimand your children for being children.

Perhaps children wouldn't run around if they were offered a childseat? The Dino bite meal was like 5 dollars for 3 pieces and the worlds tiniest side. My sister ordered her hamburger  medium and was given a well-chared burger with an untoasted bun, three little tiny pieces of lettuce, and a miniature slice of tomato. I liked my black burger with the guac but it was a little undercooked. The iced teas were over priced and the waiter failed to acknowledge my empty glass so I was left parched.

We were warmly greeted by a woman who is the bartender, hostess and one of two servers. She's busy but efficient. I like the atmosphere here. It's cozy and warm. But the menu is a bit odd. It's not completely comfort food and it's not really high brow gourmet. It's weird, not in a good way. There are things like burritos! on the menu. I mean, seriously, a burrito shouldn't not be on any menu except at a taqueria. I had the cajun chicken pasta. It was okay. Too many peas, bland sauce and just average overall. The house salad at the beginning of the meal was generously portioned. The apple tart at the end was divine. I think the food is overpriced for what's served. It's basically diner food.

(My wife, who unlike myself enjoys vegetables, thought they were fine) However, the rest of the experience was great. The Carne Asada was absolutely delicious - the steak was cooked perfectly and the chipotle mashed potatoes were amazing. Both made me cry because of taste and spice. We ordered the Cornmeal Calamari for an appetizer and they were really good. I'm not sure what cornmeal does to the flavor or texture compared to other fried calamari, but we (mostly I) finished the entire plate.

2008-10-07,4.0,"So I've heard of this ""John's Place"" in Lincoln Park, although the name makes ""Sarah Plain and Tall"" look like Cher.  Anyway, when I saw it was opening a new location right down the street from me, I figured we'd give it a shot. The staff was super friendly; although it wasn't super crowded, I got the feeling they would be just as friendly under pressure.  The drink selection was fine, just the right amount of beers and wines.  I heard the menu was ""eclectic"" and, while the appetizers were (we had some scrumptious baked goat cheese), the entree menu was pretty typical and a little small, with standards like tilapia and chicken parmesan, all reasonably priced.  My fiancee got the soup and I went with the chicken parmesan.  The food took a while (the bread while we waited, however, was delicious, if expectedly so) and I got just a little worried when a table seated after us got served first. Our waitress came over to us a couple minutes later to let us know our ticket was lost and she apologized kindly for the delay.  Honestly, at that point, I didn't feel like it was long at all, especially as it was still only about a tenth of the wait for food at, say, Turquoise Cafe.  Our food came out just a few minutes later and I think I understood the ""eclectic"".  It wasn't that chicken parmesan is eclectic, but the way they prepared and presented it was.  More like ""food done eclectically"".  Either way, it was perfectly crusted and the noodles were great, albeit a tad too much tomato, but that could just be me, tomatoes being my Kryptonite. Anyway, when the final bill came, my eyes literally bugged out of my face ala Tom and Jerry, but in a good way, because it was way cheaper than I thought it would be.  That quality of food and service would be twice as much anywhere else in the city.  Of course, we didn't get drinks, so that might have helped.  But, still, for fine food, a well-priced menu, and a wonderful staff, give John's Place a whirl. My only concern is that, like the name, it may come across as forgettable.  But, even if it's not unique, it's definitely one of the best ""typical"" restaurants out there.",0.9949,0.816,0.161,0.022,0.598637165303832
