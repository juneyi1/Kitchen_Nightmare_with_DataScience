The highlight for me was the sarmale and the vinete salad, and my friends who had never eaten Romanian food before also loved it! Highly recommend to everyone.

2017-08-25,5.0,"Wow, what a great find in Irving Park/Avondale. My wife and I have driven past the restaurant several times noting we should try it out and we finally and happy we did.  This is a unique restaurant on many levels. First its Romanian with traditional and non traditional menu items. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating, (always a plus on my list). A beautiful bar at the entrance and a very classy dinning area only begin to represent the welcoming and thoughtfulness of owner and host Branko.  My wife had a Romanian nanny and was happy to see many of the dishes she knew on the menu. Service was quick to respond and friendly. We started with some fresh baked bread and a couple of drinks. I had a Romanian Beer (Tomisoreana) and my wife had a Romanian red wine, (Casa Panciu Feteasca Neagra).  We came in on a Sunday and they had a Lamb/Pig Roast (apparently its every Sunday starting at 2pm.) We went with the roasts. Straight off the pit and on to our plates accompanied with fresh vegetables two kind of dipping sauces. Both roasts were tasty, slightly smokey and seasoned right, didn't really need the sauces, but they were good.  Lamp was cooked perfectly with just the right texture and seriously right off the pit. The pork was carved from several parts, I had dark and light meat plated. FYI - The Feteasca Neagra paired perfectly with both dishes.  Branko assisted the waitress and kept everything running in the dining area. We both loved the meals but held back for the deserts (we had eyed the Dobos cake on the menu).  The Dobos cake was not overly sweet, but very moist and went well with our Romanian coffee (think Turkish style- strong). While finishing up desert, Branko came by and offered some Tuica, Romanian Plum brandy. What a nice touch. It made me feel like I was visiting some friends I never knew I had.  Needless to say, we loved Little Bucharest Bistro. We both want to try some of the other dishes and so we will defiantly come back again and bring some friends to share the feast and fun.  FYI -  Romanian Beer - Tomisoreana (*Good* Pale Lager, crisp, refreshing, some grain with a mild hop balance it out.) The Romanian red wine, ( *Very Good* - Casa Panciu Feteasca Neagra - semi-dry, deep red coloring, with characteristic of blackberry flavors, dark cherries, plums and chocolate and some vanilla notes). Again the wine was perfect with the Lamb/Pig roast.",0.9977,0.799,0.19,0.011,0.5509640905542544

Fresh ingredients abound here -- don't go in expecting a meal out of a can and a freezer. Amazingly kind, attentive wait staff, too -- seriously.  I almost felt as though I was eating in someone's home in Romania, not a restaurant. (HINT: Your waiter will likely give you gentle instructions about how to best enjoy a Romanian meal. LISTEN TO HIM. He means well, and wants you to have the best repast possible.) On a budget? Try the fixed price menu. Oh, and one more thing . . . prepare to leave this place stuffed to the gills. (Romanian food is many things, but light and airy aren't two of them.) P.S.: Tuică (the Romanian equivalent of slivovitz, a fiery plum brandy) will likely kick your ass, so go slow on the stuff.

To start, the restaurant itself is really nice inside! They have a great little bar and a nice atmosphere. After the initial impression, you will be greeted by some of the friendliest restaurant staff in the neighborhood. They were just lovely. Everyone we spoke to was super accommodating and inviting. As if this wasn't enough to rave about, THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE! Seriously, incredible. You can tell everything is fresh and made in house, and the flavor is great. The menu is really unique and I'm tempted to go back and try everything. I highly recommend the sausage stuffed chicken thigh. We almost didn't order it, since it seems a little pricey, but it is well worth the cost. I've never had anything quite like it. And to top it all off, our order was ready promptly.

Being from Bucharest, I really appreciated the atmosphere. I think the food was a little off- I treated my friends to vinete, mamaliga, sarmale, chicken schnitzel, and clattite. The sarmale and clattite were very good. If you go here, be prepared to spend some money since it's pretty pricey. Just a little tip as well- in our culture we take our time eating and talking so your server is not ignoring you, just not in a hurry. (So you may be there a while.) The owner comes by your table at the end and says he needs to bless you with holy water, he actually pours Tuica down your throat which is a really strong Romanian liquor.

He's super nice and he creates a great environment. The food is pretty good, definitely one of the better Romanian places we've been to. Romanian food tends to be a little bland for my taste, but it was all very well seasoned here.  Our waitress might have been the most annoying person I have ever met. She was either too present or she wasn't there. While we were waiting for the rest of our party, we decided to order appetizers and she immediately told us that we shouldn't order the dish because it wasn't ""Romanian"" enough and it was a dish children would order.

The service was good and the waitress, although a little awkward, was very attentive. I wish I could say more about the food, but it was just ok. My husband and I shared the chicken dinner, a salad, and an appetizer. We also each had a Romanian beer. Considering we shared an entree our total was $67! Very overpriced. Extremely overpriced.

Our desserts, crepes and some sort of cake, were spectacular.  What really made this experience special for us was the one-of-a-kind service. Branko made us feel like family from the moment we walked in. He was so helpful and fun (even giving us some free shots of ""holy water"") and our party of 7 had a great time. After our meal, we sat outside in the patio area chatting for some time, and Branko checked to see if we wanted any water. We got to chatting with him, and my 13-year old asked him where he was from. She was really intrigued, and he graciously answered all of her questions. Then he invited my kids to learn how to make kiddie cocktails, and we all had a great time talking with him.

I was recently in Romania in November, and December, and I have had a craving for Romanian food since. Little Bucharest Bistro does not disappoint. Their food it spot on when compared to what I sampled over in Romania. We had their schnitzel, which was tender and juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside. We also had their goulash was as good as any I've had. The Sarmale was the best I've had outside of Caru' cu Bere in Bucharest! The wait staff and owner were so friendly it was as if I was back in Romania. We started the meal off with a round of Tuica shots, which are just as good and potent as what I had over there. Towards the end of the meal the owner came by instructing us to tilt our heads back, open our mouths, and prepare for some ""holy water"". What was the holy water? Turns out it was more Tuica! I'll gladly accept that holy water. They even took pictures of us at dinner, and then made a special photo for me for my birthday. If you want great food at a good price with the friendliest staff around, this is the spot. I will definitely be going back as soon as I am in the mood for more Romanian food (it'll be sooner than you think!). Thank you for the memorable birthday!",0.9924,0.834,0.166,0.0,0.46352380952380945

Unfortunately, their system was down when I placed my online order to go, so I had to wait for my order a little longer than expected. However, this doesn't change how excited I am about this place one bit, if anything, it makes it even better. I am the last person to have patience with a restaurant when things like this happen, although I understand they can't be predicted. The staff at Little Bucharest was extremely helpful, and ready to make sure I am taken care of right away. So here is the story: I walked in and told them I was there to pick up my to go order, which I had placed online. When  realizing they didn't get my order, they immediately started jotting down what I needed, and called for extra help in the kitchen to get started on everything. I should also mention this was A LOT OF FOOD I was ordering. The staff was really apologetic, and told me it'll take about 35 minutes to have everything ready. I was really impressed with how caring they were, and how they took initiative to fix the issue right away. The restaurant was already really busy, I was even more impressed with how seriously they took the situation, even after I told them I didn't mind waiting.  We sat down at the bar, and they offered us a drink. Our food was ready to go in less than 30 minutes, and when we went to pay for our drink, they didn't even charge us for it. Not to mention, this wasn't just any drink, it was a delicious specialty Romanian drink, which I don't think is either cheap or easy to find in the US.  As for the food, where do I even begin? Everything was amazing. I personally tried each one of their soups, and was in awe of all the flavors. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The ""mititei"" sausages, ""Sarmale"" stuffed cabbage rolls, and ""tocanita"" dry rubbed Moldavian pork shoulder blade were to die for.  I'm in the process of moving to Chicago from Los Angeles, and I'm not going to lie, one of the first things I'm really looking forward to doing is going back to this little bistro.

The atmosphere is great, with stain glass windows and interesting decor, plus it's large and open.  The bad: The price points for some of the ""highlight"" options (pig roast, lamb, ""must-haves"") were a bit too high.

At the recommendation of the owner and the waitresses, we got a bunch of food and shared it among the table.  My favorites were the pork schnitzel, the goulash, the saganaki, and the pig roast (which they do every Sunday).   Also enjoyable was the ""flaming tea,"" which isn't tea, but rather plum brandy, but does indeed come flaming.  And the owner delivered it himself and pours it right in front of you (a little unnerving at first, but entertaining).  He also set the saganaki on fire right at the table, which was a sight to see. The desserts were also good, our group did shared plates for that as well.  It can get a little bit pricey, especially with the pig/lamb roasts, but all the food was delicious and everyone left full, as well as highly entertained.",0.9861,0.806,0.172,0.022,0.6254805996472662

We got the sausage appetizer and flaming saganaki. Both are excellent! For dinner we got the lamb and pig roast along with goulash and schnitzel. Everything was tasty, but the roasts had a little bit too much bone to meat ratio. Still, the sauces were amazing and the sides were plentiful.  We also got all the deserts except the strudel.

We had about ten people and the waitress was very efficient and polite taking our orders. Appetizers were filling, especially loved the eggplant and sausage plates. I had the Something Positive cocktail and it was tasty and strong. I was getting a nice buzz by the time he brought out the Saganaki. I've had this before at other places, but here, that flame is gigantic and awesome and we got some nice photos of the astonished faces around the table. We did a round of some very strong Romanian liquor served in double shot glasses. I sipped it throughout the meal and it gave me a nice steady buzz, though, the taste was strong and bitter. I had the meat spread plate which had a bit of everything from the in house sausages, grilled chicken breast, steak, potatoes and other good stuff. Overall everyone liked their meals, a variety of Romanian dishes served fresh, hot and very filling.  Branco then came around and served us shots from his traditional Romanian flask. For the guys, he held our heads back, poured it down and for the ladies, it was somewhat awkward for them as he pulled back their chairs, got in front of them and carefully poured it down, wiping their chin with a napkin. They felt he was ""invading their space"" but yeah, relax and have some fun. Desserts were brought out and mine had a candle in it. I went with an apple strudel type dish with vanilla, all home made and delicious. And then Branco went one step further with his generosity giving me a free bottle of Romanian wine and a group photo of everyone with Happy Birthday printed out on top.

I can see it becoming our go-to dinner spot when we want something good made by friendly neighbors.

From the outside it looks like most other neighborhood joints, but the interior is quite attractive, open and clean and nicely lit. Really great place for a party, I would think. You'll likely be greeted by Branko, and if he suggests something from the menu, listen to him. He knows what's good. He'll make you feel at home. In any case, if you order from the menu items printed in red, you cannot go wrong. We had the paprikash and the goulash along with the eggplant spread and a couple of their craft cocktails and we cleaned our plates. Everything was so delicious. Perfect for a cool fall evening, but I would eat the food at Little Bucharest any day of the year.  And if Branko offers you the ""holy water"" you should take it. Trust in Branko.

I enjoyed the village salmon, roasted beet salad, and the borscht soup. I sipped their house made white sangria with crisp fruit and a caipinrinha, a nice limey twist that's a nice change since I enjoy margaritas. They have a long list of Romanian wines, beers, and cocktails that will take repeated visits to work through. If you sign up for their newsletter you can get a free plate on your bday or anniversary. Prices are very reasonable and competitive especially for the high quality. I stuffed myself and felt great. The food is well made and feels very clean despite the richness. You can bring your dog to the patio outside. The servers and staff are very friendly and we even enjoyed a violinist who played a few pieces for us.",0.9945,0.732,0.256,0.012,0.6098666666666667

2016-09-12,5.0,"From the moment we walked in tonight, we felt right at home. Of course, this was our first time at this wonderful little place but Branco, the owner, made us feel like beloved regulars. We were greeted with some brandy and Branco recommended some Romanian Muskat wine for me which was perfect. (I loved it so much, he even gave me a bottle to take home. Something that I can honestly say is a first for me!!) The food was absolutely fantastic, completely hearty and satisfying, but not heavy in any way. This goes for all of the dishes we had- I would recommend any of them. For a group of four we ordered 3 appetizers: the roasted eggplant (fresh and light), the saganaki (fun for my 3 year old & tasty), roasted beet salad (earthy and delicious), and two entrees: the meat sampling plate (totally flavorful) and the cabbage rolls (explosion of flavor yet light- and my favorite dish!!) Perfect amount of food, and then some. Dessert was delicious as well- we ordered the chocolate ganache and the toasted almond drink, both of which were a great end to the meal.  Overall, this is going to be a staple for us when we come to visit. My son and I are from out of town, but my father and grandfather who are locals were hugely impressed. A sincere thank you to Branco for his hospitality. This place was delicious and fun - truly made our last night in Chicago a great one.",0.9986,0.689,0.311,0.0,0.647470238095238

2016-09-04,5.0,"I've lived by this place for a very long time, but it amazes me why I never tried it until last night. My boyfriend tried making reservations upon reading about how busy it can frequently get when they host parties, but thankfully we didn't need any.  We were seated immediately and inspected the one-sided menu, and right away I knew it'd be a tough choice deciding what entree I wanted. While we decided on calamari as an appetizer, for my entree I chose the village salmon dinner and my boyfriend the sausage-filled chicken thighs. I'm an avid cocktail lover, so I was thrilled to see mojitos, sangria and margaritas on the drink menu. Craving something minty and refreshing, I went with the mojito, which came in a generously sized glass and filled to the brim with spearmint leaves and slices of lime.  The calamari was superb, if you don't mind it to be a little more doughy than usual. Still, we loved it, as it was a tasty alternative to the super fried calamari you normally get at fast food joints. My salmon came surrounded in couscous and veggies and was divine; though he wished he had gone with the burger, my boyfriend ate every last bite of his chicken.  The best part of the night, honestly speaking, was the wonderful violin player. He went to each table and played a song that he felt matched their vibe, so for us he chose romantic Spanish ballads and a salsa song after we told him my boyfriend was Puerto Rican. The owner was a truly funny little guy, checking up on us regularly and even giving us a free crepe and shots of what he called ""holy water."" Hilarious! (I was so surprised he spoke fluent Spanish, too!) Our waitress was also extremely helpful and sweet.  We loved every second of being here, and the food was just a huge bonus.

2016-06-28,5.0,"One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. I've gone back since and had an equally enjoyable time. The owner/chef is very friendly and eager to please, and the decor is just the right level--not too casual or formal or excessively kitschy--plus it has a nice little section for dining al fresco and a bar stocked with Central and Eastern European items you don't usually find elsewhere.  The tripe soup (ciorba de burta) is phenomenal and highly recommended even to those who wouldn't ordinarily try tripe, as it is made in a very approachable style to the unadventurous palate. The braised short rib goulash is as good as any I've had in Europe, and the tocanita (dry-rubbed Moldovian stew) is strongly but pleasantly seasoned... if you like the taste of churrasco-style meats at places like Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, or Sal & Carvao, this will appeal to you... and at 1/4th the price of those places you could easily enjoy it more often. Their homemade tuica (very similar to the more commonly found palinka or slivovitz) is very good too. It's strong but smooth and seems to have a bit more of the plum taste than other versions of this distilled spirit. It's not for everyone, but definitely worth a try.  I would also very highly recommend their sausage-stuffed chicken thighs.  They make the polenta just right too... very fluffy, flavorful, and not too coarse or grainy, and neither dry nor greasy. Oh, and if you're there on a Sunday, the spit-roasted pig is very succulent (they have a lamb roast on Sundays too but I haven't tried it yet). There are some Filipino restaurants in the area that make a similar item (lechon baboy), but they're usually buffets (and the crispy, delicious skin just doesn't hold up under heating lamps) or you have to call a day or two ahead (e.g., catering places like Unimart) to order it.     There is honestly only a single item I've had that I wouldn't eagerly order again--the beef soup (ciorba de vacuta)--which was rather undistinguished. And the stuffed cabbage (sarmale) is very tasty too, but I wouldn't order it again only because there are many Polish restaurants in nearby Avondale serving their equivalent (golabki) quite a bit cheaper.  The menu also has plenty of options for those who prefer familiar American fare but I have yet to try them because, honestly, why would one do that when one can get bruschetta, quesadillas, burgers, pulled pork sliders, and flatbread snacks in just about any other restaurant? Really, please give this place a try. You will enjoy it. It's precisely the kinda of neighborhood restaurant that makes Chicago a great culinary city.",0.9976,0.821,0.173,0.006,0.5068044217687074

The Sarmale were perfect, the Mititei were as great as my mom makes them, they don't get better than this, mouthwatering and delicious, so delicious that we ordered another serving to go. I was like a kid in a candy store, food so delicious I just wished for a bigger stomach to fit it all in, we had 2 leftover containers, I wasn't going to waste one drop of goodness. I almost forgot how good the food was, totally worth the 3+ hour drive, definitely have to come more often. They had live music and some of the other guests even started dancing the ""hora"", very entertaining!!! Very cozy restaurant with authentic Romanian foods, definitely give it a try, my husband is an EXTREMELY picky eater and he loves the Mititei, Sarmale and chicken or pork schnitzel.

For those who wish to sit outside, there is outside seating, but having arrived early, indoor seating next to a window worked perfectly for me. Although Eastern European food is something that I prefer mostly when the temperatures are chilly, I asked my server for recommendations, while informing her that vegetarian is my first preference and seafood is my second. The offerings that I got had exceeded my expectations. For a starter, I had borscht. At Little Bucharest Bistro, there was definitely a flavouring of cooked beets from a garden that didn't leave an overpowering taste. It was also nice that the soup was full of beets and not just beet juice. Second to the table was the village salad, which consisted of red bell peppers, green bell peppers, red onions, cucumber, feta cheese, tomatoes, and olives. Drizzled with a nice balsamic vinaigrette, this was rabbit food I would welcome anytime. A light appetizer that I got next was a plate of eggplant, prepared much like baba ganoush, that was served with pita bread, a small salad, and a melange of pickles, crepes with cream cheese, and salmon. What an offering and this small platter still packed a flavourful punch that I would gladly indulge on future visits. And in keeping with vegetarian dishes, there was the vegetarian goulash. This was a hearty dish of grilled eggplant, cabbage, peppers, spinach, and garlic couscous in a tomato sauce. I was expecting something along the lines of a spaetzle, but the goulash was a classic example of different being outstanding.

I proceeded to point out that he was also calculating tip on the tax. I find it kind of ironic that by trying to prevent people from mistakenly tipping too little, he decides to include tip on tax (at an 18% rate) so that people will mistakenly tip too much. He then became defensive tells me I can tip whatever I want, and on his way back loudly says to the waitress ""six dollars is too much for them,"" which I found very rude. Never mind that what he calculated was actually $6.66. Also, the only time, the owner came out was to instruct me on how to tip - how hospitable of him.

2014-09-10,5.0,"Eat Romanian well here. Mark Twain said that the more things are forbidden, the more desirable they become.  He very well could be referring to the 'secret' menu at Little Bucharest. It took us two tries to get it, and we were barely able to order from it before the owner politely repossessed it (after realizing we weren't Romanian) and suggested we'd likely be more comfortable with the english version.  The owner, however, failed to recognize that my Puerto Rican ancestry means I eat any part of the pig, at any time, without provocation. If a pig crosses my path on the street, that pig could end up in the trunk of my car and bbqing in my cousins garage before the night is over. I digress. Also, my dining partner 'works with Romanians' as part of her job. Alas, she's not in gymnastics but tech - so her Romanian counterparts eat - well. These Romanian eaters recommended several authentic Romanian dishes to - eat - Romanian - well.  Of course the recommended dish - porkshank - I was most eager to try was also the most forbidden - appearing on the 'secret' menu but not on the english counterpart. Unsurprisingly, it was the most fabulous dish we were served. Almost equally amazing was the Romanian 'brandy'. I use quotations because the liquid was clear, and reminded me of croation/serbian liquor I've had over the years. Like the pork shank - the brandy is not cheap (8 bucks a healthy shot the shank was maybe 20 bucks), but both are well worth the price in authenticity and quality. The atmosphere was equally authentic. An anniversary party (Irish / Romanian) dominated the room, which created a relaxed dinner theater vibe. Like a reading of 'My Big Fat Romanian Wedding' the new play from... The positive feelings were overwhelming. The other items we had included the sausage, stuffed cabbage, and goulash. All of them were quite good but not even close to being as unique and savory as the pork shank. Why then did the owner so resist my pork shank overtures? I asked the owner about his resistance after our meal, and he told me that I am the only non-Romanian/Hungarian to finish the pork shank. My take, the dish is just too authentic for the casual eater. Attacking a piece of bone to unlock the marrow goodness inside may not be commonplace. But I urge my fellow non-Romanians who love pork to give this one a try, if not for its inherent excellence, then for the fact that it is forbidden.",0.9967,0.771,0.184,0.045,0.5564102564102564
2014-09-03,4.0,"A few months ago, I was stuck in traffic on Elston and, in my boredom, noticed the sign for Little Bucharest. After looking it up and seeing all of the positive reviews, my husband and I decided to give it a try this past Friday. The food was fantastic. We started with the mititei (sausage) appetizer followed by chicken schnitzel and short rib goulash entrees. Portions were pretty large and we had enough leftovers to take home for a 2nd meal. We also split the apple strudel for dessert. To drink, I had a caipirinha, which I found to be pretty weak and a little too lime-y; my husband had a mint julep, which he really loved. I actually wish I had tried one of the Romanian wines instead. We ended the evening with a ""blessing"" which was a surprise shot (of sliwowica, I believe) poured down our throats. In terms of price, you're definitely getting a good deal.  Service was very friendly and quick, but slightly odd. Branko, the owner, was very welcoming and chatty, but it seems he does a little bit of micromanaging when it comes to the servers....I don't think he let's the waitresses talk to the customers without him standing nearby. It didn't negatively affect our experience, but definitely something I noticed. The restaurant itself is much larger than I expected and they also have a decent outdoor area. There was a live singer that evening. Walking in, I expected to find mostly older Romania patrons, but tables were full of mostly American customers of all ages. I also noticed a branded, stretch limo out front, which I believe you can get for free pick up (and drop off?) with a minimum person/order amount. Definitely something to look into if you're going with a larger group!

Ashland.  I had moved away for school, and hadn't been back in a couple years.  One day (probably 12 or 13 years ago) I was back in town and I wanted to go there.  Much to my dismay, not only was the restaurant gone, but the building was a parking lot! Fast forward to a few months back.  I just happened to stumble on a check-in on my Facebook feed from an acquaintance of mine.  I had no idea that they had re-opened in a different neighborhood! I was ecstatic! I finally was in town this past weekend, and I brought a buddy of mine (who had never had Romanian food before) for a late-night supper Saturday night after a concert.  It was just excellent! So glad to be back at this place, after probably at least 15+ years. We had the beet carpaccio and mititei appetizers.  Soooo good.  The mild sweetness and round flavor of the beets were contrasted very nicely with the crunch of the toasted walnuts and creaminess of the fresh goat cheese.  The sausages were as savory and flavorful as I ever remembered, and were complimented by a nice mustard. My entree was sarmale (stuffed cabbage), and my friend had the veal paprikash.  Both dishes were served around a center of polenta filled with creme fraiche and fresh goat cheese.  Again, I think savory is the key word here.  This food is very comforting to eat.  We had a great setting, sitting outside on the sidewalk under lights.  It was one of the 5 nights a year where it's actually nice out in Chicago, so we took advantage of it, LOL.  The polenta/creme/cheese in the middle was the perfect complement to the stronger, more spiced/savory flavors of both the stuffed cabbages and the veal dish. The dobos cake for dessert sealed the deal.  Not overly sweet, with just the right amount of cool creaminess to conclude such a full-flavored meal. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town.  I plan on bringing my wife and parents in at that time.  This is my first Yelp review, but I am a longtime chowhound.  I highly recommend Little Bucharest!",0.9981,0.78,0.209,0.011,0.4945238095238095

As my partner and I are not religious folk, we were a little hesitant, but didnt want to disrespect him or his place so we said, sure.  He sat me down in a chair and from behind, tilted my head back, told me to open wide, and poured a delicious shot of something into my mouth!  AWESOME!  Go, have fun, enjoy this wonderful man's spirit and generosity.

The drinks are AMAZING, fresh limes in the margaritas (in a pint glass...SCORE) and amazing martinis.  The staff is so welcoming and nice and we never had to wait for anything.  I had the skirt steak and it was tender and delicious.

That said  So I have never eaten Romanian food in my life, never.  But I will eat any piece of edible material anyone cooks for me and get excited about things that are ethnic to me.  So I  was excitable on the way here, but really had no idea what to expect and write this having no previous reference on Romanian food. It was delicious maaaan.  I do cook a lot and I know a lot about how to blend flavors, create proper texture, and mix different food items together and this place does it wonderfully.  Really, the textures, spices, taste combinations and presentation are really masterful here.  RESPECT. Also this place is Romanian to the core.  Romanians are either generally very friendly and very quirky or very reserved and this place delivers that authentic mix of personalities.  The proprietor comes up to you right as you enter the door being very friendly and ensuring you get a nice table and then once you're seated, he'll come up multiple times to check on and tell you jokes.  I like jokes, so I reamined entertained whilst I chowed down on my food.  This was complimented by a server who didn't speak much English and was very sweet, nice, and reserved, we loved her :). When you leave, you might get an offer for ""holy water"".  Try it out, YOU WILL BE BLESSED! The only thing that was off was a bit of trouble in redeeming our yelp offer, but it did work ultimately, just be prepared for some possible hiccups if you have a yelp offer.

2014-04-22,3.0,"I'd been curious about Little Bucharest for a long time, so when they offered a Groupon, I grabbed it. There were only two tables occupied when I arrived; a deuce that was finishing and an 8-top that was just getting started. The owner greeted me warmly, seated me, and asked if I wanted anything to drink. I ordered a Stella, and requested a copy of the Romanian menu in addition to the American one. One menu arrived, then the other, then some bread, then a young girl with a bit of a language barrier wandered over. She took my food order, and came back about 10 minutes later, to see if I wanted a drink.  I told her I'd ordered a Stella 20 minutes ago from the owner, and she left again. My beer eventually showed up with my entrees, immediately followed by a water glass, more bread, a bowl of soup, various silverware, etc. Service was friendly, but I found it confusing and inefficient to have multiple people handling my table; requests had to be repeated a couple times each, and it got worse after they seated another 8-top nearby. My food was tasty, however based on the portion sizes (small), and menu prices (high), I think this restaurant is a better value for family-style dining, and larger groups do, in fact, seem to be their focus. I would have rated my meal as pleasant, or at least better than average, until I tried to pay the bill. First, we redeemed the Groupon, using my phone's mobile app, then I was handed a register printout, with a hand-written page stapled underneath, The bottom page contained some indecipherable scribbles and circled numbers, none of which matched the top, but per the printout, my after-tax total was $52.13, which equaled $22.13 once the Groupon was subtracted. I asked to put a $10 tip, plus the balance, on a credit card. $32.13 seemed like a reasonable amount to charge, and there was no mention of their machine being down, yet minutes later, my waitress reappeared, looking flustered, and asked if I could pay in cash. Fortunately, I had enough with me, so I gave her $33, with the instruction ""here is $10 for the tip and here is $23 for the balance of $22.13."" Visibly confused, the young woman pointed at the page containing the scribbles: apparently an 18% tip had already been added onto my bill as a mandatory charge, and they had come up with $31 as a total. Having worked in the service industry, I'm aware that people don't always tip appropriately on discounted checks, but asking a party of one to pay cash, while requiring an 18% tip up front, is just bizarre. It was obvious that they had profiled me as a cheapskate and/or chargeback risk, just because I was using a Groupon. The poor waitress didn't seem to get the fact that I was trying to pay her MORE than the total she was pointing at.  Awkwardly, I handed her back the check presenter still containing the $33, and tried to convey nicely that I found their policy to be a bit insulting and unusual (I didn't mention that it was also illegal). I said I knew it wasn't HER policy; I just hoped she'd pass along my feedback to the owner. The waitress nodded that yes she understood, then came back a few minutes later with $4 of my $33, saying they had agreed to lower the tip amount to 15%. I tried to explain once again, gave her back the four singles, and that was the last I saw of her. They left me sitting there for another 20 minutes, at which point I should probably have written off the 87 cents in change and gone home, but as a matter of pride, I wanted to correct the misunderstanding. I approached Branko out of earshot of the dining room, and explained. He apologized, stating that Groupon users are such chronically poor tippers that he had to make the 18% tip mandatory, to keep from getting stiffed. He also claimed that the restaurant's policies about this are clearly stated in the fine print of the certificate. They aren't (see my photo), nor are they written on the menu, and it doesn't say anything about cash-only either, but instead of arguing, I thanked him for the meal and departed. Bottom line: I probably won't return to Little Bucharest. A pricey boutique restaurant should not make its patrons feel like they're at a fried chicken chain where prepayment is made by pushing your money through a bulletproof revolving window. Other businesses somehow manage to maintain diplomacy while making discount certificates work financially, and there's no value in attracting, then offending new customers, so if Groupon deals really ARE just a magnet for nothing but the lowest class of diners, perhaps it would be better to stop offering them.",0.9687,0.823,0.103,0.075,0.45490344622697565

We ordered the salata de vinete (Eggplant salad) as a starter which was amazing and just as good as the homemade stuff from Romania. We ordered the mici as well as the sarmale. The mici were a little over grilled, but still delicious. The sarmale was great and a definite reminder of the home country.

The fish was very fresh and covered with wheat and corn flour, then fried and served with polenta and garlic sauce.  Everything that we ordered was fab-u-licious! A Little History: Back in Romania, the peasants' meal almost always contains polenta (mămăligă) which is also known as the ""bread of the peasant.""  Centuries ago, when Romania was divided into two social groups, the Boyars and the Peasants, bread was only eaten by the Boyars. Fast-forward several centuries, and the situation is different today. Mămăligă is the traditional dish for everyone, although in some towns it is not eaten daily as it is in the Countryside. A traditional combination on farms is mămăligă and smoked pork fat called slănină with garlic, chased with a small glass of ţuică. A dish associated with the life of shepherds on the hills is mămăligă with sheep-milk cheese. We really enjoyed the customer service that we received. We felt very special. My friend said she felt like a ""VIP"" at this restaurant.  They are not overly attentive. They allow you to take your time enjoying your meal and drinks, etc. and one does not feel rushed to leave. It closes very, very late (well after midnight) and it is a great place to bring friends and/or family. It is a family friendly restaurant. The Owners are always there, and they will come to your table to make sure that everything is OK. Although I am not Romanian, my very good friend is Romanian. She misses eating ""authentic"" Romanian food, so we were happy to hear from her that ""their food is very, very authentic"" and it reminded her of the foods that her mother and grandmother prepared (cook) in Romania. This is a great place to go in the Fall and Winter months when one has a taste for hearty, stick-to-your ribs, comfort food.  We'll be back for sure!",0.9961,0.857,0.137,0.006,0.6155575396825397
2013-10-07,5.0,"We have eaten here several times and always enjoy the food and our experience so much so that my wife and I decided to hold our wedding reception here for 35 people.  From conception to completion, this could not have been a smoother way to have an event. We met the owner Branko to talk about the menu items, chose some appetizers that her Bulgarian side would like and my American side would like, selected some wines etc.  A couple days before the party, I emailed him the list of attendees and their entrees so everything would be prepared and ready when our guests arrived. Even though the restaurant opens at 3p, he opened for us at 2p so we would have the place to ourselves and not interrupt his regular patrons.  The tables were decorated beautifully.  Branko and his staff greeted our guests, livened up the mood when conversation got a little quiet and played music at just the right volume so people could talk to each other.  Any minor additions where food seemed light on different ends of the table, Branko let me know and asked if it was ok to make sure those people were fed. The food came out steaming hot and all at the same time. Because the group size was only 35, I had the menu with me and brought the servers with the plates to each guest, which made it easy to tell them as the host thank you, and enjoy your meal.  Within 10 minutes everyone was eating and as the meal was wrapping up, plates were being cleared.  Outstanding performance!!  Many kudos to his lovely wife for running a smooth kitchen and his servers for taking care of my guests.  Also, by now other patrons began coming in and they were able to cater to them without taking away attention from anyone. After the meal,  Branko did his ritual of giving all of the gentleman and interested ladies a blessing of whiskey before the cake was cut.   At the end, we sat down to recap the order, prices and and servings. Branko asked me to watch him tally it up to make sure we were both on the same page. We wrapped up around 5:30 as the dinner crowd was coming in and home by 6p ...and asleep by 9 (all that wine and talking haha!)  Will definitely be coming back for dinner and also at the top of the list for group gathering.

Everyone who works there is very friendly and accommodating and quick with the service. Branko, the owner, has greeted us ever time we've come and checks up on us to make sure the food is delicious - which it ALWAYS is. The rata duck, eggplant spread appetizer, and the veal paprikash are some of my favorites. They've got a variety of beers and wines as well as some really good Romanian wine and beer as well. The dining area inside is cutely decorated with lit stained glass and they've got a really nice patio outside on the sidewalk that even allows dogs! The whole atmosphere of the restaurant is really fun and friendly. They've sometimes got musicians set up in the corner, which is really nice since the volume has never been too loud. The artists I've seen there have played everything from traditional Romanian music to the Beatles to classic pieces on the xylophone! We've never used this service, but they even have a limo that will pick you and your friends up and bring them to and from the restaurant!  Little Bucharest is nice enough for a date, but also a great place to just swing by and grab some really delicious food. They're open really late and I get the feeling that it becomes quite the party atmosphere if you're there past 11pm! Once you go, you'll definitely keep coming back!

Our entrees were to put it plainly, amazeballs.  I had the braised short rib borscht.  The meat was falling apart it was so tender.  The homemade gnocchi was also very good.  The dish came in a flavorful tomato sauce.  I was floored.  It is some of the best food I have had in a while. My bestie had the Romanian skirt steak with potatoes.  Again, we were very impressed.  Her steak was tender and very well seasoned.  It was covered in a mushroom sauce with caramelized onions.  Soooooo good.

2013-07-29,5.0,"I'm giving this place a high review for the following reasons: 1. The food was great and for a first timer taking her bf's family out for a nice dinner, this was a great not too stuffy, laid back, casual yet sophisticated place. It just hit the spot.  2. The good was spot on. Now, I'm not Romanian. Hell, not even European (I wish!) This little Asian just has a good appetite. We had the bruschetta and calamari for appetizer. My bf's father and mum had the veal paprikash who seemed to enjoy it and continuously ate it leaving only some of the polenta behind (it was a hearty meal). He had the sausage stuffed thighs and I had the stuffed cabbage. I wish he and I shared more... I really did like the sausage stuffed thighs. But the stuffed cabbage was pretty darn nabbit good so I wasn't really sharing (fair game).  (Well, I'm not going to go into every detail of every dish or this will be too long.) My stuffed cabbage was awesome. It was not soggy as a assumed it would be but firm. The cabbage nicely complemented the slightly salty sausage and the creamy buttery polenta just topped it off. It just totally jived. I wanted to eat all my polenta... all of that buttery goodness. My belly and skinny thoughts told me no. (It's okay, I totally helped myself to the bread basket. Shhh)  3. Service, getting our water refill was a little slow but one of the older waitresses noticed and called our waitress immediately ushering her to do it. So, how can I con that when they fixed their mistake? I'm all about chances and redemption. 4. The owner was this proud standing, happy go lucky man who, at the end of our meal, came with a napkin and some canteen he was holding behind his back. He said, ""At the end of the meal I like to give holy water. Why don't you have some.' I agreed and as he pulled the back of my chair, tilted my head while placing a napkin under my chin I could smell it.... it was booze. AND IT WAS STRONG. HOLY WATER WAS IT STRONG. Welp, that helped my food digest and clear my throat for sure. He proceeded to do the same to my bf and his father. His mother kindly refused and he respected that. 5. We used our Groupon Reserve voucher (30% off, hellzz yeah!) He came over with the bill, showed us our total, the included tip that was agreed upon when you use the voucher (totally reasonable), tax and then the amount that is being deducted.

2013-06-19,3.0,"We came here with the whole family and had a pretty good time on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm. I guess I was expecting a whole Romanian authentic experience and I got a glimpse of it, but not entirely. Don't get me wrong the dishes were delicious, but not all of them were authentic and specific to the Romanian culture. The service was good, even the owner came up to us a few times to make sure things were running smoothly so I can really appreciate that effort. Here are the yummies that we ordered: -Eggplant Spread- a yummy and more like baba ghanoush type spread with cucumbers, red onions, tomatos, feta cheese on a delicious and warm grilled pita. This was one of my fave appetizers but I wouldn't say it was strictly Romanian. -Saganaki-the owner brought this one out and it was okay, but come on, isn't this a Greek dish?! -Calamari-They lose a star just on this because it was the worst I've ever had, warning, do not get it here. Also, last time I checked calamari isn't exactly Romanian. -""Mititei"" Charbroiled Sausages- this is an authentic dish, sausages made with beef and pork, garlic, served with greens and crispy polenta. My family liked it but I thought it was just okay, a little too fatty for me. -House Smoked Salmon-Pickled cucumbers, red onion, caper, creme fraiche, potato cake. Super yummy, but a different version of bagel and lox? hmm, Romanian?! I don't know. -Bucharest Signature Braised Short Rib Goulash-this was the best dish of the meal, very delicious, slow roasted, in a tomato stew, green beans, pearl onions, and homemade gnocchi. Definitely a must get here!  -Vegetarian goulash -grilled eggplant, cabbage, peppers, spinach, garlic cous -cous in a tomato sauce. Also delicious, but I prefer the one with meat. Other dishes shared by my family were the pork schnitzel and the skirt steak which seemed to be just a okay. Overall, pretty decent food, some dishes more worthy than others and great service. Also, they had a live bland playing while we were there. So I was going to give them 4 stars, but it was a super hot day and they did NOT turn on the A/C. I think that's just unacceptable and if I would have known we would have chosen to sit outside and wouldn't have sweated right into our Romanian ghoulash.

2013-06-16,1.0,"I've been telling everyone who asks for recommendations on restaurants in Chicago that they MUST try Little Bucharest, but I can't say that I would do that again. Today is Father's Day - my boyfriend and I aren't celebrating because his father is in New York and I postponed my Father's Day celebration as I was attending a funeral for my co-worker's mother immediately prior to this lunch. This is important to the rest of this review.  We bought a Groupon a few weeks ago and decided to venture out today to get some use out of it. We looked at the voucher and the restrictions and it didn't say anything about not being valid on the weekends, but just to be sure, we called the restaurant to double check.  When the waitress picked up the phone, the very first thing my boyfriend said was that we have a Groupon and wanted to make sure that it was cool to use it today. She said fine and then asked if we wanted to make a reservation. He said we did and told her we'd like to come in around 3:15. She said she couldn't do it until 3:30, he said fine. We got there at 3:10 and there were only 2 tables that were seated - I don't know why she originally wanted to make us wait but it doesn't matter, we were seated right away at our choice of unreserved table among a dozen.  As soon as the waitress came by to fill our water glasses, my boyfriend showed her our Groupon, which she said would be taken when we got our check. Fast forward to the end... We got our bill and told her, again, that we had a Groupon. She said fine and that she would get it taken off our bill and told the owner - then, apparently, all hell broke loose.  He immediately came up to us and told us that it wasn't valid on Father's Day. Oops! Too bad we weren't celebrating Father's Day and didn't even think to consider this issue. We told him that despite this, we had discussed the Groupon TWICE with the waitress. After lecturing us on it not being valid and that it says that it can't be used on holidays on the Groupon itself, he said he would take it.  When he came back with our new bill, he told us that the waitress didn't recall us ever asking (which was a load of BS on her part) and then showed us the new amount which includes the mandatory 18% gratuity (for the waitress who so generously lied to save her ass and make our experience suck). We reiterated again that we had definitely spoken to her and/or the other one (not sure who picked up the phone) twice and nobody had thought to mention anything BEFORE we ate the food. He then told us again that she didn't recall and that either way, there should be no reason for us to call about the Groupon as we should have read the fine print. What this says to me is 1) he thinks we are liars, 2) he doesn't care about the two sides of the story and instead values his waitress's side so we're not all that important to him as customers, and 3) that he is going to make us give 18% tip to someone who LIED about an interaction with us. I love giving 18% tip to people who lie to make me look bad.  Here's a different kind of tip that should be totally unnecessary for the owner of a restaurant: lecturing your customers and calling them liars are NOT good ways to get repeat business. If you read many of the other reviews for this place, you'll notice that the owner turns into a vile tyrant when it comes to Groupons or any other discounts. A bonus tip for him: DON'T OFFER DISCOUNTS IF IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE GETTING KICKED IN THE BALLS WHENEVER THEY'RE ACTUALLY USED. People don't buy Groupons to use as wall art, they buy them to use them as they were meant to be used - AT YOUR RESTAURANT!

The food is only part of the review, however.  An even bigger selling point of this place (and that's saying quite a bit, considering how good the food is) is the experience, and that's what bumps this up into 5-star territory - the people and the atmosphere were fantastic.  Everyone was incredibly nice, hospitable, and happy to be there.  Along with the live music, that made everything that much more enjoyable.  The owner, Branko, is a super nice and generally awesome guy and is a lot of fun to talk with - make sure you get a chance to at least say hi to him when you go.  Really had an awesome time here, highly recommended.",0.9985,0.688,0.312,0.0,0.6819725125822687

Meh food, fmeh service, and meeeeeh prices for this out-of-the-way, uninspiring little Romanian bistro. After taking the Addison bus a block past where the sidewalk ends (Elston, as it turns out), we made our way to this inconspicuous restaurant surrounded by aging, abandoned buildings and other signs of urban decay.  Our waitress made sure our water glasses stayed constantly empty, and that she kept perceptibly long periods of time go by between her her check-ins. It must have been the huge crowd of six people in the restaurant. Even though there were more waitstaff than there were patrons, at the end they decided to surprise us with an added gratuity on the check because we used a Yelp deal.  It must have been the dinner rush that made them forget to mention this useful detail. Nbd, yolo, etc. I bought the Yelp out of curiosity to try a new cuisine, but was consistently unimpressed, from appetizer to dessert, about the quality and taste of the food--especially in light of its unwarranted (in my opinion) price tag.

We thought that would be fun and we were glad that we went. In some ways the interior design is a little funky, it could use an update, but maybe that is part of it's charm, with a stained glass window of Vlad the impaler ( of whom the Dracula figure is based on), but I guess I am taking off points though for the funky decor. I don't know much about Romania or it's food, so it was fun to try something new.  I really, really liked the borscht soup that we had with beets, cabbage, some mandarine orange, and I espacially liked the little bits of rye bred in there. For entres I had the Veal Papricash and my firend had the Braised Short Rib Guolash. We thought both were very flavorful.  Now for the Flamenco dancing and band - the dancer, Chiara Mangiameli, is an artist of the highest degree. It was mesmerizing watching her perform. Students from her school, Studio Mangiameli, were also there in the audience, eating dinner, and she would occassionally call some of them up there to dance with her.

2013-03-28,5.0,"Yelp is telling me 5 stars is as good as it gets, and yes, it's 100% accurate.  My husband and I went on a weeknight, so neither parking, nor getting a table were a problem.  So we were off to a good start. The decor of the restaurant is a mix of traditional and modern and there was soft, Romanian music in the background, which we liked because it was not overpowering. Service was friendly, professional and prompt from our waitress (I believe her name was Cristina).  As I am Romanian myself, I did not need an explanation of the various dishes, but I overheard her go through the menu with the diners at a nearby table and she was not just very knowledgeable, but also interested in their preferences and making appropriate recommendations.   In-between our courses, I was watching the owner, Branko, bring the Saganaki dish to the table next to us.  I tried to take a snapshot as he was lighting up the dish, but wasn't fast enough.  He noticed that, and, as he was walking back to the kitchen he said he would bring me one as well.  I didn't take that too seriously, but 5 minutes later he kept his promise, and had me light my own Saganaki.  I offered to pay for it, but he declined. We chit-chatted for a few minutes and he was attentive, personable and highly entertaining. Now on to the food.  We started with drinks, then we both moved on to the best borscht soup I had in years.  It was hearty, delicious and - I promise - the real deal from back home.  My husband, who is typically not too keen on beets, loved it too.  Our main courses followed right after the Saganaki episode described above.  I am vegetarian and went with the recommendation from our waitress, the vegetarian goulash.  My husband chose the chicken schnitzel.  My dish was very tasty and incredibly intricate in its presentation, with layers of sauteed veggies in-between slices of char grilled eggplant.  According to my husband the schnitzel was better than my mom's, and that says a lot, since she is an amazing cook.  The schnitzel came with a delicious spaetzle side garnished with horseradish.  Finally, we shared a generous, super-tasty and moist apple strudel for dessert. We had a $30 groupon voucher and our total bill including tip was $57 (two alcoholic drinks, two soups, two main courses and a dessert).  It may not be the cheapest, but if I want cheap food I go elsewhere.  We paid about what we expected.

2013-03-17,2.0,"Poor service and mediocre food. I spent about three months living in Romania a few years ago, and I had the opportunity to try a variety of traditional meals/food. Overall, I really like Romanian cuisine, and I have been wanting to try a Romanian restaurant here for awhile. So, I was excited when I saw a Groupon for this restaurant. I immediately bought it and asked a friend to try it out with me.  My friend and I decided to have dinner on a Saturday night. When we first arrived at the restaurant, we really liked the ambience. The restaurant has a cozy and romantic feel to it. Plus, it turned out that there was some sort of performance going on that night. There was a singer serenading the customers...kind of like a traditional Italian restaurant. But, the songs were Parisian-themed.  Before we were seated, the manager asked us if we made a reservation, and we didn't. We just assumed it wouldn't be too busy because it was the Saturday before St. Patrick's Day, and we thought many people would be celebrating at a bar instead of going to a Romanian restaurant. We were wrong, though. There were a lot of people, and that is completely fine. That happens in Chicago obviously. For the most part, my friend and I are rational and patient people. Anyway, after we told the manager that we didn't make a reservation, he seemed peeved... as if we were required to make a reservation at a restaurant. Little Bucharest is a nice restaurant, but it's not upscale dining. So, I don't understand why he was annoyed that we didn't make a reservation. If that is the case, he simply could've asked us to just wait. And, it is up to US to decide if we want to leave or not. But surprisingly, he seated us right away, which I appreciated.  Moving on... the middle part of our dinner was honestly fine. I actually enjoyed it. Yeah, the musical performance was a little annoying, but it was fun. And, I liked our waiter. He apologized that it was so busy, and tried his best to serve us. So, for that part of the service, I would give about 4 to 4.5 stars out of 5. But, I should mention that we had to get our silverware from the next empty table AFTER our food arrived. It just seems like this place cannot function when there are many customers. The food... maybe a 3 or 3.5. Our meals did not taste bad or anything, but it didn't taste quite...traditional... or Romanian. However, that's understandable since on Yelp, the cuisine is described as ""Modern European"". Also, my dish was a little cold. Simply put, the food was just OK (I ordered the sausage-stuffed chicken thigh, and my friend ordered the sarmale). Now, I'm going to explain the last part of our dining experience. This is where it starts to go downhill. My complaint is mostly directed at the manager of Little Bucharest.  After we finished our meals, the manager came over to our table and said how we should make a reservation next time, and how because of us, he lost 4 tables. Now, I'm not sure if I took this the wrong way because of his English, but really, his English wasn't even that bad. When he said this, I was so shocked at his blunt rudeness that I was kind of speechless. I just said ""Ok..."" But, here is what I would really like to say to him:  It is not OUR problem that he lost 4 tables. HE is the one who seated us right away. He just had to ask us to wait. Again, it is our decision if we want to wait, or if we want to leave. He does not have the right to complain to us like that. And, it is very upsetting that the manager said this, and not a server. Because, who the heck would I complain to?? I wonder if he treated us this way because we used a Groupon. Well, if that's the case, don't advertise your restaurant on Groupon.  Then, when I tried to pay for the meal with my credit card, the manager asked me if I had cash on me. And, I did, but I wanted to use my cash for drinks after dinner. Isn't the form of payment the customer's choice?? Anyway, I asked why and he said, ""It's ok to pay with credit card, but your bill isn't that much."" Maybe it's because I was so pissed off about his previous comment that everything that came out of his mouth just seemed wrong to me, but he just seemed to be very condescending when he told me that I should pay with cash.  Even though the service from the manager was poor, I still tipped based on the actual price of the meal because again, I did not have a problem with the server. I like to be fair. But, I must say, the manager of this restaurant is rude and does a pretty poor job of running his business. What a disappointment.",0.9841,0.782,0.128,0.091,0.4751322751322752

2012-12-13,3.0,"We drove by this place 1000 times before finally stopping in to see what was behind the limo, fake waterfall and orange paint. Not knowing anything about Bucharest, we did not know what to expect. Turns out Bucharest is the capital of Romania. So the traditional Romanian cuisine, from an American perspective, seems to borrow from Russia/Ukraine and also Austria/Germany. The service is extremely concerned about your experience, attentive and welcoming, almost to the point of nervousness. They really want you to feel at home. The dining room is nothing like the outside suggests. Being in a triangle building you might expect to have an awkward seating arrangement, but the kitchen is actually in the narrow part, the seating is in a much larger room in back. It's almost feels like a Euro lodge you might find on a mountain. But exposed brick in an aging building keeps you grounded in the Avondale hood of Chicago. Not really fancy, but a nice big open room. Not entirely aligned with arriving by limo. My wife loved the stuffed cabbage, I enjoyed the braised short rib. The warm borscht soup was perhaps the best I have ever eaten -amazing. The wine list is disappointing. There are some Romanian wines which I didn't care for, and some ""world"" wines of Australia, Italy  and Argentina. I was left wanting for some California, Spanish, or French options. Maybe this is more of a beer place? Vodka? It was a little slow mid-week, but surprisingly that didn't detract from the experience as it does in some other restaurants with smaller capacity. I'm guessing the weekend is jumpin' due to the capable P.A. system and the accordion on the wall. I bet this place is very popular with Romanian-Americans, but I would recommend giving this place a chance no matter where you're from.

I also got to try the calamari (pretty standard but enhanced by the paprika aioli), the vinete eggplant spread (essentially Romanian baba ghannouj, very good), and the salata de varza (basically a kind of cole slaw, pretty good), as well as my mom's leftover stuffed chicken thigh (as great as I remembered, even two days later). My entree decision will always begin and end with the goulash and chicken thigh, but if you want to see some additional options, ask for the Romanian menu.  There is some overlap, but it features many items which the regular menu does not.  My semi-vegetarian wife found some satisfying choices among the soups and salads on the Romanian menu. Service was very good again, although Branko was not in the restaurant until later.  The two servers attended to the entire restaurant with alacrity and good cheer, including a very large party of birthday-partying Romanians.  Branko came in later and came right over to them as if he knows them (I assume that he does) but he still made time to greet our table twice within about five minutes.  He shook our hands, introduced himself, and asked how our dinners had been.  I'm glad that he came in before we left, so that my folks got a taste of what makes this place special--besides the incredible food, of course.",0.9951,0.805,0.19,0.005,0.5639579386131109

My wife and I were planning to dine here for our 3-year anniversary, but naturally we chose Tuesday for our date -- the one night each week when Little Bucharest is closed.  The restaurant was locked up when we stopped by. I peeked through the window and was ready to head back to the car when Branko opened the door and walked out onto the sidewalk. Before I could say anything, he shook my hand warmly and apologized for being closed. No big deal, I said. It was my mistake for not calling ahead or checking the website.  I mentioned that it was our anniversary, and Branko broke into a big smile. He insisted that we follow him inside and enjoy a glass of wine on the house.  We were both taken aback by his generous offer of hospitality. I looked through the doors and saw a laptop and a sheaf of papers at the bar -- he was clearly doing paperwork during the one non-busy day in his week. But again, he insisted.  We followed him inside and he sat us down right by the window -- nevermind the headaches that might be caused by having the two of us drinking and laughing where passersby might see us and wonder if the place was open. Branko turned on the lights and fired up the music system and brought us out two glasses of white wine. Then he quietly returned to his paperwork, leaving us to enjoy our glass of wine. He was the consummate host the entire time, and he firmly refused my attempt to pay for our wine on our way out (had to try, right?). His exact quote was: ""Two free glasses of wine aren't going to make me poor."" Of course, we resolved to come back on a non-Tuesday to actually dine at the restaurant.

My husband is American but likes our cuisine. The food was ok. The eggplant spread was mediocre, my mom makes a lot better one. The mititei and the polenta were really good though. For main courses, I got the stuffed cabbage and it was pretty good, slightly too salty though (and I love salty). My husband got the Veal Paprikas and it was excellent. For desert he got the appe strudel and it was excellent. I was very excited to get an old time favorite, the Dobos cake. Well, this was nothing like the Dobos I know .The real Dobos should have very thin layers of cake, and many of them. This only had a few thick (and some slightly burned) layers of cake. The taste was not too bad though, it somewhat resembled the real thing. The prices are really hight . Our  meal came to about $85.00 or so. We did have a yelp deal of 20 for 40, so that helped. The owner asked me if I wanted him to add 18% gratuity on the bill. I told him that I do my own tipping after. He then proceeded to give me a lecture on which amount I should tip on. I told him that  tipping in the USA is not mandatory, only recommended and it needs to be earned with good food and good service (which we got both, relatively speaking).

I actually found the restaurant from a deal on  savored.com .  Boyfriend and I weren't sure what to expect from Romanian cuisine, but we glanced at the menu before we left and then wikipedia'd a bunch of stuff about Romania on the car ride over.  We're not picky eaters and love a new food adventure and we were not disappointed. We ordered the roasted red pepper appetizer - I highly recommend this.  It was simply devine.  I used the bread that came with to soak up every last bit of seasoning. Boyfriend ordered the chicken thighs and I got the goulash.  The portions were plenty and the flavors were really great.  Again, not being really familiar with Romanian cuisine, it felt like a perfect blend of Mediterranean and German - hearty but not heavy, simple but not bland. When we arrived it was pretty empty, but there was an enthusiastic guitar and violin duo serenading the other table. The ambiance was just lovely, I felt like I was in a bygone era.   This is what REALLY sold this place for me.  The owner and entertainers were so genuinely enjoying themselves it was impossible to not share their enthusiasm.  The musicians played some polka and another table got up to dance, when another table arrived we found out the woman in the group had a beautiful singing voice.  I was laughing and clapping the whole night.  I just haven't had such a wonderful experience in long time, it was really fun.  Finally, since we had a savored deal, which is relatively uncommon, it did take them a bit to figure out the schematics of the discount, but the owner was so kind and apologetic that we didn't mind sticking around a little bit longer because we felt his service was so good.

I had the kataifi wrapped shrimp. I asked what kataifi was before ordering, and it's basically like a super thin noodle of puff pastry. Whole grilled shrimp were wrapped in the stuff, and it had both a texture and flavor I'd never experienced before. It was really good, as was the garlic and spinach couscous served with it. My husband had the sausage stuffed chicken thigh. I had a taste, and it was really good too. The portion size was generous (both were, actually), and the blend of the creamy polenta and sweet tomato sauce was delicious. I did think the chicken-sausage ratio was little off (much more chicken than sausage), but that was the only knock against the food all night. We had a Blackboard Eats coupon code which gave us 30% off the bill. We had no issues with the discount itself, but how they added the 30% was a little odd. They totaled everything (meal and tax),  added an 18% gratuity, then took 30% of that total amount.. A little weird, but it wasn't a deal breaker. I would have given 5 stars, but the emptiness of the dining room was a little off-putting. For most of our meal (on a Friday evening), we were the only ones in the whole restaurant. Another couple arrived as our check was brought to us, but it was a little weird being the only ones there. Also, I thought their prices were a bit steep. All things totaled, we paid about $45 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a beer. And that was after the 30% off. Definitely buy the yelp or some other deal before you head here. They don't have a private parking lot or anything, but we had no trouble parking directly on Elston, and as a bonus, it was free to park (no annoying parking meters there). When we left, Elston was getting pretty full, but parking should still have been easy as the side streets don't require parking permits. On our way out, we noticed a cute little outdoor eating area.

2012-07-25,5.0,"Over forty years ago, my friends and I often dined at Little Bucharest, located at that time at about 3500 N. Ashland, in corner building.   The front of the store was a large bar area, also used for parties, and the tables for dining were in a very small room at the back, with about eight tables.  A very small kitchen in between gave a glimpse of a grandmother figure, cooking in steaming pots and pans, with great smells emanating from the room.  The food was amazing in taste, quality and quantity. Goulashes, Schnitzels, Stuffed veal, Mammaligi, and often wild game, such as rabbit.  The deserts were incredible....Tortes a foot high, filled with chocolate. (my cousin ordered one of their giant tortes as her wedding cake, which was devoured by the guests before she could even get a bite.)  Great Romanian music played on a juke box out front. People naturally became friendly in the small room, and I remember a date asking a perfect stranger for a taste of her dish, and then returning the favor when our dishes arrived.  When it became popular it was remodeled and the front part became the dining area and the former dining area the kitchen. The food remained wonderful.  The atmosphere great , as we marveled at the mosaic windows of pictures of Vlad the Impaler and other Kings of Transylvania.   About ten years ago, the place closed, I thought, and I heard nothing of moving elsewhere.  But I guess it had, for recently I discovered it, on Elston Street.  It was a great find.  The windows are now inside as decorations and the restaurant has live Romanian music, and many of the old dishes I remember.  Again, the quality and quantity are amazing. You won't leave hungry for sure. My mother would have been proud to see me somehow finish a meal of goulash and mammaligi that would have fed three people. The Romanian wine was great, as was the Romanian coffee. The deserts were smaller than forty years ago, but just as wonderful.   The last night that my gal and I were there the place was empty. :(  Of course, it was 100 degrees outside and maybe that's what kept people from eating out.  And the owner sent over a free bottle of wine to thank us for dining there that night.  I sure hope that that was the reason because the restaurant is great and you will be very happy .... and full .....after dining there.",0.9954,0.83,0.157,0.014,0.586178130511464

2012-06-18,2.0,"We went there this past Friday night (6/15/12) with a $20 voucher from Living Social, which was enough to cover the cost of one of our entrees. This place is only a few blocks from home, and we've been wanting to try it for some time. As soon as we walked in, we experienced the wonderful aromas of all the delicious foods being prepared in the kitchen. The waitstaff was friendly enough, although it seemed as though every waitress in the building was taking turns at our table, probably because there were only a few other patrons dining at the time.  The food was delicious -we had the Braised Short Rib Goulash & the Pork Schnitzel- but the servings were a bit too conservative for the price, in my opinion. Perhaps I've been spoiled by large Western portions my entire life, but if I'm laying out that kind of dough for a meal, I not only expect to be full (we were) but I also wouldn't mind taking a doggy bag home to enjoy later, so as to relive the wonderful flavors one more time. Had we not had the discount voucher, I would not have elected to pay the comparatively exorbitant prices(s) for dinner. Also, since we did have a coupon, the waitress asked us if we'd mind if she ""added the tax & tip"" before subtracting the voucher. This took us both completely by surprise, as we'd never been asked such a thing before. Thus we were caught off guard, and agreed that that would be fine, thinking she meant to include the tax on the full total, and then we would know to add the gratuity according to the pre-discounted amount. Having worked in the restaurant industry, I fully appreciate the astonishing frequency with which servers get stiffed, so I had no problem tipping on the full total. But when she brought back the bill, it seemed as though there'd been a funny bit of jiggery poker with the numbers, which made us both feel as though we were being fooled by some subtle sleight-of-hand attempt to bilk more money out of us. She added her own tip, which seemed very presumptuous (typically a gratuity is only added to the check for parties of 6 or more), but it turned out to be less than we would've wound up tipping had she simply allowed us to do so on our own. That being said, perhaps the waitress learned a lesson that night. Also, there was some live music entertainment, which was delightful. But the silence between songs was deafening, which made for awkward conversational pauses, because it seemed as though everyone in the whole place could hear us, including one of the waitresses, who was casually eavesdropping as she repeatedly walked by our table. She even banged into a chair at one point, because she was paying more attention to our conversation instead of where she was walking. Finally, when the bill was brought to us, there was an envelope ""for the entertainment"" with a ""suggested donation"" of $5-$10 PER GUEST. As a performer myself, I understand wanting to be compensated for my services, and I'm not normally opposed to a ""pass the hat"" situation. But at a ""nice-ish"" restaurant like Little Bucharest, I don't expect to be hit with a cover charge like that, ESPECIALLY with such overpriced menu items. Again: rather presumptuous. If the owner can't afford live entertainment (or just chooses not to pay the performers), then perhaps an iPod or CD would be a better choice.

Evironment:  Nice and clean.  It seemed like it wanted to be nicer, but wasn't quite there.  Very good live music. Service:  Generally good, it was not busy, and a lot of the staff helped. Price:  Very Expensive for the quality and amount.   Pro's:  Extremely good ethnic food. Con:  They left an envelope with the bill suggesting a $5 - $10 tip for the musicians, PER guest.  Wha?!? Con:  The server asked us a strange question when we asked for the bill.  She asked, ""Would it be alright if I add Tip & Tax to the bill before I subtract the coupon?""  For some reason, we agreed immediately.  I assumed that she just wanted to Authorize the total amount before subtracting the coupon, and allow us (the patron) to add gratuity.  I'm sure servers get stiffed on tips because the total is less after a coupon.  Anyway, she added 20% tip to the bill before even running the card.  It was weird.  We left it as is, but it left us with an uncomfortable feeling.  A table near us made her take the tip off completely.

Not so great: - Wine and drink pours were pretty teeny.  I don't think I got a full 5 oz of the house red in my glass. - The entrees were overpriced.  Thank God we had the Groupon because three drinks, an appetizer, a soup and one shared entree ended up costing us $80! -  The restaurant automatically charged the tip, which seems to be a trend with Groupon users.  I'm not loving that.  I almost always add at 20% tip for service anyway, because I know how much work it is, but I don't like it being forced on me with a dinner for two. - The stuffed chicken thigh, which was ""required ordering"" since they won a Time Out award for it a few years back, did not wow me.  I found the chicken and polenta to be too mushy, and the tomato sauce to taste generic, almost like Pace Picante salsa!  It was a little disappointing.",0.8593,0.753,0.154,0.093,0.5634773662551439

We each had a glass of wine; both small and untasty.  Wife ordered the ""Mititei"" appetizer of little, grilled sausauges which she barely touched, feeling them to be rancid-tasting.  We should have split a salad and gone for a nice, import beer. She also had  the stuffed cabbages--pale and tasteless; nothing like the good ones we had both grown up with and had eaten in Europe. Skip them both.  I chose the Romanian Skirt Steak in medium-rare, a dish I've enjoyed elsewhere, which seemed OK to me, smallish but tender and juicy; but wife felt that mine, too, tasted a bit rancid.  I was hungry and ate it anyway, but I got her point: one can do a lot with seasoning. This, to me, was basically a 2-3-star ""tourist trap"" surviving on promotions incl. limo rides, but dropped one, big notch when the bill came.  Our waiter had added his own tip onto the undiscounted price (which is how I would have figured it anyway) and placed it onto my bill and my credit card draft.  We in Chicago don't treat our public that way except for groups of six or more.  Luckily, I caught that, let him have what he'd given himself, but nothing more.   At bottom, I think that this is a trap for the unwary who don't know the cuisine or read the bill.  Many of its reviews look far too positive.  A far better restaurant in somewhat similar style (Czech/Bohemian) would be ""Restaurant Klas"" in Berwyn for those willing to drive there.  I would not return here and would not recommend it to others.",0.984,0.807,0.134,0.058,0.6486320346320346

2012-02-16,3.0,"I've wavered back an forth on this review for awhile - for me Little Bucharest is between three and four stars.  I finally settled on three; I'd definitely go back to Little Bucharest, but I have some definite hesitations. I first went to LBB a few months ago for dinner with a girlfriend. (Free) parking was a snap, which is always  awesome.  This was a weeknight so the restaurant was fairly empty and quiet.  We started with the eggplant spread which is absolutely delicious - I highly recommend.  For a main I had the chicken schnitzel even though I realize it's not Romanian.  The spaetzle that is served with it was awesome, but the schnitzel itself was pretty pedestrian.  I thought that at $18 the dish was overpriced.  We also tried a dessert (can't remember which, helpful, I know) that my friend and I agreed was great.  Overall we were both of the same opinion that our appetizers and dessert were far more impressive than our main dishes.  We had some sort of Groupon, but even with that I thought the meal expensive. Flash forward to a recent Friday night and a large group of my friends and I find ourselves at LBB for dinner.  Parking was again easy but there were far more patrons and the owner (he of the shot in the mouth pouring fame) was there.  We started with the mititei sausages (meh - very skippable) and saganaki (great, but when is it not?).  I also ordered a caipirinha cocktail which was delicious. The owner stopped by my table to ask how the drink was and then tasted my drink (using a different straw) to be sure he put alcohol in it (he had).  He then asked if I wanted more booze in it.  Um...yes?  So far so good!  For a main this time I ordered the veal paprikash.  This was immeasurably better than the schnitzel.  I would return to LBB for this dish alone.  I will say, though, that at the end of this meal (again with coupons) I still felt LBB was a little overpriced.   Then came the time for after dinner shots.  The owner came around pouring shots in people's mouths.  In theory, awesome.  In practice...uncomfortable.  As he was pouring he was making sexual jokes with all of us and was being very hands on.  I don't love strangers touching me and I just found the whole exchange unpleasant.  Lest you all think I'm some kind of up tight prude, note my review for burlesque lessons.  I'm all for fun, but this was just kind of icky.  It also set me on edge - I was actively looking over my shoulder waiting for him to reappear (he did - and was able to physically push my chair from my table before I was able to tell him I had to drive and didn't want to drink anymore).   I think my friends actually really enjoyed the owner so this is definitely a your mileage may vary, personal preference sort of thing.  Overall, LBB has good food (and great veal) but the price point is high (hence the constant coupons/deals) and the owner may not be to everyone's taste.",0.9986,0.771,0.19,0.038,0.5752681577681579

2011-11-27,5.0,"Went here for the first time with my boyfriend after searching on Yelp for an interesting nearby restaurant that we hadn't tried yet. When we got there, there weren't many people in the restaurant but those who were there looked like the local crowd. There were 2 minstrels playing music, and a comforting decor with stained glass on one wall. So far so good. We ordered some drinks and dinner, and were surprised to see that on the back of the menu, there was a large advertisement for a free limo ride to and from the restaurant for groups of 6 or more. I can't remember the names of what we ordered that night, but we were so happy with both of our meals that we swore to come back and do the limo ride.  As we were looking at the dessert menu, the owner of the restaurant came around and out of nowhere, tilted my head back and poured a shot of homemade plum brandy in my mouth and then did the same thing to my boyfriend! We were laughing hysterically because we were so caught off guard, but that made me want to come back even more :)  A couple months later, we had plans to get together with 2 other couples for dinner, so I suggested Little Bucharest Bistro. We called to make a reservation with the limo service, and they did not disappoint. They were on time, picking up the 6 of us from a wrigleyville apartment, they let us take our drinks with us in the limo (which was also fully stocked), and graciously sat us as soon as we arrived. The dining room was much more crowded (it was a Saturday night) and there were once again 2 minstrels playing music. Everyone loved their entrees, were excited about the plum brandy shots after our meals, and this time we had a couple more surprises. The owner came out after our meal and stared clapping, so everyone else in the restaurant clapped to the same beat. He walks over to me, LIFTS me out of my chair, and carries me to the front of the room where there is a pile of dishes on a chair. With everyone still clapping, he takes a glass and smashes it on the floor toward the front room. He handed me a plate and I did the same! So much fun and hysterical. Before we left, he came over and thanked us for coming.  I absolutely loved eating here, for the amazing food and the great atmosphere.

It appeared to be short of staff that night. You had one woman waiting on 10 or more tables. The bartender had to come from behind the bar area to take our drink order. It was 9pm by the time our food arrived. To make matters worse, we had some jerk sitting at the table next to us complaining the entire evening, not only about the staff but also the owner. He simply would not shut up. Then he had the audacity to make sexual comments toward the only young lady waiting on tables. All the while, I just kept feeling sorry for his wife sitting at the same table with him. I think the owner should have asked him to leave. The food did take long but one dish may have been worth the wait. It was the strip/skirt steak. Perhaps about 16oz. garnished with baby potatoes and one piece of broccoli. If they added more of the sides, it would have been perfect. Another dish they should have garnished with more sides was the sausage wrapped in chicken. Tasty as it was, it lay on a thin bed of mashed potato. You can hardly tell it was there, it looked more like an appetizer than entree.

On a rainy, crappy, cold Sunday at the tail end of summer, this place really seemed like it'd hit the spot. We skipped on starters because we weren't totally starving, but they all sounded really tasty so we'll definitely be getting one next time. Instead, we opted for a couple of beers to go with their freshly baked bread, YUM. Crunchy on the outside, perfectly dense and chewy on the inside, and still slightly warm from the oven. Damn. Just one bite of that was enough to convince me I'd be back, and oh, will I ever. Our entrees came out very quickly. The presentation was lovely! My boy got Sarmale and I went for their award-winning sausage-stuffed chicken thigh. Let me tell you, growing up in an Eastern European household myself, I've become somewhat jaded when it comes to the general cuisine of the region. Romanian food, however - or at least Little Bucharest - totally exceeded my expectations by a long shot. Really original, contemporary and delicious. Everything had so much flavor and the gorgonzola polenta is my new addiction. You absolutely NEED to try it. If it doesn't come with your meal, get it on the side. Usually we are too full to do dessert, but the quality of the entrees convinced us we had to. Our sweet of choice was the chocolate/Nutella crepes and naturally, they did not disappoint. How are the gals that work here so slim?! Just as we were ready to pay our bill, the owner, Branko, made his way to our table to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Ummm YES. He was incredibly gracious and genuinely thrilled to hear how happy we were, and told us to wait a moment so that he could grab us a treat. A few minutes later, he came back and POURED BOOZE DOWN OUR THROATS! My boyfriend almost burst out laughing when he saw the bottle coming because I am the world's only Polish girl that can't take shots; however, this stuff was uh-may-zing.

This time I came back with a few partners in crime for our mini class reunion. Here's what we ordered: ***Appetizers*** 1) Mussels - The bowl and portion was ginormous, but I think it should've been a little more thoroughly cooked.  2) ""Saganaki"" Oppa! flaming kasseri cheese - Blazing. Sodium-rich. Mouth-watering.  ***Entrees*** 1) Sausage-Stuffed Chicken Thigh  2) Chicken Schnitzel  3) Braised Short Rib Goulash - The short rib was very well marinated with each bite bursting with juice and flavor. Aggressive. Loud. Savory.  4) ""Sarmale"" Stuffed Cabbage - This is a very unique dish. Delicate leaves of cabbage wrapped around minced pork/beef made every bite go from crisp to lisp. Why? Keep your mouth shut and keep chewing until you finish every bite of the delicacy.  ***Desserts*** 1) Apricot crepes - Hmm...should perhaps go elsewhere for crepes.  2) Strawberry crepes - I'm not a fan for their strawberry jam.  3) Fruits with white chocolate It's always nice to dine with a group because you can take a bite from everybody's plate and try different dishes. (Unless people guard their plates with steak knives.)  It was a blusterous night for LBB. In addition to our group, they also had a meetup and birthday group. Branko and the wait staff were panting for breath as they ran from table to table to put up with their best service. They definitely didn't let us down with their efficiency and vigor.   P.S. We purchased a  restaurant.com  $50 gift certificate for this visit. The minimum purchase is $100 and there is a 18% gratuity add-on. Our group had seven people but Branko didn't include the gratuity until we gave him the gift certificate. He doesn't like to enforce a strict gratuity rule for parties over six.

Particularly when it is one kind of meat stuffed with a different kind of meat. That's a whole lot of meat! Welcome to Eastern Europe! I've passed Little B at least a handful of times a year since I moved here in 2008. It caught my eye the first time and begged me to give it a try when they revamped. It looked very intimate and inviting from the outside, but for some reason I was expecting it to be more divey and casual. It's actually a very romantic and classy place. Great for a date night or special occasion. A bit pricier, but still within reason for the quantity and quality. Kelz M. and I came here for their Mother's Day Dinner special. Her children are in different states, my mother is in California, and we just needed a good excuse for a ladies' night. This wasn't far, so I suggested it and happy I did. We split the polenta with sour cream and shredded white cheese, saganaki, sausage-stuffed duck and Hungarian goulash. Everything was fresh and delicious. The polenta was thick and flavorful, but very light. The duck was cooked to perfection and the seasoned sausage complemented it. The grilled peppers added a little extra spice and brought out the flavors. I loved all of it and enjoyed the leftovers the follow day. We were serenaded by a violinist and guitarist. Little known fact, this particular entertainer was featured in the movie Return to Me. He'd sing a little, they'd play a little and then he'd chit-chat with us in between. Also, he knows many Romanian and Italian classics, plus some throwback American and even popular Jewish and Yugoslavian songs! How cool is that?! I rounded off the night with a dessert. Their European style chocolate and cream cakes are to die for! Totally worth adding on to the end of the bill. It was about $80 for the both of us with our appetizers, drinks, full meals, dessert and entertainment. Like I said, kinda pricey but perfect for a night to remember.

They used to have an amazing shrimp dish, but as of May 2011 it was no longer on the menu. Secondly, the staff is very friendly, but we always seemed to get overlooked. Maybe we don't look like big spenders, but I always see the owner chatting up the guests meanwhile our drinks are forgotten. Our server was quite sweet and apologetic about our long wait for food & drinks (on this particular night she had a huge party and the place seemed to be understaffed) but this has happened before.  I do enjoy the lively atmosphere, the Romanian beer & wine options, as well as eating something outside of my usual comfort zone.

2011-05-04,5.0,"After reading some of the reviews here, I've come to the conclusion that Americans aren't used to being pampered and well-treated at restaurants. At restaurants in America, you are basically seated, visited for a drink order, visited for a food order, given your food and left alone the rest of the time. It's an effective system but an anonymous and sterile one as well. In Romania a ""restaurateur's"" main job is to make you feel at home, feel cared about and deliver excellent service. The owner and servers of Little Bucharest use their wit, charms, and knowledge of good customer service to bring European-style dining to Chicago. On slower evenings, the owner himself will dote on you, make recommendations for the unsure and jolly you along with good humor. Some may see this as an overly intense concentration of service, but fail to grasp the full experience that Little Bucharest is trying to provide. The owner has gone to great lengths to bring customers a relaxing, beautiful, and classy dining experience, from the gorgeous stained glass interior art to the live troubadour music. The food is plentiful, prepared and arranged with care, and tastes like only the best ingredients are used. The bar is stocked and the hot drinks are flowing.  The mood lighting is romantically dark, giving your meal an intimate feel but can be brightened for a party atmosphere. Your needs will often be anticipated, and if you can suspend the natural standoffish nature of casual American dining long enough, you may find yourself developing a friendship with the servers and owners. THAT is a true rarity in Chicago dining, a restaurant that cares to know you better, rather than just making contact with your wallet. I've tried Little Bucharest Bistro as an intimate date night location and I can't wait to try it again with a group for some serious merrymaking. Such potential!

The place is has a lot of character, quaint decor, a friendly staff. The food was very filling. For two people, you can definitely get away with sharing one appetizer and two entrées. No need for a soup or salad. No room for dessert to be honest. We had the two recommended items on the menu. The Short Rib Goulash and the Sausage Stuffed Chicken Thigh. Can't go wrong with either. Again, very large entrées here and more than filling.  The live music was a big downer the night we dropped in. It was basically Eastern European dance music played on a backing track with a live singer. Lots of feedback from the mic, waaaaayyy too loud. We really thought that was going to wreck the evening for us. Perhaps this is what we get for eating so late. Maybe it was just a reflection of the big birthday party going on that night.

I wasn't sure what to expect given the location but I'll try anything when it comes to restaurants. When we got there, we were one of two tables but by the end of the evening, there were a decent amount of parties to make for a pleasant atmosphere, especially with the great music. The lighting, as the night wore on, created an intimate ambiance for our dinner which quickly turned into one of the most fantastic evenings we've shared out.

The service was a bit slow as others pointed out, but they claimed they were down a waitress for the night so I'm not deducting for that.  They had 2 waitresses for ~7 tables, one of them a party of 20.  So I felt it was reasonable.

2010-10-31,1.0,"Is it possible to give negative star ratings? This was straight up fraudulent. The polenta: the cornmeal itself was actually good. The problem is that the menu says ""creme fraiche and feta"". In reality it was crema mexicana (sour) and some cheese that was more like a queso fresco, not feta. It tasted good, but why the lies?  The ""Saganaki"": this was poor execution. Crispy on the outside, as it should have been, but the center was dry and hard. Not creamy and smooth the way it should be. My fault for ordering this dish at a Romanian restaurant, though.  The Signature Dish (braised short rib goulash): This was the biggest dissapointment, and the most fraudulent dish of all. For one, who makes goulash with no trace of paprika, or salt for that matter? Second, the ""short rib"" was actually a completely dried out, over cooked cut of beef that was certainly not a short rib. You can tell by the grain of the meat, all wrong. Regardless of what meat it actually way, how can short rib be chewy and fatless? Third, the ""tomato stew, beef jus"" was actually just tomato water, not jus. Fourth, the ""ricotta"" gnocchi did not have the light, fluffy texture that you get when you make them from fresh ricotta. Instead they were clearly made from potatoes and were doughy and heavy, like the frozen garbage you'd buy at Dominick's.  The wine: The list was sparse, and they were out of their Romanian cabernet. So instead we reluctantly ordered the Sangre de Toro, $36. Again, why the rip off? You can get this bottle at Foremost Liquors for $7. That means we paid more than 5 times the shelf price for a very mediocre wine. Even in the best of times restaurants can't get away with a 5x mark up. This was insulting. To sum up, the menu grossly misrepresented the food we were actually served, and we were way overcharged, more than $100 for 2! And, my wife ate only vegetables.

So, I cannot speak to that, although I've been here enough times that I think eventually I'll come back during dining hours and have dinner.  What I've gone for (on way more than one occasion) is the Gypsy dance party night on the last friday of the month. LOOOOVE it!  Its $5 for usually set by Gitana Angela (DJ spinning balkan beats) and then live craziness courtesy of the balkan brass band Black Bear Combo (whew...thats a whole lotta B's)  These guys are great, they are right there on the floor with the people in the crowd, and are rumpus as hell! (tuba's, trumpets, drums, acordions, oh my!). The first time I came, I was late, and got there as the band was playing and as I walked towards the front of the crowd to see, an old man was dancing his way right up to the tuba player and tossing money into his instrument, and then dancing over to the accordion player and shoving money in his mouth (as both the musicians hands were kinda tied up, playing accordion n all) I guess this is just what you do here when you really really really like the music!  A man I presume to be the owner was roaming about encouraging merriment and imbibing, and right in front of me came and hoisted another girl ONto the bar to dance (to which she happily obliged). Had it been me, I would have shrunk away awkwardly.  However, hidden amongst throngs of other patrons, I happily ended up jumping around like a maniac to the balkan sounds. The drinks are on par (price-wise) with what you find in most establishments. I've had their white sangria (which is lovely), and many margaritas (also yummy), several versions of mojitos (mango, raspberry, etc) All tasty. The waitress's never seem to be too enthusiastic, but 'tev.  I go back and forth on the owner every time I've been there. Sometimes I think he's hilarious (walking around breaking plates, and flaming up things) and other times I'm annoyed or creeped out by him (like the last time when he danced over to our table and hand fed every lady there a slice of fresh mango) I dunno, I guess I'm too ""americanized"" or I wasn't drunk enough b/c I do like my space. And don't like people I don't know invading it.  However, than I learned that the owner is named Bronco or Branco or something, and instantly thought that was hilarious. So he's back in my favor.  Overall its a clean, very well kept place. The bathrooms are pretty immaculate, which is always a bonus. and the location is in a stretch of chicago where it actually ISN'T a problem to find parking right there on the street and not have to ""pay-at-the-box""...which is a huge bonus in my opinion.

2010-04-19,4.0,"Came in here with a couple of friends the other night prior to seeing a play at Sideshow Theatre. Am not familiar with the Irving Park/ Avondale area, so thanks Yelpers for pointing me in the right direction! Little Bucharest is a cute ethnic spot with tons of character amidst the industrial strips that line Elston. It was an early Friday evening, and there were only 3 tables besides ours. However, the band and singer were performing their hearts out and talking to the audience as if they were playing for a full house. It was kind of funny that their musical styling was very Spanish/flamenco. Close your eyes and you'd expect to be in a cute tapas spot. Open them up, and you'll find an Eastern European wedding reception hall. Great wine list - Romanian varietals and the typical world options. Was looking forward to some nice Eastern European beer on tap, but the only had it in bottles. The average entree is around $17, so you should not pass up the $25 deal for a 3-course dinner on Friday nights! I normally enjoy weird animal parts, but wasn't too impressed with the tripe soup. The Greek salad had lovely, large olives, tomatoes, and cucumbers. The beet and artichoke salad was wonderful, as well. The chicken stuffed with sausage is supposedly award-winning but the meat-stuffed-meat was fairly bland and the polenta was a bit disappointing. The pork rib ghoulash also won awards and really was amazing. It was a gigantic portion of pull-apart pork, so I shared it with my friends who weren't as happy with their meal. We were running late for the show, rushed through dessert, but were happy with the chocolate ganache and apple strudel. The owner is hilarious and super friendly. He came by our dinner table several times to check on us. As we were leaving, my friend and I noticed that he was wrapping a long, clear plastic tube around our other friend. Turns out he was giving her a shot through the tube. It seems that most ethnic liquors - Arak (Israel), Sambuca or Ouzo (Greece), Absinthe, etc. - taste like licorice. The Romanian liqueur (tuica?) smelled super strong but was surprisingly drinkable - very fragrant and even smoother than Patron in going down. ""It's little, but it gets the job done,"" said the owner. After seeing him wrap the tube around my two friends, I was hoping to slink out of the restaurant gracefully. Before I knew it, the tube was around me and the owner said, ""are you going to take it or should I put it in your mouth?""

I'm not sure how they managed to get that far up Elston when all they were looking for was a McDonald's.  If I'm looking for a Romanian restaurant, I'm going to expect it to be authentic, hope it's not American, and expect English to be the second language.  So those would not be things I would complain about.  As for the speed, sure, it's no TGI Friday's - they won't hand you your check with your meal, expect you to scarf down your food so they can kick you out and get someone else in your seat.  I thought the timing was perfect - we had time to enjoy our food and converse before the next course came, and we could get the check when we wanted it.

For those of you who don't know Elston, it is one of the few streets in Chicago that travel through both time AND space.  That's why I wasn't completely surprised to have arrived, just past Addison, at a stained-glass café in Bucharest circa 1930. Inside, a curly-haired Django Reinhardt was playing his guitar alongside a female Stephane Grapelli and some other rascal on guitar, gliding through standards like After You've Gone, Corcovado, and Misty before landing on an unrecognizable tune.  Django scraped the strings lengthwise, Stephane moused her fiddle, Django plucked the strings between the saddle and the bridge, Stephane launched a small jet along the concourse of the strings.  They smiled at each other, knowing the moment of spontaneous genius they had created. Branko, the owner, weaves his way through the dining area, checking on his customers.   Flames leap dramatically from plates of saganaki seemingly every fifteen minutes.  $7 may sound like a lot for a plate of cheese, but with the fire and Branko's effervescence included in the deal, it's a steal.  If the beer selection is noteworthy- Old No. 38, Barley Island Wheat Ale, South Hampton White, Peak Organic Amber- the wine selection may be more so.  One specialty I didn't try was the Dracula's blood wine.  There's good food here, too- I tried the whitefish but that's just the start of it. This could well be the best little world music venue in town right now.  Other regular acts include a French accordion duo, Bossa Tres, a tango group, and a rumba group.  I came here with a couple of guys... but now that I know the way the stained glass and orange light cast a warm glow on all around, I'm coming back with a woman.  And maybe take credit for what Branko so tastefully created.",0.9685,0.842,0.104,0.054,0.36219644552977887

I don't recall what we had for desert. Ambiance:  During dinner, more patrons began arriving and several guys began moving tables out of the center of the restaurant.  Soon, the place was brimming with people having dinner and dancing tango (!).  By now it was 10:00 or so.  Truly, we felt like we were in Buenos Aires.  It was great.  I imagine that without all this excitement, it's a lot quieter.  If they could keep this atmosphere nightly, I think they would be packed.

The employees spoke little English and didn't even seem to understand the American concept of dining. From the get-go, it was an off beat restaurant experience. First, my boyfriend and I were given considerably different menus. When we tried to ask questions about dishes, the server seemed utterly confused. We ended up ordering a crab and spinach dip (super crabby, not very flavorful or dip like) and a Caesar salad (fine), and two beers to start. It took about 10 minutes to get the beers, and another 25 for the appetizers. And we were 1 of THREE tables! While we were waiting for them to come an accordion player awkwardly played right at our table for a LONG time. Nice idea, but not great execution. For entrees we got the sausage platter (good flavor, wayyyy weird texture) and the rib tip goulash (tender meat, but not served in a stew, like all goulashes I have ever had). Throughout the meal plates weren't cleared, and it took forever to get the check. Overall a very weird and unpleasant dining experience.",-0.8632,0.868,0.042,0.09,0.5584415584415584
2009-08-24,5.0,"I went here on Saturday night with a friend, and thought it was spectacular.  I liked both the food and the atmosphere. You walk in, and the first thing that greets you (after the host, who may shake your hand several times), is a life-size stained glass of Vlad the Impailer.  (WTF, awesome!?)  Then you sit down in a cosy little dining room right next to a bar.  There are lots of servers, and wild tables of drinkers, but also children running around and playing, and families with seniors.  There's also a roving accordian player who's pretty good. The food is not served super-fast, but I thought it was worth a little wait.  The short-rib goulash was really, really good.  The chilled Romanian wine was great.  ($7 for a very generous glass, and our last round of the night was on the house!)  The Caprese-style salad was good but not spectacular.  The complimentary liquor offered through a hose was weird but good.  (And hey, it's free,) Toward the end of the evening, women were carried around and encouraged to break plates against the wall.  Wine bottles were also broken.  I see a previous Yelper said that walking out through a bunch of glass shards was a negative thing.  To that, all I have to say is there are 6,000 restaurants in Chicago where you DON'T get to walk out through broken glass.  Thank goodness there is 1 where you do. If you are adventurous and like good food, then Little Bucharest is totally awesome.",0.9939,0.704,0.229,0.066,0.554154995331466
2009-08-15,1.0,"Wow.  That was a mistake. After seeing  the raves here on Yelp, went over to check out Little Bucharest with a couple of friends, one of whom was in from out of town. We were seated right away, and handed menus, which were wrinkled and folded up pieces of paper.  Same with the beer menus, and on one of them, there appeared to be their bar inventory.  Odd, but whatever. Our waitress didn't really speak English very well, but we got by just fine at first by just pointing to the item we were ordering on the menu so she could copy it. We had long finished our appetizer and the plates were just left with us.  After quite a long while (at least twenty minutes) of trying to flag the server down, we finally succeeded and were again pointing to the items on the menu we wanted to order. Then the owner came by, pretty much out of nowhere, as I had not seen him previously during the evening.  He began to scold her in another language, when she argued he ""shhh""ed her.  He took over, quickly taking our order and was cordial enough, had some personality, and explained how they had just opened, etc. Then. We easily waited an hour. On one of his routes to another table, he finally stopped by and asked if we'd had dinner yet. ?!? Um, no. Then, the part that irritated me the most: he proceeded to blame the massively delayed order on the WAITRESS!  You know, the one he had taken over for.  He did this over and over, it was all I could do to not remind him that HE had taken the order. The food arrived and was only so so.  After having waited so long between appetizer and entree, I just wasn't hungry enough to really know. He offered his ""hooch"" which a previous Yelper praised, some plastic hose that everyone else's mouth in the restaurant had been on.  NO THANKS. He got into quite a festive mood and began throwing plates and glasses on the floor, and clapping to the music of the live accordion player. There was still glass on the floor when we were walking out.  Everywhere.  It's summer, and people are wearing open shoes, idiot. Frankly $140 later, I think we all felt a little burned.

2009-08-14,5.0,"On the way to a concert at the Abbey Pub we decided to have dinner here. The place looked a little deserted, which got me worried a bit, but the owner came out right away and mentioned that he'd just opened the place a little while ago. He was very friendly, warm and welcoming, and told us his policy was ""you don't like it, you don't pay."" The food was wonderful. I had a veal paprikash served with mashed potatoes. It was creamy and subtly flavoured, and the veal was perfectly tender. I had a light slaw on the side, which was lightly dressed and had the perfect amount of vinegar sourness to balance the richness of the paprikash. My wife had the pork schnitzel -- tender on the inside, and crispy on the outside, and not greasy at all.  At the end of the meal, the owner came out with a thin clear hose filled with some strong Romanian hooch. We passed it around the table, like frat boys with a beer bong.  I'd highly recommend this place.",0.9929,0.741,0.226,0.033,0.6554341736694677

2009-08-08,4.0,"The last time I was here, it was about to transition from Continental Cafe. Overall, I don't notice a whole lot of difference. Gone are the huge menus with photos of the dishes. That has been simplified to one page of small print. I can't say for certain, but it appears to me that there are fewer selections, now. I had the stuffed cabbage again. They're good. Even better is their creamy polenta. It is the epitome of comfort food. Appetizers we have tried are good. The crab and spinach dip with pita and the eggplant spread are good. For dessert we tried the chocolate ganache filled cupcake and a strawberry cobbler. I wasn't expecting much, but both were quite tasty. Beer and wine selection isn't huge, but decent. I like the strawberry daiquiri's they make. I am a little uncertain of what direction they're going with the menu. I wish they'd stick with the Romanian food. It's worked for them for almost 40 years. The owner, Branko is awesome! He stopped by our table probably 6 times. We've seen him there before, but it's not as if he knows us or anything. He ""bought"" our third round of drinks, and also gave us a shot of something that I assume is some potent Romanian concoction. Very hospitable guy. Could have done without the roaming father and son accordion/violin duo. I love live music, but I don't dig them stopping at your table unsolicited to perform 2 of the longest songs...in the history of songs. I'm guessing this is more of a late-night and private party spot, because before 9:00, they never seem too busy. Certainly have never had a problem getting a table. Also never have a problem with nearby street parking, and it's not metered...yet. Will be a regular stop, and definitely recommended.",0.994,0.776,0.184,0.04,0.4795754840397698

2009-07-11,3.0,"Made the trip out to Little Bucharest Bistro the other night to check out the restaurant.  The facade, outdoor seating and fountain are quaint and were done very well.  The interior as well is clean and quaint.   Two menus were offered: one offering classic Romanian fare, the second being Chef Andre's menu.  Having eaten at his last venture, it's amusing to see that this menu is more or less identical to his last, save some small changes.   We ordered off of both menus.  Iceberg wedge, gravlox and onion tart off Chef Andre's menu, sausage and cabbage rolls off of the classic menu.  No complaints about the salad except that they used a wedge of romaine instead of iceberg.  The gravlox was also well executed; my only suggestion would be to serve rye toast points to accompany the salmon and decrease the portion size.  The onion tart, unfortuantely, was not exceptionally palatable.  The pastry was soggy, the onions were not cooked down enough and the accompanying thyme salad was missing.  The classic Romanian entrees were exceptional.  Terrific sausages and cabbage rolls.  The accompanying sides listed on the menu, however, were different from what we received.   All this being said, I was astonished that Chef Andre was not in the kitchen and apparently taking a Friday evening off.  It's possible that he had an emergency or very pressing plans, but if not, he should be there to insure that the menus are being executed properly.",0.6297,0.907,0.059,0.034,0.4486111111111111
