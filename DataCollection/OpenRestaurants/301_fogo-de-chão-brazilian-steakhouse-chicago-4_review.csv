2017-08-21,5.0,"Probably my (and my husband's) favorite restaurant ever. If you love meat, you have to check it out. The environment is cozy, not too loud but also not too posh. I love that they are family friendly and try to accomodate your requests. I believe it's also a nice place for groups and celebrations. We went twice for lunch and we enjoyed a lot the buffet, where you can get salads, vegetables, cheeses, salmon etc. But of course the best part is when they bring you all sorts of meat. We have tried several pieces and they were all so tasty, juicy, charred, smoky... I just love it. You can eat as much as you like and take your time. The personnel is very polite and friendly.

2017-08-15,3.0,Basically a buffet where you go to the salad bar to get your non meat dishes cold salads tubes and then when you're sitting at the table service come if you flip over a certain coin to know if you want me or you don't want me you can upgrade the option that include to a better cut and Seafood over the years it seems like the quality of me has changed and it's not as good as it used once was but it is a very popular place more of a tourist attraction to me occasionally they offer two for one deals and if you get on their mailing list they will send you something out for your birthday or anniversaries the last time I was there the meat was a little greasy and cold by the time I got to eat it because I had so I don't know if it was because I had so much on my plate so definitely pace yourself and this is definitely for a special event red meat eater enjoy,0.9837,0.807,0.176,0.017,0.5084077380952381

2017-08-11,3.0,My  review is three and a half. I just can't get the half in there. This place was interesting. The people inside were great and the food was nice. The reason why the stars are three and a half is because the steak was way to salty and whenever I did get a cut from them it wasn't a cut you could eat sadly. Another problem was that there was a party of like fifty and I felt like they had all the attention. Which was fine but I kept having to chase my own meat. Never experienced that before. I love what they are going for but its not for me.,0.9001,0.778,0.163,0.059,0.6136363636363636
2017-08-07,2.0,"I have been to the Rosemont location before, so I knew what to expect and was excited to go to the one in River North.  I expected the service to be up to par, if not better, than the service I received in Rosemont, but that was not the case. Our reservation was Saturday at 9pm.  We were seated relatively quickly, but ended up sitting at our table for nearly 10 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order.  Given that it was a Saturday night, I brushed off our way, assuming it was because of how full the place was.  My assumption fell short, however, when our waits became longer the more people left the restaurant. After enjoying the salad bar, we sat for nearly 15 minutes before anyone came around with meat.  Even the waiter uncomfortably apologized and said someone will be with us shortly.  After that, a waitress took away my plate, giving me a new one, less than two minutes after I got a cut of meat.  I had to ask her to let me put the cut of meat on my new plate before she took it away.  After that, we had to ask two people to bring us sides before we actually got them.  The second time we asked someone to bring us sides, nearly 20 minutes passed by before I gave up and asked for the check.  That, however ironically, was given to me within three minutes of my request. Our dinner ended at 10:45pm.  I am all for long, slow dinners, but nearly two hours?  I hope that helps you understand how long we waited in between each drink and plate of food.  Not to mention, it was a pricey dinner!   Overall, I give the River North location of Fogo de Chao two stars simply because the food was good, but definitely not good enough to wait two hours.",0.9705,0.874,0.094,0.032,0.39423794596208384

We made reservation at 11:30, got there at 11:32 and have to wait till 11:40 to be seated... just felt like all the prepwork that should have happened before 11:30 started at 11:30. A couple of things that kind of ruined this experience for me: 1. There were only 2 tables that needs to be seated and the host decided that in an empty restaurant, we should sit directly next to each other. I'm not asking to be seated on the opposite side of the restaurant but at least give us some privacy and leave a table in between! I understand that it's less walking distance for the people that carries the meat but then don't seat us all at the wall.  2. I was given the wrong check twice.. by 2 different people. The third person finally made it right after 2 attempts...  3. There are a few selection of meat that was not served till after we finished... like rib cuts, lamb chops, and some more.

2017-05-28,5.0,"This is my second time having the lunch special on a Sunday with unlimited salad bar and meats. It includes free drinks and a dessert. It's AMAZING.  If you want to make the most of it, do not eat anything beforehand and PACE YOURSELF. It's tempting to get everything but it's okay to decline some meats. I suggest getting the bacon wrapped beef rib, any of the sirloins, and the beef rib. They save the best meat last until the very end of your meal. They do that on purpose so you can fill your stomach with other foods and have less room for the beef rib.  The beef rib is sooooooo good. It's served warm and it melts in your mouth like butter. You can savor it in your mouth. You can also ask for sauces to go with your meat. My favorite is the chimichurri sauce. They also have horseradish, mint jelly, A1 sauce, BBQ sauce. Don't use the sauces for the beef rib. If you do, it's like you committed a crime. The beef rib itself is all you need.  The waiters come in and out with meats on poles and they carve it in front of you and you pick up the slice with the mini tongs they give you. They also give you cards where it tells the waiter if you want more meat. Red means no and green means yes.  The salad bar is really good. Their papayas are so fresh and you need to try some. It's like you're eating them in Mexico. Their yogurt parfaits are alright. My friend said it's like McDonalds.  For drinks, you need to get the LIMEADE. SO GOOD and refreshing.  It's bottomless so they keep giving you another cup if you're finished. It's the best drink there.  They also give you side dishes like caramelized bananas, garlic mashed potatoes, fried potato sticks, and endless soft cheesy bread rolls.  Don't forget to ask for the dessert menu! I got the molten chocolate cake and it was a taste of heaven. Please do get it. I think it's the best dessert on their menu. You won't regret it.  By the end of the meal, you will probably gain 5 pounds but it's worth it. I don't know how much this deal is exactly because people treated me.

Kept seeing the same 3 meats over and over again. We had to ask for a chicken and lamb selection, which they were happy to accommodate, but really? We needed to ask. That was dissapointing. With that being said, the after dinner cocktail was the best thing ever. Amazing tequila selections, cordials etc. Loved it!

Our favorites are the lamb chops and beef ribs.  I will say that one that I noticed was that the meat wasn't over salted as it is at most other churrascarias.  The top sirloin was also quite good.  I got an end piece that had a great crust but also the piece itself was rare, like cool center rare.  I don't normal get my red meats done that way but that piece was very good.   Service was good, kids (both ours under 7) ate free.  My wife and I both had cocktails, which were good.  With a $25 coupon, the bill was still over $150.

I've been to so many stunner restaurants in Chicago, and this particular dining experience tops even my most decadent dinners. Holy cow, is the phrase I use any time someone has asked me about that particular dinner, or about the restaurant in general. Lettuce continues to do it right with this collaboration, and this restaurant is nothing short of 5 stars. First off, the interior of the restaurant screams class. We had one of the first reservations of the night as we had a sleeping baby along for the ride. The dining room quickly filled up, and the place was packed within 30 minutes.  Our waiter was super professional and gave us a fantastic overview of the menu, along with all of the most popular items. Everything was very efficient and smooth. The flow of service was great and just so very professional as one would expect when dropping a load of dough on dinner. They had quite a few specials that evening and we were ready to have some fun.  The wine list was beautiful, and the cocktails were great too. Even though we were ready to be rolled out of the place, we had to order dessert. That's just what you do. Everyone in the dining room looks over for that one. How shall I sum up Fogo Steak? If you're looking to ball out and thoroughly get your money's worth. Then dine here, and you will not be let down!",0.9922,0.829,0.163,0.008,0.47407322068612395

I would have maybe liked a little more variety (just because that was a case in a similar restaurant we used to dine-in in another country). Word of advice is take breaks between meat sessions because you WILL get stuffed. They will shower you with meat cuts so you might want to flip  the card to red (which means stop meat) until you finish the meat cuts in front of you. Ambience is romantic and perfect for a date-night or special occasion. It's also family friendly as well. I very much appreciated their gesture of bringing us a complementary piece of cake for my husband's birthday. Though we were so full, we managed to eat half of it and it was great.

Once it came time for the meat, there was no holding back.  I tried at least one of everything.  The sirloin, filet, strip, etc. were spot on.  I was not a fan of the pork.  The garlic steak was extremely overpowering, and the parmesan crusted pork was too much.  The sausage lacked flavor and was very tough.  As the night went on, the meat wellness was no longer consistent.  When I asked for medium, it was dry and well done.  I was also not a big fan of the slicing of the filets, and steaks because I feel like you almost ruin the steak that way. The desserts were decent, but nothing to write home about.

The worst part, the food. I clearly remembered bottom sirloin being my favorite years ago.  It was just ok.  Everything was either just ok or not worth eating.  I resorted to making little sandwiches. They were mozzarella cheese  salmon and their tasty little bread puffs.  My little sandwiches were the best but even they fell short because instead of being light and fluffy as the use to be, they were hard with a little crunch.

I used to love eating here but I just have to say that the service has gone completely down hill. I've eaten at the Fogo's in Sao Paulo and service is impeccable there. At this location, it was a complete 180. Our waiter hardly ever came around to check on us. When he did, he always asked us if we wanted a couple of specific meats brought over. We would tell him and he would say he would direct someone over to us. This never happened. Our server did this multiple times to us. I then asked another server for some chimmichuri sauce to put on the meat and this never appeared. At one point, the manager came over and asked how we were doing and I brought up the Chimmichuri sauce. He then went back and got it himself which was a saving grace for them.  When the meats were brought over, I asked for mine medium rare and 90% of the time, the waiter said ""Oh yes. This one right here is medium rare."" before cutting the meat. When he walked away and I had a chance to look at the slice on my plate, it was almost always well done. The guys with the meat are idiots.  When we were finally done, I asked for the dessert menu which took forever to come. We knew what we wanted to order for dessert but had to wait almost 15 minutes before someone else came over to take our order. I ordered the creme de papaya which was terrible and not at all like the creme de papaya in Brazil. I then told our server how bad it was and didn't want any other dessert to eat. I was so angry by then. The waiter offered to give me a free new dessert but I just didn't want to stay there anymore. My fiance ended up getting the creme brulee which was actually good.  I left pretty full but extremely disappointed and will never come back here again. All the Brazilians that we know have such negative things to say about this location.

They offer a variety of fresh vegetables, cold cuts, and salads, along with a limited hot bar (soup, rice, and veggies). No complaints there.  When the meat comes around, the server asks you if you prefer medium or medium rare but often times I found the meat to be closer to well done regardless of whatever you choose. The lamb chops were burnt and too tough to chew. Also, I don't feel like I was able to try every all the different types of meat they offer and sometimes the servers would not stop at our table despite our cards being turned green. However, our table server did come over and ask what else we wanted to try, it would be helpful if they had a list/menu of all the different meats they offer.

There's no one person waiting on you. If this is your first time you do not know this. That being said the service from the servers/ supervisors was awesome. The gentlemen handling the meat expects you to know what  you are doing. They even seem bothered that you don't know what you are doing. Yes, there are several different people in several different uniforms walking around pretty fast. You don't know who is who.  The food is amazing. Their bread basket has the most light airy roll, you can't stop eating them. The mashed potatoes, polenta and banana, salmon, and apple salad were all remarkable to me.

If you really like something keep getting it. We're talking table side warm skewers of meat. The salad bar was pretty small and just ok.  I think it's great for a large group because you pay the same price plus drinks.  The crowd were mostly couples (they looked suburban) or large groups.  I wouldn't say it's romantic because the decor is from about 15 years and you're in a large room with lots of people.  It was fun not worrying about ordering and splitting the bill in a large group, but for the fixed price, you could eat at a restaurant with better food overall.  I say go if they happen to have a Groupon.  Granted it's cheaper than a steakhouse but certainly not worth the price compared to other restaurants in the same area.",0.9743,0.813,0.166,0.02,0.387266156462585

The servers come by with every type of meat imaginable - sirloin, filet, sausage, chicken - you name it, they have it and it's all carved table side. The salad bar is also amazing. You could easily have a huge meal from the salad bar alone. They have salads, meats, cheeses, and roast vegetables on the salad bar, so even non-meat eaters have a lot of options. The meats also come with sides, but most of them are underwhelming. However, I'm obsessed with the hot cheese puffs that they bring out at the beginning of the meal.  I could eat endless amounts of them. Needless to say, only come here on an empty stomach.  This location also does a good job with groups. My fiancé and I had our rehearsal dinner here and the staff was great!

2016-10-13,3.0,"I have mixed feeling about this place. Admittedly, I am a bit of a steak snob, and 99% of the time at a steak house, I will always go for the filet. Let me run through the meal from start to finish. I was greeted immediately by a great server who explained the concept to me and offered me a drink, suggesting a Caprihina. I wound up ordering a glass of Pinot Noir, which was very good and well priced at $10. I sampled a little of everything from the salad bar. Everything was good except for the charcuterie which was as tough as leather and I could not eat it. No big deal, the real meat was coming later on skewers.  As soon as I flipped my card to indicate I was ready to eat the servers came over right away, one after another offering all types of meat. I decided to try almost everything. I also received some bread sticks and fried plantain as well as some good, but very peppery, mashed potatoes. Here's a tip, save the plantains for desert.  The Picanha (house special), filet and top sirlion were all good. The other cuts of meat were way too fatty for my liking.  About halfway through my meal, I had finished my glass of wine and kept looking for my server. She never re-appeared the rest of the night. It's possible she went home, but I was never told this and left wondering who to talk to if I needed something. About 10 minutes later a manager came over and asked if I wanted some more wine, and I ordered another glass.  The service from the staff when it came to offering more food was excellent. At the end, the manager asked if I wanted anything else. I asked for a little more of the filet. The last cut was very fatty and I didn't eat it. Maybe it was just a bad piece of meat.  When the bill came I noticed there was a charge for $11.95 that I did not recognize. When I asked, I was told it was for a drink that I had order from one of the strolling waiters who had come to my table, like any the meat carvers and offered it to me. When he offered it to me, there was no mention of an additional charge. I told the manager this and they quickly removed the $11.95.  So, in summary, some of the meat was really good, others not as much. My dissapearing server and surprise $11.95 charge also created negative feelings toward the place.  I had a $25 off coupon, so the bill was only $53 instead of $78, which made the experience a bit more palatable. Would I go back again, probably not. If I was invited to go, I would attend, but would go in knowing what to expect.",0.9821,0.844,0.112,0.044,0.48052248677248677

2016-10-03,5.0,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place considering the number of times I've been here, but basically yeah, 5 stars. The salad and charcuterie buffet is amazing, but limit yourself because you need to save as much room for the truly pricey stuff, the steak, as possible. From the salad bar, I usually grab the green beans and the beets and the mozzarella balls. The table sides are mashed potatoes, polenta, and plantains, but the real star are the fluffy cheesy dough balls that come hot and soft at the table. If I could live on those and steak for the rest of my life, I'd be in heaven. Then there's the meat that keeps coming at you as long as your green light is on. My favorite is the special because it's this charred garlicky piece of meat that just melts in your mouth, but regardless, all the steak cuts are amazing. I love that you can choose your meat temperature and they always have a perfect medium rare cut that turns my plate pink. The chicken and pork selections aren't my favorites, as they always seem to be a little dry, but I'm here for the beef, so I don't even waste my time trying them anymore. If you have the room, the desserts are amazing as well, but rarely will you have the room. The service is wonderful and with 20 waiters at your beck and call, you're never left wanting for long. You leave with a full belly and a little bit of the meat sweats, but as long as you have a roomier waistband, you're good to roll yourself home and have pleasant meat dreams.",0.997,0.749,0.222,0.029,0.5996598639455781

2016-05-14,5.0,"I am lucky. Why? Because I come from a city in New Jersey, about 20 minutes away, by train, from New York City that's full of some of the best food the Lusophone (Portuguese) world has to offer. Almost every restaurant is delicious, quirky and perfect in its own way, which is why I've never cared much for chains. I didn't have to! How could a huge, publicly traded restaurant replicate such an experience, so far away (distance-wise) from its origins? Well, I think at the Chicago location, at least, they did just that. Chicago has a way of really happening in the quiet, almost secretive of ways. You walk in to a space, or at least I did multiple times while in Chicago, and thought to myself, wow this place is dead. Not more than 5 steps forward and a dozen tiny groups were to my right. Some were on dates, others having what looked like a family dinner, a girls' night in one corner and guys' night in the other, and all were happily enjoying their food and each other.  We were a minute or two late for our already altered reservation for the night, but the hostess made no issue of my guilt, and kindly showed my boss lady and I to a nice little table. Maurice was the first waiter to attend to us and kindly helped us with our jackets and offered us water, drinks and taught us the lay of the land. I got a passion fruit caipirinha, a nice concoction of passion fruit juice, sugar, lime and Brazilian firewater.  Upon being seated, you'll notice something that looks like a coaster for your drink that's red on one side and green on the other. This will be your tell to those bringing around those delicious meats whether you're up for another bite, or if you simply cannot take another. Before your mouth begins to salivate however, there's an entire buffet full of rice, feijoada (Afro-luso-pork,beef and bean stew) farofa (cassava flour), to be enjoyed atop. Not to mention as many fresh veggies, salads of all kinds, fruit and a slew of other things that could fill you up BEFORE the meats start coming 'round. Be careful! The meats of the rodizio came and went. There were sausages, chicken, filet mignon, ribs, lamb - just about anything you could think of and just as soon as your plate was dirty, within seconds, much like a well-choreographed dance, another plate warm, an invitation to eat more food, was placed on the table ready for another go at the buffet and NEW rodizio meats.  If you're not careful, soon you'll be full and happy without any space for dessert or another drink. You may judge yourself a little, I did, but it's at this point that you should thank yourself. You deserved a good dinner, great service, and sweet, non-judgmental smiling faces seemingly happy to see you happy with them. And all the while, at least three separate occasions, a lovely woman, a manager perhaps, came over and asked how we were enjoying anything and if there was anything special that we wanted, all we had to do was ask. She was right and this dinner was one of the best that I've had in quite some time. I've been away from home and I try my best to get over twice a year or so, but a four-hour train ride away rests a beautiful city, with one of my newest, favorite restaurants,  Fogo de Chão and I so look forward to coming back.",0.9991,0.769,0.211,0.02,0.5932233291822331

The staff especially Diego and another woman I did not get her name took extra care with my kids especially my daughter who was not feeling well. It made a birthday dinner for my wife which was not going well into something to remember as Diego joked with my son telling him he could take home the little green/red circle where you can order more or stop meat from coming. My son was thrilled.  Diego also saw my daughter who took one bite of a bacon with pepper about 1 minute into our meal and knew she was not feeling well the rest of time as she lay down on her seat.  While my wife and I hurriedly tried to finish as our daughter went from ok to lying down in her chair, something unexpected happened as Diego took off my daughters part of meal for bill. That was very nice and unexpected. I will definitely come back and recommend. And they have a real gem in Diego at Fogo.

2016-03-02,4.0,"Sex on a Stick Truly, I must live under a rock. I had never heard of Fogo until I was watching the Real Housewives of Atlanta (dont judge me) and saw that they had dinner at the ATL location so I checked to see if Chicago had one and we did. Once I explored what Fogo was, I was floored. UNLIMITED MEAT?!! Yes Gods! YES! Location: This Fogo is right on Lasalle. So while my initial thought would be ""F*?#! Now there will be a long wait"" because Lasalle is always busy, I looked online and saw that wait times don't exist because most people make reservations. So doing just that, we walked right in, and got seated. Decor: Very immaculate. Its like, an opulent barn? The chandeliers are beautiful here. Also love the carpet and the dimmed lights. Service: Very friendly hosts and servers. No complaints here. Everyone was great. Food:I had a little of the salad bar. I was VERY impressed with the full spread. My favorite thing on the salad bar was the candied bacon. I wanted to be trashy and steal a couple of pieces in a napkin on the way out, but I am too old for that now I guess (lol). Truly. The bacon is great. The Beef: I have to be very honest, for this to be a steakhouse, the chicken, sausages, and lamb gave my taste buds more orgasms than the steak. I admit that I know absolutely nothing about the various cuts of steak and which parts are more/less flavorful/expensive but the first two cuts I received literally had NO taste or seasoning. Not sure if that was intentional but seasoning is a must for me. The steak that I had the remainder of the night was quite tasty but again, I was not WOWed like I was with the chicken. The Poultry: THE CHICKEN!! Ironically, the chicken was my favorite meat at Fogo. ESPECIALLY the bacon wrapped chicken! SO juicy and SO hot and FULL of flavor.  The Pork: THE SAUSAGES!!! Were a close second favorite for me! The spices used in these links were very carefully thought out obviously. A tad spicy, but more savory. The parmesan crusted pork was not a hit for me. Perhaps because it was cooked a little too long. The Lamb: HEAVENLY! DIVINE! No other words. 4 stars because I was not WOWed by the steak.",0.9929,0.781,0.161,0.059,0.6422942045035067

I along with two others stuck with the amazing salad bar that also had an impressive selection. Salads, veggies, meats and cheeses, soup, fajita bar, and so much more kept me satisfied with my choice not to go with the full experience. Though I am not a vegetarian, my willpower isn't great when it comes to 'all you can eat'.  My food was good and the people around me agreed. Though the consensus did admit that it wasn't the best quality or most amazing thing we have ever had, we did enjoy ourselves. The service was great and our server kept our wine and water glasses full. Overall a very positive experience. I don't think I would go back outside the group event as it just wasn't delicious enough for my taste, but would join the group if they choose this for our annual dinner next year.

But you won't ever know about this meatlovers Heaven. Who knew that Fogo was a chain restaurant? I didn't. I dined at the one in Austin, and I've been thinking about it for months. So I was excited when I spotted this Chicago location, just around the corner from my hotel.  I made a 12:30 pm reservation and arrived a bit early. We still were given a pager contraption and waited a bit. The place was packed. We were finally sat to dine near the walkway, near the entrance. It wasn't a great spot, but we didn't care, we only wanted to eat.  My husband immediately turned his card to green, prompting the meat to start arriving to his plate. My daughter and I made our way to the salad bar. I must say that the location in Austin had several more options. There is also a section of hot authentic foods. When we sat down to begin on our salads, we couldn't pass up the meats as they started to arrive to our table. First was the leg of lamb, then top sirloin, bacon wrapped chicken, bacon wrapped filet mignon, parmesan crusted pork chops, lamb chops, chicken legs, etc. I must say that most of the beef was fatty and the few times that I requested medium well, the cuts still had a charred taste. So I switched to medium. The men walking around serving the meats were all extremely nice. Even though our cards were eventually turned to red, they still stopped and showcased what they had. A few even asked if we had a special request. My daughter requested the leg of lamb and my husband requested the parmasan crusted pork chop again. Me, I was in a food coma about thirty minutes into it.  I always tip a bit over my normal 20% at a place like this, I figure that the men serving the meats get a portion of the gratuity too.",0.902,0.899,0.07,0.03,0.5132173382173382

Its the smartest thing since the invention of bacon. We visited Fogo for our daughters birthday and the service was phenomenal. Our server Luisa was great and extremely attentive as was the Customer Service Manager (I didn't catch his name but he was really friendly and wanted to make sure we had a great time).  The best thing to do when coming to these all you can eat type of restaurants is to focus on the main event, the meats. Don't be fooled by the salad bar because its mainly there to fill you up. We focused on enjoying the meats since they have like 16 different kinds, and after we had our fill we went to check out the salad bar and mainly snacked on some things. I will say that I liked Brazzaz' salad bar way more because their variety was extensive, its too bad they closed. In regards to the meats though, Fogo has it down! When it comes to desserts I'm not really a big fan but I did however enjoy the papaya cream and the tres leches was also pretty good. My better half also really enjoyed his tres leche cake and he's more qualified in this area since he pretty much has more sugar running through his veins than actual blood. The chocolate cake was a bit too sweet but who am I to say such things to those who may enjoy some cake with their sugar? We will definitely be back, no question about it.

You can go get salad, cheese, olives, and all sorts of meat over at the salad bar. And once your hankering for some meat all you have to do is flip your card over! Once you flip it waiters come to your table holding meat on a stick, and you can chose if you want that type of meat, and if you do, how you want it. Then they cut off a slice which you grab with your tongs. The meat is very tender, but very red, so be careful if you like your meat well done. The meat is fantastic. The other thing that I like is the service. You can go in, sit down, and eat within  5 minutes. If you thought that that was amazing though everybody there was FANTASTIC, the main waiter was very nice and explained the whole process, he was very funny too. The one thing I didn't like was the price. It was 50 dollars per person, plus drinks and desert. This place was good, and almost worth the price, but not quite.

Things as simple as keeping a water glass filled was an insurmountable task for this group of servers....and it just gets worse from there.   The host expressed her disappointment once to the head server, and there was a scurry of people for about all of 5 minutes.  Just enough time to fill water glasses...and leave.  I am so glad this was a serve yourself kind of place as far as the salad bar went, despite the fact that our appetizer plates had not been cleared until dinner plates were set down.  Again, I understand that there were a lot of people to accommodate, but this was not the case for any of our party. Sitting at a table of dirty plates and drinkless is really not what you expect.  And just to get the full understanding, I was drinking water and diet coke.  I tried to see if a mixed drink option would score better results.....not so much.  I asked for a virgin pina colada at the recommendation of the server...and  was given a strawberry daiquiri.  It seems they were all sold out of pina colada.  Getting a diet coke after this was futile.  Coffee after dinner was also a fail.  Sure...we got our lukewarm coffee items that were set down and off the server went.  Getting sweetener was a whole nother process that seemed endless.  So much for a nice cup of coffee with dessert.  Dessert...another disaster.  The process to order dessert was painful.  Again the servers were clueless with the menu offerings.  Dessert was very slow to be delivered.  Our entire table was served dessert, except for me.  Even the hostess had her dessert served even though she was not at the table...and my dessert was not served.  The rest of the room was served while our table finished there dessert before I was served mine.  And what I had ordered was on the servers tray....I was just not served.   At the price of $150 per person times 48 I would have hoped that simple tasks would at least be a service that could be handled.  Not so much.  This is a place I have no desire to return to.

I was very pleased that the restaurant was able to accommodate my group of 10 even though we were about 30 minutes early. Also, the manager for the evening was particularly attentive to one of my guests who has a medical issue that prevents him from eating foods that contain gluten. The manager made sure to go over all the menu items that were gluten-free (which is most of the food they serve) and checked in with that person several times during our visit to make sure everything was going well. I've been to Fogo several times over the years, but the new addition of brown sugar black pepper bacon on the salad bar made me happier than I ever thought bacon could. It was delicious!

2015-11-08,3.0,"I had imagined this dining experience for years, really, years. My husband travels for business so he had already dined at more than one location. He has raved about these restaurants so much so that when we were in Chicago the choice for dinner was a no brainier. On the plus side ... the staff was outstanding. From the Maitre D' to the busboy we were treated as if we were their only customer. Every aspect of the service each one provided was top-notch. My water glass was always full, our rolls were always warm, dirty plates quickly removed. Fantastic. The actual Gaucho service was awesome. These gentlemen played their part with flair. The choices of meat were superb, every one of them done to perfection. Now to the other side of the coin. The salad bar was alright, even now I can't recall  anything that was above average. Their biggest downfall was the atmosphere. It was crowded and loud. Even though we ate late in the evening we were surrounded by families with little children. Noisy, tired, boisterous little children. There obviously was no dress code as many patrons heads were covered with ball caps. Most of our fellow customers were dressed in blue jeans. I'm not a snob but I expected a better class of clientele. Perhaps the restaurant could offer separate seating for families. Perhaps a late evening seating for adults only. Perhaps they could require a dress code. Considering the cost of our meal I expected a different dining experience. I hope to partake of a meal in a different location.

2015-10-29,3.0,"My Portuguese waiter told me that Fogo de Chao translates to 'Camp Fire'. I'll get back to this in a second. The service here is outstanding. I came with a group of friends from college and the staff took our coats off and pushed our chairs in for us. I felt royal. The salad bar is brilliant. Huge variety of fresh vegetables, meats, crackers, salads and cheese.  You get a coaster which you can flip over. The side displayed on the coaster is a signal for the staff to know if you want to be brought meat or not. If the side that says YES is on, the meat will not stop. I had some fantastic cuts; The rib-eye medium-rare was a little too bloody for me so I had it medium-well, but the rest I had medium-rare. The Filet Mignon was probably my favorite.  My only issue with the experience is the temperature of the product. For this all-you-can-eat experience I was paying about $60 but I felt underwhelmed by every piece of steak. This might be just personal preference but I was expecting smoking hot sizzling pieces of beautiful cuts of meat, but instead I got room temperature and often dry pieces on my plate. When you see the rotisserie outside the restaurant and hear the name Fogo de Chao, or CAMPFIRE, cold meat doesn't come to mind and I don't think is what I expected.

2015-10-29,1.0,"OPENFAIL I made a reservation on a popular online reservation system (not Yelp's Seat Me). Typically that is all I need to do but then I received 3 cold scripted phone calls from a male Fogo employee to confirm my reservation. He didn't leave a name but mentioned to call at my earliest connivence. I found it amazing that each call was the same script word for word and lasted exactly 15 seconds.  I was called on Wednesday, Thursday & Friday. I did call back on Friday & a girl answered the phone. I told her I had received three messages about my reservation that was coming up on Sunday. I then asked her if it was customary to be harassed via phone after setting up a confirmed reservation on OpenFail. She responded, ""Sure!""  I said, ""Did you even listen to my question?"" She then said, ""I need to put you on hold!"" This is where she left me. Sitting on hold & no one picked me up. I eventually got disconnected. Surprise! Not! I was so not happy at this point and I wasn't going to waste my time by calling back a second time. I had an online confirmed reservation and that should be good enough. Why do I need to speak with the restaurant?  I received way too many phone calls & then when I call back I'm treated like crap. Not fun! Our party of 11 arrived for our reservation at 12:30pm on Sunday. I told the hostess we had arrived. She asked us to wait in the lobby. I then noticed a waiter moving tables around trying to get it set up for a party of 11 people. I realized that they were making our table which was suppose to be ready at 12:30.  I went back to her and said, ""Did you have my OpenFail reservation in your computer for 12:30?"" The hostess said, ""Yes!"" I then said, ""Why wasn't my table ready for my parties arrival?"" She said, ""We had an unexpected table of 11 arrive and we gave them your table!"" I said, ""That makes no sense!"" She then said in a snotty tone, ""They're  making your table now!"" I walked away biting my tongue and not wanting to make a scene.  First of all an apology would be nice from the hostess or a manager. I got neither. We spent almost $600 on lunch and they start out our day acting like we weren't important. I wish we would have walked and went to a restaurant that cared.  Secondly the hostess is a complete liar. I walked around the restaurant and there was no other party of eleven anywhere in the restaurant. Complete lies from the front of the house. This is unacceptable and rude. Don't treat me like I am stupid and this is my first time making a reservation. Plus I can count to 11 too...thanks to my elementary school education.  Thirdly why should I have my party wait 10-12 minutes while we stand in the lobby watching them build our table that was suppose to be ready at 12:30pm. A complete fail. This is some of the worse customer service I have ever experienced.   On a side note the restaurant wasn't even crowded when we arrived. Our table could have been built prior to our arrival but the restaurant choose to not do this. I'm assuming that this arrogance comes from the top down. Cold scripted multiple phone calls attempting to confirm an already existing reservation. Leaving me on hold when I do call back and a snotty lying hostess who gets mad at me for being right. This place failed me on so many levels and I was letdown prior to eating my first piece of meat.",-0.9386,0.777,0.107,0.116,0.45374547479810634

I would say every cut will melt in your mouth.Fillet mignion, sirloin, chicken, lamp, and sausage are all flavorful( they have more than that absolutely). Great service Tips: go with empty stomach or you wont be able to enjoy/try every cut. They have tons of great cut Pricing: 50$ per person not including tips and drink. I think the price is pretty fair because you will have fresh cut, the quality is the same as you would get at steak house, here you will expect sample cut instead of 8oz steak since they have so many cut and you can have as many as you wish or as long as your stomach still has some room.

We had reservations for 6pm. Even with reservations we still had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Not a big deal, but 20 minutes was pressing my patience. Atmosphere is hectic. Staff running around almost bumping into you and each other. Mad rush of people to the salad bar for their 3rd visit of the night. Salad bar: I expected a great variety but it was essentially a salad bar with potato salad and some salumi and cheese. Meh.... Meats: We tried a limited number of types of meats because they kept bringing around the same 3-4 cuts. Disappointing. However, I only knew what one was (the filet) because I could barely understand the staff serving the meat because they spoke softly and it was so loud in there. The filet was the only cut I liked. I asked for medium rare...but it was more rare than I normally like. On other cuts, I usually had big chucks of fat I needed to remove. A couple next to us was complaining about the same thing. The sausage was way too salty. For what you pay, they give you a small slice of meat. I understand they come around A LOT but when I'm eating I don't want to be constantly interrupted because I need my card on green to get more. Side dishes: These I think were the worst bits of food we had. Polenta was cold and hollow. The plantains too were cold. And get this, their mashed potatoes are from a BOXED mix! You know that processed gritty texture from those? Yeah, that was the dead give away here. Gross. You could tell that the quality of the food was to feed the masses. You're not getting Morton's quality meat here by any means. When you're paying $150 on a meal for 2, I expect quality.

My play daughter is learning to speak Portuguese from a friend and so I happened to ask the gentleman handing out plates at the buffet if there was anyone there who spoke Portuguese, just to surprise her and allow her to practice, and he said of course and went and got a manager. The selection at the buffet by the way was to die for; the cheese, smoked salmon, the potato salad - of all things! - were phenomenal! At the time we were ready to move on to our next helping of the buffet, the play daughter Kelly got up to go and get our shared agreed food from the buffet. I went to clear her plate and stack it under mine to make room. I was suddenly greeted by a gentleman who cried ""No, no, no you are in my house you cannot do that here"" and made me put the plates down. I began to explain why I was doing it but he stopped me saying ""Ma'am, we apologize it even made it this far. We should have seen that you were finishing and then prepared to clear it away before you even gave it a second thought."" We were descended upon by multiple servers who cleared the table and brought fresh plates. Kelly returned to the table during this and just looked bewildered at the flurry of activity that was happening. The gentleman looked down at me and asked if there was anything else he could do, adding that he'd heard there was a request at this table. He was able to bring someone over to speak a bit of Portuguese with Kelly, who was all at once astounded, nervous yet quite pleased. The food was delicious, and it seemed like the gauchos knew exactly what kind of meat we wanted. Everyone interacted with us wonderfully, smiled pleasantly, great vibe all around. I loved that there was no music overpowering our conversations. At the end, an employee named Kelly, who ended up being our server, surprised us almost intrinsically with free desserts for the young ladies since it was their birthdays! Destiny, who was the one that is my little brothers girlfriend, got the mousse and I guess white chocolate cake layer cake with, funnily enough, her favorite color of candle. Kelly got a chocolate lava cake, which she had just spoken to her mother about minutes before our dinner.

The meal was great, but it was over $50 a person.  Although the food was tasty, I think $30-$40 a person for this place would of been more accurate.",0.913,0.755,0.173,0.072,0.6820512820512821

But I never truly appreciated this kind of restaurant - and this specific restaurant - until I was diagnosed with celiac and had to become one of those needy, annoying gluten-free people. This is by far the easiest place I've found to eat with celiac.  I hadn't expected that - thinking the salad bar was surely contaminated, all the meat was marinated, there's no menu specifying what's safe - but I was so wrong. I simply mentioned my ""gluten allergy"" when I made the reservation, and they automatically sent over an unbelievably friendly manager who explained their menu.  And to my delight, there were only a couple of salads and one meat I couldn't eat. The table bread is safe and - say what? - so are the salad croutons! Okay, so I couldn't have the scalloped potatoes, but that was the only real sacrifice.  It was, by far, the best meal I'd had in the six months I'd been gluten-free. I really hate being one of those ""oh, I need special treatment"" customers, but this place made it so easy, and I felt really confident that what I was eating wouldn't make me sick.

Seasoning is basically salt and some pepper.  We didn't touch the table shakers at all.  The wine list is pretty good, with around a 150% upcharge on street.

The whole staff is so respectable, the managers always greet our table, the second you are done with your plate rest assured that a staff member will appear out of thin air to clean your table, the minute i leave my table and return someone is pulling the chair for me so that i can sit. They make you feel like royalty here, definitely recommend.",0.9852,0.78,0.211,0.009,0.38437499999999997

2015-04-27,5.0,"I took my boyfriend here for a birthday dinner this past Saturday night and we both left with big smiles and bigger bellies. Both the food and the service were amazing. It was our first time here and his first experience with a Brazilian steakhouse. I was so glad it was such a great first impression. We had a bit of a wait when we arrived but didn't mind because we were about 30 minutes early for our 7 o'clock reservation. Plus, there were servers bringing us baskets of fresh bread and offering us drinks. Once we were seated our server came over promptly to explain the process and to take our drink orders. She was even kind enough to pull my chair out for me. We began our meal with a quick visit to the market table. I kept my portions small in order to save room for the meats. However, the items I did select were so fresh and flavorful. The pineapple slices were sweet, the lettuce in my salad was crisp, and even the few olives I grabbed were firm and flavorful. It didn't take us long to finish our salads and as soon as our server brought us clean plates we flipped our cards over to green and welcomed the barrage of meat. Soon there were gauchos popping up presenting various skewers. Each of the meats that they offered us were piping hot and very tasty. My favorite was the fraldinha (bottom sirloin). So tender and full of flavor. I requested they bring in around again before we left. The house special picanha was a close second. Even for such a busy Saturday night our server was very attentive and made sure all of our needs were met. The restaurant manager was also floating around from table to table making sure everyone's dining experience was up to standard. We really appreciated that gesture. I would definitely recommend Fogo de Chao to others. It is very rare that you get amazing food with service to match these days. We were already making plans to return before our meal was even over. I'm so grateful to our server (the name on our receipt said Pool, not sure if that's correct) and appreciate the fact that she was so personable even with a packed house and even more people waiting to be seated. She certainly helped make my boyfriend's birthday dinner a success.",0.998,0.808,0.192,0.0,0.4973657548125634

2015-04-20,4.0,"We had an 8pm reservation Friday night for 6 people. We weren't seated until about 8:15 but the restaurant was pretty crowded and we had to sit at a table way in back. It was the first time for most of us and our waiter explained everything really well. They brought out the cheese bread (delicious), caramelized bananas (decent) and the polenta which I had never had before but really liked. They also brought out mashed potatoes, which were pretty good but nothing I would crave. We started with the salad bar which had a lot of choices. Some of my favorites included the spicy bacon, smoked salmon with capers, potato salad and taboulleh salad.  Meat started coming as soon as we flipped our cards to green. So many choices to pick from! Now, I am not a HUGE meat eater..I am pretty particular about what meats I eat and how they are cooked so in that respect, I didn't partake in a ton. I did try the chicken breast wrapped in bacon, the filet (well done) and one other that I can't remember and they were good. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meats and took advantage of trying everything. The food was constant.  Mid way through, a server came around with an alcohol cart asking if anyone wanted anything which I thought was cool. Everyone was stuffed but my friends found room for the key lime pie and the turtle cheesecake. I didn't try either but they seemed to like them. My only complaint was that soda comes in bottles so I paid $3 each time I wanted one. Sort of lame and I wish restaurants would stay away from that.  My bill was $51.50 for my food, $12 for my drinks and then I split the valet with my friend so it was a pricy night for sure.

The salad bar was a disappointment.  It was not as fully stocked and didn't have the variety that was shown in their photos or videos.  It definitely wasn't worth $26, which is the cost for anyone who doesn't want meat. The meat is tasty and plentiful although if you actually eat enough to get your monies worth ($51.50), you won't want to see meat for months.   All in all it was just okay, but I won't be back.  Been there, done that, got the t-shirt.",0.5767,0.907,0.067,0.026,0.34615384615384615

2015-04-02,3.0,"This was my first Brazilian Steakhouse, and I want to say before anything that I just may not be a Brazilian Steakhouse person. I love meat, but the flavor/quality of the meats were subpar in my opinion. The ribeye/beef cuts were very one note in their flavor (that note being salt) and the cuts were not very tender - I requested rare, it came rare, but was still surprisingly tough and didn't taste exciting. The lamb/sausage/chicken were actually pretty good, but the lamb is the only thing that stood out. I am very curious as to the marbling of the cuts of meat as well as their meat resting process.  The service however was pretty great. There were servers and 'floor managers?' that made sure individual table requests were met. Everyone was very pleasant and eager to help - this to me is what makes the place great. I also enjoy not having to agonize over menu options and how quick you can sit down and eat.  Overall, I'm glad I went - I just don't think I'll go again as there wasn't a meat I had that was particularly memorable.

The meats were literally cut right in front of you to the doneness  of your choice. I had a majority of my steaks medium rare- medium. Just the way I like it. There was also an open salad bar that consisted of cooked rice, different cheeses and deli meats...which I later took advantage of. The starters here weren't bad either.

Everything was hot as the servers made their rounds to tables. We were able to get the meat sliced and cooked to our liking in every passing.

That may not seem bad but I saw three people in a group who came in before us get seated and then a group of six get seated before us. The hostess told me I was set for the appointment but she wrote my name on the clipboard wrong so not sure how that could happen if my information was in the system. She kept giving excuse after excuse why we were not seated. Then when we sat down we were surrounded by three large long tables of people who came in a group. It was very loud. The servers would float around the big group tables more and we were even skipped. A couple next to use would get served while we would not. We got served our meat first before the potatoes, plantains, drinks, etc. Then when we got served one serving of meat it took about 10 minutes to be served again. Within 45 mins we were only seen about four times by anyone when it came to the meat. I did come here about 7 years ago in the daytime and did not have this problem but I guess if you are not in a group then you do not serve much of a purpose.

Our waiter was very nice and accommodating. A certain guy named Paul was extra attentive and nice. But the meat servers was just not the same. Most meats that we ate are chewy or raw or over cooked. Even if you asked just a little, they will still dump more than you asked for.  None of the meats were cooked right or served to us. I prefer medium and my spouse prefer medium well. Even the picanha tasted different which is suppose to be their specialty. We had to ask for garlic beef, picanha and beef ribs.  There was a lot of people but still not an excuse for servers not to know the meat that they are serving. Their food is not cheap and with the bill of $200, we were definitely dissapointed. Even with that, we still left a tip of 22%. Updated 06.18.16 Once again disappointed.  We could not find any reservation on other places therefore ended up once again in Chicago location.  The servers kept giving us the wrong meat temp, either too cook or bloody inside. The only meat that could not go wrong was the beef ribs.  When we asked for it the first time,  it was serve on a plate and so as the second one.  When we asked for more,  our waiter told us that they are out of them.  This was 8pm and a lot of people are still coming in.  When I complained, a host with eye glasses told me, they are cooking it and should take half an hour or do.  Half and hour passed, no beef ribs and our cravings are already gone.  This is just unacceptable especially they charge us a full price with one of the best meat not being available.  So, for future reference, you should ask for it the moment you get done with your salad.  We were so tempted to tip at 10% or none at all but our generosity got the best of us and still gave the minimum of 18%.",0.5122,0.841,0.085,0.074,0.4788382338382338

2015-01-30,5.0,"Best.  Birthday.  Dinner.  Ever. When my parents asked me where I wanted to go, there was no absolutely doubt in my mind: Fogo.  I'm the type of person that when prompted with the question ""....and what would you like as your side order?"" I typically respond with ""another portion of meat, please."" In other words: I like my bacon wrapped in bacon.  None of this vegan-friendly / gluten-free / trans-fat-free nonsense (although I'm sympathetic to those people, ' - free' anything just isn't my style.) So for turning a quarter century old (yikes), I wanted to indulge in a pure meat extravaganza......a meatstravaganza!  And that's precisely what Fogo de Chao delivers - a bounty of masterful cuts of beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and even sausage.  Before I get to the main event, I have to comment on their salad bar, as it is a sight to behold in its own right.  Smoked salmon, hearts of palm, asparagus, lots of charcuterie, and multiple aged cheeses adorn their 20ft cold buffet.  Special care should be taken to make sure one doesn't fill up on the pre-dinner!  Because..... You want meat?  You got it.  Succulent sirloin, first-class filet, ridiculously-good ribeye, unparalled parmesan pork loin, and exceptional lamb......there wasn't a single cut of meat that I pushed to the side of my plate.  My guess is that from the time I sat down until I walked out (okay, waddled out), I packed away 5lbs of meat.  Seriously guys, I don't think I've ever eaten so much in MY ENTIRE LIFE.  And were it not for the fact that it was a weeknight (and we'd been there for going on 2 hours), I would've continued to stay & eat, and then probably exploded and died from over-consumption, like a goldfish.  The service was so exemplary, it was almost overwhelming.  Although we had a head waiter who explained everything to us, several others came by to assist as needed, including (what looked like) the floor manager who was very gracious in getting me another slice of parmesan pork.  Everyone knows the system: you get a coaster with red / green sides that functions like a traffic light.  Green = 'go', bring me more stuff.  Red = 'stop', which I only used when I literally had no room left on my plate. Less than a minute after flipping the coaster from red to green, we were bombarded with skewers from every direction.  It was easily the most delicious danger I've ever been in.  Speaking of delicious and dangerous, I opted to get two desserts against my better judgment (I had far exceeded my threshold for food capacity).  The flan was delectable, and the papaya cream (Fogo's signature sweet dish) was light and the perfect way to cap off an incredible dining experience. I don't know what the bill totaled, but whatever it was I'm sure it was $$$ because good things are rarely cheap.  I passed out on the ride home after being in the nice warm car for all of 30 seconds, and when I dreamed, I dreamt of all the things I had at Fogo.  It was a good dream. Check that -- it was a GREAT dream.",0.9933,0.84,0.13,0.031,0.5954051796157059

First thing you should know is that if you're thinking spending over $50 a person, that you'll be surrounded by fine, upstanding, proper folk like yourself, this is not the place for you. I was appalled to see many people wearing ripped jeans and dirty sneakers. During dinner hours, they really should have a dress code. The behavior was on par with the attire; there was a group of people in the lobby encouraging their young children to twerk it whist waiting to be called. The worst part about this place was that you really shouldn't bother making a reservation. We were seated over 40 minutes after our reservation because they lump your reservation in with all the walk ins. We were celebrating an anniversary too. Nothing says romantic like getting sass from the hostess about why you're waiting. She told us they were behind because they ran out of scallops.... they don't have scallops... It wasn't all bad though. The food was quite good. While the cocktails are expensive, they are definitely worth it. And the cheese puffs are to die for. But it wasn't all roses after we sat down either. It's incredibly loud in the dining room, so again, unless shouting across the table is appealing to you, definitely not a place for a romantic occasion. Several hours after leaving, we both got very sick to our stomachs. We didn't over indulge (didn't get ""meat sweats"", as some yelpers call it), and neither of us have food allergies. It was that kind of sick you get after going to a Chinese buffet, you know, just 5 times more expensive. All in all, I will not be going back and recommend you heed my warning. If you don't mind the riff raff, save yourself $100 and go to Chili's. If you want an actual fine dining experience, stick to a real steak house that doesn't draw the all you can eat crowd.",0.9368,0.813,0.122,0.064,0.49841269841269853

Lombo - pork loin cut with grated parmesan - simply delicious. Others to keep an eye out for - Filet Mignon (although this is a tough one on me...

This is the standard for a Brazilian steakhouse, but many have said that Fogo de Chao is the best! After being seated the server invited us to enjoy the salad bar.  This might be the best salad bar ever!  Very elegant with over-the-top choices.  Smoke salmon, salami, fresh mozzarella, parmesan cheese, and guyere cheese just to get started.  Unbelievable sun-dried tomatoes, kale, and an olive bar are just a few of the choices I had.  I went back for seconds. The meats are the star of the show.  You are given a card, one side green (keep it coming!), and one side red.  I tried to sample almost every cut of meat, all pit fired and moist.  Each server will give you about a 2-3 oz. cut of meat.  I can remember the following cuts of meat...... Filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken breast, NY strip, leg of lamb, rack of lamb (my favorite!), pork medallions and the list goes on.  On top of that, the server will automatically bring you some tasty sides.  Mashed potatoes, fried plantains, yucatans, and Yorkshire pudding.  Just a well-balanced great meal! There is even a push cart liquor bar too!  Definitely recommend this restaurant if you are very hungry and in the mood while visiting in Chicago.  My green card disappeared at some point or the server took it away from me!  About $50 per head before drinks.  Stop in and indulge!",0.9812,0.783,0.147,0.07,0.49583333333333335

2014-11-30,4.0,"To be fair, this place deserves 5 stars. The food is excellent, the service is top-notch and pricing is good. Why am I giving it only 4 stars? The place is a bit too intense for me. That may sound crazy to some but hear me out. When you go to Fogo de Chao, they give you a chip to set by your place setting that you flip over based on if you want meat (green side) or not (red side). When you flip it to the green side, a server (or several) are at your side within seconds offering you anything your heart could desire. It's actually a wonderful and ingenious concept for meat-lovers. I went to Fogo de Chao about a year ago for my birthday. I share the same week with a friend so I choose the pre-dinner cocktail place (16 in the Trump Tower - read my review of 16 here:  yelp.com/biz/sixteen-chi… ) and she chose Fogo for dinner. I think the group was about 20 people in all.  When you have that many people dining together at Fogo de Chao, at least 5 chips are always flipped to the green side and you always have at least 5 servers at your table - usually a few more as each server only has one meat to serve. That combined with conversations going on and constantly being interrupted by having to choose a meat....the experience was a bit overwhelming.  That is why I'm giving this restaurant deserving of 5-stars only 4-stars. The servers at Fogo de Chao are a bit too good at their jobs. Would I go back? Maybe...but with two friends max.

2014-11-29,5.0,"I had a really pleasant experience at Fogo de Chao. It's always been a fun, nice, and tasty restaurant for me. I would go for a semi-special occasion rather than a last minute meal; however, I saw many business people there and some tourists during my last visit. Fogo de Chao is a LOT of food (think fancy buffet) and I prefer to starve myself and mentally prepare for the onslaught. I was seated with my new favorite server Roberto. He was charming, accommodating, and attractive. He recommended the Catina Vista Flores Malbec; a delicious wine and less expensive than the one I first requested. I highly recommend it also. Besides Roberto, the manager and other staff provided perfect examples of good service. They gave me sides to go with all of my meat: bread, polenta fries, and plantains. I liked all of my meat, but I discovered that my favorites were the ones that were encrusted with parmesan cheese or wrapped in bacon. My strategy was to focus on eating meat first, followed by a side or two, and then a visit to the Harvest Bar. The Harvest Bar was alright. I remember thinking that it was the best part of Fogo de Chao years ago; however, now I prefer the meat and sides. Regardless, it was still easy to find scrumptious options at the Harvest Bar. It's hard to say what separates Fogo de Chao from Zed 451. Perhaps Fogo de Chao is slightly more formal whereas Zed 451 is slightly more trendy? I'm not sure. I can definitely assert that Fogo de Chao provided a fabulous service experience and that the food and wine were wonderful.

The salad bar was awesome as always. The issue was really with the service - or lack there of.   The servers and managers are quick to tell you that if there is any specific meats you would like to just ask.   A couple of the guys asked for a one of the meats (not the filet - actually the strip steak) to be brought back several times over the course of 20-30 minutes to no avail. The service on some of the additional requests was slow at best and after about a half hour became increasingly more spaced apart even though several people had their chips green side up. We ordered desserts and were talking as one of the managers literally stood and stared at us as he needed the table for another reservation as he told us as we departed less than 2 hours after arriving.

With our salad bar option we also received the amazing sides (fried polenta, fried bananas, cheese popovers, and garlic mashed potatoes). Our server, Anna, was very friendly and helpful!

Right after we got our first plates, a server brought out a plate of hot sauteed veggies. They were our favorite thing of the meal!

The meat is delicious and cooked to perfection. My favorites were not even the fancy bacon-wrapped filet, but actually the chicken leg (meat fell off of the bone), and the pork sausages (so much flavor in such a cute lil' sausage!). Also, the salad/side bar was so amazing I could have made a meal just out of that. But luckily, I didn't have to, because meat-swords. I took off a star for two reasons: 1. As others have mentioned, CRAZY drink prices. I paid $10.00 a glass for a wine I can get for $8.00 a bottle at the grocery store. 2. Pushy about add-on a la carte items. I am already paying over $50 for dinner here. Why are they trying to nickel-and-dime customers with random shrimp cocktail appetizers? It was just bizarre and way too pushy. When we sat down our server informed us about the shimp, which we politely declined. 10 minutes later another server came over WITH THE APPETIZER and offered it to us again. NO MEANS NO, SHRIMP MAN.

2014-10-04,5.0,"We booked a reservation via Open Table...and then I changed the time-also easy via Open Table, so that combination works nicely.  This was to celebrate 2 years with my girlfriend.   When we arrived, I realized I used to live pretty close to this place, but never knew it was there.  It was always this mythical experience that was talked about with friends and family that had been there before.  All you can eat meats, delicious side dishes, excellent service, and all you can eat meats (yes, it is that important to say it twice).   From the moment we walked in, the service was great.  We were seated immediately, staff members pulled out the chairs for both of us (I'm not used to people doing that for me...), and then helped us get started.  That theme of excellent service continued throughout the night.  Between plate refreshes (swapping your plate for a cleaner one), additional drinks, and the people walking around with SWORDS OF MEAT, it was awesome.  It also surprised me that they had people walking around who would brush off the little flakes of meat that end up on the table cloth...so the table always looked impeccable.   The food-we both did a trip to the salad bar, but I mostly got the cold meats...and a few leaves of spinach/kale/arugula to say I had veggies with the meal.  If you're like me, the fact that they even have a salad bar is an afterthought.  The sides were good-the mashed potatos tasted perfect, the cheese roll/bread things were good, the fried polenta tasted excelelnt, and the carmelized bananas were an excellent dessert in themselves.  I tried a bite or two of each of the sides...but that was just the beginning.... The meat!  As soon as you flip your card over to the green side, people holding swords full of meat appear, what seemed like in droves.  If you've read ANY of my other restaurant reviews, you know that that is what I like-delicious meats served in mass.  There were times where I had at least 3 different animals on my plate.  All of them were great in different ways.  From what I remember, the Top Sirloin (the picanha one, bacon wrapped Fillet Mignon, and Bottom Sirloin were my favorite.  Granted, I have a beef bias-my Grandpa raises Black Angus Cattle.  The only two meats I don't remember eating from their list were the 2 ribs (beef & pork).  I'm not complaining, I don't remember the last time I ate that much quality meat-ever.   We were both stuffed, but since it was a special night...we opted for dessert.  We split their signature Papaya Cream with creme de cassis on top based off of the recommendation from one of our waiters, she said it was the most common one when people were feeling full.  It was delicious...but we couldn't finish it.  Great flavors, it hit whatever spots hadn't quite been satisfied (mostly the sweet one), and left us in delightful food comas.   The drinks...this is where it was mixed.  If you want a cocktail or wine-they had a wide variety of options that were thought out nicely.  They had signature cocktails, and wines that paired nicely with the overall meal...and then the beer list said ""Ask server about our domestic/import/craft beers"".  Ok, I'm a beer guy.  I don't typically drink cocktails, and I can't tell you the last time I had wine.  The beer list was mediocre.  It was closer to what you'd expect at a ball park.  I remember them saying Bud Light, Budweiser, Goose Island (it was Honkers Ale), and then I think a few more of the domestic-y beers.  That'd be the only place that I'd ding them.  However, they had beers that I like, so no big deal.  The focus was on the food.  I'll drink my craft/micro/local beer at home as a night cap.   Overall?  I'll def be back for a special occasion.  The cost isn't something I could swing on a regular basis...I think we sent around $130 each w/2 drinks each, split dessert, and tip.",0.9987,0.823,0.161,0.016,0.5951552415838132

Sat at our table with dirty plates for almost 20 minutes. Had the expected drive-by ""are you seeking any particular cuts sir?""  No, not really.   What I'd like is a clean plate and to have the gauchos come around again and I'll choose.  There are a number of meats that they rarely bring out -- we never saw them during this visit, although there were others in the restaurant enjoying their Parmesan Pork, Sausages and a number of these other ""very rare"" Fogo items.   Fogo is now hawking a ""Shrimp Appetizer"" which is a bit tacky given that they make seafood items available at the salad bar and have no other one-off items available for purchase as part of the core dining experience.   Drinks were served relatively promptly, however the service that we've come to expect - where your plate is constantly replaced the first time you turn your head has disappeared.  Or perhaps was only available in the front dining room.   And this is very first time that I've ever had to clean my salad plate and continue to use it for meat rather than having the plate replaced.  Yes, perhaps somewhat petty items.  But not for Fogo, when you are paying premium price for a premium experience.  It's clear the place is starting to go downhill from its heyday in the 2000's.   Oh, and was there for my birthday nonetheless.   Ironically, checked in on 4square which promptly told me I'd not checked in there for a little more than a year.

The management and staff here are so copiously friendly and helpful and genuinely cheerful it still boggles my mind how amazingly nice they are even in such an insanely fast paced work environment. 5 stars just for the great crew, I wish I had remembered names but I am terrible at remembering names. Given that I ate here just hours ago I am sure they can glance at the schedule.  Oh yes, the food. Salad bar was superb, everything was as fresh as can be, the mozzarella was probably the best I have had, the prosciutto was lovely, and the salmon was divine. I don't know why I like heart of palm so much but that is fantastic too. Combining meat, cheeses and various greens always leads to a perfect and savory bite. I had to try hard not to eat too much from the ""salad"" bar (Which i could easily make the entire meal and still be ecstatic about my experience) to save room for what must have been the 3 cows I then devoured. Their signature Picanha cut steals the show, if you don't know what cut that is they provide the 411 of all their numerous selections on a handy menu card provided at each table. The decadent supply of meats are so perfectly cooked and seasoned, every bite gives me the Andrew Zimmern have to put the fork down and ""omg"" face. (If you watch any Bizzare Foods episodes, you know what I am talking about). I also have probably the pickiest girlfriend in terms of food, and being that she now ranks this as one of the top 3 dinners she has had in her lifetime really says something about the place. Great wine selection too, I prefer a decent Malbec as it pairs well with all their red meats. Nothing like some Argentine wine with a Brazilian BBQ (ha) You get never ending sides throughout the entire meal and they offer a great break in between stuffing your face with the strong, umptuous flavors from the meat parade. If you want something that hasn't come around yet, worry you not, the wait staff always asks if you need something specific and how you want it cooked, and will send it right on over to you. Yes this place is amazing, yes it is worth the money, yes you should go here, and if you have self esteem issues, the service will leave you feeling like a King, albeit a King who now needs a nap due to impending food coma and severe overindulgence. I am good on eating anything for a couple days. Cheers",0.9986,0.722,0.218,0.06,0.5779838217338218

2014-07-05,4.0,"I was here for lunch with a group of five friends. We had reservations, but I'm not sure we needed them - there were a good number of people in the restaurant, but we did spot a lot of empty tables. I will also confess that I'm the kind of person who makes placeholder reservations - which means I estimate high and make a reservation as soon as I know I'll be going, which means I had made a reservation for 8 over a week ago and corrected downwards a couple days ago.  Of the initial dishes they gave us (caramelized banana, mashed potatoes, and polenta, and cheese bread), we absolutely loved the banana, mashed potatoes, and especially the cheese bread. We ate at least five bowls of cheese bread between the five of us, in addition to four plates of banana...  Their salad bar is also exactly the kind of salad I like - because it's not really salad, its also lox and prosciutto. I will say that most of their leafy green salads also came with cheese in them, which, for someone who doesn't eat dairy, was a little inconvenient.  The meat itself was fantastic. Things I would highly recommend: the picanha and the bacon-wrapped filet mignon.  The only thing that demoted this experience from five to four stars was that I spent at least half the meal trying to get another slice of picanha. I ordered it twice with two different people, and then I saw a man walking around with it who walked right past our table twice and never offered us any... I did eventually get it, and I compensated by asking for way too much, but it was otherwise a fantastic experience!",0.9773,0.87,0.105,0.025,0.5507877718988831

2014-06-01,2.0,"I should preface this review by saying that I'm a pescetarian and ended up at Fogo de Chao due to a business dinner. I went in with low expectations and Fogo de Chao actually beat them, so bravo on that. I've happened upon a brazilian steakhouse from time to time and I know the drill when it comes to me. I say give me the salad bar, I convince the servers to stop shoving meat into my face, and I leave happy that I'm able to leave. The salad bar at Fogo de Chao is below the quality of what I've encountered in other brazilian steakhouses, more of a focus on just putting veggies out there than actually pulling together any marinated salads or anything like that. I was happy that they offer a fish option but was really surprised how enthusiastic the servers were about me ordering this. ""Oh, you don't eat meat, you're REALLY going to love this fish, it's amazing!"" Really? Really Fogo de Chao? People come here all the time for endless meat on skewers, but your fish is amazing? Everyone else is just missing out. The fish was fine, but nothing to write home about or to justify their enthusiasm. Had the tres leches cake for dessert. Maybe most people don't make it this far (as they've filled up on meat) but given that I didn't have that problem I was up for the challenge. Again, the tres leches cake was HIGHLY recommended by the server (fool me once?), it was fine, but again, not worth the enthusiasm. Hopefully if you find your way to Fogo de Chao you're here for the plentiful meat served on skewers, but if that's not your thing, you should probably rethink your choice.",0.993,0.804,0.165,0.032,0.5526000000000001

Their mixed drinks are also very good.  The cocktails run around $12, but they are heavy handed on the liquor so they are worth it.  Let them know if you are there for a special. occasion and they will ensure you have a special evening.

We got there right when they opened, I do not recommend doing this, I will get to that later; when we walked in we went to the bar for a drink, and we were given a pager. They had a great variety of Tropical drinks, the Bartender was very polite, and no sooner after we got our drinks our pager went off to be seated.  They told us to help ourselves to the massive salad bar, it was very impressive and clean. Once they saw we were done with our salad plates, they brought us new plates, and you are given a little round disk, one side is green and one side is red, so we put it to the green side and within seconds the first cut of meat showed up, then within seconds a different type of meat showed up for the taking, and so on, until you turn your disk to the red side. There was a Manager type coming to our table a lot and asking if everything was ok, did we need anything, we always said no, but with it just having opened for the day, not all of their meat options were available yet, so we just kept getting the same cuts of meat offered to us.  It was a very expensive place, and I would think that they would start cooking the meat in time to be ready for the opening hour, so people who make early res. can enjoy all that they have to offer. So as we were ready to go, that's when the big racks of ribs, and other racks of meat started to come out.  And it seemed as we were both on the red side, the man stopped coming to our table, and they never refilled our basket of hot rolls, until my Husband was signing the check.

I made a mistake in the number of people showing up, and was able to call and get it changed, no problem. When we arrived, we were given a pager--it took longer than I would have assumed with a reservation, but when you factor in it being a Friday night, it only seems natural the place was poppin'. Once we were seated, we got the 411 on churrascurias and began a meal of epic proportions.  My mom opted out of the meat portion, but was overwhelmed and overjoyed at the bounty the salad bar presented. They even made her special plates of grilled veggies swimming in garlic goodness that were to-die-for. The sides kept on coming. Just as soon as our fried bananas were gone, two more plates appeared in their place. The servers were constantly asking if we had any special meat requests (um, yes, I'll have more of the garlic beef that's out-of-this-world) and would promptly bring cuts of whatever we wanted. Once the entire table had had their fill (and then some), a server popped over to discreetly ask what type of dessert my dad wanted for his birthday, on the house. We went with the turtle cheesecake.

Scratch breakfast, scratch lunch, and just drink water to prepare your body for the endless meat craftsmen begging to drop more tender, well-seasoned protein on your plate. The sides compliment well: I keep asking for more fried bananas, cheesy mashed potatoes, fried polenta, and, most notably, the cheese bread balls. If all of that wasn't enough, the salad bar alone is top notch, carrying fine meats, cheeses, and fresh produce to help you justify the damage you're going to do to your internal systems. Keep that card on green, my friends; there is bacon wrapped filet Mignon, pork rib, lamb, and all sorts of beef cuts to indulge in. So you may ask: why 4/5 stars? Because the meal is upwards of $50 sans drink and/or dessert.

The meat: naturally some of the selections taste better than the others. There were a couple options that had been seasoned with garlic and those tasted wonderful, but some options were quite bland.

2014-04-07,4.0,"Service is amazing here, with meat servers, wait staff, bus staff, and a couple of management type people all competing to make sure every need is filled. They have the service aspect down. Ordering is pretty easy, as most everyone gets the all you can eat meat. They do try to get you to order a shrimp appetizer before you start feeding. I recommend declining, as this will decrease your future consumption of meat. It did look good however. The salad bar is outstanding, with several unusual, and tasty, vegetables, cheeses, and meats represented. The salad bar only option would be a good choice here too. Once the card is turned to green, the meat servers start coming faster than you can possibly keep up. We found a frequent green to red to green sequence was necessary to avoid having the meat servers becoming too frequent and annoying. The meats are mostly very good. However, I like my meats very, very rare. This is hard to get here. Most of the time I ended up with the medium to medium rare that others at my table were getting. While three different meat servers promised to return with rare meat, only one did. And it was medium anyway. Personally, I was not a fan of the garlic beef, the parmesan crusted pork, and the sausage. However, the other 13 meats made up for these not being great. They comped us a big piece of Tres Leches cake for a birthday. It was outstanding. If the rare meat issue could be handled better, this would be a five star review.

2014-03-27,5.0,"THE FOOD (5 stars out of 5): Everything here is amazing. I can't stress that enough. If you like meat, this is the best place to be. If you don't, the salad bar was delicious. Paying the dinner fee gets you unlimited access to BOTH. The meat is definitely steakhouse quality, and there are so many options that come right to your table as much as you want. It's expensive (about as much as going to any other steakhouse in Chicago) but you get SO MUCH more for your money. Also, the cheese bread that they bring (unlimited) is out of this world! THE SERVICE (5 of 5): Service here is great. All the servers are friendly, attentive, and they come by whenever you need anything. Once you flip your card to green, the gaucho chefs come by immediately. And they come in succession so that by the time your card has been green for 5 minutes you've probably had 10 of the 16 meats offered to you already. If you don't want to be bothered or you need a break, flip the card back to red and they stop immediately. Also, if you want to try something specific, you can call over a server and they can have that chef come over to your table.  THE AMBIANCE (5 of 5): It was pretty packed, but it's a big place with high ceilings so you don't feel too crowded. The first table we got was near the front door, but we asked to move further into the dining room and they accommodated us with no problem. Our new table was right in the middle of the action and close to the salad bar. Great table. Right next to a waterfall wall.  BOTTOM LINE (5 of 5): While I would only go here for special occasions (you get more for your money but it's still pricey for an average evening), it is easily one of my favorite restaurants and dining experiences I've ever had. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. If you want to try it and don't want to pay as much, go for lunch (same deal for $32.50).",0.99,0.827,0.142,0.031,0.46439960832817967

2014-03-16,4.0,"Fogo de Chao - 661 N La Salle, Chicago Once in a while, I guess you get a hankering to stuff your face into oblivion.   For us, that time was last weekend - after an extremely long couple days at work for both of us, we felt like Fogo would be a great choice to fill that urge. And I'm thankful that my fiancee often suggest things like this.  Yes, I know you're jealous.... There's probably not many out there reading this who don't know what Fogo is about - it's a Brazilian steakhouse, a churascarria where gauchos come around and slice off different cuts of meat on a stick.  They started popping up like wildfire around 10 years ago in different chains - Fogo, Texas de Brazil, Brazzaz, Sal and Carvao, and some independant variations like Zed 451.   Of these, I've always felt like Fogo is at the top. The salad bar is impressive as well.  In fact, I think 98% of people who dine here joke that they're going to come back just for the salad bar (the other 2% are vegetarians who do that anyways).   The salad choices are vast and range from standard lettuce options, to antipasti style roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and olives, along with a decent selection of cheese, some cured prosciutto and salami, and an out of place spread of smoked salmon.  They added some nice endive leaves that I didn't recall from last time, as well as a mango salad that freshend up the plate a bit. One of the highlights of Fogo is the ""pao de queijo"" or the cheezy poofs, as I like to call them - Very airy, soft, melt in your mouth buttery rolls with hints of cheese that is reminiscent of a mild Mexican cheese, like a chihuahua or a queso fresco.   Thankfully, there a number of recipes that we're looking forward to trying when we start our kitchen remodel in a few days. After finishing the salad, I flipped my coaster to green and started the extravaganza..... My advice here is go for the Brazilian specialities - the quality of the meat is good, but not prime, so you want the meats that are better seasoned.  I love the bone-on pork ribs here, great crust and a meaty texture like a St. Louis Rib with a smoky flavor that's enhanced with a dense, salty dry rub (probably a bit too salty for most).   The garlic beef is also a great cut that's deeply marinated and cut a bit thicker than the rest of the choices.  The chicken choices are surprisingly good, heavy on the salt rub, but very tender and fall off the bone.   And finally, the linguica sausage is perfectly cooked, juicy on the inside and has a very different flavor and texture profiles than the rest of the cuts on the menu. The filets, ribeyes, and sirloin cuts are solid, but nothing extraordinary.  Stick with the Brazilian cuts and the spices - if you want great filet or ribeye, go to a steakhouse. And ignore the sides - the plantains are good - the potatoes and polenta cakes are alright but just serve to fill you up faster......

2014-03-15,4.0,"First time in a place like this, and I'd say it was an interesting experience. We were late for 6:30 reservations on a Thursday and were seated within 5 minutes, there was a decent amount of people in the place. We ordered Mango Refresco and the Daiquiri for drinks, which were both great, but a unanimous decision ruled the Mango Refresco was the better of the two. The drinks were very slow to come out, for some reason it took over 10 minutes for 2 cocktails. One member of our group ordered a second one and that one too took about 10 minutes to come out. Understandable I guess, it was pretty busy. I must mention the service, because it was both really awesome, but kind of confusing at the same time. Our ""server(?)"" who first greeted us when we sat down was nice, and advertised a couple shrimp appetizers not included in the buffet/samplings, which we passed on. We needed a few minutes to look at the drink menu, so she left and said we can help ourselves to the salad bar. After not showing her face for about 10 minutes, another gentleman came by and took our drink order, served us the first round of drinks, and checked back on us a little later. Anyway, the gaucho chefs who run around with the meats were all very professional and accommodating, as well as the bussers. We were very pampered with fresh plates every couple minutes, refilled waters, chairs being pushed in, and as we were leaving I received some surprising (but charming) help with my coat, how nice. The whole green/red flip card is a pretty cool concept, when it's green the chefs all flock to your table like birds. Some of the meats are cooked to a desired temperature, and they did a great job of cutting those temperatures in a expeditious manner. Anyway, our ""server(?)"" only made 2 other appearances, one time to bring the late drink, and another time for the check, which I wanted to split among certain group members, but she insisted on doing it ""evenly"" with several different cards. This was frustrating because some people didn't order $10+ drinks. Not that big of an issue, I suppose I should have made it clear from the beginning how to divide the checks, but ended up just throwing it all on one card. Now onto the massive amounts of wonderful consumables... The salad bar was intriguing, and pretty big. I wouldn't say worth $30 for the lunch salad bar alone, but it had a variety of fresh options to make a couple large plates. Lots of cool stuff: fresh arugula, sun dried-tomatoes, fresh mozz balls, and some surprisingly AWESOME prosciutto. There was also some black beans and possibly soup/hot items that I didn't really look at. Then there was the MEATS! We all simultaneously flipped our cards to green and were instantly attacked by skewer-wielding gaucho chefs. I won't review all the meats individually, but the ones that stuck out to me after trying just about all of them were the top and bottom sirloins, bacon-wrapped filet, parmesan pork loin and lamb leg. I didn't particularly care for the chicken leg or beef ribs, but to each his own. Its very hard to keep track of the different cuts, let alone remember them and write about them, however, one of the highlights was the crispy edges on one of the sirloins. The smoky (but not burnt) flavor combined with a melt-in-your-mouth texture of the perfectly-cooked and sliced beef was quite memorable. Alongside the meats were some sides included with dinner. Mashed potatoes, fried bananas, cheesy bread rolls and polenta French fries. These were all wonderful, the cheesy bread had a really cool foamy texture and the polenta French fries were quite tasty. To conclude, we had a lot of fun at Fugo de Chao, and definitely ate as much as we could. Although expensive, I would say that the all-you-can-eat high quality, flavorful meats and large salad bar make it very worth it on occasion. We will definitely be back, and I would like to try some similar places (Zed451, Brazzaz) for comparison.",0.9986,0.794,0.165,0.042,0.5238230625583569

The salad bar almost made me horny. It is huge and chalk full of fresh, bright produce, special proteins like smoked salmon and prosciutto, mozzarella balls and yummy salad dressings. Additionally, the side dishes were a fun experience and were replenished quicker than we could eat them.

That would be a waste. My faves are the top sirloin, the picanha and alcatra are tender and super juicy; the sausage is mighty tasty, the lamb, and the pork loin covered in parmesan cheese. Some of the meat can be dry, but this experience is all about getting to try it all. I stay away from the chicken because sometimes it can be dry and overdone compared to some of the other cuts of meat. You can probably skip dessert, there isn't anything super stand out.

Lucky for me restaurant week was still going on so for $44 a person we got their regular meal, access to the salad bar, and even two desserts. Normally I think it is $50 a person without dessert so that was a pretty good deal. The only bad thing I have to say about Fogo is that you will be so overwhelmed with wonderful food, you will most likely eat yourself sick. I know we did, but the misery was worth it! They do not waste any time here once you flip your card to green. Within seconds people are swarming your table with delectable offerings. We had to flip our card back to red multiple times just to have a few minutes to eat uninterrupted. Some of our favorites were the Brazilian prime rib, the lamb chops, and the parmesan pork. The never ending sides of fried banana, mashed potatoes, and fried polenta dusted with parmesan were divine. Don't even get me started on those cheese rolls that are so light you literally eat twenty before you realize what you have done.

But generally speaking, we saw the earnest attentiveness of the staff. I agree with some of the reviewers that the meats tasted rather similar. And I am led to believe that the staff brings you a bunch of lower-quality or less-expensive meat to fill you up. For meat lovers, I guess they wouldn't complain. On to the GNATS: there was a persistent group of gnats right above our dining table that was present the whole time we were seated at our table. When we finally flagged the staff, the manager came to apologize and moved us to another area, away from the wall of waterfall where we had been seated. The manager apologized, explained that they thought the problem had gone away, and we together speculated that the gnats may have something to do with the wall of waterfall next to us. After the manager moved us, he got us fresh glasses of the wines we each had, fresh plates of meat, etc. Good service, but this was the least they could do. I don't believe in punishing the restaurant for the gnats in this review. However, considering that my friend and I were gracious in our reactions and not difficult at all with them, they could have offered more. Do I suffer from entitlement? Perhaps. Restaurants of this supposed repute and caliber in Japan refuse to charge customers anything for the whole meal if customers find a hair in the food, the entire staff will come apologize in single file, etc. The manager gave us second glasses of our wines on the house, but they could have offered more.

Especially one that serves up some of the best Steak in town? I saved all my room for the delicious meat Fogo had to offer. I had no use for any rabbit food.   This smorgasbord of meat is just what I needed on a cold, January day. Fogo offers every type of meat a carnivore like me could ask for. I sampled Flank Steak, Rib Steak, Pork Shoulder and Filet Mignon. All of the meat was delicious beyond words. For those foo foo eaters out there, Fogo does offer a buffet stocked with salad, cheese, potato's and assorted cold cuts. I did try some of the cheese, but only a tad. I reserved all the stomach space I could for the carnage of red meat I was about to enjoy. And what a lovely carnage it was.   Here's a little hint for the thrifty. If you hit Fogo at lunch, you get the same great experience for half the price. All you can eat steak and unlimited access to the buffet. Granted, after eating all that meat, you might not want to go back to your office without a pillow.   Here's the bottom line:  If you're a meat whore like I am and you want to sample every kind of Steak imaginable, head on down to Fogo de Chao. The food, service and atmosphere were all top notch.

Place.  Unlike anywhere I've ever been before- Fogo de Chao is an all meat all the time type of place and that is a magical thing. And we're not just talking your typical strip steak or pork chops.  Take a look at this list: Picanha, Top Sirloin seasoned with garlic. Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon. Costela, fall of da bone beef ribs. Cordeiro, lamb cooked in a fresh mint marinade. Linguica, spicy sausages. And my favorite- Lombo, which I think I can confidently say is the most delicious piece of pork loin I've ever had.  Did I mention that it's crusted in a crunchy parmesan crust. Oh and they do offer up a salad bar (veggies, cheeses, etc) and a variety of {unlimited} side dishes (polenta, mashed potatoes, carmelized bananas). And for those not familiar with the Brazilian Steakhouse thing here's what happens: hostess seats you with a single page menu and a round card (think the size of a index card).  One side is green, the other red.  After the waiter stops by to take your drink order you're welcome to head up to the salad bar.  Whenever you're ready- flip your card over to the green side.  Green = go meat.  Waiters circle around the restaurant with platters of meat all night long.  If your card is green they'll stop at your table and offer you up a slice.  Had enough/need a break/meat coming too quick = turn your card over to red.  Waiters won't stop if your card is red.   You'll also receive a platter of side dishes to enjoy.  But lets be real you're not going to have much of those potatoes.  The meat is what you came for... and the meat is what you'll eat.  Trust. Drinks are mighty delicious.  I suggest any of the traditional Brazillian drinks.  Between the two of us we tried a few and each was just as good as the last.  I can't really comment on the pricing, I was fortunate in that I came with a sales rep and he picked up the bill.... But I think it's about $50 per person.  Typically this would be a bit pricy for me but a) I wasn't buying and b) for the amount of food and quality of meat you get I would totally go back and spend $50 of my next paycheck.  So friggin' delicious.  And the staff was so nice, I asked for another round of that parmesan crusted pork and it was brought it right over, really awesome surface.

Service was excellent. As I said before, I had never been here but the waiter did a great job explaining how the dinner setup was. Not to mention the servers coming at you with food at a rapid fire rate.  Let me just say, I can agree that this is a great family restaurant. But can you imagine if you took a date to this place? As a guy, I can imagine me eating so much meat and the woman across from me staring at me in disgust: ""How can you eat so much food?""

Not a problem because we were able to get drinks and seats in the bar area while we waited.  Everything on the salad bar looked fresh.  I especially enjoyed the manchengo cheese.  All the meat was absolutely delicious.  I loved that each piece they cut off for you has been char-grilled to perfection.  I think that once the gauchos have cut off all the outside grilled meat, they take it back to re-grill it so each piece can have that delicious grilled taste.  The best was the house specialty steak seasoned with garlic. I was really only impressed with one side at the table. My absolute favorite food of the night was probably the cheesy bread puffs. Make sure you try them. The mashed potatoes and fried polenta were just ok.  The fried bananas were pretty good.   Service was great.  If you want certain meats, just let one of the gauchos know and they will send it over almost immediately.  Overall this was a great experience and I am hoping to make it back sometime soon!",0.9975,0.646,0.319,0.035,0.6609737484737485

Tables should be put aside for those that took the time to make the reservation.  Once this is sorted out, it'll be a 5/5 experience.  Cheers.",0.8225,0.841,0.131,0.028,0.85

When we arrived the hostess said it would be just a minute on our table and pointed us in the direction of the bar, always a good direction for us ;) To our surprise the table was ready before we had even gotten our drinks. We made our way to the table - this place is huge - and on our way walked by the beautiful salad bar. Now this isn't just any salad bar, they have these amazing cheeses and prosciutto, tons of veg, smoked salmon and on top of that a bomb salad bar.  The 1st waitress to come to the table explained how the dining worked. They give you a small circle coaster like thing and one side is green the other is red. When you are on green the servers will come over and offer you whatever meat the are serving - red means you are ok for the time being. The waiters were so attentive - it was amazing. He came over and asked how we were and if there was anything we'd like to try. The BF was dying for some lamb and within a minute multiple cuts made their way to our table. They brought us over some side dishes (polenta cakes, mashed potatoes and bananas) and these heavenly rolls that just melted in my mouth. YUM.  The polenta was amazing but overall we tried to save room for the meat fest. The chicken was so crispy on the outside and steaming hot, juicy and perfectly cooked. Actually, everything was perfectly cooked. It was so impressive - literally everything was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The servers asked how you like the meat cooked and will cut you the perfect bit. We like med - med rare and a few times they didn't have it but they assured us they'd be right back with that temperature and they actually remembered and came out within the next few minutes. The waitress even convinced us to have this amazing papaya dessert - it was creamy and a great way to finish the meal.  I am most excited because when we were wrapping up the meal the assistant manager came over to ask how things were. We told him we had an amazing dinner and that they should open a place in NYC. He told us they are and it should open in December. He took my information and told me he would have them contact us to attend the grand opening so I reallllllllly hope that does happen!!

Drinks were high quality and they came around with an after dinner drink cart as well.  Desserts were a little disappointing, but again true to the cuisine.   Ambience is ok -- feels a bit touristy and too bright, but perhaps that's necessary given all the meat carving going on!

2013-10-27,5.0,"I have been to a few churrascarias in Manhattan and Queens, and Fogo de Chao in Chicago has the best meat of them all. The salad bar is mediocre (for a brazilian steakhouse) and the mixed drinks are too sugary, but the meat more than makes up for it. Here is my advice- save the salad bar for last. Hold back on everything. Switch your ""chip"" to the meat and have your first bite be either the garlic picanha or the lamb chop. Incredible. Normally, I prefer thick cut ribeye, but at Fogo the thinly sliced sirloin picanha is amazing. Tied with first place, the lamb rib chops are some of the best I've ever had anywhere - slightly charred on the outside, juicy on the inside. The filet mignon (with or without bacon) comes in second, and then the beef ribs, which were velvety soft and sliced off the bone for easy eating. You have to ask for the beef ribs specially, I am not sure why. The other sirloin cuts were good - the t boned lamb chop was ok. Don't bother with the chicken and my friends found the pork to be only so-so. Ask for a few of the sauces, not that the meat really needs it. What is amazing is how different each cut of beef tastes. The marinades are subtle, the grilling is perfect and so is the carving of the beef. After the first round or two of beef, take a break and enjoy the fried bananas and polenta. The cheese biscuits were so-so and the mashed potatoes were disappointing. The salad bars did not have any of the seafood dishes associated with Brazilian steakhouses. But there was potato salad. Potato salad?? I don't think so. I took some arugula and hearts of palm with some dressing as a palate cleanser. The dressing was a bit heavy. There are some heavy or strongly flavored dishes at the salad bar - all the more reason to save it for after the meat. The service was good - but perhaps a bit over-enthusiastic. It is easy to have your plate covered in 5 cuts of meat in 5 minutes. Try a couple of things at a time and then turn your chip over. Go for the quality of the beef and lamb - everything else is secondary.",0.9946,0.809,0.15,0.041,0.5086563307493539

Upon arrival we paid $12 to valet our car, which was to be expected. The place was completely packed which was a good sign. We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation and was seated on time.  As we were brought to our table, it was still dirty from the previous customers and the staff cleaned it as we stood and waited. A bit awkward.  The initial gaucho who welcomed us and explained the restaurant seemed upset and made very little eye contact with us while speaking to us about Fogo. This was the last time we saw him all night.

As noted, most of these things can be forgiven due to the volume of meat, and for the volume, it is worth the price.  The thing is, the quality isn't good enough for this to be more than the occasional gluttony palace and for that, I liked Texas de Brazil better (until it closed...).

I tried to sneak some in my purse, but they took the basket away too fast!  The best meat option was the parmesan crusted pork.   The salad bar was underwhelming to me. The second time I went there, it took us about an hour and half before anyone brought over the parmesan pork and when they did, I was really disappointed.  The pork was so tough and dry that I couldn't even finish it.  Also, this time I used their restroom.  Be careful if you ever leave the table because you don't want to run into one of the knife-wielding servers or the huge hunks of meat they're carrying.  I don't usually review restrooms, but I have to say these were dirty.  Also, the stalls are so small that when you open the door of the stall to walk out, you have to move over to the side because the door nearly touches the toilet when you open it.  It's that small of a space! Overall, the place is good.  Expensive, but an OK price if you can binge like me and really get your money's worth.  This definitely is not a place I could eat at too often though.  Not because it's fancy or because of the price, but because there's not too much good stuff besides all of the meat.  You get very small sides of mashed potatoes, polenta and plaintains, plus as much cheese bread as you want, but I didn't find too much variety.",0.9848,0.827,0.123,0.049,0.5344372294372294

At places like Texas de Brazil, a simple request to a waiter and she would get well done steaks for the remainder of the night.

2013-04-15,2.0,"I was just there yesterday April 14, 2013 with my boyfriend, celebrating our anniversary dinner. I was so excited to go and I had been bragging about this place for months until we finally went. As we walked in, we noticed the restaurant was elegant and clean. A nice place to be. They served us basket of bread with cheese in it that you can barely taste. So we then headed towards the salad bar and I started to look for the soup which they didn't have any, unlike Texas De Brazil. Then we made our way to the salad bar and started to add to our plates. The salad bar was pretty good. The potatoe salad and chicken salad were good but you can get that just about anywhere. It wasn't that special to be honest. They had regular caesar salad and garden salad with only about 6 dressings to choose from. They also had some pasta salad which was also good but not the best. They had salami and a variety of cheeses that also did not have much taste. All these things I could honestly find at jewel that have a better taste but the salad bar is not what got me worked up, it was the meat they were serving. After flipping our car over from red to green, we had different waiters coming over to serve us meat. The first one was filet mingon and I asked for a medium well piece, however it tasted so dry. The I recieved a piece of lamb and also I asked for medium well and this piece was burned and had fat on it. When I asked the waiter for a different piece he made some remark about if the meat is burned you won't gain much weight or something of the like which was rather rude. Then i noticed that after an hour of being there, nobody came to serve us ribs or sausage and probably a few other meat as well. I had to ask the gentleman walking by. After he sent over these types of meats, they mentioned that both were made out of pork which is not my favorite but I still tried them. That was honestly my first mistake was trying them. The meat was white colored and I have never seen ribs colored white, I was very disgusted and the majority of the meat they were serving were all over salted I couldn't even taste the flavor. When I asked the waiter to please take my plate away, he looked at me with an attitude look and asked what was wrong with it as if I was not paying for my plate. It should have been free tasting the way it did. I've had better experiences at regular $7 buffets than this over costly restaurant that has nothing to brag about. The majority of the waiters would flash a smile and the minute they turned, they would have an annoyed look. The waiter even charged us for a bottle of sprite which we never even ordered. All we had was water. I honestly enjoyed Texas De Brazil a million times more. If you want really good Brazilian food, please don't waste your time or money on this place. It was a waste of everything. In the end, it even hurt my stomache that I felt the need to throw up.

These places are fun, but to be honest, I think at this point I would rather spend this money on a good steak at a place like III Forks or Chicago Cut rather than spend it on the meat sweats here. Not that there's anything really wrong with Fogo - what we had was good, and if you want to be picky, you can just pick from the two or three meats you know will be good. However, it can be difficult to get the meats you want - I feel like the premium items don't circulate as well. But their top sirloin and sirloin are tasty - and the best part of these places is that you're getting thin slices with really a really high ""meat to grill crust"" ratio - since that outside with the marinade and grill flavor can be the best part of the steak, this is a-OK with me. Would I tell someone to come here? Maybe, if they've never been before. If I had to recommend a specific churrascaria, would I recommend this one? Frankly, I don't know if I can tell the difference between this Fogo and the Tejas de Brasil I've eaten at elsewhere.

Their mojitos are very delicious and their creme brulee is superb.  Almost as good as mine.,0.9824,0.709,0.246,0.045,0.4649801587301587
2013-03-26,2.0,"Ugh.  Meat sweats. As far as I could tell, this place is the same as Texas de Brazil, only with a higher markup.  A bunch of guys come around with meat on skewers and slice off the piece you want, there's a variety of stuff at the salad bar, and at our table, we had fresh popovers that were awesome, dried out polenta sticks, and fried bananas that were a craps shoot in flavor.  Some were deliciously sweet and others tasted like really unripe bananas that had the sticky bitter starch in them.  Know what I mean?  The meat itself was also inconsistent; some of it was delicious and well seasoned, where others were either over or under seasoned.  I was perplexed. We went here for a birthday celebration, so the $51/person price tag seemed like it might OK for the occasion.  However, when you tag on strong $12 cocktails, $3 coffee, tax, plus the mandatory 18% gratuity for our party of 12, it really adds up!  Frankly, it wasn't worth it, unless you like practically rolling out of a restaurant after having gorged yourself on meat and popovers just to feel like you got your moneys worth.   If you really want to do this, go to Texas de Brazil for lunch at less than half the price.",0.9766,0.773,0.17,0.056,0.48822463768115926

Their salad bar, is, as almost everyone has said, amazing. Crisp asparagus, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella and tomatoes, and their basil dressing is to die for paired with the last two mentions.  On to the food: the only thing I could possibly conceive of complaining about with regard to the food was the chicken, which was a bit on the dry side. Aside from that, I think the lamb chops were the best I'd ever tasted, and everything else was flavorful and delicious. I normally don't leave a restaurant stuffed, but when I do, I'm probably leaving Fogo de Chao! Their cheese rolls are not only melt-in-your-mouth delicious, but also gluten-free, and their polenta and mashed potatoes served tableside are amazing as well. The first time I went for a party, we were not offered the choice of tap vs bottled water, and ended up with an unanticipated $40 charge for the water we'd consumed and unknowingly racked up charges for.

The only complaint i had about the salad bar was that nothing was labeled, most of it was common sense, but there were a few things I had no idea what they were or if they had meat in them so that would have been helpful. But everything was well stocked all the time so huzzah for that.  The sides were delicious! Those fried bananas were surprisingly tasty, and there were these little eggy stick things that were pretty addicting, cheese rolls were good. Service was what i expected it to be on a super busy night. Wait staff did their jobs well and they seemed to resupply they meat to the meat eaters regularly. They were super professional and nice. The only problem i had was in the end I had to leave early and it took forever for my bill to come, but in the end it turned out they were backed up with all the other bills before us, but that doesn't mean i won't go back. I feel for the price you pay more stuff should be included. at least a couple drinks and desserts to choose from.

Pretty standard for for a churrascaria, the red and green coasters to let servers know when you wanted food, use the tongs to grab slices of meat.. etc. I do like that they use coasters to denote when to start and stop food service because it is based on individual diners needs. I've been to other places where it's just one sign for the entire table.  Now the meat. Wholly molly, the meat was scrumptious! Everything was perfectly cooked! That great medium rare that we all dream of... I was a fan more of the beef dishes, not so much for the chicken, sausage, or pork loin. The Filet Mignion, picanha, and rib eye were to die for.

Atmosphere is somewhat crowded and somewhat loud - not exactly a good choice for a romantic night out with your long lost lover.

Service was fine.  Our first server explained they worked as a team and she was very nice.  The people cutting the meat mumbled what they were offering so much that I had to ask them to repeat themselves numerous times.

The decor might be misleading, but then again what large popular restaurant isn't loud? Be prepared for that. The management is great. The servers are courteous and attentive.

The fried polenta, cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and bananas were also delicious.. but not out of the ordinary from other places.  The service.... I do not know if it was just the day or what.. it was horrible. We asked for a cup of water and didn't get it until we had to ask 3 times. They messed up our bill twice. We really didn't know who our server was. Gauchos were skipping our table (and we all had our green cards up). We requested meats and they forgot and didn't come until we had requested it 2 or 3 times. Maybe February 17 is just a bad day for them? We were done with our meal 45 minutes after we left and it took THAT LONG for someone to come to us. Again, who the heck was our server? We had 2 different people asking us what we wanted and taking orders.  I'll stick with the suburban Brazilian Steakhouses...

2013-02-13,2.0,"Hover over the second star on Yelp and it says, ""Meh. I've experienced better.""  And that's the reason for the mere two stars of Fogo de Chão. Let me be clear.  Texas de Brazil is the best Brazilian steakhouse I've experienced in Chicago.  Brazzaz places second.  And Fogo de Chão is a distant third.  Let me break down the reasons. 1) Salad bar.  Texas de Brazil puts Fogo de Chão to shame.  Straight shame.  At TdB, your options include rice, lobster bisque or potatoes au gratin.  It's roughly double the size of the FdC salad bar.  I'm not a huge salad guy, but TdB has far more, far tastier options.  Hell, even sushi if you're in the mood. 2) Meats.  The very first item I ate at Fogo was a sausage.  It tasted off.  Possibly freezer-burned.  Bad, bad way to start a meal.  As I further chewed my way through the animal kingdom, I noticed that Fogo's meats tasted quite bland.  Unless it had garlic or parmesean, it all tasted roughly the same.  Texas far surpasses Fogo in this arena.  Even the bacon on the bacon-wrapped elements seemed undercooked. 3) Ambiance.  Fogo has low lighting, but Texas looks like you're on the inside of a whale's ribcage, prepared to eat your way out.  TdB also has the wine fairy, who spins and twists as she gathers spirits from the giant wall o' wine.  Texas also features a ton of flowers and attention to design detail that trumps Fogo. 4) Service.  Fogo did quite well here, but it bordered on excessive and stalky.  As my table was having a post-dinner conversation, we all noticed the waiter circling our table with the check in hand.  It was off-putting.  Very friendly, but overly so. And here's another factor: Price.  If I'm paying $50 for a meal (without drinks), I expect it to knock me out.  If Fogo charged $30-$35 for this experience, it might rate higher.  But considering you're paying top dollar, you deserve more. You deserve Texas de Brazil.  Don't settle for a pale imitation. (As of this visit, Fogo de Chão is the 3rd best Yelp-reviewed restaurant in Chicago.  That's laughable.)",0.5644,0.849,0.083,0.068,0.5125584795321638

After we took a visit at the salad bar (OH THE CHOICES!) I found myself back at my seat and ready to flip my coin over to ""green"".........I had to pace myself. As soon as one gentleman came over with one delicious cut of meat another would follow shortly.  I would say about 6 men came over in under 2 minutes. My plate was so full I had to flip to ""red"". That was fine, I had my way with my meat and the servers went right past me.  The side dishes that came were amazing! Don't get me started on the sweet caramelized plantains. Oh so good (we had two dishes worth). Cheesy mashed potatoes and fried polenta? Yes please! I had the Guaraná drink which I was told was a mixture between ginger ale and apricot. SO GOOD! My girlfriend had their signature drink with Guava, lime, and strawberries. The manager came over and wouldn't allow the server to take her empty glass. He stated that the berries in her glass stole all the alcohol and immediately went on a mission to get her a spoon.  My girlfriend is a bit shy and was afraid to mention it was my birthday so when the server asked if we wanted desert she threw it in there that it indeed was my birthday and I should splurge. They caught on and comp'd my dessert. I even got a pretty message written on my plate with raspberry puree and a candle. What a wonderful night. We're already thinking of when to come back.  BTW, like everyone else says, those cheesy pastry puffs are amazing!!!! I couldn't sotp popping them!",0.9971,0.779,0.186,0.035,0.5816876750700279

I don't know if Saturday is the low point for meats, but the offerings that arrived were either overcooked or undercooked. Medium could be tough as a shoe or bleeding like it was never cooked. I wont say they were all bad, but at least 10 of the 13 or so things we tasted were average or below. The salad bar was not very impressive either. You compare that to a Texas De Brazil and this rates about as high as a Wendy's. On the good side, service was phenomenal. Service was on you from the second you sat down, but not in an overbearing way. Water was down to half glass? It was filled up, Cheese bread down to one? New basket arrives. Fresh plates, more sides. Not trying to engage each time and get in the way, just getting it done, quietly and effeciently.

If you don't like/eat meat, head over to the salad bar which is arguably just as great as the grilled meat selection. Quick description of the Brazilian steakhouse experience: You have a coaster at your table; one side is red, other side is green. When the coaster is green, the servers will come to you and offer whatever's on their long spear/skewer of meat (you can also choose the doneness of the meat). Flip the coaster over to the red side when your plate is full or you need to take a break from the meat madness. I usually try a little bit of everything, but I get second and third helpings of lamb and bacon wrapped filet mignon. My Filipino family can't eat meat without a side of rice, so it's a good thing Fogo de Chao has got us covered. Their cheesy bread puffs and fried bananas are not to be missed, either.

Also, they did not have chicken hearts as a selection which is very typical for a Brazilian steakhouse. Rice and beans, which usually accompanies the meal, was only brought out to me once the server discovered I was Brazilian.

2012-12-25,4.0,"It was just like you OD'd on meat. Out of the 14 cuts that were offered at lunch, I'd say 8 were great. Some of the meats that were memorable (for good or bad reasons): - Pork encrusted with parmesan was a little bit dry but it was flavorful. - Picanha (top sirloin) was the perfect amount of fat with lean meat but they always gave us the outer slice that was just lean and slightly burned.  - Filet mignon and rib eye were disappointing.  - Costela (beef ribs) was like stewed beef that lost its flavor and texture. - Pork ribs were divine - perfectly roasted, tender and juicy  - it was like Brazilian meets Cantonese (char siu). Salad bar was awesome. Thanks to fellow yelpers and my previous experience at a similar restaurant, we did not have our recommended three servings of leaves here, that's for sure. I quite enjoyed the smoked salmon. My weird friend and boyfriend LOVED the caramelized banana side dish. They had a theory that the sourness of the banana helped increase appetite. So whenever the card was flipped to the red (no meat, please) side, they were munching on these bananas. We had 4 dishes I believe and that's 8 bananas in total. I on the other hand, kept eating the fried polenta even though till this point I have not looked up what was it that I ate. It was fried so I did not care. I am pretty sure we were the table that had the most side dishes... Service - How should I comment on service when I feel empathetic of the unique nature of the restaurant business they are in. Numerous meat specialists circle around the restaurant to a point that it was distracting. We specifically requested Picanha since they were not coming to our table or when it did come we were chewing other meats. Picanha came after prolly a good 20 minutes. I am sure they number the tables so it's not like they couldn't find us... There were other waiters that pretty frequently offered a clean plate so that was nice. No pressure to finish eating the meat that has been pushed to the edge of the plate and both you and the waiter know that it is not going into your stomach. Overall, the service provided was pretty awesome considering that it was a pretty busy Christmas Eve.  Because of the service, I did say a lot of ""thank you"" during that 1.5 hour meal.

The lighting was dimmed and soft music was played. It was a place for a nice relaxing dinner to go to with my family, from the suburbs ,to visit me here downtown. The restaurant itself is supposed to offer a variety of meats and an uncommonly large salad bar, where everything tastes so delicious and juicy! When first getting there the hostess quickly seated us which I thought was amazing for such a well known restaurant in the city of Chicago. After being seated and rapidly greeted by our waiter Marco, I felt a sense of comfortability immediately. Having him check on us, close to every 8 minutes, I thought was top notch service for such a high end restaurant with so many people sitting down beside us. Definitely the kind of service I would want going to a nice restaurant. When first arriving to the salad bar, the first thing I couldn't help but notice was the presentation of the large table itself and the beautiful extravagant colors. The large variety of meat, cheese, olives, and pasta drove me wild and hungry as ever! The aroma that came from the table was a mixture of deliciousness and made my mouth water from the salt and sweet flavors. After the salad bar was over multiple waiters walked around with different cuts and varieties of meats and chicken. Whether it was the parmesan crusted chicken or the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and lightly seasoned, the flavors all were absolutely outstanding and I have yet to not crave it when thinking of food.

Just too much food and some friends mentioned some of the meat is a little too salty for our taste but I love their salad bar and how fresh everything is! I have been maybe 3 times and don't really plan on going back. I want to try Brazzaz and I have noticed their ads all over the city so maybe that will be my next stop and possibly a favorite for many years to come :) stay tuned!,0.9791,0.731,0.245,0.024,0.4230769230769231
2012-10-08,5.0,"I think the first thing that I should mention is that I'm not a huge meat eater...I mean I love bacon, but who doesn't? I went to Fogo de Chao with a couple of my coworkers one day after work.  Now this involved us taking the metra in from Glenview and then walking about a mile and a half to the restaurant, but it was well worth it (and the walk back to Union Station was nice after the feast we had). First off, let me talk about the food: 1. We got there early, so there wasn't a line at the salad bar.  There was a pretty good variety up there, but having read reviews on yelp first, I tried not to get too much so I wouldn't fill up on the salad bar. 2. The sides were good - the crisply polenta was good and the mashed potatoes were delicious.  The fried bananas depend on your preference for texture.  Since they're bananas they don't get as crispy as a plantain would get, and they're definitely more mushy.  But if you don't mind that texture, they were good.  And the bread/rolls that they have are delicious. 3. The meat.  Now as I said, I'm not a huge meat eater, but there are so many varieties that unless you're a vegetarian, there will definitely be something there that you'll like.  Granted, if you only like chicken, I probably wouldn't recommend going there (dinner is $50), but if you don't limit yourself to white meat there are quite a few options.   And now to what I feel really made the entire experience at Fogo de Chao.  The service.  When we got to our table, our chairs were immediately pulled out for us.  Our water glasses were never empty and our sides and bread were replaced constantly throughout the night.  We never once asked for more water, bread, or sides, but the servers were constantly refilling and replacing them for us.  The servers also came to know our preferences for how we liked our meat cooked - the two I were with like rare/medium rare and I like medium well/well.  Once we had told a few servers that, it was as if all or most of them knew. The two things that you should remember when you go - and you should go! - are to go when you're hungry so you get your money's worth and that when you have your chip on green, be prepared for lots of attention from the servers and lots of different options!",0.9969,0.822,0.163,0.014,0.5125000000000001

2012-09-27,5.0,"Love it. See my review of the Houston location for a brief account of my many year history with Fogo de Chao. I've been to Washington D.C. three times over the past two or three years, and on each occasion have not been able to visit their branch of Fogo (making the trip with a vegetarian on one of those occasions was my own, silly, fault as far as dining plans were concerned!).  Imagine my surprise when I drove up to a random Portillo's (recommended by a neighbour) and I drove right past Fogo! FOGO!  Imagine my surprise again when I discovered it's just a few blocks up from the hotel I was staying at! So -- what do you have to expect at this place? A fantastic salad bar (which, actually, has it's share of meat too - I passed on the bacon, but had some excellent smoked salmon and prosciutto), a more than reasonably drink menu, and the meat. THE MEAT. The meat just circles - I tried some of almost everything, but had noticed two of the dishes hadn't circled yet.  At first, I didn't know if they were on the lunch menu -- until now I've only ever been at dinner and remembered seeing on the menu that some of the meats were only served at dinner -- but the manager came by and asked how the meal was, and was there anything that I had wanted which I'd not seen yet?  A few minutes later, those two meats came directly to my table. The sides, also, are excellent.  The plantains are excellent and - for me - a perfectly acceptable substitute to dessert.  Polenta and potatoes both came naked by special request as usually they come with cheese on top, and both were excellent. It's really an odd niche that this, and places like it, have carved.  They've steered very well away from the ""all you can eat"" gut-buster, but at the same time you come for food - for good food - and you come with an appetite. Whenever I visit, I visit with an appetite.",0.994,0.831,0.151,0.018,0.5571088435374151

My only beef (ha ha) with this place is the meat is so salty!  Well that and I always eat so much that I feel miserable.  But of course I blame myself for that one.,0.3667,0.792,0.106,0.102,0.4897907647907648

When I looked around the restaurant it was beautiful, it was clean it was big yet inviting! I loved the salad bar as well and the endless sides including: pão de queijo (warm cheese bread), crispy hot polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas. Fogo® also offers optional side dishes of rice and black beans, and farofa upon request. All of this was so good that I couldn't believe I picked up my fork to eat all that I did but I had no guilt as I did my happy dance each time I tried something new and different; just an extra 30 mins a day of working out and it was so worth it in my opinion. The waiter was very nice and so was the manager who stopped by our table and spoke to us for awhile and I have to say he was funny and made my cousin and I feel like we were friends stopping by his house for a dinner party.   I know that in today economy some people may not be able to make it here but I say if you can save and if you can come out for lunch because the prices are a little less for lunch then this is a place that you should treat yourself to at least once...and trust after you come here once you will want to come back...I know I do!!!

They are 13 and 7 years old. I wanted them to try something unique...and unique it was!   Service was the best you could want for the price that you pay. We were seated immediately and the waiter was at our table within 30 seconds of us being seated. He explained the process of how service works and pointed us in the direction of the salad bar.  The salad bar is all you can eat, it didn't have a great assortment. I think it was just to have something to eat besides just meat. I had the fresh mozzarella, red and yellow peppers, some type of greenish colored mint salad, artichoke hearts and salmon. Upon returning to our table the waiter raced over and pulled my chair out for me to have a seat. (WOW!)  We ate some of our salad plate then flipped our cards for the MEAT!! Amazing how they keep rotating around with different meats! Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin, Garlic Beef, Some type of Chicken bacon wrap thingy, sausages, pork ribs, beef ribs, and it's non stop!!!! But on the other hand we did forget to flip our card to make it stop! The wine selection was awesome and before you know it the waiter returns when your glass is almost empty to ask if you would like more...I LOVE HIM!!! The sides that they bring to the table were great! I loved the cheese potatoes! My youngest daughter killed the fried bananas (2 plates of them to be exact). The polenta was just ehh.  All in all...we had a wonderful time. Had some bonding and just a good laugh at how my youngest kept sneaking and flipping our cards to green. She is so playful and loved the game until we flipped her card to green. I would definitely be bcak here soon. Meat was flavorful and cooked to perfection.",0.993,0.792,0.161,0.047,0.55546875

When I got up to grab a plate to get some stuff from the salad bar, the manager RAN to get the plate so he could hand it to me.  If you want to feel like the most special person on earth, come to Fogo.  This year I went to celebrate my anniversary, and I think I made the best choice by coming here.  The food was great, I think traveling meat is always a great show, even if you aren't much of a meat eater. I'm not a fan of beef, so it all kind of tasted the same to me, but my boyfriend loved it and couldn't get enough of it. I LOVED the lamb though, I had all three versions of it, and all were fantastic. The fried bananas are also heavenly.  I can't write enough good things about the service though. When the waitress asked if we were waiting for anything, I would name a meat, and not even 10 seconds later I would have it at the table.  Also, our side dishes were never empty. Once when we were down to two cheese breads in our basket (which by the way are spectacular), one of the waiters takes the basket and RAN to the kitchen, and 5 seconds later RUNS back to our table to give us another basket of warm, tasty, cheese bread. AWESOME.  Also, I never mentioned it was our anniversary to anyone who worked there, I just didn't think it was important. During the end of our delicious, gluttonous dinner, I handed my boyfriend a scrapbook and we were laughing and crying over memories of the past year. I never saw the waitress during this time, and after we were done looking at it, she came to our table with a piece of cake that said ""Congratulations"" on the plate....  She then said, ""I'm not sure if you are celebrating anything, but I saw the photo album so I thought you were"". I thought that was the most amazing thing any waiter has ever done.

The salad bar is varied and upscale with prosciutto, shaved parmigiano reggiano, fresh mozzarella, asparagus, haricots vert, prepared salads and all sorts of roasted and raw vegetables.  The popovers served tableside are cheesy and airy, but every once in a while you get one a trifle underdone.  No biggie.  The other accompaniments - polemta sticks, whipped potatoes and carnelized bananas - are good but a bit pedestrian. The meats are the stars and some of them really do shine.  I'm a big fan of the cognac marinated chicken thighs ( juicy with crispy skin), all of the lamb chop dishes, the bacon wrapped filet, the pork ribs and the sausages.  I skip the chicken breast and lesser beef dishes because I'm just not a fan of sirloins and round cuts - they're nicely spiced but not prime.

2012-05-04,5.0,"DATE/SEATING TIME: I went with a group of 4 on Friday, April 27th.  I called around 11:30am and made reservations for that evening at 10pm.  When we arrived at 10pm, there were 10 to 15 people waiting, so I thought we may have to wait a bit for our seats.  However, they sat us immediately.  I guess that means if you are going on a weekend, it pays to have reservations! FOOD:  I enjoyed everything I ate, and eat I did.  The meal is broken into 2 parts.  1st the salad bar, 2nd the meat & sides.  The salad bar is impressive.  They have all the salad toppings of which I could think.  They have ready made salads (chicken salad, potato salad, pasta salad, etc.).  There were some nice plates of prosciutto, ham, and smoked salmon.  Also, my wife's favorite, a giant wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. There were 4 sides served.  A fried banana - really delicious, polenta - good, but not a highlight, garlic mashed potatoes - again, solid, and cheese bread - great texture and delicious. I believe they serve 12 meats.  I tried 10 or 11 of them.  They were all very good, some were amazing.  My favorites were the filet and the Picanha (Top Sirloin) which is their house specialty.  I asked for each meat as rare as they had (which turned out to be medium rare for most meats).  Near the end of meal, all of the meats started to sort of taste the same.  I could tell the lamb had a much different flavor than the filet, but I was so full it just sort of combined into a happy meat coma. SERVICE:  The service was perfect.  Their were many servers, gauchos, managers, etc. on the floor at all times.  When we flipped out circles green (meaning ""We're ready for meat!"") it took all of 15 seconds to have a gaucho offering us something wonderful looking.  They kept the side dishes full.  We ordered a bottle of wine and they were sure that our glasses never became too empty.  When my wife asked for a few meats at a ""medium well"" preparation, they gladly cooked some and brought it over within 5 minutes.  I really can't give them an higher rating for their service. ATMOSPHERE: It's a large restaurant.  It's generally a little more dressy than casual, but there were quite a few people wearing jeans.  It was loud enough to feel comfortable talking at the table, but not too loud that we couldn't hear each other.  It was a great balance to do some catching up. PRICE: It's around $50 a person.  For 4 with a bottle of wine, 2 after dinner coffees, a desert, tax, and tip, we came in around $375.  It was well worth the price.   I highly recommend Fogo de Chao.  I'll definitely be coming back.  Though, I may not be hungry again for a month.",0.9982,0.806,0.185,0.009,0.6047060552616109

2012-04-27,3.0,"I went tonight for the first time in many years.  I remember when I first came here ten years ago, I was bowled over by all the great cuts of meat and a salad bar that was second to none.  I still enjoy the cuts of meat, don't get me wrong.  And the service is excellent, just as I remembered from before.  I think this meat is the best of any of the Brazilian emporiums, and their salad bar is still that good also. I have a few issues with this place now, though.  If you like wine as much as I do, this is not the place for you.  I'm serious.  The wine list is an abomination.  Why?  When they charge upwards of $50 for pedestrian offerings that I can find at Costco for $12, that's a joke.  When a pour of a 2007 vintage port runs north of $30, that's a joke, also.  Do they even decant these bottles and remove the sediment ahead of time, I wonder?  (I think some of the Northern Rhones, the very few offered, anyway, weren't quite as harsh on the markup ratio, but at $50 for my food already, and without a corporate expense account, it wasn't in the cards tonight.)  Not only that, you'd think that they would bother to carry some Portuguese table reds, and maybe even one or two tannats from Uruguay.  Just a big majority of pedestrian grossly marked up offerings, that's how I viewed this wine list.  And no madeira, either.  It's a shame, because someone could put some real thought and consideration into crafting a wine list for a Brazilian meat emporium, but this place chooses not to do so. As it was, I had a caipirinha which set me back $12, but at least there was some novelty to that experience.  Better that than a pedestrian glass of wine for $12, anyway.  And not only that, they want you to pay $30-35 corkage fee (I forget the exact amount) if you want to bring your own bottle in.  Either way, they get their big markup, I guess.  I guess if it was on my expense account, who cares, but I just can't get past the price gouging this place feels it must engage in.  The real reason they do this is because they can.  When it's all about expense accounts, this is what happens.  If you don't have a corporate Amex, think twice.  I think if I come back, I will be drinking iced tea, anyway.",0.8262,0.869,0.077,0.054,0.4004166666666667

It was a watery, nasty, tasteless mashed potato.  EW.  So the server says, ""I will get you something fresh.""  Ok I said.   Take two on the mashed potatoes.  Slightly less watery...but honestly?  I'd like to see them make it cuz it still tasted like it was out of a box!  How hard is it to make buttery light mashed potatoes?  Not so hard until I found a place that couldnt do it.   Aside from the mashed potatoes, the rest of the meal was good.  OH-I can do without the mushy over cooked ""bananas"" too.  WAY overcooked plantains in my opinion.   But hey, I'm no food critic.  Just know how I like to eat.   As someone also mentioned, this is way superior to Texas de Brazil.  I would go back on some given day I want to eat nothing but meat.  But if you're not that hungry, and not in the mood for meat, you might want to try something else.  For $50 a person, you can make palate budget stretch much further somewhere else.",0.9363,0.867,0.092,0.041,0.6326666666666667

2012-03-08,4.0,"Fogo de Chao First Time Diner Guide: Parking: Their valet parking is $12 and there's a parking lot just across the street of the restaurant for $11, but we found street parking was the answer. On a Tuesday evening my wife and found a spot right away on Erie St. right next to Fogo and paid $7.50 for two hours. Dress code: Though the interior of the restaurant is classy, clean, and comfortable, the variety of persons eating is well mixed. People were on dates wearing suits and dresses, families were out for a nice meal in jeans and sweaters, and thuggy looking guys rolled in with backward caps and baggy pants. All were welcome. Food: The meal comes in two parts. First is the salad bar portion full of cold salads, breads, and cheeses. The second is the meat portion which comes with warm sides of polenta, rolls, mashed potatoes, and plantains. All are all you can eat. The salad bar is on the higher end with its various offerings. Greens, veggies, cheeses, and a few deli sliced meats are all accounted for. My advice is not to fill up too much on the first trip. It will be there for you later and filling up on potato salad and heavy cheeses may make your stomach wary of the meat cornucopia that awaits you. But don't forget the veggies. It became a nice break for me to grab another plate of fresh greens later when the carbs and meat were in full force. It was odd though that nothing in the salad bar was labled nor was there an employee to help me figure out what items were what.  The abundance of meat is obviously the reason to come here. Various cuts cooked to your liking with no end in sight. The highlights were the filet, the bacon wrapped filet, and the chicken. I did notice throughout the evening though that not all the meats tasted like they were seasoned. And actually, besides the three meats I already mentioned, I wasn't really wowed by many of the meat varieties and could have used some steak sauce. But quanity beats out quality and it was still fun to eat my fill of protein not mattering if I've had better elsewhere. The sides were fine with the cheese rolls and sweet warm plantains as the stand outs.  Service: All the employees are helpful, happy, and attentive and almost overwhelmingly so. Once you flip over that coin to green you will be bombarded by smiling workers offering you meats. One after another and they won't stop until they see red. Even though we were seated by one server he really wasn't ""our"" server and found that the whole floor is covered by several workers. Many times we were checked up on and it was a different person almost every time. The water glass is never empty and the side dishes are refilled without any asking. My wife mentioned to one employee she was a vegetarian and wouldn't be needing a plate for meat and a couple minutes later a different employee approached her offering grilled vegtables. Even when we recieved the bill and noticed a wrong charge on it we were given a delicious complimentary dessert because of the minor error. Really well done and the service is a main reason this visit was so enjoyable.  Price: $25 a person for salad bar only. $50 a person for salad and meat. $2.99 for a coca-cola.

I found the service at Fogo to be much more thoughtful and less obtrusive than at Texas de Brazil.

Texas de Brazil was much more hit-or-miss in its service, from what I observed. True, you'll see no ""wine angels"" performing trapeze acts during dinner like at Texas de Brazil, but like I said, there is enough of a show at Fogo just watching the gauchos parade throughout the dining room.

The service is impeccable and the food is mouth watering. This is by far my favorite restaurant! Dinner is around $50 a person and lunch is about $35 for all you can eat including the salad bar. My boyfriend and I usually go for lunch and they have the same items then as they do for dinner. Their meats are nicely seasoned, juicy and perfectly done. My favorite is the pichana, first cut and done medium. Usually once you start getting picky about which meats you want to finish up on after you've had your fill of everything else, the manager and/or servers notice right away and ask you which meats you want served to you. Once you tell them, they bring them to you as soon as possible. If it's your birthday and you tell them, they'll do a little something special too ;) I love this place.

I've been to countless places that attempt to replicate what Fogo De Chao's pulling off, many have come close. However, I always leave knowing deep down where my favorite is.  They have an unbelievable salad bar. That's what sets them apart. Most have good quality meat, good cooks who prepare the meat nicely, and a solid selection with good service. I have found the salad bars to always be lacking. Fogo has a beautiful selection of antipasti style vegetables, a surprisingly impressive selection of above average meats and cheeses, and even some items that may surprise you (not bad sushi *for a Brazzeri).  Do this ONE  favor to yourself. After going to the salad bar, immediately flip the meat request tool over. For some reason I see a lot of people eat the salad, then order meat. I don't understand why. The meal is designed to be eaten harmoniously.  Fogo de Chao is a magnificent restaurant that you've likely passed countless times and always been curious about,. It's a little pricey, but they have to cover their end since it's all you can eat. When your craving a fun, lively, meat fest, go to Fogo.",0.9788,0.815,0.17,0.015,0.6262222222222221

2012-01-16,5.0,"This place is worth every bit of the 5 stars, it really is as good as it gets. I absolutely love Fogo!  It's worth every penny! First, the salad bar in itself is enough to keep me coming here.  Its incredibly fresh, always being added to, great variety of cheeses, cured meats, and super fresh veggies and salads.  I have to hold myself back from eatting the whole salad bar, as I wouldn't have room left for the juicy meat. Now onto the meat... incredibly juicy, succulent, grilled goodness!  The waiters (in their super cool Brazilian outfits) are quite attentive and as soon as they see your card flipped to the green side, they run right over to offer you a new meat.  The only pet peeve with this system is that sometimes you may not get the meat temp you desire.  Personally, I like medium-well, and most cuts end up being rare-medium.  To get a piece of well done, you'd have to wait till a new seared piece comes out of the kitchen.  The waiters are so attentive that they'll remember which table requested a certain type of meat or ""temp"" and deliver shortly.  Also, the extra's on the table, mashed potatoes, palenta and cheese buns are replenished often, but as I consider those fillers, I usually skip them and stuff my fancy face with the bountiful meats!   My ultimate fav is filet mignon wrapped in bacon.  I drool as I think about this. Don't be a sissy, try all the meats!  Some people only want a certain type, thinking the others are ""cheap"" meats.  Each is uniquely flavored and spiced, taste it all! Fogo - how about the possibility of leaving my salad plate on the table WHILE I eat the meats?  Usually the waiters quickly give you new plates, but I actually like eatting salad & meat at the same time. Last time we went, it was a group of 4, its a bit hard to keep a discussion going, sometimes it gets loud in here.  Not so much people talking loud, seems like the sound resonates from the walls/ceiling.

2012-01-11,5.0,"5-stars from a FORMER vegetarian. yes i was a vegetarian until i was 21 years old. a vegetarian that didnt eat potatoes either. not because my parents forbade it - quite the opposite being from a family of 2nd generation italian-irish aka meat worshippers. and not because of my fond love for animals - you'd prolly consider me crazy after i readily admit i was just as abhorred that humans killed plants and dreamed as a kid to one day create food that didn't squash life from anything. but it took 21 years for my palette to mature, say. my oldest memory of meat was way before i even hit an age of double digits. and then i moved to Chicago, a city made up of meat. you can get bacon on top of anything, even cupcakes. where dinner china is made up of animal bones. many citizens are as burly as buffalo. the sports teams, aside from one baseball team i am not even a fan of, have animal mascots - or animal hunter mascots. well anyways there's alot of principle detail involved with my switch but let me at least tell you that after coming to fogo de chao near the end of my switch year i had a life epiphany. that meat is like ambrosia and the fields of spinach i have eaten all the years prior is meant for the animals... or as an appetizer or salad or garnish even. i learned you can make an entire meal of just a slab, or few, of meat. and here they bring it to you hot on a skewer in chunky bite size masses, sometimes wrapped in bacon, at the mere sight of a green calling card. now there is an art as to how to eat here. i came here for the first time and the veggie-lover in me made rounds at the salad bar and filled up mainly on salad and the unlimited side plates circulating (salad bar is amazing my vegetarian friends) - but when i finally dismissed my meat shyness and sampled the meat i felt like i was wasting all that time, and all those years of my life eating like a cow, instead of a cow. i have since gone over half a decade making up for the meatless years and have frequented fogo de chao at minimum once a changing season. seasoned i am now, and i can personally vouch you must come here after a morning/afternoon fast. eat a normal meal the night before and save the room in your tummy for dinner, and then eat LIGHT, VERY LIGHT and late breakfast - that is if you arent made as burly as a buffalo. otherwise you will need to retire the rest of the night in stretchy pajamas watching a tv-show marathon as you veg out on your couch. fogo is a special place, both romantic and gregarious so come with your loved one, your family, or a half-dozen of your friends... but also come with your piggy bank for dinner: $50 for all you can eat meat and salad bar, $25 salad bar only. kids free under 5 years old. kids 6-10 half price. fair i say for superior food and service. and if you have the spare change they have the best seasonal pumpkin spice martini EVER as well as they have brilliantly paired many meals with great wine (one of which was Argentinian Tikal, but i forget which blend).",0.9967,0.834,0.137,0.03,0.475828373015873

2011-12-20,4.0,"I accompanied two handsome, mustached men here for a meat-packed dinner over the weekend.  I stuck to the salad bar, but felt full just watching those two gentlemen go to town on that meat.  End of night = heaping plates of bones.  In more detail:  We made a reservation for 8pm on a Friday night.  It was b'b'b'bustling and loud in there - people everywhere - waiters, guests, meat-peddling carvers donned in their best red bow-ties and black boots.  We were taking an out-of-town visitor here, aimed to impress, and succeeded.  Full meals here run around $50 and include the full salad bar (more on that later) + all you can eat meat (12 or more options - beef, pork, sausage, chicken, lamb) carved table-side.  It's quite a spectacle and you can really make it worth your pretty penny if you can handle mass quantities of meat.   Green means GO - and that same rule applies at Fogo.  Guests use a two-sided paper medallion to signal whether they want meat NOW, or not.  Our table was swarmed with meat carvers in a matter of seconds each time the boys' discs were green-side-up.  Red means you need a minute to eat the meat you already have on your plate.   My dining companions sampled each meat offering, ( except the pork - we never did see that come around once) and gushed over the juicy, succulent cuts.  They loved it.  I tried their chicken legs, and those were also perfectly cooked, juicy and steaming hot.  Delicious.   I opted for only the salad bar (ran about $25) and while this was a big, plentiful bar, it was pretty standard, basic options and I wasn't blown away by it, especially for that price.  Everything was cold, though they did offer to grill veggies from the salad bar, if you want something hot.  It's a salad bar - I wasn't expecting tons of hot dishes, but I thought they might have SOMETHING to choose from: soup, side dish, pasta? something?  Nope.  They had varied greens, basic cut up veggies (tomato, asparagus, mushroom, red potatoes, beets) several cheeses, smoked salmon (good), mayo-based chx salad, potato salad, sliced white bread - more I'm forgetting, but all along those same blandish lines.   Tables are also replenished with side dishes to share: mashed potatoes, fried polenta sticks, plantains + little bread buns.   Service was 'shared' so we had 4 or 5 different waiters coming around to help our table out with refills, check-ins, etc.  Kind of unusual.  I'm not sure if I liked that 'team effort' or not.  Still, service was always attentive and quick.   We really enjoyed our dinner here - the meat-eaters more so than I - but as far as Brazilian steak houses go, I think I preferred the atmosphere and salad bar at Brazzaz; which also wasn't nearly as crowded or loud.  I'd go back to Brazzaz or try another Braz. steak house option before going back to Fogo.",0.994,0.86,0.115,0.024,0.5404040404040404

I'm trying as hard as possible to avoid all the carbs (yummy, yummy carbs) so when it was time to make a decision for my birthday dinner I immediately thought of this place.  I have never been to a Brazilian steak house and figured this would be a good opportunity to try it out. To start the salad bar is incredible.  The waiters tell you ""the trick is to take it easy on the salad bar"" but I went in hard anyway.  If this were a normal salad bar I'd agree with the waiter but this one is full of all kinds of delicious.  I had artichoke hearts, fresh mozzarella, lox, prosciutto,  salami, sun dried tomatoes, parmesan ... it goes on and on.  It was so good I took another trip over at the end of the meal. There is so much meat, too much to talk about all of them.  My favorite was the filet, the bacon wrapped filet and the parmesan crusted pork.  All of it was good and cooked to the temperature of your liking.  Good and super meaty! The service here is unbelievable.  It is really what made the night and the experience so great.  You get these little cards that are red on one side and green on the other.  You get to take your time in the beginning with the salad bar, wine, etc. When you're ready you flip the card to green and that signals the meat parade.  The cards hadn't even landed on the table before our plates and side dishes were dropped and three gauchos were lined up trying to feed us beef.  It continued like that throughout the entire meal.  At one point my boyfriend starting quietly singing ""Happy Birthday"" to me and 5 minutes later a waitress drops a huge slice of cheesecake with a candle and ""Happy Birthday"" written in raspberry syrup. She was not told to do this, she just overheard the little song.  Super cute and awesome. It is pretty expensive.  Don't get me wrong, I love an expensive meal, but I feel like all you can eat places aren't very beneficial to me since I can't really eat that much.  I'd rather eat just one amazing $50 steak I think.  My boyfriend on the other hand probably polished off a quarter of a cow.  This is a great place for men.  There were so many man dates there I had to laugh.  Half of the dining room was couples and the other half were just tables full of men chowing down on meat.  Honestly, take your man, your dad, whoever here and they will love you forever.",0.9993,0.725,0.258,0.017,0.5550925925925926

The only real caution I would offer to people assuming that they know what they're getting into with a big bill in exchange for lots of quality meat is that it's not a particularly ""downtown Chicago"" kind of restaurant.

We didn't have a reservation and we were worried that they didn't have a table.  But it was early on a weekday, so we got right in. My mom loves sparkling water and they had it for her and the brand that she loved as well.  We didn't know what we wanted to drink and the server helped us pick a really good merlot to go with the meats. Also, I was wearing a light cream colored suit and they took a tablecloth to cover my suit jacket that I had hung on the back of my chair, so if anything fell, it would not ruin my suit jacket! So thoughtful! The salad bar was good, nothing too special about it.  I tried not to eat too much, but everything was so fresh and all I wanted to do was eat more!  I am also obsessed with the cheesy bread... I ate like 3 of them and my mom had to take them away from me otherwise I would have eaten the whole basket.  We got to sample a little of everything and it was so good!  It was so flavorful and they made sure we got the cut of meat we wanted with the right temperature!  My dad thought it was a bit bland so he put a bit more salt on it, no biggie.  The manager came over to make sure everything was good.  He even asked us if there was anything that we wanted to try again and he would send the guy over with the cut of meat we wanted.  My dad wanted the lamb chop and my mother and I wanted the garlic one.  Both were sent over right away.  Amazing! And of course, we didn't have room for dessert, but having a sweet tooth, I convinced my mom to share a dessert with me.  It was chocolate heaven.  My father on the other hand, asked for the plantains (the ones that were served with the meal) to be his dessert and they gladly brought him one as well.  Service- amazing, food- amazing, price- not so amazing... but my parents were in town and treating me as a poor student.  I would go again, but most likely for a special date or when my parents come back in town so they will pay.... lol.  Its a bit expensive on a student budget, but worth it.",0.9967,0.779,0.178,0.043,0.6124643874643875

The wine list is extensive and one of our guests actually owns a winery so he was very pleased to see that his Spanish wine was on the list and we also ordered Brazilian caiprinhas for the entire table which even though I did not partake in it, everyone enjoyed it and found it to be a refreshing with that splash of sugarcane.",0.9722,0.877,0.108,0.015,0.5027777777777777

2011-07-20,5.0,"The Strategies and Methodologies for Consuming a Meal at Fogo de Chao. My brother and I make a semiannual trip to Fogo every year, usually for special occasions, and have been doing so for the past 5 years or more. Over that time, I have developed a strategy to maximize the value of my experience and meal.  The first thing to remember when enjoying a meal at Fogo is to skip the salad bar entirely. You don't win friends with salad.  Oh sure, sure, it is an impressive bar, and on my first couple of visits I was taken in by the colorful array of vegetables, and tricked myself into thinking that by consuming a salad with this meal I was somehow being ""healthy"" or ""balanced.""  There is nothing healthy or balanced about a meal at Fogo de Chao. Furthermore, there is nothing sane about it either.  The salad bar is full of a wide variety of delicious and impressive ingredients. Visit it if you must, but remember, every bite of spinach takes up space that could be occupied by Parmesan covered pork.  The bread they offer, on the other hand, is light, bite sized and delicious. And while it has the potential of filling you up on non-meat substances, enjoying one or two will not make too much of an impact on one's gastro-capacity.  Once you flip your card to green, alerting the hospitable staff of silly-trousered servers to begin bombarding you with delicious meats of all species and temperatures, the real fun begins. They will deliver conservative portions of mashed potatoes, fried polenta, and plantains - all of which are wonderful - but as with all non-meat items, have the potential to rob space from the more valuable meat-items.  It is incumbent for every patron of Fogo de Chao to please, for the mother of all things sacred, pace yourself. Never have more than three pieces of meat on your plate at once. Do not be afraid to ask a server for a specific item. As a matter of fact, be sure to request specific items, as they will come to you before anyone else when they exit the kitchen, ensuring that the portion you receive is as fresh and hot as can be. Be sure to enjoy ample portions of the fillet and chicken breast wrapped in bacon, the Parmesan pork, and the garlic covered beef. Of course, just about everything they offer on the menu is amazing, and I couldn't be more enthusiastic as I write this review.  I have never had a bad experience at Fogo de Chao, and never had the slightest reason to complain. Everyone on the staff went above and beyond to ensure that we had a tremendous and gluttonous experience.  Go hungry. Leave full.",0.9961,0.801,0.159,0.039,0.6144962747003564

My friend left his iPhone there when we went to get the car and went back to retrieve to find it wasn't there anymore. The workers had already moved the tables back to the spot and nothing was left on the ground. We talked to the manager and they said nothing has been turned in, but we just had the iPhone a few moments ago and we knew it had to be in the restaurant. I asked to the review the security tapes and they allowed us to. In the meantime they were yelling at us for even thinking about accusing their workers because they enforce a very a good policy. I told him I don't know him so I don't trust him, I can only see for myself. So as we were reviewing the tapes, the arguing got more intense and heated. Finally I came across the clip where ONE OF THEIR WORKERS TOOK THE IPHONE. Unfortunately, the camera did not let us zoom in for us to physically show the iPhone, but it did show the worker bend down TWICE. The manager was furious at US and started going off how he probably bent down to pick up a napkin. Yes the first time he bent down, he picked up a napkin. Then he saw the iPhone lying there and bent down again to pick it up. He picked it up very closely to our chairs and we had no clue he was even behind us. The manager and security kept denying what was physically shown on the tape. We had to file a police report to have this further investigated, but I cannot believe the rudeness the manager and security guard had.

2011-05-31,5.0,"This was the second restaurant that me and several fellow graduating seniors of Proviso East H.S's Class of '06 went to, as the school celebrated our graduation. If you asked me which one of the two restaurants we were taken to that I preferred most-Old Country Buffet or Fogo de Chao, I would have to pick the latter, even though it's a heck of a lot more expensive. Thankfully, the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet at FDC was another all-expenses-paid by the school, so none of us had to dig into our pockets to pay for it. Our day began by going to Navy Pier and walking around the lakefront. A P.E. staff member snapped a couple pictures of us standing on the edge of a dock at Navy Pier next to the water, which was so lovely. I still have that picture btw, a copy of course. Then, we went to Fogo de Chao. Before getting the main dish, we went to the restaurant's salad bar and every one of us stocked our plate with veggies, meats, and cheeses. I especially loved the cheeses, they were oh so irresistible. Now, the main dish, the meat, but before I get to the meat, oh my gosh, those bread rolls they serve here are to die for! Whenever one of the gauchos-the guys dressed in those neat suits-came to our table, I always requested more bread rolls. I didn't need any butter for them because they were so good! The other seniors didn't seem to care too much for them, but forget them! They didn't have great taste! Lol. Okay, now on to the meat. It was great. I loved it! How you are served the meat is just plain ol' cool! There's a button you are given. Turn it on green, and the gauchos come to put meat on your plate. Turn it on red, and they don't show up at all. I liked the picanha, Brazilian top sirloin, the cordeiro (lamb), frango (chicken), and the linguica (some kind of sausage), but NO meat, NO meat I tell you did I love more than the lombo (Parmesan pork loin)! Oh my gosh, it was just as delicious as the bread rolls except that it was cheesier and meaty. And just like the bread rolls, it melted in the mouth! Oh my gosh, I want to go back to FDC just for that meat! I don't know how to make it at home, unfortunately. I can't remember what the other seniors ordered for dessert, but I picked the turtle cheesecake, which was oh so good! Is this place expensive to eat at? Hmmm, I wouldn't say so. Lunch, which is served between 11-2, which is when we came here, is just $32.50 including the salad bar, but if you do only the salad bar, that's going to cost you $22.50. Not bad, not bad at all, especially when you discover how this food is made and where the techniques and training associated with preparing it are adopted from---thousands of miles away.",0.9682,0.812,0.113,0.074,0.5526785714285716

The gauchos come around with all the variety of meats, but I wish they had shrimp or grilled pineapple like they have at Brazzas.  All of the meats are extremely salty so you may run into the problem we had and that was ordering rounds of drinks every time the server came around. Before we knew it, we had racked up a $300 drink bill. Maybe that's why they make everything so salty, so you'll get thirsty and order the recommended drinks without seeing the prices because they are definitely not listed on the menu.

After all of that, we were charged $50 a person.   My over all impression was dissappointing and I would not return to Fogo.  My goto place is and always will be Texas De Brazil.  The meat is flavorful, always seasoned right, the meat is always at your table as requested with out waiting for more than 2-3 minutes.  All of the meats always make it around to me and its $10 less than fogo.  Not to mention the salad bar has far more items available.  They didnt have rice and beans WTF!!  It also does not have that ""hyped-up"" ""stuffy shirt"" feel to it.  The crowd there was un-bearable!

2011-04-24,5.0,"Fogo de Chau does so many things so damn right. The Service -- This place has an amazingly attentive wait staff considering the restaurant is the size of an airplane hangar. All the servers work together, so there is basically an army of servers at your beck and call, all extremely enthusiastic about making sure you're eating and drinking like a king. The Gaucho meat men were very knowledgeable about the meat they were serving, and they all seemed to genuinely enjoy stuffing you full of meaty treats -- almost like they were trying to one-up each other.  Like, ""Yeah I see you looking at that Gaucho with the Bacon-Wrapped Chicken, but have you ever seen a filet of beef thiiiis big!?"" kinda thing. Oh and when you flip that card to green (giving them the OK to start offering you their meaty wares) they would swarm your table like you owned the place. Meat frenzy = awesome. The only part of the service I didn't like were the guys rolling around carts of chilled booze. The classiness factor decreases a little when some dude is offering shots of Jager table-side. The Food -- The meat was all cooked very well, and my god there was there a lot of it. I tried every single meat variation (15 in all), and then when I told one of the servers of my gastronomical accomplishment he had one of the Guachos bring off-menu Beef Ribs out for me in a meat consumption challenge of sorts. They were awesome, and I think right then was where Fogo went from ""good meat place"" to ""great meat place"" for me.  As far as meat rankings, the star of the show was undoubtedly the Bacon Wrapped Filet, which was cooked perfectly. The Beef Ribs were definitely a close second and the Top Sirloin an even closer third. Also I guess there was a salad bar or something.  Just kidding, the salad bar was awesome.

This is not the type of place you want to eat for lunch unless you want to waddle back to the office and you keep a pillow in your office for a long afternoon nap. So maybe the appeal is different in the evenings. Despite my pooh-poohing of the concept, Fogo de Chao does do one thing well, and that, thankfully, is the meat. Bacon-wrapped filet, come to mama! For a girl who is (admittedly) not the hugest carnivore, this place does make me long for the mass hunter ways of my Neanderthal forefathers. Meat on bone. nom nom nom.  Though Fogo does insist they are vegetarian friendly, I would feel horrible for anyone veggie who got roped into coming here: yes, you have free reign to the salad bar, but the salad bar is rather limited.

2011-04-21,2.0,"I was very excited that Fogo was doing restaurant week last year (2010). However, I didn't realize until after we got there that their restaurant week prices ($44 for dinner) are only $5 off their normal price. Fail. Isn't the point of restaurant week to try and entice diners to come back and pay full price for your menu? For full disclosure, two years ago we went to Brazzaz for restaurant week. They did a $35 dinner, which seems much more reasonably priced. We thought it was good, but everyone raves about Fogo so we had to try it. We made a reservation but still had to wait about a half hour. First strike. They directed us to the bar, which was similarly crowded. We couldn't sit down, but one of the waiters still offered us a bread basket, which was nice, but were we supposed to hold it in our hands along with our drinks? Also, I sent by boy to the crowded front of the bar to order drinks with a request for a mojito. The bartender basically pushed him into ordering 2 caprihinhas, mostly it seemed because they had those pre-mixed, so when dealing with a ton of people I guess they try to push this ""signature"" drink. It was alright. The boy got a strawberry version of it that was much tastier. We sat down at our table and decided we would get a bottle of wine because we were in a splurgy mood. Now, I am 25. I look 25. The boy is older, but he definitely doesn't look over 30. The waiter recommended a $200 bottle of wine for us. To me, it doesn't really make sense, when considering your customer, to recommend something that expensive. I mean, maybe I'm a 25-year-old business prodigy, but the chances that I am a 25-year-old poor graduate student are much higher. I realize though that they are trying to make money, so I'll let that slide. Salad bar was meh. Nothing was really all that amazing, plus I didn't want to fill up. Then the meat began. The signature Picanha (top sirloin) was way overseasoned for me. When I eat awesome meat, I like to taste the flavor of the meat, not salt and garlic. The filet mignon was pretty good, but most of the portions we got were overcooked despite asking for medium rare pieces. The sausages were all pretty tasty. Most of the pork we tried was dry. I think the only thing that was awesome was the lamb roast, and that was after a waiter brought over a piece that was truly medium rare. The sides were pretty tasty as well. It was nice that those were unlimited as well. Overall, I think it was a little overpriced and the meat was not as well-cooked as I would have expected. I think I will stick to normal steak houses where your meat is prepared to order vs. the all-you-can-eat extravaganza of meats that aren't exactly what you want.",0.9965,0.835,0.139,0.025,0.5721335697399526

Let's just go through the motions.  You sit down, with your chair pulled out for you nonetheless, and order your drinks.  OK, easy.  They will ask you if you have been here before or have eaten at a Brazillian Restuarant.  Just say yes if you want to avoid an explanation.  I will go ahead and do it for you now...  You have a card, green on one side, red on the other.  Simply place the green side up for meat, and lots of it, and then turn the red up when you want them to stop hovering over you.  Now trust me on this, their awesome service is just what I stated.  They will quite literally swarm you with meats and lots of it as long as the green side is up.  IT IS SO GOOD. They also have a salad bar, which I went to in between meats.  Whatever green sauce they had up there was enough for me to go back.  Do not eat a lot of salad before your meats, that way you can save room for meat and go back to the salad bar in between. I wouldnt bring a date here if you are trying to perform later on because you both will just be miserable.  I had to go sit down for a few hours, and could barely move.  Its not worth coming here if you are not going to eat all the meat you can stuff in your meat pocket of a stomache.  Oh god, just thinking about that green sauce was good.

The endless side dishes include brazilian pão de queijo (warm cheese bread)...polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas yumm yummm yummm!

You have different meats coming towards you ready to be freshly sliced onto your plate From delicious top sirloin, filet mignon, beef ancho (rib-eye)....let me just put it this way ENDLESS delicious meats!

You won't be sorry, but we did eat meat.  You never run out of meat. It's an endless supply of all you can eat meat. Make sure that you haven't eaten all day so that you can get your money's worth. You just flip your paddle over and they are over immediately to refill your meat. It's fresh and at the perfect temperature. It's very pricey, but what we found is that if you go for lunch instead of dinner, you get the exact same thing and save quite a bit. They just assume that you will eat less during the day.

Our waiter didn't seem to be pleased to have to serve during restaurant week.  Okay, I get it.....the bills are smaller than normal during this week, and the cheaper prices may be bringing in some riff-raff (compared to what they may be used to), so they may be getting lower tips.....but if you treat me right from the start, you will get a large tip from me.  Just because I enjoy a deal doesn't mean I am cheap.

There isn't a parking lot so parking may be hard to find but they do offer a cheap valet service which is the easiest way to go. The service is impeccable! For those who have never experienced dining at Fogo de Chao, they have a special way of serving you. You are given a ""card"" of some sort that has a red side and a green side to it. Whenever you want more food, flip the card to the green side, and a server will be at your table side within seconds. Whenever you don't want to be bothered, flip it to the red side and they'll leave you alone to enjoy your food. Aside from the amazing service, the food in excellent. Fogo de Chao features one of the largest and highest quality salad bars I've ever had. You serve yourself at the salad bar so you can create any variation of salad with different inredients every time. There's sun dried tomatoes, fresh salmon, olives, mozzarella balls, etc. etc. Along with the salad bar, the main part of Fogo de Chao, is the brazilian meats. Everything is so fresh and cut so well. There are over ten (I believe) different types of meat, all varying in taste, but all sustain high quality. The price tag may be a bit pricey for some, but with the service and quality of food, I think the price is more than reasonable (it's usually between $50 & $100 per person, I can't remember the exact price).

From the moment you sit down the staff welcome you and make you feel at ease.

Made so perfectly! My mouth is watering just thinking about it again. The sides of fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and fried sweet plantains are the perfect compliments to the meats. The staff has the best wine suggestions and an excellent selection, once you have finally finished with the amazing dinner and wine don't forget the coffee, even if you are not a coffee drinker it is to die for with the best creme brulee I have ever had.

Even as good as it is, it falls short of Texas De Brazil here. When you return to your table you'll find fried plantains, fried polenta, mashed potatoes and some wonderful, hot, cheesy tasting rolls. I think the rolls are amazing. I would go here for the rolls alone. Once you're settled in the real show starts, the parade of meats. Gauchos roam the room with sizzling skewers of meat fresh from the grill. They'll come to your table and ask you how you like it cooked, and then slice you off an appropriate piece. The meat is well seasoned, it every bite is nice and hot. Unfortunately you really get what you ask for plus or minus a temperature. The ribs I had here were also way way overdone.

Overall, everything was great.  Food was really well seasoned and the meat was up to par with all the expectations. Salad bar wasn't as good as the one at Brazzaz. They definitely had more variety and not just salads. Although I noticed Brazzaz has more of a variety of meats , the meat at Fogo isn't overly salted and is perfectly seasoned. But Fogo's only downfall is probably the pineapple. And the simply fact that they don't have any. That is the only reason why I took 1 star off. No pineapple, No star!... I'm a greedy Mofo!   There's is something that is awfully uplifting after eating pounds of meat, you taste some pineapple. For some reason, the sweetness of the pineapple cleanses you platte as well as prepares you for the next round of meat. Without it, the meat start to taste the same and you get fuller faster. This is what I've noticed.  Service was impeccable. The manager came by to talk to us and people were our beck and call. Our water glasses never became less than 75% full. There was also an incident where the manager accidently brushed our menu and it fell to the ground. The waiter then accidently stepped on it. The manager then ushered the waiter to give us a new one while he picked up the one on the floor and proceeded to rip up the old menu and toss it. Wow, I've never had service like this before. I could get used to this, but with the price tag.... Probably not a good idea for my wallet.

2010-12-01,4.0,"I'm a recently converted paleo diet guy, and this place is the center of the paleo universe. 3 tips on strategy: 1. To begin, don't go to the salad bar. If you do, then only put tiny items on your massive plate. The final plate shouldn't look like comfort food at a buffet; rather, it should look like ultra haute molecular gastronomy. 2. Don't eat any of the (unsolicited) carbs that they put on the table: polenta is boring, bananas are cheap, and mashed potatoes are ... okay, they are good, but that's not why you went to Fogo de Chao. 3. If anybody asks if you need anything, tell them that you want the filet mignon to come around. Nothing would be more tragic than spending $50 and getting full before the filet rolls around. Don't leave this to chance; speak up. All of the meats are good, but the filet is just a little better.  4. Always direct the meat cutter to give you the smallest amount possible. This will make you more likely to try all of the meats.  Bonus free stuff tip: If you are there for a special occasion (birthday, graduation, engagement, anniversary, etc.), let the waiter know when he or she inquires. At the end they'll bring out a huge piece of chocolate cake. Its not good cake, but you know the old line about sex and pizza: even when its bad its good.  While nobody should lie about these matters, of course, shyness is not a virtue in this context.

2010-10-10,4.0,"Took my hubby here for his bday and we loved it. We've been to Brazzaz and Texas de Brazil and by far Fogo is notches about the rest when it comes to churascarrias.  Salad Bar - The size of the salad bar is much smaller than that at Brazzaz but the quality is superior. The Caesar salad dressing is excellent. Everything we sampled was excellent.  Meat - As non pork eaters, there definitely were fewer options for us to eat, but definitely still satisfying and delicious. The bottom sirloin and house specialty were both excellent. The garlic beef and the chicken were extremely flavorful. The rib eye cut is also delicious. We found the filet cut a bit dry but still flavorful. The lamb chops and leg of lamb were also both delicious. Basically we didn't really meet a meat we didn't like here. The one thing we missed out on was the beef ribs that they bring out on a wooden cutting board. We didn't see this cut until after we were already having dessert, but definitely will have to check it out in the future.  Sides - The sides here are delicious. Mashed potatoes are flavorful and garnished with cheese and paprika. The fried polenta was a little on the crispy side for me, but still delicious. The bread is out of this world!!! The fried bananas were beautifully caramelized. The nice thing about Fogo is the minute they see your sides are even close to being done, they swoop in and swap them out for a new set. It is much nicer than at other churascarrias where you have to ask for refills on the sides.  Service - Service here is top notch... 100% better than the other churascarrias. We were waited on by an attentive but not overbearing or intrusive waiter. The people serving the meat were attentive, remembered that we didn't eat pork, and very accommodating to the cuts of meat we requested. Also at some of the other churascarrias you have to wait a LONG time before the meat guys come back to your table. Here there was a nice balance of being served an array of different meats without being bombarded by too many at once or not having any meat come around at all for long periods of time. Service is good without being pretentious, which is always a plus. Server took a little while to refill my drink so he gave us our dessert on the house, which was ridiculously good. Must try the CHOCOLATE LAVA cake here!!! Delicious.  Ambiance - Lots of hustle and bustle where eating is definitely an interactive experience. Was there on a busy Sunday night and definitely preferred it that way so that meat was coming out fresh and hot.  If you're a meat lover, definitely give it a go.

2010-09-24,4.0,"After 475 reviews, what can I say that hasn't already been said? Probably not a lot. So here are my tips for a successful experience at Fogo de Chao:  - Go only if your job is paying, because then you can go all out and you don't have to worry about what I'm sure was an obscene bill, though probably made less obscene because we came for lunch and not dinner - tip: it's the same menu.  - If you're a single lady and wondering where all the hot guys in Chicago are during a Friday lunch hour, I'm here to tell you they're not at a bar. They're at Fogo getting their meat on. Hot guys + meat = win!  - If you're with a large group, don't sit in the far corner, as this will decrease your champagne refills and thus consumption by approximately 75%.  - I liked our server, except she kept refilling other people's champagne glasses who weren't even drinking it and wasn't refilling mine and I WAS drinking it. Don't stand between me and my bubbles, lady.  - They really need one of those red/green circles for booze. Mine would have been GREEN.  - The salad bar is no joke. Load up on salad and veggies, but do not eat them all at once. I will come back to this.  - Do not attempt to run out with the bowl of bacon on the salad bar, even though you will want to. Act like a lady.  - You will be overwhelmed by all the meat coming at you. Don't be. It's a good thing.  - For the love of god, get the filet mignon. It will literally melt in your mouth and you will look back on that moment fondly for weeks to come.  - The bacon wrapped filet mignon is also a gift from heaven, but takes 2nd place for me.  - I did not enjoy the bacon wrapped chicken as much as I thought I would.  - The sausage is good for one bite and that's it.  - You will lose track of the rest of the meat you ate, but that's okay.  - The mashed potatoes are good, but do not waste time on carbs.  - Those little rolls are also good and somehow not filling at all.  - If you are like me and have dramatically cut back your red meat consumption and fear what a trip to Fogo de Chao will do to your digestive system, here's my tip: upon returning from the salad bar, eat a small portion of salad. Then, for every two bites of meat you must eat one to two bites of veggies. Your digestive system will thank you, and you will thank yourself later for your brilliant idea.   - If the thought of dessert makes you want to vomit, get it anyway. The creme brulee is the perfect way to end your meal and prepare your body for the nap it will be taking later.  - Eat a bite of the chocolate molten cake and not one bite more.  - When you get home, immediately wash the meat glow from your face. You will feel a thousand times better.  - When laying on your couch in a meat coma, do not laugh at your friend who kindly asks you out to dinner. It is not nice and your friend may not appreciate it.  - You will likely not be hungry again for 24+ hours, so don't plan on any other meals before then. Now go forth and eat meat.

2010-08-23,5.0,"My girlfriend took me here on my quarter century birthday (sort of a surprise). She told me that someone told her that eating at Fogo de Chao should be on everyone's ""bucket list."" It was never on mine, but I quickly added it and crossed it off.  The best thing about this joint is not only the food, but the tremendous service as well. As soon as we walked in, we were fairly greeted and escorted to our seats. The host (Pool) introduced himself as well as how the restaurant works; it was either kind of loud or we're just plain deaf because we had a hard time hearing the guy. The lowest level our water got was 80% full, the water guy just kept filling and filling.  The first thing we tried was actually the Pao de Queijo (warm cheese bread) the bussers placed on the table. Our first round was real fresh because we saw the smoke coming out of the bread. The bread was real soft and the cheese really complemented it. So we went on ahead and headed to the all-you-can-eat salad bar and enjoyed ourselves some appetizers. I got myself additional bread, Jumbo Asparagus, some sort of raisin salad, bacon, Italian Salami, as well as some salsa, which were all fairly good, especially the salsa. The cheese display was also magnificent.  After the appetizers, we turned our ""red stop"" card to the ""green go"" side and as soon as we did that, 2 plates were placed on our table and the gaucho chefs swarmed to us like killer bees with sharp knives.  The first meat we tried was the Picanha, which is the prime part of the sirloin that is seasoned with sea salt (or flavored with garlic). With this meat, you could really taste the sea salt, really good. We also tried the Filet Mignon, Beef Ancho, Frango (Chicken wrapped with bacon), Fraldinha (bottom sirloin), Alcatra (top sirloin). In my unpaid opinion, all the meats were cooked to perfection; I really liked the Frango as well as the Filter Mignon due to the taste of seasoning and the texture of the meats. Steak sauce or other sauces are only not a necessity due to the packed flavors the meats already bring to the table.  Side dishes such as Crispy Hot Palenta, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Caramelized Bananas (or what my people call Banana Q) also came to our table. The palenta and potatoes were decent but I truly enjoyed the plantain bananas due to its sweetness.  Finally, when we finished, one of the servers brought in a five-layered molten chocolate cake (with strawberry) for my birthday, which was great by the way. I was chocolate wasted after I ate it.  Overall, I had a decent experience, and I only claim decent because I wasn't fully prepared for the experience. I gave a five out of five rating due to the excellent customer service and of course, the quality and the taste of the meats. I found it unique that all the workers have a little scraper that they use whenever there are scraps left on the table.  You can't really try all the meats, drinks, deserts, side dishes, and appetizers in one sit-in (unless you really try). For a price of about $60 per person, you should be able to. One of my regrets is as mentioned above; I didn't get to try all the meats. I never came across the Cordeiro (lamb), Costelo de Porco (pork ribs), Linquica (sausage), as well as the Brazilian flan.  My other one biggest regret could have answered my complaint when I was eating....""Where is the rice?"" Being a person who eats rice on a daily basis, I kept complaining that what these fine meats are missing is my favorite daily food complement. However, unbeknownst to me, rice was available and that I never got to request it. But then again, life's too short for regrets and there's always a next time, now I just got to wait for a special occasion to come along.  You definitely should not eat before you come here. Food coma may occur. Great food and excellent customer service, I'd definitely come back here, and so should you if you've never been.

Next was the meat- it was so well flavored and cooked to perfection. My favorite was the filet wrapped in bacon. The leg of lamb and the chicken sausages were also very good.  We decided to get the specialty drink too which was also strong and delicious- no light pours on this bad boy. My husband had the lime/rum one and I have the strawberry/vodka one-very good.

They can get busy during the weekday lunch hours and on the weekend so reservations are highly recommended.  Just valet the car to save yourself the hassle and the precious eating time.  Staff is always friendly and you never have to wait long for a table after stepping through the door.  Definitely worth a try, you'll be hooked once you do.",0.9868,0.744,0.214,0.042,0.5362962962962963

Otherwise you'll only get the standard sides: garlic and cheese mashed potatoes, fried polenta, plantains, cheese rolls. Another tip: Make sure you request any meats that you want to try b/c some meats don't always come out on the floor. In essence, GREAT food, GREAT drinks, and GREAT service...worth every penny.

Before I hit the service line, the concept of a Brazilian Steakhouse is amazing. Obviously from all of the reviews below, you better come hungry. I was taken away by the sheer amount of food that was available to us. Not just the amount, but also the quality. USDA Prime - that stuff is NOT cheap.  We made reservations a few days in advance, though I was surprised that we were able to get in - this is a pretty popular place. You can make reservations through their website as well - pretty easy and accurate.  I read the reviews before our visit and knew ahead of time that it wouldn't be a good idea to come in shorts, flip flops and a t shirt. I did see a few people there - there's no dress code here, but you can tell that this is more of an upscale place. I went with a pair of Dockers and polo - nothing crazy. I saw people decked out in trampy dresses - all the power to them, I'm not here to drool over you - just the food.  Our server was pretty sharp - though he really pushed drinks. Most drinks are $3 a glass (pop included). No free refills here. Don't worry, no charge for water or even the lemon slices to go with it.  They don't kid around when it comes to food - I hit the salad bar for a small side dish, but other than that it was all meat. I saw people load up on salad. WTF is that all about? You go to a Brazilian steakhouse and eat salad? Really? I paid 50 bucks here and am not wasting my time with salad.  The meat was fantastic - no matter what you try, you will likely enjoy it all. Don't go here expecting one type of meat, you really should try it all. Granted there were some that I didn't like, but I still gave it a shot. I'm not a fan of pork loin - tried it, didn't go back for seconds.  Don't discount the ribs - I thought they were BBQ. Not the case. Fan F*&^in' tastic.  Drawbacks - cramped seating... pushy servers for drinks. That's it! Nothing terrible - just enough to not deserve a 5 star rating.

2010-07-12,5.0,"Okay after a long day of exams (Step 2 CS) I had to celebrate. Plus it's my birthday. So I'm going to indulge myself with my friend and his cousin on a buffet of finely grilled meats. And the feasting was delicious. With a reservation for 3 on a Tuesday night, there was no wait. The servers politely explained the process, and offered drinks. I was interested in their Brazillian soda similar to a ginger ale, but they were out! With profuse apologies, they offered a sparkling limeade which I thought had a hint of mint. Absolutely delicious, I think I had at least 4-5 cups of it throughout the night. While still keeping room for the main course of course! After starting with a light ""salad"" (the only green thing on my plate was a piece of asparagus) let the festivities begin! Here are my thoughts on a various cuts of meat: Picanha - My absolutely favorite. Delicious and flavorful beyond belief. Juicy and tender cuts of meat seasoned lightly but bursting with flavor. I had at least 4-5 generous slices of this cut. Filet Mignon - This was the first time I've ever had a filet, and I had maybe three 6-oz chunks of it. It was delicious and tender, but not as tender as I had expected. Nevertheless it was good, as well as the extra bacon wrapped piece I had. The bacon added a nice crunch and saltiness that can't be described. Beef Ancho - This was a beautiful cut of rib-eye, swirling lines, juicy and tender. Great flavor, the meat really shines. Alcatra - We kept shooing away the top sirloin (I mean, there are so many other wonderful cuts of meat going around) but I had to try it in the end. It had a delicious burn on the outside, and the meat was tender. Really, was I expecting a bad cut of meat at Fogo? Fraldinha - This piece of bottom sirloin was absolutely divine. It was extremely juicy, fatty goodness. Costela - Yes, while my dining companions were blissfully full, I continued my dining experience with these wonderful dry beef ribs. They fall off the bone, was a bit dryer than expected. Quite a contrast to the juicy and tender meats previously experienced. Cordeiro - The lamb here was quite delicious as well, I had possibly my first lamb chop. Not a bad selection, but not too spectacular either. Frango - Bacon wrapped chicken breasts. The chicken was a bit dry for my liking. Never did try the chicken legs, but it didn't seem too exciting. Linguica - Pork sausage. Deliciously spiced, it's a favorite of my friend's cousin. I liked it, but it was a bit on the salty side for me. What an amazing churrascaria experience! I'm so glad they didn't embarrass me because it was my birthday. They simply quietly brought out a complementary chocolate cake with a candle in a slice of strawberry, not singing, dancing, or any of those shenanigans.

The food is very good.  There's a big salad bar filled with enough food that you could easily make your whole meal on that.  I found Waldorf salad in one of the bowls!  When was the last time you saw Waldorf salad anywhere?  One of my dining companions said she thought it was bigger than the one at Texas de Brazil, but I disagree.  However that hardly matters since it's all wonderful. As for the entrees, I found the meat served rarer than what I'd asked for, not that it was a huge problem for me, I'm just sayin'.  Most of it was very good, though there was one cut -- forgive me I don't recall which one, it was all so overwhelming -- that was just tough, and the Parmesan-crusted pork that was dry with a powdery coating of Parmesan that was less than appealing.   The sausages, while good, were definitely not as tasty as the ones at Texas de Brazil. The polenta was excellent, the potatoes good and the plantains only fair.  I think they were overcooked.   The cheesy-poufs?  So good I'm convinced there's crack in them.  Totally addictive. Desserts are very good.  Good creme brulee, good molten chocolate cake, and a special which was fresh papaya blended with ice cream and topped with creme de cassis.   Also, very good coffee. The wine list is big, and so are the prices.  At a glance, I'd say that the cheapest bottle you can find there would be in the high thirty-dollar range.  The majority of bottles range from about  $40-$60, and by the glass?  Well if there's more than two people at the table, buy the bottle. The tab came to over $300 for three of us, with tip but without cocktails.  It's about what I expected for that level of service in that area.  And that means you really, really have to like the whole experience to go and drop that sort of money.  Fortunately we all do.  YMMV.",0.9982,0.762,0.197,0.041,0.6147230320699709

My rule is that if I can eat the meat and clean my plate before someone new gets to the table, they're not quite up to the level of performance I desire. Take that however you want; I'm not yelling at the dudes, but I WANT to be overwhelmed here, people! And at Fogo, you have to really watch how you flip that little red and green card--if you have the green up, the gauchos will swarm you like wasps on a pop can. And I mean that in a GOOD way. Salad bar/sides = fantastic. Even the little cheesy bread puffs at Fogo are way better than anywhere else. And the salad bar is packed to the gills with all sorts of premium stuff, if you go in for that sort of stuff when also offered a non-stop parade of succulent grilled meats. I tend to skip it and save all my stomach space, but that's just me--I'm goofy like that. When all the other spots close their doors and pack up, Fogo will still be there, kicking ass.",0.9908,0.787,0.179,0.033,0.5527634721600239

I have been to others, so Fogo had a lot to live up to, and it did a pretty good job... the salad bar left a little to be desired compared to other's I've had. Everything cold = easier to keep up with I suppose... Meat was incredible. Loved the top sirloin and filet, and even the bone-in chicken was delicious. As far as the sides go, the mashed potatoes and plantains are far superior to the fried polenta (which tasted like deep fryer oil only...). Got a dessert on the house, but how anyone saves room for that menu I'll never know! Recommend pacing yourself, plenty of time, and enough food to go around for however long you want to last!

I had a reservation so my husband and I only waited a few minutes to be seated. My experience was great! I ordered a glass of white wine and had some salad. My recommendation is to not make too many trips to the salad bar; leave room for the meat and sides, especially the potatoes!  All of the beef, lamb and pork was very well-seasoned and quite tasty. I loved it! I would definitely return. Service is speedy when your card is on the green side so pace yourselves accordingly! Dinner after drinks and tip was about $150 but it was ok for the occasion. Some people were there with their families and dressed casually in jeans. Others were dressed up in slacks or skirts. It's a pretty restaurant but I suppose it's safe to say dress for the occasion. 4 stars.",0.9706,0.852,0.141,0.006,0.591111111111111
2010-06-15,5.0,"I love steak. And I love Brazil (semi-unrelated). I can't state those two things enough... Having a bias for steak and the country of Brazil I tried so hard not to fall head over heels for this place. It didn't help that there was a hype from my friends and family who heard I was about to dine there for the first time. I tried really hard to find fault. I really did. Well...I just couldn't find much fault with the place. It was near-flawless. I dined here twice - one for lunch and another for dinner. I did not have to wait both times (lucky I know), but I know there was a pretty long wait for dinner. It's a fancy, white-table-cloth-dim-lighting experience that is classy and simple. Nothing particularly stood out in terms of design and layout. Lunch atmosphere was slower paced (more on this later) and quieter of course. Dinner was a vibrant, lively, and of course busier affair. Service overall was excellent and on point compared to other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to. When you have that green card up, you can expect someone to be there to serve you a cut of meat pretty quickly. When I mentioned the slower paced nature of lunch, I meant it as a much more relaxed environment for the servers and waiters. During dinner they are sometimes frantically running around - which is understandable when you have a packed house. That frantic pace can be a ""cold"" experience to some diners though. However, during lunch the servers and waiters are much more relaxed, not rushed, personable, and even funny. So the lunch experience was of course comforting and warm. Don't get me wrong, dinner service is excellent. Lastly, the food. Ah the food...simply heaven. The choices of meat aren't too exotic but they definitely have a very good selection. For me, I loved all the red meats. I think my favorite was the picanha...or was it the ancho?..maybe the alcatra? Lamb? Ok, so I loved them all. Everything was cooked to near perfection. My least favorite was the pork loin with Parmesan cheese, but my gal pal loved that one. So I guess as long as you like meat you should find something you like here. I didn't do the salad bar (I was here for meat!), but those I dined with said it was ok...not great but just ok. Compared to other Brazilian steakhouses...this is still the best in the city. There was one surprise - I'm addicted to the plantains no matter how greasy and oily they were sometimes.",0.999,0.701,0.256,0.043,0.5664095238095238

The salad bar was great too! But I was warned not to go overboard on it, since we'd be settling down for meat 'o plenty.  Only thing I didn't like at Fogo was the bacon wrapped chicken. I don't know why, it was just too bacony or something (and I like bacon!) I would have liked to have tried the pork loin, but it never made it's way to us.

2010-05-14,5.0,"Brazilian churrasco--a never ending parade of meat complimented by a massive salad bar where salad is an afterthought--is tailor made for Americans, and in Chicago, American city of steakhouses, Fogo de Chao reigns supreme. An outpost of the venerable Brazilian chain with more locations in the USA than in South America, Fogo offers the quintessential churrasco experience, from the steaks grilled by a live bonfire to the gaucho studs who only stop slicing steak off of skewers and straight onto your plate when you tell them to stop.  Fools fill up on the salad bar, the peerless pao de quiejo, and the addictive fried polenta. Those in the know save room exclusively for Fogo's spectacular beef. In Brazil, cattle is butchered into different cuts than in the States, and unknowns such as picanha and fraldinha stand out. Churrasco purists will note the absence of chicken hearts and the cut cupim (neither of which suit the taste of most American diners). Some cuts, such as beef ribs, are generally available only by request. The spectacle continues well past desert (exemplary flan and tres leches cake) with a liqueur cart and a unique frozen Licor 43 service. In many ways, the theatricality of the experience at Fogo de Chao harkens back to the golden days of Don Roth's Blackhawk, where the food was the entertainment. Alas, there are no spinning salad bowls in sight, but I'll take a slice of Fogo's beef over a slice of ""Halo Heat"" Prime Rib any day.",-0.0,0.904,0.044,0.052,0.5253333333333334

2010-04-30,5.0,"Actually closer to 4.5 stars (since there were a few pieces of meat I wasn't crazy about...but I think it might just be which piece you get, so you might wanna give it another shot if it wasn't juicy enough the first try). I'm still thinking about this place a week after going...mmmm tasty! I went for a Thursday lunch after reading up on Yelp that it was about the same as dinner, and yup good call everyone! ""A"" had gone there for dinner maybe a week earlier and couldn't see any real difference btw lunch and dinner other than the cost ($32.50 vs $50). Lunch was also less busy and it was nice to have the place not packed with people. The decor was nice and the service was great. I got plain ice water and no drinks..cuz I'm here for the meat. I had to prove myself, ""A"" didn't think I could eat my $$$s worth, and I was up to the challenge.  I know EVERYONE says skip the salad bar, but I'm not one of those people who can sit and eat solid meat for 2 hrs. So I went and took a gander- nice spread. I skipped the mayo-ey looking stuff and went for some veggies and the mozzarella balls. The asparagus spears were huge but the bottoms were stringy, I liked the moz ball, red bell peppers and for some reason the beets. Skip the prosciutto and the smoked salmon, because once you get a nice juicy piece of meat...these kinda pale in comparison. So I sat down and began the meat adventure...*voom* 5 in a row came by and soon I had more meat than I knew what to do with in less than 10 min. I quickly flipped back to red. After a while, a waiter came over to ask if there was a problem...I guess he thought I'd put up my white flag too soon. But, really I don't think you should get more than perhaps 3 pieces of meat at a time. They get cold and really they taste best hot. By the time I got to my last piece it was pretty cold. So I think a good tip would be to pace yourself and flip that card back and forth a few times. You're not a quitter, you're a strategic pacer! I esp enjoyed the rib-eye, filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, and there was some sirloin I thought was mighty tasty. I wasn't too impressed by the lamb chop and the rib...maybe it was just my pieces but they were a tad dry. ""A""s ribs were very good..maybe mine was just a dry end piece. Also for the pieces of meat you eh-ishly wanna try..get one piece and split...see if itz worth you're stomach space and keep tabs on the ones you like.  Another great thing about pacing, is that they'll come around (probably wondering why the crazy lady has it on red) and ask you if there is a specific meat you want to try and they will send just that guy over. So I got rib-eye and filet mignon sent over again =). Nice, not have to wait for them to make the rounds again.  The sides they brought to the table were mashed potatoes, fried polenta, bananas and lil cheese bread puffs. I love mashed potatoes, but I didn't like the ones here. Tasted a bit like the boxed powdered stuff...if I were them, I'd work on the recipe and make them AWESOME mashed potatoes and see if I could entice ppl to fill up on that. The polenta was cold and forgettable. Cheese puffs were ok..but not enough for me to give up my prime stomach real estate. The bananas did me in. I went nuts on those...and every time I got down to 1/2 a banana they'd switch out the plate so I'd get more fresh hot bananas...*drool*, they were a great complement to the meat. So...2 hrs later and I'm still chugging along as ""A"" stares in wonder. The turtle has won this round. So take a nice day off, meander over for lunch and make the most of the awesome food. I enjoyed myself SO much I was tempted to talk ""A"" into going back in a day or two, since I was only in town for a few days...but thought that'd be WAY too gluttonous...*sniffle* I miss you...FDC, please come to the Bay Area. We walked away stuffed, but not feeling totally crappy. Which I was a bit surprised by...I've eaten myself into a fetal position at more than one buffet. So somehow LOTS of food and not feeling too shabby...some may say I've matured and learned to hold myself back, but I'd like to believe it was pure FDC magic. Definitely gonna go again next time I'm in the area.  Now I'm on the prowl for one as good as FDC in the Bay Area. I'm hoping it'll measure up, but I'm not holding my breath. P.S.

My favorite is the beef ribs... it's ""melt in your mouth"" delicious. I also very much enjoy the salad bar. I'm a big fan of their asparagus and their cucmber salad... YUM!!  I would take away a star because they charge $2.95 for a bottle of Sprite (with no re-fills) and $7.25 for a goblet of strawberries and some whipped cream. But then I give them an extra star for service. Yes, the wait staff is incredible but I love the hostess. We go about twice a year and she remembers us every time. She greets us with a warm smile and she is the perfect start to the fabulous meal that is to come. Okay, just a couple of things... If you go during lunch hours it is only $32.50 per person which is much less expensive compared to their dinner rates. This place is children friendly. They make my 4 year old boy feel just as welcome as anyone else... for this alone I'll come here over and over again.",0.9924,0.755,0.225,0.02,0.615079365079365

Its a large place so if you are looking for an intimate vibe its not really going to work for that but if you want to eat and eat and eat.. this is the place.  I read another review that talked about them being slow with the nicer cuts of meat and we did have to ask specifically for the filet mignon (we were there for an hour and hadn't seen any pass by). We did see the pork sausage guy quite a bit in contrast.  We saw people would wave him away presumably waiting for the better stuff. Poor pork sausage guy.. all dejected. So theres that.

Before I make it through my caipirinha the buzzer alerts us to an available table.  The waiter hands us dual toned coasters, green on one side and red on the other.  We eagerly flip the coasters to green indicating readiness to receive the river of carnivorous delights about to engulf us.  Gouchos scurry around carving pieces of meat and piling them on our plates.  The house special is succulent, the filet mignon cooked to perfection.  More caipirinhas are soon required to dull our rapidly filling stomachs.   After a valiant attack on the torrent of meat, we push back our chairs and admit defeat by turning the coasters to red.  Our waiter appears attempting to tempt us with an array of decadent desserts.   We are far too full to be swayed by his rehearsed sales pitch.

A few of my favorites are the lamb, pork ribs, beef ribs, and bacon wrapped filet mignon. There has been only one occasion where I have had enough room in my stomach to have dessert. I got the creme brulee and it was scrumptious. I'm curious to how their other desserts taste... Staff is amazing. Every time we dine, there is one waiter who recognizes us and greets us.

The customer service at this place is excellent.  One of the servers spilled a little lamb chop juice on my boyfriend's shirt and apologized profusely.  It wasn't one of my bf's fave shirt so he didn't really care.  Less than a minute later, a manager came to our table, apologized, gave my boyfriend a shout wipe and apologized again.  Crisis averted, stain gone thanks to the service of Fogo.

All of their meats were delicious.  There were mainly beef dishes served to us, but you can find lamb, pork, and chicken as well.  They were all juicy and most of the time were fresh from the kitchen.  I wish I could take home a few of their skewers loaded with whatever meat they happen to have on it at the time. The service was amazing.  Once you flipped the card over from red to green (which signified that you were ready to start your animal extravaganza), a waiter would rush over and give you an empty plate and the servers would run over to try to fill that plate with as many different types and cuts of meat as possible.  They treated us especially well on this last visit with a manager that was very eager to please (he remembered and honored our special requests all throughout dinner). I love this place.  Would definitely go again. A couple of tips: if you go during off times, like for an early dinner or a late lunch, the restaurant is usually less crowded and you're more likely to get really great service (not that service isn't great when it's busy, but they are much more relaxed and fun when they do not have to take care of everything for everyone).  The price is fairly steep, so if you're looking to save a little bit of money, you can try Fogo during lunchtime on a weekday.  Make sure you make reservations, and if you do make reservations, make sure you get there a little early so they can start setting up your table.",0.9985,0.733,0.254,0.013,0.5260251322751323

I was totally unimpressed with the over salted and bitterly smokey meat.  It is nonsense to take what is undoubtedly prime meat and smother it in sea salt and then cook it over smoke.  If I wanted cured and then smoked taste I would buy some Ekrich smoked sausage for $2.99 at Jewel. The other major flaw I see in this operation is the piercing and subsequent carving of hot meat.  If the intention is to create shoe leather consistency then mission accomplished.    The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was pleasant.   With 1 drink a piece, 1 desert, and tip the total was $160 for 2.  For that type of scratch a much better steak and meal overall is available at numerous Chicago steakhouses. .   Post Script: The gimmick of all you can eat meat served by gauchos is interesting but fairly lame.  Moreover I suspect in Southern Brazil Gauchos sell the type of cuts Fogo serves in the market and they eat the garbage cuts.  The meat at Fogo is not deserving of the salt and smoke treatment.",0.8289,0.761,0.136,0.103,0.5223429951690821

2010-01-13,5.0,"WOW!!! I could probably stop there and get tons of ""useful"" comments.  I'm a picky person and this is one of the only few places that get my 5-star.  I have been to Fogo a hand-full of times and have yet been to those other Brazilian steakhouse places that shall remain nameless.  I am only reviewing this place solely on this place and not comparing it to them other restaurants.   The tables are nice and spaced out, you never feel like you are too close to the table next to you.  They have give enough room for those fine gaucho servers to give you all you can eat.  Once advice though, try not to sit in front of the winter months.  We did that once and it was quite a chilly experience.   Reservations are a must or be prepare to wait a few hours on the weekend if you don't.  The last time I went there, we arrived probably 30 minutes late for our reservations, the had us sit at the bar for 10-15 minutes before they sited us, which was not bad at all. Now onto the food, their food is superb, PERIOD!! The salad bar have a huge selection and it taste very fresh and it is full of flavor.  From sliced ham to cheese to other salad ingredients in which I am not familiar with but sure does taste good, it is all there.  Only thing missing would be some kind of soup, but that's really neither here nor anywhere else. They give you this red/green flipping coaster-looking thing on your table so when you are ready to pig out, flip it green and gauchos will be near and ready to serve within seconds!! From Fillet Mignon to lamb to chicken with bacon.  Everything is so great and if you get a meat in which you don't like, I'm not sure how that would even be possible, just flip it back to green and get something else.  I do have to recommend the fillet mignon and the lamb.  But just try it all!! The sides are great too, the plantains and mashed potatoes and not to mention those breaded ball!!! All so good, I swear they sprinkle some crack on everything! The drinks are good too, although I have only ordered the Caipirinha, a very cool and great drink.  Once thing to share though, the last I was there (November 09), my fiance ordered some martini drink and had probably 1/4 of the drink left on her drink and the manager (I assume) came by with a new frozen martini glass and poured the rest of her drink on the new frozen glass.  We thought that was really cool of them and showed they had a great eye for detail.   Besides the food, the service is awesome.  They don't do the whole one waiter per table thing, so whenever you need something just turn your head one way or another at 30 degrees and you can always find someone to help you .  If there's a certain meat that you haven't seen passed you by, just ask for it and they will bring it right away!!  Oh always try to save room for dessert.  I know its hard not to stuff your face with meat but the dessert are great.  From the tiramisu to the cheesecake you can't go wrong.  And if it's your birthday, they offer a complementary dessert (of your choice) with a candle.   Anyhow, I don't understand how some of the reviewers here are talking about them being vegetarian and giving it a bad review because their salad bar don't really cater to their needs, STOP IT!!  You know what you are getting into and if you don't, look it up on Yelp!!  I'm sure nobody forced you to go and if it was your group's decision to go and not yours, you need to find some veggie lover friends.   This place is great, no question about it.  Make sure you come hungry and ready.  Place is expensive, but like I said you should know what you are getting yourself into.  This is not a place where you are able to go every month or so.  So make sure you save up, have a good cardiovascular workout plan afterwards and get ready to pig out.  Enjoy, green means GO GO!!",0.9993,0.777,0.192,0.03,0.5849168270001601

2009-12-27,5.0,"Last stop on my Bermuda Triangle of All-You-Can-Eat Brazilian Steakhouse: Fogo de Chao.  The verdict?  Fogo by a hair---4.5 stars. I guess I saved the best for last. ""Dude, I love Fogo.""  On multiple occasions, I heard those four words during my visit two weeks ago.  Fogo de Chao is commonly cited as THE churrascaria in Chicago Land. So this was as anticipated an event as Tyson vs Holyfield. Fogo certainly is a heavyweight champ. This place oozes masculinity: the restaurant is filled with 7 and 8 tops of dudes. Servers are corking magnums of Cabernet left and right. Charred slabs of beef are flying from table to table.  This is where most men want to be when they die.  Can't say that would be a bad call.  Here's my churrascaria scorecard:  Quality of Meat- A All meats have good marbling and are tender. The meat is very gamey with grass notes. This may not be to everyone's liking, but this meat pairs excellently with wine.  Seasoning of Meat- B+ Most of the meat is modestly seasoned. However, I believe this is a deliberate decision. As a result, you really appreciate the meat's inherent flavors and the smokiness from the cooking method.  Selection of Meats- A- Fogo offers plenty of cuts of beef with varying textures and flavors. The selection is skewed towards beef. That's not a bad thing considering the restaurant. Beef-centric is fine by me when it's done right.  Frequency of Visits- A Fogo keeps em coming hot off the fire. Gluttony never felt so good.  Salad Bar Selection- B+ Fogo has a solid selection. Artichokes, Asparagus, Reggiano Cheese, and smoked salmon are some highlights. Personally, I'll leave the salad bar to the amateurs. Give me the beef!  Desserts- A No, I didn't have room for dessert. That's how good the desserts are! Tiramisu and Caramel Cheesecake are devilishly good.  In fact, I think I will refer to this place as Devil de Chao.  Mr. Devil says the business is beef. And business is good.",0.8158,0.771,0.131,0.098,0.436984126984127

Except, I stopped  way more often than Joe and they still asked me if I wanted some lamb/pork/beef. Then we got dessert... And I wouldn't recommend it because we didn't know how full we were...

2009-12-21,5.0,"If you want to OD on meat, this is the best place to do it. Excellent cuts of wonderful meat, properly prepared.  These Brazilian meat-fest restaurants continue to do well, and for good reason. At Fogo, the salad bar is good, the service is great, the décor is irrelevant, and the meat just keeps coming and coming. Yelpers seem to rate Fogo as the best of the breed in Chicago and I agree.  My favorites were the perfect filet mignon, the melt-in-your-mouth lamb chops, and the Parmesan-encrusted pork. I see from their website that the lamb in imported from New Zealand - interesting, because I've only had lamb that good before when it's been from New Zealand at events sponsored by the New Zealand government. If you go, be sure to try the lamb chops, they're a treat unmatched. Also the ""house-special"" sirloin was very good too.  You have to take control of the servers, or you'll have too much of items you don't want. Just plan to say no until you're really convinced the item being offered is exactly what you want. You'll still have way too much meat. I tried maybe six different meats and turned down another seven or eight. If they slice a piece of meat for you that's not cooked the way you want it, they'll unhesitatingly take it back and cut you one more to your liking. And be careful asking for rare - they do know how to bring out really rare meat, the kind people at the table will cover their eyes when they're carving off a piece.  Service was downright excellent. Not only efficient, but prompt, attentive, and friendly.  The salad items are good, and so are the desserts. But they're all secondary. This is not fine dining. You're not here for a five course meal, or a 30-course sampling with wine parings. This is an overindulgence of awesome meats. Properly grilled. And wonderfully served.

2009-12-06,4.0,"My first experience to a Brazilian steakhouse.   Our party had to wait about 15-20 minutes even though I made a reservation--a slight annoyance.  We were sent to the  bar which was very busy with just one bartender cranking out drinks to about 2 dozen waiting guests. The service was really good after that.  The meat servers were quick and friendly and they actually asked if you prefer any specific variety.  They tried to come back and make sure you'd get more of what you liked.  My favorites were the lamb chops, filet mignon (medium rare), beef with garlic and, surprisingly the chicken (white meat, wrapped in bacon).  The lamb (shank?) was not very good.  The variety of sirloins were decent.  Generally the meat quality was quite good and nicely seasoned (some on a bit salty side), and you can choose how done vs rare it is. No sauces required! The salad-cold cuts bar was merely a ""distraction"" in this kind of rather pricey all-u-can-stuff-your-face meatfest.  Why waste room in your stomach!!  The veggie, cheese, coldcuts quality was pretty good though.  The side dishes we had were mashed pt--ok; fried Plantains--very good (or just bananas?); and polenta--blah.  Of course, we had no room for dessert. Overall, very good food (and lots of it!), great service, pricey (but average for this kind of place I guess.)  The setting is festive, seating comfortable, good for small or large groups.  I saw a solo diner and also families with little kids.

2009-12-02,5.0,"So you push your way past the revolving door, glancing sideways at the huge cone of meat rotating slowly in the window. You wait for your table on the comfy leather chair. You're shown to your table, and given free reign over the salad bar. And you hit the salad bar, weeping over your tiny stomach, for you know that if you fill up on the wonders there (Waldorf Salad, hearts of palm, fresh mozzarella, salami, cheese, fresh bread) you won't have enough room for the meat that you've been promised. You return to your table with your plate piled high, to find a basket of what can only be described as cheezy-poofs. You eat about a dozen cheezy-poofs, because you simply have to. They are heaven. You then eat the entire contents of your salad bar-plate. And you're full. Then suddenly, and without warning, a dozen men in pantaloons swoop down upon your table carrying meat on sticks. And against all odds, you keep eating. You ask the poor man with the sausages if he could please send the Garlic Beef Man back to your table because if you don't eat another three pieces RIGHT NOW you will start to go into withdrawal. And then Filet Mignon Man passes by, followed closely by Pork Loin Man and Top Round Man... and then you realize that there are plates of polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas on your table. Have they been there the whole time? Do you possibly have room for more food? And as they roll you out the door ala Violet Beauregard, suffering the meat-sweats and wondering if there was something on the end of the salad bar that you might have missed (and did Bacon Wrapped Chicken Man ever make it to your table?) you realize that the meal was worth every penny (and man, it costs a lot of pennies) and that you may, possibly, never eat again. The End. A few insider tips: even with a reservation I have waited for my table. It's ok. It's worth it. You can order anything from any server, and yes, you can request that specific meat return to your table. You can also tell them how you'd like the meat done (rare, etc) and they'll carve off that specific piece. The price is exorbitant - it's about $50 a person, but that's all-you-can-eat. Save money by going at lunch - it's only $30 a person, same menu. You can also get just the salad bar for around $20 bucks, for your vegetarian Mother-In-Law. Drinks are extra.  You've got a little disc on your table that's red on one side, green on the other. When you flip it to green, the be-pantalooned men arrive. When you flip it back, they go away. I do love being in charge of my food arrival times.  Lastly, I have seen people here in all manner of dress, from tuxes to jeans. When it first opened there was definitely more of a fancy vibe, and I kind of miss that - it's nice getting gussied up for dinner. But, that said, it's also nice that you can roll in here after shopping and not get turned away for your attire.  This place is an experience, not a meal.

The interior is separated into a waiting area, a bar and then the main dining area.  The restaurant is beautiful with lots of beige and orange colors throughout.  The feel is very modern but with flair.  The staff are dressed in uniforms inspired by the ""Gaucho"", a loose analogy to cowboys in the old west.  This includes a festive scarf around their necks.  The staff is attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and most of all patient as you ask them 100 questions about the food.  The facilities are clean and beautifully presented. The salad bar is often the trap of a churrascaria.  You want to taste some of the stuff there, but not fill up so much that you can't enjoy the main feature: the meat!  I sampled some veggies including asparagus (some of the biggest I've ever seen, and crunchy), mushrooms sautee with white wine (wonderful flavor that hits the nose nicely) and huge beets that were meaty and tasty.  The cheeses that were put out were deep and delicious, especially the parm. reg. right out of the wheel, yum! The meats were extraordinarily tender and tasty.  It's always a bit sad when you go to a steak house and you have to drown the meat in sauce to get flavor.  Not here.  The lamb had a deep flavor without being overly gamy, the beef had a wonderful flavor to it and the lamb chops were to die for.  I wasn't as crazy about the filet mignon, but I think that's because I got a well done piece instead of the medium rare I usually prefer (I had forgotten to specify and just said ""yes!"" when the guy swung by.  The capper for the night were the *huge* beef ribs that are slow roasted for 4 hours.  I was full at that point but there was no way I could pass this up.  Fortunately one of my friends shared it with me.  The meat was tender, juicy and it had just the right amount of saltiness.  It was awesome.

But I remember you well.  A hefty price tag, to be sure (though lunch abates it quite a bit and you only lose some expensive meats and upper end salad bar items), but what a MEAT experience.  You start off with the salad bar - not just cold salad, but all sorts of grilled veggies, pasta salads, caprese, and it goes on and on.  At dinner you get some lobster and other items in the buffet, too.  The temptation to fill up on you is great, but I was warned not to on my first trip, and oh did I learn. Because then there's the MEAT. They have cooks walking around with skewers of kebabs, seasoned meats, sausages, pork, all sorts of MEAT.  You are given a paper disc that is red on one side and green on the other; it starts red.  If you flip it to green, the chefs stop at your table and offer their fare.  So I started with two, well three, oh god that looks good four okay STOP.  Quickly I had amassed four kinds of meat on my plate and didn't want it to get cold (and that's one of the great things about this system; you just get as much as you want and then stop for a while, to eat while still hot - and then repeat.) Repeat how often? However much you like.  It is limitless, and you had better keep some modicum of cognitive self-control about you, or else the flavor will let you gorge to the point of pain. Yes, they were delicious.  Strongly spiced in fantastic ways to bring out the meat's flavor best.  Granted, I didn't like the taste of everything there, but what I did like... oh, blissful MEAT. Yes, it's a multi-city chain.  But it still rocks.  Their tagline is ""The Gaucho Way of Preparing Meat ®""  If you want to see pictures of the amazing salad bar and meat skewers, go to their web site ( fogodechao.com ). Apparently they have a decent wine selection (I only skimmed) and large desserts - but who has room?  I don't.  Or at least didn't, when I could still go there. Go for me.  Have outrageous amounts of delicious MEAT.  Just don't bring a vegetarian date, unless they don't mind being surrounded by meat and you're willing to pay a huge amount for them to eat from the salad bar all evening (which is wonderful, but not worth *that* price).

2009-09-21,5.0,"This place is, ""As good as it gets""....when it comes to eating meat! We came here for my brother's bachelor party dinner and let me tell you, the food and service was amazing. Now i've never ate at a Brazilian steakhouse before but this wont be my last. They have a huge salad bar once you enter, which I believe is put out there so you can stuff yourself with rabbit food instead of eating the meat, which is really what you should be there and what are paying for.  They sit you down and give you a card. One side is red and the other side is green, red side corresponds to no more food as the green is a go. The way this works is they walk around with this plate filled with 1 type of meat, but there are different people walking around with different meats. Well if your card is green, they come to your table and ask you which piece you would like. They sometimes have meat that is cooked either medium-well and below. Don't come to Fogo De Chao expecting to eat your well-done steak here. For steak fanatics, they know well-done is killing your steak. Anyway, they have over +10 different types of meat they serve. Also as for the sides, they have fried plantains which were delicious and I forgot what the other side was, but you get 2.  I would definitely recommend skipping the salad bar and diving right into the meat extravaganza! Meat is very juicy and has plenty of flavor. I wasn't able to try the salad bar so I can't give my review on that. But from everybody else at the table, I take it that its very delicious as well. Be warned, this place will get you very very tired after eating all that meat so choose your destination after Fogo wisely haha. Overall, it seemed that everybody that came to eat at Fogo was dressed nice and was down to spend some money! Pretty expensive, but very worth it.

The food was great, the buffet was huge, the meats are tasty and they have an extensive variety (so pace yourselves), and the service was great.  The first gaucho asked me how I liked my meat cooked and returned every time with what seemed like specially cooked meats just for me.

Whether I was eating the chicken, sausages, or steak, it was all so good it would be hard to choose which one was best.

As soon as my class got less than 3/4 full, it was refilled. So, yeah, service is amazing. But the thing is, I NEVER saw the people refilling water and replacing baskets until they were at my table doing so. I swear to god, I dropped my fork, and as it was falling someone was replacing it.  I don't know how they do it, if they have little cameras and microphones at each table so as soon as they hear that you might need something they're already on it, but it's great.

They all have competition and a rich population of people familiar with and in demand of such a meal. Chicago has to be slightly different. The meat: High quality, well seasoned, and prepared on the salty side as they should be. The sides: I did not like all of the options, but the bananas were the best I have had in the U.S. The salad bar: An excellent combination of cool vegetables, as well as less traditional antipasta and other bits. I would say this restaurant keeps focus on the meat and sides. The drinks: Caiprihnas were very good but not that strong--my typical two turned into 4.

With that said, everyone's already covered the stop/go buttons, the fantastic diversionary salad bar, and just about everything else about this place.  I will say one more thing which is that I find about half of the meat options to be fantastic, and half of them to be either overcooked, exceedingly dry, or simply an inferior cut of meat.  Find the ones you like, and let the green light of your 'feed-me' token guide you to a blissful meaty slumber.",0.9014,0.817,0.112,0.07,0.5135714285714286

Yes, Fogo de Chao was everything I had hoped for and MORE.  I chose this destination as the fine dining for my 24th birthday celebration (I know, what a weird, useless year).  I invited my family for a lovely evening of fine cocktails, awesome salad bar, and gorging ourselves on meat.  Lots and lots of meat.  Be prepared when you come here.  I seriously wouldn't eat for the entire day just because you will ingest an unholy amount of delicious meat once you arrive.   My mom and I started the evening with a Caipirinha - a traditional Brazilian cocktail.  Yum!  I had the Strawberry Caipirinha and my mom had the original.  My cocktail had mulled strawberries right in it and it was divine.  It had just the right amount of strawberry and sugar to make it sweet without being overpowering.  My mom tried the Lime Caipirinha later and said it was delicious.  My boyfriend ordered a Coke that came in a cute little glass bottle - nice touch!  Their drink menu was extensive so there is something to please everyone.  Oh, and did I mention they have a nice, big wine cellar right in the restaurant?  There were tons of selections and the servers know their wine so don't hesitate to ask them for a pairing suggestion.   Our group was seated once everyone arrived and we were immediately greeted by a server.  He explained the entire Fogo de Chao dining experience to us and offered to freshen/bring more drinks.  He was super friendly and was always around when we needed him.  Awesome!  We made our way over to the salad bar to begin our meal.  Now, be careful.  You will be so hungry from fasting all day in preparation for your Fogo de Chao meal, that you will want to go overboard on the salad bar.  Don't do it!  Get a small salad and wait for the meat.  I will say, though, that this salad bar was pretty extraordinary.  Tons of options, sides, fresh veggies and cheese.  Oh, and the Romano cheese was inside a giant wheel and you chipped some of it off for your salad yourself.  That's good cheese in my book.   Now for the meats.  Turn your little token over to the green (for go!) side.  The Gauchos will literally appear out of thin air and start offering you piping hot meat of all varieties (beef, lamb, chicken and pork).  I will not tell you exactly how much Fillet Mignon I actually consumed, but let's just say it was an unholy amount.  It is so perfectly cooked and delicious it's unbelievable.  And all of the meat is that way!  Seriously, everything was cooked to perfection and I was not disappointed with anything that I had.  Highlights of the meat (for me): Fillet Mignon (obviously), Costela (beef rib), Frango (chicken breast wrapped in bacon), Linguicha (pork sausage) and Fraldinha (bottom sirloin).  All delicious, all perfectly cooked, all amazingly seasoned.   Oh, and they brought me a piece of strawberry cheesecake for my birthday - how sweet!  This dining experience was amazing.  I like Fogo much better than Brazazz and will come back here the next time I have a hankering for Brazilian food.  A mere $49.95/person is all you need to enjoy a slow, meat-filled evening of heaven on Chicago's near north side.  Seriously, go here if you haven't - it's so amazingly delicious.  Make your reservations early (it's harder to accommodate large groups) and know that the service is fantastic.  You won't be disappointed.",0.9988,0.792,0.195,0.014,0.6248015873015873

2009-05-06,5.0,"Holy meat lover's fortune.  Unapologetic carnivores like me will die happy at Fogo. The house special (Picanha) must be among the most tender morsels of steak I have ever had, perfectly seasoned with just a slight bite of sea salt. The pork sausage (linguica) and roast leg of lamb were major highlights, both juicy and perfectly game-y. Also, I am not a salad bar girl. To me, bars are for liquor, not for vats of slimy shredded lettuce, mayonnaise-drenched mush and neon canned beets. I was tempted to walk right by, take my seat and demand hordes of grilled meats directly from the skewer to my mouth. Then the manchego caught my eye. And the lox. And the marinated olives, jamon iberico, fresh fruit, hearts of palm, artichokes and roasted bell peppers. Delicious. I suggest keeping a plate of salad around as a palate cleanser between meat courses. The whole game at Fogo is fun - the stop/go signs, friendly waiters and strong capirinhas make for a delightful time. The only surprisingly unimpressive bit was the filet mignon. It was chewier than I would have hoped, but so easily overlooked among the dozens of other sizzling skewers this churrascaria has to offer.",0.9634,0.82,0.146,0.033,0.5888321995464854

2009-04-23,5.0,"On a beautiful sunny day last summer, Mr. N and I got married! Later that day, our families and guests all met at Fogo de Chao to indulge in a meat feast, because, let's be honest, could there be a better way to celebrate the union on the two biggest fat kids in the world? I think not. We'd been to eat here at lunch a few months before, just to see what it was like. Lunch there is great, for those who would rather fork over 30 dollars (as opposed to 50). We talked to a manager and made reservations for our party of 30 (small weddings RULE). Easy peasy! On the night, we had to wait a little for our tables, but it was a Saturday and the place was PACKED. We got to sit next to the big mural in the back room, which was beautiful. The service here is impeccable. Our server, Marcus was really patient and nice. It seems pretty hard to explain the concept to a big group of people who had never been there and were talking amongst themselves. He was so attentive and brought us a flan with ""Congratulations"" written on the plate for us.  As for the food, what else can be said? Filet mignon wrapped in bacon! Parmesan pork! Lamb chops! What a dream! Our vegetarian friends were happy too. The salad bar is fantastic. Every time I eat there, I pile so many marinated mushrooms on my place. Then I return to the table and gorge myself on the cheese bread balls, parmesan polenta sticks and fried plantains.

Service is spectacular with just the right amount of doting on customers.  The meat cuts are flavored well and delicious.  The salad bar is exceptional with plenty of chartucerie, cheeses, salads, which are phenomenally fresh.   My only issue (being the frugal person I am) is that the dinner is very high priced.  ($50 bucks a person or so?)  If you can swing it, go for lunch... it's half the price, and you get the same quality of food and service. Otherwise, Fogo de Chao in Chicago has set the benchmark to judge all other Brazilian Buffet Steakhouses against.  Other chuscarria's need to come experience how it is done here before attempting to set up shop.  They'll be hard pressed to meet the similar expectations. Even when you're stuffed at the end of your meal, do your best to order up a papaya cream dessert... not only does it taste great, it's good for digestion.  I'm not a fan of the splash of alcohol (raspberry I believe) they put on the top, so you can decide for yourself if you want it sans raspberry.

I think I want to be sick, but then I think of how awesome the food tasted and how I would never waste such deliciousness. Apparently they have a salad bar somewhere in that place.  It's supposed to be pretty good, if you eat that kind of stuff.  Actually, I did try it.  Had a small plate of some salad to put some padding in my stomach for the couple pounds of meat I was soon going to be devouring.  The chicken salad I mistakenly picked up ( i thought it was potato salad) was incredible!  Then the devouring began. They bring to your table the most delicious little rolls that taste like a piece of heaven (or a mini croissant) as well as fried bananas and polenta and some awesome mashed potatoes.  And those sides rotate throughout the whole meal  Literally, there were 10 of us at our table, and as soon as we sat down with our salad plates, we were MOBBED by guys with meat on sticks.  Anything you can think of - lamb, pork, chicken, beef, more beef, even more beef.  All cooked to the perfection you desire.  The flavor was so intense there is no need for any type of additional seasoning in this place.  Furthermore, It would be almost sacralige to taint the perfection that is this meat! Trust me, I know meat.  I wasn't 300 pounds pounds back in the day because I lived at the salad bar.  I know how to pack the good stuff in, and Fogo has it.  This place is worth every cent you pay here and the service is extraordinary.  They are very attentive to the needs at everyone at your table and go above and beyond to satisfy you.

But one day, my buddy and I found ourselves bored, hungry, and hankering for meat in Chicago. So, we called for a reservation, got lucky with the parking (which sucks in Chicago), and prepared ourselves for insane amounts of meat at a completely unreasonable price. Lo and behold, I thought I got my money's worth. Yes, it was as expensive as I thought it would be, but the flavor of the grilled meats was the best, just absolutely top-notch. After sampling the dozen+ meats available, my declared favs were the sirloin cap (picanha) and the rib-eye (ancho). We had a particular server who asked us if we wanted anything cuts in particular (after noticing that were were starting to decline some things), and then afterwards would come to our table first when he had a freshy with him. Sure, the salad bar disappoints... but why the hell are you coming to place like this for the salad bar??  They should hang up a sign that says, ""We reserve the right to refuse service to non-carnivores."" So my verdict... I would go to Fogo again. The meat outweighs any shortcoming of the salad bar.  Sometimes, it's nice to have misjudged.

At the table you have a two sided disk (red/green) that will indicate the flow of meal traffic you would want to consume. Obviously the green side will bring out the Gaucho chefs with a variety of fire roasted meats ranging from Fillet Mignon, Sirloin, Beef Ribs, Lamb Chops, Pork Loin, Tender Chicken and Pork Sausages. Then when you think you had too much and are full, simply flip the disk to red to stop.  During the duration of the meal drink are always filled with the quickness and plates and crumbs are cleaned up just as often.

Fresh bread and olive oil help fill you up. However, I just can't justify paying about $30 for salad. Even if I absolutely stuff myself, I'm hungry an hour later.

I think you get the best deal if you come here for lunch. The dinner and lunch menu's are the same but lunch is cheaper and not as crowded which really makes the experience more awesome.  The layout is so awesome, exposed brick walls, soft lighting, lots of space so you don't bump into your servers and other people...seriously you just have to see it to understand. The energy here is wonderful as well. You just sit and relax and eat and they run around bringing you food for as long as you have your little disk thingy flipped to green. The other staff are attentive as well. They asked us several times if we were waiting for anything in particular.  The food...is...so...amazing. Seriously. The variety is daunting. I don't even remember every item I tried but I remember ti tasting just out of this world. My favorite items had to have been. The fillet minion, the lamb chops, and the bottom and top sirloins(.I also really enjoyed the garlic beef even though it was on the fatty side).  All cooked to perfection with the right amount of seasoning and smokeyness. In order to understand how perfect it all is you really have to taste it for your self.  The salad bar is also good. They have some excellent cheeses and the smoked salmon is just some of the best that i have had.  Also they have a huge selection of desserts. Since it was his birthday my S.O. ordered the flan and it was simply fantastic. (They even put a candle on the plate and spelled happy birthday in strawberry sauce on the plate)  Again I cannot emphasize how awesome this place is.

2008-10-24,5.0,"Quick note on the salad bar: Yes, most of the items there are to fill you up so you consume less meat, but there are several items up there (make sure you ignore the SALAD completely, for it really is a waste of stomach room) that go great with the all-you-can-eat meat and side orders they'll bring to your table.  The mushrooms are great, and they've got some tasty cheeses that pair well with the rolls they'll bring you and some thinly-sliced deli-style meats and tasty smoked salmon that go well with the cheese. Quick note on the meat portion: You've got a little card in front of you.  Red means ""stop bothering me, I'm eating my meat"" and green means ""meat meat meat *growl* gimme some meat"".  Be forewarned, the first time you are here, you'll need to get used to the Meat Storm effect of turning your card to green for the first time.  Not only will three servers hit you up with their meat sticks (long metal sticks/skewers lined with one meat per server), but the first green signal will lead to you getting the tasty all-you-can-eat side dishes of fried polenta, fried bananas and mashed potatoes.  Just make sure you've got room on your plate (or a clean plate) for the many different cuts of beef, pork, chicken and lamb! Quick note on the side dishes: The mashed potatoes are nothing to write home about.  The fried bananas and polenta, on the other hand - I have written home about.  Seriously.  I love them so much, I was taking 10 minute breaks of meat just so I could focus on the warm and caramelized bananas and the crispy fried polenta sticks.  I'm sad that they only give you four polenta sticks at a time - but then again, if you keep eating them and emptying that dish, they'll keep bringing you more dishes with four more polenta sticks!! Quick note on the quick service: This is another thing you'll have to get used to.  If you're like me and are more likely to hit up a diner or Applebee's than this fancy churrascaria, you're used to waitstaff checkin' up on you maybe three times during your meal, if you haven't waved to flag one down otherwise.  At Fogo de Chao, prepared to be catered to approximately once every three minutes, whether you've got your card at red or green.  It's either someone coming to refill your water, someone to refill your side dishes, someone to check if you need a fresh plate, someone to ask if there's something special you need or are waiting for (my response would be, ""yea, get that lambchop guy back over here""), or someone just to come and scrape any food bits from the tablecloth.  I had my chair pushed in for me almost every time I had stood up for something - which is something a large hunk o' man meat like myself doesn't get used to easily. Quick note on the bathrooms: They are large and in charge.  Fanciful, spacious, nice muzak, spiffy sink setups, and forget paper towel machines or wussy air blowers - these bathroom have stacks of dainty yet sturdy napkins for drying off your hands. Now that I'm done with my quick notes, we come to the end of our meal.  I was convinced to get some dessert, mostly because they found out it was my birthday.  And once the man said ""flan"", I was locked in.  Luckily, I have two stomachs - and my meat tank may have been filled to the brim, but the reserve stomach had enough space amid the fried polenta sticks and tasty fried bananas to wedge in a delicious helping of flan - complete with a lit candle placed in a strawberry and ""Happy Birthday"" written in strawberry syrup.  And talk about classy - they charged me $0.01 for the ""birthday flan"". Take my advice, heed these above notes and keep in mind that the BEST time to go is the weekday lunch period.  It's the exact same food that you'd get at dinner, and half of the insanely-huge price.  I also advise you have a gift card for the place so you're only paying for the generous tip for the exemplary service - if you can get your hands on one.  Just keep your hands off mine - there's still enough left for one more lunch trip!",0.9977,0.835,0.129,0.036,0.5023464458247066

Graze on it sparingly between gaucho visits. The cowboy chef waiters occasionally have to go back and reload their skewers. Do not by any means be thrown off the trail and make the salad your meal no matter how good the fresh mozzarella balls are! 1. Don't be afraid to shut down the crap. I know it feels bad to deny the top sirloin guy, but give him the red card anyways. Make the fillet guy your best friend. Caveat: Parmesan crusted pork tenderloin is delicious.  2. Try not to resort to primal urges. You will way over eat and send yourself into a food coma death spiral, thus killing any hope of going out after dinner. 3. Leave the girl at home.

2008-04-15,5.0,"As a recovering vegetarian, I was sort of concerned with going to a restaurant which is so heavily meat-focused. Although I do love meat I'm definitely not used to eating huge amounts of it at once. There was a wait, but it was a Friday night, and they told us it'd be an hour for a party of two. We were fine with that, and hit the bar for a (surprisingly decent) martini. I had barely had two sips of it when we were seated. It took about twenty-five minutes at most. The service was fantastic, the waiter explained everything to us (we were Fogo de Chao virgins) and showed us the wine list. We didn't order wine with our meal as we still had cocktails, and opted for a bottle of San Pellegrino instead. The salad bar was good- but there were fewer choices than I would have expected. What was out was very good, though, with the exception of the prosciutto which was very dried out as if it'd been sitting there too long.  The meat was, as others have said, to die for. The lamb and the filet mignon were my favorites. I don't eat pork, but my date thought it was really great, as well as the bacon-wrapped steak thing. I didn't try any chicken, either. I'm all about rare meat, and they consistently gave me really good, perfectly cooked rare pieces. The only complaint I had wasn't with the restaurant itself, but the clientele. There were people in there wearing tee shirts and flip flops. If you're going to a reasonably nice establishment to eat dinner, please wear something slightly nicer. This isn't Applebees.  I managed to leave without feeling disgusting, but still feeling like I'd gotten my money's (well, my date's money) worth. We'll probably be back in the next couple of months as a treat.",0.9955,0.758,0.198,0.044,0.5842528735632184
2008-04-14,4.0,"This restaurant is amazing! If you truly love red meat and haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you've got  to try one.  Positive: The filet mignon is to die for! And then the filet mignon wrapped in bacon was even better! The service is outstanding. The guys (gauchos) serving the charred and seasoned meat have cuts ranging from medium rare to well done. If the cut of meat you want isn't available on that skewer, they'll get it for you. If you want your steak (on the stick) cooked longer, just ask! The chicken was surprisingly great too. They have 15 different cuts of meat. The ribs are OK. The pork and lamb are above average. The top and bottom sirloin is tasty. The pichanha (steak) is very good, but the filet is where it's at! The cheese rolls that come with dinner are very good. Negative: It's pricey. $48.50 for dinner. Granted, it's all you can eat and that's how much Brazilian steakhouses usually charge, but it's still pricey. The salad bar, while VERY fresh didn't have a very large array of choices. I understand that the meat is why you go there, so overall, it's fine. The parmesan covered pork has way too much cheese on it. There's no seafood. I hear some of Fogo De Chao's competitors serve shrimp. That would've been a nice touch. The fried bananas, polenta and mashed potatoes are good, but not really the point of going here. A couple of tips: 1. This is all you can eat, very tasty meat so prepare for your visit. You may not want to eat too much earlier in the day if you are having dinner there. I saw people looking very sleepy and others, well, they looked like they didn't feel well. It's not Fogo De Chao's fault. You've got to have stomach room. 2. While the salad bar is nice, do you want to pay $48.50 for fresh salad? Save your stomach room for the meat show!  3. Please pace yourself. Your stomach will thank you. They give you a coaster-looking object that is green (please bring me meat now) on one side and red (I'm taking a break) on the other. I recommend not having more than two or three meats maximum on your plate at one time. They'll get cold if you exceed that limit. 4. Experiment a little. Don't order lamb much? Try it here. Usually like your meat medium well, try different cuts at medium and you may like them better. Since it's all you can eat and you can just get smaller cuts  on your plate, you can afford to experiment and have fun! 5. While I've heard they have a great mojito-type drink, beyond having that, you may want to limit your drinking. You'll already probably be sleepy from eating all of that meat plus now you want to add lots of alcohol? Hmmm. It's up to you. 6. Allow plenty of time. At least two hours minimum. You don't want to rush through all of the delightful food and sights. We were there for almost three hours and had a ball. 7. You may not want to bring anyone who doesn't really like meat. Besides vegetarians, even people who aren't big on red meat will probably be frustrated. 8. Live a little!  While this place is expensive, if you love meat, find a special occasion and get over there at least once. You'll have a great time.",0.9984,0.752,0.202,0.046,0.48473376623376624

The wine list was comprehensive, the salad bar both essential as a palate-cleanser and supremely well-stocked. The service is attentive, as the gimmick with the tokens effectively demands of them.

Second time, I was disappointed. This go-round, I spent  more time at the salad bar, as the quality of the meat was just not quite what I remembered.

Hilariously tacky decor, people-with-accents in ridiculous culturally inappropriate costumes running around force feeding fat people from Oklahoma giant chunks of meat. Everything that you've heard or imagined about Fogo is true. Swords!  Pantalones!  Fire Pits!  Crowds!   Fogo De Chao is an orgy of meat. It is extremely important to schedule and plan your Fogo-day properly in order to maximize the benefits while minimizing the missed opportunities. First of all, the timing....   On your selected Fogo-day, you should be careful to eat a very carb-heavy breakfast and to avoid eating lunch entirely.  Do not snack in the afternoon.  Purge your body around 4pm somewhat, but not to the point of dizzyness (for you still need to keep the energy and blood sugar to walk into the door and sit down).  Laxitives, crash diets and liposuction are all possible ways to empty out your body of all non-meat prior to your meal. Once you arrive, you must understand that there are a large variety of dishes at Fogo, most of which are low-priced filler.  This restaurant has a wonderful Salad bar featuring lettuce and greens from all over the world.   Avoid it entirely.  This is trick #1.  Go for a nice leisurely walk around the room to whet your appetite, burn off those extra calories and glance at the rides in this meat-theme park.    Make a game plan and stick to it. When you arrive back at your table, you will realize that there is a wide selection of breads, polenta and mashed potatoes waiting for you as an appetizer.  Again.  Avoid this entirely for it is only intended to act as a distraction from the meat about to arrive. You look in front of you and see a two sided card.   This is the equivalant of a meat accelerator.   When flipped to the green side, you will find yourself surrounded by meat faster than you can say ""diabetic coma"". It is extremely important to filter out the lower quality meats from the higher quality servings.   You will see gentlemen arrive carrying hot-dog-looking sausages.  Avoid these.   Be patient and wait for the Sirloin and Filet to arrive.    Indulge. Although there is no explicit take out program at Fogo De Chao, based on previous experience no one either complains and/or notices if you start filling a pillowcase or purse full of tenderloin to enjoy at home.  It is extremely important to recognize that although moderately-priced, nothing screams out ""It's a great weekend in Chicago, but I can't wait to get back to Iowa"" more than going to Fogo more than once in a week.    Enjoy in moderation.",0.8601,0.83,0.091,0.079,0.5446784696784698

She'll keep an eye out for him and direct him to your table A.S.A.P.   5. The mixed drinks are REALLY strong. I think they make them that way so you will be a little buzzed when the bill arrives.

Go to you doctor and make sure you have your meds (Lipitor, Vytorin, Alli or whatever) so you can enjoy the full Fogo de Chao feast without stressing out about your health as you are pigging out 3. The salad bar is a distraction!  But if you must, please tread lightly as you will be full and not be able to complete the full Fogo de Chao meat marathon. 4. More distractions!  Cheese puffs/bread, fried polenta, those delicious glazed fried bananas and that mashed potatoes!  Evil! I always fold for the cheese breads!  Call me weak! Remember to order one of those Papaya mousse concoctions after your meal which will help digest all that meat. By the way, lunch is about $30 and the food is the same if you can pack in all that meat at lunch without going  into deep food coma at the office.  Good luck there. Favorite cuts: Picanha, Filet Mignon & Bacon Wrapped filet mignon, parmesan crusted tenderloin, beef rib eye. And don't forget the Capirinha cocktail.

2007-06-02,5.0,"This is a top 5 restaurant for me in Chicago. While I find myself dining at the suburban Brazilian knockoff joints more often than I eat at Fogo, this is the yardstick for all that come after it. I am a carnivore to the bitter end , and I would go to this place just for the salad bar ... not really , but it is the absolute best salad bar I've ever seen. You have the option to get the salad bar alone for $25 or $30 and honestly that could be enough for a lot of people.  It has sliced meats, any veggie you could want,exotic cheeses,fresh bread,and probably the nicest tomatoes I've ever seen (they must genetically engineer them or something)I go there for the meat orgy ,it is presented in huge chunks on a sword. The Gauchos carve it off to your ordered doneness. then they move on to make way for the next gaucho with the next hunk of meat. At any given time they have at least a dozen different meats , from Top sirloin to fillet , sausage , bacon wrapped chicken,bottom sirloin (my favorite), pork ribs,beef rib meat,and lamb roasts and chops. If you like 1 kind you can load up on that , but I like to get a bit of everything ... OK, a lot of everything. With your meat, you get sides of fried polenta, mashed potato's, and little cheese filled rolls. To say service is good here would be a gross understatement, It is one of the best , if not the best places I've ever been for service. The server literally changed out our rolls if they sat there for more than 4 or 5 minutes. I literally turned to find a server for another Coke and like in some sort of comedy he was standing right there with another Coke at arms grasp. The desert menu seemed diverse , but I usually order the Creme Brulee. I can say it is the best I've had ,although I've only had bad creme brulee once. You will drop some serious coin here , last time I was there It was $60 per for the meat and salad , if you drink , prepare accordingly for downtown booze prices. I can't afford to eat here as often as I would like to ,but for a special occasion , it is my go to place if anyone wants to make me happy (and also see me in meat coma).",0.9962,0.795,0.167,0.039,0.48214285714285726

I finally had an excuse to go when a friend came into town this past weekend. OH LORD! I love Fogo de Chao. I love ALL Brazilian steakhouses, but I think this one (the location in Chicago is the home of my first Brazilian steakhouse experience EVER, that fateful day two and a half years ago) is still my favorite. The variety is not as good as Brazzaz, but the superior quality makes up for that. I feel I must once again categorize my Brazilian steakhouse review: THE SALAD BAR: Not as many options as Brazzaz, but overall better quality. From the tomatoes/buffalo mozzarella to the broccoli and asparagus to the potato salad, everything is just a little bit tastier. I will say, though, that Brazzaz still has the World's Best Chicken Salad. But the chicken salad at Fogo kicks butt, too! If you're like my boyfriend and you prefer a lot of crazy stuff like sushi, raw oysters, and tortellini, you'll like Brazzaz better. But I appreciate the fact that Fogo does their fewer offerings BETTER. THE MEAT: Same deal as the salad bar... not quite as much is offered, but it's better. Don't get me wrong, the meat at Brazzaz is still superb, but the meat at Fogo is just a little tastier. They have most of the same cuts of beef, most of the same chicken/lamb/pork offerings, but they don't have everything Brazzaz brings around, like shrimp and pineapple. Again, it all depends on what you're looking for -- I'd rather have fewer options that taste better, but my boyfriend really missed the shrimp. THE SIDE DISHES: I don't see any major differences between the polenta, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. yum, yum, and yum at both restaurants. The bananas are less ""fried"" here than at Brazzaz. But the bread, ohhhh the bread. I am dangerously addicted to the cheese bread, and the Fogo bread is just BETTER than Brazzaz. Plus, it's always hot, and they fill it up so many times... heavenly. Embarrassingly enough, I ate 16 of those little things this weekend. True story. On a side note, we drank the caipirinhas at Fogo, and I thought they were good, but my friends (who are caipirinha experts, apparently) said the limes should have been crushed.

The sides (that are constantly replenished at your table, free of charge) are amazing. Polenta, S-mashed potatoes, and sweet fried banana. The flan (for dessert, obviously) is the best I've EVER had. Ever. I mean it. And the meat...the endless supply of meat repeatedly brought to your table by cordial men in spank-tastic goucho pants...is always cooked to perfection. Every single carnivorous option is superb. Try everything. TWICE! Keep flipping that card over until your plate is piled high with meat. And then when your plate is full...just inhale it all without breathing. Trust me. This is 100% safe and good for your body and health. If you don't like meat...well...what the FUCK are you doing here? Just leave now. This places thrives off of meat-hungry patrons. You do NOT belong here if you don't fall into that category. To sum up my feelings on this place in one sentence: If Fogo de Chao were a dude, I'd totally hit it.",0.9871,0.751,0.178,0.071,0.6173370181405896

2007-02-15,3.0,"Fogo is one of those gluttonous treats that I look forward to receiving from time to time without feeling guilty over the consequences, namely a post-Fogo weight gain that can immediately be felt even before you leave the restaurant. But seriously folks, this is a meat eaters paradise and if you or someone in your party can't accept that fact, steer (get it steer, as in cow?) clear of this place, or at the very least throw them towards the top notch salad bar. Between the meat and the salad bar, if someone can't find something to eat, then they deserve to starve. Typically I eat there about once every six months and have been doing so for the past several years. For starters, Fogo is no longer the only all you can eat meat place in town, but from my experience at other the other places, they still have the best selection of meats to choose from. However, sometimes I question whether the quality of the meat has gone down. At times the meat doesn't seem as tender or juicy as it used to be. I do like the way they salt and spice it though and this has not changed, but taste can only hide so much for inferior texture. But given the price to portions eaten, I can't complain. It is expensive, but worth it after several rounds of meat. Service: An example of quality teamwork and service in motion...that is once you manage to get seated. Even with reservations, I have seen walk-ins seated faster than complete parties waiting for a table, and have experienced this myself. I think they do that so they can steer larger parties towards the bar so they can order more drinks. Regarding wait times one time my friend could no longer take it- we had reservations, were early, and had to wait, while walk-ins of the same number of people were seated. She gave the host staff a piece or her mind and we were promptly seated with an apology soon after. Whether intentional or not, if you have reservations, and YOUR PARTY IS ON TIME, keep track of the wait, and be persistent towards the host/hostess if it runs past a reasonable amount of time. And stay away from the bar, you'll easily run up a tab from the very efficient staff. Once seated, you know the routine, green for 'Feed Me', red for 'I'm Digesting.'  There are several floor staffers that assist in clearing tables and inquiring about your experience. Here is where the service excels. If you have a favorite selection, need a drink, have a question about the meat, need a sauce, or side dish, ask. Usually they will go out of their way to find what you want. If it's not busy, they may even be able to customize an item to your party's request. A word of advice- soda is served from single serve bottles. There are no free refills. Keep this in mind if you want a soda. Pros: A wide selection of meat, regardless of the source or style selected. A salad bar that will redefine your concept of rabbit food. Eat at your own pace. Great service once seated- staff will go out of their way within reason. Cons: Reservation times are a guide to when you might be seated. Meat quality has gone down. All you can eat meat concept may not be for everyone. Drinks, any drinks, are expensive. An inverse relationship between your the size of your wallet and the size your waistline will occur if you eat here too often. I would've rated Fogo four stars, but the lack of proper service at the door on multiple occasions knocks the rating down a star. To sum it up: Any place that wraps an already tasty piece of meat with a tasty piece of bacon should be not be tried, but experienced.",0.9946,0.86,0.106,0.034,0.44576494427558255

I'm not an asparagus fan, but if I was I would have been thrilled by their fresh asparagus stalks, which were literally the biggest I have ever seen.  The meat portion of the meal was overwhelming. I felt like the guys came around at nice little intervals to begin with, but then all of a sudden a huge barrage of meat came charging at me. I had to flip my little coaster over a few times, just to fend them off! That being said, it was all delicious, and I am not even a big meat eater. Everyone at my table raved about the bacon wrapped meats and the parmesan pork. I couldn't tell you the difference between all the different cuts of steak I tried, but they were all excellent. I did get a little grossed out by the piles of uneaten meat accumulating on everyone's plates, but I guess that's par for the course at churrascarias. Somehow, we made room for dessert (probably because the company was paying for it!) and I don't remember what exactly it was, but it was damn good.

If you are as obsessed with meat quality as I am...or maybe if you are not, much of your time at the table is spent figuring out which cuts are good, waiting around for them, and refusing the meats that aren't worth your $50. The ""bad"" meats are the typical boring fillers - pot roast (given a fancy name), chicken, chicken wrapped in bacon, and some only marginally tasty lamb and pork cuts. Between discerning what you want to eat, there is little room for conversation.  There are also lots of non-meat filler items to distract you from chowing on filet mignon.

2006-11-30,5.0,"Fogo de Chao brings with the happy.  First: gauchos. With the most glorious boots ever seen on a human being. And giant skewers laden with meat that explodes in your mouth. And exquisite ability to carve exactly the level of roastedness you so desire (medium-semi-well? No problem). On one occasion, I asked for the filet mignon, and the server who arrives didn't have any more well done. He was so apologetic, and literally RACED to the back kitchen, where he came out with a brand-spankin'-new skewer and proudly sliced my well done filet onto my plate.  Also: they remember things. They remember that one of you is a vegetarian, they remember that you said you liked your meat done well, they remember that you don't eat lamb and pork but you do eat chicken and beef. I saw the pork guy see my green-sided coaster, come near, see it was me, and grab the guy next to him (the steak guy) and point him my way. And then wink and do a little bow at me, and take the pork far away. That's what happens at Fogo de Chao. You cannot fault a place where a gaucho assists you with your chair every single time you get up or sit down. At the salad bar, things that cannot be missed: the marinated mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, and asparagus (I know it looks really plain,  but it's perfectly cooked and if you wrap it in the wafer-thin proscuitto, you won't believe you ever told your mom it was too disgusting to exist).  Neglect not your sides! Those little cheesy bread-magical bits are amazing, and they will replace them if they even SUSPECT they might be getting cold. Mashed potatoes are glorious as well, but just taste them - they'll fill you right up.  Lunch is better for those watching their pockets, and the quality is exactly the same. For an extreme indulgence: the Inniskillin ice wine is about $19 for a little tiny glass, but every single sip is glory. This is one of those wine you barely dip the tip of your tongue into, because any more is greedy and the gods will slap you for indulging in the ambrosia without proper obesiance.

First of all, we were an hour late due to traffic and they still held our table for us. They had one of the most amazing salad bars I have ever seen. I wish I had one of those bottomless stomachs, because I would have loved to have tried everything on it. There was everything from veggies, to fresh cheeses, to pasta salads. My friend warned me though that was nothing compared to what was next and that I should go light with the salad.  You are then given this card, red means stop green means bring it on!! I must warn you though, when you do decide to turn your card to green, be prepared to be swarmed. I mean it was seriously like a contest to see how fast you could flip your card back to red before they would stop coming over. There were several selections of meat. I would have to say that my favorite was the parmesan crusted pork. Our waiter was very attentive. My water glass never went empty. The manager also was over to check on us a few times. At one point he asked us if there was anything we hadn't tried yet and we said pork. Within a minute we had 5 different servers at our table with different types of pork. It was crazy. Some people would say it is a lot of money, but $50 for all you can eat, really isn't that bad considering what you are eating.

Enjoy the food, the atmosphere, and the long digestion ahead. 4. Try everything at least once. You may be surprised.

The delerium lasts for about 20 minutes and when you come down, you are amazed that you just got high on meat. You decide to try again.
