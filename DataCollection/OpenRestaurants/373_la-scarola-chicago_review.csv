Wine list is excellent, deserts that melt in your mouth and one of the most friendliest atmosphere in years that I have visited. The menu offers a wide range of pastas, seafood and meats. Old school Italian food at its best. Great portions and the food that will challenge your taste buds. Once you walk in you can smell the aromas off all the different dishes they offer. They make a whitefish that just melts in your mouth. The Lorenzo pasta with its fiery chipotle sauce is a must! My favorite is the Filet Mignon in a garlic wine sauce with baked potatoes. Wow!

2017-06-29,4.0,"Finally, I got to experience one of the infamous Italian restaurants in Chicago, La Scarola. After hearing about La Scarola multiple times as a legendary Chicago restaurant that delivers huge/classic Italian dishes, I eventually had to experience this for myself. I am also a big fan of the food shows, especially Food Paradise on Travel Network. La Scarola was recently featured for the best chicken dishes episode with their Chicken Vesuvio. Home to a handful of original dishes such as deep dish pizza, Chicago hot dog, Chicago mix popcorn, Chicago is also home to the creation of Chicken Veusvio. After seeing La Scarola's Chicken Veusuvio on TV, it left me drooling and craving this dish. After careful consideration and multiple other reservations, my girlfriends brother decided enough was enough and chose La Scarola for his birthday dinner. After hearing we were going to La Scarola I was thrilled because I could try another new restaurant, which also means another Yelp review!! I was also excited that we were going with a large group of 10, and ordered family style which means you can try more items on the menu. I was surprised that we were able to squeeze in a party of 10 as La Scarola does not have too many tables. My girlfriend has two brothers whom both have girlfriends and we were also joined by their Cousins who just moved to Chicago from New York. With some of the best Italian food in the world in New York, the bar was set high to inpress the NY transplants. I can confirm that they were both happy with the end result and said La Scarola compared with some of the best Italian in NYC!  As you can see from my pictures, La Scarola defines an old school Italian restaurant. With the 50+ year old sign outside and pictures littered throughout the restaurant, La Scarola delivers a memorable  experience that many people have enjoyed for generations. I am a huge fan of the famous photos of diners and La Scarola has some of the best pictures around town. I believe that even Frank Sinatra and the old Chicago mobsters used to enjoy their fine Italian wine, cigars and meals here and it was their go to Italian. Let's get down to busienss and talk about the meal. Everything was pretty good but was not the best Italian that I have ever enjoyed. What I enjoyed the most was the bruschetta wih the homemade bread. The bruschetta apprtizer was the best that I have ever had. I also really enjoyed the Tiramsu as I ate about half of the huge picture that you can displayed with my review. I thought the rest of the appetizers and entrees (pasta, chicken) were all pretty good but I would not be running back here for. I definitely thought thay the pasta would be my favorite dish here but it did not impress. The chicken vesuvio was also good but I thought the dish would be incredible. The go to for chicken Vesuvio is at Erie Cafe. I am going with a 4 Star Rating, rounding down from 4.25 stars as everyrhing was very good but I am not sure if I would go back. If I was going to compare La Scarola with other Italian restaurants in Chicago, I have to say that I prefer Monteverde, Topo Gigio, Viaggo and Piccolo Sogno. The bottom line is that La Scarola is a must try and go to Italian restaurant in Chicago!",0.9977,0.838,0.153,0.009,0.5145302514945372

Was odd to be there with people smoking at 715pm.  I digress.... back to La Scarola at 7:50 and he told us it will still be a few minutes, so we went in and crowded ourselves at their little bar and got a glass of wine.  When the owner came by to seat someone he apologized and gave us a shot of tequila.  So at least it was acknowledged.  In this particular night, I wasn't (and neither were the other 3 in our party) particularly annoyed about the wait, we had a drink, we had good company so it was fine.  However, that shouldn't really happen that they don't have your reso then you keep waiting.   We were seated and the plates, cutlery and napkins were kind of thrown down on the table.  They obviously are very busy and crowded and their staff works quickly.  It was a bit abrasive, but again, I think I gave it a pass because we were in good moods and you're at La Scarola, an old school Italian place, not a 5 star super high end restaurant.  But still, they should have been a little more careful in not throwing our table settings down. We ordered fried calamari and once again, it was delicious.  It's not a huge portion and we had no problem finishing it.  I ordered the chicken milanese which was a special and loved it.  I was trying to decide between a pasta and that and I always love a good chicken milanese so went for it.  The salad on top was dressed well and had tomatoes. The chicken wasn't super thin like you find at other places but thin enough.  It had a ton of garlic on it.  I'm a garlic lover so it was ok with me but might not be with others.  My husband and our friend ordered a veal dish and both loved it.  My husband's had SOO much garlic on it, it was kind of ridiculous.  And our friend's didn't, so we're not sure what happened there!  Our other friend ordered the pasta with scallops, mussels and shrimp in a red sauce that had a touch of cream.  It was rich and delicious.  I had some of the scallop and shrimp and thought it was excellent. We were too full for dessert.  I've never had a bad meal here, it's always delicious and I always struggle with what to get.   Service at the table was great with our server--just wish the other staff setting our table up had been a tad more gentle, if that's the word!   But I'll forgive it because it's La Scarola!",0.9966,0.744,0.178,0.077,0.5746135831381733

We had a party of 2 and I had made reservations about 1.5 months ahead.  We walked in and told the person at the door we had reservations, and he kind of just laughed at us and told us to wait by the bar. We waited another 20 minutes and then were offered literally the worst table in the restaurant--next to the bar and in the hallway where all the people walk and where people's jackets are on you as they wait and while you're eating. As first timers, we didn't know better but I would NOT sit there if I were you. Wait even longer...even though you have a reservation... Service was rushed. We ordered the calamari and bruschetta. The calamari was lukewarm and super rubbery--straight up bad.  The tomatoes on the bruschetta were very finely chopped, so they tend to spill everywhere as you bite into a piece, and overall the dish was bland. While we were still eating the appetizers, the waiter brought out the pasta, so we had to cram all 3 dishes onto a small table that seats 2. We were rushed in and out in about 40 minutes--guess they were eager to seat another pair of people at the newbie table. There were only two good things about this experience. We shared the penne alla vodka, which was tasty. The olive oil they provide with the bread was good. That was literally it. I could tell this place was popular, but I just don't get it.

Now for the food - they give you bread at the beginning, though it wasn't the best bread an Italian restaurant has given me. I ordered the Pasta Primavera, and my friend ordered spaghetti and meatballs. The portions were very generous! Heaping plates of pasta that neither of us could finish. And it was quite tasty too! The primavera came loaded with lots of veggies, in a tomato based sauce. 8/10. But the classic spaghetti with meatballs was exactly what I wanted in this cozy dish! The marinara sauce was amazingly delicious, the pasta perfectly cooked, and the meatballs large satisfying! 10/10!

I split the cheese ravioli with another friend and we decided to add a few shrimp. I wouldn't order it again. In my opinion, the real star was the penne alla vodka, which my other friends ordered and graciously allowed me to try. The sauce was rich. It was amazing and I was immediately jealous.  We finished with some locally made tiramisu and a cannoli. I am a sucker for a tiramisu that has more of an espresso flavor instead of chocolate. It didn't disappoint.

2017-03-13,1.0,"I've been to La Scarola on two occasions. The first time was pretty dissapointing that it took almost a year to come back.  The server brought us octopus instead of calamari and he didn't come until the entrees came out so we ate that. It turned out to be the only dish that we liked. We had ordered zuccini, seafood pasta with vodka sauce( both were on the special menu), and I believe linguini with claims. Pasta was over cooked and none of us like it so we left it after few bites. It was bit difficult to get ahold of the server to order more drinks throughout the night, but he did ask to pack our food as it was barely touched. We said we don't want to take it and he didn't bother asking why. Obviously something is wrong, but obviously he didn't care to make return customers. Fast forward, last Thursday I was out with my sister and since we were around West Loop and we've been to all restaurants around numerous times, she wanted to check out La Scarola as she's never been there. Lucky her! I wasn't happy, but figured I should give it another try. We were seated right away little before 8pm. The server, Ryan greeted us quickly and we ordered pretty quickly too. So far so good right? This is where it goes downhill from. I never time the food, but gosh I got so hungry and it felt it's been a while. I looked at my phone and since I texted a friend the moment we ordered to let them know how long would approximately take me to meet them, turns out we've been waiting for about 45 min.  Fresh deep dish pizza takes that long to cook and you are always warned about it. The soufffe in Morton's too,but once again, you are warned about it. Actually recently in Maple and Ash because something happen in the kitchen we were told that food would take almost an hour and we were offered seats in nearby restaurants. We weren't in rush and didn't mind waiting as we like the food there,and since we decided to stay we were comped with few appetizers on the house and even round of drinks. It wasn't necessary at all,the food there is worth the wait,but just for comparison, talking about service here.  Back to La Scarola...in a meantime the table next to us was given wrong pasta and the gentleman had to wait for his dish while his friends/colleagues were eating. Tables were very close so it's not like I was eavesdropping. When we finally got our food, started with the eggplant parmigiana, one of their best dishes( their words from their menu, not mine)to find out it was burnt. Not slightly, but pretty burnt, black,and so oily( the oil tasted like it hasn't been changed in a while). 45 min is too much for frying the eggplant it seems like You would think you'll get fresh eggplant or fresh pasta waiting for such a long time:) Ha!   Btw, we waited another 5 min to get the over cooked pasta that comes with the eggplant. Tried that too, wasn't good.  Ok, now the lasagna... the tomato sauce was so sour, I really can't  figure out what they did there.  The server was no show or should I say he played 'catch me if you can'.It was another guy( food runner or a bus boy) who brought us the food and refilled our waters. The same guy offered a dessert later on and offered to pack our food. He was the only one doing his job that night I guess. We waited about 10-15 min when my sister decided she'll try to eat as her stomach was aching from hunger and she doesn't care if it's good or not anymore. She doesn't like returning or complaining about food anyways. Me neither, so I gave up, ate the bread instead and decided I'll eat at my next stop. Whatever. Eventually the server showed up ( note he was passing by our table few times and never looked or stopped by to check) to see if we need anything else. I nicely showed him the burnt dish. He said with half mouth if we want another one to be made,but we didn't have time to wait that long and we said we will pass. He never offered anything else and left. We asked for the check, paid for the food and still tiped him regularly( he didn't deserved it, but I work in hospitality so it's like by default).  Still can't figure out what was worse: the food or the service. Really tough choice. If the service was at least decent, I might've avoid bothering to open an yelp account to write this terrible review.  I organize events and recommend and make reservations for clients. Most of my friends also come to me for advice for a night out for themselves or their guests. Guess which place is not getting any recommendation? La Scarola was that bad that I had to put it here too as I see so many positive reviews. How in the world? If you want big portions and mid price Italian food, go to Sapori Trattoria or even Giordano's( can't believe that even Giordano's have way better lasagna and eggplant parmesan than La Scarola). Or just go to Piccolo Sogno, it's right there.  Whatever you do, make sure you pass La Scarola. Do yourself a favor and skip the Tums.",0.8879,0.821,0.091,0.088,0.48168501552647897

2016-12-07,4.0,"I cant believe I waited this long to try La Scarola out! Went on Monday night, not super crowded. I'd made a reservation over the phone, but didn't really need it when we arrived. They brought out bread right away, which was okay. Wish they warmed it a little and brought out freshly ground pepper or parmesan with it as well.  I got a glass of cab, which was decent for $8. Then we started with the bruchetta which was pretty cheap! $5.50 for 4 decent size pieces. Perfectly toasted and garlicky. Yum! I couldn't pick between the pasta and chicken dishes, so the server said they could throw some pasta in with the chicken dish. SCORE! Such great service. I ended up getting the Pollo Florentino with angel hair. It was so freaking delicious. HUGE portion, I barely ate half, but so worth it. Its basically 3 lightly battered chicken breasts with cheese and spinach in between them. It's all in a wine/lemon sauce that the pasta absorbed. My mouth is watering just thinking about it again. My friend got the chicken parm and also really enjoyed it.

2016-10-25,4.0,"This is the perfect place for an Italian Family to celebrate a birthday and keep everyone happy.  It has the old school vibe that the older folks like and the menu has a nice variety and keeps up with the times that the younger folks will enjoy.  The atmosphere is wonderful as is the traditional service that you would expect in a place like this.  If you get bored with your family, there are lots and lots of pictures on the wall to check out.  (We sat next to a nice picture of Jason Beghe from Chicago PD.) The wine list is great and we had tried a couple of different Red Wine selections, my favorite being the Napa Valley Silverado Vineyards Sangiovese which was smooth and delicious and lead to a 2nd bottle.   We had an antipasto plate to begin which satisfied all (good, but didn't really set it apart from other places).  For the main course, I opted for the Eggplant Parmesan, which was not the breaded kind (which is why I ordered it) and came with a generous portion of angel hair pasta.  The sauce is what makes the meal for me and the marinara was perfectly done.   We all shared the Tiramisu for dessert (birthday treat) and it was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  The Cappuccino was adequate and the fact that they were very attentive in serving makes this a great place to bring your family or a date.  If this restaurant was in a city that did not have so much competition, I would have given it a 5, but ... it's Chicago, with Italian on every corner.  My only suggestion is to find items to set you more apart from the vast amounts of competition.  (I'd still have yet to find a place that makes the traditionally fried Zucchini Blossoms on a regular basis.. hint, hint.)

There is no indication of anyone needing to be told what they need to be doing or hour to interact with customers.  Food: Fanfrickintastic. We started with Shrimp Amore and house Chianti. The Shrimp Amire had great flavor and the shrimp tasted fresh. We had the veal chop over risotto and it was very well prepared, served hot and had plenty of flavor. We also had the Pasta Amore (special). Full of scallops and shrimp. Portions are generous. Ended with Cappuccino. Service: We were seated immediately upon entering and this place was hopping.

So as you can imagine, people were crowded around our table waiting for drinks as the restaurant filled up. The wine selection is pretty good. Started off with the calamari, which was gross. My fiancé got penne a la vodka which he said tasted exclusively like canned mushrooms. I ordered cheese ravioli (safety) which was actually okay. For a cheaper bottle of wine, appetizer & two mediocre entrees, $100 seemed overpriced for a party of two. Maybe it's time to revamp, La Scarola.",0.8979,0.809,0.146,0.045,0.5668831168831169

2016-04-02,4.0,"4.5 stars. What a memorable night we had at La Scarola. So happy we got away from the conference to check out this highly recommended restaurant. Loved the grilled calamari!!! I wish they could make calamari this well everywhere. The Penne Alla Vodka was good too. Shrimp, mushrooms, asparagus & arugula in creamy vodka sauce. Not off the charts good, but points for creativity.  Entrees range from $15-$33 (veal is the only over $30 dish), so you can go cheap or splurge as you prefer. Not all of our party loved their dishes, so I'm rounding down. But they were also the kind of people who aren't into sharing dishes, so I can't say for sure. I have a suspicion they're wrong. ;-) Fast full bar. Yeah, we had tequila. I was impressed with the selection. Great service too. I'd go back anytime.",0.9805,0.681,0.244,0.075,0.732514619883041

2016-03-28,5.0,"Based on a friend's suggestion, my boyfriend and I dined here for date night and really enjoyed the experience! We made reservations for 7pm on a Saturday evening and though the restaurant was packed when we arrived, our table was ready and waiting for us in the back. La Scarola is what I would consider a no-frills, to-the-point Italian restaurant, with its cozy seating, walls lined with framed photos and straightforward chairs and tables. I get the impression most people come here for the excellent food and not the décor. Nevertheless, upon entering, you immediately know you've entered a true establishment; one that's been around for quite a while. We were immediately greeted by friendly servers upon being seated and in no time, we were enjoying a bottle of red wine. Before even arriving, my boyfriend checked out their menu and was very, very excited to try one dish on their appetizer menu: the Sausage and Peppers: Mild or hot sautéed green red pepper served over grilled Italian sausage. We did not go wrong here. The sausage was incredible and the peppers really balanced out the dish with a fresh crisp.  For our mains, my boyfriend had the Veal Chop alla Gabe: 10 oz. Veal chop pounded paper thin, breaded and pan fried finished with garlic, parsley, lemon and extra virgin olive oil and set over diced Italian potatoes. I overheard another server describe this as the best veal dish on their menu, so if you're going in that route, definitely check this one out! Based on my server's recommendation, I picked the Penne alla Vodka: Shrimp, mushrooms, asparagus & arugula in creamy vodka sauce, tossed with penne pasta. Talk about incredible! The shrimp in this dish were huge, fresh, and succulent, while the mushrooms were also bursting with a fresh flavor. The vodka sauce was perfect; the flavors were phenomenal. I couldn't get enough of this dish and I kept eating and eating even after I was full because it was just that good. They give you so much food here we didn't have room for dessert, and we walked away with leftovers for the next day. I highly recommend this restaurant.

2016-02-14,5.0,"I'm going to start this review by saying that La Scarola was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Chicago and, in fact, anywhere.  I'm also going to say that any reviews for this place that were less than 5 stars because it was ""too crowded,"" or ""too noisy,"" or because there was ""no where to wait"" for your table should be tossed out the window. I'm sorry, but if you go to an Italian restaurant and you give it 2 stars because you had a headache going in to it and you decided to go at peak time on a Saturday night when it's obviously going to be busy and loud, that's your own fault that your headache got worse, not the restaurants. Obviously if you know enough about Yelp to leave a review afterwards, you know enough to check the reviews beforehand and get an idea of what you're in for, and the restaurant (especially one as incredible as this one) shouldn't be faulted for your own ineptitude.  That being said, YES, La Scarola is about as authentic of an Italian restaurant you'll find anywhere in the city and it's amazing in every way.  The walls are covered with photographs, underneath which are the classic wall murals that highlight scenes from a Tuscan countryside. The restaurant is made up of several rooms, all of which are packed with tables so that you feel like you're eating in someone's house with all of their extended family and friends.  So is it noisy? Yeah, obviously.  Is it so noisy you can't hear the person across from you? Absolutely not. But if you're expecting a tranquil, white tablecloth, candlelit dinner, you should probably make reservations elsewhere.  But if authenticity and delicious food is your thing, keep reading. So we had a reservation for 9:00 the Saturday night before Valentine's Day, which obviously is a busy restaurant night. Having read some reviews that said they are notoriously late with reservations, I called ahead to see if they were running on time (what a concept!)  They were only running about 10 minutes late, so we headed straight to the restaurant. As soon as we arrived I could see why people said there was little room for waiting, but again, this isn't the restaurants fault---The Dawson, Emmitt's Pub, and Richard's Bar are all literally RIGHT next door to the place, so if you need somewhere to wait you have plenty of options. Since we only had a few minutes, we ponied up to the tiny bar and ordered a beer until our table was ready and it was perfectly fine. On to the food: AMAZING. Even if this doesn't sound like your kind of place atmosphere-wise, you should still come for the food!!!!! Holy crap.  I don't often rave over taste because I feel that aside from the stand outs, lots of things tend to taste generally the same, but this place is one of the stand outs!!  I woke up this morning unsure of how I could possibly wait until an appropriate ""lunch time"" to eat my leftovers. Writing this review is part of how I'm distracting myself!  So, my advice: starve yourself before you go here. Seriously. You want to be able to consume as much as possible, and that's exactly what we did. We started off by ordering the sausage and peppers---INCREDIBLE. And I don't usually like Italian sausage, but my fiance does so we ordered it and I was hooked!!!!  We also got grilled calamari which was insanely fresh, steak-like and not at all ""rubbery"" as it almost always is. The bruschetta was fantastic too!! After our healthy order of apps, we ordered entrees. I had read rave reviews about the penne a la vodka, but I was also super interested in one of their specials which was the Penne Amore and included a lot more seafood (scallops, lobster tail, shrimp).  I explained my predicament to the waiter and he immediately suggested that I combine the two and customized my order no problem. And there are no words for what came out of the kitchen 20 minutes later....pure magic.  One of the best vodka sauces I've ever tasted, and the freshest seafood you'll get anywhere that is not immediately on an oceanic coast. WOW. Wow wow wow. I had dreams about it last night. I'm dreaming about it now!! I'm salivating just thinking about my leftovers in the refrigerator. Especially the scallops...they were so tender, they just absorbed the vodka sauce so they became little vodka sauce bombs that exploded with flavor on each bite!!! Incredible. Okay, this is now officially the longest review I've ever written, so I'm going to wrap it up by adding that the cherry on the top of the La Scarola sundae was the staff---very friendly and attentive without going over the top, or interrupting your meal every 10 minutes to see if you need anything.

We stood there waiting until almost 9pm. Everyone was starving at that point and we had to eat bar food somewhere else. The owner gave us a free round of drinks but that is not enough compensation for ruining my birthday night.

Plus, it's nearly impossible for the servers to get through the restaurant themselves at times because it's so crowded.  When I say crowded, I mean people are literally packed in, standing, lining up wherever they can waiting.

The place is extremely small and lacks any character or class whatsoever.  They were so busy that the service was a joke. We had a reservation and still had to wait a half hour before being crammed into a 2 top corner table for the 4 of us. No attention or effort was made by anyone to make it a nice dining experience. They crammed you in and tried to rush you right back out. I've seen closets larger and cleaner than this place.  The food was good, large portions and extremely fresh, but if you're looking for a full dining experience this isn't the place. If your looking for some good take out then this is your spot.  Not the best way to spend a Saturday night out in Chicago. Thank god Emits Pub (Ocean's Eleven) was right around the corner. That way the entire evening wasn't a bust.

This place seems like a hole in the wall type of classic grandma's Italian restaurant, composed of several smaller rooms, lined with photo's of the owner and somewhat famous patrons and painted wall murals.  It's not the most classy or romantic place, but it does have an authentic homemade feel. I really didn't know what to expect out of the menu as I typically don't go for places like this, but it wasn't my day to choose so I wanted to make the best out of it.  We ordered a bottle of Santa Margarita for our wine from their small but pretty decent wine list. My bf got the fried calamari app and I got the pasta and fagiole soup.  I don't eat seafood, but he really enjoyed his starter and said it came with a weird sort of bbq dipping sauce.  Surprisingly, I also really enjoyed my soup and though the portion was large.  As for entrees, he got the scallop pasta which was one of the many special.  It came in a tomato sauce that he said was very fresh.  I on the other hand, being a picky eater, decided to completely customize my order, choosing the shrimp penne in vodka, only with no shrimp and gnocchi instead of penne.  Yes, I understand that I completely changed everything in the entree name, but the waiter was more than happy to allow me to have my way. When the entrees came out, they were steaming hot and absolutely MASSIVE. Although it was very good, I don't think I even managed to eat 1/3rd of it but was more than happy to have leftovers for like the next two days.  We also ordered two expresso and a tiramisu to split.  All in all, pretty decent dinner, lots of good food, and not too pricey.",0.9974,0.781,0.193,0.026,0.5857500000000001

They knew when to leave the table and when to interject, offering their recommendations when asked. They are known for their Pasta Fagioli Soup, which is almost a meal in itself.

The restaurant is teeny tiny, emphasized by the tables crammed together or angled into odd corners.  White paper covers the tables, but the banquet chairs are hideous.  All of this could have been overlooked IF La Scarola served great food. A lot of reviews noted the bread wasn't fresh from the oven.  We had the same experience.  Although, bread is bread in some cases, and we enjoyed dipping it in the olive oil and parmesan cheese on the table. The wine list is simple, so I had a Pinot Grigio. The menu is huge, and all of the dishes delivered to our table looked incredible.  I tried some of Dominic P's pasta with spicy marinara.  It was really tasty and a good, simple dish.  My parents were happy with their ravioli and lasagna as well. I had the vodka pasta with shrimp and asparagus.  The shrimp were plump and plenty, but the sauce was terrible.  It was creamy, but flavorless.  I didn't eat much of my entree, took the leftovers to go, but ended up tossing the rest. Perhaps I just ordered the ""wrong thing,"" but considering that I ordered the most expensive entree in our group and didn't like it isn't a good thing. Service is crap.  The servers were all bustling around, and didn't even move out of our way when we tried to go to the bathroom.  There is no attentiveness.  The bathroom was pathetic and in desperate need of a fresh coat of paint. Hey, at least we found free street parking.  Give it a shot before you pay for valet.

In terms of the food. My boyfriend had the steak and he said it was good, but a little overdone. I and the Salmon Mondellini and it was very good but didn't have enough risotto in my opinion. The wine selection was fantastic. We had 3 bottles and they were great and reasonably priced.  The ambiance was crowded and vey loud. Not a good spot for wanting to actually have a conversation.

We ordered the grilled octopus to start which was divine. We got the big rigatoni special and the spaghetti and meatballs to share.  Both were amazing.

(who I noticed wrote her own review)a new entree because the cheese ravioli looked unappealing to the palette.  Well, needless to say, that time was the last visit to LaScarola.  I have been treated like crap the past two visits.  I will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Italian food.  There are plenty of restaurants in the city that treat their patrons well and have good food.  I doubt my review will hurt their business but if you aren't the who's who in their books, you might not be given the respect you deserve.",0.9515,0.849,0.105,0.046,0.5002976190476192

The decor, at least where we were sitting was sort of a cross between neighborhood restaurant (pictures of customers from over the years) and teenage boys' room (boob posters, a transformer head which was super cool and actually from the movie), etc. Just a total, wonderful trip.",0.9843,0.749,0.196,0.054,0.5831232492997199

2014-10-20,3.0,"This one took some thought and I hated to give it only 3 stars and after reading my review, you'll see it is a love / hate situation. After reading tons of reviews from tons of Italian eateries, we were pretty sure this was the place to go while staying in the near west side. Made a reservation for a Sunday night at 7:00 pm and got there right at 7:00 Place is packed and noisy and was told to wait by the bar which is small and standing room only.  Surprisingly we were seated within like two minutes. Our waiter started out great....... Don't know his name , but he looked like and reminded me of Tommy Chong from Cheech & Chong. Ordered drinks and the grilled callamari app that everyone raves about.  Drinks were good and the callimari had great flavor  and chared nicely, but pretty  damn tough and rubbery ..........just grilled a little too long.  Nice serving size and good flavor as I said though. The crusty bread and oil at the table could have been really good, but the bread was ice cold like it was not done thawing. I would think it would at least be at room temp in a high turnover place like this but WTF???  Our waiter brought our meals in a normal timely manner and I had asked for the Pasta Sinatra which was not on the menu, but they obliged even though they were out of scallops. OK, they would just throw in more shrimp or mussels.  My wife had Chilean Sea Bass.   My pasta was to die for and the mussels were the true gems in this dish. They were perfect, and I am a mussel finnadict. Great sauce, aldente pasta, and a pile of it. Highly recommend it.  My wifes Sea Bass was a very nice portion of fish on a bed of sauted spinach with a brothy light sauce. Let me tell you that this Sea Bass was Buttery,  melt in your mouth, rich and delicate at the same time, 2nd best  fish I ever tasted in my life!!! If you are a fish lover get it, you won't forget it. So, now your wondering why only 3 stars when the food is so good. Well, after our meal was delivered ( actually thrown on our table without a word) from "" Tommy"" our waiter, we never as much got a Hi, Good bye, or kiss my ass from him. Don't know if he was pissed we didn't order wine or what. The party of two, 8 inches from our table that did order wine was getting the full treatment from him. The table of 4 on the other side that shared 2 entrees between 4 people , got the royal treatment with complimentary birthday canolli and singing while Tommy buried his ass in my wifes face to take their picture.  Shortly after , he tossed the check on the table, and I reluctantly left him a 15% tip.  Still kickin myself in the ass for doing that!!! I know this place has great food, but when I drop $100.00 or better for 2 people, I expect a little better. Staring at a dirty dusty curtain covering an old door,  and cobwebs with dusty crooked pictures hanging on the wall and a waiter that doesn't have the courtesy  to say Thank You or Fuck Off  rubs me  the wrong way and really ruins a great dinner.   I understand the charm of this place and it has some good history and has some old celebs on the wall. I still wouldn't want to see it with the lights on bright.  It is what it is, a small packed, loud old Italian joint, and they don't advertise it any different on their website.  I can overlook the little piddly stuff like cobwebs and cold bread and even medeocre food when the service is good,  but this wasn't the case. Great food and shitty service don't get 5 stars from me. I'll probably have to go back next time in town and try another great dish, but WILL have a different waiter next time. Still don't know what the deal was???  Hope you understand my love/ hate rating and hope you have a better experience than we did.    BTW................Your Welcome Tommy!!!

I have coworkers that have told me AMAZING things about this place, so we decided to have it here.  It was a nightmare from the beginning. We kept getting the run around for just inquiring about if they could accommodate 30 people. They gave us a number to keep in contact ( this could have been an honest mistake, unsure) and wouldn't give us a clear answer. Finally, they say they'll give us the back room, or a portion of it. So the night is upon us, I pull up with my girlfriend and we see a group of 25 kids outside. It was a few minutes past our reservation time, so we thought they were cleaning/setting up. We find out that they won't seat for nearly another hour...well past our reservation time, and after the birthday girl is supposed to show up for her surprise. We walked in to explain what was going on and there was shorter male, gray hair, that walked up to us and asked us what was going on. Unapologetically, just said, it didn't matter when our reservation was, and that it will take that long. Completely dismissive of us. I get that things happen, this was just unprofessional, curt, and completely apathetic to our situation.  In the time it would have taken to get seated at LA scarola, we found a new place, drove there, and were seated.  Service at its absolute worst at this place. It's a shame they have that guy working, he seems to be the cause for a fair amount of bad reviews.

2014-10-05,1.0,"Last month some friends came into town from Winfield, Il. We called La Scarola to make reservations after getting amazing reviews from a neighbor in our building. When I called it was about 3:30pm, they said they didn't have anymore reservations. I asked if we just walked in, was there a big wait time & if we could still be taken care of.. The person on the phone said that there was not wait time and we would be able to just walk in.. After picking up out friends at the train station, we headed to La Scarola, by this time it was 4pm. After parking and paying $6 for the meter, we walked in and we were received by a lineup of waiters. We thought, ""this is great"", well that greatness shortly turned into a sour experience. When we said we needed a table for 4 they asked if we had reservations, we said no & went on to explain the situation over the phone. The Place probably had 75% of the place empty. This short Hispanic individual fast approached us and asked the same thing the waiters did. My husband also being short & hispanic( didn't mean to sound racist as I too am Hispanic) tried to explain to him the situation and this guy said he could not take us and slapped my husband very hard on the shoulder! Just because we are Hispanic doesn't mean you can automatically treat me like your ""boy"".. We do not know you and we are consumers trying to get service!! This guy apparently who I spoke to initially on the phone went to slap my husband again for the second time! My husband had to tell him ""please do not touch me again!""  As we were shood out of the door as we were pieces of hoodlums.. The food might be greatly reviewed, but do to this very upsetting incident and my husband getting whacked 2 times in the shoulder, we will never step foot in this establishment!!!

When we finally sat down, they offered us three free appetizers to make up for the mess of a dinner reservation. We had the bruschetta, fried zucchini and grilled calamari. I'd read such great things on here about the calamari, I was quite disappointed when ours was overcooked (this is where I deducted the fifth star). After delicious bread and appetizers our main dishes came out right away. The pasta dishes are huge. I can't imagine a grown man finishing a whole plate. They had a wide range of pricing-something for everyone. I was able to get 3 more meals out of my leftovers so you definitely get your money's worth.

I can personally vouch for the Chicken Vesuvio. It's excellent. The waitstaff are always pleasent and the owner himself has actually come and greeted us at the table and made sure we were enjoying ourselves.  The restaurant does have very limited space though. And it can get pretty crowded and loud. I tend to like quiet places but I cannot deduct any points for this as it is really just a matter of personal preference.

For our entrees I had the Linguini and Clams with white sauce and she had the Sea Bass special.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious.  I'm not even going to bother describing them.  Wouldn't do any justice.

2014-08-19,4.0,"As far as Italian food goes, I can't say I have had much that was better than La Scarola. The walk in to the restaurant is a little intimidating- packed with people, cramped space, and you feel like everyone is looking at you as you walk by.  We had an 8pm reservation, and they had the appropriate sized table ready for us when we got there. We loved looking at all the pictures on the wall of famous, and not famous people who came to the restaurant. There was such a sense of pride in their restaurant. It definitely gave off that Italian family, old school vibe.  Waters arrived quickly, as did someone to take drink orders. Beer selection is limited, but there was a nice wine selection. Large baskets of crusty Italian bread then arrived, which was good, but not hot out of the oven like I've experienced elsewhere. For apps, we tried the mussels, grilled and fried calamari, and the shrimp armani. I'd never had mussels before, and they were good, nothing I would think to order again, but my table deemed them the best mussels they'd ever had. The shrimp armani was so fantastic- huge shrimp over delectable mashed potatoes in a red sauce... mmmmmmm.... and the fried calamari was the best I'd ever had too! I did not try the grilled-- looked ""too real"" for me. My table said it was good, albeit a little too chewy. For the main course, I stuck with bowtie pasta with meatballs. A giant portion was given with 3 garlicky, perfect meatballs. It totaled up to 3 meals over a few days for me! Everyone else loved their dinners too, and everyone left with extras. Prices were very reasonable for what you got. The owner took time to speak to everyone there. He seemed to have some favorites who were given free shots, but alas, that was not us.  Overall, it was a truly different but amazing Italian dining experience. I would go back in a heartbeat.

My daughter graduated from kindergarten and wanted to celebrate like an adult and go to a restaurant in the city. My wife searched for an Italian restaurant as my daughter requested also. So this restaurant claims family friendly with $$, and so we decided on it. Our waiter lacks customer service skills. I have been in the restaurant business for over 20 years.  First we ordered calamari, it was very good. Then my wife ordered the pollo alla joe, light red sauce chicken with potatoes and veggies, also tasty. I ordered the risotto de pollo and didn't enjoy it at all, too starchy! Is it suppose to be so clumpy? My wife orders for my picky daughter, plain spaghetti with a side of chicken and side of broccoli. Her plate cost $26 !!!! That waiter should of known better. Suggest a dinner or serve something small for a child. Her plate was more expensive then either of ours. He didn't check on us during the meal. The other servers were more attentive then our own.  I calmly brought up my issues with the check once the bill was brought. His response was the owner left already, he can't do anything about it.

We went with a variety of starters, fried zucchini, grilled octopus & calimari, bruschetta, etc.  Love the hand written specials and it wasn't long before we were presented with our apps.  The grilled octopus was amazing.  Very tender, perfectly done with a smokey flavor.  If I had a straw, I would have finished off the juices left on the platter. On to the main course... My peeps went with a variety of dishes.  The sea bass got rave reviews as did the risotto special.  I chose the Vitello di Franco.  What a great dish.  Lightly breaded, thin pounded veal accompanied by asparagus, diced tomatoes and a thin layer of melted multi cheese mix.  Wonderful, slightly salty flavors, lovely texture from the veggies and a portion size that would make a glutton blush. The service was outstanding.  Our server was knowledgable and attentive.  The fact that our dinners arrived simultaneously from a relatively small kitchen was impressive.

It always disappoints me when an italian restaurant or any restaurant for that matter doesn't serve bread fresh out of the oven. The bread was pretty soft though even though it wasn't hand warming fresh. We started with the clams mondeli which are baked clams with breadcrumb mix on top. These were delicious. A good breadcrumb to clam ratio and the clam was cooked just right. I had the special pasta sinatra. It was penne with vodka sauce, mussels, shrimp, scallops and mushrooms.  The seafood was cooked perfectly! Not at all chewy , rubbery it was perfecto! The sauce was very creamy and well adhered to the penne. There was not a pool of left over sauce that I can swipe my penne over but the amount of sauce was sufficient enough. If you see this dish on the menu, I highly recommend it. The portions were enough for us to take home and probably make another meal out of it.

That's not unexpected for a very popular restaurant, but the food was the real disappointment. People say that Americans care more about quantity than quality when it comes to food, but La Scarola takes that motto to the extreme. I ordered the gnocchi del giorno and received a plate piled high with about 4 times as much food as one could reasonably be expected to eat in a single sitting. That wouldn't be so bad, because I'm all for bringing home leftovers, but this gnocchi wasn't even good to begin with. The sauce was way too garlicky, and the Italian sausage tasted and looked like the stuff you buy in the freezer section at Jewel. After a few bites of my leftovers the next day, I was just as much disappointed as before, so I decided to consign the rest to the trash bin and write this review. Frankly, there are much better Italian restaurants in Chicago that actually serve good, authentic Italian, and since I prefer to pay for quality over quantity, I don't foresee being back to La Scarola.",-0.7011,0.796,0.093,0.111,0.45012380952380954

My husband always prefers something a little spicy and has enjoyed the plentiful Pasta Lorenzo many times.  The antipasti was fresh and the grilled octopus is ALWAYS tender.

If I had been eating in the restaurant I would have sent the food back, but we got delivery.  I have never been more disappointed in a meal-- had it been half the cost I would understand but if you are going to price a pasta at $15, it had better taste like it.  Super boring pasta for inflated prices.",0.9503,0.782,0.17,0.047,0.4601190476190476
2014-01-02,1.0,"I dined at La Scarola last night with my boyfriend for a romantic date night and we were both highly disappointed.  We had a great greeting which turned south quickly.  The waiter (jack) kept coming by to see if we were ready to order (3 times in the first 5 minutes)..this was only the beginning of feeling rushed.  We ordered a bottle of wine and after every other sip, he would come over to refill our glasses which became really annoying, very quickly and rushed us through our bottle of wine.  As soon as we were done eating he was rushing to get us our check and boxes.  As we stood up to put our coats on, he wedged in between us to clear off our table and we hadn't even put our coats on.  If it were a Friday or Saturday night and there was a line of patrons out the door, I understand...but for it to be a Sunday night where there were empty tables and for our romantic dinner to push us in and out of the restaurant in under an hour--not so romantic. We were torn between going to La Scarola, Prosecco, Scoozi or Piccolo Sogno and we decided to go to La Scarola because our last experience there wasn't the best, so we decided to give it one last shot.  By the time we got in the cab, we looked at each other and both said we wished we had gone someplace else.  I don't think we will be re-visitng La Scarola for a very long time unfortunately.  I also emailed La Scarola to let them know about the experience two times prior to posting a bad review and I guess they just really don't care what their patrons think.",-0.3014,0.858,0.069,0.073,0.47513888888888883

2013-12-24,2.0,"I've been going here for almost ten years now and all the lousy things I mention in this review have happened before. Just never all at the same time. The point I am trying to make is that when you go to La Scarola, the basic attitude of the staff and, presumably, the management, is that, unless you are a celebrity whose picture can go on their wall, they are doing you a favor just to let you sit at a table. If you go in expecting something else, you will be disappointed. The food, while not authentic to any Italian region, is very good. And it's reasonably priced. I'm not exactly sure, but I think that's what keeps people coming back for the abuse. The food is why I gave it two stars instead of one.  Now, last night I went in there quite prepared for rude waiters, a very long wait well past my reservation time, cramped waiting space in a narrow corridor by the poorly located bar, an inscrutable and untrustworthy bill, etc. But this time I just didn't enjoy all that as much as I have in the past. Either I've lost my sense of adventure, or the gig has gotten tired, or things were even worse last night than usual. We had a reservation for 9 people for 7:15.  What's the point of making a reservation if you then have to wait, standing  being jostled in the hallway between the mens' room and the bar, for 45 minutes? To his credit, the manager noticed at some point that I was not looking happy and gave me a free shot of scotch. At this point, things were actually fine with me. I was unhappy not because of the restaurant, but because of some skating injuries; but I didn't turn down the drink. I'm not sure if what happened next was related to my free drink, but there erupted an argument between the bartender and the manager. The bartender seemed to say very little, the manager kept telling him not to play games with him, then the bartender took off his apron, changed his clothes and left the restaurant. Bizarre. At any rate, back to the things that make sense here. Eventually we were seated, which you think would have been a relief but that's when it got bad. We were not waited on for maybe ten minutes. All night long we were pretty much left alone like that. The waiter came, took our wine order. Said he couldn't find the wine we wanted and offered us a substitute. It was a mediocre Sicilian, which didn't excite anyone--Cusumano Nero D'Avola. We switched to a Chianti of his choice. This wine did not come for almost 20 minutes and then it was thin and acidic.  I don't know what it cost. Our orders were taken way too late. We had two children at the table and most decent restaurants would notice that and do something to make them happy in the event of a long wait. Nothing here. Appetizers: we ordered one of each calamari -- grilled and breaded -- we got two breaded. We sent one back with the runner but the replacement never came. When I checked with the waiter around the time main courses came, he said he had not been told of the mix-up and promised it would not be on the bill. I ordered an asparagus salad. Never saw it.  The food was fine. My portobello gnocchi was five-star; most people liked their food, except for the spaghetti and meat ball folks, which included the kids. When the bill came, it was not possible to tell what we had (and had not) been charged for. It was an old adding machine printout attached to an illegible hand-written check. Not all items were added in individually--some must have been combined. My father in law paid for it and he's a gentleman so didn't want to argue about a few ten-spots. But it's not unreasonable to make it possible for people to check the bill after so much confusion. . I dare anyone to say that most of this stuff isn't par for the course at La Scarola. Maybe it's time for me to stop going there since, for the time being, the restaurant seems to work well-enough with this system. Or maybe it's time for La Scarola to take a really good look in the mirror. My feeling last night was that the staff were out of control and lost in the fantasy that this place is better than its customers.

Van Halen, The cast of ""Lost in Space"", Grandpa Munster, Brietbart, Chaz Palminteri, and my in-laws from Italy, have all feasted here with me. Every single person has loved it ! It's the best Itallian Resturant in North America! Period. Michael Bay left a Transformers robot head on the bar... It's STILL there. Ha! This ain't no Olive Garden lame. It isn't a  Spiaggia fancy overpriced ripoff joint. This is what Italians would make you if you visited their homes in the countryside in Italy and they loved you. Joey (the owner) was Sinatra's favorite cook. Now every goomba hack wannabe in Chicago claims they knew Mr. Sinatra- Joey REALLY did. And he's cooked for Pacino, Louis Prima, Deniro, Bill Murray, and and and and everybody. Joey's salad (and if he's not there don't bother) is the only salad I'll eat.  Owner Joey Mondelli ? The real deal. A vanishing breed. A man of great character and a character.  His partner Armando? Maybe the single most lovable person on Earth! His laugh is infectious! Ask him if it's his birthday (because Mancow said so) and see if he brings over a couple of shots of tequila. His laugh is the most infectiously odd chortle ever. What a special guy. ""The Shrimp Armani"" may be the single greatest dish at any Resturant in Chicago. ""The Polo ala Mancow"" is my combo dish featuring all the ingredients I love from their pantry. Warning: it packs a Wallop!  Friday or Saturday nights you probably won't get in. I've seen people show up and get angry about that. Small + popular + great = PACKED. Duh!  Make a reservation but don't show up and be angry if they can't immediately seat you. The place is noisy and fun like a big Itallian family gathering. Sorry hipsters if you are too cool to LIVE. Go pose elsewhere. All those other fancy restaurants? This is where Chefs Grant Achatz ,Trotter, Bayless, Tramanto, and all the other greats come to chow down when they get a rare night off. I could go on endlessly.  Advice?  Show up and say hello to Joey or Armando. Ask for them. They LOVE people. (How many of us really honestly love people?) These guys will be new friends. ""Hey, I don't want any new friends"" is an attitude I sadly understand. I've told many people to ""MAKE SURE YOU SAY 'HI' TO JOEY OR ARMANDO""and they don't. Why? Shy. Awkward. Chicken. It boggles my mind why anyone would miss out on the free treasure that is found by being around these exceptional individuals. God was working overtime when he created their souls. Sit and breath it all in. My Heaven will be like this.  Rub elbows with Ken Nordine, Walter Jacobson, Artie from Jam, Billy Dec, Chef Bannos, John Wayne Gacys lawyer Karen Conti, media critic Robert Feder, Tommy Lasorda, Fox anchor woman Robin Robinson, and many other Chicagoans of note while there. This is all in one night! It's  the Raos or Toots Shor's of Chicago. The prices are silly. How do they stay open? It's because their costumers are their family. A labor of love. Can you imagine that in this era?  It is almost unfathomable really. The deserts ? Cannoli and tiramisu outstanding. The rest you can skip. If you are going for the first time I admire you. What I wouldn't give to experience La Scarola for the first time again. It'd be like seeing ""Die Hard"" or making love to my virginal wife for the first time again. Beautiful. You can't get first back again so heed my advice and start by introducing yourself to Joey or Armando and then.... fall in love like you've never done before with any other Resturant.

My friend called to make a reservation for Saturday at 7pm (spoke with a human being, this wasn't a voicemail).  We got there about five minutes late. The place was pretty unimpressive from the front, but we were willing to be proven wrong. We were immediately greeted once in the door, and when we told the guy we had a reservation he pointed to the adjoining room and told us to speak with the bartender. Okaaaaay. So we did that. The bartender shrugged and went back to mixing drinks. He offered us a drink and when we declined (we had a reservation and just wanted to be seated first) went back to his drinks.  Nobody else spoke to us, nobody said anything about clearing a table or any other reason for a delay. Interestingly, neither individual asked for the name on the reservation.

2013-05-26,1.0,"My boyfriend and I made a reservation for 8pm on a Sunday night. We'd done our research and knew we might have to wait a few minutes, but figured it would be worth it. When we arrived we were rudely told to go wait in the bar next door and someone would come and get us when our table was ready. They were running 10-15 minutes behind, but it might be sooner, we were informed.  We gamely walked to the dive bar next door (Richard's) and sat down to wait. I didn't order a drink because I thought we'd be seated in a matter of minutes. I realized quickly that the bar allows smoking inside and I knew my allergies would kick in soon. We waited in the bar for a little over 20 minutes (with no one from La Scarola coming to get us OR anyone else) before we finally broke down and went to wait outside.  After 35 minutes of waiting, my boyfriend finally went in to check on our reservation. We were told it would be 2 more minutes. So we moved to stand directly in front of the glass door, basically staring down the manager (or host, or whoever he is). Almost 15 minutes after that, we were finally motioned inside and seated.  By the time we sat, I was livid AND starving. If I'd known we would have to wait 45 minutes (mostly outside) to be seated, we would have left immediately upon arrival and chosen a different Italian restaurant.  Our table was directly in front of the bar (and the bar TV), which wasn't ideal, but we didn't think it would be a problem. At the very least, I thought to myself, the food will be worth it.  We ordered drinks, then the grilled calamari and pasta fagioli soup to start. Our waiter brought bread and we both dove for it since we were starving. It was dry, just short of stale, and I could find better bread at any grocery store.  Before our calamari arrived, the manager brought shots of tequila to the table with a quick, mumbled, insincere ""sorry for the wait."" I hate tequila, I don't do shots, and I would have preferred an actual apology, but I did the shot (as did the manager--not very professional--if he does one for every late seating, he must be drunk by 7pm) and decided I'd try to enjoy the rest of the experience.  Then the calamari arrived. The flavor was good, but it was so overcooked that it was tough and rubbery. I took one bite and refused to eat it. We didn't send it back because I was tired of complaining and getting nowhere.  The pasta fagioli soup was really good.  And our entrees were really good, too. The boyfriend had the pasta vesuvio, which was flavorful and well-balanced. I had a pasta from the specials menu (which I can't for the life of me remember the name of now) which included spinach, garlic, tomatoes, and goat cheese. It was fantastic. We had tiramisu for dessert and it was decent, but I've had better. I've MADE better. The thing that really drove us crazy (and the final nail in the coffin) was the bar area itself. There were obnoxious 10 year old boys hanging out who wanted to watch a basketball game and waiters who wanted to watch a soccer game. The battle of the remote was so annoying, I wanted to walk the kids back to their table so their parents could deal with them and then go back and tell the waiters to stop watching TV and do their jobs.  If this review was only about the food, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars. But it's about the restaurant and the experience and ours was really horrible. In no way was it worth the wait or our final bill. I left disappointed and apologizing to my boyfriend for suggesting La Scarola over every other Italian restaurant in the city.  I'd never recommend it to a friend and couldn't, in good conscience, not give fair warning to other Yelpers. You have been warned.",-0.9899,0.804,0.073,0.123,0.484095238095238

The menu was full of delicious sounding options all at very reasonable prices. We all ordered different things, and each was divine. The wine selection was also vast and reasonable.  Because it was Mothers Day, my mom decided to splurge and have a desert. She chose a chocolate mouse cake.

Celebrity photos line the walls - I saw a signed photo of Bette Davis on my last visit. It's old school Italian at its finest - attentive waiters in starched white shirts and handwritten specials inserted in the menu.  I was waiting with my daughter in the winter vestibule as several couples were exiting on our last visit. The maître d' asked how everything was & each group either used amazing religious or sexual experiences as their basis for comparison! Seriously, not kidding! I've ordered the same thing twice now because it was so good I couldn't help myself - Vitella di Franco which is veal scallopini, asparagus, garlic, tomatoes, arugula and provolone, served with a side of risotto. I've heard Martha Stewart tout the virtues of risotto for years and never understood what it could be until I tasted La Scarola's. Creamy, melt in your mouth delightfulness is what it is! The veal can be easily cut with a fork and is seasoned to perfection. My daughter ordered one of their hand written specials of cheese stuffed meatballs. Flavorful, gooey and delish! Portion sizes are enormous and when you ask them to box what you can't possibly eat in one sitting, don't be surprised if your waiter asks with deep concern if everything was ok just to make sure you liked what you had and only left the remainder because you were worried you'd explode.

2013-05-01,5.0,"The location and venue itself are situated in an area that was once largely populated  by Italian immigrants from back in the day.  Upon entering 'La Scarola,' you are hit in the face with this backdoor-NYC-Little Italy-John-Gotti-Al-Capone nostalgia that overwhelms one's self in every sense in the way. It's loud, it's crowded, people are laughing, people are drinking wine, people are dressed up (and down), and still there is this quaintness and acceptance I can't get over. It's like walking into your own surprise party, except less awkward because you have no time to feel 'surprised.'  Look to the corner, ""oh there's a celebrity,"" to the other corner, ""there's another celebrity"". This was Wednesday night around 7:45pm without a reservation. We waited 4 mins, and were seated promptly. Did I mention it was my birthday?  Our waiter was nice older gentlemen who reminded me of this old Italian guy from back when I was growing up. This older guy would invite us over for desserts with wine and always welcomed us warmly into his home. This guy resurrected in the form of our waiter. At this point I'm thinking, ""Nostalgia overload."" Our food was a 30-35minute wait, with an appetizer in-between and lots of wine. Our glasses always tended to and never empty. I have never been so tended to the way I was on this day, and we were treated to a glass of wine, on the house.  For an appetizer, I had the grilled octopus in a balsamic dressing sauce with fresh squeezed lemon and romaine garnish. I soaked up every bit of that dressing with my bread and romaine. The octopus was heavenly and the texture was almost near tough, yet tender enough to eat and still get that char on the skin to let your senses know it was on the grill. I died. I know how difficult it is to cook octopus (former sous chef), and the expense. However, 12 bucks for an octopus sure as hell is a delicious deal.  My brother had the filet mignon vesuvio and it came on a bounty of orgasmic potato wedges soaked in that heavenly vesuvio sauce. Did I mention the filet was freaking amazing (don't eat red meat here!)!? I took a sliver off the edge and as it hit my mouth, my tastebuds jumped out and nearly finished my poor innnocent brother's dinner (took 3 of us to help him finish the entire plate with some to take home).  For my self, I had the Shrimp Diavolo pasta and holy freaking sweet mary and joseph, I didn't even get to the shrimps, but on my first bite of pasta and sauce, it tasted like the tomatoes took a bath in the ocean and were sprinkled with red pepper flakes. The noodles themselves had absorbed that very essence, and parmesan was not needed to mask the deliciousness of this sauce. The spicyness itself is something to accustom to, and drinking a riesling with it only intensifies the heat. When I took a bite of the shrimp, I died again. I was overwhelmed, and had it not been for the fact I was born with a stomach of iron, I would have definitely had leftovers. However, it would be a blasphemy to leave such an establishment with 'leftovers,' the food itself was too delicious for it to be subjected to 'to-go' containers.  I inhaled every bite, with my mouth on fire, and my tastebuds begging for cold cold water.  My mother had the chicken breast, which was overwhelmingly flavorful and hearty. That was my original choice, since I'm trying to avoid carbs and what-not, but got to munch on her to-go platter later on. The chicken was seasoned well with fresh herbs, and the veggies were cooked to the point of deliciously sweet, roasted, and tender. I was surprised that only cost 15 bucks. That plate itself is lunch for the next two days at the office.  Dessert was chocolate cake and tiramisu. The Tiramisu dignifies what delicious tiramisu tastes like. I give it an 8 out of 10. This was the second-best tiramisu I have tasted in my life, the first of course being Bruna's tiramisu in the Heart of Italy neighborhood. The chocolate cake however pretty much takes the cake in the dessert round. I give it a 9.8 out of 10. I leave the (.2) out of it to give another restaurant the chance to prove me wrong and say that is the second-best chocolate cake I have ever had. For now though, THIS IS the best chocolate cake I have had. If you've been to Bittersweet bakery on Belmont, the chocolate cake is a contender, except at La Scarola, it's lighter, more savory, and packs that mocha-ish punch I love. Starbucks eat your heart out. I could take three of these cakes and throw them into a blender with ice and survive off that blended cake-drink for the rest of my life.  La Scarola, I thought your were a dud until I walked in. I thought I was going to a quiet, low-key restaurant where the food is expensive and service mediocre at-best. You really did take the cake, and MADE ME like you. Which is something very few places can do. Thanks for the awesome birthday and awesome celebrity sightings.

2013-04-17,5.0,"I go back and forth between 4.5 - 5 stars, so I rounded up.  I've been back so many times, and I would have to say this is probably one of my favorite Italian spots in the city.  It's no frills, completely tacky with photos all over the place and not a place to come for a romantic dinner, but for a great meal with friends. It can get pretty noisy so don't expect to be having deep, meaningful conversations over dinner here. Helpful tips: -Make a reservation and also give yourself about a 30-45 minute window after that reservation to be seated on weekend nights.  If you want to be seated by 8pm on a Saturday, consider a 7:30pm reservation.  The fact is that this place is popular and usually packed.  However, they are nice about giving away some free items (ie: shots) and there is a bar right next door that you can go to while waiting.  Also, stop back every 10 minutes or so with the host to check-in again and see if a table is ready. - Try anything that you like and also a few of their recommendations.  I have yet to find a dish here that I did not like. Some highlights on the pretty amazing food I've had: Appetizers: Grilled calamari, grilled octopus, sausage and peppers (although this is probably more used as a side for us) Entrees: Chicken Vesuvio, either of the Veal Chops, and any of the fish.  The portion sizes on these are huge. I think I remember ordering the White Fish and it took up my entire long plate. Pastas: Eggplant Parmesan, Capellini Fra Diavolo, Penne alla Vodka and Pasta Lorenzo. Dessert: Tiramisu!  I know you will probably be stuffed with all the food, but try and find some room for this.  Delicious! Service was great and spot on.  One time we went, my boyfriend's iPhone was around 5% and they charged it for him.  Our server came back to check on us several times and make sure we were enjoying our meals and having a good time.  Had I completed this review after my first visit, I would have probably given 4 stars.

2013-04-05,4.0,"Came here for an Italian dinner with coworkers. Let me tell you, the service is top notch! We were started off with some fresh bread and high quality olive oil while we waited for the Fried Calamari. Found the portion to be a bit on the small side, but the waiter brought us lots of tomato sauce when requested, as we did not feel like going for the seafood sauce provided. For dinner, a few ordered sausage with shrimp, meatballs, etc. I know, because my entree came out nearly 10 minutes after everyone else! Luckily, my table shared with me so I did not have to suffer. However, when the Vitello Di Franco (breaded veal scallopini, fried in olive oil, finished in oven with asparagus, garlic, tomatoes, arugula and roasted imported provolone, served with a side of risotto) came out, it was phenomenal! It was weird that the side of risotto came out about 5 minutes after my entree. In either case, there was plenty of food left to become my breakfast the next day. The waiter was nice enough to provide us with 3 different deserts to share on the house due to my entree being so late coming out. We were quite happy with that, and I am sure the excellent wine we chose kept us in good spirits (no pun intended) as well. The waiter also gave us extra bread with dinner, upon request.

Filet mignon grilled and served with potatoes and vesuvio sauce) and a special of the night, Chilean Sea Bass (along with a huge bed of spinach and an increadible sauce) this is probably the best fish I've EVER tasted.

Dining together, sharing a laugh, being loud and slurping your spaghetti without worry that the person across the table form you is going to judge you!

Our table of 5 split the grilled octopus (amaze!!), eggplant (my personal favorite), peppers, pasta & fagiole soup (I love this and I am not the biggest fan of soup), fettuccine alfredo (extremely heavy but worth every bite you can muster), and the Chilean sea bass.  Notice the theme here....EVERYTHING is great! *Note - the Chilean sea bass at La Scarola is THE BEST. If I only could only eat one thing here, this would be it! Do yourself a favor a go try it. Rich, buttery, and melts in your mouth. Overall, despite, the noise ( loud Italians rule anyway lol), lack of seating, and wait time... it is all worth it for the fantastic food, wonderful service, and a fabulous eating  experience.

Armando is beyond attentive to his guests, and the waitstaff was incredible as well. Our waiter Bob was awesome. And the food was outstanding. We started with calamari, which had the most incredible cocktail sauce. I got the soft shell crab special, which was over spinach, mussels and tomatoes. I don't like spinach, but I literally was eating this like it was my job. So good. Boyfriend got the lasagna, and being part Italian he was ashamed to admit it was better than this grandmother's.

2012-08-21,4.0,"I came here and had a fantastic time!! And I don't know if I can truly say that about a restaurant experience I've had. It's not a perfect restaurant by far, but it DEFINITELY has character!!!  Here's why: We came on a Friday Night, so it was busy. We had reservations, came on time and ended up waiting much longer than that. The host/owner/busboy(?) did tell us several times to keep waiting. He also told us it was his birthday. Lol - apparently it's his birthday every night. When we finally sat down, the busboy/owner/host gave us a free shot of tequila. In fact, a lot of people who sat down after waiting got a free shot of tequila! We got a bunch of random stuff for free that night. Our server was pretty cool. Attentive and accommodating at some parts, and definitely ignored us to take care of other customers at others, but we were having a good enough time not to really care. The food was great! We tried the grilled calamari, the chicken vesuvio with pasta, and something else I can't remember, they were all good. Portions are pretty big!! We didn't have enough room in our stomachs to try the Tiramisu... :( I've heard friends go on weekdays and have OK experiences. This by far was just about the most hilarious dining experience I've ever had. Apparently, it's this owner/busboy/server's birthday every day, and he regularly gets customers free shots if they wait a long time. Also, if you're a regular or an insider, you get even better treatment. The bar next door probably makes a killing with all the people who wait to get into this restaurant. The layout is atypical and narrow. Apparently we got the worst seat in the house, but I don't think we really cared. It does get kind of loud, especially around their tiny little bar area (not a place where you can really wait and drink there, so check out the bar next door). This is one of those places that just has character. The food is good, the servers aren't pretentious at all, and it seems like everyone here is having a good time. I can't say it'll always be like this, but it's definitely worth the trip! TIPS: - Remind the host SEVERAL TIMES that you had reservations. That can sometimes help.Wish the host a happy birthday when you get a chance! That might help you more. - Try their Calamari. Grilled or fried. - Try their tiramisu. I wish we got to try it. I hear good things about it.  - If you wait, there is a bar next door!",0.9988,0.72,0.241,0.039,0.5461368878035545
2012-08-19,5.0,"Authentic Italian food at its best. I dined here Saturday night with my husband and my parents while they were in town. As soon as you walk in you know it's going to be good. The place is packed and you can tell they put all of the focus on the food. The decor probably hasn't been updated since the place opened but that was part of the charm.  The menu had great selection and a hand written specials menu a page long.  We started with some Tuscan wine, and as well as the fried calamari and fried zucchini. And I can't forget about those 2 pieces of bread I scarfed down drenched in high quality olive oil and parmesan cheese.  There were about 6 things I wanted but I finally settled on the veal special that was veal wrapped with prosciutto and mozzarella with Marsala wine sauce over angel hair. The veal was so tender and thin, it was heaven. The portions are absolutely huge. When the bus boy cleared my plate I heard the waiter ask him if I was getting a doggy bag. There was so much food leftover he wanted to make sure there wasn't something wrong with my dish. Rest assured, I wanted to consume every last bite of that food.  Service was spot on. All the servers are very Italian. Our server was fantastic - very attentive but not in your face so we could still carry on our conversation uninterrupted.  My only gripe was that the mushrooms in my Marsala were canned. I hate that. And if I'm being picky, I would have preferred the bread was warm when we got it but honestly everything else was so amazing it more than compensated for these minor setbacks. This certainly was not  enough to justify anything less than a 5 star rating.  I will be dreaming of this place until I go back.",0.996,0.796,0.189,0.014,0.5498054275473631
2012-08-19,4.0,"Oh man, you wanna talk about legit Italian restaurants?  Not your ""for show"", pretend Italian restaurants? This place is PURE!  Reminds me of a couple of my all time favorite places in NYC's little Italy. Places that I thought were incomparable.  Well saddle up boys, this place is almost that good. From the nondescript (some might say shady) exterior to the hustle and bustle inside, the moment you walk in, you know this is Italian. The kind where you hope you get a seat with your back against the brick wall, just in case. You can never be too cautious you know. The walls are full of a rogues gallery of chicagos finest(?).   Interesting pre dinner entertainment to try to guess the decade some of those were taken. The waiters all look like extras from the Sopranos in their white shirts, ties, and slicked back dark hair. Love that!! Attentive without being annoying. They know the drill. With the specials of the day on a full page, handwritten menu insert as a complement to their mainstay offerings, the selection is spectacular. We started with some good Tuscan wine and appetizers of calamari (terrific) and fried zucchini which, to my chagrin, did not come with marinara sauce. Wish it did cause that's how I like it. Entrees? Let's just say that this is not for those of you who want small plates - this is a place for big eaters. We ordered three dishes of various veal entrees and each was wonderful. The veal was so tender! The other dish was a shrimp and pasta arabiata sauce special which was amazing. My veal Marsala was excellent except that they used canned mushrooms. I don't like that. I want fresh mushrooms. The hit of the night was off their basic menu called Vitello I'd Franco with asparagus spears, tomatoes, garlic, and arugula  WOW! So tasty! Half a portion would have been plenty but the leftovers were almost as good. It came with a side of risotto which was creamy smooth and done to perfection. The standard pasta is angel hair and it was amazing.  This is a place you NEED to try. You'll thank me. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is those nasty canned mushrooms.

I had one of their specials and it was fantastic as well as everyone else in our group.  Everything there seemed to be great. My only heads up is to share a plate with someone.  The portions are huge, even for people with big appetites.  We had a group of 6 guys and not one ate 1/2 of their plate.  Just sayin.

2012-08-08,5.0,"Not shitting you, probably the best Italian restaurant in the city.  My mom used to work at an Italian eatery in Germany when I was a kid, and sometimes I'd go with her and hang out in the kitchen with Antonia, the round Italian cook who used to sharpen my colored pencils with her kitchen knives. The food here tastes like her food. It just.... tastes like genuine real love. Smothered in butter and olive oil. My first time here was with a sales rep, and when I found myself at the dreaded intersection of Grand, Halsted, and Milwaukee I was like ""WTF, Laura, where are you taking me."" Turns out she was taking me to a carb lover's heaven.  It's always crowded - good sign. The seating's a little tight and sometimes you could get sat at an awkward intersection of bar, kitchen, and server highway, but whatever. Knock back a couple glasses of wine and you won't even care.  It's no bones. Not real fancy, the carpet is probably 10 years old, it's dimly lit, there's paper on the tables, and the walls are covered PLASTERED with photographs of local celebrities dating back to ancient times. But seriously, it doesn't even matter.  So the food. I don't even remember what I got the first time, suffice it to say it's kept me thinking about this place for 4 years.  I do remember what I had yesterday. We got the bruschetta which was ridiculous. Super fresh, crazy delicious, crusty toasted bread, and dripping in olive oil. Not soaking, just dripping. Not garlicy enough to be awkward after, but just enough to know it's there. Then I had the eggplant parmigianna, which came with a side of pasta and marinara. The eggplant was cool. For some reason, it was the plain old pasta that had me OMFGing all over the place. I don't know where they get their spaghetti from, but can I get some for my house? If I could have just sat in the pot of pasta and ate until I died, I think I might have. Maybe it's better that I don't have any at my house. My friend has the cheese ravioli and had a similar reaction.  I would recommend this place 8 million times higher than the fancy place across the street. Maybe it's because Richard's is next door, but this just feels like the ""bullshit free - what we do is serve good food, and that's all we do"" zone.

2012-07-29,5.0,"I am so torn...I love the food here but I hate the attitude of the waiters!  Honestly I've never had a friendly waiter here. Maybe that is what the owner wants. He wants them to have a chip on there shoulder...maybe there all method acting for Godfather 4! So my review is purely based on the food!  The food is out of this world.  It is some of the best Italian you will find in the neighborhood and the line going out the door is the proof. I highly advise everyone to make a reservation.  Recently I had two friends over from out of town and they didn't want to drive anywhere, so we walked over to the restaurant.  I called ahead to make a reservation and I am glad I did because we grabbed the last table. Again it is 8:15pm on a Wednesday night and this place is slammed. Most neighborhood joints aren't this packed unless the food is phenomenal.  My buddies asked me what's good and I told them everything.  We finally settled on a few things and everything was amazing.  We had a veal that was covered in tomatoes, garlic, spinach and cheese and it was fantastic.  Every bite was so good.  It was also piping hot...the dish had to sit a few minutes to let it cool down.  That is how fresh it was when it hit the table.  We also ordered the penne pasta with chicken, sausage, red pepper flakes, zucchini, garlic, tomatoes and olive oil.  This dish was garden fresh.  It was so good and is similar to a dish I make at home.  It was nice to taste someone else's version and I also learned I need to add more garlic in my version.   We also ended the night on some spumoni, which is Italian ice cream.  The last time I had this was like 20 years ago at a wedding!!!  So it brought back many memories.  Let's go back to the attitude: my family once didn't get seated here because our child was with us.  The waiter went to seat us and an older gentleman started fighting with the waiter.  He pulled the waiter away from me and there heated debate continued. I even saw a few hands fly in the air...being Sicilian i knew that wasn't a hood sign for me! He finally walked up to me and said the wait would be an hour for a table. I was really not happy but didn't want to make a scene. I could see we were being discriminated against for having a child on a busy Friday Night. No parent is going to wait an hour for dinner with a hungry kid, so we left. We went next door to Emmit's and had a great dinner (plus no wait for a table). If La Scarola wants to let attitude get in the way of making money, then I'm fine spending my money elsewhere.  I also decided to call La Scarola from Emitt's two minutes after being denied a table and was able to get a table right away on the phone via a reservation. Funny and sad at the same time! Honestly it is all part of the attitude here and it proved my point we were discriminated against for having a kid on a Friday night!!! I wish there food was terrible so I could give them a one star review based off of attitude and bad food. But the food is really really good.   You've got me La Scarola!!!  Like an Italian Uncle I can't stand who is always giving me a hard time and pushing my buttons. We're family and that is why I keep coming back plus your food makes me happy!!! So call ahead and make reservations! Do not be surprised if there is a wait even with reservations! Check your pride at the door and get ready for some attitude! Your belly will be thanking you with all this yummy Italian food comforting you!!!",0.9959,0.79,0.142,0.067,0.4813785103785104
2012-07-19,5.0,"So i wrote a review on La Scarola a year or so ago, but didn't really invest the amount of time and passion this place deserves, so we are just going to do a ""do over"" after Monday night. First things first, I'm upset I cannot give this higher than 5 stars. Honest to god guys, i really know Italian food, it is truly an incredible passion of mine....that being said, this was hands down THE BEST DINNER I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Simply out of this world. Outside of traditional classics techniques all chef's use @ Italian restaurants, I just heard that Armando uses chipolte and jalapenos in sauces to give them that extra kick. After hearing this, it totally makes sense and is just another great example of how little creative tweaks between cultures can result in wonderful meals. Lets go to a list format for the breakdown..... 1.)Richards/La Scarola/Richards combo. You simply cannot do one without the other. Get your before dinner drinks at Richards, your meal at LaScarola, and come back for Sambuca's and scenary at Richards. If there is a better ""mobster"", old world combo, i have yet to find it. An article here cannot give Richards justice - but check out my review on yelp if you want the gritty details. 2.)Whats the 3 cardinal rules about real estate????Location, Location, Location. Love Grand Ave Little Italy. There are 3 dynamite restaurants within a pitching wedge from here. 3. OK, on to the main hits.....Start with appetizers last night and go with Octopus grilled in an amazing spicy aujus and without a doubt the greatest Sausage and Peppers platter I have ever tasted. The combination of flavors in their platter is breathtaking. You have 2 different slices of fresh garlic, basil, pepper, crushed red pepper, olive oil and I believe a hint of white wine and chicken stock. Again, unreal.  4. My entree was an off the menu special called ""PASTA SINATRA"".....Mother of Christ this was the greatest thing I have ever tasted. A penne noodle, cooked perfectly an coated perfectly with a vodka cream sauce and tossed with jumbo shrimp, jumbo scallops, mussels, shallots and mushrooms. Addicting. I now understand how people smoke crack everyday. 5. My friends had the swordfish special and cappellini diablo and were in heaven. 6. Just for kicks and to keep seeing how many balls they could knock out of the park we ordered a couple side's dozen baked clams, breaded and served Mondello style and Rapini (broccoli rabe) in a garlic olive oil platter. Honestly gang at this point we were just laughing punch drunk at how wonderful everyone was. 7. Great wine selection - We ordered 2 bottles of Chianti that were delicious. 8. Service was impeccable. We tipped 40pct and felt great about it. So that's it. Anyone who lives there....go tonight. If you are visiting, make this #1 on your itinerary for food.

What was I thinking?!"" comments ceased.   For prices - my pasta was over $20, whereas a salmon filet entree was cheaper. I don't really understand the pricing at La Scarola.

Let me tell you..they spare no expense on quality ingredients and make a killer Italian margarita( who knew such a thing existed) The bartender made it just for my bday( or so he said...)  We ordered:  1) Grilled Octopus. It was so freakin good! In a weird I'm eating tentacles and sucky cup thingies kinda way. Very tender and seasoned lightly and well. Marinade I think. 2) Pasta with vodka sauce.. Good but my friend had to get extra sausage and cheese. 3) Bistecca Alla Zorich. Filet mignon, black peppercorns on sliced fried potatoes. Arugula and shaved Parmesan cheese. You must try it.. You have to try it. Only thing it was a little oily at the bottom but still a great dish. Get it medium rare.  4)Capelini Fra diavolo. Usually comes with shrimp but they made it with lobster that day. So good! 5) Pollo Italiano. So flavorful and delicious.  6) Pasta Lorenzo..not so good Cappacino and tiramisu completed our dinner. We all had major leftovers to take home. Too bad I didn't have any the next day...the Bfriendtook care of that!  I have to say we closed the place d/t a very long winded conversation we were having.

This place is great because not all dishes are pasta heavy, which means you leave feeling lighter than other italian restaurants in the city. Ciao!",0.9812,0.76,0.23,0.01,0.3685185185185185

The place is small, and definitely packed together.  The staff is somewhat awkward and stiff. The bar is over priced.  But, the food definitely makes it worth a visit.

2012-06-06,4.0,"Ambiance: Walking into La Scarola can be a little overwhelming...the main dining room is packed and pretty loud. We had reservations though, and were able to get a corner table in the second dining room which was significantly quieter.  Service: Our waiter wasn't particularly friendly/informative/approachable, and simply took our order when we were ready (no descriptions/suggestions/small talk...) Food: We were served bread to start, which was pretty boring (and not warm!) but held us while we waited for the rest of our food. The food was in general very good. We ordered two appetizers: the scarole (had to try it) wasn't particularly inspiring, but was tasty. The shrimp armani was delicious, grilled perfectly and served in a nice red sauce (though it was not the least bit spicy).  We ordered two items off the specials menu: sea bass and swordfish. The sea bass was pan-seared in a somewhat rich sauce with capers, grape tomatoes, garlic etc. and was very good (though a bit pricey at $33 or so). The swordfish was the winner in my book, cooked perfectly and served over sauteed spinach with tomato, zucchini, giardiniera peppers (a nice kick every few bites), and a heavy dose of garlic. Finally, we ordered one of the simple chicken dishes (peto di pollo) which was a little boring. The roasted veggies were great, but the chicken a fairly overcooked and uninspired.  Overall, a nice evening! Definitely go for the shrimp armani and swordfish (if available), but don't expect the most attentive waitstaff.

2012-05-15,5.0,"It's the prime example of Italian food not needing to be expensive to be amazing. La Scarola is half the price for five times the satisfaction. Portions are plentiful and I've never once left without thinking to myself ""God I love this place."" Everything on the menu is fantastic, but if it's your first go at it I'd recommend anything with vodka sauce. You could probably put that stuff on a piece of plywood and I'd go through it board and all without even a second thought.  The atmosphere isn't exactly romantic, but chances are if your date likes La Scarola you're going to have a much better time with them than someone who just thinks a restaurant is good because of it's price tag. The vibe is classic Chicago, and very representative of this awesome city.

Also expect to find a crowded and loud atmosphere and kind of hodgepodge decor.  The walls are covered with pictures of the famous and probably not-so-famous people that visited La Scarola over the years.  It's fun to check them out and see if you recognize anyone from their guest spot on CSI three years ago or that rouge newscaster from WGN circa 1986. Despite a completely non-updated atmosphere and a menu that's probably been around since they opened their doors, I REALLY enjoyed my dinner and my experience.   First off, my martini(s) were huge, still and perfectly executed.  Yum.  Next, we ordered the mussels special in white wine sauce.  ZOMG.  My dining companion had never had mussels before (sacrilege) and ended up loving them.  LOVING them.  It took every ounce of self control to not pick up the serving plate and drink down the wine sauce. I decided on the penne alla vodka, which is penne (obvi) with a creamy vodka sauce served with enormous shrimp, asparagus and mushrooms.  The portion was enormous, so I have enough leftovers for at least two more meals.  My P.I.C. went with the traditional penne with marinara sauce and three massive meatballs and swore up and down it was some of the best pasta ever.  I would concur, especially since we shared our dishes.

Forget the service and the ambiance go for the food!!!! I'm usually a stickler about service but it's worth the finger licking good Italian food you will be served. The grilled calamari was unreal if you like the tecture of calamari. It was so finley charged it melted in your mouth.  We also orderered knoki with penne and Shrim in Vodka sauce. OMG I ate paste the next two day's. They were so full of taste and amazing!!! I will go back there any day for a delicious serving of fine Italian food.

It's hot, stuffy, and I felt too close to everybody. Also, my group of friends and I were supposed to be seated at 8pm; we weren't seated until almost 9:45. On the plus side, the staff that work there were really nice to us. We got free shots of Limoncello and free appetizers for waiting, but it just wasn't enough. Originally, our group of friends decided to go here because La Scarola was going to offer the gluten-free diners gluten-free pasta. Our server that was waiting on us didn't know anything about the gluten-free pasta, so my other gluten-free girlfriends and I were told to order something from the menu. He then came back and confirmed there was gluten-free pasta, and the food I had ordered was not gluten-free Yikes!. We couldn't order from the menu, so we had to quickly make up our meal. That really frustrates me because I want food from the menu. I get so irritated when I am forced to make up my dinner, and the server rushed me. The chef there should be able to come up with something delicious for me. Anyway, enough of my ranting. The food came out bland. I've had better pasta in Disney World.

The portions are unbuckle-your-belt HUGE and the prices are low! How can you argue with that?  I didn't have the grilled calamari but the fried calamari was easily one of the best calamari dishes I've ever had.

It's easy to split a bowl if you don't want to fill up- just ask your server to put it in two cups. The Chicken Vesuvio is wonderful classic dish for garlic lovers (like me, who can't get enough of the stuff). My favorite dish is the Penne alla Vodka. It's creamy, tangy, the pasta is always perfectly cooked, and the seafood is big, juicy and delicious. This is the dish that I call home and tell my mom about. My best advice is to consider the specials for the night... I recently had a spicy and creamy pesto pasta and my date and I fought over the last few bites! My mentality is that the Chef knows best... when everything I've gotten here has been amazing, might as well catch the curve-ball he's throwing and try something new. Take your time here. Order a bottle of wine. Get the espresso and dessert at the end. Make sure you meet Armando. He'll make you feel like family.

The food is great, but I don't know if it's worth the wait when you have other places just as good within five minutes driving distance.

The grilled calamari is amazing...and the pasta my girlfriend ordered looked so good I almost ate off her plate!  (But, my low-carb diet and skinny jeans stopped me.) The only suggestion I would give would be for them to work on coming up with a decorating scheme for the women's bathroom.  It looks like they went to Goodwill with a budget of five dollars and had a blind person pick out the finishing touches.  If you don't have the money to decorate--Here's a suggestion: DON'T DECORATE.  Less is more.

It's the real-deal kind of Italian restaurant that looks like it's owned by Artie Bucco. First off, reservations are a MUST. Seriously, don't even think about coming in here without one, because chances are you will wait for a table even with a reservation. We had a reservation and arrived on time. and were shooed away to the bar to wait for our table. Not a fan of the bar area as I felt like I was on top of the poor people trying to eat their dinner who were seated next to it. Next time, I'll just wait at Richard's (as if I even need an excuse to go there). Once we sat, we were given menus and started to discuss options. We settled on the bruschetta and sausage and peppers to start, and shared pasta primavera and the fish special, which was tilapia in a lemon butter caper sauce. All of the food was delicious and tasted exactly as expected. They know what they're doing here. Portions are ample and generous, but not obscene (this is not Olive Garden or Maggiano's), and prices are commensurate with the quality and amount of food. I especially liked the tilapia, which was light and flaky, but made very flavorful with the delicate sauce it was served with. The pasta primavera was positively brimming with vegetables but I was expecting a garlic and olive oil based sauce (which I prefer) instead of marinara. Still, it was quite enjoyable. We finished with a tart and refreshing lemon ice, which was the perfect way to end the meal. Service is swift and no-nonsense, even brusque. Don't expect lengthy gushing about the menu and endless discussions about this and that; they're there to do a job, and get it done efficiently.

My husband had a pasta dish.  The pasta was cheap tasting, it had no tooth to it, just tasted like any old store bought boxed pasta that I could have made at home for myself.  It was way over priced for what we got.

Unfortunately, the food was completely mediocre.  The only way I can make sense of this is that maybe Chicago doesn't have high standards for Italian food? Or maybe we just ordered the wrong thing (the antipasto for appetizer and the penne with sausage and marinara sauce). I had high expectations for Italian food in Chicago and I really wanted to like this place but the large number of  great reviews for this place + the actual quality of food we received resulted in our decision to skip the other Italian restaurant that we were planning to try on our trip. We didn't want to get disappointed twice in one weekend. The food tasted like something that I could have made at home and I am not bragging about my cooking abilities. How can an Italian restaurant with food that average have such high ratings? The bread was so hard and stale that we didn't eat it. The antipasto was whatever, the tomatoes were tough and flavorless and how was that fresh mozzarella? The pasta was not homemade, the sausage was disappointing and  the sauce was boring.  The positives: the waitress was nice enough and the vibe was cozy and energetic. Almost forgot to add: The wine glasses given to us were still dripping with water.

Geez! Ok, enough of that already, let's get it!  We had reservations at 8.  We got seated at 8:45. I know. I know...annoying. Normally, I would've been out at the 20 minute mark; I mean the whole point of a reservation is to get seated at a certain time!   I checked on the table about 4 times. Yes, I was that girl for two reasons: 1. I was STARVING. 2. This was my suggestion and I felt kind of responsible for everything that happened. Every time I checked in on the reservation, I did let the owner know I was annoyed, but we still had really fun interactions, and I mentioned that he should send some apps out to us b/c we were waiting for so long!  Next thing you know, we are eating some bruschetta out on the sidewalk waiting for our table.  It may not have looked cute, but we did it and it was good. We were finally seated and we ordered some more apps (shrimp and soup) and started with the food.  One person had the white fish, two had the pasta with vodka sauce, and I had the spicy pasta with shrimp. Everyone liked their meals (the vodka sauce is delish) and I was meh about mine. I think it was a little too spicy for me to enjoy.  However, I think I just ordered wrong, and wouldn't be opposed to going and trying something else.   We ended the meal with some tiramisu, a chocolate cake and the pistachio gleato.

There were 5 of us at dinner, and none of us ordered complciated entrees. I ordered penne pasta with meatballs and others ordered the cheese ravioli, capellini, etc. It took about an hour for our food to come out, and I had to ask the waitress what was holding back the service. There was a table  of 4 in front of us that sat after we did but already got their food and paid their bill by the time we even got our food!  I mean, come on. I get that your place is packed for a Tuesday night, but is this really the best you can do? Also, I expect the waitress to come around asking us if we're okay, that the food will be out soon, etc etc but there was absolutely NO care or attention paid to our table. We dropped a lot of money as a table, it's not like the food is $5 a plate. Right after I asked the waitress about our food (yes, I am rude like that when I am starving) we all got our food. What I suspect is that after I asked, the waitress probably realized our food was sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be put on a table. Whatever happened, it was strange. I consider waiting AN HOUR TO OVER AN HOUR for PASTA to be a little extreme. Sure, when you're baking a pizza or baking chicken in the oven, it's a little different, but we didn't order entrees and we didn't order pizzas (not that you could here). Also, a friend pointed out it's in bad shape if you take away other people's plates if not everyone at the table has finished their meal.

Would highly recommend it. The Steak Vesuvio is a generous portion of filet mignon prepared with a side of potatoes. The sauce is a very garlicy, basil, olive oil concoction.

I work in the neighborhood and always see how busy they are. After our experience I can't figure out why that is.   I was immediately concerned when a server just pointed to a table, didn't even bother walking us over. Then our server walks over with a scowl on his face as if he was holding in a compacted bowel movement. Couldn't have looked less thrilled to be at work. My girlfriend and I weren't that hungry and decided to share an entree. When I asked how large the pasta dishes were the server just shrugged his shoulders. I think a caveman could've come up with a more helpful response. Our server was absolutely terrible and I have no idea how he manages to stay employed. He left a pile of dirty plates on the table so long we had to ask a different server to take them for us. Never brought us more bread. The foodrunner was just as bad. When the beast of a woman brought our food she literally just dropped it in front of us and walked off as if we had somehow inconvenienced her. Just terrible. I almost forgot about the busser who decided my girlfriends shoulder was a good place to rest his ass while he talked to people at the bar.  Now onto the food...and by food I mean over priced, under cooked, watery spaghetti with meatballs that tasted like week old ground beef. There wasn't a tomato chunk in the sauce. I looked hard. They charge $14 for something that looks like the sunday dinner at a downstate prison. I'm positive canned spaghetti from Chef Boyardee is considerably more satisfying than the slop we were fed. We would've been open to ordering more but honestly were turned off as soon as we sat down,making us eager to get out of there as quickly as possible. All in all, the service is beyond awful. I don't think I saw a single employee with a smile on their face. I have never been treated like that at a restaurant nor have I been served food that disgusting before. I will never set foot in that joke of an italian restaurant again. There are tons of better options and I'd suggest looking around before wasting your money.

That being said, it's a little too expensive to eat at on a regular basis (but by no means is it not affordable), as is any restaurant in which I am given the option to order more wine than I should drink, which can be said about any restaurant with a liquor license.  :)  I will definitely be back.",0.9945,0.72,0.257,0.023,0.4191480562448304

I was at first a bit uncomfortable with the tight and cluttered surroundings, but it's amazing how quickly an attentive waiter, a nice bottle of red and the arrival of the delectable calamari appetizer transformed this crowded room into a comfortable familial experience. Our party of four enjoyed the tender calamari, a variety of salads, a seafood pasta dish (my basis for comparison for any Italian or Mediterranean restaurant) and an assortment of other standards (veal scallopini and chicken vesuvio if I recall correctly).

The owner/manager came over and spoke to the table making sure everyone was pleased with their meal and enjoying themselves. Left full, happy and with the feeling I had found a new home away from home.  Second experience - the waitress could not have cared less. She had zero personality and made the table feel a bit uncomfortable. She seemed irritated we were not drinking alcohol. The one question asked regarding a special  (what type of pasta is that?) was answered completely wrong (it is filled with cheese) was actually potato. She made zero eye contact and dropped the check with dessert. I have been in the restaurant industry for a long time and this just is not acceptable. The food was delish but I left feeling like she couldn't wait for us to get out the door (and there were plenty of empty tables, as it was a night of a playoff game, and yes - in her section).

I ate it anyway, not wanting to make a fuss. Later that night I got sick to my stomach just about every hour. I became so dehydrated that I went to the doctor who determined it must have been food poisoning. I'm thinking I got a bad muscle.

If you've read any of my other reviews on EYE-talian cuisine, you know that I am hard to please when it comes to this cuisine.

The garlic and white wine sauce hit the spot for me in the Pasta Vesuvio. My boyfriend had the Veal Marsala and though that was very well prepared, I liked mine a little bit better. The drinks were strong and the olive oil good. Plenty of food to take home for lunch the next day! Ummm....we have reservations for 7:15....what?....no tables available? Yeah, 25 min later we were finally seated. And walking in the front door is kind of walking into a war-zone. Waiters everywhere, tables everywhere, loud, etc. I had no idea where the ""hostess stand"" was so I finally had to ask a waiter where to go and that's when I got the ""no tables ready"" line.

Some might roll their eyes at the wait, but they probably shouldn't be there in the first place.  Once we sat down, the owner apologized for the wait and sent us rounds of appetizers, including an unbelievable plate of sausage and peppers; I would have been fine with just that it was that damn good!

Upon entry I was struck by the size of the space...quite smaller than I expected.  We were early for our reservation, but were seated right away at a tiny two seat table right in front of the kitchen.  It was loud, people were rushing by us, and we just felt confined and couldn't imagine really enjoying our dinner.  It was at this time we spotted the ""back"" dining room.  We asked the waiter if we could move back there, which they swiftly accommodated. Once back in the roomier, less crowded area, we immediately felt more comfortable. I enjoyed my crab stuffed shrimp.  The girlfriend enjoyed her entree as well.   Afterward we didn't think anything about our meals were ""exceptional"", but would be willing to go back.  The space is comfy and cozy, and the staff was nice.  Discovered a nice bottle of wine there too, which is of course cheaper at the wine shop than the restaurant, but we would never have found said wine without first having visited La Scarola.   If I had friends or family in town that wanted Italian, my first thought would be to come here.",0.9948,0.781,0.187,0.032,0.49185971685971686

I am used to French mussels where they are usually served almost like a soup. Also, the mussels are huge - almost too big. Entree: This is where this place shines.

The room can best be described as nothing fancy; in fact, it looks exactly like it must have looked in 1990.  And 1980.  And 1970.  And 1960.  You get the drift--the room is a mess and way too crowded and noisy to be considered comfortable.

Most of the crowd looked like they had been coming to La Scarola for decades, although there was a smattering of young marrieds and what appeared to be couples on date nights too.  If you are thinking about this place for a date night--especially the first or second date--I'd think twice.  The noise, crowd, and service all might make this a somewhat overpowering and unpleasant evening, instead of the quiet romantic dinner you might be desiring.  But if you're adventuresome and simply after a delicious meal, go for it!

Oh Armando- every time I go, we have tequila and we talk about whats happened since we saw each other last.  I've been here 4-5 times this year (was introduced to it by my boyfriend last year) and as usual, ordered off the specials menu. (Hint: Always order off the daily specials menu!) I got this amazing seafood risotto- the scallops were cooked perfectly, there was just the right amount of garlic (which is a lot because I love garlic) and a nice, lighter (weird for risotto!) sauce.

2010-07-07,5.0,"LOOOOVE La Scarola.  The place is always busy, it's a thriving restaurant and it's great. The walls in front are covered in photos of celebs and semi-celebs, news anchors, etc. who've visited, such as a big poster of Faye Dunaway and a huge body-length poster of Victoria Silvstedt.  The atmosphere has a casual feel, judged on the paper on top of the tablecloths.  It's not pretentious, but it's nice enough for any occasion.  The carpet needs replacing- it lends a musty smell and is darker in some parts and lighter against the walls, a sign that it's dirty.  The patrons are a good mix, sometimes it seems like it's all either older 65+ or young people in late 20's.  If you're concerned with the location it's only $4.50 for valet, although we found parking on a weeknight.  We usually do have to make reservations for weeknights. Of the appetizer selection try the fried zucchini, it's awesome, very fresh tasting- nothing like I expected.  Bruschetta seems redundant since they give you bread.  Get the broccoli salad, it's sooo good, it's served chilled and has lemon on it and steamed broccoli.  House salad, at just under $4 is also a good choice, I liked the italian balsamic and a few marinated red peppers.  Between the three of us last time, I ordered eggplant parmesan not so great, and my friends had the whitefish and steak and potatoes, and also enjoyed the escarole soup, I did not try this soup because it has chicken broth.  The whitefish was excellent, for 19.95 it was a large piece, and had thinly sliced potatoes under it.  The steak and potatoes was enjoyed, I tried the potatoes and they were good, skinless, baked.  The salmon is also excellent and has an AWESOME risotto, very creamy and cooked just right.  All the portions are HUGE, the spag and meatballs is enough to feed 3 people!  The sea bass, at 30 bucks, has little bones in it, be warned- my friend had it and liked it, other than the little bones she was biting on, it was served on sauteed spinach and very heavy on garlic. The only thing I do NOT recommend is the eggplant parmesan- disappointing.  It was spongy and bland, not layered, and did not come with pasta.  It may not be traditional to serve with pasta but it would be nice to offer that, for like $3 more or so, because it was not a good dish by itself.  The best eggplant parmesan I've had is at Club Lucky, it's a thinly layered with several kinds of cheese and a lot more flavor than La Scarola's.  Overall, I love this restaurant and will always come back.",0.9989,0.748,0.232,0.02,0.5797241118669689
2010-07-06,4.0,"I have some good friends who live in the West Loop. I live in East Lakeview. As a result, to get to them, I have traveled past La Scarola approx. 2839r56 times. I never thought to go there because 1.) the intersection makes my teeth itch; 2.) I already have a go-to Italian spot closer to me; and 3.) the intersection makes my teeth itch. Well, one of my colleagues was in town and he was all about La Scarola. Since he was a guest, I went against my instincts and joined him for a meal here. SO glad I did. First of all, parking wasn't as bad as I feared. Since I might become a regular, you'll understand that I won't share my parking secrets but, rest assured, parking is doable. Yay. I walked in and... no buddy. I felt like all eyes turned to me as I entered the place but not in a 'Halsa Hair?' sort of way. I was momentarily uncomfortable. Then, I was seated at the smallest, most uncomfortable in-the-way table ever. This is not starting well. My buddy arrived and his affable nature lead us to an easy table shift. Crisis averted. Blessed with mucho space to spread out, eat, catch up and do some work (I'm the hardest working man in showbiz), I was in a greatly improved state of mind. We started with the bruschetta which was fine. It didn't knock my socks off, but it did the job: bread, tomatoes, oil, cheese... you know the drill. Good. I sipped on my tonic and lime, traded war stories, helped put together a way-awesome presentation and waited for my entree. I knew I chose well and that feeling was rewarded when the plate was set in front of me. I ordered the Pollo alla Pasquinelli and it was fantastic -- two plump chicken breasts, topped with prosciutto, gorgonzola and veggies (onions, artichokes, tomatoes, and giardinera). It was succulent, hot, filling, and not what I was anticipating. I came here expecting to get a run-of-the-mill pasta dish. I was pleasantly surprised. Since it's not a meal without dessert, I finished up with chocolate mousse cake. Gelato or lemon ice probably would have gone with my meal better...but I am a sucker for chocolate.  After I was re-seated from my kindergarten table, I was able to appreciate the mood of the place. Armando's a pretty cool fellow and he roamed all three rooms to check on the diners, make sure that all was well and see if he could improve the experience in any way. If he doesn't enjoy what he does, he's a d@mn good actor. He offered me and my buddy a tequilla shot for the road but I was driving, so I passed. My buddy did the shot and woke up in TJ. Tequilla at an Italian restaurant... who knew? You made a believer out of me, La Scarola. I'll be back for more Italian delights.

Anyway, there was quite a long wait time for the food as well once we sat down. Maybe around 30min. But the food itself was pretty good. I had the Vitello di Franco, breaded veal with cheese and a variety of veggies and risotto and a surprise addition of basil leaves, which I love! Overall everyone's food was on the heavier side and the portions were huge! Definitely could've shared an entree.  The one thing other than the wait time I slightly disliked about the place was the service.

I have not tried everything on the menu, but I have had most, and it has always been far far above average. No matter what your entree is, i recommend the sausage and peppers appetizer. I have it every visit. It is pretty simple, italian sausage, green and red seasoned bell peppers, and garlic butter. Every italian staple food will be amazing. You can't go wrong with the pastas, and the meat lasagna is a home run. Most recently I tried the white fish, which initially i thought was delicious. That is until i tried my companions sea  bass. It melted in my mouth, and now i can say hands down it is probably one of the best items on the menu. This is a great date spot, if you don't mind the busy environment. On weekends the place is packed, but well worth the wait. Don't be turned away by the $250,000 cars at the valet, the prices are reasonable, and the food justifies the cost.",0.9957,0.798,0.189,0.013,0.46208112874779556

I took the advise of trying the grilled calamari and loved the balsmic vinegar that was on it. I also had so much food that I made myself sick.

2010-03-22,3.0,"This is another one of those places that has been hyped to such an extent via reviews & word of mouth that I was expecting to burst into the hallelujah chorus at some point. Not so much. It was a Saturday so I made a REALLY early reservation (5:30) because I've heard/read about how packed & cramped it can be (this part is true). It was a b-day celebration & family was in town so I didn't want to feel rushed. I think that's impossible here - there is a constant sense of urgency. Our pre-dinner cocktails came immediately and then it was, ""Can I take your order? Can I take it now? Okay, what about now? Are you ready now?"" Once the order was taken our food arrived at lightning speed. We could just FEEL them willing us to eat faster & get out so they could turn our table. It didn't help that the hungry people standing at the tiny cramped bar waiting for a table where doing the same.  The bus boys have it down like a NASCAR pit crew! We watched tables turn in the blink of an eye. That part was quite entertaining. I must say this rushy - rush is a pet peeve of mine and cost them a star.  I ordered a dirty martini which was not as cold as I like & served sans dirtiness - oh well, more vodka for me! It took the edge off the hurried feel and the blue cheese stuffed olives were excellent.   We had the grilled calamari as an app which I thought was under seasoned and a bit rubbery. I've had better - I've had worse. I like Topo Gigio's much better. The shrimp appetizer - again I thought was a bit over cooked but very tasty & everyone enjoyed the mashed potatoes & greens.  The entrees arrived piping hot, abundant & good but not great. I had the sea bass & it was cooked/seasoned well but the accompanying spinach, cherry tomatoes, seemed sad and over cooked. It seems they are moving fast in the kitchen too - cooking at very high temps & not wasting time getting it to the table!  The tiramisu was excellent & the owner comped us a couple of shots for our birthdays. That was swell!  La Scarola would have received four stars if not for the pit crew vibe. I will give this place another try but my socks were not knocked of this time.",0.9744,0.859,0.103,0.038,0.5924006734006734
2010-03-14,5.0,"Trying to take people from out of town for a memorable Chicago italian meal? La Scarola is the place to take them.  I was rather reluctant to actually review La Scarola but because of the way any of my party's and I have been treated here in the past, I decided i should, despite the fact that its already busy and i don't want it to get even busier, cause im selfish about La Scarola, and by all means if you want to keep the wait times at maggianos up, please continue to go there, but just know that La Scarola kicks maggianos' ass in every way you think of a restaurant, not to mention foodwise. There is charm, charisma, nostalgia, and a lively somewhat sophisticated crowd, but whatever category you fit into, I think you will be welcomed with open arms. The manager does so damn much to make you feel at home. For a place thats been open since 03' they have the successful formula to bring customers back down pat. Service is always awesome here, such friendly wait-staff, everybody knows their dishes and will be able to explain exactly what it is, and recommend something you will like Everything we have ever got here was awesome, and had to be taken home, only to taste even better the next day, heres some recommendations, Start with the Pasta & Fagiole, Cannellini beans, pasta and cheese finished with basil and wine, extremely tasty and can be filling so if you have a small stomach maybe get that and a asparagus or house salad, but if you are ready to eat like i usually am try the Chicken Vesuvio always a good choice, linguini and clams are also very good. The calamari is also excellent, breaked and soft, great tasting, and brushetta also very good. Ultimately, my favorite dish hands down is the Penne alla Vodka with Shrimp, mushrooms, asparagus & arugula in creamy vodka sauce, tossed with penne pasta, it is out of control awesome, everyone I've recommended this to has thought its great as well, get it! Chicken Parmasian is also a good bet, for me who normally takes little chances, its a ton of chicken. Moderately priced, but well worth the dollars. Id say most of the time we will leave there having spent around $30-35 person with a couple drinks, and maybe something special from the house as well You may have to wait but its worth any wait which will probably be under an hour during the weekends, but if you do have to wait go next door to either emmitts pub or Richards both have equal amounts of unpretentious chicago charm to them, and should keep the night running smoothly even with a group of peeps.

2010-02-16,4.0,"My favorite Italian place in the city - and I've been to Italian Village, Spiaggia (which, given, is a completely different experience) etc. Mary B. is right - the grilled calamari are a must-have for an appetizer. Nothing like their fried cousins.  As far as the menu goes, I've gone there a million times and tried nearly everything they have. You literally cannot go wrong. Their veal dishes are my absolute favorite, and the waiters will never hesitate to recommend them as they are among their top offerings. The veal chop ala Gabe is probably tops on my list, but like I said, they are all magnificent. Wine list is also good so you won't have any trouble finding anything from the $35 all the way to top-end selections.  You will need to make reservations as walking in is not recommended. It is very busy. The tables are very close together so it doesn't have the feel of an ""upscale"" place, although the atmosphere is thick with the feel of authentic Italian dining. The real allure here is the food. There are plenty of pictures of famous folks with the owners that line the walls. Always something interesting to find no matter where you are seated. Whether you make a reservation or not, be prepared to wait a few minutes for your table. It's generally no more than five minutes, although I have waited a half hour before (again, this only happened once, but was frustrating. The host did give us all a free drink when we were finally seated, however, so that helped a little).  All in all, you will not go wrong with this place. I can't believe more people don't know about it, although I'm not complaining as reservations are normally never a problem. A great date place, from a first date to a regular spot. After you're done - head next door to Richard's Tavern for a drink. It's definitely a ""dive"" kinda place, but the bartenders (Frank during the week and Rocky on the weekends) are among the friendliest you'll find in the city, especially if you get to know them.

When we went in with our guests the host looked at his reservation list (which is unprofessionally a yellow note pad with chicken scratches on it) and said, ""We don't have it."" He proceeded by asking us to get out of the way of the servers. There were no apologies, no compromise or even telling us when the next reservation was. It was rude and they acted like they didn't need our business. Yes it was crowded but the place is tiny. In today's economy one would hope that service would try to be accommodating because they do need our business.

Me, not being the most thurough person decided to have diner on a whim. not knowing what time they opened.  so we show up a half an hour before it opens. instead of telling us to leave and come back, one of the waiters took the time to explain about the resturaunt the history and the food.  The owner insisted we sit down at a table and not to come back even though we offered to because i didn't want to inconvenience them.  They were more than welcoming. The food was prepared and served perfectly and we were checked on by the waiter and staff just enough but not to where it was bothersome.

They did very, very well with the service on our visit. So, we had reservations at 9:30 on a Saturday night. Again, I thought, ""uh-oh... I wonder when they'll seat us...""  So, we showed up a half-hour early and checked with the host, who said, ""Might be able to seat you right now.  Does that table (he points) work ok?""  He pointed to a table at what was probably the busiest intersection in the restaurant. Hungry, we said, ""Sure.  Easy.""  I was ready to have my coat knocked around and wine spilled on me, as I read in other reviews...  Didn't have a single problem with either on our visit.  On the contrary, we overheard him tell our waiter, ""Make sure you take care of these folks,"" and he brought over two mini-sniffers of very smooth cognac.  And though we were at the busy point, it was ok.   Do you remember that scene from ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" where the whole family is on the front lawn BBQing and chasing each other around?  Well, that's what this felt like, with the staff swirling around us like a carnival, each staff member more friendly than the last. As for the food... my wife had the sea bass, which was very, very good. It was both moist and flaky (how DO they DO that???), and would be my choice next time we go back.  I'm a risotto-freak, so I got the risotto primavera.  When the plate came, I was staring at this MOUNTAIN of food.  Literally, it had to be at least 5-6 servings of risotto.  Usually I'm used to something about the size of your fist.  This was litterally closer to the size of my head... not kidding. So, let's say the portions are VERY generous, even for midwestern Chicago. The risotto, while not the most flavorful I've ever had, was pretty decent, with a lot of good veggies and some nice goat cheese mixed in. Overall, if we'd just be talking about the food, this would be a four-star effort or so.  Good, but not ranked among the best.  HOWEVER, it gets a five because of how much fun we had here.  Don't expect a formal Italian restaurant.  This place is busy.  And loud.  And you'll probably end up talking to the table next to you.  And if you're like me, you'll probably enjoy the hell out of dinner.

A little cramped, not much room there, but I liked it.....cozy Italian. We started with the bruschetta. There's not a whole lot you can do to mess up bruschetta, unless you go overboard with different toppings. The tomatoes were teeny, tiny dices with a lot of herbs. Bread was tasty too, crusty on the outside, soft and soaked with olive oil in the middle. For the entree I ordered the macaroni arrabbiata (spicy red sauce). It came with rigatoni instead of the macaroni. Delicious. I was contemplating whether or not to get this, being afraid there'd be too much heat. The spice was just right. After you take a bite, the hotness sort of lingers in the back of your mouth, in a pleasant way though. The linguine vesuvio was ordered at my table too.

Our waiter was pretty cool, he seemed like a nice guy but was obviously in the weeds and really lacked attention.   For entrees we had the veal, thin, covered in garlic, fresh provolone, tomato, and set over asparagus and spinach and was served with a side of risotto.  We also had the portobello gnocchi with sausage tossed in a garlic butter...so good but the sausage was a little dry.   Portions are huge so keep that in mind if you're are a dish splitter.

While we were waiting for the clams, Vera came by and took our order. I went with her recommendation, a gnocci special. The boyfriend had eggplant parmesean.   Here's how she screwed up:  The wine came a right after we ordered our glasses, and the clams came about 10 minutes after we ordered them.  That's good timing I like to space my meals. That being said, I was less than happy when our food arrived two minutes after the clams. Vera was full of ""I'm sorries"", but really? I've spent 8 of my minuscule years serving, and my experience has taught me that when the app comes out too close to the entree, YOU HOLD IT IN THE KITCHEN. Don't bring it out when your guests are enjoying their appetizer. It ruins a meal to have to rush to eat your appetizer so that your dinner doesn't get cold,  and ruins an experience to have to cram so many plates on a two top. Timing, guys, it's important when putting in a ticket.   Now, we were nice and took it in great stride, but I wasn't as happy as I should have been. I felt rushed and crowded.I was willing to get over it, figuring that since this place is raved about they would accommodate us and give us free dessert or something for the screw up. Our check comes, and not a thing comped. Nothing, not even the clams appetizer that they rushed.  People, that's just bad service. I'll come back, this is a great spot with cozy trimmings,  but I'll make a reservation and be sure not to order the main course until after I have my appetizer.",0.9963,0.716,0.199,0.086,0.5907568718544328
2009-09-14,5.0,"Delish! One of my new favorite Italian spots. We started out with the grilled calamari which was really good, cooked just right. A couple of my dining companions also got the pasta fagiole soup, and it was a taste of heaven! The broth was wonderful and it was packed with beans & pasta. I wished I had gotten it but then I wouldn't have had room for my entree :-/  Speaking of entrees, I had the penne alla vodka and it was (pardon the stupid expression but it sums it up nicely) 'the bomb'. It was packed with mushrooms & asparagus & some perfectly cooked big, plump shrimp. The sauce was wonderful - creamy but not so much so that it felt to heavy. One of my dining companions got a similar dish to mine, with a vodka sauce, but hers also had mussels and scallops in it . It was equally delicious, with just a slightly creamier sauce. Another ordered the chicken vesuvio which I did not try, but she loved it. And it was a huge portion. She had meant to get the pasta vesuvio with chicken but ordered wrong, and when she talked to our server about it, he ended up bringing out a side of pasta for her, even though it was her error. That is the other thing about this place, the service was fantastic. Our server was on point the whole time, great with suggestions on what to get. And the manager stopped by our table at least 3 times throughout the time we were there to check-in and make sure we were having a good time and enjoyed the food. The restaurant was hopping on a Saturday night so expect a wait, even if you have a reservation which we did. We got there for our reservation at 8 but didn't get seated until 8:40ish (which is very typical according to my friends who go there 4-5 times a year). But, just do what we did and go next door to Richards for a drink or two and the manager will let you know when to come back (they can either call you or they'll tell you a time to come back). I loved the hustle & bustle of this place though so I didn't mind having to wait. But if that bothers you, then I would suggest going during the week and avoid going on a Fri or Sat night.  Overall this was a great dining experience. I can't wait to go back.",0.9949,0.796,0.155,0.049,0.5966004025214551

SERVICE: our waiter was nice and all, but we felt like he was trying to make the place seem more pretentious than it really was. it was pretty annoying and to be honest that's the thing that bothered me most about this restaurant. AMBIANCE: besides the waiter, the ambiance was casual.  there was a good mix of people around us- from older business men to a big family to some thirty-something women. it's ""cozy"" which, nicely put, just means cramped. it does feel like you're sitting in an older restaurant, which i think is the appeal to most people.",0.969,0.787,0.167,0.046,0.6490929705215419

(the manager seems to toast with me every time I visit) This was my third visit to La Scarola and have to admit that I was equally impressed with the third visit as I was the first and second.  I called for a quick reservation for 2 in the next 15 minutes if available....they quickly obliged and my partner and I hurried over. We both ordered specials that we in-turn split on one anthers plate.  The food is as authentic as my great aunt's Italian Ravioli.  The service was prompt and the servers had no problem jumping in if their counterpart was busy.

2009-07-16,5.0,"I'd give this place more stars if I could. Words fail me as to how superb this place is. I was recommended by Anthony Potenzo, one of the managers as Sushi Samba, since he's an expert about all the go-to places in the city. His opinions are usually dead on, helpful, and honest. So when I'm not eating sushi, I absoluetly LOVE LOVE LOVE Italian food. And for a while I've been trying to broaden my horizon with Italian food as well. Anthony told me about this place and said if I ever wanted authentic Italian food, check this place out. After  months of hesitating, I finally found a special occasion to go there. LOVED IT!!!! I'm out of words. I have this tradition where I must go in there at least once a month for their bombastic canoli's even if I don't have the time to dine in. So far, I've had the Penne al Vodka Sauce, Eggplant Parmesan, and their Pasta Garlic Sauce. Chicken was so tender it almost melts in your mouth. The owner, Armano I believe, is ALWAYS so hospitable and nice. The first time we went there, we didn't know who this short guy at the bar was, I assumed he was just a busboy. But he asked what shots we liked, and we replied, ""whiskey"". A few minutes later he poured us some whiskey shots which left me flattered. Then we started looking at all the pictures on the wall of famous people and kept on spotting the guy who poured us shots in all of the photos, so I safely assumed that was one of the owners. He's such a nice guy; he makes you feel just like home. Don't be intimidated by his mustache though. Great service. Genral pricing. You'll spend just as much here as you would at like Francesca's or Rosebud. Decor is cute and simple. Nothing fancy. You might even feel like you're dining in Italy!

There were 14 of us which is quite an endeavor for a small restaurant. We waited 45 minutes for our table but I think that had something to do with our big group.  We took advantage of the wait and went to the dive bar next door for a beer; I think its called Ricks but that experience can wait for its own review. Needless to say when we were finally seated the owner of the restaurant was very apologetic for the wait, he even comped us some appetizers for the inconvenience. We enjoyed the calamari and clams - they were very well prepared and delicious. For the main course I devoured the steak vesuvio, a generous portion of filet mignon prepared with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were delicious as was the steak. I am quite the potato fiend and these stood out quite a bit. I also had a taste of my co-workers salmon, pasta and some other type of potato.

La Scarola is a straight-forward Italian restaurant.  Poor acoustics, loud business diners, loud locals, tightly spaced tables.  Hundreds of photos of people you'll never identify, even if someone gave you their names, add to the crowded feeling.  It's all part of the atmosphere - if you don't like it, don't come back.  Once you adjust to the busy atmosphere, you settle back to enjoy the experienced waitstaff and the extensive menu.  Dishes and drinks arrive quickly, so don't order right away or you'll be out the door in an hour.   The grilled calamari is as good as you can get in the Midwest (remember, they don't raise calamari in Lake Michigan, so it's older and a bit tougher than you'll get on the coasts).  The pasta, chicken, veal, and steak choices cover most preparations, and I think they'll fix whatever you want even if it's not on the menu.  My #1 recommendation - their Italian sausage In whatever pasta they offer it that day.  I was lucky to get it once with gnocchi, zucchini, and portabella mushrooms, and once with broccoli rabbi and penne pasta.  I usually skip the meat dishes, but not here.  La Scarola has great sausages and outstanding fresh pasta.  We've not found better pasta in Chicago in the three years we've been back.  That's the reason to be here.   Their tiramisu is famous, and should be.  It's large, enough for two.  And it's delicious, very smooth and creamy, not dominated by the savoiardi cakes or cocoa, but complimented by the soft cake and the light cocoa flavor.  Just perfect. Great service, knowledgeable waitstaff, great pasta, great sausage, wide menu selections.  Worn out décor in an inconvenient location.  Yup, I'll stay with a four-star rating.  Maybe 4.4.",0.9941,0.798,0.162,0.04,0.5711240310077519

2009-04-28,4.0,"My expereince was actually a five. But we went late on a Sunday night, so it was not as busy/crowded/rushed as the small, closely placed table indicate a bustling Friday night would be. Also, I managed to fill up on marinara/bread and two appetizer dishes and no wine, so our tab was slightly less than the average bill. The food we had was DIVINE. Grilled octopus was worth the trip alone as is the marinara sauce. I had a shrimp and potato appetizer that I actually could not finish--which is saying a lot, considering how much I love mashed potatoes! My date had the chicken vesuvio with perfectly cooked pasta and delicious sauce. I could see how the place could get pricey since I noted many special dishes in the $20-$30 range.

I had heard about La Scarola for years but had never been -- so I decided to take a chance.  I'm glad I did.  I called at about 4:00 in the afternoon to make a reservation for 7 and they were able to accommodate us.  We arrived right on time and our table was ready within minutes.  I don't think it's very easy to seat 7 people together in this restaurant -- but they made it work and we were all comfortable.   We had the sausage/peppers, grilled calamari and antipasta to start.  All were delicious. I had the grilled whitefish -- which was light but very filling. A couple of the guys asked our server to order for them -- they loved their dishes.  My boss ordered the wine -- we had a Pinot Noir and a Chianti.  Everyone was full and happy at the end of the meal.  The atmosphere was great.  This place has a lot of character.  Our server was great.  The prices are very reasonable.  For 7 people our bill was just under $350.  I'll definitely be back and would highly recommend it for the ambiance, food and service.  Enjoy!",0.9962,0.766,0.227,0.006,0.6690357142857143

A packed Italian restaurant with great atmosphere and where specials on handwritten/photocopied and inserted in the menu (pic included). The walls are covered with photos, bottles, art and relics. Server made excellent recommendations and I had him order my entree for me - ended up getting an excellent veal dish not even on the menu. I highly recommend the escarole and sausage app (recommended by the server), mussels in red sauce and the grilled octopus (all of these were off of the specials menu.) The minestrone was excellent and I also got to try  some of the Pasta Capriccio which was really good. The only thing I had which I wouldn't recommend was the Canolli not because it was bad, but because it was just ok.

The atmosphere is pretty cheesy and the photos on the wall are hilarious, but I see this all as a restaurant spending their money on what really matters, the food. You will definitely see lots of men in black turtlenecks with too much gold jewelry, but that just makes it more fun. Try to play a game where you spot who could be an extra on the Sopranos! Everything we had was very good, but the two of us who ordered off the specials menu definitely got the best deal. I had a homemade gnocchi in a jalapeno cream pesto with sundried tomatoes and Italian sausage. Oh my god. It was the best gnocchi I've ever had. Very light and incredibly smooth textured. I was in heaven! The specials also come with soup which happened to be a very hearty and VERY flavorful lentil veggie soup that I could have had as a meal. The portions are also very large. I couldn't finish my gnocchi even with the help of all my coworkers! The other special ordered at the table was the whitefish. Another homerun dish. Extremely flavorful and huge portions. We all wanted a taste, so it's a good thing there was enough to share. YUM!  Everything was very good, but I'd recommend asking your server what to try. He pointed us in the direction of our two favorite dishes that day.  Prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food served. We were there at lunch, so I don't know if they have a separate menu for dinner. It didn't seem like it, though.

Ooookay.  When we came back, we happened to be spotted by a random waiter who offered us a table that had been open since we arrived. The food is where La Scarola shines.  I ordered the Pasta Vesuvio and was impressed.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful, and it was perfectly complemented with a garlic and wine sauce.  Each entree is enough for two meals, or one if you're really hungry.  For dessert, I ordered a cannoli, which comes garnished with a maraschino cherry on each end and powdered sugar sprinkled around the plate.  It was crunchy and tasty, but not worth it, in my opinion.  There are better cannoli options in this area.

2009-01-28,5.0,"If your goal is authentic, rustic, hearty Italian dishes, look no further than La Scarola.  i can't believe I haven't yelped about this place yet. Yes, the wait can be long (especially Friday and Saturday nights) even with reservations.  Yes, it can get loud inside (and a little cramped).  Yes, there is a reason people come back to this place.  Who cares?  Go grab a cocktail at either Richards (next door) or Emmit's Pub (just around the corner - actually, on the corner). Food like this is a special thing.  It is an experience instead of a meal.  The insane amount of celebrity pictures tells the story of the who's who that have eaten there.  Celebrities pop in from time to time.  A friend of mine who works part time as a driver for a movie production company told me that he's had plenty of celebs in town for various movies ask him to drive to La Scarola - by name.  Look long enough and you'll see local celebs photos too (athletes, actors, politicians, singers, news people). The veal marsala is, in this eaters opinion, one of, if not the, best iterations I've ever experienced.  The rissoto is fantastic, as is the old-school pasta with meatballs.  Frankly, I haven't had a dish I haven't liked.  Even the fish, and I hate fish.  Entrees are large and you must take them home, lest you curse own stupidity.  There is no finer lunch than the one where your coworkers keep asking what you're eating and where you got it. Calamari is a nice starter, but nothing makes me happier than the bruschetta.  Fresh, fragrant and tangy, the tomato mix is a nice start to a meal. But no matter what you do, no matter the restaurant you eat at, always ask which dessert is fresh made.  Some of the best restaurants order that stuff in, and it comes from factories that load it up with fat, sugar, and chemicals to ensure flavor intensity and a long shelf life.  At La Scarola, you must not skip the canolli.  This treasure of a dessert is made fresh on site and is a classic example of the exquisitely simple indulgence.  The contrast of the shell's crunchy texture and the interplay of the creamy sweet filling make this Sicilian favorite a powerful experience.  Shut your eyes and concentrate on the flavors and textures and you run the risk of refusing to share even a bite. I've twice been comped for no other reason than being nice, friendly, and understanding about having to wait a little longer than expected. I tell people when they travel to hunt out that local gem for a true city experience.  Ignore the big box theme restaurants - they're safe bets, but boring, like winning $2 on a $1 lottery ticket.  Gems like La Scarola are exactly what I mean.  A classic Chicago restaurant like this should be busy every night they are open.  One visit here and you'll want to come back, damn the wait.

If you're like most folks, you fall into one of the following two categories: A) If you're shy about butter, oil, and calories, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! B) If you don't care about breaking all the rules every once in a while, then prepare yourself for a decadent mouthgasm, and head to La Scarola. If you don't like being in HIGHLY crowded situations, I suggest you avoid going after 6 on Thursday, Friday or Saturday. My best advice is to shoot for an early dinner---it's very pleasant between 5 and 6.  If you like being in very crowded situations with loud, fun people, and you are in the mood for man-hugs and free tequila shots, don't be shy and head over during the crunchy hours mentioned above. It appears that anyone who has written a bad review about La Scarola complains about the busy-ness, or the oily-ness. I don't know how these people were not warned.

2008-09-18,4.0,"It's kind of tough to have such high expectations from a place, but I did since it was highly recommended by my half Italian roommate.  The prices are pretty reasonable, and the portions are pretty big.  Everyone has there own preferences, and my tastebuds liked it but didn't exactly capture the wow factor I was looking for.  We made reservations, and only had to wait 10 minutes before getting seated.  The place is small having 2 rooms, but very cute.  Many celebrities like to eat here as the walls were decorated with pictures and signed autographs.  My friend told me she got to steal looks at Johnny Depp when he ate there in the other room.  Our appetizers were fabulous - the mussels, breaded clams, and the fried calamari.  I do think the marinara sauce for the calamari tasted too much like ketchup though.  My pasta with the chipotle sauce was good, but not as good as my brother-in-law's chicken linguine or the pasta with vodka sauce.  There are some dishes better than others, and I would recommend going with what you like as opposed to what the servers might recommend.  The staff here is spectacular in providing great service.  They are personable and friendly, and truly want you to have an enjoyable experience.",0.9976,0.681,0.298,0.021,0.6368333333333333

2008-09-15,3.0,"I heard from my sister whom is an avid yelper that this place rocked...and maybe because she hyped it up so much I had really high expectations.  I even checked out their website to see what the fuss was about and just to review the menu before I went.  She had told me that the place was always packed and you HAD to make reservations otherwise the wait would be much longer, and so she made the reservations for 7pm.   La Scarola was a nice little restaurant...there wasn't anything about the exterior or interior that would draw you in.  You could easily pass by the place not knowing that many celebrities come by to eat some authentic Italian food.  But we gave it a try and it was definitely busy there and we ended up waiting 15 minutes even after our reservations, but that didn't really bother me since it's a regular thing for Chicagoans to wait for at least an hour to be seated without reservations.   The service was alright.  It looked like they did whatever they could to keep up.  The dishes that our party had consisted of (that I could remember the names): - Pasta Visuvio ***** - Pasta Lorenzo **** - Shrimp Risotto *** Appetizers: - Clams Modelli **** - Mussels  **** - Calamari **** And that is my star rating for the food itself.  My friend had a pasta that was 'gnocchi' shaped...just looked wrong...and I couldn't get passed the look of it to even try it.  My friend barely touched it.  I'm sure she's going to toss it in the end.  The appetizers were delicious!   The atmosphere in the restaurant was very loud...you could barely hear your party's conversation.  I had to yell several times, but good party atmosphere, so if you're looking for a quiet evening...I don't know if this is the spot to go.  Overall, the food was good, couldn't say it was amazing, you can definitely tell the authenticity of the food.  So props to that.  I'd recommend it to yelpers to try it out.  Don't know if I would hype it up though.   -",0.9956,0.842,0.158,0.0,0.45471071663379353

We were seated in a tiny table that was too close to the bar on one side and a doorway on the other. The bread was hard and the butter was cold. Our food was disgustingly greasy and flavorless. And expensive. Maybe it was just the shrimp risotto, that was what I ordered. The waitstaff was pretty nice and the restaurant was cute and homie, though that may be a nice way of saying it could use an upgrade to something more modern. I haven't decided yet.

2008-08-15,4.0,"I really wish there were half stars, because giving this place 4 is a stretch. The food is delicious but the service absolutely marred our experience. We chose this place to eat for my boyfriend's birthday dinner last night at the last minute because we needed some place open late after he got stuck working late on a project.  Initially, I made a 10pm reservation and I made sure to check that the restaurant would not be closing to ensure us time to enjoy our meal. I moved it up to 9:30 when it looked as if he would be leaving work earlier than scheduled. As you would have it, we ended up being delayed by a few things so we called again to ask if we could return to our initial reservation. On each call, the gentleman was friendly and insisted that it was no trouble. When we arrived, the host invited us to sit wherever as there were only a few scattered tables. We chose to sit in the back of the middle room for a more intimate setting. When our server approached us she looked grim as she briskly handed us our menus and asked if we'd like a drink. We had planned to get a bottle of wine so we said that water would be fine. Upon inspecting the menu, we noticed that the wine selection was absent. When our waitress returned, we asked for a wine list and she was visibly annoyed at having to make the second trip. When she brought back the wine list, she gave us less than a minute to view the selections before she was back with pen and pad in hand as we were obviously still going over the list. We hurried our selection as she stood impatiently and within a minute of ordering our wine she was asking us to order our main dishes. At that point we had been seated less than 4 minutes and were still discussing appetizers. This went on for the entire dinner and we felt like an absolute burden to our waitress. When my boyfriend's first entree choice was not available, she did not allow him any additional time to review the menu and stood waiting when he obviously wanted a minute to review his other options. We were also asked if we'd like to box our food before we were halfway through our meal, and after dropping off the check with our dessert, she lingered around making it uncomfortably obvious that she wanted us to pay. When I was assured that we would be served at 10pm, I expected it to be with the same friendliness of an 8pm arrival. I've been in her shoes as a waitress and while it can be frustrating to watch people linger (although we left the second that we finished everything), a fine dining restaurant should allow at least an hour from arrival to departure. The only reason this place gets four stars is because it deserves six stars for the food. We ordered calamari for our appetizer, and it came out perfectly seasoned and fried. I've never been a huge fan of calamari, but I was able to split this order with no problem. For our main dishes, I ordered a specialty dish of penne pasta, shrimp, broccoli, tomatoes, and portabella mushrooms sautéed with a lemon white wine sauce. My boyfriend's meal was a chipotle red sauce with shrimp and sliced grilled chicken served over bow tie pasta. Although my boyfriend's dish was a bit too spicy for my taste, both could not have been prepared better. The portions are quite hefty as well, and I bagged well over half of my meal to take home. For dessert we had a slice of cheesecake that had a very distinct lemon flavor. It was enjoyable, but I would have much preferred a plain flavor. As much as the service upset me, this was a damn good meal. I'd like to think that our arrival time had everything to do with our experience and that upon return we have a more pleasant time. My overall consensus is that this could be a wonderful place for a nice dinner as long as it's not after 9:30.",0.9846,0.809,0.113,0.078,0.4293242630385487

As for the food, though the prices have been steadily rising, it remains one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. For appetizers, escarole and beans and sausage and escarole are very good.

Eggplant parmesan and ravioli are very good. I often will try a special - they have a number of different ones and they change often.  All the chicken dishes I've had are excellent, including Chicken Vesuvio.

2008-03-20,2.0,Food and atmosphere is good.  My main complaint is that they rush you out of the restaurant.  I would have to say that this is the first restaurant that did not ask us if we were interested in having dessert.  The bill was brought without us asking for it.  It is fairly loud in there.  The tables are close to one another.  If it wasn't so loud in there you would be able to hear your neighbors conversations.,0.5267,0.905,0.068,0.027,0.5239583333333333
2008-03-03,5.0,"One thing to know about this place before you arrive with all your expectations of what a restaurant experience should be: forget those demands and preconceptions and just chill out, and see what happens. It'll be more fun that way.  Here was my experience:  We made a reservation for 9pm on a Saturday, and weren't able to be seated until 9.45pm. But we took this in our stride and went  to the wonderfully classic old bar next door (which is quite possibly being kept in business soley by La Scarola patrons waiting to be seated). When we came back at 9.30pm, they still couldn't seat us, but eventually the charismatic and hilarious owner/boss (??) gave us some wine, on the house, which we enjoyed while waiting for a table. This dude is quite a character -- and watch out if you're a guy -- he'll manhandle your shoulders and possibly give you a bear hug (all friendly like) several times before he gets you seated. He's just being friendly. Fortunately he doesn't rough up the women in quite the same way.  So what of the food? Homely, full of flavor, messily presented, simply done, unpretentious. Classic comfortable Italian. I liked it a lot. Arrive hungry, even if you have to wait an hour, you'll want to be hungry. I've had better Italian, but rarely in Chicago, so this place is pretty special.  I liked this place better than Volare, Volare seemed more like a churned-out business full of wankers; this place had more character and personality.",0.9958,0.792,0.203,0.005,0.5003401360544218
2008-02-22,5.0,"I used to think Italian food was overrated until La Scarola converted me. Italian food is so predominant in America that some people even think spaghetti and pizza is American. This made me avoid Italian food unless friends wanted it because it was eating normal everyday stuff in my opinion. La Scarola though is authentic Italian cuisine, according to my friends that took me there that spent time studying abroad in Italy. It's taken me along time to post finally because I wanted to make my 100th review something memorable and I had been working crazy I-banking style hours. I chose La Scarola because it is my favorite Italian restaurant and opened my eyes up to what 'real' Italian food is (not Olive Garden junk). From the creamy risotto that has the perfect texture, to their delicious vesuvios, I simply love La Scarola. It's one of the must-take places that I bring guests from out-of-town to. Even my mom liked it and she hates western food! I also love how they frequently update their specials menu, it hasn't been the same ever when I've gone. We used to go all the time because my friends love it too. When we're there we'd have fun and I'd become ""Big Tony"" and talk in my horrid Italian accent. It's a very fun place, a warm family atmosphere. Once there were drunk ladies without shoes on and they were hilarious. The dcor is cool tool, so old-skewl Chi-town. They also honor reservations so you don't have to wait around. Once we were there and a person cleaning our table knocked over something onto the floor. The manager came down on him hard, poor guy - something straight outta a gangster momvie. The place is in the 'family' owned part of Chicago. I bet we must've seen a few Mafioso there. It's so cool. Their chicken is always amazing, so moist and tender. Their seafood is great too. Once we had the gnocchi there and it was amazing. I don't normal see gnocchi on the menu, but they frequently have wonderful specials to try. It's also very reasonable priced and you can get most entrees between $10-$20.  Probably the best price to taste ratio (or value as some would call it) in all of Chicago for Italian food.",0.9905,0.829,0.141,0.031,0.49888888888888877

Pasta w/ Goat Cheese, Liz's Risotto, and My Veal Marsala.  Once again I went against my instincts and passed on the Veal Special.  I should have known that anything with bacon tastes better, but my Veal Marsala was very good too. The rest of the dishes were all good, but the above mentioned were definitely a step above.  With dinner we enjoyed two very well priced bottles of Tuscan Sangiovese ($35).  We finished the evening with a candled Tiramisu, a Canolli, and the Chocolate Mousse.  All three desserts were delicious and the Canolli was one of the best that I have had. The interior of La Scarola looks like a scene from Goodfellas.  It seems like every time that you are there that one of the famous faces from their walls is actually sitting at a table next to you enjoying their meals.  It's the type of place where the staff takes care of their regulars and you so desperately want to achieve ""regular"" status.  The service was great and became even better when the free tequila shots began to flow.  It turned out to be the manager/owner's birthday and he made sure that he celebrated with every table and our table twice!  I haven't had a bad experience yet and will continue to frequent La Scarola.  Maybe one day I will reach the elusive ""regular"" status and be greeted with a handshake and a ""I have your favorite table waiting for you Mr. David."" 1 Sausage & Peppers 1 Escarole & Beans 1 Brushetta 1 Pollo Italiano 1 Veal Marsala 1 Eggplant Parm 1 Veal Special 1 Chicken Vesuvio 1 Risotto 1 Broccoli & Goat Cheese Pasta 2 Bottles of Sangiovese  1 Tiramisu 1 Canolli 1 Chocolate Mousse Cake 3 Double Espressos 1 Cappuccino  ------------------------------------ $265",0.9977,0.742,0.212,0.046,0.5668680535988229

He was very apologetic and offered us a free appetizer of white beans and escarole, which was so good it made me consider full-time vegetarianism. I ordered a special of chicken strips and mushrooms Vesuvio over linguini. This dish had such a nice complexity of flavors and textures, it was like little angels peeing on my tongue!

Due to the popularity of this restaurant, it's highly recommended that patrons make reservations for the evening.  However, it's been on multiple occasions that I've brought parties of 6-8 here **at the time of reservation** only to be sent to wait at the grungy bar next door.  Normally, a wait of 10... even 30 minutes is fine.  HOWEVER, the waits have all amounted to no less than 1-1.5hr each time.  To make matters worse, when I politely inquired about the status of our table the manager cops an attitude as if he's doing us a favor by keeping our names on his list!  We weren't the only ones given this treatment either - I noted a multitude of parties given the exact same attitude. I'm sorry, but no amount of good food can justify such bad reservation management and poor treatment of its patrons.  This has happened time and again - so long La Scarola, thanks for the memories.   The following scene from Seinfeld comes to mind: Jerry: I don't understand. Do you have my reservation? Rental Car Agent: We have your reservation, we just ran out of cars. Jerry: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation. Rental Car Agent: I think I know why we have reservations. Jerry: I don't think you do. You see, you know how to *take* the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation.

2007-07-11,5.0,"Oh how I love thee La Scarola, let me count the ways....  1. Mmmmm Mmmmmm Good Italian (not pronounced EYE-talian) food. The menu is always chock full of your consistent favorites with added daily chef's specials. The calamari appetizer (get the fried, not grilled) is a sure bet as are the salads and soups. The penne alla vodka is simple but delicious, but the Gamberi Risotto is my favorite... grilled shrimp wrapped in prosciutto with sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes on a bed of garlic risotto. Mama Mia bring the crash cart!!!! All of the chicken, veal, meat and fish entrees come with a small side of pasta - just perfect for a taste if you're carb shy. 2. It's the type of place where people show up in jeans and tshirts or dresses and slacks... the decor is kind of a mish mosh with celebrity photos on the wall and classic italian style so you never feel over or under dressed.  It's laid back but still always bustling with a crowd - so make reservations!!!! 3. The manager is adorable and a die hard Sox fan (sorry I'm biased) he always brings me and my guests over to the bar for lemon drop or sambuca shots... I've seen him do this with people who have a long wait for a table and his regular clientele alike. He's chatty, really encouraging everyone to come back and just epitomizes top notch service.   4. La Scarola is next door to Richard's Bar. Need I say more??? It's a great way to cap off your evening. Roll into Richard's on a full belly, saddle up next to the goomba's at the bar, order up a six pack of your favorite ghetto beer, challenge someone to eat one of their infamous hard boiled eggs and sing the rest of your night away to the Rat Pack on their jukebox which hasn't been updated since circa '66.  5. Oh and someone had mentioned the La Scarola valet... I'm not sure if it was the same guy I had last night but he truly was fantastic. He opened the door for everyone coming and going and really worked for his tips. Plus the valet parking here is only $4.50 - where else in Chicago can we park for mere duckets like that?!?!? I can tell you where... NOWHERE!! They could easily jack up the prices and gouge us like the rest.... but they don't, how refreshing. Just like a Peroni.",0.9933,0.802,0.145,0.053,0.5287638072521793

And for the appetizer, we got the obligatory fried calamari, since we were in an Italian restaurant. Let me tell you - calamari was delightful. It was just soft enough for it to be crunchily scrumptious. They know the 3- or 30-minute rule! And the pastas... I felt like I died and went to heaven when I had my first bite of each.

As someone else mentioned it does look a little shady from the outside but maybe that is a good thing. Maybe it keeps people out- it is already too popular. Sometime you do have to weight for a table- like 30 mins+ but it is worth it. The bread they serve is like crack- so addictive. The Pasta Fagole soup completes me. It really is the best in the city. I have been four times and each time I order one of the pasta specials. Umm, I have never been disappointed. I find the wait staff to be very helpful and willing to make wine recommendations (and very non-judgmental when I ask for my eighth basket of bread).  The only draw back is that the restaurant is filled with tables and it becomes hard to navigate when it is crowded.

I also had a house salad- the tomatoes were huge. I really liked the dressing, though it was a bit oily. The bread was great and they gave us the equivalent of a loaf.

2006-12-19,3.0,"I am starting to think that it is easy to find good italian in this city, but it is really hard to find excellent italian food.  There were 4 of us that went to the restaurant, had a reservation and only waited 5 min MAX to get the table, which was great since the place was packed, and it was a Monday night. Restaurant is small, so tables are packed in, but not as bad as some other places I have visited. We started with bruscheta and fried calamari, both done well. Bruscheta was crunchy, with great tomato and basil taste. One of the best I have had in a restaurant compared to my own homemade with garden tomoatoes. The wait staff were very friendly, the person who seated us was very nice, stopping by multiple times to check on us, a very nice guy. The main courses though are where its just ok. I had the staple chicken vesuvio, potatoes were great, garlicky and browned. the chicken on the other hand was almost boiled in texture, and didn't have much taste. Portion was mid size, adequate for the price. Other dishes were a vodka cream sauce with shrimp, good flavor. Others had lasagna and the other meal was a chicken dish with sausage. Ok flavors, standard fare, nothing extraordinary. Total bill was $100 without tip, so a great price for 4, though none of us drank alcohol that night.  All in all, cozy, comfortable, nice staff, good price, but the food was only ok, nothing to really drive me back on a regular basis.  Parking was easy as well, or they valet was the cheapest price i have seen in some time, 5 bucks, short of the burbs. I will definitely give it another try, with another menu item to see if it will stand out more. Its tough to differentiate an Italian restaurant in a city chock full of them, and when so many people think a chain like magianos is the best thing on this planet for Italian food, places may not feel they need to kick it up to that next level, which is understandable.",0.9987,0.732,0.253,0.015,0.5245951417004049

The veal marsala, which I didn't have but tasted, was excellent.  Just perfect, full of big mushrooms and super-tender veal.  I think when we go back, I might have to have the veal marsala, because my mouth is watering now thinking about it.  My boyfriend liked his ravioli very much, too, so that dish was also successful.

However, upon entering the restaurant, my whole impression changed. The atmosphere is that of a traditional family-style Italian restaurant, complete with pictures and memorabilia covering the walls. I had the cheese ravioli, and it was served extremely hot and fresh. The ravioli were baked, not boiled, which I think makes for better pasta when combined with a good sauce (which La Scarola had). I went early enough that I didn't need reservations, but other reviewers have noted that they are required later in the evening, so I'll definitely remember that for my second trip.
