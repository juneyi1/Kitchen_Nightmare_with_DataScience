I was staying in the area and by the time I got back late at night, most restaurants were already closed--a 7-Eleven corn dog probably would've been close to making my night.

Don't be intimidated by the sit-down restaurant-looking setting--you can order at the counter and either choose to stay or go--it's just a fancier made-to-go place. I had the chicken, pork, and steak tacos. By now, I'm used to not getting the most bang for my buck, so I was surprised when I saw just how FAT these tacos were--plentiful, generous portions of meat and tortillas filled all the way that I couldn't pick up the tacos without some meat and toppings falling off. They were all delicious and so filling that 2 amigos would've been fine to keep my belly some company. Keep in mind that the salsa verde is super hot--like flamin' hot--so don't toss the whole thing in there if you can't tolerate spicy.

2016-08-02,4.0,"Moved in really close to 2 Amigos so naturally it was the first place I tried out in the neighborhood. As a vegetarian, Mexican food is usually a safe bet and this was no exception!  Veggie Burrito: Really good portion for a burrito not from Chipotle. Loaded with crisp peppers and onions along with flavorful beans and rice. The salsas they serve on the side are solid. Salsa roja has a good kick and is really flavorful. Salsa verde is served in the restaurant in a squirt bottle and I could put it on anything loved the tomatillo flavor.  My only gripe was I asked for it with no sour cream once (take-out) and they put sour cream. I'd check before on take-out because that put a damper for sure. Veggie Sopes (Dinner): This is my new go to, similar to a taco but is a thicker base that has some layers to it. Like any good mexican place, it is piled high with rice, beans, some lettuce, veggies, and a healthy helping of avocado. I got sour cream in this as well for another take-out order, so that wasn't too pleasing. Veggie Tostada: Similar to the sope, but a fried tortilla instead. Piled high so it can be a little difficult to eat without a fork and knife.  My only real gripe was the two times that they messed up my order for the sour cream, also the beans are little on the mushy side, would've liked a little more texture to them.

Could've been seasoned better, it was a little on the watery side for my liking.  Ok, now for the food. I ordered a special burrito.. I forgot the exact name but it was supposed to come with avocados, sour cream and cheese. Those were the ingredients that made it special. My friend ordered 3 tacos, 2 asada, 1 chicken.  Both dishes came out at the same time..First and foremost.. this thing is huge. One of the biggest burritos I have seen at a restaurant.  I took a couple bites of my burrito and immediately noticed that it was lacking avocado... thats fine. To be honest I could only get through half of my burrito because it was so huge. I found that the carne asada pieces were diced too small, a little on the saltier side, and overcooked to my liking.

My guy was under the weather so he opted for a soup with three tacos on the side (this guy) & and I went with the large shrimp cocktail and one taco. Our food was hot and ready within a timely manner. I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail but felt there was too much sauce that made it almost soup-y. The tacos were bomb!  I always appreciate a good taco! Our server was very sweet and made sure we were taken care of. I felt bad for her because she was the only one in the restaurant. Even during down times, it always good to have staff on the floor.

Most of the restaurants in the area were pretty crowded and had wait times. We needed a place where we could come in out of the cold and just relax until she got there. 2 Amigos had seats to spare. First, I have to say they were wonderfully accommodating. We told them it would be an hour or so until the fourth in our party arrived. Some restaurants say to wait until your whole party arrives. Not here - we were given our choice of seats.  Since we did not want to eat until she arrived, we ordered soft drinks. ]They also brought chips and salsa to the table. Their dished salsa was red and mildly spicy. They also had a tomatillo salsa in a bottle that was very good. We also ordered a large bowl of guacamole. It was very plain - they really don't add much to the avocado. But, that was fine with me - it was fresh and quite good. The waitress was very attentive, bringing refills as needed. When our daughter finally arrived, we ordered our meals. Their menu is pretty extensive - traditional Americanized Mexican fare, but they do have goat and lingua on the menu. I opted for a steak torta with fries. The fries were good - hand cut. They were a little undercooked, but with the very large sandwich, I decided I would not ask them to crisp them up. The torta was good, but I have to say I've had better. They were generous with the beans but a little skimpy on the meat. I found the meat to be a little tough too. All in all, not bad, but I have had better. In general, their service was much better than their food. But their guac was very good and shouldn't be missed.",0.9945,0.817,0.168,0.014,0.5357264957264958

It hasn't been remodeled too recently. But, it seemed fairly well-maintained for its age. I didn't check out the bathroom though. The restaurant was only about a 1/4 filled. Service was good. They provide complimentary chips and salsa.  My friend and I both had the 3 taco plate with rice and beans. It came out pretty quickly. The rice and beans were pretty standard. The tacos were good. I had one of each of the following: chicken, ground beef, and steak. I thought the chicken could have used some seasoning, the ground beef was okay. The steak taco was definitely the best.  We also had a large order of guacamole. It was good. It was a big portion for two people though. In retrospect, a small would have been better.  The chips are good too.

I was in the search for cheap food when I can't make it to the grocery store. Now, I go here at least once a week because I love them so much! The steak is seasoned well and the three items I listed are not greasy. It's difficult to find a taqueria that isn't!  Combined with these three items, the red salsa really shines! You've never had a salsa like this. The gourmet stuff at Big Star and at Rick Bayless restaurants is fun but sometimes I want a classic done right. The garlic in the salsa gives a creamy flavor which works well with the sweet tomatoes. Sometimes the salsa is extremely mild, sometimes medium, sometimes very spicy but usually medium. This is kinda cool because it is all made on site and the season determines he heat of the jalapeños in the salsa. I will bring a 32oz of this stuff home a week because it's soooo good!!! I list three items to try because everything else is alright. Nothing amazing but still cheap and good. Their guac is horrible and I wish they would make it differently because we would order it all the time. It seems like they put it in the blender because of the foamy, toothpaste texture. I personally like a creamy guac.  My boyfriend and I love the waitresses. We chat and get to know each other. They know how to choose good girls!

My wife thought it was average, my daughter hardly ate (though we believe now she just doesn't like Mexican cuisine very much). I ordered what looked to be a house specialty. ""Guisado de Puerco con Chile Rojo."" I believe this might have been what took so long to prepare as the other things we ordered were standard taco/relleno type things.

While Rev's a great place, screw it, and come to 2 Amigos. I've been here several times, and have had Flautas, tacos, a burrito, and enchiladas. Everything I've had has been great. The Al Pastor they have here is great, as is the carne asada, pollo, and barbacoa. You get 4 flautas or enchiladas in and order, pretty good portion size I must say.  The burrito is ""their specialty,"" and I can see why. It's goddamned HUGE, and really cheap. My only issue is the inclusion of too much inside. I'm a fairly huge adherent to the idea of burrito = meat, onions, cilantro...maybe cheese, maybe a slap of beans, but maybe on both, and never anything more. These guys stuff their burrito with lettuce, tomato, and I believe sour cream as well. All that stuff is GOOD, don't get me wrong, I just don't care for it in a burrito.

When I'm looking for decent Mexican food that's a step up from the 24 hour taco joints but not anything fancy, this is where I go. Some nights the food is great, and other nights it can be questionable. The prices are odd: $6 for a taco dinner, but $8 for the nachos appetizer? Really? Oh well, guess I'm skipping the nachos. Stick to tacos and burritos and you'll do okay.",0.8156,0.812,0.122,0.066,0.4683150183150183
2007-12-11,5.0,"I'm all for Mexican food, but this place is just so darn good! The girls were I work got food from there- so I went along with. The inside decor in this place is AWESOME. It's very '70s retro with all the wood carvings and such. And the huge Aztec paintings are gorgeous! But about the food.... I got the Vegetarian burrito- no cheese, no sour cream (I'm a vegitarian, and that's just the way I like it) I was so excited when I got this humongous thing. And even more excited when I found more than just the basics inside. Green beans, corn, carrots, lima beans....all on top of the basic beans, rice, tomatoes, and lettuce. And man- it was delicious! I went back with my husband later in the week to sit down for a meal there. The place was pretty empty- but there were some cops there (that's how you KNOW the foods good) ;) I got the same thing- hoping it would be as good, and he got 3 tacos- two ground beef, 1 steak. We got the basic chips and salsa as we sat and waited- but when the food came- oh man. The burrito was even bigger than I remembered, and tastier too. The tacos- my husband said were AMAZING. Together- we've both eaten a whole lot of Mexican food in Chicago- but I gotta say- this one is definitely one of- if not our favorite.",0.9957,0.735,0.226,0.039,0.5082465277777778
2007-11-25,1.0,"I used to be a big fan of this place but after a recent visit, I don't think I will be going back anytime soon. The restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere and very friendly service.  You get unlimted (sometimes very stale) chips and salsa for the table.  The salsa is pretty spicy, which is pretty nice. However, the food itself is where things get a little rough for me.  It seems that every dish they have has the same main ingredients but just ordered differently. Example: A Chicken Burrito has Chicken, Lettuce, Cheese, Tomato, Pico De Gallo & Sour Cream. A Chicken Taco has Lettcue, Cheese, Chicken, Sour Cream, Tomato & Pico De Gallo. A Chicken Torta has Pico De Gallo, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Chicken & Sour Cream (only this time it's served on some plain white bun.) You get the picture. Further more, it doesn't even taste good.  If you are going there because it's late and you haven't eaten in a few days and have a shoe string budget, 2 Amigos will get the job done.  But I wouldn't opt to go there otherwise. Overall verdict:  DENIED.",0.9454,0.835,0.124,0.041,0.5395461309523809
2007-10-23,5.0,This place has great food and friendly service.  My only complaint is it takes quite a while to get my food.  For all you MENUDO & POZOLE lovers... this place serves it up 7 days a week.  By far this has the best Mexican food.,0.8834,0.73,0.227,0.043,0.5357142857142857
2007-09-15,3.0,"Well another Mexican joint that we've come to in Logan Square.  The exterior was kind of misleading like the other poster said but inside was kind of nice.  The service was kind of slow, I think we got there during a shift change and the girl who was our waitress was leaving so she wasn't very prompt with helping us.  The chips and salsa aren't very good, but it tries really hard to make up for it in the spicy category.  I got the bistec a la mexicana, not bad but not all that great either.  I like the atmosphere here and I like the excessively loud Mexican music, but the food isn't going to bring me here instead of going to Taqueria Moran around the corner.",0.7975,0.775,0.141,0.084,0.580888888888889
2007-08-30,4.0,"I went here once and it frankly wasn't very good.  Came back a couple more times, and I gotta say that I must have hit an off night because the food has been freakin' excellent since!  Fast 'n good, extra cilantro, good quality meat (for a mexican joint anyway).  Wife says the veggie burrito is outtasight, I dunno as I like to eat things that had a mom.   Worth a stop if it's after midnight on a weekend.  Seems pretty carry out oriented, but the interior is quite nice...much more than you'd expect.  One downside: the guacamole is freakin' terrible, tastes like it came out of the can.",-0.4725,0.778,0.097,0.125,0.5215384615384615
2007-06-25,4.0,"If you are a vegitarian, try the avacado tosdas..the best I have had in Chicago.  Heaps of Avacado, delicous beans, s.c and cheese.  My boyfriend had a huge steak burrito..delicous.  I agree with the earlier comments on the chips and salsa(not the best) but check out this spot for the funky interor.",0.5267,0.853,0.116,0.031,0.5
2007-06-06,4.0,"Once I got over my ""sketchy-exterior"" factor and went in, I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually a neat little place on the inside. I should actually say ""neat place that's deceptively big."" A lot of tables, but I never saw more than a handful in use... they must do a good carry-out business. That's actually all I used them for. All in all, I'll give them more points for convenience. They were close to my apartment and open late. Plus, in relation to Moran around the corner, I'll give the burrito edge to Amigos here. I think Moran has the better chips and salsa, though.  But like your many Mexican options in that neighborhood, it's pretty standard. I'd say they're a notch above the average. Good value.",0.9812,0.781,0.219,0.0,0.39999999999999997
2006-07-05,3.0,"I lived pretty much above this place for two years so it became a convenient late night taco place for us.  I like the skirt steak and the tacos, but the guacamole is not so great.  The chicken soup is delicious and huge, but the service can be very slow.  Nothing super special, but it was good due to its convenience.",0.9601,0.62,0.31,0.071,0.6694246031746033
2006-03-23,3.0,"Just another cheap Mexican food place in Logan Square. Nothing special. The burritos are HUGE however, and pretty good. Watch out, though... I've found a chicken bone on two seperate occasions in the burritos, so bite with care. Oh yeah, and just go ahead and bring your own chips cause theirs are no bueno.",0.936,0.7,0.266,0.033,0.7151785714285714
