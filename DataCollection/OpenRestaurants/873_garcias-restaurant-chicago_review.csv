Wait time on a Wednesday night was 30 minutes for a party of six despite the restaurant being fairly large. Once seated, only the first modest basket of chips are free, although both the chips and salsa were quite good. The pitcher of margarita is the way to go, with glasses arriving already a little filled and then a big ole jug that has enough for almost 10 servings. Tacos lengua and al pastor were lackluster, but the tortilla soup was excellent - hearty, richly flavored broth with plentiful tortilla strips, avocado, and chunks of chewy cheese. Added chicken yielded a modest amount of shredded chicken. It's a good spot to have comforting Mexican fare with friends.",0.9798,0.806,0.194,0.0,0.6243764172335601

2017-06-14,2.0,"I have to say I've been living in this area for several years and have frequented Garcia's on occasion. Unfortunately I just can't recommend this to someone.  While my boyfriend does like their steak burritos, which are big, I always find their food a bit lacking. Their beans and rice aren't very good and neither is there ground beef. The carne asada is probably a better item to get in your meal although the chicken is decent. However I will say one of the reasons we stopped going here is because of the service. We used to order out a lot from here, and on a very recent occasion we decided to give them a try again. We called in at an off-hour and ordered are two burritos. After picking them up and bringing them home I realize that my chicken burrito was actually filled with ground beef, since I didn't want ground beef, and it was in fact extraordinary Bland, I tried to call back several times on the phone to let them know about their mistake.  Four times I called and four times the phone run and without any word was hung up on me. I found this so frustrating that I actually packed up my one bite taken burrito and took it back. While they did make me a new burrito they did not seem very sorry or concerned about their error. Or their lack of customer service. I must say after that experience I was all the more angry about the fact that we had just paid 20 some dollars for these two meal items and I felt like I was doing them a favor by bringing a back and allowing them to make me another one. I don't think the girl I talked to you ever actually said she was sorry for the mistake either. She blamed it on the new computer systems even though she showed me a receipt that properly showed that they had coded my food correctly as chicken.  Poor customer service really gets me so add that on top of only average food and I think we definitely won't be heading here anytime soon again.",-0.9394,0.86,0.049,0.091,0.5383057851239669

The restaurant is nestled in the heart of Lincoln Square, so there are plenty of little shops to browse through and pubs to grab a drink in the neighborhood. Garcia's felt cozy with a huge live Christmas tree and holiday decorations still hung about. The crowd mostly consisted of groups of friends drinking pitchers of margaritas or large families splitting plates of food. There wasn't a wait and we were seated right away and immediately got fresh salsa and chips delivered to our table. It was my first time at Garcia's, but my boyfriend had been a few times for late night food and drinks.  With so many delicious options to choose from, I had to go with ""Chicago's Best Burrito"". It was a huge burrito filled with steak, al pastor, refried beans, avocado, cheese, lettuce and sour cream. While I'm not sure I can say it was the ""best"" burrito I have ever had, it was very satisfying. Even though it was enough food for 2 people, we each ordered our own and only had a few bites remaining. We did not get drinks that night because we were heading to a bar after, but we had more than enough food for less than $30.

I asked her to make sure we were not charged for the extra ingredients we ordered that were not put into the meal.  All we got was ""oh they didn't put it in there?""  It was not  on the bill, but nothing further as far as an apology etc.  On another small note,  I find it odd that they bring you room temperature water with no ice in it, but that's not that big a deal.  Pretty disappointing. Now there's a real reason we won't be back in the near future. For as many Mexican restaurants as there are in Chicago, poor service is a deal breaker that will make us pass up Garcia's for sure going forward.",-0.7753,0.861,0.06,0.079,0.4334175084175084

But what was very disappointing was the service. Our server was so cold and rude from the minute we sat down. It was not busy at all for us to have been ignored the way we were the entire night. No water refills--nothing. We were not checked on for over an hour. For us to have to wave down a busboy to bring us our check after trying to leave for more than half an hour says a lot. Then to not only have our check brought to us by a random employee but told to go pay in front when ready was even more insulting. I recommended this place to friends. It was their first time. After this terrible service we experienced, I looked like a fool, and there's no chance of us coming back. It was one of the worst dining experiences ever. Enough for us to just be upset by the end of the night. What good is it to have good food if the service is absolutely terrible? It is very upsetting because we're not a rude group of people. We're very polite to our servers and tip well! I don't know who our server was because I saw her about two times. Our ticket said ""Mayra"".",-0.974,0.709,0.103,0.188,0.6118148148148149
2016-07-02,1.0,"I've been to Garcia's maybe a dozen times over the past two years because it's in the neighborhood and close to other places I'm visiting. The food - when you get what you order in a timely fashion - is pretty good. But getting what you order the first time is pure luck at best, and you might as well forget ""timely"" because it's simply not going to happen. Case in point is this past Friday's visit. Arrived at 5pm so the crowd wasn't all that busy yet. Party of 2 seated quickly with menus. Five minutes goes by and we finally get water, chips and silverware. Another five minutes goes by and no server. After flagging down one of the chip-and-water folks server finally appears. We order iced tea for drinks (having been burned in the past by REALLY LONG waits for alcohol), guacamole as an appetizer, my date orders two tacos, I order a burrito dinner with cheese and green sauce. No modifications, no special anything. Guacamole arrives fairly quickly and was tasty, but we ran out of chips and had to wait for a re-up. 15 minutes go by and finally entrees arrive. My date's was fine, my burrito came out with no sauce on it and no cheese. Sent it back and my date is pretty much done by the time mine came back. No surprise...it's now lukewarm but has melted cheese on it. At this point we're almost an hour into an extremely mediocre dining experience and have better things to do so I ate it cold. We arrived just after 5 and left around 6:15pm - over an hour for a meal that was only marginally better than what you'd get at a walk-up burrito shack...and definitely more expensive and angst-filled. This visit was typical of what I've experienced at Garcia's over the past two years. I've had appetizers come after the meal began. I've had drink orders completely botched. I've had service take so long that we've had to leave before eating to make a movie time. The ONLY reason I've returned is friends or convenience and misplaced hope that they'll finally get it right. But after last night Garcia's is off my list unless friends insist. Even though the food isn't bad it's just not worth the time, expense and anxiety just to get a burrito.",0.9843,0.839,0.113,0.048,0.5109964726631393

They have an outdoor patio which is first come first serve, which we waited about 15min for (not that bad considering the place was PACKED inside and out). I feel like they give a whole lot more attention to the people inside considering we waited about 20min just to order drinks. After receiving food it took about 30min to get a hold of our waitress just so we can get another glass of water. Food wise- the prices are reasonable, my friend got a chicken burrito that he loved for $7, another chicken breast plate for $12 and I got the chicken fajitas (we love our chicken, clearly!) for $16. While I do think my plate was a bit unreasonable compared to the others. One thing I thought was pretty unusual was the price tag of the drinks, considering a chicken breast plate was $12 and the margarita we had was $12.50.  So, all in all its a nice place to attend with friends if the weather is reasonable because I'd recommend the patio way more than the inside (it is summer after all).

2016-06-22,1.0,"I come to Garcia's on a semi-regular basis, and last night was possibly one of the worst experiences ever. A gal and I wanted to come have some margaritas and maybe an appetizer and met around 9. I got there earlier, and found a tall 2-top in the bar area that I was told I could sit at. Waitresses pass by, no one acknowledging my presence. After 8 minutes one finally came up - and verbatim asked me ""are you ready to order"" No, I just got here and was waiting for you. I put in my drink order, but said I was waiting for someone else. Drink came out slow ( but the bar was packed so that I'll excuse). Anyways, it was very busy and loud for a Tuesday night - and while I'm glad they are doing so well, service was lacking big time. When my friend arrived, we asked if we could move outside. I know this can sometimes be a process transferring checks to other servers/moving etc...but all we'd collectively ordered was one drink at that time, so the amount of attitude I received about it was thoroughly unnecessary. Rude, rude, waitress.  So after we were outside, it was quick to realize service would be just as bad as inside, just quieter. It became clear there was only one server outside, and I totally sympathize with feeling overwhelmed in a restaurant job. That being said, she was inattentive, and particularly forgetful with us. Everything took WAY too long. My friend asked for a drink menu, and that came almost 10 minutes later. Cue to 10 minutes following that when our orders were taken. I got the ceviche, which I always love there, and that was no disappointment, but when we felt ready to leave and move on from the poor service, even that wasn't quick. I asked for a container for my ceviche, and this time 10 minutes passed before she acknowledged that she forgot the container, cue to another 5-10 minutes before I got said container. Other tables around us got their food orders in and on the table before I got my container...but I digress (this has nothing to do with the wonderful, fast kitchen at Garcias - always a great experience with that staff). This was about the server and service.  I am aware that business can make a food service overwhelming and slow, but it clearly wasn't across the board. The glacial pace was SO disappointing, and went without acknowledgment or apology. If I was serving like that, I would've been apologizing profusely, but she hardly left us with even a thank you. Sandra, an acknowledgment would've gone a LONG way with us, but we left really disappointed. If it was because we ordered drinks and an appetizer, and not entrees...that's too bad, and should be somewhat predicted with patio season. Every customer is important.

Literally dozens of different waiters, busboys, and hostesses walked by during that time, and no one even bothered to greet us or tell us someone would be with us a in a moment. Finally, after 10 minutes of just standing there looking like idiots, some random woman who's sweeping asks me if we've been helped. I say no. She goes and gets the hostess. The hostess tells me, it's going to be a 25 minute wait, is that ok? I say ok. She puts my name on her list. 50 MINUTES GO BY. We still have yet to be seated. By bf hunts down the hostess and asks her, ""You told us it was going to be 25 minutes, now it's been 50 minutes, when are we going to be seated?"" (at this point we're both starving).

So, parking for two hours was about $4 and better than circling the block endlessly searching for parking.  Inside Garcia's - definitely not a place if you're seeking a quiet romantic meal lit by candlelight. Very loud! Lots of families and children! But also scads of Méxicans dining there, so it must be good Méxican food, right? Definitely. This was some truly excellent cuisine. The menu is large but manageable. We chose horchata, tacos (beef and chicken with a variety of toppings), a burrito that we split, and they bring out chips and salsa at the beginning. One thing I really liked was that they brought small plates with this, thus eliminating the ""community salsa bowl"" which I find kind of gross when there are multiple diners at the table. The chips were great and didn't taste ""mass produced served from a bag"" as is the case in some Méxican places.  The main courses were excellent.

Margaritas on the other hand were pretty great - I opted for the Don Julio version ($13) which was absolutely huge - at least a 1/2 liter's worth. And there was plenty of liquor in there too, so yay!

Hey we don't live near 18th street so we got to do what we got to do.  Chicken soup is wonderful and steak is good-but only if you like it greasy which unfortunately I do. :-) They are kind of stingy too. We went there with my grandma for a birthday lunch and they did nothing for her despite the fact they knew it was her birthday.

After we were seated, we order our usual margaritas. We then proceed to order our dinner, she orders enchiladas with STEAK, and salsa verde. I order a steak burrito with cheese.  15 to 20 minutes pass by. Order comes in and they messed up her order. Her enchiladas came out with ground beef in them. No apology, a simple, ""oh, you ordered steak?"" Maybe if she listened to her when she was takin our order, she would've got it right from the beginning. STRIKE 1! My burrito looked so good. Just as I'm about to dig in, I started to eat the rice and beans... Bad mistake... See pictures for reference. I uploaded them on here. I took a fork full of rice and beans, I got this weird texture in my mouth, lo and behold it was a damn piece of HAIR!!! STRIKE 2. I wanted to vomit and throw my plate across the room. I was calm, didn't make a scene. Waitress was not checking in on us so had my wife go to the manager to take care of this careless mistake. She comes over and quickly apologized and said she will take care of this meal... So they quickly took it off the table and made me another one. I couldn't even finish it because I was already in shock from the previous plate... Now our check arrives, not only were they charging us for everything, the waitress never visited us again after that incident. Talk about awesome customer service huh? STRIKE 3!  If you are still reading this, you must know how I feel by now. We told the waitress to talk to the manager and she said she was gonna take care of it. She says sorry and walks off to talk to the manager. She comes back with the bill and they ONLY took the burrito out and even charged me for the cheese. (sarcastic laughing) Can you believe this $hit?  I'm done. That was it. I told myself I'm not going to write or post the evidence on here if they properly took care of this incident.

We walk in and its about 5 tables that were being occupied.  I'm thinking great its not that crowded.  Usually when we walk in and get seated we get water and chips and salsa. I'm sitting and no one came by my table. I'm like ok we are on lunch so hopefully someone will come by soon. Well I grabbed one of the waitresses and asked who was our waitress.  She immediately got offended and said we are busy (yes that is what she said). You just got here.  I'm said oh noooo can I speak to the manager. She said I am the manager and I said you are a terrible manager.  Who is the owner? She said I am the owner. What a terrible owner!!! I explained how rude she was and she kept right saying that they are busy etc. She took our order and left. I asked another waiter for chips and salsa. Our food came and I swear they must have given me the burnt meat. At that time I didn't have anymore energy to complain. My friend who was dining with me asked for napkins and she got them 10 minutes later!!! Just so you know I was about 15 minutes late getting back to work.  Thank you Garcia's for a terrible lunch.  You wont be seeing me for a while.  Hopefully by the winter the waitresses/manager/owner know how to talk and treat their customers,0.6854,0.824,0.094,0.082,0.5303571428571427

You think salsa is always good? Almost, that's true, but the salsa at Garcia's is fresh, balanced with tomato and other onion, and cilantro, and you get little slices of jalapeno that give each bite a bit of zing! Chicken mole? You won't finish it, but the chicken is flavorful and NOT dry. The mole? What mole should be, piquant, spicy, and hard to decipher. The beans and rice--I didn't leave them on the plate. My husband ordered the skirt steak--tender, grilled to his ""rare"" specification, and wonderfully tasty the next day when we had it thinly sliced on the left over tortillas. So let's get to the least memorable part of most Mexican restaurants: the tortillas. The corn and the flour tortillas were both worth fighting for. Regarding the huge margaritas. Delicious but huge.

I've gotten the tortilla soup before and it was tasty, but I am picky so I would have enjoyed it better if I hadn't gotten the avocado, cheese, and cilantro.

2015-05-16,2.0,"Our party of three went last night. One of us had never been, one goes semi-regularly, and I used to be a weekly visitor about 5 years ago until my job took me elsewhere. As we were going in, we were warned by my friend who is a regular now that the food is fast and good, but they have a bad attitude. We laughed it off. Based on the food and strawberry margarita alone, this should be a four star review, but the roller coaster food and service was too much. (In the sequence in which the following occurred) Con 1- The water tasted like tequila. Now, we have three varying personalities and taste palettes, but everyone took one sip, and all came to the same conclusion, and we didn't touch it again for the rest of the night. (Although my friend was convinced that  water with tequila essence is the newest craze in flavored water and we just didn't get the memo yet) Con 2- Something wasn't right with the salsa. One bite and it was a wrap. Con 3- The mango margarita was horrible. I think it might have been blended improperly but it tasted like concentrated mango powder and was grainy. We NEVER send food or drinks back, but at this point the gag reflex was in effect (we couldn't even wash it down with water or get the taste out of our mouths with chips and salsa which made it worse), so we politely (and quietly) asked to speak to our server. Which brings me to... Con 4- After arguing with us about their processes in making the margarita, he said he ""would try and see what he could do"" but warned us if it wasn't right that time, ""that's it"" basically saying we would be stuck with a bad drink and have to deal with it. Pro 1- The strawberry margarita was happiness in a glass. Superb. Whatever mix they used was very fresh. Pro 2- The food was piping hot and delicious. Pro 3- The bathrooms were clean. I can overlook less than ideal service for really great food and vice versa. I would go back here because I'm *hoping* this was just a bad night for them and that their usual status quo is the awesomeness of 5 years ago. I'll give it another go at some point in the future and update this accordingly, but after last night and 45 min before one redeeming feature to the evening, I'm afraid my two stars must stand for the time being.",0.9715,0.805,0.118,0.077,0.4642598142598142

I've worked in the food  industry for 16 yrs and am normally a great tipper, but if you purse your lips at me while I'm trying to ask for something as small a straw (which they keep in their apron pocket)...it's bound to knock a couple of dollars from your tip.     Also the food was really greasy to the point that my husband couldn't properly eat his burrito. He had to dump everything out and eat the filling with a fork. If he wanted a taco salad, I'm sure he would have ordered one. Even my tacos were drippier than usual. My husband ordered a long island and all you could taste was tequila. He had to order a coke just mix it together to make it slightly more drinkable.       Not sure if we will go back...might save our selves the drive and go down the street to Taco Burrito King.

2015-04-06,1.0,"WHOAH!!! What a disappointment......I don't even know where to start, I'll take it from right when my family walks in, we had a ""reservation"" for 11:00am for Easter brunch and as my uncle comes through the door he gets stared down by a staff member who clearly was not expecting anyone at that time without even a hello, my uncle then tells the ""hostess"" or whatever she was that we had a reservation for 11:00am and she kept asking really? Are you sure? because I don't see anything on my end to confirm that......I guess all 7 of us could've fabricated this ""reservation"" in our minds right?......anyway the place was empty ok, and by empty I mean there were only two occupied tables in the whole restaurant from what we could see, those of you who have been here know how many tables were left over, A LOT! So why even question a reservation for a party of 7 given the availability which is just a logical conclusion one can reach by observing all open tables at the time right? Judging from the waitress's rude, short & dry attitude it wasn't acceptable in this establishment to compromise on matters such as these and acted as if it were a favor to seat my family, so it's safe to say that the service was HORRIBLE straight out the gates..... Anyway let's get to the part where the most inauthentic and insulting poor excuse for a Mexican breakfast was served. My mother and I decide to order the same classic Mexican breakfast ""Huevos Rancheros"", upon taking our order the waitress asks in a very impatient and almost annoyed tone "" how do you want your eggs? Medium or rare? "" as if it were a steak we are talking about instead of ""over easy"" or ""sunny side up"" which are the only appropriate options for eggs to be served on this dish ok...whatever medium is fine I guess. We also ordered queso fundido right, yeah ok, more like a skillet filled with those three cheese ""Mexican"" premixed bags you can find in any dairy section at your local grocery store, not melted or ""fundido"" enough to the point where you could almost see the individual shreds of cheese at the top, and the tortilla container came with 5 tortillas at a time ok......yes 5 tortillas for a party of 7. Anyway after a couple of refills on the strict 5 tortilla filled containers in comes the main serving, and that's when I lost all hope for enjoying the meal, I was served what looked like poached eggs, but unlike poached eggs cooked ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!! My best description was a poached then boiled egg but let's move on. The ""salsa ranchera"" was more like watered down tomato sauce with big chunks of what  I'm pretty sure were bell peppers which are at the very least IRRELEVANT in this dish much like the salt shaker was in the preparation of such. But hold on tight for here comes the best part, ready? THEY LEFT OUT THE OTHER HALF OF THIS MEAL which consists of a fried tortilla at the bottom of each egg OK?!..........yes they did. This led me to believe that there was some kind of tortilla shortage in the place given the strictly 5pc filled containers and the missing ones in my dish. My mother and I give each other this look like EWKAY..... you gonna try it first? So I dig into this abortion and couldn't go further than eating one egg and a bit of beans.......that was it.  My mother also discarded the meal as soon as the first few bites were taken, AWFUL!!! I had a couple of ""Micheladas"" and they were MEH at best which was the only thing keeping me afloat the whole time. I will NEVER return to this spot given it was my THIRD experience with them with no difference in any visit and I can assure you there was no charm in this third try.

Who knows.  However, I've been here a few time since my parents live nearby and I have to say the Shrimp Cocktail and their Tortas are Soooooooooooo good! However I can't say I have been here one time and received semi decent service.  Walk through the door and the host doesn't say hi but stares at us blankly until the awkward silence forces us to say we need a table so we can EAT.  We sit and wait ... And wait ... And wait some more until finally the ""order taker"" (not a waitress by my service standards because I'd never hire someone like this at any of my restaurants) comes and asks if we are ready to order. So we order a Don Julio Añejo and a Cadillac Margarita and of course a shrimp cocktail!  Wait some more (10-12 minutes) and finally get the drinks and food. But the Cadillac doesn't have that cognac-y taste the Grand Marnier usually provides so I assume they once again just gave me a regular margarita, so I asked the server what is in my margarita and she is clueless, So I ask for the shot on the side.

Really never had a bad meal and over the years this place has been getting better from service to food and renovating. Margaritas are really good and strong I love the combo plates or sometimes the camarones al mojo.  It's a little more expensive than most mexican resteraunts but it's worth it.  Salsa needs a little help.

Best things to order:  nachos, tacos, burritos, enchiladas - anything with refried beans.  Go for the nachos topped with al pastor, cilantro and onions - it's a meal for at least two people by itself.  (But of course you'll want to order more...).  I love the salsa - it's always fresh (which does also mean that the heat can really vary - if you don't like a little heat check first before you pour it on everything).  Horchata with a bit of cinnamon and great chicken soup if you're feeling sick. Disappointments:  I wish they'd up their game on the margaritas and at least offer one with freshly squeezed juice vs. the pre-made mix.  Guacamole has declined - I think they might have stopped making it in house.  Quality of the beef can vary - sometimes good, sometimes I get an awful lot of fatty bits - another reason I usually go with pork or chicken. Overall though, one of the best mexican bargains in town - also available at 2am.  And I don't know of anyone with better refried beans.",0.9864,0.698,0.209,0.093,0.496186755952381

2014-11-04,3.0,"I came here for a friend's birthday and maybe that was my first mistake. We had about 20 ish people at our table. I knew this was gonna be one of those super long dinners where you know nobody and splitting the bill is absolutely madness [i have the perfect remedy for that by the way, more on that later]. Anyway, chips and salsa were served at the table. Chips were good, the salsa was bad. They had only one type of salsa and it was mild/bland. I ate them ANYWAY. I was starving. // Traditional lime margarita - $6 - I will say that the margaritas are tasty and relatively strong. They have plenty of flavors. My girl friend got the coconut one. It was blended and far too sweet. We had to send it back. The traditional one was pretty good. triple sec, lime and tequila.  What I really liked about it was that you could actually taste the tequila. So often you order a margarita and it is so much sugar, you can't taste the burnnnnn. It was not overwhelming at all, it was right.  // Al pastor Burrito - $7.50 - Initially they brought me out the wrong burrito. :-( But they were pretty quick to bring out the correct one. I actually really  enjoy it. I order avocado in my burrito as well. It was great. It was even better the following day. The burritos are huge as well! so definitely worth getting.  The service was at times unbearable. They brought our checks one by one for like 6 people on one side of the table, then they put the remainder of us [8 ppl] on to one check. AND it took FOREVER. I used my trusty iPhone app ""Tab""  and it saved my life. AS IT ALWAYS DOES. If you have not downloaded it, you should never go out to eat with a group of people again. You can send me a message later and thank me :-)  I would most likely go back to this place. As long as it wasn't a huge group of people and they do have outdoor seating.

Much cozier and they don't charge the 75 cents extra for the sauces for the tacos I opted for instead. Extra charge for salsa? Without disclosing before charging?

2014-06-11,1.0,"It was on a Saturday night after the Chicago Rib Fest on Lincoln Avenue when my beautiful lady friend and myself came in for a drink. We walked straight to the bar area where we found a tall two top. The menus arrived along with thin and crispy nachos with salsa and we began to explore the drink menu. We had both decided to just have a glass of wine that night. White wine was ordered for the lady and a glass of red for myself. There were around six of each wine to choose from. There were a few Malbecs, a Tempranillo, and a Syrah for red wines and the usual Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Riesling to choose from in the white wines category. We ordered the Argentinian Syrah along with a Riesling also that were around $8 per glass. It was very warm and stuffy inside the bar area which made me impatient and uncomfortable after a few minutes of waiting for our glasses of wine. I had turned my attention to the bar tender, who seemed to be in the weeds, when I watched him open the cabinet where their wine seemed to be stored. I had quickly noticed that there was only two bottles in that cabinet, one red, one white, and both were Barefoot wines! Now by this time, the white was already poured and I saw that he was now reaching for a red wine. I thought to myself ""Please do not try to serve me Barefoot Shiraz in lieu of the Syrah from Argentina that I had ordered "". And wouldn't you know it, Barefoot was poured and the glasses were brought over to us. The waitress became flummoxed when I asked her about why I was being served the wrong wine. She walked back to the bar and talked to the bartender and she came back to the table saying, ""He ran out of the other wine, so he was serving the Barefoot wine instead"".  The waitress claimed to have had no idea that the bartender was deceiving people with $4 a bottle wine. The waitress offered to give us the wine at a discount but we had seen enough. We got up and walked out and never to return.       Basically, they will pour you a Barefoot wine instead of the actual wine that you ordered from off the menu that seemingly isn't even in stock at the bar. It is not ethical or even legal to try and dupe a customer for any reason. I RECOMMEND EVERYONE STEER CLEAR AND TO AVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!",0.5205,0.9,0.055,0.045,0.36461111111111105

So I went with a group of four and two of them ordered the Chicago's Best Burrito which was HUGE and covered in yummy cheese. My self and one other person ordered the Combo with an enchilada, taco, and tostada that came with rice and beans. EVERYONE loved their food!

2014-05-03,1.0,"My partner and I went to this place on a Friday night.  We were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table (even though there were about 5 empty tables within sight).  So, we decided to wait it out at the bar.  There were not any seats at the bar when we arrived so we stood close to the bar.  The bartenders ignored us even though I waived to notify one of then we would like service.  He acknowledged me but never came to take our order.  10 minutes later two chairs opened up so we took them and waited.  While we waited the bartenders cleared off the glasses from the prior customers right in front of us and wiped the area down but never took our order or gave us menus.  We waited more....  Then a bartender came around the bar next to us dragging a bar stool, ordered us to shove ourselves to the right to make room for a female's friend who had been standing by her.  After crowding us in the male patron declined the stool so the bartender dragged it back to where it came...still no bartender to take our order.  We waited and asked the female beside us is she had to wait this long...she said she was served almost immediately.  The bartenders were talking behind the bar to each other and did not seem busy enough to ignore us because of limitations on their time.  After 15 minutes of waiting and much frustration, we raised our hands and yelled, 'can you see us"", at which point one of the bartenders cane over and threw down the drink menus in front of us.  At that point, we decided we might be in the midst of some homophobia and left the bar area to talk to the manager.  The manager insisted they did not discriminate against gays and went toi talk to the bartenders about the situation. When he came back he said the bartenders had been busy.  He said he would review the tapes and see what actually happened.  I gave him my name and phone number and asked him to give me a call once he saw the video of the situation.  To date, I've not heard from him .  Take your business to a local eatery that appreciates your business.  We ended up going to another Mexican restaurant (even though the manager had offered us a meal on him because of our frustration).  I don't need handouts; I just need good service and am willing to pay for it.  We will never go back to this place as they need to monitor their employees behavior better and maybe give them some training in customer service and sensitivity training for minorities.",0.7966,0.92,0.045,0.035,0.2645549886621315

First of all we get there and we are told the credit card machine is down...okay fair enough it happens right??...but what kind of restaurant does not have an ATM? It was annoying because my friend happens to be 8 1/2 months pregnant and we have to go walking down Lincoln Avenue to find an ATM so we could have money to pay our bill.  Secondly my friend arrived about 15 minutes prior to me getting there and I literally sit down for 15 seconds and the server is asking if I am ready to order...""um no I am not you can see I just sat here can I have a minute to look?!"" Not personable at all and just ready to take our order so we can get out of her hair it seemed. So after this happens I ask if we can have a mild salsa....then out comes something in a bowl  that was smoking literally from heat like a soup. What in the world??!! So then I order the 2 taco dinner...and I say ""dinner"". I told the server twice and when my food comes out no sides which are rice and beans. So I explain to her and she seems puzzled. Then she leaves comes back with the sides on a side dish not to mention the actual tacos were cold. If you screw up an order then you take all the food back to the kitchen you don't bring it out piece by piece.  After this happens I notice I also don't have any cheese or sour cream which I asked for. So again she comes out with the sides and just leaves them on the table. Seriously!!?? If I wanted to make my own tacos I would have cooked them at home. It was honestly so rediclous I finally told her to take it back and fix it ( which I never have done).  When we are finally finished eating she brings the bill so we give her both two twenty dollar bills and we  both had entrees under ten dollars and just soda so it brought our bill to  under 10 bucks. She comes back and gives us a ten and two fives. I also work in this industry and with a bill at that amount and the horrendous service she gave us you cannot possibly expect to think I was going to give you a $5 tip!!?? The whole experience was just beyond irratating.  The food was awful and the service sucked. I am really disappointed in this place, and considering that you majorly screwed up my order not once but TWICE....I was dumbfounded that she had the audacity to charge me for the ""sides"" which was supposed to come with what I ordered originally not to mention again we actually had to leave to go retrieve an ATM.

We both got enchiladas, with a mix of mole and verde sauce.  The mole sauce was... I guess bland?  They made up for it with volume, though.  I swear there was more sauce than enchiladas.  I spooned a vat of it over to the side of the plate so I could try to focus on what was left of the soggy enchiladas.  That would've been ok, but then dinner ended for both of us after just a few bites when I found a long curly hair in the food.  I found it by pulling it out of my mouth.  Yeah, not my hair, not my date's hair.  We don't have that color hair.  I'm assuming it was from the cooks, as it was well buried in the food.

2014-03-30,5.0,"My buddy and I drove out to this place to meet up with our party of around 20.  Driving north on  Lincoln Ave., my GPS said the location was on the right, but I wasn't able to spot it.  We decided to just find parking and walk down the street to see if we had missed it.  Let me warn you, parking was a pain in the bunghole.  We parked about 3-4 blocks away in the residential area and walked towards the area where the GPS said the restaurant was located.  Lo and behold, as we got closer, we saw a sign showing ""Garcia's"", placed way higher than the surrounding signage.  From the outside, the restaurant looked dimly lit, but I realized there was a little bit of tinting on the windows. Inside, the place was bigger than I thought it would be.  There were lots of people in there, but because of the size and layout, it never felt claustrophobic.  The walls were decorated with artwork, the tables and chairs looked of high quality, there were TV's in the bar area, and the people dining in seemed to be really enjoying themselves in the great ambiance.   After locating the party and sitting down(we were late because of parking and because we're Asian), my friends urged me to try the chips and green chili sauce.  Wow!  That was some spicy stuff!  And I loved it!  As I continued munching on some chips, I looked through the menus to figure out what I wanted to try.  I decided on the three taco combination, with pork as the meat choice.  I also chose to try the ginger margarita.  The server lady came by and took our orders and off she went.  About 5 minutes later, she brought me the ginger margarita.  It was waaaay bigger than I expected it to be, but at $11, I guess it was a perfect size to keep me satisfied throughout the dinner.  The first sip I took will be a moment I will never forget.  The sweet liquid glided over my tongue and set the stage for the subtle tartness to wake up my tastebuds.  As the sweet and tart flavors slowly faded away, the flavor of ginger showed itself in its mighty glory.  Everything was perfectly balanced and it put me in a blissful state of mind. During this whole dreamlike trance, I didn't realize that there was a whole bunch of servers and food runners crowding around me serving us our entrees.  They placed my three pork tacos in front of me, and I went at it.  The tacos looked small, but once I tried to pick them up, I realized that there was more meat and toppings piled on than I thought.  I added some salsa and the green chili sauce and took a bite.  It was so tasty!  The fresh tortillas looked like they were made in house, the pork was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the toppings were fresh and perfectly portioned.  The rice and beans that come with the combo were also very good.  Definitely good food! Throughout our dinner, the servers checked up on us and brought us anything and everything we asked for.  The service team was on top of everything and on point.  I would consider it top notch service! All in all, I have no complaints at all about this place.  The ambiance is great, the food is great, and the service is great.  My experience here was well worth the parking headaches and the long walk in the cold.  I'm going to bring my girl here one day so I can share this great experience with her.  Try this place out if you haven't already!",0.9989,0.784,0.182,0.034,0.5572027858762554

I ordered the Combination numero uno, which was two enchiladas and one Chile Relleno. This was about as ""meh"" as meh can get. I probably could get better Mexican food or enchiladas, at least, from my Lutheran aunt in Iowa.

2014-02-28,1.0,"My wife and I have been eating at Garcia's for years, one of our favorites in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, the last couple of visits have been uncharacteristic. This evening's experience has ruined it for me.... It's time for me to find another hotspot.  I've noticed recently that the restaurant has started to accept reservations, but management has failed at executing the transition. The hostess' are more concerned with following the instructions of their iPad app than using common sense. When we arrived 7:08, there were a handful of 2-tops available (requested table for 2 adults and high chair) with ample room for a high chair, based on past precedent, it was common for Garcia's to use the two-tops for our small family. There was an empty four-top, and a table set for a large party. The hostess quoted a 30 minute wait time, and said that we would receive a text when our table was ready. It seemed odd that there were so many empty tables, and so many guests waiting for a table, but the app must have said there were reservations a few minutes away. A few of the tables were filled with couple's finishing up at the bar, the four-top was filled by two couples dining together, and then more table's opened up. My wife asked if we could sit at one of the tables that had been open for over 10 minutes, but the hostess said they were waiting to fill with ""people that made reservations"".  We patiently waited for 20-30 more minutes, starring at empty chairs and tables, at this point we had invested 30-40 minutes entertaining our 2 year old. I was reciting scenarios in my head of what I would say when they decided to seat us at the empty table I had been standing next to; one that would be slightly inappropriate, a few that would show severe sarcasm, and then another where I would really let loose if I had the guts. I kept my cool and asked the hostess if she could check on our name. She couldn't find our name and said that we would have to wait another 20-30 minutes. I'm obviously in line, you asked for my number and I have a text welcoming me to Garcia's. I didn't lose it, but I did express that I didn't understand why I had just waited close to 45 minutes for a table, after being quoted 30 minutes, and then asked to wait another 20... while there was a table open the ENTIRE time. Stop checking your app, use your head. It's likely these ""people who made reservations"" did not show. It's tough for me to not play the parent role here, but I necessary in this case to reiterate my position.  Thankfully, I was able to bundle my son up, help my wife with her coat, and get out of the restaurant without embarrassing my wife and saying something rude. The hostess did say she was sorry for the inconvenience as we left. Moot point.  We crossed the street and enjoyed a nice dinner at the Italian joint, Trattoria Trullo. As we sat down, the Garcia's text came through. I guess my name had been entered! The food and service at Trattoria was fantastic, and the atmosphere was calming.

2014-02-03,1.0,"Our friends are regulars here at this restaurant and knowing that my husband and I love Mexican food, they wanted to treat us to this place. Our friends told us that every time they have called, the individual who answered the phone would say ""No reservations are accepted"" so our friends have never made reservations in the past. The same happened this time where we had a party of 6 but we didn't make reservations because our friends were never able to in the past. Not a big deal. We arrived at 6:30 pm on Feb 1, 2014 (Saturday) and the hostess asked us if we had reservations. Our friends explained their past experience and the hostess asked us who would say that to them. Our friends said they never asked who it was on the phone so they didn't know. The hostess asked if it was a guy on the phone and our friends said it had been a woman always. My husband then, being the comedian that he naturally is, joked around and handed her $2 asking her if she could help us out with a table. The hostess had this disgusted look on her face and said in a very rude way, ""Um, no, you can put your money away. Thanks."" Okay, fine. Not everyone might be as susceptible to my husband's comedy but this hostess from the start acted like we deliberately didn't make reservations. She treated us like we were an annoyance to her but we are the customers and.... the ""customer is always right."" I can NEVER understand individuals who go into a business where they have to deal with people every second of the day, yet they have the worst attitude for the job.  After the rude remark, the hostess, whose name she revealed as Katie, said that she will look at what's available. She returned and we were able to sit at a table about 2 minutes later. No wonder our wait wasn't long. We were lucky and got the table that happened to be right by the door. The staff moved some tables together (tables that weren't the same size so one of the tables was jutting out a little bit) so that they could accommodate the 6 of us. Now, of our group of 6, two of us being pregnant and one with a serious illness where she cannot be in a cold area for too long were sitting at the table RIGHT in front of their door. After sitting for a few minutes, we realized the area was too cold because the draft from the door opening was continuous. One of us went over to Katie and told her the situation of how our friend cannot be exposed to the cold for too long and asked if we can switch to another table. Katie said there was nothing she could do and that if we wanted, we could wait for another table but that might take as long as 35-40 minutes. No, we were not going to wait that long after being told over the phone multiple times that reservations aren't accepted. We had our ill friend sit as far away from the door as possible and she just dealt with it. Luckily, nothing bad happened and the two pregnant ones had their husbands have their backs to the door trying their best to keep the wind away.  The meal itself was pretty good, but it wasn't excellent. My husband and I both agreed that we would definitely take our business elsewhere. We had been excited prior to this visit, having heard great things from our friends about the food. We also have seen the restaurant quite busy, especially during the summer months but after experiencing it on our own... it's not worth it to us. The rudeness and bad customer service is not something we just put up with, UNLESS the food is out of this world.... and trust me, there are way better places with way better customer service to waste our money here in the future.  We will say that at the start, we thought our waitress, Sandra, was in on it too with Katie. After awhile, we figured Sandra was just overworked. She seemed very busy and frantic. We asked for an extra silverware a couple of times because when she initially brought it, she only brought 5 instead of 6. When we asked for the bill, that took awhile too. We thought we'd be rushed out of there because they were getting quite busy but we didn't receive our check right away. Oh and it took awhile for someone to take our order too.  So, if you don't care how you're treated and you just want an okay meal while visiting Lincoln Square, sure, give this place a try. My husband and I just know that we will never be returning because it just isn't worth it to be treated the way we were by their hostess (which is the first face you see when you enter Garcia's).

SO many restaurants say things have avocado in them and totally skimp... not Garcia's.  Pretty sure there is an entire avocado in that thing.  Plus it's so affordable!!

2013-12-02,3.0,"Alrighty. My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for a long time now. Long before they did the renovations. There are several reasons for the 3 stars I have given it. 1. First and foremost, (at least in my many experiences) the service here has be atrocious. And do I mean atrocious! The waitresses and waiters have barely changed over the years, and yet they still insist upon leaving you for long periods of time, even when they're not busy. So I hope you didn't finish your drink too quickly, or polish off the rest of those chips and salsa, because it's probably going to be about a half hour before they come and notice you again. 2. The food is great, and kinda makes up for the service. Like I said, my family and I have been coming here for years, and lemme tell you that it ain't for the service. You start off with a bowl of chips and salsa. And that salsa, is to die for. My favorite salsa still, to this day. It isn't spicy at all, just really awesome fresh, flavor. As for the entree, I always go with my classic steak burrito with avocado. It has always impressed. I have never been disappointed with the food they serve. I have taken many friends and family, and they have done nothing but praise the food.  3. And lastly, price. The price on some of the food may be a little on the high end, but it is never outrageous. I would gladly pay all the prices for their great food. I would say, this may not be the choice for a daily visit, but once a week or so, this place can become your new spot as it has been mine for many years.  All in all, at least give it one try.

As a vegetarian, I feel that there are very few places out there that will mindfully serve veggie food without mix up.  Last night they broke my heart! (LOL). I asked for veggie enchiladas, asking to make sure that the refried beans and mole sauce had no lard and the rice had no chicken stock etc. Excited for my meal, half way through my first enchilada, we found not invisible meat by products but an actual piece of chicken hidden under the refried beans! Whaaaaat!?  And when we asked the waitress, her explanation was they have all these things in the kitchen separate but then when putting it together it could have all gotten on the plate?!?! Really?! Since I had my old love for the place I told her it could be a health violation and she said ok. That was it.  I think more than the piece of chicken the lack of accountability was the scary part.

When we first walked in it looked very nice - bright colors, nice paintings on the wall, clean, and lots of seating. I thought we had made a decent choice. However, we did not. It wasn't THAT busy, and it took forever to even get seated. We got chips and salsa and water right away, but it took our waitress about 10 minutes to even greet us. We saw her twice the whole time we were there - once to take our order, and once to bring the check. The service is really lacking here. The menu has a little of something for everyone. I decided on the guac and the 2 taco dinner. The food is cheap, and it came out freakishly fast. But it sucked. The guac barely tasted like anything (I had to add salt and it was still crap), and the tacos were lukewarm. The cheese wasn't melted, the meat was dry and tasteless.

Gotta say, I was disappointed.  A couple of us had the chicken flautas -- they somehow managed to be dry and greasy at the same time. Another had the chicken mole and said it was good, and the tostadas another had looked big but a bit dry (I didn't ask how they were).  Mostly the problem is the noise level -- it's all hard surfaces in there, and during the lunch rush it was incredibly loud. We couldn't hear ourselves at all, even when we basically hollered at each other.  Some places aren't good for business meetings, and I understand that. This is one of them, and we won't be back for that purpose. But I'm willing to go to loud places on my own time if the food and service are good enough. But we waited a long time for the check, and for water and other odds and ends before that (because parts of our order were missing).  I didn't hate it, but I don't see any reason to go back in a city like Chicago where there's great Mexican food on almost every corner. The prices were a little higher than a more modest taqueria.

Love the interior of this restaurant. Appreciated the solid, decorative wood chairs and the high ceilings. The staff were super friendly and even our chips and salsa were great.

The salsa was super spicy but for some reason, I couldn't stop at just one chip.  I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're in the area and you're craving Mexican.

I do miss the old place prior to the construction, but its definitely understandable they had to expand due to their popularity.   The service has always been on point.  They come around and do their check in's with their customers, without it being too constant or annoying. Even on their busiest nights, their waitress' dont forget to check in on you, and the food is still delivered fast.   As far as the food goes, Ill be honest in saying I need to expand my tastes in the other food choices.  For years, Ive stuck with the burritos, tacos, and huevos con jamon (breakfast: eggs with ham).  As far as choice of meat goes, I would say their carne asada is the best choice when choosing their burritos, tacos, etc. Next to the carne asada would be the chicken.  Overall, their food consistency is  always right, and service is great. Lastly, the owners are terrific. Sometimes when I do order carry out, Ill usually run into the son or father, and they will always strike a conversation. Out of the many hundreds of many people they see a week, its surprising how they remember me.

2013-04-07,1.0,"I very rarely write a review; a place must be very good or very bad to warrant the effort.  Unfortunately, in the case of Garcia's, it is the latter.   We live near Lincoln Square and have tried only a couple of the restaurants.  We took our baby daughter out for a walk on a Sunday and stopped in for lunch.  From the moment we walked in, it seemed as though we had caught them at a bad time and were putting them out by seating us.  It was busy, but not packed.  We received chips, salsa and water within a couple of minutes, but while we saw several servers pass us, take orders from people seated after us, and look at our closed menus, we were not approached for nearly fifteen minutes.  Right as we were gathering things to leave, a server came to our table and shortly asked what we wanted.  OK, may as well stay.  Maybe the food is good. In about half the time it took to have our order taken, our food arrived.  I ordered the broccoli, spinach and rice burrito, which was very large for the price.  Sadly, it was overflowing with frozen vegetables that tasted freezer-burned and room temperature.  The flavorless cheese was not melted inside the burrito.  There was no seasoning whatsoever.  If you have a vegetable dish on a restaurant menu, it cannot feature frozen vegetables.  I could have made it at home for about a dollar, and felt bad about the result...so eating it at  restaurant was, to put it lightly, disappointing.  My husband described his steak tacos as street-fair quality.  I tried his refried beans, which were grainy and salty.  The food was not redeeming the experience. Surprise!  We did not see our server again until we asked the guy who cleared our plates if we could have our check since our baby was starting to get restless.  Our baby was not screaming, but she had let out a few cries, and I would assume that might motivate them to move us along.  Apparently not.   Could have been a slow Sunday, service-wise.  Doesn't excuse the food that might have been made in my college apartment on a night when I didn't feel like ""cooking.""  Won't be returning.",-0.885,0.85,0.059,0.09,0.4835544217687074

With that said, for as often as we go, we've never had to wait very long and sometimes there was no wait at all. Let's start by talking about my favorite items on the menu. The guacamole is incredible. It's got this unique whipped texture and the flavor is just perfect. They come in a small and large size. The small was big enough to last between myself and two other girlfriends of mine. The Queso Con Chorizo is sooooo bad for you but sooooooo good. You cannot go wrong with their fajitas, especially the shrimp. It's a very generous portion and the shrimp are exactly the way I like it... big, with just the right amount of crunch. And last but soooo not least, let's talk about their burritos. I always order the Al Pastor. This thing is ridiculous. And I mean this in the very best way. I can't remember how much it is costwise ($6? $7? $8?) Whatever. This thing can easily make two adults feel more than full. And if you don't like to eat until you're stuffed, then no joke, this can feed three adults. I know, right? ONE burrito! It's a bit salty for my personal taste but for $8 and the size of this monster, I'd say it's a pretty stinking good deal. As far as service, we've always gotten pretty good service here. Nothing memorable, but the tables were always clean, the waters always filled, and reasonable timing when taking orders, receiving our food, and paying the bill. That's all you can really ask for right?  For those complaining about the two entrances. Yes, it's a bit strange, however it never bothered me nor affected the quality of food or service. Therefore I don't believe negative reviews were necessary for that reason alone. And noise level? Yeah it can get a bit noisy, but that's not really the fault of the restaurant. The customers are having a great time, and interacting. I'm pretty sure that's a good thing.

In much less than 45 minutes our table was ready.  We ordered, and I swore the food came out minutes later.  We couldn't even believe that it was actually our food. This got me super excited.  I joked that ""they don't even pretend that it takes an hour to make your food here.""  (You know, some places like to add to the ""experience"" by making the food take longer.  So you think it was all actually made right then and there down to chopping the onions).

I ordered the cheese enchiladas.  In general they are nothing fancy. These were pretty standard for cheese enchiladas.  But since I think cheese enchiladas are fantastic. I thought these were fantastic.  (I won't deny the fact that I generally like anything that combines excessive cheese and carbohydrates).

2012-12-23,3.0,"They need to close off the entrance on Lincoln and stick to the entrance on the other side on Western Ave. because the very average food is more fitting to something along Western than Lincoln. Really, this place sort of doesn't fit in with the whole Lincoln Square thing but I guess it's close enough to Lawrence to make sense.  That being said, however, this place sure comes in handy on those nights when you waited a little too late to go out to dinner and it's the only thing still open.  It stays open pretty late and I can walk there from my place. It happens about once every 3 months, the wife and I are staring into an empty fridge at 11pm trying to come up with anything when we both know that we're going to end up at Garcias because it's the last thing open unless we want to go to 7-11 and get something horrible there.  It's not fresh, but you know what, it's not that bad. The beans and sauces clearly all come from a can or a jar. The cheeses are all very plastic-like. Not good quality. I don't know what it is but sometimes the food can be strangely satisfying, sort of in the way that the food at a cafeteria can sometimes be enjoyable even though it's not the best. The service is hit or miss but I've never been completely ignored or had a bad experience. The margaritas are average.

The servers are friendly and polite and they checked on our table a good amount despite the place being full. You can make a reservation ahead of time if you want to make sure you get a table since they can get busy especially during the weekends. Garcia's also tends to be pretty loud because it's packed most of the time, so if you want a nice quiet dinner, this may not be the right place.

Many times we've ordered the steak burrito; today we opted for ""Chicago's Best Burrito,"" which is a glorious, glorious burrito made with steak. Not sure whether Garcia's deemed it as such themselves or were once ranked the best, but let me put it this way: I actually laughed out loud when the waitress set it down in front of me. First off, it truly is as big as your head--my BF and I each ordered one and easily could have been non-fat-asses about it, read: just split a burrito--and secondly, oh my lord they spared this burrito nothing. Sour cream, avocado, ranchero sauce, literally about a half-inch layer of cheese oozing over the top, plus juicy, high-quality steak.      When I made it to the halfway point, I sat back, all satisfied with myself that I hadn't plowed through my half nearly as quickly as the BF had plowed through his, but then I noticed that he had actually sectioned his burrito into thirds, and in actuality had made it through only a third. So yes, I was plowing.      It was a very good burrito that I will be fantasizing about. I also had a house margarita on the rocks and felt that it could have been a little stronger; granted, the density of the burrito probably wiped out the effects of the tequila.",0.9898,0.82,0.17,0.01,0.4150427350427349

I love margaritas and have had them all over the U.S. and Mexico, but the ones at Garcia's taste like artificial mix and burn my stomach from about the third sip on.  I've even left half a glass of margarita there before because I couldn't stomach the rest of it.  Never have I had a reaction like that before anywhere, even at the Mexican restaurant way further south on Lincoln that serves STRONG margaritas! The atmosphere is modern and attractive, but it gets way, way too loud in there, especially when there are families with a lot of kids.  I don't think there is much they can do about the noise level, but it isn't always the easiest to hold a conversation here.

Anyway, before you guys snub this place...and no, this is not Little Village, or Pilsen...this is more like ""The world's greatest and best Pepe's""..... The following things here are very yummy: Skirt steak dinner, combo, or with eggs...truly a perfect cut of well seasoned and TENDER beef, very hard to do with skirt -and no, cutting across the grain like the Food Network tells you is not a cure all. My favorite thing at this place is skirt steak, so nothing cutting edge, but damn it's good. Huevos rancheros, I've heard that these are actually ""huevos ahogados"", but you know...there are a million variations to this dish. Garcias is my favorite, mainly because it's not just some afterthought green sauce splash on some over easy eggs. Maybe even best in city. Plain ass tostada, just beans, and rice maybe. So good.

2012-07-31,2.0,"Ive been to Garcia's twice.  If you want bland, boring, generic mexican food this is your place. If you want fast but totally impersonal service this is your place.  If you want a loud echo chamber of a dining room, this is your place.   Here's the thing, Chicago is home to some really great mexican restaurants.  Even the near vicinity of Garcia's has far superior mexican restaurants.  Los Napoles right around the corner on Western is FANTASTIC!  Why anyone would choose Garcia's over that or many other places is beyond me.  Sure, its right on the square, its never hard to get a table, its ultra kid-freindly but the food and the atmosphere are mediocre at best.   The guacamole was straight out of a bag and clearly not made fresh.  The beans have virtually no taste.  The burritos, while huge, are very bland.   What they have going for them: Location (right in lincoln square) Low Prices Size What is not good: Pretty much everything else.  There are 2 things that would dramatically turn this place around. 1. FOOD!!!  Add some spice! Get creative!  do something interesting!  MAKE YOUR GUACAMOLE FRESH!! 2.  Atmosphere!!!  Add some acoustical panels on the walls or hang some tasteful sound baffles, the place is far too tall with no absorptive material anywhere...this creates an atmosphere that is very loud, very cold, full of echos.   Overall, its just not comfortable.   I might stop in there again if im pressed for time, in the square, and just want to fill up on some cheap mexican food but otherwise I wont go back unless they change the above 2 issues.",0.9871,0.736,0.183,0.081,0.5527524484971295

The food was good and filling and not expensive at all. The guacamole was quite tasty. I had the banana margarita which was AMAZING. I've never been to a place that offered that flavor. The next time I went, I had the strawberry margarita and it was equally as good.  The only complaint I have about the place is the building itself. It there is a decent amount of people inside, the sound is a bit much. It can get very loud and echo-y; not ideal for conversation. The service was fine.

It is not important to us that some dishes are not authentic, all we care about is that the food taste deliciouso, margaritas is really good, prices are reasonable and it is very convenient for us to stop by after work when we feel lazy to cook at home. The location is also very nice with other small shops in the Lincoln Square strip. However, there is a certain waiter that we always wish wld not be our server, unfortunately we are not always in luck and the latest incident was I thought very annoying and worthy of sharing (thus the 3 stars only rating).  This guy is unbelievable. We order a pitcher of margarita right after the bus boy serves us the usual salsa and chips. We are on our 2nd salsa and chips and still no margaritas. In the meantime, we see our waiter taking orders from various customers who has just come in and taking checks.  After we were getting full with all the chips and salsa we had consumed, my hubby finally asled him about our drinks. He then went over to the bar w/c was literaly next to our table. Our drinks were stting there all this time (12 min. wait), and guess what, not one apology from this guy. Ofcourse after dinner, he was quick to serve our check and came back for it  3 times until my husband finally  put the pitcher on top of it in full view  as the pitcher was only half empty.

I ate two spoonfuls and left the rest. My boyfriend ordered it, too, but only ate half of his bowl. The bowls of soup were big, but that was not a plus in this case. I also had the two-taco plate with beans and rice and it was not good either, but not horrible. I ate one of the tacos, but not much of anything else. My dear boyfriend who always gives anything the benefit of the doubt, said ""the rice is pretty good.""  It was just rice, folks, and it was still the highlight of the meal.

I mentioned how long we were waiting and we couldn't stay any longer to eat the tacos. She walked away and I saw her talk to the manager...and then they both went about their business and started carrying out food to other tables.

I can only imagine that the good reviews are coming from people who had margaritas and, therefore, their taste buds were anesthetized and their sense of time passing was altered. So why did I end up here? Well, we were coming back from a lovely day spent at King Spa, and my friend said, how about some Mexican food? I rarely say ""no"" to that question. Unfortunately, it was a rainy Monday, and Los Nopales is closed on Monday. We ended up at Garcia's. I had hopes, friends, I had hopes. That happens when you're hungry. You think, maybe today, this place will be good. Maybe today, I'll have a good meal and receive good service. You know what the definition of faith is? It's the triumph of hope over experience. Well, my faith is dashed. We arrived mid-afternoon on Monday. The dining room is cavernous when there are only 4 tables occupied, and 2 waitresses to serve them. The busboy brought over water, utensils, chips, salsa and menus quickly. The waitress took our orders - one fish taco, one avocado burrito - in quick order. My friend, who ordered just one fish taco, was diving into the chips and salsa. I had one or two; the salsa is just okay. And I had a burrito coming. Our food arrived in about 5 minutes. My friend bathed her fish taco in salsa. What does that tell you about the flavor? She continued her assault on the chips. I took a bite of the avocado burrito - there is no taste other than avocado. Maybe that's as it should be. But there's no heat, either of the temperature or the flavor variety. Cold and clammy. Well, I do like avocado, so I ate half of it. When you're hungry, taste isn't as important. Meanwhile, my friend has emptied the chip basket and the salsa bowl. It would be nice to receive refills. I might like to add some flavor, however small, onto my honking big burrito. However, the waitress is nowhereto be seen in the dining room.

Finally, we flagged down the busboy and asked for our check. The waitress somehow pried herself loose from the wall to deliver the check. She does not waste her valuable energy by saying anything to us like ""how was everything?"" ""Is there anything you need?"" Yes, dear, there's something I need. I need Los Nopales open seven days a week, thank you very much, so I never have to cross your path again. A couple weeks later, I'm still pissed off writing about this. I left a 10% tip.

But since then, my pallets and my expectations of service have changed. Me, my girlfriend, and her siblings decided to grab a bite to eat after some Christmas shopping.  It was a party of 5, we got sat and got our chips and salsa right away (probably the best part of the dining experience).   We waited 20 minutes to get our servers attention so we can order. She took our drink, appetizer, and entre order. We order 3 large horchatas, 1 regular horchatas, and 1 Chorizo and Cheese Appetizer.  I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito with everything no tomatoes, my girlfriend ordered a Steak Torta with no tomatoes, her brother ordered a Carne Asada Burrito with everything, her other brother ordered a Chorizo and Eggs with corn tortilla, and one of the girlfriends had a 2 Steak taco dinner...... not hard right? After ordering, 25 minutes have passed and we still have not received anything, not even our drinks!! It took us 30 minutes to get our appetizer, which came out cold but at this point we were so hungry we didn't want to complain. Another 30 minutes (a total of 1 hour since we ordered our food) passed and our food was not out yet, at this point we're starving (we devoured the chips and salsa and the appetizer) and I watch as other people's food leave the kitchen before we even get our food. At this point we were tempted to walk out because our Pay Box parking was about to expire. I went up front to the cashier and asked to speak to a manager. When I spoke to the manager and he told me the food was taking a long time because there was a large party, I then asked him why other tables were getting their food before us? He never answered my question and replied back with Sit down, you're food will be out soon, we will give you a discount. Within a couple minutes our food came out, everything was cold and disgusting. Either they put it together on the spot or it had been sitting in the window and no one ran out our food. The waitress who ran out our food tried to explain to me that everyone had to wait for their food... How does that explain people getting their food before us? She replied, not everyone's food is as complicated as yours (see our order above, is it complicated? An 8 year old can put it together) STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR YOUR LACK OF SERVICE.

Granted, there are a million Mexican restaurants in Chicago and this certainly isn't comparable to many of the upscale, fusion-like, swanky places in the city but for good, solid food at reasonable prices - it is your best bet, especially for this neighborhood.

For families or gathering with a couple friends, it's perfect.  The complimentary chips and salsa are delightful. I tend to be a bit of a salsa snob and I always judge a restaurant by the quality and freshness or lack of freshness of the salsa. Garcia's passed my test!

Given how much this group likes to eat*, I should have known I'd have them at ""Garcias?""  I was surprised how busy this place was on a Monday evening; fortunately, there wasn't a wait and they were able to pull together a table for our dirty dozen lickity split.  As soon as the chips and salsa hit the table, we pounced on them like we just came off a 10-day fast. That salsa was damn good, we were using the spoon to scrape every last morsel on to our chips. The only downer was that they weren't very quick to replenish them. One of my friends ordered chips and salsa to take home - I think it cost $5 for a decent take-home portion.  I ordered a regular margarita and the taco-tostada combo. The margarita was big and strong - just how I like 'em. I went with the tilapia taco and a veggie tostada. The taco was just ok, I've had better fish tacos in the city; it might be because I'm not wild about avocado, but the special avocado sauce did nothing for me. Adding some of their hot salsa verde for some kick did the trick though. The tostada was good, but messy. They don't skimp on the ingredients, I had a tower of tostada goodness.  Portions are quite generous here, especially for the price. My friend's burritos were enormous, they made Chipotle burritos look like junior-size ones and were only $6-ish. I think everyone who ordered one took at least half home. Even the tortilla soup came in what looked like a mixing bowl.  Service was the one weak spot, and from the other reviews a chronic problem. Service was not bad, just aloof. It should also be noted that if you're dining in a group, they'll only split the check two ways and take a maximum of two cards for the tab - I recommend bringing cash to make settling the check easier.  It wasn't the best Mexican I've had, but it was very solid; I'd definitely come back for at least some margs, chips and salsa.  *However, nothing like Yelpers love of food",0.9861,0.794,0.147,0.059,0.5275837912087912

Mexican food can be a sketchy dish around any big city. Where you never really know what you're getting into until you've already committed. Sometimes the hole in the wall places are the best, sometimes they leave you full of regret for days. The fancier restaurants are a bit easier to judge.  Garcia's, nestled into the heart of Lincoln Square has a reputation, and it's a good one. The main portion of the restaurant is open and spacious, the bar area is much more cozy. While some of the seating kind of puts you front and center for a good round of people watching the good atmosphere of the place prevails. It can get a little loud with the open space but the great food and yummy margaritas kind of take you away from paying attention to the rest of the world, especially if you are in good company.  The menu is pretty expansive and has something for everyone, true Mexican food lovers or not. I love their blended strawberry margaritas, they are reasonably priced and trust me the tequila is in there! I've hit Garcia's for birthday dinners or small one-on-one dinners. I've never had a bad waiter who wasn't pleasent and helpful, even the busing staff checks on you. Needlss to say I've enjoyed myself every time I've paid a visit to this place.

They don't have the best anything in town, as noted by the conspicuous omission from the recent Mexican restaurant round-up in Chicago magazine, BUT, it is a packed house every day of the week. I've been to Garcias more than 100 times and I could write a novel about the storied history.  Basics: good margaritas, above average basic Mexican food, hit or miss service, fun atmosphere (nicer and larger than a typical taqueria), high volume. At times the service is great, at times you can sit for a half hour before someone takes your order. Before the renovation I always thought the salsa was my favorite, but now it's not as consistent. That doesn't stop us from going back. In that neighborhood, if we don't go to Opart Thai, we wind up at Garcias.

2010-12-23,5.0,"I just realized that I've been coming here almost every week for 16 years. I don't know whether the chef is still the same, but their steak burrito is still affordable ($6), huge and very tasty as it's always been.  My wife usually gets shrimp a la Veracruzana (about $12), which is great if you like them spicy.   This place has been renovated last year and has new, much better bathrooms.  It's clean and has friendly staff, very fast service, and the waiters will never give you ""this is not my table"" crap, so if you ask any of them for anything you need, it will be there soon.  Our favorite waitress is Astrid, very dedicated and polite, always smiling. You can often see cops eat there, which is a definite sign of tasty and affordable food.    The  two hidden jewels:  1. Best flan in Chicago!   It's not very cheap ($3.50 per piece), but it's real and it tastes just like my mother's used to, no instant junk, and no cheese cake.  It gets that non-industrial consistency, being darker with some bubbles trapped close to the edges and on the bottom.  This is real stuff, made of real eggs. 2. Their frozen margarita is unsurpassed by any other I've ever tasted in Chicago, if you like them like me, which is strong and freezing cold.    My little secret is to go there during the off hours just before dinner when there's barely anybody there, because by then the margarita machine has cooled everything close to the freezing point.  Only this way you can get a margarita that can cause frequent brain freezes if you're not careful, the one the sticks so you can almost eat it like an ice-cream with the straw.  I don't see a reason to order any but their regular frozen margaritas with them being this good.  Their house tequila (used in these) is supposedly made by the owner's brother in Mexico, so be careful, because these things are made strong and since they're so tasty, even one of them can fool you into a blissful dizziness if you consume it too quickly while your stomach is still empty.  I usually drive there, so I limit myself to no more than one per visit and I sip it quite slowly. The free chips is good, but the quality varies, best being right after they fry a new batch. The home-made red salsa served with it is medium to quite spicy and very good.   Their horchata is too sweet for my and my wife's taste. Last, but not least, it's very affordable, so tip them well, because they work much harder for their money than the waiters at fancy places with less tables but much higher prices.",0.9984,0.749,0.202,0.049,0.479761026851936

Her beans were totally without flavor. My tacos: asada, ok but lacked any real flavor. The steak needed seasoning, for sure. Al Pastor, totally bland, obviously the pork had not marinated long enough and was very fatty and chewy. Lengua, ok I love tongue tacos, but these were very chewy and lacked any seasoning, again, so they just had that sour boiled tongue flavor, which is nasty. Tostada de Aguacate: the crema was us style, so bad on a tostada, and the beans, again, like some inert paste of yuck. The rice was OK. Salsas were below average and not at all picante.

Don't let the pseudo upscale aesthetic fool you, this place likes to cut corners in the kitchen. I ordered an appetizer of guacamole and chips, but what was brought to my table could best be described as a mint toothpaste and sour cream spread: a sickly green color with a pasty, unnaturally smooth texture and bland taste. I questioned if avocados even factored into its creation.  For an entree, I split an order of mixed (steak/chicken/shrimp) fajitas with my companion, a decision more important than I realized. The portions were huuuuge. Even with two of us, we couldn't hope to finish the plate. This may be somewhat of a plus, however quantity does not trump quality.

Flavorful, food that hits the spot after a long day--My chicken quesadilla warmed me up from the gross weather outside, and I still had enough to take home to the hubster. 5. Lively atmosphere--Unfortunately, Garcia's loses a star because they didn't even have music playing in the background. As nice of a place as this, I expected festive music playing to keep our girl's night out going.

It was a little sweet/watered down for my tastes, but to each his own. We got our food 10-15 minutes after we ordered it. Holy huge burritos!

I was only able to eat half of it, and trust me, I'm an experienced burrito eater.  It tasted good, but I wasn't blown away by the taste or anything.

The ceramic tiles on the floor and the high ceilings make for a very noisy environment.  This is not a good place for a date, but it's pretty good for a hang-out with friends. I had the carne asada burrito.  For just $6, it was very large and very filling.  The steak inside was good.  I ate until I was full and kept eating until my plate was clean.  As far as the complimentary chips and salsa, I prefer a much chunkier salsa than the watery variety that seems to pop up at so many Mexican joints.  But the chips were good.  At one point, I dropped some salsa off my chip and onto my arm.  Without thinking, I scraped the salsa off my arm with a chip and ate it.  Ridiculous, but I guess that's a sign that I liked it. Service was adequate.  One server was dripping something from one of the plates when he brought it over, but it didn't drip on us.  (Do I give him props for not dripping on us or dock points because one of our plates was dripping some kind of liquid on its way to the table?)

In the few months following I went a handful of times and the food was consistently solid drunk food.  A great way to wind down your night with a god group of people - definitely a late night spot for you and 14 of your closest friends.  The more people, the more rowdy, the more fun!  And the margaritas sure help with that.  Especially since they come in pitchers.   In future visits, I will probably go drunk and dine in, since they don't deliver and there's no way I'll drive.",0.9853,0.814,0.147,0.039,0.49861111111111106

Ok so yeah, tacos are decent, check it out, open til midnight blah blah blah. Margarita... I had the ""cadillac"" margarita... seriously who can pass up a drink with such a title?

Having recently discovered Lincoln Square, Garcia's stuck out as the only non-European restaurant in the 'hood. Walking pass Garcia's on a Fri night, it was one of the hottest bars on the block with a full-house at the bar!   So I decided to bring some friends along and check it out on a less busy day, such as a late Sat lunch. The moment the menu was served, our party of 6 scanned through for the authentic dishes. ""Do they have anything with Mole?""  Checked. ""Mexican style ceviches? This should be interesting!"" Checked ""Oooh Flautas on the menu eh?"" Checked ""They have Horchata, but not Jamaica?"" hmmmm...... The ceviches were fresh, but waaay too spicy which took away the natural aroma & fragrance of these lime-soaked tilapia bites.  The flautas were short & skinny, deep-friend with sour cream, tomato slices and lettuce on the side. Real flautas are meant to be long & fat! The enchiladas were swimming in a reddish, marinara-like sauce...  My two tacos (con al Pastor y Bistec) were overcooked, dry, and tasted like they were simply seasoned with Mojo, if any seasoning at all. At least the horchata packed a punch on the cinnamon. If you want CHEAP yet delicious Mexican food, do yourself a favor and take a ride down south. If not, come down to Addison Red Line & hit up El Burrito Mexicano! I promise you can get a better Torta + Horchata for less than $10.",0.9848,0.859,0.129,0.013,0.4026927437641724

I just moved to Lincoln Square with my wife and two young kids.  We love being in a neighborhood that is so walkable and kid-friendly.  We went twice on Saturdays at 11am, when the place was nearly empty with 15+ open tables.  Our kids are fairly well-behaved, but we like to grab a table near other families and away from couples in case one of the kid fusses, so we don't disturb others and where the high chairs and baby gear aren't blocking others.  Both times, the staff insisted on ""keeping the big tables open"" for larger groups, and pack us in between couples who are quietly dining.  We don't get it. There were multiple open tables that size, and **none** of them got used either time we were there.  Worse, they proceed to park our stroller at it!  Worse, both times, we had to stop eating in the middle of the meal, so we could move our kids' chairs so the people on either side of us could get out to leave! Maybe we're just too worried about disturbing other people, but it basically ended up completely stressing us out both times.  We also don't understand the how the waiters are assigned/rotated there, but we spent a lot of time asking for refills and waiting for the check. The food was average. Not bad, not great. Come on, Garcias!  Shouldn't you have a little bit of empathy for parents on weekend lunch hours?!  Please stop posting a sign that says ""seat yourself"" and telling us to ""sit anywhere"" if the next waiter that comes out is just going to move us!  You should seriously think about creating a family-friendly section on weekends!

On all of our visits to Garcia's, I have ordered something that I thought was very good (tongue tacos, chilaquiles, huevos rancheros), and my fiancee has ordered something that was disappointingly bland (i.e. all of the vegetarian entrees).  So basically, the food is hit or miss, but to better your chances of getting something tasty, veer towards the items that wouldn't appear on a standard ""combination plate"".  The breakfast type items have been batting 1.000 I think the reason we keep coming back is for the margaritas...holy cow, they will do a number on you, and you won't even know it, and they are reasonably priced.

The drinks are strong, always a good thing (you're getting ripped off otherwise).  I freakin' love mole sauce. There's something about this weird, brownish-purple thick liquid. There's not much like it. Garcia's mole sauce had a weird aftertaste, but it was okay. It wasn't very flavorful. I didn't even ask if they used chicken stock (let's hope not).

I say authentic-""ish"" because I can't imagine that you could actually find such ridiculously huge burritos anywhere in Mexico itself. That's got to be a symbol of American gluttony, and all the glory of over-indulgence. And what a tasty burrito it is! My fiancee refers to them as little ""baby torsos,"" because they are about the same size (I recommend the steak variety). Each bite leaves me feeling a little gross, but also extremely satisfied.  Admittedly, the rice and beans is pretty much standard fare, and the chips & salsa are more than adequate in both the taste and artery-clogging department. I can't comment much on the more authentic dishes available (there's even menudo, which I hear is a rarity), but seeing them on the menu at least makes the whole experience seem a little more worthwhile. Don't expect good food service - if you live in the area, just call ahead and do carry out. It will save you the frustration of wondering if your waitress forgot to put your order in, and will also spare you the 20 minutes you will inevitably wait between the time you finish your meal and the time you actually get your check. But if you have an hour+ to kill, or have the itchin' for a big margarita, by all means stop in - the dining area is newly remodeled and larger, which is helping eliminate some of the longer wait times on the weekend. Sure, the undecorated solid white walls might remind you of an insane asylum, but when the food is good the decor doesn't matter that much, right? Prices are pretty cheap as well. Expect to pay about 10 bucks per person without drinks. If you go all fancy-pants and enter margarita-ville, you can still get by for under 40 bucks for a couple.

We ask the waitress to correct & re-run the bill.  The next day when I check my credit card statement I noticed that the order was rung twice !!!

Fine fine fine.  A clean bathroom does not an excellent restaurant make.  So let's talk grub.

Aaaaah, just the way I remembered it! ALMOST. While the torta was just as huge and delicious as I remembered it, the rice was somehow lacking.  It was too... Dry?  Bland?  Yeah, I think those two words sum it up.  But the beans still melt in your mouth, so all is not lost.  The chicken was just as dry as I recalled and portions are still beyond generous, with styrafoam leftover containers in my refrigerator to prove it.

I arrived a little later than my original party and was promptly warned about the service. I'll give the waitress the benefit of the doubt as she looked a little shell-shocked at the crowd that had gathered for the first ""big"" night since it reopened. Other tables looked to be getting their drink and food orders no problem, but it took a little while for my margarita, which had been ordered before I got there, to get to the table.  I'm from the South and we do margaritas frozen down there and I had hoped that this would be a decent margarita. The first was pretty good, but the second went way overboard on the mix and was way, way too tart for my liking.  The other person at my table who was drinking margaritas agreed. Too much mix.  The burrito I split with my fiancee was pretty good. Nothing remarkable, but it was HUGE and we split it and both came away full. It was a ""good"" burrito. Not great, just good.  I'm looking forward to going back once the initial crowds subside, hopefully on a Saturday afternoon or Tuesday night to try a little bit more of the menu.

2009-11-16,4.0,"STOP THE PRESSES! As of Monday, November, 16, 2009, after a four and a half month renovation, Garcia's on Western has officially reopened! True true story. Not sure about you all, but I was counting down the days to Enchilada goodness and refreshing Margarita bliss, and low and behold on a whim tonight and completely unbeknown to us we ended up at Garcia's during their grand reopening. Lucky us. So, here's the skinny.   They have expanded in a major way.  The ceilings are higher which means more light, the dining room is wider which means no longer feeling guilty when you have a large party because you'll no longer take up the whole center or corner of the dining room.  The bar is bigger, meaning Friday and Saturday waits will be a lot more comfortable.  And in the summer we were told that the windows open so there will be a little al fresco feel to the front.  Que lindo!!  Anyway, they kept some of the ""old charm"", meaning don't freak out when you see some of the murals from you memories past on the North Wall.  The bathrooms have been gutted and now sport fancy schmancy dryers which normally wouldn't impress me, but for some reason had me singing their praises into the late hours of the evening.  And they have kept all of the same servers (which may or may not be a good thing for you, but for me was wonderful catching up with some of the ""originals"".) Now onto the food.  Their menu has not changed too much, they've added a chorizo and frijolles appetizer along with a flauta app, and there were a couple other minor changes denoted by an italicized ""new"" next to it, but overall all the staples are still there and are served exactly how you remembered them.   The house salsa and chips were so fresh that I swear the chips melted in my mouth.   Our entrees arrived pretty fast and we could not believe how fresh everything tasted (yes, I know it was their first night everything had to be fresh... but let's let's hope it stays this way--it should, I mean it is Garcia's).   We had a couple Banana Margaritas and I'm happy to say their recipe has not changed one bit.   The service was good, there were times when I felt like the beverage service was a little slow but it wasn't too bad.  So it's hardly worth mentioning. We talked to the server who said that there are some additional minor changes yet to be made, so we're really looking forward to seeing the finished project. Fancy tidbit of info some of you may not have known, they hadn't renovated in 18 years!!  As a result this place looks fabulous. Que bonita Garcias! P.S. The tables look eerily similar to the ones they had before, do not be fooled, they reordered the same style in a darker shade, they're totally new. I told the server you could probably still use the old ones and no one would notice, she laughed and said I know ""but everything fresh!

I can't think of a better burrito to start off with.. no really, obviously I can't.  I got the carne asada burrito, added some cheese, and sneakily saved some of our guac so I could stick that on there too.  Genius.  The steak was very flavorful, and the monster size was enough for me to have leftovers.  I love that in a meal.  Margaritas were also good, though get them on the rocks.  My pal's first one was a frozen one (her choice) but she proclaimed the non-slushy version to be much stronger in the tequila area.   Guac was good, salsa was not very spicy, but once you know to ask for the spicy one, you're good to go.  Service was a little slow, though it was hopping in there and apparently usually this isn't the case.  Prices are cheap, and since my friend lives spitting distance from this little gem, I'll be back for more burritos!!!",0.9453,0.879,0.088,0.033,0.4087632275132275

Cheap? Yes. Typical? Not in my experience, at least! I have three things to say about it: First Thing: DO NOT get a pitcher of margarita with ice here. GET THAT SHIT FROZEN.  The pitcher of frozen that we got lasted me and my friend well on until we couldn't eat anymore, and let me tell you: WE WERE TRASHED. A pitcher of margarita has never gotten me so completely plastered. From the first sip to the last sip I could taste a strong presence of tequila. And again: it lasted ALL DINNER!  We watched another couple get a margarita with ice and they had drained it in half the time it took us. And the ice made it all watery and we, being drunk,  talked loudly about what a bad choice they had made. So yeah: FROZEN. Second Thing: Neither of us could eat our burritos in one sitting. I wanted to SO BAD, but I knew I would truly explode. They're GIGANTIC! And if you get suizo ranchero, you are doing yourself a favor. I ate mine 2 whole days later for lunch, and it was still just as awesome. Third Thing: Service was lovely. The lady we had was adorable, and even when we were obviously not able to speak in clear sentences, she was sweet and helpful. It was the first time in a while that I wanted to tip someone well at a restaurant.

We could wander in, grab a table by the window, enjoy some drinks and food, then leave- for under 50$ for 3 of us.  On my last visit, we were seated at a new, larger table that was awkwardly placed.

I traveled upwards of 1,000 miles from Denver to Chicago for my beloved Garcia's burrito. I then traveled from the suburbs to the city and my best friend's house, we loaded up into the car and off we went. My heart was full and happy and I was counting the blocks ....3, 2,1 ... we made our turn into Lincoln Square ... and then ...it happened. My friend's voice cracked as we drove by the sealed off restaurant. "" Ummm Oh my THAT doesn't look good"" ... what? What ? WHAT doesn't look good ????? My heart sank and my palms grew sweaty ... could the universe be so cruel as to have something happen to my beloved Garcia's ??? As it would turn out ... YES !!! ""Remodeling"" they call it and that translates into ""Your burrito will be available in September""! OK Jenn ..breathe ...stay calm ...in with the good air, out with the bad. As we fervently tried to rethink things, and locate another burrito place, my BFF remembered ..... another Garcia's just up the street ! Although much smaller, it is owned and operated by the same folks!!! My pulse returned to normal and we even found a rock star parking spot ... things were looking up! I had what I always have. A steak burrito with sour cream, cheese, avocado, re fried beans, lettuce and tomato. This burrito is the size of my forearm and weighs about 4 lbs. It is hot and gooey and absolute perfection, I fought off tears of joy as I took my first bite. Hallelujah, and   whatever else one proclaims after experiencing pure bliss. I can say no more. They are simply my favorite food on this earth. The folks at the table next to ours were equally excited and pleased, they yummed and groaned and inhaled with the same level of intensity as we did. This is no coincidence, these burritos are amazing. My BFF had the Fillet AL Mojo DE Ajo ... which is fish in a garlic butter sauce with rice and avocado. The garlic was cooked perfectly, tender, succulent  and not burned at all. Burned garlic can really booger things up. It was amazing, the flavors and the texture could not have been better. This dish, as different as my burrito as could be, just proves the quality of the chefs here, not just people slapping together some burritos, the menu is large and every dish is as good as the next.

After a night of hard drinking at Garcia's, we decided to grab a late night bite and run over to Garcia's which has a full bar on one side and serves cocktails. Coming into Garcia's at Friday 1:30am was not too bad, except that the tables were a little bit too close to each other. Our party of five sat at a table, but then we were asked to move after our water and chips were delivered because another group of thirteen came through. You would imagine they would just try to seat them elsewhere since we had gotten there first! I ordered some flautas, quesadillas and a mango margarita. On the liquor side, I'd say that I was buzzed from Daily Bar & Grill, but Garcia's got me to the right side of drunk. The margarita is strong and I smelled of it after I finished it. My friend ordered a beer and was doing his thing too. Where Garcia's kind of doesn't quite do it for me is in the food. My friend ordered a chicken burrito and hell it was giant as hell with a lot of sauce over it, served wet. He was able to take down about half of it. My flautas came with tons of sour cream and guac, but they only served flautas with chicken. All in all not a bad flauta (it's really hard to mess that dish up), but the quesadillas were not very good. They are made with corn tortillas and were extremely greasy. All ten of my fingers were soaked from the orange drip of Mexican eats, but I couldn't say it was all too delicious. Mad props for late night action, selling good cocktails, but please work on improving the food and seating room.",-0.1169,0.806,0.099,0.095,0.5563982313982315

Garcia's is where you go when you've been drinking (or playing monopoly, I guess) late at night and you just want a fish taco or two.  Don't bother dining in.  The service isn't great, and I personally think the tacos taste better after they've been wrapped up for carry-out. Their salsa is really excellent, but overall the food just can't compare with places like Las Palmas, Los Nopales, or El Tapatio.",0.9428,0.758,0.202,0.04,0.50625
2009-05-26,4.0,"On our recent visit to Chicago, we got to go to this place, one of my sister-in-law's favorite neighborhood bites.  They are big fans and, overall, so am I now, even though it is kind of tough to give 4 stars after just one visit.   It was Sunday night, peak dining hour and they were absolutely packed, which is a good sign, with hispanic-looking people, which is an even better sign (right?).  I am an unapologetic middle-class blue plate diner.  I really appreciate a nice plate of food prepared by people I might otherwise run into in my neighborhood, and that is what it feels like you get here:  Comfort food for when you don't feel like cooking or to venture outside your normal cookbook habits.   Service was forgivably slow given the fact this was rush hour. The servers themselves were very apologetic and helpful.  They started us off quickly with chips and salsa.  The salsa was very fresh tasting, with lots of bright flavor - not too salty or vinegary.  It was on the hotter side of medium for me, and by the time the heat snuck up on me, I was wishing the server would show back up with some water for us.  Water and our drinks (mexican beers for the other couple, margaritas for myself and my wife) showed up quickly thereafter though, to save my palate.  The Margarita was very good, on the rocks with salt - too often frozen = neon green radiator fluid looking stuff.   This one was very good - not overpowering, but not watery either.  I gather (second hand) that while the pitcher isn't that much more expensive than a round of 4 margaritas, it actually holds 7-8 medium sized drinks (God bless the Chicago Transit Authority).  As I have (nearly) fully exited my misspent youth, one was enough for me and it lasted throughout dinner.   I ordered the Combination Dinner with a Chile Relleno & Steak Enchiladas (see photo).  The Chile Relleno was excellent: Lightly battered and stuffed with just enough cheese.  Not greasy, not overcooked -- just right, so the pepper had just a little body left to it.  The steak enchiladas were great too.  The meat was tender and well-seasoned.  The ranchero sauce was a bit of a disappointment -- it was quite runny, and tasted a bit watered down too, almost like the had to stretch the tail-end of that batch out a bit or something.  Rice and beans rounded out the plate to much more than I could eat, and they were both flavorful and full of that comfort-food goodness that my favorite neighborhood Mexican joints have.  I look forward to going back the next time we visit. Ah, wait!  Footnotes!  For you hardcore down-home Mexican cuisine fans, I noticed some dishes you don't see very often.  In addition to beef and chicken tacos, you can get your tacos (and other dishes) with 'lingua.'  Now, I am not sure I want the meat I consume tasting me back, so I will shy away from tongue for the time being, but I am sure some if not many of you will decry my banal palette, so I offer this - go eat some yourself.   Another one a little off the beaten path:  Pancita.  The description line said ""delicious honeycomb tripe..."" -- as a general rule, any time someone has to convince me to eat something by calling it out as ""delicious"" in the menu is immediately suspect.  ""Go ahead, try it! It's delicious""  Yeah, right.  Last time I heard that, it was a Korean friend convincing me to eat their version of shitlins, err I mean chitlins.  Anyway, I am sure once again that some of you will be delighted to know that they are keeping it real at Garcia's.  Enjoy.",0.9961,0.831,0.134,0.035,0.4932903892150467

Lately (and I mean within the last two months) it seems like my burrito is sopped up with grease and that meat - it's just nowhere near the same as it was.  It's like longer strips of pork and has no grill-heated and browned yumminess that it used to have.  I'm not sure what happened but I want my old burrito back! So, burrito Thursday has gone un-burritoed for a while now.  Maybe I'll give Garcia's another try soon and hope it's back to what it was.

2009-01-20,5.0,"seriously, this little joint has the best mexican food ive had. one of the reasons i miss my old neighborhood. every time i go here i know what to expect and they usually deliver. most of the time i get the combo meals especially the one taco/tostada/enchilada meal. their steak and al pastor are very tasty and tender. sometimes i change it up and just get a taco dinner. wanna try something that will fill you up? try what my friends and i affectionately call the drew special: 1 steak torta and 2 steak tacos.  problems with garcias are ones that usually coincide with popular places: always packed and limited parking. prices have gone up throughout the years, but the food is worth every penny.  since i grew up by this place, i will always have special place for garcias whether its late night at 2am or for just plain old take-out.  garcias is what i measure other mexican food places to.",0.8608,0.866,0.097,0.037,0.38922619047619045

Well, here's why you should.  0) The corn tortilla chips and salsa is good, but don't over-eat what they bring; this would be a strategic mistake.  1) Portions. With the dinners, you get a good size of rice, beans, and condiments (lettuce, sliced tomato, etc.). The burritos are delicious and large. They also have some dinner platters. I had the Pechuga de Pollo, and can honestly say the chicken was some of the best I've had at any restaurant. 2) Price. For food of this quantity and quality, you wouldn't mind paying twice what they charge. Luckily, if you're like me, you only pay half of what you expect. Summary: the place is cheap.  3) Horchata. If you haven't had it before, try it when you go. It's a sweetened rice-water beverage with spices (this description doesn't do it justice).

With that being said, I'd throw the Garcia's burrito into the aptly named Meat Log category.  Its 9 inches long by 4 inch diameter of tortilla filled meat.  And your choice of meat will greatly affect the overall enjoyment.  I went with the carne asada and much like the tacos, it was decently flavored, but a bit dry.

Garcia's made me the biggest burrito I've ever had and coming from the state that has Chipotle and Qdoba competing for your attentions that's no mean feat. Better yet, it was good.

McKinley"" dinner theater show.  To mourn/celebrate/encourage his departure, his friends all gathered at Ricochet's on Lincoln until the wee hours of the night.  In fact, my own arrival was well after 11pm, thanks to a late improv show at a north-side high school and a very fussy baby. At around 1 am, when people had been there long enough to be polite and to work up a healthy appetite, someone suggested we head to Garcia's.  And we did! Garcia's is wonderful for several reasons.  First, it's open very late.  And they don't treat you like late night visitors.  They treat you like it's dinner time, and you're not a fool/loser/bad parent for eating your supper at 1 am.  They seat you at a table, just like a civilized person.  And even though you're probably intoxicated, and the people you're with are babbling about the quality of meat in Argentina and which days Hot Doug serves duck fat fries, you're given a nice napkin to drop in your lap. Second, Garcia's food is ultra cheap.  I ordered three tacos, couldn't even clean my plate, and dropped about $5 on the meal. And third, the food is great.  I've had a few different things there at all sorts of hours, and never once have I been disappointed.  Granted, at 1 am you really drop your standards... but quite honestly when I eat at Garcia's I never feel like I've sold myself short.  It's never, ""ah crap, Garcia's is the only thing open?""  It's always, ""Oh, whoooopy!  Garcia's is open!""

I first went to Garcia's with a group of friends and had a blast and have been introducing other friends to the place ever since. The food is almost always fantastic. In fairness, I do tend to stick the the same few dishes, but I have been making it a point to branch out a little more. (Recommended: enchiladas). I did try their Spinach quesadillas, though, and was disappointed. They were soggy and not what I expected from a place that has such satisfying cheese quesadillas. Oh well. What they lack in spinach they most definitely make up for in Pineapple margaritas. If for no other reason, check out Garcia's for those--they also have mango and the usual strawberry and a few other flavors. They are PHENOMENAL, as in delicious and strong.  The service, I have noticed, is something that can improve. The hostess is usually pretty nice, but the wait-staff doesn't have much consistency.

I looked on Yelp for a place close to my house and this was only a block away and favorably reviewed. We gave it a shot thinking it would be a little nicer than where we normally go, El Taco Loco a few doors down. First off when we walked in there were only two tables that could hold larger parties (there was 5 of us). One of the larger tables was being used by two cops and the other by a couple and their baby who was in the stroller. We sat at two taller tables which were divided by a half wall. No biggie I guess.  Anyway, the menu was extensive and it was definitely cheap for a sit-down Mexican restaurant. Of course you have to pay extra for everything like cheese and sour cream which may or may not be added to your meal and then you may be charged for it regardless. They will tell you it is in there even though you have dug through your entire burrito and have not found one trace of cheese or avocado. This happened to both people who ordered the ""extras"". The free chips and salsa were good though. The guacamole was also too expensive for the amount you get. I had a vegetarian combo and everything was very bland. Everyone felt the same way except for one friend who said her steak and stuffed pepper combo was really good. The margarita I had was ok. A little too strong and it was obviously made with very cheap tequila. Not bad for $5 though. The strawberry one my friend had was better.

Main dishes are reasonably priced, starting from $7 for a taco plate with tacos burried in shredded cheese and veggies, to $15 for the full entrees. The food is good and when the place is not busy, comes quickly. When the place is busy, well, that's another story. At that point, grab a few drinks cuz you may be waiting.

Although I've moved beyond saying they have the best burritos I've tasted, they still one of the biggest. My favorite is the steak burrito with avocado and cream cheese.

On the plus side Garcia's is open late and when I'm out late, I'd much rather order here than take my chances with some Speedy Burrito place that may or may not cause digestive discomfort later on. All in all this is a long time establishment that has seen Lincoln Square change all around it. There are better places, but for most people on the northside, Garcia's will be good enough. Interesting Tidbit: I know two friends that while pregnant, couldn't get enough of the burritos from this place. They claim it was something in the food that made them crave Garcia's. I still think it was an excuse to finish the entire burrito. One still craves Garcia's at the oddest times of the day. Pros: Good all around Mexican food, reasonable prices, decent service and ambience. Take out is available. Cons: Prices on the high side for some, can get crowded and service suffers when this happens, can probably find better Mexican food for the price. To sum it up: It's Lincoln Square 2007. Be happy there is a Mexican place like this that is still around in this area.",0.994,0.835,0.135,0.03,0.44393543956043957

It wasn't bad, but I can't say that I've found THE Mexican place I will always visit without fail.

The quesadillas looked more like tacos than what I was expecting (and different from what I've had at other Mexican restaurants), but that's ok. The other person in my party ordered chicken fajitas, which was HUGE, with lots of veggies (always a good thing). He also liked the guacomole a lot, and I thought the rice and beans were good.

Skirt steak, chicken, and even veggie, these things come loaded and fresh. I can only finish their burritos when I'm hammered and, because Garcia's keeps late weekend hours I've finished many a burrito. And enjoyed them.  Garcia's Burritos are what I believe the people behind the chain ""Chipotle"" had in mind.  Outside of Burritos Garcia's offers many reasonably priced Mexican fare. You can easily eat and eat well for under $10.  Con's: The restaurant is on the small side so depending on when you go you might have to wait. I've only had to do that once in my many times having gone there though.

2006-10-17,4.0,"Health nazi's can sit this one out.  For the rest of us who enjoy a guilt free serving of old fashioned ""greasy spoon"" cookery, I hope you brought your appetite.   Nothing fancy about the food here.  Its just uncomplicated and satisfying Mexican diner food that just happens to come in big portions.  How big?  My girlfriend and I usually eat half for lunch, then doggy-bag it and eat half for supper. Nothing fancy about the atmosphere either.  Unpretentious, bustling, sometimes loud, but cozy in the manner of family restaraunts of old.  The staff seem happy to see you, which is always a plus. Last, but not least, is the price point.  Beer for two, meal for two (which lasted two meals each!), plus tip came out to about 14 or $15... or half the cost of an entre at De La Costa. [smirk] Garcia's loses 1 star for using fake quacamole, which is shamefull for  a Mexican restaraunt.",0.5983,0.866,0.081,0.052,0.3883333333333333

2006-08-05,4.0,"My wife and I nicknamed Garcia's ""El Pollo Loco"" for no other reason than endearment and affection. We discovered it the first night we moved into our Lincoln Square studio as they have these quesadillas for a buck to a buck fifty that are STUFFED, and I do mean STUFFED FULL of cheese and either meat or spinach. They're not heart healthy, they're not lo carb and they're not the best quesadillas you'll find but for a buck fifty you quite literally will not find a better deal for so much food.  Four of those, split down the middle between spinach and chicken with some salsa verde and a side of frijoles con queso fed me for under $6 and believe you me, I'm not an easy guy to fill up. Their burritos are also quite impressive altho the Taco Burrito King #2 down Western near Addison is better. However Garcia's makes up for this with the Burrito Suezo, slathered in ranchero and cheese. Suddenly what was an alright burrito becomes a really, really good one.  Funny that. Behold the power of cheese.",0.7784,0.831,0.094,0.075,0.49034722222222216

2006-04-17,2.0,"I was not impressed with Garcia's.  Just your average, typical Mexican food. The type where the entire plate kind of oozes together in a big mash of tasteless refried beans, wilted lettuce and soggy tortillas. The atmosphere is nothing special - usually crowded and loud with kids screaming  and slow service. Skip Garcia's and find a more authentic Mexican restaurant with less chaos.",-0.8695,0.836,0.0,0.164,0.4684173669467787
2006-03-25,5.0,"A friend of mine recommended Garcia's so I am here to do the same for you. The food is superb and it is a bargain to boot. I usually opt for the burritos, which are huge and the best burritos I have ever tasted. They are so filling too. They contain generous portions of meat, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato and - this is key - avocado. You have to get avocado, especially if you order chicken. They are also open late which is key for those nights when you have been out late and want something to eat before heading home. I suspect Garcia's is the reason there isn't a Chipotle within miles of Lincoln, Western and Lawrence.",0.9571,0.805,0.177,0.018,0.6326923076923077

2006-01-17,4.0,This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. It is very inexpensive and the quantity of food you get is ridiculous - you'll probably have to take some home. It's casual so don't expect hipster digs. It's located close to the brown line and in the heart of Lincoln Square.  Have the veggie burrito with avocado!!,0.4374,0.875,0.086,0.04,0.6944444444444443
