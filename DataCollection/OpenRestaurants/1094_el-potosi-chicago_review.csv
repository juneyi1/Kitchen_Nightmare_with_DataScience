On Monday I decided to try El Potosi after a friend recommended them when I asked where to go for great tacos; I'm a San Franciscan who's been living in Austin for the last few years, thus having been deprived of REAL Mexican food. (Texans, please stop trying to call Tex-Mex Mexican food, it's not, it's Tex-Mex.) I ordered the carne asada tacos and got a small horchata, the horchata was perfect! The tacos were great, but I was disappointed when I got home and saw that they were made American style (lettuce and tomato) instead of Mexican style (cilantro and onion) but they were still great. Good enough to leave me craving more. The next day (Tuesday) I decided to get tacos again but, as to avoid looking like ""that person"" I went somewhere else. Those tacos were alright, but nothing I'll ever go out of my way to get again. The disappointment meant that it, yet again, left me craving more tacos.  So, here it is, Thursday and I wake up with a whiskey hangover craving tacos like mad. I decided to go to El Potosi again. This time I made sure to ask for only onions and cilantro and oh em gee. I don't know what the man did, but I have never tasted tacos as beautiful as this EVER. I finished one and all I could think is, ""is this for real?"" Thankfully I had one more to go through.

2009-10-06,5.0,"If you're looking for the cheapest and best taqueria in Chicago, this is it. I've tried many of the small hole-in-the-wall taquerias in town and this one sits above the rest. I bike across the northside to eat here on a regular basis.  The burritos (in particular the chicken, which I usually despise as a burrito ingredient) are phenomenal. They also serve what I believe to be the best tacos in town. The prices are very low, as they are in most of these holes in the wall, but the food quality is great. Best to come during the summer and sit out front for a little neighborhood people-watching.  However, don't go here if you are looking for mad-service or are afraid of a little urban grit.",0.9456,0.85,0.124,0.025,0.41945868945868947
2009-08-07,4.0,"Despite the view (standard northwest side bodegas and cookie cutter condos), the location and mood inside the patio at this little BYOB Mexican joint can't be beat.   Seemingly plucked straight from a Baja beach town, the little yellow patio is only slightly more spacious than the inside, which, besides the kitchen only allows room for patrons at the counter and two other tables.  But why would you want to sit inside?  You will amaze yourself when you actually fit 6 friends around 1 table. Bring a take out margarita from Manny's up the street and enjoy it with greasy yet still above average burritos, tacos and enchiladas.  If you're hungrier larger plates of carne asade and rejenos will fill you up.  If the unlimited free chips and salsa don't first.  Best of all you still have a lot of money for another Tecate run at the liquor store next door.",0.925,0.861,0.118,0.021,0.4004385964912281

2009-07-14,4.0,"This place is run out of what was once the garage to the two-flat on Waveland that sits behind it. As burrito stands go, it's middle-of-the-road food-wise: I've had better and I've had worse.  But I just love the concept: build a floor inside the aforementioned garage, stuff a kitchen in it, add a main entrance to the side of the erstwhile garage, add a patio that extends out to the Elston Avenue sidewalk, put a red canopy over said patio, put 5 tables out and hang kistchy stuff from the canopy frame, and voila, you have a burrito stand. (Difficult to envision? Try Google street view.) And I just love, love, love sitting on that patio on the side of this little garage, eating a burrito suizo and washing it down with a BYOB Carta Blanca or two. On evenings when it's not busy, I'll even linger and finish of the better part of a six-pack. Three stars for the food plus an extra star for the patio ambiance.",0.9682,0.847,0.136,0.017,0.4307189542483659
2009-06-29,4.0,Going to El Potosi is like going on a mini-vacation... it really feels like you've left Chicago for a little town in Mexico.  The food is consistently good; I prefer the chicken over the beef - it's way tastier. The service is also good and pretty quick. Super cheap and super yummy!,0.9764,0.611,0.389,0.0,0.5803030303030303
2009-06-24,4.0,"welcome to shanty town. coming up on the right is el potosi, local taco hovel... seriously... this place looks busted, but that's part of the charm. most of the seating is on a tiny outdoor patio filled with bric-a-brac and painted with black and white donkey murals. you can byob, so grab a 6-pack before you come. the food was well above average for what amounts to taqueria food. i will tell you to save your calories and pass on the rice (fairly bland) and the shredded chicken (a bit dry). the two things i was doubtful of, the chiles rellenos and the flank steak, were freaking awesome! the steak was tender and grilled a perfect medium, which is hard to do on a steak so thin. the chiles were smokey and filled to the brim with gooey cheese. NOM. the chorizo tostada was delish, but a little heavy on the sour cream. both the salsas served with our food were great. the darker, tomato-based salsa was spicy and had a deep, smokey flavor while the tomatillo had a nice bright flavor with a bit of heat as well. much more complex than most tomatillo salsas i've had. definitely a great taco stop, especially on a summer day.",0.9914,0.751,0.202,0.047,0.6159598214285713

2009-05-24,4.0,"I would love to come to El Potosi with Nancy Pelosi.   Except that she would become Nancy Pe-lo-SEE, according my resident Spanish-speaking roomie. Madame Speaker doesn't seem like the taco type, anyway. After zipping by here so many times I finally stopped with a friend on a nice Memorial Day weekend Saturday. I think what I like best is it feels as if you've gone to some new town. The crazy haphazard and full-of-junk spot sports a Key West, or Southern California, or Mexico vibe, so as others have pointed out, authentic. And I like that very much. And what can one say about tacos? Pretty difficult to make really bad ones, I think. So, I have only had the chicken and steak tacos/platter, and it was very satisfactory and a good value. I would like to return for some other treats. Very friendly staff there, too.
