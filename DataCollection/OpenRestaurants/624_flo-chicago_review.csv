2017-09-02,1.0,"I've lived in the neighborhood for several years now. And I've really tried to like this place.  But every time I give it another chance, every time it disappoints. Today was the final straw and I won't go back again. Aside from the lackluster bland waitress that's always serving the brunch crowd outside, I mean really, try to smile, it's not going to kill you, the food is always about average. Today it was pretty simple. A chile cheeseburger, cooked medium rare. The first time it came out, it was cooked past well done. I flagged down the waitress, I had to because she never checked back to actually ask us how our food was, and asked her if she could have them recook the burger medium rare. She said ""I think I can do that"". Really? No, I'm sorry it didn't come out the way you ordered it...I apologize, I'll get that for you right away...no...not from this waitress who seems to give off an air of entitlement, as if we're lucky to be eating there and we're lucky she's bestowed her service upon us. Nothing. Just a ""I think I can do that"". I then apologized. As if I should have been apologizing because the kitchen couldn't get a cook to temperature correct. Anyways, the burger came the second time and the two guests I was with asked if it was cooked medium rare this time. I said, we'll see"". I cut into it...nope...it was done medium well this time. Seriously? I mean come on....after about 15 minutes the lackluster waitress grants us a visit. She asked how the burger was...I told her..overcooked again. She asked, ""do you want me to try again?"" Smh. No, I actually don't. If Flo can get cooking a burger right by try two...I think I'll be done. One would think that at minimum, the customer would then get an apology. Or maybe the waitress would offer to take the burger off the check because I barely ate it. Nope. Not an apology. And the burger was still on the check. I almost choked and it took me all the will power I had not to leave her less than 15% (I would feel guilty as I spent years as a server/bartender). But one thing I won't feel guilty about is giving Flo one star. They've gotten too big for their britches being the only brunch spot east of Ashland on chicago. But today was the straw that broke the camels back. I'll make the trek to the other side of Ashland to either whisk or west town bakery before I'll ever go to Flo again. Plus, another brunch restaurant is about to make an appearance on the block. Beatnik at Ashland and Chicago. Can't wait to finally get some other options in the hood. Maybe Flo will then start realizing that they have to actually provide good service and that they aren't entitled to my business as a customer. The thing of it is..I think if the service wasn't so atrociously bad, the burger issue wouldn't have been a big deal. But this waitress...every time, without fail, is just a grumpy unfriendly, person. I mean really, why are you working in the service industry? Wrong job for you. No one wants to come in and see your grumpy face and feel like they're a burden as a customer. Wise up Flo.",0.8063,0.838,0.089,0.073,0.4631964690638161
2017-09-01,5.0,"Flllloooo! I wanted to hang out with a buddy and he suggested Flo...hadn't heard of it since I live across the city, so would have gone even if I didn't know HOW FANTASTIC IT IS! I ordered a mimosa flight and the smothered burrito, which were both very good. There were a few different types of hot sauce on the table, which was a nice touch. The server was friendly and conversation was great...at this point Flo had a solid 4 stars going for itself.  Then, I got the fruity pebbles french toast. I have a sweet tooth, so they were getting ordered no matter what, but DAMN! I had no idea that adding these little guys to some french toast with berries on it would set off a chain reaction of flavors and an orchestra in my mouth. Seriously...they're that good. Makes sense though, you have the berries already, but then each ""pebble"" has a different flavor, like cherry, lemon, grape, lime, but I mean WHOA! It was literally a flavor explosion (in a good way). You know how when there's something delicious and then you get to the point where it's almost too much? Yeah, this stops just before that point, so it's maximum awesomeness but without even straddling the line of too much.  On the way home, I bought 10 boxes of fruity pebbles and started adding them to ever recipe I make:  breakfast smoothie, carrot cake, mandarin orange salad, bacon-wrapped filet...kidding, but that was what was running through my head during the first bite of this stuff. It's like my alternate life flashed before my eyes all in the span of a few seconds. In all seriousness, next time you're in the hood, check this spot out, and please, I beg you, don't skip the fruity pebbles french toast.",0.968,0.83,0.118,0.052,0.43203333333333327

Classic! So if you want something sweet but not to sweet go with this option. To add a salty aspect I ordered a side of thick cut bacon. Yum!  My boyfriend on the other hand is all savory! He ordered the FLO Style. Eggs, green sauce (poblano pepper sauce), pico, black bean, and a flour tortilla. After taking a quick pic of his dish he destroyed it by mixing it all together! I don't really eat eggs, but he was definitely impressed with how tasty it was without having any meat. They have a great patio area!  I'll be back next time to sit on the patio.

Everyone was happy with their meals, the chorizo and eggs, the three different flo combos. The kitchen/server split my smoothie with my sister for us. The coffee and triple berry smoothie was superb-I don't even care for smoothies made with yogurt but Flo did it well. We had Leonard (sp?) as our server and he was very prompt with our food and beverages and kind-even when we were a pain splitting the bill. The atmosphere was relaxing and positive. The music is a calm alternative mix that isn't extremely intrusive in terms of volume. The lights are perfectly dimmed for a morning after a long night with plenty of natural light coming into the front of the restaurant.

Flo, in my neighborhood, heard so many great things... and am underwhelmed. I walked in to have breakfast (I was alone and I like to get some work done during breakfast)... there was nobody there to greet. I didn't know if I should just sit anywhere, or wait. A woman finally surfaced and sat me. A gentleman then came to fill my water.  Nobody came to take my order. I had to flag someone down. Meanwhile, at the other tables, I hear the waitress rattle off specials, her favorites, some popular items... I was jealous... why could I have her? I ordered. Food was less than mediocre.

2017-03-17,5.0,"Mexican food is not New Mexican food. Mexican food is simply is not as good, but a million times more available. Green Chile is not the same as green chili. Green chile is rare in the midwest, more rare is green chile prepared the way New Mexican way. And Flo understands this. They have a piece of art on the wall that references the New Mexico Zia; the four directions, the four times of day, the four stages of life, and the four seasons, with the circle connecting them all. It can also represent the 4 full sized adult meals I ordered since I wanted to try everything on the menu. In the end I settled on the Green Chile Stew, the Smothered Burrito, with Green instead of red (i don't love red chile like i love green, but they will accommodate both), and shared with my wife her stuffed sopapilla, all washed down with a beer from...Mazatlan!?? Oh well. it cannot all be New Mexican. I wonder if they can import some microbrews from Taos Brewery one day?  The food was genuine. It reminded me of the food from home, in the heart of the southwest where you find green chile from the finest establishments, down to under-appreciated fast food joints like Blake's Lottaburger. They put avocado on the smothered burrito, without my asking for it, because they know that I would want avocado garnishing my burrito, and because that is they way it is done. Also, they call the smothered burrito, 'smothered,' not 'wet' - the preferred Midwest colloquialism, which sounds worse than soggy bread. The meat in the burrito is great, cooked to perfection, and in large chunks. They are not filled with rice, and chepaer ingredients to make their profits larger. The burritos at $12, are 2 meals for anyone under 150 lbs. That is a hell of a bargain. The Green Chile stew is a perfect cold day treat. It comes with tortillas, again, you don't even need to ask for them, becuase they already know how you want it. (I would get avocado on the stew as well though). For me, this is the best AUTHENTIC New Mexican food I have found in the Midwest since moving out this way over 6 years ago.

The wait wasn't bad because there are two wrought iron benches inside the waiting area. Once we got seated, the waiter was very attentive and always made sure to check on us and fill our water. We ordered the mimosa flight (Bellini, strawberry, and traditional) to split. The drinks were strong and a good price for the value ($12 total). I ordered the smothered burrito with chorizo and my friends had the chicken enchiladas and huevos verdes. All of the plates are huge, and everyone left feeling stuffed! I enjoyed my burrito so much, and I'm not normally a burrito person! This place definitely set the bar high on my burrito radar. The burrito came with a thick and delicious red sauce and had this nice, thick fluffy layer of scrambled eggs that covered the entire length of the spinach tortilla wrapper. There was plenty of cheese and beans and filling! The burrito could easily feed two people, but I ate all of it being the gluttonous creature.

I had the Jalapeño Bloody Mary which is literally puréed jalapeños instead of Tomatoes and it was delicious. They also make their own hot sauce which is amazing (I'm totally a spice connoisseur). They have a Habanero / Carrot / Honey hot sauce (orange), a Jalapeno / Garlic / Honey hot sauce (green), and a Chipotle / Mustard / Honey (red). I tried and loved them all but the red sauce was my favorite. Onto the food... my wife had, and loved, the cocoa pebbles French toast.

Drinks:  I ordered the Chile Verde Bloody Mary, which was interesting... and not the kind of interesting I would order again. It was average in spiciness and felt overly chunky (an adjective I feel should never be used to describe a drink).  Sweets:  Our table ordered the Bacon-Chocolate Pancakes and while you could visualize bacon pieces, the chocolate was the main player in this dish. The pancakes were tasty and sweet, but I wished the bacon/saltiness was more prominent.  Brunch:  All of our portions were HUGE! Chorizo-Tamale Hash - extremely DENSE dish with a large layer of corn masa. The sauce over it was monotonous, but the eggs overtop helped add some extra flavor. Chilaquiles Special of the Day - served an with over easy egg and I definitely thought this was the best dish at the table! Tasted fresh and had lots of complexity!

Luckily, the line moves fast, and they take rezzies. Sweet! The menu has a southwestern theme throughout the sweet, the savory, and the cocktails. Good luck deciding what to get. The mushroom tacos were hearty and flavorful. The Skirt Steak Eggs Benedict ($14) was done to perfection, and the chipotle hollandaise sauce was a great way to shake up a benedict. The Smother Rachero Burrito ($11) was probably the best bang for your buck: a generous portion of housemade chorizo plus eggs, as well as an mound of guac on top.

I typically order ok the healthier savory side of breakfast usually an omelette or Benedict with veggies but I read all the great reviews on the skirt steak eggs Benedict and decided I had to give it a try. Am I glad I did!! It was delicious. It came over toasted brioche with a chipotle Hollandaise sauce. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly and all of the flavored blended so well together. My husband likes sweet breakfast items and went with the fruity pebbles French toast one of his favorite cereals as a kid and his meal too did not disappoint. Service was fast and our waiter was very friendly. The coffee was great too which is always a plus. We will be back!,0.9958,0.714,0.286,0.0,0.5698412698412698

Flo was the latest place for our GNO group--5 of us met up and were able to snag the round table in back. They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait if you arrive after 10am.  They have patio seating now so I'm sure that helps alleviate a bit of the wait.  We do our usual brunch...we each order our drinks, main dish and then a sweet dish to try.  The menu showcases a lot of Mexican flavors in their brunch items. I opted for the special of the day--a barbacoa hash, topped with over easy eggs. It was pretty good. The beef was tender and the eggs perfectly cooked. It needed spice though and the table hot sauces, although nice flavor, didn't bring the heat that I wanted.  The sweet dish we shared was the fruity pebbles French toast. It was just like it says--fruity pebbles encrusted French toast.  And sweet it was.  Really sweet. All I needed was a bite to consider it dessert and Osi V was spot on in saying that a glass of milk would be perfect with it.  As well as some Saturday morning cartoons! My Hibiscus Mimosa was refreshing but kinda small.  The digs are cozy and relaxing. Kinda like a siesta.  Service was stellar.

I tried the Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas for my entree. The dish includes a side order of rice and black beans (I'm not sure why black beans, since Mexicans eat brown and pinto beans). The enchiladas were soft, laden with chicken and cream, but lacking any original touch - I had to add salsa roja to give it some flavor.

My favorite dish is the huevos ranchero - very well made, flavorful, good portions and delicious with their signature hot sauces. I like the green hot sauce more than the red. I also enjoy the chilaquiles. I've tried the fruity pebble French toast, however was way too sweet to eat by one person. I'd recommend getting a dish for the table to share, because it is delicious. I've also tried the breakfast burrito, which is good but probably not my favorite.  The guacamole is also always on point!

I had been looking for a place to get a decent chilaquiles ever since returning from my recent Mexico trip and now I know I can get them here.  And the other find?  They make a green bloody Mary with some other type of green pepper that was a hit with our group.

2016-04-30,3.0,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I'm a real New Mexican. And this is a New Mexican restaurant in Chicago. So my expectations (nay, hopes) were high! It was super hard to reach the restaurant, their reservation website didn't fully work, and this location didn't return my reservation phone call for over a week. When I finally got through, I was able to make a reservation for 4. We went tonight for dinner. The neighborhood, atmosphere, and decor were all absolutely darling. We started off with a round of cocktails, which were decent, but not mind blowingly inventive. I ordered a round of nachos as appetizers, which took a pretty long time to arrive, but were super delicious. We decided to place our entree order when the appetizer came, based on how long it was taking. Most of us ordered the green chile enchiladas (classic!) but I got the veggie burrito with chicken and my husband got the green chile burger. All were tasty, but again, not authentic. The green chile tasted like a poblano sauce with cilantro- which was interesting, but should not be calling itself hatch green chile sauce. That's sort of sacrilege. Everything was MEGA seriously salty. A little too salty, sadly.  Plus was that our waitress knew what Christmas meant. (Half red, half green) Minus- we asked for sopapillas with the meal. Not only did they not come with the meal, but I had to hunt our dear waitress down to get them. And when they came (*gasp*), they were pallid, round,  thin, and sad. And $4 each. Also sacrilege. Sopapillas should be thick, square or oddly shaped, deep golden brown, and not resemble tortillas in any way, shape, or form. I wanted to love our waitress. She was cute and preggers and initially seemed cool. But damn, the service was slow. And we never got a water refill, even when all the other tables seemed to. And that shiz was salty. Le sigh. So, overall, I'm super disappointed from a NM standpoint. Otherwise, if you're comparing this to regular Mexican food in the city, it's pretty good. I'm sad! I wanted this to be my new obsession!

Got there around noon and were told it would be about an hour wait for our party of 3, seemed pretty standard for a Sunday brunch. After about a half hour we were trying to decide whether to head to a coffee shop nearby while we waited, so asked the hostess how long our wait might be from that point. She refused to tell us any estimate and said she'd already given us a time when we got there. They do offer free coffee while you wait, but the hostess also told us they were out of cups.  We eventually took some spots at the bar and placed our order. The bartender was pretty busy while we were there, so didn't get much attention (water was never refilled). We each got a savory item (smothered burrito, huevos verde, and chicken enchiladas). They were all decent, but were swimming in sauce. I got the burrito, and I probably would have gotten it without sauce if I knew that. At times it was hard to tell what I was eating through all the sauce.

2015-12-16,4.0,"My husband and I decided to stop in to Flo on a whim looking for some late night eats. I had heard about brunch here, and nothing but good things, but never about dinner so we figured we would give it a try. Flo is a pretty unassuming minimalistic place, clean, modern interior with some old-fashioned touches.  Overall nice vibe and wasn't too busy when we got there around 8 p.m. on a Wednesday. We were seated right away and the server told us the specials and also gave us a few suggestions of her own after I asked for some help. They have several varieties of sopapillas, these are lightly fried dough shells filled with your choice of fillings topped with either green or red sauce. We opted for the shrimp with the green sauce and the potato chorizo with red sauce, both were very tasty with a good amount of flavor and a little kick of spice. I didn't realize they would be as large as they were, so be careful when ordering multiple. We decided to split an entree thankfully, since the sopapillas already filled us up a bit. The entree we decided on was the pork in red sauce served with potatoes, this was our least favorite of dishes, while flavorful the pork was a little dry and the plate itself didn't have much dimension, very heavy on the sauce almost stew like.  We didn't think we were going to do a dessert but I asked what the options were just out of curiosity (I have a bit of a sweet tooth), the first of two options was another sopapilla just a desert version with honey and powdered sugar and ice cream which we decided not to go with and the other was right up our alley our favorite combo, chocolate peanut butter brownie Sundae, oh sweet baby Jesus! This was not your mama's brownie it was the most magnificent dessert ever and I've had a lot, the brownie seemed almost fresh out of the oven very moist ( I know, I hate that word too but no other way to describe it) with big chunks of peanut butter topped with a delicious vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup, so freaking good! With so many great restaurants in the city I'm not sure if I will be back right away for dinner but I am definitely curious about brunch since that's what everybody seems to go for oh yeah and that amazing dessert.  Overall flow is a solid choice not too pricey good service and tasty food.",0.9885,0.782,0.143,0.075,0.5176830966304651

2015-08-03,5.0,"I have been a northsider since moving to Chicago, and have been attempting to check out the under appreciated south for a while now. Flo was recommended by a regular at a favorite coffee shop as a great brunch spot, and my boyfriend, who used to live in the area over 5 years ago, did not realize it was still around so we made are way to the restaurant. Can I just say I love bars/restaurants that primarily play mid-2000s indie rock? Because I do. Everything on their playlist were bands I regularly listen to (because I am stuck in college, apparently) and really set a hip, comfortable vibe. Giant abstract artwork in earth tones with ripped and restitched canvas covered the dining room and added to the hip atmosphere. Everything was very warm and inviting. My boyfriend recognized a few of the servers from 5 years ago - always a good sign. Our server, Omar, was attentive but not overly so and was very friendly and made great recommendations. Brought out chips immediately and got our drink and food orders out fast. Ordered a cholula bloody mary and was pretty excited about it - but it was watery and mostly tasted like weak non-cholula hot sauce and mezcal. Could have been more savory and was ultimately the biggest disappointment. Coffee was great, but I didn't get the chance to ask what they were serving. I got green chile chicken enchiladas with a fried egg and extra hatch chile BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED that it was on the menu as a southwesterner who has yet to see it on a menu in the midwest. Chicken was juicy and spicy, green sauce had a great char to it, and the egg on top was the perfect touch. Boyfriend got mole chilaquiles, which was the special on that day. Mole sauce was not overly chocolatey in textrue like it traditionally is, but it worked well with the chips and definitely as chilaquiles. I admit that I may have heavily suggested that he order it, and I wish we had split them down the middle! These dishes were both served with black beans and brown rice, rice was great but I wish the beans had been refried. We arrived a bit later for brunch and while they were obviously setting the dining room for dinner service, we didn't feel rushed or ignored at all.

These jokers were warm, flavorful! So good! I'm getting hungry now just writing about them. We mostly go on Saturdays but one day during my maternity leave I went during the week(another chorizo tamale craving) and If you wanted to see a pregnant lady cry that would have been the day. I found out they only serve  tamales during weekend.I would have got up and left but my big self at friggin 500 months pregnant had just walked an ENTIRE BLOCK and was too pooped to protest! So I just ordered the tacos!!!! #firstworldproblems They were delish as well. The servers are wonderful very attentive and helpful when navigating the menu. The spot is not that large but clean and that's a plus. Wonderful chill spot for a lazy weekend brunch for a modern twist on traditional Mexican breakfast!",0.9426,0.757,0.15,0.093,0.5489583333333333

We were quoted 30 mins but it was more like 45 mins. The most important part though is the wait was definitely worth it!! Every plate of food we saw while waiting looked so good! We ended up getting the fruity pebbles french toast, the ranchero smothered burrito and the huevos verdes. Everything was awesome! The french toast was one of the most creative dishes I've ever seen and it tasted almost like it was deep fried. SO GOOD! The burrito was huge and really tasty and the green chile sauce on the third dish was just the right amount of spicy for me. We didn't order any drinks but the breakfast cocktails looked really good as well! I've been to quite a few brunch places in Chicago and this was one of my favorites. They have a unique combination of creative french toast and pancakes with all the traditional Mexican breakfast dishes.

The Fruity Toast tasted great, with berries on top which totally enhanced the flavor. The Cocoa Toast tasted kind of like cardboard, since Cocoa Pebbles don't have much taste by themselves, and they were not enhanced by chocolate in a similar fashion. The French Toast itself was kind of dry and tasted just like bread, not battered. The Chocolate Bacon Pancakes were by far the standout and were absolutely DELICIOUS! Light and fluffy with tons of flavor and the amazing crunch of bacon. By the way, the side of bacon was great too- thick cut and not too greasy.

2015-03-29,4.0,"I'm having a difficult time writing this review, but I think I'll have to settle on 4 stars -- 3.5 isn't available. So, Flo's food is okay. Good sized portions, but the two dishes I've had pretty much tasted identical, except the presentation was different. There was no distinct flavor that stood out in either dish. A lot of the menu items come with ""Flo potatoes"" -- thus I was expecting some grand thing I've never eaten before, but they ended up being sorta-mushy potatoes. Womp womp. The reason why this is a 4 and not 3 is because Flo has one of the best buttermilk pancakes I've had in this city. The edges of the pancake aren't smooth and the thickness tapers off so that the sides are crispy enough to add some texture. With a good amount of powdered sugar atop the flapjack, my ladyfriend said it reminded her of a funnel cake.",0.9711,0.82,0.153,0.027,0.5769230769230769

This is a pretty small place and it gets BUSY. We came in around 11a and it was packed. We waited about 15 minutes for a table. They do have some pretty awesome and free coffee to enjoy while you wait. We got seated at the table closest to the door which was sufficiently annoying, but the host did ask if we were OK with the table before seating us. I'd recommend just waiting a bit longer to avoid it, if it's really busy. Drinks: I ordered the Chile Rojo Bloody Mary with vodka and my BF ordered the Cholula Bloody Mary with Bacon Bourbon. Both of them were absolutely amazing. The best ones we've ever had, and that's saying a lot. Food: My BF went with the smothered breakfast burrito with both the red and green sauce. It was the perfect balance of flavor and heat. Guacamole was awesome as well. I ordered the chilaquiles which were the best I've ever had. My mouth is literally watering as I think about it. We got a nice side of bacon as well. Service: Our waitress was great and totally emphasized with our seating situation. She apologized and did her best to keep people from standing on top of us. Everything came out very quickly and our water glasses were never empty. We will definitely be back again very soon, and I may even try those huevos rancheros that originally brought us in.",0.9966,0.711,0.244,0.045,0.6161290322580646

2015-03-12,4.0,"I remember bookmarking flo last summer when I was trying to find brunch locations in Chi for my friend's Bachelorette Party. I didn't pick this place because we had about 15 girls and the downside of Flo is that they don't take reservations. And, it was in an area I had really never been to before and not at all close to the rest of our plans. BUT, I'm glad I had it bookmarked for my most recent trip to Chicago for my birthday! We ended up here Saturday morning. We only waited about 15 mins before they called my name, but our entire party wasn't there- so we ended up waiting another 15 minutes after they all got there. While you wait, they have free coffee available to you, which is a wonderful perk - but what I don't understand is, as soon as you sit down, the menu lists coffee at 2.50... so get your coffee fix before you get a table, I guess. Our waiter was extremely nice and talkative, but the only issue was- he talked really fast and had a VERY thick accent, so most of us didn't understand about half of what he said. The entire menu looked mouth watering!! And, if I could have sat there for days and tried everything, I would have. I finally settled on the Smothered Ranchero Burrito - sans chorizo (a MASSIVE breakfast burrito literally STUFFED with eggs, black beans, pico, and cheese - smothered in red chile sauce and topped with some tasty guar). The burrito was quite possibly one of the best breakfast burritos I've had in a long time. I usually pour hot sauce over everything, and this one was so tasty on its own that I didn't need any!! The Flo potatoes that came on the side, however, were a different story. Super bland in my opinion and it wasn't really remedied with hot sauce :-\ Everyone else really enjoyed their meals. I tried my friends red chilaquiles since that was one of the items I had my eye on, and it was definitely delicious - I'm just glad I got my burrito!  I ordered a cholula bloody mary with a  beer back which was delicious enough - I've honestly had better bloody marys. And, I also had a classic mimosa which was delicious. Overall, I loved the meal!! I wish they took reservations, but it's a small place, so I understand why they don't! If you're looking for a good brunch spot with some mexican flare, I would definitely check out Flo!

Stopped in the morning with my husband and let the hostess know our party would be for 4 but we were still waiting on our friends because of the bad weather. She told us we couldn't be seated until they arrived although they had several open tables available. Let me just say this policy of not seating small groups until the entire party is present is completely stupid and should be done on a case by case bases. Either way we stood by the entrance for a few minutes and then asked if we could sit at the bar while we waited for our friends. The hostess then proceeded to lecture us about how she typically seats at the bar and wouldn't be able to let us sit and wait there despite the fact that the bar was completely empty. Me husband pointed out the bar was completely empty and said we were going to order coffee and she said she would make and exception. There was one open booth that could seat 4 and she sat a couple that had just walked in .....and of course right behind them walked in our friends when she then tells us it would now be a 30-45 minute wait!!!! To say I was angry would be an understatement. Just as easily as that hitch hostess seated the couple that had JUST walked in at a booth that seated 4 she could have easily seated me and my husband!

Quite frankly, I don't have the discipline to pre-game with coffee and not continue at the table. Kudos to Flo, however, for executing the appearance of ""free coffee while you wait"".

The article had a mouth watering picture of the Fruity Pebbles French Toast (could be gimmicky, could be amazing) and the rest of the menu looked interesting enough. Food presentation was very nice looking but the overwhelming characteristic of our food was watery/soggy. I got the Chorizo Tamale Hash - two flavorless runny poached eggs atop an extremely thin veneer of chorizo sitting on a masa cornbread base that was way too thick for the  other components. This was sitting in a flavorless watery red sauce with watery black beans on the side. My daughter got the Fruity Pebbles French Toast - it looked as good in person as in the picture - but after a few initial bites, the cereal topping became a soggy mush. The berries that were garnishing the french toast tasted like they were rinsed in water to remove any syrup or other flavor that might have remained on them.

It was our go-to for late brunches, work lunches, everyday dinners and special occasions.

I'm happy to say, Flo is still one of ""our"" favorite places. Sure, brunch, for us, is now breakfast and dinners are on the early-bird side (unless we make it a date night), but Flo hits the spot every time. The new owners have kept so many of our favorites -- not a drop of poblano sauce gets left behind on our plates -- and the duck taco special has earned a special place in my heart. Amazing cocktails and/or a kale smoothie always perfectly round out the meal. To top it off, the staff at Flo has always accommodated our five year old. Sure, there's no official kids' menu, but they were happy to make a cheese quesadilla and bring some extra chips for Mr. Picky. Today, the neighborhood is bustling more and more every day.

2014-05-04,1.0,"Let me start by saying that I came here before, a few weeks ago, and we loved it. If I had rated them before, I would have given them 5 stars, not because of the service, but the food is delicious. We didn't hesitate to suggest this place for brunch when my boyfriend's parents came in to visit. I had high expectations.  When we got there, we were definitely expecting a wait. It was Sunday brunch and the place has really good food. I was actually surprised when the host said it was only 35 minutes. But 35 minutes passed, and he clearly did not have a plan. I wasn't sure about exactly how long it had been (I knew somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour), and I wanted to give him a chance to apologize for the extended wait, so I asked him what time we came in. I was a hostess for 5 years and know that in order to keep track of wait times, you have to write down the time the people came in. His response was a crazy look and, ""I have no idea!"" He was clearly not apologetic. I'm okay with long waits, I'm even okay with the host being off by about 15 minutes or so. It is actually really difficult to estimate wait times, so I'm sympathetic to that position. But when the wait time is double what you say, you've got to start apologizing, giving updates or even just look like you care, even a little bit. He didn't.  After another 15 minutes, the host offers the four of us seats at the bar. I have nothing against sitting at the bar and actually favor it when I'm hanging out with someone I see often, but with family from out of town, I want to be able to sit and talk to everyone. That's difficult at a bar. I said no. It was actually the only right thing he did the whole time, but I was hungry and clearly not happy, so I think he took offense.  So another 15 minutes passes (now it's been about an hour and a half) and my boyfriend's father asks the host again. This time, the host starts ranting about how he would never go to a place without a wait because that means they must not have good food and about how there are two other places on the block that could seat us right away. He even knows the owner and will personally call to ask if they have a table for us. Note this is all with a super snarky attitude and while there are other people standing right in front of him waiting to put their names in and he is flat out ignoring them. We say no, we aren't happy but we know the food is amazing and at that point, we had already put in all the effort and waiting, might as well stick it out.  The host disappears soon after and what I assume to be the owner, or one of the owners (there were two ladies there that looked as though they may hold this position), takes over the seating. Within the next 15 or so minutes (so we ended up waiting about 2 hours), a table gets up and it is cleaned. The lady says our name, we come up and she points at the table. That's it. So we sit.  The server was okay, not overly friendly, but definitely not rude, very satisfactory. He is not at all to blame.  The food was delicious, as we expected, but neither of the ladies ever came by to apologize, ask us if they could make it up, nothing. I mentioned this at the end of the meal, and my boyfriend's father, the outgoing person he is, mentions it to the host as he walks by. He asks him if they are going to make up for the inaccurate wait time. The host replies with much sarcasm, ""well was the food good!?"" And my boyfriends father replied calmly with, ""yes, but that's not the problem."" And he just kept saying was the food good over and over again. As this is happening, one of the ladies is standing with the host, watching. I expected her to use that time to apologize, but she did not. She just watched. Maybe the host owns the place and I'm just wrong, I don't really know.  Anyway, my boyfriend's father walks out, because at that point, he was frustrated and was just going to wait outside. While he was waiting outside, the host and one of the ladies stood less than five feet from our table and were clearly discussing us, as the host kept looking over and rolling his eyes at us. Considering I'm assuming he is an employee, I was willing to forgive him although it made me very very uncomfortable. He walked back to try to do his job and the lady stayed in the same spot, where the second lady joined her to start talking about us more. This went on for a good few minutes and it was the most uncomfortable situation I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  We paid and got up to go. I went outside, but my boyfriend's mother had to use the restroom, so we were waiting by the door, where there were some people waiting. I told my boyfriend's father what happened and it set him on fire, so he flipped them off. One of the ladies stomped outside and started shouting at him that everyone has to wait. We walked away at that point. As good as the food is, I will NEVER return. It was awful and ruined my boyfriend's birthday.",0.981,0.806,0.109,0.085,0.500656850459482

As I am always on the quest to get out of my rut, in the interest of expanding the yelp-o-sphere (groan) we decided to meet up at Flo's on a quiet Friday night to catch up over drinks and chips. The menu of drinks was definitely not what I was expecting, in a good way. I noticed that the shelf above the bar featured Koval whiskey, so decided to try their special barrel-aged Manhattan. I was pleased that I did, as this was the perfect drink on this night, and matched the décor and mood (if that makes sense). My friend ordered the wine (house red) which she stuck with throughout the night. I eventually moved to the wine, but am unquestioningly glad to have had the experience of that Manhattan.  Throughout the evening, there was never any point at which the space got overly loud and the music--if in fact it was there--was unobtrusive. The service was attentive, without being hovering, which was much appreciated as we ended up holding up the bar for quite a while eating, drinking, and talking. I suppose we could've moved to a table, but the bar setup was so inviting that we would have been hard pressed to leave midstream, especially as it seemed like there were quite a few diners coming in who had made table reservations. The portions are definitely plentiful. We went with the shrimp tostada and an order of the chips and guacamole. The chips are very light, and the shrimp served with the tostada were fresh.

Besides the above, the menu is full of inventive dishes with a Mexican flavor, including brunch. I have had several brunch and dinner items and enjoyed them all. It also has a liquor license so you can get Mimosas and their specialty Bloodies for brunch. You will enjoy the food, staff and setting at this place.

We were near the door and the 2 door air lock system wasn't really doing its job, every time the door opened cold air came in. I ordered the Chorizo Omelet. We seriously got our food within 5 minutes of placing our order. We were very impressed, although almost felt rushed it was so quick. My chorizo omelet tasted under seasoned, the chorizo had no spice  and very little flavor to it and I resorted to using the hot sauce they provided and neither sauce was particularly tasty. My dish came with Flo's potatoes, which tasted and appeared they had been sitting in a warming dish for a while. I even ordered a coke to drink and even though there was ice in it, the drink was still warm. Very weird. I'm usually not this picky. We got our bill. The food is very reasonably priced and the service was great. But when paying it seemed as if they were rushing us out door, kind of uncomfortable. We were there for maybe 35 minutes at the most.

The mussels are amazing, get them as an appetizer, the nachos are not to be missed, ah hell, the whole damn menu is amazing, even the salads are big enough to satisfy. I've never been disappointed coming here; they also have half bottle nights on Tuesday and let me tell you, these are great wines to select from. So go!!!!!

It was a special of the day and I wrongly assumed the specials were as described; special. Instead I received a bland mishmash of dry french toast with a small amount of chocolate spread. Why me? Was I disappointed? As everyone else enjoyed their Mexican brunch, I'd say I felt like the one at the table who got stiffed. Mislead by a black board of specials appealing to the soft spot in me.

He then proceeds to ask if I want a sugar rim.  I say, again, I ordered a Manhattan.  He says he knows.  Do I want a sugar rim? Uhm, NO? Anyway, he brings my drink out, sans rim, with about an inch of frothy head on it.  There are two things that I know to be true about Manhattans; they don't have salt OR sugar rims, and they are always stirred, not shaken.  Yuck!  In a city like Chicago, if you're going to have a cocktail menu, especially with classical cocktails, you better be ready to compete with some incredible mixologists making waves around the city with creative, knockout drinks.  Its sink or swim.  I enjoy cocktails and I'm in no rush to spend my money on one at Flo's anytime soon.",0.9863,0.79,0.168,0.043,0.5323722943722944

""Little"" might not be an accurate description in terms of floor space but that was the impression I got as it was extremely crowded both times I walked in and does seem a bit cramped.  The wait time on Saturday and Sunday is on par with any other good brunch place in Chicago. The great thing about waiting for a table though is that you get all the free coffee that you want until you are seated. The downside is that there is not much of a waiting area. What makes Flo stand out is the Mexican-influenced cuisine. There are lots of tasty options for both meat and non-meat eaters and every person in the large group of people that I walked in with was extremely happy with their meal.

2013-02-17,5.0,"I wouldn't say that I wear the pants in my relationship but if there's anything I'm in charge of (besides litter box duty), it's picking where we go out to eat... except for just this one time, when my boo chose Flo and admittedly, I kind of expected to be underwhelmed. You see, I wouldn't say I'm picky, but I have a few caveats. 1. I won't eat at chain restaurants. I feel my money is much better spent elsewhere and that if chain is the ONLY option, I think my stomach real estate would be better rented by emptiness than soulless food. 2. I don't eat meat. Okay, okay. I definitely cheat on fish from time to time, but otherwise, no meat. Not that I'm offended by meat, because I'm not- I LOVE meat and of the past 6 or 7 years since I went veg, I've missed meat absolutely  every.single.day . 3. It has to be something really spectacular for me to patronize a business I've already been to, but otherwise, I like going to places I've never been before, broadening my horizons, yadda yadda.  4. I follow what a Yelp rating tells me pretty closely and at the time, Flo was dangling in the 3-3.5 star range. Not terrible by any means, but I'm never really running to a 3-star establishment.  So anyway, the manz picks Flo and we walk on over. It was pretty empty, but it was reeeeaaally early for dinner and by the time we left the place definitely filled out quite a bit.  We started off with a pitcher of red sangria, of which I have to cop to not doing my part on, though not for lack of trying. I just get all stopped up on fruit chunks in my straw and my date, well, I guess he just sucks better than I do... i keed, i keed. The rest of our meal was carefully guided along by incredible service and one hell of a specials menu- most notably the vegetable short-stack, which was kind of like a paleo lasagna. No pasta, no junk, just straight veggies and seasoning and flavor that was far bolder than I expected. It was certainly a heated battle over the last few bites, but that's no to sell their Flobimbop (a menu staple) short, as I'm a sucker for an over easy egg and bit of spice, so I think if I had make Sophie's choice style decision, I'd go back for the Flobimbop.  For dessert we got the sopapillas, which we ate so quickly I can't even remember how they taste, but I'll just have to assume that they were on par with the level excellence that came through in the rest of our meal. And I'd say the treat beyond the dessert had to be the price. Our Sangria pitcher added a $20 spot (give or take) to our bill, but our meals and dessert were less than $30.  I left wondering how my experience at Flo's seemed to be so incredibly above and beyond what the Yelp rating had suggested and noticed after reading through reviews that most of the lesser experiences were for breakfast and brunch service, which appears to be what Flo is primarily known for. I probably won't ever make it in to Flo for their breakfast or brunch service to see if the gossip is true- nothing against Flo, I'm just not a morning or breakfast person, but I'll definitely make it a point to return to Flo for dinner in the very near future... and maybe even let the dude-man pick a few more places since he's obvi proved himself worthy of the honor.",0.9663,0.792,0.119,0.089,0.4996926406926407

Cheesy, spicy, and filling. - Breakfast burrito - hard to imagine a better egg-based burrito.  Ingredients are super fresh with minimal grease, which is rare. - Carnitas Hash - VERY nicely done carnitas with just the right amount of heat.  Ask for extra guac on the side to perfect this winner. - Margaritas - though pricey, they do it right with their own sour mix, not that pre-made sugary dreck that most places sling Lowlights: - Crowd - don't bring groups here or expect a table within an hour on weekends - Volume - don't expect to converse with people more than 3 feet away - Service - Flo's popularity leads to servers pressuring you to move along Bottom line: I love this place for New Mexican when I have 3 hours to spare for weekend brunch, but that's rarely the case.

Super friendly and helpful. I told him it was our first time and he offered up a menu and some tips to consider when we are sat. *loving this place already*. The most important was that there are mimosa flights you can choose from that change from week to week. How cool is that? The restaurant is cute and cozy and you can tell long after people have eaten, fullness and conversations set in and extends their stay. When we sat down, we were greeted by our waiter, who unfortunately, was really hard to understand, but was very nice. After some back and forth, I settled on the smothered ranchero burrito with chicken apple sausage as opposed to the stewed beef, and scrambled egg whites.This was amazing! It was filling but light? How can that be? Well the black beans, fresh pico, spinach wrap were all helpful in the effort. My dining mate had the skirt steak eggs benedict and said it was delicious, but my burrito may have won out! Then lastly the mimosa flight -- it was a traditional mimosa, a peach mimosa, and a rose' mimosa (my favorite). Each flight was $12 but I felt it was worth it.

2011-11-12,2.0,"Saturday Brunch - party of two, sat at the bar. There aren't many, but here are the positives. Coffee while you wait for a table is great (never mind that it was empty and it took 10 minutes to refill it once they were told). The green and red ""hot sauces,"" while not particularly spicy, had a great flavor. The poached eggs on the Chorizo-Tamale Hash were just about perfectly cooked and the food comes out fast. Now on to the negatives - service was terrible. We asked if the orange juice was ""fresh squeezed,"" to which the dark-haired female bartender responded that it was. Then we watched her pour it out of a 1/2 gallon jug with a label on the side. Upon inquiry, she responded that they buy it from an orange juice company and its ""like fresh squeezed."" Last time I checked ""fresh squeezed"" does not mean ""store bought."" In addition, she stood there chatting it up with some guy sitting right next to us while we had a chance to go through the entire menu and make our selection before even asking us if we needed anything. She never came to ask if I wanted a coffee refill, or even to see how our food tasted. The food was overall bland. The Tamale-Chorizo Hash had ""homemade"" chorizo, which tasted like un-spiced ground pork and a red chili sauce that tasted slightly of vinegar and little else. The black beans were also virtually tasteless. The Egg Sandwich was bland. It was supposed to have basil, but I couldn't taste any. The bread tasted like a sponge, the mayo was barely present, spinach was overwhelming compared to the lack of other flavors, and the potatoes were soggy and mediocre. The only redeeming feature about this dish is the roasted red pepper. Finally, for what its worth, the atmosphere was loud.

2011-11-04,2.0,"Oh babies. My babies. Flo, where did you go? Flo has been a go-to staple for the Rose and Company for nearly 10 years. It's a spot we like to bring out-of-towners to for all meals. We counted it as one of the best margaritas in the neighborhood. It was a date night given, a place to get ""fancy Mexican"" for a reasonable number of bills. But babies, Flo has changed ownership and our first experience was so not copacetic. Walking into a familiar place felt very different. We were immediately informed by the ""general manager"" (he gave us no name), before even a ""hello,"" that the place was under new ownership and that they were ""very disorganized."" Okay, the Rose can deal. We actually knew this change was coming. We felt like we'd give them a pass, go easy on them in their first week. But to see it happen, to feel it happen, was another experience entirely. The energy emitted by this general manager (we miss Anita already) and the owner (rushing in and out hectically) made us uncomfortable, which is a feeling the Rose does not often feel -- especially so in the confines of a place so easy-going as what Flo once represented. We got our first drinks promptly and the same menus we were used to, but after waiting an additional half an hour before a second marg' was even offered and our order taken, we were just five minutes away from standing up and walking out. Babies, this is not something the Rose ever even considers. We've had mediocre service at restaurants before, and we still tip the going rate, but it's a rare time when we want to just straight up leave. During that half hour wait, it wasn't just us ignored. There were other customers who were not given a look. It wasn't even clear there was a waitstaff. This is not Flo. The people in charge were too wrapped up in fussing over being new and disorganized. Fine, but if you've ever worked in a restaurant before you just know how to deal. The new people in charge made us feel that they'd never even worked on that side of the counter. The Rose has been there, child, and these people act like they've never even poured a drink. Which leads us into our second margarita. Undrinkable. Undrinkable? We might as well been served a glass of straight up lime juice. And damn, this place and Barco were our favorite margaritas in the neighborhood. We couldn't even take a pull off that glass without grimacing at each other. The food, though, oh babies the food was just as fine as it always has been. Thank Baby Jesus. Even finer, we'd say, after the confusing and disappointing start to the experience. If these new cats in town want to keep Flo successful, they better bow to the shrine of Lauro (the head chef) and keep that daddy happy. The cooks and the old school waitstaff are what will keep this place afloat. And what we noticed, girls and boys, was this new dude talking to the old regulars like they didn't speak his English. You enunciate, talk slow and loud, just to think that a guy who speaks Spanish first will understand you better. The words you're saying are the same. You don't have to talk to people like that. Especially when those people are an integral part of what made this restaurant a success in the first place. It was a general lack of respect that made this experience so crazy, both to the limited staff and to the unsuspecting patrons, and we left Flo feeling a little sorry for the mainstays who are still involved. The two stars of this review go entirely to the food. This treatise would have been a glowing five stars if we had decided to finally review Flo, after all these years, last week or last month or last year. We hope the great food doesn't leave before the new ownership has a chance to catch up. But to be completely honest, we're not sure we'll be returning. If Flo makes it through the winter, if it's actually still around in six months, we might give it another go. But for now, it's obvious to us there's no desire to experience that again. Babies, the Rose's poppa will be heartbroken next time he's in town when we don't take him to brunch at Flo. If you're an old Flo regular, give it a chance and see how you feel -- don't just listen to this old jabberjaw. Maybe it was just a little bad mojo in their first week. But Pubert has never had this kind of experience at any restaurant ever. If you've had a better experience, we'd love to hear it.  This is one case, the only case in memorable history, where we'd prefer you not tell 'em Pubert sent you.",0.9962,0.822,0.124,0.054,0.4965121813473461

The only thing that is keeping this place from getting a better rating is the atmosphere. We waited for several minutes at the door before someone showed us to a table and the waitstaff was, well...a little creepy.

2011-09-26,1.0,"This restaurant has the absolute WORST service I've come across in a long time. The server we had was incompetent from the very beginning and neither he or the manager took responsibility for their shortcomings. First, it took the waiter 40 minutes to bring us our drink order. Somehow, after checking twice with us about what we ordered, he managed to get my boyfriend's drink order wrong. We decided not to point this out and my boyfriend ended up drinking something he didn't order.  Then, we ordered dinner. My boyfriend ordered the pork burrito. The waiter brought him enchiladas instead. When my boyfriend explained that the meal was not what he ordered, the waiter, instead of apologizing, said ""This is good...you'll like it, just eat it!""  Finally, we got our bill. Not only did the waiter charge us for everything we ordered that he messed up, he OVERcharged us for the enchiladas that my boyfriend did not order. I tried to explain this mistake to the waiter, but he did not seem to think he had made any mistakes. I then asked to speak to the manager, who was a sour-looking woman who was reluctant to admit that there had been any errors. Fast forward to two weeks later, when I get my credit card bill. There was the one $110 charge for the dinner we had eaten. Five days after we ate there, the restaurant charged us a SECOND time in the same amount.

As I was flying solo, I was able to find a seat at the bar right away.  While I perused the menu (for what I considered to be an appropriately lengthy time period), the lady behind the bar (who I later found out was managing partner, Anita) asked if I had any questions.  I responded saying I was a first-timer and I had nothing BUT questions. She pointed to and explained four or five dishes on the menu that had ""made ""Flo"" famous"".  She continued, indicating the acclaim was due largely to their green and red chili sauces, both of which have been prized family recipes for nearly four decades.  I looked back at her, puzzled and she responded with a look that shouted, ""You look puzzled!""  She left momentarily and returned with two ramekins containing samples of the two famous condiments.  Wow!  I am conditioned to typical verde and red sauces being watery, pureed peppers and the like, but no.  These elixirs were each complex, rich and velvety, exhibiting disparate levels of heat.  I was hooked. My seat at the bar was directly adjacent to the kitchen service window and as such, I could see dishes coming out in a steady stream, each looking better than the last.  The menu item that finally caught my eye was the pulled pork taco offering.  Described on the menu as ""knife and fork"" tacos, they were served promptly with succulent, tender pulled pork on two fresh double-stacked corn tortilla shells.  The shells were further topped with salsa fresca, shredded Jack Cheese, slices of pickled jalapeno peppers and two perfectly fried eggs.  On the side were two stoneware vessels--a large one with expertly prepared, piping hot black beans and a smaller one with a very tasty pico de gallo.  It was a happy marriage of subtle, welcome textures and profoundly satisfying flavors.  There was love in every bite.

For my main dish, I ordered Baja Tilapia Tacos, 2 tacos with panko breaded tilapia, romaine leaf, pico de gallo and asiago, served with side salad.  Good as well.  I wanted something light and this was fine. Overall, I would give this place just an ok.  Not sure if I would return. The place is very small but decent for 16 ppl (the number in our group).  The staff was fine.  The ambiance was ok (only because it was a bit dark in the back area where we were located.

I'm always happy to revisit my old 'hood, West Town and since Flo was bookmarked on my sister's yelp list and recommend my a foodie friend, we headed on over. Glad we stopped by since there wasn't a long wait, we headed over to the bar area and immediately ordered. Flo is an average size cozy space with some outdoor seating. It wasn't overly crowded or loud, like the usual Chicago brunch spots.  This could be a good thing if you just want a good brunch without the hassle. We ordered the full order of the  ""Brazilian French Toast:""  (3 slices of challah toast with sliced pineapple, banana, strawberry and a dollop of zabione, dusted with toasted coconut and served with almond butter) and we also split the ""Huevos Rancheros:"" (a classic New Mexico red chile enchilada filled with cheddar cheese topped with over medium eggs,served with black beans & a warm tortilla). We asked the server what the most popular brunch items were and she replied the Huevos Rancheros and Red Chilaquiles. I was glad since I was in a Mexican brunch mood. Our food was good. I was surprised at how light and fresh everything was; I wasn't overly full after polishing off my plates. My companion was not impressed with her dishes - when asked how everything was, I got no reply. The bill was around $26 with coffee and iced tea. A good price for a weekend brunch in Chicago. Would I go again? Probably not. Although, I think this is a good spot if you want an affordable, non-hassle brunch in West Town.

2011-05-18,3.0,"Let me preface with how much I hate Tex-Mex food.  Everything kind of just tastes the same, and has that gross chipotle-ish seasoning.   This place is different.  It's BETTER. I've been here twice, for weekend and weekday brunch. The weekends get crowded, as to be expected, but they have coffee for people waiting, which is a nice perk. In contrast, the weekdays are much slower - there actually are open seats in the restaurant.   On both occasions, the service was super quick - it took an hour from the time I sat down until I paid the bill.  This is super useful when you're going to have awkward brunches with people who are less-than-friendly to you, and you just want to eat and get moving. I don't remember what I ordered the first time, but it was delicious.  If you have a choice, definitely order the home fries as a side instead of the rice.  Much more flavorful.  Recently I ordered Flo's Original Breakfast Burrito, which I thought was good, but not quite impressive.  Definitely not impressive enough to try to stuff myself with the second half of the burrito.  My friend ordered a mushroom and spinach enchilada with garlic sauce.  That was much tastier, and I nibbled off of her plate. Of course every brunch involves drinking.  There were 3 bloodymary-esque drinks.  The one with chile verde was interesting to say the least.  The taste seemed a little 'off', and not quite to our liking. Overall, it's a good restaurant.  Not quite seeing how it's worthy of a Michellin recommendation, but there's enough variety on the menu that I would want to try other dishes here and bump up my rating.",0.9923,0.761,0.184,0.054,0.5005847953216375

We've only eaten dinner here once, and it was for Valentine's Day.  They had a special Valentine's Day menu and it was incredible.  But if you're in the area and you're hungry for breakfast food, nobody does it better.  Just get whatever you can slather in sauce, because not only do they make their own fresh red and green chile sauces, they also make their own hot sauces for the table, and they are all the bomb.  I always end up putting at least two or three sauces on whatever I eat, not because it needs it but because the sauce is so amazing. And now you can buy all of the sauces to take home!  Score!! I don't know what to tell you to get, because everything is good.  But, the things I get the most are the Huevos Verdes (with a side of red chile sauce), both of the awesome smoothies and the Eggs Flo (their take on benedict and their hollandaise is great).  The 3 berry zabione pancakes are also rich and delicious - I'm not able to get a whole sweet entree just for myself, but we always like to get one for the table - like an appetizer, if you will.  Please feel free to steal that idea - everyone should do it.",0.9956,0.803,0.181,0.015,0.6547619047619047

First things, first: the atmosphere is really laid back and while it's busy, it's not crowded and you don't feel squished or rushed. The decor is very mellow, pleasant, Southwest-y colors, I was most intrigued by a really cool mirror...anyway, it's nice.  We walked in around 11 and were quoted at 15 minutes for a table for 2, not bad at all considering the wait at places like Bongo. Cut that wait to 3 minutes when both parties ahead of us don't want to sit at the bar (which is nonsense because it was delightful).  I immediately ordered the Rojo something or other Bloody Maria, which was awesome. Just the right amount of spice and celery salt around the rim (my fav). For food, I ordered the chorizo scramble and destroyed that thing because it was delicious, so delicious that when I had to make a fullness-related sacrifice, I opted to finish it and not eat my potatoes. They also serve black beans with pretty much everything, which again is a total win. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito, I didn't try it but I want to next time I go, it had very delicious looking veggies, sour cream and cheese in it. I did try a few bites of my potatoes and they were ok, but not wow-good. The hot sauces are bomb, I even liked the chipotle one, which usually isn't my bag.

2011-01-24,4.0,"I visited Flo once before, back in the day when all of my bookclub ladies were single and childless. Back then we had no qualms about the waits at some of the tastiest and most popular brunch spots. Now that many of them have rugrats, we opt for places with in and out convenience and visits to places like Flo are now fewer and far between. Damn kids! Just kidding (or am I?). When we rescheduled our book club meeting, I saw the opportunity to reacquaint myself with Flo; my memories were faint, but favorable. My loyal brunching partner and I were fortunate and didn't have to wait long for a table, but if you're a coffee drinker they provide free coffee to take the edge off. We were seated in the front half of the room and started out with a Cava Champagne Mimosa, a perfect way to take the edge off my hangover. I decided to go off script with my breakfast choice and went for a savory item, instead of one of the tasty sweet options I normally salivate over. I ordered the Red Chilaqules with a slight modification; being the egg hater I am, I was able to sub breakfast potatoes for the eggs. The server thought I was crazy, but obliged. I got a generous serving of chilaquiles and they were fantastic. The red sauce packed a nice amount of heat; spicy enough to bitchslap my tastebuds, but not overwhelm them. Service was friendly and efficient; my water glass never dropped below half full which I loved. I tend to consume large amounts of water when eating, massive when eating after a night of serious drinking. Flo was a nice treat, I don't want it to be a few years before I make another visit.",0.9962,0.748,0.213,0.039,0.5641774891774893

(The Carnitas Tacos were just OK and the rice & beans they serve on the side of most entrees are a little bland.) Drinks are also great... the margaritas and other mixed drinks are usually pretty strong and they have a solid beer and wine selection. The wait staff is usually pretty friendly and attentive, but not overly so.  Having been there many times, we've encountered a few mood swinging servers, but that's to be expected once in a while, I suppose.

Why 5 stars?  It is a neighborhood gem, and a bustling place.  The staff is warm and friendly.  The manager is gracious and an excellent bartender.  The cocktails are strong.  The food is delicious.  It is a part of my daily life, and I just love, love, love Flo.  Goober says hey!",0.997,0.794,0.183,0.023,0.5355211769362712

Top-notch enchiladas - veggie or meat. Solid wine list. And the service is perfect, laid back but not stand-offish.  As this neighborhood gets more and more 'doushe-tashtic,' Flo stands apart.

I am a huge chorizo fan but if not prepared correctly, it can be either too greasy, fatty, or just not right but at Flo, it's to die for. They're mojito's are also really good & freshly made.

Cute little place with exposed brick walls and jazz playing in the background, and a brunch menu that is largely composed of hybrid Mexican-American fare at reasonable prices (most if not everything is less than $10) I had the smoked turkey hash which was ok, but not what I was expecting. I was expecting something resembling a corned beef hash except with shredded smoked turkey etc. instead of the corned beef. What I got was basically just chunks of smoked turkey sauteed with chopped zucchini, squash, onion, and jalapeno (barely noticeable). It's a nice combination, but nothing phenomenal. It came topped with two poached eggs, one which was done right, one which was overdone.  Bf got the carnitas hash. He really liked it, I wasn't as enthusiastic. Again, not bad, just not particularly special.

It was meh. The waiter had a little attitude - told us to hurry and order because the kitchen was switching over at 3. It was 2:15. But, he kept the refills coming, and was competent, if a bit stiff with us.  Anyway, the food is fine. The green and red salsas they bring to the table are good. Although the red is hotter than the green, which is new on me. I got chilaquiles w/ chorizo, and they were fine. Really messy. The pico was fine. The black beans were entirely unseasoned, but I fixed that. Again, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  Maybe I hadn't ordered the right things, but I actually thought it was all a bit bland. My meal was not greater than the sum of its parts. Each component was not seasoned. It was more like, let's make some eggs, put some sloppy-ass sauce all over it, and then cover it in cheese and tortilla chips. Not bad, just.....nothing special.  If I had waited in line for any period of time for this meal, I would have been PISSED. If you're going to wait in line, go to Lula, or Bongo Room, or Milk & Honey, or all the other places with absurd wait lines that are almost kind of worth the wait. This place ain't on that list.

Okay okay, I like a little spice... sometimes... but not too spicy-- I know what you're thinking, 'hey wait, aren't you Mexican?-- yes, yes I am except that I have all my taste buds, they still work, unlike my mom's who killed them all with her homemade super spicy 'cry at the table every night at dinner' sauce.  I like to enjoy my food, every flavor, every taste... so needless to say my stamina for spice is very low. I had a choice between the chicken chile verde and the calabasa quesadillas.  The chicken chile had a red flag from the start because of the word 'chile' so I opted for the quesadillas thinking I was safe... nope! They were hot! Real hot! I had about 3 bites and had to break for a few minutes to stop the burning sting in my mouth then go back to eating a few more bites and on and on.  So you can imagine how long it took me to eat my food.   The thing that saved me was their sangria! There was a choice between red wine sangria and white wine sangria... I ordered them mixed.  It was the best of both worlds as Miley Cyrus says... I thoroughly enjoyed my carafe of sangria.  My only complaint was that there was not enough fruit in it.  I like to munch on the fruit... I thought that was the whole point.   Back to the main course, so their calabasa quesadillas were spicy but still good.  If you like spicy go for it.  If not, skip it and order something else.  Their enchiladas were good as well and you get to pick what you want to put in them.  Also, they have 4 sauces on their menu ranging from mild to super hot.  Choose wisely. For dessert, I ordered the Portuguese orange cake... doesn't sound too tasty, does it?  But I thought I'd be adventurous.  It was so great.  The cake had a very light orange taste and the texture was like angel food cake.  They topped it with thick whip cream, yum, and garnished with blueberries and raspberries.  I stick by my choice.

FRESHY fried tortilla chips topped with FRESH black beans, FRESH corn, FRESH pico de gallo, and FRESH cheese.  The carnitas tacos: slow-roasted pork that is savory as hell, combined with FRESH, FRESH toppings and tortillas and served with FRESH salsa. The garlic spinach side tasted FRESH too. The Flo bowl: a FRESH-ass take on paella, smoky and savory. The mojito: the mint leaves almost TOO FRESH, so potent they were. The espresso flan: A surprisingly delicate espresso flavor in perfect balance with the custard and caramel. Topped with FRESH strawberries. I can't explain why everything tasted so FRESH to me. It felt almost cleansing to eat at Flo. It felt like plopping down in the middle of a garden and just pulling stuff out of the ground to eat it.

They must know that too, because they are generously quick with refills. Most brunch dishes range from 6.50-10. Tack on another $6.50 for one bloody mary and you're looking at a $35 bill (including tax & tip) for 2. Clearly, worth it at flo - when we walked in, the place was already packed.

Any component of breakfast can be incorporated into bruch, lunch, linner and dinner and there is never a problem. Take bacon for example. Bacon is a breakfast staple but also compliments any other meal, this can be said of toast, eggs and other items as well. That being said, I am very difficult to please when it comes to going to a restaurant for breakfast. It almost always is something I can whip up in my kitchen and I just dont see the value in it.  Flo is NOT one of the exceptions. OVER RATED. Why do trendy frou frou brunch spots get so much love on yelp? Can't you guys make eggs yourself? Nothing stands out. Suzy and I went here for V day brunch. She ordered the bfast burrito and essential it was equivalent in size and taste to 2 mcdonald bfast burritos. I went with the steak sammy and we shared a banana pancakes order. The accompanying home fries sucked. Very oily, with no real texture. Like a oily mush. The steak sammy was ok but it has been done with much more success at Kinzie Street Chop House or even Monk's. The only redemption was the the order of banana pancakes. This I could not make myself and actually enjoyed. Cozy Corner does it better though. Flo is over rated and people that come here are sold on the hype.

I wound up having the French toast (with almond butter and syrup) and the Eggs Flo (an Eggs Benedict with brioche toast and grilled smoked turkey instead). The French Toast was very good. I wasn't too keen on the Eggs Flo, because I'm not too big on the smoked turkey. For those who like smoked turkey, I would not hesitate to recommend Eggs Flo.  The building and decor is very charming. Dark wood and the original architecture looks like it's still intact. It doesn't have that modern, cold, froufrou feeling.

The blueberries just added a touch of sweetness and tartness at the same time. The pancakes also came with almond butter which was to die for! I've never had almond butter before and now I'm hooked.

Basically my rating comes from the food service, and overall appeal. I wasn't blown away, but then again, it didn't completely suck.  I will say the decor is amazing. Old brick of the building lines one wall, while the other is painted and plastered and adorned with random vintage mirrors. Artwork also lines the walls, which adds a nice touch. The original architecture of the building has been kept in tact almost...the tin roof is painted, and very detailed woodwork is near the entrance, although this is closed off by glass windows, as I am assuming it was once an old storefront of some sort. The lighting is quite soft, which would make this a nice dating or lounge spot. There is a small bar, and they provide a rather extensive drink list.  Everyone ordered enchiladas...which doesn't offer much variety in terms of what the menu is like. I will say that there are tacos and fajitas...there are also some non-Mexican dishes available, but be prepared to expect some Latin flair to almost everything. We ordered an appetizer of guacamole, which was quite good.  Onto the food! I had potato and cheese enchiladas with a garlic cream sauce. My sides were rice and corn salad. The corn salad was tasty, the rice could have used a little something. The enchiladas themselves smelled like conversation hearts for some reason, but wow...were they good! I ate practically everything, and as almost all of my friends know, I can hardly finish anything without asking for a container. One co-worker ordered the same but with a red chile sauce that she thankfully had on the side...one tiny taste of it made her cringe it was so hot. Everyone else seemed to enjoy what they had, so no complaints there.  The service was good, everyone was quite attentive to giving us more water, fresh silverware, and the like.  We did not get dessert...no one could eat another bite, although I hear their coconut cake is quite the yummy. I suppose I will have to make another trip here for that OR the brunch, which most people seem to be raving about.

Boyfriend got the smoked turkey hash with potato, onion, green pepper, squash and smokey chipotle crema, grilled and topped with two poached eggs, served with fresh fruit and wheat toast. Friend got brioche toast with grilled smoked turkey, and fresh spinach, topped w/ two poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and asiago cheese. I definitely was in love with the latte I ordered. Perfect amount of foam and soo tasty. And it felt great on my sore throat. I definitely do want to go back to Flo and try what Friend ordered.",0.9895,0.704,0.243,0.053,0.577810650887574

I admit I don't make it over this way very often.  Or ever, really.  Two busses (one of which, the 66, makes me homicidal) is pushing it for me.  But I'm SO glad Paige W and her friend suggested this for brunch this morning (er, afternoon...). I arrived first, and was told there was a 30-40 minute wait.  It worked out since some members of our party were running late, and the lovely hostess pointed me to the free coffee while I waited.  I'm not a coffee drinker, but I thought that was nice - a great way to warm up from the outside.  (**Note - the coffee is only free while you wait!  Once you're seated you'll be charged for any coffee consumption!)  They also had a little entryway with two adorable metal benches to wait on.  Super cute place all around, and very cozy. As the final member of our party arrived, I made eye contact with the hostess (who remained very aware of our group the entire time - which I loved), and she motioned for us to follow her.  We had a table in the very back corner of the restaurant, and while it was kind of loud back there I don't think any of us minded. We got started with drinks - I had the prosecco mimosa, Paige had something pink looking, and her friend ordered a bloody mary which she didn't love and switched out for Paige's pink drink.  I think we all agreed our drinks were very strongly poured, which is *never* a bad thing. Food - I ordered the french toast (of course), Paige had the chocolate chip and banana pancakes, and Paige's friend ordered something with eggs, potatoes, fruit, and holy cow it was a lot of food.  I think we were all incredibly happy with our food, though I admit that I wish my french toast had a little bit more flavor to it.  The almond butter helped, but it just seemed like it was missing something.  Still a solid dish, though. Service was great - our server and the busboys were on top of everything, despite how busy it was. By the time we finished eating there was no wait, so we didn't feel rushed to leave and open up the table.  We were able to relax a bit and just chat, which is a lovely way to spend a Saturday brunch.  While we relaxed one of us mentioned just staying all the way through for dinner...  and you know, it's not a bad idea.  The dinner menu intrigues me, and I think I will have to brave the #66 bus again sometime to try it out!",0.9977,0.736,0.211,0.053,0.5941830065359479

The breakfast burrito was a true disappointment.  My bf had the steak sub and I actually liked that one. It's not quite what you expect but it comes with this sauce that's really full of flavor and gives the sub a tex mex flare.  Their home fries disappointing and they skimp out on the portion. The only good thing about brunch today was the chocolate banana pancakes.  The key is that they cook the banana with the batter instead of just layering it on top.  Because the banana is cooked into the pancake, the heat makes the flavor pop out and you're left with this gooey delicious banana flavored pancake that is quite good.  Even my bf who normally hates anything sweet loved the pancake.

The fluffiest prettiest poached eggs laid on top of blocks of delicious, fluffy polenta, surrounded with sauteed veggies (squash, mushrooms, peppers), and a delicious green salsa-adobe-sauce thing. It was sooo interesting and everything was beautiful and well seasoned. It was totally not your typical eggs and pancakes and I think it was like $8 or something silly.

I'm a big fan of New Mexican-style breakfast and was tempted to get the Chilaquiles to see if they were still as good as I remembered. But the Breakfast Burrito was my old fave and did not dissapoint on this visit either! Each layer of egg, sour cream, jalapeno, pico de gallo and spinach tortilla added to the fresh whole. It was filling without seeming heavy. My dining partner opted for the Flo Style eggs and must've liked them, as she saved Flo's a dishwasher cycle by cleaning her plate completely!

The eggs were a perfect scramble, the multigrain toast was thick and hearty and the bacon was oh-so-scrumptious. The only teensy complaint? The home fries are just okay.

2008-08-27,3.0,"Once upon a time, back in the day of Tacopalooza Saturday nights, I would have given Flo at least 4 stars. And, just so you know, if I were solely rating brunch, Flo would almost definitely receive the full 5. However, based on my experience last night, Flo was just A-Ok. And that's okay, because in a few weeks or months, I will return to Flo on a Saturday or Sunday with many friends in tow, and sit at the big round table in the back and eat something scrumptious like polenta hash and sip a fantastic red chile bloody mary and simply update my Yelp review.  However, I digress. Let's focus on last night. I kind of feel bad, because my dinner companion had just eaten at Flo less than a week before, but, because he's a nice person and I hadn't eaten at Flo since Memorial Day weekend, we went. I wasn't overly blown away by the dinner options. They all sort of blended together in my head, although perhaps if I had ordered the gnocchi this would have been a different review. I ended up choosing the shrimp enchiladas with green chile salsa--I do appreciate the very New Mexican option of choosing your salsa--with sides of corn salad and cheddar jalapeno home fries.  The corn salad was excellent! The perfect blend of cilantro and other spices, nice pieces of tortilla mixed in, and a good ratio of creaminess to vinegar. The home fries sounded a lot better than they were. They were sort of average-diner quality. I don't understand why the jalapenos couldn't have been blended in a more subtle manner. The enchiladas themselves were pretty tasty, but the shrimp were chewey.  Overall, the service was very good. That is definitely an aspect of Flo that has improved over the years. My margaritas were pretty tasty, but the salt was so heavy-handed the first time that the second one I ordered salt free. The server was great about bringing me more coffee after the meal. And the price was very reasonable.  I will definitely return for brunch, about which I will then rave. And please, dear Flo, I know this is so old-school, but will you please bring back Taco-Palooza?",0.9975,0.79,0.199,0.01,0.4811533032185206

The hostess was very friendly and beyond cute.  The waiter was curiously uninvolved in our breakfast.  He took our orders and brought the check, but in between he never approached us, despite the fact that he spent most of our meal meandering around the front of the restaurant.  Sure, I could have flagged him easily if we needed something, but isn't checking on your customers a basic rule of waiting?

The service is different each time - sometimes they are very attentive and sometimes they are not. They are for the most part friendly.  They always have specials with entrees and drinks and it seems like they change the menu for the season (check out  eatatflo.com  for more info).

It was just about the perfect portion size and a good value for the price. It was a simple dish and executed well. The Mexican Corn Cakes were a special.

I am a sucker for this type of breakfast food (chorizo, especially).  Usually on a brunch menu I go straight for the Southwestern entrees.  And that's exactly what I did this time, and I was impressed.  I ordered the chorizo scramble with spicy home fries and black beans.  Holy crap.  I LOVE chorizo and black beans together, and this plate was delicious!  My friend's Lowrider frittata was pretty good, but I was all about my chorizo scramble this morning was raving about Flo for quite a while.",0.9949,0.669,0.275,0.056,0.6427536231884058
2007-07-08,5.0,"Before Friday night, I had only been to this place for yummy brunch (I heart the chiliquilies).  After having delicious Mas Margs at Mas we passed up the sea of new outdoor dining establishments on Division and headed to our fav brunch place to check out their dinner.  We were not disappointed.  We both started with a fabulous mixed greens salad (only 2.95 by the way) and I had the Mahi Mahi with a warm corn salad.  My hub had the porkchops.  Both entrees were delish.  I usually have food envy like I did again this night because I thought the pork was a little tastier than the fish, but then again, I think I just like pork better.  The warm corn salad was awesome and pretty much the only reason I ordered the Mahi Mahi; although the fish was pretty good.   We usually don't pass up dessert so we split the hot fudge sundae.  The fudge was amazing...I don't know if they make it in-house or what but I could've been sitting outside at The Grand Hotel listening to the clop clop of horses go by and enjoying my Mackinac Island Fudge sundae, it was that good! Also, this is a pretty baby friendly restaurant.  We took our son their twice before he was 6 months old and enjoyed brunch.  Just get their right when they open on the weekends and they will sit you in the larger room in the back where you can do the turnover highchair trick and set the carseat  ( with hopefully sleeping baby) on it.  There was also a baby their when we were having dinner and it seemed to be working for the mom and dad.   One last thing, our dinner which included to drinks, two dinner salads, two entrees and one dessert was just $45!  Can't beat that!  Now if I only didn't have to pay the babysitter with my right arm, we'd be set. ****5 Strollers****if you get their early for brunch (or a night that is not crowded) and get seated in the back room!",0.997,0.8,0.192,0.008,0.5916929916929916

As we looked at the menus it was so tough for us to pick & choose what we wanted to eat. I decided on the Flo Frittata. It was divine. Filled with red onions, red potatoes, spinach, egg & salsa verde. Served with a side of pico de gallo & black beans. Mike got a very large helping of the chiliquiles. One dish we both decided on, that was just lovely. The chips were a bit too big. They should cut them up a little more.  Coffee was fresh, and hot. The service was nice. I love this place.

Flo made me happy:  it's solid mexican breakfast food (haven't been there for dinner, yet) served with a smile and a really good strong cup of coffee.  i had the chorizo chilaquiles and it reminded me of what i ate living in los angeles (bar none, some of the best mexican food lives there - okay, maybe texas).  folks expecting something resembling 'high cuisine' from chilaquiles need to chill a little bit - it's comfort food traditionally made out of leftovers and the Flo chorizo chilaquiles had flavor, asiago cheese and the requisite soft/crunchy tortilla texture.  my only wish was one more tortilla on the plate to eat with.  (my proof that this was good solid mexican food?  there was a latino family sitting next to us and, from what i could overhear/translate, the mom liked it.  if it's good enough for moms, it's good enough for me!) the portions are hearty (and i'm a hearty kinda girl) and, according to my friend, the smoked hash was excellent.  (she even ate the zuchinni and she hates the stuff!)  the service was fast, polite and even friendly. our wait for seating was 15-20 minutes and once the high brunch hour was past, the flow (heh) inside the restaurant was pretty fast.  i agree with an earlier yelper - get there super early or after 1 pm on weekends if you want to avoid waiting.  i'll try to get here on a weekday to have a more relaxed meal. go to Flo and don't be ashamed if you have to unsnap your pants a little when you're walking out.  oof.",0.9956,0.773,0.211,0.016,0.4868468468468469

They most certainly charged us for the imbibed caffeine. The cream dispenser is on the fritz as well. In their defense it was reviewers who mentioned the free coffee, not the restaurant. They do have free dog treats for all you Paris/Nicole Richie wannabes who inappropriately tote your doggies into dining establishments (yes, you are wearing over-sized sunglasses, but you are most definitely not blind). There were some high and low points to the food. I was excited for the chilaquiles, but they were just nachos on a plate and would get their ass kicked by the chilaquiles at Cafe Selmarie. The breakfast burrito was the best I've encountered with a good combination of eggs, bacon, veggies and a wonderfully toasty tortilla. The bacon is the key. The chocolate chip banana pancakes were solid. I can't wait to go back to try the 3 berry french toast or eggs Flo. Or just eat the burrito again.
