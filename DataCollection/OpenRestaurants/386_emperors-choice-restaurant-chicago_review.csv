Try the Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce. Ask them to make it spicy if you like a little more heat. Try the fried tofu or string beans as an appetizer. They're both delish! The mixed mushroom and tofu is really yummy, sauce is awesome and the variety of mushrooms will satisfy you when you need a ""meaty"" texture. Service is attentive, the dining room is quite lovely with ancient artwork all around and they have a full bar. I love this place!",0.9852,0.76,0.24,0.0,0.47031249999999997
2017-08-13,5.0,"We have tried no less than 5 restaurants at the ""newer"" Chinatown ""mall"" but were disappointed time after time... from flavorless food to horrible service;  always something but NEVER great dishes. So today we ventured across the street to the original strip and went into 3 places but none seemed to be using a wok. Noodle joints,  bbq 'advertised' joint, and then took the yelp 4 star recommended EMPEROR's CHOICE RESTAURANT for our newest dining experience. Glad we did,  FANTASTIC FRIENDLY SERVICE (we left a BIG tip for that pleasure) plus the BEST food yet in CHINATOWN! We had 2 dishes; Triple delight with broad noodle (N4, DRY CANTONESE CHOW FUN) fresh from the wok was great! Tender beef, perfect shrimp, and large pieces of chicken.  PORK Egg Foo Young equally as good with tender chunks of pork and thickened beef gravy!   The EFY was NOT OILY either.   We WILL be back... no upcharge for crispy noodle, tea, OR rice. You are now our new 'go to' place in CHINATOWN!   ATTENTION TOURISTS & RESIDENTS:  From downtown we always take the water taxi (senior discount daily pass only $6) and the ride home AT DUSK is spectacular!

2017-08-11,5.0,"YES best chinese take out in chicago at a fairly reasonable price! I'm so happy I found this place because honestly I was so disappointed with the chinese food in this city!  I always always get the beef and broccoli here- the meat is SO TENDER. I've gotten this dish at other take out places like (cough yu choy and chi cafe) and it was so tough and the sauce was weirdly sour!! definitely definitely get this dish here. the sauce here is so good- probably the best beef and broccoli sauce I've had- not too salty but not too bland, not too thick but not too watery- just REALLY good.  The shrimp ho fun here is my other go to! LOTS of veggies and noodles and shrimp! sometimes I find that restaurants skimp on the shrimp so I have a habit of picking at the veggies and noodles and saving the shrimp- however, the dish from here had SO MANY SHRIMPIES I was so happy and was able to have a shrimp piece for almost every bite of noodle.  The general tso's chicken here is also really really good- nice thick batter coating a juicy chicken piece. DELICIOUS sweet/sour/spicy sauce coating the crunchy batter exterior of the chicken YUM YUM YUM. I would say this place has a better general tso chicken than lao sze chuan (and I think it's also slightly cheaper! win win)  The chicken lo mein was also very good and they are very very generous with the chicken pieces! I almost wanted more veggies in it because there were SO MANY chicken pieces (which i think is always a good thing) and again, the chicken was very tender and not tough (which can be an issue sometimes with this dish)  Overall, very very yummy place. I hope more people discover this place and give them more reviews and business because they deserve it!!!  (also, along with fortune cookies they give you these sweet biscuits- if you've been to ming hin, it's essentially the same biscuits they give out there- which are also a delicious treat to end your meal with!)",0.9985,0.741,0.24,0.019,0.5810493827160492

The crab rangoons were delicious (that's why it is 2 stars). The Mongolian beef lacked flavor, it was more flavorless than bad beef and broccoli from a mall.

They did use good chicken and ingredients as far as I could tell, but the flavor and sauce were both lacking, and the chicken wouldn't have really stuck to the rice.  Delivery took 70 minutes.

2016-06-27,2.0,"This is the worst Chinese food I have ever in my life tasted. My boyfriend and I ordered the fried shrimp appetizer, veggie dumplings, sweet and sour chicken, and general tso chicken. The fried shrimp was soaked in complete oil. Although the batter tasted good it was only because of how much oil was left inside of it. I can literally taste the grease all around my lips after each bite. I was extremely disappointed with their veggie dumplings. They were completely dried out and just stuck to each other and on the cabbage. As I tried to take a piece, it kept on falling apart. Both of the chicken dishes were extremely disappointing. The chicken tasted completely dried out and had a taste as if it had been reheated. I'm not sure if we came on a day where the chef was lazy but I would never return to this place. It was just a total fail and I wish I could have had a good food experience in China town but that wasn't the case. Either these reviewers don't know what good Chinese food is or we just came on a wrong day. I feel bad for giving this place one star because the service was good and our server was really nice so I had to add an extra star. As far as the food goes I would rate it one star.

Taking a cab to a restaurant can get pricy . Restaurants at the hotel nothing to brag about.  Thanks to an Yelp app called eat24 I found a great Chinese restaurant that delivers to the hotel room.   Emperor's Choice was the excellent choice.  Food was delivered on time , was hot , fresh and tasted yummy. Worth every dollar spent. Portions were big. Spicy as needed to be. Delivery charge $3 only. That is a great deal.

After being in Chinatown in NYC, Philadelphia and San Francisco, Chicago's is much smaller. But they do have a wide variety of restaurants for all tastes. Originally, we chose another restaurant by looking at reviews on Yelp. But, we arrived a little early and while browsing through shops, I asked the clerk ""where the locals go."" She said Emperor's Choice (right across the street from this shop) was the place to go. Emperor's Choice is not a large restaurant, and it was early when we arrived so there were seats available. Over the course of the couple of hours we were there, it filled up. We ordered a variety of items - soup, noodle, shrimp and beef dishes. The food was hot when served and it was excellent. For a Chinese restaurant recommended by a local person, I was surprised that the menu was a pretty traditional Americanized version of Chinese food. They had a few traditional offerings, but it was not what I expected it to be. However, as I said, what we ate was very good. I need to say something about their service. I unfortunately did not get the waitresses name but she was outstanding.

The soup wasn't spicy (maybe I should have asked them to kick it up a little), but it was full of amazing fresh veggies.  The Rangoons were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy, but had very little crab in them (mostly cream cheese).  The Shanghai Rice Noodles was amazing.  The portion was huge, the meat was cooked perfectly (large shrimp and pork servings), the veggies were crips/fresh.  The saffron flavoring just popped in this dish and I highly recommend it to anyone.  The Crispy Tofu had a great salt/pepper flavoring with the addition of jalapeño added for a mild spice kick.   The restaurant is very clean with white linen tables.  The bathrooms are well cared for.  The wait staff is extremely professional.   Overall, a great restaurant for a family, couples, business meetings, or just a solo patron looking for a great meal at an affordable price (extremely cheap for the Chicago area).",0.9972,0.703,0.297,0.0,0.5591428571428572

2015-05-03,5.0,"Disclaimer: I only got 3 appetizer dishes here and not any of the entrees.  I ordered take out from here on a whim, and it was definitely worth it! Here's why -  Crab Rangoon - The best I've had in Chicago so far. For starter, you get 6 pieces, which totally beats the 4 that you'd get at some other places for the same price. They're actually crispy and not soggy (mind you, I ordered them to take out and had a 30 min trip back to my place). There's also this garlic-y taste to them that I thought was great.  Emperor's Egg Rolls - This was also fried perfectly. I'm not completely sure what is inside them. I'm guessing it was something along the lines of cabbage, a little sliced scallion, some tiny shrimp, and maybe a few other basic ingredients.  Bar-B-que Pork - I know people have been saying this place is highly Americanized, and I'm not going to argue over that, but these pieces of sliced bbq pork were made just like how I'd get them at legit Chinese food places in NY. The slices have just the right amount of meat and fat and they're not dry at all!  The only thing that annoyed me was that they didn't give me any type of duck sauce or anything along those lines for the egg roll or crab rangoon, but I guess I'd also have to blame myself for not asking.

I don't know if they've recently updated their decor, as this was my first time dining here, but they did a great job. Tables are pristine, bathrooms spic and span, and the bar when you walk in didn't have a crumb on it. Definitely a welcoming place!  Food was good! We tried the hot and sour soup, which was among the best I've ever had. For entrees, we ate the Hunan Beef, which features some of the freshest veggies I've ever tasted. The fresh bamboo was my favorite, as I had only had this in chute form, previously. Beef was extremely lean, which is always great. The seafood dish was not as good, but still tasty. It had shrimp, squid, scallops, jalapeno peppers, and snow peas. Scallops are my favorite, and I wish there were more than three or four of them in the dish. Server was routinely checking up on us, but not in an overbearing, creepy way like some servers in Chinatown.

The food- We ordered three things - Hunan Shrimp, Chicken Noodles and Double cooked Pork. The shrimp and pork were ordered extra spicy. The quantity was more like for 3 people and we were just two and still managed to finish 90% of the food. It was amazing. The dry noodles can be ordered either thin or fat. The waitrees suggested thin so thin it was. It is easily the best noodles I have eaten and I have eaten them in Asia too. The noodles were cooked perfectly. Actually I could eat them with some chilli sauce and nothing else. The chicken in the noodles was very very tasty. It was a masterpiece. The Pork was the other great dish and I am glad my wife ordered the double cooked pork extra spicy. It just great. If you like pork you will like this. It was spicy, pork were chewy and juicy and the sauces were perfect. The hunan shrimp was not great and and if I had ordered the shrimp and noodles, wud have given 3-4 stars.

It's a cool and rainy Saturday, so Lincoln Park zoo is a NO from our guest of honor.  We have called our oldest daughter and have told her to meet us by the Fire Station in Chinatown.  After everyone arrives we do some typical tourist sight seeing.  We always stop in the Hoypoloi, it's an uncommon gallery you know.  Then we say let's pick a place to eat.  It's Maria's call and she is trying to remember the place we ate at in the past that had really good Won Ton soup.  We finally remember and find it, the Emperor's Choice. Maria and I start by ordering a bowl each of the Won Ton soup.  Afterward Maria and I both say the same thing, it was good but not like the last time we had it.  It was a bit on the watery side but at least the dumplings were hot and tasty.  We also started with the Emperor's Egg Rolls and the Pot Stickers.  I am usually the only one who just loves Egg Rolls but even Maria thought they were truly outstanding this time.  The Pot Stickers were also good, not outstanding, but good. For our main course items we ordered the Mongolian Beef (which was just average), the Beef with Broccoli (which had some of the best tasting beef I have had in a while.  It seemed like they used a better cut of meat which was real GOOD), the Pork Fried Rice (just average, a little burnt tasting), the Emperor's Shredded Chicken (which we all agreed was truly BAD I'm sorry to say Emperors.  It was the only left over dish we refused to take home with us.  The chicken or the sauce, something just truly tasted off.  No one got sick but we thought it was really bad) and finally the Shrimp with Cashews (which had bland tasting shrimp, even though they were huge pieces of shrimp and bland tasting cashews). So in general we received fast and friendly service.  The food was average this time around.  The price with all the food, drinks and tip was roughly $110 dollars.  And the most important part, did Maria enjoy her Mother's Day 2011 meal, she said, ""Yes, I liked it.""",0.996,0.756,0.179,0.065,0.6170561434450321

2010-09-27,4.0,"Chicago's Chinatown is one of the best culinary assets of our city. If you have never been, please do so even if just to walk the streets. I've enjoyed regular family dinners in Chinatown ever since I can remember. There are two places we always visited, Emperor's Choice and The Phoenix. Since it had been an unusually long time between Chinatown visits, we made Emperor's Choice the destination for dinner with Erica and her her mother Jean. I could end the review now and simply say if you want great Chinese food go to Chinatown and enjoy. We all have our favorite spots and our favorite dishes, but now you can see mine. Ask my friends and you'll hear that each meal with me must start with pot-stickers, the doughy dumpling filled with pork (or chicken or veggies depending on location). I have always loved the pot-stickers at EC, and especially love the dipping sauce. I prefer mine steamed, some choose pan fried. Since there were only three of us, we limited our ordering to three dishes (with healthy leftovers). My family Chinese dinners normally involved a serious dose of over-ordering because we love our Chinese food. The staples at EC are schezwan string beans and kung pao chicken, and then any other dishes that spark interest. That night we ordered a tasty and healthy scallop and vegetable dish. The string beans are one of my all time favorites, especially from EC. They were on the spicy side this time, unfortunate for Erica, but I loved them. Kung Pao Chicken is also a go-to, and they did not disappoint with little pieces of chicken in a moderately spicy peanut kung pao sauce. There are lots of vegetables too. Our scallop dish was the nice complement to all the other flavors. It was a flavorful but subtle garlic sauce, scallops and steamed veggies. Everything was great, especially the next day at home. If you want delicious and authentic (Americanized) Chinese food, head to Chinatown and look up Emperor's Choice.

That being said, the few dishes we got were not bad at all.  Service was also good.  And the ambiance of the place is probably one of the nicest in Chinatown.  If you are looking to explore Chinatown, this place is a good start - watered-down but still authentic and nice.  If you are Chinese, stick to the Chef's Special Menu then you'd have yourself an authentic Canto fare.",0.9599,0.852,0.131,0.017,0.4947965724751438

I'm convinced the same thing happened here, except the mob guys were giant alien asparagus. Because that is the only way I can explain to myself how they managed to put such GIGANTIC chunks of asparagus in this dish! (Perfectly cooked mind you).

We ordered the prawn and clam bake, first time trying this, and I can't say I was thrilled with it. It was unique, but good, I don't think I would order it again though. The crab rangoon, on the other hand was really good. One of the better rangoon I've tasted. As entrees we ordered the Mongolian beef, which was laden with mushrooms , peppers, and bean sprouts,and which in my opinion have absolutely no place in a proper Mongolian beef. I would have to rate this dish a pretty good at best, even factoring out all the undesirable veggies in this dish. The beef fried rice was pretty good as well, being dragged down by too many bean sprouts. This is a sure fire way to get me to rate your fried rice from pretty good down to alright or even bad. The mushu pork wasn't like any other I've had, and not in a good way. My brother nailed it on the head when he said it was like a deconstructed egg foo young patty. I was not a fan of this dish and would call it alright. The shrimp and lobster sauce was probably the best dish we had, and that was still just good.

We ended up at the Emperor's Choice, mostly because of its prime location on Wentworth Avenue in the heart of Chinatown, and possibly because of the City's Best and Zagat-rated stickers displayed on its door.  Regardless of the stickers, Emperor's Choice served plenty of high quality, moderately priced Chinese dishes in a casual yet cultural setting. A sampling of the menu included fried postickers (heaven), wonton soup (just okay), egg rolls (tasty and huge), kung pao chicken (spicy and, by far, my favorite!), sweet and sour pork (sweet and tangy with bell peppers and pineapple), Cantonese noodles (a little plain, but good for someone who doesn't want anything brimming with flavor), Mongolian beef (meaty and rich with great noodles and taste), and the Emperor's fried rice (shrimp AND chicken - definitely a dish worthy of the emperor).  There were lots of other dishes on the menu that looked equally mouth-watering. The service was exactly what you would expect at a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown - fast, friendly enough, accommodating and prompt.  You could tell that they were used to handling crowds.  The restaurant does have a full bar in case anyone is craving an adult beverage to accompany the delicious food.  To top it all off, the check is delivered with those great almond cookies that only the finest Chinese restaurants possess.  Definitely worth stopping in - parade or no parade.",0.9914,0.802,0.15,0.048,0.5018316765538988

I was impressed with the friendliness and speed of the service. The waitress asked my girlfriends and I if we wanted seperate checks. This impressed me since most places roll their eyes when you ask for seperate checks but this woman offered! And, she didnt get our orders wrong on the checks! I had the shanghai noodles - mmm hot stuff! We all shared the shrimp fried rice, egg rolls, and crab rangoon. Yes, were hungry ladies. Everything was delicious, hot, fresh and served with a smile.",0.994,0.717,0.262,0.022,0.6098883572567783
2009-01-07,2.0,"I went to this place on my last trip to chicago after reading the reviews and getting a recommendation from someone. It is in chinatown so I thought it would be at least decent. When we walked in, i noticed that other than the waiters, there wasnt a single asian person there. Bad sign in chinatown. The good thing about the food was that it wasnt too expensive and it didnt make any of us throw up. The downside was that it was extremely bland, and even things that were supposed to be spicy were almost flavorless. This is chinese food for people who usually eat at Dennys, if you want authentic chinese, go elsewhere. If this place was the choice of the emperor, it was not the emperor of an asian country.",-0.3182,0.927,0.031,0.041,0.36817460317460315
2008-09-16,4.0,"I have brought family, friends, and visitors to this restaurant & no one leaves disappointed. It's cheap, delicious, and greasy-just how I like it, just like my men. Kiddddding! Emperor's Choice is the only restaurant I've been to in Chinatown since I moved to Chicago four years ago. Yes, it may be due to my laziness but also it's because they have the best chicken fried rice I have ever tasted. The fried rice has so much flavor & it's not that burnt flavor that I've experienced at most Chinese restaurants in the city. My mom loves the Egg Fo-Young & claims it's the best she's had.  The food is delicious & I've never been disappointed. Why not five stars? The waitstaff isn't the best, somewhat rushes you (if you look like a youngin'-like me), and I have been asked to leave while still sipping the tea I paid for so others can sit down. I think that behavior is extremely rude & it really upsets me, but I can't seem to tear myself completely from Emperor's Choice.",0.9789,0.717,0.199,0.084,0.5533625730994153
2008-04-15,4.0,"We are usually usure of which places to go to in Chinatown. Normally, we go to the bigger places- places EVERYONE hears about. This time, however, we decided to try something different and walked in to Emperor's Choice with no prejudices/expectations and were very happy with the choice. Our server was probably one of the nicest people in the business and even recomended a great dish. Our total bill was $34- this included several pots of hot tea, two soups, two egg rolls, and two entrees. Great prices. We will definately go back!!",0.9411,0.827,0.152,0.021,0.5545454545454546

2008-03-30,3.0,"I guess I really don't go to Chinatown as frequently as I thought, because the restaurant that I've always visited (to be honest, it was the first place I went and I never felt like I needed to try anywhere new) was closed, and the people in a nearby store said that it had been closed for a while. Really sad. So I was hungry and felt that if emperors would choose a place, it's good enough for a pleb like me. It was okay. I think I've heard people talk about Emperor's Choice as being awesome, and they have good reviews in the window, but I didn't think it was that great. My food was alright while I ate it, but as I was walking with my leftovers later, I couldn't stop wondering who was farting, if it was that old woman next to me who smelled so bad, and, later, if I was somehow shooting off silent-but-deadlies so silent I didn't even know. Then I realized it was my food. It seriously smelled really bad. I don't know. Yuck. My companion also felt that her food was less than awesome, and said that the meat was overcooked and too tender. I don't think that that's really a problem, but I guess for her it was. Different tastes. Anyway, I wouldn't discourage anyone from going there, and I think a lot of other people like it (we were there at a very non-peak meal time and the dining room was probably around half-capacity), but I think that next time I head to Chinatown I'll go somewhere else.",0.1767,0.799,0.105,0.096,0.4199843260188087
2008-03-09,4.0,"In the mood for a spicy, inexpensive seafood extravaganza?  Look no further, Emperor's Choice is the spot. This place has been here FOREVER.  It's where I take my family when my dad comes to visit, we all want seafood, and don't feel like braving the ever extending lines at the Half Shell.  Prices have increased over the years, but it's still a pretty cheap date and you can walk in with a group of 10 and be seated fairly quickly.  I'm especially fond of the Hot and Sour and Corn soups, the spicy green beans with pork, the Salt and Pepper Seafood, the Peking Crab, the shrimp and crab dumplings, the shrimp stuffed tofu, and the shrimp in the Chef's sauce.  We always go with a group and share everything around the table as the menu is pretty extensive so it can be hard to choose.  Servings are large, so you don't even really need to order appetizers unless you want to bring home leftovers. They also mix a pretty mean cocktail. Not a place I'd go for general Chinese, but a great choice for seafood.  Friendly staff, inexpensive, a really good place for a long, relaxed dinner with a group.",0.9909,0.781,0.191,0.028,0.5503684807256236

2008-01-12,4.0,"Not only is this Emperor's Choice, it's Tom's Choice! To be honest, I'm generally wary of Chinese food.  Chinese take-out often suffers from being overly-fried, greasier than a Crisco factory, and as a result, causes me substantial gastrointestinal distress.  No wonder, a small shiver when up my spine when my co-worker chose to make Emperor's Choice the venue for a work dinner. Boy, was I surprised.  The food, particularly the seafood, was fantastic.  We dined on a life-changing whole Dungeness crab, dusted in salt and pepper, flash-fried, and brought to the table steaming hot.  The lobster was fresh, tender, and perfectly seasoned.  The non-seafood options were great as well, from the beef and broccoli (not greasy!) to the awe-inspiring wonton soup. The mai tais (yes, apparently, they are known for their mai tais) were delicious and potent.   And the service was wonderful.  Our waiter, an elderly Chinese gentleman, was friendly, hilarious, and attentive. The only negative that I can attribute to this fine restaurant is the atmosphere/decor.  It harkens back to the late 70s.  But you'll be so busy enjoying your dinner that you won't even notice.",0.9826,0.746,0.197,0.057,0.5744444444444446
