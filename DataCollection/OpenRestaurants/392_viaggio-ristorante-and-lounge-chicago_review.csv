The food is always spot on and whether you are there pre or post a United Center event, with a big group or small, you always will have a great time at Viaggio.   On my most recent visit- they had a lobster ravioli which was terrific served with peas and shrimp as a special!  It rivaled my fav rigatoni and pork which is what I usually have there.  And the slice of key lime pie that ended my meal couldn't have been tastier.  Serve that all up with some great wine, limoncello and complimentary bread and cheese and it was a wonderful evening of food and drink. Thanks to Dave and the team for making my friends and me feel special on each and every visit.  It is much appreciated!",0.9952,0.747,0.249,0.005,0.4448979591836734

Through busy traffic, we arrived late to our reservation, but they were accommodating and nice enough to save it for us. Not to common of a big city restaurant to hold a reservation for more than a few minutes. The moment we sat down, we were greeted by our waiter with waters, bread, and spicy peppers. For an appetizer, we ordered the 'stacked eggplant', and oh my god was is the way to go. The eggplant was just so delicately fried or baked, I couldn't even tell, it was so lightly breaded and perfect. Accompanied by a juicy tomato, fresh mozzarella, arugula, and topped with a tangy balsamic vinegar. I was super impressed. For my entree, I ordered Rigatoni Vodka, with shrimp. The sauce was so fresh and delicious and not too large of a portion either which I liked. Most restaurants over compensate with too much mediocre food by making the portions very large, but this restaurant high quality food, with fresh ingredients. Not only did we have a terrific meal, the service here was impeccable. They were speedy, friendly, and attentive to our orders and checking up on us, I don't think any of us had an empty glass throughout our dining experience.

2016-10-28,4.0,"Its 11:15 PM and I just finished my dinner that I received at 11PM for an order that was placed at 7:30PM. Now, you'd expect me to give anything but a 1 star for such a scenario, but here I am writing an honest heartfelt review at almost midnight.  Long story short - Good food and great customer service! I am a happy customer. Heres the full story - we ordered two dishes online through postmates and received our order in and hour and half. When we received the delivery - one penne pasta arabiatta and one spagetti and meatballs - , I noticed our order was incomplete (missing meatballs from our Pasta with meatballs). I was disappointed but decided to eat whatever was delivered. But as soon as i took the first bite of penne i noticed shards of paper in my dish. Now this was unacceptable to me. So I called the restaurant right away. Told them my side of the story. Dave, the GM at the restaurant was put on line and he was happy to assist (as expected). He told me that  he will refund the order but since I used postmates for delivery I would need to contact them to fix this at their end for me to receive the refund (somewhat expected and acceptable).  Then he added that he would be happy to resend the order if I could have postmates pick up. I did. So far this was all as expected (3 star- call me tough cookie, if you want). What made the real difference is the fact that when I was done getting things fixed by postmates it was already 10:25 PM. At this time I knew the restaurant was about to be closed. I still took a chance and placed the order. To my surprise, not only the order go accepted it was delivered in 30 mins, with a surprise complimentary dessert for two. Though I dont eat desserts at this time, it was a pleasant surprise.",0.9938,0.816,0.156,0.028,0.5902116402116403

Our water was constantly refilled. So why only 3 stars?  Well, this wonderful meal was finished in record time. We arrived around 6:10 pm, and we left by 7:04 pm. We ordered drinks, one appetizer, four entrees, and dessert. That's three courses all served within one hour. Before we even settled in, our server asked what we wanted to drink. We quickly ordered, and our food came just as quick. The second we slowed down on our entrees, our server instantly showed up to ask us if we wanted the leftovers packed away. We figured we can just get some dessert and just chat over that. But dessert was just as rushed. We haven't gotten together for many years, and we were really looking forward to catching up. So, it was a complete let down. Honestly, the food was good, and our server was nice, but the whole experience was a disappointment.

Great owners, great food, great staff. I even like the size of the drinks. I like the wine selection. The steaks are excellent. The hand-made ""Eight Finger Cavatelli"" is also excellent as is their signature meatball salad. That particular combination is easily enough for two and they'll split entrees upon request (added fee). They're one of the few places that doesn't overuse garlic! Even the peppers they serve as an appetizer aren't offensively over-seasoned and are very good. It's comfortable in any season but in good weather they open up the street doors, which pleases my wife because she likes the open air and makes me happy because I don't have to sit on the street (which is also available). They're usually very busy but I've never felt rushed or pushed to leave. My wife loves the risotto - not my thing. We both enjoy the tiramisu as well.

But, alas, I'm left with the feeling that folks in the West Loop must not realize that Little Italy is but a stone's throw away. Much better food can be enjoyed over on Taylor Street in any number of restaurants.  Ambiance - upscale and loud, with lots of hard surfaces which do not soak up sound at all. Food - meh, except for the excellent shrimp appetizer. The veal parmesan was a gloppy mess. The lasagna was relatively tasteless and had a very odd, homogeneous texture. The bolognese gravy was subpar. Service - barely fair. Our waiter seemed only tangentially interested in anything having to do with his job. The rest of the staff was friendly and more or less attentive. We felt rushed as the entrees were served when we were halfway through with the appetizer. My spouse was not happy with the dessert but the waiter never checked back with us and merely dumped the check on the table without a backward glance.

2016-01-04,5.0,It's not often that I am immediately impressed the minute I walked in the door but Viaggio was truly one of those moments. We were greeted warmly the second we walked in. This was appropriate since we had just been standing around in some freezing ass weather. Our group was pretty disgruntled after the West End sports bar next door treated us like crap. We only had time for some quick snacks and drinks before the Bulls game since we wasted a good 30 minutes next door.   We were served immediately after discussing our ordeal and they even apologized in their neighbors behalf which was unnecessary at this point. We got our drinks promptly and they even tried to find a game for us to watch while we sat at the bar. I mentioned we'd love to try their meatballs but not sure if we had time and before we could even turn back to the bar the meatballs were brought out to us.  They were some of the best meatballs we had all had so the 8 of us proceeded to order another round of drinks and balls.  I really hope I get to come back to Chicago soon to and really sit down and hang out with my new friends at Viaggio for a full dinner.

There was a bread bowl with olive oil and herbs for us to munch before ordering the appetizer: the meatball salad. Okay. Seriously? That meatball was the best ball I've ever had in my mouth. Like, extremely moist, melted in my mouth, seasoned to perfection, actually somewhat of a kick. Perfection. I would never have imagined pairing meatballs with tomato gravy with greens. But it worked. Seriously, it is worth the price.  I ordered the pork chop Parmesan. This dish was pricy but for good reason. I had no idea it was going to be as massive as it was. I mean it was actually bigger than the plate. The pork was juicy, tender, seasoned perfectly, smothered with fresh mozz and tomato gravy. It was served with creamy tortellini.

We had the meatball salad and the lasagna. Perhaps Yelp made our expectations too high, but those two dishes were nothing to write home about (and were quite expensive). We also did not like the atmosphere; it was quite loud and cramped; I suppose some people like this style of dining room, but I prefer something quieter and fancier along the lines of Vivo.

All of our pasta was incredible and the service was impeccable. Everyone, from the owner, who personally stopped by our table to check on us, to our server treated us like family and welcomed guests. Top things from this visit that were awesome besides the food: 1) Rather than pay $30-40 to park at the United Center, they have $12 valet parking at Viaggio. You can leave your car there through the whole game and take the free shuttle bus that they share with West End Grill over to the game. What an awesome deal. Tip the valets well. They work hard! 2) We had leftovers we wanted to keep but we were heading to the game. Our waiter offered to put them in the fridge for us at the restaurant for us to pick up after the game.

2015-06-19,1.0,"Had dinner at Viaggio's last night and walked away totally disappointed. The restaurant  squeezes a lot of tables into a small space,  so its very noisy and hard to carry on a conversation with your dinner companions.    My friend and I were seated at a table for two --  the table itself  was so small that the dinner plates,  silverware and glasses were in constant peril of being knocked off the table by passing wait staff or by simple movements like putting a glass on and off the table.    The mixed green salad as a first course was okay,  but nothing special. The veal entree was a major disappointment given the price.   The entree was so heavily sauced that it looked like a jar of  marinara sauce had been dumped on the dinner plate.   As a result,  the veal and vegetables that were buried under the sauce had absolutely no flavor.    Plus,  the veal was overcooked and on the tough side.   I've had similar veal entrees at other Italian restaurants (and I'm not talking Olive Garden) that were flavorful and melt in your mouth tender.  I ended up not eating most of the entree,  instead filling up on the bread that comes with the dinner.    If you're going to an event at the United Center I suppose this would be an okay option if you don't want to eat from the UC concessions stands.    But I don't think the quality of the entrees matches up with the prices charged.     Perhaps a good place for drinks and appetizers if the restaurant is busy????",-0.7861,0.834,0.067,0.099,0.4235347985347986

We came in Saturday night without a reservation and we were seated right away - awesome. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara, and I thought it was rich and fatteningly delicious. Our server was bubbly and timely with everything. Overall - great experience.  Last weekend we went on Saturday night...called ahead to get a table in 15 min...no problem. Our server must have been stretched thin, because we barely saw him. I ordered the lasagna this time, and it was served lukewarm, and the sauce was actually cool to the touch. I should have said something but I didn't - that's on me. The tiramisu was delish. The calamari app was a little strange...its ""fried"" - but not how I imagine a fried texture to be. It is served tossed in a tomato sauce. I think that whatever crunchiness that the fried calamari once had was completely obliterated by the sauce. It felt slimy/mealy and was a turn off. My boyfriend has the appetite of a stray dog so he finished the calamari even though he wasn't a fan. Also, we LOVE that they serve roasted sweet peppers with the bread. Nice touch & delicious.

2015-02-26,4.0,"Never in my life did I think that a meatball salad would change my life, let alone be something that even sounded remotely good. But holy.crap. I was wrong.  My first night in Chicago and my savvy colleague set up a late dinner for a small group of us at Viaggio. When we walked in I noticed this place looked like it had been there for a while, or at least had a history in the area. I really have no idea if that's true or not, but when it comes to Italian eats, the older the decor, the more homey and authentic it feels.  My colleague insisted we try the meatball salad, so I elected him to pick the apps for the whole table. He did damn well. But the big stand out was definitely this unique dish. Sure, warm meatballs on cold, crisp lettuce sounds like it could be disastrous, but Viaggio makes it work so hard. It was like a lightly dressed, Italian side salad with homemade meatballs on top. They cut them up at the table and then serve the guests. Please, just try it.  I saw they had homemade gnocchi on the menu, so I opted for a heaping dish of that with their vodka sauce. Good. God. I've never had such a filling pasta before! I could barely make it through 1/4 of this rich dish of epic deliciousness.  Another stellar part of this meal was the service. Our waiter was on it. He knew the specials by heart and described them perfectly. He made our entire party feel super special and even brought over complimentary, house-made, REAL limoncello. I'm normally not a fan, but this was so tasty. Lastly, while we were waiting for our cab, the owner chatted with us like we've been friends for years. So nice.

Meals: there were 4 of us and we ordered cheese ravioli with vodka sauce, fettuccini Alfredo with mushrooms, veal Parmesan, and fettuccini with marinara and meatballs.  All were big hits. However, my Alfredo didn't come with the mushrooms I requested. Our server was attentive enough and helpful with recommendations. However, if you asked for something, he immediately left to get it. No waiting to see if someone else needed something. The place is small so this style of service can work, but it felt rushed as well.  This, plus the lack of mushrooms with my meal, caused the 4 star review.  We will be back.

2014-12-02,4.0,"Came here for my brother and laws birthday dinner and it was a small group of 6 of us. We came with reservations for Saturday evening at 5:30 p.m. Our waiter was so friendly and jolly. He had a smile on his face the whole time and was very easy to talk to and laid back so a very inviting atmosphere with the basic and elegant Italian ambiance. We were seated in the back and began with bread with olive oil.  Our waiter told us our specials and my brother and law and his wife split the seafood special which was $40. If it wasn't split- I couldn't imagine how filling it could be. My husband and I split the veal with the choice of marsala, and my sister in law and her friend split a linguine dish. I wouldn't know anyone who wouldn't consider splitting because the portions are very big. At least for an Italian restaurant in Chicago they are.  WHAT I LOVED-- and made this restaurant different was the choices on the menu with sauce pairings. I have tasted better marsala but the veal was cooked perfectly. It was just a small size to share but we also got a small ceaser salad to make it a bit more healthy for 6 dollars.  They were more than happy to take our 6 cupcakes that my brother in laws wife surprised him with and brought it out with a candle and a big cheer in Italian when delivering it.  Location is perfect and I would strongly recommend it for families that are in the area. Perfect for double date and small groups as we saw many of those.

2014-11-09,1.0,"If I could give no stars and still write a review I would.  Let me give you a backstory into the horrendous evening that occurred in this establishment. It was our anniversary and my guy wanted to surprise me with an Italian dinner at a nice restaurant since I was desperately missing Italy! (I used to live in Trastevere in Roma, SO I KNOW WHAT ITALIAN FOOD TASTES LIKE THANKS VERY MUCH!)  So he decided to take me to Viaggios for a special evening and called ahead to make the reservation where he specified he'd like a nice table for our anniversary. We arrived and they sat us in a tiny tiny table directly next to the kitchen where my guy had to lean forward when they were bringing dishes out and we later found out something spilled on his suit jacket(hope it comes out). Our server appeared less than enthused to serve us and didn't even tell us the specials which had I known I would have ordered differently. He also came back maybe a total of 3 times the entire night and never asked us if we'd like dessert and just brought us our check as if saying please leave! RUDE! Also being able to peek into the kitchen let me see a lot of men with long black curly hair making food without hair nets!! GROSS!   I chose the linguini with freshly shucked clams and he had Veal Parmesan and his veal was overcooked to where he forced himself to eat half(because at that price you wouldnt want to waste it) and my linguini was overcooked as well with oddly tasting clams but I ate part of it regardless because I was so hungry after waiting an hour for our food after ordering. Also our appetizers came only minutes before our food! Uhh what? We could barely fit all those plates on our insanely small table. Neither of these dishes were prepared correctly and neither tasted very good and look as if they were slopped on a plate haphazardly. For the prices they are charging $26-$35 and up for a plate you think youd be getting at least edible food. NOPE SORRY! You'd be better off going to a fast food italian joint and walking out with a better meal. I have no qualms about paying more money for quality food(I am a chicago foodie and dine out frequently) but when our bill was about $100 for garbage food we barely ate, and terrible service Id say I feel robbed not only of my wonderful guys wallet but also of what was supposed to be a very special night for us. Im sorry we tipped cause God knows I want that money back.   NOW FOR THE BANG ENDING!! FOOOOOOOD POISONING.  Not only were we completely unhappy with our meals and the service and having to dodge plates coming out of the kitchen, WE GOT FOOD POISONING. Nothing says I love you Happy Anniversary than spending the late night/early morning and this afternoon getting sick and being in the bathroom with your significant other. We had so much else planned for anniversary and all plans were off since we were stuck in the bathroom all night and day! THANKS VIAGGOS FOR GIVING US THE WORST ANNIVERSARY AND MAKING US WISH WE NEVER WALKED THROUGH YOUR DOOR! I mean seriously I was in tears I was in so much discomfort and pain last night and this morning. Truly awful! And it still hasn't totally subsided!  Also I have many friends that are foodie bloggers in chicago and have PR friends at Gibbs & Soell, and I work in film as well so I know craft services people and I am not only going to leave this yelp review to WARN future patrons but I am also putting you on blast to every person I listed above and all my friends to never ever grace your establishment with their service and money due to your poor service, and sanitation and also the fact your food is a poor imitation of italian.  VIAGGIOS = FOOD POISIONING!!! Also dont trust reviewers that have ZERO friends and a small amount of reviews, they are probably people that work at Viaggios leaving their own business 5 star reviews!

2014-11-05,2.0,"The service was good. The food, left a little to be desired. It was our first time there, and the server recommended the specials. We ordered the Brick chicken and the Pasta Shrimp linguine which I was told was spicy in a tomato sauce. The food came out right as we were done with our appetizers. The chicken was cooked to perfection. Crispy on the outside and very moist and tender on the inside. However, my pasta wasn't very spicy at all, it was not seasoned one bit. Made the whole meal very bland. I only ate half and got the rest to go, thinking I could add my own spices to it. It was irreparable. The chocolate cake was deliecious though. The poor rating is mainly for the cost of the ""specials"". I spent almost 40 dollars for chicken and mashed potatoes, and 30 bucks for pasta in tomato sauce and unseasoned shrimp.

Rather than serve the squid lightly breaded and fried with a side of marinara, Viaggio only partially fries the calamari and finishes it by mixing with the marinara. It's amazing.  The stuffed clams are wonderful...and they're the worst part of our lunch.  Our entrees...ahhhh. I had the rigatoni with pork Sunday gravy and a side of home made sausage. Did I mention that the dish comes with a scoop of incredible ricotta? What a meal! Possibly the best Italian dish I've ever had.  My wife had linguini with clams in white sauce.

2013-05-05,5.0,This place was wonderful. We arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation so we decided to sit at the bar till a table was ready. The bartender made the most amazing amaretto sours! The best I've had since movie to Illinois. Once our table was ready (not to mention it was ready early) the hostess came over and got us from the bar and he even carried my drink over to the table.  Our waiter was very attentive and very polite. He order each of our courses once we were finished with the previous one.  The food was also served very quick! I had the chicken Parmesan it was delicious. However unless I read the menu wrong I was suppose to get potatoes and vegetables with it and instead I received cheese gnocchis as my side. Once trying it I was hooked after every bite I told my boyfriend it was delicious. It was so filling I had to take my chicken Parmesan home with me. I would definitely recommend this place to people looking for an amazing Italian meal.,0.9869,0.8,0.185,0.016,0.6246031746031746

The waiter claimed they made an ""outstanding"" dirty martini and he wasn't wrong.  Sign me up for a second.   My fiancé ordered the pork chop parmesan.  It was nothing we'd ever seen on a menu before.  Sure, we've had pork chops and we've had chicken parmesan, but never pork chop parmesan. Well, thank you Viaggio's for introducing this into our lives.  A breaded pork chop, covered in red sauce and smothered in cheese with a side of alfredo pasta.  Oh my god!  Worth every calorie. I had a taste for a hearty pasta dish so I went with the Rigatoni with Sunday Pork Gravy  ::sigh::  Fabulous!  I was speechless.  I wasn't expecting huge portions of pork in the gravy and I wasn't expecting the ricotta cheese to go as well as it did.  I will be getting it again.  No need to try something different.   The wait staff was perfect.  As with most Italian restaurants, they are very attentive.  You get the feeling that they are there for you and want you to enjoy your experience.  Now, we don't mind because it feels like you're being well taken care of, but I could see how others looking for a quite dinner might not like it.

2013-04-23,3.0,I don't understand what the hype is all about! We were here with friends on a Friday night and this place was packed. We started off our meal with Zucchini friitters served with a yummy marinara sauce. But it went downhill from there when I looked into the menu and the only veggie options were pasta with one of their sauces. I got the house pasta with arrabiata which was a let down. The pasta with vodka sauce was good but nothing exceptional and so I thought may be its one of those places that excels at cooking the meat perfectly but one of our friends who got a pork dish was pretty disappointed too. May be its just that I have been to too many fabulous Italian restaurants in the city that Viaggio fails meet my expectations.,0.9727,0.758,0.192,0.05,0.6762626262626262

With 4 vegetarians on the table, we ended up with dishes which tasted almost the same. The best of the lot was the vodka sauce. Our friends ordered the house pasta to go with their sauces and I was not a big fan of their house pasta. It was a little tough and too doughy.",0.8179,0.859,0.095,0.046,0.3458333333333333

2013-03-12,1.0,"I meant to write this review sooner. We were here in December with a party of 6 ready to celebrate the holidays. While the food was good, the service was ABYSMAL. Where to begin?  Rob the host was more concerned with chatting with his friends at the bar than working in any capacity that evening. Our server certainly couldn't get the job done. He was simply awful. Drinks were super slow. Two of us ordered the special brick chicken and only one arrived. So, the rest of us waited with our dinners cooling in front of us until our friend insisted we begin. We ate slowly... and her dinner NEVER materialized. When I finally got up from the table to find out what the deal was (no one had ever come back), Rob the host (our table was right across from the host stand near the door) was yucking it up at the bar. He saw me looking for assistance-- you can be sure-- but stayed put. Finally found a manager in the back (who actually WAS busy--his name may have been Sean?) who went to check on the order. Keep in mind the rest of the group is finished and the table has been cleared by the bus boy. We are now told the brick chicken takes a long time to prepare--30 minutes. Hmmm. Maybe you could have told us that at the time you delivered the wrong meal?  Mistakes happen--my friend would have been mildly dissappointed to accept something she did not order, but given the options would have accepted the chicken dish they delivered. She just wrapped up her meal to go when it finally arrived.   We are a fun group and not hard to please.  The manager comped desserts and was very apologetic. Too little too late. The service was beyond unacceptable. Never again.",0.8931,0.828,0.111,0.061,0.5975264550264552
2013-02-19,5.0,"This place is awesome. It couldn't be better. We arrived on a slow night around 9:15 and they had pretty much closed by the time we stepped foot into the restaurant. Because we're from out of town and don't know anything about the different areas in Chicago, and had cabbed there from our hotel, we were worried that we weren't going to find anywhere that would serve us late. Instead of being mad that they couldn't close, the staff assured us that they'd take us for dinner anyway, and immediately seated us.  The service was impeccable. Everyone was helpful and kind. I loved everyone working there. And now to the best part--the food. We started with the meatball salad, which everyone recommended on here and damn, it was well worth it. The meatball was the best I've ever had and paired with the greens and the light vinaigrette, it was perfect. When I first heard about this option, I was slightly skeptical, since that's something that I wouldn't normally order. Now, after tasting it, I'm a believer. I'd order it again and again. I had linguine with alfredo sauce and sausage and it was better than any alfredo pasta I ever had in Italy, and I've been several times. The sauce, which they make fresh daily was perfect. My mom got the loop veal (I think it was called that?) and she went crazy. The portions are huge and were were actually sad that we couldn't finish all of our food--it was that freaking good.

I made a reservation and had no wait upon arrival.  The Yelp reviews are right about portion size, I took home leftovers and I eat a lot!  I can tell this is a great place because there were several people coming in who appeared to be regulars and didn't even need a menu.   Service - The Manager took my coat when I arrived and even though only one of my party of 6 had arrived, he asked if I'd like to be seated at the table anyway or have a drink at the bar.  Additionally, a member of our party went to the wrong location and was an hour late.  The server kept checking back to see how soon she would arrive and ask if we wanted him to start anything for her (because we started eating).  When she did arrive, he was over in about 2 seconds to get her order. Food - Fabulous!  The peppers they serve with the bread are scrumptious.  We also had the calamari, which was good.  Be sure to order your sauce on the side if you don't want wet calamari.  I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara (no mushrooms) and it was delish.  However, when I reheated the next day it was too oily.  My friend, who is a pretty picky eater, had the Chicken Parmesan and loved it.  Oh, and the meatball salad is all it's cracked up to be.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the gelato.  The pistachio gelato tasted like coffee and didn't have that smooth, creamy gelato texture that I love.  The tiramisu was spot on though.   I'll be back.  Oh, street parking is a little scarce...at least on Friday night.  Watch out for permit parking signs on side streets.",0.99,0.819,0.152,0.029,0.5851276742581091

Fantastic service from before we even got to the restaurant with them calling us to confirm the reservation. When we arrived they took our coats and we were seated promptly. The bread and marinated peppers were both delicious and before we knew it, we had our appetizers.  We first ordered the Caesar salad with dressing on the side, as I needed a different dressing, being vegetarian (Caeser has anchovies in it). They were very accommodating and knowledgable about the menu and what was in the food. We also ordered the bruschetta which was delicious. Both portions were generous and the timing was perfect for our mains coming out. 2 appetizers were enough for 3 people. As far as mains went, we ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana, the Seabass special and the Tortellacci special with veal inside. All 3 were incredibly generous portions and myself and my mother both took about half home. The Seabass came with 2 fillets of fish which I am told were cooked perfectly, along with linguini and a bed of peas and other veggies. The tortellacci also came with vegetables and sounded like they were cooked to perfection. My Eggplant Parmigiana was perfect, complete with a 4-cheese tortellini on the side. Couldn't have asked for better! To finish off the meal, we got both the flourless chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato and the cheesecake. Both were fantastic. I would highly recommend both depending on if you have a taste for chocolate or creamy cheesecake goodness. I'm a baker, and I was impressed. They're a very rich finish off to the evening. We also ordered coffees and they were more than happy to accommodate a decaf cappuccino along with other caffeinated beverages. Overall, a fantastic experience at Viaggio's.

2012-11-16,5.0,"I'm Italian so for 5 stars it better be good.  I was not disappointed.   After a busy cold day in November a warm restaurant with ""crust"" bread wine and pasta was just what I needed.   My daughters and I were in the neighborhood and noticed this restaurant and decided to give it a try.  We were luck enough to find street parking about a block away so we figured that was a good sign. We were greeted at the door and seated immediately.  It was a decent crowd for a Thursday evening.  The atmosphere was quiet and unassuming.  Our waiter appeared with water and ready to take our drink orders which arrived almost immediately.  Warm right out of the oven bread with the best crust soon followed.   I had the special Shrimp De Jonge (not Italian but with all the garlic it qualifies) it was heaven on a plate.  Not over done with just the right amount of buttered bread crumbs in garlic sauce so that I could dip my bread in to retrieve every last bite. One daughter had the chicken spinach salad (think she is thinking about the LBD (little black dress for Christmas).  She thoroughly enjoyed it with its grilled chicken, fresh spinach and chunks of cheese. The other daughter ordered one of the specials as well, squash ravioli with toasted sage butter.  The pasta was wonderfully tender with just the right amount of squash stuffing.  The sage was toasted and melted in your mouth as did the butter brown sugar sauce.

2012-10-15,1.0,"My friend was in town from Atlanta this weekend and we wanted to go out to dinner just the 2 of us on Saturday. We decided to try Viaggio since the reviews were so good! When we arrived we were seated right away which was great. I have to say that it went downhill from there.  First, our waiter constantly pestered us to order. I have never felt so uncomfortable and pressured to order. I think if I want to sit and enjoy my wine I should be able to do that for as long as I'd like. I'm paying for this meal right? We started out with the antipasto which was not very good. The meats and cheese were unimpressive and lacking in flavor. For the main course we ordered the orchietta and carbonara. The orchietta was terrible. It was soup with pasta sprinkled it. Inedible.  The carbonara was just OK. I prefer carbonara to be made the traditional way with egg not cream. Why do so many restaurants in the states refuse to make carbonara the way it should be made. The sauce was way too heavy and it wasn't very flavorful. I took a bite or 2 simply because I was hungry and could not eat the orchietta. And our waiter didn't seem to care that we barely touched our food. He was most interested in rushing us throughout our meal.  When we finished our meal our waiter dropped off the check. We sat there and enjoyed our wine, and our waiter kept hovering over our table clearly wanting the bill right away. Again, I have never had a waiter make me feel so uncomfortable. He literally came over pulled the check out of my hands because he couldn't wait any longer I guess? What kind of service is that? Again, I'm paying for this meal right?  I would not recommend this place to anyone. Lastly, I'd like to add that I would have given this restaurant no stars if yelp allowed it.",0.9425,0.831,0.104,0.065,0.5357427055702918

For dinner I had the pork chop italian, which sounds a little boring on the menu, but is so great and full of flavor, I HIGHLY recommend it.  My husband had an awesome short rib and polenta special that was also great.

2012-10-08,2.0,"I'll start on a high note: great service, nice ambience, though noisy on busy nights. Now that that's out of the way, here's what matters: the food is awful.  I've been here twice now, and I'm done.  The first time i went i had the cavatelli with shrimp. The pasta was mushy, like bland nubbins of raw dough. Not impressed. I took several months away, and went back recently - this time I had the lobster ravioli, a special that night. The pasta was overdone, the lobster filling was nast, the ravioli were swimming in butter and oil, and topped with soggy breadcrumbs.  Definitely not a place for vegetarians unless you want plain pasta with olive oil, marinara, or alfredo.  Or the very original eggplant parmesan. Being a pescatarian doesn't help either. Limited selection unless you love chicken and veal.  As a side note, when a menu describes everything as ""grilled (or seared or baked or whatevered) to perfection"", a red flag goes up, emblazoned with the words ""this restaurant sucks"". It's like they're trying to convince me that something is good. In this case the red flag was dead on.  Blown away by the 4.5 star average on yelp. Really yelpers?

My good friends Barisa and Joel have been raving about their favorite Italian place in the city (or at least the closest one) called Viaggio so it was just a mater of time before we all went. [It was two months ago]. Bottom line is that the place is a very solid, authentic and homey Italian restaurant with all the classics. It reminds me of a non-chain (though there are two locations) Maggianos - large affordable family style dishes of no non-sense classic Italian (and the crazy surprise is how hard that is to find in the city). Servers are great and authentic and the decor is decidedly simple and efficient.  We started with the famous meatball salad - which is not what I was expecting. It is literally a green house salad served with meatballs. Quite delicious though. I had a veal parmesan (I think) and tried the spaghetti with meat sauce. I preferred the pasta over my veal but everything was solid good and great value. It's not world class mind changing Italian - but is it ever supposed to be? I grew up with pasta as a comfort food so as long as I really enjoy the dish and sauce I'm a really happy man.  I'm not sure I'd run back but I definitely would return and if someone asked for a similar recommendation I'd be happy to send them Viaggio's way.",0.9941,0.758,0.215,0.026,0.5050917658730159

As for the entrees, the Rigatoni with Sunday Pork was tasty, but the pasta did not taste like it was ""home made"" and the pork was slightly overcooked.  That said, I thought that the sauce was good, not great.   As for the Seafood Diablo, it was a disaster.  First, the seafood was overcooked and rubbery.  Second, the sauce was a strange bisque-like sauce.  Finally, it was bland.  When we had it sent back for some added spice, the kitchen responded by flashing it in a pan with an excessive amount of red pepper flakes.  My girlfriend ended up vomitting several times later in the night from it.  I took a small bite to taste it and later suffered from extreme stomach pain and diarrhea.  Safe to say, we will never return to Viaggio again.   Despite all the comments above, I still want to reiterate that the service was very good.  I appreciated that the server helped us grab a cab, but food quality is the reason you go to a restaurant.  In terms of food quality, Viaggio is underwhelming and unmemorable.  If you have a chance, go to Lavo to experience a better Italian meal.",0.9862,0.803,0.14,0.058,0.5168990929705216

The food itself was outstanding. All three of us had checked the menu online beforehand, but a couple of us still needed to sort through the possibilities (including specials) when we arrived. We split an antipasto salad--delicious, and the server was right, it fed all three. One person selected the eggplant parmesan partly because he makes it himself and considers it one of his specials. He loved it, and I agreed after taking a taste. The tortellini that accompanied the eggplant could have stood alone as an entree, it was that good. Because Viaggio makes its own pasta, two of us went that way: spaghetti alfredo looked wonderful and our friend said it tasted as good as it looked and smelled. After telling the server I was undecided between two options, he recommended the orchietta (hot and sweet sausage and escarole beans with shells). I am in his debt, because I have not enjoyed such flavors before. Portions were generous--two of us had leftovers. The food was well priced and worth every penny.

So instead we ended up slightly more forward but now sandwiched between two massive event tables. WHY Viaggio? WHY when there were so many empty tables towards the front? Within the next 20 minutes, the group tables next to us filled up quickly. You would have thought it was a United Center event night (it wasn't - we checked). The waiter, busy with the big tables, couldn't be bothered with our tiny foursome the entire meal. He quickly rattled off us the specials, did a drive by with the wine bottle, and hastily took our orders. The group tables were so large that at one point he was yelling out the specials above the din. It made for an interesting atmosphere that's for sure. We were hoping for a relaxing dinner but ended up feeling more like we were at a fast food joint.

Not only was the food amazing but our server Michael (who happens to be related to one of the owners) waited on my fiancee and I. Every recommendation he made - down the the reasonably priced bottle of wine was delicious. I was served the biggest portion of sea bass I have ever seen over a bed of pasta smothered in a lemon caper white wine sauce with asparagus and red peppers. This item was not on the menu but it was like they went into my brain and asked me what I would want to eat and created the perfect version.  Tim had hands down the best parmesan I have ever had. We were planning on ordering the veal parmesan but Michael said we should order the pork chop ""parmesan"" and he was right. They pound this piece of meat until it is more tender then veal and serve it like a traditional chicken parmesan, but instead of a side of pasta with red sauce, they served the meal with tortellini and white sauce that were so perfect. So good.  But the thing that both really knocked us off our feet was the meatball salad. This meatball was amazing. Now my fiancee is a meat lover and he says this is the best meatball he has ever had - and I totally agree! If you try anything at this place this has to be it!.

The service was incredibly friendly though, and as we sat down, he offered us wonderful descriptions of the food and drink.  We started with a fried zucchini appetizer that was well-seasoned and delicious while the table made their decisions. I knew what I was ordering the whole time: Rigatoni with Sunday Pork Gravy.  My sister ordered a spinach-stuffed gnocchi (a special), my brother ordered the steak, and my cousin ordered a sea bass with lemon/olive oil/white wine sauce. The rigatoni was AMAZING.  It really hit the spot, and it was how others had described it.  Pork was tender, sauce was hearty, and the pasta was cooked well.  The portion was also humongous so I ended up (happily) with leftovers. The spinach-stuffed gnocchi dish sounded wonderful when described, but in practice, it was a bit flavorless.  Something needed to be amped up in the dish.  The steak was tough and chewy, and definitely not recommended (although the twice-baked potato it came with was quite good and flavorful). The other standout dish of the night was the sea bass.  It was beautifully cooked and the sauce complemented it well.  This was the only dish that the table completely finished. Along with drinks (a bottle of wine, and a separate glass) and food, the tab came out to be about $50 a person (including tax and tip).  We did get two of the most expensive dishes, but regardless, this isn't a cheap place.  Definitely an experience worth trying though!",0.9758,0.874,0.105,0.022,0.5825396825396826

Mind you, it's the first time I've been to Chicago and have no idea what's in the area. Yelp to the rescue! Viaggio was among the first recos from the search. I was worried that they couldn't fit us so last minute, but the person on the phone quickly took my reservation of 7 for 7:30pm. He didn't even bat an eye when only 5 of us showed and were even seated immediately! Service here is amazing! Within 20 seconds of seating, we were given a plate of the most delish roasted peppers and a basket full of bread to start. Our glasses were always full and our waiter was always there to refill our wine glasses. Now onto the food! We ordered their signature dish - meatball salad - and the fried mozzarella with tomatoes & prosciutto to share. Both dishes were amazing! The meatballs were perfectly seasoned with the right amount of kick and the salad was accompanied by gorgeous heirloom tomatoes. (Tip: use the meatball sauce as salad dressing. You'll never go back to traditional dressing!) The mozzarella was out of this world. Fried mozzarella topped with grated parmesan, sliced parmesan, diced tomatoes, and prociutto. Cheese topped with cheese that is topped with more cheese. Need I say more? I ordered my ultimate Italian fave - linguine with white clams sauce - and it did not disappoint. Pasta was al dente, clams were freshly shucked, and sauce was perfect. Everyone else had the lasagna, buttersquash ravioli (special of the night), penne with peas and mushrooms, and veal something (forgot which veal, sorry!). Since everyone scarfed down their dish, I'm going to assume that they liked it. We were beyond full, but can't go to an Italian restaurant, especially one this good, without getting the tiramisu... So we ordered one to share. It was UNBELIEVABLE! Definitely the best tiramisu I've ever had. Not too sweet, right amount of rum, and the surprise was the chocolate chips that were mixed into the mascarpone. Yum! Thanks Viaggio for showing a girl from NYC how Italian food is supposed to be.

Must-haves:   Meatball salad ($10). This was described by our energetic and helpful waiter, Michael, as ""what's left on your plate as you get to the end of dinner at grandma's house: some meat, some salad, a little sauce.""  Probably not the most appealing thought, but we decided to dive in based on his promise that ""if you don't like it, I'll pay for it.""  We loved it! Rigatoni with Sunday pork gravy ($16. About a dollar a pound in my estimation! Lol!).  Nope, it's not a gravy. It's a delicious red sauce made of San Marzano tomatoes and giant pieces of pork that have been slow-cooked all day.  A generous dollop of Ricotta cheese is the finishing touch on this outstanding--and enormous--dish!  Not quite as good in my book, was the cavatellis shrimp & broccoli ($24), which seemed under-flavored and over cooked to me.  That said, this dish was ordered by my dining companion and he loved every bite.

I could smell the freshness of the tomatoes from the center of the table. They also add red onion to the dish which gives it a nice spark. Meatball - very moist but needed more spice The service is outstanding. Our waiter was so enthusiatic and knowledgeable. I didn't see a glass of Montepulciano so I asked, if they had one.

I don't know whether Viaggio (or I) suffered from heightened expectations but I just didn't get the fuss. I'm pretty fortunate to have a fantastic trattoria relatively close to my home. Chef Anthony, I have no reason to cheat on you. Street parking was easy to find, so don't bother wasting your money on the valet. My party was greeted by (I think) the owner: an affable fellow who made me feel pretty comfortable. For his sake, I wish that I was as bowled over by the place as my fellow yelpers. He has a great laugh and seemed genuinely friendly. Points. My waiter, on the other hand, wasn't as outgoing. To be fair, he seemed pretty much 'in the weeds' from the moment we sat down but... it was crazy early (6:30) and there weren't many people in the restaurant. You're a professional server. This is easy. Don't get overwhelmed. The bussing staff seemed much more on top of things. In fact, I would suggest either one of the bussers who attended to my table to get raises. They were class acts. I ordered a small Caesar salad and the orecchiette. Orecchiette is my Italian restaurant litmus meal: if I like it, odds are I like the restaurant. I didn't care for mine. To begin with, my salad and entree came out within fifteen minutes of me ordering it. Such speed, while admirable in the McKingFC world, doesn't bring to mind 'freshly made just for me' in any other setting. So, we're immediately starting from a deficit here. The salad was passable. It was especially salty without the benefit of heavy dressing or visible anchovies, so there's a mystery to be solved. I downed a lot of water while just eating the salad. The orecchiette was... a little less than a-ok. Serviceable, perhaps. Again, it was served to me so quickly that I wondered if it was an oops order from earlier. The sausage served with the pasta came in the form of hunks of tubular Italian sausage, rather than a crumbly hot sausage. In fact the sausage overwhelmed the dish entirely. I left much of it on the plate. I enjoyed the white beans but there was no heat to the dish. What I enjoy about orecchiette is the sweet heat in every bite. This was bland. I added red pepper flakes to the dish in search of some sort of seasoning. At the end of the meal, I was left feeling confused. I was expecting so much more than I experienced. Again, I wonder, ""Did I miss something?"" But, looking over what I just wrote... I don't think that I did. My experience was probably closer to a 2.5 but given the sheer love everyone else has for Viaggio and the charming fellow in the front of the restaurant, I will round the stars up. That said, next time I get an Italian food jones, I think I'll satisfy it in Lincoln Park.",0.9983,0.732,0.207,0.061,0.4808429118773946

The appetizer of baked clams and the veal scaloppini  were deliciously satisfying but what you would expect from a good Italian restaurant. What really blew me away was the special of the day - risotto primavera with shrimp. Although the Arborio rice was a little bit more overcooked than I would've liked, the flavor of the risotto was the best I've ever tasted. It came with a generous selection of veggies (including asparagus!) and large, succulent shrimp. Maybe they just use more cream and butter than the other places but this was so good, I didn't care. Like many Italian restaurants, the portions are comically large (yay!), but there is a $3 split fee.

2011-06-23,5.0,"Viaggio is the best Italian Restaurant in the City. Everything on their menu is made fresh, is authentic, and is delightful. I visit this gem at least once a month and have gotten to know the owner, the chef, and the waiters. Nick is our usual waiter and he does everything possible to make you feel at home. Just listening him describe the daily specials will make your mouth water.  There is literally nothing bad on the menu. I usually stick to the Chicken Parm with tortellini (Best Cream Sauce EVER!) and there is always enough for lunch the following day. One time while Mike was waiting on us, he encouraged us to try the meatball salad. We were so confident about their food that we took the plunge. We ordered the Meatball Salad.....  Nervously we waited for the salad to come out and to our pleasure the meatballs were slightly off to the side of the plate.  However, Mike started mixing the Meatballs, their ""gravy "" in with the salad right before our eyes - I was terrified!  Regardless, we decided to take a bite of the strange concoction.......FABULOUS!!!! The temperature of the Meatballs and gravy contrasted to the cold crisp lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and salad dressing was to die for! Its now my favorite thing on the menu!

Were it of any significance consequence, this review would be glowing but might cost a star, but all I can say is this 5 star is not a gift in any way, they earned it.  If you have not tried this Ristorante, what in God's Green Earth are you waiting for???  The ambiance is not as small as 1 review indicates, this is actually comfortable by city standards, and in some cases quite roomy comes to mind.  The waiter was very outgoing, friendly and just as robusto as some of the menu choices. They served the cooked peppers right away without asking, and it was quite tasty.  When we said we had never been here and read a lot about the meatball salad, he offered that we had to try it, hands down a favorite of the palce.  We were a little skeptical but he said if we did not like it he would not charge us for it.  We ate our words, and every last bite. It was so very unique and tasty I was surprised that such a strange combo could tast this good, cold salad mixed with a little dressing, a red sauce and meatball, which was awesome by the way. Dinner did not dissapoint at all, I had the marsala and my date had the carbonara, and some out of this world dense flour-less chocolate cake for dessert.  Any itialian place should do these 2 dishes very well, but these were really old world great!

2011-05-16,5.0,"Ok, after just one visit, Viaggio has become one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. After seeing them on Check Please for the second time, we decided to give them a shot. As I went to make reservations, I saw that they are not always open on Sunday, except when there is an event at United Center...but we were in luck since the Bulls were playing that night. When we arrived, the place was packed, and even though we weren't going to the game, our reservations coincided with prime time for game-goers, but we were still seated instantly, after being greeted by the extremely friendly host. The place was buzzing, with the energetic staff literally *running* to serve people (gotta love that!). We were served by Michael, who was SO extremely attentive, and had Personality Plus. We started by sharing the meatball salad, which he deftly split at the table for us. The salad was fantastic, as was the bread and complimentary roasted peppers. I ordered the Eight Finger Cavatelli and BF got the Rigatoni with Sunday Pork Gravy. The entrees arrived and OMG, the portions were HUGE. Now I am not typically one to rave about portion size, as I prefer quality over quantity, but these entrees were the best of both. I have enough delicious leftovers for two lunches. The Cavatelli was obviously handmade and OH SO FLIPPING GOOD...BF's Rigatoni was similarly delicious (and he who rarely has leftovers had his wrapped up too). For dessert we ordered lemon and pomegranate sorbets, also excellent. I think every restauranteur in the city should go to Viaggio's and take notes...I cannot say enough good things about the food and the service at this place!

I'm all for efficient use of space, but when I run the risk of knocking over someone's glass of vino just by trying to wave down a waiter...there's a problem.  Anyway, let's talk about the grub.  Meatball Salad: Mmmmmyes! Delicious giant meatballs atop nicely dressed romaine. Awesome. Easily the best dish of the night.  Eggplant stacks: I'm not an eggplant fan at all, but this was tasty and not too eggplanty. Don't be fooled, but half this dish eats like a meal because of the friedliciousness. Linguine with clams: Ugh. Salt city. It was a decent portion but I could barely eat this due to how salty the sauce was, which to be fair, had good flavor.

Well, Viaggio is well worth its 5 stars and you can tell that even before you get a bite of their food. It's been way too long since I've been back to Viaggio, but I had a taste for pasta last night and decided I need to go back as soon as I write a Yelp review.  I'd consider myself an expert in all things Italian, from sports cars to Limoncello, so I'm definitely skeptical whenever anyone tells me they had great Italian at a place I've not yet approved. Well, on one particular Friday, it was getting late and we had a taste for Italian so I called ahead to make sure there wouldn't be a wait, and the host was very pleasant and funny - when he asked how many would be in our party, I said 48, and he gladly obliged. When we arrived, he sat us at a table for 2 (I'm not sure how he figured out I was kidding), recommended a few things, and then left us to feast. First: I'm huge on restaurants that bring you something to snack on because, well, I snack constantly. Viaggio brings this delicious, warm bread with olive oil and peppers! Yum.  We had a couple of glasses of wine, a Caesar salad (not too heavy on the dressing, very light and refreshing), and then I had hands down one of the most perfect meals of pasta I think has probably ever existed. It was an 8-finger cavatelli (by far the best kind of pasta) in a perfectly-spiced vodka sauce with the tastiest, most perfect sausage on top. WOW. Phenomenal.

Upon arrival it was nice to have very friendly valet take my vehicle immediately without any wait at all. After entering we were met by Anthony who informed us our table would be ready in one minute. We took advantage of the moment to look at the wine list at the bar and order a glass. After the minute had passed another couple walked in and were directed to our table. I must of had a pissed off look on my face because Anthony instantly came over to apologize and got us another table. Anthony explained he thought we wanted a minute to order wine and gave our table to another couple but would have a table for us in a very short time. Due to the misunderstanding the house paid for our two glasses of wine without us complaining or looking for anything (great touch). I'll try to keep the rest short. Mike the waiter was a great server and offered up something that was not on the menu when my wife ordered Salmon. He suggested she get it prepared vesuvio style and would ask the chef. I had the pasta with Sunday pork gravy and I was very pleased. We also had the eggplant stack appetizer, which to our surprise was a cold dish and we anticipated it being like eggplant parm. We were very happy with the crispy eggplant with fresh Mozzarella and sweet balsamic vinegar (excellent). We really enjoyed this restaurant and will make it one of our regulars.

We waited and waited for our food.  At some point we had to ask if they usually brought out bread.  They apologized and brought us some.  I think at that point we were so hungry and we totally chowed down on the bread.  It was good.  The roasted bell peppers in olive oil were good, but I would have preferred olive oil with parmesan cheese or just butter. For the entrees, we ordered and shared the eggplant parmesan and penne vodka.  The penne vodka was one of the best I've ever had.  The eggplant was good.  Oh, they did have this side of pasta with the parm which was AWESOME.  It was like this stuffed tortellini or something with an Alfredo sauce.  It was outstanding. I'd definitely go back to Viaggio.  It is one of my favorite Italian places based on the food.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt for the mediocre service.  The pastas make it worth it.  I'm optimistic that next time will be better. One question I have for them is why do they charge for coke refills?  That's kind of strange in this day and age.",0.9955,0.761,0.21,0.029,0.5425555555555556

We started with the eggplant stack, as everyone recommended, and it was delish! Breaded eggplant, mozzarella, tomato, and plenty of arugula. The flavors were amazing together. I chose the spaghetti cabonara for my entree. The plate was ginormous. No joke. The server warned me that there was meat in the dish and I said, bring on the meat. Thanks to that comment, I got extra prosciutto in my pasta. Maybe a little too much, but that was my fault. I loved the cabonara, but it was definitely too much for me and I was only able to finish half. I also tried my friends' dishes: pasta with clams and a pasta with vodka sauce, all were pretty awesome as well.

We ordered martinis, French and dirty. French martini was so-so, its one of my favorites but I'm having a hard time finding a place where its good.

They asked if I had any questions which was unusual in and of itself. I asked about the parking situation and they said the valet was $10 and that they had a complimentary shuttle over to the UC. That is a really nice touch, especially on a cold Saturday night in January. The restaurant is cute but nothing unusual.  My wife had a rich and outstanding Lobster Ravioli and I had an excellent Veal Parmesean.  Both serviings were substantial. My side dish was a Cheese Totellini in alfredo sauce which was nice touch, most restuarants just serve a basic pasta with a red sauce. For dessert  I had a really nice cannoli. It was served on an attractively decorated plate and had just the right amount of crunch and had a generous amount of nuts on both ends decorated the tasty cream filling.

OH WOW. this was so good. we had another course coming after this so i tried not to eat too much but it was difficult since it was one of the more delicious pastas i've tasted.  moving on to the reason i am so in love with viaggio, the veal parmesean. now, michael kept telling us throughout our meal, ""the portions are huge, don't try to finish everything, you can take things home, you'll want dessert"" etc etc etc. did i listen? no. because the veal parmesean is that good. as is the tortellini in the light cream sauce that comes perfectly portioned on the side. this is my favorite meal ever and i will be coming back to viaggio again and again to eat this. oh, and george enjoyed his sunday pork gravy pasta very much - unfortunately i didn't have a chance to try it because i was too focused on winning some sort of eating competition that was going on in my head. after this amazing dinner, i still had my game face on and was ready to forge onward towards dessert. so we tried some of mike's scrumptious homemade limoncello (seriously the best), downed a perfectly made cappuccino, and moved on to the handsome portion of profiteroles. these were made perfectly with delectable cream filling (not ice cream, like some places do) and chocolate sauce - and when i had finished the last bite, the whole restaurant broke into raucous cheering and applause.

Our first attempt to dine at Viaggio failed as we tried at last minute & could not find a time that worked for us.

After swooning over the complementary roasted peppers, my wife & I shared an order of the most delicious mussels  & Italian toasted bread either of us had ever tasted. Fresh, plump, large, tender mussels in a perfectly seasoned broth. My God. We also shared a fresh, crisp plate of mixed greens. Then, two amazing delicious entrées. My wife had lobster ravioli with large chunks of tender Maine lobster atop freshly prepared homemade filled pasta.

Last Saturday a few friends were going out to dinner and initially I was going to meet them toward the tail end of dinner - save some $$ and some calories, but I checked out the Yelp reviews of Viaggio and looked at the menu and decided to give it a shot.  And what an experience it was. We had a great time. Not only was the food delicious but the service was great and the environment was relaxed and comfortable.  To start with the food - the sauteed peppers that come with the bread were delicious. I am a pepper lover and they were outstanding! We had the bruchetta appetizer which was flavorful and fresh. I ordered the ""West Loop"" chicken and because I wanted to watch some calories, got it with grilled chicken instead of the menu version which was breaded and pan cooked. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the mushroom, spinach, ricotta, tomato topping was a perfect complement. I did also taste some of the other entrees. The 8 finger cavatelli was scruptious - try it with the vodka sauce. Yumm! And the spaghetti carbonera was the hit of the table. If you want something rich and delicious, it's a must try! As many people have stated, the portions are huge. You won't leave hungry - that's for sure.  In addition to our great food, our waiter, Ovi, made our evening more enjoyable. His service was great and he had fun with us too. He made great recommendations for our meals and didn't give me any attitude about modifying my dinner to suit my preferences (this does happen a lot at other restaurants). To top it all off, he brought us complimentary limoncello shots which were mmmm mmmm good! He definitely played off of our personalities to make the night more fun and added a few more laughs to our already laughter ridden conversation.

Then the server reminded me when i did not eat much of my meal that 'he had warned me'--but i did not eat much of my pasta because it was overcooked and mushy, not because i was already full.   The peppers served with the bread (complimentary) are delicious and easily replace any appetizers.  Pastas can be ordered with a variety of sauces; both of us choose thoat route.  We did so because we wanted pasta, but i did wonder if the server felt we were ordering the cheapest (the meats and fish were significantly more expensive, for our meal, the bottle of wine was the biggest cost driver.) My guest ordered the vodka penne with sausage which was delicious (i had pasta envy). I ordered the penne with oil, garlic and broccoli--a mush mess. the broccoli was falling apart--way overcooked, and the penne easily broke into pieces--also mushy.  the dish had a lot of potential and if i were not with a cranky client (due to the long unexplained wait) i would have returned it.  the server was never around long enough to actually speak to about the food, and i did not wish to delay the overall meal.",0.9052,0.839,0.094,0.067,0.5451612903225808
2010-09-27,5.0,"O.M.G.  I was visiting Chicago earlier this summer and my fellow Yelpers directed me to this place.  Good news: it was THE BEST Italian food I've ever had.  Bad news: it is now the standard by which I judge all other Italian restaurants.  Unfortunately there aren't a lot of places with food like this, and I'm in California so I can't just go and grab dinner here whenever I want. I had the special, which was ravioli stuffed with Italian sausage and broccolini in a tomato white wine sauce.  I've never heard of a dish like this before, but our waiter (I believe his name was Ovi) said if I didn't like it they'd get me something else, so I figured I couldn't go wrong.  It was amazing and such a unique and delicious plate.   For dessert we had the tiramisu and yes, I know, you're thinking this is nothing special, it's a standard dessert.  I have never had a tiramisu like this before.  It had all the flavors, but they weren't overdone or heavy like you'll find at some places.  It was also very airy without being dry or bland.  Best tiramisu I've had, by far! The service was excellent.  Our waiter had great suggestions and Jimmy, the valet parker, can stop a cab like nobody's business. In terms of attire, we came in pretty casual (jeans, flip flops. long sleeved-tee) as we were told there was no dress code and casual was ok.  However, I'd recommend dressing a bit nicer as we definitely felt a wee bit underdressed.",0.9972,0.686,0.273,0.041,0.5545815295815296
2010-09-24,5.0,"Let's get some things right off the bat. An American Italian restaurant is like any other American Italian restaurant across the street from itself. Complimentary bread, great wine, fresh seafood, huge pasta servings, and more pasta on top of that. But what sets this place apart on our visit was the ambience and the service. We came here for a surprise birthday psrty for a friend, and the owner couldnt be any more helpful. He accommodated a dozen of us without a problem, stored our cake, turned down the lughts, and even played along and confused the birthday friend so as to maintain the element of surprise. From experience elsewhere, you're lucky to find a place that will even let you host a party group without forcing you to rent a party room. Kudos to the owner. Our waiter, Nicholas (Nickolas?, Nichlaus? Qnicklaus[with a silent Q]?) was the man of the hour. Knew his wine list, and was a total ham: perfect service for a birthday celebration. He was attentive and never left a glass half full. Also, he gets another gold star for proving to be a genuine Italian when I showcased my limited Italian by saying a vulgar statement and he couldn't help but laugh out loud and say ""don't say that to your mother!""  Grazie to Nic for keeping the soap out of my mouth. Now onto the food review (and back to the service again shortly). Initially you get a plate of what looks like pickled vegetables, but in fact it's peppers soaked in olive oil. Don't let the appearance scare you because it's fantastic with the complimentary bread.  Then we had calimari, mussels, and bruschetta for appetizers. Calimari was great though a bit salty and soaked in marinara and peppers. Lost a bit of crunch but it still tasted great. As for the bruschetta it was piled wicked high with tomatoes and onion which was a feat to eat. Tomatoes spilled everywhere including in my hand as I took a bite. But the tomato topping was fantastic. It's easy to use the extra bread to wipe up the tomatoes and eat some more. As for the main course I had eight finger cavatelli. Essentially long noodles as thick as well, fingers in a marinara sauce. It was absolutely fantastic. They were not too dense, not too soft, not overcooked, and absolutely tender. And finally to top off the end of the night, our waiter Nic shared some of his homemade lemoncello. Not a complicated beverage, but it was homemade which means that this lemoncello was AT LEAST a month old. That's like sharing for your finest wine in the house...with your mailman. Thank you Nic for being generous with your ""Italian moonshine"". And of course only a few gripes. First is that the portions are huge. Yes that's the Italian way and normally never a bad thing. But when they charge you $3.00 extra to split a dish, that's not very cool. Second is that it's not a very convenient location if you drive. There's no parking lot, and the nearest parking is paid street parking, valet, or risk getting a ticket parking one street over that's residential. But in all seriousness not even my gripes can knock it down a star. Great food, great service, and great Italians. Bravo!",0.9983,0.753,0.199,0.048,0.460045695045695

For dinner we had the shrimp risotto special and the half chicken special.  The shrimp risotto was perfectly prepared.  There was a delicate crust on the top with the risotto being creamy underneath.  Each large shrimp was perfectly cooked with that slight ""pop"" when you took a bite.  The half chicken was served on the bone in a marinara sauce, but was so tender it was easily falling off the bone.  It was served with a large side of mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. For dessert we had the creme brulee.  While this is not usually my first choice for a dessert I was not only not disappointed but utterly delighted!  The glazed top layer had a perfect crispness that melded with the creaminess underneath.  Slivered almonds were also incorporated. For beverages, we enjoyed a couple of glasses of Chianti and each had a limoncello.  Both were tasty and complimented the meal well.

I was also looking for a restaurant that would proudly showcase the Chicago feel and experience for all the out of town guests. After many weeks of gathering suggestions from all my Italian friends, I went to this site (Yelp) for some additional ideas.  Viaggio was highly rated, so we made a reservation for dinner to check out the food and atmosphere.   WE WERE BLOWN AWAY.  There was no need to look any further. This was the place where we were going to host the dinner bringing the two families officially together for the first time.  The food was absolutely unforgettable.  I could not stop thinking about the meatball salad (It still makes my mouth water just thinking about it.).  So, we booked the dinner there.

2010-07-19,4.0,"3.5 stars. I had such high hopes for Viaggio, especially after a not-so-stellar dinner the previous evening, as well as the fantastic reviews this place has gotten thus far. Getting a reservation was no problem, and I even noted that if you mention 'Yelp', you can score a free appetizer with the purchase of 2 entrees. Yahoo! After reading all the raves about the Rigatoni with Sunday pork gravy and the fact that my friend was carb loading for a run the following day, this was one dish we knew we couldn't fail to order. The server came over, gave us menus, and went over the specials for the evening. This is when I had to be kind of douchey and mention the free appetizer offer. I hate doing that; but in the name of free food, one has to shame one's self occasionally. The menu is a bit overwhelming. A lot of places let you order half sizes of pasta, but there was no mention of this on the menu and it impeded ordering the rest of our selections. We weren't really sure what appetizer we were to be given as our ""freebie"", so after asking our server, we were told it was a choice between the calamari or the meatball salad. Since we would be ordering meatballs with our pasta, it only made sense to go with the calamari. We ordered that and went about perusing the rest of the menu. I'm glad we asked our server about half portions. He seemed hesitant but said they could do it but also reminded us that we had to order two entrees to receive the free appetizer. Clearly he hadn't met the two girls with big appetites before. We only asked about the half sizes so we could augment our already huge order. The calamari came and I was surprised it came with sauce liberally poured all over it. My fault - I should have read the menu description more carefully. I love fried calamari, but the sauce definitely belonged on the side as it made the calamari lose all its crispness. It was still good, although a couple of pieces were chewier than I'd like. We finally narrowed down our choices for our main courses: spaghetti and meatballs for my friend, eggplant parmagiana for me, as well as the half-order of the much-lauded rigatoni. The food arrived and it was just an obscene amount of food. Even for us. It was all very good. Not the best I've had, but certainly tasty. I like their marinara sauce and that it was nice and chunky with tomatoes. It had really good flavor. The meatballs were take-it-or-leave-it for me, and my friend concurred. I didn't care for their texture; too many breadcrumbs, which made them a tad bland. My eggplant was as good as any I've had, but I thought the side of pasta that came with it was entirely too rich - it was cheese tortellini in an alfredo sauce. Way too heavy; I'd have preferred a simple side of penne with marinara; it just overwhelmed the dish for me. The rigatoni was good but neither of us was expecting such big chunks of pork in the sauce. I expected it to be cooked with pork for flavor, but to have so many stringy pieces in there sort of killed it for me. I was told by Dan G that their desserts weren't anything too splurgeworthy, and we were quite full and didn't save room anyway, so I can't comment on their after-dinner offerings. I wasn't blown away, but maybe I just didn't order the right thing, so I will go back another time and try other things.",0.9951,0.79,0.147,0.064,0.57328089569161

Both were delicious!  Obviously, the carbonara is extremely decadent, but this dish had so much more stuff in it than usual.  The chicken marsala was amazing...two chicken breasts with plenty of mushroom-filled marsala sauce.  The dish was served with steamed green beans and whipped potatoes.  Needless to say, the servings were huge and we both had plenty of leftovers to take home.  We ended the meal sharing a tiramisu (and we still had a few bites left to take home!) and each had a cappuccino.

We sat down and right off the bat they served us warm italian bread with sauteed peppers in olive oil.  It was truly delicious.  We then had the famous meatball salad, which may sound a like odd, but is absolutely amazing.  That could have been my entire meal, but I couldn't pass up on their pasta.   When it came down to ordering I had a hard time deciding between a pasta dish with scallops in garlic olive oil or a shrimp pasta dish with red sauce.  I asked our waiter his opinion and he said both were really good it just depended on what I felt like.  Eventually he ended up making the executive decision for me by saying, ""You'll get the red sauce"".  He didn't steer me wrong.  The pasta was cooked to al dente perfection and the sauce...oh the sauce.  I'll be dreaming of it.  Truly is one of my favorite dishes - it was amazing! As if we weren't already full from the fantastic starters and entree, a meal wouldn't be complete without desert.  I'm normally not a chocolate person, but their flourless chocolate cake was sheer perfection.  Not too sweet, not too rich and just the right portion size.  I usually don't take more than 2 or 3 bites out of a piece of chocolate cake, but if I'm able to eat half without blinking then I know it's good. I can't wait to go back....dreaming of that shrimp pasta dish right now.",0.9969,0.783,0.199,0.018,0.4878517316017316

2010-02-16,4.0,"Great Italian food.  Went here with my fiance and another couple the night before Valentine's Day.  We had a reservation at 9pm and the restaurant was fairly crowded when we arrived, however, they had our table ready for us.  This is a big plus in my book (I never understand when you make a reservation, get to the restaurant, and have to wait 30 minutes for your table still...). Our waiter, I believe his name was Michael, told us his uncle or cousin owned the place.  He was loud, friendly, funny, and very personable (some people may be put off by this level of attention but I was a fan).  Service was great and you really felt like this was a family-owned place. On to the food: they brought out some bread, which was fresh and had a good crust.  It came out with a plate of sweet peppers marinated in an Italian dressing or vinaigrette of sorts.  None of us were big fans of the peppers, but it wasn't a turnoff.  Michael brought us olive oil and Parmesan to make up for it.  We started off with an order of calamari.  It came out tossed in marinara sauce.  I personally like the sauce on the side so you get the crispiness of the fried calamari, but everyone at the table enjoyed the app, including me.  It just wasn't my favorite ever.   For the meals, my friend's fiance had the Sunday night rigatoni, which looked great.  She enjoyed it.  My friend and I both ordered one of the specials which was basically a pasta with a meat sauce but the meat was crumbled Italian sausage.  It had a slight kick to it.  We also both asked them to use this long fusilli-esque pasta and they accommodated no questions asked.  The dish was excellent.  My fiance had shrimp with spaghetti which was in a red sauce.  I usually don't like seafood pasta dishes, but this was excellent.  All of the pastas were great and HUGE!  Seriously, after I finished eating, I took looked at my dish and it looked like I hadn't even touched my food.  It was enough for 2 people to get stuffed off of.  I reheated it last night (two nights later) and it was still amazing and I didn't finish my leftovers.   After our entrees, we decided we were too stuffed for dessert.  By this time, the Blackhawks game had let out and there was a decent amount of fans in the restaurant.  This made it a little difficult to get a cab.  We ended up walking around for a bit before we caught one. Overall, I would recommend this place.  If you've ever been to La Scarola (another great Italian place), I'd say you'd like this place a lot as well.  It's a lot definitely less hectic than La Scarola, more welcoming, and the food is phenomenal.  There aren't many places I look forward to going back to (solely because there are so many places I want to try), but this is one of them.  If I'm ever looking for a good, filling, hearty Italian meal with great service, I'd go back to this place.",0.9988,0.783,0.198,0.018,0.46987179487179487

LOVED the fried eggplant appetizer, and of course the rigatoni with pork gravy was excellent! We didn't do dessert here, but the wine was great and the service was impeccable.  The half-star off was because on the night of the event, they had another party in the room we were supposed to have reserved, and it pushed our dinner back about 30 minutes. Inconvenient, sure, but our waiter was sharp and they moved at lightening speed when we were seated. The waiter also was adamant about making sure my vegetarian guests got the royal treatment.

I was there on a weekday afternoon and while it wasn't overly busy, it did seem really noisy which was moderately annoying because it was distracting when trying to have a conversation (which was my main focus - as the company I had far out shined the mediocre food on this particular afternoon).  The service was great, actually, much better than what I've come to expect from similar-type restaurants in this area. The server was patient and accommodating, which was remarkable because my companion and I were there for quite a long time and didn't have an extraordinarily large bill to warrant such patience from him.  The only complaint, really, was that the mushroom appetizer we ordered seemed incredibly greasy. To the point where it was almost inedible after a few bites because it tasted like pure oil.

2009-08-08,2.0,"I was compelled to sign up for Yelp just to add a different take on Viaggio than what is represented here. Full disclosure: I'm Italian by heritage; I cook Italian at home and I make my own pasta.  The supposedly-homemade pasta at Viaggio is comparable to the ""fresh made"" that you can buy frozen.  The linguine and spaghetti are Barilla (not a great brand). I gather ""Southern Italian"" is now restaurant code for ""Italo-American food in absurdly large portions, swimming in sweet tomato gravy.""  If that's what you're looking for, this place is OK (hence the two stars).  If you'd like thoughtfully and  freshly prepared Italian food, with the possibility of ordering contorni (sides) like rapini, mustard greens, or Tuscan beans, try Coco Pazzo or Piccolo Sogno instead.  The waiter was intrusively attentive, steered my husband away from changing the side on his dish (which my husband regretted), and squeezed our shoulders each time he visited us, to the point that I dreaded his approach.  While pouring wine, his crotch grazed my shoulder...twice.  Also, the place gets very loud when it fills up (7 - 7:30 PM). Here's what we ate, with our large party: 1) Bread: fluffy and lightweight -- not gutsy and flavorful as I like 2) Green Salad: drowning in Balsamic vinegar to the point of being  brown in color (I could not finish it, and I love vinegar) 3) Eggplant stack: the eggplant had clearly been fried earlier in the afternoon or evening -- cold and stiff 4) Fried Calamari: be forewarned that it has tomato sauce on it.  I prefer lightly battered, with a wedge of lemon 5) Chicken 'West Loop' and Veal 'West Loop' -- of the two, the chicken was better.  Heavy-handed on the sauce and ricotta, too light on the spinach and mushrooms.  The side was a mismatched, much-too-heavy tortellini alla pana (cream sauce).  Way, way too much food, not to mention calories and fat, so share it. 6) Ravioli and meatballs.  Acceptable for kids, but swimming in sauce; ravioli of a good frozen variety 7) Linguine with clams: disappointing sauce (not extra-virgin olive oil?); shell-free clams that I believe were previously frozen.  This dish was a needless loser. 8) Pasta with shrimp: decent sauce, frozen cooked shrimp 9) cappuccino: bad espresso.  C'mon guys.",0.8847,0.866,0.094,0.04,0.5471177944862156

The cuisine was good and our charismatic waiter Mike alerted us to their large portions and suggested that we split an app. No problem, we'll have the calamari. It was served lightly breaded and mixed with marinara and a touch of olive oil. It was excellent and different than typical stock preparations. I had the rigatoni with pork Sunday gravy and my wife had the scallops fra diavolo over black linguine. Both of these were solid dishes and had San Marzano tomato sauces that were very tasty.

Perhaps I would do away with the numerous flat-screen TVs (and there were three that stuck on the ""Godfather"" and ""Raging Bull"" DVD intro pages for the duration of our meal).

We brought out-of-town friends who wanted something casual and tasty. We read the Yelp reviews, and it lived up to expectations. Figuring that a restaurant is only as good as its most basic dish -- and craving a good meatball -- I ordered the ravioli and meatball dish. The sauce was rich, spicy and perfectly salted; I salt almost everything, and none extra was needed. The meatballs were moist and tasty, with a nice, little crust on the outside. Even a food novice would know they were homemade, too. Others got fish -- two salmon dishes and one swordfish. The salmon was flaky, moist and cooked perfectly with a slightly peppery crust. Well executed. It was garnished with nice fresh veg (spinach, cherry tomatoes, mashed potatoes, all seasoned well) and served as a tasty but light dish. My friend loved his swordfish, too.

2009-07-06,5.0,"Holy cannoli this place is incredible.  From the second we walked in, this was one of the best lunch experiences I've ever had.  We went there for a business lunch and we were the only ones there, which was surprising from the reviews they've received.  It is a good measure of a great restaurant when you're the only ones there and still receive exemplary service.  There is often the tendency to hover, but they did a flawless job.  Every single item that we ordered was perfect.  I don't mean good, I mean perfect.  We got the best calamari I've ever had.  It was fresh and seasoned incredibly with an unbelievably awesome marinara sauce.  We also got a roasted eggplant appetizer that was great.  I ordered the snapper, which they were out of, but they substituted it with swordfish and a side of fuscili pasta with vodka sauce.  Have I mentioned that they nailed every single thing on this menu?  The guys got all different foods (pastas w/ & w/o mb, bolognese sauce, etc...) and everybody just stopped talking while the food was there.  That never happens.  I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Yelpers.  I've been to dozens of Italian restaurants in Chicago and none of them have blown my mind, but this place did.  I am SO excited to go back as soon as I can. Verdict:  The best Italian food I've ever had and it has to be up there with the best in Chicago.",0.9971,0.721,0.253,0.026,0.5567857142857143
2009-07-01,5.0,"This place is terrific! I am pretty critical on Italian food, since I'm Italian, and it may be the best I've eaten in a restaurant. I was expecting ""good"" and got ""wow""!  We went last night, and I got the eggplant stack appetizer for my meal. It was perfectly cooked! And, I still had some to bring for lunch today. The guys had the ""West Loop"" style Milanese dishes, and the enormous plates of food were empty by the time they finished. Also the tortellini w/cream sauce that came on the side of their dishes was unbelievable - almost like mac and cheese, but way better! And the bread and peppers for the table was a really nice touch - and also delicious! This place is not for the calorie conscious, but it is ""real"" food, and it is fantastic.",0.9825,0.777,0.204,0.02,0.6508771929824562
2009-06-08,5.0,"Not kidding or exaggerating. 5 stars. The pasta was hearty and still steamy warm after I worked on it for about 15 minutes. I had the Sunday Gravy rigatoni, and it was awesome. Portions were more than enough to share for 2 people. Nice deco, but not super uppity. Met the owner. Really nice guy. I'm sure like me, living in Chicago there's alot of options for Italian cuisine.

The Sunday Gravy was very, very good. The portions were big enough to provide lunch for the wife and me the next day. The braised pork in the sauce was super-tender. The peppers served with the sauce were expertly roasted. The ricotta was a great touch served with the tomato sauce.

2009-03-23,5.0,"Viaggio is fantastic!  A large group of us (9 people) went here after a Hawks game.  The service is excellent; the waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the dishes and he and the bus boy kept our table clean without ever being intrusive.  The food itself was absolutely delicious.  From the appetizers to the unbelievably good cheesecake (coming from someone who normally dislikes cheescake) the food was top notch.   What really made Viaggio stand out though is the way they responded to a mistake they made. Two of our group have gluten allergies, which means no flour.  The waiter was able to tell us exactly which dishes were okay for them; unfortunately, he overlooked the fact that the plates are garnished with bread crumbs.  As a result, the dishes had to be completely remade because even something as small as a bread crumb will cause a reaction.  Not only was the waiter attentive about the mishap; he was extremely apologetic.  In addition to this, the restaurant gave us free desserts for the nine of us.  This included a complimentary dessert they brought out, and they didn't charge us for the two additional desserts we ordered.  Viaggio is a high-quality dining experience.  They know how important it is to please the customers, and they know exactly how to do it.  We will definitely be returning!",0.9741,0.814,0.142,0.044,0.6601428571428574
2008-12-25,4.0,"Great food, not like other Chicago Italian joints. Sauces or not over powering, not heavy but not to light, just right. I did not like the calimari because it was tossed with a red sauce but, it was tasty. I personally like plain crunchy fried calimari with sauce on the side. The ravioli was wonderful. The tossed salad was great and the mussels in red sauce were great. I will definitely go back soon.",0.9616,0.679,0.246,0.075,0.42984693877551017
2008-12-13,5.0,"I was originally a little disappointed to realize that Amore (formerly at this location) was no longer in business. We decided to try Viaggio, though, and I am SO glad we did! Simply put, everything is top notch! It's a very friendly place. Our waiter, Michael, was both charming and a good waiter.  Most importantly, the food! Oh, the food! I would describe it as Italian comfort food. Don't miss the eggplant stack appetizer--and the calamari was both different (had tomato gravy with it) and fantastic. The portions are HUGE, so four of us shared three entrees. The rigatoni with Sunday pork gravy was particularly outstanding. For dessert, we opted for carrot cake and sorbert (not together!)--both very good.  The location is great, too, for dinner before any event at the United Center.

2008-08-04,5.0,"This place just simply might have the tastiest Italian in the city!  Seriously. This little, unassuming place is casual, VERY friendly and just feels like a home-y Chicago Italian joint should feel.  The owners are walking around - the manager is bartending - and everyone generally knows everyone.  They said their food would blow me out of the water - and boy were they correct! First off, they don't just give you the traditional olive oil and balsamic for your bread - oh no.  They give you what they call 'sun-tanned' peppers, dredged in olive oil and red pepper flake.  Wow!  The taste of those peppers on the bread - amazing - and a wonderful way to begin our meal.   We then had this delicious salad with homemade meatballs.  The combination of warm, saucy meatballs with the cold crisp, vinegar-y salad was perfect.  Next up was the ""stacked eggplant"" salad.  Just get it - that's all I have to say - it's outstanding.   We ended with garlick-y shrimp pasta to share and veal cutlets with tomatoes and cheese (can't remember the name of the dish) -   AMAZING! This place truly is a diamond in the rough.  Head out to West Loop and try it out!  I have tried MANY MANY MANY Chicago Italian restaurants, and none this comfortable, with food this tasty.  My boyfriend and I decided we will probably need to go there for a once-weekly dinner together.",0.9912,0.792,0.181,0.027,0.5719812925170068
2008-06-19,5.0,"After a kick ass Yelp Elite bash at West Loop Studios and a few too many bellinis Gabi K and I were in dire need of some grub.  And boo on Westend for closing their kitchen after 10 PM! We asked the bouncer of Westend to point us in the direction of some food (very close- the feet were killing me!) and he pointed to the new Italian restaurant next door, but warned it was pricey. Whatever....prices weren't getting in the way of our growling stomachs! The oh so wise Gabi stated at dinner that sometimes you find a gem when you least expect it and that's exactly the case with Viaggio! The food and service were absolutely fabulous!! There aren't many choices on the menu, but everything looks delicious. We decided we wanted appetizers so I ordered some sort of meatball salad while Gabi opted for some fried eggplant dish. A few minutes later the very sweet and apologetic waiter came over to say they were out of meatballs. No biggie- I got tilapia (stuffed with shrimp- YUM!) instead.  Before bringing out the eggplant and the tilapia the waiter surprised us with calamari that he wanted us to try because it was so good. And he was right- this was some darn good calamari! By the time my tilapia arrived I was feeling pretty full from bread and calamari so I thought I'd only have a few bites, but it was so good that I couldn't help, but eat the whole thing! It also came with the most delicious mashed potatoes ever and I had to beg the waiter to take away the plate before I finished those too. As for Gabi...she was quite happy with her eggplant appetizer. We may have accidentally stumbled into Viaggio tonight, but I'll be making plans to go back real soon!",0.9928,0.788,0.159,0.053,0.5145086580086581
2008-06-19,5.0,"Wow... what a pleasant surprise!   We stumbled upon this restaurant after the Elite Event at West Loop Studios after we were told that the kitchen at the bar next door was closed.  I was with Andrea R and we were both pretty hungry since we'd only eaten a few bites of appetizers at the event.   The atmosphere at Viaggio was extremely warm and welcoming.  The hostess sat us right away and ice waters were brought out as well as a basket of warm, fresh bread and some grilled peppers in oil - delicious by the way! We inquired about getting the calamari appetizer grilled instead of fried and they said this was not possible because the breading was already on the calamari.  Oh well!  We went ahead and ordered an eggplant appetizer as well as an order of the meatballs with romaine salad.  Uh oh - the waiter came back to apologize but they were out of meatballs!  Andrea then ordered the tilapia instead. Next thing we knew we were served a complimentary Fried Eggplant Appetizer - wow... it was delicious!  It came mixed with a fresh tomato sauce... just enough spice and peppers were mixed into it.  I highly recommend it if you like calamari! I cleaned the plate that my eggplant stack came on... it was a huge portion too!  Eggplant stacked with fresh mozzarella, tomato, arugula, and the best balsamic ever!  Andrea's tilapia was not so bad either... i had a bite myself to make sure!  It came with mashed potatoes and some shrimp along with a tomato sauce.  I guess Viaggio likes tomato sauce since everything we tried had it! We were so full, we had to pass on dessert but when the waiter started telling us about the options, they sounded good.  It was after 10pm when we were there, and there were a few couples dining in the restaurant at the same time.  Service was friendly, attentive, and awesome.  I would return for sure! For a restaurant that's been open only since this past April, they are doing something right.  Go enjoy a meal at Viaggio with a friend, a date, or even solo... bon appetito!",0.998,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.5767692605497484
