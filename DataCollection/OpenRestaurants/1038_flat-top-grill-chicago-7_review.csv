We were hesitant as one member of our family is a very simple eater and is not a fan of any type of stir fry. He offered to make her anything she wanted so in we came. Our server Adam helped us all create our own stir fry with choosing our meat (or meat alternative for vegetarians, which are welcome here as well as anyone with food allergies), rice, noodles, veggies, and sauces. The staff really knows the best combos  and has great recommendations. Everyone enjoyed their stir-fry, the service, and the stylish atmosphere. Thanks Benjamin for getting us in the door, checking on us mid-meal, and Adam for giving us excellent wait service.

2017-08-26,4.0,"This place is a weird toss-up that combines choice foods across Asia onto one menu. I'm from Los Angeles, and this is a Midwest chain. It's basically a Mongolian BBQ grill but with roti bread, assorted protein (whitefish, scallops, andouille sausage, chicken, beef), and Asian sauces (coconut curry, pad thai, hoisin). You pick a protein (or do half and half), get a wooden stick with your name and protein order, and walk you, your stick, and your bowl over to the self serve station. You then pile your bowl with as much veg, carbs (rice noodle, egg noodle, brown rice, white rice, quinoa), and soy protein. You drench your food in 3-4 ladles of your choice sauce and then put some plastic sticks in your bowl depending on what you want.  I'd recommend 2 ladles of pad thai sauce and 1 ladle of peanut. It's sweet and compliments the food without overpowering it.  Pros: I get to pick what goes in my bowl, how much sauce, etc. which is great! Watermelon radish is a nice touch. I like that scallops and whitefish were protein options. The food was delicious.  Cons: Bowl isn't that big. It is seriously such a weird assortment of pan Asian foods that I'm hesitant to rate this place any higher than 4 stars. I looked at the menu like, is this what the Midwest thinks of Asian food??? That it's not distinct by countries (or even regions) and can just be thrown together to make a meal? The restaurant conjures up memories of watching people eat fried rice and noodles together, and makes me shudder a little bit. Otherwise the crowd here is more diverse than I've seen in the rest of downtown Chicago, so it's food for thought--literally.  Even though it's supposed to be a quick meal, the food took longer than expected (like 20 minutes are so).",0.9841,0.87,0.105,0.024,0.43263888888888896
2017-08-25,3.0,"Coworker and I came here for lunch. What I like: pick my protein, pick my veggies, pick a style (noodles, rice, in a taco, etc), pick my sauces all by myself with no judgement on my lack of veggies. You put your marked bowl on the table and the cook takes your creation and it is returned to your table. The warm buttery bread was the best!! If your food comes out dry, you can get more sauce. I had chicken and the portion was more than decent. They serve alcohol. Price is nice as well.  What I don't care for: the wait. Going in on a lunch hour along with everyone else will hurt your feelings! If the line to place your food on the table is long, no control whose gets on the grill when. It could take your entire lunch hour like the poor folks next to us who wound up taking it to go after shoveling two mouthfuls in. We happened to catch the tail end so we were lucky and I saw my bowl go on the grill. Still had to wait a decent amount of time but it was purely for cooking the chicken and not the jockeying for grill space. Tables are tight.  Overcrowding of people waiting for to go orders spilled throughout the place which makes it uncomfortable for everyone.",-0.3835,0.873,0.066,0.061,0.6093358395989975

I believe the bowl costs $13.99 each and if you wanted more, then it would $4.00 more for unlimited. So basically $13.99 for one serving, $17.99 for buffet style serving.   Here's how it works:  You get a a popsicle stick and you write your name on it.  Then you go to the buffet bar and fill up your bowl with veggies, protein, carbs, grains etc. I really liked the fact that they had quinoa and brown rice and 5-6 types of vegan ""meat/protein"". Then you pick your sauces and they had 10+ types of sauces.   For food quality, the taste is what you make of it, but all ingredients were fresh which is the only thing I can judge them on for food quality.  What I like is they let you sample the sauces as well so that you aren't shocked by the taste.   Verdict: This is a good place to go if you have people have dietary restrictions as you get to choose your food and those that don't can eat whatever they want.",0.9598,0.888,0.112,0.0,0.6714285714285714

I was thoroughly impressed (and surprised) by the wide selection of toppings they had to put into the stir fry. There was rice and noodles, tons of veggies, even stuff that you would more typically put into a salad. There is also a huge selection of sauces that you can pour into your bowl too! At the end, you can even add extra stuff you want in there, like tofu or eggs. I was very happy with my bowl of noodles that I got to make on my own. The only down side to all of this is that they give you a tiny little bowl to stuff all this food into! Then they serve it to you in an even bigger bowl when everything has already shrunk, I don't get it lol. I was on the struggle bus the whole time because my food was stacked so high that I didn't even have room to pour the sauce in! I had to ask for a separate bowl at the end for the sauce because it would've spilled everywhere. I wish they'd at least give us a plate instead because the bowl forces us to stack everything on top, making it messy. But I guess they're trying to prevent us from treating this place like a buffet lol. Apparently the lunch price is much more worth it than the dinner price~",0.95,0.856,0.108,0.036,0.5722649572649572
2017-06-12,1.0,"If you've ever been to a farm and watched animals being fed mashed up slop from a trough and thought, ""Gosh, I wish that was me,"" you will love this place.  First, the much-vaunted ""concept"" of the place is--for anybody who's just trying to get a meal--a big pain in the butt. Once more, how does this work? I go where and then where and put the stick in the bowl and take how much sauce and then the waiter will bring it or I pick it up? I don't want to think this much. Just feed me.  Second, on my visit the food was cooked with the skill and care you would expect if you could teach one of the great apes to work a grill. It arrived mashed, totally overcooked, tough, and unappetizing to look at. And it tasted terrible because the pad thai sauce somehow is white vinegar-based. I was sitting next to the grill, which allows you to watch your food being prepared. Do you think it's appetizing to see somebody take your chicken out of a 15-gallon transparent plastic bucket with an ice cream scoop and throw it down on the grill next to 27 other orders, assembly line style? Not a good arrangement. Don't let the customers see this, unless they are children. And the romance of the big dirty plastic bowl my food was served in was also lost on me.  Finally, the price. Fifteen with tax for a bowl with probably 6 oz of meat, a ladle of rice, and a cereal bowl of vegetables. And it tastes and looks like something from the dumpster. It would be overpriced at the lunch rate. All this and you have to serve yourself, my friend. This is the America we live in. The customer is lucky to get contempt. All I can say is it's fortunate there are a lot of out-of-town suckers who will blunder into this location, because if this place were dependent on repeat business, it would not be long for this world.

Some stuff has changed that makes me go, Ehhh. First is the price. It's gone up, which I don't really agree much with especially since I don't feel you get enough food for what you're paying for. Secondly is the fact that they don't like you pile your meats (and choices of meat) on your bowls, so you're getting less of it. You get 2 selections of meat now, and portions are controlled by the chefs. You can pay an extra $4 for double... but damn that's pricey. Tip: Be diligent on HOW you place your foods in your bowl. Make sure you put the round or small stuff on bottom and heavier larger stuff on top.  Tip: ALWAYS add the sticks at the end (tofu for extra meaty food, even if you got meat; bread, for a delicious side of bread; egg, for more protein and substance) Things I enjoyed: coconut curry sauce, and curry powder. mango, lots of it. and the waiter was excellent, super sweet and attentive!",0.9807,0.819,0.144,0.037,0.47314814814814815

I will preface by saying that my girlfriend has several food allergies which means going out to eat will require a little extra consideration when traveling.  After looking over the menu and looking at 5 other restaurants we settled here after seeing all of the measures they had taken to SPECIFICALLY MARK THE ITEMS that could cause their guests intestinal discomfort. KUDOS! They even had options to indicate/specify whether there was a request to cook food separately so as to avoid possible cross-contamination. Woot! We were fortunate enough to have Jose welcome us and acquaint us with the practices of the restaurant. Props to this server! My partner need only ask one question about the marinades possibly containing gluten for him to ask about her concerns regarding potential allergies. THANK YOU for showing her the attention and care to make sure that she felt confident in her decision-making process. Jose then walked us through the line AND procured a second menu to reference which sauces/sides she should avoid to be safe. This put her at ease and we were able to spend the rest of the evening focusing on each other instead of whether or not she was going to have to worry about her dinner. Thank you for making this evening possible as we closed a weekend of seminars in the city. We head back to Minneapolis and will be back in a few weeks. Rest assured, we will return again.

Both drinks were weak; the mint was wilted and they did not have much flavor.The drinks took a long time- I finally got up and asked where they were. The female bartending was having a conversation with a waiter and  had no sense of urgency and continued her conversation with him as our drinks sat in the stainless mixers..it was like that at the other location. drinks took forever. People like cocktails before they eat...I finally got up and asked my waiter if he had ordered our drinks.. I said nothing but my friend complained. I could feel the bristle in the manager as he tried to give us a lesson in drink tastes and that those flavors were choices of Rum in the drink- I have no idea what else was in it because it never told us on the menu... but only as my friend persisted did he offer to get a new drink for him and then me. I declined. He charged us for the drinks we had and added a third drink then removed it. I think the service friendly thing to do is either give two free ones or remove them from the bill. I hate when you complain and you can feel the negative vibes. In addition I had a reaction to the food. Not a good night for Flat Top grill.",-0.8942,0.81,0.08,0.11,0.49106060606060603
2017-02-09,4.0,"Service: 5 Decor: 3 Food: 4  Value: 5 Dinner with the Best bang for your buck? You've found it. $13.95 for dinner and I GUARANTEE you'll enjoy the meal and be full.   This place is similar to a Mongolian BBQ. If you're not familiar with Mongolian BBQ I'll explain it quickly. First there's a bowl. Then there is a food bar. Fill it up the bowl with carbs, (usually some kind of noodle or pasta), load up the bowl with veggies, mix in some sauces, lastly add in the protein. Give it to the cook and 5-7 min to walk it back to your table.   Here, however, it's done slightly different. Once your bowl is cooked is brought to your table.  Another thing that's different is the pricing. Usually Mongolian BBQ is an AYCE affair and there is a fixed price around $20-22. Here the starting price is $13.95 with 1 bowl with 1 choice of 8 oz meat or protein.  HOWEVER, it's only $4 total for the successive bowls. If you get to bowl 2,3,4,5 the price is only $4.  It's a cool concept because it helps with food waste, in my opinion, by serving one bowl of food. If you can handle some more is 1/3 the origin price for an unlimited amount food. A little confusing, I know. More often than not, I crush AYCE places, but today food won and I struggled to finish one bowl. So drop by this place when you have a chance, you won't regret it!",0.9175,0.864,0.099,0.037,0.474

My Friend and I stopped here maybe 12 times in 2016.  On the 5th time we were faced with a pretty icky situation. We booked a movie for 7p.m. we decided to sit down for dinner at 5p.m. This particular food isn't that time consuming. Upon receiving our orders we realized that we both asked for no beef. We got just that. We didn't complain as it waz about 5:40 we still has drinks coming out we were fine. We then realized out waiter hadn't stopped by our table for the roti bread or drink refills. We just assumed she was new and everything would work out fine. At 6:15 we were over it. Ready to go. But not without the breads we had been promised over 25 mins ago. We paid our check left a tip. And headed to the front where we stood in awe at all the bread sitting on the grill.. This beautiful older women walks past and asks ""hey you all. Hope di ner was alright. Would you all like a couple pieces of the bread?"" we were at this time very very excited. I offered this woman a $10 tip anx she very politely turned me away, until I insisted. It was like, bro this is what we came here for. This very ending is exactly what customer service is all about. Thank you so much thank you. Is how we ended our night. As we left i couldn't help but give the location a phone call. About the great service and the bad service. Not to mention we wrre30 mins late to our movie. But no matter during the phone call we were informed that that awsome young lady was the manager and she handled our situation with so much grace and poise that we ruturned at least 8 more times before 2016 ended..

2017-01-03,2.0,"Among the build-your-own stir-fry group of restaurants, I've had better.  And it had nothing really to do with the actual food.  On that level, this Flat Top Grill location was okay.  The ingredients seemed fresh and tasted good, and they had the expected variety of items you could put in your bowl.   Even though this concept is familiar to me, we were confused when we came in.  That is, once we eventually were seated.  We walked in on a Sunday night around 5:30pm and it was pretty active here, but certainly not what I'd call super busy.  There were lots of open tables.  We went unnoticed for several minutes before a manager-looking guy breezed by, asked if we had been greeted, then told us we would be helped momentarily when we replied ""No"".  He was courteous, just running around busy. Our host came and seated us a few minutes after that, then we sat waiting for longer than was comfortable before anyone came to tell us how the heck this place works or to take a drink order.  This is where I felt like it was confusing - we were uncertain, at this point, if we were supposed to just get up and help ourselves, or what.  You order your protein based on the menu, and the menu tells you what kind of things your protein and mix-in combination can be made into, but it's pretty confusing and cryptic how this all comes about until your server shows up with some empty bowls and THAT's when you take them up to fill with mix-ins.  You put your name on a stick and that goes along with your bowl, as well as your protein choice, so the grill guys make what you want.  Makes sense once it's explained to you, but sitting wondering what the F is going on for ten minutes was unsettling.  Especially because we were starving.  Once we got our food, my dining companion and I both found at least two or three items in our food that we had not placed there, meaning they found their way into our food at the grill while being cooked.  Luckily it's nothing we were allergic to - a stray piece of baby corn, a few kernels of loose corn, a few crispy stir fry noodles.  Still, the idea that the grill guys were slapping things around this loosely made us a little uneasy since my companion does have some food allergies. This experience was topped off by the inane and privileged conversation of the irritating college freshmen seated next to us, so we didn't have a great time.  Grumbling, we shoveled our food down and got out of there as quickly as possible. The roti bread is fricking awesome, though. And there's no extra charge for that (so far as I could tell), so definitely stick some of that in your bowl.  There is an up charge of $4 to make your bowls unlimited.  With this kind of place, unless you are experienced in its ways, a second bowl isn't a bad idea since you run the risk of not liking the combination you create.  Just my opinion.  I didn't care much for their set-up, though I respect their process.  I would rather do things the way they do at HuHot, for example.  Overall, not a place I'd go again unless under duress.",0.9893,0.808,0.126,0.066,0.5007631257631258
2016-12-19,4.0,"I chanced upon it as I was in the area. The method is like some Mongolian grille places I have been to before - you choose a protein of choice; then you go to an open counter and pile the bowl with your choice of carb(rice/noodles), veggies and sauce...then u stick in some colored sticks which denotes whether you want eggs/ tofu/ paratha etc, seasoning of choice - and leave it at the counter.

2016-11-09,4.0,"I went to the Taste of Chicago this summer to experience what Chicago had to offer among its culinary cuisine.  I should have come here first to start my adventure.  Maybe that would have been a bad idea as I would have ate at this place every day.  Yes looking from the outside at this place you are probably saying that it is a typical Mongolian grill setup but that is where you are wrong.  To say this place is the same as a Genghis Grill or any other like place is a dirty falsehood that hurts my ears.   A multitude of fresh ingredients and you are in a place with infinite possibilities.  This restaurant is basically just a place that happens to cook your food on a flat top.  I know some of you are saying no kidding Sherlock you just described all restaurants.  If it is your first time here as it was for me I do enjoy that the directions on how to order were written in multiple places on the wall and your menu.  Pay attention as this could make a difference between getting some tasty roti bread or not.  I made that mistake but the staff was very helpful in bringing some to the table.  On this day I thought I knew what I wanted but there is so much on the menu that the decision was a chore in itself.  Peer pressure kicked in as the waiter arrived and I went with a bowl with my meat choices being shrimp and Andouille sausage.  As if the large selection of protein choices was not enough you still have to choose what will accompany your meat.  That's if you decide to go with meat.  Another option is that instead of a bowl you can go with soup, roti tacos, or a wrap to put your selection in.  Once you drop your food off it is brought to you and then you can start your voyage to enjoying this meal.    Great place and if I was not driving I would have sample a selection off their drink menu.   Glad that I was put on to Flat Top Grill.  Very affordable prices for great food.",0.9731,0.818,0.12,0.062,0.4293040293040293

He even had the nerve to tell me, ""hey brother, sign the check for me would ya""? I was so in awe that I almost said something to the manager, however, I figured this review would be enough. Even as I'm writing this in the restaurant, I can see he's wondering why we're not leaving yet. He wasn't done for the evening as he was taking more tables as we were sitting there. This literally was only 5 minutes after we finished eating that he wanted us to leave!! I've never seen such an attitude from a waiter!! In addition to this, the host and the cooks barely spoke English and it was all we could do to understand and figure out how the process works. It was more of a Mongolian style where you put a plate of food together from a raw buffet bar, gather your sauces and then give it to the cook where they make it in front of you. However, this place didn't seem to understand anything I was asking in plain English!! It also wasn't a very smooth process. They make you leave the food and they bring it to you instead of letting you watch them make it, unlike most places of this nature. Also the decor was dark and such a confusing process from the moment we entered the place, even the layout of the restaurant was frustrating! The food was good, but not great! I didn't feel as if I'd want to go back again. It was really just ok. I've had so much better at other places and the fact that they could not communicate in clear English and we were treated so horribly by the waiter, this was enough to give it 2 stars.",-0.7964,0.9,0.041,0.059,0.46923382173382167

Additionally, they got rid of the filipino sausage and replaced it with androielle sausage - bummer.

I think initially this place started out as a Mongolian BBQ spot, but if you're indecisive like me or have no idea what you're doing you'll end up with a jumble of styles of food. I had originally been to a flat top grill in Old Town before it closed, but it seems like they do things differently at this location. For meats, you no longer pick and choose from the bar area but all of it is handled by the cooks in the back which means you preorder which meats you would like in your bowl. All you have to worry about is the assortment of veggies, rice, noodles, sauces, etc you would like to accompany your selected meats. MAKE SURE TO PILE THAT STUFF AS HIGH AS YOU CAN. GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH. After this you can choose to have it served as a burrito, roti tacos, veggie wraps, and additional assortment of styles. Hard to pin point what kind of food I'd even call this place but maybe Asian Mediterranean fusion?   Judging from my one pic I snapped while I was there, I'm still kind of scratching my head at what I had assembled last night. I remember beef, chicken, and sausage with noodles and potatoes an array of veggies and spices/sauces half of it assembled in roti tacos and the other half left as stir fry to consume. For $12, it's probably good for two meals, but some how I consumed all of it in one sitting. I think I was motivated not to have to carry around leftovers to the Sox game. For drinks, they slang some pretty fruity lookin' cocktails as relatively reasonable prices ($8~) and bottles of beer ($6~).

I went to Brightwok Kitchen weeks ago and while I liked their food, I didn't think it was worth the 4 dollars I paid. Here is why: 1) At Flat Top you get to pile on as many different kinds of veggies,fruits, noodles and some proteins.  I saw some because the only ones you can are the veggie based proteins as long as it fits in their tiny bowl. An if you are as skilled as I am, you can make your bowl huge.  You can pick what meat you want and while they used to let you pile on your own meat, it's not something to gripe about because they really do load up on the meat.  2) The quality is as great as Brightwok.  3) There are way more veggie options at Flat Top and way more sauces to choose from. You can even mix and match 4) For about 11 dollars, you get a portion that is twice the amount that brightwok offers. I have enugh to cover two lunches.  5) you can add tofu, egg, and roti by using sticks rather than it weighing it as part of your bowl make your protein intake massive.",0.9703,0.887,0.113,0.0,0.5163461538461538

I put my allergy aware stick in my bowl, like I always do, because my body freaks out every time I eat shellfish. This is supposed to mean that they cook my food in a separate wok to ensure that there is no cross-contamination between my food and other people's which may contain potential allergens.  My food came back, it was delicious as always. HOWEVER, maybe a half-hour after I finished my meal my intestines made it abundantly clear that I had eaten shellfish with a very specific type of pain that I only get when I have consumed it (or something contaminated with it). I was in pain and on the toilet for several hours. Now, I know that they were busier than they normally are that night, and that mistakes happen, but it was just lucky that I do not have an anaphylactic reaction to shellfish. I understand that it is harder to keep track of these things when they're busy, but in my opinion, it's not okay.

You then go over to the buffet with said bowl and load all of the veggie ingredients and sauces into the bowl.

This is a unique style restaurant where you pick your protein at the table, then choose vegetables and various ingredients from a buffet line, followed providing the bowl to the grill master for him to cook. As it cooks you return your table and your bowl will arrive once it is finished. All in all a simple process.  Overall, the atmosphere is festive and cool. The wait staff was polite and helpful. As far as imperfections, the drinks were quite slow initially. The proteins did get mixed up between two of the party, but I can't say that we verified the paper slip prior to turning the bowls over, and it didn't impact the taste terribly. They do offer kids meals with good sides for today's parents - celery and peanut butter, apple sauce, etc...  A unique quirk - their 'take home boxes' are simple, but attractive and functional in the trademark bowl shape.  Wrapping up with the most important area - taste. As you make it yourself, you are about the only one you can complain to as you designed the bowl. For the small group at our table - everyone was very satisfied and we ended up with most bowls empty at the end. With the substantial amount of ingredients and various recipes provided - it is very hard to go wrong and end up with something that you do not like.

Bathroom: a typical bathroom that continues the décor of the main restaurant, nice and clean Staff: My waiter left a bit to be desired as he was not very present after I started eating my main course. However, the cooks were great and my food was fantastic. Food: I started with edamame (it was pretty good) and then moved right to a build-my-own-bowl, which I loaded up.

Onto the not so impressive. Our waitress asked us if we had been before and we said yes but it had been a while so a refresher would be great. She didn't tell us that now you aren't able to go up for seconds/thirds for the same price (used to be $15) so we just assumed that hadn't changed. A friend of mine is vegan so she wanted to try small portions of different stirfrys since it was all included in the base price and didn't get tofu the first time around so she got a relatively small bowl.

2015-04-02,3.0,"I'm really sad that I need to drop this down, and don't let this be indicative of other Flat Top Grill locations. I still love the idea of filling up a bowl with tons of veggies, meats, and sauces and having a fresh hot bowl of chow customized to your liking. Unfortunately there have been changes implemented here (maybe because it's in the Loop so they have higher traffic) that put it below the bar especially compared to other locations of theirs. Before, you got a little bowl to pile your proteins into, and you were limited only by your ability to stack. It was great because they had a large variety of them so you could mix and match beef, pork, chicken, fish, squid, longganisa... No more here. Now you can only get up to three different ones, and if you want to ""double up"" on one of them, they'll charge you $4. Oof. They've also removed their hot and sour soup option which was pretty darn tasty and my girlfriend's favorite. And to top it off, our service last night was pretty lacking. You'd think at 8:30pm in the Loop you wouldn't have to be waiting around to get water/get the check/pay the check. I really hope this doesn't extend to other Flat Top locations, but looking on their website it seems that they're showing the same $4 upcharge and lack of soup options. It's a sad day, but for now I'm going to go to the West Loop one and hope for the best.",0.9292,0.815,0.123,0.062,0.5590828924162258
2015-04-02,3.0,"My friend and I were looking to try someplace new for lunch. She has a peanut/soy allergy so our first step was to see if they could be accommodating to that and they assured us they could be. Now I consider both of us to be very bright individuals, but the whole time here I was very confused. We sat down and our waiter asked us if it was our first time. We said yes....and from there on it felt like we were speaking a different language with the instructions we were given. I will apologize in advance, but this will be a lengthy review...   First we were given a stick and a pencil with our menu. We were told to write on the stick our names and up to 3 meats we would like to come with our meals. Simple enough I figured (I chose sausage, shrimp, calamari). Then we were given this huge explanation on how things worked. They come back to your table with a bowl and then you are set free to navigate the ridiculous array of sauces, veggies, rice/noodles and basically put the meal together yourself. We held on to our little bowls and gave each other reassuring looks that we got this.   So first stop we had to decide rice or noodles and then fix up your bowl with whatever condiments. I went with the brown rice, noodles, and added broccoli, mushrooms, onions. (There were seriously about 15 other items, but I tried to keep it simple). Then there are about 10 sauces to choose from. I went with the garlic black bean.   After that it's time to ""Transform your meal"" You go over to this area where you are met with another set of sticks to choose from. You can Transform and add to your creation. The transform sticks you can choose between having them change the items you have in the bowl into either a burrito, wrap, soup, roti taco, or stuffed sandwich. I went with the roti taco. Also you can choose from the other side of sticks to add to your creation tofu, eggs, cheese, or a white stick to mean you have some form of allergy.   Once your done with all that it's time to hand them your bowl so they can ""create"" your meal. By that point we were exhausted and went back to our tables praying we did somewhat well in choosing the right items. I also needed a drink by this point (I know it's lunch time...but I felt I worked hard enough for it ). I went with the FTG Punch...sweet and fruity and I couldn't taste the alcohol so I liked it. About 5 minutes later we get our creation and honestly we didn't do a bad job in our item selections. The problem to me is it tasted like something I could have ordered someplace else and had the chefs do all the work. I'm not big on specialization of my food and having to pick so many options, but if you are this is a great place to go.",0.992,0.846,0.117,0.037,0.49480002730002737

The resulting stir fry is pictured with this review. My complaint is that it is difficult to judge how much sauce is necessary. I am not a line cook or chef and would prefer to leave to the experts how much sauce should go on stir fry. There are no sauces on the tables. I understand the theory that you shouldn't need sauce on the table. In practice, all four of us needed to add soy sauce. The nice and prompt waiter brought it so there was no problem, but there really should be some soy sauce and salt on the table.  The wife did not like the roti bread. She said it was greasy and flavorless. I found it okay. She also warns that the vegetable pakora wasn't good. I didn't try it. If you like this kind of place, it meets expectations.

While the following information doesn't impact the rating in any capacity, you should know some changes the company has made. First, Flat Top Grill has changed their business model. The bowls you receive to add your food into seem smaller and you no longer add your own meat, instead you add a stick indicating the meat choice you'd like. Probably saves money from people overloading in the meat part. I get it. But that's not why this place got 2 stars. This place got 2 stars because the service was spectacularly awful. It was noon on a Saturday. Barely anyone was at the restaurant. Wait staff was everywhere. And despite all that, I had to wave down a waiter (not our waiter) twice to get a refill. And then I had to flag down the manager for the check. Ten minutes passed from the time we had visibly finished our meals until we got our check.

For example instead of going to the buffet area and get your meat, the waiter will ask you and then when your food arrive it will be already there. Is one of the best restaurant to go and eat, with one of the fastest service with food you will ever experience. The food in Flat Top is so good because you have the choice to prepare it all by yourself and put the amount of food that you like. The service is amazing the waiters are always attentive of what you need and with your food.  The quality of the ingredients has been one of the cleanest, and best set up to go and get your food. Know with the new set up of ""peak your meat"" has change I think is a healthier and cleaner environment for their customers. One of my favorite things to order is lettuce wrap is so delicious, healthy, and fresh. For example you create your own wrap with the delicious meat that comes with the delicious juice and salsa to make it even better.   One of the reason why I really enjoy going to Flat Top is their service toward their customers. Since you enter, while you are waiting for your food, and when you live the waiters are super attentive of what you need and want. Employee in Flat Top are so attentive that you have your beverage always fool and you are so comfortable that you don't want to live. Their attitude toward their client is always nice, positive and making sure everything is good with food and beverages. For example every time I see my beverage is running out of juice the waiter is already attentive to go and get me more juice, before asking.

Even when you do everything right though - and to be fair, there's plenty of reasons (i.e. you) for your food to be awful that is entirely out of the restaurant's control - the ingredients themselves just aren't exceptional. The noodles are overcooked and mushy. The rice is a better bet, but fried rice just isn't that exciting. The vegetables don't seem very fresh either.

2015-01-03,2.0,"The concept of Flat Top is great, but the implementation is way over-complicated, which leads to a sub-par dining experience. I left feeling frustrated, but not from one major issue but rather lots of little ones. Our experience wasn't all bad, but it was far from perfect. There are some really simple things they can do to vastly improve customer satisfaction. Pros: - Our server was very friendly - The new system of ordering the meats first sped up the process and our meals came back quickly, which was great. - The roti was delicious and the meats were cooked just right. - Deserts were delicious. Cons: - There were no ladels to help with measuring the sauces, and what's worse, there was absolutely no indication or help as to how much sauce was recommended. It was a big mess at the sauce counter, spills everywhere. - A related issue- it's very hard to balance out the amount of meat, sauce and veg unless you are a frequent diner, because you have no clue how much meat they'll give you. Some of our friends had overly wet dishes, mine was too dry, etc.  - The mu shu wraps were unavailable. We didn't find out until we were at the grill counter. The displays all around the restaurant hadn't been changed to show it. - Despite requesting a roti, it didn't come, and the servers also kept forgetting silverware for our group. - Some of us didn't fill our bowls very much on the first round, intending to go back for the $4 all you can eat. However, the server implied it was $4 per extra bowl, not all you can eat, so we didn't go back for more, which left us annoyed. The server may have been wrong, but we didn't know that. - The entire concept of Flat Top seems is that you choose what you want, how much, etc. I figure that with about 30 salads, 24 sauces, plus the sticks etc there are about 2^61 (a billion billion) possible combinations. Now, not all of those are going to taste right. Some people love this system. For me, it was mind-numbing. I was paralyzed with choice. It would vastly improve the service if they had signs or hand-out cards at the salad bar with maybe 10-20 suggested fillings and sauce combos. I saw about three suggestions on the menu, but didn't want those. This is not my first time at this kind of restaurant - I do understand the system. I just think it's poorly designed. Some simple things that Flat Top could do to make it a 5-star experience: - more suggested combinations. just have a rack of little hand-out cards or something at the front of the salad bar, organized by meat type. It stops indecisive newbies like me holding up the line and getting annoyed. - clear indications of how much sauce to take, and ladels to measure it out (!!). This makes the difference between a good or bad meal. - A more streamlined system for ordering.  Designing a meal in three separate steps is just annoying. This is the key issue, not the number of choices. Meat choices on the wood stick when you sit down, plus all the colored sticks later on, some that can be combined and others that can't...too complicated. They need to streamline the process and figure a way to combine things so that you make all your choices at once, if possible. When ordering meats, I couldn't see the list of sauces. Later, I'm in the salad line and I suddenly can't recall what my meat was. Most restaurants involve a single choice for your meal from a menu with 20 or so items on it, for good reason. There is such a thing as choice paralysis. It's going to subtly annoy a good fraction of your diners. You need to figure out a way to streamline things so the choices seem easier for those who aren't sure.

They're good at explaining how it works if it's your first time, but it's also useful going with friends who've bene before so they can tell you their own tricks of the trade. Here are some tips: - Stack even more in your main bowl but doing veggies first, then putting the noodles on top. The noodles act as kind of a net that holds everything in place. Then the sauce just soaks into it.  - Add PLENTY of sauce. Even if it seems like overkill, your bowl will taste really bland without enough sauce! I did about 4 scoopfuls (between the tomato, thai peanut, and a curry one. It was fantastic).  - MIX your sauces!

2014-12-03,5.0,"On November 4, 2014, I dined at the Flat Top Grill located at 30 S. Wabash in Chicago, Illinois. This location is accessible by public transportation, especially the CTA train system, because there is a stop right in front of the restaurant. I have been to multiple Flat Top Grill establishments all over the Chicagoland area, but I have not received any customer service that was comparable to the Wabash location. From the moment I walked into the restaurant to the moment I left, the service was incredible! When walking up the few stairs to get into the restaurant, the hostess was extremely inviting as she opened the door for my roommates and I. She introduced herself, and than proceeded to ask us where we preferred to be seated--in the back or closer to the front, which was nice because I have never been to a restaurant where you are asked where you want to sit. While walking to our table, I noticed how big the restaurant actually was. It was perfect size for any event, big or small, and even though it is located downtown, it did not seem crowded because of how big it was!  Once seated our waiter, Josh, quickly greeted us with just as much--or perhaps even more--enthusiasm than Jessica did. We were asked if we had ever dined at the restaurant before, and because someone had not, he explained how we got our food, and how it was prepared on a Mongolian grill. Once he was finished, Josh took our drink orders and left us to create our own stir-fry.  The first thing I noticed when walking up to the self serving station is that it was clean and organized; there were no left over pieces of food from customers prior to us, all of the utensils were lined up perfectly in their dishes, and there were clean cups to be used for testing the sauces. Josh met us at the station, and gave us excellent recommendations on what to put in our bowls, and how to create the perfect stir-fry. He encouraged us to try food that we normally did not eat, and to move out of our comfort zone! It was really helpful to have someone so educated about all of the different types of food that we could use. After our dinner was created and left at the grill, my party and I headed back to our table where our drinks were waiting for us.  While waiting for our food, I noticed that on the wall behind our table, were the instructions on how to create your own stir-fry, which was helpful for people who have never dined there before. I also noticed that the décor was very appealing. The light fixtures were beautifully designed, and gave off a warm, welcoming feeling. The music was loud enough to be heard, but quiet enough so that one person could have conversation with another person while dining.  The entire atmosphere was great! Our food was served to us in a timely fashion, and was very hot since it came right off the grill just seconds before! Since it is create your own stir-fry, everyone at our table had a variety of food in their bowls. The food was cooked to perfection, and presented beautifully. Once we were finished, we got our leftovers packed to go, and our check was promptly brought to us.  My overall experience at Flat Top Grill was amazing. From the helpful staff, to the amazing food, everything was perfect. I encourage everyone to dine at the Flat Top Grill on Wabash.

My server was the only person working, so it seemed, and I needed to check out for about 10-15 minutes but I did not see him. I tried to give him benefit of the doubt because if it was that he was the only person left on the floor, then I know that can be rough when it starts to get busy. Once he came to our table, I said I was ready to pay and as I was proceeding to tell him that I am a student he was like power walking away. Once he came back with the bill I had my student i.d. out and my credit card in hand, and explained that I needed my student discount. He rolled his eyes didn't take my credit card and walked away. When he came back he said ""make sure you tell me next time that you are a student before I get your bill"". I've been in the service industry so I understand that there may be this notion that students may not tip well, but the bottom line is that I was in the industry and know how to reward good service. I honestly felt like my server presumed that I wasn't going to tip well so he didn't feel a need to try to provide good service. He was so rude that I don't think that I will ever be back during lunch time and for anyone who does decide to come for lunch make sure it is around noon because once the busier lunch crowd dies down service begins to diminish.",0.9905,0.784,0.163,0.053,0.4675925925925926
2014-09-06,3.0,I must admit I was a late-comer to the Flat Top Grill game but I do love me some from time to time. For the low price of $13 you get a heaping serving of meat with vegetables and rice/noodles ... and the sauces! You must get the sauces! I like being able to walk into a sit-down restaurant and have a fairly clean and healthy (depending on how many sauces you get!) meal at suburb prices! Great mid-week option when you're lazy to cook and want an easy option where there's something for everyone. The service isn't the greatest as they tend to forget things and are usually absent for most of your meal so if you need hot sauce or a Coke or something make sure you order all that at once in the beginning! Also the add-ons at the end of the line where you turn in your dish are worth checking out before you begin as there are some great options.,0.9837,0.719,0.216,0.066,0.5880116959064327

The food line was clean, everything was filled and at a place like this, it's your own fault if you don't like your meal....for the most part.  Now, on to my experience. My friend and I went here for lunch this afternoon, it was later in the day, around 2:00pm, so it wasn't overly crowded. The hostess sat us down at a high top and asked us if we have been there before. We have. Our server came, and at first we thought he was nice. He took our drink order and said we could go ahead and start.  My friend and I made our bowls, she is gluten free, so she loves places like this. I got the mushu wraps and 2 roti breads. When we went back to our table, our drinks still weren't there... fine, no big deal. A little while later, our server finally brought out our drinks. We knew our food would take longer because hers is cooked in a wok and mine have to be wrapped up into delicious little burritos.  A food runner brought our food out and no roti bread. Our drinks were near empty and there was no sign of our server.  We continued on, cautiously sipping away expecting our server to show up at any moment to ask how our meal was or to refill our drinks. After about 15 minutes, he finally arrives. I ask for some roti bread as they had forgotten and refills on our drinks. He quickly ran from the table. 5 more minutes go by and the manager brings by the bread. We ask her for our drinks and she said she would have them out right away. Never happened.  We were abandoned. Left to deal with a liquid-less lunch. Another 10 minutes go by and our server magically appears, we ask for a third time for our drinks to where he pulls out a pitcher and just fills our now empty cups with water... we didn't have water, we had a lemonade... and he rushes off into oblivion before we could make a sound.  At this point we are just annoyed and want to get out of there. Our bowls are empty and our water almost gone. What seemed like forever, our server appears with the check. I give him my card and again, not to be seen for another 15 minutes! Now I would understand if they were busy or if it was during a lunch rush, but it wasn't. There was no excuse for this server to keep playing this disappearing act. Sadly, it ruined it for me.

Nothing really asian about it despite the mongolian barbecue format but inviting nevertheless.  Primarily a 20-something crowd. Came around noon with a party of ten which they are not set up for.  They took a reservation.  We were seated quickly at two separate tables though the tables are close enough together that it wasn't too bad but the physical separation does physically and psychologically split the group so you end up with two parties.  I had to work at engaging everyone.  On the plus side the background noise was not bad and you actually could converse with the next table.  The waiter could not speak intelligibly but was adequate since we really didn't need to rely on him to take an order.  Layout was cramped and circuitous making it hard not to run into people and causing heavy back-up at the vegetable/meat bars.  One member of our party did not get his food until the rest of us were nearly finished (they should have comped him, no real customer service).  It's just ""lunchy"" enough that I would not come here for dinner.  Two stars thus far.  Ok enough of that. The food: super solidly OK.  The selection at the vegetable and meat bar was varied and appeared and tasted fresh though the broccoli was pushing it.  For the $10 lunch price tag you get one run through the line (for another $4 you can get AYCE; pretty pricey for lunch).  The bowls however allow you to amass healthy portions of rice, noodles, vegetables, meats, and sea food.  Though all the food is cooked on the flat top grill, you can choose how the entree is plated (e.g., traditional stir fry, hot and sour soup, vegetable soup, or wrap but everything comes in a bowl). For the soup, your stuff is cooked then the broth is poured over the top of your bowl.  I had the vegetable soup over a bed of rice noodles, a variety of veggies, chicken, and octopus.  All the sauces are basically salt/sodium and some different colored liquids.  All processed.  I cannot say the food was bad nor was it anything that you couldn't fix at home after work and probably do better using fresh ingredients. Super solidly OK but have to go with the two stars given the price.  You work too hard for your money.  Get better for it--the pleasant decor does nothing for the food.",0.9977,0.797,0.186,0.018,0.47727513227513235

You can end up waiting an age to be seated and another waiting for your food to come. If you see the restaurant packed, turn around and go somewhere else. Regarding 2), first timers may have experiences ranging from fantastic to dreadful. There are lots of vegetables, meats and sauces to choose from, as well as different preparation options. If you choose poorly, you can end up with an awful concoction. And you have no one to blame but yourself. Here are some tips to ensure you have a good experience: 1) Stick with ingredients you know and like. 2) The sauces can taste different cooked, so don't be put off by their strong flavors. In fact, I recommend you use at least four spoonfuls of sauce. I go with six. 3) Get the roti bread! 4) If you're unsure of how your plate is going to taste, go with smaller portions and try different plates.

Usually restaurants give you crappy coupons, but Flat Top gives you awesome ones, like free appetizers and a free meal on your birthday! I recommend this to everyone! Great for groups as well. There is only one issue I have, but it is pretty minor: Seating. Some of the tables are so close to one another and it doesn't feel that private.",0.9917,0.693,0.284,0.023,0.7263157894736842

This place can be great or it can be a total nightmare depending on how good you are at pairing ingredients.  Cons: The recipe board is of little help, I personally don't like the concept of scoops of raw meat.  The food station tends to get pretty messy which is frustrating and you never know what kind of service to expect. Pros: The parathas are delicious and I believe unlimited, they offer a student discount and if you put an allergy stick into your bowl they will cook it in a wok instead of on the flattop.

Despite what the name may suggest (mostly to immature guys like me), people of all shapes and sizes are welcome here.  Food: Selection is ridiculous. Tons of veggies, brown & white rice, two different noodles, crazy variety of sauces, lots of real meat, plenty of fake meats. They recently added quinoa. And they're very accommodating to dietary restrictions (lots of vegan options, sauces are clearly marked with allergy info, and they (claim to) prepare food in a way that doesn't mix potential allergens. Service: I have usually had friendly and prompt service. Occasionally they are swamped, so the food takes longer to prepare and serve. Value: Ranks up there with Chipotle. In other words, (quality + quantity) / price is really high. Also, lunch is slightly cheaper than dinner (you also get a slightly smaller bowl for lunch).  --Pro tip1: If you like a lot of sauce in your creation, you should fill up the main bowl halfway with veggies, add some sauce, add some more veggies, then some more sauce. --Pro tip2: To maximize value, stack contents in such a way that stable/squeezable items are at the bottom and more rigid items are on top. For example, brown rice and greens should go at the bottom, while peppers and broccoli should should go on the top. And beans should go on at the end because they can squeeze into the nooks and crannies created by rigid veggies.

It was a Sunday afternoon/night about dinner time so the wait wasn't too bad about a half hour wait or so. Half our party had been to Flat Top before, the other half had never been. Our server was lackadaisical. His section was about the size of my living room, so you would figure that the 5 table section (with only 3 actual tables in it) wouldn't be too much of a problem. WRONG! He went to the one table, then to the back, then to the other, then to the kitchen, and THEN to our table. We ordered sodas/h2o's and I said I would probably order a drink with my meal. He brought our drinks back and then explained how the whole make your own bowl thing worked.  We went up and made our bowls and got our meals rather quickly. Quickly as in all the sudden this dude turned into Speedy Gonzales. He was already halfway to the back again before we could tell him we didn't have one table setting, get any type of refill or for me to order my drink. There was no ""is there anything I could get you? How's it look?"" yada yada...  We got his attention to ask for the silverware and napkins and then Zoom - the road runner took off again. Now I'm not trying to be a jerk, but he seemed to have all the time in the world for his other tables - laughing and joking with them - but we apparently had the plague. The place didn't seem to be too busy, and you would assume since his section, again, was the size of a rich person's bathroom he could do a full circle check of his whole section before running to get whatever he needed from the back.  When half of us went back for seconds the girl told us we were supposed to get another bowl from our server (well, if the Flash would slow down for a half of second to TALK to us...!)

Although they weren't memorable experiences, I can't lie and say they were bad ones at all. However, my opinion has completely changed after my last trip this past Saturday for lunch. To be clear I went to the one downtown on Wabash. You would think the expansion of the item bar would make for a better experience. It didn't! I remember in the past there were recipe cards guiding you on how to make a pretty decent dish. Apparently the marketing geniuses thought they were a bad idea. Or maybe our server was new and didn't know where to find them when we asked for a couple. He said they don't have them anymore. They did have a couple of recipes on the menu, but nothing special. Although our server wasn't too bad the service overall was slow and, at times, rude. When we walked in the hostess acknowledged us but proceeded to seat people who came in after us first. Then my cousin asked the waitress if we should seat ourselves, to which she responded ""your hostess will seat you"" like a robot. When we did get seated it was not by our hostess but another waitress who wasn't even assigned to our section. The gentlemen who was collecting dirty plates hadn't been around for a while, therefore I put my plate on the empty table next to me so I can make space for my next serving in what was already confined area. When he did come by he gave me attitude saying not to put my plate on the table.  The food took an awfully long time. I can't be mad at the cooks as there were only two. However, the place wasn't very busy. As far as the food goes, it was bunk to say the least, but considering you're responsible for your own ingredients I'll take most of the blame on this. But I can't take blame for the quality of the food. Very low end. All in all the place just seemed poorly managed. I wouldn't go back unless someone dared me and if I did go back it wouldn't be the downtown location.

Also, try putting the spices on the end on your meat rather than your noodles/veggies. I put garlic on my chicken to enhance the flavor. A spoonful of garlic on my other bowl would just get lost in the flavors. Not sure about sauce? Put more than you think. On my packed and filled bowls, I'll put 6 ladles of sauce on, and sometimes I end up wishing there was more like 7-8 ladles.

The cooking sauces have something for every taste like hot, sweet and savory tastes like ""Red thai curry"", ""Sweet & Sour"" or ""Indian"" etc. Its quite fun mixing different sauces to have new results as you eat yourself through the buffé.  You pay something like 12 $ for one bowl of 15 $ to have unlimited bowls of food.  Eveything is soooo good and fresh and the service was so fast and by nice waiters that we went here two more times on our vacation.  When turning in the food to the chefs you can also choose to have the food be turned into a soup or served as a wrap in a bread. You can also add shrimps for an additional 2-3 $.  This place is fun, cheap and they have loads of great food for everyone. Dont miss it!",0.9899,0.815,0.173,0.012,0.5180735930735929

It a fun experience. One caveat... There are a lot of people and hence a lot of bowls of food that can be confusing for the chefs. About twice a day someone gets the wrong dish served back to them. I was one of the two the day I was there. Our server Anna was super and took care of the situation immediately. I had to recreate my dish, but as soon as I was ready the chefs pushed my order to the top of the queue, and got my meal out right away, The manager even no charged my meal, which wasn't necessary but a stand up gesture.

2013-05-14,2.0,"While I love the food at Flat Top Grill, I will not be returning to this particular location again. My fiance and I came here on a weekend. Not originally being from Chicago, we didn't think to make reservations and had to put our names on a list. We were told there would be a little bit of a wait (about 30 minutes). We sat in the two chairs they have on the side and started our wait. There were a few other people, also, waiting and they all got seated. Then, people kept walking in and getting seated right away. Being naive, we watched about 25 groups walk in and get seated before us (we thought maybe they had all been smart enough to make reservations. After an hour, my fiance went to the hostess and told her we had been waiting a while and asked about how much longer the wait would be. She didn't ask for a name, just told him to sit back down and we would get to him. Well an hour and a half later I went over and politely told her we had been waiting for an hour and a half, could she just check where we were on the list. It turns out they had thrown out the list we were on AN HOUR AGO because they thought everyone had been sat. They quickly got us seated at one of the many two person tables that were open, and the manager came over to apologize. He was very nice and said we could have 15% off our meal. I saw the manager go to our waiter and tell him to make sure we got good service because we had been waiting so long. Even after being told that we had been waiting a while it took our server 20 minutes to bring out our waters and he was very inattentive. He didn't take the 15% off our bill and when we mentioned that we were supposed to have gotten a discount he made sure we knew what a hassle it was for him to go and change it.

2013-04-15,4.0,"The Flat Top on Wabash is the easy go-to place I enjoy going with friends for dinner. There will be a bit of a wait on weekend nights in particular, so I recommend putting in a reservation ahead of time. Or, there is always the option to put down your name, leave your phone number, and do some shopping or get drinks ahead of time while waiting for the call that your table is ready. If you're meeting a group of people here, know that half of your party must be present to get your table at your reserved time. Even if a few people are a few minutes late, you'll lose the table.  Here's the procedure: You get seated, you are greeted by your waiter or waitress, and order drinks if you want them. Next, you're instructed to get in line by the ingredient bar, where you can select exactly what you want in your bowl. Be sure to bring a stick from your table, which will have your table number on it so your food can be delivered after it has been cooked. So, you go to the line and fill your bowl with anything to your heart's desire. You can choose noodles or rice (white or brown), but of course you can mix and match. There are lots and lots of veggie options, meat, tofu, and tons of different sauces. I have tried a bunch of different sauce combinations and amounts, and everything tastes more or less the same to me: good! Then, you walk over to the stir fry area where you can add extra sticks for eggs, shrimp, allergies (so your food isn't cooked with the same pan as others') and bread (you MUST, MUST, MUST get the bread). Sit tight and your meals will be brought to you shortly.  I really like Flat Top because I know *exactly* what I'm going to get and I like it. I guarantee that you will have MORE than enough food to satisfy your appetite. We have never been able to save room for dessert! Even though my server told me I couldn't have leftovers a few years ago, a kind waitress more recently told me I could bring mine home. Score! Note: I've never ordered a drink here, but my friends have multiple times and they have never liked what they ordered. Even after asking to have them re-made once, they did not always taste quite right.",0.9922,0.853,0.133,0.014,0.35831298331298334
2013-04-05,2.0,"Met a friend here for dinner last night and I just wasn't impressed. The food was fine. The service and experience left something to be desired. First, we were seated right by the bus boy's station (literally our table was touching it) which lead to servers rushing back and forth and banging the cabinet open throughout the course of our meal. Our server came to bring us glasses of water and then disappeared. I wanted to order a beer and possibly an appetizer, but she didn't return until well after our food had been brought to us. After about 15 min of waiting for our server to return, we eventually realized that we were supposed to get up and get our own bowls, so we wandered to the salad bar style area where you form your creation.  Maybe it's just me, but I found the raw meat laying out on ice for people to pick through slightly unsanitary. While the meat section was separate from the vegetables, people are free to add meet to their bowls and then turn around and add vegetables with the tongs probably touching the raw meat. I decided to put my slightly OCD tendencies when it comes to the preparation of raw food aside and continued to the grill where they cook the food for you. Again it wasn't really clear that we could just leave our bowls there, which left us waiting for another 15 min until the chef came and took our bowls from us.  When our food came, it was pretty good and there was lots of it. As whole, it was just not my favorite dining experience and I don't feel the need to return to this spot.

2013-01-21,4.0,"My boyfriend is obsessed with this place. I am a little less enthusiastic (though it's still a really solid meal option), so 4 stars. First of all, the ingredient selection. There's a ton of available fresh veggies and sauces, as well as a pretty good mix of meatless/vegan options. All the veggies and noodles go into one dish, while the meats go into a smaller bowl.  I don't know what it is about the meat section, but I always find it a little off-putting. Maybe it's the often-sticky handle of the chicken ladle, or the fact that mounds of raw meat in a bucket usually don't look that appetizing. (Unless it's sushi. That looks good anywhere.) I don't know what it is. Either way, the meat seems fresh and tasty enough and the sticky handle problem can be solved with a quick trip to the restroom. Finding a good sauce combination is a bit of a hit-or-miss, since all the sauces seem to have their own very distinctive flavor profiles that can clash if you're not careful. Usually the flavors meld together fine, but once in a while there's a feeling of ""oh I really shouldn't have put that horseradish sauce with Korean BBQ."" The roti here is delicious, and I always put a roti ""stick"" in my bowl. There are about 10 colorful sticks that you can put in your veggie bowl, which tells the chefs any extras you want to put into your stir fry. Some options, like shrimp, cost extra, but most (like eggs, tofu, and roti) are free.  Lesson I learned: sticking 2 roti sticks into your bowl will not get you 2 pieces of roti. Darn. But you can always ask your server for extra roti. The portions are really generous, especially for the price. I pile up my veggie and meat bowls, and with the eggs, tofu, and roti, usually find myself unable to finish my first bowl. I don't feel terrible about myself afterwards either, since it seems relatively healthy. I highly recommend one of the appetizers here. I can't recall the name, but it's roti filled with meat and onions, and is served with two different sauces. Service here is pretty solid--friendly waiters and regular water refills. The one time our server forgot to put in our appetizer order, we got it comped, which we appreciated.

2013-01-02,5.0,"I was really impressed by this place, although maybe I should first say I am an unapologetic fan of ""Monogolian grill"" style chains. This one really really has it figured out.  I was impressed with the selection of vegetarian and vegan proteins and how easy it was to see what sauces were vegetarian and vegan. It was labeled well, available on the website, and the server was knowledgeable about it. It's maybe not obvious on the website, but they have tofu as well.  If you do want meat, you put it in a separate smaller bowl. I'm assuming this is to prevent the possibly astronomical expensive of people putting nothing but the most expensive ingredient in their bowls, but the positive is that you don't have to worry that you'll put too much of one appealing veggie in your bowl and suddenly not have any room for meat.   I'd never been to one of these places where you don't have to sit there waiting while they stir fry it, so overall I was very impressed with the service.  The roti bread is really delicious.     I also love the deal that you can pack up and take home your leftovers for just $4.59 more on top of the cost of all you can eat. In fact, you can just make another bowl and tell them you'd like it to go and it'll come to you already boxed up.

You can get 1 bowl or do unlimited bowls.  Then the fun begins.  You go through a line at a buffet-like table. You can choose rice or noodles, add every kind of veggie you can imagine, put a few scoops of sauce on top [there are so many choices!], and then fill a separate bowl with your choice of meat. They have chicken, beef, pork, fish, calamari, and a few vegetarian ""meat"" options as well--including one's I've never seen before. Next, you bring your creation to the counter next to the grill. You can put different colored plastic sticks in it for different options: add a shrimp skewer, make it a soup, add egg, add bread, make it a lettuce wrap, make it mu-shu. Side note: ALWAYS get the bread. It's so good. I could order a plate full of just the bread. Then you go back to your seat and wait. We got a seat in front of the grille, so we got to see all of the action. It's a huge flat top grill, and 2 chefs work around it like machines. They work in a circle around the grille, and cook each order. It's amazing to watch. And everything tastes good. I opted for rice noodles in both my bowls, various veggies, and the white fish. Yum. Hot red chili sauce in one. and Pad thai sauce in the second. Both were great. I love the food here. The other great thing, other than offering vegetarian/vegan options, is they have a huge list of what you can and can't eat for various allergies: gluten, garlic, egg, soy, peanuts, dairy, sugar, salt. There's something for everyone to eat. Don't opt for the unlimited bowls unless you can eat 3 or 4 of them.

There's more than chicken, beef, and pork for the meat selection -my favorites are the white fish and the Filipino Sausage, for hygiene reasons and to keep from getting sick, I suggest that once when you are done in the meat section you should wash your hands.

2012-07-15,2.0,"I like the concept--pick your own ingredients & seasonings. There was a restaurant in Evanston before Flat Top that did it really well. Flat Top has gone from reasonably good copy to unimpressive at best.  General issues first:  1. They offer various options for people with food allergies/intolerances. They used to have a list that gave the ingredients of all the sauces, allowing people to make informed choices. Now they just give a list saying, ""if you're allergic to this, avoid x, y, and z."" This could be acceptable, but that their corporate office clearly has no clue about what contains gluten. Sriracha sauce, for instance, on their list of things to avoid, is actually gluten-free. All I can think is someone told them the myth that vinegar isn't gluten-free and, rather than checking into it, they just believed it and labeled all vinegar-containing sauces off-limits. They could use gluten-free soy sauce, or offer it as a stand-alone, but don't. 2. The volume of the music is unbearable. Has no one ever considered that it should be a background to dining, not so loud that you can't hear yourself think? 3. Light. There was none. I could barely see the table, let alone my food. Specific issues: 1. Poor labeling on the food line. Bamboo shoots were labeled as edamame. Other things were also mislabeled, but that's the one that stuck with me. 2. Cooking was _slow_. Much slower than I've experienced at the Evanston location. 3. I put an allergy stick in my bowl. I didn't put a pancake or roti stick in my bowl. My food came to the table with one or the other of those (I'm really not sure which it was, because it was so dark). When I pointed out that I hadn't asked for it, and confirmed with the person (manager? not my server) who brought my food that I'm gluten-free, he was at a complete loss what to do. The first words out of his mouth should have been ""I'm sorry. Would you care to prepare a new bowl?"" Instead, he just fumbled. I finally told him it would be sufficient to remove it (since it wasn't cooked in). 4. The food is bland. Even the spicy sauces are now bland. The flavored waters (about the only sauces corporate deems gluten-free) have no flavor. The fat -free spicy basil lime has no spice, nor other discernible flavor. What the Loop location has going for it is being open on a Sunday evening. If you have a choice, I suggest you go elsewhere.",-0.878,0.864,0.056,0.08,0.5015410515410516

The food is just simply not worth that price, and I personally left feeling like I was about to give birth to a baby. Lunch is much more reasonable at $9 ($8 for students).

The variety of veggies is incredible. The little corn on the cobs are fun to put in just for the hell of it. I don't like to eat them, I just think they're awesome.

Even though it was a busy Saturday evening, we only waited a few minutes to be seated at a table. Yes it's a make your own Asian buffet, and I know I'm a lousy cook but not bad in ""mixing"" foods. I seemed to do well in selecting the raw vegetables, toppings, meats, sauces, and then you hand the bowl over and the stir fry cooks whip up the food for you. You can add on items like roti bread at no extra cost. I think I ate three servings on this evening (two times with noodles, once with brown rice) and was plenty full. We had a good time choosing seemingly random ingredients and creating very edible dishes, and also jamming to the soundtrack. You can ask for a box for leftovers, but they will charge a few extra dollars for the box to ward off people from over-ordering and taking everything to go.",0.9573,0.839,0.134,0.027,0.3633265856950067

2011-12-13,4.0,"Not sure what others are complaining about regarding value and price: $15 seems pretty fair for a decent dinner in the Chicago Loop.  (Can you imagine what the rent must be??)   After sifting through dozens of Yelp reviews for the Loop area (basically everything within a half-mile radius of Monroe and La Salle), I chose the Flat Top Grill. I ruled out everything really expensive (entrees over $30) -- and there were some good choices -- but in the end, even though traveling on an expense account, I wasn't in the mood for a fancy, hoity-toity treatment of what would probably be a small portion of Chilean sea bass, or a way-too-expensive-because-I'm-a-chef! slab of steak for $40+ that I could rival with my Weber charcoal grill back home for, oh, about $10.   So Flat Top it was. I had a great time, from the cheery and helpful waitress who guided me through the build-your-own stir fry process. (It's just like a salad bar.) I had fun putting together my stir fry, an eclectic mix of celery, onion, broccoli, rice noodles, spinach, carrot slivers, black beans, red cabbage. I threw on some sauces -- they recommend 3 to 4 small ladles: garlic water, some thai dressing, and some hot chili sauce. Lastly, you fill a small bowl with meat; I chose sirloin, heaped it with chopped garlic (fighting a cold, buit garlic is delicious and healthy anyways), and -- awesome! -- some chopped cilantro.  Then you put the bowls, veggies and meat, rims touching, on a table in front of the cook; a waiter delivers the stir fry to your table.  The ingredients were fresh -- and the end product was delicious and healthy. (Check my Twitter feed for a pic.)   Because I'm gluten-free these days, I did not try the roti, which from all the Yelps, is really good. I'm giving Flat Top four stars only because five stars should be something that really blows me away from a culinary perspective.

Also, although the server walked us around and made sure that my friend who has food allergies (FA) had a FA stick in his food and yet when we were discussing the appetizer, she didn't point out that the item that we picked out had nuts in it and thus put the kabash on his eating any more than one piece.

Cons: - Seriously overpriced. Especially considering the fact that you prepare your own dish. For the cost of the meal, it should automatically be all-you-can-eat, but you have to pay an extra $1 for unlimited trips. - The area with the sauces is always a mess. They really need to find a better layout, or a better way to dispense the sauces, because it really does look gross a lot of the time.

2011-07-31,1.0,"When I moved to Chicago in 2002, Flat Top became our family's favorite restaurant when everyone would come to visit. We had great experiences at the locations in Evanston and off Belmont for years. I've since moved away, and Friday night the entire family arrived from Texas, New York, Arizona, and Chicago's Lakeview in town for a reunion. We had made reservations two weeks previous at the Wabash location in the loop and couldn't wait. It pains me to say that due to our experience, we will never go back to this Flat Top.  First, they tried to cram our 7-person party  at a 6 person table--the hostess seemed nervous about seating us, making me think they forgot about our reservation. As we are all adults, and therefore of an adult size--this table was not appropriate (in fact, there were only 6 place settings). So we asked for an appropriately sized table, one in which we would be able to use our elbows when eating. Unfortunately, this is where poor customer service and incompetent management came to light. As we we waited, and waited, and waited for a new table, we wondered what was taking so long as the restaurant was not crowded by any means. In fact there was a free 8 person table in the back. When we asked why we couldn't sit there, we were told it was for another reservation. Upon asking why their reservation was more important than our reservation, the manager informed us that ""you rejected your table, and so have to wait for another."" Aside from this insensitivity and unprofessionalism, it was just plain rude. The implication that it was our fault that they were trying to jam us into a small, inadequate table, was, suffice to say, shocking. Not only that, but not once did anyone say ""I'm sorry."" Furthermore, when we asked for an apology, the manager responded ""I'm sorry you feel that way,"" the ultimate f-you. When we asked the manager to comp us something for the wait, she flat out said no, repeating the parroted go-to response of the evening ""You rejected your table."" Eventually, we did get two 3.99 appetizers for free, but only after we had been seated and it was the waitress who informed us. Wouldn't it have made more sense to give us something while we were waiting and while we were upset?  I am giving a one star review because the waitress was excellent and so was the food, but what a disappointing visit that could have been easily overcome by a modicum of management skill. If you want a night out at a great restaurant, visit any other Flat Top and stay far away from this one. It'll be worth the taxi fare.",0.8242,0.84,0.088,0.072,0.5805465367965368

If you have never been there it works kind of like a buffet, except you pick out the raw food you want them to cook together into a fun dish. I am a little disappointed with the selection of choices but this is usually because they mix things together. Like water chestnuts and bamboo or corn and broccoli. I'd rather have them separated so I can pick and choose exactly what I want in my dish.  They have a large selection of oils to put on your dish to make it cook with flavor. Your waiter will even help you put together a mixture if you ask.  The only real problem I have with the place is that it can be a tight fit with seating.

I only have one piece of advice to tell this flattop location: Please cook your broccoli, it's always hard!  The reason this place gets 4 stars is because my favorite flattop location is North Ave, they are better, they cook their broccoli.  The new bowl system is awkward because it's doesn't fit on the counter. Also the $4.59 for you to take home your bowl is a ripoff. I would never pay for that.

For one, its a free-for-all when you place your completed dish at the counter. The cook will just randomly pick up bowls, so you could be the last one picked even if you were the first to place your bowl in the area.

I'm not surprised the place is so popular since there's something for everyone.  It's not a bad idea to get a reservation, the place gets really crowded at noon.  I recommend getting there by 11:30 if you don't want to wait a long time for your food, though it always takes longer than you'd expect.  Also, it seems pretty affordable at 8.99 for a bowl of stir fry, but when you add in tax and tip it seems like a lot of money for what you're getting (overcooked meat, drowned in sauce, with a side of green beans).",0.8926,0.831,0.107,0.062,0.47555555555555556

2010-11-08,3.0,"A very different restaurant experience which isn't necessarily a bad thing. We stumbled into the Flat Top grill after our hotel dining guide had us chasing a rabbit's trail to a restaurant that had moved. Always double check with Yelp*, lesson learned.  I can see how the Flat Top grill could be a hard sell to some people. Instead of sitting down and looking at a menu there's a card with directions on it. There is a menu but that's mostly for drinks and side items. The directions show you that this is a create your own stir-fry joint. There's sticks you write your name on, bowls to take up and fill with the ingredients you want (one bowl for meat, the larger for veggies, noodles, rice, etc.) other sticks to put in your bowl at the grill stations for items that aren't out at the buffet.  Now have you ever been to a buffet and come across a container of raw chicken? It was a little unsettling to me.  It should be said that although you choose exactly what you put in your dish, this isn't exactly the place for picky eaters. If you take a seat by the grill you can watch the food being prepared (and why wouldn't you?) you'll notice that your stir-fry will be cooked MILLIMETERS away from the next persons food, using the same spatulas to flip the food around. I do not want to be eating my meal and find someones tofu chunk in it. They do make concessions for people with allergies, they have a separate grill but I don't have allergies. I just get weirded out.  Maybe it's me, maybe I'm not mature enough for a place like the Flat Top grill. Perhaps I need that wall between me and the kitchen where I can imagine everything is being prepared to my highest standards. I guess I just don't like knowing. Ignorance is bliss.

This means that I avoid processed, over salted, high fat, and high calorie foods in general- which makes going out to eat almost impossible let alone enjoyable. The amazing thing about FTG is that you can eat as healthy OR as unhealthy as you want! I love their brown rice and I load it up with edamame, sprouts, corn, onions, water chestnuts, mushrooms, snap peas, and fish. Top it with some ginger or garlic water and let it grill. For a treat the asian sesame sauce is amazing and healthy. I understand that the whole 'make your own dinner' dining concept may not be embraced by everybody but if you don't like your food, you have no one to blame but yourself : )",0.8325,0.773,0.152,0.075,0.5861363636363637

I was given the wrong type of mojito as well. Our server was awesome and apologetic. Wasn't his fault, but the grill chefs need to get their act together.

I had no idea on meats, sauces, pairings and the entire process.  We wandered up and tried, but had no idea what to expect.  The good thing was that there were two lines, but everyone was on top of one another.  An employee, as he was putting more chicken on the meat bar, spilled leftover chicken juices on my boyfriend and was rude.  (I also didn't like leaving the food unchilled on the counter when so many bowls were in line.) Our waiter had disappeared and it took forever to get the bill. Moreover, the staff was very disorganized and three times they tried to serve us other food. Then we didn't get the food that we prepared - mine had seafood mixed in it (not ordered) and my boyfriend's was missing his seafood and some choices, but  had extra vegetables.  I'm not sure it tasted any different from one another: too greasy and bland.   Maybe it was the wrong combo, but between that, the lack of some service (and some rudeness), I was just not impressed for what you got.  I'd be hesitant to try it again.",-0.9782,0.797,0.043,0.161,0.6043981481481483

2010-08-05,2.0,"Okay. I've been to this Flat Top Grill a couple of times and I have to say that I have yet to be impressed. The first time I went was with a group of friends during the lunch hour, which I DEFINITELY do not recommend. The place was so crowded that we had to wait in line just to get to the buffet line for a carry out order! I think we spent about 15 minutes waiting before we were finally able to gather some food. Then, of course, we had to wait another 20-30 minutes to wait for our food to be cooked. Paying for the meal was a nightmare as well. The second time, I went with a friend during the early-dinner hour and the place was nearly empty--a much better time to go. However, I agree with other reviewers in that the staff is wishy-washy. Sometimes the wait staff just disappear, never to be seen or heard from again. Very spooky...  My 2-star review, however is mostly for the food. Yes, yes. I realize that at this restaurant, I MAKE my own meal by choosing which carbs, veggies, meats, and sauces I want, so if the meal sucks, I'm probably mostly to blame. However, as another reviewer noted, all my food ends up tasting the same: rather bland and really greasy. And the price may be inexpensive by Chicago standards, but I still feel like I've gotten cheated out of a good meal. I'd almost rather load up on the rice and veggies, take everything back to my apartment, and cook it myself. At least then, I would know it would have some flavor. It's very possible that I'm just not getting the right carb/veggie/meat/sauce ratio when a gather my food up into the bowls, but I'm not particularly eager to try it again. I've read over some of the other reviews and it sounds like the breakfast at this Flat Top is pretty good--and I LOVE me some breakfast food--so maybe I'll try it again, but in the A.M.

Just put all your likings in a bowl and they will grill it up for you or make it into a soup. And the best part is the lunch pricing is super reasonable at $10!  I enjoyed our lunch so much that we returned for a second visit during our week long stay. Only wish they extended their locations to the west coast.

Definitely gets busy after 12 like any place in the Loop but I haven't waited more than 10 minutes. Flat Top did 'lose' one of my coworkers orders on the grill but they rectified it by taking it off our tab.

Yes, you are touching, picking the raw meat yourself. Raw meat includes chicken, beef. And guess what, the bowl holding those meat are so much smaller than the bigger rice bowl. I need a hand towel to clean my hand after picking those meats.  2) pick your sauce - Oh wait, you need to taste it before you know how it taste with you rice. Imaging scooping sauce, some will spill to our hand, luckily not my dress shirt and imagine drinking abit of soy sauce, ginger sauce, and whatever sauce? Gosh, try do that on a salad bar counter and I bet they will call you crazy. I don't mind picking my sauce but please make it more convenience. 3) The handover - All food are placed on the counter top and they will stir-fry it for you. If there's no space, well, just squezz in. Ops, what about the sauce and raw meat, well --- customer beware.  4) All you can eat - yup, they have it but you have to find it in their menu. The word is so small that I almost will not see it. Add one dollar, and you can go back for unlimited rounds. 5) The bowl is small, plastically cheap. imagine put some rice in there, then, vege, then mushroom, then move to sauce, then mushroom fall off since it's a small bowl.

2010-02-26,3.0,"2.5 stars This is a great group place to come to. Never having been here, I thought I would be so overwhelmed by all these colorful sticks and order etc. But it's quite straight forward. 1. write your name down on wooden stick. Stick it in your bowl at the end. 2. Go to the veggie buffet thingy. Pack your bowl with veggies and ~3 ladles of sauce (try to follow similar flavors to avoid an inedible product.) 3. use small bowl for meat. Stack it on top of your veggie bowl. 4. Add sticks for eggs, roti, shrimp (extra $), lettuce wrap, mushu wraps, hot and sour soup etc etc 5. Leave your bowl at the grill, and they will bring it to your table! Some standouts: ROTI! OMG sooooo good. You can add this by putting a stick at the end before the grill. I also like using the thai sauces (pad thai, peanut, red curry etc). LOVE the cilantro too. Other sticks can be added to get your whole meal wrapped into lettuce wraps or mushu wraps.  I think the problem here is that you make it yourself, so if it tastes kinda bad.. you can only blame yourself!! This is a problem especially for those new to Flat Top b/c we don't know what we're doing! I think the rule of thumb is just to stick to similar flavors. (They also have sauce combo recommendations on their menus.)  Also, I'm not a HUGE fan of mongolian grill style (b/c I feel like I can make it at home...and stir fry is something I make when I'm lazy).

We came on a Saturday afternoon which meant there wasn't really anyone here.  Service was attentive and friendly - we never had to wait for anything that we requested.  Our server explained the ins and outs of Flat Top to us newbies and we were set to start our stir fry experience.

A pretty good experience, if you ask me.  I still think Mongolian BBQ is better just because the buffet area is larger and there's way more combos and choices.  However, this is a great little restaurant to have downtown, especially if you're looking for a fairly quick and satisfying lunch.  Prices are great AND they have student discounts if you are looking for a place to use your college I.D.",0.997,0.783,0.203,0.015,0.5948616198616199

2010-01-02,2.0,"I'm really suprised at all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this place. People really love FTG including my good friend...which is how we came to dine at this establishement.  We wanted to catch a quick bite before seeing In The Heights. Have you seen it? It's fantastic. There is something for everyone and sort of a little west side story-ish. I thought the music was top notch and... Oh wait, this is supposed to be a review of FTG.... So my friend was craving FTG. When I found out it was a make-your-own stir fry deal...I didn't really get the hype. I mean, can't you just...MAKE YOUR OWN STIR FRY? Then I remembered...she doesn't cook. Which is sort of a good thing...trust me.  It was OK. Meh. I've expereienced better is pretty accurate. People really seem to go ape shit over the roti. I thought it was just OK. I thought it was really greasy and would have preferred naan to be honest. I went the sweet & spicy route...using the recipe from the menu. I loaded up on veggies and asked my server to bring me a bowl of rice after my stir fry arrived b/c I didn't want my rice cooked with everything else. I'm a rebel.  They had a good variety of veggies and faux meat for the vegetarians. I got some chicken and I'm not going to lie....I was pretty hesitant to slop up a ladle of it into a bowl. It looked like a hotbed of bacteria. I realize it was marinating in soy...but it just did not look appetizing to me.  Raw meat bar = not a good idea, in my opinion. Why not just have a colored stick to put in your bowl of veggies/sauce to indicate what sort of meat (if any) you want added? Yellow for chicken, red for beef, etc...that seems a little more sanitary to me....and probably a better way to moderate portions....thus saving the establishment some money in the long run. Are you listening to me FTG? I didn't get salmonella and the show was fabulous. All in all it was a great night. Would I go back to FTG? Perhaps after I receive my lifetime gift certificates for the awesome money saving suggestion I stated above. I'll be checking my mail box FTG. Thank you.",0.9959,0.802,0.171,0.027,0.5695592948717948
2009-12-27,5.0,"I didn't expect Flat Top Grill to be a make-your-own-stir-fry type of establishment, but was pleasantly surprised that it was.   You get the all you can eat option, but really don't need it if you know how to pack a bowl (of rice/noodles and veggies and meat....).  And the waiters are cool enough to make jokes with you about it and not try to get you to get the more expensive all you can eat option so they get a bigger tip.   Everything is clearly marked and they are very helpful with any allergies that you may have.  They really try to make the entire process fool proof, but I guess there are still fools out there.   I put practically everything but mushrooms into my bowl of rice and mixed a few sauces and it was awesome.",0.9505,0.776,0.163,0.061,0.47812499999999997

The best part of the experience was the bread and the steak quesadillas starter were excellent!   It is a little pricey though- for just one bowl of food is like $12 not including a drink.  If you pay $14.95 you get unlimited which seems odd, two bucks more and you basically have the buffet.  They should just get rid of the nickel and dime tactics and charge a flat fee for everything .

2009-12-18,2.0,"I always wonder why I don't eat at Flat Top more often. Then someone will suggest going there, and I think, ""sure, why not?"" and agree to go. Then I remember why. It's just really mediocre. On the numerous occasions I've gone, and I've been to pretty much every location, I try to be adventurous and concoct a different combination of ingredients. Despite whatever meat/vegetetables/sauce I create, it all ends up tasting pretty much the same. And quite often the fixins look like they have that ""not so fresh feeling"". The vegetables just look limp and tired, and the meat, particularly the beef, looks like unappetizing cuts of mystery parts that have been sitting on the grocery store shelf a little too long. I've given FTG many chances to wow me, or at the very least, not disappoint me. I don't think I'll be back.",0.9568,0.773,0.179,0.048,0.5621759259259259

The first time we were here it was for their practice run, and it was free, and I was amazed that they were giving away such awesome food for free. The most recent visit was just as delicious and fun as the first one.  First off, I really loved how organized and clearly labeled everything on the buffet was. There was no guess work involved! My inner gem-a-phobe was also very happy seeing all the raw veggies and raw meats were nicely separated from each other The selection was mind boggling and seemed to allow for endless possibilities for stir fry goodness. They even have those options with the sticks, like get it made into a soup, or moo shoo, and that awesome bread. And the what? 20 different sauces or so?  The waitstaff is also friendly, they offer suggestions, they bring re fills quickly, they check on your food when you are getting worried about it. I was only displeased with one thing I made and really it was my own fault for not realizing that korean bbq and plum sauce would not mix well and for not knowing that grilling the edamame really doesn't make for tasty edamame.

I have never been to a restaurant that has such an abundance of studly male servers.  Not that really matters much, but they were also polite, attentive, helpful, and fast.  Regardless of their appearance, the service here was great. Flat top is a mostly help yourself kind of place.  It is create your own stir fry.  There are two bars that help to cut down on congestion.  You fill a bow with your choice of different kinds of noodles or rice (or none), then select add your veggies, select your sauce (there is a nice server waiting to help you try different combinations), and pick your meat.  Then you put it in line to be cooked.  There are some final things you can add, I highly recommend the flat bread!!  It was all very tastey!! The décor was nice, modern but they used nice warm colors and darker woods.  Tables are set a little back so you are not disturbed by the people getting their food.  Also, there are coat hooks along the wall so you do not have to be burdened by your coat and can still keep an eye on it.  This will really come in handy during the Chicago winter!   I highly recommend this restaurant, and I also recommend that you get a reservation.  We went early and it was a little busy.  By the time we left it was packed and there was a line to be seated.",0.9941,0.781,0.198,0.022,0.5111784511784511

2009-09-27,2.0,"I had a pretty sub-par experience, and here's why: Service: -Service was generally slow and it was definitely not crowded Food: -Great selection of ingredients, sauces and ""extras"" like colored sticks to indicate (mostly free) extras to go with your meal -Drinks were overpriced for the kind of restaurant Problems: -I made a stir fry with chicken and my friend made his with beef. The food came back with the meats mixed up and so I ended up with what tasted like hamburger helper, Asian style. This wouldn't have been such a disaster if the hamburgery beef wasn't the quality and consistency of late-night diner, back of the grill greasy meat.  Apparently the chicken was fine. But it really ruined the experience for me, because not only was the service slow, the meat mixed up, the meat low-quality/greasy and basically disgusting, but for $10 I can stroll down the street to Noodles and Co. where I have yet to have a negative experience and I can spend less on more food and get reasonably priced drinks. Also, the service is wonderful at Noodles and Co.  Also, when we told our waiter about the mixup he didn't want to acknowledge what was going on and we were just politely telling him for reference that he might want to mention it to the cook to be a little more careful. Then, he proceeds to get the manager and apparently told her we were causing a problem and she comes up to us and says, ""So, what's the problem?"". We didn't even ask for management and only were trying to tell our reluctantly acknowledging wait what had happened. And when she came it seemed like she was less interested in apologizing or finding out what happened than it looked like she was ready to tell us that if we wanted our money back we wouldn't be getting it. Which we had no intention of asking for, though it did cross my mind.  To be fair, at the very end, they offered to let all of us share one dessert to make up for the general trouble, but after waiting so long for everything and having to deal with the mixup and the subpar reactions we got from the staff we just wanted to leave. I could have made another bowl but when I'm paying $10 to make my own meal and did indeed spend a lot of time peicing together something that would have been good with the chicken I selected, I didn't feel like doing that again and making my party wait. The other thing is that they charge $5 for you to take home your leftovers, and at $10 a meal that's a ripoff for the quality and quantity of ingredients. -Verdict: Miserably disappointing (slightly irritating/aggravating) and a rip-off unless you don't get the beef, don't mind paying 50% of the price of your meal to get leftovers you already paid for, realllly enjoy creating your own meal, don't mind your noodles half mixed up with your sauce/ingredients, and don't mind overpriced basic drinks. Also, service might be slow. Do yourself a favor and please take yourself right over to Noodles and Company and save a lot of time, money and possible grief. Note: I would've given and want to give one star but I like the concept and would like to think  that the rest of the staff is much better- giving the benefit of a doubt, if you will.",0.9896,0.793,0.131,0.076,0.50415982484948

2009-09-19,5.0,"Welcome to the Loop, FTG! On September 21, the brilliant folks at Flat Top will open this gem for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We swung by their complementary practice lunch for a preview, and I was thrilled for several reasons. 1: TWO serving lines, y'all. Because one bummer about the other locations is the amount of time you have to stand in line waiting for people to craft their perfect meal. And then not wanting to hold up the line while you create YOUR perfect meal. I always wave for people to go around me; they never do... With two lines filled to the brim with identical fixins, they're making this whole ""quick workday lunch @ FTG"" thing a possibility. Good thinking, Loop location. 2: Lotttts of veggies. Enough to make me say, enough already. And many I've never seen at other FTGs. All this plus their brilliant faux meat options (Quorn, seitan, +2 others) plus meat-meats and calamari. 3: More colored stick options. Including one to add eggs to your stir fry--of course! (Oh and if you're new to this, ALWAYS use the roti prata bread stick. Always. 4: Tasty appetizers and desserts. I still find the concept of ordering appetizers at a AYCE place pretty silly, but they're good. The quesadilla appetizer inspired me to branch out from the usual Asian-influenced stir fry I normally create-- now it's all about Mexican-style veggies, Quorn, horseradish tofu + black bean sauce, lots of shredded cheddar with the roti prata bread. Heavenly. And should you save room, the signature brownie with homemade whipped cream is devine. 5: Flavored lemonades & teas. I cannot recommend highly enough the chipotle pineapple lemonade. Just enough bite to highlight how refreshing it is. Other flavors include pomegranate, mango, and desert pear. The grill remains under $9 for lunch, $3 for the flavored drinks. Student discounts plus a free meal on your birthday and for joining their email list. And rumor has it they're going to do breakfast every. day. of. the. week.",0.99,0.854,0.133,0.013,0.6035274621212121
