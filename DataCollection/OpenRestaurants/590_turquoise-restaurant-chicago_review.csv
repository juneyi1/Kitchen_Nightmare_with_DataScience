They were very nice and accommodating with seating as we kept rearranging. They start you off with a dip/spread and bread. I think the dip has carrots in it. Not sure what else but it was delicious! Had I not been there with others I might have licked the plate clean and asked for more! The bread was insane!!! So yummy!!  I think they make their own and it is well worth a slice (or 10). I had the lamb wrap sandwich. It was delicious and flavorful and lasted approximately 5 minutes as I scarfed it down ASAP. The yogurt (?) sauce was wonderful with it - I should have asked for more.  Inside is also cute but their patio is lovely. Definitely worth a visit.

I went here last night for dinner with a friend and have not one complaint from start to finish. Upon entering, the restaurant was about 3/4 full on a Sunday night around 8pm. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our waiter made excellent suggestions and was very patient with me making my selections as I had never had Turkish cuisine before! He was honest in steering me from making decisions he didn't think I would personally desire and pointed me in the right direction with our entrees. We tried the Mujver as an appetizer, he initially recommended the calamari which I would've loved to try but the person I was with does not like it, so we skipped that. The Mujver was delicious, but I'd probably try a different appetizer if I were to return. For entrees, we went with the Adana Kebap and the Colorado Braised Lamb Shank which were ABSOLUTELY delicious. Our service was impeccable, and we were even treated to a flan dessert.

The service has always been spotty - even for take out I've shown up 30 minutes after placing my order only to have to wait 15 minutes for my food.  I was meeting a contractor at my house this afternoon so decided to grab lunch on my way home. I walked in around 12:30 and waited at the host stand with a 'Please wait to be seated' sign. There were four seated tables, all toward the middle to back off the dining area and one server who was at the POS terminal at the back of the dining area. I expected that he would seat me once he finished, but instead he disappeared back in the kitchen. A couple minutes later he came out with food for a four top. After brief discussion with the patrons, he went back in the kitchen and came out with a small bowl for that table, them returned to the kitchen to come back out with ketchup. I found it strange that he didn't take the few seconds to grab a menu and seat me but figured he didn't want their food to get cold. He then went back into the kitchen briefly, came back out, and proceeded to take the order of a two top, which included quite a bit of discussion with the patrons. He then went to the POS system to enter their orders. After another brief trip to the kitchen, he came out, paused at the POS station, walked about 2/3 of the way to the front - past all his seated tables - paused, and walked back into the kitchen.

The restaurant is absolutely dainty and the patrons enjoying their time gives off a peaceful vibe on a Sunday afternoon in Europe. I absolutely loved every single dish ordered here. I will definitely recommend Turquoise for those who are curious of Turkish food. Their choice of ingredients are noticeably fresh, premium and exotic.  Let's proceed on to the food: 1. Bread service. The complimentary bread is serve warm and toasted!  It's served with a cold eggplant, roasted tomatoes and onions medley, I would happily just get full on the bread.  2. Seared Diver Sea Scallops. The scallops are large and well accentuated with olive oil and avocado purée.  3. Chicken Kebab. The pieces of chicken are marinated with strong spices that every bite paired with a mouthful of basmati rice is a blast of euphoria. There's something about the texture of long thin grains of basmati rice so satisfying that you just want to down the whole plate in a one sitting.  4. Ossobucco Short Rib. This was the main dish of the afternoon. This baby is the definition how succulent beef short ribs should be.

We arrived just after 7:30 with reservations for 7:45 and weren't seated until 8:05 or so. We ordered very quickly, by about 8:10, and our food still hadn't arrived at almost 9. Our original server was nowhere to be seen and it took a different one asking us if we needed anything to go check on our order.  She came back and claimed the chef was ""backed up"", without much apology. Our food finally came out at about 9:10. My order was decent, the lamb was tasty and the sauce was good. My wife's mussels, however, were terrible. The broth was good but the mussels were extremely fishy tasting.  Our original server was still nowhere to be found when we were finished with our food. A different one asked if we needed anything, then asked why my wife had hardly touched the mussels. We politely explained she didn't care for them but the broth was good - not asking for any sort of compensation (we just wanted to go home already at that point!) and she seemed sort of insulted and said she'd bring us the check.  Moments later, our original server finally showed up and asked if we wanted dessert. We asked for the check and of course got no apology from him for the long wait, his being essentially nonexistent all evening nor for the poor food.  I understand sometimes a restaurant drops the ball or has an off night, but that was a really expensive strike out. This place isn't cheap!

Some friends of ours were in town visiting, and we thought this place would be perfect for the occasion. Google considers it a ""romantic"" restaurant, so we were expecting a nice, quiet vibe. That was not the case at all, as the place was an absolute mad house from the moment we walked in. We had reservations at 8:30 and were seated about 15 minutes late- not a big deal. We received waters and their fresh baked bread, which was absolutely amazing! We ordered our food promptly and couldn't wait to try our Mediterranean dishes. Unfortunately, it had been storming all night- absolutely pouring! Our waitress, after we waited an hour for our food, finally apologized and said that all the reservations came in at the same time because of the storm. This was just poor, slow service, in my opinion, being blamed on the customers coming in at the same time. It is my feeling that reservations are exactly that, so if guests arrived late for their reservation, why would they be given priority still when some of us did arrive on time?  All in all, I knocked off 2 stars due to the experience. The restaurant was crazy loud to the point where we could hardly hear our friends at the small table across from us and staff members were running all over the place. The food was the only saving grace here. Our meals were delicious and filling, but I only wish we hadn't waited over an hour to receive it.

It's pretty rare to find sit down food of this quality (especially in Roscoe Village) for a little over $20 for two people. The lunch menu is fairly extensive, with my personal favorite options being the Chorizo Panini and the Chicken Kebap. The Chorizo Panini features (slightly) spicy fresh chorizo with combination of provolone and mozzarella cheese. Moreover, it comes with a huge helping of fries, so you won't leave hungry. If I'm in the mood for a something a little lighter I go with the Chicken Kebap. The kebap includes grilled chicken breast, rice and some veggies, all fresh and tasty. Both of these dishes are under $10, which is a nice bonus. Even though its technically a Turkish Restaurant , they have lunch options like the Chicken & Turkey panini's, so when when your unadventurous aunt from the suburbs is in town, there's something for her also.

For my birthday we placed a large delivery order through  yelp.com  and I called Turquoise to confirm the order went through. The person on the other line was INCREDIBLY rude with me and to make a long story short I chose to cancel my order. The manager kindly cancelled my order. However, he still charged my credit card! I called the next week and he gave me an excuse about how he wasn't authorized to give refunds and I'd have to talk to Chownow (powered by Yelp) to receive my money back. I contacted Chownow and they apologized for the misinformation but that Turquoise is the one to authorize the refund. Chownow has been wonderful and has tried to contact Turquoise 4 different times and each time they were denied the authorization to refund my money. Bottom line is that  I did not authorize that transaction with Turquoise and they continue to retain my money. I'm very disappointed in this turn of events as I feel the fact that we received no food in exchange for the money they took from us would mean it was an easily refundable case but they still refuse to give us our money back.

I have been to Turkey, and I am very pleased that there is a place in Chicago which approaches the excellence i had in Turkish cities and towns. Of note the AMAZING bread. It s the best bread in Chicago--I dream about this bread. If I lived closer I would buy this bread daily. They have a well stocked bar of regional spirits and wines, imported. This is a nice touch to have with the food, that one can have the regional drinks as well. While I liked everything, specially for me, the lamb dishes were exceptional--not many places in Chicago do lamb well.

2016-04-24,5.0,"Bravo, Turquoise.  This restaurant is about a 0.6 mi walk away from the Brown Line Paulina stop. Just week walking down W. Roscoe and you are there. The entrance is beautifully clean and welcoming, we walked in and were immediately greeted. We sat down at a table and we were asked our beverage choice, and the beverage was brought out.  Inside the restaurant, it was tastefully decorated. I actually appreciate that this restaurant doesn't scream Istanbul or Turkey in my face. Rather, beautiful Mediterranean flowers and terrace adorned their wall decor, but not overdone by any means. The restaurant was playing soft Mediterranean music, makes me feel like I was on top of an island in Santorini :P At the end, I seriously did not want to leave, I wanted to take a siesta right in the restaurant, that was how comfortable I felt. I ordered the kefte kebap, AMAZING! It was accompanied by these soft pita that are sliced, I want to know the recipe, and I am not going to lie, when I came home I googled. Came with heirloom  mushrooms that are sliced, arugula, Persian pickles, exquisitely grilled lamb meats that are tender and juicy, and also a yogurt sauce. I wanted to bring that yogurt sauce home. The other person in my party ordered the lacmachun, I have to say, it was very good. Soft pie with ground red meat thinly layered, tomato, some lemon zest and arugula. Yum Yum. Also got the baked eggplant mash, I am not used to the strong taste of the baked eggplants, but the other person in my party who is native to the region really enjoyed it. I also ordered the Onion soup, very nice, just a bit salty. But good French onion soup is hard to nail, I'd still give it a 8/10. Complimentary traditional Ramadan Turkish bread(light and fluffy on the inside and crusty on the outside, yum) is brought out to every table, with a mashed carrots with mayo dressing (very good, and I don't even like carrots!!). Also olive oil is available on every table, very fresh and crisp, feels like the olives were just recently pressed. The service here was quick and professional, no nonsense.

We were less impressed with our main courses (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5). I had the caprese salad, admittedly, this might not be their best dish since it isn't a Turkish dish. The tomatoes had a strange spice to them and the sundried tomato past on it didn't fit the flavors or textures well at all. I thought I might not be enjoying it because I had filled up on the other delicious food and bread already, but when I tried to eat the leftovers later I ended up just throwing it away.

I've never heard of it in the 8 years I've lived in Lakeview. Yikes, I clearly have a pretty myopic focus on certain types of cuisine. We went to Turquoise on a Saturday evening recently and had a wonderful meal. The meal started with a delicious loaf of bread that came with the most delightful and delicious carrot salad. I will be spending my afternoon trying to find a recipe to replicate this salad, it was that good. Mmmmmm. We definitely over-ordered, but lucky for me that meant dinner the next night after my friend left!  Everything was delicious... we started (and shared) a feta salad with a nice greek style dressing and the caprese which had a burrata centerpiece (mmmm). For our dinner we shared the Iskender, which is doner (picture gyro meat) over toasted bread, yogurt, tomato puree. It was soooo good. We also shared stuffed mini-eggplants - the stuffing was a mix of veggies. It was so tender and flavorful.  We were too stuffed for desert, which was a shame. Service and atmosphere are fine. It would be a cute spot for a date night. The service was not especially attentive, it reminded me more of service you would find outside of the US. A little slow and not overly friendly but definitely adequate. I tend not to expect American norms for service when I'm at an ethnic restaurant (unless it's fancy and expensive), so I was not disappointed. The key takeaway from the reviews for me is to stick to the mediterranean dishes unless you've been dragged there against your will and you'd rather eat ""American"" style food.

2014-09-25,3.0,"Hubby had a  restaurant.com  deal and I had some cute new jeans I wanted to sport, so Turquoise was the spot for our fri night date.  Luckily, we found free parking 1 block west on roscoe but there were a few metered spots in front. I had made a reso and still had to wait 20 min. Sorry, that automatically knocks off a star. We were seated by the aisle and usually this bugs me, but servers were very observant to not nudge or bump into me.  Although our server looked like my former evil boss, I tried to not hold it against her as she was really prompt and helpful when we had questions. We order 2 glasses of Pinot noir and while they were decent, they required breathing to be drinkable. Maybe they just opened this bottle? Idk. They were very tangy at first. Decent but drinkable later.  We received the complimentary bread which was definitely the best freaking bread I've had in a while. Took all my strength to not eat a whole loaf. We ordered mujver since yelp told me to and it was exquisite. Not too heavily breaded to overstuff you, and the sauce was the boss. I had the salmon that came with gnocchi. Salmon was just ok, same taste as store bought. So much gnocchi in this dish, I had to box it up for another day. Gnocchi was also standard. He had the yogurt kabap which was the same sauce as the mujver but with lamb. He loved it.  From the looks of the menu and reviews, this is definitely more of a lamb-driven spot. It seems the most popular dishes are lamb and that's all good. It's just not the spot I'm really gonna enjoy most.

2014-08-27,1.0,"I am thoroughly disappointed in my experience at this restaurant.  From the moment we walked in the restaurant, the hostess/waitress was extremely cold. She brought us to our table and just gave us our menus and walked away. We had never been there before, no explanation of specials, no explanation of anything. We waited about 10 minutes to even get acknowledged by our waitress again, who we had to flag down. We had to flag her down the whole night actually. We ordered wine, which I have never seen before but it had sediment in the bottom of the glass? I had to flag her down since she never came to us on our own and tell her and she said that was normal to see the sediment in the bottom of the glass. I have never seen that before or heard of that. They brought out homemade bread and a dip. They just set it down on our table and walked away. We had no idea what it even was, not even an explanation after placing the dip on the table! We flagged her down again later to actually get an explanation of what it was that was just put in front of us, as well as to put our order in. The food came out and tasted fine, but the lamb was very cold. She never ONCE came over to our table to see how our meals were or ask if we needed anything. Halfway through my meal, I FOUND A HAIR!! It was already a terrible experience and we debated about leaving and I just could not believe there was a small dark hair on my plate! I told the waitress and she was actually apologetic which was nice to see some sign of life in her. She did offer another meal to me. When we got the check at the end of the night, I was actually surprised to see that I was still charged in full for my plate of food.  All in all, I would never recommend this place. The service was terrible, especially considering we went on a Monday night and there were only a few tables. I felt that as customers we were ignored.

2014-07-06,4.0,"Arriving well before sunset, I sat outside to enjoy the nice weather. Warm bread and a spread of eggplant, red peppers, and olive oil came to the table. Turquoise Café has a neon sign in the window that says, WE BAKE OUR OWN BREAD. They do a superb job and the light smokiness of the spread was a nice start. Where I knew the dining experience was going to be top was with the diver sea scallops served with lettuce leaves shaped to hold mini tomato salads and situated atop dollops of creamed avocado wasabi. I have had tender scallops at numerous restaurants. However, cutting through the scallops at Turquoise Café was like slicing through a cloud. You would not think something so cloud-like would burst with flavour either, the way those seasoned scallops tasted. My next starter was a bowl of creamy lentil soup. If I sound like a broken record when I say that Middle Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants serve the best lentil soup, I apologize, but anyone who slurps a bowl of the lentil soup will corroborate my statement. For the main dish, I ordered lamb chops over a medley of vegetables consisting of potatoes, brussel sprouts, broccoli, mushrooms, and asparagus tips. Greeks are not the only ones to prepare lamb worthy of wanting a second dish and Turquoise Café produces a plate of tender lamb even when it has been requested to be cooked well. After delighting myself completely with the succulent chops, I told the server that I would have dessert and coffee, but required some time to pause. When the wait was over, I had kazandibi with Turkish coffee. Leave baklava for the non-adventurers. The creamy custard of the kazandibi topped with a light caramelized sugar crust and further topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then garnished with berries is a ""must"" dessert option.",0.9562,0.889,0.096,0.015,0.5213333333333334

The lentil soup (has a hint of mint, yum!) and kofte kebap sandwich were both worth going out of my way for and I was eager to show my husband a new find.  Recently, after doing some research (on yelp) about it's family friendliness I returned on a busy Saturday night with my family. We made a reservation a few days in advance on open table. In the reservation notes I made sure to state that our fourth person was actually an infant and that we would need a highchair. I'm not sure how accessible the notes are to the host but it was clear that she did not get them because she sat us at a table set for four adults and was confused when we said there would be no one else coming. All of the highchairs were also in use. Understandably, it was a busy Saturday and highchairs are a first come first serve deal but considering I had requested one in advance I was a little surprised that she didn't explain that they were out until we asked for one again. Not sure if the reservation notes are an open table issue or a restaurant issue but it's worth mentioning that you shouldn't expect them to be aware.

This is one of those places where I could have been easily happy eating pretty much anything.  I opted for Salmon ala pomodoro, which was good, served over gnocchi in a tomato broth.  It was just good.  I was food stalking other people's plates and wished I had gotten something a little spicier, or a turkish dish.  I was so engrossed in checking out other people's plates, I can't even remember what my friend had, but she seemed to like it.  No room at the inn for dessert.  I liked the ambiance of this place, small and crowded but not crammed, not too hot, not too cold (of course the temp was perfect outside at 55). Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, as was the water guy to my camel like drinking of water after that garlic sauce on the zucchini pancakes.   I will definitely be back.",0.991,0.799,0.185,0.016,0.6773148148148148

In fact, it was one of our first official date night experiences after we returned from our honeymoon.  What makes Turquoise so great is the wonderful combination of warm atmosphere, attentive service, and excellent food. I have to be gluten-free due to health reasons and they've been so accommodating. I do miss their AMAZING bread basket from before my diagnosis, but the rest of the food is so great that i don't even mind skipping it.

2014-04-15,1.0,"I came here with a group of friends for brunch and this review is solely based on the brunch experience. There were so many bad things about this place and I was so very disappointed by our experience. We came in on a Sunday and made a reservation the day previous. My first clue that something was strange was when I called I originally asked for a table for 6 and then called back a few minutes later to change it to 8 and they didn't hesitate to say ""sure no problem"" for a noon reservation. I thought it seemed strange they didn't need to check or even change the reservation time for a large group but I ignored it from then on. When we arrived some of our party was having a bloody Mary at the bar, I also ordered on and it was practically clear liquid, definitely not the best bloody I've ever had but it was tolerable. They told us it would be just a few minutes and we waited for almost 45 minutes. Then, they asked us if we wanted to have a seat in their downstairs area and we said sure because we were all starving. They led us down the stairs to the odd basement area with foreign news on and some couches and a few random tables. Then they left us there for about a half hour with out checking in on us once. Finally someone in our group went back up and at that point enough people had left to allow us to sit up stairs so we all moved once again. After we were finally seated upstairs (over an hour after our original reservation time) the brunch food started to appear, it was bad, unflavorful and cold. It was obvious the food we were served was sitting around for a while.  It's also like a prefix kinda deal for $16 a person. Seemed a little high for me considering the quality. The service was slow and we weren't sure who was actually our server at any time, it was kinda like we didn't have a server who was consistent, and more like random food runners dropping off plates. We consistently had to ask for everything we needed more than once and frequently the servers disappeared. We were told due to the wait that we would get a free drink/mimosa but that never happened as we were charged for the drinks we got served. When we were finally served our bill we did not tip much, maybe a couple dollars (the change from paying cash). One guy who was our server/bartender some of the time, was barely to be found the entire time during our stay, came immediately running out after our group to ""give us our change"" in a nasty, sarcastic way. I'm sorry, but you receive tips based on service and that service was bad. Also, it didn't seem like a kind of place that would deserve a normal tip as we never had one server. What a way to ensure no one comes back as well! The place was highly disorganized and I won't be coming back.",-0.9116,0.801,0.088,0.11,0.4728084997439836

2014-04-11,2.0,"Six reasons to explain the 2 star rating: 1. Rubber band in appetizer. Most likely one that was used to tie a bunch of parsley or dill that was in the dish 2.

Everyone seemed to be moving around in such great hurry, I've never seen anything like it in other busy restaurants 5. The waitress said that the bad food was due to it being a Friday, generally a busy day. That cannot be an excuse. Food at most restaurants is usually at its best on weekends. No matter how busy it gets, leaving a filet of fish on the pan long enough to over-over-overcook it isn't acceptable, not when you charge a good $20 for it. 6. The waitress did try to give us something to feel better about our experience, but what was served to us were 3 soggy baklavas. Also, patrons at our neighboring table sent back their mussel appetizer saying that it smelled pretty bad.  They do have quiet a few items on their menu with seafood in it. They also have a separate vegetarian section.

Our 6:30 dinner reservation didn't seem to mean a thing.  We waited a good 45+ minutes to be sat until a table opened up.  My party took up the entire bar area while waiting, which was very awkward for a few reasons - the restaurant is tiny (fire code paperwork says 50 people max) so sitting at the bar basically obstructs the main walkway from the door to the rest of the tables.  Not comfortable.   While we were sitting at the bar, the waitstaff acted as if we were NOT seated a foot away and facing them, and proceeded to complain (and swear) about the reservation system and confusion it was causing, among other general restaurant frustrations.  Hello! - we are sitting *right* in front of you - please act professional, don't swear, and don't make us feel even more uncomfortable.  Better yet, hold our reservation for the time we booked so we don't have to sit at the bar at all!  Once we were finally seated, our experience improved.  Bread baskets helped.  Wine helped.  The bread was served with a nice eggplant ratatouille [ I did have to ask what the small dish was though, because it was dropped off in a rush without a word ].  Our meals were all well received.  I ordered the salmon with gnocchi which was delicious, albeit a semi-small salmon portion.    We enjoyed the food, but if the service here was kicked up several notches and we felt more welcomed (initially and throughout the meal), this would have been a much more positive dining experience.",0.9654,0.866,0.105,0.029,0.5328276608449021

I would have thought this restaurant would be doing a great job since it has a 4 star rating but here is what me and my family experienced. We had to wait 45 minutes to be seated although we had reservations for 6:30, so we sat at the Bar at the entrance of the place and it is crowded and hot, you can only seat 4 people at the tables along side the bar due to the narrow walk way. The bar was shelved with a nice assortment of liquor but the drink list was limited and my mom asked for a Mai Tai, which wasn't on the list, the bartender attempted to make the drink but failed, after we told her some pineapple juice, dark rum and grenadine would help it taste much better, she fixed it and comped that drink for us. The other guy that was bar tending was new and didn't know how to open my bottle of Grolsh Beer, it took him a few minutes to remove the top then he poured it straight in so I had to wait at least 5 minutes for the half filled glass of foam to settle, I don't like to wait for that long to take a drink of my Beer unless it's Guinness. Also I don't know why the staff had the heat so high it was excessively hot and had to take off my sweater but I was still HOT! There was smoke from the kitchen that irritated our eyes for a good hour while we ate, the appetizers were served Luke warm at best but were good, I had the Chicken Lomo and the flavors weren't anything to brag about, I actually had a potato wedge and piece of Chicken from my meal because by the time it arrived I was already full from the appetizers served LUKE WARM 40 minutes prior to our entrees coming out. I did tell our server about the problem with the appetizers and the staff knew about the issue with our reservation so I figured a discount on the check would be nice although I didn't ask for it, I guess we shouldn't assume. Instead we were brought out dessert on the house although we said we didn't want dessert, it was still smokey inside and we just wanted some fresh air to clear our eyes. I wanted to enjoy a good Turkish restaurant for my Birthday celebration and decided on Turquoise. To sum it up there are better Turkish restaurants in this City and this was not a good choice for my birthday dinner the service was bad and the food was OK, we had reservations for 6:30 and didn't get our entrees until 8:30.

I am baffled by the complaints of poor service on Yelp, because we didn't have any problems at all.  One of our party had steak which wasn't cooked enough for him and they whisked it away and returned with an entire new plate (not his original steak warmed up) which was done just right the second time.  Nothing to complain about here! The warm bread they serve is delicious, as is the complimentary carrot/horseradish/yogurt appetizer.  It is best to pace yourself on the bread as the portions here are generous.  We had lentil soup, tasty but not as thick as traditionally served in middle eastern restaurants and soup of the day, a spicy cabbage soup which my friends really enjoyed.  We then had a variety of dishes - wild mushroom risotto, seafood risotto, fillet mignon, beef kebab, mixed grill and the braised lamb shoulder plus the endive salad. I had the braised lamb wrapped in eggplant which was really good.  I wanted to try the kazandibi but I should have eaten less bread and didn't have room.

2013-09-09,3.0,"It's a Friday night, and we're starving.  I'd prefer to sit outside on a nice night, so we begin to drive through Roscoe Village, eyes peeled for a restaurant with any sort of patio.  Illuminated Turquoise letters, reading ""Turquoise Cafe"", beam over a small-scale patio in front of a restaurant.  Decision made.  Time to park, and fill our bellies. After browsing the menu at the entrance, for reassurance, we request to sit outside.  We're guided back out front to the patio, where it instantly starts to rain.  Crap.  Is this a sign?  Back in to the restaurant we go to snag a table before the rest of the outdoor diners run in for cover. We were greeted quickly for our drink over.  I went with a Pinot Noir, and the two gentlemen I dined with ordered some whiskey.  We were brought over some much needed warm bread that was delicious.  Oil was provided on the table for our bread, but was also served with a mayonnaise based type coleslaw with julienned carrots. Our three entree orders consisted of the Spinach Fettuccine, the Lamb Kebab, and the Ossobuco Short Rib.  Of the three, we all agreed the Ossobuco Short Rib was the best.  The tender short rib sat atop a soft, savory, cheesy polenta, that I continued to sneak spoonfuls of.  The Spinach Fettuccine, tossed with a light tomato basil sauce, was served with hearty shrimp.  It was topped off with a small lobster tail, which was a nice surprise, seeing as it wasn't listed in the description on the menu.   The food was good, although we had some unwanted company attempting to share our meal.  From beginning to end, we found ourselves swatting away fruit flies.  I managed to kill about five. After our orders were taken, the service became spotty.  We had been started off with a male, and finished off with a female, whom I assume was helping him out because when we requested our check, she asked who our server was.  When we finally received our bill, I noticed that I had been charged more for my wine than it was listed on the menu by them ringing it in as a miscellaneous liquor.  I didn't bother complaining about it, even though I feel as though we should have. The food was good enough to go back for.  The service and fruit flies, not so much.",0.9787,0.866,0.102,0.032,0.45459770114942516

This is pherhaps the best turkish restaurant in chicago, and it's a tough call, because the other ones are good also...but this just over the top.   Located in the lovely roscoe village, where parking is easy, and the area is just splendid, there is this tiny restaurant.  Its set up very nice and has a classy appeal, it usually filled with people, so it's best to call and ask for a reservation.  The service is quick and friendly, which made the experiance all the more better.   We had the Adana kebab, Doner Kebab, Lamb Shank, Beef kebabs, and Grilled Chicken Ceaser.  But before I even dive in the to entrees, let first tell you that they have the most amazing home made turkish bread.  Nice and crusty on the outside, and soft in the inside...I could eat that with olive oil and call that a meal.     The meats were amazing, some of the best I have ever had.  The lamb shank was tender, juicy and melt in your mouth.  The Beef medallion kebabs were cooked just right, and unbelievable.  Of course the Adana kebab and Doner were good also. But to me, the one thing I look forward to is dessert...you must try thier Kazandibii, it is amazing.  It is basically a milk pudding, and bottom is carmelized/ burned.  But it tastes like heaven. I am all for turkish food, and first experianced it in Cleveland..see  my prev reviews...and being a chicagoan I was on a quest to find something better, and I sure I have.

Placing a random dirty plate on top of match bowl near the door.  I was dismayed because I enjoy a free book of matches as much as the next gal, but I was thwarted by a, well, random dirty plate that was sitting on top of the bowl.  Good thing I'd gotten one on my way in, then.

2012-09-12,5.0,My boyfriend and I had been meaning to try this place for a very long time. We were looking for a place for a late lunch (around 3pm) and decided to try Turquoise. There was only one server and the poor guy was running around doing everything and the restaurant was not empty. We started with the hummus and I have been thinking about it since we left it was SO good. The bread was fresh and amazing. There was a sign that said they bake it fresh and I believe it. With the hummus he brought out some red cabbage and yogurt dish that I don't know the name of. Also really really good. For entrees my boyfriend had the Gorgonzola chicken and it was so tender and melted in your mouth and I had the pide which was a Mediterranean pizza. It had lamb and cheese on it and was fantastic.

2012-09-05,5.0,"Turquoise is another consistent restaurant on my list of places to dine out (I've probably been at least 20 times). Quality food that doesn't disappoint, affordable and close to home make this spot a real winner. First, let's start with their bread. A full loaf (fresh taken out of the oven) arrives at your table and is so good it's almost sinful. No need to dip it in the accompanying sauce/dip because it's delectable on its own. I have tried at least half of their menu and always find the mujver (zucchini pancakes), chicken kebaps, and eggplant dished to be authentic...as good as I tasted in Turkey. The ossobuco, while not really a traditional Turkish dish, is excellent: tender fall-off-the-bone meat, creamy polenta, and wonderfully flavored with herbs. I really enjoy Turkish baklava because it's served usually with pistachios. Though Turquoise's baklava is made with walnuts, it's extremely good (mouthwatering, not dry over cloyingly sweet). The only thing that could make this place better is if they feature icli kofte on their menu. Recently I went to brunch and found it to be a steal. For $14, you get an 8-course meal (including champagne) that will fill you up. We got there at 11 am and didn't leave until 4 pm, so it's definitely a great place to catch up and linger. Several reviewers describe service as inattentive; truthfully, the restaurant's approach is quintessentially Turkish, meaning a meal is an event that goes on for hours. It's not rushed and they encourage you to really enjoy your meal and time with your dining companions. Not a bad thing in my mind.",0.9915,0.785,0.175,0.039,0.555952380952381
2012-09-02,5.0,"We tried this restaurant tonight and were pleased all the way around: great food, good service, and moderate prices.  I had the imam biyaldi--roasted eggplant with vegetables and rice pilaf--and it was delicious. The two other members of our party were very pleased with their dinners, and afterwards we had the baklava--freshest I've ever tasted; it literally melted in my mouth--and Turkish coffee.  (Note: when ordering the same coffee in Greektown, do NOT make the mistake I did once and ask for Turkish coffee--they will yell at you. Call it ""Greek coffee."" Same product, but the whole Cyprus issue makes some people a little edgy. Just an FYI !!) We had a really good waiter: he was attentive without being intrusive, and he was well-informed about all the dishes and was able to help us choose our entrees.  The menu includes some Italian dishes; I think the restaurant is going for a Mediterranean vibe, which is smart. The range of choices will appeal to anyone who wants authentic Turkish food as well as the person who would like something a little more mainstream. They are able to broaden their patron base while addressing people who enjoy Turkish cuisine. I liked the decor--white tablecloths, lots of wood paneling, clean bathroom--it seemed sort of 1920's Turkish. You can also be seated outside, weather permitting.  We're from the South Side, where parking is abundant and free, and I wondered how tricky it would be to find a space. But there was ample street parking, though metered. Roscoe Village is a nice area and there are lots of interesting little shops, so you can park and then browse your way to the restaurant.  If I have one complaint about Turquoise, it's that making a decision is really hard--everything sounds good and doesn't disappoint.

Also we had the most amazing hummus I've ever had, but no pita chips or veggies?  When we received our hummus after sitting alone with the bread basket for thirty minutes, clearly we had already eaten most of the basket. When we asked for more, they said they were out - but then I saw them serve several other tables the bread they were 'out' of.  Hard to eat hummus without something to put it on - we couldn't finish it, and it was a shame, because it was delightful.

Well of course you are going to defend your cook, but they were disgusting. The rest of my seafood stew which was scallops, calamari, lobster, tuna and salmon were great. My friend's lamb plate was good too. All in all it's a cute place, the service was a little here and there as it seems like there wasn't much of a system for who was taking which tables.

HELLO?!"" I thought my cell phone service was bad so I kept asking! Finally she said ""Uh I have no idea what you're saying in whatever language!"" I was in shock. She is obviously working at a Turkish restaurant, why wouldn't she expect Turkish people to call in and speak Turkish? I have never had this problem at any other Turkish restaurant in the COUNTRY.

I order the same main course every time - the yogurt kebabs!  If you like garlic, you'll LOVE this dish!  Warning that it's not the best cut of lamb so you may want one of the other kebab dishes if you're particular about the meat.  The bread they bring to the table is delicious and always warm though their current accompaniment, while good, is not as tasty as the bright pink cabbage dish they used to serve.

2011-11-23,4.0,"Delicious! It has been many years since I was in the South of Turkey, and though I have sought out Turkish restaurants since I am not an expert on the cuisine either. Nonetheless, the food a friend and I experienced was absolutely delicious. Coming from the burbs after work on a Friday night, we did not have a reservation but we still were seated immediately.  Granted it was full shortly after our 6:30 arrival time.  We were treated to fresh bread and a side dish. I tried a Turkish white wine (the by-the-glass red was out). The mujver was our favorite of the two appetizers ordered. Personally, I tend to favor sigara börek over su böregi, but this was good.  He ordered the onion kebap. The lamb was tender and the sauce received two thumbs up and a big smile from him. He enjoyed the shallots but found he had to pace himself on the lamb since there was less of it in the dish. I ordered the patlicanli islim sarmasi and found myself very pleased. The meat was so tender. The eggplant and sauce were wonderful. A very rich and filling dish. Dessert was the Almond Parfait. A homemade ice cream style dish made at the restaurant easily shared. The Bacardi sauce is lit on fire and then poured over the sweet treat allowing the dancing blue flame to soften it slightly and make it even richer. He also had the Turkish coffee while I opted for the çay (Turkish tea, not listed on menu but available). And the tea kept coming... Atmosphere was comfortable not stuffy. Light not dark or too bright. Relaxed not rushed. We could hear the buzz of other conversations but never had difficulty hearing our own. The service was excellent and attentive. It was nice to also hear several other languages being spoken throughout. My main dish could've easily been shared between two people along with a salad and/or another dish to round it out. Parking is, well, city parking. They do provide valet service. Overall I enjoyed Turquoise Dining as did the friend who first recommended it to me. I will happily try other dishes on the menu.

2011-11-16,4.0,"After having a wonderful lunch in Sirince Village, Turkey during a cruise a few weeks ago I was inspired to try out some Turkish food here in Chicago. Turquoise Cafe was close by and had received very favorable reviews so I booked a reservation. Turquoise has a comfortable but rather simple decor; the only knock is tables are a bit close together so it can be noisy. The restaurant was rather full for an early dinner on a weeknight, so that was a good sign.  Turquoise Cafe has a great menu; it is always a pleasant problem when it is hard making selections because so many dishes sound appealing. They started us off with some still warm bread that was quite tasty and set the tone for the meal; the bread comes with a yogurt, carrot and horseradish spread. For appetizers we split the grilled calamari which was nicely presented and accompanied by some hearts of palm, potatoes and a small salad as well as an order of hummus. Both appetizers were great; the really thin pita bread (also served warm) was excellent as well. In Turkey I had really enjoyed a dish called Pide (which resembles a cross between a quesadilla and pizza), so I chose the cheese and egg Pide for my entree. This was pretty good, but not quite as delicious as the Pide I had enjoyed in Sirince Village. My dining companions enjoyed their meals as well. The portions were quite generous and two out of three of us brought leftovers home; we were all too full for dessert. Pricing was very reasonable for the quality of the cuisine, and if you take advantage of a  restaurant.com  certificate it is a great deal.  Service at Turquoise Cafe was decent; despite the restaurant being busy our server was attentive, though on the quiet side. The meal was well paced and water glasses were kept full. There is a full bar with some nice cocktail options and several very reasonably wines by the glass available. They also have a selection of $20 bottles of wine from Argentina for the budget conscious.

2011-10-18,4.0,"This is really a 4.5 star place, but in my grand tradition of rounding down, 4 is what you get.  We were in on a Monday night. We arrived about 7 and there were only two other tables in the place. By the time 730 rolled around, they had a good Monday night crowd- which I took to be a good sign.  The food, from start to finish, was fantastic. Yes, the bread is good (and I consider myself a bit of bread snob). We ate it with their hummus, which was smooth and very good. We also had the Mujver- Zucchini pancakes with scallion, Feta cheese, mint, fresh dill with creamy yogurt garlic sauce. The yogurt sauce was so good- fresh and delicious without that tart bitter tang you sometimes get from yogurt sauces. I could have licked the plate. One of us got the Mix Grill which is a mixture of skewered chicken, beef medallion, salmon, sea scallop, spicy shrimp, and rice pilaf. The other got Risotto Del Presidente, which had carnaroli rice, jumbo shrimps, sea scallops,  shallots, garlic, sun dried tomatoes, shitake mushrooms, white wine and shaved parmesan cheese. This dish was fantastic, though the shrimp weren't jumbo and there were only 4 of them. The two scallops, though, were huge and delicious.  We looked at the dessert menu, but they brought us a complementary flan before we could decide on anything. It was delicious. Their wine list was reasonable as well.  The service was just ok. They weren't packed because it was a Monday night, so our waitress's inattentiveness wasn't a deal breaker. We were able to easily flag her down if need be.  We asked her what she would recommend from the traditional Turkish menu, and you would have thought that no one had ever asked her that before. I overheard another table ask their waitress the same question and she too was totally thrown off guard. My husband said maybe it's a cultural thing- and I think he had a point. All in all, our service was ok (and the free dessert was totally appreciated) but that may not be the case on a Thursday-Saturday, so I can definitely understand some of the other reviews on here about the service.",0.998,0.784,0.206,0.01,0.6029772079772081
2011-10-10,3.0,"I would give Turquoise Cafe a solid 4+ stars based on their dinner service. Their food is delicious, the bread actually is some of the best I've had in my life, and service and ambiance is varied enough to make any hiccups minor in comparison to the positives.  They also do a brunch. And the brunch is such a hit or miss affair, I go back for it, and often regret it, expecting the experience I've had 2 times before. They serve the same dishes, and it is always the same servers, so unless the kitchen staff varies week to week, or month to month, or maybe, even hour to hour, there is a huge problem. It is $13.95, and for that small price you get enough food in what feels like a dozen courses to feed a small family. Great deal. And the food is delicious. However, when you get 7 plates set in front of you at once, it is overwhelming, and tough to enjoy. Especially when you have been there before and know their timing and service spaces the plates. Similarly, when the glad-handing server informs you the kitchen is slow, and asks you if ""you're in a hurry"", say yes. Don't be polite. Don't be laid-back, devil may care, or laissez-faire. Say yes. I made the mistake of being in a good mood, and saying no, and I watched 2 couples who sat down a 1/2 hour after us get the actual Turquoise brunch full serve, I looked forward to their crepes, and of the 7 courses we received, crepes weren't included. And I saw them served to the people after us who were there for brunch service. The server brought us the end fruit plate, and well, that""s the end. They forgot about us.  I wanted the crepes, but my boyfriend was livid, and I couldn't blame him. We were there for 2 hours, and we had 3 servers. And I was ready to be done with the meal, because it wasn't good. It didn't help matters when my boyfriend went in to get change on our bill (waited 20 mins before he went in) and there was no host/hostess, and our server was caught at the bar enjoying a cocktail. Evidently he seemed taken aback and embarrassed. Turquoise Cafe is capable of so much better, and clearly they can do it if they put themselves to it,",0.9796,0.814,0.128,0.058,0.478956228956229

For my entree I had the lemon chicken with white wine, capers and greens with a side of rosemary potatoes...OOOOMMMGGG, best chicken I've ever had, so tender I didn't need a knife to cut it. The potatoes were cooked perfectly with a little crispiness on the outside. My hubs ordered the OssoBuco Short ribs which fell apart on top of cheesy polenta.

The front opens up to a comfortable outdoor patio that still feels slightly cut off from its surroundings to maintain that intimate feel.  The Fare:  All food and drink was prepared perfectly. This is the reason why people love Turkish food.  The Service:  It was slightly slow due to large party being catered, but the manager was much more hands-on with our experience than I'm used to and took great care of us.  I felt there was a subtle foreign elegance and comfort captured here that really made for a complete Turkish experience.",0.9834,0.753,0.237,0.01,0.5444862155388471

We were pleasantly surprised to find out that they had several wines on special for $20 (and after killing two bottles I can say that both of our picks were great).   We shared a few apps (mussels were great, caprese salad good too) and all of our entrees were delicious - the only weird thing we ate was the dip for the INCREDIBLE bread. The dip - not so incredible. Kind of gross actually, although opinions at the table were varied, from iffy to inedible.   The real reason for the three star review was the service.  While all of our food came out and came out correctly, our server was constantly MIA and when she was there she was nearly mute. You can't work at a loud restaurant and have the worlds quietest voice - just doesn't work.

We finally flagged him down and just asked for our tab. He came with our tab which he threw at our table.  No apologies on the wait or poor service. 2 other tables around us were asking for the manager and had not ordered either.  Overall, a bad night for Turquoise- but as I said, service has been an issue on most occasions.

We got complimentary bread and dip and ordered some Biohof Pratsch gruner veltliner, which is my favorite white wine.  And you can't find it most places (white whine).  I ordered the manti (veal stuffed ravioli) in yogurt, chili oil & tomato sauce.  The ravioli seemed hand-made and were delicious.  The sauce came deconstructed so I carefully mixed it together trying to make sure no veal escaped its pasta pocket :)  Overall the dish was rich but not overpowering and quite a steal at $13.  My friend ordered the steak kebab plate which was also very good.",0.9376,0.786,0.155,0.059,0.5066049382716049

We finished our meal fairly quickly, I mean, it was only a salad! So a friend called to see where we were and he was in the area so he showed up to join us.

The glass of champagne was a great touch.  To top it off, this brunch is incredibly affordable ($13.95) for all the courses you receive.

The bread wasn't quite as good as the now-defunct Istanbul Restaurant, but it was good.

There were three vegetarian entrees on the menu and three of us so we ordered all three of them. My favorite was basically a pile of perfectly roasted vegetables on a bed of some of the best hummus I've ever had. I'm usually not a big hummus person since it's usually kind of heavy, but there was something light and heavenly about the hummus here.

Ah, but the kitchen had one more treat left for me--the risotto del presidente.  Like I said, there were so many intriguing choices, but I finally opted for this risotto with shrimp, scallops, shallots, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, shitake mushrooms, white wine, and shaved parmesan cheese.  In a word, phenomenal. Sadly, I disobeyed my mother and filled up on bread; consequently, I did not have room for dessert, the selections of which included rice pudding.  I will definitely try that upon my return. Our server was moderately kooky in an endearing way, although I wish that he would have come around a little more often in the second half of the meal.  And the space was uncomfortably loud and the tables a bit too close together.  Other than those minor points, I don't have a single negative thing to say about our experience.  I look forward to returning.",0.9938,0.803,0.163,0.034,0.5126347057198121

The infamous fresh bread did not disappoint. It was piping hot and remained warm throughout the meal. For entrees, we had the risotto presidente, Turquoise mixed grill, and  salt covered sea bass. The sea bass had a really nice clean flavor and it was deboned tableside.  The mixed grill came with every possible type of meat and seafood.

Needless to say, I was very impressed.  The second time?  EVEN better.  We went with the zucchini pancakes again and a seared tuna salad. Their salads are the type of salads that make you want to eat salads. The bread came with a roasted eggplant spread this time. I read that the eggplant was one of their better spreads.

Certainly there are some spinoffs on the menu, as well as items that are more of Turkish ""influence"" or mediterranean style, but even those items are executed beautifully and full of flavor.   My recommendations: Appetizers: Lamacun (turkish pizza w/meat - squeeze lemon over it with parsley and red onions and make a little sandwich), Su Boregi (cheese, butter and thick sheets of dough =heaven), arugula salad (with a thick balsamic reduction, pears and walnuts), and eggplant salad (smokey, rich flavor with garlic and yogurt) Entrees: Osso Bucco Short Ribs - By far the most amazing short ribs, and for the quality and price, you cannot beat it.  Onion Kebab - this is not very traditional, but is very flavorful and the sauce is amazing (pomegranate infused)  - not for you if you don't like a sweet/tangy sauce with your meat.  Lamb kebob - generous portions of lamb cooked perfectly, not gamey at all Dessert: Kazandibi (a thick milk custard), baklava (one of the best versions I've had), and cream caramel (think love child of flan and creme brulee) If you are going to go to any Turkish or Med-inspire restaurant, Turquoise is great - it's unpretentious but pleasant inside, with great attentive service, and outdoor seating available.",0.9971,0.763,0.221,0.015,0.5967652445593621

Also, we were able to get a table in about 10 minutes without a reservation at about 7:30 on a Saturday night. THE MEH... I had the creamy lentil soup, which didn't really have a ton of flavor. To be honest, it wasn't until I looked up the menu to get the names of the dishes correct that I realized the soup supposedly had mint. But it wasn't a bad flavor. Also, the French martini (I know, an odd choice for the cuisine) was decent. THE BAD... Everything about the service was horrendous.

We weren't ever asked about a 2nd drink, our appetizer came at the same time as the soups (and we had to wait for the bread that goes with it), and our server disappeared for long stretches, including quite a while after we got the entrees. The last problem was compounded by the fact that the braised Colorado lamb shank was incredibly under-seasoned, and there was no salt on the table (which normally I wouldn't have a problem with).

As my table-mates had also planned on ordering those items we had to go back to the drawing board and asked for a few more minutes, which due to the lack of pep in our waitress was boarding on 15 by the time she sauntered back over. My meal, when it finally came, was nothing special.  One last trivial complaint, the drinks were on the opposite end the spectrum from our waitress, while she was not trying hard enough they were trying way too hard.

I guess part of the problem was that I came in with some expectations - never a good thing - and so in a way I felt a little let down. We started with bread, and they serve it with some type of sauce, which didn't look very appetizing but tasted fantastic. There was not a ton with respect to selection on the menu, but we did REALLY enjoy the zucchini fritter appetizer...I would definitley recommend getting that!

Nice char on the calamari.

Weekdays they are much slower so there is no problem getting a seat. The place is small and I really like the ambiance.  Its very cozy and the candles on the table add a nice touch. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Both times the service has been really good.  Because the place is smaller, there are only a couple of servers so the pace is a little slower.  It is actually very nice and you don't feel rushed and really have the time to enjoy your food and your company. When you sit down you get delicious warm toasty bread and a beet spread.   The menu offers a nice variety of chicken, beef, seafood and vegetarian dishes.  Last time I was here they had a 5 course meal deal that was really wonderful and offered a nice sampling of food. This time they did not have the same option, but we still had a good variety and had plenty of leftovers to take home! We started with 2 glasses of Riesling and appetizers: Lahmacun -  seasoned ground beef and seasoned vegetables, homemade fresh dough, parsley leaves and lemon wedges.  Like a Mediterranean quesadilla...you can't go wrong! and Mujver - zucchini pancakes with scallion, Feta cheese, mint, fresh dill with creamy yogurt garlic sauce.  You get 3 fluffy pancakes, which were more dough than zucchini, and also tasty. I would have liked more veggies... For our main courses we had: Chicken Gorgonzola - pounded chicken breast, roasted red bell pepper and creamy Gorgonzola cheese.  DELISH!!! Let me clarify and say that the chicken is DROWNING in this amazing, artery clogging, cheesy goodness.  Be prepared to dip everything you can get your hands on into this sauce.  You have been warned.  Oh, and we ended up taking most of this home including the sauce...the sauce was not as impressive the next day.  Eat this on site. and Turquoise Mix Grill - a mixture of (4) skewered chicken pieces, (2) beef medallions, (1) salmon piece, (2) sea scallops, (2) spicy shrimps, and rice pilaf with a small cabbage salad. It was tasty and offered a nice variety, but it was nothing out of the ordinary.  The pilaf was very good and the scallops also stood out on this dish. This tasted good the next day. Dessert...ok, so we were stuffed, but the BF really wanted to try their dessert.  Luckily the waiter brought us 2 free mini baklava to try and they hit the spot and provided that after dinner sweetness we were craving. We did share a cappuccino and it was really nice!

2009-11-18,3.0,"Okay, I've never done an update before.  Unfortunately, I have to do this one after last Sunday's brunch experience.  Wife and I had bought a gift certificate on  restaurant.com  for half off at Turquoise.  We figured ""hey- we love the brunch, we could invite another couple, and that would get us to the $60 minimum for using the $25 gift cert""  (which was being offered on  restaurant.com  for $10.  We figured it was a free $15 at a place we would probably go back to anyway. So we finally got around to using the certificate and invited another couple and looked forward to it all week. The service sucked.  There, I said it.  I've seen other issues with the service, but it's never happened to me, so I just brushed it off as picky Yelpers.  This time it took a long time to get anything done- here's an actual quote from my friend Pete- ""I'd fight someone for coffee right now.""  Now, Pete's a caffeine-addict, but he shouldn't have to fight anyone on a Sunday morning, especially when the place is half empty. Here's the kicker- they didn't take the gift certificate!!!  The waiter came back with the check saying he can't take the gift certificate, since it's not good for the Sunday brunch.  NOWHERE on the certificate did it say anything about brunch exclusion.  There was a food minimum, one per party, etc...., but no brunch exclusion anywhere.   Now we were pissed.  We paid, left our 10% tip for the bus boys and walked out.   The food is still really good, though.  Still can't complain there.",-0.7491,0.786,0.1,0.114,0.4255357142857143

2009-11-09,2.0,"We had a reservation for 6:30. We called and said we were running about 10 minutes late and the host asked how big the party was and we said ""two"". We got to the restaurant and said we had a reservation for two, gave our name, and the guy couldn't find it. He finally seemed to find it and just pointed us in the direction of the tables. Didn't walk us there with menus or anything. So we just went to a table for two and sat down. Then a waitress came over as soon as we sat down and asked if we had a reservation. We said we did and that the guy told us to just sit down. She asked who had told us that and then she went and talked to him. Then the manager-type guy came and asked if we had a reservation. Again, we said we did. Then finally someone brought us menus. Just dropped them off, didn't say anything. A busboy brought us waters. He spilled water on the table and didn't clean it up, just left it there. Then we were brought bread and some kind of spread, which were both delicious. The manager-type guy came back and took our order. As he walked away he asked if we wanted anything to drink. My BF said a Coke as the guy was already walking away. I was like, ""I guess I don't get a drink."" Well, neither did he. When our dinner was brought he asked again for the Coke and the guy just never brought it. We never got a water refill, never got asked if our food was okay. I know they were busy but the tables around us all had full water and their drinks. They came by to take our plates and clear the area. Towards the end of the meal I was eating my ice just to have some extra liquid. My water glass was sucked dry. The manager came back to ask if we wanted anything else and my BF said ""just the check"". When the guy brought the check he brought him a mini-coke and said that he realized he never brought it and this one was on the house...then he refilled our waters, apologized and said they were short-staffed.  I can understand being short-staffed. I was a server for a couple of years. I understand busy too. I don't understand, however, how every table around us had full drinks and water. This wasn't just bad service; it was negligent service. From start to almost-finish, we felt ignored and like we had somehow ""crashed their party"".   It's a shame too as the food was really delicious. We had the grilled calamari, short ribs and a lamb dish and they were all full of flavor and really prepared well. Too bad we'll probably never be back.",0.9653,0.898,0.073,0.029,0.45833333333333337
2009-11-07,5.0,"Stopped in here on our Friday Date Night as we continue to explore our new neighborhood of North Center!  The place was quite crowded, so we were led to a downstairs area that we didn't even know existed - we were the first table to be seated down there, but the area was full within another half hour.  A very busy restaurant, to be sure! We passed on drinks, so the first thing we tasted was the bread.  Obviously fresh-baked, steam came pouring out when we cracked it up.  It was truly amazing - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with such a delicious flavor of toasted sesame.  We devoured nearly the entire basket, and today I'm wishing we had asked for more and heated it up in the oven for breakfast.... For our appetizers, we got the Mujver (zucchini pancakes) and the caprese pesto.  The mujver were wonderful - also hot and crispy, with a wonderful flavor of all the vegetables within.  They were great with the yogurt sauce that surrounded the plate.  The caprese pesto - well, maybe it was our mistake for ordering it, but it wasn't very creative or special.  It was much like a caprese salad you'd get anywhere else, though there was a sort of tomato-jam atop the cheese that was unique and probably the best part of the dish.  Otherwise, unless you love caprese, save it for an Italian restaurant and try something more special here. When our entrees arrived, we were nearly full from apps and bread, which is a shame because they were amazing.  We got the Onion Kebap, which was huge pieces of well-seasoned lamb, pearl onions, roasted garlic, and pomegranate seeds covered in a deliciously rich sauce.  We also had the Gnocchi with Oxtail Ragu - the gnocchi were like little heavenly pillows filled with cheese, but the meat....oh sweet lord.  It reminded me of a real bolognese sauce, the way it was seasoned.  The flavors of the meat were incredibly rich and absolutely succulent, the kind that you hate to swallow because it's so good.  The presentation was lovely as well, throughout the whole meal. Service was a bit slow, mainly because there seemed to be one waitress and one busboy in the whole restaurant.  They almost had zero busboys after I scared him to death - he reached for the bread basket to take it away and I pounced on it like Gollum and the ring, murmuring something like ""noooooI'MNOTDONE.""  He will not try to take my bread again. This place was really just so cool.  I've never seen such a unique menu before, and nearly everything we had was really special.  A little off on the caprese, but I'm guessing it's just one of those ""safe"" dishes they have to thrown on the menu and we should've known better for ordering it.  I'm sure we'll be back to try other dishes (and mostly to steal 40 baskets of bread)....",0.9989,0.716,0.233,0.051,0.5601930873359442

Also, they start you off with some delicious freshly baked bread, but serve it with some sort of orange dipping stuff that wasn't given an explanation.

The lunch menu during the week is not completely Turkish which would make it seem less authentic, but the dinner menu (and lunch on weekends) is pretty much strictly Turkish and it is pretty awesome.

2009-02-28,4.0,"I had come here for a quick lunch with my nephew.  After reviewing the menu, we were both disappointed that we did not have more time and a bigger appetite.  We informed the waiter we were in a hurry because we could tell this wasn't a place for a quick meal.  They served us fresh, warm bread sprinkled with black seeds (called ""blessed seeds"" in the middle east because they have been used there for centuries to treat all sorts of ailments), which I just love, along with a delicious, red cabbage spread (I thought it was beets because of the colour but the waiter told me otherwise).  We enjoyed our lunch and, although it wasn't quick, it was worth the bit of extra time. When a friend offered to take me out for my birthday, I opted to come back.  He was extremely hungry, so we quickly chose a wine from the $20 menu and the scallop appetizer.  The Merlot lived up to its description on the menu and was quite enjoyable for the price.  They served us their freshly baked bread, this time with a garlic, carrot yogurt spread.  My friend usually avoids bread because of the carbs, but finished most of it because he loved it and the spread.  They offered us more but we refused because we did not want to spoil our appetites. We had to wait over 20 minutes for the appetizer, which is a long time for scallops.  They were cooked perfectly and well seasoned, accompanied by a simple avocado sauce (it was suppose to contain wasabi but neither of us could detect it) and fresh endive and other greens.  The combination worked very well together and I'd gladly have it again. We did not have to wait as long for our entrées. The Yogurt Kebap, which I recommend, was lamb served over pide covered with a garlic yogurt and sautéed tomatoes.  The pide turned out to be the delicious bread, roasted like bread cubes for stuffing.  My friend had ordered the Beef Kebap, but was disappointed about the amount of meat, especially compared to the generous serving of lamb I had.  But he enjoyed the beef, which was medium-well.  They did not ask him how he liked his meat, and, although he likes it that way, I would have preferred it medium-rare.  It was still juicy, however, and flavourful.   Neither of us had room for dessert, but ordered the Turkish coffee which was strong but not bitter.   I saw a lot of reviews complained about the service, but other than the long wait for the appetizer, we had no problems.  They kept refilling our water goblets throughout the evening as well as or wine goblets.  The bread was served well before our appetiser had arrived and the waitress answered all our questions and was helpful.

Turquoise has been on my list for many years...yet I never had the push to make it in until last night. Luckily at the suggestion of a colleague, we ended up here for a cozy respite from the winter chill... Appetizer: Caprese. Healthy portions, fresh...well presented. Beautiful plate.  Bread and sauce I can only imagine had beets in it due to the color: However, it did not taste like beets and was quite delicious. Warm, fluffy bread. Mmmm.  Glass of pinot noir (California) recommend by the server: smoooooth.  My only glitch of the evening was my entree: Chicken Gorgonzola. By the description I was ready for something quite fresh and lovely. What I got was 3 strips (a good portion) of semi-breaded chicken SMOTHERED in gorgonzola cream sauce, covered with mushy tomatoes. It looked like soup! It was just too heavy, and was not what I had expected. Messy, gloppy sad dish.  However, I do think my friends dish looked quite spunky (Turkish Delight), and the fliet that arrived to the table next to me caused me to salivate as I looked mournfully at my swampy cheese chicken. So, there are fabulous dishes to be had, most definitely.  Coffee and a complimentary honey cake (small, but perfect) ended the meal...and obviously, my only regret was the errant entree that made its way to my table.

The bread and dip that comes out piping hot as you sit down is the best.  I can easily eat this as a meal, and often eat so much that I can barely eat the real food.  The appetizer Lamagun (i think) is a pizza like dish with sauteed ground lamb that you eat on flatbread with onions and parsley with a splash of lemon.  Again, I can eat this as a meal in itself.  It's seasoned so perfectly and is the right combinations of spice, tang, sweet, and saltiness.  I order it every time I come here and no one has said a bad thing about it.  I've tried other appetizers, but get the Lamagun and the complimentary bread (i always ask for more to eat with my meal) and you're good til the meal comes out. Entrees that I've tried that are always good:  Onion Kebab (order it was rice or else it's too flavorful by itself), Filet Mignon, Leg of Lamb, and Beef Kebab.  Everything is always seasoned perfectly and the meat is always tender.  In my opinion, the meat here is better than most expensive steakhouses.   Everytime but once when we actually ordered dessert, they have sent out complimentary chocolate cake to us, not quite sure why- no complaints!

2008-12-20,4.0,"My wife and I have visited Turquoise twice for dinner...we went fairly early on both occasions, and therefore the restaurant wasn't very busy.  On the first visit, we sat outside and enjoyed people-watching on Roscoe.  For our second visit, we sat indoors in the comfortable dining room. Being big fans of mediterranean cuisine (and particularly Greek food), my wife and I both enjoy restaurants that offer very fresh ingredients in traditional dishes, and I beleve Turquoise readily fits the bill.  From the yummy cream soups, to the terrific mediterranean style salads, to the generous Turkish entrees, this restaurant will satisfy those looking for something unique in their Roscoe Village dining experience. A couple aspects of the menu I'd recommend as being particularly good: 1) The salads are large enough that I'd recommend sharing them between two people; or, consider a salad instead of an entree.  They are very flavorful, and constructed of an abundance of high-quality fresh vegetables. 2) The portion size of the rack of lamb is gigantic for the price, and the meat itself was cooked to perfect temperature...it was unbelievably tasty and rewardingly tender, with terrific seasoning.  The vegetable pairings were, again, very fresh and delicious.  I would have to rate this dish a perfect 5 of 5...which is almost unheard of in my rating system.  This was, flat out, the best lamb dinner I've had outside of Greece...better than anywhere in Greektown (and I LOVE Greektown).  Throughout the meal, I kept commenting to my wife on the outstanding value of this dish (at around $24)...the number and flavor of the chops could certainly warrant doubly-high prices at other restaurants in my opinion. I noticed a lot of negative comments on service at Turquoise.  Since we went when the restaurant was relatively empty, our service was what I would call unremarkable (not terrific, but not bad).  To be fair, I do in fact remember that the first time we went the 'manager'-type guy that is referred to in many reviews below waited on us...he was a little slow, but not terribly so.  This type of laid-back (read: slow) service is common in Greece, where dinner is taken to be an event, rather than popping in and out, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is common of mediterranean restaurants in general.  That being said, it doesn't really translate well to the quicker American style of dining, and so I can certainly understand the frustration of other reviewers. I believe Turquoise offers very good value, and I strongly disagree with a couple of the reviewers who commented that the restaurant is 'a bit pricey'...I mean, seriously, I had the most expensive entree on the menu (the rack of lamb at $24) and it was absolutely gigantic.  The salads are priced typically for most restaurants in this dining range, and yet are larger and more flavorful in my opinion.  Most of the entrees are in the $15 to $19 range, so it beats me why folks are complaining...my wife and I dine out regularly, and I don't know of many restaurants that offer comparable value.  It would be a different story if the offerings were proportionally small, but this simply isn't the case. Overall, based on two trips, I think this is a terrific restaurant and we will certainly come back again.  I would highly recommend Turquoise to people seeking mediterranean style fare in Roscoe Village.",0.9947,0.828,0.141,0.03,0.5343125843454791

There was one small sign advertising their brunch menu (which we saw after we sat down).  This was slightly confusing.  The waitress came by the table with champagne after about 15 minutes and we were about ready to leave because we hadn't received menus and no one took a coffee order.  She didn't even explain that the champagne was included, just plopped it down and walked away.  When we signaled her back and said ""We didn't order this . . ."" she rolled her eyes and said ""You want brunch, right?""  and when we said yes, she said ""So yeah, that's brunch."" and walked away again.  It took one more server to explain that their brunch menu is fixed and the courses are brought out at $13/person.  OK, that's fine.  No issues there but would it have been that hard for someone to explain that right when they seated us?  Or given us a little print out explaining the brunch menu and what the various courses are? We asked for coffee and none was ever brought out.  Bread was brought out about 10 minutes after the champagne (after we'd been sitting for close to a half an hour).  Our brunch took more than an hour to come out which was really annoying.  Especially since everyone is getting the same courses so it's not like it's a surprise to the kitchen.  Plus, everything was sort of cold.  The yolks in the eggs were hard and a bit congealed.  The courses were good for the most part (other than the temperature) but I was really underwhelmed by the service.  Everyone could have been a bit nicer and a bit speedier.",0.8778,0.822,0.098,0.08,0.49618807118807123

It took him over 15 minutes to realize they were out of a dish we ordered before he came back to make new suggestions without letting us look at a menu! It took me 3 times to remind him to bring me a coke, we were left seated for ridiculous intervals with no water, no food, no sign of our guy, and lastly, I had asked him what a diner at an adjacent table was having because the dish looked positively AMAZING; it was some type of pita or roti bread with mounds of meat in large chunks on top... when my meal was (finally) delivered I was given something that resembled a pizza. It was yummy but clearly not what I asked for.

2008-07-28,3.0,"Like a couple of others, I too had been a part of the fantastic fez dinner last Friday, and if it weren't for the company, I would not have had as pleasant a memory of Turquoise as I do. My dish was pretty good: the braised lamb shank being very tender in a bit of broth with assorted vegetables, a very clean-dish and satisfying, but I agree with John B., not the type of flavor I expected for this type of cuisine.  Just mild.  The vegetables in the preparation, I thought, were also unexpected and strange for this type of dish: baby bok choy and brussels sprouts?  I still enjoyed them as I love those veggies, but strange nonetheless. The bread (probably the best thing about the experience other than the company) was made fresh and truly delicious.  I could have eaten that all night for my meal. As far as service goes, I seem to remember every so often I would lean back in my chair and nearly be blinded by the dishes that were being brought in or cleared right past my head.  I suppose with 6 people, servicing the table MAY be tricky (although a simple ""Pardon me,"" helps tremendously), but I didn't feel that we were so tightly squeezed that service would have spacial issues.  It just so happened that they didn't seem to care about personal space, and eyeballs or other body parts be damned while they were moving in and out. I understand, when a party of 12 becomes 6, that a server may be disappointed in the prospect of losing out on additional revenue, but wouldn't that be more incentive to work the table you've got?  And while we felt like we were being rushed out, when we finally had the bill ready to go, Daniel T. held it up in the air long enough to get a cramp in his arm before the server took it up.  Do you want us in or out? The worst disappointment, I think, was Chaviva being told there were no specialty coffees, being served regular coffee, and then finding out later on the dessert menu that they did, indeed, have specialty coffee.  If someone asked specifically about it, why would you tell her all you had was regular coffee?  Not to mention the fact that I don't think her coffee was ever refilled, and I got a refill myself after about 45 minutes.  Perhaps they are still unaware of the magnitude of Yelp!   Over all, I had a fantastic time with friends, and I think Daniel T. enjoyed his meal very much, so that counts greatly in the brotherhood of the fez.  I'm just not certain I'd be rushing back to Turquoise any time soon.  My eye balls are way too important.",0.9927,0.76,0.163,0.077,0.5249412393162394
2008-07-26,3.0,"A number of the reviews for Turquoise complain about how slow the service is. I went with a group on a Friday night, and they couldn't get us out of there fast enough. Granted, it took them more than two hours to get us out as fast as they could, but they tried. Our server was an older man who seemed to be the manager or owner. We thought our group would be larger than it was, which accounted for some of his impatience (and the reason some restaurants won't seat incomplete parties), but when it became apparent there would only be six of us, we gave up one of our tables, which left us with 8 seats for 6 people -- not excessive. It certainly wasn't bad enough for the bum's rush we got. Things started out poorly. When he took our drink orders, I asked if they served any traditional Turkish cocktails. He suggested ouzo. I didn't really want a shot, so I ended up settling for their house martini, made with blue curacao. Later, a friend asked me if I had any raki. Raki is an anise flavored liqueur -- similar to ouzo -- drunk with water -- similar to absinthe. If he had taken a moment to explain this -- rather than just calling it ouzo -- I would have ordered the raki. Another guest wanted a non-alcoholic beverage. He said they only had juice, soda, or coffee. A look at their online menu reveals that they also serve ayran, which is a yogurt-based beverage. This might not have been what my friend wanted, but it would have been nice if he had offered it. We're in an ethnic restaurant -- there's a good chance we might want some ethnic cuisine. The menu is pretty extensive, with both ""Entrees"" and ""Mediterranean Dishes."" The Mediterranean side is heavy on the kebabs (or kebap, as they spell it here). There are two braised lamb dishes: Lamb Begendi, which is listed as an Entree, and Braised Lamb Shank, a Mediterranean Dish. Yeah, confusing to me too. I had the lamb shank, which was very tender, and came with an interesting assortment of vegetables, including baby bok choy. I was surprised, though, at how mild the flavor was. I don't know a lot about Turkish food, but I expected it to be more in the spectrum of Greek and Middle Eastern food -- fragrant with some fairly assertive spices. This was not the case with the lamb. I don't know if Turquoise has ""dumbed it down"" for American palates, or if this is simply what Turkish food is like. The zucchini pancakes -- more like fritters -- I had as an appetizer were much more satisfying. They're made with scallions, mint and dill, and served with a garlic yogurt sauce. I highly recommend them. Another diner ordered the caprese, which is very different from an Italian caprese salad -- it's served with oven roasted tomatoes, arugula and olives, and looked delicious. It was big enough to share as an appetizer. A lot of people ordered kebabs, which looked like kebabs, and were served with what was called pilaf but looked like plain white rice. A note about the bread: it is excellent. It's freshly baked, and you can tell. They serve it with a baba ganoush-like spread. In our case, they didn't bring it out until after we had ordered. This may be standard. They may have learned that, given a chance, people will fill up on the bread. By this time, we were ready to go, and they were more than ready for us to go. When one of our party asked to see the dessert menu -- just to see what was on it -- you could practically hear our server's eyes roll back in his head. Interestingly, after he dropped the bill, it took him a good 15 minutes or more to pick it up. There's a lot to like about Turquoise. A number of the menu items looked intriguing, and the room is very comfortable. On a weeknight, when I have some time to eat and they have some time to serve me, I would try it again. But with several Turkish options in my own neighborhood, I'm not in a hurry to return.",0.9979,0.841,0.133,0.026,0.4958778258778258
2008-07-26,3.0,"I had the pleasure of honoring the great and holy FEZ at Turquoise Cafe yester-evening, and I have to say that if the company hadn't of been as wonderful as it was, I probably would have dwelled more on the poor service and the not-that-fantastic food. Now, don't get me wrong. It was a good meal. I ordered the Chicken Kabap, which I had assumed would be chicken on a skewer but when it arrived merely looked like it was on a skewer but was actually just laying on the plate in a misleading pattern. There was a weird bean side and some rice, as well as a delicious yogurt sauce. The chicken was well cooked and paired with the sauce was delicious. The bean side was sort of strange, having a sort of cheesy flavor. I'd hoped that there would be some type of special Turkish coffee, but the guy insisted that there was only regular coffee, so that's what I had with my meal. Also, for an appetizer we got the Caprese, which featured exotic buffalo's milk mozzarella as well as some other adornments (tomatoes, green olives, and some indiscernible sauce), and though I was hoping to be totally jazzed, the cheese merely had a sort of bland, dry taste.  The waiter was incredibly impatient with us, since we'd had reservations for 12 but only six had shown up. He seemed in a horrible rush to get us out, and he wasn't very patient or attentive.  The company, though, and the power of the fez allowed the evening to be outstanding. So, I'm going to have to give Turquoise three stars for now, and perhaps I'll go back and try out some of their desserts and hope for a better, more pleasant server.

2008-07-18,4.0,"One of my favorite summertime activities is rolling down Roscoe Street and getting brunch.  I love laughing at the chumps standing in line at KITSCH'N, ORANGE, and VICTORY'S BANNER on my way to TURQUOISE CAFE. Don't get me wrong.  There are Sundays when I don't mind waiting an hour or more for the opportunity to sit in a restaurant crammed full of crying babies.  But some Sundays I am so badly hungover that I just need sustenance.  And the Sunday brunch at TURQUOISE is just what the doctor ordered for that difficult day-after. The brunch isn't cheap - it's somewhere around 13-15 dollars.  HOWEVER, for that price you get a glass of bubbly and SEVERAL delicious platters of food.   The food is brought out family style.  First comes the champagne, then a delicious fresh-baked bread basket with butter and honey.  Then the barrage begins: salad, two egg dishes, crepes, spinach pie, and a plate of fruit.  Everything tastes amazing.  I usually stick to a vegetarian diet, but TURQUOISE is my special indulgence: one of the dishes is eggs over hard sprinkled with paprika and served with sliced red sausage.  Since it's part of the buffet and I don't like food to go to waste, I make the sacrifice. The sausage is fucking amazing. I have been here for dinner a couple times as well and it is also excellent. Complaints: they bring everything out all at once, and it's so much food that inevitably something gets cold before you can try it.  Patrons can't seem to figure out how to close the front door, so if you're sitting by the door during cold weather, expect to get up and latch the door unless a waitron passes by.  Sometimes they end the brunch early, and so I weep and beat my chest and then retreat sheepishly down Roscoe, returning to the hordes that I was mocking moments ago.",0.6991,0.81,0.108,0.082,0.6103883219954648

However if you have some time to leisurely enjoy a warm day, some good deep conversation, very good food and lovely company, meander over here.  I got to try this place with the lovely Xtie G. We had some time and some serious conversation to dish out and I suggested this place. I had a little drool factor going on and she was all for trying it. I will start off, the service is slow. Don't fool yourself. However it was fine by us, I think there was only one server for several tables and a large group of soccer fans in the back. I got there first and decided to chance the stormy clouds and sit outside. As I looked over the interesting menu, full of Turkish/Middle Eastern delights and Italian, I wished I could peruse a selection from the wine list... but alas..darn evening clients. Xtie strolled up to the table, we sat down and took a mere few minutes to decide our meals. They started us off with some warm and tasty bread, (think soft, crispy, chewy), and a dish that resembled tzatziki sauce except with red cabbage instead of cucumbers and it still was quite good. We also went with the zucchini patties, fried into tender, crispy, brown patties, they were filled with zucchini, carrots, and I think potatoes. Served with a yogurt sauce the dish was quite delish. Then my gnocchi came out in the vodka, basil, tomato cream sauce and hers was the frittata that came with a size able side salad. My potato pillows were a little heavy, but not too heavy enough for me to almost finish the entire bowl. The frittata was crispy and savory goodness.  After our good long conversation, we got the bill. Honestly, for what we got, I was pleasantly surprised at the smallness of our bill. Very, very reasonable.

2008-04-09,3.0,"Have wanted to try this neighborhood spot for awhile now and did so this past weekend (Note: we did carryout...so that is what it is).  T.C. is an eclectic Mediterranean upscale dining experience. Not Mediterranean in the way Greek food is but more...I don't know...Turkish. We ordered 3 entrees, 3 sides, and an appetizer. Let me start by saying they give you bread...lots of bread. Enough bread to settle the stomachs of 1000 drunks.  That is an exaggeration but this bread was big. big bread.  It was seasoned exceptionally and was baked fresh (maybe not fresh that minute but within two hours of our consumption).  The appetizer we went with were the mussels. Let me tell you these were the biggest flippin' mussels I have ever eaten! Gargantuan!  And for only $7 dollars these were well worth the price because the were great.  Delicious tomato white wine sauce. Now I know why they gave you so much bread because you literally wanted to dip as much bread as humanely possible into that sauce.  Muscles...they rocked. Entress...ehhh...wasnt as solid but they were good. Salmon was cooked well. Good portion size and the gnocchi (i think they were gnocchi) we tasty.  The seafood risotto was good as well. The scallops weren't the best I have ever eaten but were just OK. The lamb and eggplant weren't quite up to par with the rest of the meal however. It had a really distinct smokey flavor that I didn't much care for.  The eggplant was not good at all. The lamb chunks were strewn on top of it and it was extremely mushy. Skip the lamb. NOTE: we ordered three sides (two spinaches and a rice pilaf) between three people. Sides were really large and probably should have only ordered two. Spinach was good. Rice was huge...does medi food entail tons of carbs or what? In summation,if you are in the neighborhood and are in the mood for something other than Sushi or Italian food give this place a try.

Good place for Sunday morning brunch: + fairly priced + food very low on the nonsense scale (contrast w/places like Bongo Room) + particularly filling considering the price - often understaffed on Sunday morning The Turkish breakfast (served until 2 pm) is a generous prix fixe offering which, on the whole, has balanced and accessible flavors.  If memory serves me right, this is the roster (all done in Turkish style): crepes, hash browns, scrambled eggs w/feta, poached eggs w/vegetables, feta cheese pie, fried egg with salami (very similar to Spanish chorizo), light bread with toasted sesame, salad, a mixed fruit plate, a glass of champagne, and coffee or tea.  As you can see, most if not all of it is rather heavy fare, making liberal use of eggs.  Overall the dishes tended towards a shade on the salty side, but not unexpectedly so given the ingredients.  Flavors are not overpowering and their strength is suitable for the portions given.  I particularly liked the cured sausage dish and the crepes.  One minor suggestion is that the crepes might be introduced later (they're brought with everything else) so that they may retain their warmth by the time you need something sweeter to break up the other flavors.

I walked in and they had a heat lamp at the front warming the section where you checked in for dinner.  The place was really busy.  We had made a reservation, but it was kind of difficult to figure out how to check in...the host was racing around trying to do more than be a host and he was a little frazzled when we first walked in. That did not make a difference.  By the time the third person in our party showed up, we were seated and ready to eat.   They brought out bread and some cabbage salad for us to start with.  The bread....Oh my god!  I could have eaten the entire basket.  It almost melted in your mouth it was so soft and fresh.   We ordered an appetizer: Patlican Salatasi (No..I didn't' remember that, I have another window open with the menu...I want to be exact!! ) and it was very tasty.  It came with smoked eggplant and other veggies flavored with delicious spices.  Especially with that bread!!  Yum... I ordered the Chicken Kabop, which came with delicious rice pilaf, a white bean salad, and yogurt sauce. The chicken was cooked perfectly and all of the flavors complimented each other.  Very light and tasty.  My friend Steffie had the steak Kabop, which came with the same sides...she enjoyed hers as well.  My friend Lora ordered the Lamb Begendi (again...copied it from the other window).  The lamb came atop a bed of pureed eggplant with mozzarella cheese.  Very rich, but oh so tasty. The only issue was that some of the customers kept forgetting to close the inside door so some of the cold air drifted in, but usually one of the staff was aware of that and made sure the door was closed.  Another issue is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find parking in this neighborhood!!  But that is another issue... They had a featured wine label that they were offering several varietals from for $20.  We ordered the Syrah.  It was good.  You can't beat a $20 bottle of wine!

The white linen on the tabletops looked sharper than we did, and good thing it was a lovely spring morning and we could sit outside, rather than leave dirt in our wake all over the restaurant. Although our usual fare post-softball includes sandwiches, fries and beer, the Turkish prie fixe brunch hit the spot like a Michael Barrett home run finding the bleacher basket. We started with a flute of champagne each (key learning: quenches the thirst as well as a pint of 312), then were heralded with baskets of bread and honey and fresh salad. Now, we're all starving because we've been playing softball and likely drinking the night before. So we were ready to dig in, but we might have bitten more than we could chew. Because, before we could quite clean off the salad, the bow-tied and vested waiters started to cart the following to our table, served family style on big platters (more major kudos for helping build team spirit by teaching us how to share and pass the plates around)... - Poached eggs with vegetable sauce (it seemed like a Turkish salsa to me) - Fried eggs with Turkish salami (more kudos for serving a platter sunny side up, another over hard, which is the only way I will eat fried eggs) - Turkish hash browns - Scrambled eggs with feta cheese and scallions - Crepes And when all was said and done, fruit platters and your choice of coffee or tea.
