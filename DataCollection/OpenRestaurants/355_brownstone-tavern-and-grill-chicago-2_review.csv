2017-08-29,3.0,"I got a chance to come here this past weekend to see the Mayweather-McGregor fight and it was a decent time. My buddy called and reserved a table for us to make sure we had guaranteed seats which was awesome!  Our server Courtney was definitely on point as she was always there to take our next orders and was good at making sure our bills were separated properly. I had some pretty good beers as well as a bunch of makers mark/ginger ale...I think a shot showed up at some point as well. We were here for about 5+ hours so food was needed. I got the fish tacos which came in a set of 3 along with a bowl of cilantro rice. You can choose 3 different tacos, but I went with 2 shrimp tacos (Courtney recommended) and one sauteed tilapia. The Tilapia taco was pretty decent, but the shrimp tacos were surprisingly meh....wasn't very flavorful and was just plain weak. The cilantro rice was the antithesis of flavor and taste...I had to use my buddy's ranch dressing from his wings to help out there. Later in the night while the fight took place I got hungry again from all the liquor I was drinking so I decided to order 3 sliders (1 mini burger and 2 smoked brisket sliders) and they were much better than the tacos and rice. Pretty good service, decent bar grub (minus the rice) and good service. Definitely the place to check out a big sporting event.",0.9878,0.786,0.18,0.034,0.5411081716637272

We also tried the tacos and have to say they were excellent.  Cocktails were also excellent, their Manhattan was spot on!  We also got to meet one of the new owners, who was a very down to earth guy.

Brownstone used to belong to Four Corners Tavern Group (I believe it's called) and as far as I can tell all of their restaurants/bars are top-notch. Since around the beginning of the year or so Brownstone has had different owners and unfortunately it's painfully obvious with the food. The atmosphere is still nice and the drinks are still good but the food has gotten awful. And I don't only mean to say it's not as good, I'm saying it's terrible. In the past decade or so my wife and I have prolly been in there upwards of 50 times, whether it was for food and drinks or simply to stop by for a skillet cookie after having dinner elsewhere.

This time, it's one star instead of two stars and I'll describe my experience in more detail. We used to go here all the time for the past several years. It was a great place that had games on TV but was still somewhat upscale. They had excellent chips and queso which were one of the main reasons I stopped being a vegetarian. Their service was pretty decent. But the best thing about it was everything on the menu was good. Even their fish tacos, which a place like Chicago should not have good fish tacos. What happened to the food here is borderline illegal. The place changed management and the food is terrible. Do a Google search. Yelp should honestly wipe out reviews when a place changes management because anything before November 2015 does not apply and is misleading.  Here's a nice detailed explanation of my last visit to Brownstone. Had a friend in town, wanted to show him good food and a casual spot. Took him to Brownstone. Ordered the chips and queso from our server who seemed disinterested in serving us. General mood was somber. This mood carried over to the food. Chips and queso show up, taste like melted Velveeta with miller lite poured in it. Chips are smashed and the tri-color type out of a bag from the store. We eat it. It's terrible. I ask myself ""do we have more toilet paper at home?"" I imagine the two other people in here are thinking the same thing. We ask how the fried pickles are. Server has little to no response to the effect of ""you know. they're fried pickles."" OK cool. Order them. Also terrible. Everything is frozen and reheated. This does not have the handmade touches of the previous establishment. The menus are laminated. You see the same at any Chili's in the burbs.

This is the first time we've eaten from Brownstone since the ownership changed, and we're hoping that this isn't a sign that the quality has declined.  We've experienced some great food and service from Brownstone in the past, but we won't be able to stay customers if they keep making food like that.",0.8779,0.83,0.123,0.047,0.5831105169340464
2015-12-21,2.0,"Brownstone gets 2 stars from me for their awesome BYO Bloody Mary bar on the weekends and for the genuine apology (and meal comp) my boyfriend, friend, and I received from the manager (or owner?) when it took more than an hour to get our food. If you want to read about the bloody mary bar, you can via the link in my bio on my website. So, I'll start here-- went to the Brownstone a few weeks back at the suggestion of my friend who lives a few blocks down. She said they had a great Bloody Mary bar (true!), so I was game. We arrived at Brownstone and there was maybe 2 more parties at tables and a few bar patrons. Perfect, we thought. Things should be rather swift and we can get on the train back to the suburbs in an hour and a half. Boy, were we wrong. We placed our drink orders and I was delivered my glass of vodka for the BYO Bloody bar rather quickly. Boyfriend and friend had coffees. I make my Bloody (by the way the Bloody bar is awesome-- they have beef straws and bacon) and we order our food. My boyfriend and I decided we would split the mac and cheese and Italian beef with sweet potato fries. So we wait and we wait. 30 minutes passes. We ask about our food. They say it will be out soon. We get a mimosa pitcher to ease the wait. Another 20 minutes passes... The manager/owner comes over and apologizes for the long wait. I tell him it's been nearly an hour at this point (I just don't get it? there were only 2 other tables and a few people at the bar who weren't eating) and he explains they have new ownership, etc. and that's the reasoning... He gives us a free mimosa carafe.. We wait maybe 10-15 minutes more and FINALLY the food comes to our table. It was just OK and wasn't even hot? Not quite sure why it took more than an hour to make mac and cheese and an Italian beef.. but... It was kind of ridiculous. I like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt when they have new ownership, but this was just unacceptable. The Italian beef was more like a short rib sandwich, as the beef slices were thick and not the classic thinly-cut beef that constitutes an Italian beef. The mac and cheese was decent, nothing too special. The only thing I really enjoyed were the sweet potato fries. Our waitress acted like she didn't want to be working.. That's fine with me but don't ignore us when the order and food is obviously screwed up! It was nice that the manager/owner gave us a nice, heartfelt apology and that he went through the steps to make us happy (free mimosas and comped some of our meal), but I don't think I would return to Brownstone for a meal. I recommend the BYO Bloody Bar.. but get food somewhere else before/after you go here :)",0.9924,0.791,0.148,0.061,0.5929888453697978

The smoked brisket sliders could have been good, but way to smokey!  I have been a BBQ judge for about 12 years, so I do know a little on this topic.  My friend had a burger, nothing special.  I also had ordered the Bloody Mary Bar, which is fun, but was very dirty at the presentation table.  Unfortunately, it looks like I will need to look for a new local place to watch the games, where they appreciate my business and serve me with a smile!",0.681,0.78,0.12,0.099,0.5141096681096681

When we arrived however, none of those things were actually on special. Instead they had 50 cent wings and a draft special. Both my friend and I were not at all interested in those specials, so that was a real let down. Our low priced dinner turned into something a little pricer.  We decided to get a couple sliders anyway, a taco, and their buffalo egg rolls. All of this was like basic bar food, but you can tell they tried to elevate it. The buffalo chicken egg rolls were absolutely delicious. I had a hard time splitting them with my friend, they were full of buffalo flavor. The slider was just okay, merkts cheddar is always great, but the bun was like a dinner roll at a cheap family easter, 3 for 5 I would pay for but not 3 for one.

My friend had 5 double vodka sodas and he too felt as though he had been drinking water and maybe a drink or two. (He had two shots).

2015-03-28,3.0,Came in on a Thursday night for my first night in Chicago - and it was so packed we had to leave. They don't take resos so if you really want to hang here you probably need to get here early (and rightfully so - its super casual and if they took reservations that would be just weird).  The food looked okay from our view by the door and there were tons of TVs if you are into that game watching thing. But five stars to the awesome host who tried his best to find us a table and keep us there.

I called and place a phone order for their (small, yet amazing) Barbacoa Bowl earlier today. I waited 15 minutes and went to pick it up - when I got there the woman seemed a little surprised when I said I was there to pick up an order. After seeing her run around for a few minutes, a gentleman approached me and stated that he had taken my phone order, but forgot to submit it. He was very apologetic and also mentioned my food would be free. I was fine with waiting (and with still paying) but he insisted it was on the house. So I sat at the bar and was offered a free drink from the bartender. Only had to wait about 10 minutes for my food while I enjoyed a nice beer.  Since I wasn't in a rush, I didn't mind having to wait, but the way they handled it made it all the more better!

2014-11-11,5.0,"This neighborhood bar is amazing. The food is delicious. My vegetarian friends used to specifically request that we go to Brownstone so they could get the portabella Southwest Salad Wrap, and there are other good vegetarian options as well. I love burgers, and although it's the ""healthy one,"" their turkey burger is my favorite burger on their menu, topped with avocado and chipotle aioli. Throw in the option of boneless chicken wings for an appetizer, and you've got three awesome choices right there. This isn't your typical ""bar food"" kind of place - it's GOOD food! And if you're looking to dine on a dime, then this is the place for you. Their specials are ridiculous. Mondays: $10 for ANY burger plus ANY beer on the menu? Grab yourself a Bison Burger and a Pumking and you've just cut your bill in half. Later in the week, $3 fish tacos? 50-cent wings? I literally can't even. Their beer selection is pretty solid, with great seasonal beers (I'm a sucker for Pumking, sorry), and they make some mean cocktails as well. Nothing to complain about when it comes to the menu or prices. It's kind of dark inside, so if you're looking for a very sunny spot, then this isn't necessarily the place for you on a summer afternoon... BUT, they also have outdoor seating, fully decked out with hot torches to keep it reasonable even in Chicago's roughest fall weather. So honestly, there are great options for ambiance for any time of year. And finally: the staff is wonderful. Having been to Brownstone several times over the last couple of years, I have been personally approached by both the last owner and the current owner while dining there, so management is always checking in to make sure you're enjoying your meal and everything is satisfactory. The wait staff is also incredibly friendly and patient, and always willing to acquiesce to your ridiculous order requests (""a side of barbecue sauce, hold the onions on the burger,"" etc.) with ACCURACY, which is always nice - they've never messed up any of my orders, ever. I've also been there with groups that get a bit rowdy (re: alcohol), but the staff has never been impatient or rude when dealing with the occasionally ridiculous patron (note: this bar is typically a slightly older crowd, maybe early 30s, so it's not full of drunk 20-somethings; you'll also see lots of families with kids on weekends, especially during brunch hours). The #1 selling point for me is trivia. The guy who runs it is HILARIOUS and incredibly personable, and runs a tight trivia game that never runs too long and always feels like the perfect amount of difficulty. Throw in the fact that trivia is on Mondays, during their $10 burger + beer special, and I have a hard time seeing why anyone would NOT go back to this place at least once a week. My only complaint about Brownstone WAS that I saw a few football games there, and the speakers were, in my opinion, way too loud. I mentioned this to the manager because my ears were kind of getting blown out during a Bears game; I have been to several games since then, and the volume has been fixed! The speakers seem to always be on a perfect setting now. You know a place is solid when management actually fixes something you consider problematic.

At this point the rest of the group had to start eating since our food was getting cold. Server noticed the tots and said there was a mistake and that we should keep them. Great! I would hope that these weren't going back to whichever table ordered them. Server said that she would bring the pear and goat cheese salad out right away. 10 minutes later the salad was out.

So basically talk about us while walking away but not to our face.

And that's pretty much all you need to know about Brownstone. Despite the name, this is the place to go to watch the game if you happen to be a Dallas Cowboys fan. Whenever there is a game on, this place is packed to the gills with Texans knocking back beers while cheering on their team. On those nights that the Cowboys aren't being shown on one of the many TV screens that cover the walls of this place, Brownstone is still a good place to grab a beer and chat to your mates, erm, friends. The buffalo wings are tasty with crispy skins, tender meat, and a fairly hot buffalo sauce. Extra points that they give you plenty of blue cheese dressing for dipping and napkins for wiping yourself down.  Portion sizes are pretty large (though on par for the US) so more than enough food to keep you happy. They have Blue Moon on tap as well as a number of lesser known beers and even more in bottle form behind the bar. There is also Miller Lite on tap but we won't penalise them too much for that. Special mention to the gorgeous blonde bartender who was happy to talk while she pulled some pints for us. Word to the wise, buy your bartender a drink. If she's going to be spending ages sorting out your order, the least you could do is make her feeling included! All in all, Brownstone is a good time to be had.

2013-01-27,2.0,"I've tried Brownstone twice in the last 3 months and both times my wife and I agreed that the food was below average at best.   There are too many other similar restaurants in the area that serve much tastier food for less money to really consider Brownstone again.  Rockwell's and Village Tap are 2 off the top of my head that are much better.  I'd include Daily Bar/Grill and Bad Dog Tavern in that list too and I'm not much of a fan of those places.  Bottom line - I don't think I'll ever intentionally go to Brownstone again. This review has nothing to do with service or delivery problems.  Quite frankly, the food is just tasteless and overpriced.  Today, my last visit, I ordered the buffalo wraps for our app and the steak quesadillias.  Super meh here folks.  The ""steak"" was little more than cube steak un-seasoned.  Absolutely no flavor in the meat.  Not to mention the ""juice"" from the steak left my quesadillias soggy on the bottom side.  Just a gross meal if I'm being honest. My wife got chili today - another meh.  We've also tried the steak tacos, pretzel bites and something else I'm forgetting.  All very forgettable and overpriced for what you're getting.  If I'm going to pay a premium for bar food, I'll drive further and hit up Revolution (Logan Square).

I didn't get much of a breadcrumb topping either. Bad night cuz it's busy busy? I hope so. The grilled onions were pretty perfect though and a good compliment to the dish. But more sauce damnit.

Never got food because (a) the cheating (yes, cheating) on the pints, and (b) they seemed wholly uninterested in serving food - some kind of ""bar menu"" on a Sunday afternoon.  Not interested.

Ok here's the thing, when I see Mac&Cheese on a menu, I almost always have to try it. Plus, it's smoked cheddar? Hell yes! Tell me where else I can find smoked cheddar mac&cheese. Go ahead...I'll wait. When you tell me I can add bacon, Andouille sausage, or grilled chicken for an extra dollar, done. I got bacon. Baked Parmesan Panko crumbs and scallions on top are also standard. If you have never enjoyed m&c with bacon, scallions, & panko crumbs...then you need to realign your priorities...NOW.

If Yelp had such a thing as ""Top 10 Elite Foodie Tips of the Year"", the following tip would fall into this category:   ***If you like mac 'n cheese, and you also enjoy spicy food, put Sriracha sauce on it! Yes, that red sauce with the rooster on the bottle. Game Changer, trust me.I asked the bartender if I could get Sriracha sauce on the side. No problem! I was surprised they had it. Whether you put just a little bit or a lot, I cannot stress how this sauce takes mac&cheese to the next level without overshadowing the taste of the dish itself. Just get it on the side and try a little for yourself. TRUST me. Pair this with a bottle of Bell's Two Hearted IPA and you might as well just loosen a notch on your belt and throw in the towel, because you will be consuming this combo for years to come.",0.9853,0.826,0.139,0.035,0.4733333333333334

The atmosphere at Brownstone is very relaxed and casual, very fitting for the north center/roscoe village neighborhood it inhabits. Today was the first time I sat on the patio and it had a great ambiance I loved how they had couches out for people to lounge it. It made me want to relax and stay all day!  The food at Brownstone is also delicious. My favorite would have to be the southwest salad turned into a wrap with their awesome fries but pretty much everything I've had has been good. They have $5 appetizers all weekend long which is pretty incredible. Today we tried out the boneless buffalo wings, reuben rolls and guacamole and hummus plate. Everything was really yummy and it was a great deal for a lunch in the city!  I've also played trivia at Brownstone before and they have a neat set up that I have not seen at other bars. All the trivia questions are up on the screens and it is very interactive. If you like playing trivia and would like to mix it up I'd definitely try Brownstone.

The corner bar is at a great location with outdoor seating. The menu had more craft beers than its other sister bars which is always a plus, and of course, daily specials. We snagged a table right away outside, there were about 10 tables. We knew that there was a $7 5oz craft brew tasting on Thursdays and $2.50 fish tacos. This alone, sold us. However, the craft brews you could choose from were limited to their draft list, not bottle list...bummmaaaa. The fish tacos are the way to go, my friends. Let me break it down for you. Fish tacos, $2.5 a pop, with a 2 taco minimum. Oh, so doable! But wait, there's more! You get to choose from tilapia, shrimp, or cod. Wow, I actually get choices for my cheap ass tacos? Count me in! But wait... You ALSO get a side of your choosing! Basically, you get an entire meal for $5 I got a shrimp and a tilapia taco. They were both great, not greasy, filled to the brim with cabbage, lettuce, and a tangy type of ranchero sauce. Better yet, they came with really good salsa with a spike of cilantro...uh sshheaayy!! I opted for the sweet potato fries which were in between stringy and regular size and not greasy at all.  Hands down, if you choose to come here on a Thursday, go for the tacos.

It's right down the street from my house and I'm sad to say that I don't go there that much. The allure of the patio was too much to resist on the gorgeous night last night so Mr. Quinn, Lori, and I headed over to grab some grub. We were lucky enough to be seated on the patio and our server, Amanda (all Amandas are awesome!), came over to take our drink order. I was delighted to see that they had a special Bloody Mary menu and decided to take a risk with the Bourbon Bloody Mary, made with Jim Beam instead of vodka. I drink bourbon like its water but I was a little apprehensive about mixing it with Zing Zang. Let me tell you -- DELISH! I think I'm converted. Mr. Quinn was happy with the huge beer selection and Lori was happy with the beer specials as I noshed on the yummy Mary accessories while waiting for our appetizer. The hummus and guac app is the perfect starter. Yummy, warm pita bread, veggies, and chips for the guac. I had the fish tacos (one of each:cod, shrimp, and tilapia), which were awesome. I'm originally from Cali and we do fish tacos right, so saying the Brownstone has good tacos is definitely high praise. Lori had the goat cheese and pear salad, which looked awesome and Mr. Quinn enjoyed his BBQ pork sandwich with sweet fries. Another score for Brownstone.

What keeps bringing us back to the Brownstone are the fish tacos!  They may be the best in the city.  They are served with either cod, tilapia or shrimp with a tasty cole slaw.  The salsa that the tacos are served with has a bit of spice to it and really adds to the flavor of the taco.  All together, these ingredients make for one heck of a taco!  They are also filling - they don't scrimp on the amount of fish in the taco, so it's definitely a good meal. Most of the portions of any dish at the Brownstone are pretty big - so bring your eating pants when you come here.  If you come for just drinks, they offer several different appetizers from sliders to baked soft pretzels to help your beer go down easily.

Anyway, it was half price bottles of wine night, so why not?  Burgers and Malbec.  Hey, I like Malbec.  Who knew?  I could actually tell that this was a very good Malbec, despite not having the palate to discern the difference between a Boone's Farm and a Cristal when it comes to wine.  It all gets you to the same high.  The only difference is how and where you land.  I digress. I ordered a tortilla soup and a burger with bacon and Merkt's.  I think someone had to run to 7-11 to grab a can of Campbell's tomato soup to make it, as it took 10 minutes to come out and tasted like canned tomato soup.  I've had tortilla soup.  This wasn't tortilla soup.  However, the chicken in the soup was very good, as were the tortilla slices.  Forgo the ""tortilla"" soup, folks. As for the burger, I found it to be strangely thick and the consistency to be oddly dense.  It seemed to be that they added bread crumbs to the mix.  The only burger I've ever had that was this dense was a Kobe burger I had at Paramount Room that absolutely sucked.  This burger wasn't that bad, but it wasn't the same burger I expected based on my experience at their sister location, Westend, which has a good burger.  The bacon topping was tasty, but the Merkt's was a bit too much for me.  There are better burgers nearby on Lincoln that I'd opt for over Brownstone's.   The best thing about the meal was the tots.  They were tot on!  I downed all of them and then stole a few from the cute little potato lover across the table.  I'll be ordering tots if I ever come back to Brownstone.  Book it.

I would like to give them more stars if they could find a way to reduce the volume when it is crowded.  Its not like I have ears that are extra sensitive to noise.  I have done more than my share of damage attending rock concerts, however I don't expect to have conversations at concerts.  When I am having a Guinness and some food at a local tavern, I also hope to enjoy some good company and conversation.

Confused? Let me take a step back.  Fresh out of college and not ready to enter the workforce, I applied for a job at a bar in my hometown. Much to my chagrin, they were only hiring for their soon-to-be city location. I took the job and quickly met a cute boy at work. When the new location was ready to open, I had a major crisis; you know, like the Iran-Contra Affair or bangs. It probably went like this: Like OMG, why do I have to be banished to some uncool part of the city; far, far away from my soulmate. I will die. DIE. I. TELL. YOU! Life is soooo unfair. ::sobs uncontrollably and stomps around::  I stayed with the boy and never transferred. However, neither the bar or the relationship lasted; today, the bar goes by the name of Brownstone and the boy....well, he's ancient history.  I ended up at Brownstone after a show at Martyr's sold out literally in front of our faces. My friend suggested Brownstone and I'm really glad she did, not just for the trip down memory lane. On a Tuesday the place was packed and loud, really loud. Per our server, trivia usually draws a crowd, but she thought a perfect storm of sporting events was a heavily influenced the uber crowd. Service was friendly, but a bit more inattentive than I would've liked, but I totally understood as our server was slammed and really busting her ass.  I ordered the smoked cheddar mac & cheese and finally had an opportunity to try Three Floyds Gumballhead. I attempted to try Gumballhead a few places recently, only to be shot down, which piqued my interest in the elusive local-ish brew. If you haven't tried it, you should. The mac and cheese was fantastic. The sauce was perfect; nice and creamy and they didn't oversell its smokiness. The shells were the perfect noodle choice, standing up well to the sauce. At $6, I found the dish quite the value; the rest of the menu, higher-end bar fare, looked quite delicious too and had a little something for everyone.  The menu isn't the only thing different about this self-described sports bar. The interior is dark, warm and cozy; I think I'd enjoy it as much (if not more) if the TV's were absent. It was a perfect place to escape on a cold, wintry Chicago evening for a while. The only aspect I found confusing was the bathroom. The sign for each bathroom is next to a door, naturally I assumed that door was the bathroom, but lo and behold - it was a storage closet.  Great food, great beer list, great atmosphere, fun memories; I can't wait to return.",0.9979,0.706,0.217,0.077,0.6487914862914863

We go in for the UFC fights, which makes it that much better of a place. The problem I have is that inbetween fights, this guy plays music and does not air the interviews and whatnot that Joe Rogan does live. While that may seem like pretty small potatoes, it's actually a fairly important part. We asked him to leave the audio on and he really gave us a hard time about it. Secondly, we usually get there about 5:30-6PM before the fight to have dinner and drinks. The bouncer still comes around and collects an entrance fee regardless of the fact that you have been spending money there.

I hesitate to even bring up this first part, because all was made good in the end.  But I went in for the late games, of which there are always very few.  The bar advertises that it shows all the games, yet only 3 of the 5 were on when I went inside.  Granted, the Bears were playing, and that occupied many of the screens.  At first I asked the guy in charge of the TV's if he could help me out and get my game on.  Initially, he wasn't very helpful and didn't seem very interested in helping out. So, I decided, in return I wouldn't spend any money there.  A bit later, I made another suggestion regarding the TV situation, and this time the guy went way out of his way to accommodate.  Not sure what happened, but he totally turned it around.  It won me over, and I decided to spend some money.   So in the end that part turned out ok, but you really shouldn't have to fight to get your game on at a bar that advertises having all of the games. Aside from that, they had a good beer list and the nachos we got were better than average. My only real gripe was the volume of the place.  Again, I was there during a bears game, AND we were sitting next to a speaker.  But the music they play after a touchdown and during commercials was absolutely ear drum damaging.  I had to pause the conversation for minutes at a time to wait for it to end.

I realize this is a sports bar and that is a great vibe, although we went to just hang with friends and have some food, the environment of this place really allowed both the sports nutz and the not-so-sport focused people, to be in the same place and have a great time.  Now, I am sure if there is a Bears, Hawks, or Longhorn game on, that me be a different story, but it IS a sports bar so we would go in expecting that.

Boyfriend perused the sandwiches and ordered a chicken gouda sandwich with tater tots.  My salad was quite tasty (although probably not all that healthy as it was covered in cheese, but whatever). I was silent for a while as I shoveled food in my face. Boyfriend offered me several tots and cheese sauce - what's not to like about tots and cheese sauce?!  Food was accompanied by a delightful selection of beers both on tap and in bottles. I can see myself spending an evening here drinking through the beer list.

The main thing I like about Brownstone is the miniwiches.  They're served on Hawaiian rolls, and you have your choice of three different meats to mix or match (you can order 3 or 6 at a time).  I always get the beef fillet which is served with horseradish (delish!).  They're served with chips, and while they're on the appetizer section, they're more of a meal. The place has ample seating, and a friendly waitstaff.  They also have a nice patio which I think includes heaters when the weather cools down which is nice for people who like to stretch out the summer far beyond its limits. The drink specials were interesting.  They had $5 margaritas.  The waitress asked if I wanted salt. I said yes.  When I got my drink, the salt wasn't on the rim but rather sprinkled on top of the drink. I had never seen this before (nor did any of my drinking companions), but it did solve the issue of getting to the salt when drinking out of a straw.  It was an interesting taste and wasn't that super sweet mix that makes you want to stop after one (this could be good or bad, depending on how much you want to drink). I will most likely be back, but if memory serves, it gets a little crazy during football games so I will avoid it on Saturdays and Sundays through January. There were several specials posted all over the place in addition to the normally advertised specials.  The one that really caught my eye was $5 all-you-can-eat-wings on Wednesdays.  I don't like that this isn't advertised with the regular specials, but I guess they like to reward patrons who pay attention.  Or those who stare at the walls while in the bathroom.",0.9888,0.777,0.162,0.061,0.5174286618731062

I have yet to read a review on this prior to scripting this, but I'm guessing it's Texas fans waxing poetic about how great this place is. Fair enough, I do the same thing with all the Michigan sports bars in Cook County!

Am I not aloud to root for the Cubs because I never played an inning in the Cubs farm system?  By Michigan State people, the answer to that is yes.  Silly. But as I was saying, this is also the place to be to watch your Butler University hoops games. Short of being in Hinkle Fieldhouse itself or the Bulldog in Indy (sorry, Moe & johnny's these days) , this is the place to be.

There's a lot of hoopla out there about which restaurant serves up the best tater tots in Chicago.  I'd like to throw Brownstone into the running.  Reasons why?  1. Crunchy as hell on the outside.  2. Silky smooth creaminess on the inside.  3. Just enough salt.  4. Served piping hot even though we obnoxiously put our food order in as the kitchen was closing.  I feel like the chefs could have easily given us old, lukewarm tots since they were probably less than thrilled about making our order so late in the game.  But they didn't.  Hence, forerunner for Best Tots in Chicago. The rest of the food ain't bad, either!  My Southwest wrap was chock-full of Chopped Romaine, Monterrey Jack, diced tomatoes, avocado, black beans and corn tossed in a zesty south of the border dressing.  Just what the doctor ordered after a show at the Aragon. Tots aside, I'm lovin' Brownstone.  The truth is I really always have loved Brownstone.  When I lived in the neighborhood, it was my secret weapon first date spot.  Close to home.  Enough people to have a lively atmosphere, but you can 99.9% of the time get a table right away.  Well above average pub grub (TOTS!) and a decent beer selection make it just the place to get to know someone.   Since Brownstone is owned by the same crowd that owns Schoolyard, Gaslight, Westend, Sidebar and Kirkwood it has a similar feel as its siblings: Lots of dark wood, lots of TVs, good beer selection, above average food menu and decent music.  It's very much the type of place that is frequented by the +30 crowd.  I'm down with that. The service is not bad, either.  Usually in a bar-type establishment the service is totally lacking, but the gals waiting tables at Brownstone did a bang-up job making sure our food was ordered before the kitchen closed (THANK GOD), our glasses were always full and the check was issued in a timely fashion.

I had the Old Town burger and it was excellent. My b/f had the chili-mac and it was surprisingly very good (given most times chili tastes like straight from a can). So our food was great and I can't wait to come back and try one of their new wraps. My old fav wrap was off the menu...but their new ones look like they can become my new fav wrap! Service was good. Usually we have to wait awhile for the check and for them to check on our drinks...but we had no problems. And it was a friday night around 7:00....still early...but still.  so why no 5 stars? I thought their wine list was way overpriced and it was very hot in there. So much so that I had to strip down to my tank. I could over-see the temp...but no excuse for over-priced wine.

I had to chuckle at a small group of Indiana fans that wandered in here on a recent college basketball game day and muttered ""Oh great, this is a f----ng Butler bar."" Of course everyone knows this is a Texas football bar (sorry Sooners), but come winter, Brownstone is the home of Butler basketball! They hook it up with banners, stadium cups, specials specific to either school, and of course, blasting the school song. They even open early for those noon-EST tipoffs. Any place that sponsors a college alumni club is bound to have good drink specials and the like. But of the many homogenous Lincoln Park/Lakeview spots with the typical ""fry everything"" approach, North Center's Brownstone outdoes them all with their menu.  Naturally there is a good selection of traditional bar food for the Coors-Light-and-a-deep-fryer crowd, but if you're like me and have a desire for some big boy food and drinks while still having the sports bar feel, nothing compares to Brownstone. The kitchen cranks out full salads (which can be turned into a wrap for free!), a thick selection of healthy or deliciously fried appetizers, sandwiches on a variety of breads and buns, plus tater tots and the skillet cookie, which get their own category. Sixteen taps and a stellar bottle selection that's heavy with American microbrews keep this beer nerd a happy guy.  Oh, and there's shotskis.

They have TOTS. They make amazing salads. There's this giant melty cookie in a skillet that is SO good my roommate and I gave ourselves stomachaches trying to eat it after gorging on wings and mini-sammiches. And while the wings could use a bit more sauce, they're very tasty...plus they're only 25c on Thursdays.  They have more than one kind of Irish whiskey behind the bar. I was pleasantly surprised to see a bottle of Powers next to the Jameson. That skillet cookie tastes amazing with beer. It's also a lot easier to eat if you haven't filled up on wings/mini-sammiches. If you HAVE been munching on Brownstone's other tasty treats, split the cookie with a friend. This place is right down the street from our house. It's probably going to be our regular hangout because it's just that awesome. Also...on some nights there's a door guy with a really hot accent. I'm willing to show up several nights a week just to hear it. *Sadly, they took the pulled pork items off the menu! It's still awesome, but I miss the pulled pork!",0.9592,0.872,0.119,0.009,0.6107687946973661
2007-07-05,5.0,"My roommate and I went here the other week because we saw a sign for $0.25 wings, and wild horses couldn't drag us away from cheap wings. So we went, were informed by the door guy and his adorable Australian accent that there was a bit of a wait for a table, so we put our name on the list and plopped our asses at the bar, where a Chris O'Donnell lookalike bartender served us our cheap bottles of Miller. Not more than  two seconds later, we were informed that our table was ready. Awesome. Service here is DAMN fast - especially from the kitchen. Try the little pulled pork sandwiches, they're heavenly. And the skillet cookie is worth every penny, but bring a friend to share it, because after a plate of wings and a whole lot of those little pork sandwiches, there is no way in hell that you'll finish the whole cookie-confection yourself. Awesome place, love the darker ambiance. Love the flowers on the tables - nice touch. We'll be back, and we'll tell all our friends. ALSO! Hottest bartenders/doorguy ever.

2007-06-11,3.0,"I miss Benedict's :(   That was my favorite bar in the city. Brownstone is no longer a great ""local, hang-out bar"" but now more of a college sports bar.   The bartenders are nice and good to look at.  One time I was sitting at a table for a bit and had not been served; once tended to, the staff was apologetic and accommodating. The food is DECENT at best.  I've had a few things that were all right and unoffensive (e.g. hummus, tator tots, miniwiches); nothing to write home about.  But the most recent time I went, my ""spinach artichoke dip"" was like cream cheese and chives with overly-fried mexican tortilla chips.  The only thing ""fresh"" about the chips was that they re-fried them to make them hot.  Maybe they'd run out and had to quickly concoct something similar.  Worst bar food I've ever had.  Very disappointing.  If I had been sober, it probably would have been worse! But the Brownstone is a average bar, just don't come hungry unless you're willing to gamble.  It's not always that bad, I'm sure (or at least hope).",0.8682,0.772,0.135,0.093,0.5809977324263038

I used to LOVE this place.  I remember jogging by in the afternoons before it opened and watching all the work being done: staining the wood, hauling in the tables.   At the time of the Brownstone's grand opening,  I was VERY single and in the midst of a  match.com  marathon.  The Brownstone was a favorite spot for a first-and-only date, as it's dark corners made it  easy to keep a low profile.   I became a regular to a server named Jen who would give me thumbs up or thumbs down votes on my various dates.  The food was good, (tater tots!) the beer was better and the flat screen TVs were a nice distraction if the conversation lagged. After more than a year, I have found myself in a relationship with a wonderful man.  We both live in the neighborhood and have frequented the Brownstone many times throughout our relationship.   And yet, somehow it all went wrong.  Where did all of these people come from?  And who knew there was such a heavy Texas A&M contingency in Chicago? This place has lost it's charm, it's 'neighborhood bar' feel and instead feels more like a sports bar in the middle of a college town.  Loud and annoying.  There is nearly always a wait for a table (40 minutes at 8pm on a Tuesday night!) and a seemingly omnipresent pack of beer swilling dudes standing in the middle of the room checking out whatever walks in the door.   Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for them that their business is doing so well, but I'm sad, bitter and angry that a place that was once my 'love' has now become something that I don't even recognize.",0.4274,0.826,0.097,0.077,0.5865599115599115

2006-11-21,4.0,"Part of the Four Corners group of bars/restaurants (Gaslight, Schoolyard, etc.), the bf & I patronized Brownstone last week. We are pathetic restaurant regulars at Gaslight, so when we saw on their online menu that they carried the same dishes that we normally order on Racine, we thought we'd pretend we weren't as predictable by going to another location & ordering the same damn food. Well, that would be all nice & good if the menu items were really the same.  His Hickory burger was the same, our three kinds of soft pretzels were the same, but my Cortland Salad (at Gaslight it's the Carriage Salad) was slightly different. Instead of zesty diced portabello mushrooms, Brownstone's version has long, spicy portabello mushrooms.  I know, I know, what's the diff, right?  Here's the diff ... having to cut up the mushroom instead of just scooping large forkfuls into my watering mouth.  & the slight spiciness (spiciness?  is that even a word?) was surprising, but not as enjoyable. Had I not been completely head over heels in love with the Carriage Salad, I may like the Cortland Salad a little more.  In fact, I'd probably like it a lot, but I was expecting one thing & got another. Our waitress was great, we were never for want of refills, there are plenty of televisions for your sports viewing pleasure (which is great if you're my bf, but horrible if you're me & trying to hold an, oh, I dunno, actual conversation), & the dark wood motif is cozy.
