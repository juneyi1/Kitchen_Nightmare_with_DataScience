2017-09-02,5.0,BY FAR MY FAVE BREAKFAST IN ALL OF CHI TOWN.  The farmers omelet is stellar. The coconut oatmeal is awesome. They have mini scones to go if you want. The mimosa specials on weekend are great. I just can't say enough good things about this place. I have been here totally sober and sweaty from a workout and I have also been here after marathon St. Pat's drinking at 10pm at night still drunk. I just absolutely love the consistency of this place and I'm so sad I no longer live around the block.  The hashbrowns are perfect please NEVER change them!,0.8943,0.688,0.196,0.116,0.6999999999999998
2017-08-31,5.0,"We were looking for a casual brunch spot on our trip to Chicago when we saw that this place was just down the street from our hotel. We were immediately greeted when we entered the restaurant and found a spot by the window. The atmosphere felt very down to earth, cozy feeling -- there were many single diners reading the newspaper or a novel while dining.  I ordered an omelette and the waitress asked if I would like my hash browns extra crispy. I didn't think that was an option but I said sure! When the food came, and I tasted the perfect crunch in my mouth, I knew that extra crispy was the best decision I've made that morning. My omelette was delicious and so filling - the portions tend to be on the bigger side, and it's the best bang for your buck.  I left so satisfied and full and would happily return here next time i find myself in the Windy City!",0.9921,0.768,0.232,0.0,0.5123308270676692

We were fortunate to be able to snag a table for two on a busy Saturday morning with no wait! Take a moment to look around as well as local artists have their art on display and for sale.  I had the Greek Omelet (baby spinach, tomato, and feta cheese) with egg whites. ($1.50 extra). I substituted the hash browns for fruit and chose marble rye for my toast. The portion was HUGE and delicious. I only wish that you did not have to specifically request olives. I forgot and I was bummed out when my omelet arrived sans olives. Most Greek omelets come with olives unless you request to NOT have them, not the other way around. Weird.  He had the Pulled Pork Hash which, again, was a huge portion. He said it was very good, albeit very spicy! Keep that in mind if you order it! It came with two eggs and toast.  We split a Mimosa and that was delicious.

The hash browns were cooked perfectly, the steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. The cheese was nice and melty and the tortillas were warm.

I forgot to ask for it on this occasion, and they came out that way anyway. Perfect! My wife had the Pulled Pork Hash, and while it was alright, it was not as good as my meal. The pork is described as having ""dry rub seasonings"", which is not really the case. I'll tell you exactly what it has: Lawry's Seasoned Salt, and lots of it. That flavor isn't necessarily bad, but it really is all the flavor the pork had. The eggs and potatoes and the rest of the dish were pretty good, she finished it all except the pork, but she did still eat some of the pork.

About food: the house omelet with hash browns were average. But the quinoa in the kale & quinoa salad were not fully cooked because I can see the white point in the middle of the quinoa & they were hard to chew. I didn't find anyone else has the problem so I guess it's just me. And I went through all the pictures on Yelp and didn't notice this problem occurred in others' pics. So yeah, I guess I'm the 'lucky one'. We didn't say anything at the restaurant because: 1. Our sever wasn't being so nice. 2. We were in a bit hurry and we already waited 20mins to place our order even though they were not that busy. Overall a very disappointed experience.",-0.4346,0.844,0.072,0.084,0.46764705882352947

2015-09-02,3.0,"For those of you who are not familiar with the Great Lakes, the 3rd coast refers to them.  You got your East Coast on the Atlantic, your West Coast on the Pacific, and the 3rd coast along the Great Lakes.  Some claim that the 3rd coast refers to the Gulf Coast.  Sorry y'all, but the earliest reference was a Milwaukee Mayor using it to attract business.  He preferred it to the region being referred to as the Rust Belt. Anyway, now that the history lesson.  Let's head to the other 3rd Coast; the one on Dearborn Street in Chicago. Every neighborhood has a ""go to"" spot.  When I lived on the Gold Coast many years ago, it was Monday's on State or Mitchell's at North and Clark.  They are gone and 3rd Coast has come along to take the honors. It's located on the corner of Goethe (""ger-tah"" if you speak Chicago - or German, I assume) and Dearborn.  It is just off of the lobby of an apartment building.  When you enter, the first thing you may notice is the sizable adult beverage area with 2 dining rooms on either side of the bar/cashier; one up and one down. The décor is fairly non-descript, but not in an unattractive way.  The walls are festooned with several dozen pieces of for sale artwork.  Many are Chicago-centric, but I've yet to find one that would seem to go with the ""3rd Coast"" moniker (read: nautical themed). The menu is what I would describe as ""current diner"".  Breakfast is served all day with nice spins on the classics.  I really like the Chicago-style smoked polish sausage with eggs.  While I'm not sure it meets my definition of ""Chicago-style"" it is very good.  The split Smokey goodness plays wonderfully with an over-medium egg.  Actually, I like the combo much more than bacon and eggs. The salads are generous.  The Waldorf is one of my favorites; greens, apples, goat cheese and walnuts all work together to deliver a surprisingly satisfying lunch or lighter dinner.  I've heard great things about the Kale/Quinoa and the Cobb salads as well.  Although, I will admit, I've never had them because I am always distracted by... ...the Diablo tacos!  Man, are they good.  You get a full plate with soft corn tortillas each carefully loaded with ground beef, onions, cilantro, cabbage, and avocado.  It also comes with this wonderful ""medium"" hot sauce.  It's got to be house made because the color is not one that would be favored by commercial food marketers.  The cabbage offers a nice crisp bite as the seasoned ground beef and onions bring a savory note and a bit of spice for the avocado to smooth over.  I'm not an expert on Mexican street food, but this is actually fairly close to what I remember, right down to the squeeze of lime and NO CHEESE.  I know, right?  Sounds crazy, but my Mexican friends tell me the cheese on tacos is not as universal as Taco Bell would have us believe. The other really bright spots for this neo-diner are the burgers.  In my experience, it really doesn't matter; the Baja, Malibu, Niece, Cajun, or 3rd Coast burgers are all worthy of a try.  Fresh ground beef with just the right amount of fat is what makes these juicy-run-down-your-hand-but-not-your-arm yummy bombs.  Hey!  I eat here during the work day and my dress shirts have to remain presentable.  So, I'm OK with a 3 on the messy-meter. Now, I will also tell you that I hear the scones are terrific.  I've never had one, but several of my fellow Yelpers swear by them.  So, there you go.  I've also not experienced the place in the evening when it supposedly is more of a hip wine bar type of place.  Not exactly my crowd, but I'm sure the dinner offerings are just as solid.

My friend had looked the place up via yelp and said ""whatever I get, I'm also getting a scone on the side, so don't judge!"". I would NEVER judge a person for wanting a delicious breakfast food, and as soon as I passed the pastry case with them inside, saw they had raspberry, and that it was served with whipped cream, I had need for one as well! Their menu and pics posted by fellow yelpers made my decision all too difficult. Everything sounded great! I kept flipping the menu back and forth before I decided on a burger. I was pleasantly surprised to see that soup was a side option, as well as hash browns or a salad. There was the slightest inkling of a chill in the air so I went with a cup of their spicy garbanzo barley soup, the Baja Burger and the raspberry scone.  The waiter working seemed to be the only one managing the register and all the tables. It wasn't super busy, but for one person, I guess it was kind of a lot. He dropped menus on the table that he'd just taken from another table, and by the first time he came around to greet us, it was already decision time for all the food. He came off as a little rushed and abrupt. We ordered food, and diet cokes and began our tortuous wait.  I was a little disappointed to see that the pops were served in cans. AKA- no free refills. Bummer, could've used a little more of that caffiene! Food came out relatively shortly after, and everything was delicious. I LOVED the soup- mild spice, loaded with beans and barley... I'm definitely going to hunt out a recipe for it! The burger was juicy, a little greasy, had a decent amount of avocado on it and TONS of pepperjack cheese- Just what the doctor ordered! The scone was quite large, had a fair amount of raspberries on it, and was also pretty good. It wasn't a life changing experience, I'd say the soup was the closest food item for that.  My friend ordered similar with an omelet meal, scone and coke. We left with leftovers and our total was like $42. I thought it was reasonable for what we got.

When we walked in the restaurant was noticeably slow.  We asked a a larger table, but were quickly informed those are reserved for groups of 4. While I generally understand this policy, I can't help but think they could've accommodated our request. After all, the restaurant was not busy at all. They sat us in a very tight corner table. So close, in fact, it was difficult to have a private conversation. My wife asked what kind of muffins are available. Seemingly, a very simple question; however, the waitress quickly snapped, ""we don't have muffins, we only have scones.""  From the looks of the display case, the pastries could easily be mistaken for muffins. Our apologies for asking such a silly question!  We ended up leaving before we finished our food as we found it very annoying to share our conversation with total strangers at the adjacent table. When we left, the restaurant was less crowded than when we walked in. I find this level of service unacceptable. Despite the good food, we will not be coming back.

It's still charming and, at 9am, was fairly quiet. Just five other people were dining. (That changed quickly and, by the time we left, the place was crowded. So go early if you don't want to wait for a seat. ) Three sleepy-eyed, yawning girls stood behind the counter when we entered. No one greeted us. We asked if we could take any table and were told yes. The friendliest and hardest worker in the restaurant was the busboy. When no one came to take our order, he went and got us coffee and summoned a waitress, who'd been ""busy"" talking to the other servers at the counter. I'm guessing that no manager or owner was around because the service remained ridiculously slow and the servers showed little interest in working.  Our breakfast fare (omelettes) was fine.

We are all adults and need to eat) I'm NOT a breakfast fan, so I can't comment on that, but their Asian noodle soup is amazing. I could eat soup everyday, and am picky about it, and this is great.

I ordered the chicken greek salad and she ordered the BLT.  5 stars for service-- you can set up an order for pick up or delivery (they do deliver!!!) but we ordered pick up and it was ready in 15 minutes...awesome!! 2 stars for food -- This is based solely on my salad, I will update this if I try other things. However, I was not impressed with the salad. It was $14 and tasted like a $5 salad. First of all, the chicken added to the salad is cold (I prefer warm chicken) and tasted okay. It was a bit dry and had to warm it up. They did give the right amount. The salad itself was very bland and not dressed up at all. I ordered the dressing on the side, Greek dressing very good! The BLT was on Texas toast, large and average.  I will try this place once more but for now, I was not wowed (and I have been eating A LOT OF SALADS for the upcoming wedding :) ).  This salad is one of my least favorites that I have tried in the past two months.

Janet and her team provide all the ingredients of a desirable hang-out -- only lacking a sunny terrace on which to nurse the morning's second or third expresso. I'm there mainly for breakfasts -- all varieties of coffees and egg dishes, and hearty scones that make a meal by themselves -- and lunches -- with focus on choices of soup, sandwiches and salads.

Perhaps one of the few locations to resist a row of sports-heavy televisions, the Third Coast instead features good sunshine from a row of large east-facing windows, and paintings and photography sourced from artists deserving the exposure.

(Not that any of them gave good enough advice to truly be psychic mediums, but it was helpful nonetheless.) The room is relatively quiet, with most people respecting that ambiance.  The food is good and simple. I often get something light--the grilled cheese sandwich is excellent; tonight I just had eggs with hash browns and sourdough toast, along with their very quaffable house red wine. Hash browns are one of those things where, if they're done perfectly, they are very crispy on the surface and very soft & chewy on the inside. In that case, if they are truly unhealthy for you, it is worth losing a few days off the end of my life for them. Tonight they were and, consequently, it was. Lately I go here many a Tuesday night, because there is a group that meets to practice speaking Spanish. The waiters at 3rd Coast are wonderfully accommodating (let me give a special shout-out to Sado, who always projects a good, mellow mood and is always helpful), They even give each of us separate checks, which is made easier by us wearing name tags for the event and leaving at different times, so everyone doesn't pile up at the register at once.",0.995,0.807,0.169,0.024,0.4639128829826506

Sometimes more if I am feeling lazy.  The food is nothing short of delicious!  The prices offered for the entrees and appetizers are great. The staff here is wonderful and attentive. The diablo tacos are my weekly ""go to"", but the baked chevre is delish! Also, the chicken quesadillas, the tomato rosemary soup (when served), the malibu burger (MMmmm), and the Mexican steak & eggs.  Look, if it wasn't good, I would gladly walk somewhere else, as there are plenty of places close by.

Personally, I prefer the faster service and more varied menu of the Original Pancake House on Bellevue and Rush.  But 3rd Coast is a solid choice.

I ordered the full stack of the blueberry pancakes.  They were good, but, you know, they were also pancakes.  I'm not going to wax poetic about batter and blueberries.

I came here three times  to make sure that I wasn't missing something since this place got pretty good reviews on yelp, but on all occasions I found my brunch experience terribly disappointing. My most recent visit was just flat-out horrible in all aspects, except for the coffee. I ordered the eggs benedict (what can go wrong with a classic benny, right?) with hash browns. The yolks were somewhat overcooked, but I can forgive this since the bearnaise sauce compensated for the lack of yummy, runny yolk. My hash browns, however, were just too overcooked and oily. It seemed like it was left on a deep fryer for too long of a time and turned into pomme frittes. I'll upload a pic shortly showing the napkin, which soaked all the oil, and remnants  of the pomme-frittes-like hash browns. I told the waitress about this, and she responded by schooling me on how has browns are supposed to be crispy. The great service doesn't stop here. They'll reward your patronage by teaching you in the art of patience since you'll be waiting ages for coffee refills. At the end of the meal, your server will most likely ask you if you'd like a refill on a cup that has been left empty since the beginning of your meal. Classic!

I went for the farmer's omelet instead, but two friends got the veggie hash and started raving about how yummy it is after their first bite, so I'll have to try that next time. The omelet was delicious too, with a bit of caramelization on the outside and lots of filling. I was stuffed!  Added bonus: no wait on early Saturday morning.

2012-06-02,4.0,"In short: great food, even better atmosphere, and reasonable prices. I've been here a few times, for both brunch and dinner. I honestly didn't feel like there was anything that special about the brunch. It was good food, nothing wrong with it, but I don't live in the neighborhood, so I'm unlikely to trek down unless I'm meeting my buddies that live next door.  Dinner is really good, though. They have a menu that ""changes,"" but I came two times, about a month apart, and the menu was the same, so I'm not really sure if it actually changes. They have sandwiches and appetizers that they have every day, and then they also have a ""specials"" menu.  The first time, I had the Jamaican Chicken Curry. It was really filling, and the flavor was a little weird- not the typical Jerk flavor I expect; it wasn't bad, just different, so if you're looking for actual Jamaican chicken, this probably isn't it. The second time, I got the mediterranean salad and vegetable soup and my friend got the grilled cheese. Everything was really really good. I know it's hard to mess up a salad, but it gets done way too often, and this salad was huge, perfectly proportioned, not drenched in dressing, and really tasty and filling. The vegetable soup was chock full of vegetables. The chicken peanut soup is also really good if you like peanut sauce- it basically tastes like a liquidier peanut sauce.  Overall, I'd give the food a 3.5 stars overall, because the menu is a little hit or miss (I guess you just need to figure out which items you like), but I definitely round up for the atmosphere and service. This is such a cute little wine bar, no tourists, and the servers are so friendly. There are also always people studying in the upstairs area, which seems more suited for hanging out than meeting people, so if you're looking for a place to study and drink wine, this might be it.",0.9907,0.793,0.153,0.054,0.5093802769334683

2012-04-02,2.0,"There are so many new and fabulous brunch places opening every weekend, that I'm concerned for the Gold Coast's oldest cafe. In fact, I'm pretty sure a handful opened in the 45 minutes it took between ordering our eggs and them actually arriving. I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a wait for a table for two at 11AM on a Sunday. My out-of-towner friend and I came looking for eggs and bottomless coffee and weren't disappointed. However, we weren't wowed. I'm a fan of the innovative ""classic"" brunch--that means fruity pancake flights,  potato ""hashes,"" modern European pastries I've never heard of, etc. The sweet options on the menu seemed pretty classic and safe, although I was intrigued by the brie and banana liquor stuffed french toast. The savory options seemed more adventurous, although there were a variety of pretty standard omelet options. I chose the Lox Eggs Benedict which replaces hollandaise sauce with Salsa verde. I enjoyed the dish, but the salsa verde pretty much over-powered the lox. My friend ordered the veggie hash and was pleased with the variety and quantity of the vegetables. I love bragging about Chicago brunches to visitors and promising an unforgettable dining experience. At the end of the meal, my out-of-towner mentioned the fabulous bruch she had LAST TIME she visited. Taking her to a Chicago relic seemed like a good angle for a visitor, but history doesn't excuse a ridiculously long wait for the food, lackluster dishes, and a rather musty decor.

Their menu rotates but some of my favorite things are the Cajun Chicken Penne, the cheese plate, their soups, and many times their seafood specials.

Of the 5 white wines on the menu by the glass, they didn't have one and couldn't suggest a replacement. Because there are wines on a menu does not make it wine bar. The decor is as sloppy as the food and hints at the detail they put into the whole operation.  I went there for a Restaurant Week 3-course meal. The waitress didn't know or understand the menu. The artichoke bruschetta topping came from a can and the halved baguette it was on wasn't even toasted. And it was on a baguette. And it was bland and awful. But before we could have the second bite, the salad came out. And then we waited 40 mins for the entrees, which we didn't bother finishing.

Is the service ok? Strangely, this was one place that none of my friends heard about. Therefore I did not know what to expect going in.  After having dinner here last night, I did not leave disappointed. I went with six others for a ""Grub With Us"" dinner club meal, and they served us a very nice tasting menu. For appetizers, we ate mini italian meatballs, a mini hummus plate with pita bread, and a plate of chicken quesadillas with spinach and cheddar. I did like the quesadillas and meatballs, but I could not stop tasting the hummus. It was quite yummy. For main courses we were served curry chicken, beef tacos, artichoke ravioli and slices of vegetable and sausage pizza. The one dish that stood out for me was the tacos. If you ate them normally, they would have just tasted ok...however what put it over the top for me was the spicy sauce that they gave you on the side. Wow, never had tacos that tasted like that before. The artichoke ravioli was also a different plate to try; and that turned out ok as well. Sadly, and I hesitate to say this, the only dish that I wasn't too crazy about was the curry chicken. It wasn't terrible, it just didn't stand out for me. For dessert, I liked the key lime pie carrot cake they served. I initially thought that they were going to serve is key lime pie AND carrot cake...however putting them both together turned out well for me.  The settings look to be pretty old-fashioned; it looked like this could be a restaurant that would be attached to an old-fashioned hotel. I also noticed all the art pieces that hung around the restaurant; it gave us nice things to look at. Two words come to mind when describing service here: top notch. The owner (I think her name was Janet; I could be totally off since I'm not good with names) greeted us when we were initally seated at our table; and also checked in with us as we were in mid-meal. The waitress that served us (again, not good with names so let's call her Jill) was great as well. She mistakenly served me an extra glass of wine...so I ended up with two glasses next to my dinner plate. Jokingly she offered me a wine bong that she had handy to down the wine faster..sadly I didn't take her up on that offer.  Nestled away in the middle of the Gold Coast/Old Town area, 3rd Coast is is a delight, plain and simple. The only thing that is keeping me from giving this place five stars is the food.

My friend and I are bacon aficionados, connoisseurs of nature's most delicious treat. We both agree that they have the best bacon, surpassing the longtime champion Walker Bros. It has the perfect texture and thickness with just a touch of sweetness; simply exquisite.

I had the Italian Omelet. It sounds interesting and tastes like nothing at all. The other dishes at the table were Eggs Benny and Huevos Rancheros. ""Gross"" was actually thrown around when describing some of the food. It's a very rare day when I eat somewhere and know that I can make better food...but that's what happened on Sunday. It was pretty unfortunate considering how welcoming the place seemed when we got there. Ah well. As a famous poet once said...On to the next one!",0.9884,0.781,0.176,0.043,0.5126847290640394

Got there at 11 am on a Sunday and there was only a 10 minute wait for 3 people, so far, AMAZING! Sat down, it was about 5 minutes before we were given our menus and another 5 for water and to take our drink order. 15 minutes after that we got our drinks and ordered (iced coffee and iced tea). 30 minutes later and our starving bellies were served.  The waitress mentioned that the BEST thing on the menu were the benedicts, hello! Being my favorite brunch item I of course ordered it. The BF got the italian omelette (my second choice, score!) and our friend ordered the huevos rancheros. This was one of the most sub-par, bleh benny's i've ever had. The english muffin, ham, and egg were fine but that was one of the worst hollandaise sauces I've ever tasted. I'm not sure what they did to it but it was gloppy and stale. There was no hit of buttery rich eggy goodness. The hashbrowns were good but couldn't make up for the benny. The italian omelette was ok but I could make better at home.  Overall the combination of SLOW service + mediocre food = Meh. I've experienced better. I will not be going back for brunch.",0.9821,0.769,0.176,0.055,0.5437710437710437

While moving out of Chicago I stayed at the hotel next door and finally had an excuse to try the dinner menu here.  Once again, despite being a wine bar/coffee shop, I had another excellent Tex-Mex meal and tried the steak fajitas, with a bottle of Pacifico on the side.  (Good stuff.)  I was pretty impressed with their selections of beer, and the drinks list does a great job describing each one, so it's hard to make an uninformed choice. There's no air conditioning, at least on the summer evening I went there, so if you are a bit delicate you might want to sit by the windows.  The waitstaff has always been friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is definitely cozy, but in a good way - not a lot of noise, great for having conversations.  If you're looking for a place to have an intimate breakfast with one friend, or five, this is a good spot.",0.9878,0.803,0.177,0.019,0.631388888888889

I also  love their sweet vidalia onion dressing.  I ask them to put it on the side of my salad so i can use the extra on my sandwich.  If you are not that hungry, try the cheese plate to share.  They put apples, crackers and either a marmalade or jam alongside different types of cheeses.  With a glass of reisling, it's a really good late night snack. We love the old style decor with it's dark wood details.  We also love the fact that they put up art work from a different artist every few weeks on their walls.  If you happen to see something you really like, these art works are for sale.  We also love that they are open late.  The staff is always friendly no matter how late or how close to closing time it is.  (We went one time and it was about 15 minutes to closing yet they still served us!).  Overall, it's a great neighborhood place to go to if you are not feeling like cooking or just want a quiet drink with a snack. p.s. You should try at least one of the soups of the day.  It's always good.",0.9971,0.789,0.199,0.012,0.4273391812865497
2010-09-13,5.0,"I really like this place. My only complaint is that the ambiance is off...it seems outdated with the dark wood table and chairs, candlelight. So the vibe is a little cheesy, like it's trying too hard to be romantic. Also, the sign in the women's bathroom was really entertaining...it's an historic 1920's building with the same old ass plumbing system so they ask that when you flush, you hold down the lever and count to five. Haha. The detailed instructions were very helpful though!  BUT, everything else about this place is awesome and it totally deserves 5 stars. The paintings that hang on the walls contrast the decor, as they are more modern in style and are in good taste. The service was fantastic! Stephanie was so sweet and genuinely personable. The food was excellent, even down to the balsamic dressing on the house salad. I had the butternut squash ravioli, which had the perfect amount of sweetness for me. I had the Rocky's Revenge ale to complement the dish! Yum! I also love that they serve breakfast all day and are open early.

Apparently, at least 4 other parties were already well into their breakfasts. Though quite ample in portion, the toast was just chewy and 'limp'... don't know how else to describe it (I have had stellar french toast in my time....read Tower cafe or Bella Bru, Sacramento). Though dipped in egg and then pan-fried, the toast did not possess that great play in crisp and then soft on the inside...instead it was all completely soft somewhat tasteless. Would have been a nice touch had they just added a splash of nutmeg and/or cinnamon to the egg batter. Syrup is the other half that comprises a killer french toast experience: it was... meh. From the perusal of breakfast reviews, it's sort of hit/miss with this well-established place that is connected to the south of a condo building.

We walked in and while there were wine bottles displayed around the place and a list that had wines on it (thus a wine list) . . .the 3rd Coast is by no means a wine bar. There were not even any ""nibbles"" on the menu that would lead me to believe that they could be snacked on while enjoying a glass of wine. And the ambiance is more coffee shop esque than wine bar.  Now what it is, is a neighborhood restaurant that serves breakfast all day and has a variety of sandwiches on the menu to eat in their comfy, if a bit dated dining room. The burger and the turkey/brie sandwich ended up being our choices, but we had a beer along side them, not our much craved wine and cheese. But the food was good, at least.  The staff was certainly pleasant. In fact, I think they even felt bad that they could not deliver on the wine bar part of their name.  Parking in this neighborhood is a hassle. My suggestion? Bite the bullet and park in the very expensive parking garage located just south of the restaurant. They will validate your ticket at the restaurant so you only pay $10 instead of the $18.50 they take for the first 30 minutes.  All in all- I think this was an expectation problem.

2009-09-22,5.0,"I brunch a lot. I try to eat at a new brunch place every month and every time I do, I always buy a scone. The scone is my yardstick, my Big Mac index if you will on how brunch places compare to one another. To me, omelettes taste the same across different restaurants, but scones can have so many interpretations and ingredients--it's exciting every time I try one! I've been a fan of scones ever since my mom bought me those triangular-shaped blueberry scones from Safeway when I was a little girl. I think it's safe to say that I've eaten a lot of scones in my lifetime, but never in my life have I come across scones such as the ones from 3rd Coast. For one thing, these scones are shaped like a dome and are bigger than my fist so they are heartier than most scones out there. The scones come out warm and toasty as if they're arriving straight from the oven. The outside of the scone is hard and dry, which makes you think the scone will be like that on the inside. But, once you break off a piece of the scone, you can see that the inside is soft with huge chunks of fruit and the scone just melts in your mouth. This is exactly how I envisioned the perfect scone to be! Tough as a rock on the outside, but cozy and fluffy on the inside. I think 3rd Coast has only three varieties: raspberry, chocolate chip and blueberry. The chocolate chip scone tastes like a giant butter chocolate chip cookie, which is fine with me. The raspberry scone is a little too tart for my taste, but the blueberry scone is just divine. I visited Chicago recently and I bought 6 scones to bring back to California. Each scone is $2.50 each, which I think is a bargain when you're paying for a scone the size of a softball. The scones weren't as fresh as they would be if you dined in, but the crumbly, buttery taste was still there.

The atmosphere, not to mention location at the swank intersection of Dearborn and Goethe, are certainly enough to suggest a decidedly high-end experience. But while 3CC may attract an upper-class clientele, it also provides a surprisingly relaxed, casual atmosphere -- one that may not become apparent until seated. The menu varies, covering a wide range of entries and appetizers. For those looking for a light meal, the grilled cheese is bar-none the best in Chicago; you'd swear it was grilled in sunshine, not better. Those arriving with a more serious hunger will obviously be looking for something more substantial, which is where the spicy penne pasta with chicken comes in. Add bacon bits for over the top flavor -- provided you don't have a heart condition. And top the whole thing off with a massive, multi-scoop brownie sundae, with non-traditional sundae scoops of mint and coffee ice cream.

2009-02-02,5.0,"I can't remember the first time I went to 3rd Coast cafe. Certainly, it was much different than it is now. I have very vivid memories of the upstairs section: the oscillator in the center of the ceiling trying to keep pace with the locals' cigarette smoke, interchanging it with oxygen which was used to fuel the varied discussions ranging from Hegel's  philosophy to ""Billy Joel: the man, or not the man?"". I didn't smoke in high school, but many of my classmates did, and often snuck over to the Coast after school to hide away from anyone who might catch them. There are several people  that borderline-lived there, playing chess, reading, debating. There still are. This is for a reason. There was a distinguishable identity back then. 3rd Coast was the place you would go when you got in a fight with your girl friend or your parents, where you would go when you were so stressed out about the 8 hours of homework  you had that you knew the only way you could get through it was with bottomless coffees, 4am close times, and unbelievably good music selected by a staff who deserves their own hall of fame. 3rd Coast was just where you would go. Because it was a constant. You could rely on the good music, the kind-but-not-intrusive wait staff who were eager to be on a first-name basis with you, and of course the lovely owner: Janet. Most importantly I could rely on the Turkey & Brie: a sandwich that is such a staple to the restaurant that vicious debates have ensued over its merit and taste. I have probably had the Turkey & Brie more than my own mother's cooking. And yet, I never seem to tire of it. It is always there. When the baker of the bread used for the sandwich went out of business near-riots erupted. Ingredients are vital. After all, there isn't even lettuce on the damned thing. Just Turkey,  and Brie. So if the bread changes, it is seismic. Some other things changed along with the bread. Someone commented on the Coast's convoluted identity. At one point I knew it as a sit-for-hours cafe. I remember when the threat of the smoking ban first reared it's head. I was smoking a lot of pot at the time, and would often venture to my nostalgic spot, back faced to the mirrors, munchie's drawn and ready to order a brownie fudge sundae with ice cream you'd have to drive out to the suburbs to eat if you weren't going to get it here. Lately I've been more inclined to get apple pie, slices of which are cut so big they rival the gusto of a slice of Gibson's pie. A slice so large that when ordered a la mode can only be difgnified with two scoops of ice cream, which it is. Perhaps now it is not so much of a sit-down-for-hours cafe. What I'm trying to say is, don't expect free wifi because it ain't that kind of place. The smokers are no longer there, the closing time is now 12 instead of 4, and Sunday brunch has become an event worthy of the gold coast's finest, so long as they check their prententiousness at the door. But I'm still welcomed in with a smile and can still expect the same conversation, the same good music, and of course the Turkey & Brie. And by the way, the bread they use for it now is the best they've ever had.  I think the identity of the Coast is more poignant and articluated now than it was when it was more obvious. Perhaps it is more subtle, and maybe combined from its past lives and future ambitions, but it is certainly not confused, or facing some kind of identity crisis. To me it is loud and clear. You may not get it the first time. After this essay of a review you may even be disappointed with it. But I won't accept your opinion of the place until you've been there at least 20 times.  Because to me this establishment means so much more than a place for a quick meal. Even if things are different now, I still see the 3rd Coast Cafe as the only place that will always make sense, where the only thing that changes is the art hanging on the walls, and the soup.

I used to work in the area and afterwards would head on over for some delicious grub and its inviting, homey, almost hypnotic atmosphere.  Being at the garden level really helps transport your body and mind to an otherworldly state.  You just seem to forget time is passing outside without having to stare at all the hustlers and bustlers on the sidewalk.  There are windows that you can see out from, don't get me wrong--it's not a dungeon--but you just don't seem to notice the outside world. The food is excellent greasy spoon fare.  What it is not is gourmet, exotic, organic, fusion, or some other type of haute-cuisine nomiker that is good for visiting friends from ""Bon Appetit"" or ""Food and Wine.""  This is much more of a Rachel Ray joint where you could bring that chronic eater and hear 1000 ""yum-os"" before the meal were through.  The breakfasts come in overwhelming proportions, the sandwiches are always humongous and come with a large salad or a cup of their delicious soup, or some other choices (I can't remember).  If you order the salad, ask for light on the dressing or they'll smother it, which isn't always so bad except when you're on a diet.  Then there's some decent entrees and classic desserts. Of course there are drinks and coffee to add to the fun, and I must say their coffee is very good, bespeaking it as a truly classy joint.  I am not sure but I would imagine they buy whole bean and grind it on site. The prices are middle of the road.  I would not call this expensive for the area at all, and I don't even know if I would call it expensive at all.  Considering the portions are so huge, you definitely get your money's worth. A few recommendations: the Mexican steak and eggs breakfast; the breakfast sandwiches (plain old egg and cheese, or with bacon or with ham); the Dutch club; the applewood smoked bacon BLT; and for the chicken salad lover, the Coronation chicken salad sandwich (not for you if you don't like curry).  Also, for a quick snack, the quesadilla is a good choice. I can't stress enough that this place is more importantly about its ambiance.  The staff is friendly and patient, if not a little slow but they're always busy.  The place is so warm and inviting that it is perfect for a cold winter's night.  Go with a book in hand, your journal, or just a friend for a deep conversation.  You won't be dissapointed.",0.9968,0.819,0.16,0.02,0.5639246809835045
2007-03-06,4.0,"A weekday morning here usually sees lots of single diners eating very far apart...but it works here. With long hours, casual service, and a wide range of fare (breakfast always, cocktails, nice wine selection, great sandwiches), 3rd Coast is perfect for those times when you want to eat alone (or with others - it's ok!) and hide out at a nicely incognito location. Have visiting relatives staying in the Gold Coast? Take them to breakfast here. Shopping up Oak and Rush to State and want to sit and have a cappucino? 3rd Coast has a variety of coffee drinks and signature scones.  However, I have to recommend getting fruit instead of potatoes with breakfast because otherwise it gets to be way too filling. AndI only wish they had a greater variety of omelets.",0.9664,0.79,0.184,0.026,0.5920634920634921
2007-01-07,3.0,"I'd say that this is an average place to go for brunch sometime - traditional greasy-spoon food just with slighly higher quality. Its a bit too expensive for its own good too - you can get a meal at Earwax or Bite  (around the wicker park/ukranian village area) for less money and it'll be more tasty in my opinion. The atmosphere is nice, but its not worth the extra $2-3 for an average meal. For the money I'd go some place a little nicer, or a little cheaper and enjoy it more.",0.8468,0.86,0.119,0.021,0.5072916666666667

2006-11-20,5.0,"Something in Chicago that hasn't changed in the last 15 years!!! When I was underage, I'd come to Third coast to feel like an adult- great cafe food, coffee drinks, etc.  I remember somehow being impressed that I could sit in a cafe that served alcohol- wine, beer, etc, and play chess!  This was the first place I ever ate a craison. For whatever reason, I hadn't been to Third Coast in easily over 10 YEARS, so Saturday when I found myself in the area, I had a dilemma- avoid it and continue to imagine it exactly as I remembered, or go and risk being let down by another place corrupted with city growth and ""progress.""  Was it even still around? IT WAS!  And it hasn't changed one bit!  I ordered a glass of champagne to celebrate!  The food is still great, the atmosphere is still the same, everything is just right!  I realize now that it's a pretty European feeling cafe, with drinks and simple food/salads to enjoy in addition to coffee and the normal cafe fare.  The place isn't super fancy or new inside, but it's comfortable, and kind of hidden, and just the greatest.  Not perfect- but perfect even in its imperfection, you know?",0.9897,0.768,0.203,0.029,0.534408646908647

2006-04-25,4.0,"Third Coast is a mecca for its Gold Coast neighbors and area students. It's a little like Uncommon Ground in its wine bar / coffeehouse / restaurant feel, but not quite as good. It's underneath an apartment complex, and its deep dark wood and dim lighting make it a romantic little winter nook. The food is good, the coffee and wine better.  It's crowded on the weekends, but is a good spot to meet a friend for a cup of coffee or do some work on your laptop.",0.4677,0.756,0.138,0.106,0.5
2006-04-22,5.0,"Every time I step through the door here, I feel life's problems drain away. The troubles of the day -- the week, even -- just seem trivial as the instrumental jazz softly blankets the room and creates a hazy, just plain relaxing atmosphere. The furniture is sturdy, the bud vases freshly filled, and the original pastels and watercolors hanging on the walls (all tastefully framed and up for sale) add a fresh feel to the space.  The food is very delicious, and today I began the day indulging my absolute gluttonous side with the stuffed French toast (with glazed walnuts, banana, melted brie, and banana liqueur) and a side of bacon (completely delicious, thick slices of deep red meat fried to a perfect non-crunchy solid crisp).    An added plus: the servers here are very attractive in a Greenwich Village/Chelsea loft artist sort of way. They were also very helpful; when I arrived after they'd stopped serving their brunch menu (through which the stuffed French toast is offered), I asked the server about my getting the stuffed French toast, and he went back and got confirmation from the kitchens that they would be able to make it for me. Wahoo!  Overall, a GREAT little brunch place. I didn't know about its late-night hours, so I'll be sure to add it now to my list of late-night munchies destinations!",0.983,0.812,0.153,0.035,0.48850793650793656

2005-09-06,5.0,"This place is a real hidden gem in an otherwise unbearably annoying, snobby neighborhood. They aim to have a real European feel, and succeed. When I used to have more time to hang out, I'd meet European au pairs and students all the time. There would also be older Russians and Italians playing chess or having intense discussions on politics, philosophy, or hawks picking up girls. The service varies widely, which is pretty authentically European, heh. The menu is good if slightly pricey, with excellent salads and a huge array of coffee, tea, italian sodas and alcoholic drinks.  Definitely a must to check out at least once.",0.9159,0.766,0.175,0.059,0.4833333333333334
