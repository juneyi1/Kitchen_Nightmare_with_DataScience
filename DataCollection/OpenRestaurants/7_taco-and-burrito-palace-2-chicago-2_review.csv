2017-08-19,5.0,"taco, rice, and beans heaven. Their dinner entrees are gigantuous and most under $10, satisfying both quality and quantity in mexican food. They grill all the meats in front of you, and each entree comes with two huge tubes of medium and mild(tomato based) salsa. The refried beans are top notch, and definitely rival anything I've had in Champaign (which btw Champaign has wonderful Mexican food). The tacos themselves are not your saucer sized tacos you'll get anywhere downtown, they are 2-corn tortillas stacked with a mountain of meat and tomatoes, sour cream, lettuce, and a flood of sauce options. Not to mention they give you TWO of those WITH a huge side of rice and beans, and you can choose from a list of meats...all for about $8.  Also tried the huevos rancheros (which also comes with rice and beans...almost everything here comes with large scoops of those two), which came with a large stack of hot corn tortillas; and the chimichanga (sooo good). So much food for such good value open at such a late time. Food coma man. Only thing is that chips don't come with your entree (but you wont have room for it anyways) and the horchata was a little watery (wouldn't recommend that option).",0.9691,0.869,0.123,0.008,0.5263975155279503

For starters, they were much bigger than I expected! Bear in mind that tacos here cost only 2 bucks and some change. Considering, we were there around midnight, the food was fresh and filling. Do drizzle some of their special hot sauce on your tacos for that kick.  Both the pollo and carne asada tacos were equally flavorful so it's hard to judge between them. I recommend ordering both! They could have gone a little easy on the lettuce in these tacos but I am not going to complain about it because half the lettuce always falls out as it is!

2014-01-04,5.0,"How can you give a dive Mexican restaurant 5 stars, you ask?  First off,  I'm from Phoenix, Arizona and don't expect to find much for Mexican cuisine outside of there, this place could survive easily in phoenix.  Secondly, the workers are real Mexicans, from Michocan, Mexico and speak great English with a side of enthusiasm. Lastly, they are consistent and clean.  This place is more than just drunk food.      The palace is not a dinner date place, or somewhere to take out business partners, but it definitely can be eaten on a daily basis if you really enjoy Mexican food like I do. After eating here for my second time, I really loved how the food was exactly the same as the first time. I have never had pastor that I liked until I came here.  The marinade was tangy, not salty, and had dimension.  I usually find pastor boring, but this was far from it.  The asada was great as well, finely diced and generous helpings.  These tacos are actually quite big and extremely reasonable.  Since I am from phoenix, I do not welcome anything but cilantro  onions and salsa on my tacos.  The cook informed us that they normally put lettuce , tomatoes and cheese on the tacos Because the area likes it.  OK no, I'm white, American and lived everywhere, and even I find this gross. My new mission is to change the views of people in America to stop wanting Taco Bell fixings on Mexican food!  The workers were pleased to hear us want only natural toppings on our food.    Don't worry, you will enjoy it better this way. The cilantro and onions were very finely chopped and the salsas were both incredible.  I can't believe I also found some decent corn tortillas in this city! Astonishingly enough, nothing was greasy at all, and that's hard to find in phoenix even.  My friend ordered a chorizo and egg burrito.  This always worries me because he is used to some of the finest chorizo ever made, and even I wonder if it can be topped.  Bulls eye, this was an amazing burrito.  The chorizo was very different than any chorizo I have ever had, in a GREAT way.. I believe it was the use of oregano that gave it such flavor.  The cook knew what he was doing when he made this burrito.  He gave us the perfect balance of eggs to chorizo and the tortilla was nicely grilled to crisp it up (very Chicago thing to do, I learned).  Beans and rice were on target, guacamole was pleasantly seasoned and fresh.    You cannot go wrong here.  They also just give u a free cup if you want water instead of charging you $2 for a bottle of water without knowing it, I appreciate that.  Please just clean up your table, it's the rude people who leave the tables dirty, that can ruin there's experiences. They are cooks, not servers or busboys here. They get busy and you are paying inexpensive prices, don't get it twisted.
