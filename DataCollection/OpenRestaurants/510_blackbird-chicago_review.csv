2017-08-28,5.0,"This review is for the pre-fixe lunch.  Everything was ON. POINT. From flavor to service to price, Blackbird definitely deserves its Michelin star.  Ambiance is casual chic; the timing of delivery for each dish was perfect (not too slow, not too fast). And $25 for a stellar 3 course meal?  Yes please...better than any restaurant week I'VE ever been to! (my words don't do it justice. * = favorites) Appetizers - Charred green beans, miso, chermoula, almond:  Usually I'm doubtful of greenbeans as a dish...but I loved the way they incorporated both regular greenbeans and tempura-style greenbeans - *Warm shrimp salad w/corn, chili, paprika oil:  Buttery shrimp swimming in a creamy yet balanced sauce Mains - Roasted whitefish with almond, cherry, sorrel:  soft flaky fish with a slight tartness from the cherry - Hanger steak w/white asparagus and strawberry:  A playful contrast of the flavorful steak and strawberry sauce Dessert - Cinnamon marshmallow ice cream. blackberries. rye graham cracker crumb:  Kind of like a fancy, dessert parfait - *Corn cake w/nectarine salsa and brown butter ice cream:  One of the more interesting desserts I've had...loved the mix of savory, sweet/tart, and brown sugary ice cream. My absolute favorite though....the special birthday dessert (not on the menu; specially made for birthdays, so definitely let them know if it's your birthday!).  A vanilla ice cream-filled dome covered with a thin chocolate shell on top of this flourless chocolate cake w/nibs.  Sounds simple and like something you'd get anywhere....but it's oh so magical",0.984,0.832,0.149,0.02,0.5984102564102564

I mean it was good...but you can buy 2 bottles of good red wine for that money.  *Quail was smoked...? And then warmed up? Well, that is the impression I got.  The sturgeon was delicious, definitely recommend it. Though hard to justify 40$ per plate price. All in all, price vs taste of food = only 3 stars.

Rarely do I have a meal where I can describe every course as amazing.  We started with the ahi tuna, which was probably the best raw tuna dish I've ever had. The lamb bacon and peas paired with the tuna is so unique and tasty. The cheese plate alone is worth coming here for. They brought out a selection of 10-12 cheeses, described all of them in depth and allowed us to choose what we wanted. When the cheeses were served, the board was perfectly plated with great additions such as marcona almonds, honey, quince paste, etc. We ended with the lamb, which was perfectly cooked and paired with delicious sausage and blueberries.

2017-08-09,5.0,Honest review: theres rarely a restaurant that wows me with flavor everything was amaizin n different some things were better then others but u will really be blown away with the complexity my only issues are too fix some dishes n make the desserts a lil better  Service was amaizin supper attentive knew the menu n described items n was amaizin only thing though the bus boys were arguing with servers about receiving more tip money it was awk Best things: scallop/sable/lamb/ duck/ pot de creme Scallop 18$ this was the best scallop dish i ever had. The mayo adds a richness the broth is hot n everything is cold n its really flavorful n a lil spicy so there is a play on temperatures the corn adds sweetness n the seaweed adds a briny taste to cut through the richness best dish of the nite Ahi tuna 22$ i usually dont like ceviches but this was really flavorful the bacon added a perfect rich salty smokey note that made the tuna decadent. The english peas and avocado adds freshness to cut through the richness my only complaint wish there was something acidic n spicy to cut through the richness Glazed pork belly 17$ best pork belly texture ever it melted like butter its a really rich and flavorful dish roe adds a briney flavor to cut through the richness the ginger was a nice touch added some heat n funk to cut through the richness only issue there was way to much like dial it back 10 notches n it would be the best dish worst appetizer of the nite cause of ginger issue but still awesome dish Cheese plate 20$ how it works is 1 is 8 bucks 3 is 20 6 is 40 n depending on what cheese u pick is what accompaniment u get. Theres like 10 different cheeses to choose from the accompaniments were great but the bread was pretty basic not oiled or like good bread or even crunchy naha still has the best cheese plate  Sable fish 40$ best dish of the nite the presentations odd everything is covered with alot of greenery its like a fish salad. The sauce is amaizin supper rich the fish was cooked perfectly melts in ur mouth n then theres fried sable that adds great texture n flavor to the dish the greens add a great bitteness to cut through the richness Lamb saddle 39$ this was amaizin lamb was supper tender the aioli adds great richness n the sausage adds a great salty flavor the blueberries add sweetness to cut through the sweetness n the leaks add a great sweet onion flavor the croutons are amaizin Aged rohan duck $40 be warned they said that duck is served here without crispy skin so i asked them to make it supper crispy i would recommend u do the same. I didnt think the lavender was gonna work because i hate lavender but i loved this dish its supper rich with acidic components to cut through the richness the mashed potatoes were to die for Grilled slagel farms striploin 43$ worst dish of the nite i did not like this at all the flavors didnt work together at all the sauce was bland didnt really add anyhting n the crab wasnt dressed or anything so it just didnt go with the steak needs revamping coming from a person who loves sweet n savory Sour dough Pot de creme 12$ best dessert of the nite its not to sweet n the flavors work perfectly together the pot de creme was the perfect texture  Mi amere chocolate torte 12$ second favorite dessert i hate dark chocolate but this was amaizim the olives added a great salty briney taste to cut through the sweetness the cherries added an acidic component to cut through the sweetness  Angel food cake 12$ tastes like fruity pebbles i didnt like this cake was dry n there wasnt enough candied fennel wasnt anything special  Tonka bean churrro 12 good but not great the churros were undercooked flavors worked well just expecting more Chocolate pistachio icecream bar 12$ i really liked this wasnt to sweet n all the flavors complimented each other loved the crunchy rice Bread service: i loved the bread it was a soughdough really flavorful the problem was the Honey mustard butter didnt pair well with it add more honey,0.9997,0.603,0.296,0.101,0.6047470238095237

2017-08-02,3.0,"Visiting home for a week and came here for lunch with a friend of mine. I drove past this place a few times before and I've been wanting to go for a while because of how fancy it looks from the outside. Years later, here we are, got a reservation for two at 12:15p. The waitress placed the menu in front of us and nicely asked if we have any questions. The menu is very short and simple, so it didn't take long for us to decide what to order. In summary, each of the dishes in the prix fixe menu looks better than it tastes, and it's just so disappointing. Let's start with the appetizer.  The warm shrimp salad: first bite, I thought ""mmm interesting, that flavor tastes very familiar""; second bite, it tastes like Pringles; third bite, yea I think they made a Sour Cream and Onion Pringles soup and put shrimp on top of it. The white fish: The fish was over cooked and there was too much sauce on the veggies and too many flavors going on with this dish. I don't remember all the ingredients that went into this, but  the flavors were all over the place, and the berry dressing certainly did not go well with the fish and the veggies. Hangar steak: Too chewy and the outside was too burnt. Nothing special about this one.   The fudgesicle: I think that's what they called it. The chocolate ice cream part was unbelievably salty. It's like very salted caramel chocolate with extra extra salt. Paired with cake, salted granola and two blueberries. This would've been a good dish if the ice cream wasn't so salty. The dishes are innovative, unique, but just not for me.",0.9693,0.883,0.101,0.016,0.40075268817204296
2017-07-28,5.0,"Blackbird was my first Michelin starred experience in my life and I'm glad it was. Even though the restaurant does only have one star, it looked really lives up to it's expectations.  They have a fixed price lunch deal for $25 that includes three courses. Me and my friend tried to get different place for every course and that would be able to try more plates. I was mesmerized just about how good everything we tried was; starting from the appetizers and all the way to the desserts.  I personally fell in love with the sturgeon. The way it was complemented by the strength of the mustard, the bitterness of the sorrey, the crunchiness if the nuts, and the sweetness of the berry sauce was absolutely astonishing. Every single bite of that entree provoked an explosion in my mouth.  Since that day, I promised myself I would dedicate more time to try either Bib Gourmand or Michelin star restaurants in the city.

2017-07-19,5.0,"I had high expectations for Blackbird after seeing that the Tribune ranked it earlier in 2017 as the 7th best restaurant in Chicago, sitting between Boka (#8) and Oriole (#6). At the same time, I was prepared as always for expectation to meet reality at some point(s) during the dining experience. The $25 lunch prix fixe menu looked attractive, so everyone at our table went for that; we each ordered different items so that we could have a taste of everything on the prix fixe menu. Since this restaurant already has 1260 reviews at the time of this writing, I won't dive into describing each specific dish. Well actually, that's just an excuse to stop typing isn't it? What I will certainly say though is that I enjoyed every single dish that was served here. If I had to choose a favorite dish from the prix fixe menu, it would be the warm shrimp salad appetizer. It was impressive in every aspect including taste, creativity, complexity, and presentation. As for a least favorite dish, I can't think of one. However, the least impressive dish would be the raspberry cheesecake dessert. Don't get me wrong; I'd love to eat this dessert over and over again, but it seemed to not be too difficult to replicate with the right ingredients at home. Besides the food, the restaurant was thoroughly elegant. Notable examples include the floral table decor, purse hooks, and even the boutique hand soap in the washrooms.  In all, reality met expectations here - not the other way around.

2017-07-16,1.0,"We visited Blackbird back in April. I am often in Chicago for work and used to go to Blackbird frequently. I was excited to take my husband for a very special dinner.  Well, they've done it. They've taken what used to be a very unique experience and ruined it. They have added so many tables that you could not slide past the one next to you without ass-skimming the side of it. If you were sitting in the chair facing the wall you could not even see the waiter unless your neck allowed your head to do a 180 degree turn. We should have left as soon as we got there.  It felt bad from the beginning. My husband's chair was on a plank that launched him out of his chair everytime someone trundled by - which wasn't our waiter as he'd abandoned us for some apparently very important table. The patriarch of such table started waving his arms, air kissing and ordering the waitstaff around the minute he got there and they obliged like sick little puppies.  If you keep the drinks flowing, there is usually little for me to complain about other than I may leave a bit more tipsy than intended...nope. One glass of wine. The number of men standing around in suits was distracting. It used to be a charming aspect of the service but with so many tables in the very tight space (there has to be a fire code violation there somewhere!) they were all bumping into eachother and appearing very confused about where to stand. It was a tense scene.  Take this one off of your bucket list. There are too many other wonderful options to waste your one night in Chicago on this one.",-0.898,0.833,0.067,0.099,0.523003663003663
2017-07-15,5.0,"Food: 500 Stars Service: 500 Stars I'm incredibly embarrassed because I had no idea Blackbird was a Michelin star restaurant until AFTER our trip to Chicago. We had just gotten off the train and dragged our tired bums to the restaurant, probably looking like big hot messes. Ugh. Please forgive me!!! I also didn't take photos because we were surrounded by business folks and I didn't want to be that ONE annoying foodie that was going to take photos of everything. Totally regretting that decision right now. Nonetheless, here goes my review... Approaching the unassuming white restaurant front, we noticed how full it was on a Wednesday afternoon. We were quickly greeted with a warm friendly smile and was ushered to our table where we would have the perfect view of the restaurant in motion. To the right of me I could see the staff on the floor attending the diners and quickly clearing tables. To my left I had a clear view of the kitchen and the beautiful coordination between the chef and his staff. I watched as they added the finishing garnishes and wiped plates clean. Each plate was an art form of its own and although they looked simple, their flavors were complex. We started with a couple of drinks  and their chilled cucumber gazpacho. This was not only beautifully served (composition was beautifully articulated) but, hands down, one of the best gazpachos we had ever had! The soup initially came out deconstructed with tomato jam, yuzu, and crispy biscuits. Our server then poured the cucumber mix into the bowl. There was a nice kick (hit you towards the back of your tongue) that paired so well with the sweet yuzu and acidic tomato jam.  My husband ordered the weekday prix fixe menu ($25) which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. This allowed you to try a little bit of everything at a reasonable price. Portions were perfectly sized that left you satisfied. (Also, Quality above Quantity) His entree was a hanger steak with white asparagus, green strawberry, and shallots. Tender and savory steak with a sweet side of strawberries and asparagus. He enjoyed it so much, he didn't say a word. Unfortunately, this also meant that there were no words that could adequately describe how amazing the dish was. His best attempt: ""Amazing."" I had the Shrimp Salad which was layered with all sorts of textures and contrasting flavors. This salad combined sweet yuzu and tang from the pickled shallots. The shrimp was tender and set on crunchy toasted bread. For dessert, I had the pleasure of trying their deconstructed raspberry cheesecake. In a small parfait glass, was layered with a surprisingly light and airy cheese cake, topped with a sweet raspberry sorbet, and garnished with toasted oats. My husband commented on how my eyes rolled behind my head when I took my first bite... I clearly had an out of body experience. haha I meant to talk with the floor manager before we left, but couldn't find him after we paid our bill. Everything was executed beautifully and we can't wait to come back to Chicago to try the rest of the menu out! Thank you for such a memorable experience!",0.9976,0.795,0.164,0.041,0.5354966717869942

We were able to make reservations to Blackbird just a few hours beforehand. It's a small-ish space, very white in decor, a bar in the front, and an open kitchen in the back. We were fortunate to sit in the back and see all the action. You can order the tasting menu or a la carte.

2017-07-13,5.0,"""Blackbird fly, Into the light of the dark black night."" Blackbird has flown straight to my top 5 favorite restaurants in Chicago and just writing this review is long overdue and has me currently sitting in a state of euphoria reminiscing about my dining experience here.  It is a downright shame [not really] how emotional I get in response to an absolutely delicious meal. Perfectly prepared dishes, mixed with a beautiful scene, completed by A+ customer service...Blackbird has it all and it is no wonder how/why they have been lauded with accolades and awards. I visited Blackbird on my lunch hour during the week. The restaurant was not as busy as I anticipated (more than likely due to the time of day I opted for the meal) and consequently, I was able to talk more with the staff - whom all seemed genuinely happy to be employed at Blackbird. A 3-course lunch prix fixe menu was certainly what I needed that day, and for $25...honestly there is no better deal in the city for this quality and caliber of food. I opted for the warm shrimp salad, the cod, and the deconstructed raspberry cheesecake. I even ordered the angel food cake dessert a la carte because after my 3 courses (and the complimentary piece of bread), I was simply not ready for my experience at Blackbird to end. Although the portion sizes here are, in fact, on the tinier side, this was to be expected considering the restaurant is known for its tasting menu approach to food. Nevertheless, starting the meal with the bread kicked my ""fullness"" into gear, and each of the desserts contributed to the completion of my appetite also.  Flavor-wise, Blackbird delivered strongly. The warm shrimp salad was every bit of savory, acidic, tart, crunchy, and chewy all at once. The cod was lightly fried, with a fresh, oceanic flavor in each bite. The fish itself was every bit as fleshy as I would have hoped for. The cherry and mustard greens that accompanied the dish added the sweet/sour juxtaposition needed for the heaviness of the fried fish.  Both desserts blew me away. There is nothing better than consuming fresh fruits that are in season and raspberries are full hype currently. Unbeknownst to me initially, both desserts featured the raspberry. The cheesecake was deconstructed and resembled more of a parfait. It was sweet, yet tart, creamy but not heavy as a traditional NY style cheesecake. The angel food cake was absolutely beautifully plated and executed. The cake was light and moist as it shouldve been - and the white chocolate bits added an amazing chewy bite that was certainly well played as it stood against the sorbet and cake. This was an all around superb meal and I can't imagine another restaurant in Chicago that is offering a better lunch.",0.995,0.843,0.143,0.014,0.5767249757045675
2017-07-12,4.0,I give Blackbird restaurant four stars from five because I did not like the sour bread nor the tangy butter.   I also had a bad experience with the bus boys because they were after one of the server telling him not to pocket all the tip money.  The portion were very small and overly priced.  The desserts were very good.  I had better service at Everest and better food at Greenriver.  Too bad this restaurant has a Michelin star and it really does not deserve it.  My son insist in trying all the Michelin stars restaurants in Chicago.   It is very hard to find one that really has the WOW factor since we all know how to cook.   I had to sent the duck Breast back because it was not crispy.   Tip of the day for a crispy skin in any game bird let the bird  air dry first and the skin will crips in really hot oil when seared.   The desserts  were the star here they were very delicious specially the chocolate ice cream cake dome is was magnificent.  Thank you so much big spender xoxo,0.9633,0.809,0.139,0.052,0.5346130952380952

Lo and behold, the Blackbird weekday prix-fixe menu, $25 for appetizer, entree, and dessert?! That's a steal! Service is fantastic, and the wait staff is very knowledgeable of the ingredients and entire cooking process of all the dishes. Be sure to ask them as many questions as you need to! Yes, the quality is amazing, earning them raving reviews and a Michelin star, but it's missing a certain playfulness and creativity that I was expecting. Chilled cucumber gazpacho with tomato jam, yuzu, and crispy biscuits was a refreshing appetizer on a summer day. There was a spiciness that pairs perfectly with the yuzu and tomato jam. Grilled sturgeon with almond, cherry, sorrel, and mustard was a pretty small entree, but still delicious. The almond reduction used a flavorful fish stock, and the ""fish hushpuppy"" was fantastically fried. Rasberry chesecake, toasted oat, and sweet lily sorbet was the heavier dessert choice on the menu. The oats were perfect crunch with the cheesecake and sorbet.

The restaurant is pretty small, and the tables have to be pulled out for guests to squeeze into the booths. You are VERY close to the table beside you. Also, the restaurant is relatively loud.  We started the meal with a few drinks and appetizers. The appetizers were all awesome! We shared the pork belly, the ahi tuna, the crispy artichoke and grilled shrimp appetizers. I would highly recommend any of them. It seemed like there was quite a long lag in time between our appetizers and main course. The waiter only stopped by the table when bringing food (seemed like he was avoiding the fact we were waiting so long.) Our entrees arrived and those who ordered the lamb had the best entrees. The vegetarian agnolotti dish and the scallops/cod dinners were just eh. We finished the meal with the passionfruit bar dessert and the chocolate ganache. The ganache was the better of the two.

2017-06-02,3.0,"I'm kind of surprised this place is Michelin starred at all, to be totally honest. We came here for my birthday back in December and the reservation had been made 1-2months prior - we were still made to wait in a crowded, wet huddle by a drafty door packed with other patrons (and essentially heaped on top of the poor table by the door - it was very cold and rainy that night) for 35+ minutes. The area was effectively a slip and slide pooled with water and soggy people. No drinks, no real waiting area, no gestures of apology (be it a drink to make the wait go by or an acknowledgement that this is totally ridiculous), nada. It felt like overwhelmed amateur hour at the hostess stand.  Once we were finally seated, we were sharply wedged in the long row of tightly packed tables on the left side of the restaurant - which isn't ideal but I don't mind being a little cramped if I'm about to have my mind blown by tasty things. As it turns out, I was not about to have my mind blown.  Our best courses were actually the free starter and the bread...there was this incredible bone broth concoction that I would quite literally bathe in if given the option and some awesome homemade bread with pumpkin butter situation that was to die for. Everything else was kind of lackluster - even the duck, which I'm such a sucker for. What struck us as kind of hilarious was that, with our cheese course we ordered for dessert, the bread was a far cry from what we had been served and loved earlier, in that it was rock hard and clearly stale. I personally wouldn't go back - although it looks like their menu has changed since then so maybe they've stepped it up a bit?  Our service was good once seated, but it doesn't really make up for the unfortunate pre-meal experience and the so-so food, but hey, everyone has an off night - but it won't be on my dime again.",0.9402,0.796,0.12,0.084,0.5905328798185943

For the not so good, when I made the reservation, I advised of a lactose allergy and asked if the tasting menu could be adjusted for that -- no problem.  When we were seated and reminded the server of our allergy, there was lots of scurrying back and forth between the chef and server.  It was now a problem.  Honestly, we wouldn't have come if we knew this up front because we always opt for the tasting menu when a restaurant offers one.   Also, we had a reservation and were kept waiting in a corner by the front door for almost fifteen minutes even though the table we were seated was empty and set for service the entire time.

He liked this but the portion was quite large so he couldn't finish. For dessert, i had the chocolate ganache which I really did not enjoy. We all agreed the chocolate-rose ice cream was overpoweringly rose and ruined the dish. My parents had the elderflower semifreddo and strawberry tapioca. Basically, the desserts are totally skip-able. Interestingly, we had eaten at Beatrix the night before and the difference in service was quite noticeable considering this was a Michelin starred restaurant. We saw about 4 different servers throughout the night, many time they repeated steps without realizing someone had just asked us or taken our order etc. also a pretty impressive blunder was someone refilled my half empty tap water with sparkling water.

2017-04-27,3.0,I was kind of disappointed by blackbird. I saved it for my last meal in Chicago since it was a Michelin starred restaurant. I came for lunch at 11:30 and was barely greeted by a surly host. He asked me where I wanted to sit and I said anywhere with good lighting. He gave an exasperated sigh and looked around like he didn't know where to put me. Another hostess came by and said let's seat Nancy by the window. Ok. Not hard.  Once I was seated I ordered the prix fixe along with a hamburger off the regular menu. I was warned it would be too much food (challenge accepted) but proceeded anyway. I also got coffee. To start there is a lovely wedge of bread with whipped butter. I don't know what they do to their butter but it has a fluffy texture with an almost citrusy aftertaste. It was really good. The bread was soft but had a lovely crust coated with oats. It was sweet and complex and went well with the butter. I wish I was given another wedge of bread.  Then came my brussels sprouts. Totally delicious. Probably my favorite thing of the entire meal. They were warm shredded Brussels sprouts with crispy fried onions. All this was served with a bright dressing. I already forgot what was in it. But it was really good.  Then my duck confit and hamburger with fries came. The duck was perfect. I don't often get well cooked duck so I was very impressed. It was sweet and moist. The duck sausage was also delicious. I don't think I have ever had duck sausage. The purée it sat on was light and delicious. The hamburger was actually my biggest complaint. The buns were so burned I actually gave it back to the waiter after I took one bite. It was inedible since it ruined the taste of the burger itself. He brought back a fresh burger in no time but I still didn't care for it. The ramps on the burger were good but I think they gave me too much. I don't like onion rolls much either so as a whole I really didn't enjoy this dish.  For dessert I had the yellow cake with banana ice cream and candied bacon. This took me awhile to enjoy. Once the ice cream melted it tasted like my childhood. Like the best bowl of cereal you've ever had in your life while watching Saturday morning cartoons. The candied bacon was  not truly candied so I didn't care for it much. But overall I thought this dish ended my meal well.  I guess I would recommend this if you want to try something nice for lunch.

The kitchen and expediting counter are right at the back of the restaurant, so there's always some activity. The chefs are professional and focused. A pleasure to watch.  And the food that comes out of the kitchen is a testament to their craft. Soup was creamy and rich, but still somehow light. Shrimp salad was the dish of the day, full of texture and umami interest. My chicken sandwich with chicken liver hot sauce was a touch heavy for me, but it was an undeniably tasty dish. Fries were crispy.  Similarly successful were the wine offerings - plenty to choose from around the world, with France being particularly well-represented. I've come to terms with the high prices of wine in Chicago, and the prices here are in line with nearly everywhere else we went.  I had to notch the rating down a bit for the service. There were woefully few people on the floor, which was a shame because the service was quite warm, professional and pleasant when it was around. But providing that kind of service takes time, and having one fellow serve half the restaurant just won't work when attempting that level of service. We and the tables around us often found ourselves with empty wine glasses, and the wait for the food was significant. I wouldn't be able to come here for a business lunch (luckily I was on vacation) due to the time commitment. Oddly, they had a large number of bussers walking around, but they didn't seem to have been given enough responsibilities.

It is 3 courses prix fixe for $25.The restaurant was pretty busy for lunch time; some larger groups that seem to be on a work lunch or casual, younger diners. I started with a cocktail. It was the color of Country Time pink lemonade; tasting tart and overall a good choice with gin as the liquor base. For the first course, I chose charred brussels sprouts with smoked caulifllower, castelvetrano olive, and grapefruit. The sprouts were wonderful, but I was having food envy over my dining partner's turnip soup which looked amazing. We both ordered the grilled sturgeon, which was delicious. Only Blackbird could turn a funky looking fish like sturgeon into such a pretty dish. To end, I had the key lime dessert. It was refreshing and a nice cap to the meal. The pacing of the courses was poor. Our dessert took quite some time to come out. Our server realized the lag and offered some dessert wine to compensate.  Overall, the lunch special is a true value but definitely budget the time out for a longer lunch.",0.9867,0.731,0.214,0.055,0.6477142857142857

2017-02-15,5.0,"Blackbird. Home to a James Beard Award and Best Chef of the Midwest winner. Home to another James Beard Award for Best Restaurant Design and Best Restaurant Design Graphics. Named the Jean Banchet 2017 Restaurant of the Year. And of course, a one Michelin star restaurant. Noted for their Midwestern, farm-fresh cuisine, Blackbird is one of those restaurants that executes complex flavors in elegant dishes. This is probably not your average dine-out restaurant, given that most entrees are around $40. But if you're looking to impress, look no further.  The decor is minimalist and bright. Tables are crammed next to each other, which adds to the energy of the place. Service is impeccable; servers are always moving about swiftly and efficiently to serve and clear plates and utensils and to refill drinks.  I've heard their prixe-fixe lunch menu is quite a bargain so for those strapped for cash but want to experience this Chicago staple, that may be the ticket. The menu has everything from quail to king trumpet mushroom to sturgeon, duck breast, rabbit, and suckling pig. We decided to try their winter tasting menu, hoping to get bites of all the best Blackbird has to offer.  +Herbed chicken broth tea, leek and pea tart with cured egg yolk, cromesquis of duck with smoked red seaweed +Arpege egg with cauliflower cream, crispy potato, and osetra caviar +Rye berry porridge with malted apple and black truffle +Confit of king trumpet mushroom with dulse and dried duck +Gentled smoked hamachi with royal trumpet, schmaltz pudding and ginger consommé  +Squab leg zampone with fermented cranberry, cooling herbs and buttermilk +Roasted squab rack with ember charred persimmon, nicoise olive crème anglaise, and pot pie of winter squash +Kalamansi ""egg"" in a nest +Cotton cheesecake with pomelo and mint licorice  +Chicory hot chocolate with chestnut The tasting menu is $125 per person. If you want to get the wine pairing, it's $70 extra. For 10 courses, it may not be the most inexpensive meal but for what you're getting at a restaurant of exceptional caliber, it's a bargain. I have nothing but good things to say about each course. I especially liked the herbed chicken broth tea (which they bring out in a teapot and pour into glasses at your table) and the roasted squab with the pot pie. I was very impressed with the simplistic execution but complex notes of each beautifully plated dish. Even the cocktail I had was well-designed and complemented the food perfectly. The food, the service, the ambiance were all outstanding. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.",0.9963,0.835,0.155,0.01,0.5814583333333332

This place is tiny, so definitely make reservations. As a side note I haven't looked into this, but I heard they also offer a 3 course menu normally for $25.00, so we only saved $3.00, but oh well....the food was delicious! One thing I have to mention first is the service! It was AMAZING!!! Our server was so kind and really knowledgeable of the menu cause quite a few things I didn't know what they were. Another Side Note: If you are going for restaurant week the menu items for appetizers and dessert is different in restaurant than what is on Choose Chicago site online. Still good selections to choose from though. This is not the place to go to if you're starving. The portion sizes are really small, but the quality of food is outstanding. I feel like the 3 courses made for a satisfying meal. I wasn't stuffed nor starving when I left. It was perfect. My friend and I ordered the exact same thing for each course cause it's not really dishes that you can share due to the size.  We started with a shrimp soup like appetizer and nearly licked the bowl it was so good. For our main entrée we went with the hanger steak that included crispy rice, mushroom, quince, and horseradish. Delicious combination! The only thing I was a little disappointed in was the dessert option. I was really looking forward to trying the pecan pie, but the menu had changed for restaurant week and it was either a cookie or a pudding dessert. I should of went with the cookie in hindsight based on my usual preferences, but I tried the Mile Chocolate Sesame pudding. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. It was a very light dessert.

Came here with a friend for Chicago's Restaurant Week because the lunch deal is $22 for 3 courses, which is such a steal for a Michelin-starred restaurant! Overall tasty food but this place is slightly overhyped.  Both of our appetizers were way too salty - we got charred brussel sprouts, and a warm shrimp salad, and both were over seasoned. Not a good start of the meal, but the entree changed our minds. The grilled sturgeon was perfectly cooked, tender and soft, and the charred cabbage and sour pomelo worked wonders on the dish. The duck conflit was sweet and sour, also delicious with the cavatelli pasta. The real spotlight of the meal, though, is the dessert! Chocolate sesame pudding with banana bread ice cream, and marshmallow lime parfait. Refreshing and sweet, and portion sizes are just right.

No fluffiness to the food cake at all. - Winter coupe: omg, the banana bread ice cream was to die for. There were some dishes that I like more than others but all of them were presented beautifully.

My only complaint would b that the duck fat wasn't rendered enough for my liking. For dessert I had the bread pudding, which was super creamy and perfectly balanced. We also tried the white chocolate cake, which had a nice peppermint crumble. The carrot cake was gorgeous and light. We also received a free dessert that was made accidentally, which was awesome.

First off, you need to know what to expect. It would be a crime to not allow yourself to indulge in an appetizer, a drink, and a dessert, given that EVERYTHING they served to me and my friends was absolute perfection. Don't expect a cheap meal.  To emphasize how amazed I was with this meal, I would like to say that I was literally trying to find things WRONG with the food, but I couldn't.  My table started off with a few appetizers, including the brussel sprouts, the sweetbread (ABSOLUTE perfection, and I had never tried sweetbread before so if you haven't PLEASE get it), and the quail roulade. For my entree, I got the pan roasted striped bass which was without a doubt one of the best fish I've ever had in my life. I need another paragraph to talk about this bass - the entree came with POMELO (a fruit similar to grapefruit for those who don't know), dill, and FROG LEGS. I don't know who decided to put this stuff together, but the flavors complimented each other so well! I also need to talk about the SODA I got. I got their honey mint Chicago soda and it was FLAWLESS. I really don't know how they made it (or where they got it from, cause I would love to buy that...), but it was such a delicate and SUBTLE mix of honey and mint that it went perfectly with my meal.  FInally, the DESSERT. I ordered their pumpkin tart, and I was thinking to myself...maybe this is where Blackbird goes wrong, they won't be able to make an amazing dessert! They proved me wrong - the tart was also PERFECT. As you can see, I really can't stop raving about this place. Thinking about this place makes me smile, and there aren't many restaurants out there that can elicit such strong emotions from me from just memory. Few things I'd like to make a note about before I end my review: 1. Make reservations! 2. The place is pretty small so it may be kind of hard to find for some people...it's right next to Avec, another very popular Chicago restaurant. This place is pretty cramped, so don't expect a super intimate dinner. 3. There's a $25 three course lunch menu which looked amazing but I went for dinner so could not try it! Given how much I loved their dinner, I'm sure their lunch would be absolute amazing for $25. All in all, this place is worth every dime I spent here. I absolutely recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago, and I will definitely be back. This restaurant exceeded what I expected from a Michelin restaurant.

We got a prix fixe three course menu for $25 each, which (given the nature of the food) is quite reasonable. There were several issues with the service, however, that turned this from a 5-star experience to a three. First, someone brought our Amuse, put both of them square in front of my partner, mumbled something about what it physically consisted of, then left. We had no idea it was intended as an amuse, and thought it might be some weird presentation of her first course. Only later, when our first courses arrived, did the waiter mention the plates squarely in front of here were intended as amuse bouche. Next, my partner chose duck confit, and pulled a very long, VERY SHARP duck bone out of her mouth! Finally, they totally forgot our water order.

2016-12-11,5.0,"From the moment we walked in until we left 2 1/2 hours later, Blackbird was perfection. First the staff is exceptional. Sarah, who was technically our server, acted more as our coordinator/guide for the entire meal. I started off the Althea's Ghost cocktail and I was a bit scared of the inclusion of egg white. Sarah explained it was more as a ""binding"" ingredient and the drink did not taste ""eggy"". She was right and it was a pleasant cocktail although a bit too sweet for more than one. We choose the tasting menu to get a feel of all the unique offerings.  The egg with  smoked cauliflower was a great, silky smooth start. The abalone mushroom & dried duck was the only ""miss"" of the night. The mushrooms were a bit rubbery and I couldn't tell what was mushroom and what was duck. But everything from there was exceptional. The hamachi had a great smokey flavor, even if the matsutake mushrooms were slightly out of place. The squab zampone has a fermented cranberry sauce that smacks you in the face with it's amazing, strong flavor. The sauce is then tempered with cooling herbs & buttermilk. My absolute favorite was the rack of squab with the winter squash pot pie. This dish was easily one of the best things I've ever eaten. The cotton cheesecake and chicory hot chocolate finished off the meal perfectly.  My only ""gripe"" would be that if you are a party of two and are seated against the east wall, you will be VERY close to other diners. So close that if the person sitting against the wall needs to get up during dinner, the staff has to move the tables next to you to allow you to get out. You're also so close that I wouldn't recommend having any deep personal conversations.  The people on your left & right will know all your business.  My husband mentioned that he felt it was too bright in the restaurant but I actually liked the lighting because I was able to see the food and its components better.  This is an exceptional restaurant that delivers incredible food by a team that is easily one of the best I've ever seen in a restaurant.

I've visited this restaurant before with my parents a year ago and decided to pay another visit (I'm from California, grew up in Bay Area and went to LA for school....so I grew up eating in the SF/LA foodie scene).  FOOD: Squash cavatelli: delicious!! The smell and taste of the pasta was amazing, fresh, and so earthy. The squash was sweet and the walnuts were a great addition. The dish was a touch too sweet for me, but I still enjoyed it and cleaned my plate. Flounder: this dish came with poached flounder, turnips, pear, and creamed spinach. I've never had dairy with fish before, but this was a lovely surprise. Truly unique and indulgent. Carrot cake: I'm usually not a huge fan of this dessert because it's too dense and sweet, but this one was just right! It was a lovely take on a classic. There were large pieces of tangerine and pineapple to complement the soft gooey cake. It wasn't too sweet at all! My bartender Anthony also made a drink to accompany it.  No. 6: this was like a Pimm's cup; refreshing and light, just what I was expecting. Overall, I had a lovely experience not only due to he food but also because of the amazing service I had.

However, only the main courses lived up to the expectation of a Michelin-starred restaurant. We started with a pretty tasty amuse, and delicious bread with sweet potato honey butter. The bread was truly excellent and started us on a great note of fall flavors. The starters, cauliflower soup and beef tartare, were pleasant but not unique. Honey on the beef tartare was an interesting idea, but the soup was generic. The main courses are where the kitchen really shines. The hanger steak was covered in a really flavorful broth, and the whole dish was really rich and savory. The grilled sturgeon was out of this world. One of the most delicious and inventive dishes I've ever had. It was covered in smoked cream with grapes, and each element was really unique and worked together really well. Our mind was blown. Dessert was pleasant but not memorable. The worst part of this experience was the service. The service was AWFUL for this level of restaurant. Nobody explained each course, dishes were dropped unceremoniously onto the table (the bread was literally thrown by a waiter onto our plate), plates went uncleared, and overall there was a feeling of harried stress in the restaurant. It was not relaxing and it seemed like nobody was in charge. Overall, I have to give out 4 stars for the combination of great price and wonderful mains.

We went for the Mesquite Funnel Cake, and it was nothing short of amazing. Not being a sweets fan, I felt this dessert was equal parts sweet and savory.

While this was a letdown, we were even more dispirited with the way that our waiter had responded when we let him know that we were not pleased with how the dish had turned out. He gave us an attitude and would shoot us occasional dirty glances from across the room. He did take the duck confit off the bill, but his actions up to that point were less than assuaging.

My husband and I have been wanting to come in to Blackbird for sometime and when it showed up in Chicago's most romantic restaurants, we decided to call and make reservations. Our reservations were at 8 and we got there 2 mints to 8. Staff greeted us right away and were pleasant. They stated that our table was being cleaned and it would only take a few minutes so we got directed to the bar. Then the host came to ask if we preferred inside or out as they were going to have openings on both. Not being picky we stated that either worked. Since we were waiting the husband decided to have wine. He had the most amazing bordeaux ever. Being pregnant I tried it and was so jealous of him. By 825, we asked if the table was ready and staff said that they were working on it. Meanwhile we noticed that other people were being seated. By 845 the bar comped his wine and we sat outside. My husband ordered another glass of wine. By 905 staff came over to give us bread and by then it was already too late and it seemed that we were even close to ordering. We had somewhere to be at 930 and there was no chance we were going to make it so we decided to leave. We asked for the check and they comped the second glass of wine and apologized. I was excited to try the place as the menu was so creative and inviting but very surprised by the service. Were we not high class enough for the joint?

I understand the chef tries to put Midwest and summer elements such as blueberries, corn, and tomato into the menu; however, that does not mean one should repetitively try to use the same ingredients for multiple dishes. The flavor lacks complexity and sometimes was a bit blend. One of the dishes contained scrambled eggs. The eggs were pre-cooked into a mini pancake shape. It's ok to pre-cook stuff; however, my scrambled egg was not reheated properly so that the center was still cold. Since the  scrambled egg was cooked with a high ratio of egg yolk, it was very greasy when it's not hot enough. This was one of the few flaws from the busy kitchen. I would say most eaters would not even notice detail like this. For me, it was a major setback.  The dessert was very pathetic for the tasting menu, although I believe whatever is in the regular menu might be better. The only good thing about this meal was that they remember it was my birthday and brought me a little complementary birthday cake.  Service-wise, I visited in a busy evening when the dining room was fully booked. We ordered the tasting menu. A few different servers brought us our dishes and it was a bit of a mess. For example, I witnessed two of our plates went around the dining room and then eventually got back to our table even though our table was right next to the open kitchen. While the server explained most of the dishes to us, two dishes were just dropped off at our table without mentioning what they were. This was due to the fact that the restaurant was probably a bit over capacity. I understand that hospitality is a tough and competitive business, but I don't think that's how a Michelin star restaurant should operate. To maintain a high level, they should consider cut 10-20% of their guests.  Lastly, one of the bowls for the dessert was clearly dirty. See picture for detail. Again, lots of the plates and serving wears were a bit old and need an upgrade.

We ordered the 10 course tasting menu and a bottle of wine. The wine took FOREVER to show up. Our first course had come out and the wine still hadn't been brought to our table. The first couple of courses were very good and would have warranted a 4 star review from me. But then one of the dishes came out super super salty and we had to send it back. We were told that there was actually no salt added to the plate but the salt was from the natural flavor of the ingredients. We had them make us a complete new round of food which was a bit better. However, the next dish that came out was also high on the salty side but barely tolerable and we didn't want to send another plate back so we ate as much as we could. I did notice 3 other tables sending dishes back as well. One of the ladies sitting next to our table barely touched her steak and because it wasn't cooked to the way she liked it. She didn't send her plate back but just said she didn't want anything else.  The restaurant itself is very very loud. They have an open kitchen so you can see the chefs cooking but this kind of attributed to the noise level. Also, the tables are really bunched up together and if you have to go to the bathroom, it is a bit of a squeeze to get through all the tables clumped together. Not sure if I'll be coming back. I might give it some time before considering a return.",0.9662,0.897,0.084,0.019,0.37628114478114477

The food was a huge disappointment for an establishment of this caliber. It wasn't a matter of unrealistic expectations as we are very easy to please. As previous reviewers stated everything was extremely under-seasoned considering how conceptually involved the dishes were. The fluke crudo lacked any depth or texture, The squash agnolotti at $32 was borderline inedible due to an overwhelming amount of citrus in the sauce.  The only saving grace was Sean who was cordial and attentive.

We got the salad that came with a poached egg that they break into and it oozes all into the salad and onto the piece of think cut bacon chucks. It was a good salad For dinner: I got the poached halibut with crabmeat salad, duck fat sauce  and theses other  amazing sauces. It all mixed and went together so wonderfully! I throughly enjoyed and would highly recommend this dish My boyfriends dinner:  For the suckling pig pave and tenderloins. Oh my goodness it was out of this world.

Favorite entrees- Duck Breast, Tuna, and Halibut Dessert- Coconut Tapioca (unexpected take and the presentation and taste is very good!)

Service: Hostess and wait staff are all great. They are a bit serious and can come off a bit pretentious, but you are going to a fancy restaurant, so I guess thats to be expected.

2016-07-17,4.0,"This place is top notch! I'm not a huge lobster fan but I had the lobster appetizer that literally melted in my mouth I think they poached it in HEAVEN. Most places over cook lobster but this was flawless. My wife had a turnip soup with smoked foie gras. Really nice. Didn't blow my mind like the lobster though. I then had a Rohan duck breast (all I could think when I saw ""Rohan"" duck was The Lord of the Rings. Lol...""We ride onward to Rohan!...famed for its delicious DUCK!...Then off to Mordor for some donuts"") Aaaanyway...where was I? Oh yea. Duck had some rhubarb and duck sausage with it. Sausage was incredible. Sauce lacked seasoning a little. My wife had the agnolotti which were utter PERFECTION. Dessert was Black Forest cake with kaffir lime. I LOVED this. I loved it because not only was it crazy good but it really delivered on Black Forest, with the brandied cherries but it had this kaffir lime granita type thing on it too that was INCREDIBLE. I'll eat anything with kaffir lime. If you haven't had kaffir lime, ask a good Thai restaurant to make you something with kaffir lime in it. If they don't have it...LEAVE. It's NOT THAI! Coffee was Intelligencia so obvious awesome. Service was 5-stars all around. Very knowledgeable server who actually knew FOOD. Usually very rare. On a side note I myself am a chef and did a stage here many moons ago (pronounced ""stajh""...its French for like a one day internship/trial to see if you want to work there and if the chef WANTS you to work there). At the time, Paul Kahan (sp.?) was still there daily and it was his only place. He was extremely cordial and kind. He made me an offer but the parking alone would have been half my days pay! Prep is also done in like a dark basement. Not too inviting. Open kitchen was fun though working service. I ended up working at MK North instead. Big mistake. I won't say why out of respect for Mr.Kornick. Anyway, if you've got a spare $300 and need to impress a date, go here! This is for you guys. Cough it up if she's worth it!

My sister and I got different things so we can share. The Rabbit Sausage was tender and paired so creatively with parsley root and fennel. The spinach soup was the best I have ever had- spinach wise. Grilled Walleye was fantastic- beautiful presentation and cooked perfectly. The hanger steak was great too- classic and I recommend ordering it medium rare. Both desserts of dark chocolate brownie and spring coupe were fantastic.

Once I walked in I saw plenty of empty tables and was seated promptly. My server, unfortunately seemed to be the only one working. I asked for the tasting menu (spring 16) and within a few minutes I received my first course and pairing, most of the courses were good, with the spring onion and nasturtium soup being the highlight. Other courses such as the strawberry with aleppo pepper (an ingredient I grew up with) was not only unremarkable but really nauseating; the flavors did not work together at all and served in a bowl over melted ice? Not appetizing. Some of the pairings were underwhelming as well, especially the beer which was more bitter than a 50 year old divorcee, ha ha. The coconut and matcha dessert on the other hand were both excellent. I also ordered coffee which came in a charming french press, but having been advised that taxis take a while to call I asked for one, unfortunately it took about 30 seconds despite my waiter's advice and I had to leave my coffee untouched.  The most disappointing part of my dinner was the service; I am a chef and was hoping to get more time with the server to explain some of the ingredients/technique. But he was busier talking to the bartender or serving other couples. I did not ask for much but a server should be amiable and make your experience more enjoyable; instead I felt like a burden.

We sent the plate back to the chef, but he said that it's normal. Total BS! I'm from California and I sometimes get fresh seafood live from local fishermen, so I know what good seafood should taste like, and the quality of seafood at Blackbird is utterly horrific. The other main dishes and sides/appetizers were not good either. That said, the duck was reasonably good but was still undercooked and could have been more flavorful. Service was ridiculously slow, and it took over 3 hours for all of the food to come. It's too loud and they pack so many people in this small room that I was rubbing my arms with the people at the next table.

It is busy because the food is excellent.  I had heard good things about the endive salad so we started with that.  The salad comes in a crispy potato ""bowl"" and is filled with endive, baby lettuces, house made pancetta and topped with an over easy egg.  The waiter cuts it all up together and you get a light, refreshing, yet salty and rich salad that is held together with an awesome mustard vinaigrette. We both went with the lunch prix fixe menu.  I love that a restaurant of this caliber makes fine dining accessible to people that might otherwise be turned off from fine dining by prices.  The prix fixe is $22 for 3 courses.  They also serve a huge chunk of sourdough bread with butter and shaved olives. My three courses included chilled pea soup (my favorite course of the three) that was incredibly fresh with lovely hints of lemon.  My second course was the duck sausage with fava beans and my third course which was the same as my husband was the blondie brownie with a scoop of chocolate ice cream topped with caramel popcorn.  My husband went with the rabbit sausage and gnocchi for his first course and the walleye for his second course. Also notable to mention were the cocktails.  Our waiter helped steer me in the direction of the Comeback cocktail which was so good I ordered two.  My husband opted for the Allocated Old Fashioned times 2 drinks.  By the time we wrapped up with cocktails, app and three course, we had spent more than the $22 prix fixe would have indicated, but it was well worth it.",0.975,0.893,0.102,0.005,0.49305555555555564

We asked for different selection but were ignored. The food was just strange and for the price of the entree to get 4 oz's of hanger steak that was not hot nor was flavorful- ridiculous. . Served steak with a tater tot- not really but that was the consistency and flavor was not as good as some tots. Strange yogurt sauce with a couple onion petals that were pickled. The onion petals were the best part of the entire meal.

PK restaurants are my absolute favorite and have not failed me in the past so I felt like it was a no-brainer.  Unfortunately I can't really go through item by item and explain my feelings about each (as I normally would) because quite honestly, nothing stands out. Forgettable dishes that came sort of close to being memorable but missed. I want to stress that none of the food was bad per se, just meh.  I will say that the complimentary bread and butter was some of the best I've had - I remember that and still want more.   If I'm eating pea-sized portions of food that are extravagantly priced, I need to be blown away. Like both bites have to be heavenly. I found myself questioning whether or not it was ever going to stand out. Even through the dessert course :*( To subtract from our experience even more, we weren't very blown away by our server who made super quick stops and kind of made us feel like we were an inconvenience.

My second favorite was the poached lobster - the waiter poured a lobster broth into the dish, and the broth was very savory and delicious. Also recommended. The frog legs and rabbit loin were decent.

Bouillabaisse was exquisite in presentation and the broth was more like a consommé which overwhelmed the dish, therefore could not appreciate the seafood.  Desserts did not seem to marry the ingredients well and more focus as a Jackson Pollack representation.

The only option available for Restaurant Week was lunch, and 1:15pm was the only reasonable time available on a Friday. I've been wanting to check out Blackbird, but yes, the three dollar signs do scare me. Therefore, $22/person is a great deal for Blackbird! The ambiance is very modern and classy. Be weary that the tables are so close together that they literally have to move the table aside for you to inch your way in to the booth seating, and it's easy to listen to the conversations next to your table. It didn't help that my friend tends to talk extra loud, and the couple next to us ate in silence throughout most of their meal. Aiy yai yai. Prior to our meal, we were given amuse-bouche and a slice of bread each after. This was a nice touch since I wouldn't have been full at the end of the meal otherwise. It wasn't until my coworker informed me that I knew about the change in the Restaurant Week menu. The online menu for the appetizer and dessert is different than the actual menu. Appetizer - Rabbit sausage: I've never had a rabbit sausage before, but this was pretty mouth-watering and my favorite course. It wasn't greasy nor overly salty. Entree - Duck confit: It was difficult to get all the meat off the bone with just a knife and fork, but I managed in the end. This was a scrumptious dish. My friend ordered the hanger steak, which was delicious as well. Between the two, I would recommend ordering the steak. Dessert - Winter coupe: It was good, but I felt like I was eating a heavy cream rather than ice cream. I liked the dessert, but it didn't blow me away like TWO's and Embeya's.

2016-01-28,4.0,"I'm writing Blackbird a review based on my experience during restaurant week. I came here for lunch with a friend. The first thing I noticed was how sharp and clean this restaurant looked. I thought the aesthetics of Blackbird is unlike any other restaurant I've seen- lots of light, white countertops, and linens with a pop of color here and there. The tables are a little tight- I could hear conversations from the people sitting next to me. Also, they do have hooks they bring to your seat so I could keep my bag with me, hung from the table side (I thought this was definitely a nice touch!).  Upon seating, we were brought warm bread and a knob of sweet whipped butter. I started off with the gnocchi and rabbit sausage. The gnocchi was okay, but I thought the rabbit sausage was very tasty (rabbit is traditionally a very lean meat, and by turning it into a sausage, lots of flavor (read: fat!) is being incorporated into the meat). For my main course, I ordered the monkfish. It was very tender and cooked well. The sauce on the side paired nicely! For dessert, I ordered the brownie with chocolate coffee ice cream. While I enjoyed the ice cream, I thought the brownie was average (almost wish it was served warm!). I was expecting more for dessert, but it was just okay.  Overall, I thought Blackbird did a good job. Great ambiance, pretty good food, pretty good service!",0.9944,0.793,0.207,0.0,0.5292460317460317

2016-01-28,4.0,We came here today for restaurant week. It was a great way to get three courses for one low price. To begin they brought out fresh baked bread with honey butter that was super tasty. For an appetizer I started with the Rabbit Sausage with Gnocchi which was very tasty. For an Entree i choose the Hanger steak which was so tender that it could have almost been cut with my fork alone. And to finish I had a brownie sundae with chocolate coffee ice cream. Everything that I had was delicious and the presentation of each plate was beautiful. So beautiful I almost didn't want to eat it lol. The portions where rather modest but by the end of the three courses I was satisfied. I couldn't imagine eating just the entree and being full though so I would never go here when I am completely starving. I would definitely recommend dining here.,0.9526,0.778,0.17,0.053,0.6833333333333335
2016-01-27,5.0,"I mean, obviously. Came for Restaurant Week, and the monkfish alone warranted five stars (although the amuse-bouche that is being served this week was a close second).  Presentation matches quality in almost every way here, so it's hard to go wrong.  I also tried the roasted broccoli (served cold, I was surprised that I liked the flat taste of this dish after the stellar amuse-bouche) and the coupe, which I was glad my server dumbed down for me because I didn't want to seem too awkward when I asked in a quiet restaurant what the heck that was. Service was swift; my only negative is that sitting at tables this close together at 11:30 AM for lunch on a Monday means that you will inevitably listen to the diners sitting right next to you (I'm guessing this is not a problem when the place is packed).  It's also fun to watch people try to get up from a table with all of their gear after moving the tables out of the way, but ultimately this means that Blackbird can really pack 'em in.  Very enjoyable!",0.6966,0.857,0.081,0.061,0.5844392684610076

Anyways, moving on. It's a Michelin Restaurant, I'm supposed to be classy, but my foodie-ness got the best of me. For a table of 4, we ordered some apps, and 4 entrees, but actually asked to eat it family style. I mean, I really really needed to know how good everyone's meal might've been... and fortunately, best idea ever.  Highlights of my meal were the free kale chips bites (not just cause they were free), and the sturgeon. WOW. Overall, the food was great.

For what it's worth, Blackbird is MUCH quieter for dessert hours than it is during dinner, which is a huge blessing for the noise sensitive like me. It's also much less crowded, which is considerable because the tables are very close together. What we had: candied beet: chocolate, fennel, orange blossom water This dish was a different take on what I'm used to from beets, which I hate. It was quite good, an eclectic combination of flavors that in some ways complements and some ways overwhelms, and left me quite satisfied. It was balanced, beautiful, and intriguing, and definitely worth a taste. and the special, a mango sorbet Mango sorbet, pomegranate seeds, lemon leaves I believe, and coconut something on the bottom. It was off menu and quite good, refreshing though not as balanced as the upper dish, not that I have too much complaint about this one. Mignardise included some type of pop-rock soda candy and rich chocolate truffles. They were both quite nice. I loved the food we were served. I also rather enjoyed the quietness and decor of the restaurant, its subdued tones matching its calm ambiance.

Really no place to put your arms without worry something might fall to the floor. Plus its hard getting into the inner seat unless the table is moved to a side and pulled out. Not sure why places keep doing this, over stuffing their space for increased number of diners at the expense of a little more room for those eating.

These were old and nasty.  One wasn't open and the ones we tried were fishy and smelled bad.  I didn't say anything to the staff but they had to notice the 10 mussels that remained uneaten in the bowl when it was returned.  You don't really expect to come across something like this at an establishment with a Michelin star but in retrospect I should have just pointed it out to the server.  Besides that, the food and drink pairings were fun and interesting.  If it weren't for the ""rotten"" mussels I would happily give this place 5-stars but thats a pretty big f*ck up for a place that is known for their attention to detail.",0.8904,0.822,0.107,0.07,0.5380952380952381

As part of Chef Paul Kahan's empire, this was the one place I picked out of all the options and somehow I can't help but wonder if The Publican or Avec had been better?  On a brighter note, I couldn't dismiss how pristine and sharp looking the restaurant is. The clean lines, white linens, and glass window beaming in sunlight into the dining room is simple elegance at its best. Seated at a window table, my husband and I enjoyed our view of passers by minding about their businesses out in broad daylight. It was a good place to have lunch but I wasn't impressed with the food. I started with the BARLEY PORRIDGE with roasted mushrooms, hops vinegar, and chickweed which was pretty much like a risotto without using Arborio rice. I enjoyed the earthy flavors especially from the mushrooms but the texture from the porridge was a little overkill for me. RED CURRY SQUASH and WALNUT soup was my better half's choice and he picked well. This was both our favorite from this meal.  For my main entree, I chose the HANGER STEAK - tender, delicious, but forgettable. His was the GRILLED MONKFISH and that was bland and chewy. No, thanks! We got the FLAN BREAD PUDDING with pumpkin spice, sesame, and pomegranate and the FALL COUPE with toasted sesame ice cream, dark chocolate, and sea salt for dessert.

2015-11-28,1.0,"Let me start by saying, my wife and I travel to eat at high end restaurants at last 30 times a year. It's a lot of fun and most of the times we have a great time. We have eaten at 32 of the current top 50 restaurants, 92 Michelin star restaurants. In all of that, we have not had a worse experience then we did at Blackbirds.  We arrived at dinner and the ambiance and feel of Blackbirds was wonderful. Much less stuffy then at a lot of other restaurants. We sat at our table and was promptly asked about allergies and dislikes. Now I am extremely allergic to peaches, we explained this to the waiter and he went to the kitchen and returned telling us there was nothing on the menu that included peaches. The tasting menu started off nice, the carrot was cooked and tasted wonderful. The veal breast was tender. The apple/marrow combination was good, but didn't have the depth I would expect. The Wagyu beef was way too tough, and I have had better beef from much lower restaurants. The cheese dish is where it really started to go down. They brought out a large plate of cheeses that looked like a lot for us to eat. He explained everything that was on the plate, then we were asked to make a selection of one.  One of the great things about a tasting menu is that when you place your order, you are done making decisions and put your trust in the chef to make the right decision for you. We have seen occasional upcharges to meals, but never given a plate to choose from options like we were in this instance. We all ordered our cheeses and were left wondering what the other cheeses tasted like. It would have been much better to have been given a small slice of 3-4 cheeses.  We were not even given an option to pay extra to try other cheeses. So instead, I was stuck with a cheese I picked and didn't like.  Shortly later they brought us a plate with a few candies. The waiter didn't present the plate but instead just set it down on the middle of the table and mumbled what it was, like it was an after thought.  These were not on the menu and lucky for me, my friend over heard the description that the one candy was peach. Only one of the 4 people at our table heard the peach comment. If we had missed this, I would have spent the night in misery and agony. I called them back over and they confirmed that it was peaches and we were told ""it was my fault, I didn't tell anyone"" by our waiter. A restaurant of this level should not make this type of mistake. In addition, they did not show any care other then taking the item away. This was a serious mistake and their reaction to the situation made it worse. I left without an apology or any acknowledgement of the serious mistake. On Monday, I called the restaurant and asked to talk to a manager about the situation and was told someone would call back. Now, almost a week later and no return call. I can understand mistakes happen, but not showing a care in the world that this happened.. made it worse.  With so many great options for restaurants in Chicago, I would suggest that you look to the other places that care about their customers.",0.9535,0.8,0.11,0.09,0.43265483971366336

Monkfish was nicely prepared, rich texture and flavor, not dried out at all, pleasant char flavor. The green apple and sauce were similarly sour, but in a good way. The flan bread pudding dessert looked like Christmas, but it was lackluster and a bit unimaginative compared to the brown butter rum cake I tried last time.

2015-11-09,3.0,"Ate at Blackbird about a month back and am only now getting around to writing my revue! So, my overall opinion was it was just ok. We had the endive salad (amazing) and beef tartare for appetizers. The beef tartrate was good, but the mushroom puree served with it was overly salted. I don't know why restaurants assume that make food taste good and ""seasoned"" they need to overdo the salt. Happens all too often. For entrees, I had the striploin, which was cooked to perfection. However, there was an egg yolk custard served with it, that, again, was ridiculously salty that I actually could not eat it. I don't understand the appeal. We had the corn panna cotta for dessert and it was not good. It was lacking sweetness and overly spiced with paprika. This dish was extremely odd and should be taken off the menu. Overall, a mediocre experience.",0.9372,0.833,0.127,0.039,0.48571428571428565

We even gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried their coffee and tea service with the cheesecake dessert.

The kitchen also brought out a complimentary small bite.  I don't remember what it is but it tasted amazing.  For my main I had the grilled striploin. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I thought the portion of beef was a little small, but it was delicious and well-seasoned.  The potato was more like a puree and was very tasty. Blackbird seemed to get a lot of recognition for its desserts.  I had the panna cotta.  It was a bit different from a typical panna cotta - had corn and served with sunflower seeds, grapes, basil and something else.

2015-11-04,3.0,"I visited this spot after I did lots of research to make sure I would find the best restaurant I could on my trip to Chicago. It was my wife's birthday so I wanted it to be extra special. We got the $130 pp tasting menu since we wanted to have the chance to try out what a Michelin star restaurant had to offer. I think that my expectations were a little higher, so with that in mind here it is: I was not impressed. I think the food lacked some cohesion and progression. We got some of the courses that were a little too strong flavored to be followed by a mild type of dish. The temperature was a big issue for me; nothing came out ""hot""; it was barely lukewarm food over cold plates. Most of the items were overly seasoned or under. Out of the 10 dishes we had; we only enjoyed 3 of them. I'm a pretty open minded guy regarding food and will usually eat anything with minimal complaints but after hearing a the good things about his place it made me really disappointed with my choice. I think we got there on a bad week for their menu. The service staff was okay because they kept refreshing our drinks and our silverware between courses but needed a little more training; most of the times they were a little lost while they were spieling the menu by forgetting some of the names or taking too long to remember the dish and being hesitant; also they were a little too casual for my liking.

Even worse was the hanger steak the size of my thumb which was grossly overcooked and so tough it was barely edible! The sauce was vinegary and the potato next to it was a sad, pinky-finger sized croquette that was forgotten as soon as it was consumed.

The desserts were definitely better than the entrees.  Not only were they beautiful, they had a combination of multiple flavors and textures that danced on my tongue.  I have never had a rhubarb popsicle, hibiscus lassi, black lime dust, etc. -- not to mention all in one dish!

I am shocked they have such favorable reviews. I made a reservation (for four people) and ended up changing it (via Opentable) a couple times that day. Know it was a pain in the butt, but I had out of town guests in and since the times were available, it should not have been as big of a problem as it became. Around 5:30pm, I changed the reservation time to 9:00pm. We arrived at 8:55pm and were told our reservation was cancelled and there was no availability. Luckily I had the confirmation email and since I was able to pull this up, I was told they would sit us in about 20 minutes. There was no place to wait in the restaurant, so we went next door to grab a drink. The hostess said we would receive a call in 20 minutes. Around 9:25pm we still hadn't heard anything, so my friend pulled up Opentable and saw there was a 9:30pm reservation. He quickly booked it and went back to Blackbird; the hostess told him there wasn't availability at 9:30pm. Advice---change the restaurants availability online then. Around 9:45pm we received a phone call saying our table was ready. We awkwardly stood in front of the hostess stand (no place to wait) until we were sat a little before 10:00pm. Originally we wanted to go with the tasting menu but after the lack of friendliness from the people at the front of the restaurant, we decided to just quickly eat and leave. Around 10:20pm our server appeared and we ordered everything. For an appetizer we ordered the scallops and an endive salad. The appetizers came out quickly. The endive salad was really good but the scallops were some awful salty gummy ceviche. The entrees did not come until over an hour later. No explanation about the wait time or anything and we just sat there and hoped the meal would be good. I had the pork belly which was recommended. It was basically a pork belly salt stick. The other guests ordered the salmon, some other fish dish, and the chicken. I tried the salmon which was a poached flavorless salmon. The other guests also didn't like their entrees. Everyone agreed the endive salad was the highlight. Overall: My stomach hurt after dinner because of all the salt, we spent over $200 at dinner (for 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 4 entrees and no drinks whatsoever), the staff wasn't friendly, the food wasn't good, we spent 2 unwarranted hours at dinner, and somehow Blackbird was crowded.

They serve everyone a large hunk of crusty bread with herb infused butter when you first sit down.  The bread was amazing! The corn fritter was just okay.  Could have done without.  The best part was the sauce/oils they drizzle on the plate and the small tablespoon size salad.  But, the salmon dish was great.  Slightly overcooked but the snap peas, baby carrots and sauce were incredible!!  Dessert was, by far, my favorite part of the meal.  I wish I could remember how it was described on the menu because it was truly incredible.  It came with zucchini ice cream which, who would have thunk, was amazing! I really liked how accommodating they were for dietary restrictions, allergies, etc.  While I didn't make any such requests, they made sure to ask every member of my party and there was a call-out on the menu to mention any restrictions. I also loved the portion sizes.  When the dishes first come to the table, you don't think it'll be enough food but by the time you finish eating you realize you're content.  Lastly, the service was excellent.  The host/hostess and each server were really great.

It's a nice touch especially since many people dining at Blackbird are there for a special occasion. The wine list was absolutely wonderful and huge...many great choices. There were also some more rare beers on the beer list that my husband enjoyed. We were feeling quite adventurous (and hungry) and we ended up getting two appetizers each as well as an entree and dessert. The portions were small (as to be expected in a fine dining restaurant) but we left full due to the amount we ordered. I think you could definitely get away with one appetizer and an entree, though. Looking back, I almost wish we would have ordered three appetizers each and no entree (although that may be weird...)because the appetizer offerings were definitely the most intriguing and the favorite part of the meal for both of us.  I ordered the Indiana sweet corn gazpacho and scallops for my appetizers. Both were absolutely phenomenal, but the scallops took the cake for me. Have never tried (or had a desire to try) foie gras in my life...but I was feeling adventurous and it really was delicious. My husband ordered the gazpacho as well and the soft shell crab as appetizers. Both were great. For entrees, husband got the pork belly (great) and I had the strip loin (wonderful). I usually order my meat medium but decided to go on their medium rare recommendation...and it was pretty rare. Good, but rare...definitely be prepared for some significant red if you order medium rare. We finished the meal with the Mud Pie dessert...which is pretty much a peanut butter and chocolate lover's dream. Definitely get it. The service definitely stuck out. Our waiter didn't bother us too much but came over and checked on us at just the right times. He made some great recommendations (which we took) and he had a great personality to be a waiter at an upscale restaurant. The host/manager (?) also came over as well multiple times.  The atmosphere is nice...tables are a little close (had to literally move the table to get out and go to the bathroom) but it didn't bother us too much since we were dining at 7pm on a Tuesday night and the place wasn't packed. The bill at the end of the night was pretty pricey...but I guess that's partially our fault since we ""went all out"". Would highly recommend Blackbird, but would continue to try other great Chicago fine dining restaurants before coming right back.",0.9989,0.734,0.249,0.017,0.571990527393753

2015-07-21,4.0,"We came here for our six-month ""anniversary"" (also, we may have been trying to find an excuse to have a fancy dinner out). I am also a fan of other Paul Kahan establishments, such as The Publican and Dove's Luncheonette, so I was especially interested in trying this single Michelin-starred restaurant. We didn't have trouble making a reservation and we were seated immediately after arriving. Score!  We had already studied the menu ahead of time, so we knew we wanted to order the endive salad as a starter. The server came out and never said a word, but he gave us a little tableside show (after patiently waiting for me to take a ""before"" picture first--thanks!) breaking down the endive salad. This salad is unique because it's tucked away into a sort of periphery bird nest made out of crispy potatoes (you've got to see this dish to understand). He cut open the salad and then tapped the knives together in a cute little flourish. The salad was topped with a perfectly poached egg, which went very well with pancetta, basil, and dijon. For my entree, I enjoyed the sturgeon. This was easily the best sturgeon I've ever had! I felt like I was cutting into a perfectly cut and cooked meat. We knew we had to order dessert because a) we love dessert and B) Dana Cree had just won the James Beard Award for pastry chef, so we need we couldn't pass up the opportunity. After going back and forth between a few options, we opted for the gooey butter cake. It was very good, but I think my expectations might have been a little bit too high (or perhaps we ordered the wrong thing). My favorite Dana Cree creation is still her ice cream, which is available in the freezer at Publican Quality Meats! Obviously, the menu changes a lot and since I delayed writing this review for three months, the only thing I had that's still on the menu is the endive salad.  The main reason I reduced Blackbird to four stars is because the tables are way too close together. Unfortunately, this did not provide for a particularly comfortable or romantic dining atmosphere. There was a hook for my purse underneath the table, which I appreciated at first, but it actually could not accommodate the size of my purse (which wasn't *huge*), especially because the women sitting at the two tables flanking us also were using the hooks for their purses. When we initially sat down, the host actually had to pull the entire little table out to allow me room to walk comfortably to my seat (I'm a petite person). We could hear the entire conversation of the couples sitting next to us and we almost felt awkward talking. This was a bit disappointing. I recommend Blackbird for an upscale regular date if it's in your budget or for business people traveling who have the tab covered, not for a special occasion.  I read there's a $25 lunch menu, so I would definitely return in the future to try that after having a great dinner experience.

My tomato gazpacho was such a pretty color, and so smooth, rich, with a good mix of spices. I had their salmon entree which was good as well, a very simple dish that didn't stand out too much, but was still really well done. For dessert, I had the summer coupe, which had really good ice cream and this chocolate/caramel mix at the bottom -- yum! My boyfriend also ordered the suckling goat appetizer after a recommendation from our waiter -- I normally am not a goat fan, but this dish was excellent. The almond milk they add to it adds the perfect touch and adds creaminess and richness to the dish that complements the goat very well.  The service was also spot-on. We were attended throughout the meal, and the waiters knew the dishes inside and out. The only thing that was a little strange was that several folks in casual shorts and t-shirt attire with backpacks kept walking in and back to the kitchen. I figured they were staff coming into work?

2015-07-08,4.0,"Blackbird siiiiinging in the dead of niiiiiiiiight! Taaaaake these broken wings, and leaarrrrrrrrn to flllllyyyy....  er.. Oops. Sorry.   I have been publishing an art magazine called Faesthetic since 2001. Chicago artist Matthew Hoffman is this year's cover artist. You can find more about him here:  heyitsmatthew.com  He's really great. Like... really really great.  Blackbird is also really great and it has been on my ""to do"" list since relocating to Chicago. I was very excited when Matthew recently invited me to a private art inspired dinner at Blackbird. His art, I should add.  BB has been doing this on again, off again artist inspired series for a while, and it doesn't seem to be heavily advertised. Note to Blackbird: grow this series and promote the hell out of it. It's a fantastic concept.  The idea is the kitchen collaborates with a notable artist on a concept driven meal, and the consumer gets both delicious inspired food along with some sort of artist hands on involvement. In the case of Matthew's event, the themed food focused on Strawberries and Salmon, and the takeaway was a limited edition mini sculpture.  The evening started with strawberry cocktails, thankfully not including salmon. There wasn't assigned seating, and since I was flying solo, I ended up being surrounded by my friend's wives. No complaints here as they were all fantastic dinner dates.  As the meal began, the chefs came out to explain their idea for the dinner. They talked about Matthew's artwork, which typically focuses on some sort of word play with a short sentence or phrase. They hoped that the 4 courses would read in the same way, with all of the ingredients making up the letters and words in their simple statement. They wanted you to leave feeling like like the concept was clear, and boy oh boy was it ever.  Would I order each individual course in the future? Probably not. But together, everything worked as a perfect celebration of Strawberries and Salmon. Other than the dessert, which just focused on Strawberries, each dish had a great balance of the two featured ingredients.  To start, we were served a visually beautiful salad with a Strawberry and Beet cured King Salmon. It was perfectly delicate and rich, with a wonderful bit of sliced green Strawberries, something I certainly would like to see more of, in general. Everything was sprinkled with Poppy seeds and herbed Buttermilk. I would have loved a second serving.  Next up was a strawberry gazpacho which, while yes cold strawberry soup sounds more like a dessert than an appetizer, it had a nice balance of the sweet to salty. The addition of smoked Salmon roe seemed to delight to everyone at the table, and I particularly enjoyed the charred Strawberry and curds floating around the bottom of the bowl. These guys know how to play with food.  As we ate, our glasses were constantly filed with either a rose, or a chardonnay. I went with the white, which was a crisp delicious palate cleanser.  For the entree we were served a nice portion each of roasted king Salmon and braised Pork. The Salmon was... good! The braised pork, even better, while being a bit off the ingredient theme of the evening. Many remarked on how well it was prepared, crisp on the outside and melt in your mouth on the inside. Of course, there were more Strawberries, this time roasted, as well as some charred Fennel puree.  It should be noted, each dish had a small delicate piece of Matthew Hoffman's art served along side the food. One piece was a small phrase made out of wood, another a small phrase made out of laser etched plastic. It was hard to figure out what it all meant, until dessert arrived.  A huge portion of strawberry summer pudding with Parmesan Cheesecake arrived. Strawberry jam, olive oil and basil finished the dish. It was a bit overwhelming, but everyone of us was up to the challenge. I'll admit, at this point I was on strawberry overload. Every tastebud in my mouth was just saturated with a acidic high note of the berry.  We were also provided a small wooden tray, with two bite size candy like pastries on top. A chocolate number, and another lighter in flavor number that... I think had some sort of popcorn powder on it? I have no idea what it was, but it was delicious, and thankfully lacking in Strawberry.   As people started to take note of the wooden tray, a few people flipped it over to reveal a mirror like surface. Several clever dining guests realized all of the small pieces of art from the other plates clicked together on the tray, creating a sculpture stressing the importance of slowing down and taking note of whats happening around you. A refreshing statement as we all live in a world that's moving way too fast.  Throughout the dinner, Matthew would walk around the room, talking to the 20 or so guests and you could tell he was really enjoying himself. We all were. It was a lovely event, and I hope to make the next one.",0.9982,0.817,0.156,0.028,0.5477888286116134

Inspired by Eater's Bill Addison ( eater.com/2015/5/21/8629… ), I made it my life's mission to visit all the restaurants of Paul Kahan's One Off Hospitality empire. Challenge accepted...challenge completed! The last review on the list is Blackbird, Kahan's signature Michelin-starred restaurant and home to a hefty bill at the end of the night. It's not my favorite of the Kahan joints (that honor goes to either Big Star or The Publican), but as far as top of the line restaurants go, Blackbird does it pretty dang well. It didn't hurt that we brought our cousins' little baby to her first Michelin restaurant, which will surely go down as a milestone in her young life (she was just old enough to chill out at dinner and sample a little food, not old enough to be a cause a ruckus the size of a San Andreas earthquake). For their part, the staff was very accommodating to said baby, and yes, we did ask ahead whether it was appropriate. Service, as expected, was top of the line. The restaurant itself is also clean and crisp, white without the white linen and a nice, pristine contrast to rowdy, communal Avec next door. We stuck with cocktails (great) and beer, but went HAM on appetizers and entrees to create a communal table tasting menu. The appetizers were thoroughly fantastic, that I honestly can't decide what I liked the best of La Mer: the soft shell crab, the scallop, or the prawns. Table baby definitely loved the scallop, and by that, I mean she loved the melt-in-your-mouth buttery foie gras torchon that accompanied it. I guess my vote would be for the prawns, delightfully light yet tasty and beautifully presented. I had decided ahead of time to go with Blackbird's signature sturgeon for the entree, and I was not disappointed in the least. It's a meaty cut, salted well, and presented aside a tasty asaparagus-ham combo. The wife's artichoke cappelletti was a light complement and perfect for splitting alongside the sturgeon. Our cousin's pork belly was another winner, and I just regret I had but one visit and couldn't try the duck. We ended the evening with a luscious chocolate cake and an interesting bubble gum ice cream. The latter may be one of my least favorite flavors alive, but the dish acquitted itself well, with help from copious strawberries and cream. Gun to my head, the Kahan list: (1) Big Star (2) The Publican (3) Avec (4) Blackbird (5) Publican Quality Meats (6) Nico Osteria (7) The Violet Hour (8) Dove's Luncheonette.

I came into the restaurant knowing that it was one of the higher end ones in the city for sure, but I was oblivious to the fact that it had a Michelin star and I had no idea what a Beard award was (go ahead, you can laugh at me). If you are looking for a restaurant on par with Brindille, Avec, The Publican, etc., simply go here and read the reviews no further. If you're simply curious about the dishes, I've described my experience a little below. Truly exquisite tastes in all of the menu items. I'm a food lover but not an expert, so some of the flavors, such as those in the tartare, were a little overwhelming for me. As for the Suckling Goat- The almond milk appetizer was juicy, tangy, salty, and a hint of creamy from the almond milk cream concoction they poured around the center. Seared Walleye- The fish, the fish! Such sophisticated flavors. The best fish I have ever tasted, and I being from New England, I have always been extremely skeptical of Chicago seafood. I can't say that the entire dish, every bite was the best, but there were certain parts of the fish that were cooked better and ultimately make me say it was the best fish I've had. I can't describe the flavor, but it was just sophisticated and delicious and my mouth was watering, and does a little thinking about it. The Mud Pie was a good chocolate dessert, but I probably should have gone for something else. My friend got the banana pudding like dessert which reminded me of Magnolia Banana Pudding but honestly I think it tasted even better which is saying something because Magnolia's Pudding is my favorite dessert of all time.

I enjoyed dessert quite a bit, but I think I was alone on that even. All around it was a good meal, fine. Just not up to snuff given its reputation.

The 2 at blackbird were not good and I highly recommend to eat elsewhere. The pierogi: I was expecting a light and fluffy dumpling filled with prominent filling, what we got was 3 tiny tiny pierogi that were so-deep-fried that they were burnt, such a thick coating of breading that was deep fried, so much dough, and a tiny teeny bit of filling that you couldn't even taste the flavor of. Just not good.  The mud pie: ugh this was not good either. The flavors just didn't blend. I think each component SOUNDS good but it's not good together. Salty/crunchy piece, chewy dark very very rich chocolate, burnt marshmallow (why do people think burnt taste is good?), some sort of ice cream that has no flavor, and whipped cream on top.

I have been a few times and would recommend to anyone going for the first time to try the chef's tasting menu. It changes periodically but I have never been disappointed. If you aren't looking to splurge on a tasting menu then I highly recommend the Grilled Short Rib burger (the best thing on their menu) or the Croque Madame. For starters the beef tartar is decent but the salad of edives is where it's at. In fact..get the salad of endives regardless of anything else you get. For dinner I have tried their duck breast and pork collar with both being exceptional. The desserts aren't memorable to me but I also don't remember hating them either.

I've been to a few Michelin star restaurants and this one just didn't stack up in my opinion. Chicago has an awesome restaurant scene and not sure how a place like this get's recognized over other spots that I have been to in the city.  Also I promise that I am not looking for huge plates of food but the portion sizes here are kinda ridiculous with how small they are. My wife ordered the pasta and 75% of the plate was empty.

We both ordered the short rib burger, cooked medium rare. It was certainly one of the better burgers I've had for lunch in the Loop. Notable ingredients that augmented a juicy beef patty included the potato bread (right texture) and the ""bread and butter onions"" and the sauce which was based on mustard.

It is delicious, don't get me wrong, but for what I paid I would expect a little better. I am vegetarian, but will still try to provide an unbiased review based on what my 2 meat-eating friends thought. To start, we ordered a full course meal (not the pre fixe). This included a bottle of wine, 3 appetizers, main course and 2 desserts. I'll start with the bad. I think what made the taste not as great for me was an overkill of salt- that can ruin a great meal quickly. Secondly, one of the appetizers was a bit over cooked and tasted fairly average. For me, the best part of the meal was dessert- it was beautifully presented and a great size for sharing.  Be warned that the layout and environment here screams ""date""- not a bad thing if you're looking to impress someone.

I think our cocktails were actually probably a highlight of the menu, which is good, but would have liked our dinner to be on the same level.

We asked for the drinks menu and then waiter forgot about us... but it was just weird because it didn't seem that busy or chaotic. Could have just been that night, hard to say after just one visit. All of the staff were very friendly.  Overall, not wild about the ambiance and setup. We sat along the wall and we were so close to the tables on both sides we had conversations with both couples at some stage because you can't help but be in their space. The server actually had to pull the table out just so you could sit down, to give you an idea on how tight it was.

We had only 4 items on the bill. How could you get confused as to what we ordered? Likely they were still mad at our lack of alcohol-ordering and were trying to pad the tab.  We would expect this of a lower-class restaurant, not a Paul Kahan establishment.  Additionally, our hostess had been carefully told by my husband that he had a Valentine's day card tucked into his coat, and when you check it, please do not lose the card. When his coat was returned (not my coat, they forgot about my coat), the card was missing. Evidently it was on the floor of the coat room. Ouch again.  That said, the snails with boudin blanc were delicious, the duck breast entrée was the stuff of dreams and the Faroe Islands salmon was perfectly cooked. The problem is you can get food that's equally good in a place with better service. I think we'll be heading other places in this food-crazy city!",0.9387,0.785,0.125,0.09,0.6982142857142858

I can honestly say it was the best entree I have ever had in my life. The fermented squash was out of this world and duck was so tender and well-flavored. The portion on the duck was pretty good too. My SO got the hanger steak, and while it was delicious, it only provided him with about six bites of food. I'm knocking off one star though because the service was ABYSMALLY SLOW. We were trying to have a quick lunch so my SO could get back to work at a reasonable hour, but we ended up spending two hours at lunch because it took us forever to get each course (about 15 minutes in between finishing one course and receiving the next... that is WAY too long). We also didn't get enough water refills for my liking. I was very obviously drinking out of my SO's for about 20 minutes because my glass was empty for that long. It could have been because they were understaffed for restaurant week, but if they're going to participate in restaurant week, they should know how busy they are going to be and plan accordingly.",0.8847,0.924,0.066,0.01,0.55

Not sure if because I had high expectations for Blackbird. I was quite disappointed. To start with, our waiter was really handsome (like the model from perfume commercial). However, his service quality has a long way to catch up with his look. We learned about his name from our bill. He didn't greet us what so ever, and just gave us the drink menu right away. The whole interaction we ever had with him was pretty much placing our orders. We had other waiters brought our dishes and served us food. I guess our waiter's main goal was just making sure this place looked high-end enough so people will feel special. Now let's talk about the food. I'm a big lover for beef tartar. When I ordered the appetizer, I was amazed about how little the portion was. I'm a petite girl. When I say ""little"", you can imagine the benchmark. :p Then it tasted very bad - too much seasoning overpowered the fresh taste of beef. I think it probably because there was so little beef to start with.  My BF did like the duck breast. I thought it was mediocre. I did like venison - the only dish lived up the reputation Black bird had in my opinion. The dessert we got was mediocre as well. When I say mediocre, that means definitely no mind blowing taste or creative design. Just regular chocolate cookie with ice cream.  One last complaint: when we were ready to leave, nobody was by the reception desk to get us coat. We stood there at least 5 mins, then finally someone grabbed our coats. One thing pushed me to posted this review right away was our waiter saw us waiting there the whole time and he didn't do anything. He just kept walking around and took orders. :( Really?!?!?! A good way to check the real impression from someone about the restaurant is if they will ever want to come back again. For us, the answer is definitely NO.

We couldn't decide on which dessert to share, because although the portions weren't massive, they were filling.  We asked our waitress to choose and she brought out two because she couldn't decide either and told us that one was on the house.  Honestly, the dessert is one of the only reasons I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5.  I wish I could remember what she said the two desserts were, but I found that they had too many flavors and the flavors just didn't go well together.   Service was excellent here, although there was a time or two when our waitress wasn't readily available and it took us a while to make eye contact with her.  I was also a little disappointed that a table was not immediately available for us, despite having a reservation.  However, waiting a little while allowed me the opportunity to chat with the bartender, who was extremely knowledgeable and provided me with a delicious rum that I had not tried before.  I wish the restaurant had more bar space so that I could come and get drinks from the bartender without feeling like I'm sitting on top of the diners.  My only other slight complaint is that the restaurant is a little tightly packed.  I would have enjoyed a little more elbow room, especially when spending a nice chunk of change for a meal.   Overall, a great showing, and someplace I'd recommend if you're trying to impress your date, spouse, client or in-laws.",0.999,0.707,0.266,0.027,0.6755234718000674

Our overall experience was great as always, but the entrees tonight were distractingly salty. I had the smoked-brined chicken breast with carrots and dill. Beautifully plated. The flavor, however, had more to do with salt than it did with chicken, carrots - or definitely smoke. I do understand that brining will bring a saltier final product to the table and the importance of seasoning food, but it was borderline absurd. This post probably has less to do with Blackbird and more to do with my disappointment in the trend of overly salty dining experiences; perhaps it's what diners are demanding? My tastes had perceived Blackbird to be a respite in the aggressively seasoned dining world.

The force was strong with her so we passed on ""smaller"" recommendations, instead adding the croque monsieur, which was in fact far too much.  But as much as we ate, we tasted very little. The charred sourdough is deliciously light and crumbs flew after every satisfying crunch. Slather a healthy dose of perfectly-salted room-temp butter on each bite. It's downhill from there. Tartare is chopped finer than Mila Kunis pre-Kutcher baby, but the steak drowns in heavy sesame flavor and crunch just like Kunis drowned in Kutcher's....... White grapes add sweetness to the starchy sweetbreads but overall too sweet and badly in need of acid/salt. The Croque monsieur's very large and sticky while the duck's bland.. salt on both please.

2014-12-27,4.0,"A little of this and a little of that.  There are a lot of components to Chef Kahan's food at Blackbird.  Each plate presents a lyrical interplay of these components - visual, aromatic, textural and of course, flavorful. After perusing the menu, our table of four had some difficulty deciding what to order.  Conveniently, there is a tasting menu option and after token discussion, we agreed on the gluttonous option.  One dish that we wanted to try, the quail, was not on the tasting menu and they agreed to swap out the chicken for the quail. This was a 9 course tasting menu (including the amuse).  Each course had a number of components - even the amuse had 4 distinct items on the little spoon.  The amuse was delicious - crispy duck (more like duck bits), with sunflower, dried cherry and kohlrabi.  That's one bite with a lot goin' on! Highlights included the ivory char crudo with smoked char roe, turnip, green grape, pearl onion, and pumpernickel (6 components) and the celery root soup with grilled lobster, preserved lemon, celery and marigold (5 components).  The star of the night was the grilled strip loin and braised veal cheeks with smoked potato gnocchi, charred cabbage, caraway seed, sour cream, black garlic and dill fronds (8 components!). The aforementioned quail, roasted, with bone marrow stuffing, dates, rutabaga, cider-onion jam and almonds, alas, was a bit of a disappointment.  On this dish, the interplay of components did not work and the quail was overcooked. There was a cheese course (5 components), a palate cleanser of preserved buddha's hand (4 components) and then came dessert which was a delicious riff on breakfast cereal.  ""Milk and cookies with buckwheat cookie butter, frozen cranberry, milk jam, parsnip, and brioche.""  This 7 component dish was truly a case of more is better - each component, delicious on it own, was even better when combined with other elements so that no two bites offered the same experience. Some tasting menus leave you uncomfortably full and others leave you strangely unsatisfied (who hasn't secretly gone home after one of those and scrounged for something else to eat?)  This one offered just about the perfect amount of food - very much appreciated for the drive home!

At the same point, you never feel overcrowded. Nicely done, Blackbird.  And oh, the food! I hope my Polish relatives won't read this/hate me for life, but the pierogis were the best I've ever had. Not only were the pierogis themselves amazing (I think the small farm cheese did the trick) but the Brussels sprouts and mushrooms they were served with rounded out the flavor palate. The kielbasa broth brought it all together. I fell asleep dreaming of the pierogis. For the entree, I had the sirloin. I literally cut it with a fork. My only regret in ordering the dish was that I didn't order 3. I don't typically have a big appetite, but I'm convinced I could have devoured it all!

It's hard to say which was best as the flavors were so different (rich vs. light and fruity) but both were as good as they looked (gorgeous presentation)!

Let's be honest, it was the only way we could afford the place. Ambiance is great. It's nicer but the kind where men can get away with wearing jeans and a button down. Our waiter Sean was very attentive and helped us pick out drinks. I got the parsley soup, he got the beef tartar. I LOVED the soup. So unique. Love the presentation. I don't even like brussel sprouts and I ate those. I didn't try the beef tartar because I had an incident with raw beef a few weeks ago that is making me stay away, but my husband quickly ate it all. Entree course: I got the salmon, he got the duck confit. Again, we both ate it so quickly and were very happy. At first sight the portions look very small, but once you finish after the app you realize it was the perfect amount of food for lunch. Dessert: we got one of each: the grape sorbet with peanut butter and honey milk, and the cinnamon ice cream/whip cream/rice pudding thing. The first so unique, the second so comforting. And to top it all off they brought out a bday dessert for him, which was so unexpected and so, so nice. Oh, also street parking is totally doable in that area.

To start, we got the scallops and beef tartare.  Both were great, and you could really taste the very complex and sophisticated flavor profiles.  There didn't seem to be enough to go around.  The entrees were just the opposite.  Overall they both felt flat and one-dimensional.  As beautiful as the plating was, it felt like something very simple.   And that is just it.  Blackbird does the simple dishes, with very flavors that are very well done, but muted and subtle. I think we may just not have a discerning enough palate for this place.  We talked it over afterwards and realized we much preferred the full-body flavor of their little sibling, Avec.  It's like comparing a very crisp chardonnay to a napa sauvignon blanc, that's laced with cocaine.  Maybe we just need our cocaine.",0.9772,0.836,0.155,0.009,0.4854224270353302

The lunch prices are great - especially since Blackbird has a Michelin star. We got the lunch prix fixe menu for $25, which seemed like a steal. I got the potato soup, hangar steak, and grape sorbet for dessert. The potato soup was different and weird, but in a cool and innovative way. It was a cold day so the soup really hit the spot. I liked the creativity behind the soup because there were a bunch of different kind of potatoes in it (sweet potato, purple yam, etc). The hangar steak was ... gross. It was overcooked mostly and impossible to chew. I ate everything else around it because I was starving, but I almost wish I had asked them to redo it. The grape sorbet was a total surprise dessert. I thought I would be getting standard grape sorbet, instead the dish was like a deconstructed, creative peanut butter jelly sandwich. I'm not a fan of PBJs, but this was so innovative that I actually enjoyed it.  I don't know, maybe Blackbird IS truly excellent and I just have peon tastebuds, but it left something to be desired for me.

The LE was very, very strong and the Nomad not so much. Both were good though. Appetizer - the sea scallops are good, but not out of this world. Others - the house bread is very fresh. We also had some salmon from the chef for tasting, which was extremely delicate and tasty. Entrees - the lamb loin and striploin were terrific. I especially enjoyed the peanuts/puree with the strip. Dessert - bourbon gooey butter cake and angel food cake. Both were great, and we especially enjoyed the use of large sugar crystals on the angel food cake.

Big fan of the simplistic and modern layout of the restaurant. We were immediately greeted at the entrance and brought over to our table and I appreciated that they had a ""hook"" that could be placed on the table to allow women to hang their bag off the side of the table. Shrug just seemed like a nice touch.  After perusing the menu we were told that the executive chef had a tasting menu which showcased all of the ""favorites"" and although it was pricey... I felt it would be the right way to proceed with the night. We ordered a bottle of wine which was delicious.. so much to the point that we ordered two so a great start there. I wont go into a ton of detail but I thought the combinations that were being attempted including the cow tongue were all OK efforts. To be honest.... There is nothing significantly memorable about this particular menu which was disappointing. I did look at a few of the one off dishes and they looked better than a few of the items I was having on the tasting menu. So while OK, I was disappointed by the true flavoring and the cost was extremely high (past $400) for two people which I know includes two bottles of wine but just seems high.

2014-10-07,3.0,"Maybe it was because I had very very high expectations since Blackbird has a Michelin star and James Beard awards, but I wasn't overly impressed by my dining experience. The restaurant was on the smaller side and had an upscale and intimate feel. The plates followed suit and were very pricy for how small the portions were, especially the entrees which weren't much bigger than the apps for double the price. My friends and I joked that Blackbird is probably not the best place to bring a date since our SOs would be very unhappy with the amount of food for the exorbitant price tag. My friends and I wanted to try a bunch of dishes and shared the endives salad, seared sea scallops, beef tartare appetizers and the wood-grilled sturgeon, and aged duck breast entrees. Everything was very well-prepared and tasty and my favorite was the scallops because of the sweet corn and the surprise of the pickled blueberries. However, again, my biggest gripe was just how dang small the plates were! Granted we did share the dishes, but each entree came with about 4 bites of meat. I mean I wasn't expecting a huge hunk of protein, but call me crazy for hoping for a little more for a $40 plate.  Overall, I think Blackbird does serve delicious, well-prepared food, but for the price, I was expecting dishes that either blew me away or portions that were a bit larger.

Like other fancy places in the West Loop, food is king and the decor can be a little sparse. However this simplicity was immediately overtaken by the very attentive service. The place is tiny so I'm impressed that the waiters are even able to maneuver around all the tables without knocking over wine glasses. Nimbleness of the waiters aside, let's get to the food. Endive Salad: Came in an ADORABLE little setup with an edible bird's nest-like fence surrounding the lettuce and poached egg. The chefs clearly painstakingly placed every single piece in a strategic manner.. and I was dying to take a picture! Almost as if he could hear my thoughts, the waiter announced the dish name and started to hack away at the nest and poached egg, mixing it all together. It was a shame we couldn't take a picture before, but it sure was beautiful The crispy pancetta was really tasty with the dijon, but the dish was nothing too special. I think the presentation was probably the highlight of the dish. Seared Scallop with Corn and Blueberries: the scallops were great. The corn and blueberries were interesting touches, but I would have traded those for larger pieces of scallops!  Beef Tartare: This beef tartare looks very different from the usual. It's crumbly and crunchy (poppy seeds?) and tastes like mustard. We were not impressed. Sturgeon with Braised Pork Cheeks: Yummy!! I really think the combination of the two proteins were a great match. Usually fish is the flakier protein, but this sturgeon was solid and the braised pork cheeks were fall-apart tender.Not an obvious match- genius! Duck Breast with Peaches and Turnip: I thought the peaches and turnips were just unecessary. The star was the duck and the pesto was a back-up dancer. The duck was moist and had a great crispy skin. It wasn't game-y at all. Again, I would just give up all the peach and turnip stage props for a longer performance from Mister Donald.  All in all, I think the toppings/additions to each dish were unnecessary, but the main proteins were amazingly cooked- I wish we had more!  In an ideal world, the extra's would be traded in for larger pieces of protein. I'm not sure about the origins of the name of the restaurant, but I am assuming they are referring to a baby blackbird's portion sizes. The quality of the service and food would be 4 stars, but what did we pay for if we still wanted to eat dinner?

From the start it off-putting as we were seated crammed in between 2 other tables with guests. (We had reservations, and they knew it was a celebration night.) This place is really small and very tight. I felt like I was closer to the people next to me than my husband. Also, they knew I was pregnant so why would they seat me at a table where I you have to move the entire table for me to get out? We moved to a somewhat better table, but all are tight. As for the food, the best we could say was that it was 'pretty good'. We have had amazing tasting menus at places like Schwa and Boka where for at least 3 of the courses you are just amazed by the flavors of a dish, you know the moment I am talking about. That did not happen once here. It was all just pretty good. Often I find food too salty (Girl & Goat is amazing but can be so salty) but twice I felt like salt was needed. The service experience was ok enough, but underwhelming. Isn't that  lot of what you are paying for? I definitely felt like they were moving things along at a fast clip, ready to turn over the table. I suggest telling them to pace it slowly if you prefer that. Also, I found it funny that when I made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion and I told them it was my birthday. You can't help but expect that maybe they would say happy birthday, or maybe bring an extra small dessert at the end (like Boka does), but no mention was made of it.

This place is quite pricey.  The entrees ranged anywhere from $30-$42.  I quickly went to Yelp to do my research when I learned that the BF's parents chose this place for dinner.  I was getting nowhere with my research because a lot of the  items on the current menu 1) had not been photographed and 2) had not been reviewed.  Logical deduction: this place updates its menu often! A simplistic approach to design but a big wow off-the-charts approach to food.  I can see why you would have to book in advance for this place, AMAZING.   It was a little odd seeing waiters walking around in nicely tailored suits, as though they had just walked out of a board meeting or something (reiterating, first time at a michelin star restaurant).  Unfortunately dressing nicely was not enough to bump my rating up to 5 stars.  4 stars?  It took an hour and 5 minutes for our food to arrive.  I counted.  I was hungry. Worth the wait?  Heck YES!  Why did the portions have to be sooo small?!  I was yearning for more towards the end and I kid you not, I had a DREAM about eating my meal that night!  I was in bliss, savoring EVERY SINGLE MORSEL over and over and over and over. What was ordered... 1) Roasted Monkfish - don't be afraid it's my first time too ;-P I'm talking about ordering monkfish.  It's amazing.  Dense yet mild.  Please order this. 2) BF's mom ordered roasted halibut.  I had a taste, so good. 3) The boys ordered the grilled striploin.  Perfectly cooked. All the flavors melded together so well.  I'm no food expert but what puts this place over the top is me not being able to say that I have had a similar dish elsewhere. The two desert dishes ordered were peach sherbet and cinnamon concha, drool. Please come here...it's the BOMB DOT COM",0.9941,0.784,0.17,0.046,0.5703201970443349

It was beautifully light and balanced, the epitome of a summer soup. I have to say, this was my favorite dish of the night. It certainly made me look forward to the rest of the meal. For my entree, I had the wood-grilled sturgeon. This was also fairly good, as the sturgeon was lightened by the tahini, radishes, and lime. This dish left me feeling very satisfied, but not sickened.  For dessert, I ordered the cinnamon concha with goat's milk sorbet. The sorbet, eaten alone, was very strange and rich to me, but paired with the concha was wonderful. The strawberries also added some tartness to an otherwise too-sweet dish.  My only qualms with Blackbird have to do with the service. Everyone was rather stony-faced and unapproachable, refilling our water and bread and promptly walking away with no eye-contact whatsoever. Likewise, when I asked our server about the details of my gazpacho, he basically rehashed what was listed on the menu. (A little bit insulting because I was holding the menu in my hand.) My partner additionally ordered the apricot sorbet for dessert, and it was brought out while he was in the washroom. The sorbet was left to melt on the table for over five minutes; a third of it was in a puddle by the time he returned, the rest of it probably warm.

My endive salad was a treat: the freshest greens, lardons, very nice poached egg, perfectly dressed. My companion did not fare so well with the sweetbreads, which were undercooked to the point she could not finish them.

Grilled sturgeon was done just right and well-presented. Dessert was a knockout: roasted apricot sorbet with sesame fudge underlayment and honied kefir -- outrageously good flavors and textures!

The Sturgeon was so soft and a bit tangy actually, but the flavors just jumped right onto my tongue when I took a bite! Immediately, the tanginess was evident. I had a chance to try a piece of the Duck Breast as well and the meat was incredibly smooth, cooked perfectly and very easy to chew thru.

2014-05-28,4.0,"Had a great meal at Blackbird. Really helpful service and useful descriptions of dishes. Obviously Paul Kahan's most refined restaurant it has much of the feel I'm used to from Publican and Avec while pushing the envelope with creativity, ingredients, and flavor. I had the soft shelled crab (because I order soft shelled crab pretty much anytime I see it on a menu this time of year) and the fermented black bean agnolotti. The crab was excellent, tempura battered with apparently a little bit of whiskey in the batter (so that's the trick, eh?). It came out delicate and delicious. The black bean agnolotti was rich and creamy and the accompanying morels adding a nice earthiness and the spring peas providing a surprising crunch. For dessert we shared the bittersweet chocolate pudding which was as eye pleasing as it was delicious. A plate of chocolate pudding hidden beneath a sea of texture created by the espresso crunch and hickory nuts this is a chocolate lover's dish that doesn't disappoint.",0.9912,0.729,0.245,0.025,0.5666666666666667

We didn't want to risk and be disappointed with ordering the tasting menu (like it happened in Senza), so we played it safe ordering 4 appetizers, 1 entree and 2 deserts. From all of this the only thing that was outstanding were their deserts. All the rest of the dishes were not really yummy or memorable. The description of the dishes in the menu were a bit misleading. For example instead of quail breast stuffed with bacon sausage that we received in reality the menu said: ""roasted quail and bacon sausage"" which lead you to believe that you will get the whole bird in stead of a 2 bites piece.  The service was quite the same as I described in my first review and the value was even worth then the first time. To bad that it turn out to be this way.

I also tried a little bit of the duck sausage, which I thought had a more interesting taste.  Finally, the dessert was amazing! I really don't like overly sweet things, so I found the desserts to be very tasty without overloading on sugar. I had something with pieces of croissant and ice cream, which I found to be quite special as I hadn't tried many desserts with croissant in it. Also, the ice cream was a perfect complement to the croissant as it balanced out the greasiness quite well and was a really good choice on a warm but not really hot day.  We also went there at 11:30 on a Monday (with reservation), and it was not crowded at all. We picked a table outside and had a perfect lunch on a nice day.

We had the quail with sausage and soft shelled crab and loved both. We were both interested in the lamb but were told that it was dry aged so had a particularly strong lamb flavor. That could be good or bad. I suspect it was delicious but, with so many fantastic options, we decided on other entrees. I had the steak which was phenomenal. Jen had the sturgeon which was so good. There was a very slight fish aftertaste but it was entirely pleasing. We began the meal with cocktails and went with wine pairings recommended by our server and she was spot on. We were pretty content by the time the dessert menu was passed around but made room for coffee and the brie plate.

It was way too salty.  It was well cooked, but poorly seasoned.  The side greens had so much salt I only took one bite.  In either case, besides being a good cut, they didn't do anything to improve or enhance the flavor.  Bleh.  Additionally, the interior was crowded and the service was mediocre.  We got very limited attention.  Finally, I'd describe the decor as being the white elevator.  Its not meant as a complement.

2014-05-16,5.0,"Overall a wonderful dinner experience. First off, regarding the decor, note that I think the interior image shown on Blackbird's website is a very poor choice.  It makes the interior look almost clinical or like it's trying too hard to look futuristic and in the process comes off tacky.  But the reality is that...once the interior is peopled ;-) ....it looks neither.  The minimalist color scheme and lack of artwork on the walls works just fine once you have bodies in the restaurant to mix things up.  At the front they had a very tasteful flower arrangement. The service was impeccable.  Not too little, but not overdone either. I got a really amazing Cabernet by the glass from California. For my appetizer, I got a sausage made of ....er...some type of poultry ....not chicken...cornish hen perhaps?  It was good, but not phenomenal. For my entree I got the agnolotti pasta with spring peas, pea shoots and morel mushrooms in a cream sauce.  That dish was positively sublime! For dessert, the chocolate pudding dish.  It was very good. My friend got an appetizer that was wrapped in like a 'basket' made of potato sticks or something on that idea.  The mere execution of that basket was really something to behold!

Decor is stark, but added touches (like the bright flowers on the table and their equally bright orange menu) liven it up. Blackbird is VERY small. It was not full on the day we went, but given its small size, I can see how reservations can get full quickly.  The food:  Duck Liver Pate: good though unusually rich. I couldn't try more than one bite from the hubby's plate. Croque Monsieur: house cured ham, swiss, caramelized onion, mornay sauce and fries. Good Croque Madame: same as above, but add a fried egg on top. Good Blackbird Classic Boullabaisse: delicate and not very filling, but it was delicious and perfect for the cold weather.  Grilled PQM Short Rib Burger: it comes on a brioche bun with kale and BACON CREAM CHEESE. I would come back for this alone. E X C E L L E N T! I almost teared up at not being able to finish it. This was our last Chicago meal, I was completely stuffed!  Steamed Pumpkin Cake: this was delightful. I really enjoyed this although the custard made the cake all mushy! That irked me.

Definitely a good lunch deal for those in the Loop/West Loop area. Firstly, the wait staff was extremely attentive and accommodating, A+! What we both had: *caramelized cabbage soup with mustard, beer onions and potato cake. *wood-grilled monkfish with salsify, black trumpet mushrooms, buckwheat and grapefruit. *duck sausage with dried parsley root, brussels sprouts, buttermilk and mustard seeds. *pumpkin cake with toasted coconut frozen custard, toffee peanuts and sage. *mint ice cream, chocolate crumbs, fudge sauce and fernet whipped cream. *2005 Yves Breussin, Demi-Sec Vouvray The soup was my favorite! Very flavorful and different from anything I've ever had before! It reminded me a lot of what I think upscale, modern Polish food would taste like and I loved it! As a person who doesn't eat fish very often, I did enjoy the monkfish very much and would probably order it on my next visit. The duck sausage was very flavorful but the casing was a little difficult to cut through and came off the link a little too easily for my taste. The desserts were wonderful! I would say the pumpkin cake was much more unique but I still deeply enjoyed both! The only reason I wouldn't give it a higher star rating is that I think compared to all the other restaurants in that area, it was just average. I enjoyed my meal and had a great experience, but when compared to all the other establishments on that street and within a 5 block radius, I think they need a little more ""something"" to make them stand out.

Both had great flavor and just the right portion size. We had a second course of one empanada (chicken stuffed with cheese). I thought this was a nice surprise from the chef since it wasn't listed on the menu. I had the grilled wagyu flatiron for my entree. I thought I was going to be hungry after I saw the portion but since the entree had such great flavor and cream I was feeling just right after I took my last bite. Of course we couldn't leave without having dessert; we opted for the caramelized croissant (restaurant specialty) and were not disappointed. The flavors combined to an explosion of greatness in my mouth. Highly highly recommend!! Atmosphere: Very lively on Saturday night, we had reservations for 8 and when we left (close to 10:30) the restaurant was still packed! I do appreciate the smaller more intimate restaurants, even though the tables are close to one another I had to listen hard to hear others conversations. We sat at the front of the restaurant and I wish we were able to sit towards the back (away from the door) and closer to the kitchen...maybe next time!

(Well...I've only had tartare a few times in my life) The duck confit was above average. the duck leg was wonderful, but the duck sausage was dry and a bit on the pasty side.

2014-02-06,5.0,"When it comes to $$$ restaurants, I really expect a lot because c'mon, I'm not going to pay an arm and a leg for nothing. But when it comes to a Michelin star rated restaurant, expectations are on a whole other level, and I have to give it to Blackbird for being by far one of the best restaurants I've been to in terms of food, service and price. Pros: 1. Dress code. The restaurant doesn't come across as ""snobby"" in any way, and they don't expect their customers to be dressed to the nines. I wouldn't say come in wearing beachwear or tennies, but they won't look down on you wearing a measly old sweater and boots either. 2. Service was impeccable. I so wish I could remember my waitress's name because she was wonderful! A part of why my experience here was so good was because of her. She was patient, attentive, knowledgeable, and made some rather good recommendations. And it's not even just her, almost everybody on staff waited on each patron's hand and foot. 3. Complimentary appetizer and dessert bites. (Who doesn't like free food?) 4. The bread and butter. Not lying, it tasted like mashed potatoes. It. Was. Awesome. 5. The food. Did I mention the food? Oh. My. God. It was incredible. For me, I started off with the Seared Bay Scallops. Priced at $17, it was worth it because they put more baby scallops in that dish than I could have possibly counted; it felt like it was never ending, as I would find one here and there under a slice of pear, which were sweet and juicy. But trust me, I am definitely not complaining. I didn't order an actual dinner entree, but I did get both the Smoked Arctic Char and Steak Tartare from the Appetizers menu. Both were delectable, but if I had to choose a favorite, I would go with the fish. It had a nice smoky yet fresh and zesty finish (thanks to the lemon), and it was paired quite nicely with cucumbers and mandarinquats. The beef was tasty as well; it was lemony and freshly cut. The slices were a bit on the longer thinner side, so don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach. For my boyfriend, he started off with the Suckling Pig and got the Wagyu Flatiron as his entree. The appetizer was outstanding; I can't remember if it was that crispy, but it was full of flavor and extremely tender. It is a ""heavier"" appetizer, but it's great to share. We have to thank our waitress for recommending the Wagyu Flatiron because everything about that entree was delicious. The meat itself: medium rare, juicy, tasty, and just downright amazing. It's accompaniments? Wow. I hate cabbage, but Blackbird has turned me into a fan of charred cabbage. We ended the night with a Steamed Pumpkin Cake, which was also phenomenal! The cake was delicious and it was moist, thanks to the steamed milk that was poured on top. And the best part was that it was topped with a scoop of coconut ice cream, which made it all the better. Cons: The restaurant is fairly small and seating is quite tight. Everyone literally sits elbows to elbows, and you're bound to hit somebody when walking through the ""walk ways."" Another small thing that was meh to me, but could be a big deal to others, is that they don't seem to have normal teas that aren't worth an arm and a leg. By that, I mean, tea blooms really are not that special except for in Chicago (apparently) so places that offer such ""unique"" teas really up their prices on it. With that said, I made my $7 Jasmine Tea Bloom worth it by refilling the pot three times. Lol. Tips: I suggest making reservations either by phoning in or on OpenTable because this tiny little restaurant fills up quickly. Also, for all you fruity wine lovers: they don't have Moscato, but they have an excellent Riesling by the glass!",0.9992,0.758,0.205,0.036,0.5914093501984128
2014-01-30,4.0,"To be fair, the things that knock off a star for me are probably particular to Restaurant Week, so if I get to go again at a different time and order off the regular menu, I might just pop that fifth star right up there. First off, they only had the lunch menu for RW, and according to Open Table the reservations sold out like it was the Rolling Stones concert. But I called and got us in nonetheless. Obviously, it was extremely busy when we got there, and service was pretty slow. One again, probably because of RW. But all of the staff whom we encountered were very extremely pleasant and cheerful.  I had suspected that this was going to be one of those dining experiences where you stop for a sandwich on the way home, and I was right. (We didn't; we just had dinner early.) The portions were excruciatingly small. Like, the entrees were the size I'd expect for an appetizer. It was as if RW was a way of saying, ""This is a snapshot of what your meal would be like if you ate here for full price"" rather than offering an actual meal.  But the presentation and flavors were exquisite!

Staff nicely dressed and everything. They have a coat check but no need to do that if you want to keep your own coat. Down to the food. We ordered the seared bay scallops as the app, the girlfriend got the sturgeon, and I got the wagyu flat iron. . They also give you a small tempura perch dish which was pretty good for free. The scallops were pretty delicious. Good flavor and when you eat it with the onion and squash sauce, pretty bomb. I tasted the sturgeon and it was alright for me. Not really a fish person so that's just my opinion. Thought my wagyu flat iorn was great though. Eating it with the cabbage, grapes, and beef sauce was delicious. It was recommended to me by the server over the pork collar and was a great choice.  For dessert we got the rum cheesecake and that was pretty good. Good flavor, you can really taste the rum. Obviously the only down side was that it was pretty expensive and the portions were a little on the small side, but one should already expect that coming in to this place and after reading reviews.

The service was prompt, and the server was polite - maybe a little too on top of things and too polite if that makes any sense.  There were points when we felt smothered and just wanted to talk without being interrupted by somebody topping off our waters or asking how things were.  We started with a couple of drinks.  The drink menu was what you would expect - lots of wines and high end spirits.  We ordered a couple of appetizers.  I opted for the suckling pig, and my fiancee went with the scallops.  Both were good, but not mind blowing.  For the main course, we ordered the elk loin and the pork collar.  Again - both were okay.  The highlight of the evening was probably the dessert, which also happened to coincide with the miserable couple next to us leaving.  We had a dark rum cheesecake with pineapple shaved ice.  It was pretty tasty.  The pineapple shaved ice was my favorite part of the evening.

2013-12-10,3.0,"I'm going to go ahead and give Blackbird a three star rating based on the overall experience.  I dined here recently on a Friday evening, the dining room and bar were both at capacity the 2+ hours I was there. The noise level is very high, especially since the tables are placed in close proximity to each other.  We literally could hear what people at the other tables were saying without trying to eavesdrop...had to make it a point *not* to overhear what was being said in some cases.  That also made it a bit difficult to have a normal conversation over dinner. The pre-dinner drinks we got at the bar were very good and the bartender was very  knowledgeable and welcoming.  The server(s) were very efficient, not a lot of time for small talk since they had a packed house.  They were friendly enough though and offered to answer questions, make recommendations, etc. We did not have time for the tasting menu, so we opted to split two appetizers, two entrees and dessert.  The scallop appetizer was bland tasting and a couple of the scallops were a bit gritty.  The steak tartare was served with a sauce that accompanied it nicely.  The sea bass entree failed to impress as it also was a bit on the bland side.  The steak loin appetizer was mediocre; it was served warm, not hot and didn't seem to be a high quality cut of beef...some of it was on the stringy side. Dessert was a rum cheesecake with pineapple ice and mustard sauce.  No complaints regarding dessert although I don't think I'd order it again. Blackbird tries very hard to be a very modern, urban sort of foodie restaurant.  They support the go local movement, have some hipsters working there, have a mixologist on staff, etc.  I'm glad that I went and I applaud their efforts.  But it's not a place I'd highly recommend, especially given the variety and quality of restaurants in Chicago.  For me, there are better options.",0.965,0.858,0.1,0.042,0.5719040404040404

Yes, even with the soup. Or....just order off the regular menu and save yourself a couple hundred bucks and then go back a different time to try something else.   huh.   Apparently self control is something I don't exhibit a lot of in my life.  I think I should make some changes.  Thank you Blackbird.",0.9542,0.841,0.134,0.025,0.5275507478632477

Also, the cooks take risks, and we like to be surprised. Starters: Excellent bread! Very good: octopus on parsnip puree and a lot of thyme. This was a marvel. Not good: Butternut bits on very, very bitter fried endives. The brownish blood sauce was not very appealing neither. That was a miss, and there goes the 5th star. Entree (I always find this word funny, because it's French for starter): Not bad: sea bass with fennel, pretty classic. Good: Lamb's saddle on sweet cabbage, horseradish and apricots. The meat was cooked to perfection, the rest was a bit too sweet, and the ricotta (which tasted a lot like sour cream, I think) was completely unnecessary. But overall, this was an excellent dish. No carbs in all the above-mentioned dishes, we would have liked a potato or two with the meat and fish... But the real surprise were the desserts... Cheesecake on mustard, and the melted chocolate on rice with date ice cream. It was bold, original, and absolutely delicious. I'd give 5 stars to the dessert's cook.

Again, I explained my understanding of the menu, and that i did not receive the food.  They promptly gave me a takeout box as I was on my way out after paying the bill, however it was not the desert I ordered but some chocolates which were delicious and made up for the lack of attention.

The service was a little slow, but the incredible food and wonderful dining atmosphere made the longer meal desirable rather than irritating. I ordered the sturgeon, which our server noted has been on the menu for 16 years and is the most requested item. It was definitely the right choice: the fish was wood-smoked impeccably and served in a meat (chicken? Maybe pork? I forget) jus which added body to the otherwise light sturgeon. Topped with caviar and roasted fingerling potatoes, every single flavor on the plate came together in a completely unexpected but much appreciated way.",0.9502,0.816,0.154,0.03,0.6468749999999999

This was literally a tasting menu and consisted of what I estimate to be around 250 calories. I would have consumed more if I went to Whole Foods for samples. My second visit was for dinner and we had impeccable service and great drinks, however the portions again were minuscule and would be in the running for most expensive calorie per dollar out of any place in Chicago.

Mary hated the butter, she thought it had raw egg; I agreed and that's why I loved it. Cocktails: Their take on the Vieux Carre is the best I've had, but pricey (22$). Pretty worth it. I want to try to recreate this version at home. Nice wine list, but prices are marked up a little too much. Greedy, greedy. I had a 20$ glass of Oregon Pinot that was elegant but a little indistinct for the price. Smoked Arctic Char was terrific. Great balance of flavors, enjoyed it a lot. Decent portion size too.  Chilled Romaine Soup was very rich and luxurious, half a bowl was plenty.  Sturgeon was also very good, though a very tiny portion (I did have the prix fixe). I would've rather paid more for a larger portion. The bouillabaisse was a problem. One shrimp and 4 mussels = Not enough fish. The potatoes were plentiful but raw. Blackbird can do better. We mentioned this and they removed it from the bill without us asking which was perfect and classy. Iced tea was all water, not brewed enough maybe.  Service was good. Our main waiter could've been around more, but they were a little slammed by lunch rush. Bubble gum ice cream dessert. Silly but not particularly good. Would not revisit. The lunch we had at The Gage in the tourist district the day before was significantly better, and dare I say, at least as interesting.

The food was fantastic, as expected, the service was great, and I loved the clean, modern decor. I was a little worried that it would be a little on the stuffy side but it wasn't at all-beautiful but with a very relaxed vibe. After a round of cocktails we ordered 3 appetizers, because we just couldn't decide on 2! We had crispy suckling pig, fried frog legs, and a salad of endives and crispy potatoes topped with a poached egg. The suckling pig was very tasty and I loved the bright components of the boneless frog legs dish, but my favorite was definitely the salad of endives. The presentation is beautiful (they cut it up for you table side) and the flavors are fresh and everything works perfectly together. For mains my husband ordered the striploin and I ordered the lamb saddle. The striploin was served with a seaweed pesto that made the dish very unique and the lamb was just all-around delicious.  At this point we were pretty stuffed but of course there's always room for dessert!

The décor is very modern and clean, with bench seating running the whole length of the restaurant.  right from the get go they started off poorly. Despite there being three tables in a row open, they tried to sit us directly by another couple, and instead we asked to sit at the middle table. I am sure the other couple appreciated a little extra breathing room as well. We tried sitting at the end table that was open as well, but it was ""spoken for.""  We ordered the endive salad which was great for our appetizer. It had good flavor and a light dressing that went well with the egg yolk and bacon. The Dinner entrees are all very fancy, and involve some sort of seafood or rabbit. I chose the simple lamb, which was very good it was served in a very modern style and came with complimentary sides that worked well with the meat. My girlfriend got the black bean pasta and really liked it as well. Portions were small as we expected.  The drinks were really good, I ordered the smoke and sour (Whiskey sour with smoked meringue on top).  The dessert was where we really decided we had kind of had enough of the place...see the entire atmosphere was stuffy. It's a modern décor, but it's also pretty pretentious in how the servers are, the woman who sat us, the gentleman taking the orders...all of it. Plus the couples coming to the restaurant as the evening progressed were much older (50s and 60s) and hardly spoke. It felt like when I was young and had to go to the fancy restaurant with my grandparents. SO...despite the food being great, we still wanted to leave because we felt so uncomfortable the entire time. Dessert sealed the deal. We ordered the raspberry sorbet to share and what they brought us was a full sized dinner plate, with about half a handful of sorbet/banana pudding pushed over to the side, and the plate had been painted to make sort of a crescent moon shape...it looked ridiculous, and wasn't very good. So we were ready to leave pretty quick after that.  Food is good, atmosphere is boring and stifling.

I think it's a GREAT deal for an amazing, high-scale appetizer, entree and dessert for only $22. - Lamb tartar with lentils - Confit duck leg with broccoli, potato granola, etc. - Something I can't find on the online menu - blackberry ice cream with vanilla, cake crumbs, and other stuff.....lol Lamb tartar: I've never tried LAMB tartar before so I was a little nervous, but it was amazing. The seasoning was not overwhelming so you could definitely get the juicy texture of the lamb every bite. As an asian, I wish I had chopsticks (lol) because I had a hard time picking up the small pieces sometimes, but its okay because I still gobbled the whole thing up. The lentils were cooked PERFECTLY and the crunch went really well with the chewy, juiciness of the lamb. Confit duck leg: I had this last time too, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. How do they cook the duck leg so well? It literally MELTS in your mouth. And you might be disappointed by the small piece on the plate, but trust me, it's more than it looks, because the whole thing is basically a chunk of meat, and the bone is realllyyy small. The duck is perfectly sweet, and the fattiness of the duck is just-right.  Dessert: You can't go wrong with dessert....Except my friends ordered the roasted peanut ice cream, and that...was...sooooo peanut buttery. I wouldn't really recommend THAT dessert to others. But mine, which I really can't recall the name, came in a small glass cup, with cake crumbs on the bottom, and vanilla and blackberry ice cream, and fresh blackberries with some kind of sauce drizzled on top.

And finally the dessert- definitely THE most creative desserts I've ever consumed.  Bubblegum ice cream really tasted exactly like bubblegum!  My favorite was the peanut ice cream with carrot puree.  It sounds so bizarre but tastes so good together.  The goat cheesecake was very rich and I'm sure people who like cheesecake would die happy eating it.  I didn't care much for the fourth dessert with a pastry thing in the middle and cheese somewhere hidden in the dish, but the savory lovers dug in.   Good cocktails, great service and food.  No wonder it does so well.",0.996,0.715,0.198,0.087,0.5328425925925927

2013-07-13,4.0,"I was in Chicago Monday through Wednesday for work, and after my first night's required dinner (see a different review), I finally got to choose a restaurant on my own.  I had a number of places that I wanted to go but decided upon Blackbird on the recommendation of a friend. Story time over. Blackbird has a nice, comfortable, sleek, and modern-feeling interior design.  The tables have white table clothes and the servers are wearing tie and jacket (at least ours was).  The feel leaves you in a mindset of elegance.  That said, I like that everyone within Blackbird is dressed smart-casual (see: dark pair of dress blue jeans and nice shirt, but nothing too fancy). Appetizer: We split two: (a) Pork and (b) Soft shell crab.  Both were very good - especially the soft shell crab which was cooked in either bourbon or whiskey (it's hard to tell when the alcohol is burned off during the cooking process - as it should be) but there was definitely a hint of one or the other which made the dish extra nice. Main Course: I enjoyed dry-aged striploin with apricot and seaweed pesto (cooked medium rare).  The portion size was almost perfect.  I felt like potentially another 2 ounces of the striploin would have made the meal the perfect size.  Everything about it was great.  My colleague enjoyed the roasted lamb saddle with smoked ricotta and some ruffage (also cooked medium rare).  She said that hers was really good and the portion was definitely appropriate for her small frame.

We are huge foodies and enjoy places like girl and the goat, zellas, etc. but here, we got a small amt of food for a high price. Keeping in mind, we got free champagne and dessert courtesy of someone we know.  The food was EXCELLENT. We had tartar and fiou gras for aps, an order of asparagus, and then he had the fish/chicken dish and I had the lamb. Everything tasted wonderful. Only downside is I like my lamb a little more well done, and it was pretty rare.  The atmosphere is great. Very clean, classy, the wait staff is wonderful, and it is a perfect place for a date night. They recommend you have 1 ap/ 1 entree per person. Aps start at around $20/plate and entrees are around $40... so you can see how you can easily rack up a $250 bill for 2 people... Would we come back... probably not unless we won the lottery. It was a one and done kind of place. The food was good, but I wouldn't say worth the heafty penny.

2013-07-01,5.0,"Despite the acclaim, I was half-expecting my meal at Blackbird to be somewhat disappointing. Perhaps it would be pedestrian, unimaginative, and stingy. I was way off, fortunately, and had one of the best meals of my life so far here. The fine-dining equivalent of sister-restaurant Avec. The food is both inventive and traditional, well-balanced and sophisticated. It delights and challenges your palate.  The interior is small and chic, tables are very close together, it's noisy but not at all deafening. The service is both personable and extremely professional, not snobby in the least. Blackbird also has one of , if not the best, cocktail programs of any restaurant in the city - which is not surprising considering that Kahan is also being The Violet Hour in Wicker Park, one of the best cocktail lounges in the world.  Now for the food. I could see how some people would say the portions are too small, but for me and my girl, they were just right. We had 3 courses each and felt just right afterward, not at all hungry or gorged. Large people with larger appetites might not get full on 3 courses, but I think the restaurant has perfected the portions so that they adequately fill up the average diner. Appetizers: we shared the Suckling Pig and Fried Frog's Legs. The Suckling Pig came with a  generous block of pig topped with summer truffle and paired with zucchini and fig-molasses puree. The dish was spectacular and also the most balanced, complex dish of the night. Now, the summer truffle smelled straight up like semen, and I didn't enjoy eating it because I couldn't get passed the smell of semen. My girl agreed that it smelled like semen but she really loved the earthy complexity of the truffle, so it's just a matter of taste. If, like me, you can't get passed really pungent foods, don't get this, but realize that it's a limitation of your own palate rather than a shortcoming of the kitchen. The Frog Legs were chicken-fried and tasted like exquisite chicken nuggets, paired perfectly with avocado puree, pickled jalapenos and fried lilly bulbs, which tasted exactly like the frog legs. We might have actually preferred the legs to have had the bones in them, but the restaurant preferred that diners not have to play with bones. This was a very small portion compared to the pig, but very good. Entrees: we shared the wood-grilled Sturgeon and Lamb saddle. We both preferred the lamb, but the sturgeon was also very good, best fish I've had in a while in Chicago. A beautiful slab of sturgeon paired marinated kale, kale chips, walnut puree and a delicious little boneless chicken wing. The dish was rather simple but the sturgeon spoke for itself. The lamb was perhaps the best entrée we've ever had: 5 or 6 sizable chunks (maybe 10 - 15 bites total) of perfectly cooked lamb paired with caramelized cabbage, smoked ricotta and walnuts, I believe. The elements combined for an exquisite mouthful. An extremely sophisticated and well-balanced dish. NOTE: the table next to us ordered the dry-aged sirloin, and we regretted not getting this when we saw it. It looked insanely good. I'd get it next time if it's still on the menu, or something similar. Dessert: we shared the Chocolate Torte and the Cheddar Cheese plate, and preferred the cheese plate. The torte was very good and very savory - perhaps a bit too savory for me. Again it was extremely balanced, with a smallish dark chocolate torte paired with a scoop of burnt honey ice cream and a spattering of cumin puffs - yeah, pastries flavored heavily with cumin. I love chocolate and cumin together, so this was delicious. The cheese plate was mind-blowing.  A beautiful, chaotic presentation of cheese, black currant jam, toasted brioche and mascarpone. A cheese-lover's ideal dessert.",0.9992,0.755,0.208,0.037,0.5981557067271355

I came here with my family to celebrate my brothers graduation (this was my choice)  At first it seemed nice, we got seated at a nice table right next to the open kitchen. We were enjoying watching the chefs work over cocktails and wine. When it came time to order I finally convinced my family to go for the chefs tasting menu. BIG MISTAKE. There were only two dishes that were actually edible out of the 8 savory dishes we received that night. I was sooooo disappointed with the food, I was so excited to eat here. This was my first time in Chicago and I expected so much more from the food here, seeing that almost everyone who rates this place gives it 4-5 stars. The dessert also lacked in flavor, and was very redundant. We got two ice cream courses... I would expect more from a 120$ tasting menu. I don't understand why people are raving about this place, my family was literally about to stand up and walk away after the 3rd course.  Now the service. The service was terrible. I felt like I was at a funeral. None of the runners looked me in the eye or smiled when they came to bring or take away any food, it was depressing. And for the server, he saw that we were not enjoying our meal and only came to ask once (during a 3 hour dinner) if everything was ok and when we told him no he made it seem like it was our fault... I now see what a Michelin star can do to a persons ego. After realizing we did not enjoy the meal he avoided us the rest of the night and gave us a poor apology at the end. This is unacceptable at a restaurant with such high standards and prices. At least the service should be good.

Point is... it was delicious. Then, while we were waiting for our food, they gave us a complimentary custard with candied sunflower seeds. Portion was tiny, but hey, free stuff!

It was a perfect mixture of new flavors and textures and just plain deliciousness. It had mushrooms in it, and even as a mushroom hater, I have to say that it was actually one of my favorite parts of the dish. And any restaurant that can turn a hated food into something I love HAS to be doing something right! The boyfriend got a steak dish, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert, we got a banana bread dessert with some ice cream, and they gave us a small complimentary plate with birthday cake flavored ice cream and chocolate mousse with a lit candle for our two year (how sweet).

2013-04-18,4.0,"I had my first Blackbird experience yesterday during lunch and I am absolutely a big fan.  There are a few things to know before going into Blackbird.  First, this is an upscale restaurant that prides themselves on their quality, execution, and presentation of their ingredients.  They have a revolving menu with a few items that seem to be their staples. The atmosphere is bright, clean, and modern, white tables and a casual and welcoming vibe.  Not TOO casual, but casual for the type of cuisine that they serve.  I was very nicely greeted at the door, and my coat and umbrella were taken immediately.  The tables are close together but not as cramped as Avec or other super cozy restaurants.  You can still easily have a conversation with your friends without feeling like the people next to you are hearing every word. I was the first of our party of 3 and was seated immediately on time for our reservation.  I was mockingly offended that my white napkin was immediately switched out for a black one when no one else had black napkins, until my friend pointed out that it was because I was wearing black pants and the restaurant didn't want the white napkin to leave white lint.  Shows how fancy I am. The wine list is extensive at Blackbird with great choices by the glass and a huge and enticing selection by the bottle.  I took our server's recommendation and tried their newest (and most expensive) addition, the 2007 Dusky Goose Pinot Noir, that was $20 for a glass and worth every sip.  I loved the wine so much that I found a bottle online when I got home and purchased it.  $20 for a glass may sound ridiculous, but the bottle itself was selling for $70 online, so I'd say this was almost a steal at Blackbird, considering you pay $13 for a glass of wine that comes from a $15 bottle at most restaurants.   We chose to go with the lunch pre fixe menu to try multiple courses.  The sturgeon had been most highly recommended on yelp, so I figured I have to try that and it conveniently was a choice on their pre fixe entree list. After ordering, our server brought us some hearty grained bread with a dill spread. The spread was excellent but the bread was a little cold and a little dense for my taste.  The first course was the cauliflower soup that was the perfect consistency without being too heavy or creamy.  It was served room temperature with a couple pieces of dill and cauliflower.  Very tasty and very refreshing. The main course was the sturgeon.  Let me preface it by saying, that Blackbird is the type of place that serves small portions on big plates and if you're the type of person who pays for quantity and not quality, then this place is not for you.  However, I guarantee that you will leave perfectly full even if you don't think you're consuming a large amount of food.  The sturgeon was excellent.  Grilled to perfection with a lovely charred flavor.  I enjoyed the accompanying onion noodles and the little dabs of buttermilk sauce added extra flavor.  The sturgeon had a nice meaty texture, similar to that of swordfish, but was moist and flavorful, not dried out at all.  It was excellent. We finished with our dessert course and I selected the goat cheese cheesecake that was surprisingly delicious.  A great blend of sweet and not so sweet with a little lump of ice cream to add a hit of sugar.  The grilled grapefruit topping added some bitterness (and I normally despise grapefruit) that seemed to make the whole thing work. This was a great first experience at Blackbird and I look forward to returning for dinner.  Blackbird is an expensive experience (though their $22 pre fixe lunch is quite a deal in my opinion) but the quality of the food is excellent, the service was excellent, and it's an experience I would gladly enjoy again.",0.9992,0.762,0.2,0.038,0.5430253968253969

We were seated up against the window in the front. The restaurant is tiny so even though our party of 3 was on display to Randolph passers-by I was glad that we weren't seated further back. The tables are super tight.  Honestly nothing stands out as being wrong with our meal, but nothing stands out as being something I'd rush back to pay tons of money for. The service was impeccable, the wine we had was great, and the food was beautifully prepared. That being said, the value is just not there. The portions were small. For a $40 piece of fish, I'd obviously expect it to be cooked perfectly, which it was, but I'd like something else on the plate besides sauce. I liked that I wasn't overly full but I know my husband left hungry. Between the table, we had 2 appetizers (lamb tartare was the highlight), 3 entrees, 3 desserts, 1 bottle of wine and 3 after dinner cocktails. I didn't see the bill but a quick assessment puts our bill at almost $400 after tax and tip.

Finally made it last week, and it's seemingly just as buzzy as it was back then. After eating the food, I'm not surprised.  Roasted Foie Gras ($20) is smoky on the outside, but soft like butter on the inside; a nuanced, interesting take on a classic. Ditto for the Belgian Endive ($17), which comes encased in a potato shell and topped with a poached egg; the gorgeous melange is presented and then mixed up tableside. Clove-rubbed elk loin ($42), served with Job's Tears (ie Japanese risotto), sunchokes, and black truffles is subtle yet elegant; cloves tend to overpower any dish they're in, but not here. Mont Blanc, for dessert ($10), chestnut glace with vanilla cream, is finished with a pour of warm chocolate tableside; a perfect cap to an excellent meal.  Pricing is high, but appropriate for the caliber of the food. Tables are very close together, which I didn't mind but which would probably put off some diners. Service is impeccable. All in all, in the sea of often indistinguishable restaurants that is Chicago, Blackbird truly stands out. It has transcended trendiness, and is a real original.

I am going totally vegan for lent and our waiter and the kitchen were beyond accommodating. They kindly prepared a vegan version of the pea soup, maitake mushroom dinner, and banana sorbet (with carmelized bananas and hazelnuts). I let my boyfriend finish the pea soup because it was so amazingly perfect and it was his birthday after all. There wasn't a drop of food on either of our dishses or a drop of a booze in our glasses. The drinks were out of this world, I had the slayer and he had the violet violet. I've never had a drink with so many layers of flavor and a perfect amount of heat. The service was amazing, welcoming, helpful, and kind. We're not the type who can regularly eat at restaurants like this and they didn't make us feel bad for that at all.

2013-03-25,5.0,"On Saturday, 3/23/13 my brother and I had 10pm reservations at Blackbird. We had reviewed several menus, reviews, articles, and our own tastes to pick a tasting menu in Chicago. I am so pleased we settled on Blackbird. The tasting menu was better than anticipated and I had extremely high hopes going in. From the pine nut custard with caviar and braised apricots, to the absolute best duck I have ever tasted, to the cheese course with a supreme cow's milk, the meal was impressive to say the least. Back to the duck, the simple preparation was presented with a single stalk of broccoli and potato granola, sesame and raisin cream. I could go on and on about the duck. The first 3 courses wow'd both of us! The custard, hamachi tartare with both crispy and stewed lentils, rhubarb, in spicy marrow and a sprig of chickweed.  The spring pea and tofu soup was the best soup I have ever tasted. Just to give proper coverage, the chef did amazing work with sake-steamed cod paired with braised octopus. Both were prepared to the perfect texture and taste. The pork and elk were also creative, precisely prepped and delivered with excellence. We chose our own wine, starting with champagne and moving to an Oregon Pinot for the remainder of the menu.

2013-02-15,2.0,"Aw man. I was really hoping this would be a 5 star experience. I came here almost a week ago and I have extreme buyers remorse all week. I feel like I just wasted a lot of money on something that was mediocre at best. I'm a mere college student yet budding foodie, so I don't have a ton of money to spend. When I do, it better be good. I heard some good things about Blackbird but I was really let down by my experience. If you can afford to be disappointed then see for yourself, but if you're at all like me then go somewhere else and invest in a good meal (Alinea, Moto, Boka, Avec, etc.) A friend chose this place and I was really excited to try it for the first time. We got the tasting menu with the wine pairings. Let's start with one of the highlights of my dinner: their butter. I don't know what exactly they did to make the butter so freaking good but I wanted to eat it like ice cream. However, it is kind of sad that one of the best and most memorable parts of my $200+ dinner was the complimentary butter.  I honestly can't even remember half of the dishes because they weren't very memorable. I can name off at least 70% of tasting menus I had at other places over the past few years, but I was here last Saturday and can only name a few of the dishes.  The elk was great. I've never had elk so I have nothing to compare it to, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The rabbit was okay, I could have done without it. I substituted the lamb tartare for salmon which may have been the best dish I had. Strange, because that wasn't even on the tasting menu. The octopus was just bad. I am not a huge octopus fan to begin with, but this was just rubbery and salty. The fish and squash it was paired with was really good but the octopus completely ruined it. I can't believe a michelin rated restaurant served a dish so sub par. I could barely finish it, and my friend was trying to be positive by saying ""Maybe we are just really sensitive to salt?"". No, we aren't. It was just bad. The wine pairings were very disappointing. I definitely regret ordering that, I would have preferred to just stick to what I know. Usually I love wine pairings because I get to try new things and the flavors usually compliment each other really well. Here, not so much. I actually had to have my friend drink the last two because they were WAY too sweet for what they were paired with. It also tasted like Franzia to me.    The service was okay. There were a few times where our food came out 5ish minutes before our old wine glasses were taken away and new ones were poured. We were there late and there weren't many other tables so I'm not sure why there were so many errors. I really didn't care, it could have been worse, but for the price point I would expect something better. Other than that the service was fine. Our servers were polite but not very engaging or noteworthy. They seemed rushed. So all in all I am really disappointed that I spent that kind of money here when I could have gone to many other places in the city that I know are good. I absolutely love the other restaurants in this group (Avec and Big Star are some of my favorite places in the city).

The service was lovely - warm and not pretentious at all.  I enjoyed a little slower pace between courses so we didn't rush from one dish to the next.  We were disappointed the elk was sold out and the table next to us was told the striped bass was sold out as well.  With very few entrees to chose from nothing should be sold out on a Saturday night at 9 pm.  Great cocktails and a very manageable noise level.  With 2 cocktails, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and an after dinner drink our bill came to $150.  Well worth the price for a great experience.",0.9929,0.723,0.248,0.028,0.5835714285714286
2013-01-19,4.0,"Came here for the prix fixe lunch, and was going to review it ... but then I got lazy and procrastinated. Fortunately, I had the chance to return to Blackbird (for a free dinner courtesy of my team, woohoo!) - and now I'm giving it a full star more. I had really high expectations for Blackbird, but the prix fixe left me feeling really underwhelmed. So what was the problem? On the whole, I felt like the portions were incredibly small (felt like I could eat another entire meal afterwards). I understand the restaurant's reputation and all, but I've had delicious AND filling prix fixe meals at similarly high-end places (thank you, Restaurant Week!!) But on top of just the portion size , the service was okay (nothing to write home about), and even the food was, on balance, only okay. Here's what I got: Appetizer: Mixed Greens Salad - this was the worst of the three. It was like any other salad ... and, strangely, a little sour. (Too much dressing?) Entree: Duck Confit (leg) - delicious! but a little salty, and just incredibly small .. I probably wouldn't have thought much about the limited portion size, however, if the duck hadn't been served on a gigantic dish ... Dessert: Winter Coupe - I was most excited for this one, since desserts in fancier restaurants are usually super cool (and delicious). The presentation was underwhelming (it's like two tiny scoops of ice cream in a glass, with some other bits sprinkled at the bottom), and the taste, while I remember being good, has already faded in my memory :( Naturally, I was going to come home and give Blackbird a - gasp! - 3 star rating. But then I had dinner: Veal Sweetbreads - first time having sweetbreads, not bad at all! the hazelnut, especially, brought out a nice contrast to the sweetbread Striploin & Cheek - very tender, flavored wonderfully, portion size was absolutely reasonable Mont Blanc - so so ... I guess I'm just not a fan of Blackbird's desserts ... Blackbird Orange (seasonal cocktail): delicious! something sweeter and a little lighter, just as I had requested (the waitress suggested it to me) So, what did I learn? Bottom line about Blackbird: ignore the tantalizing price of the prix fixe lunch, and order from their a la carte menu instead - the better experience (presentation, quality of the food, etc.) is definitely worth it!",0.9966,0.74,0.201,0.06,0.5658066083576289

I liked the sleek, white interior.  It was also a nice treat to pull back the curtain in the women's bathroom.  Give it a try when you are there! If it was possible on yelp, I would deduct half a star because the tables are too close together, there is really no space at the check in table, and the acoustics are awful (really could not hear the server most of the meal).  Additionally, I asked the server which cocktail to order after I had narrowed it down to two, and she gave a long speech which really made it hard for me to decipher which she preferred.  Clearer and more personal explanations would have been useful with the cocktails, as her recommendation of the duck was spot on!   You must dine here!  Quite the culinary delight!",0.9887,0.788,0.175,0.036,0.478531746031746

And it was nice that the two sandwiches we got came with different fries - one garlic, one savory. CONS: Pricy, and we sent back the rib burger because it was fairly flavorless.  MUST-HAVES: Salad of endives, sage pain perdu dessert The honey + butter that came out with our bread was amazing: yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… ~~APPETIZERS~~ * salad of endives - 4 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… post-pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… (w/ baby lettuce, potato, basil, dijon, pancetta, & poached egg. $9) Love the presentation! This came out looking like bouquet of lettuce in a woven basket. Turns out it was a crisped bread basket - the server broke it apart in front of us and mixed it in with the greens, crispy & really flavorful bacon, and egg yolk. It was just fun to watch and eat, and I loved having the egg yolk as a kind of dressing. ~~SANDWICHES~~ * organic pork belly sandwich - 3.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… (w/ fennel slaw, bread & butter pickles, dijonnaise, cucumber salad, & garlic fries. $14) The garlic fries were really good, thin and just barely crisped with a good bite. The pork was fatty, could have been more crisped. The bread was on the dry & hard side, but that's the sourdough style. The overall flavors of this was also on the sour, pickled side, which just isn't my favorite, but my friend really liked this sandwich.  * grilled pqm short rib burger - 3 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… (w/ kimchi slaw, duck egg yolk, sharp cheddar, & pommes frites. $15) My friend sent this sandwich back - I thought it wasn't terrible or amazing either way, but she found it completely flavorless. The texture and flavor of the fries was good. We were still charged for this originally on the bill but did ask and got it comp'ed.  ~~ENTREES~~ * confit duck leg - 4 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… cross-section:  yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… (w/ grilled leek, green grapes, & candied/toasted quinoa. $16) This was what we got in place of the rib burger. The duck meat had amazing moist texture, without being overly tender - ie. something we could chew on. It was really salty, but if you like things with a lot of flavor you'll enjoy this. The crispy quinoa was really great too. ~~DESSERTS~~ * Sage pain perdu - 4.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… (honey-roasted apples, gouda ice cream, black walnuts. $11) This was an AMAZING dessert.  The bread itself were INCREDIBLY moist and went amazingly well with everything else on the plate.

2012-12-02,4.0,"Being in town for only a few days left little time to eat at even a select few restaurants. Thus, after reading about all of its praise and coming across its affordable 3-course prix-fixe lunch offering ($22pp), I decided a few weeks ago that Blackbird was a must to check out while in town. I made reservations for my girlfriend and I at noon in anticipation of it being really busy around lunch. While only a few guests were dining there once we arrived, the restaurant quickly filled for lunch by the end of its first hour open. Ambiance was very classy. The coat-check at the entrance was a nice surprise when we got in. My girlfriend and I decided to forgo the prix-fixe so she could get the Korean-influenced Short Rib Burger while I could get the Grilled Lamb Tenderloin. The waiter was very helpful in suggesting the best temperatures for our meat to be cooked (medium-rare for both) and, based upon his suggestion, I was convinced into ordering the soup of the day, which was a Butternut Squash Soup with Smoked Sable. We were offered typical complimentary bread and butter to start. The butter was very rich with a touch of sweet from the spoonful of poured honey. I tried her burger, which was more on the rare side. Though the fries were better than I would've expected. Very good as far as french fries go--crisp and delicious. My soup was memorably presented as the contents were presented alone in the bowl before the waiter poured the vibrant yellow soup into the bowl at the table. Rich, creamy, and comforting soup on a gloomy Autumn day. The slivers of fish were fatty and smoky. The smokiness reminded me of bacon, but this was better. There were a lot of different flavors in the bowl. As for my entree, the sunchoke vegetable was something I had never had before...it was interesting. It reminded me of jicama or radish. Overall the lamb dish, which was cooked well, was good but not as memorable as the soup. As we ate, we could tell there were a lot of regulars dining here around us. That wasn't surprising and wouldn't mind coming back as well after having a very good lunch here.",0.9922,0.842,0.142,0.016,0.5232945736434109

After looking at the menu, I realized that our food leanings were going to be Pinot friendly.  I asked our waitress (who was great) to suggest me a bottle, as I was not familiar w some in the 100$ price range.  The bottle that she picked was terrible...and this is coming from someone who loves every wine you give me.  It was the equivalent of fresh pressed cranberry juice and was so tart and acidic it made my teeth hurt and nuked anything i ate following it.  After much internal debate I deemed it undrinkable.  In fact I sat there thinking how many bottles of wine I have had at restaurants in my life (1000+) and how I was going to send one back for the first time ever.  Not a minor decision at all... They were gracious about it and bottle 2 was much better.   I had the rabbit dish and was dismayed to see that the entire plate was about the size of three pieces of sushi.  While technically well made it was bland and unmemorable.  The garnish and the accompanying sauce which took up half the plate were so vinegar heavy that they killed any flavors.  Listen, I get it...with fatty rich foods, you need some acid.  But this was like someone pouring white vinegar on your meal.  The escargot with the plate (a personal favorite) tasted like they came out of a can and  were proclaimed by my wife to be one of the worst things she had ever tried. Still hungry, I ordered dessert.  While it was good, it was only 2-3 bites and nothing memorable.

I have never had arctic char before but have heard about it many times on Food Network (""Chopped"" fan here) and wanted to see what it tasted like. It was pretty good: kinda smoky and buttery. The halibut was firm and flavorful, and the cucumber-miso sauce was an interesting combination. Bf really liked the mustard seeds and at one point I had to ask if he was ok because he was just sitting there staring at his plate. ""I'm just eating the mustard seeds. They're good."" Another thing I really liked was the birthday cake flavored ice cream I got as a birthday treat. It was unlike any dessert I've ever had. I took a spoonful into my mouth and had to ask my bf, ""He did say this was ice cream right?"" because the texture was cake-like but it melted at the same time. How did they do that???! I want to go there and say it's my birthday again just to eat that ice cream.  Service was some of the best I've had at an establishment: water glasses always kept full, plates cleared in a timely manner, silverware was changed for each course, and servers telling us what each dish was. Our main server (I forgot what her name was) was very friendly and patient with us, since we took a while to decide whether we wanted separate entrees or the tasting menu.

There are meals that elevate eating beyond sustenance or social experience to what is essentially art. Blackbird provided none of these things. In fact, the only thing I still remember vividly about my ~$175 meal were the two dessert courses. They weren't just not tasty, they were actually kind of nasty. The flavors just didn't work together at all. The presentation could be aptly described as ""a child doodling.""

We started by sharing the endive salad with pancetta and a poached egg in a crispy potato ""nest"".  I normally don't love Lyonnaise salads, but this one was spectacular!  The ingredients weren't so hot they made the endive soggy, and the dijon and basil dressing worked perfectly with the other strong flavors.  The salad was large though, and since I was getting an entree I was glad I shared it. Next we split two dishes- the striploin with fried polenta, escarole, poached quince, and almond relish, and the pork roast with whole wheat knephla (I had no idea what this was but it was good), zucchini, figs, black sesame seeds, and dill.  I don't know which one I preferred- the meats were complemented perfectly with the innovative flavors that accompanied them.  I had never tasted those combinations and it was really interesting.  I would have a hard time going back and not ordering any of those three dishes! For dessert we split the miniature apple tarts with apples and gouda ice cream with black walnuts.  It was really interesting and the gouda ice cream was the strangest ice cream I've ever had, but it was great.  Half was definitely enough, but I liked it a lot.

The restaurant is small (the hostess actually had to move our table in order to give me access to my seat) but its size is comparable to lots I have been to in Chicago. The service was outstanding. We encountered a small hiccup when we ordered as our waiter informed us that the only vegetarian option on the menu was not available that evening. As soon as I let him know I was a vegetarian, he stated that the kitchen would make something off the menu for me. The dish he described sounded delicious, so I ordered it. My husband ordered the chorizo pork patio roast. We both enjoyed our dishes, but my husband was disappointed in the portion size. It was enough food for me, but he was still hungry. We both enjoyed our desserts, and I believe I glimpsed the pastry chef smiling at us as we scarfed down our respective desserts.

After ordering a cocktail and a glass of wine, we started drooling at our neighbor's dishes.  The chef even came out to describe how each item was prepared!  While everything sounded wonderful, I went with the halibut and the hubby went with the vegetarian dish.  It was plated in such that every single bite.  Lynn suggested an amazing bottle of unoaked chardonnay to go with our dishes and it paired beautifully. OMG is all I can say....I savored every bite and every drip of wine.

2012-09-23,4.0,"I had the privilege of dining at Blackbird on a recent business trip to Chicago and found the restaurant to be very good, though it did fall just short of a 5 star rating IMO.  I did the 10-course tasting (8 menu courses + an amuse and a 'bonus' dessert).  Below were my observations: Course 1: Seared Ahi with ground cherries, challots, and wild rice. This was our amuse-bouche. I found it to be a nice, light way to begin a long tasting but there was nothing particularly memorable about it. Good sear on the ahi. 7/10 Course 2: Chilled turnip cream with grilled hamachi, smoked chicken consommé, apples, and coriander yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… This course was a very 'different' kind of chilled soup.  I liked the presentation - a bowl of perfectly arranged proteins was presented, and the thick turnip cream was poured over it from a small carafe. The flavor was very mild, but one of the two cuts of hamachi had a fishy taste. The other was fresher tasting. 7/10 Course 3: Black cod pil pil with heirloom tomatoes, watermelon, and sunflower yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… The presentation on this was absolutely beautiful. The cubes of compressed watermelon and tomato were the kind you hope for (but never get) whenever you cut either fruit...rich and full flavored. Perfect. I thought the portion of fish was a little lacking, but this dish was one of my favorites of the night. 9/10 Course 4: Roasted halibut with green faro, kohlrabi, mustard, and cucumber-miso juice  yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… I'm not a huge halibut fan, and I suppose this was as good a presentation and preparation one can hope for with this protein. The thinly sliced radishes on top were a fantastic decision, they really worked to enhance the flavor. The faro was a little al dente for my taste, but that's to be expected with the ingredient.  Tasty, but not overly memorable. 8/10 Course 5: Roasted pork belly with uni, red beets, tamarind, turmeric, and okra yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… This was a tough one for me. I really do like high-class pork fat dishes but this one was completely devoid of 'lean' - essentially it was a cube of seared pork fat. Tasty? Absolutely. Appetizing? Questionably. 7/10 Course 6: Aged duck breast with grilled leek, green grapes, quinoa, and creamed foie gras yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… As a foie gras fan (and from California where it is currently banned) I was excited to try this dish. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of duck white meat due to its gaminess and this dish was no exception. The skin could have been crispier as well, IMO. However the crispy quinoa and the foie gras cream were delicious. 7/10 Course 7: Dry-aged striploin with fried polenta, escarole, peach, and almond relish yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… Who else thinks those are nectarines? The server insisted they were peaches, but I know my stone fruit...anyhow, the ""peaches"" were the real star of this dish, SO flavorful. The striploin was (by definition) a tougher cut of meat.  I tend to go for the bone-in filet typically so I didn't enjoy as much as most other diners would. 7/10 Course 8: Prairie fruit farm 'black goat' goat's milk with caramelized figs, black olives, and cipollini onion yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… This course didn't have a whole lot of impact to be honest (although the plating was beautiful).  The brie-textured goat cheese was a terrific departure from the usual dry format, but the rest of the dish was decidedly too ""fig"". 6/10 Course 9: Pear sorbet with poppy seeds and pedro ximénez vinegar yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… Maybe my least favorite course of the night, this first dessert had a thick, toothpaste-like texture and was overly tart from the vinegar. I suppose it was designed as a palette-cleanser but it came off heavy where 'refreshing' should have been found. The poppyseed touille was this dish's only saving grace. It was crispy and perfectly flavored. 5/10 Course 10: Milk chocolate pudding with mesquite crumble, bourbon peaches, and caramelized milk ice cream yelp.com/biz_photos/blac… Where course 9 failed, this dish succeeded. Maybe one of my favorite dessert experiences in recent memory, the dish had two major components: strips of thickened pudding and the ice cream. The texture was just right, and the crumble added the needed crunch. Absolutely amazing! 10/10",0.9968,0.816,0.132,0.052,0.5939129072681704

I would recommend coming for lunch as it is much easier to get a reservation and you get a taste of the same food (and save a little money). On to the food... There was a cold carrot/fennel soup to start. It has a piece of halibut and some litte accoutrements scattered in a bowl. They poured the soup over the bowl and the little garnishes all floated to the top leaving an island of fish in the middle. The fish and soup were portioned small but the richness and creaminess made it hearty and filling.  Then I had the duck leg confit with grilled white asparagus. Also tasty and portioned appropriately small for a 3 course lunch. Kind of hard to mess up duck confit so I cant say too much about it. There were these little crispy green garnishes that my tablemates thought to resemble tree trimmings. Although they look like a deep fried fern tree, they tasted buttery and crisp and really complemented the meal. Eat the whole plate, dont be scared.

The space is small and very minimalist and extremely close tables with no privacy. We had an early seating so it wasn't packed when we sat down but by the time we left it was wall to wall. The service is spot on and I like the menu as being very approachable and easy to understand. What I appreciate most about Blackbird is that they serve 'regular' food prepared with a fine dining touch and style. There are no gimmicks, no foam balls wrapped inside a magic cube of grass colored corn starch (I'm exaggerating a bit here). Everything is refined, clean and classy. I give it 3 of 4 stars because I wasn't blown away with anything and I think the menu is priced to perfection (i.e. on the expensive side). Blackbird does all the little things right and presents a sophisticated and elegant meal in a setting more relaxed than the menu would suggest. A quick rundown of the meal: amuse bouche of salmon and grape, I had the salad of endives with crispy potatoes, basil, dijon, pancetta and poached egg to start and the prime striploin as the main dish.

The soft shell crab appetizer deep was good, but the only really interesting part about it was the potato chip crust and that's probably because it added a knockout of salt to the dish. The halibut was cooked very nicely, and the turnips and smoked sauce provided understated flavor. The poached salmon was also cooked very nicely and provided the most memorable part of the meal through the caramelized onions, which burst and popped with sweet oniony goodness.

The excellent star rating might sound odd based on my first impression, but as it turned out all of the very odd sounding flavor combinations were absolutely delicious. I'm thoroughly impressed that an establishment that has been around for 10+ years is still creating such interesting menus.

2012-06-26,2.0,"Blackbird is, in a nutshell, subpar and overpriced. I am astonished it has a Michelin star (in the company of places like Moto, Spiaggia, etc.). If you are on the fence about which types of reviews to believe (the beaming, emphatic ones, or the meh ones), I'll make it easy for you: if you're accustomed to eating well, you will be disappointed by Blackbird's mediocrity. If you eat at ""nice"" restaurants rarely, I'm sure it will meet your expectations. To start, we had several cocktails and glasses of wine, which were fine. In particular, the prima vera was tasty. But we were most excited about the food, and ordered three dishes that sounded great on paper: foie gras, rabbit, and halibut.  The foie gras was a bit bland. It is served chilled, as a slab, with a few interesting accoutrements. But really, I've had better foie gras off of the shelf in the Whole Foods fridge.  For foie gras that is meant to be eaten on its own (sans bread, as we were instructed), I was disappointed at what they were serving us. No matter, we powered through. The halibut was, like the foie gras, bland. It is seared on one side, and then doused in a butter cream sauce that was much more butter than cream.  It tasted like generic whitefish.  Moreover, there were way too many sharp, garlicky turnips adorning the halibut plate that did absolutely nothing for the dish. In addition, as I was eating my halibut I found a long-ish hair in the middle of my plate. This extinguished my appetite, and I mentioned it to the waitress who took the plate away.  She later came by to assure me it was not a human hair, but some sort of ""turnip hair.""  Possible, but even so, your dish should not be served with vegetable matter that looks like human hair. They served us a complimentary dessert neither of us wanted (or had the appetite for), which was a fun dessert (bubblegum ice cream) but nothing special. We made the best of our dinner and enjoyed another cocktail.  The nibbles we had of the rabbit saddle were tasty, as the dish was supple and well-seasoned.  But for this dish, I would have rated Blackbird with one star. Bottom line: expensive and overrated.",0.985,0.851,0.118,0.031,0.5123236331569665

The decor is very sleek, the service is excellent, and the food presentation beautiful and combinations innovative, but unfortunately the actual taste of the food did not live up to the hype/price ($90 for an appetizer, entree, dessert, and iced tea)/Michelin star rating. I had: 1: Appetizer - scallops. Beautifully presented, the scallops were juicy and tender (though small), but this was probably the highlight of the evening. 2: Entree - roasted Alaskan halibut. Very buttery and delicious, but I felt like they could have done more with this dish? All I really tasted was butter, though the fish was quite tender. 3: Dessert - espresso chiffon cake. The fig ice cream that accompanied the cake was superb, but the cake itself was just dry. Once again though, beautifully presented...but oddly enough, had (bitter) green sprouts as garnish? (the sprouts seemed to be a theme, as they showed up in almost everything we ordered) My friend had the scallops, lobster, and white chocolate mousse, and we agreed that the food, while delicious, was not mind-blowingly awesome, and certainly not worth the $90 we each paid. I have only been to one other one star Michelin restaurant (Frances in San Francisco), and unfortunately the taste of Blackbird's food doesn't even come close.

The service was a little slow, although this may just had been the kitchen starting up for the night. Onto the food... I had a bowl of falafel, egg yolk caramel, and white pepper, all mixed together in a smoothly blended soup of garbanzo bean.  Even though the soup had no cream, it was rich in flavor, especially when eaten together with the falafel. For my entree, I had the roasted lobster, laid on top of fried white polenta, braised lobster mushrooms, carrots, and, yes, coffee.  The lobster was cooked perfectly, not chewy like some places like to make it. The coffee added a nice bitter taste to balance the richness of the lobster. All in all, a great entree. For dessert, the four us ordered individually, but did a clockwise rotation of plates until we all had a bite of each of them. First up for me was the dark chocolate-sourdough sponge cake with yogurt panna cotta, sarsaparilla figs and coriander. While this sounds delicious, it was perhaps my least favorite.  The sponge cake was bland and the yogurt panna cotta was a lightweight contender at best. Next, I took a bite of the sweet, soft, valrhona chocolate paired with pistachio pain perdu, buttercream, and candied beets. Every bite of this was a bite of heaven and a sharp contrast to the spongecake. My third bite was of the espresso chiffon with blood orange, honey, and golden turnip ice cream.  The bitterness of the blood orange went well with the espresso chiffon cake and would be something I would try again. Finally, I had a bite of the white chocolate mousse with stewed rhubarb, pine nut granola and saffron. As expected, this was on the sweeter side of things, and had a nice finish to each bite as my taste buds switched from the white chocolate to the rhubarb.

I had high expectations for this restaurant for a company function and even recruited other people to go, however I should have heeded the advice of a friend when he told me that left dinner feeling hungry and went out to eat afterwards. For our meal, it was a set three course menu. The event was held in the upstairs private room which is great considering the restaurant on the first level is small. Our first course was a light salad with a few candied walnuts and very thin slice of fruit. I unfortunately did not take a picture of the menu so I can't recall all of the exquisite ingredients used in my dish. The second main entree was flank steak medallion with small finger length potatos. The flank steaks total weight was likely 2 oz split in between two pieces. For flank steak, the meat was tender, but still difficult to cut through with the provided knife. The flavor was spot on but left you wanting more. For the final course, a beignet x2 with caramel sauce and small helping of ice cream. You could take this all with one bite. The flavors were there but just not enough for the portion. Even though I did not have to pay for this meal, I really think that ""super fine"" dining is likely not for me. I ended up heading out for a late night dinner.

Over all, our meal was fantastic.  The food was fantastic.  The decor was minimal, crisp, clean, and inviting.  The staff was friendly.  Only negative comment I had was, because the space is so small and the location is fairly popular lunch spot, it did tend to get a little cramped and crowded as our meal progressed.  Can't really blame people for flocking their though, it was worth the tight quarters for a really enjoyable lunch.",0.9756,0.727,0.2,0.073,0.6174948240165632

Yes, the ""newest"" addition to the Blackbird/avec family (he had a stint at Blackbird a few years back) returned to back to the nest in 2011, revamping their dessert menu. After Patrick Fahy's departure, many thought that the post-dinner options at Blackbird would falter. But Chef Caron has created such an amazing seasonal dessert menu. I had the opportunity to try the fall seasons menu and it was fantastic. Imagine: a deconstructed sponge cake with raspberries, caraway custard, and a buttermilk ice cream. The cake was so dense and flavorful. The raspberries and custard layered more flavors onto the dessert, and the subtlety of the ice cream balanced the sweetness. The other dessert my fiancee and I had was the chestnut mousse, with persimmons, caramel, and Perigord truffles. The architecture of this dish was amazing, and the taste matched it's visual beauty. Blackbird is definitely on to something. They've got The Man in Paul Kahan, CDC Dave Posey, and the Candy Man, Bryce Caron.

TWICE, because when we told folks we didn't like the place the first time they looked at us like we'd grown extra heads. Trip 1: Condescending server (no, I wasn't drinking that night so I *won't* have the wine pairing), tarragon overload, textural issues. A short rib so tough it stuck in my teeth. (Yes, server, I know what sous vide is; that doesn't change that this went far beyond ""toothsome"" and straight into leathery.) The chickpea soup was to die for and a few other courses on the tasting menu were okay, but we left disappointed and felt like we didn't belong. We enjoy fine dining all over the city and have NEVER felt as disregarded as we did that night at Blackbird.  So we share the review with everyone and decide to give it another chance after everyone insists they were probably having an off night because OH. how they love Blackbird. We decided to try lunch this time.  Trip 2: Inattentive server ignored us entirely after we ordered and we waited...and waited. First course...okay, I don't get the confit baby octopus; I LOVE octopus but the texture of this...eh. Mushy, unpleasant, a little too fishy. The carrot soup, however, was divine. I'll give them this: they know soup. And then we waited. And waited. Aaaaaaaand waited. Finally we broke down to ask: where's our second course? The kitchen lost our ticket. It happens, I get that, and they comped the bill. Great. But the duck legs that arrived were dry dry dry (for confit style? really?), and my herb salad was mostly mint. Not delicious and seriously, a single tiny duck leg? Hardly an entree. Dessert... meh? My husband couldn't figure out how to eat his because the paired flavors all tasted bizarre in a bad way (though the pain perdu was extraordinary) and mine was okay, but overall we left, once again, unhappy. We're done.  Should I not be mad since they comped the meal? I don't know. It took over 90 minutes to have a 3-course lunch and the food wasn't great.

I am very sad that I have to give a 3 star rating to Blackbird :/  Came here for chefs week and did the 5 course tasting for 65 bucks- pretty amazing deal.  I really liked the ambiance and high energy of this restaurant but unfortunately there were many things lacking. After my husband and I were seated, our waiter greets us with the following- ""We would prefer both of you get the tasting instead of just one person bc the timing will be off in ur meals etc....""  Hello... who are you ? Can we get your name... or maybe a Hi Hello How do you do?!  Then he walks away.  It was quite odd.  When he comes back the third time, we have to ask him to give us another menu. Idk,  I found our waiter to be kinda pretentious to be honest.   When our entrees came out, sometimes our waiter presented it with a description but other times it was someone else who had no idea wtf was on our plates.  It was kind of pathetic actually.  Fine, maybe I've just become a food snob who has been spoiled by so many other great places, but I dont know.  I just don't think our meal was worth the $200+ we paid.  I loved the butternut squash soup and the salmon courses, but our lamb course was pretty bland.   Sadly, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone :(",-0.7684,0.73,0.125,0.145,0.6722619047619048
2012-03-22,5.0,"I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT. I had been to Blackbird two other times for dinner and each time, I came away underwhelmed.  Blackbird is talked up so much that I was expecting my mind to be F*@%ing blown.  Don't get me wrong, the food always ended up being amazing, but I never completely understood the genius of the flavor combinations.  That is, until I went back on Tuesday night for Tasting Table's Dinner Tales series at Blackbird. We started out upstairs in the private lounge for some signature cocktails and canapes, which consisted of roasted foie gras (decadent, topped with some nuts), lamb tartare (perfection, I could have eaten that all night long), and sablefish (lightly salted and also topped with some nuts).  Perfect start to the night...little did I know that the night would get exponentially better. After an hour or so, we were led downstairs to the main dining room.  Assigned seating...no problem.  Due to a quirk in the seating arrangement (or the fact that we were a party of three - hello third wheeling with my roommate & her boyfriend!), we were seated next to Tasting Table Chicago's editor as well as with some of Chicago food scene's most reputable and respected food writers.  I was absolutely star-struck...like STAR-STRUCK.  I'm pretty sure my roommate & her boyfriend found  it extremely weird and creepy. Anyhow, the first course was was a grilled sturgeon with braised oxtail, trumpet mushrooms, pickles, dill, and crispy knefla (similar to spaetzle).  It was paired nicely with a 2009 Box Car Chardonnay from Sonoma.  It was definitely my favorite dish of the night...party in my mouth. Second course was roasted guinea hen with a cauliflower-almond puree and fennel-yuzu-jalapeno glaze, paired with a 2007 Rex Hill Reserve Pinot from Willamette Valley.  The hen was PERFECTLY cooked, and I loved the cauliflower-almond puree, even if Paul Kahan said that it was a little older-fashioned and indicative of the type of thing Blackbird was making when it first opened.  Good food is good food, in my mind.  My roommate didn't like the dish as it had a cilantro-y taste to it, but I love cilantro, so yeah. Third course was the most homey and recognizable, even if the flavors weren't crazily inventive - pork belly, knackwurst, & smoked bacon ""charcroute"" (Alsacian sauerkraut) with fingerling potatoes and homemade caraway mustard...an extremely fancy sausage with kraut and mustard, if you will.  The kraut was made of shaved turnips and I loved that there were pieces of dehydrated kraut on top as well.  It was paired with a 2008 Chappellet ""Mountain Cuvee"" Bourdeaux blend from Napa.  It was a lovely wine, but I don't think it paired particularly well with the dish...the dish needed a beer pairing methinks. Finally, dessert was a Chestnut Financier with Camembert cheese, balsamic caramel, and bittersweet chocolate ice cream.  LOVED.  Dark chocolate ice cream with a thin slice of cheese on some chestnut cake?  Chocolate and cheese?  Genius.  It was paired with a 2008 Andrew Rich Gewürztraminer Ice Wine.  Perfect. Dinner was interspersed with Paul Kahan speaking to all of us about the origin of the dishes at Blackbird as well as the history and evolution of the restaurant.  It was really a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and it was made even more memorable due to our table-mates.   I really got a new appreciation of Blackbird.",0.999,0.789,0.195,0.016,0.5906565656565659

Blackbird is not where you go with 4 or more people.  My meal started with the confit of suckling pig and the foie gras.  Both were absurdly good, that kind of good where you just sit back and say ""decadence"" with a smile.  I had the lamb for dinner that was huge on my plate, definitely got my bang for the buck on that one... my boyfriend on the other hand, got a sad little fish on his plate.  We both enjoyed it.  The lamb was tough, but I like my lamb cooked that way and the waiter was nice enough to explain that it takes 12 hours to cook it. My boyfriend's fish was buttery and soft, not flaky.  We ended our meal with cheese, which I don't remember too well because I was so full from the lamb.  This is definitely an enjoyable meal, not a romantic-profess-my-love-so-others-can-hear-you kind of place. I'm only giving it 4 stars because this place is ridiculously small - I hit the guy next to me with my purse on my way to the bathroom and no one deserves that after spending $300 on a meal.",0.9885,0.773,0.173,0.053,0.5759920634920636

We were welcomed with a cocktail hour where we drank expertly mixed drinks and ate lamb tartare, foie gras and sablefish appetizers. When we were seated in the main dining room, Chef explained the origins of each course, none of which are currently on the menu, but all utilizing seasonal ingredients. I was incredibly impressed with the quality pieces of meat and fish in each of these dishes-I mean Paul Kahan owns a butcher shop so its gotta be good! The oxtail preparation and the pork belly were my favorites followed by the foie gras in a close second. Wine pairings were given for each course and each was explained in-depth by the sommelier, who was incredibly knowledgeable. Service was impeccable and friendly.

2012-03-20,3.0,"I'm a big fan of Paul Kahan, but Blackbird falls a bit short of the expectations the rest of his restaurant empire. I've been here now twice for lunch and once for dinner, and maybe it's the fact that I'm used to the value and portions of Avec that is biasing me, but I just don't think the quality I get at Blackbird is worth the premium from his restaurant next-door. The lunch special, if you're planning a cute casual event during the day, is amazing. $25 or so for a 3-course prix fixe lunch? Yes, please. However, even given that this restaurant is typically $$$-$$$$, the portions are inexcusable. When I dine here for lunch, it really feels as if it's the amuse bouche of the meal rather than the actual three courses I'm paying to eat. A tiny watercress salad, a baby octopus confit, and a teaspoon dollop of ice cream hardly justifies a meal. Perhaps I'm just a bit too used to the American diet of quantity over quality? Hardly. I've been affording the opportunity over the past few years to dine at some of the country's/world's best restaurants, and some of them offer a damn compelling lunch special. Jean-Georges in New York (a 3 Michelin Star restaurant) offers an absolutely gut-busting 2-course $32 prix fixe lunch with full-sized entrees (and each additional entree at $16 each); I think the foie gras alone I get at JG weighs the same as my appetizer and entree at Blackbird. Anyway, enough with the berating. Why do I give Blackbird a 3/5 rather than something lower? I still love the food irrespective of price and portion. I've gotten severely spoiled by Avec (among my top casual eateries in Chicago) where I can get absolutely stuffed for the same price I can get my interest piqued at Blackbird. Kahan owns both restaurants, so I'd expect some quality/value parity among the two, but perhaps Avec is just severely underpriced for its quality whereas Blackbird is priced just right. Who knows. Anyway, lunch is a good time to try out some of the top sellers here including the baby octopus confit. Though my octopus was a little rubbery, the taste was out of this world. Octopus seems to be the perfect vehicle for a soft confit with an acidic dressing. If it were cooked perfectly, it may have been one of my top dishes in Chicago. For dinner, expect to pay $$$+. It's fair to say that I would come here pretty often if I weren't a lowly PhD student on a stipend. Until then, however, I have to double-check my wallet to see if I can afford another splurge or not. The ambiance at Blackbird for dinner is less intimate than, say, Alinea, but it has this cheery character to it that is great during a rainy night. I highly recommend eating here for dinner if you need to just get out for an intimate dinner one night.  ***TL;DR. Kahan is amazing. Avec is on par with quality of Blackbird. Lunch prix fixe is underwhelming. Dinner and atmosphere is tres chiq.",0.9984,0.77,0.195,0.034,0.52460532375426

We expected the food to be creative and delicious. Unfortunately, we were let down. Boka kinda sucked, to be honest. The good news is that Blackbird is everything we wanted Boka to be.  We went for an early dinner on Saturday to celebrate his birthday. I got the Painted Lady, which was frothy and tangy. He got the Blackbird Orange and he enjoyed that. A waiter brought out an amuse-bouche of fennel custard with macadamia nuts. ""It tastes like Cooler Ranch Doritos,"" said Adam R. And, well, it did. We ordered three appetizers: the veal sweetbreads, ahi tuna, and octopus. The veal was delicious! I wasn't sure what to expect based on the name of the dish, but I really enjoyed the crispy coating and the spongey interior. It came with Chinese mustard and these impossibly crisp bunches of kale. So fun to eat! The ahi tuna was his favorite, with savory streusel and truffles. I didn't like the bitter oranges in the dish-- overpowering, in my opinion. The octopus was our least favorite because on its own, it was a tad fishy. But with the fennel, chestnut, and lime, I could appreciate the flavors in the dish.  For my main course, I had the pork shoulder and I loved it. It had a light, slightly sweet glaze and was fork-tender. I loved the burnt leeks and sunchokes it was served with, but didn't care for the bitter kumquats... again, it had that bitter citrus peel taste that my tongue just can't get over. Besides the kumquats, it was a totally modern interpretation of a very hearty, comforting dish. He got the lobster and it was just as tasty as my pork. It meshed unexpectingly well with the coffee flavor.  Compared to our appetizers and main courses, dessert was pretty meh. We tried the espresso sponge cake. It was fine, but not noteworthy.

LUNCH (Monday 1130am): $22 prix fixe lunch is pretty standard.  The salad is enormous for an appetizer.  I followed with the sturgeon, was okay.  The garnish of buttered cabbage was delicious.  Espresso cake with turnip ice cream was interesting.  Eaten together it was good--turnip ice cream alone was a bit strange.  They serve little glass bottles of Coke (warning if you were expecting to get unlimited soda). meter parking: $3.50/hr.

I swear too much and drink too much and am not of the ""fine dining set"" - nor will I probably ever be unless I marry a Doctor/Lawyer and wipe my butt with hundred dollar bills. And this fact was more than a little bit apparent when my friend and I went there for Restaurant Week. Blackbird had been on both our ""lists"" for a while because it's a pain in the ass to get to (who the fuck actually lives over by Randolph and whatever?), and it's expensive and again, I am not their ideal clientele. But Restaurant Week seemed like a cool time to go because it features a cheap menu and I knew I wouldn't be the only weirdo off the street eating there. Blackbird is a SLICK restaurant. And maybe slick isn't the best word, but it's very clean and streamlined and everything is white and stainless steel and even though all the tables are all but right on top of each other, you manage to feel kind of like you're in a private jet or something while you're there. And then there's the service staff, who kind of glide around, replacing your silverware and swapping out plates with this kind of perfect quiet that I would never in a million years be able to replicate. Their questions are smooth, they know their shit, and you get the sense that MAYBE they're judging you a little bit but they're so good, that you can't be certain about it. And then there's the food.

2012-02-24,4.0,"4.4 Went to Blackbird for lunch during the $22 restaurant week special.  I feel like every magazine I pick up these days just raves about this place so I was super excited to check it out.   First impression, the space is super cool.  They have this very cool piece of art on one of the walls, I wish I had asked who it was by.  Annywayyys, the food was really excellent, although I think I allowed myself to get so hyped up by the reviews that I was a teensy bit disappointing.   One thing to mention off the bat: their portions are beautiful but small.  I know if I had taken my bear-of-an-eater boyfriend, he would have been pissed.  Maybe stick to girls night out on this one.  All of the food was so complex and interesting, and I didn't feel like I needed a three hour nap after I was done.   I started out with the potato soup with candied sunflower seeds, dehydrated beet, and seared trout belly.  The sunflower seeds added a perfect crunch, and the beet added a pop of flavor.  The potato soup itself didn't have quite enough salt for my liking, but the quality of the ingredients stood up on their own.  My friend was a little more adventurous than me and got the confit baby octopus with fennel, chestnuts, finger lime and chili.  This was EXCELLENT.  I didn't realize until that moment that it wasn't that I didn't like octopus, I just didn't like rubbery octopus.  This had a melt-in-your-mouth quality that I had never experienced with octopus before.  It wasn't quite as soft but I would almost compare the texture liver.  Next up was the wood-grilled salmon with chanterelles, kohirabi, apple, thai poppy jam and brown butter fish sauce.  The fish was cooked exquisitely, and had a nice almost caramelized crust on top that was really great.  In general I found the dish just a little bit bland.  The mini chanterelles were cute but didn't have as much of an earthy flavor as I'm used to.  Maybe more of a variety of veggies or a sauce would have done the trick. Lastly I had the bittersweet chocolate cremeux sweet potato, hazelnuts and ginger.  I have to preface this with a disturbing fact: I am not much of a dessert person.  I know, it's weird.  For me, the flavors were excellent but the dense texture was a weird combination.   The service was very nice and I felt there was always someone available to help but nobody was hovering.",0.9971,0.761,0.197,0.042,0.6674546485260769
2012-02-24,4.0,"Take advantage of the $22 lunch for Restaurant Week, it's a great way to taste 3 items off the menu for a decent price. First off, if you're a sucker for presentation (like me) you're going to love this place no matter what the food tastes like. Beautifully plated with bright colors never hurt anyone willing to pay astronomical prices for small portions. I began with the baby octopus salad, my fiance w/ a potato soup. Mine was delicious, lightly smoky and perfectly cooked. My fiance didn't complain about the soup, because I didn't even get a taste! For our entree course, I got the salmon, which was cooked just the way I like it, just a little bit raw in the middle. It was quite small, but for lunch...it was an appropriate portion. The compliment of flavors was nice. Sour apple cubes and the salmon itself sat on a creamy sauce...with steamed greens, which are always my favorite. My fiance got the duck confit, which was the disappointment of the meal. It actually wasn't confit at all, it was basically a piece of deep fried duck. And, if it's possible with duck...it was dry. However, presentation still was nice. Dessert was heavenly. I had a pear something...which was my idea of a dessert. Small and sweet. My fiance had the chocolate mousse, which again, was gobbled down before I could taste. That means two thumbs up.  My main complaint about this restaurant is it's ALWAYS crowded. And the seating is quite communal so if you're going on a romantic date, think twice unless you want your neighbors to hear your entire conversation.",0.9907,0.779,0.184,0.037,0.5835988085988085

However, it wasn't all that I expected it to be, based on reviews that I had heard from family & friends. We split an ahi tuna appetizer that wasn't my favorite, I felt that it was a little bit over-cooked. I had the duck as my entree, which was delicious but very fatty (to be expected for duck, I guess) and a desert that was just ok.

We had heard that the portion sizes were a bit to be desired but since we got the tasting menu, we were fine.  And  everything was fantastic!  We started off with cocktails, me the Luna Sea and my husband something with scotch. Mine was very tasty, not too sweet but flavorful with the plum. My husband definitely liked his since he got two.  The first thing was an amuse-bouche, which was yummy but can't remember what it was. Then we had bay scallops, perfectly seared and rich on the inside. Then came the butternut squash soup. The char added a hint of smokiness while the roe a bit of sea saltiness. A strange combination overall.  Our entrees came next. First was the ahi tuna with mushrooms and some chickpea mash. The tuna was unbelievably smooth and rich, loved the mushrooms. The chickpea thing was totally amazing though! Probably our favorite part of the meal actually. It was sweet and nutty at first but then ended with a hint of spice. The bar was crispy on the outside and creamy like polenta on the inside. Wonderful!  After that came the pork shoulder with leeks and kumquats.  The pork was really good with the sauce and the kumquat gave the dish a unique turn with a burst of bitter citrus. Before dessert, we were given a goat cheese sorbet to cleanse our palate. I adore goat cheese in sorbets and ice creams. It gives it such a rich but not too sweet sensation.  The dessert was the espresso spongecake with blood orange and turnip ice cream. The spongecake was the epitome of spongey and the espresso flavor was well balanced with the ice cream. Overall, a really great meal!  The service was excellent also!  Our waitress was patient, well spoken and not at all snooty.  She seems like she really enjoyed the food, the people there and serving us.  I'd highly suggest Blackbird!",0.9983,0.726,0.237,0.037,0.5710294117647059

The food was absolutely delicious. After reading several yelp reviews about the smaller portions, we decided to both get our own appetizers (and im glad we did because the portions were small). We started with the veal sweetbreads and baby octopus. They were both delicious but I would strongly recommend getting the sweetbreads. AMAZING. The boy got the rabbit and loved it. I had a few bites and was surprised at how good it was. However, I don't think it was better than pork shoulder that I got. The pork literally melted in my mouth and was so tender. I could have eaten it with a spoon.  So after all of this.. why 4 stars and not 5? The desserts -- after all of the pastry and dessert awards the chef has won, we were both expecting to be blown away by the desserts but both thought it was the most lack-luster part of the evening.

For my entree I had the pork, and my husband had the lamb belly. The pork was tender, juicy, and very tasty. The kumquats and sunchokes were a lovely accompaniment as well.

(i was trying to be adventurous since this restaurant has a good reputation.) i did really like the sweetness of the pear chunks with it though. i got to try some duck leg confit over the tastiest beans that looked lightly tossed in cream sauce. the beans were the best part. for dessert, i got to try my friend's dessert which was an assortment of creams and goos and sauces and two little pieces of cake. there was something resembling a semifreddo, which was the best part. the other goos were nice too but one tasted just like jello liquid and that was a big turnoff. my own dessert was a chocolate cremeaux, which was very decadent and smooth and creamy. the only thing about it was the it was smeared on the plate in that fancy way some restaurants do and it looked like poop. overall, a really good experience. i would definitely come back to get the prix fixe again, just because it's so fun or i'd love to even try some of their sandwiches. since the entrees were the least exciting part of the meal, i'd be hesitant to come back for dinner. but still, very very yummy.",0.995,0.77,0.187,0.044,0.5225438596491229

I came to Blackbird wanting to plan a special night with my boo. We still had a great night, but I'm not so sure Blackbird had much, if anything to do with that. The ambiance at Blackbird is top notch. I loved that they didn't cram us into a small space. Too many trendy restaurants try to increase their profits by stacking people on top of each other, or worse, forcing you to eat at the same table as strangers thanks to ""communal eating"" design. Blackbird realizes that the dining experience isn't just the food, it's also the entire environment, and they've crafted a very comfortable, intimate dining room. Service is also impeccable, friendly and knowledgeable.  Foodwise, I have no complaints. Everything we tried was excellent, but nothing--aside from the butternut squash soup--really knocked us off our feet. While the dishes obviously require a high degree of proficiency, there was no dish that had me thinking I need to come back to Blackbird for a second visit. Portion sizes are also on the small side, so do yourself a favor and don't come hungry. We ended up stopping at a Wendy's on the way home and that was after having appetizers, a main course each, and a desert and cheese plate.  Blackbird is OK in my book.

So for a $30 entrée they gave me a plate of sautéed chanterelle mushrooms with huge pieces of fried nori. The nori was awkward to eat, it tasted good, but smaller pieces would have been great. My dish desperately needed fat and maybe some salt too - poached egg would have done the trick.

2012-01-02,4.0,"On weekdays Michelin Star restaurant Blackbird offers an amazing lunch deal; a three course prix fixe for just $22. While the portions are on the small size, it is a reasonable amount of food for lunch (just be sure not to come starving). The complexity of the ingredients and the artistic presentation definitely are indicative of a Michelin star venue despite the bargain price. There are only two choices for each course, so picky eaters may not be able to take advantage of the prix fixe, but there is also an al la carte menu with several more offerings (albeit at a higher price). There is no amuse bouche, but a couple slices of tasty bread were served soon after we were seated (though no offer was made to replenish our plates once we consumed the bread).  Blackbird features modern decor and like many of Chicago's fine dining establishments it is on the smallish side. There is seating for roughly 56, so tables are spaced close together, but I did not find the venue to be noisy. There is valet parking available but I found ample free parking just north on Lake Street. The dress was quite casual at lunchtime, the vast majority of patrons wore jeans.  There is an open kitchen and I enjoyed stealing glances of the chefs working their magic periodically. As each dish is rather complex and a small kitchen is feeding fifty plus people, the pace of the meal is slow (our three course lunch took roughly an hour and a half), but it is a pleasant atmosphere for a leisurely meal. Service is extremely polished and attentive, but unfortunately our sever did not exhibit much in the way of personality and was all business.  Blackbird is known for unusual flavor combinations and savory dishes often have a sweet component, similar to Schwa - but in a much more refined environment. For the first course I opted for the confit baby octopus; the presentation was nice and it was enjoyable but lacked a wow factor. The best octopus I have had is by far the one served at MK. My wife went for the soup of the day; a Jerusalem artichoke based soup with a small piece of fish and this was by far the superior choice.  I ordered the pekin duck confit for my main which again was tastefully presented and was good, but nothing special. The portion of duck seemed more of what I would expect from an appetizer. My wife's wood grilled sturgeon was similar in terms of presentation, taste and portion.  Dessert was definitely highlight of the meal. I had an espresso sponge cake with honey turnip ice cream and blood orange wedges. This dish looked beautiful and tasted even better. The turnip ice cream was exquisite. This dish I would definitely order again. My wife's bittersweet chocolate mouse with candied cashews and butternut squash was also her favorite part of the meal.  While I have to admit I was expecting a bit more from Blackbird based on the Michelin star status and stellar reputation, for $22 this was undeniably a great deal despite not being quite as good as I had envisioned. My lunch (other than dessert) was just missing that wow factor I have experienced at other equal caliber restaurants in Chicago and I longed for our server to display more personality. If I were to return to Blackbird for dinner, I would definitely expect a significantly better experience or I would be disappointed, but for a $22 lunch it was well worth a trip.",0.9982,0.783,0.174,0.043,0.598638668430335

Being in the middle of December, I thought it would be cold right there, however they had mini vent which made it cozy and comfortable. I came in hungry, knowing I would want to take advantage of as many tastes as I possibly could. Looking in detail through the menu, I wanted to try everything.   After a bit of indecisiveness, we both started off with the Blackbird Orange cocktail. For my appetizer, I had the salad of endives with crispy potatoes, basil, dijon, pancetta and poached egg. She had the Smoked Wagyu Tartare and Crispy Braised Beef tongue with radish, black garlic and yogurt. We both split the foie gras. For the main course she ordered the Aged Pekin Duck Breast with fuyu persimmon, red wine braised radishes, black beans and sesame. My selection was the Roasted Leg of Lamb with maitake mushrooms, grapes, hearts of palm, vivalia onion jam and burnt cinnamon. They were both top notch, the presentation was amazing and the taste was even better. Being from Texas, I have to admit that the portions seemed to be small, however it ended up being just right, appetite and hungry satisfied.

2011-12-16,3.0,"So, I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday on a Thursday evening.  The food is probably closer to a 4 star rating, but the service is really what knocked my rating down a notch.   I'll start with the service, since that is my main beef.  First, I clearly noted in the Open Table reservation notes that it was my girlfriend's birthday.  There was NO acknowledgement, no dessert with a birthday candle, nothing.  I mean, yes, I realize it's kind of cheesy, but 95% of high end restaurants in Chicago will do that sort of thing.  Strike one.  When ordering entrees/appetizers, I asked the waiter (possibly also the manager, since he said he picked the champagnes on the menu) if I could order a half size portion of the sweet potato gnocchi as an appetizer.  He gave me a look as if I was from another planet.  This is not that novel of a concept and plenty of high end restaurants do it.  You simply put less pasta on the plate.  Regardless, we ordered a WHOLE and they split it for us as an additional appetizer.  Strike 3, I finished my cocktail and it stayed empty a long time.  I know there aren't 4 strikes, but this is my review, so here's strike 4, the table next to us received truffles with their check and we didn't receive any.  I must note that I'm not a person who goes out of his way to b*tch about service at restaurants and I was never rude in the slightest all evening, but when I'm paying $200+ for a dinner out, I expect a little better personal attention.  I mean, come on. The food:  The food overall was a redeeming quality.  My girlfriend had the butternut Squash soup and I had the wagyu beef / beef tongue to start.  Both were delicious. Next, we followed with a split of the sweet potato gnocchi.  Very good, but the seaweed was a little bit of an odd accompaniment.  It added a strange fishiness to a delicious dish.  For entrees, she had the cod, which she enjoyed, and I had the pork rib.  I must say, I was a little disappointed in the pork rib.  I expected this to be a slam dunk coming from Paul Kahan, since he is the master of all things pork, but it was kind of dry.  When it came out, cooked white as can be, I couldn't help but think of the, ""pork, the other white meat"" commercials.  If I would have known it would be like a dry piece of chicken, I would have ordered something else.  Overall, the flavor was good, but I think it is a cardinal sin to dry out a piece of meat. Drinks:  The cocktail, the pear tree, was awesome.  It was delicious and I already had a buzz after drinking just one.  The pinot noir by the glass was a nice selection, the champagne was good that my gf chose, as was the tawny I had with dessert.   So, that's my rant about blackbird.  The food is a thumbs up, the service needs help.  There are plenty of other excellent restaurants in this city and I will not be rushing back.",0.9885,0.786,0.132,0.082,0.5109708049886622

2011-12-01,2.0,"I was overall let down by my experience here.  I wish I could give a separate rating for the food and the service, because the server is what really ruined it.   We went on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, it was just 2 of us, and we had a later reservation at 8pm. We were there just before 8, and were seated at one of the tables along the wall, and I have to say I am just not really a fan of dining rooms laid out in this fashion, I always find it hard to hear whoever I am dining with across the table over the people at the tables on either side, and both tables next to us were on the louder side when we sat down, thankfully they were replaced by quieter people shortly after.  I am not sure what our servers name was, I can't recall him saying. He looked a lot like a Ken doll, and I must say he seems to have been hired on looks alone, because he was not a very good server.....I work in the industry too, I expected much better at Blackbird.  First off, the hostess gave us lunch menus instead of dinner, and did not give us a prix fixe menu, so we were looking for the wrong menu for a good ten minutes, before I got a staff members attention and got us the right menu. By the time our waiter finally got to our table we had picked out a bottle of champagne, which it then took him 20 minutes to find. When he finally got back with the champagne I had to ask about the prix fixe menu before we received one. We both ordered the 7 course tasting menu, paired with wine. By the time we finally got our champagne it was like 8:25, by the time we finally got our amuse it was 8:40. The four top that sat down next to us about 30 minutes or so after we did had their amuse 5 minutes after we got ours, they had a different server though.  He brought all of the pairings of wine to the table what seemed a long time before the course they went with, a lot of the wine had gotten fairly warm by the time the food arrived.  Overall the waiter was nice enough, though not very attentive or timely. For what seemed like a slower night, with what seemed like a lot of people working in the front of the house for such a small dining room I think our meal and our wines could have come out more in sync. Which I think was just a matter of poor timing on the servers part, not firing our next courses soon enough. Which is something a good server should know how to do.  Also about halfway through our meal the music in the dining room went from sort of quieter background type music to playing Roxanne by the Police, which while not a bad song was really out of place. Didn't really care that much for the dining room overall.  On the bright side of this whole experience the food was fantastic. The kitchen did a great job. All of the food came out hot and cooked perfectly. Every course was delicious. Especially the confit of suckling pig and the smoked waygu tartar. Thankfully it was someone Else's job, and not our server's, to see that our food made it from the window to our table, or I am sure it would have been as cold as our wine was warm by the time he got around to bringing it to our table.  It didn't make up for the poor service though, but it is the reason I gave my review 2 stars instead of 1.  I don't know if I will ever go back there, I don't think it was worth the money, especially when I left still hungry after 7 courses.",0.9472,0.89,0.075,0.035,0.49632248443723864

Selected the chilled kohlrabi with sturgeon belly, hibiscus gellee and grapefruit as a first course.  A tasty few bites, with the grapefruit flavors and gellee really highlighting the dish for excellent contrast.  The sturgeon belly was underwhelming in size, and par in taste.  Beautiful presentation. Selected the roasted chicken and sausage with lime onions, tamarind, and smoked cucumbers as second course.  Chicken was roasted nicely, as was the sausage, but nothing phenomenal to write home about.  The smoked cucumbers were innovative and tasty.  Beautiful presentation. Selected vanilla parfait with blackberries, saffron honey, and milk  meringue as dessert.  Very tasty smooth parfait with perfectly fresh blackberries.  The saffron honey added a very nice element to the dish as did the intriguingly light and flavorful meringue.  Beautiful presentation.  (Are we sensing a trend here?) Verdict:  With all the hype around Blackbird, I think I may have set my expectations too high.  The food quality certainly was high, the presentation was gorgeous, the portions a little bit wanting.  The preparation of the food was good, but I was not blown away.  It may be the dishes I chose, or it may be the lunch option just isn't comparable to the dinner.  I would look at potentially going back, but I'm not entirely convinced yet that the flavor of the food matches up with the ambiance and environment they are trying to present.  Why four stars then?  For $22 for three high quality beautiful courses, it's definitely a great deal.",0.9965,0.789,0.201,0.01,0.6290482556659027

Elaborate, dramatic presentations, but short of flavor and texture. It really felt like a restaurant resting on past achievements. Really hard to believe this place got a Michelin star when there are so many better restaurants in town.  A few specifics... Server gave same exact script to every table around us and projected a sort of pretentious aire, like we should be thrilled to be there and were in for an amazing experience.

Foie Gras / Ahi: Really just ok. Halibut: Meh Pork: Good, but 2 enormous chunks of fat  Lamb: Also good, but again with lots of fat and inedible gristle. Sorbet: Good Chocolate mouse: Comparable to Julius Meinl (local cafe) but good Some kind of sorbet with sesame: Tasted like peanuts and my wife's tongue swelled up and her lips went numb. Nothing stood out. Nothing I would crave or want to have again. Every dish just didn't have a payoff.  Service was off from start to finish.  Opening Line: ""This is our complete menu for the evening. There are no specials."" No drink offer for first 15 minutes. Same exact script to every table around us. Going through the motions. Ended badly with my wife having an allergic reaction to a dessert despite numerous warnings about it. That changed our experience (woud have been 3 stars), especially since the server blew us off.

2011-09-23,4.0,"Coming to Blackbird was an experience that I wasn't prepared for. First if all, I'm from LA. Second, I've been eating what my mommy cooks for me since the day I was born. So what does this mean? That I'm not the greatest judge when it comes to food that is not... ordinary.  With that thought in mind, my boyfriend and I walked into this place which is located right next to its sister restaurant, Avec, on Randolph. I came here thinking I'd have a similar experience as in Avec. How wrong was I? You walk in to an equally bustling restaurant. But it's white and bright. The decor is extremely minimalistic and clean with white everywhere with spots of beautiful yellow flowers on each table. We were a bit early for our reservation, so we went to the bar and ordered a bottle of wine.  Bar tender was friendly, extremely helpful, honest, and kind. He didn't suggest the most expensive item on the menu by any means and explained each dish with precision and helped us pick a wine that we didn't know how to pronounce. Im addition, the prices weren't as ridiculous as I expected it to be for a trendy restaurant.  Mind you, this place is not quiet. We were seated and you sit close to the people next to you as in Avec. This part I wasn't such a fan of. You're either in the family style dining, or you're in the formal dining setting where yo can enjoy your date and high end food. We ordered the elk because it seemed to be the most popular, and I got the duck.  Both were cooked extremely well. The elk wasn't gamey at all and the duck was succulent. Again, I'm not used to this new type of food. As much as everything was prepared perfectly, I don't think my palate is quite used to such experimental food. Having sweet sesame and a lighter cream with chickpeas with my duck didn't feel like enough flavor, but I had one of the best experiences here in terms of service and experience.

You see, we originally planned to eat at the Girl and the Goat, but they couldn't accommodate increasing our reservation from two people to three, and so we had to cancel our dinner there -- trading in Stephanie Izard for Paul Kahan.  (Sorry, Stephanie - next trip!)  Now, keep in mind that Lynn and I had dined at Kahan's newest restaurant, Publican, the night before, and we enjoyed that so much, the bar was pretty high . . . as was the concern that it might not have met our expectations. Instead, I should have remembered the motto of one Alfred E. Newman:  ""What, me worry?"" In other words, dinner was GREAT! We met Ginny at the restaurant . . . sort of.  We were about half an hour early for dinner, and went next door to Kahan's *other* restaurant, Avec, for a glass of wine and to catch up -- after all, we hadn't seen Ginny since last week's conference in Vegas.  At 9:00 pm exactly (7:00 for us Californians), our table was ready and we were seated . . .  BTW, the waitress at Avec told us to go ahead and sit down; she'd bring us our check -- which she did.  Much easier than having to wait; and very nice, too. After having so much pork in the last few days, Lynn and I were definitely ready for some lighter fare.  She opted for the chilled cantaloupe and buttermilk soup with paddlefish caviar, candied sourdough, ginger and anise hyssop -- fresh, bright, and flavorful -- while Ginny and I both had the salad of endives with crispy potatoes, basil, dijon, pancetta and poached egg (yeah, yeah, I know -- pancetta IS pork, but still . . . it was soooooo good!). Ginny had the roasted farm chicken and blue prawns with quinoa, grilled snap peas and mish mish (?) -- sweet, succulent and surprisingly sumptuous.  Lynn dove into the roast lobster with lobster and maitaki mushrooms (OMG).  Meanwhile, although -- I admit -- I was momentarily tempted by the elk poached in duck fat (?!?!?!) . . . I sighed and instead ordered the wood-grilled sturgeon with chanterelles, kohlrabi, plums, thai poppy jam and brown butter-fish sauce -- oh so delicious!  and the 2008 Vincent Dureuil-Janthial Puligny-Montrachet ""Champs Gains"" paired beautifully with all three entrées. For dessert, Ginny had a selection of five cheeses -- Shadow Brook Farms ""Chevre Frais,"" goat's milk (Lincoln, Nebraska) with bing cherries; Nettle Meadows ""Kunik,"" goat's milk (Warrensburg, New York) with mustard genois; Green Dirt Farm ""Bossa,"" sheep's milk (Kansas City, Missouri) with hazelnuts' Cobb Hill ""Ascutney mountain"" cheese, raw cow milk (Hartland, Vermont) with blueberries; and the ""St. Agur"" cow milk (Auvergne, France) with apricots -- paired with a half-glass of Pouilly-Fumé (for the goat cheese) and a half-glass of Côtes-du-Rhône (for the rest).  Lynn had the frozen cucumber mousse with musk melon, peanut meringue and lime ice -- brilliant! -- while I chose the raspberry sorbet (so intense, so smooth, so flavorful, and still bright and fresh).

The dessert menu was so different that we almost passed on it, but when we tasted the milk chocolate mousse with grilled corn and silk, frozen peaches and mesqite we couldn't argue that corn should stay in the savory catagory.

The appetizers were delicious, soup and salad but a fresh take with octopus and fresh broccoli cream and our entrees were excellent as well. I feel that they really take the traditional sounding dishes (i.e. roast chicken, grilled fish) and make it pretty spectacular. They actually did my chicken breast stuffed and wrapped in a PERFECT crispy chicken skin but in a round presentation so it looked nothing like roast chicken. The presentation was fun, the food was good and the dessert was delicious despite that it was chocolate and I am not a huge fan. Good portions for lunch (I was pretty full by the end) and they have an interesting cocktail list.

All the dishes are very innovative, exotic, and sophisticated, there are many ingredients and flavors in the dishes that i haven't even heard or tasted before The spiced veal sweetbreads was light and crispy on the outside and extremely tender and juicy on the inside, one bite and I'm in heaven. the plate also had apricots, nori-peanuts and chickweed, each ingredients were tasty and brought a different dimension to the dish when eaten together. The other favorite is the main dish - roasted leg of lamb, I'm so glad i got it. The lamb was very juicy and tender, with the right combination of meat and fat. the onion jam really made this dish, the marriage of the sweet onion sauce with the savory lamb leg is so delicious. The dish also came with mushrooms, cherries, hearts of palm which were all really tasty and refreshing without ever overpowering the main ingredient some of the other apps I liked are the suckling pig and beef tartar, but i wasn't a huge fan of the desserts overall, amazing service and even more amazing food this makes me want to move to chicago, sigh maybe someday!",0.9968,0.759,0.241,0.0,0.6284126984126984
2011-08-17,5.0,"Maybe its because I'm a vampire that I don't find lunch time dates or daytime restaurant lighting very sexy--but Blackbird has officially changed my mind. I've heard and read all the rants and raves about this West Loop eatery from, ""It's the Baby Jesus of restaurants,""  to,  ""It's aggressively overrated,"" so I really didn't know what to expect. However, from the moment I walked in, I was sold. Oozing with sexiness, exceptional cuisine and punctuated by sleek, minimalist decor and a hot staff, Blackbird is tha bizniss. My Favorite Foodie Friend and I strolled into a packed Blackbird on a Wednesday  afternoon and were immediately seated. Our handsome and gracious server greeted us, delivered the menu run-down and had our mouths watering something fierce. We decided champagne would quell our hunger momentarily so the sommelier recommended the Pierre Gimmonet Grand Cru Blanc de Blanc--and what a wonderful recommendation it was! As we sipped our bubbles, caught up on life and perused the menu, we made our decisions--and what awesome decisions we made. For our first appetizer we split the salad of endives with crispy potatoes, basil, dijon, pancetta and poached egg. Absolutely savory and subtle, yet containing several layers of intense flavors. Next up, was the butternut squash soup with trout. I initially ordered mine without the fish but upon seeing and tasting my FFF's soup with it, I asked our server if he could add it to mine. He did so graciously and I then proceeded to devour one of the most piquant butternut squash soups I've ever had in LIFE. A mind-blowing combination of explosive flavor and texture.  The crispy duck confit and country sausage with cauliflower, maitake mushrooms, grapes and kaffir lime was my choice for an entree--and what a smart choice it was. The duck was tender  and seasoned to perfection and the intensity, variety and dimensions of flavor of the garnishes had me swooning as if LL just walked in the room. My  FFF was winning the smart-entree choice game too with the woodgrilled sturgeon with chanterelles, kohlrabi, plums, thai poppy jam and brown butter fish sauce. Absolutely delectable.  By this time, I really had no more room in my stomach but FFF insisted I order the bittersweet chocolate gateau with goat's milk, cola nut, fresno and cherry sorbet for dessert. Being the chocolate whore I am, I was super satisfied with this choice. Since the lunch rush was winding down, we got a chance to chop it up with the chefs and watch them do their thang. Very cool and friendly guys who invited us to come back at any time. From start to finish, this experience was simply outstanding.  Blackbird, with its mind-blowing flavors, exquisite plating, extraordinary service and daytime sex appeal has earned a place as one of my top five favorite restaurants in Chicago.",0.996,0.821,0.149,0.03,0.6257641723356008
2011-08-16,5.0,"***Blackbird's upscale lunch might feature portions that veer on the dainty side, but my entree and dessert were both delicious and among the best I had in Chicago*** Despite Blackbird's strong reputation (a Michelin star, James Beard award nominations), I had heard some negative criticism that caused me some concern.  After visiting Blackbird for lunch, there were definitely some things you could nitpick about it.  The portions were a little dainty.  And the decor seemed a little outdated as well.  The room was very minimalist and too modern with lots of white, modern chairs and sharp angles throughout the room.  It felt like the kind of dining room that would have been trendy 10 years ago. The food at Blackbird was very good though.  It showcased everything you would want in an upscale restaurant--high quality ingredients at peak form that are cooked with skill and feature both satisfying flavor combinations and nice presentations. The bread at Blackbird was standard stuff, but it was still a good and hearty multigrain bread (served with butter). My lunch entree at Blackbird was a grilled lamb tenderloin that was served with maitake mushrooms, cherries, vidalia onion jam, and burnt cinnamon.  The lamb was cooked between rare and medium rare and it was very good.  It had a great flavor and was very moist and tender. The sides were great.  I like cherries and mushrooms and they were both excellent here.  The dish was very flavorful.  It may have been a little one dimensional with mostly just one flavor (sweet).  But when the ingredients are this good and the food is cooked this nicely, it is hard to complain. My dessert was also very good.  It was a banana pain perdu (French toast).  The pain perdu had a great and moist banana nut bread-like center as well as a crispy outside.  The garnishes were great too.  There was a nice cream as well as a good butterscotch.  There was also some bourbon ice cream, which was dense and creamy (it also had a great burn to it).  All the flavors went very well together. Service was good and efficient (as plates came out quickly).  The staff was also pleasant.  They do pretty good business at lunch so you might want to make reservations (seating is available inside via tables or bar seating; there are also tables on their outdoor patio; the patio faces the street). Prices were reasonable given that this was an upscale lunch.  They feature sandwiches as well as entrees and everything was about $15 and below.  The portions were a little on the small side so you might want to order a starter, but those only go for an extra $10-$12. I am a big fan of an upscale lunch with flavorful (but not overly heavy) food and Blackbird does it very well.  Their lunch reminded me of Spruce in San Francisco, which was one of the most satisfying meals I've had in the Bay Area.  That puts Blackbird in good company and it is one I will definitely go back to for lunch if I find myself in Chicago again. I am not sure what the parking situation is.  I believe they have valet.  Also, Blackbird does not seem to be in the most congested part of Chicago so you should be able to find street parking.",0.9992,0.723,0.237,0.039,0.5852861952861954

My lovely date today suggested that we go to Blackbird, since it is close to both of our offices in the West Loop. He made reservations for us at 11:45 and we were off to the races. The ambiance is wonderful. Very understated and classy, with an uber-professional staff. Our water glasses were never less than half full, they didn't intrude on our typical first date conversation, and the food was delicious. I ordered the Pork Belly sandwich because my handsome date had mentioned that he had heard good things about it, and he ordered the Short Rib Burger. We went halfsies on the sandwiches, because both were out of this world. Seriously delectable. The garlic frites and cucumber salad were a nice touch as sides for the entrees.

It was definitely inventive and creative but I cant say much for flavour and taste. I truly enjoyed the pea soup and the veal tenderloin. But the pork and the sepia salad left me cold. I had the ganache for dessert- its not a real ganache, so beware. The chocolate was way too much for me but the lovage ice cream and grated cheese was delicious.

The waiter has to pull out your table in order to be seated, the tables are merely inches from each other. The decor isn't too fancy, the bar only sits a few people and you wouldn't want to come to this place if you plan on discussing anything private with your dinner companion. This is definitely not a place for large groups. Me and my date originally came to the area to visit Avec, but it was close. Blackbird surprisingly didn't have a wait so we decided to give it a try As for the food, it was nothing special. I order the foie gras appetizer, which was a thin measly slice of which only half was actually edible. Definitely not worth the $25 paid. For entrees my companion order the lamb saddle and I had the duck. The flavor was extremely lacking and the portions were minuscule. You gotta have either one or the other! It took a long time for our bill to come. Overall, I expected to experience at least one aspect that would blow me away at Blackbird. The service wasn't great, the food was bland and the environment was tight and suffocating. It wasn't horrible, but not worth the price I paid.

Unfortunately, I have to say that regardless of the hype and the great previous yelp reviews, Blackbird was really disappointing! The space is quite modern and cool and there was great lighting (which is always key to me when dining), but everything else felt way too pretentious. To start, our server pretty much ignored us for the first 15 minutes. I got the impression that she felt like she should be dining there, rather than serving. When we finally got her attention, we ordered a bottle of wine and I started with the wagyu tartar. It was alright, but nothing I would write home about.  For the main, I had the roasted farm chicken and sausage, and my mom had the halibut with fava beans and rhubarb. I understand that they've been nominated for the James Beard award, and I believe they have a Michelin star, but even so, the presentation was so ridiculous! All my food was perched on the far left corner of my bowl, with an artful swish of something (cauliflower puree I was told by my server with distain) and the applewood broth poured into the bowl. I think they were going for avant garde, but it looked like it was trying to hard. Half way through eating my dinner they realized that the sausage hadn't been included so it was brought over on the side. All in all, it felt like a lot of pomp and smoke for a dish that was good but not great. Likewise for the halibut.  All in all, I'd say their reputation has gone to their head at Blackbird, and it was too bad that we ended the trip with a bit of a let down, not like our previous dinners at Publican or Cafe Spiaggia.

2011-06-08,5.0,"I have lived in Chicago for 3 years and always wanted to go to Blackbird, but I had so many other restaurants to try that I just hadn't gotten around to it. Oh my gosh, why did I wait so long?!?!? Went here for lunch with two co-workers this week and everything was just perfect.  We shared the wagyu tartare. I've had beef tartare a couple of times before, though granted it wasn't wagyu, but was never a huge fan and wouldn't order it myself. Somebody else really wanted to try it though, so we got it as our appetizer. Holy creamy goodness. There were a lot of components of the dish that I typically wouldn't think of myself enjoying - pickled beets and cucumber - but the ENTIRE thing was delicious. The cucumber was grilled and went perfectly with the tartare.  For my entree I had the lamb tenderloin. It was cooked at a perfect medium rare, which I was really impressed with as the cut is bigger at one end and smaller at the other. Usually this results in the smaller end being well done, but not here. It came with what I can only describe as an onion jelly that reminded me of Paris, licorice root which I never knew was so good, and cherries. Perfection. Finally, we decided to share two desserts. The chocolate ganache with parsnip ice cream, and the meyer lemon hazelnut tart. Sadly they were out of the tart, but our waiter took the liberty of bringing us the frozen parfait with campari. The ganache was out of this world. The perfect balance of bite and richness I dream of in chocolate, which actually paired very well with the parsnip ice cream. I am, unabashedly, a chocolate dessert lover. However, the frozen parfait was absolutely delicious as well. Truthfully I'm not even sure what the main part of the dessert was, but it tasted damn good. A tangy tangerine sauce lined the bottom of the plate balancing the sweetness of the parfait, and little frozen balls of campari dotted the plate with deliciousness. Just as a side note, and the cherry on top of my whole meal, our server was absolutely gorgeous. So gorgeous that without so much as a word from me about him, my two straight male co-workers began a conversation about how he was too beautiful to be a waiter!  I am definitely going to have to go back to Blackbird ASAP! I have found my new favorite Chicago restaurant.",0.9991,0.698,0.266,0.036,0.620494719926538

It wasn't crowded at all, which was nice since the tables are very close together. We started with the sauteed skate wing, which would have been very good except for the fact that it was way too salty. My boyfriend, who puts extra salt on everything, even thought so. He ordered the elk strip loin for his entree, and I had smoked sea trout. I honestly can't say if I just made a mistake in ordering or if my dish was just mediocre. The fish tasted like smoked salmon, which wasn't exactly what I was expecting. There was also some sort of sauce that did not complement the rest of the dish, in my opinion. My boyfriend thought the elk was pretty good. Interestingly, dessert was by far the best course. I had the cocoa gateau, which was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the banana pan perdu, which he said was the best dessert he's ever had in his life.  Overall, it was good, but for the prices, I think it could have been better.

An overdue omnivore I am no longer, hallelujah!  Our lunch ultimately was a stellar success thanks to the three thoughtful - and unwaveringly consistent - components that seem to make every Paul Kahan establishment a Chicago sensation: looks, service and fucking fantastic food. Yep, this guy just gets it right... the recipe for righteousness lies simply in placing really knowledgeable, talented staff and superb, straightforward cuisine in positively chic, contemporary surrounds.

Ambrosial. Divine. All of it. Especially the lamb bacon.  To note: it should be mentioned that the portions of the lunch prix fixe are most definitely that, lunch-sized.

2011-05-20,4.0,"I went here again last night to see whether the recent successes and awards had changed Blackbird. Specifically, I wanted to see if they too had gone down the path of appearance over quality. I am happy to say that they have not. In fact, I find it interesting that the James beard award and the Michelin plague are nowhere to be seen, or perhaps in the hallway leading to the bathroom. The service, food, and decor remain pretty much the same quality as they were 10 years ago when I first began to dine at this restaurant and long before our French friends came here to judge Chicago restaurants. I do believe this place merits the Michelin star, and think 1 star was appropriate. It is better than many of it's peers in the 1 star category. I would dine here again many times before heading back to the purees and foam of Alinea, lukewarm food and dated decor of Boka, stuffy pretentiousness of Spiaggia or overpriced snobbery of Sixteen (and, frankly, I will support nothing Trump related, but that's another story ...) Here goes: FOOD: 5 EVERYTHING is fattening, artery clogging, buttery goodness. Food looks good on the plate but emphasis is still on taste. Flavorful, savory food with interesting twists but not so much about the show that the food gets lost.  This visit, I had as my appetizer the confit of suckling pig with fried ipswich clams. YUM!!  Dinner was aged pekin duck breast with golden beets, chestnut soubise and munich malt. My guest (from UK) had the skate wing appetizer and the lamb. Both of us cleaned our plates and enjoyed dinner. Portions are large enough to fill you up but still leave room for dessert, which we both had. Not a fan of the desserts, but mainly because in this category I am a ""Joe Sixpack"". I want an apple pie or brownie with icecream and am unimpressed by fancy schmancy nondescript deserts.  DECOR: 4 Has not changed. Could get old, but it's clean, crsip, minimalist. Uncomfortable seats to some extent but nothing that woudl keep me away. Slightly loud, but nowehere near Publican or Girl and the Goat levels of noise. SERVICE: 4 Prompt service, attentive but not overwhelming. And many of the people there have been there for years. Small things like having my coat ready for me when I was done with my meal, the tasty amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal, excellent wine selection, and general friendliness (without being giddy) of the staff were added plusses. VALUE: 4 Excluding our relatively expensive but great bottle of wine, we paid about $200 for the two of us to have full meal with appetizer, main, and dessert plus coffee. This included the tip. I would say this places Blackbird in the same value tier as Crofton or graham elliott. OVERALL: 4 Most dinners I have had here: Amazing food and nothing healthy on the menu.

The inside of the restaurant is very simple, white paper table cloths surrounded by very modern and clean furnishing and adornments. Half the people there were dressed in suits and ties while the other half were in jeans and tshirts, so it was an eclectic collection of patrons for sure (well, at least the lunch crowd is... I have a feeling the dinner crowd here is much more formally attired). There are only about 2-3 choices for each course on the prix fixe menu so we decided to each order a different dish per course so we can try as many things as we can. Appetizers: 1) Sepia noodles: chewy, flavorful, beautifully presented. One of the best sepia noodle dishes I've ever had. 2) Asparagus soup: the soup itself was ok... wasn't overtly impressive to me. There were little pieces of fried bacon inside and those were actually really delicious... as bacon tends to be, but the soup wasn't anything to rave about. Entrees: 1) Chicken and sausage:  simple and good. 2) Sturgeon: tender, mild, great. Read it in many reviews that people loved the sturgeon and it lived up to the hype, that's all. Dessert: 1) Chocolate ganache: WOW!  2) Forgot the name of the other dessert we got, but it was also delicious. (I know, that's not much help, unfortunately I was in a food induced euphoria by then and brain was running at 50% capacity) Overall: this place is definitely different than Avec, and it's definitely worth the price for the prix fixe lunch at $22pp. Make a reservation and hit it up for lunch if you ever get a chance, you won't regret it.",0.9954,0.816,0.168,0.017,0.5360446160446161

The food was very good and reminded me of one of our favorite restaurants in SF. They also offered a $22 prix fixe lunch! I opted for beet soup and the crispy duck confit while the bf went with the prix fixe with the warm sepia noodles, sturgeon for entree, and then the chocolate ganache for dessert. ----------------------------- Beet soup- Very beety and was nice and warm. It was presented like any other fancy dining establishment where they bring out your bowl with the ingredients in the soup, then pour the actual soup from a serving dish. Warm sepia noodles- definitely one of the best things of this lunch. The noodles were cooked well and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Definitely something I would order the next time I'm back. Crispy Duck Confit- I was actually very surprised by the actual crunch as I slid my knife through. The meat was cooked very well and stayed moist. I didn't think I would like the country sausage, but it was actually surprisingly very flavorful and wasn't of your typical ""breaskfast sausage"" taste. It came on a bed of grilled cauliflower, maitake mushrooms, and grapes. I liked the vegetables, but thought that the grape was too sweet and contrasted too heavily with the more delicate tastes of the vegetables. That was pretty much the only thing left on the plate. Wood-fire Sturgeon- I had a bite of this and it was very well cooked as well. Good flavor. The beets that came on the side were too pickled for my taste and I didn't think it really added anything to the dish as a whole and stuck out like a sore thumb. Chocolate ganache with parsnip ice cream- YUM! The ganache was rich without being overwhelming and I loved the parsnip ice cream with the subtle hint of an earthyness in it. I wish I knew how to make this at home! A definite great presentation of the dish.

Fortunately, our waitress was very accommodating and offered to exchange it for another entree - a wonderful veal tenderloin. It was great.  Desserts were also very good ( chocolate ganache with parsnip ice cream - exceptional, meyer lemon-hazelnut tart) though the  cocoa gateau with goat's milk was too heavy on the goat - even though I am a big goat fan in general.

Food - This was the most disappointing. The Duck breast with water chestnuts and beats, AND the Miso glazed veal tenderloin were seriously lacking in flavor. The meats were very well cooked, but fell extremely flat on the palate.The garbanzo bean soup with falafel was good but unexceptional. The best part of the meal, unfortunately, was one of the amuse-bouche. 4. Value - given the high price of the food, and its unexceptional quality, I left Blackbird very disappointed. Perhaps it was an off night, perhaps my last two weeks of partying in Southeast Asia have dampened my taste buds, but what can I say other than my experience was very unexceptional.

It wasn't bad or inedible but I just really expected it to blow my socks off, and it didn't. Not sure perhaps during chef week, they chose to serve not so exciting food compared to their regular menu; but, you know what if you didn't want to showcase your best, why participate? People might have come back if they had great experience. There's not even a red meat selection on the chef week menu. It was chicken, fish, and a vegetarian choices only. I had the chicken, and the endives salad, as well as the chocolate ganache for dessert. They were good, but no excellent. We also ordered the foie gras. We were surprised on how generous the portion was, but was turned off on the presentation as it looked like a patty of fancy feast. I can't believe I said that. Too much of a good thing and I didn't like the combination of the citrus and sesame with it.

I was pleasantly surprised and it made me want to come and try eating at Blackbird on a regular evening.  They started us off with an amuse bouche of a pancetta or prosciutto (?) wrapped coffee beignet, which was interesting but probably my least favorite part of the meal. As my starter, I got the endive salad with pancetta and a poached egg. The presentation was beautiful and anytime a poached egg is added to anything, it instantly becomes a winner! For my entree, I decided to go for the roasted chicken and sausage with cauliflower, maitake mushrooms and a kaffir lime broth. Chicken is not the most exciting protein to order when you're fine dining, but anytime it is prepared well, it is so satisfying. The skin was crisp and the chicken was tender. Lastly, I had the chocolate ganache with the parsnip icecream while the rest of the table had the vanilla parfait.

2011-03-23,4.0,"An unhappy 4... I have waited forever to visit this restaurant.  I was expecting fireworks!  Unfortunately, only mini fireworks to be had... I had an early reservation since Blackbird apparently is filled up at ""normal"" dining times for weeks ahead of time.  Even so, the spot was pretty crowded considering it was not only a weekday, but also 5:30pm. We were quickly greeted and seated.  The hostess was very helpful.  Our server was also very nice, but seemed a bit ""above"" in her attitude.  Very nice, but very distant and sort of cold.  However, she was still very good and I have to say that Blackbird stacks up with top service in the city.  I especially liked the purse hanger...rivals the purse chair.  Service is definitely a 5. As to the food, I was really expecting perfection.  The amuse bouche started this out well as the lamb tartare was delicious.  ""I could eat a whole bowl of this"" was the verdict at the table.  However, the remaining courses didn't wow as much.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, excellent in fact, but I don't think it compares to some of the other high end dining spots in the city.  I had the sepia noodles which were good, and had an interesting texture.  The soup starter was more delicious, but a bit salty.  My entree was trout - this was also quite good.  The portion size was large and the trout was tasty, but it didn't overwhelm.  It was served medium, which was nice.  However, the bean accompanyment had an odd texture that I didn't think really went well with the trout.  The chicken entree wasn't a standout and was a bit salty and unremarkable.  For dessert, the ganache was tasty, but I'm not sure I'd seek it out (and I'm a dessert girl!).  Overall, the food was nicely presented.  I did like that when my appetizer came out, and it was the wrong one, they took all of the food away to ensure it didn't get cold while waiting for my correct appetizer.  However, based upon the reviews, I was really expecting to be happily stunned by the food, but was not.  We decided that there were other places we'd rather visit for better food at more reasonble prices.  Even so, a 4 for food.  The room was very contemporary with a lot of white and a few splashes of dark wood.  It was nice, but a bit formal.  I think it may have been better if it had been darker outside because the room would have seemed more warm and cozy I think.  I'm not sure how it would be if the table next to us was full as the tables are very tight, but overall, about a 4.   I of course visited the bathroom since that is one of my rating categories.  I was so unimpressed!  For a restaurant of this caliber, the bathroom should have been a) nicer and b) cleaner.  It was such a marginal bathroom - 3. As for value, visiting during a deal week (restaurant week, chef's week) is a good deal as the total cost is the same or less than individual entrees.  However, the typical menu cost is quite high.  I am someone who is willing to pay for delicious food, great service and high quality.  However, I have other spots that I think have better food, for much better prices.  I think the general value is low.  Also, the wine list is one of the most expensive I've seen.  Individual glasses start around $12-$14 and I really don't think it's necessary to not have a wider range of pricing.  There are plenty of delicious wines that can be offered for lower per glass costs.  And a corkage fee of $25!  A bit high, though compared to the individual glasses, maybe a better plan.  Value is a 3.

Service was really good.  Drink refills came without us having to ask, food came out in a timely fashion, and our server was very educated about the items on the menu.  I did find it cute that when our salad came out, a team of servers came over to cut it up for us as it was in a nifty little potato crisp ring with a poached egg on top.  Also, I was impressed that when we left, the woman at the front desk knew exactly which coats were ours without even asking and without any sort of coat check ticker. As for the food...  I have to say that I think we will be skipping chef and restaurant week going forward because it seems like the special items for those menus are more mass-produced and, while they are good, the regular menu seems to have a bit more oomph.  That said, what we did have off the menu tonight was good but not blown-away good.  The afore-mentioned salad was quite tasty and - the pancetta was not as crisp as I'd like but the potato ring and the poached egg, my first, were both very tasty.  The entree was a ricotta and butternut tart and it was very light with a fresh and slightly sweet flavor.  The wakame and black trumpet mushrooms were really good but I loved the quinoa - very nutty and a nice texture shift for an otherwise fairly soft dish.  Last, and my favorite, was the vanilla parfait for dessert.  Wee cubes of vanilla on a light crust with some satsuma slices and a bit of a citrus sauce.  The campari bubbles were really tasty.  My husband was expecting to be blown away by his meal and while he liked his trout - it was extremely well-cooked - he felt it was lacking a little bit of something.  Overall quite a good meal though I think we will need to go back at least once to sample the regular menu to confirm my suspicion that these special weeks are maybe the issue we've been having.",0.9959,0.822,0.166,0.012,0.5254868742368743

Blackbird definitely gets an A in having inventive combination for their dishes, ingredients that you don't think of putting together works so well together that you wonder why you didn't think of it first. Service was friendly but professional and i love the fact that they don't give you too much food that you suffer from a coma in the afternoon.

2011-03-14,5.0,"Went here for restaurant week again this year, and even though Blackbird has gone through some major changes in the kitchen, I can safely say it's still my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The restaurant week menu isn't quite as good as the regular menu (why would it be?), but it was still excellent. I see some of the more poor reviews come from either lunch diners, restaurant week diners, or uneducated diners. I have no problems with any of those except for the uneducated diners. I know I sound extra yuppie right now, but hear me out... I'll be the first to admit that the first time I came to Blackbird I didn't know what many of the ingredients mentioned in the dishes were, but I still could taste the distinct flavors. I don't really know how you can blame a restaurant for your own shortcomings.  This time out, my wife and I both got the seared diver scallops wtih pears, brussels sprouts and powdered sauerkraut for an appetizer. Best scallop appetizer I've ever had. Just a touch better than the exceptional scalllops we had at Vie just a couple days before. For my meal I got the roasted farm chicken and sausage with cauliflower, maitake mushrooms, kaffir limes and applewood broth. I didn't expect it to look anything like it did. The presentation, which I usually don't really care about, was amazing. There were these hollow cylindrical sausages with the other ingredients inside it. The flavors were great, especially the limes and broth. I don't know if it was intentional, but there was definitely a shift towards citrus and tart flavors this time. Not that the flavors were overpowering, just saying. My wife hates typically hates citrus like it stole her first-born-child-which-she-hasn't-had-yet, but she loved her Sturgeon.  I love that a restaurant as distinguished as Blackbird actively participates, and, further, embraces Restaurant Week.",0.9687,0.768,0.143,0.089,0.5455849705849706

We got seated right away and the service was pretty attentive. My wife went with the scallop appetizer which was quite good. I had the garbanzo soup which was ok. With the scallops, we were off to a good start. We also added the suckling pig app which was good not great.  For entrees, we had the chicken and sausages and the trout. I liked the chicken and the sausage was really delicious. I just wish I had a bit more of both. The trout I found was just ok. Prepared well, but I didn't like the pumpernickel and I felt it was a bit smokey.  At this point, we were feeling a bit letdown. Were our expectations too high? Everything was cooked well, but was it a bit boring? Maybe it's just us. We had a bunch of restaurant week dinners that week and this was good not great.  Then the desserts came and that changed everything. We had one of each. My mind blanked out while I was eating so I can't give you a great description. One was vanilla, one was chocolate. Both were two of the best desserts we've had in  a loong time. My wife said let's order two more, I laughed, she didn't. I'll say we ended on a good note.",0.9694,0.764,0.172,0.064,0.6546560846560846

2011-03-10,4.0,"Blackbird can be described in two words: absolutely fabulous. My girlfriend, Megatron, and I have wanted to go there after hearing so many of our friends rave about it and we're glad we gave it a whirl. Despite it being too bright for me and the aesthetic reminding me of A Clockwork Orange, I still found it to have a welcoming atmosphere and was spared the ultraviolence. The service is awesome and the food is even better. We found the foie gras to be quite good, but not the best. Meg's swine was divine and my duck was perfectly cooked and seasoned, which is a rarity. The king of the night, however, was the sweet corn ice cream we shared for dessert. It was like nothing we'd ever tasted and was easily one of the best, if not the best, desserts either of us has ever had. Everything was presented very well and, after seeing the table next to us get it and love everything they were served, we're going to make sure to get the tasting menu next time we go. My one gripe with Blackbird that prevents me from giving it five stars is: ass. Yes, ass. The tables are so close together that every time a server would tend to the table on either side of us, I'd have ass right in my face. Not that there's anything wrong with a good ass in the face every once in a while. It keeps a man honest. But I really wasn't a fan of the moons over my foie gras. Take out a couple tables, Blackbird. Your guests will have a more enjoyable meal, ass fetishists will stop frequenting your establishment and you'll still make tons of dough.",0.9674,0.666,0.204,0.13,0.5791514041514042
2011-03-07,3.0,"I needed to wait at least one week before writing this review. I needed to be certain that my experience at this Beard-bearded restaurant wasn't simply disappointing because I had such  high expectations. I needed to know that, in fact, no, I was supposed to have a much better evening. And I'm willing to finger a culprit -- one that invited me to the restaurant in the first place, no less! -- Chicago Restaurant Week.  It is a shame that I both live for amazing meals and earn a meager salary, but it is for people like me that prix-fixe menus and weekly specials exist. In a way, the restaurant is investing in my cultivation as an engaged diner so that later on, when I can afford to drop three figures on a meal regularly, I will do so. It is the equivalent of a student-rate ticket to a cultural event -- restaurants are investing in my future patronage. But I do not want to return to a restaurant where the service suffers based on my participation in such a program. I will accept a limited menu (as long as the options are still high-quality) and a surplus of fellow patrons in exchange for a discounted dining opportunity, but I still want to be treated well and have a delicious culinary experience. I didn't feel like I got the most out of either of those things last Saturday. Our waiter was seldom-seen (even when I wished to spend more money! Like a regular patron! On an additional drink!) and tight-lipped once we answered his first question, which was, rather embarrassingly, ""Are you here for Restaurant Week?"" I love good service at a restaurant. Not the patronizing, wide-grinned TGIFriday's style of service, but the knowledgeable, engaged, passionate (yes, I said it) guidance of someone who understands the food they are about to serve and is very excited about it. Although if the food is similar to what Daniel and I selected, perhaps there isn't too much to be passionate about. Er, okay, that was a bit harsh. It was all good. The soup, though thin, did evoke Mediterranean flavors thanks to the sweetness, the garbanzo beans, and the falafel. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of tender fattiness. My cocktail, the Blackbird Orange, sang in the back of my throat -- the mild spiciness of the honey uplifted the tart citrus notes, and they get extra points for using a local distillery. The endive salad tasted great in the way that it could not possibly have been screwed up. But the highlight was the presentation -- tall endive shells stood proudly, surrounded by their fallen cousins, in a stadium-like ring of crisped potatoes. I would have enjoyed another gaze or two at it, but the server quickly destroyed it. Why? Was I incapable of figuring out how to dissect this structure? The butternut and ricotta tart was a serious disappointment. I had never had quinoa served toasted (it's better boiled and slightly chewy, like rice, in my opinion). Its crunchiness was off-putting, especially next to a ""steak"" of butternut and an unidentifiable crust for the tart. The chocolate ganache was also lacking. The parsnip ice cream may have paired better with a ganache that actually had distinguishable chocolate flavor; here, the only thing one tasted was the earthiness of the parsnip. I'm concerned that some Restaurant Week patrons may not know what they're missing out on when they have a sub-par meal at a superstar restaurant like this. If one isn't used to good service and good food, this would be a divine treat. But for someone who's been around the proverbial block a few times, this experience just didn't sit well with me.",0.9982,0.738,0.189,0.073,0.48592224979321763

The bill came up to $170+ including tax and tips. Not quite worth it when I almost gave myself a pat on the back for managing to finish my entrée.

2011-02-28,5.0,"Loved it!  Blackbird has really embraced Restaurant Week, and we had a wonderful dinner that allowed us to sample Blackbird's pricey menu at an introductory price. First, the way Blackbird does the menu for RW is something that other participating restaurants should note.  We received the regular menu which had the RW selections noted with a subtle red dot.  Great idea.  I ALMOST went off-RW menu with the pork loin until I noted that, at $35, it was more expensive than a 3 course RW dinner! I started with the salad of endives with pancetta, crispy potatoes and a poached egg.  It was beautifully presented in a ring of crispy shoestring potatoes.  Just as I was wondering how the hell I was supposed to attack it, our server busted out a pair of shears and snipped my salad into bite-sized pieces in front of me.  The salad was really delicious (but what with a poached egg is not delicious?).  My husband had the scallop appetizer, which was also very good. I had the trout with flageolet beans, pumpernickel and pink lady apple.  At first bite, I thought the fish was a bit salty; however, when I got bites of the fish with beans and the dry pumpernickel and the tart apple, it all worked really nicely.  My husband went with the roasted chicken and sausage, which he said was really good (I think it was a bit small for him though). Desserts were good, although I much preferred the vanilla dessert to the chocolate ganache.  I'm not really one for chocolate though. The service was excellent and well paced.  We never once felt like our waiter was annoyed that we were doing the RW menu.

The little falafel in the soup had a great flavor. They also brought a little butterfly shrimp piece for each of us  and that was delicious - I wished it was bigger than just a bite!  For our entrees I ordered the atlantic cod and the fiance ordered the farm raised chicken and sausage. The presentation was very nice; however, the flavors were just ok. The chicken seemed a little dry and the cod a little fishy. Both were items we probably would not normally order had we gone on a different day but I still expected them to blow me away, and they didn't.

2011-02-15,2.0,"I just came here for a business lunch today, and was entirely underwhelmed. Though I did scour the Yelp reviews before coming here, I suppose I should have paid more attention to what dishes to order.  Appetizer: I was intrigued by the coffee-scented fluke tartar. What I got was a mound of flavorless fish. I get that it's supposed to be subtle, but this was subtle to the point of complete blandness. The crisp was a nice touch, though I wish there had been more of it. I could only get halfway through my small appetizer before I couldn't stomach the blandness anymore.  Entree: I love bouillabaisse. Absolutely adore it. And I knew they had bouillabaisse on the menu here, so it was a no-brainer what I would order. Poor choice. First, I understand bouillabaisse to be a mixture of fish and shellfish. Mine was ALL shellfish. About 9 mussels and one gigantic shrimp. Don't get me wrong, I like mussels, but they are not exactly my favorite part of bouillabaisse. The one gigantic shrimp was amazing, but the utter lack of any type of non-shellfish left me floored. The broth was nice, but nothing special and somewhat bland. And there was a lot of oil in it compared to most bouillabaisse broths. I don't think my companions faired quite as poorly. The croques were quite hefty and came with tons of fries, though the amount of grease oozing out of the croques turned off one of my colleagues.  Service: Here's where I expected Blackbird to shine, and it definitely didn't. I didn't get the snootiness vibe that other Yelpers have commented on, but there were a lot of elementary mistakes that service made. For example, one of my colleagues and I wanted to share the fluke appetizer. The server obviously didn't get the ""share"" part, and brought us out each an appetizer. And both the entrees & the appetizers were set down entirely wrong--not one dish was put down in front of the right person. Now I know that's not that big of a deal when you are at TGI Friday's or Chili's, but I expect WAY more from a restaurant of this supposed caliber. When I order the bouillabaisse, I don't expect a croque to be set down in front of me.  Underwhelming food & amateur service?

2011-02-07,4.0,"I went here for lunch with my partner for the first time a few days ago after years of admiration for Paul Kahan. The dishes we had were both clean, perfectly executed, and helped emphasize that there is still delicious seasonal items in the midwestern winters. My partner had the organic pork belly sandwich with fennel slaw, b&b pickles, & dijonnaise on crusty, white bread (ciabatta of some kind?) which he claimed was a bit messy but he still ate every last bite. It came with a side green bean, cucumber, and red onion salad and garlic frites. The salad wasn't mind-blowing, the onions were a bit too overpowering but the greek yogurt/lemon sauce it came in was the perfect mix of tart and creamy. And the frites! There was a small mountain of them! For thirteen bucks, I was shocked at how much food came out on his plate but even more shocked that 95 percent of it tasted so great.  I went with the crispy duck confit and country sausage served with cauliflower, maitake mushrooms, smoked grapes, and kaffir lime. The presentation was of course beautiful, the duck glistening oh-so-slightly but still maintaining a perfect crunch, the sausage was fatty but still snapped, and the vegetables were okay. I greatly enjoyed the grapes and the cauliflower but the mushrooms were a bit overcooked. We ordered the phyllo brittle with caramelized white chocolate, almond yogurt, blood orange, aperol and cranberry sorbet for dessert. I'd describe it as an extremely posh version of shredded wheat which sounds disparaging but it is so not. The brittle paired so well with the chewy candied cranberries and tart bits of blood orange. The sorbet was not as tart as I was hoping for though, cest la vie. The wine list was stellar as well, prefaced by a tempting list of special cocktails, but we opted for a bottle of Villa Ponciaago 'La Reserve' Fleurie which had just enough spice to pair well with the pork belly sandwich but also had a delightful floral, velvety finish that complimented my duck confit. The service was seamless from the beaming hostess to the informed waitstaff and the open kitchen wafting delicious scents just beckoning for a return visit before you head out the door, back into the Chicago winter.",0.9966,0.8,0.172,0.028,0.5226890756302521

The food, service, atmosphere, and company were perfect.  I had the alaskan sablefish and sweet potato brandade, shrimp braised onions, turmeric and pickled cranberries. It was cooked to perfection and every morsel of food was packed with flavor.  My cocktail was the Blackbird Orange, which hit nice notes of sweet with whiskey. As a designer I am a real sucker for aesthetics. The striped down minimalism of the decor was beautiful, with just one large black and white piece of art hanging on the wall near the bar.  I noticed that they even changed out the color of the napkins to match the color of your pants, as not to get white lint on black slacks. Their attention to detail may seem over the top to most, but it's the sort of thing that makes me feel better about my own ridiculous and meticulous habits.

Quick summary of dishes ordered: APPETIZERS: [[ Coffee-scented Fluke Tartare ] ]- Just a big *bleh* of salty/fishiness.  I could not discern any coffee-scent. [[ Glazed Veal Sweetbreads ]] - The first bite I had was pretty good, smooth, tender, flavorful, but then the next two bites I had were horrid as I realized that this tasted like one of my nemeses.... LIVER. [[ Octopus Confit ]] - Not chewy at all.  A very mild dish overall even with the sauce.  No complaints. [[ Smoked Suckling Pig ]] - Was good, but had a mild formaldehyde scent/taste to it, which I'm going to assume I just associate with smoked pork now. [[ Nova Scotian Scallops ]] - GREAT! Perfect taste and texture, also great with the brussel sprouts.  The powdered sauerkraut was interesting, in that it added more texture/dimension to the dish, but wasn't very flavorful. ENTREES: [[ Roasted Australian Sea Bass ]] - This dish had an overall taste of bitterness that grew on me. The fish itself was cooked very well. The dandelion greens were bitter. The green papaya offered a nice compliment with its oh-so-light pickled taste. [[ Alaskan sablefish and sweet potato brandade ]] - The presentation is wonderful. The first bite is wonderful, as it melts in your mouth in buttery goodness, both the brandade and the fish. But then it becomes *too much* smooshy butteriness... and then you're glad that you're just trying your friend's dish, and didn't actually order it yourself.

If half stars were an option, I would have given Blackbird 4 1/2 stars, but it was a great experience, so 5 it is.  I recently moved to Chicago to work as a cook at one of the best restaurants in the city. One of my Chefs in culinary school is from the area and he recommended Blackbird. I decided to go for lunch and ordered the pre fixe meal. I sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender who was very friendly. After telling him where I work, he presented me with a free dish of the fluke tartar. Being a lover of seafood, I was very impressed by this dish. The presentation was something you would see at a fine dining restaurant. It was seasoned perfectly and included some sort of ""crisps"" for added texture. The second course was octopus confit. The octopus was very tender. It came with some sort of wilted greens that were nicely seasoned with vinegar. My main course was sturgeon with pork belly. The fish was perfectly cooked and the pork belly added a nice saltiness. The dessert was shredded phyllo, which did not sound all that great, but I was pleasantly surprised. It came with a white chocolate coating and fruit sorbet (not sure what kind of fruit). The service was great and the bartender was very nice.

2010-12-28,1.0,"I don't know where to start...there were so many things that went wrong when I went to Blackbird. I love trying new restaurants that offer something different, so I give that benefit to Blackbird, but it simply does not live up to the hype surrounding it. Let's start with the tables. My boyfriend and I arrive at 4pm on a Saturday, pretty early, and the place is not yet packed, just as we planned. The tables are packed in there, extremely tight, so tight they need to scooch the table away from the table next to it, so you can get past it to the bench against the wall. Then after you are seated, they scoot it back. This leaves about 6 inches from the side of your table to the table next to you!! My purse that was touching my thigh was hitting the leg of the lady next to me. So don't expect any privacy.  I understand Blackbird has some chef who likes to pair things that don't typically go together and has some buzz, so expect to see a lot of pretentious yuppies here. Seriously, it was like a Ralph Lauren commercial.  The ambiance is fine, minus the tables and crowd that gets drawn here, but what it really comes down to is the food.  I ordered the gazpacho with granola, which must have a waiter pour charge added to it for the price of this. It was just standard cold gazpacho, with some sprinkled granola, nothing to fuss over, kinda plain.  I ordered the best meat-- pork belly -- salty, flavorful...it takes a lot of error to mess up meat like this, but alas, Blackbird proved it can be done.  My plate of pork belly arrived and was laying in a pool of beef broth, with some green peas scattered about. Laid atop was a nice shrimp bit, with face and eyes intact staring you down. The meat was not cooked right and was too greasy, it was practically inedible. My boyfriend ordered a fish dish, I can't remember which one, and he said it was pretty ""eh"" too.  After this, and about $100+, we decided to go to another restaurant and finally get some decent food.  I'll leave you with the tip I learned from Blackbird: If you order an appetizer at an expensive restaurant and it is bad, cancel your order and just leave after that. It is normally a sign of what else is to come and will save you from wasting your time and money.",0.9605,0.846,0.094,0.06,0.466554922042727

""i wish that never happened"" fois gras:  rich and complex and well accompanied by everything but the plums (for me they didn't add) sweetbreads: beautifully cooked... seared to perfection and tender on the inside.  left me tingling... good dish. scallops: weak... did not feel that they were cooked as i like them... not sure i could describe what was missing about their preparation, but it was unexciting.  the accompaniments to the scallops lacked for me a salty element to give the sweet context.  endive salad was as good as the first time i had it... a winner of a dish. suckling pig: for me take away the ling... it was suck pig.  ouch.  what a disappointment.  I had suckling pig at blackbird for lunch last time and it was a game changer... sooooo tender and delicious with cracklin skin... but tonight.... nothing about it was good... it was not hot enough the meat was fatty and the skin was crisp but all in all it lacked flavor.   dinner:  sea bass, beautiful flavorful precisely cooked fish, weak flavorless accompaniment.   duck:  very well prepared duck... tender meat, skin crisp, fat well rendered.  the rest of the plate was not the most flavorful, nor was the meat for that matter. golden beets were forget-able.  pork shoulder: i've never experienced this cut of meat without it being slow smoked or braised.  it was as tender as it could have been considering it was grilled, but i was still disappointed with it texturally.  the black truffle that was to be with it turned out to be some muddy smear on the bottom of the plate that instead of giving me that ethereal truffle buzz made me feel like i was eating dirt.   desert was maybe the best part.  chocolate ganache with parsnip ice cream played beautifully off the saltiness of the parsnip chips... delicious. panna cotta was savory and fascinating... why is the thyme there?  oh, it belongs there were my thoughts... very cool. service, friendly, but then she forgot about us for nearly a month after we stopped ordering drinks. wine help for me, a wine novice was appreciated and tasty. bill was 300 and for 300 i wanted to be jumping for joy and clicking my heals by the end, but i just wasn't nothing about this meal made me think, that bite alone was worth the price of admission.  many items on our plates were obscure things that i've never had before, but they are obscure because they don't taste great.  i don't feel like the chef was trying to please the crowd, and to an extent, from an artistic perspective, i get it.  i appreciate  contemporary art and music, probably more than most, but i don't feel reached as an audience member after this dining experience.   i likely will not be back. More thoughts: so i woke up this morning at 7:15 wide awake (not generally an early riser) still thinking about my meal at B. Bird. i was wired... not sure if it was the sweetbreads or the espresso that had me but i was up.  I felt terrific when i woke up and really good at the end of the meal for that matter... like i could lift a truck.  I remember thinking to myself, i enjoy the feeling of having eaten that food more than the experience of consuming it.  there is no roadmap for eating the complex dishes served.  there were often so many elements on the plate that it was hard to know which ones should be playing off each other.  some did not fit to me. i was intrigued by the food, enough to write this much, enough to think about it since i ate it with little interruption.  i was impacted physically by the food... the nutrients or whatever is in the sweetbreads that isn't in a muscle cut of meat made me feel great... It's a mental thing... a sensory thing.   I feel about this meal the way I feel about the Coen brothers'  movie A Serious Man... it was so uncomfortable and fascinating.  it pulled my interest but didn't satisfy me.  i thought about it for a long time afterwards but was not gratified.  I guess this is what culinary art can be about.  I'm just not sure I'll need to have an experience like this again.",0.9974,0.75,0.163,0.087,0.5295825984714874

Also sturgeon from california which was fresh and flaky, and ironic that I came all the way to Chicago to have something grown from home in CA.  The one item I did not care for was the fried soft shell crab, which is dipped in and fried in a kind of corn starch, judging by the transparency of the batter.

The evening started by us being ignored by the staff for an extended period while they chatted amongst themselves and looked thru us rather than take our rain-soaked coats or seat us at our reserved table.  Perhaps because it was early and the restaurant was still minimally populated, the staff was moving in slow motion and their manners were still slumbering.   After we were seated, we each had cocktails which were inventive yet not at all tasty (think: Gin and apple butter and.... cucumber?!)  The evening picked up with a stellar lobster poached in butter starter.  My husband's entree, the Sea Bass, was yummy, too.  Dessert was also good.

2010-10-25,2.0,"I have a general rule that I follow on Yelp. I only write reviews for places that I feel very strongly about one way or another. I don't typically review a place that I feel was just mediocre. I'm making an exception, however, for Blackbird since I feel that you shouldn't have a mediocre experience when paying for an exceptional one.  My husband and I went to Blackbird on Saturday night for our 6th anniversary. I'd always wanted to go, but somehow we just never had. We got there a few minutes early (we had an 8pm reservation) and waited a few minutes for our table. Not a problem. However, we were standing in the doorway (there weren't any available seats at the bar) which is sort of an awkward place to stand and I even said to my husband, ""where should we stand? Should we wait outside?"" The hostess just ignored us. Now, in a regular, everyday sort of restaurant that's fine, but at Blackbird I suppose I was just expecting more.  The first thing that struck me were the tables. Perhaps it's a well known thing there, but I didn't realize how close they were to each other. In fact, when our ""neighbor"" went to the restroom, her behind literally hit the bread on my bread plate. And this woman was not large by anyone's standards.  My husband sat on the banquette and I sat in a chair with my back to the flow of the restaurant. With the closeness of the other tables, every time our waiter came by, I literally felt like if I turned to look at him we would have been close enough to lock lips. Not particularly comfortable. We started out with a glass of champagne each which was very good. Then we had our starters. My husband ordered the octopus and I ordered the fluke. His was overcooked and mine was, for lack of a better word, un-nuanced. The portions were quite generous, much more than I was expecting, and the ingredients were top notch, but the flavors were just one note. Again, I really just expected more. And the more I read other reviews here (""innovative and exciting"", ""cutting edge"", ""amazing"", etc.) the more disappointed I am since our experience was nothing like that. We proceeded to order two glasses of wine with our entrees. He had the lamb and I had the duck. Again, the ingredients were excellent and this time both were cooked perfectly, but there was just nothing interesting at all about either dish. At this point, I knew I didn't want to stay for dessert, so we went elsewhere to finish our celebration. I don't want to go into too much detail (this review is long enough as it is), but our service was just mediocre - our entrees sat finished on our table for over 10 minutes before anyone came by, the waiter took my champagne before I had finished, etc.. I'm not trying to be difficult, but again, the expectation is just greater when you dine at a place like Blackbird. I've been to Avec (fabulous) and The Publican many times (LOVE it!), I also love Big Star and have been there twice, but honestly my experience at all of their other places from the service to the food was a thousand times better.  When we left, the hostess said, ""So how was everything?"". I said, ""it was ok, not great..."". She said, ""What did you order?"". At that point I just wanted to get out of there and enjoy the rest of our anniversary and I said, ""Nothing. Don't worry about it."" And she didn't. She went back to looking at her res. book.

Anyway, I had the california sturgeon and garlic braised snails with cabbage and fresh pickles. That totally made up for the not so great foie gras. My boyfriend had a meat dish that I cannot recall. So I won't write about that. :) After our main course, we ordered dessert which consisted of french vanilla ice cream, caramel, chocolate, and espresso flavors. Deeelectable!

All that said, while the food was terrific, the vibe was significantly stuffier and more pretentious than I anticipated.  It was a Saturday night and crowded, but still, the service was slightly slower than I like.  Also, I'm a fan of smaller restaurants which Blackbird is, but I don't need to hear the details of the bat mitzvah and Disney trip being planned ad nauseam at the table next to our right, or have the waiter practically in my lap as he's cutting the gentleman's salad (literally) at the table to my left.  Tables are way too close for comfort so any sense of intimacy is lost.  That, and I'm terribly easily distracted.

2010-09-22,5.0,"Yes, Chicago, I've read your reviews. I see how some of you think the seating at Blackbird is close enough to satisfy the needs of an overly curious proctologist. I also see how some of you think that the noise level is comparable to the KISS performance of 136 dB measured at the Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest in July, 2009. Well, whether you agree or not, maybe these issues of ambiance are worth a star, at most. Maybe. So, after having read almost all of your Yelp-views, here's what I, an unsophisticated tourist from the west, have to say about those of you who rate Blackbird as something other than 4 or 5 stars: Either you had an unfortunate, bizarre, and not-likely-to-be-repeated experience, or this, and other great restaurants of the world, are not the kinds of places you should be patronizing because you will never enjoy them. Don't waste your time and/or money on them (although you might just want to go so you can tell everyone else how they're not up to your standards:-). Blackbird is a great restaurant. It's worth a Michelin star and Chicago should be proud to be able to boast about it. I was there the other night for dinner. Had tastes available only in Michelin ranked restaurants. Each dish contained a welcome surprise: Layer upon layer of taste. The integrity of the individual ingredients paid great respect. Incredible. The level of dining surpassed what is currently available in Denver. How I wish Paul Kahan and company would pay an extended  visit to the Colorado Rockies. Instead of droning on about any particular dish, just know that the place provides a cutting edge example of upscale, new American cuisine. The front operation flows seamlessly into the dining area where the servers are skilled and efficient, doing their work quickly and stylishly.

Chef Paul Kahan has been recognized as one of the city's top chefs, so I wanted to try one of his restaurants (Blackbird, Avec, The Publican). Ultimately, I chose Blackbird because of their $22 three course pre-fixe lunch...what a fantastic deal! Since this was only be beginning of many meals to come, I wanted to keep lunch *relatively* light. So the hubby and I split one of the pre-fixe lunches and ordered an extra entrée to share (the pork belly sandwich was calling my name). Wood-grilled Octopus Confit  - the presentation of the octopus was unique...almost like it had been congealed into a block of terrine, then sliced. The octopus was tender and delicate, although I would have liked some char to give it more flavor/smokiness. The candied red onion and pickled ramps were a nice complement.  Sous-vide Lamb with Lime Onions, Tamarind, Smoked Cucumbers - the lamb was beautifully cooked, really moist and tender. Although the other components had sounded interesting, they didn't quite taste right with the lamb.  Organic Pork Belly and Cabbage Slaw Sandwich with Garlic Frites - the sandwich was scrumptious. All the elements were perfectly balanced...salty and fatty pork belly, acidity and crunch of the slaw, warm toasted bread. The fries, on the other hand, were a disappointment. They were soggy and no garlic was to be found. Fried Polenta with Klug Farms Blueberries, Lemon Verbena, Smoked Brown Sugar Ice Cream - I loooooooved the flavors and textures of this dessert. Sweet, fruity, salty, smoky, starchy, creamy, crunchy...combined to make *the* most incredible bite.  I've never had polenta as part of dessert before, and it worked so well that I hope to find it in more!   Although there were a few missteps, I'd still recommend lunch at Blackbird. Good service, well executed proteins, and their fried polenta dessert was phenomenal (a MUST if you dine here).

My boyfriend started off with the stuffed quail appetizer which he barely let me get a taste of, but it was really delicious. For his entrée he had the pork belly, it came with a great crunch on the outside and a really moist and flavorful interior.  For dessert, we shared the brown butter cake with raspberries and goats milk ice cream. The ice cream was a nice sour flavor to balance off the sweetness of the raspberries and cake. It was light which was a perfect ending to the meal because it didn't leave us feeling stuffed.  I want to stress how welcoming the atmosphere was. We ended up talking to a friendly couple next to us who seemed to be regulars and know a good deal about the owner and Chicago eats. Even the bartender and one of the cooks acknowledged us with smiles. This is haute cuisine in a beautiful place with friendly people.

Just look at publican. hes evolved it into  its own  restaurant. Also probably my favorite place for dessert too.

The $22 lunch prix fixe is unequivocally a phenomenal deal, and even if I was less than impressed with the meal as a whole, it was still a great deal for the quality of food we were served.  I like the idea of the coffee-scented fluke tartare, and loved the texture and bite of each piece of fish.  However, the bread sauce felt redundant and stale, and the dish as a whole paled in comparison to the amazing brightness and crisp notes of the ceviches I just had at Frontera Grill.  The baby-octopus confit was another beautifully executed dish, but did not seem to sing out flavour-wise. The lamb entree was probably the most disappointing.  I refrained from posting pictures of the greyish pieces of meat we were served, which could not hold a candle to the sous-vide'd and perfectly seared lamb we had at Graham Elliot, which was infinitely more tender and savoury. The decor was crisp and clean, and the wait staff were nothing but friendly and completely accommodating.  I have no doubt that this was perhaps just an off day amongst many good ones, as I don't doubt that their many accolades are not well deserved.  Unfortunately, I think it was just our bad luck and if we had not been on a tight schedule, we could have have asked for a re-do of our entrees (which I am sure they would have been more than happy to accommodate).   But this was the meal we were served, and unfortunately the only meal I can base my review upon.  Hopefully I'll get another chance to come by and give Blackbird another chance the next time I'm in Chicago!",0.992,0.716,0.193,0.091,0.6244200244200244

I like eating out and checking out new restaurants but also prefer a casual dining experience. The white table cloth may have deterred me from checking out Blackbird sooner :).  This was another business dinner so the fact that I spent oodles of $$ and walked out hungry didn't pinch too much but I would be skeptical to go back just for this one reason. Don't get me wrong, I haven't had too many molecular gastronomical (sp) experiences aka no Alinea, TRU etc on my resume but I was definitely wowed both by the presentation and execution of everything that came to the table.    Their cocktails were a little fruity but not uber sweet and very refreshing for a hot summer day. I tried one with rasberries and another one with blueberries, both really good. We ordered the crab and veal sweetbread for appetizers and I loved the veal. Being a sweetbread virgin, I didn't quite know what to expect but enjoyed the texture and taste.  I ordered the sturgeon for my entree and I am so glad I went with the server's recommendation.

2010-08-21,3.0,"My fiance too me to Blackbird for my birthday as a surprise.  I have been bugging him about taking me somewhere with life changing food.  I'm a chef. He's a chef. We just wanted a great meal by someone who loves to make amazing food. First impressions: Very bustling and busy in this joint. We had late reservations at 9:30, but the place was still going strong. We had drinks next door at Meiji, recommended by the hostess. Our server, Erin, was (hmmm, how do I put this?) classy, sophisticated cool.  The service in this restaurant is phenomenal, as it should be. Napkins were folded for us whenever we got up from the table, water was filled for us when it got low, even though the bottle sat on our table, dishes were cleared and utensils replaced without missing  a beat.  The bread was okay, tasted a bit hard, but I didn't take more than two bites, since I wanted to savor the meal.  My fiance had mussel soup, which he loved. My first course was the Glazed veal sweetbreads with lime onions, tamarind, bee pollen and fried chocolate. So flippin' delicious. I wish I ordered two. The balance of the plate with the slight crispness of the sweetbreads and the crunch of the fried chocolate just amazed my mouth in the sweetest way.  I had a second course (I really wanted to order 5 apps and an entree, but resisted) of Roasted hudson valley foie gras with charred green garlic, black garlic, green almonds and shrimp salt. I loved the shrimp salt. It brought out a richer and sweeter flavor than just plain salt. Here is where the dish lost me: the foie gras was slightly undercooked. I only ate half of it. For the main course, the fiance had the sea bass, which he thought was well-seasoned and well-cooked, but not the impressing imprint he was looking for. Mine definitely left an imprint - I had the sturgeon with snails. I actually did not like the selections of the main courses. They were good  but nothing popped out at me. The sturgeon was cooked well and so were the snails, BUT, unfortunately, it was salty. Overpowering salty. I tired to brush it off, but it tasted like everything was salted in each step of the cooking process. I tried to wash it away with a drink, but it just made it worse. The snails were salty and tossed in a salty sauce, the napa cabbage just soaked in salty water & the smoked fresh pickles just made my head explode. I felt very bad to not enjoy my entree and the server apologized and took it off the bill. We didn't mind paying for it, but as she pointed out, I did only take a few bites. For shame. We opted for cheese and then dessert, but because it had been so busy, we asked for it both at once. We had the 8 year aged cheddar cheese with granola. It hit the spot. Then we had the brown sugar cake with raspberries. The plating looked silly. The dessert was just alright. I would not order it again. We ordered another plate of cheese instead. The coffee and tea selection is good. Be careful when ordering. You have to look at the prices. I almost ordered the black tea for $150 bucks. Eeek.  So here is what I love. Blackbird is busy with great style without the pretentious nonsense. You can wear jeans here and relax while enjoying the fine dining service.

Born in 1997, Blackbird has become one of Chicago's more respected  eateries...well at least that's what I was told from people on the street. Ask the locals right, they know it best.

They were delicious and proceeds went to support people impacted by the oil spill.  If that ain't responsible business, then hell....throw him to the wolves.  So what about the space? What about the minimalist touch to detail?  From reading the BIO, the James Beard Award-winning design was created by Thomas Schlesser and it's something straight out of West Hollywood-this coming from a Native Californian. Blackbird personifies simple elegance by providing it's patrons clean lines, limited tables, and a soothing color palette for the eyes.  One can't help but feel fancy, free, and at ease in the environment of  gray, white and ORANGE.   Food-delicious.

My partner and I went here to celebrate a new job--it's definitely a high-end experience--and were delighted most remarkably by the service, which is utterly excellent. The cocktail menu is very fine, with heavy use of local distilleries' products. Additionally, the cocktails were interesting, more of the New Orleans vein than the Wrigleyville. Our food was very good, and even better plated. We were served works of art. I had the octopus appetizer, which I would not order again as it was much richer than I anticipated, and the texture kind of weirded me out.

The reviews for this place have been good right? Well, for part of this year's anniversary, we booked two at Blackbird. The place itself looks chic..white decor, clean lines...ready for a photo shoot nice, sandwiched between two other restaurants, Avec being one of them.   Upon being seated, they asked to put my purse on one of those purse hanging on the side of the table hook thingies. I refused, it was a big purse, yes, but not large enough to trouble our eating neighbors that were seated less than six inches away from us...and you thought airlines were being scrimpy on leg room and personal space? Not to worry though, because I didn't have a choice with my personal belongings, another person just took the purse from my side and hung it anyway ten minutes later, just in case I didn't have enough leg room to begin with. Overhead compartments or under the seat in front of me next time, perhaps? The server was pleasant enough and took our order. Appetizer for me was the mussel soup and hubby got the suckling pig. The mussel soup was well...just ok, nothing spectacular, the mussels were a great size and sweet, but overall, many a cioppino have tasted better. Suckling pig was much better, and the apricots it came with went really well with the fat of the pig. Husband 1, wife 0. For our entrees, I got the  lamb saddle, hubby got the duck breast. Both meats were cooked wonderfully, tender and succulent. My lamb was not as flavorful as the duck, the duck was spiced better, but my spring pea falafel was what made up for it. All the spice and flavor  that could have made the lamb better ended up in the falafel, making the falafel stronger tasting than the lamb. So for this round it was a draw.  Dessert: I got the honey parfait and hubby got the brown butter cake. The server put in the criollo chocolate for our anniversary. Wow, three desserts! Yeah!  The criollo chocolate was ok, but it was hard to eat and I wasn't sure how to grasp the concept of what we were supposed to do with the large hollow chocolate sphere, the tonka bean ice cream was a nice touch. Brown butter cake went with really well with the berry flavor, it was a bit like a much happier version of a berry crisp. The winner here: the honey parfait, where each bite had a the sweet of the honey and the little passionfruit caviar burst with the sour. Great texture and lots of fun to eat.  At the end, me: 2 Hubby :2, so what better on an anniversary then to make it a draw? Overall, the portions are quite large, so you don't feel so cheated on the food here, you won't leave hungry for sure.

I got the hazelnut dacquoise with espresso, crispy chicory caramel and apricot kernel sherbet, which was purty good.  +1 for my friend's free bday dessert :) some polenta fried blueberry something, something. DELISH & sweet(sweet of blackbird to hook it up).

2010-07-06,5.0,"I did a lot of research on this one! I wanted to pick a good restaurant in Chicago to dine in - a bit fancy, innovative, great food. Convinced by yelpers as well as by Anthony Bourdain's opinion, I made reservations for Saturday, May 29th at 6 pm. Arrived late but they were nice enough to accommodate for us with no delays in finding us a table.  The place is quite nice, got seated in the first floor and didn't mind the proximity of my neighbors much.  The décor is simple yet elegant.  The servers do not wear uniforms but dress quite nicely. Service - The server was excellent.  Knew his way around the menu really well and even offered to let us make our own version of a tasting menu since we though 11 courses was a bit much for us and actually liked some dishes on the regular menu more than in the tasting one. Drinks - I ordered the Blond Hair Blue Eyes cocktail.  Definitely a nice treat, slightly bitter and not too sweet. Quite refreshing. Dinner - We ended up getting three appetizers in tasting portions and then an entrée each. I later ordered dessert.     -Amuse bouche - Duck crackling with chive florets and sea bean puree.  A nice start to the meal.     -Octopus Confit - ridiculously tender, wonderful almost smokey flavor and all the ingredients complemented each other very well. Our fave of all three appetizers.     -Foie Gras - This being our first experience with foie gras: very interesting.  Roasted seemed to work well and the charred garlic did as well.  I had to ask for it without the shrimp salt because of allergies so I'm not sure if it would've made it a bit more flavorful for me.  Will not make a decision on foie gras just yet until I try it elsewhere.     -Suckling Pig - We were so excited for this one!  The meat was tender, the stewed apricots enhanced the flavors of the meat as well as the beer vinaigrette.     -Lamb Saddle with fromage blanc and spring pea falafel - This is what I ordered and I found the cut to be slightly 'gamey' - HOWEVER, when eaten with the fromage blanc quite delicious and very tender.  The spring pea falafel were a nice surprise!     -Pork Belly - My boyfriend ordered it.  Quite tasty, the chorizo broth was very interested and he seemed to enjoy it greatly.     -Brown Butter cake - Lovely dessert and oh-so-pretty (beautiful) presentation.  The strawberry juice infused green strawberries and the goat cheese caramel sorbet in the strawberry sauce made for a wonderful and unforgettable dessert.  The petit fours in the end were a nice touch (chocolate covered almond pieces and candied apricot). All in all, a wonderful experience and did not disappoint!! Exceeded my high expectations by far.  Definitely recommend a visit if you are able to make a reservation: totally worth it!",0.999,0.724,0.244,0.032,0.6545608917831139

2010-07-03,1.0,"We should have known better from the mixed reviews, but this was one of the last places on my list of places in Chicago to try.  Should have left it on the list.   The most arrogant service I have ever experienced, and possibly the worst fine dining experience I've ever had as a result.  My wife was arriving in town too late for the kitchen, so I tried to order something - anything - to go for her to eat.   I said anything would do; she had not eaten all day and had texted me to say so.  We were told in a snooty manner (how snooty?  ask yourself: at how many restaurants does the menu identify the store responsible for dressing the servers?), that the kitchen wants its food to be presented a particular way, and that therefore, as a matter of policy, no food could be sold to go.  So I tried to explain to the manager that my wife had not eaten all day and I had promised her food, and that I would settle for literally anything; she simply reiterated, but with an increasing undercurrent of ""you are not welcome in this restaurant.""  Then when I asked, what about leftovers? she actually lectured me that it was unacceptable to order food if we did not plan to eat most of it there.  What unbelievable arrogance, to tell people how much of their food to eat and when.  News flash: I bought the food, and paid a pretty penny for it too, in the case of a place like Blackbird.  The food belongs to me.  I get to decide whether or when I will eat it or leave the entire thing to waste.  Do not lecture me. More generally, it is clear that the servers did not care whether we stayed or not, and in hindsight, I wish we had left.    In terms of the actual food: Not that I can imagine any food that would justify the condescension and contempt we experienced here, and I will freely admit that the service put me off my appetitte, but the food was, quite honestly, a bit underwhelming, given the James Beard awards lining the walls (of which it would appear they are unduly proud) and so forth.  I did like the celery bisque with pineapple, cocoa nibs, and oysters; although it sounds ridiculous, I found the combination to be a nice surprise in practice - a rich creamy experience without the cream - but even that, my friend was not so keen on.  Nothing else was memorable for either of us. I'm actually saddened to read other reviews indicating this is the best meal they've had in Chicago, or ever.  There are so many superior choices in Chicago.  The town has rightly earned a reputation for pleasing foodies.  Please don't settle for this place.  Friends, Romans, countrymen, fellow Yelpers, I beg of you, do yourselves a favor and pony up the extra money for TRU, or Alinea, both rightfully celebrated.  If it's too hard to get a table there, try Custom House.  If you want something fun, for heaven's sake, try Moto instead. If you want something cheap and unpretentious but truly high-quality that is superb value for the money, try the Gage (which, by the way, is practically a ""how-to"" on how to treat your customers).  I could go on and on. A truly fine restaurant does not treat its customers with contempt in order to prove its own worth.  I lived and ate out constantly in West L.A. for three years, and I thought I encountered a lot of bad/arrogant/self-important service there, but who would have thought that a little modernist shoebox of a restaurant in Chicago would take the cake.  Unbelievable, in the worst possible way.",0.9966,0.735,0.18,0.086,0.5682034632034633

In fact, I have urges to drive down to Chicago every day to eat there.  I came here with a friend for the $22 prix-fixe lunch. In fact, I think she is the yelper below me, so it might make the reviews for Blackbird seem a bit harsh since her dissatisfactions are being reiterated. But, they did cancel our reservations even though we were early. Yeah, it was weird. We walked in saying we had reservations, but they didn't even acknowledge that they cancelled ours. But, I guess the restaurant was pretty empty so reservations weren't necessary? I'm not sure why that happened. Anywho. We were sat in the back and it took a while for them to take our orders. These dilemmas took away a star.  I was completely satisfied with my meal. For an appetizer, I ordered the warm baby-octopus confit with black chickpeas, asian pear, hazelnuts and eucalyptus . Everything blended so well and complimented each other well. The octopus was nicely cooked, and it just tasted so good! I would recommend this dish. My friend, on the other hand, ordered the ahi tartare, and she wasn't as happy as I was. There was one thing in her dish that had a bitter taste to it, and in her entree too. Which, led her to give Blackbird 2 stars. And after sampling her dishes, I agreed. That one off taste in both her dishes would have left me unhappy with my dishes.  Luckily, I loved my dishes. My entree was the wood-grilled sturgeon with applewood broth, green almonds and haricot verts. So good too. The sturgeon was very delicious, and the sauce was so good too! I don't even know how to describe it. I would recommend this over the duck.  Finally, for desert we had the white honey parfait with coconut sponge, passion fruit, rum and caramelized white chocolate. This dish basically saved the meal for my friend. She thought it was amazing, and actually came back to Blackbird on a different occasion just to order deserts, despite her dissatisfied review.  I was debating between 3 stars of 4 because of my friends unhappy experience, but I gave it a 4 because MY good experience.

Enjoyed a drink at the bar called The Equinox which was truly awesome. The duck sausage appetizer was probably the best part of my meal.  It was served warm and tasted truly amazing. I had the trout for the main course.  It's a different kind of trout that I've had before and tasted kind of like a super mild salmon.  I prefer my fish to be cooked a little longer but it was still very good.  Also, it was garnished with some type of spicy peach item which offered quite an exciting juxtaposition of flavor.  And he waitress recommended a wine to pair with my fish that ended up being quite perfect. Dessert was a chocolate banana concoction of some type that was also different than I expected but also very good.   And I really must point out that the service was truly extraordinary in every way.   So why only 4 stars, you may ask?  There was something about this place that was just a little too cool for school, and everyone there was either an uber-foodie or playing one on TV.  I'm pretty sure I technically wasn't hip enough to be in there, and a slightly more relaxed and accessible atmosphere would go a long way for this establishment.  That's just my two cents...I know everyone else pretty much f**king loves it there.",0.997,0.733,0.267,0.0,0.6371405228758169

I ordered the Halibut and the fish was sooo salty that I couldn't finish the dish.  How does a restaurant of this supposed caliber over salt their fish?   Maybe it was because the Chef (Mike Sheerin not Paul Kahan) was too busy yelling at the other cooks in the kitchen which was in plain view of my eyeline, and very distracting.   The time in between the courses was a lot longer than at plenty of other restaurants.  I don't think you should be wondering where your server or your next course is after 20 minutes.

We were greeted immediately, our coats taken, and lead to our table (FYI - space between tables is nil - they have to pull them out for you to get into your seat - so those of you with personal space issues, consider yourself warned) Our server Sarah was the best, so personable and friendly, and great with the recommendations.  Here's a rundown of what we enjoyed: Cocktails - Hibiscus Kiss (me), Cannes Artist (hub).  Both were very delicious and got our appetites going. Amuse Bouche - Suzuki (Japanese Sea Bass) Sashimi with tapenade, mustard seeds, and chive dill cream - First time to enjoy one of these in a restaurant.  It was the perfect first bite of taste and texture.  Amused my bouche!

Octopus Confit w/ Ramps and Red Onions - Another hit.  I'm a fan of octopus already, but this was prepared in an entirely new and delicious way, bonus - also discovered that I love ramps. With the above apps, we enjoyed a half bottle of recommended Pinot Noir - a favorite wine of mine.  Thoroughly enjoyed. For entrees, we went with the following: Halibut with Uni, Spring Radishes, Ramps, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, and Reduction Sauce -  The hub chose this dish and it was amazing.  Probably the best Halibut I've ever had...wish there was more of it ^_^ Lamb Saddle with Spring Pea Falafel, White Asparagus - I was determined to be adventurous and not eat one of my usual choices and decided on this dish.  I was greatly rewarded.  The lamb was juicy, tender, with just enough fat around the edge of the 'saddle'.  I loved the falafel - found out that spring peas are in season and was very happy to see them incorporated into a few dishes during this trip. With the above entrees, we each enjoyed another recommended glass of wine each - I'd dish on which winery - but I was getting ""fuzzy"" by this point ^_^ A well deserved 5 stars for a perfect dining experience on our first night of a fun and memorable R&R weekend (First time to Chicago!).  Can't say enough good things about Sarah - she elevated the experience with her professionalism and friendliness.  On her last recommendation, we chose our next stop - Pops for Champagne...",0.999,0.748,0.24,0.012,0.4723321651893081

2010-05-11,5.0,"First trip to Chicago with wife, first restaurant we ate at on first night of trip, first 5 star review. Wow. If this was any indication of what was to become of the weekend, I was excited. I have never had such a complete dining experience.  Exterior, simplistic and narrow. Not very assuming at all. We walked in and were greeted immediately by 2 hosts. Our coats were taken and we were shown directly to our table.  The interior was very narrow and tight to the point where tables had to be pulled out in order for you to get into the booth. There were a couple of big parties as well with the open kitchen in the back of the room. Super tight but I see it as trying to fit in as many people as safely possible so that they don't have to turn away more people than they probably already do. More people equals better prices overall it would seem so I don't mind being so close to other tables. It also gave us a chance to scope out other people's dishes as they came out and people were so ecstatic that they were more than willing to talk about how good their food was. I know we were, but I'd be lying if I said that I wouldn't care if a sneezer or cougher was in my midst. he.  Our waitress Sarah arrived quickly and greeted us and immediately set us up for water and breadsticks. She then recommended a couple of cocktails for us and we were started.  Breadsticks were very tasty and hard to put down. They were soft and had a lot of flavor. No butter needed. (but added some anyway) I had the Cannes Artist and it was good gin and some citrus with a touch of lavender. Very tasty and subtle which is how I like my drinks. The wife had the Hibiscus Kiss which is Sparkling Wine mixed with hibiscus and St. Germaine. We like Jamaica (the Agua Fresca but also the country) so this was very familiar and refreshing. Good start.  I have to mention that regardless of the size of the house or the amount of patrons that were waiting for a table, there was a clear message that we were in no rush to order, eat, and get out of there. Sarah didn't have to say a word but just the way everybody conducted themselves made it pretty apparent that we were to have a nice relaxing dinner. Nice.  So after a while of scoping the menu and asking Sarah questions and sipping our drinks, we finally decided to order a couple of appetizers to whet our appetite and a half-bottle of Pinot Noir to pair it off.  Satisfied that we ordered our first course, no longer than 3 minutes later, the chef sends out an Amuse Bouche to start us off. First official one for me other than the creations I make at home so this was a good surprise.  Suzuki Sashimi w/ Olive Tapenade, Mustard Seeds, and Chive/Dill Cream - Wow. The mustard seeds were subtle and provided the pop texture while the tapenade provided the salinity. All together, it was incredible. Great start.  Veal Sweetbreads w/ Candied Kumquats, Black Pepper Jam, and Kohrabi - Delish. Sweetbreads were subtle and not overpowering and cooked perfectly. The jam was absolutely amazing and complemented the dish well.  Octopus Confit w/ Ramps and Red Onions - Wow. Octopus doesn't have fat to render so they used olive oil to slow cook these bad boys and it comes out as soft as butter. Served with malt and what seemingly was Kewpie mayo, this dish was unique and amazing.  Ready to order another dish. Sarah came by along with the other staff to ensure we were happy and our water/drinks were full. We finally decided on a couple of dishes that complemented and didn't overlap our already delicious experience. We also paired each dish, thanks to Sarah, with a glass of matching wine.  Slow cooked halibut with Uni, Spring Radishes, Ramps, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, and Reduction Sauce -  What a great dish. I've seen a few chefs poach their fish in Olive Oil but have never actually tasted it. What a great concept and what a great complement of sides. Best halibut I've ever had, hand's down. Have..to...duplicate..at...home....  Roasted Lamb Saddle with Spring Pea Falafel, White Asparagus, and White Fromage - If you ever had any bad expectations from lamb regarding gaminess or taste/texture, eat this dish and be amazed. The taste was that of the best piece of grade beef that you'll ever have. Cooked MR was perfect and heaven. The Spring Pea Falafel was on the verge of being too salty but realized that it was the seasoning of the falafel that makes it so good/unique. The great green color is just amazing to see and adds to the overall flavor of the side. Good stuff.  Wish we could have had enough room for dessert but we were done. We will save that experience for next time. Great great great experience overall. Sarah was rad in her vast knowledge of food and drink and also referenced us to a cool bar afterwards for a night cap.

The entire dessert not overly sweet  which is a dissapointment for me because I have a sweet tooth.  I will commend it for being differnt and something I don't think I could get elsewhere.  The jivara was much more to my liking.  Chocolate with carmelized banana over sesame rice cakes.  Can I have another?  Please note that with the ""ovaltine"" the chocolate is also not very sweet (more milky than dark).

The executive chef is Paul Kahan, who has a very amusing Twitter filled with invective against food critics. Blackbird is different from the other places we've done. When it opened in 1997, it was hopelessly trendy, with stark minimalist colors and a very avant-garde look. These days, it's merely hoity-toity.

She used the verb ""relax"" in place of ""wait"" throughout the meal, and it was a startlingly good word replacement. I'm surprised I've heard nobody else use this euphemism before. It's disarming and really, doesn't ""wait"" imply ""impose upon someone to hold what they're doing for you""? I had a cocktail called the ""Kentucky Cooler"" that was served in a little copper tourine with pellet ice and a giant sprig of mint. Essentially it's mostly just a very fine whisky and sugar with a hint of mint, like a non-crushed Mojito. VERY refreshing. Copper, while a gorgeous presentation metal, makes for a REALLY COLD DRINK to handle. I wish I could properly describe all the food that we had, and show pictures, but sadly I cannot. The online menu doesn't 100% match the menu we ate at the restaurant. I'll do what I can. APPETIZER: Alaskan king crab tail with ricotta mayo, sunchokes, smoked paprika and pickled parsley. In every way, this was a delectable dish. The crab tail was savory and tender and slightly salty, the ricotta mayo was bold and brash, and the real surprise of the dish was the pickled parsley, which was extremely flavorful, something I never expect from a ""garnish"". I could have had a salad made just from this. MAIN COURSE: Three quail breasts on a bed of a couscous-like grain. Now, when my dinner companions tasted this, they thought it was AMAZING. I found it to be very good, but frankly I have had much better poultry dishes before and this wasn't distinguishable enough to me for me to fawn over. Whatever that grain was, though, it was DELICIOUS. I thought it was very fine spaetzle at first, but both of my dinner companions insist it was a grain, so I'll go with them. Maybe semolina? DESSERT: Tangerine chiboust with campari, pineapple, semolina and zingerman cheese ice cream. This, I found to be the high point of the meal. Essentially, I felt that the chiboust, which is essentially a custard/meringue/gelatine mix, was light and fluffy and contained the Essence of Tangerine. Slightly tart, mostly sweet, and a lot creamy. The ice cream was light and airy and paired well with the chiboust. I paired this with a 10-year tawny Port that, while delicious, was REALLY badly paired with the dessert, unfortunately. Way too much. I imagine this would go well with a light sherry. We had two amuse-bouche items this time. The first one was a peanut puree with a slice of bacon that had a very startling taste, and the second was an absolutely amazing chocolate ...drop...thing... with a rum liquid center. Overall, not the best place we've eaten at (I think Mercat a la Planxa wins that one, with North Pond and Brasserie Jo's close seconds), but very close and certainly amongst the best restaurants in Chicago.",0.9951,0.829,0.13,0.041,0.5514701436130005

We had reservations, and the place was packed. Even though we were a little late, they seated us quickly and we were well tended to by the staff. They seemed pretty on point with the service. The space is definitely cool, with very chic decor. We shared a cute little salad that had these cute little ""nests"" of potato that were totally delicious, and for an entree I had blackened sea bass, while my husband had a pork belly dish. Both were totally lovely. The chef  treated us to a little smoked trout tasting dish with cucumber, which was also very yummy. I've never had a chef just randomly send me something, so I thought it was cool. The dessert though? THAT was amazing. I had the honey parfait, and my husband had the lemon tart with basil. SO good - I actually have dreams about the honey parfait.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because it was really loud in there. I had a really hard time hearing my husband, and vice versa. It was also difficult to hear some of the things the wait staff was saying.

Service was pretty good, but not what you'd expect from somewhere that purports to be so nice...I ran out of water before dessert and didn't get anymore for some reason.  I wasn't in the mood to chase the waiter down, though.  In addition, more than one of the staff bumped into me and/or had his pits way too close to my face or on me.  That's probably because of the space (see below), but that's not my problem. The ambiance is my primary reason for the overall rating.  The noise here is simply unacceptable.  The cramping is simply unacceptable--you're basically at a communal table that has nominal spaces--you have to pull out a table and do acrobatics to get out of the banquette--the waiters can't reach diners at the banquette without getting all over diners seated in chairs--it's a total nightmare if you're looking to have a nice dinner.  Together, they are miserable.  (If you're inclined to conclude I'm just unusually sensitive, consider that I gave Publican a 5, and obviously didn't mind its space and noise levels, despite the fact that others seem to complain about it.)  Also, more than one patron near me (so I refuse to chalk it up as an outlier) behaved like an older version of a South Park schoolboy--I guess hot restaurants attract moneyed louts too.",0.9671,0.785,0.147,0.069,0.6369378306878307

I was expecting a few well-crafted dishes that will have me saying, ""Mmm, this is actually pretty good."" But the meal was a disappointment. My friend and I got the charcuterie plate with the duck sausage and the sweetbreads to start. The sweetbreads plate was decent. Good flavor and texture. Mildness and crispy breading of the sweetbread went well with the black pepper mousse it was served with. However, the charcuterie plate was nothing to write home about. I'm sure you can get better cold cuts and sausage elsewhere. The entrees... maybe I got the wrong thing? The halibut was pretty awful. I was glad there wasn't much on the plate to begin with. It became a chore just to finish the plate. The fish didn't taste fresh. The flavors didn't seem to work well together. The uni was the only saving grace of the dish. My friend got the pork belly, which was good, but  not $33 good. =\ You can tell we are total suckers because we went on to order dessert, hoping it would save the day. But sadly no. We got the criollo chocolate thing. The milk meringue was kinda cool. Imagine a shrimp chip, but instead it's a milky white chip that melts in your mouth. It was creamy and crunchy all at once. The rest of the elements on the plate were strange in a bad way. The ice cream was covered in a really hard chocolate shell, making it almost impossible to eat. We joked it might fly across the room if I tried too hard to crack it. Overall, the food was just bleh. The service was great though. Oh, be forewarned, the tables are VERY cramped.

First course was the salad of endives with baby lettuces, potato, basil, dijon, pancetta and poached egg. I could not have been happier with this salad. The poached egg and potato were my favorites aspects of the salad. The potato was shredded into circular rings and then fried to serve as a basket for the lettuce and poached egg. The poached egg was a hidden treasure in the middle of the salad. Anyone who knows me, knows that I'm a sucker for eggs! The main course was aged pekin duck breast and sausage with sauerkraut dusted yukons, black raisin and savoy cabbage.

2010-03-23,3.0,"It's Chef Week and I went to Blackbird. Let me just say right off, I THOUGHT I WAS A FOODIE. After Blackbird, not so much anymore... it's not a bad thing. I'm just not as frou frou with my food as I thought I was! Anyway...  Set the scene... Party of four. Two gay men and two straight women. Good times for sure! We walk in, and we're immediately greeted by the hostess. Good. Okay, she offers to check in our coats and bags. I thought it was odd she piled the coats on the counter, but I later found she stored it. So that was fine. We sat down, water was filled, and bread was given. The floor manager (probably floor manager?) came by and asked if we have any questions about the menu. He noted that they were out of the flat iron steak and instead it is lamb. Sad face. Two of us were really looking forward to the steak. We order our three courses for the Chef Week Menu. I ordered a veal appetizer, sturgeon as my main dish, and satsumi with cheese ice cream for dessert. The veal was all fat. (This is where the ""I'm not so much of a foodie as I thought I was"" comes in.) It was somewhat delicious, but the texture bothered me. The sturgeon was great, but after awhile, I couldn't eat anymore. I'm not big on fish and since they were out of the steak and had lamb as a replacement, I was out of options since I'm not a lamb fan either. The presentation, however, was beautiful. The dessert was the winner for me. The satsuma with pineapple glaze and cheese ice cream was pretty good.  In terms of service, it was hot and cold. Thinking it was lunch, we thought we'd be out of there within 90 minutes. Our friend had to leave after 75 minutes to go to a meeting. The second course barely came out. She asked to pack the dessert, but they couldn't because of the ice cream that came with her chocolate pave. However, the floor manager did it anyway and gave my friend an extra bit of cake to compensate for the ice cream. Brownie points there. Literally. I asked for an iced tea, but it didn't come until 30 minutes into the meal. He apologized and luckily didn't charge me (as he shouldn't). That was good and bad, right?  The gentleman cleaning up our table asked us if we wanted to see a dessert menu. I found that odd since they knew we went with the Chef Week set menu. To me, that says the communication lines are a little off. Perhaps that's also because there is not one waiter or waitress? Instead, it looks like multiple people run the entire floor with a food runner (who - by the way - had a beautiful purple and white dress on!). Overall, food was either amazing or blah, and service had its moments as well. More like 2.5 stars since it's smack dab in the middle, but the dessert was so good it's 3 stars.",0.9977,0.806,0.164,0.03,0.4844030365769496
2010-03-23,5.0,"I took my brother here for his bachelor dinner along with one of his long time friends. This had come recommended by a bunch of friends, so we were looking forward to this. It was very easy to get to, and there was plenty of parking in lots nearby. We were running slightly late, but it wasn't a problem at all. We were seated right away. The drinks list was great, there was lots to choose from and all of the prices were very reasonable. I settled on a glass of Chateauneuf du Pape since its rare to see a list offer up CdP by the glass They started us off with a small plate of halibut in a white sauce. It was very well cooked and tender. It started off things very well. We then moved into two appetizers for the three of us. We got a plate of crab tails as well as a charcuterie plate. The crab tails were very delicious and had great texture to them while being perfectly cooked, and the charcuterie plate was delicious with some pancetta and a whole slew of other stuff that had a variety of sauces to dip in We then moved into the entrees and I got the peking duck breast. This was perfectly cooked and was very delicious with a good amount of tenderness on the meat, and a crispness to the skin. A real good balance between the two makes it really good.  The red sauce has a bit of tangyness to it that complimented the duck as well My brother got the wagyu and we all tried a small piece of it. This was extremely good and melted in the mouth. It was a bit of a tease, but it was great to try Most of all, for high-end dining, this was very affordable. If we weren't covering my brother's bill, it would've been around 75-80 a head after tip, and I've certainly paid more for a lot less.

2010-03-20,5.0,"Having driven from our downstate farm, we arrived 10 minutes late for our 5 p.m. reservation.  Or: trying to get a last minute reservation for my daughter's belated 21st birthday dinner, the only opening Blackbird had was one upstairs for 5. When the hostess had told me that the reservation would be upstairs, my antenna rose in potential warning.  She assured me that it was quite pleasant, that it was surrounded by artwork and many requested to be upstairs.  I wasn't so sure since we had driven by the restaurant a number of times and were always attracted by the street level, full window looking into the stylish, white restaurant interior always with the lush bouquet of flowers at the front. When we arrived, we were greeted by two friendly hostesses who checked our coats and confirmed that we would be upstairs (damn! I thought).  As we climbed the stairs (no big deal, but it might be a triathlon challenge if a woman is wearing significant heels), we entered a very attractive room with a bar and an interior of tables surrounded by a banked wall for seating.  There was art-work and flowers with the décor set in gray with black tables and chairs.  It was a stylish, subtle setting.  A criticism of the downstairs had been that the tables were too close and that it was noisy.  Not so upstairs.   After we were seated, a waiter approached.  He got an A+ for the whole evening.  We had both looked at the menu on-line (recommended).  When we asked about wine or any selection, the waiter succinctly described the item, telling us the spicing, preparation, texture and taste expectation.  No pretension at all. My daughter had read that the drink menu, cocktails, were excellent.  I looked at the selection and chose wine.  My daughter chose a drink called a BB gun.  This is now her favorite drink.  (If you are naïve, as a parent, you would be surprised that a 21 year-old could have a favorite drink with her first drink.  No one is that naïve of course.  And of course, this birthday dinner was fairly belated.) The order.  Father: mussel soup; foie gras (shared); pork belly. Daughter: celery root bisque, butter poached lobster.  Dessert (shared): cheese plate and criolla chococlate.  Wines at waiter's recommendation (Kohler Sauvignon Blanc (to start), Van Duzer Pinot Noir (pork belly), Vineau Chevreax Vouvray (lobster).    Each plate and the whole dinner was an explosion of interesting tastes, twining together and contrasting in interesting ways.  The amount of food was satisfying.  Note: do not come to this restaurant with a Las Vegas expectation of all you can eat, waddling out at the end. Mussel soup: with white fish, superbly infused creating a strong suggestion of a bouillabaisse, but better than any I've had in the states.  Foie gras: I am reminded by my spouse that I had foie gras in Paris, but I don't remember; this was excellent and I will remember it.  The sponge cake and puffed barley that accompanied the foie gras was genius.  Pork belly: The pork belly reminded me of a cross between ham and bacon; it seems like a small plate, but the tastes were so rich that more would have been an excess; the chorizo broth was another artistic inspiration.  Daughter's report: celery root bisque (delightful, being caught off-guard by raw oyster, but not unpleasantly), butter poached lobster (not too rich as some lobster can be when served in a butter bath).   The wines complemented the meal as you would expect given the waiter's recommendations.  Next time, I would try the Zinfandel with the pork belly, the waiter's other recommendation.   Father and daughter agreed that the cheese plate was wise to order (we weren't certain of this before).  The restaurant clearly understood the cheese taste, complementing them with such items as carmelized honey. The criolla chocolate was exactly as described by the waiter, but did not knock our socks off.  This is more a criticism of our decision than the selection. Daughter debated whether to get another BB gun, ultimately deciding not to.  Recommendation: bring designated driver (for father and daughter, a/k/a wife and mother, who unfortunately was home, happily watching the Olympics, recovering from surgery).  We have discussed plans to return to the restaurant in April for my daughter's next birthday when she turns 28.  No, it's not that bad, but Dad did delay this 21st birthday dinner for too long a time.   Daughter is talking of a continuing ""birthday"" tour of more Chicago restaurants.  If you can find a companion who has such an acute ability to appreciate and describe artistically created food, you are as lucky as I am.  Recommended.",0.9978,0.824,0.134,0.042,0.622900347515732

Maybe it was an off night, but my date and i walked in ONLY because Avec was way-too crowded.  We were unaware that our dress code (i.e him in dark designer jeans and a blazer) would warrant such horrible service and eye-rolls from the hostess.  Regardless, we were seated and decided to give this place a shot.  I had no idea that ""haute elf food"" was in now-a-days, especially during a recession when people are looking for stellar customer service at a bare minimum if they're going to pay an arm and a leg for a meal that barely satisfies.  Don't get me wrong, my salad was beautiful, but it was ALL decor and swirls of sauce on an over sized plate and hardly any substance.   When my boyfriend asked a question to clarify exactly what ""sturgeon"" was or ""skate wing"" - the waitress looked at him like he was a bug. I was livid. Not to mention, her appearance was APPALLING. She had a BLACK EYE and looked like she was recovering from a nose-job or something (maybe another angered patron clocked her?!).

We had something to celebrate and came here on a Thursday night.  We arrived a little earlier in the evening and the restaurant was just starting to fill up.  The first thing you notice is the hip, somewhat minimalist decor, which is usually a little off-putting for me, but it works very well. We ordered a couple of cocktails and reviewed the menu. As the alcohol slowly wormed its way into my brain tissue, the 9 course tasting menu starting looking more and more like a reasonable thing to do.  After much debating (since we're kind of cheap), we succumbed to temptation and ordered it. Highlights were the impossibly flavorful and delicate Tasmanian Sea Trout and the delicious beef short rib.  My wife was a huge fan of the three desserts, though being more savory than sweet kind of guy myself, I would have preferred more meat/fish courses out of the 9 than 3 desserts. Nevertheless, everything was absolutely perfect.  If you have something to celebrate or you're just filthy rich and can afford to eat like this all thetime, definitely hit up Blackbird.",0.9947,0.759,0.241,0.0,0.604761904761905

I was surprised how busy the place was considering it was so snowy out, but then remembered it WAS Chicago after all.  The decor was understated and minimal, the lighting was just a tad too bright.  I sat along the banquet seating that ran the length of the restaurant towards the back and had a full view of the restaurant and its patrons, which tended towards the late 30's/early 40's and definitely leaning on the well-heeled side.   The kitchen sent out a lovely little complimentary amuse-bouche - a slash of sashimi with some microgreens.  Since it was nearing 9pm, neither of us were particularly looking for a heavy meal, so we ordered one appetizer to share - the charcuterie plate - and  devoured the whole thing.   I probably would have ordered another one if I didn't have the braised short ribs coming!   The only complaint I had about my entree was that it was a little on the fatty side.  Maggie had the arctic char and pretty much finished it clean off.   We had no room for dessert but ordered some lovely teas.  The waiter, who at times during the dinner had seemed a little stilted - I couldn't decipher if he was awkward or standoffish - suddenly seemed to perk up near the end of our meal.  Maybe it was because we were one of the last 2 tables lollygagging around (and it was nearing only 10pm)!     When Maggie asked about a certain tea on the menu that was priced ridiculously (something about hand-picked near a full-moon or something to that end), he perked up even more and told us that it was good but wasn't really that spectacular in his opinion.  The conversation moved to the commerce and distribution of tea, and somehow I learned that there is wild ginger growing in Wisconsin (indigenous I believe he said).  I mean who knew!  I was a satisfied customer.  Not only did I have a delicious meal, but I also walked away with a random nugget of information to add to my collection of interesting but useless facts!",0.9919,0.82,0.14,0.04,0.5468295304232803

I was really looking forward to having pumpkin bisque and braised short ribs and pear sorbet but when I got there today for lunch I looked at the prixe fixe menu in horror to see that they were instead offering the following: APPETIZER: choice of mixed greens, parsnip bisque, or duck pate ENTREE: choice of roasted chicken, grilled trout, or a sweet potato vegetarian dish DESSERT: an unidentifiable thing called a satuma chiboust or the chocolate pave (which was the only thing I liked on the whole menu) Where do I begin with my disappointing experience with Blackbird (and I had such high hopes for this place). You've led me astray fellow Yelpers (either that or everything I had today just totally sucked). I got the duck pate, which looked and tasted like SPAM, and I've never had SPAM but I imagine that's what it would taste like. For my main entree, I ordered the trout--it had no taste or flavor whatsoever, I could have been eating a piece of paper! My friend ordered the chicken which was just really undercooked and bordering on being a salmonella hazard. I had the unidentifiable dessert called a satuma chiboust, couldn't really tell you what was in it but it did NOT taste good. The chocolate pave was decent. Service was hectic, sporadic, and unorganized. We were greeted nicely at the door but that was followed by an almost mandatory request to let them hang up our coats somewhere in back because the restaurant is so small that there's barely enough room for people to sit like sardines in the communal seating area, much less their coats and purses. We were sitting by the door and every time someone came in we'd get a blast of cold air. I swear they had no heat on in the place and by the end of my meal, my fingers were turning blue and I was about to catch pneumonia. And I couldn't put on my coat because they took that away! The meal was unbearably long for the teeeeeeeeeeeny tiiiiiiiiiiiiiny portions that were served. We had to wait 15 minutes between each course. I was bored, cold, and hungry. I think there was one waitress for the whole restaurant and she was dressed in plain clothes, while the bus boys wore nice slacks, a shirt and tie (odd! and kind of stupid if you ask me). One of the bus boys kept throwing the utensils on our table before each course instead of delicately placing them. Our server disappeared when we needed to get our bill. And during my meal, all I did was watch the hostess shuffle people's coats back and forth, back and forth. And we had to wait 5 minutes by the door to get our coats back when we left.  For all the hype about this place, I was expecting out-of-this-world good food and the food was not even good. If you're going to give me teeny tiny portions (see pictures), it better be packed with flavor, which also was not the case. I say save your money and try a different restaurant this week or if you do go, just order from the regular menu, they have sandwiches for $13 that I saw on my way out on someone else's table that was actually a good size with a giant heap of french fries on the side.

We got a great French Syrah (Le Papillon something or other) that really set the evening for us - appetizers were the apple bisque for her and the seafood soup for me.  Sarah had the foresight and thoughtfulness to come by and murmur to me the following question: ""Your soup has a crouton in it; would you like us to remove it in case you would like to share a taste with your wife?""

I had the veal which was prepared really nicely and María tasted (she didn't want more than the appetizer).  We both got awesome desserts that hit the spot as well. It's a cool people watching place as well; we had reservations for 9:30 and ended up leaving around midnight - no joke, it was like being in Madrid or something in terms of being able to do sobremesa without someone breathing down your neck to leave.

2010-01-27,2.0,"let see , where to begin when you have $30 price tag per meal. I suppose you'll be expecting some sort of service, courtesy and good food. when we come in, we were the only two person eating at the restaurant (6:00 pm), later around 7:00 pm we see some more crowd. ok back to the restaurant. as stated earlier, we are expecting a price ratio on service, quality and price should be on par. if you see average of $30 in a menu, you'll be expecting some sort of good food. so we ordered a couple of entrée.  - Malted apple bisque with smoked sablefish, granny smith apples and hickory (nice touch, good flavour, very good) - Grilled prime beef short rib with cauliflower, sesame gnocchi, persimmons and sarsparilla root (very good, but to my taste, the meat has too much fat on it. about 40% fat, making the meat very soft and tender. but again, too much fat and making the taste really good.. lol) - Roasted wisconsin veal chop with salsify, braised artichokes and pumpkin (very bad, dry) overall experience, not coming back for 2nd. - service, the gal that show you the door and the menu, excellent the person who serve you the meal, horrible. they just shove the food to the table not telling which one is which and what they are serving, we have to call up our server a couple of time asking, what is this. food was mediocre  at best, but for the price, horrible.

2010-01-27,3.0,"Blackbird = Great Beatles song (which I am currently listening to) Blackbird Restaurant = Good food I went there on a Wednesday night with my wife for a ""fancy date night"".  We definitely picked the right place for fancy.  No jacket required, no tie required, shoes and shirt required (plus pants).  But the place was beautiful inside, very contemporary interior.  Needless to say the surroundings of the restaurant were great. Waiter comes to table ""would you like bottled water or tap""?  So far so good (until we heard him say to the table next to us later in the evening ""everything is great here"" when asked what's good.  Come on, everything?  Get real, be honest, if I have a pet peeve, that's it - ""oh, everything is great here, you can't go wrong"") I perused the wine menu for a while pretending like I knew what I was doing.  Which, sometimes I do but most of the time I don't.  I ordered a Pinot Noir from Oregon which is a great climate for Pinot's.  The waiter made us feel like we had chosen the wrong wine, so a discussion ensued.  In the end he chose a Burgandy/Granache mix from France for us and it was a fantastic wine. Bread and Butter comes to the table.  Basically it was a slab of butter with chopped rosemary, salt and pepper sprinkled on top with some artisanal bread... So this is a place where you would expect something out of the ordinary, something special.  Not with the bread and butter... Might as well go to the Olive Garden. So people don't come here for the bread and butter, so that's not a big deal as more of a disappointment.  Appy time!  We ordered an apple soup with scallops and a mussel soup with white fish.  The apple soup was decent but lacked some flavor.  The bay scallops however had a wonderful smokey, almost bacon flavor to them that accompanied the sweetness of the apple soup.  Mussel soup... best dish of the night.  It came with 4 huge mussels, white fish and the broth was wonderful.  The soup had the mussel ""fish"" flavor with saffron and I'm not sure where the spiciness came from in this soup but it was great! Main course:  Beef Short Ribs for me; Pork Belly for her. Beef Short Rib - The short rib is making a huge comeback in restaurants these days.  They are almost guaranteed to be on any menu where the Chef went to culinary school.  They were at this restaurant.  The short ribs were good, that's it, good.  Not great, just good.  They were accompanied with some flavorless cauliflower, potato gnocci and unfortunately I can't remember the sauce it came with simply because well...it was forgettable.  I ate it all because yes, it was good, but I have had better.  One place that it is better is in my own home when my wife makes her braised short ribs... Heaven, seriously, Heaven! Pork Belly - This is where Blackbird hit it out of the park.  The pork belly was served in a cabbage broth infused with chorizo sausage.  Okay, pork belly, sausage, cabbage.  Where can they go wrong?  Four small portions of pork belly were served in a dish with just enough cabbage (which had been in the broth long enough to have a sauerkraut quality to them) and that's all you needed.  This dish was rich (shocker considering pork belly is pretty much bacon) with more of a ham flavor then bacon, but it was great. Although this is a contemporary restaurant where you might think you will have to go to McDonald's afterward because you only got tiny portions, not here.  We had no room left for desert unfortunately (must have been all the boring bread I ate), but we will be back for another try at this restaurant.  Was it great?  No.  Was it good?

I ordered the $22 prix fixe lunch: veal sweetbreads appetizer, stuffed quail entree, and a peach brioche.  The sweetbreads were oh-so-chicken-nuggety, all fried and crispy and savory!  I very much enjoyed those innards, and I think you will too.   My stuffed quail was pretty delicious too.  Like most entrees at nice restaurants, this also included a scattering of other ingredients that I failed to recognize, but who cares.  It was good.  The peach brioche was... interesting.  Our waiter poured some type of peach juice all over the brioche, so the brioche looked like it was swimming in a pool of water.  I ate the curious thing with fascination and confusion.  It just goes to show how little I know of fine dining, and how absolutely uncultured I am.  ""Why did they pour that juice all over my bread?"" I haven't found an answer yet, but all you need to know is that it was good. I should warn you, though, that the prix fixe portions are tiny.  Cathy H. calls this a ""big plate-tiny food"" place, and indeed it is.  Blackbird (and all other ""big plate-tiny food"" establishments), I've always wanted to give y'all this suggestion: I think y'all should buy some smaller plates and put the same amount of food on it.  You see, this will effectively create the illusion that there is a lot of food.   Anyway, if you don't opt for the prix fixe, you should probably order one of their sandwiches.  My friends each ordered sandwiches, which were pretty decently priced, and they both really enjoyed their meals.  I think the sandwiches were $13 each, or so.  Their portions were pretty big, and Cathy H. especially enjoyed the GIANT servings of fries that came alongside the sandwiches. Oh, and I can't write this review without mentioning their TRULY EXCEPTIONAL service.  Our waiters and waitresses were all gracious, attentive, and responsive.  Also, when my friend found what may've been an eyelash or a string in her food, our very gracious host ended up not charging us for that entree AND gave us two free desserts!  So gracious.  I enjoyed my meal, though I thought the portions were quite small.  This place also has a very classy yet casual feel about it and is both spacey and intimate.  Add some great service to the mix, and I'd say that this was a great introduction to Chicago fine dining for this West Coast kid.",0.9989,0.732,0.243,0.025,0.6327380952380952

What I disliked about blackbird. 1.  They had to move the table for each person to get to the wall seating.  It was fine for when we sat down and there was no one at the tables next to us, but later in the evening when I had to go to the bathroom and the restaurant was packed - it was a little embarrassing.  And I'm a pretty normal sized girl, so it wasn't an unusual situation for the restaurant. 2.  The prices.  Like other posters, I don't know that the meal was worthy of how much we paid, but if my husband and I had more money to spare this probably wouldn't even be an issue.

Desserts - Walnut cake - Okay, a little on the dry side.  Coconut panna cotta - worst of the four ordered, but again, I'm not a panna cotta fan in general.  But I would stay away from this.  Chocolate ball dish (can't remember the exact name) - This was a unique dessert and had all sorts of interesting chocolate surprises mixed in.  If you like chocolate, this is the way to go.  I had the Lemon Curd with basil reduction.  Almost everyone at the table thought the Lemon was the best (we all tasted each others).   I got a kick out of the bathroom décor.   Overall, good meal with interesting flavors mixed with the main ingredients.  I just thought it was a little pricey.   Oh, and I must say that the wait staff was excellent.  2 GREAT touches - 1) They give woman a purse holder to keep your purse off the floor or the back of your chair, which hooks on the table - brilliant touch!

For a cocktail, I had the Vive Lautrec (Absinthe Brandy, Hennesey Black, Lemon, Hyssop). Ok, maybe I had three. Anyway, AMAZING drink with three distinct tastes, first was a strong tart citrus, then, the smooth heat of the hennesey, and finally the anise of the absinthe. The three tastes stayed distinct for every sip. Octupus salad -- just ok. Maybe I'm not sure who this is for. Me, I love the taste and texture of octupus and was excited to see the choice on the menu. On the other hand, it was braised so long and slow that it neither tasted of octupus nor had the expected toothiness. Meh. Two others at the table ordered the sweetbreads, and normally, you can't keep me away, but at a place like this I have rules about not ordering the same thing as others in case I need a plan b. They apparently loved them since I never got a bite. Perhaps the reason I never tasted the sweetbreads was that I also ordered the ""roasted"" foie gras and it was so good I actually shut up and concentrated on hoarding my own food for 10 mins. For an entree I got the veal chop and it was delicious, cooked on the rare side of medium rare. The baked brioche was only ok -- next time I'll have the cheese plate.

The service was rather poor - we sat at our table for a good five minutes before anyone even bothered to ask us if we wanted something to drink. It was not very busy, and people all around us were getting service - why weren't we? The food was nothing special. It was our first experience at ""fine' dining.

2009-12-21,3.0,"For this review I will ""adopt"" the persona of one who had his first upscale dining experience.  Blackbird looks awesome-all modern and sleek, but you knew that already. So much white! So much chrome! And, you get to have the illusion of eating on a nice, white table cloth. I will now spread butcher's paper over my table cloth at home and tell my friends this is how they do it in the big city (I kid, I understand the practicality of this-especially since I spilt things on the paper...). I was actually a little surprised that the hostess staff were incredibly friendly and did not turn us away at the door, even though we were dressed like sexy, intelligent hoboes.  After a few over-priced bottled beers (GI-Matilda and 2 bros Ebel's Weiss, which were delicious), we decided to go for almost the entire Prix Frixe menu between the two of us. She-acorn squash butternut soup with scallops, sturgeon, and the chocolate pave. Me-baby octopus confit, pheasant & sausage, and lemon sorbet. Mine definitely does not ""align"" for the optimal connection of philosophy and eating, but whatevs... Her soup was complex, slightly elegant, and hearty. My octopus was cooked perfectly, but I found the chic peas to be annoyingly dry.  Her sturgeon was succulent, dainty, and pretty much perfect. My pheasant was good enough, the sausage waaay stronger than the pheasant, and the sauce, heavily sweet and a little strong for the whole of the dish. The yam business going on underneath it all was quite tasty though. Whatever were the opaque orbs on my plate (my selection isn't on the online menu and my memory is faulty on this point), I found to be a distraction, annoyingly bland, and were soon banished to the corner of my plate to think about what they have done.  Her chocolate pave was delicious and looked bad-ass. My lemon sorbet was indeed lemon sorbet...with a lemon to the power of lemon taste. I did really like the candied lemon peel. I finished it all, but it was unbelievably lemony...big headed Giada would have died for it.  The wait staff were pretty spot on. Their timing was good, and they treated us with just enough niceness for us not to feel awkward, but with enough practiced professionalism to keep an almost haughty, barrier between us. It lets us concentrate on the food, and also on the possible faux-pas we might commit while eating.  It was cool to see the chefs at work, fires blazing in the broiler, and the dish staff coming up to jaw a bit with the chefs. I even got to eavesdrop on the hostess and chef talking about what guitar gear to get the hostess's bf for Christmas. The consensus seemed to be that she can find what she was looking for, but be careful when trying to buy technical stuff for technical people, as their tastes are so specific. This is so true. Why put that in here? It was real talk from real people, something that was missing for most of the meal. Overall, it was pretty good. I would like to try EVERYTHING on their menu, but if I came for dinner and the sizes did not double the lunch ones, I would be pissed. I would like to dress up, be extra sexy and sauve, maybe slick my hair back, but not shave, and bring my other sexy and affluent friends here for a nice dinner. But. Ultimately, I'll still be the coarse, cynical bully, who will immediately smash the Jenga-tower display of food with my unsteady, hungry hand.  So why 3 stars? I dunno really, mostly because I haven't tried anything else on the menu and I wasn't blown away by the food like I thought I should have been. I'll say 3.5, but still rounding down because I'm jealous of my lady for choosing the better meal. Oh yeah, and they lose a couple of points for having some weird-ass country/indie-female music on for most of the meal. It sounded like they found somebody's iPod in a bookstore in Belmont and put it on. Completely out of context. Luckily, they put on some Charlie Parker (i'm 90% sure anyways) right before dessert.

2009-12-02,4.0,"I couldn't wait for my foodie friends to arrive in Chicago so I could finally try this place.  I was holding a reservation for 4 on a Thursday night.  Little did I know, two more people had been invited to join.  Now I'm all about ""the more the merrier"", but this provided a bit of a challenge, as this place is teeny.  It took some finagling, but thanks to the great staff at Blackbird, they were able to accommodate our party of 6.  Since my friends and I are all foodies, we decided to taste everyone else's selections.  I started with the Vive Lautrec - a very tasty mix of absinthe brandy, hennessy black, lemon and hyssop.  My friend had a very good drink as well in the Vitis Labrusco.  Comprised of gin, niagara grapes and jasmine, it was very refreshing and different. For the first course, I chose the sweetbreads with golden beets, truffles and molasses.  This was definitely the highlight of my meal.  Probably the best sweetbreads I've ever had.  My friends chose the mussel soup, foie gras, endive salad and baby octopus.  All were good, but I definitely chose the winner.  My friend was disappointed with the octopus.  She felt it was a bit bland.  Kudos to our server for throwing in the endive salad for our friend who did not order a starter.  A very interesting presentation. For my main course, I chose the pork collar with black beans, cipollini onions and poblano peppers.  I was just ok with this dish.  I'm not a fan of mint and the dish is topped with mint and cilantro.  I love cilantro, so the rest of my meal involved me picking out the mint to get to the good bites.  Once I figured it all out, it was pretty good. My friends ordered the lamb, spare ribs, sturgeon, squab and fried chicken.  The lamb was phenomenal!  There are very few foods that I don't like, one of them is lamb.  That being said, I loved this lamb.  Best I've had, hands down.  The rest of the dishes were very good except for the spare ribs.  Disappointingly bland.  The friend who ordered it was very sad.  Very. We decided to share some desserts.  We ordered the sweetcorn bavorois, both chocolate desserts and a slice of cheese.  All were pretty standard.  My friend raved about the corn one, but to me, it just tasted like cornbread. I'm really waffling between 4 and 5 stars.  Depending on how you order, it could be a 4 star experience, or a 5 star.  The place is very loud and the service was a bit sporadic.  I'm going to give it a 4 for now, but since I know what to order now, next time will probably be a 5.",0.9991,0.711,0.252,0.037,0.5652067183462532

We were treated to an 11-course meal.  Standout dishes were the baby octopus and squab, both of which were the best I have ever had.  The wines were all amazing, perfectly paired with each dish.  By the time we had finished our meal, I was exhausted.  To experience the tasting menu with the wine pairing will take you at least 3 hours.  I was surprised with how full I was after the meal, and also surprised that I was fairly drunk as they gave very large ""tastings"" of each wine they brought out (around 5-6 glasses  of different wines..and a desert wine). I could only afford to do something like this once every 5 years.  I highly recommend the tasting menu, but I think once is enough for anyone...it is an experience...not a meal.  But, what an experience!!

However, we ended on a high note with the sweetcorn bavarois--a flan-like substance served with cornbread pain perdu, candied pecans, and bliss maple sherbet and seriously, this is one of the best desserts I have ever had EVER, and I almost never say anything like that about something that contains no chocolate.  The idea to make a pain perdu out of cornbread is sheer genius, and the corn-maple combo is just out of this world.   Finally, though we were positively stuffed, the homemade hazelnut mini-Butterfingers presented with our check were too beautiful to resist.  Down the hatch they went, and they were--TRULY--like buttah.",0.9972,0.715,0.214,0.072,0.584785588807328

Of course, a night at Blackbird will cost you less than half of one at TRU.

2009-10-11,5.0,"Rave reviews of Blackbird made it to me way over in Grand Rapids, Mi before I even lived in Chicagoland. It had been on my must try list for nearly two years before I had a chance to make the trip. My wonderful boyfriend tried to get us reservations for our anniversary on short notice (no, actually not his fault for the short notice! haha) just a few days before, with no luck. However, we were told to come by anyway and they may be able to seat us. It was pouring rain and we were drenched by the time we made it to the restaurant. The staff was wonderful to us. They took our coats and gave us some towels to dry off with (without so much of a ""where is your umbrella, you idiot"" look). They were able to find us a table even though they were booked. I wouldn't suggest trying this (make a reservation about a week in advance, if you can), but they were absolutely great. Aside from the staff, Blackbird's food was everything I expected it to be. So so imaginative - I mean goat meat sausage corndog?? yum! The waiter suggested I try the pork collar and I was not disappointed. Everything was cooked to perfection and the flavor combinations were absolutely amazing! My tastebuds and tummy were on cloud nine.  The cocktail list was pretty imaginitive - I was happy to find rye whiskey in their Blackbird Orange (delish!). A small list of wine by the glass, which was a little disappointing, a long wine by the glass list is always a must for me (the boyfriend is not a wine drinker), however it was well chosen. Definitely a little too pricey for us to visit often, but we were not disappointed! A last note - about the size - when I first walked in and looked at the cramped quarters in which we'd be sitting I thought that we would not feel seccluded, but it is set up in just a way that we did not feel like were were sitting at a giant family table like I feared.

2009-09-19,4.0,"Full review w/ pics in blog. Arriving 5 minutes late for our noon reservation we were greeted by a most-pleasant hostess and taken to a great table near the front of the room.  Water was poured and menus were delivered - both the daily $22 prix fixe and the standard lunch menu.  Almost on cue the waiter appeared at our table and stated ""are you ready for the foie gras?""  My sister laughed at me, typically, while I confirmed the fact.  Browsing the room I was very impressed by the modern yet refined feel - the place nearly felt ""casual"" while the open kitchen teamed with life in back, Chef Kahan proudly working alongside his team. Before getting into the food I will note that while professional, the service at Blackbird was invariably slow on this day due to the fact that a server had called in sick while another didn't make it to work until later in the shift - aside from delivery of dishes our waiter really never checked on us and the delay between bread and appetizer was 30 minutes, appetizer and main nearly 45 minutes, and main and dessert another 35 minutes. Chilled cuttlefish noodles with avocado, red onion jam and puffed buttermilk was absolutely revolutionary with well poached cuttlefish cephalopods spiral-cut into ""noodles"" and paired with creamy avocado, sweetened red onion puree, and ""crispy"" buttermilk chips - a nice juxtaposition of textures, sweet and savory, brine and earth. pan-fried sautéed veal sweetbreads with smoked potato salad and microgreens was another winner with the succulent gland melting in the mouth yet given plenty of balance by the crispy panko-style coating.  Not oily in the least, salted only enough to enhance, and well paired with a creamy potato and microgreen salad with heavy hints of smoke and undertones of apple and spice.   , roasted Hudson Valley foie gras with peaches, peppers, and tomatoes was new to me - I'd never had roasted foie, only seared and terrine.  The chef stated he wanted to do ""something different"" and if this dish was ""different"" then I'm all for it.  Somewhat more ""dry"" than the standard foie, the lobe was easily cut with a knife and was perfectly prepared with no veins, strings, or discolored areas to be found.  Using the acidity of the peppers and tomatoes (also roasted,) and the sweetness of the peaches (grilled,) to offset the unctuous liver proved a perfect compliment and the chef resisted more common presentations that rely on a bread of crunchy component to add texture - instead allowing the fruits and vegetables to stand on their own with the liver. wood grilled California sturgeon with gold bar squash, cucumber, bbq onion, zucchini bread, candied olive and it once again shined.  Three 1-2oz slices of fish, perfectly grilled outside and barely touched inside simply flaked apart and melted in the mouth while the mellow squash and crisp cucumber were accented by the sweetened onion.  Adding texture - a ""zucchini bread"" that was described to us when the dishes were collected as dehydrated zucchini bread cut into croutons (I describe it as delicious) and olives as sweet as honey - unique and unexpected, but also great. I selected the classic ""croque madame"" with house-cured ham, Swiss, red onion, fried egg and pommes frites simply because I couldn't pass it up when I saw it on the menu.  Clearly not exactly classic given the onions and cheese selection, but quite good none the less.  Less heavy that the versions with sauce Mornay at Bouchon or Butler & the Chef and although not quite as tasty, very good.  The fries, an item I generally don't prefer, were on par with Keller's famous pommes and much better than Doug's raved duck-fat fries in the Chicago culinary landscape. warm walnut cake with NY674 apples, brown butter gastrique, and fromage blanc ice cream was definitely as good as it sounded with smooth and thick slices of spicy cake well tempered by the sweet apples, creamy yet acidic gastrique, and creamy cheesecake-esque ice cream. sweetcorn bavarois with cornbread pain perdu, pecans, maple sherbet the dish featured a sweetcorn Bavarian cream/pudding with shortbread base alongside chunks of brioche style cornbread accented with cinnamon and honey then topped with candied pecans.  Alongside this amazing presentation was a sherbet that tasted like the very essence of maple syrup - I found the sherbet particularly thrilling in its texture as many maple ice creams seem too ""milky"" to accurately portray the maple flavor as it is traditionally seen in syrup or molasses.   Discussing the meal on the way to the game it amazed me most how much we each kept coming back to the supporting aspects of the dish as much as the main component - the zucchini croutons, the potato salad, etc - the attention to detail was truly stupendous.  Service issues aside I absolutely loved the meal from top to bottom and look forward to dining Avec and the Publican on future visits.",0.9983,0.859,0.126,0.015,0.5091144160499002

2009-09-17,2.0,"Well, despite the frowny face 'two stars' I'm giving Blackbird, I came with a close friend and we had a good time.  I had read all of the previous reviews and was really psyched for a knock my socks off, lick the plate clean meal. Came mid-week, the hostess was super friendly.  Blackbird is definitely a place to come to 'be seen', the vibe here is fairly pompous and flashy.  That didn't stop us: we were starving and hurriedly ordered some cocktails and an appetizer.  The drinks came right away, but we waited at least 25 minutes for the appetizer.  We shared a starter that involved some greens and a mini corndog.  I could've eaten a whole plate of the corndogs: hey Blackbird, I know that you're all fancy fine dining here, but how about offering a plate of those?  This isn't a dish to share, there is one 'dog' per plate. It took a solid half hour to get the main courses after the appetizer.  The sturgeon was delicious, but the scallops were so-so.  Although they were cooked to perfection, there was strong licorice overtones.  The meal ended with the chocolate pistachio desert; it had a nice crunchy bottom layer of nuts with a smooth chocolate top which reminded me of a chocolate pots de creme. Overall, the food was good, it's just that at that price point we expected more.  If I went back, I would definitely go ahead and order the tasting.  The portions are small on the regular menu as is, and by the time you order an appetizer, entree, dessert, and drink, it's almost worth it to pay a little extra for the tasting menu.",0.9913,0.79,0.181,0.029,0.4399782509157509
2009-09-13,4.0,"With my sister and brother-in-law visiting from New York, we went to Blackbird for a delicious meal at 8:30p on Saturday night. When we arrived, our table wasn't ready, so we had drinks at the bar for 20 minutes or so.  Normally, this isn't any issue, but the space at Blackbird is very limited around the bar, making it relatively uncomfortable for us to while we waited.  That said, waiting a few minutes for a table is expected on a Saturday night and the hostess kept us updated until the table was ready. Once we sat down we were greeted by our server, who promptly gave us wine glasses and opened the two bottles of wine that we brought ($25 corkage, 2-bottle max).  He then disappeared for around 15-minutes before he came back to answer questions about the menu or take our orders.  This was mildly irritating, but again, these things happen at a packed restaurant. We decided to live it up a little bit and get the tasting menu ($100/person) and weren't disappointed.  The menu had just changed the day before and there were so many delicious sounding choices that the tasting was the only way to go.  Here's what we had: 1) Fried pickles with buttermilk puree and green tomato 2) pistachio gazpacho with ahi, watermelon confit, sea beans and cocoa 3) baby octopus confit with shaved baby lima beans, pears, hazelnuts and eucalyptus 4) hudson valley foie gras torchon with peaches, nichols farm sweet corn, fried okra and shiso 5) seared maine diver scallops with fresh hearts of palm sugar snap peas and lovage 6) slow-cooked tasmanian sea trout with chioggia beets, fresh green chickpeas and candied seville orange 7) grilled iberico pork collar with fresh black beans, cipollini onions, honeydew melon, poblano pepper nad brioche 8) grilled wagyu flatiron steak with smoked quinoa, baby swiss chard, goat's milk caramel and lemon balm 9) yogurt sherbet with wild rice and ground cherries 10) sweetcorn bavarois with cornbread pain perdu, pecans and maple sherbet 11) manjari chocolate pave with black mission figs, chiogga beets and lime salt. Phew!  We were stuffed.  Everything was excellently prepared and the table enjoyed every course.  For me, the fried pickles were fantastic, courses 2-4 were pretty good, then from the scallops through the wagyo beef was an explosion of awesomeness. I'd only been to Blackbird for lunch and I'm really glad that we experienced it this way, especially with the tasting menu.",0.9918,0.824,0.13,0.046,0.6282652782652782
2009-09-12,4.0,"This is one of my Chicago meals I keep coming back to and thinking about. I had arrived a day early before my conference, and I decided to take myself out for a nice lunch. I had read about this place on the Serious Eats Chicago Guide ( seriouseats.com/2008/09/… ). It was a little hard to find from the street, especially the door. The decor was lovely; large windows letting in natural light, a pleasant-looking outdoor patio, and everything inside was painted white, giving it a very clean, open feeling. Since I was dining alone and didn't have a reservation, I sat at the bar. Dining alone can be awkward, especially in an elegant atmosphere such as this, where due to the primarily business clientele, I felt underdressed; but the staff treated me well. The wine list was primarily French, which suited both my taste and the food. The bartender was kind enough to select some wine pairings to go with my meal, which all worked very well.  I had the $22 lunch prix fixe, which included an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Even though it was only lunch, these are still some of the most memorable dishes I ate on my trip. I started with the charcuterie plate of lamb country paté and pickled lamb's tongue, with fresh ricotta-rye cannelloni, rhubarb, cocoa nibs and lovage. Of all these things, it was the lamb's tongue that is still haunting me; absolutely delicious. For my entrée, I continued with the lamb theme and got the grilled lamb tenderloin with smoked quinoa, cherry molasses and candied hazelnuts. The lamb was excellent but what really struck me most about this dish was the smoked quinoa combined with the cherry molasses. I never would have thought of smoking quinoa, but the smokiness infused it with a fantastic flavor. Finally, I finished with white chocolate mousse with kumquats, green tea struesel and cara cara sorbet. Again, a great combination. I can close my eyes and remember the crunchiness of the green tea struesel combined with the kumquat and the white chocolate mousse. I really wish I had photographed this meal; the main reason I didn't is because I felt awkward eating alone at the bar. But now that seems silly, since I would love to have the pictures to help preserve the memory. I'll just have to come here again next time I'm in town.",0.9939,0.811,0.146,0.042,0.5620508658008658

When we walked inside there is a long line of deuce tables of 4 tops. we got seated right away and our server asks what drinks we wanted. I got the morning flora== it's more like a cocktail that tastes peach & lime..was tasty :)  The amuse they brought out was crispy pickle w/ sliced tomatillo and dill...i very much loved it....i could eat more of those but since it's only an amuse bouche u don't get much of it. my apps is the foie gras w/ corn and crispy okra and shiso-- i find the foie gras not the classic way of cooking it.. it's more of they sear it right away but not too cooked all the way... I'm more used of the classical way of cooking foie gras. the corn polenta was creamy and delish. my husband's apps is the crispy veal sweetbreads with meyer lemon, chiogga beets, artichoke and slow toasted garlic- i very much enjoy this sweetbread....i would order this if i have another chance togo back my entree is the wood grilled California Sturgeon with english peas more like a shape of croutons, pickled cucumber and ribbons of zucchini's.

Their cooking is more like a clean looking and really simple dishes. my dessert is fried pastry cream with molasses ice cream ....i find it too very fancy of making this dessert to a very looking simple pastry cream. I wouldn't want to order it again..the pastry cream is more into a warmer custardy texture. my husbands dessert is the dark chocolate financier with apricots, sassafras and bourbon ice cream the total of our bill is $163 and paid $25 tip before we paid they gave us 2 warm madelines to savor ..... the dinner took abt 2 hrs and this restaurant you have to have a reservation.

2009-09-04,4.0,"I have a confession to make: I had never been to Blackbird before today.  This is a slightly scandalous admission because I'd told multiple people that I _had_ been here.  I've been to Avec a few times and, I thought, if you've been to one you've been to the other.   Nope.  Not even close. This isn't to say that Avec isn't great, but Blackbird really surpassed my expectations.  I got more than my money's worth, had great food and loved the setting.  I'll be back.  I sauntered in here for the prix fixe lunch.  It's casual Friday and I was looking pretty sexy (as opposed to my usual dead sexy) in my dress shirt, fitted jeans and boots.  Conscious of the way I used my walk, I was pretty confident that I would run across none sexier than I. Nope.  Not even close. Just like that crazy lady in a commercial was falling in love...with a phone, my sexiness was upstaged by a restaurant!  This place was si chic with it's all white elements and Miami vibe.  _This_ was next door to Avec?  Wha??  Thrown off my game by playing second fiddle to decor, I quickly got my act together when I started sipping a glass of complimentary rose'.  Heeey.  That's right!  SOMEbody recognized the sexy up in here!!  Since all was right with the world, I exhaled, took another (four) sip and ordered off the prix fixe menu.  $22 for app, entree and dessert?  Shut yo' mouth!!  I had to have it.  I ordered the cuttlefish, pork and chocolate.  Order in and OCD raging, I excused myself to the mens room.  I appreciated the choice of soap and/or lotion and the individual monogrammed hand towels, but I was unnerved by the ominous curtain directly behind me.  Shell shocked by the incessant previews for Sorority Row, I was convinced that a hooded killer was primed to jump out and slash me for any one of a number of bad reviews. Nope.  Not even close. But I got the h#ll outta there tout suite anyway.  Note to self: never go in there at nighttime.  Back at the table, my food was on its way.  First course: salty cuttlefish prepared like linguini and served with a white creme and crunchy elements.  Oh yes.  I was halfway into it when I remembered that cuttlefish scare me.  Have you ever seen one of those things?  Hideous.  Second course (accompanied by a Brown Ale): the pork.  Wow.  This pork was cooked just right (I prefer well done & sans trichinosis), seasoned wonderfully and paired with lovely accents.  I devoured it before realizing not only did I NOT offer any to my companions, I hadn't said a word to anyone once I began eating.  Delicious.  Dessert: chocolate financiers with bourbon ice cream and apricots.  I don't have to say anything else.  Despite not knowing what a financier was (a banker?  rich person?), I enjoyed every bite of that delightful confection. For $22 plus beer, tax and tip, I enjoyed a shi shi lunch (perfect lunch portions) at a shi shi restaurant (definitely coming back) for Jeff Foxworthy prices.  I can't believe I passed up coming to Blackbird for so long because I thought it was the same restaurant as Avec.  Sorry, Avec, but...

2009-08-26,4.0,"Blackbird was one of the first restaurants on my list of ""must tries"" when I first moved to Chicago in 2006. When one of my friends came to visit from NYC, I knew this was the place I wanted to take her. I made reservations for a Friday night three weeks in advance to ensure we'd have prime seating at a reasonable hour. When we got to the restaurant the hostess and manager greeted us at the door. We requested outdoor seating and they were happy to oblige. The first thing I noticed about Blackbird was its uber-stylish patrons. There was a waifish woman with a pixie cut hair-do and modern space-suit type mini dress on. The men were dressed in super stylish fitted trousers and of course those Prada loafers. The decor of the restaurant is certainly minimalist in style but the crowd provides just the right touch of embellishment. My friend and I gazed at the simple menu and peered over to each other with fearful eyes. We knew this restaurant was WAY more than we could afford, so we decided to budget our dinner. We went for a bottle of white wine for a bout $46, two salads, and we split a white fish entree and shared a dessert. The server was more than happy to split our entree and was never snooty about it. Our salads were amazing and as a suprise our server brought out two full entrees. He indicated that the chef wanted us each to have our own portion - splitting the entree would do the white fish no justice. SCORE! We were completely satisfied at the end of our meal even though we knew we'd have to starve the rest of the week for what we had spent on dinner alone that night (~140 with tax and tip). I've been to Blackbird twice more for their lunch specials. Once for the $22 prefix, and once for the $14 dollar sandwich deal. The $22 prefix is a great value and a little more than I could eat during lunch! The time I went for the $14 salad/sandwich deal, I was a little disappointed with the service. My friend and I both had the white fish sandwich - which is to DIE for. And the meal was topped off with to-go boxes filled with three donuts - which were more like profiteroles without the ice cream. We decided we wanted to stay and have coffee with our donuts and he seemed a bit...annoyed. The restaurant was nearly empty, so I didn't see what the passive aggressiveness was about. We didn't let it get to us, but if your restaurant is offering a $14 lunch special - deal with it.  Anyway, the 4 stars is just because I can't afford to go to this restauant more often!

2009-08-02,3.0,"First things first:  I signed up for yelp in order to write this review.  I had been waiting for my dinner at Blackbird for about a month and a half.  I have to say that although the food was incredible the experience was entirely lacking.   I went to dinner with my dad. We both decided to try the tasting menu and both opted for the wine pairing.  The amuse bouche was a duck sausage corn dog which although tasty was quite oily. I understand that it was a corn dog but... maybe what I am trying to say is that a deep fried duck sausage is not the best choice to start off a meal. The Appetizer courses (1-3) were chilled cuttlefish noodles, pistachio gazpacho, and roasted foie gras.  Excellent. The cuttlefish was on the right side of salty while the buttermilk provided a perfect contrast. The trout caviar popped both on the plate and on my palate.  The gazpacho was creamy and nothing like the tomato heavy gazpachos of Spain.  The foie gras was unbelievable. Rich, velvety, and perfectly balanced by the clean taste of the corn puree.  The fried okra was completely superfluous but was damn good. The dinner courses (4-7) were scallop, sea bass, pork belly (by request) and the wagyu beef.  To be quite honest the scallop was the one non-dessert dish the whole night that felt, meh.  I love scallops and cook them all the time.  I have cooked better scallops. Completely forgettable.  The sea bass was great.  The fish was cooked perfectly the skin gave the plate a much needed crunch (or crisp as it were) and the accompanied vegetables (heirloom tomatoes and tomatillos) were the best vegetables of the night.  The pork belly, which I requested to the server at the start of the meal replaced what would have been the lamb chop.  Pork is greater than Lamb so I was cool with that.  I was not disappointed. Succulent, juicy, and perfectly complemented by the crispy shrimp--head, tail and all.  The wagyu was, well, wagyu.  It was a flat iron which  is a shoulder cut and one used  by chefs to bring high quality wagyu beef to the masses.  I say keep that stuff coming because this piece of shoulder was as tender as most pieces of tenderloin that I have had.  The smoked quinoa was wonderful and cooked perfectly (al dente pasta would be a perfect analogy). The final three courses (8-10) were the dessert courses.  The first of which was a lemon sorbet which was a nice palate cleanser that posed as a dessert.  Forgettable but served its function which was to provide a nice transition to the real dessert the ninth course Ricotta Fritters.  WOW.  I am not a huge dessert person but this was tasty. (The fact that it was fried cheese doesn't hurt).  It came with campari and pine nut ice cream.  I tasted the campari, the pine nuts not so much... until i realized a few stray pine nuts on the bottom of the plate.  I noticed them because i was literally trying to scrape the last bits off of this plate. Best dessert I have had in a while.  Almost kind of made me wish it was last because the tenth course was a let down compared to this.  The dark chocolate financier was good.  But after those fritters all I could think about was more fritters. I gave the majority of this plate to my dad. At this point I am sure you are thinking:  1.) This review is way to long and 2.) How could you only give this place 3 stars? It sounded like you loved it.   Here is why:  I took my dad out to dinner, i.e., I payed, but the whole night it felt like the server expected him to pay and treated him as such. **Note to nice restaurants don't assume the older person or the person you expect to pay is in fact paying its quite presumptuous and rude.** The server was good but it always felt like he was rushed into explaining the courses to us before leaving (at one point he did not bring our wine pairing until halfway through the course).  We also did not receive a wine pairing for the ninth course which is kind of a joke especially when you are paying $55 for accompanying quarter filled glasses of wine.  Which gets me to a main concern the bang for your buck.  The tasting menu was $100 per person.  The plates were very much a taste (3-4 bites) which is okay but was not a good value when compared to a la carte dining.  I was not necessarily hungry after dinner but felt as though I did not get my money's worth.  The bottom line is that dinner for two cost $400 (including tax and tip) and for that much I should have been left dazzled, amazed, gorged, and in a state of happiness akin to a nitrous high.  I was not. As a side note:  The bathrooms were disgusting.  I only visited the male's bathroom so I cannot speak for the ladies.  But guys, clean up your act, urine all over the seat and the ground?  Toilet paper strewn about the floor? Better yet, Blackbird staff--take better care of your bathrooms.  When I leave my table I do not want to feel like I have been transported to a bathroom at Wrigley Field.",0.999,0.792,0.158,0.05,0.5782593795093794

2009-07-13,5.0,"Most chefs at fine dining venues are able to cook gluten free. Blackbird is no exception. Last weekend, celebrating my girlfriend's promotion (in these tough times), I took her to eat at Blackbird. I did note to the receptionist in the phone reservation that she does have celiac disease and they were very accomodating when we arrived. The lamest shit ever is when a place advertises they have gluten free options and it is something either totally disgusting, or an extremely small selection (like 1 dish). While most places can't exactly cater to every group that has a dietary restriction, it is really insulting and not very nice (and might I add poor business practice) to subjugate people with celiac disease to sub-par food, just so they can advertise that they have gluten free. Like the heart attack inducing meat-za at Lou Malnati's (their gluten free pizza made with sausage patty - actually my friend who seems to always be on the atkins liked it, though of course he said he could only eat 1 piece before his stomach started to reject it).  At Blackbird, we sat outside, which was very wonderful for people watching (especially facing the people waiting to get into Avec next door). The waiter was very knowledgeable about what had gluten and what did not, and basically ran down the whole menu and actually most of everything did not have gluten! And when he was explaining what had gluten and what did not, his attitude was like ""oh this is no biggie,"" and it made my girlfriend very pleased, particularly as it made her feel normal. It is not often that celiacs can order from the main menu of a restaurant (let alone go out to a restaurant at all without risk and feeling nauseated for 2 weeks). This is a BIG DEAL for people with celiac disease. It was funny when one of the bus boys brought us some bread and I said no need for bread. The guy looked so shocked!!!!! NO bread!?! No no bread please. I didn't really explain (happens all the time) and he walked away perplexed - that bread must have been damn good. If its as good as the bread at the Publican than I am sure he's right to be perplexed. But I know that my gf LOVED bread before she got sick, and for me to eat it and enjoy it in front of her would be torturous.   We were first served a very pleasant amuse bouche (gluten free of course), but for the main appetizer she had the mussel soup (which she devoured - I almost had to get her to stop licking the bowl). I had the quail and it was so damn good - reminded me of pigeon from the chinese restaurant. The asparagus with the interesting puree that i couldn't identify went handily with the sweet meat of the quail. For the main course, she ate the scallops and those were gone before I could spell mollusck (sic). I had the pork belly which had spinach, another very deliciuos tart puree, and there wre some fried shrimps. I didn't even bother to deshell the shrimps. I just consumed them. The desserts were wonderful but not nearly as wondeful as the main courses and appitizers. And the drinks were damn good too (she drove home - I got drunk).

Like everything reviewed that's been hyped, one can't help but go with such high expectations and sadly, not have them met. I gotta quit getting suckered like that. We had the prix fixe, a great price for the amount by Chicago pricing standards.  Through no fault of their own, cold soups are not our preference, so I wouldn't dimiss it entirely. I wished one of us had gone for the cuttlefish noodles. But the stiffness of the waiter just made me hesitate changing my order.  The halibut was the freshest piece of catch I had ever eaten. Flaky and tender, there's none by comparison. The duck confit was neither bad nor outstanding. It's just a notch above good. The desserts were nicely presented. Of the two options, I wish I could have more of the sesame cake, and only the sesame cake. It was so fluffy and light but full of flavor. When it appeared on my plate, I had forgotten what it was, and I thought I was presented sea cucumber for my sweets. Because they were small, I had to take tiny little bites and savor them as long as possible. If only they offer it as whole cakes to go. I'm still dreaming about it. One caveat. I made the reservation for my birthday as I wanted to try the place for a while, and because, I'm more of the planner than he is. But the waiter assumed it was my spouse's birthday and presented the birthday dish to him instead. That's quite presumptuous.",0.9596,0.802,0.129,0.069,0.6669135802469136

We had the duck and the halibut for our entrees.  I normally don't like duck because I don't like the gamy, metallic flavor, but this one had a nice smoky flavor that covered it up.  The greens beneath the duck was also savory and satisfying.  There were 2 little slices of juicy sausage that complemented the duck perfectly.  The halibut was also seasoned very well and had a very good strawberry relish accompaniment. Desserts were artfully presented though they didn't wow me taste-wise.  The sesame sponge with tart frozen yogurt tasted a little bit like Chinese sponge cake plus Pinkberry.  Not bad, just not amazing.  The white chocolate mouse with some sort of fruit sorbet was better. Portions were very small, but after 3 courses served with some complimentary bread, we were pleasantly full.  Service is great.  I would definitely come here again!  Lunch is very affordable, dinner not so much.

SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE: The service was decent, we showed up 20 minutes early for our reservation, but were promptly seated anyways.  Bread service was prompt, water refilled often.  The waiter was a little weird though... he kept poking his head into our conversation over my shoulder scaring the crap out of me.  He also gave us a little TOO much extra time when we were not yet ready with our drink orders the first time around.  Cant hold that against him though since he seemed to be one of only two waiters amongst the all other staff doing who-knows-what.  I had the champagne cocktail, it was pretty good.  I'll echo others' comments that the tables are too close together.  The hostess had to pull our table out into the aisle for my boyfriend to slide into the booth. (Rant: this was very annoying to me... my bf is kind enough to let me usually have the booth, which was made awkward by Blackbirds need to have too many tables in a small spot.  I wanted to go wash my hands in the restroom, which meant I had to take the aisle seat lest I wanted to have to move the table multiple times into the aisle to get in and out... I'm not used to feel trapped in my seat, which is what happens to you if you get the booth side) The FOOD:  I ordered the green garlic bisque to start.  It was so so green... too green.  If I had wanted something that tasted like wheat grass, I would've gone and gotten a shot of it at Jamba Juice.  I couldn't decide if I thought the soup was outright bad, but it certainly wasn't something I would order again.  My bf ordered the endive salad which he enjoyed.  It comes with a crispy potato ""birds nest"" that they chop up for you at the table. I ordered the Waygu steak for dinner.  This was the biggest disappointment for me as it is one of my favorites.  It was either cooked improperly or a cheap cut or both.  Super-fatty Waygu should turn juicy and succulent if seared right, not fibrous and tough.  The roasted quinoa was good, but not good enough to make up for the sad display of steak on the plate.  The bf had the scallops which again were lovely.  The cheese plate was also good... included some nice, local selections.

2009-06-11,5.0,"Okay, for those of you wondering if there are any good lunch spots in the West Loop area, Blackbird is your answer!  They've been offering their 3-course $22 prix-fixe menu for quite some time now and I've always been meaning to go. A month ago, I decided to meet a friend for a long-overdue visit.  We took one look at the menu and our eyes bugged out.  The cuttle fish noodles with a side of avocado cream is delicious.  A good balance of flavors from the salty cuttle fish to the creamy consistency of the avocado.  The salmon arrived with an asparagus broth?  It was a pink island in a sea of green...and it was savory goodness.  Oh, but the real killer was the dessert.  I usually want something tooth-achingly sweet.  But instead, I got a sesame sponge cake with a tangy yogurt ice cream.  Surprisingly, it was a very satisfying way to end the meal.  Note to self: do not underestimate the wisdom of Paul Kahan. So, today I decided to drop in for round deux.  Same lunch menu, a few different items.  Okay, fine...I didn't order anything too radical from my previous lunch.  I still had the cuttlefish and sesame sponge cake.  They were awesome, which makes blackbird even better.  A consistent kitchen is a kickass kitchen.  But the pork belly with apple cider jus...drool.  The pork belly just melted on my tongue and the sweet acidity of the jus made the dish a real standout.

First, when I called, your hostess inquired as to if we were celebrating a special occasion.  As it happened, we were - my husband's birthday.  Thanks for asking.  When you called to confirm the reservation, I mentioned the bday, and you said yes - we've got that down, thanks for choosing us for the celebration.  Okay, great - I'm excited, maybe we'll get a free cookie or something....or at least someone will wish him a happy birthday.  NOTHING.  Not a single mention the entire night.  I mean, you can't at least say happy birthday when we check in?  Why ask me if we are celebrating a special occasion if you aren't going to do a thing about it?  Why?? Second, our waiter was helpful, but not for a moment very nice about it.  He made good recommendations, but in a manner that made me feel like an idiot for asking how the fish soup was, given we were drinking a bottle of zinfandel.  I'm a red wine drinker who doesn't eat red meat, so I realize it's a challenge, but don't talk to me like I just ordered a glass of Sutter Home and ketchup for my steak.  Jeez.  Then, he didn't ask us until we were finished with each dish how everything tasted.  I mean, we cleaned our plates, so obviously everything was delish, but isn't it silly to ask when you are clearing them? In short, Blackbird is like that really hot guy who doesn't want to give you the time of day.  The food is divine, but they know it, so don't go thinking they are going to be, say, happy to see you or - gasp - wishing you a happy birthday anytime soon. Would I go back?  I'm torn.  We don't dine out at places like this (read: expensive) very often, so I kind of want to have a special night when I'm doing it.  Blackbird doesn't deliver on that, but the food is insanely good.  Maybe if I win the lottery and eating like this becomes a weekly thing, we'll pop in for dinner again.",0.9976,0.739,0.235,0.026,0.544066515495087

Endive salad & poached egg; grilled baby octopus to start. 2 separate dishes, both so tasty. Although B did point out that the crispy potato that encased the endive salad kind of tasted like those potato sticks you eat out of the can @ Passover. Kind of a weird association. Still delicious.  2. The amuse bouche was adorable and tasty--hibachi..yum. 3. My cocktail was both cute & tasty. Something pink. Mr. Pink? Can't remember the name, but tart and tasty. Apparently even alliteration inspiring. 4. Two little bites of dessert came with the check. Cute end, and the tiny marshmallow was minty (yes, minty!) and delicious.  5. The waiter was great. I think his name was Christopher.. Very relaxed, and dealt very nicely with the verrrrry drunk girls sitting next to us in a rather small space.  Things I/we didn't like: 1. I think the appetizers were actually the best part of the meal. I ordered the sturgeon and it was very good. B ordered the duck and it too was tasty. But sadly, not 5 stars tasty.  2. The people next to us were falling down drunk. Actually, that should go up above. It was funny. 3. My dessert was underwhelming. Our very nice waiter suggested the white chocolate mousse. It was 'eh.' Served on a very large plate, but not much dessert. Honestly, there was just too much darn stuff on the plate (weird cracker like things, little cakes) and enough actual good stuff. Even the mousse tasted a little strange. Not really white chocolate.  4. The floor shook whenever someone walked by..it bugged poor B since he was sitting in the chair.

Entree: 1) Braised short rib in consumme 2) Sauteed skate wing Both entrees were delicious. At first, I wanted the short ribs in a reduction rather than a broth but decided that it was a great way to enjoy short ribs at lunch - less heavy.

We had 8pm reservations and were seated promptly. The restaurant is modern minimalist for sure. I tend not to like this type of decor because it is too cold and sterile for my tastes, but Blackbird seems to do a great job of contemporary decor while still maintaining warmth and comfort. Our server brought me purse holder for the table. I immediately knew it would be a good night! We started off with the Champagne Opportunity cocktail. It was basically a champagne cocktail... I thought it was a little too sweet, but was still delicious. The amuse bouche was skate wing in a salty broth. It was topped with green onion and candied walnuts. Delicious. For an appetizer, we had the grilled octopus confit with coconut-horseradish, fingerling potatoes, granny smith apples and candied black olives. Sounds good, right? Sadly, it was very disappointing. The octopus was overcooked and kind of tasted like chewy styrofoam. However, I liked the coconut horseradish and apples. For the main course, I had the grilled California sturgeon with celery root puree, Anjou pears and sauerkraut gnocchi. It was perfect. The gnocci is actually fried... which was surprisingly good. The sturgeon went beautifully with the celery root puree and Anjou pears. It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. My friend had the crispy Swan Creek farm duck breast and duck leg confit with smoked cauliflower, salsify, fried chocolate and celery. It comes out pretty rare, which I like a lot, but he didn't.

To my astonishment (and pleasure) and to the contrary of other reviewers, my experiences with Blackbird were way wonderful.  I've had the pleasure of dining here twice in the last 3 weeks - once the day before Valentine's Day (leave it to me to wait till the last minute to make a dinner reservation) and a second time 2 nights ago. On each visit, I can safely say that my dining experience was pleasurable, tasty and rather enjoyable.  On my first visit - i.e. the day before Valentine's Day (which I admit felt a bit more... quick paced service-wise, although I can't say I was rushed) - I had the blue cheese salad, polenta cakes and a dessert whose name escapes me now. My companion had the chacuterie, braised lamb and cheese plate. We found the flavors to be interesting, well balanced, complimentary on each dish and fun.  Even the cheese plate was incredible.  After I saw the diner at the next table enjoying the octopus and then the pork belly entree, I vowed to return soon and prior to the next change of menu.  Thus... a couple nights ago. I had the octopus and pork belly and my companion had the endive salad and rabbit. He raved; I raved... all were happy.  As it was a weeknight, I will admit that the service pace was much more conducive to my preference for slow paced dining. I'm disappointed to hear that others have not had the same experiences as I, but honestly...

2009-02-19,3.0,"I went to Blackbird today with three coworkers for the prix fixe lunch. When we walked in, an employee asked to take our coats. When I declined, he told me that it was quite warm in the dining room, which I thought was odd (and also an impossible statement to respond to, which made me uncomfortable). Maybe I was smuggling rare jewels or had a stray bag of pot or money in my coat pocket and I wanted to keep it close! What is with the pressure to give up your coat? I found our server to be uninterested in us to the point of rudeness. I like servers that are attentive without being friendly, since I don't go out to eat to MAKE friends but rather to spend time and eat with friends I already have, but it was clear that he was trying to be as uninvolved as possible. Maybe because we were drinking (free) water and ordering the (cheap) prix fixe? Just a guess. Believe me, I would have loved to be boozing and eating a long drawn-out meal but I had to get back to work. In any case, he didn't ask for a temp on the two burgers that were ordered, never checked to see if we wanted something to drink with our entrees, and he never told us what type of doughnuts we were given at the end of our meal. Also, when the table of two gentlemen next to us (actually, they were practically in our laps as those tables are WAY too close together) asked why they didn't get a little bowl of olives with their sandwiches like we did, their server said that the olives didn't come with the prix fixe. I thought that was a bad cover-up for a kitchen error as we were clearly also eating the prix fixe. If I were the server I would have apologized for the oversight and brought them some olives, too. Between the four of us we ordered two lamb burgers (temperature unknown), a whitefish sandwich and a pork belly sandwich. Everyone was very happy with his or her meal and we all agreed that we'd come back again for the prix fixe lunch.

2009-01-25,4.0,"THE REVIEW Define bad idea: Attempting to go to Avec, a no reservation restaurant, on a Saturday night at 7pm.  There was a hour-and-a-half wait. People were packed in like sardines in a can. There were people in the hallway and outside in the street. So, I took the opportunity to check out Blackbird instead.  There were considerably fewer guests waiting and the restaurant did look inviting. If Avec and Blackbird were siblings, then Avec is the mature down-to-earth and confident one of the two. Blackbird, on the other hand, is the ""younger"" flashy insecure one. She's the one that wants all the attention. Whereas Avec is laid-back and doing her own thing, Blackbird takes herself a little more seriously. This difference is unmistakable. Perched on a desolate stretch of Randolph St, Blackbird screams for attention. From the outside, the restaurant seems inspired by Edward Hopper's famous painting ""Nighthawks""; a futuristic version. eaobjets.files.wordpress… static.howstuffworks.com… The interior is decorated in formal masculine color tones: grey, black, white. There are sexy sleek lines and contours. The servers echo this sibling's high maintenance vibe. Blackbird serves modern American food which tries oh so very hard to impress:  grilled octopus confit with coconut-horseradish, fingerling potatoes, granny smith apples and candied black olives    grilled california sturgeon with celery root puree, anjou pears and sauerkraut gnocchi   eggplant and pumpernickel pave with braised spigarello, cucumber, oven-dried tomato and cinnanmon consomme    These are just some of the examples of what I'm talking about. Yet, I think most people will agree that I found myself gravitating towards those more familiar and straightforward dishes: salad of endives, crispy potatoes, basil, dijon, pancetta and poached egg    slagel farms organic pork belly with parsnip-olive, black eyed peas, black trumpet mushrooms and sweet potato jus    braised skirt steak and grilled prime hanger steak with spaghetti squash, chestnuts and vidalia onions   I ordered the endive salad with poached egg for a starter. For my main course, I compromised and chose the most creative yet sensible item: the country-fried rabbit leg with lemon confit and brussel sprouts. Both dishes were excellent. The salad is a hearty portion of greens wrapped in a beautiful cylinder of showstring potatoes. The servers toss the salad tableside for each guest that orders this item. For $10, you get value, flavor, and theater. Brilliant. The rabbit leg wasn't like Popeye's seasoning, but it was pretty damn good. My companion's courses were strong as well. The quail was a bit on the skimpy-side in terms of portion. Her Tasmanian Sea Trout was cooked to perfection.  We didn't have dessert. Our check came out to $150 with three drinks, tax, and tip. That's a considerable premium above the $100 that Avec would've charged us.  Ultimately, Blackbird is a solid experience. i do feel bad for her though. She's paid for the breast implants and buys $1000 pairs of shoes.

Ridiculous. Since I was there with family, I got at least a bite of everything. I tasted: ...the mixed green salad, which comes with the prix fixe. A green salad is a green salad of course, but this one is seasoned well and comes with a really nice, light dressing. There's also some interesting greens in there that you don't normally see to keep it interesting. ...the lamb burger (prix fixe choice), which was wonderfully zesty with a spice I couldn't pick out (and no, it wasn't mint--chefs who put mint on lamb should be fired instantly, right in the middle of service, no questions asked). It's served with a pile of silly-good pommes frites. ...the whitefish sandwich (prix fixe choice), which was perfectly moist and saucy (I think it was an aioli) and had a great consistency--lots of times fish sandwiches are too mushy and they fall apart on you. It's served with a pile of nummy beet chips and other types of root vegetable (maybe turnip?) chips. ...the donuts, which are what you wish munchkins would always be like. Crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside, filled with some type of tangy marmelade and covered on one side with chocolate. Don't drool on the keyboard. And they're served in a cute little box with handles. ...the croque madame, which is not on the prix fixe, but since my mom and I are big croque monsier/madame fans, we couldn't resist. It was outstanding. Perfectly sharp ham and cheese, and seriously, shouldn't every sandwich have a yolky egg on top? ...the soup of the day, which was creamy parsnip. The soup itself was outstanding, but they served it with a little pile of something that tasted like duck and was too flavorful, so it overwhelmed the soup. Also, you can add a glass of red or white wine to your lunch for another $5--also a good deal. They pick the wine, but the burgundy I had was pretty nice. Also, they gave me a glass of it for 5 bucks, even though I wasn't ordering the prix fixe. I thought that was pretty nice, since the cheapest glass of wine on their menu was somewhere in the $10-12 neighborhood. Honestly, why is Blackbird not packed to the gills at lunchtime? Even my non-prix fixe combo of soup and sandwich only ran about $18 together. I'm definitely coming back.",0.9981,0.765,0.2,0.035,0.5742018398268398

Whoever dreamed up a prix fixe menu is a genius.  Today's lunch was an economical and delicious way to try some stellar food on the cheap. I tried some selections from their $15 prix fixe menu. They had a red and white wine featured for $5 a glass. I got a nice pinot noir to go with my meal. For my first course, I had a salad with red lettuce, musclin, and topped with a lovely dressing. It had a hint of sea salt or something salty enough to pop out at you. For my second course, I got the organic pork belly sandwich. The pork belly is topped with cabbage slaw, dijonnaise, and a winter salad of daikon. It came with a side of crispy garlic frites. The pork belly sandwich is to die for awesome. It tasted like a modern twist on the pulled pork, coleslaw topped sandwiches populating picnics. Instead, the flavors melded so deliciously together where every bite was an experience. My dining companion Lauren got the whitefish sandwich. The whitefish was delicate against the crisp bread while still tasting a symphony of flavors. The accompanying turnip chips were really tasty too. Delicate, light, and tasty chips tasted so good. The third course is a cute little to go box of doughnuts. The doughnuts are moist and flavorful while still being light.  Even if their prix fixe menu is way to draw people in a bad economy, it worked for me. I enjoyed a great lunch inexpensively for a restaurant I would normally find out of my price range.

Since they started their new prix fixe (or shall we say recession) lunch special I was sold.   The three courses are salad, whitefish sandwich/lamb burger and doughnut dessert. Salad: I love salty food and this one was too salty for me. The greens were fresh and it was a nice mix, but the salt over-powered the dish and took it close to unpleasant Fish Sandwich: This dish was served on perfectly toasted sourdough bread and with onion and red pepper tapenade. I enjoyed the sandwich although I did find it a bit greasy. It needed a paper towel bath and I would have been incredibly happy. Garnishes: Fresh Olives, Potato and grape seed oil salad and fresh turnip and potato chips. All of the flavors were alright, but nothing really inspired me. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this is Blackbird right??? Dessert: An amazingly cute box with two chocolate kumquat donuts. Finally a creative treat with the flavor I was expecting...

2009-01-14,3.0,"Disappointed, for sure.  I ate dinner here a few months ago and didn't feel compelled to write a review because it would have been on par with all the other stellar reviews.  But today's prix fixe lunch pretty much took my Blackbird experience from amazing to very mediocre.  Let me explain. Blackbird somehow got wind that we are currently in a ""financial crisis"" and decided to start up a $15, 3-course prix fixe lunch menu to create a more ""affordable"" lunch option. Not cheap for most of us, but what seemed like a steal for Blackbird.   The three courses were a mixed greens salad, a choice of either a lamb burger or seared whitefish sandwich for the entree, and then two chocolate covered, kumquat-filled donut holes for dessert.    The salad was simple and tasty, but a little salty (even my date who loooves salty food agreed).  We shared the burger and sandwich.   Burger: not very exciting...and small (fine because it's lunch, not fine because it's $15).  When I ask for it cooked medium, I also want it cooked medium, not medium-wellish.   Whitefish: greasy! but otherwise good flavors with a sort of red onion, roasted red pepper slaw.  The red pepper peeking out was pretty much the only thing of color on this plate.  The homemade fries and chips that accompanied our entrees were tasty, but not inspiring.  Overall the entrees were just fine in taste, and didn't make up for anything in the mostly tan-colored presentation.  Give it a little garnish of color!  Dessert: definitely the best part of the meal.  A nice little surprise at the end with the kumquat.   If I could find a sugar daddy, I would still go back again for dinner (note, it gets absurdly loud as the tables are squeezed together...but also makes for good eavesdropping) - but I am sad to say - I do NOT recommend the lunch special.  Try Randy Zweiban's newest, Province, around the corner instead.",0.9861,0.79,0.15,0.059,0.5010356174990322

FOOD: Absolutely amazing.  Probably the best out of the ""high end but not quite break the bank high end"" restaurants in Chicago that I've dined at.  I started with the crispy veal sweetbreads -- perfectly prepared with a light, airy finish and the garnishes (pumpkin seeds, raisins, cabbage) served as an excellent complement.  For my entree, I opted for the pork belly at recommendation by our server.  I know pork belly is so 2007 or whatever but that dish blew my mind.  Every bite was amazing; hands down the best pork belly I have ever had. DRINKS: Libations at Blackbird do not disappoint either. . They have an eclectic cocktail list full of drinks that require a decent amount of time and effort to prepare.  I had the Rye Smash, which my fuzzy memory thinks included muddled lemons and simple syrup.  Whatever it had, it was good.  Blackbird has a vast wine list with lots of options for all sorts of budgets.  Considering the cost of the food, I was pleasantly surprised to find a decent number of bottles in the $30-$50 range. SERVICE: Top notch.  It started with the hostesses -- I think we were greeted by three different people, all very friendly.  Our server was terrific and did an excellent job taking care of our party of 13.  Waters were always refilled and dishes were cleared promptly.  I don't understand why all restaurants don't place an emphasis on service the way Blackbird does.

As for our entrees- the trout comes looking more like salmon (interesting but really good) my duck breast and duck sausage was amazing and the lamb with lima beans another winner.

The fish were prepared well, but the flavors of the other elements just didn't meld together to form some otherworldly experience.

I thought our service was very good. Exciting recommendations on wine, attentive without being intrusive, and overall displayed good judgment. As I would have expected in a place like this. The menu was a collection of interesting combinations and ingredients that were mostly new to me. The food was well prepared, but it almost seemed like there was always one ingredient too many in each dish. As if the chef was trying too hard to impress us with new combinations.

Usually $50 a week for one dinner out and then on special occaisions or every 2-3 months we splurge on a $200-$250 dinner somewhere special.  For his birthday, my husband chose Blackbird. Nothing on the menu really jumped out at me, but all the reviews sounded good so I went along with it.  Since we had family arriving that night, we had to pull out our AARP cards and make reservations for 6:30pm. The place empty except for a few early birds, but yet we were all seated next to each other - and yes those tables really are on top of each other. We ended up striking up a conversation with our neighbors, but if you are looking for some romantic alone time, you might be annoyed.  The waiters are snappily dressed in suits....maybe to distract from the poor service. Well okay, not poor, but not great and at these prices it should be. But we got no reccomendations and were largely ignored.  We started with a cocktail for him and a delicious sauvignon blanc for me. After a small tasty piece of pike for an amuse, we shared the salad with crisy potatoes and fried egg - it was delicious and I adored the presentation - and the suckling pig. Since nothing on the menu had sounded amazing to me, I opted for the scallop appetizer while Dan went with the fried chicken.  The scallops were amazing - perfectly cooked and so tender, and just the right size portion for me. Dan's fried chicken was. . . okay. It was good, very juicy and tender though the portion was pretty small. It was by no means bad, but it left us thinking, ""Huh, that was $33?"" Along with dinner we enjoyed a nice bottle of chardonnay, reasonably priced around $35.  We considered dessert, but I'm not a fan of fruit and every single dessert item contained fruit! Then we considered some cheese, but you have to order per person so while we might have shared a small $8 portion of cheese, we really didn't need a $16 portion.  Our total bill was $140 plus tip. Had it been more I might have been more annoyed because I wouldn't have felt it was worth it. Everything was  at least  ""GOOD"" (the scallops and salad leaned more toward ""excellent"") but it didn't wow me as much as I had hoped.

The wine list is HUGE so be prepared to be overwhelmed.  We went with a Bordeaux that was $31. Servers are in dresses and suits which took me a while to get used to but I actually came to really enjoy not seeing a uniform.  It made me feel like it was my personal food consultant for the evening.  The service was good. Our assigned server was very respectful and always on top of things.  I felt the entire staff was attentive without being overbearing which I really appreciate. A server came out and gave us each a bite-sized portion of something the Chef sent out to everyone that evening which was complimentary.  It was good, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was.  Regardless, it was a very pleasant surprise. We had the veal sweetbread as an appetizer. It was phenomenal. The portion was a good size, meaning not too small or too large.   For the entree, I had the duck and my friend had the lamb.  That lamb was the best thing I ever tasted in my life.  And the portions were just right (again, not too little or too much).  My duck was good but paled in comparison with that lamb.  I had serious food envy.  But shame on me for not asking the server to recommend something or ask what their most popular item is.  I usually do that but for some reason, this time, I didn't. For dessert, we each ordered a glass of champagne. I also had a pineapple-something-or-other which was basically pineapple, vanilla ice cream, shortbread, and a cinnamon crust type thing.  It was VERY, VERY tasty.  My friend had the cherry soup which was chocolate ice cream, cherries, and a mixture of some kind pored on top.  It was good, but mine was WAY better (the envy was flipped to the other side of the table). The bathroom gag was weird to me because it felt out of place for that type of restaurant.  And I usually dig ""weird."" But in the end I decided I liked it because it kept me guessing about the place.  And it made it feel more down to earth.  Cost was about $85 for each of us, not including tip.  Very well worth it.  I was happy we spent our once-in-a-blue-moon expensive night out there.  I would for sure recommend it if you want to treat yourself to a nice dinner.  Plus they'll hail a cab for you afterwards!",0.9989,0.749,0.203,0.048,0.5246914800175669

The place looks so pretentious because it's tiny with very minimalist decor, but they really know their food. Total foodie heaven, and usually places would lose a star for being as expensive as Blackbird is, but everything is worth the price. The menu itself is a lesson in fine ingredients and ingenious combinations. Here was the meal I had (not including the perfect wine pairings suggested by our super-friendly, very clever server): 1) Appetizer: 'scotch' quail and egg with fresh bacon, pomelo, marcona almonds, parsnip puree and american sturgeon cavier ($15) 2) Entree: grilled california sturgeon with sauerkraut gnocchi, anjou pear and celery root puree ($31) 3) Apres: the amaaaazing cheese selection, which not only includes a lovely range of cheese from roquefort to cheddar but also perfect accompanying flavors ($15) The amuse bouche was a tantalizing little parmesan broth concoction. Very good start. The appetizer was my least favorite because the sheer difference between all the different elements combined into this little dish made the whole thing kind of hard to appreciate. The sturgeon entree was delicious. Sauerkraut gnocchi??? So amazing. However, I was MOST impressed with the cheese at the end. Not only were the cheeses themselves such high quality, but the little things that came paired with them were perfection. Also our server was the most jovial, well-versed, foodie of a man. The wines he suggested were exactly what we were looking for. The experience I had at Blackbird was unforgettable. To be frank though, you can't truly enjoy Blackbird without going all out. The only reason I could do this was because the friend I was with goes to the Cornell hotel school, which pays for food adventures such as this one. Definitely save up to go, make a reservation well before-hand and prepare to be impressed. It's also a fun place to go with a group of people who enjoy trying new things and eating different food. Everyone can get something different and you get to try all the dishes that are beyond comprehension until you actually taste them and realize that wow, cocoa nibs and walleye are a perfect combination.",0.9982,0.722,0.228,0.05,0.6215965207631874

2008-04-12,4.0,"Dear Blackbird-         Oh how I wanted to hate you! You pretentious little restaurant with your stuffy service and out of this world food! And your stupid bathroom joke that is not funny.        So my two dining companions and I arrived to find several pretty hostess who kindly took our coats and seated us. The table was definitely too close to the neighboring table but as were all the tables in this place.       The waiter arrived with a stuffy look on his face and I was ready for a beer. I asked if they had 312 beer and his response was, ""Oh no, that beer is too pedestrian for a place like this."" I had been drinking quite a few 'pedestrian' beers earlier in the evening so I am sure I laughed a little in a snotty sort of way.      Next came the food ordering. . . . . the menu seemed confusing and super fancy. Some fault to Blackbird, and some to the earlier mentioned beer. I picked on the waiter a bit about the menu and tested his knowledge. He passed with flying colors and we eventually ordered the vegetarian entree, the Steak, and the Alaskan Halibut. Oh and a lovely dinner salad.       At this point, I took a bathroom break. I was on the toilet when I noticed a shower curtain? I reached forward and pulled it open to find a wall with a note on it  ""What did you expect to find; a bath tub behind here"" . . . stupid.      I returned to the table to find the food melted in my mouth. I sampled all dishes. I have no idea what was in the vegetarian entree but it was amazing. The red meat was the softest, finest cut of meat I have ever seen, and the fish was cooked perfectly to fall apart in the mouth. The portions were small but works out so you have to try dessert!      The desserts were unique and fabulous. We had some sort of cake that was like carrot cake but crunchier? A dish that was like a a Hershey chocolate bar left in the sun and eaten just before the melt turns it into syrup. I think you would call it like mouse but I might call it Heaven. A grapefruit sorbet that was a perfect pallet cleanser and fit nicely with the 5 cheese platter that we also ordered. I don't think I can describe how wonderful this course was, I recommend you try it yourself. I even offered to share with our ridiculously close neighbors but I think they thought I was strange or drunk?       At this point, our stuffy waiter seemed to lighten up a bit. One of my dining companions was worried that my obnoxiousness and numerous questions was going to get him blacklisted.      To top it all off, as we were leaving I gave a quick thumbs up to the chefs who can see the floor from a quaint open kitchen. As all four of them started to listen to me tell them how wonderful it was - I thought I would show them. I lifted up my shirt and showed them the famous Buddha belly!!! My local friend hates when I do this, which only egged me on.       After getting our coats and the manager hailed us a cab, I also let him see The Buddha Belly and told him how pleased I was.        So Blackbird your place is a little stuffy, the tables are too crammed in and your beer list is too fancy for me. The bathroom is not fancy enough. Your prices are a little high but all in all your waiter recovered when he bought the table two beers and the food melted in my mouth.       Thanks for an adventure!",0.9975,0.768,0.169,0.063,0.6114529914529914

The decor here is clean and austere - I remember white was the central theme. everything is very clean. my appetizer was a salad of endives, crispy potatoes, basil, dijon, pancetta and poached egg with a simply spectacular presentation. Only it had to be destroyed to eat it, and to be honest, the central flavor of the salad was an earthy saltiness. I forget what she had, but it looked fair, and tasted pretty good, but forgettable. The main courses - grilled california sturgeon and braised oxtail with knefla, celery root, local apples and curry, and the pan-roasted monkfish with parmesan, crispy prosciutto, ruby grapefruit, and salsify were just mind-numbingly good. The sturgeon was exceptional. The sauce was just perfectly savory, offering up flavors of soy and curry with mildness. The large pieces of sturgeon fillet were meaty and flaky, and the thought that sturgeon could be served with any other sauce was simply sacrilege. The monkfish was exquisitely prepared, the thick flesh soaking up the saltiness of the sauce, only to be countered by the sharp sour cleanliness of the ruby grapefruit flesh, which stood out in such stark contrast to the beiges and creams that made up the rest of the dish. Both were just superb. Desserts were a Meyer lemon mousse with white chocolate, anise and winter citrus, as well as chestnut crepes with bosc pears, sweet ricotta and maple ice cream. The lemon mousse was superb, but more sorbet than mousse. The chestnut crepes were just so perfectly balanced, that the lemon mousse, good in its own right, seemed so plain. The bosc pears and maple ice cream were such fantastic accompaniments to the chestnut crepes filled with ricotta. The tea at the end should not be missed either, as the Earl Grey is served in lovely pale ceramic pots, porcelain glinting with the faintest green. The tea itself is wonderful - opening the teapot reveals large silk bags with full tea leaves, giving the tea a subtle perfume that did not require milk or any sweetener.",0.9978,0.796,0.195,0.008,0.5866754850088184

2007-12-27,5.0,"I have had an unusually circuitous route to Blackbird. It seems unusual to me anyway. I first came heard of it whilst at a ""Taste of Lincoln Park"" summer fair. On this particular afternoon and after sampling oodles of portions I came upon this slice of pork that literally jumped out. I kept saying I had to visit their restaurant. My plans were spoiled when I learned it was ""The Blackbird,"" so while the taste really lured me in, I simply couldn't bring myself to admit to go to one of these 'famous' restaurants. Hey! I'm weird that way! Fast forward a couple of years and one Sunday afternoon I was seated at Hopleaf (oh yes, DO go there :-)) and was chatting with the barman and I was joined by a happy bunch of happy revelers. We talked Bears football. In 2006 - 2007 every time I watched the Bears live they would lose. It turns out the exec. chef of Blackbird had this kind of luck. So we chatted for a while and they left. The Hopleaf barman recognized the exec. chef but I remained clueless. When he brought this to my attention, I decided, that I liked them enough based on spending an hour or so talking with them and finding him unassuming. So I finally made my trip and regretted instantly why I never gave it a fair shake.  Upon getting into Blackbird, I was shocked by how small *it looked*. I should have asked but surely there is more to the space than meets the eye. Our service was slow initially. We literally had the awkward 5 minutes after being settled and waiting for your server to show up. It was a busy night, so it was understandable. Not gonna knock on the place for this. Blackbird's food is everything I expected it to be and MORE! I finally got to eat that braised pork that was still tattooed in my palate. You simply MUST try this. The Mrs. had sturgeon which was recommended by our extremely attentive server. Given the amount of time he spent with us, it is no wonder the service seemed slow to start.

Our server was super helpful (we sat at the bar so our server was actually the bartender).  Not only did he refill my wine often, he also performed some magic tricks!

I could eat that salad for breakfast, lunch and dinner and not tire of it.  Justin thoroughly enjoyed his mussel soup with white fish--I was glad he was so interested in his dish that I did not have to share mine!  We chatted with our wonderful server, David, about entrees and pairings from Blackbird's extensive wine list--he was friendly, warm and knowledgeable and happy that I finally chose his favorite--the venison--for my entree.  Cooked perfectly medium-rare, the dish was a wonderful mix of flavors and textures--the tender venison paired so well with the crunch of sugar snaps, the sweetness of black mission figs and the velvety texture of the bacon panisse.  Fantastic.  Justin had the roasted duck breast with honeydew melon and cucumber--once again, there was little sharing going on, which hardly mattered since we were both so enamored with our own selections...  Justin passed on dessert but I had to try the buckwheat crepaze--layers of thin buckwheat crepes in a fresh, tart rhubarb consomme, with creamy pistachio ice cream and candied celery.  I think if one could eat Spring, it would have those same wonderful, fresh flavors... Service was excellent.  We were warmly greeted by the hostess, our server and his assistant; needs were anticipated, we were left to enjoy our meal at a leisurely pace and questions were answered honestly and thoroughly.  We were seated at a two-top at the front of the house, next to the window with a great view of the outdoor diners and with ample room to move about.  When another server seated a couple next to us, through the glass, Justin good-naturedly waved to them.  They laughed and turned to me to mouth ""Happy birthday"" through the glass.  When other servers are aware it's my birthday and encourage their patrons to wish me as such, I feel extraordinarily well taken care of.  It was a lovely gesture and a sweet surprise.

2007-07-27,4.0,"Three and a half stars, though if I had ordered my friend's entree and stuck with my dessert, I'd give it four. I am quickly ramping up on the Chicago restaurant scene with a lesson in names and faces on the local culinary circuit. At Blackbird, I've managed to acquaint myself with the cooking of Chef de Cuisine Mike Sheerin, who came from WD-50, NYC's answer to molecular gastronomy. So you ask, what business does a food alchemist have in a seasonally-driven kitchen such as that of Blackbird's? Well a whole a lot, now that Chef Paul Kahan is busy working on a new restaurant. The idea is that Sheerin preserves the integrity of Blackbird by offering a new perspective on how to prepare seasonal food. The amuse for the night was a watermelon salad, which seems to be a popular ingredient for summertime. It was nice and light, though typical for a watermelon preparation. Our waitress introduced the Grilled California Sturgeon ($30) as a fish dish for meat lovers. The firm flesh of the sturgeon held up well against the plank grilling, which gave it the texture of pork tenderloin and the flavor of smoked meat. While I found the fish a bit dry, I couldn't keep from devouring the rye gnocchi and guanciale, which was the equivalent of rye mash potatoes (sans the potato) perfumed by lemony, herbaceous caraway seeds. Perhaps it was the guanciale or the oyster mushrooms or simply just a heavy hand, but I found the dish a little on the salty side. I was looking to end my meal on a on light note, so I skeptically chose the Buckwheat Crepaze ($10), which is essentially a torte decked with layer upon layer of thin crepe batter. You could definitely taste the buckwheat with the candied celery, pistachio ice cream, and rhubarb consomme keeping the flavors of the dish bright. The spongy texture of the Crepaze was perfect for soaking up the rhubard consomme and melted pistachio ice cream. I also had a chance to try the Venison ($34) and Milk Chocolate Cremeaux($10) dessert. I only had one bite of the venison and all I have to say is that it was stellar. Cooked medium rare, the presentation was beautiful and the flavor profile, incredibly light considering the heaviness of the meat. I've never been a fan of spiced chocolate, so I mostly stayed away from the Milk Chocolate Cremeaux, which came with a coconut-curry ice cream. Salty-sweet combinations are a trend in Chicago restaurant scene, but the custard, ice cream, cashew, and lime combination was too busy for my taste.",0.9759,0.898,0.082,0.021,0.5479031385281385

It is one big open room with a bar against the wall near the entrance.  Everything is super stream-lined and I like that they didn't go over the top minimalist (as seemingly strange as that sounds).   I was greeted with water and bread with a sort of seasoned butter.  There were bits of what I decided were rosemary and fennel and it was only exceptional when I scraped these butter bits off and slathered them on my bread.  Otherwise it was nothing to write home about.   I started with the confit of suckling pig with chiogga beets, watercress, and sauted bitter greens.  I paired this appetizer with a MacRostie Pinot Noir.  This was a match made in heaven.  It was basically a pulled pork in the most fragrant and rich broth imaginable.  I took piece after piece of pork, soaking it in the sauce and using the bitter greens to cut the richness.  Then sipping the wine melded it all together.  It was heaven! I then ordered the California Sturgeon with cabbage and grapefruit over some kind of cream sauce.  This was paired with a Chateau de Fontaine Audon Sancerre.  It was fruity and crisp and cut the cream from the sauce.  The sturgeon was absolutely incredible.  Every bite I took tasted like the sea...there is no better way it could have been.  The cabbage was like a kraut which made the grapefruit really sing.  I was so happy at this point that dessert was a necessity.  I didn't want this lunch to end.   I ordered the buckwheat crepaze with a rhubarb consomm and pistachio ice cream.  It was topped with candied celery that I could have eaten handfuls of.  I loved it as much as everything else I had that day and will always keep this meal in a special place to recall on those occasions when I am away from Chicago.  I will make sure to come for dinner at least once before I leave for Seattle.  Blackbird really is a high mark in the Chicago dining scene.",0.9891,0.831,0.128,0.041,0.5404875283446712

2007-04-19,4.0,"Blackbird is one of my favorite restaurants but I have had mediocre service from them from time to time and it gets REALLY LOUD when the place fills up.  Still, the food is amazing and although its not quite on par with the level of Allinea, Everest, Avenues, etc. its still a mind-blowing culinary experience. For appetizers, the crispy, suckling pig is outstanding and if you can get it, the foie gras special seared on toasted brioche with huckleberry compote, crushed pistachios and bittersweet chocolate & red wine sauce is not to be missed. For entrees, I am partial to whatever they are doing with game birds and as of the last visit, it was a roasted quail with gingerbread stuffing, salsify and baby Brussels sprouts Dessert is always a treat here.  The dense ""Chocolate Marquise"" with whole milk ice cream  is not to be missed if you are a chocolate lover.

Its the same layout as its brother, Avec which is next door, but fancier. Great atmosphere, a small amt of outdoor tables in the summer. It is small, not a ton of room and  you are seated close to your dining neighbors...but it adds to the experience Make sure to get the poached egg salad...amazing.

I love white on white with a splash of color. The service is very very good- but it does not compare to the food. The dishes were excellently prepared, the chef is a james beard chef- which is the highest level of recognization for chefs. For a 9pm reservation- they were already out of the rabbit when we tried to order it, so perhaps if you are going there late, call and reserve specials.

Yes, minimalist experience.  Extraordinary you-never-noticed-they-were-there-until-you-needed-them unpretentious service. I ordered the cheese salad and a fish with mushrooms and squash that were both exceptional.  But there was special attention paid to every food matching so the end result was unexpected and well-rounded. We had the cheese plate to finish things off and each cheese came with a complementary fruit/nut pairing. Wine list was comprehensive, but friendly and had a lot of reasonably priced wines that you aren't likely to find intimidating. The tables are too close together.  Aside from that, the only disappointment was that I hadn't found this place sooner.

2007-02-24,5.0,"I forget how innovative and exciting Blackbird is. The flavors here are well-balanced, but not at all delicate--they're smoky, savory, and bolder than many other comparable restaurants.  You can try transcendant preparations of pork belly, or quail, or venison.  The tastes are not delicate and fussy; instead, they're quietly assertive, like they've been prepared by the kitchen of an infinitely refined country house owned by an obsessed foodie.  The low point of this restaurant, for me, is the traditionally squashy bistro-style seating. The dining room is noisy and the tables are packed together. It's traditional bistro-style be-friends-with-your-neighbors style seating--not great for intimate private moments. Even overlooking the close-packed quarters, the room is rather minimalist and unexciting (I don't mind this, since I don't chose restaurants for their decor.) I have always found the service professional and efficient, and particularly good at suggesting wines to pair with courses. Servers take the not-there style of service, where they don't exhude any real personality and just focus on doing their jobs efficiently. They're not dazzling, but I am always perfectly happy with them and surprised how much they unobtrusively contribute to a great meal.",0.9923,0.744,0.215,0.042,0.6325396825396825

Dessert was uninspiring, my group and I shared 4 of them.  None of the 4 were standouts, or anything great for that matter.  Dessert was a waste but the rest of the food is excellent, definitely worth coming back for. The minimalist, white-wall-black-napkin thing was a bit overdone.  I can't tell you how sick and tired I am of minimalist decor.  It did not work for this place at all... they definitely need a splash of color.  Also, I agree with the others here the tables are far too close together.  If I wanted a New York City dining experience I would go there, this is Chicago we have the room so use it.  Stop cramming them in like cattle.  It can be a bit difficult to have a conversation here because of the noise.  Do not bring your older, hard-of-hearing family members here!  At times the wait staff can be very snobby but they did soften up quite a bit once the dining room calmed down. I highly recommend the food here, which explains the 4 stars.  If you are looking for the complete experience you may be disappointed.  Definitely a must for foodies!",0.9347,0.738,0.167,0.094,0.547181871626316
