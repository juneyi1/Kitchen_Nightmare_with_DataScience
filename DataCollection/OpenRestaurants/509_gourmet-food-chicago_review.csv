2016-12-25,4.0,"There was actually a good number of people wondering in Chinatown this afternoon.  Parking is usually a hassle.  However, we found a free street spot on Archer near Connie's Pizza.   ""Gourmet Food"" is near the corner of 23rd. St. and Wentworth Ave.  Like many places in Chinatown, holding on some green bucks is going to be useful.  As a matter of fact, GF is cash only, and we only spent $12.45 for us two!   Obviously, a bilingual menu is provided at the register.  I didn't see it when I walked in, so I just ordered whatever I saw on the wall or on the trays near where the boss lady was standing.   This place is truly hole-in-the-wall, very run-down, and quite filthy and perhaps unbearably gross if nothing sanitation wise here was acceptable to your standard.  Hubby and I felt alright and were excited for a little money we spent on our Christmas feast.   GF serves Cantonese home cooking.  We had the following:  - congee with pork ($2): the small size was enough for an individual with a normal appetite.  Chinese-style congee is great for those who are anemic or feeling under the weather.  Both hubby and I liked it.   - congee with pork & preserved vegetables ($2): one of the ladies from the kitchen came out to ask me if it was ok to substitute this for the congee with pork, assuming they only had enough for one (1) small order.  It was also tasty.   - green chive bun ($1.35): the portion was pretty generous for how much it costs.  If you ever want a quick snack on the go, get a couple of them and you would all set.   - shrimp funn roll ($2.50): I saw this was one of the popular dishes.  Well, this is a Cantonese staple and they made it well.  Nevertheless, I wish the shrimps were cleaned a little better; there were a few of them still contained dirt.   - Chinese Long John wrapped with omelet ($2-$3): I wasn't sure about the price, yet it looked delicious on the tray.  In hubby's description, he said he would explain to someone as ""a Chinese-style doughnut wrapped with an omelet, covered with a thin layer of teriyaki sauce.""  He was accurate for the most part.  The ""sauce"" was a bit sweet for me, but hubby would definitely order this again.    All prices listed above were as of 12/25/2016.  The boss lady and other workers there speak Cantonese as their mother tongue, but they all can communicate in Mandarin Chinese with me.  Most patrons there are local residents.  Hence, if you're looking for a non-touristy joint in the area and don't mind the less-desirable ambiance, I will recommend ""Gourmet Food"" for an inexpensive meal.",0.9828,0.875,0.11,0.015,0.4851337448559671

The food itself isn't spectacular but is of higher quality than expected for this price (especially the rice). Think of it like a food-court-plus.

They do feature a few tables and mostly booth so the noise level can raise as a result. They are warm an cozy during winter days. Their expansion during these recent years included AC in the summer, so it's not terribly unbearable for dine-ins. 3 Decor: the place worked on improving (replacing seats) and also added a tv from the last time I dined in. They also have several chairs that are lined at the wall across from the counter. The seats are regular and mostly wooden, but comfy for the meal. 3 Food: the food is pretty awesome. I definitely appreciate the fact that they heed my requests to ""go easy on the oil"" when I ask for my favorite beef with thick rice noodles. One of my favorites from here are the fried chicken wings. The wings are always big, fresh (not all the time, but I'm usually lucky to get fresh ones most of the time), and delicious. I can't find that taste anywhere else. 5 Service: this place is similar to a lunchroom. You order and you pick up the food--- self serve! Like most restaurants in Chinatown you will be able to order to-go or dine-in. I find that I get a lot more food when I order for dine-in. You basically clean up after yourself after your dine-in meals. I mostly order on the phone for pick up and they rarely ask for last names... so I end up standing in line asking for pick up and have to remember every box that I ordered. 2 Price: for the amount of food and taste, I think this place rocks. Your meal can be under $8 and you will be stuffed (rice-box plus other appetizers, of course). 5! Their place also features a Chinese bbq (not with charcoal) with a variety of meat to choose from. They have roasted pork, bbq pork, roasted ducks, and chickens! If you are a fan of flavor and crispiness, go for the roasted pork! The tastiness doesn't end there either, do try the roasted duck! For bland eaters, (not quite the case) try the salted empress chicken. They're absolutely tasty with the sauces (scallions, oil, and ginger)",0.9963,0.845,0.155,0.0,0.5549399674399672

We ordered excitedly and sat to wait for our lunch.  The crab rangoon came out first.  Typical to rangoon, they were crispy, cheese-filled, faux-crab laden pockets of joy.  Then my egg and bitter melon dish over rice.  I wanted to try something I never had before, and the dish did not disappoint.  It was like a giant scramble of egg and what seemed like an especially tart green pepper.  Two bites in (and waiting on my friends' entrees) the aural assault began. Hack. Hack hack. Hack hack hack hack hack hack.   Sneeze.  The woman who I had seen barehandedly tossing noodles in the kitchen had run out, sneezed into her hand, spit up outside, yelled at the cashier, and ran back into the kitchen. It was like Contagion.   Then the cashier started hacking.  Like a bronchial-infected, whooping-cough, influenza extravaganza.   Then a polite cough, cough from the table behind us.   One friend noted that her dish had noodles in it and we all locked eyes.  Struggling as hard as we could against our Minnesota-nice, incessantly polite roots, we picked up our plates, pretended we were taking them to go and dumped it outside around the corner.

But who cares when you got great quality food for the price!  You will still be paying only $5 for your meal and you will leave full.   Recommendations: - What I love are the spicy salt chicken wings, they are juicy, spiced just right and tender.  Oh man trust me its fried chicken at its finest; just know you'll need to work out afterwards.  - The spicy salt shrimp is the best here; I haven't liked other restaurants even though they sell it for much more.   - Pork Soup Bun.  don't let the name fool you.  These are similar to potstickers and dumplings but these are amazing.  They are steamed and have a soup inside that explodes in mouth but the juices are rich and delicious.  Trust me this is a great appetizer with your meal.  It comes with a rich vinegar with garlic, onion, and ginger pieces that enhances the taste of the bun.   - spare rib rice - just like dimsum, love it! - Singapore noodles, curry with noodles, can't beat it. - Beef Chow Fun (dry), fish with corn, sesame chicken, fried egg with shrimp, porkchop with mandarin sauce, porkchop with onions, curry chicken... everything is practically good.

It is one of the best places to get a cheap, filling, and delicious rice box that is devoid of the usual oil drenched foods. The foods are light, but quite delicious. My favorite is the bittermelon and beef rice box and the eggplant and chicken rice box. The rice box prices range from $3.75 to $4.50 and are huge portions for the price. Also the orders are placed and cooked very quickly even though the place may be crowded with customers.  This restaurant deserves 5 stars for the food (taste, quality, price), but much lower for the environment. To sum up the environment it looks like an old diner-esque atmosphere with the floors, water dispenser and everything else of questionable sanitary quality (although the table tops seem to be quite clean). In other words I would recommend take out!    Their Funn Roll is one of the best in Chinatown. Funn Roll is basically like a rice noodle crepe with various ingredients inside like beef and shrimp served with soy sauce. Their Funn Rolls are only offered on the weekends. Interesting Note - When the weather gets cold sticky rice hits the spot. Gourmet Food makes sticky rice year round, but on days when the weather is extremely hot they do not make this oh so yummy treat. When the weather gets warmer nothing is better than soy bean pudding.

For less than twenty dollars we got a ridiculous amount of food; it looked like we were going to feed eight people. When Jess visits, we plan to go again, and this time I'll try to remember or note what we ordered. I remember a nice sweet and tangy pork dish, some smoked and chopped chicken (chopped up with the bones still in, very strange presentation if you're unfamiliar), and for desert there was a custardy bean soup. I couldn't get with that, but the rest of it was delicious, satisfying and an adventure for Western palates that are used to General Tso's and potstickers. And what a great name!
