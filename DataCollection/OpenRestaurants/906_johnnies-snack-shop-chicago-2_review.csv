2017-04-09,4.0,"Johnnies is a typical downtown Chicago breakfast and lunch place, with a couple of exceptions.  First, they make their own soup from scratch.  And second, they have fair prices.  Third, the people that work there are really nice and helpful.  I've been to Johnnie's three times now: once for breakfast and twice for lunch. The breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese on an English Muffin is perfect for carrying to work. It stays in tact and stays hot the way they wrap it up.  For lunch, I've had a Badger burger with American cheese, tons of crispy bacon along with lettuce and tomato, and it was tasty. The fries are just okay. I'd order the rings if I were you.  The other time I was there, I had beef barley soup, and it was outstanding. Great flavor, lots of beef with the barley and not too salty, either. A bowl is $8 and pretty much all you neew for lunch.  They take credit cards, too.",0.9798,0.843,0.157,0.0,0.546078431372549

2016-10-30,1.0,"Johnnys used to be a great place to dine until the ownership changed a few years back. It was a drastic change for the worst sadly as this used to be my fav place for breakfast...My last two visits were consistently poor in service and the food. First 2 steps in the door we were warned by a waitress & before being seated that whatever we ordered would take up to 40 min to be prepared. Not a great way to be greeted to dine. The menue really didn't change that I could tell. I ordered the same items I've been ordering for years. Food was undercooked, bland, slopped together, and missing basics like cheese. I asked for the cheese to be added per the menue description & they resolved the problem by returning the sandwhich with a cold slice of cheese thrown on..bacon never came out but still charged for it. Waitres was not seen or checked in post cheese incident so we sat for 15min waiting for a check that never arrived. Eventually just got up and paid at the register..what a waist for a once decent place that was established way before Randolph St. is what it is today..I don't see them lasting much longer unless there is another ownership/staff change and realisation on taking pride in the food you serve & customer service.",0.3818,0.867,0.072,0.061,0.4514705882352942

About a month ago, it took so long for our food to come out that we were not the only customers who got up and left.  Slower paced service is understandable when the small staff seems overworked (which they often are) but it completely rubs me the wrong way when an order is sloppily brought out and presented to paying customers with no remorse. Only half of one French toast order was brought out (I know it was half since I always order it) and so I called the waitress out on it. She then put another piece of French toast on its own plate and brought that out separately. In addition, all of the sides were mixed up and cold. I asked her to take it all back and bring it out the the way it was ordered. The French toast was thrown together and the eggs that were missing cheese was brought out with unmelted cheese thrown on top.  I don't write Yelp reviews but Johnnie's used to be a prime breakfast spot.

We were seated promptly when we arrived, but we had to wait at least 10-15 mins before our server came over to greet us. Then, we waited another 10 mins to order. The food came in a decent amount of time-- and we ate and enjoyed. However, we asked for a check TWICE from another waitress (we asked her to send our waitress over since we were not seeing her, and this is not a large restaurant... so, clearly she was doing something in the kitchen, or probably smoking a cigarette out back). We waited for almost 30 MINUTES, and we didn't even end up getting a check. We had to go up to the cash register where the bus boy ended up cashing us out. NO TIP, and NOT RETURNING. I can get an identical meal elsewhere for about the same price ($18 total for 2 people) and I know there are better, harder workers out there.",0.928,0.864,0.099,0.036,0.37946428571428564
2016-07-17,2.0,"We ended up at Johnnie's after realizing that our preferred brunch spot didn't open for another hour.  After some serious power shopping at a warehouse sale, we were hungry but not patient, so we kept walking and came across Johnnie's. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the sign by the register encouraging customers to write a positive Yelp review in exchange for a yogurt parfait.  It reminded me of this one episode of Maury, where a teenage girl said she had sex for a cheeseburger and a soda.  Have some standards, people! Service was OK.  Food was OK.  This kind of ordinary diner is not what you'd expect tucked around the corner from the noteworthy restaurants on Randolph.  I had an omelet with spinach, feta, and gyro meat.  There wasn't nearly enough feta, the dish was under-seasoned, and the eggs were over-cooked. The interior of the diner, and the average rating of Johnnie's, gave me initial high hopes that we stumbled upon a cheap breakfast spot with fantastic food.   Meh.",0.981,0.845,0.141,0.014,0.4990303030303031

The food has taken in excess of 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen while the restaurant is steadily busy, but not packed. Sometimes your waiter comes by within an acceptable amount of time to give you a menu/take an order and sometimes you're sitting there for 10 minutes until your waiter stops by for the first time. I've given Johnnie's more than a couple second chances as everyone has an off day, but it's turned into a recurring theme here now. After my most recent visit, I was informed the excessive wait for the food to come out was due to Uber Eats.

Let's just say 3 gals shopped 'til we dropped and were looking for a place that would seat us immediately and where we could rest our feet. It's a diner. It was actually a nicer looking diner than I expected.  The menu is huge--the usual suspects--pancakes, omelets, French toast, skillets, sandwiches, burgers.  And breakfast served all day.  I opted for an egg white omelet--spinach, tomato and bacon.  And sub fruit for the potatoes.   My order was pretty much wrong.  There was no tomato in my omelet and they gave me potatoes but no fruit.  When it was time to settle up the check, I asked for the fruit to go and they noticed their error.  They apologized profusely and said there was a new guy working the kitchen.  I never did mention the tomato omission--I was just hungry and didn't want to wait for a new omelet to be made up.  Refills on my soda came quickly and I loved how they offered to split the bill any way we wanted.   I don't get that a horror movie was playing at 11am...maybe that's just their thing.  OK food.

It's the place for townies not a tourist stop, so they can stick to the basics we love.  If you live in Chicago I highly suggest you stop in and have a meal.

First, let's start with the recent price increase on EVERYTHING on the menu. Someone actually brushed white out on all the prices and increased each by at least $1... And while we're on the subject of poor pricing, I ordered a burger special which was priced at $7.79 on their ""specials"" menu. When the check came it was $9.99... this must be some sort of mistake, right? Well, no, apparently not. They expected me to realize that the double ended ""arrow"" they drew on the menu was there to tell me that the price was swapped with another burger that was $9.99. MY BAD. It wasn't even worth arguing because the staff is so impatient and rude. If I wasn't with my coworkers they would have heard a mouthful, but we were on company time so I it held back. I guess now is a good time to mention that I had to wait for the cashier/waitress to duck back into the kitchen to take a drag from her cigarette before ringing me up. Health violation anyone? As for service, it's slow and the waitresses are extremely forgetful. I've heard coworkers complain enough times to know this for a fact.

I ordered earlier this week  a grilled cheese sandwich , soup and a beverage, and was told that they could not deliver under $10.00. the order totaled $9.83.  I asked would you sacrifice $9.83 for .017 cents? I was asked if I want the order it would have to be $10.00. The waitress was abrupt. I added to the order and 55 minutes later my grilled cheese arrived, cold, moist bread and maybe 1 piece of cheese, soup was cold, the only thing semi hot was the pizza puff. That I was able to eat, thither other food went to the garbage.  Today I though okay one more chance.  I placed my order grilled pork chops, with grilled veggies, and tomato soup. $12.54. I was told that they were busy and could I wait 45 minutes for the order, I told her not a problem since that appears to be how long its been the last few weeks anyway. Order was placed at 1:06pm, I get a call from the driver at 2:10pm that he was lost but was coming now. He arrived at 2:15pm, food bag turned over sideway, food and liquid dripping all over. Paid the bill, I opened the bag, everything was soaking wet from condensation, the veggies, were saturated, the pork chops hard and the soup had congealed.   I called to speak to the new owner Shati, not there, I was given a Manager, who asked me point blank not even hearing the complaint. I told her I wanted my money back, she said she would but I would have to return the food. I told here I threw the food out because it was soaking wet and she told me that she was sorry but could not do a refund.  I would think that's what she would have done with it when it would come back to the restaurant. So if she is throwing the food out I should get my money back.  I questioned that, I was told look I am only the manager, blah blah blah.  I loved this place, it was reasonable , friendly food came on time, hot and was pretty good.  Now that it has been taken over, the cook has quit, the staff is rude, and the food takes forever to get here.   Shati-message to the wise, maybe you wont see the difference on your bottom line because I will not order any longer, but you will eventually see it down the line, because people will not accept this type of service. Just so you know I ordered at least 4 days a week, maybe twice a day, so my weekly $60.00 for the past several months may not hurt your pocket, but if you get two or three more like me you will see the difference.",0.9664,0.879,0.078,0.043,0.4959780734170978

I explained: there are plenty of better cheap restaurants close to where I live and there is no reason for me to make a trek to Johnny's Snack Shop. If I lived on the same block and needed a quick, cheap meal then sure thing. I'd go back; however, that reality doesn't exist for me. Our only reason for going to Johnny's Snack Shop was that my friend didn't want to wait an hour for The Little Goat around the corner. IMHO, we should have waited that freakin' hour. My Tuna Caesar Salad cost $7.50, but I would have rather paid $15 for something that I couldn't have made myself. All of my homemade breakfasts out-shined Johnny's Snack Shop. Sure. We got a table right away. But there were folks sitting a few tables over who (obviously) were dressed in clubbing clothes (defined as glittery, slinky tops, leather mini-skirts, and thigh-highs) and smeared make-up on their youthful faces who had partied the night through and were going strong into the morning. Next to them were two or three tables of cops. It was a very different scene from the yuppies at my destination of choice. This is what we ordered: my aforementioned salad, cinnamon raisin French Toast, and some sort of skillet. I think that ALL of this food was perceived and appreciated as bodily sustenance to quiet ravenous hunger and not as a pleasant edible experience. I mean, my salad was made with iceberg lettuce and had ice-cream scoops of tuna salad on top. The two or three tomato wedges tasted funny. I can't really comment on the skillet except that I easily skipped over it on the menu and then felt validated when I saw it. The French Toast was made with cinnamon raisin bread that you get from Jewel: thin and small. It did not come with anything except for a few triangles of French Toast on a plate. Even my non-foodie companions commented that a visual once-over deemed those triangles lacking. Service was alright. It was quick and polite but rustic. Like, there was no charm or nuance that is found in surrounding restaurants. They brought us our check and we sat for one or two conversation topics waiting for them to take our money only to realize that we needed to pay at the counter. Nobody told us about that. My friends live over an hour-drive away from here. I wish they could have conquered their need for instant gratification so that they could enjoy an even more satisfying meal. Our only purpose for going to Johnny's Snack Shop was for a quick fix and it was just that. So two stars for not having a wait and serving us edible (but not delicious) food.",0.996,0.815,0.148,0.036,0.5106665046971169

My OJ was large (maybe 16-18oz), and was even offered to be refilled. The online menu that I scrounged up was dated, and the prices listed were perhaps $2 under what I experienced on-site.

Lovely servers and the food was QUICK to come out after we ordered. I thoroughly enjoyed my omlette and potatoes. MmmMmmM! I ordered the Denver but subbed bacon for ham. Excellent! Great diner feel.

2010-04-25,5.0,"I don't know how this place was before, but from the looks of the pics its safe to say they classed up the place alot! Don't be fooled by the extrerior, the inside of this place reminds me of pure old schoiol Chicago, with some great classic pics on the wall. Its very clean and well lit, plus has that cozy diner feel to it, complete with the cooks and giant grill in the front. For the record I love it when diners offer you coffee and give you free refills. PLUS I drink lots of water, and i love it when they just leave you a giant picture of jar or whatever...but thats just me. If you like giant drinks it seems thgis place follows the Mike K motto of only serving giant glasses, as it seems there soft drinks only come in huge glasses built for one serving. THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR YOU! Oh yeah, the food...nothing super special, typical diner food, great reasonable prices...the create your own omlette deal is kick ass! As i think of it...damn that omlette was frickin good! This is definitely one of the best diners I've been to...the servers are nice and friendly, unlike other places where you'd swear you were late with your rent and the servers were the cranky landlord.",0.9982,0.663,0.312,0.026,0.6663564213564215
2009-08-02,4.0,"I walked by a million times but from the outside it looked to dingy to venture inside.  There aren't many options around here for breakfast on Saturday so it was time to explore.  We opened the door and... what the hell?  It looks great.  The walls were brightly painted yellow with nicely framed black and white pictures and a brand new ceiling with some mock tin tiles.  Uhh... someone post a real picture here on Yelp because this was a suprise.  Cops, regular and SWAT time abound.  A patrol vehicle always seems to be parked outside.  If anything, I feel safe from other people... at least it's not a bar or I'd be afraid of the cops, see the incidents at Jefferson Tap etc.   At any rate, the Gyros omlette was massive, great and inexpensive!  It was fairly quiet compared to the usual Chicago breakfast ruckus everywhere else.  The waitress was sweet as well.  This will hit the breakfast rotation.",0.9642,0.784,0.16,0.055,0.4558635808635809

2008-01-12,5.0,"Johnny's snack shop is what every other diner in the world should aspire to be. Hear that Clark's? Take some notes.  It's cheap, hot, delicious food in vinyl booths. Fountain pop in big plastic glasses, with refills. The menu is uncomplicated, yet chocked full of greasy spoon delights. The waitress that took care of us was all smiles, and unlike Clark's...ahem...didn't look like she wanted to poke our eyes out with a fork. Cheers to that! The guys up at the grill are chattering away, and even the cashier was sweet as pie...ohhh. pie. Yeah that looked good, too.  3 people, $20...and very stuffed.  My only beef (speaking of, the Italian Beef is HUGE) is that it's cash only. However, they do have an ATM inside...so no biggie.",0.9647,0.801,0.169,0.03,0.6173076923076924
2007-07-14,5.0,"Quickly becoming one of my favorite diners of all time, and my regular Saturday breakfast stop. I have been here many times, and everything I've had has been great and they treat you like family. There only about a dozen tables so you might have a brief wait while you smell the delicious food on the grill. The three 2's breakfast is my favorite -- with 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, french toast or pancakes and a small OJ for only $3.50. The burgers are top notch as well. Stop by if you are hanging out in Greektown or on the way to UIC... just head over early as they close by 3.",0.9552,0.782,0.183,0.035,0.6221611721611723

""is this the place?""  and the answer is ""Yep!""  It's not the best looking establishment I have ever dined in but if you are in a rush get in there.  All there breakfast food is the same as anywhere else but the Greek chicken salad, without onions, is the awesome.  I have never had a salad fill me up like this.  Well... this is my first review, do people review your reviews?  Alright yelpers!  See ya  around!!!",0.9143,0.836,0.14,0.024,0.4513888888888889
