2017-09-04,1.0,"This place was absolutely atrocious and had the worst customer service I've ever encountered. While visiting Chicago, we made a reservation for a party of eight for Saturday night. We were running a few minutes behind, so I made a phone call to let them know we would be 5-8 minutes late but would be there shortly. We soon arrived and once we got to the host stand, I promptly let them know that we would be 6 instead of 8 people. The host was unfriendly and brushed me off. So we politely waited off to the side for the next 50 minutes, as we watched large party after large party be seated. Finally, after a bit of frustration we asked what the deal was and they said we never had a reservation (untrue) and instead of saying ""we apologize for your wait, we will make this right."" The manager instead called us liars and that we were in the wrong and not them. After us trying to figure it out in a peaceful manner, the manager was extremely irritated and rude, ran over to a table where a couple was already in the process of eating their dinner to move them to another table so we could use theirs to make our larger table. I was horrified. Honestly, I've never seen a business treat customers this way. I would never recommend this place, especially in the end the food was mediocre and not worth the hassle.",-0.9719,0.785,0.069,0.146,0.604421768707483

Our server came to us after we were seated to explain the specials and drinks. The busboy brought some delicious warm fresh bread.  A couple minutes go by, and our server came back to take our drink and appetizer orders. We ordered empanadas and the portabella mushroom. I had a pisco sour. Everything was delicious. While we were finishing our appetizers, we decided to order our main dish. Everybody ordered steaks. I ordered the 8 oz filet (medium rare), which came with 2 huge shrimp, and mashed potatoes in a tomato basil sauce. The shrimp came with the shell, but nothing was lost on the flavor. The filet was perfect and tender from start to finish. For dessert, the wife and I shared the flan which had a caramel sauce on top. This dessert is really rich so be warned. Oh yeah, the pisco sour was the best I've had in a long time.  Total before tax and tip for 5 entrees, 3 appetizers, 2 drinks, and 3 desserts was $200. Absolutely superb food, experience, and value.

Since they were very busy and we were in no hurry, I was ok with this timing. We placed our drink order and appetizers at the same time, and continued to peruse the large menu. Our appetizers came out pretty quickly. However, it took a 1/2  hour before our drinks arrived. NOT COOL, especially since there were 3 people working the bar (unless one was only the bartender). By the time we finished our appetizers, the drinks arrived. Tasty and refreshing they were but not worth the half-hour wait. Our orders came and all was delicious. I ordered another drink and... 17 minutes passed before it arrived, right before dessert.  All in all we had a very good meal, the quality and flavors were great. Service was slow yet attentive. One thing I did not like was the bus staff clearing plates and silverware while we were still eating what they were trying to clear. Were they trying to rush us out?  i will try this place again, but all I can say is (1) make reservations, (2) eat light before going -- lots of food, big, delicious portions and (3) If you do order drinks order 2 at once!

My fault for not sending it back right away. By time I made my way through the meat, I had about one bite that was anywhere near medium rare. It was incredibly bland (not a grain of salt or seasoning) and the steak was tough as nails (my jaw hurt afterward).  Extremely disappointing, and one of the most unfulfilling meals I've had in a long time. They gave me a free flan and five bucks off of the check, but I didn't go out for a slightly discounted celebratory flan dinner that evening. The atmosphere is nice, the sides were fine, and the server, Luis, was cool, but that hardly matters when the main attraction is a complete dud.

The warm bread they offer for free is a perfect starter. For entrees, we got the filet which was good. It comes with 2 good size filets. Don't expect to get a steak similar to a 5 star steakhouse.

As far as aesthetics it was fantastic, nonetheless the dim candle lighting made it difficult to see but these taste buds don't lie.  *Sigh* But here's why, my first time there was rather disappointing. I ordered a skirt steak that was on the chef's special menu, and it was ALL fat. A few slithers of meat, but mostly fat. The wait staff and the cooks, however, were very accommodating. When they noticed I wasn't satisfied he humbly offered to reordered me better steaks. I feel there is nothing more disappointing than the anticipation of a steak and it being a complete punk fake. My steak came with charred asparagus and mashed potatoes that were smothered in the remnants of seasoning from what was supposed to be the steak which made for a very tasty side. Unfortunately, the main item of the night was not as delectable. I WILL GO BACK! This is definitely a place that is more than capable, I feel, to redeem themselves!

I was shocked as what she was saying did not make sense. She was going to time us eating bc a lager party was also on a waiting list, mind you they have no reservations this is a first come first serve and we were there first For being the first time there I thought she was really rude, we took the table she had open and as she walked us to the table we only had 1hr 1/2 to eat and leave the restaurant according to her and only 3 tables were occupied.

2016-09-12,5.0,"After living in the neighborhood for years, my husband and I headed out to Folklore last night after hearing some great reviews from friends who know what they are talking about. I HIGHLY recommend Folklore. The overall dining experience was excellent, especially with their beautiful outdoor area. There are so many options! As a vegetarian, I appreciated that there were a plethora of options for me. Notables included the Provoleta, which is argentine provolone cheese grilled with olive oil and roasted peppers. The cheese comes out gooey with crunchy, crusty, edges- DIVINE! The tortilla de papa was very well executed. The big surprise at Folklore was the heavy Italian influence that many dishes had. We got the fettucine (Tallarines) with white wine cream sauce that was out of this world! This cream sauce is special. It has lots of garlic and the perfect creamy texture. There are so many directions you could go with the menu. We will be back, for sure!",0.9909,0.781,0.219,0.0,0.4658492063492063

2016-09-01,5.0,"Welp, I stand corrected.  I had the opportunity to visit Folklore again, and they hit it out of the park - specifically, the steak was wonderful and more than made up for the paltry first visit.   Drinks: We went on a Wednesday night, and the caipirinha were $7.  There must have been 6 whole limes in the drink, which was impressive in and of itself.  The TEY QUERISI MEING (that's take it easy man, for those who can't figure it out - I didn't and made an idiot of myself) was once again stellar.  I said it before and I'll say it again, it's a good thing I can't make them at home.  I asked for a spicy red, and they brought me a glass that wasn't even on the menu; it was perfect. I ordered the Solotario with gorgonzola; took the cheese off the steak - it didn't need it.  At all.  And, by the way, I ordered rare, and it was indeed rare!!!!  My dining companion ordered the skirt steak, WITHOUT membrane (which I recommend unless you know what you're getting into) and it was also delicious. Service was attentive but relaxed, empanadas once again didn't disappoint, two thumbs up!

They also have indoor and outdoor seating. We came here on a late Thursday night and the outdoor area was packed but the indoor had plenty of seating. We weren't very hungry so we started off with drinks. Got the Pisco Sour which was DELICIOUS (highly recommend) and the Fernando which had quite a kick to it. We also had a couple empanadas which were very good. I saw another Yelp review recommending the berenjena so I got it and I agree, it is on point cheesy eggplanty goodness!

I ordered a second cocktail hoping maybe it was the first one (the spicy tequila cocktail) that was a fluke, but the second (whiskey based with absinthe) was no better. But the food here is delicious, and I couldn't bring myself just to give 3 stars. I had the el filet, corn and spinach empanadas. Yes, I'm a pig. Skip the spinach empanada (really mediocre) and go straight for the corn--- that sauce the corn is coated in is legit. Now, I'm not a fan of steak, and usually go for the seafood dishes, but I figured I had to get a steak dish at a steakhouse. Plus I've never had Argentinian food before, and I wanted to experience as much as possible. I ordered my steak medium, and it was cooked to perfection. This actually is one of the best steaks I've ever had, and I savored every bite. Also, the servings here are huge--- I got two big pieces of steak, ate half of one (stuffed from the empanadas and drinks) and had lunch for the next two days. Even when I was rewarming the steak, it still was just as good as the first day. The spinach mashed potatoes that accompanied it was pretty darn good as well.

2016-06-26,5.0,"Folklore has become one of my favorite spots to go with my girl friend. Every time we go there we embark on a romantic dinner  to Argentina. From their delicious meat delicacies to their famous Pisco Sour. The staff are very respectful and courteous. Prices are fair for the quality of the food and the ambiance of the restaurant. If you happen to go there during the week you will find live music. I feel the band is a great addition to the atmosphere. One thing I would definitely change is the level of noise coming from their speakers while the live band performs. I don't even feel that they need any speakers to add since the restaurant is not enormous. Customers should be able to talk to each other and not scream while the live band plays. In addition, the instruments are already acoustically loud enough to give a good amount of harmonious sound. Besides this I can't complain at all.  Food: Try the fillet minion it is phenomenal with spinach smashed potatoes. The gravy is very flavorful. Beer prices are adequate. Their Empanadas are a 6/10. Chicago has way more places that produce better Empanadas, but overall would try as an appetizer. Atmosphere: The candles by the bar gives this restaurant an Argentinian romantic Gothic authenticity. The place is beautifully constructed for a first date or for a nice classy not expensive dinner.  Drinks:For a consistent Pisco Sour look for the guy with a hat on. He makes them the best out of everyone in the Chicago area. This place has the best Pisco's in all Chicago area! Will definitely be returning back.

Once seated we were served some nice bread while we looked over the menu. I had the Costella Organica which was one of the Chef's Specials. The dish was a Rib-Eye steak topped with onions with a side of mashed potatoes. For $30 I was blown away with the size of the portion and the quality of the dish. In my opinion it towered over the other steaks for double the price at the high end franchises in Chicago.  We were served a complimentary salad before the main course arrived as well.

The dining area's main source of light is by candle...real candles too, not those electronic ones you tend to see here and there.

We found a pay to park a block or two down the way. The restaurant is located right on the corner. As I said above, the restaurant has an intimate setting. A friend called it ""boo-lighting"", yet its great for families and friend dinners as well. The service was good. The waiter was very laid back and insightful on the menu. I ordered the Medio Pollo Y Limon which was the half chicken with lemon sauce. I switched the wedges out for mashed potatoes. The lemon sauce was AMAZING, yet the chicken was very much so dependent on it. It wasn't very flavorful without the sauce. The mashed potatoes were great! I went with a large group, and it seemed the stars of the night were the steaks! I highly suggest getting a steak over chicken if you're indecisive and you enjoy red meat. Everyone with a type of beef or pork raved about their food.   My drink and dessert were good. I forget the name of my dessert,  but it tasted like a big pastry and it wasn't very sweet.

Maybe God's nectar (liquor) is to blame.  I mean, it makes music sound even better and relatively unattractive women turn hotter than molten lava when you indulge in it...so maybe I should eat here and just drink sparkling water to see if my opinion is altered. You're going to order three-four empanadas (which are outstanding).   Then you're going to order the El Filet and shower me with praise because it is quite honestly the best $57 I've ever spent ( 3 X's $29 = $57...I went to college).  Words cannot describe this meal, but you cut two cuts of meat and the spinach mashed potaters are second-to-none. I even think the candles are better in this place.  They seem brighter than everywhere else and that's important when you're dining in Chicago because you need a cars headlights to read any menu across town when you eat after dusk.   I'd give this place 5 stars, but the waiters don't make you feel too terribly good about yourself with those fancy shmancy accents of theirs.  Two of the three visits I was with three women and their husbands and it's like these voices put them in a vampire-like trance.   The ladies start throwing their hair back and checking their make-up in a compact when these jokers come close to check up on the table or ask if anybody wants desert.

I called and was told that they don't take reservations for under 6 persons?? But I was being offered the opportunity to be put on the priority seating list ahead of walk-ins?

Asado prepared very well and with lemon wedges. A tip for groups: rather than order an asado for two, order two individual one-person asados. You get twice the food for a fraction more of the cost.  Service was not strong on a Sunday afternoon. They had one server and one busser for an almost-full dining room. Clientele was mostly Argentines shooting for the traditional Sunday afternoon asado, but people seemed frustrated by the single, often-absent server. It was also freezing inside; the building appears to have a significant draft. Would give four stars if there was a better service experience, but it has all of the elements in the making of being a better experience.",0.8172,0.832,0.115,0.053,0.4936011904761905

I tried 5 different varieties and they all impressed. Perhaps the most unexpected were the corn, which really rung my bell. The meat choices were solid. The spinach was a true flavor explosion (wait, did you say implosion?) Did I mention that each type has a different exterior design, so you don't look like a jackass trying to mind reader the hell out of these argentine fortune cookies? I didn't attempt to eat anything else because why have the rump roast when you can have filet mignon (...and help me, I'm poor).

2015-09-14,5.0,"My boyfriend and I celebrated half a year of fun together at Folklore last week and we couldn't have asked for a better experience! This place is the perfect spot for a date night; the dark ambiance, candlelight, and tiny tables are perfectly suited for romance.  We were also lucky enough to come on an evening when they were playing live music which further added to the experience.  They do not normally take reservations for small groups but the awesome host bent the rules for us because we were celebrating. We were greeted quickly and offered a prime spot in the corner near the front windows. Our friendly waiter greeted us right away and helped me sort through their amazing cocktail program. I was totally torn but he steered me in the right direction in the form of a pomegranate mojito. Even though I'm not a rum girl I couldn't have gone with a better pick.  When it comes to the food the choices aren't much easier... we struggled to sort through the vast menu which had so many awesome choices. We started off by splitting a corn empanada and the proscuitto with hearts of palm. I have to say both were great but the true standout was the empanada, so much so that I ended up ordering another one and while my boyfriend opted to order the chicken. Neither disappointed and it's also worth mentioning that the vinaigrette they serve these with is an unexpectedly awesome complement to the empanadas. As for entrees we both knew we wanted steak but choosing one proved to be a quite challenging endeavor with both of us ordering something we had not walked in the door expecting to. I went with the El Filet off of the Chef's Specials menu and was totally blown away. I was presented with two perfectly done filets drowning in an outstanding onion sauce along with a heaping pile of spinach mashed potatoes. It couldn't have been any more delicious and I was almost disappointed that I was full I couldn't eat more of it! My boyfriend's entree, the Costeleta, was also ridiculously great.

Loud enough that you could only hear the person right next to you and it made it impossible for the 6 of us to couldn't carry on a conversation without yelling. The service was exceptionally slow. They didn't take our order until we had been there for about 45 min. They brought out only half of our drinks, and then the other half 10 min. later. We couldn't order dinner when we ordered our appetizers because our waiter rushed off. We ordered a series of steaks and pasta for dinner. Most of us got what we expected, the servings were larger than expected. One of us ordered medium rare steak and it came out medium well which was really unfortunate because if you're paying $30 for a steak you want it to come out how you prefer it.  The main reason for this post is that they must have completely forgotten to put in the order for the last person (pasta with fish)!  They brought out our 5 dishes and then a few minutes later came by to say that the sixth dish would be ""just 3 more minutes"". 15 minutes later, when they finally brought out the last dish the rest of us were finished eating. There was never any apology from the server/restaurant.  This whole ordeal ruined our celebration and ended up leaving with a really negative feeling about the restaurant.   I'm sorry, folklore, for the price we were paying, you should have gotten our orders right and had them all on the table at the same time.

2015-03-25,5.0,"I've only been here four times since I moved to the city five months ago, but Folklore is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I don't go out to eat very often, but this is the place I choose when I do. Some of the best steak I've ever had (El Filet medium rare). In fact, I will admit I enjoyed it more than my $85 steak from Chicago Chop House. Tender and succulent, served with lots of juice on the plate for dipping. The atmosphere is cozy and authentically Argentinian, and the service has always been impeccable as well. Last night, I went for my birthday with my parents who are from out of state. They loved it as well. And they gave me a free dessert for my birthday! :) Well, after dinner I realized I locked my keys in my car! So our waiter goes out of his way to contact someone to come unlock my car for less than half the price of a locksmith, even while he is busy serving other tables. It was so kind! So, to sum up Folklore: Delicious food, amazing atmosphere, great service, and genuinely caring employees!",0.9971,0.723,0.277,0.0,0.6284090909090909
2015-03-13,4.0,"I admit that sometimes I watch British television just for its covert celebration of small-mindedness. I think in the U.S., particularly within the PhD suspenders crowd (ho ho ho!) you'd be slated for reducing a the culture of a country to the two things middle Americans knew it for in the sixties. Anyway, it still happens and always makes me feel a bit weird - like that time I asked an Indian friend with genuine interest about what kind of food he makes when he gets home from work and his wife smacked him and started telling us about how to find a recipe for butter chicken. At least on the British TV, the mockery and knowledge that we should all know better just barely supersedes an acknowledgment of something pleasant and even endearing about that imbecile who packs a suitcase of crisps when traveling abroad (think: Karl Pilkington). So, the partner and I were watching a BBC culinary travel show where the presenter decides to visit Argentina. The entirety of the show afterwards basically involves him touring various numbers of strange tourist-trappy places in search of the perfect authentic beef experience all while remaining adorably ignorant. (""Gasp! The Argentines eat feedlot cattle!"") Well, since there is a $160 reciprocity fee for entering the country and I don't have the BBC backing me to drive from Buenos Aires to Mendoza, this all left me feeling somewhat hungry for meat. Flash forward to me desperately searching the interwebs for a deal and we have Folklore. 20% off on Fridays for hospital or school employees. Perfect. Parking is street here, but not too difficult to find. The restaurant is very dark, but the waiters will light a little candle for you when you are seated, creating a perfect little bubble of privacy away from the three drunk nurses at the adjacent table. This isn't to say that Folklore is a dive - far from it. The restaurant definitely has an upscale style - brushed copper and wood - the house staff is friendly and attentive, but not intrusive, and in general, I felt well-cared for, but at ease. To wit, jeans and a T-shirt, and you don't spend the entire time trying not to look like an idiot in front of your waiter. We ended up sharing an empanada and getting a parrillada for two with ALL THE CHIMICHURRI. My favorites: the sweetbreads and short ribs. So much meat. Beef needs were met. We had leftovers.  When we got in the car, we were already talking about going back. Only downside: could have probably used some salad because anticipating constipation is horrible. Then again, as long as we're talking about travel, this is probably about as authentic as the experience can get.

The first time here we dined in. The service was very attentive and I absolutely loved the romantic decor. It has a dark atmosphere with real tall wick candles lot at each table. There was complimentary bread service, which tasted delicious. The bread came out hot, light, and buttery with a slight crisp to it. We ordered a few empanadas to share and agreed that the corn was the standout. For my entree, I got the tortilla de papas. Honestly, it was a little disappointing and I would not recommend you order it unless bland, dry food is your thing. I probably just didn't order the right menu item that time. They also brought us complimentary salads, which was great! The second time here we carried out our meal. We arrived, told the host we wanted to order food to carry out, then he informed the guy behind the bar, who poured us water while we waited. For a little under $20, we got seven empanadas for $2.50 each. What a great deal! We enjoyed eating those from the comfort of the apartment. These are honestly the BEST empanadas I have ever had. The corn is still my favorite, but the spinach and cheese is also a leading contender. I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend does and he declared the beef is the best, complete with beef, egg, and cheese.

The salad was very dull...Just green leaf lettuce with a few raw onion slices and soggy tomatoes. Not much effort. I ordered a boneless chicken breast with veggies. The best part of the dish was chimichurri sauce on the side, (which I believe is olive oil with lots of herbs). I just poured it on top of my chicken (it was rather tough) and the veggies and it made the dish so much better.

2015-02-23,4.0,"Folklore and Tango Sur are owned by the same people and are almost identical, except that Folklore has a full bar whereas Tango Sur is BYOB. Our party of four tried to get a table at Tango Sur on Saturday night at around 7pm, but it was packed with a long wait, so we called Folklore, they had a little more availability, so we headed there. Neither restaurant accepts reservations for parties of less than 6 people, so if you want to be seated right away, you should get there by 5:30pm or go much later. For drinks, we had caipirinhas ($9) and pisco sours ($12), both were great and artistically made. The antipasto ($10) wasn't as good as we've had it at Tango Sur. The meats and cheeses were cut in thick chunks instead of thin slices. The four of us shared everything and ordered medium rare. We all received simple salads of lettuce and tomato, served with oil and vinegar before the entrees. The Vacio ($22 flap meat) was delicious. The Churrasco ($20 sirloin steak) didn't look very appetizing, but it tasted good. The Para Dos ($40 combo for 2 of short ribs, flap meat, chorizo, morcilla and sweetbreads) was awesome, except for the morcilla (blood sausage) which we never like anywhere. Don't be afraid of the sweetbreads, the texture is like crispy breaded and fried calamari, but more tender. The flan is the best I've ever had, order it even if you are stuffed! Overall, the service seemed a bit better than Tango Sur. All the food was plenty, even for 4 carnivores. We had leftovers to take home. If you want to bring your own wine, it's a corkage fee of $10. Our bill for 4 came out to $200 including the tip, which was reasonable considering all the food.",0.9838,0.833,0.124,0.043,0.541904761904762

I used to live in Argentina so I was excited to try another Argentine restaurant in Chicago. The decor is very industrial-chic. To start we had 2 empanadas corn and beef. Both very delicious. For my entree I actually ordered to starters..chorizo and the tortilla de papa. The chorizo was awesome and came with great chimi churri sauce. The tortilla was a little dry so I didn't eat much of it (this is the only reason why I did not give a 5 star rating). I have had a lot of tortilla so I am familiar with it's consistency and what the ""moisture level"" should be. I wasn't too bothered because I ate so much during the other parts of my meal (the table bread was warm, toasted, and yummy)! One of the best parts was the pisco sour cocktail. It was frothy and sweet. I could have had about 10 of them but I settled for one. :) Overall, I would recommend Folklore and plan on returning. :)",0.979,0.838,0.162,0.0,0.5223484848484848

We finally had one of those nights where there was so much snow and I was THRILLED to have found a parking space that was already shoveled out without any pesky dibs chairs in my way. There was no way I was going to surrender my precious parking spot to go somewhere for dinner. Folklore was a no-brainer. We were seated right away on a Friday evening, which was great because I was hungry.  I noticed the romantic atmosphere right away. There are tall candlesticks on every table. Our host lit the candle as we were taking our seats. Not to be cheesy, but gazing into my date's eyes over candlelight had a great romantic vibe to it. We were provided with a basket of warm, soft, fluffy bread to enjoy while we perused the menu. This was perfect bread. I couldn't tell if they make the bread on the premises, but I was impressed by it. There were little plastic containers of butter, also. We decided on two empanadas to share as a starter. The gf doesn't eat meat, so we were stuck with spinach and corn. The corn was definitely the stand-out; I highly recommend ordering that one. The spinach one was decent; it had a lot of spinach in it, but it lacked flavor. the braided crust was amazing, though--crispy and light.   I ordered a dish with an Italian name (which confused me a little because this is an Argentinian place) that was basically a meat party in my mouth with ham, beef, and mozzarella. My meal was pretty darn good and I felt like I got a filling portion for $19. As hungry as I thought I was, I ended up bringing leftovers home. I guess that's what I get for filling up on bread. My girlfriend had some kind of potato tortilla, which looked like a massive solid omelet/skillet. I thought it lacked flavor, though. It could use some hot sauce! I wished they had some type of condiment options to add spiciness to the food.  I'm definitely going to be back here. That corn empanada is the best one I've ever had. We identified Folklore as the perfect place to enjoy a drink, the aforementioned empanadas, and maybe even dessert.

I am not going to be biased in this review even though I do have extended relatives out in Argentina. Lol.  Place of business/location: Restaurant has a location in the gentrified street called Division St. Division had been an impovershed area back in the 1990s. I am totally culture shocked by the rapid real estate development in this street area. Wow. Division may become the new ""Rush"" st of Chicago. Parking may be a frustration for first timers so please arrive early to get off street parking. The restaurant has a nice decor and can be seen on the corner street.  You can get off from the I-94 expressway. I give a rate of 4 .  Hours of Operation: Restaurant caters the dinner niche and opens late afternoon around 5pm-11pm. I give a rate of 4.  Pricing: Pricing is moderate for this restaurant ranging from $10-$70. The restaurant has reasonable rates for the food compared to other places like Mortons or Gibson. They offer good quality steak at a competitive price. I give a rate of 5.  Food/Cuisine: If you know a little bit about Argentina, the country has an european immigrant population. The restaurant will have familiar Italian dishes along with Argentinian foods . I had a 12 oz steak along with vegetables, garlic , and potatoes. I had ordered the steak to be medium and it was tender/juicy. You could taste the delicious steak from the sauce. I give a rate of 5.  Mgmt/Staff service: The staff had delivered the food on time and always brought attention to any of our questions. I give a rate of 4.  Sanitation: The restaurant had been clean and restrooms in proper sanitary condition. Tables had been clean as well. I give a rate of 5.  Ambiance: The ambiance was good with the background music and environment. People had been very happy dining in the restaurant. The environment gives a great dining experience with a glass of red wine after a good steak. I give a rate of 4.

We called at 4pm and confirmed our reservation and spoke with the restaurant about how our party went from 8 people down to 5 people. The person we spoke with said it would not be a problem.  We arrived a few minutes before 9 and checked in. The host had no record of our party being changed and then told us he would be able seat us in 30 minutes. We spoke with him explaining that we had called earlier about our reservation and were told not a problem. The server then told us he tells everyone 30 minutes because he does not like people coming up to him all the time checking on their table if he tells them a lesser amount of time. He said we would probably be seated in 5-10 minutes, but he says 30 minutes to be safe. He was quite arrogant and stuck up when talking to us which was unfortunate as we came to celebrate someone's golden birthday.  We found spots to stand near the bar which was fortunate as the place was overcrowded. I am certain the place was over capacity. We waited quite a long time for our drinks, but they tasted fine. The entire time, we saw a table set for 6 sit empty. There were others waited to be seated besides us. We asked the host about the empty table and he said he was waiting to seat a party of 16 there.  It was quite frustrating to be treated so poorly at a restaurant we had such high hopes for. The food we saw at other tables looked and smelled delicious. We finally left the restaurant and went down the block and found Mirai, a sushi restaurant. We were seated immediately, served drinks immediately and treated like royalty. The food was wonderful. Two members of our group had never tried sushi before and this was a great place to convince them to give it a try and they loved it. I will probably avoid this place and Tango Sur like the plague now. No one deserves to be treated like crap when you are willing to spend a lot of money at your restaurant.",0.9191,0.769,0.126,0.105,0.5655820105820107

Service was pretty good.  Our waiter was helpful in pointing towards the favorites on the menu.  We ordered a bottle of malbec and took advantage of the Tuesday special (half off bottles of wine).  It was a good bottle of wine for the Tuesday special but I would have been disappointed if we paid full price for it.  The food was solid. We started off with beef and chicken empanadas.  They were really good and I liked the chimichurri sauce with them.  For dinner, we split the half chicken and the skirt steak.  It came with a basic salad which was okay.  The chicken was nice and juicy from the white wine sauce.  It was good but nothing to write home about. The steak was perfectly cooked and was very juicy.  The portions were fairly large and we had a lunch in leftovers.  We found ourselves comparing Folklore to Tango Sur finding that Tango Sur on top particularly because of the BYOB. With the half-priced bottle  of wine, it was $100 with tip.  We would go back, but for the price (especially with no wine special), other places are higher on the list.",0.9846,0.793,0.179,0.028,0.5526413690476191

I sneaked a peak at the reservation list and it was mighty long. We got in and were seated right away.     Let me explain the ambiance. It's dark in there. The tables aren't too close together but I will say it is packed and loud on Friday and Saturday nights. There are candles at every table. It's super romantic but also a place you can bring kids to. Not too young though. We've been here with our 13 year-old son.        We were given fresh, out of the oven, bread. Warm tiny little French breads and they are soft and warm. Did I mention they were warm? Our waiter popped our wine right away. Did I mention this place is BYOB??? Yes, it's amazing . There is a $10 corking fee per bottle. Not too bad at all considering we can bring in what we want. The drinks there are delish also. They have Argentinian beer which is nice and crisp and I enjoy.        Our menus were open right away and we were ready to order! We had empanadas and an appetizer...not sure the name but it's of corn. It's nice and creamy corn. The outside is nice and crunchy. A salad is served before the main entrees. The salad is nice and simple. Romaine lettuce, 3 slices of tomato, and white onion. They bring vingar and oil to drizzle over it. Simple but delicious. Our main entrees were Mar y Tierra and Churrasco. Mar y Tierra is a 8 ounce filet mignon with huge shrimp. The shrimp is so big it looks like lobster. It has a tomato sauce with veggies in it. The seal is nice and tender. Churrasco is a 12 ounce filet mignon with mashed potatoes. I asked for them to change the mashed potatoes to their signature spinach mashed potatoes which are amazing! They brought us two orders.       Dinner was nice and slow. We didn't feel rushed even though we knew there were people waiting.

Mojitos were good too but nothing too crazy. We both ordered the filets. We get steak dinners at least once a week more like twice or three times a week. I get a filet everywhere I go because of the tenderness. I would highly recommend NOT getting a filet from here. It was chewy and drenched in sauce like they were trying to hide something absolutely awful. We both took two bites of our dinner and had the bus boy take it out of our faces. The waiter was no where to be found as we were sitting in disgust. Finally he came back with our check and I mentioned that is was awful. He said it was the first time in four years he has heard that. I leaned over and asked the couple next to us what they ordered. They both said that they were not fans of the filet either. The waiter told the manager we were unhappy who took no part in trying to please us.

Argentina is famous for it's beef, and I've actually been to Buenos Aires- and this restaurant is like a step back into that trip.  I also have to complement this restaurant on it's willingness to substitute items on entrees and appetizers. My mom has multiple food allergies that just developed in the last couple years, and they went above and beyond to accommodate her.  If you've never had Mate Tea, try it. it's a unique and FUN authentic Argentine experience! The one thing I don't love- it's so loud in here when it's full. The ceilings are high and they have hardwood floors and they always crank the music up later in the evening. It's hard to have conversation with more than one person across the table from you.  I love to start the meal with caprihinas or the blackberry mojito. Their drinks are masterfully crafted and delicious. They have an impeccable wine selection and the several Malbec's they have (Argentina's main exported red wine) are all fabulous. I recommend (by the glass) the 2009 Decero Malbec from Mendoza and the 2010 a Posta Cocina Blend.  The antipasto and provoleta are both wonderful sharing appetizers.  All of the steaks I've tried are wonderful. The Costaleta Organica is not quite as good as the regular Costaleta in my opinion because I love the olive oil, garlic, parsley and caper sauce covering it. The mashed potatoes side MELT in your mouth. nomnonmnom. The Filet Mignon is also fantastic but my favorite steak is the Bife Vesuvio because they fill it with spinach, mar del plata, cheese and garlic, and serve it in white wine sauce with Argentine style potatoes. Just a heads up though, it's a tad chewier than I expected and maybe more so than some would like. The desserts vary, and I love that they bring by a dessert plate so that you can see it and then have the name listed and choose one.",0.9913,0.847,0.136,0.017,0.4757464387464387

He took our order and recommended some good items for the people that had dietary constraints. I'M NOT SURE but I think a decent portion of the menu was Gluten Free. THE ORDER: I ordered the Medio Pollo Al Limon with a Corn Empanadas while the others ordered: 2 Entranas(skirt steak), Para Uno (grilled short ribs, sausage, beef sweetbread and black sausage), Churrassco (12 oz sirloin steak cooked on the grill) & Asado De Tira (short ribs, cooked on the grill). All served with salad of course.  THE BILL: $132 but take into consideration we did NOT order drinks with dinner. FINAL THOUGHTS: I really like this place. The atmosphere was nice and the table seemed to be sturdy(at least my table was). The host, bartender and waiter were all dudes but were still cool with us.

For one the portion is smaller than you'd imagine. It may be a lot for a a small woman, but for a grown man there is a lot to be desired. The meat were all cooked unevenly. The short ribs were almost well done, the flap medium well. They were okay flavor wise, the flap was amazing but you just can't go wrong with it. The sweetbreads were gummy, it was my first time eating blood sausage and I will probably never again.

PRO: romantic ambiance, we sat outside and it was lovely. PRO: good cocktails, good beer and wine selection. CON: the salad that came with the main course was an undressed pile of lettuce and sliced tomato and red onion on a plate.  It literally looked like burger toppings. CON: the main courses are hit or miss.  We each ordered three different steaks, all done medium-rare.  One came out medium-rare and was delicious, one came out half medium/half medium-well (clearly they have some grill problems), and one came out decidedly well-done and a pain to chew.  We showed our steaks to the waiter and he brushed it aside, protesting that the well-done steak was difficult to cook and lost color easily.  Lost color? It was so tasteless and chewy my friend didn't even end up finishing it.  And I'm sorry, but the difficulty of the cut of meat is no excuse.  At this price, and at a grill, every steak should be cooked to order. CON: the service was extremely slow from start to finish and the response to our complaint about the food was very disappointing.  A person I can only assume to be the manager (he didn't introduce himself) stopped by after we spoke to the waiter and asked how things we going.  We said, ""Well, alright..."" and he quickly said, ""Great!"" and leapt away from the table.  It was ridiculous, it actually made us laugh!  Were we supposed to play the part of the enraged customer and bring it up again before he got a word in edgewise? I guess so, because he never came back.  Our waiter brought us some flan on the house (after staring at it for 30 seconds, we all admitted to each other that we didn't like flan), with no apologies for the botched steaks. I expected an apology from the manager for our meals and maybe even an offer for something on the house on another visit.  As it is, I have no incentive to go back. In the end, EMPANADAS, go, get them.  They're the only reason this isn't a two-star review.  Choose your main courses wisely, as attention to detail doesn't seem to be a mainstay of this kitchen, and don't be expect to be served quickly.",0.6151,0.804,0.106,0.09,0.4953418803418803

Anyhoo, we came on a Tuesday which meant half price bottles of wine, so we got all up on that Malbec.  We started with an appetizer that I don't see on the menu right now - it was a stuffed calamari of some sort.  Like a massive calamari.  We liked it, though I find the texture of calamari to be fine when the pieces are small, but really freakin' rubbery when you get a huge one!  Good flavor in the dish though.   Then we went all in and got the Para Dos - $25 gets you grilled short ribs, flap meat, sausage, beef sweetbreads, and black sausage.  For two.  Obviously.  It's served on a grill with a side of chimichurri sauce.  Before you get ooooky about the phrase ""flap meat,"" it's steak from the bottom sirloin.  The word ""flap"" makes it sound like it's cut from some alien flying cow, but the only thing alien about it was how GOOOOOD it was!  Delicious, juicy steak.  Short ribs also outstanding.  Sausage good but I let my boyfriend eat most of that because he didn't like the sweetbreads, and I did.  Sweetbreads are glands.  What more can you say, it's like fried thyroid.  And it's SO GOOD!  If you like crispy fried chewy things, you will like sweetbreads.  I ate all of them except the one my boyfriend tried to convince himself to eat, to no avail.  Though I generally am okay with blood sausage, it was not the star of the platter so I only had a few bites of it.  If you like blood sausage, you'll like it.  Flavorful.  A little crumbly.  It's a traditional part of mixed grill in this part of the world, but I see my boyfriend's point that with steak, short ribs, and sausage on the plate, blood sausage and sweetbreads sort of lose their luster.  But ohhhhh that chimichurri sauce!  Hubba hubba!  I could not get enough. If you've never dunked grilled meat in this delicious herbal green sauce, you are missing it.  Amazeballs.

For my entree,  I ordered the filet with two jumbo shrimp in a tomato-caper sauce. The steak was tender and cooked to perfection. The shrimp were very large and full of flavor.The sauce was light and incredible, and complimented both the steak and the shrimp. The entree was also served with a fresh romaine salad and a side of spinach mashed potatoes. Overall, it was an insane amount of food.

2012-12-06,5.0,"Short version: perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked grass-fed beef, huge portions especially for being in the city, great atmosphere, awesome food, awesome service. Best prices I've seen at a steak house, let alone one with grass-fed beef this size! Incredible!  The couple that took us here are big fans of Tengo Sur, and this place is their sister restaurant (they even have a small Tengo Sur sign in the window), they said the menu was just the same and the food was just as delicious. The most mind-blowing part of eating here was the price. In Vegas, where I live, the steak alone would have been half the size and twice the price. For $27, I got the biggest strip steak I've ever had, a large side portion of potatoes, and a big salad. For $27. I saw the prices and expected tiny portions, which is par for the course with high-end steaks. I was shocked at the size of the food on my plate. While we're talking about the steak, let me take a moment to praise a restaurant for getting ""medium"" right. This slab of beef was over an inch thick and they nailed it: a great crust on the outside, no ""well done"" ring just inside the crust but instead perfectly warm pink all the way through. Just past the red stage, just like it should be. The seasoning was also done right: accenting the flavor of the steak rather than overpowering it, but not missing either. Just right. The potatoes as my side were good, they may have even been really good, but I was jaded by the spinach mashed potatoes that my fiancé ordered. I had the option of them with my steak as well but got the normal potatoes as a hedge. I should have just gone with the spinach mashed like I wanted to in the first place. Again, not that my potatoes were bad, but the spinach mashed potatoes are just seriously good. Our appetizer was the Provoleta. A large platter of Argentine provolone cheese cooked on the grill with olive oil and roasted peppers. The cheese was pretty good on its own, but we ate it with the rolls, and asked for a side of sauce I can't remember the name of or find on their site. It's garlic, oil, parsley I think, and capers. This sauce, the cheese, and melting butter on the delicious bread rolls was just great. If I had to complain about one thing it would be the butter on the table for the bread rolls. The butter is cheap diner-style plastic packets in a bowl in the table, and it's quite cold. The rolls come out hot but spreading cold butter even on hot bread is a pain. That's my only complaint.",0.9941,0.798,0.149,0.053,0.5832875457875459

Based on good yelp reviews my husband and I decided to take my mother here to eat on her 62nd birthday on a Thursday night. It was important to have an intimate and somewhat quiet atmosphere since it had been about a month since I last saw my mom. 15min after our arrival a large group of maybe 20+ arrived. The noise level was very irritating and I was extremely frustrated that I had to yell across the table to be able to have a conversation. This definitely spoiled the evening for us. It is also very dark in the restaurant. I understand this is for ambiance, but the only light..the flicker of one candle on the table made it difficult for my mom to read the menu. We ordered the berenjena eggplant entree for 3 of us to share as an appetizer....a lot of people rave about this dish, however it came to the table cold and unappetizing. The other entrees we ordered were ok...large portions, but I can't say that is was the greatest food. We were all starving, but after the cold eggplant dish...we barely touched our entrees and took them to go.....ate the leftovers for the next 2 days. Waiters/bus boys trying to take our plates of food several times even before we were finished was annoying. Prices were decent...spent about $130 for 4 beers, 1 extra salad and 4 entrees. When I called to make the reservation the person who answered the phone was very cold and not welcoming at all....no hello or thank you for calling.

Many good choices on the menu, the theme is meat and potatoes but there are vegetarian, pasta and salad options as well.  I ordered the Medio Pollo Al Jamon (grilled half chicken marinated w/ white wine & lemon sauce & potato wedges).  Others got the popular El Filet w/ Spinach Mashed Potatoes and the Filet with large shrimp.  My bro and sis got a special dish made just for them:  grilled chicken breast w/ steamed broccoli and grated parmesan cheese.  All the dishes looked fabulous and the portions were healthy.   For appetizers we started w/ the Berenjena (egg plant layered w/ spinach, cheese, parmesan & ricotta w/ a tomato cream sauce).  It was really good, the sauce is perfect for roll-dipping.  The Provoleta came next (fried cheese w/ peppers), similar to the Greek dish (whopa!).  The house salad was simple, lettuce greens and tomatoes, nothing too exciting, and dressing options were oil, red wine vinegar, and balsamic vinegar.  You need the fiber so just eat up.  My Medio Pollo soon arrives as it was massive and full of flavor.  The seasonings were spot on and the potatoes had skins and were well seasoned.  Good enough to share for two.   Here comes the desserts, my brother ordered:  carrot cake, chocolate cake, and Flan w/ a caramel sauce - - which was my favorite.  They even added candles and sang Happy Birthday to moi - - for my recent mid November milestone (thanks for the love!).  One bite of that Flan and I went back for more - - probably one of the top 5 desserts I've ever had.   Customer service was spot-on, very attentive, drinks always filled.  At peak times you may have to wait a little longer for your main course, but that's okay because it's worth it.  I mean, what's the rush?  Just have a cocktail and enjoy the moment at Folklore.  I checked out other dishes around the room - - the steaks and grilled meats looked fabulous, some added incentive to make a trip back.",0.9979,0.818,0.175,0.007,0.5254919617419618
2011-12-24,1.0,"My expectations coming to Folklore could not have been higher, and I could not have been more disappointed with the food. The first sign of trouble was that the waiter suggested the empanada appetizer and the breaded chicken breast entree.  Hey waiter, we are looking for delicious and exotic Argentinian food, not recycled South American standbys.  Ok, that is a bit harsh, empanadas are always good, and chicken is usually a safe choice.  We were, however, looking for adventure, so we decided to split the sweetbread appetizer, veal t-bone, and entrana.   The soup and salad came out first and followed the simple Argentinian tradition.  Then the veal t-bone and entrana.  Wait, where sweetbreads?  Oh, he forgot to put them in, they would be out shortly and be complimentary.  The veal t-bone came out and had a decent amount of flavor, although we were expecting it to be rich and full of taste.  The meat itself, however, did not have any flavor to begin with or somehow lost all of the flavor on the grill.  The entrana, which was recommended with the skin on (to seal in the juices and flavor), was equally as disappointing.  Although we ordered it medium rare, it came out with just a hint of pink in it and it was unbelievably tough.  The skin simply served to add a tough, flavorless, leathery layer on top, which we ended up cutting off almost immediately.  I would say it failed to seal in the juices and flavor, since there were not much of either.  The potatoes were ok, but they had that heavy, settled texture normally reserved for high school cafeteria potatoes.  When the sweetbreads came out, they were somewhat bland, and we each ended up eating one before leaving the rest of the plate. When it was all said and done, we had eaten about half of each entree and 10% of the sweetbreads.  The waiter, who was very friendly and attentive, noticed that we clearly were not enjoying our meal, brought out a flan on the house.  This was a nice gesture, but neither of us enjoyed it, even after ordering a couple of cappuccinos to balance out the sweetness. What is so strange about our experience is that everything seemed like it should have been good.  Good reviews, my Yelp friends liked (or loved) it, meat focused South American grill, enticing menu, and great atmosphere all caused my interest to be thoroughly piqued.  That the food let us down this much came as a great shock.   There were a few silver linings to this bad-tasting cloud.  The drinks were pretty good, the ambiance was quiet and inviting, and our waiter treated us well after the forgotten appetizer and again after he saw we did not enjoy the entrees.  All said, we may have just had one of the few bad experiences here, but it take a lot to convince me to come back.",0.994,0.77,0.158,0.072,0.547975539942753

I had the el filet which was a little under cooked for my pregnant a*s but I knew I'd never finish it so I just ate what I could and took the rest home. Others at the table had the shrimp and filet......the shrimps were ginormous!!! The spinach mashed taters were good but if I went back I'd substitute the veszuvio taters....mmmm they were way better!!!  My only gripe would be the appetizer list is seriously lacking. Other than the chorizo and empanandas it wasn't that interesting. The bread basket was tasty but this isn't a diner, put out some real butter on a plate. The dessert tray they bring out is pretty nice. We went with the alfajore which wasn't as good as the ones we had in Argentina but it still brought me back.

I do wish they had more non-meat options (so I would eat here more) which I admit is a silly wish since the whole point is that the restaurant is all about Argentinian steak dishes.  I just can't eat this much meat that often.  Be forewarned that the food portions are a very large.  I think 2 people can split one portion.  Their ""dinners for two"" can easily feed a family of 4.  It is a lot of meat.  Don't go in expecting a standard steak dinner.  This isn't what most Chicagoans expect of beef or steak.  Folklore doesn't dry age beef but tends to slow cook many dishes in sauces.  I'm guessing that the people that don't like Folklore were not expecting a true Argentinian steak experience but that's what you get.",0.9316,0.855,0.12,0.025,0.5662698412698413

All of this was probably due to the fact that the Argentina-Uruguay soccer game was in penalty kicks at the time our meal was being prepared, leaving us to ponder that the chefs were watching the game instead of watching our food.  A most likely explanation, but hardly an excuse. All in all though, it is basically the same menu as Tango Sur, but with a full bar instead of BYOB.  Thus, the steaks (particularly the bife ancho) are still very good, and the chimichurri sauce is fantastic.  With the alcohol, though, the tab comes in significantly higher.  For this reason, I'll probably just continue to go to Tango Sur when I crave an Argentine steak.",0.8973,0.878,0.093,0.029,0.48952380952380947

The menu looked great as it was so many dishes to choose from. My hunger grew as I looked over each item. While we all were deciding what we wanted, the very nice server asked if we wanted to start out with a drink...I went with the Chilean Riesling which was really good.

Their sidewalk cafe is adorable and has plentiful seating.  When my husband and I went here last Thursday, they had a duo playing the guitar serenading the diners. We kinda felt like we were in Argentina- not that I have been!! 3) You have to try their Provelenta Appetizer if you like cheese! It is basically melted cheese, some delisho seasonings and a few red peppers. You then dip their homemade bread into this mixture!! MMMM!! I think about this appetizer more than is normal to think about an appetizer. Addicting! We probably come here once a month.

I didn't want to complain at the time, it was my birthday and I didn't want to be difficult, but now I regret not saying anything.  Other things that were disappointing- the house salad that comes with the steak seemed pretty thrown together and the antipasto appetizer was skimpy and looked like the meats on it came from packages of oscar meyer sandwich meats.

He definitely made our experience there even better than it might have been. Now, Mahsa T. said it best below - walking into Folklore is definitely like slipping into a sexy little black dress. It has an appealingly cozy atmosphere, and the food is to die for. We ordered the beef and spinach empanadas to start, which were delicious, and shared the Vacio Rellano as our main course. This entree comes with a (pretty sad) side salad, and the menu says this is perfect for two, but I would say you could probably double that number and still have leftovers. The beef was nicely cooked and seasoned well, filled with a mix of olive oil, parsley and garlic. A side of perfectly cooked sweet potatoes completed the meal.

Celebrate my birthday and eat like there's no tomorrow. Done deal.  I was the first one in my party to arrive and was seated to wait at the bar.

After paying for drinks, we were then seated to our table.   Dark and cozy, the dining room was a-buzz with servers and a ton of food flying by. It took us awhile to study the menu and figuring out what to get.  Our server (so nice but forgot his name) went through the menu with us and suggested some of the restuarant's popular appetizers and entrees.  For appetizers, we went with (a) baked eggplant layered with spinach, provolone and ricotta cheese, and tomato cream sauce, (b) grilled provolone cheese and red pepper, and (c) empanadas (beef?). All were excellent in our minds (and stomachs). I didn't have the empanadas (1 per order), but the ones who did seemed to like it. The eggplant was the biggest hit. It was of a pretty good size to share. Note: the eggplant dish is actually under the Chef's menu and not in the appetizer section.  You'd think we'd be goners with all that. Nope, we still had enough room for dinner. I ordered the rack of lamb with white wine sauce. It came with mashed sweet potatoes, which was a big plus for me. Holy mouthful of awesomeness! It's a very big dish that I ended up taking the rest home. Other dishes my friends enjoyed: el filet, para dos (probably good enough for more than 2 people), and four cheese ravioli with mushrooms.   Summary: good food + drinks = fun. Again, our server was great as were the bartendars and host. Our server checked on us periodically and made sure we had enough to drink (and eat, not that there was much to add).

Drinks, appetizers, salads, meats came out all in a timely fashion with professional service. The drink selection is excellent - not extensive, but a fairly unique offerings that matches the fare. The meat was pretty much perfect. We had the Para Dos, which offers you a sampling of many different meats and comes out on a small grill. It even includes the blood sausage. The quantity is probably more like a Para Tres. I was less enthused about the other parts of the meal - the empanadas and the salad were fine, but nothing to write home about, imo. But, to be fair, by having really simple starters, the meat was able to take center stage. Everything was reasonably priced for what it is: empanadas $2/piece, dinners from $10-$36.

Their cocktail list is good, the caipirinhas are spot on and my dad was pleased that our waiter brought him 3 blue-cheese stuffed olives with his martini - yum.

However, I felt like my entree was quantity over quality - the plate probably weighed five pounds - impressive, until you taste it. I had some kind of steak that was stuffed with spinach & cheese, which sounded great in theory but lacked flavor. I ordered it medium rare, but somehow one side of the steak managed to be completely raw, while the other side was well done. I should have sent it back, but did not and ended up boxing it only to throw it out at home - what a waste.

2010-08-29,3.0,"Having already written a rave review for Folklore's sister restaurant, Tango Sur, I am somewhat disappointed that I can only give Folklore 3 stars.  I have eaten here twice before writing this review so I am combining my experiences into this review. The great:  Blood sausage (they call it ""black sausage"" - but yes, its blood sausage), the pollo medio (whatever they use for that sauce is amazing), and the spinach empanadas.  I'm going to say that this is the best emapanada in the city, hands down.   The sweetbreads that come on the parillada were small and tough on my first visit, but plump and perfect on my second visit.  Having also had them at Tango Sur and knowing how delicious they can be, I'm confident in saying that they are one of the best things you can eat at both restaurants. The good:  The steaks.  I love MEAT and this is a full-on double-rainbow all-the-way-across-the-sky meat palace.  That said, both meals were inconsistent in the quality of the meat.  Some of the steaks were cooked perfectly and were tender and flavorful; others were tough, charred-tasting and, in the case of the short ribs we had on the parillada, mostly gristle and not a lot of meat.  Overall though the meat is solid and reasonably priced.  They also offer grass-fed/free-range and organic beef options for slightly higher prices. The bad:  IT IS SO LOUD.  I had a headache leaving the restaurant.  There were people there on dates and in groups, and everyone had to shout to be heard over the music.  On top of this the volume often fluctuated between ""barely manageably loud"" and ""I am thisclose to walking out because I should not have to scream at the person sitting next to me.""  I even had my server ask me to repeat myself because it was so loud in there.  Music should be just loud enough that you can't hear the conversation of the table next to you, but quiet enough that it doesn't intrude on your own table's conversation.  Sadly for Folklore the overwhelming volume of the restaurant's music knocks what could have been a 4-star review down to a 3, and puts it in a category of restaurants I am not looking forward to returning to.",0.9931,0.834,0.133,0.034,0.5669376693766939

The times that i've been at Folklore, it always seem to be someone's birthday celebration.  This last time, there were at least 5 parties celebrating birthdays.  They knew how to handle big crowds, and the prices were very reasonable for big parties. So to start, we had empanadas (with a choice of 5 different fillings).  Their version of Pisco Sour, though not authentic, felt like a cool breeze for a warm evening.  With entrees, majority of the choices were meat, which were served with a house salad, and various preparations of potato.  My last visit, i shared the parillada with another friend.  It's the traditional Argentinian preparation where they brought the meats out in a tabletop grill.  Here, the grill barely warms the meat, which was great as this dish normally caused a lot of splatters.  The parillada for 2 had short ribs, flap meat, chorizo, blood sausage, and sweet bread.  Argentinian meats are grilled with lots of salt and herbs, so be ready for the assault.  I particularly like the sweetbreads.  It is rare to have sweetbread without any kind of breading.  So this was a welcome change.   For dessert, the options are pretty usual.  The flan is very good.

It's really nice how it's away from the more noisy places of Wicker Park which leads to a much nicer setting. First off, there is a guy that does remind one of Antonio Banderas. His name is Alfredo and he is definitely a big factor in why Folklore is 5 stars. He was very helpful in making suggestions and had a charming way of saying thank you when we complimented his choices. He is one of those waiters that you know is there without being obtrusive. Cool guy. Now for the food. Loved it all so I will mention everything. Berenjena: An Alfredo pick... Eggplant done in a lasagna kind of style. It came with a tomato cream sauce that complimented the eggplant perfectly. It was a chef special so I don't know how often it appears. Really, really good starter though.. Lomo relleno: It says this is for two people, but in reality you can feel more people with this dish! It comes with a house salad which I shall not really comment on. It wasn't bad, but it was a regular salad. The meat is essentially a chunk of fillet (mmmm... beef) that is cooked to your liking. It came with an excess of portabello mushrooms which was very much appreciated. Also, there was a chimichurri sauce on the side which just made everything better. I am ready to go home now to tear into the leftovers after writing about this! Flor: After enjoying myself thoroughly, I was left in a great mood. Not really a sweets person, I was enjoying myself so much that I decided that we are splurging and going with a dessert to top off the meal. Doesn't hurt that the gf likes herself some dessert... The desserts came out on a tray and Alfredo explained all of them. Ended up choosing the flor per his suggestion and I was really pleased with it. Only had one bite as I've cut down on my carbs for wedding slimming, but it took a lot of willpower to not eat more. By the time we got our check (had to rush back home) the very full gf almost finished the dessert that she said she was going to take home.  Also, I feel I should mention that they have some excellent craft beers in case you don't want to go the wine route. Didn't see the cocktails, but I was more than pleased with a gumball head to go along with my meal.  The best place I've been to for Argentine food.

We finally got our apps and then didn't see our waiter for another 30min. By the time I saw the waiter I had to ask if we could order. The response I received was, ""Hold on."" I was livid. We had already waited an hour.  By some miracle, we finally ordered and got our food. The food was okay. A friend and I shared the Valcio Relleno. It was good however it was a huge portion of meat. The menu states that it is ideal for two people but it is probably more appropriate for 4. The rest of my party ordered steaks as well. The one critique everyone had was that the meat was cooked well, but it wasn't seasoned - at all.  I would be willing to give this place another chance pending I didn't have the same waiter.

My date and I were walking by on our way to another restaurant down the street one Sunday night, when we saw the pitch blackness of Folklore broken only by the flicker of candles through the floor-to-ceiling windows--and we literally stopped in our tracks.  ""What is this place?"" I asked.  ""I don't know, let's find out,"" he replied.  So we went in, were greeted warmly, and seated right away at a rustic wooden table. Argentinian tango music played in the background and soon I was under its spell. The exposed brick and unexpected items on display, like a Victrola, further added to the charm of this place.  A very good-looking Latin man, who both looked like Antonio Banderas and was soft-spoken like Antonio Banderas, appeared to take our order. I ordered a flavorful Cabernet Sauvignon that went perfectly with my ""el filet"" which came with delicious spinach mashed potatoes and side salad. My date ordered the rib-eye.  ""HOLY COW,"" I said when our entrees arrived. No really, they bring you a cow-sized piece of meat, which is great for their relatively low prices. Mine came with 2 pieces of filet and my date's rib-eye was large enough to feed 3 people, seriously. We had to take most of it home. My only complaint is that they didn't quite cook the meat to my specification, I asked for medium well but it was definitely only medium cooked. But that didn't stop me from savoring the juicy goodness of my filet. I needed a little something sweet after eating all that meat, so we got a light dessert (it was not easy to choose from a tray of delicious options), but we went with a yellow cake with a layer of dulce de leche and coconut shavings on top--perfect way to end our meal. In case you didn't know, Folklore is the sister restaurant to Tango Sur and has been open for about 6 months. Unlike Tango Sur, Folklore is not BYOB, but they have an extensive wine list.

We had reservations and unfortunately, I guess that means you still have to sit at the bar for 30 minutes to get a table. I will say the service at the bar was good. Getting to our table, we were seated in an aisle where a lot of the servers were using this a way through the restaurant. As for the food, I had the Bone in Rib Eye and when I order a steak as Medium rare, I expect the meat next to the bone to be warm and red, that was not the case, the steak came out as well done throughout. I thought it was only me experiencing this, but a friend who was there the same night had the same issue. If you are going to pride your restaurant as an Argentine grill with great meat, please learn to cook a steak correctly. Besides being a bit overpriced, the food was mediocre at best. I would say stick to the original and go to Tango Sur. This place will need to figure out their snafu and hopefully in 6 months, its still around.",0.9799,0.804,0.158,0.038,0.55625

Appetizer: Bereneja de Escabahe (sp?) - basically sliced eggplant marinated in olive oil and vinegar.  The strips were tender and packed with flavor, and strips of red pepper complimented the eggplant nicely. Meat: I ordered the Filet after reading the reviews.  I ordered it Medium to play it safe, I didn't want something too rare but I know that the more you cook a steak the more flavor it loses.  The waiter clarified if I wanted it Medium Rare and I repeated myself that I wanted it Medium.  It came out Medium Rare, but I couldn't have been happier.  It was absolutely the best, most tender, flavorful steak I've had in my entire life.  It came with a side of spinach mashed potatoes, which were creamy and buttery.  SO GOOD!   Desert:  The lady and I split a slice of the 1000 layer cake, and our friend ordered something like peaches and cream pie.  I tried both, and they were equally light, sweet and the perfect ending to an excellent dinner. The waitstaff was patient, friendly, and they must've filled my fiance's water glass 10 times, no joke.

My cousins were visiting just for the weekend, and I thought I could take a chance on taking them somewhere new, due to the great reviews and that fact that you can't really mess up the flavors of Argentinian steak.

First of all, the entrees finally came out after more than an hour wait, and there was a 15 min gap between when the chicken entrees and lomo relleno was served. I ordered a medium lomo relleno stuffed with chimichurri. I cut into the end of the big hunk of steak. Okay no red present, but I guess the edges cook faster. I kept cutting and cutting away, and in the dead center, there was about a dime size bit of red in the huge 3 inch slab of meat.  I felt like a kid digging through cereal for the prize but in my case no red and no chimmichurri sauce to be found! To add insult to injury of my grief struck stomach, I pointed it out to my waiter. He gave me this incomprehensible explanation that the way the lomo relleno was cooked, you can't really get medium because the meat needs to cook longer. I think that's b.s. but, if that's the case I wish I was told that earlier when ordering! Maybe I would have ordered the lomo relleno ""raw"" and it would have come out ""medium"" I just felt like I ate a big piece of pot roast. I seriously would have rather shelled out a few extra bucks and ate at a quality steakhouse like Gibson's or David Burke. The chicken dishes, the empanada, and cocktails were enjoyed.

I've had steaks of many preparations but nothing beats a nice, thick, juicy steak that's seasoned well and cooked to perfection. Folklore was a decent attempt of satisfying that craving. It was fairly busy the night I was there so I was expecting lagging of some sort during service. While I understand the concept of dim lighting to create a more intimate setting, I think it wouldn't hurt to utilize a little more track lighting.. I found it way too dark for my liking. I'll explain later why I felt more lighting was needed... We ordered Sweetbreads for an appetizer.. by our request we had then brown them so they were crisp rather than grilled. They were overall, a little lacking in flavor. Lemon was helpful though. I like the simplicity of a basic salad with vinegar and oil, salt/pepper. So that was appreciated. A decent assortment of breads to keep us going. I ordered the parrillada for one and also asked that the sweetbreads on that be prepared like we had requested earlier. Let me say the portions are INSANE. Parrillada for one can easily feed 2, maybe 3. Nice assortment of meats. and 2 types of sausage. I'm usually a fan of blood sausage, but I feel like they overdid it with the cumin - the flavor was kind of rancid and texture was more mushy than I prefer. The meats were good, some were a little underseasoned. Chimichurri was better than most places, but still lacked acidity that I personally like. One of my cuts were cooked longer than I asked for. I asked for medium rare, but the waiter insisted that I get it well done. So I took his advice, wasn't pleased. My sister got a ribeye, HUGE tastier than my steak. Pretty tender.

2009-12-04,1.0,"first things first, I did not have high hopes for this spot. I have not been to Tango Sur since my early twenties, fresh out of vegetarianism, when a big cut of steak for 16 bucks was enough to keep me coming back for more. But I know better now. No piece of meat big enough to feed two should make it on the menu with a price tag under thirty dollars. This I know. I also know that on the whole, restaurants on Division are catered to the masses, rather than the foodies. I knew that Folklore, like its Southport sibling, would be no different. But still, I ignored my own better judgement and trucked the two blocks from my apartment, husband in tow, for a carnivorous Argentinian meal.  The upside was the decor. Cozy exposed brick walls, classic Chicago tin-tile ceiling and romantic single taper candles on each table. the next upside was a glass of pretty decent Malbec for 5 bucks. But the upside stopped there.  The acoustics were terrible. I was at a small table for two and could barely hear my husband over the noise of nearby diners. This may have been water under the bridge if I could have quelled my need for conversation by stuffing my face with delicious meat instead. But no such luck.  We knew something was fishy when we opened the menu to find that half of the offerings at this Argentinian restaurant were actually Italian . and I'm not talking fusion here, I mean straight up eggplant Parmesan and the like. We searched for something that seemed authentic, something that screamed Beunos Aires. We settled on the strip steak and the flap steak. Admittedly, not the best cuts of meat, but it was a thursday night so we were being reserved. The strip came so rare that I wouldn't even taste it. When it was recooked and brought back to me I realized I might have been better off not tasting it at all. Though visually tantalizing (a thick and seemingly juicy cut), the reality was fatty and tough. It's a rare occasion that me or my husband decides that we just can't eat an entree. Seriously. But after one bite of the tasteless and chewy strip, I realized I would have been better off defrosting a six month old steak from my own freezer rather than bothering to leave the apartment and go to Folklore. Fortunately, our server was quick to remove the charge for the entree after I made my honest and direct complaint: the steak is just plain bad.  I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. I feel like an ass for this scathing review.

It's in a great location and there a ton of great bars around the area if you're looking for a pre-meal beer. We had reservations so we were seated pretty quickly. Ambiance:  Not as dark as Tango Sur, but very cool. There are tin ceilings with stone-colored concrete walls and steel beams. Cool if you're into that sort of stuff. It's also not as intimate as T.S. and the crowd is not as eclectic.  Food: The bread here is great - soft and warm. We started off with the Empanadas for $2 a pop. They came with a great garlic-oil sauce. The menu is pretty much exactly the same as Tango Sur.    I ordered the Filet medium rare. My one buddy ordered the Filet medium and buddy #3 ordered the prime, medium. The reason why I gave this place 2 starts is that they screwed up ALL of our orders. My filet came out well-done, and both of my friends' steaks came out medium-rare. I usually don't make a big deal of this, but when you are dealing with steaks, there really is only 1 variable - the extent of the cooking. We didn't send them back because: A. We were starving  B. We aren't prick D-bags So this was kind of disappointing. Drinks:  NOT BYOB like T.S, but still has a decent wine list and some great beers. Price: We each paid $40, which is honestly a great price for a steakhouse - but I guess you get what you pay for.

The two appetizers we tried were weak.  A plate of melted cheese with a couple sliced red peppers and a chorizo dish accompanied by their holy trinity of:  ice burg lettuce, sliced tomato, and a red onion.  This combo appeared with many sides, while also doubling as the house salad.  It was oddly everywhere.  Very reminiscent of a diner type salad.  Note an average diner salad. I felt the cheese dish could have been salvaged with additional peppers or maybe caramelized onions.  Some type of acid or sweet was needed to cut the melted fat.  The chorizo was more akin to a bad bratwurst.  Would have liked some spice. Two of our three steaks were passable.  That in and of it's self is the problem.  Not really looking for passable when I go to dinner.  We probably all have a few friends who consistently knock a steak out of the park, on their Weber.  No?  Meat, salt & pepper, butter or olive oil - hey maybe both - add some fire and wallah. Now the third steak was smothered in some type of herb encrusted weed.  I would guess at it as dried Thyme?  Edible?  I thought so, but I could muscle down anything.  My friend.  Well she skipped it and split my passable rib-eye. Desserts.  I know what you are thinking.  Why good man did you order dessert?  Well I really can't help myself.  I always order dessert, whether it seems wise or not.   Alas all the desserts had some type of coconut.  Unfortunately I despise coconut.  A normal person may have been deterred at this point but I pushed on.  It was some type of roll filled with chocolate and coconut.  In all fairness this dessert would have had to be exceptional for me to like it, after the preceding dishes....

It's a meat lover's place. The ambiance was dark, elegant and hip. The music was Gotan project, a electronic Tango fusion group.  When my boyfriend and I explored the Buckton/Wicker Park neighborhood, we found this place being highly recommended on Chicago Tribune. We decided to give it a try on a Friday night. When we arrive at 9:00pm, it was completely packed and the wait is about an hour and ten minutes. We walked around the neighborhood and went to Adobo Grill to have a Guacamole appetizer while waiting. It was worth the wait. The meat was so tender and juicy. The sauce I thought was a little but heavy, but it doesn't cover the taste of the red and tender fillet mignon. It was seriously 28oz, no joking. We had to pack it at the end. The dessert - flan- was not as good as it looks when it's on other people' desk. We paid about $27 per person including tax, tips, drinks, dessert, and the big entree.

Loved the lighting and ambiance. Like Tango Sur, it was loud but not too much that we couldn't hear each other across the table.  For starters, we had a plate of melted cheese, olive oil and peppers. It was a little odd that it didn't come with toast points but was tasty nonetheless. Like other reviewers here, I could have skipped the complimentary ""salad"" that came with the meal. Onions, tomato and lettuce on par with iceberg--not worth it for me. Besides, a huge entree was yet to come... We both got versions of steak. Dining companion got the fillet, which came with incredible spinach mashed potatoes (er, butter-infused spinach potatoes.) It was overcooked, though, but not to the point that you'd send it back.

Flaky crispy crust and delicious flavorful filling. Came with a sort of oil dip, maybe an olive oil with tons of herbs in it. Complimented very well. Totally awesome. I had the beef ravioli. I usually stay away from beef ravioli, since most of the time it tastes like nasty Chef Boyardee, but this was amazing. The sauce was more like a stew (large hunks of beef, smooth tomato sauce) but was very good and had a great wine flavor to it. Truly the BEST beef ravioli I've ever had. My dining companion had a steak, which was undercooked for what she ordered (medium well ordered, came out medium) but she still enjoyed it. I, personally, am not a big fan of chargrilled steak - and this didn't have any spices on it so I wasn't too into it. But I could see how this would be right up someone's alley. Overall, I would definitely be back to try some of the other menu items. My only problem is that the place is SO DARK.

Like its sister restaurant, I felt that it was way too dim that I had difficulty seeing my food. The salad was uninteresting to say the least. It comes with the meal but it was still rather wet when it was served and we were expected to dress the greens ourselves with the oil and vinegar provided. Well, I don't they they realized that it's hard to properly dress them without a big salad bowl and a whisk to make the vinaigrette. The salad is simply a disaster.

I took a couple of my sales reps out here for a accomplishment dinner based on one of the sales rep's recommendations.  Probably not a good idea to listen to other's recommendations unless you do a little reasearch first.   Anyhow, as I sit down the waiter comes up and he's ready to take our drink orders and I order a Modelo.  the waiter jots it down and then asks the next person for their drink order and that person turns to me to ask me did you get the modelo especial? I respond back, ""No, the Negra.' after the watier takes our order.  We wait about 10 mins for our drinks to get to the table to satisfy our long over due wait for a quenching drink and the waiter brings me the wrong beer. Delirium Tremens sounds nothing like Modelo!?!  - I wasn't too upset because I also can enjoy a Delirium but when I pointed it out to the waiter, he implicated that I clearly stated that I wanted a Delirium Tremens.  Instead of snapping on him, I simply told him that I would drink this beer but the next one I order will be a NEGRA MODELO and asked if this would be ok and if it was understood. without catching my annoyed sarcasm, he left without apologizing.   the wait here for your food is pretty long... we ordered a few apps, stay away from the prosciutto and melon, it's exactly prosciutto and melon, no more no less, nothing cool about a piece of thinly sliced prosciutto covering a slice of melon. Seriously nothing.  So after eating some of our appetizers we decided to go outside and have a smoke, the staff thought we were dining and ditching and I really don't blame them for thinking that due to their 'expectional service'.  - the waiter chased us outside and we told him we were having a smoke, I think I might have asked him if he would like to join us for a quick cancer stick.  After he declined to join us, he came back to inform us that our food was coming to the table, we said that we would be right in and told him to see if they could wait 2 minutes...he came right back and stated that they had to bring it out right now. After Not enjoying my cigarette, we walked back inside.   We sat down to eat.  I ordered the tilapia which was based in a citrus sauce over a bed of mash potatoes. The sauce was definately overbearing even for my cigarette caused deadened taste buds, to the point that I felt like I was eating an orange with a hint of fish. At this point, I wished that I had dined (kinda at least) and ditched.  Well the other two obviously ordering something a little better than mine were enjoying their steaks but both claimed it to be so-so.  We found ourselves comparing it to Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse, which we dined at the previous month for our Quota Dinner and all agreed that place was much better than Folklore.

Definitely a fun place - but you better like beef.  The plain, bland salad they give you with your meal is a good example of their dedication to beef - they just don't get it.  Don't show up thinking you'll get the chicken or a vegetarian entree - the menu is pretty much beef, beef, beef (oh yeah, I think there was some lamb).",0.9903,0.789,0.178,0.033,0.5329004329004329

We pulled open the ornate door and and stepped into the front bar area. The host said the wait was easily an hour and a half but we might be able to grab appetizers at the bar. Hmm . . . .that didn't seem possible as there were four people deep to even get to the bar. So we flagged down a bartender, snagged a hand muddled mojito and a glass of Argentine wine and stood back and checked the place out.  The space is lovely. Large windows facing the street that are made more intimate by the metal mullions, cream colored tin ceiling, small down lights and exposed brick walls. Intimate seating areas. Nice.  At that point, a couple got up from the bar to be seated and we were able to grab their seats. Crystal (bartender extraordinaire) came over with the specialty drink menu and asked if we were going to eat at the bar. While not a favorite of mine- this seemed like the best option not to have to wait as we had to be somewhere at 10- so eat at the bar we did.  To start with, we had a couple of empanadas (the beef with cheese and the ham and cheese) both were good. And a perfect precursor of what was to come.  You can't believe how big (and cheap) the entrees are. I ordered the beef short rib and I thought for $13 how big could this be, right? Wrong. This turned out to be 3 large pieces of steak, grilled perfectly and served with a simple salad of lettuce, tomatoes and onions (I ended up taking two of the steaks home -it was enough for two people to split). And my friend got the Parillida (only $19) which was was surely enough for three people! This grilled meat and sausage combo included short ribs, flap meat, crispy sweetbreads, chorizo and blood sausage. Unbelievable!  Service was great! I felt bad having Crystal serve us dinner at the bar as she was going crazy trying to keep up with the requests for the specialty drinks. With all the muddling she was doing- she won't have to go to the gym, that's for sure. The food runner got our food to us quickly and was also quick to clear the area when we were done.  If you drive, parking can be a hassle in this area on the weekends so valet parking is available for $10. Or you can try to find street parking just south of Division.  It's known that the Argentine culture is about socializing and eating. Step into Folklore and you will immediately know that this new addition to the line up of restaurants on this stretch of Division is all about that culture.  And who doesn't need a little more culture in their life?",0.9943,0.854,0.116,0.03,0.5675550144300144
2009-10-18,5.0,"Finally a Steak Place down the street!  Saturday night the place was filled up, thank goodness I had the foresight to make a reservation. Arrived on time and were told there was a few minute wait so we grabbed a Beer, ""the most popular in Argentina"", actually was nice and light. We liked the decor, after all these years of walking by the space when empty they did a phenomenal job on the place... As the lady said, ""This feels like a Winter Restaurant, so cozy"".  For Apps we decided on the Empenadas, one Beef and the other Corn seasoned quite nicely. Ordered a bottle of wine looked forward to the main course. Salad, quite basic but more than enough to get you ready... for Meat. I had heard rumors about Tango Sur that you get MORE than enough on the plate... well it has carried over here. You could almost load up on some of the great looking apps and then split an entree.  We way over-stood our welcome as we were enjoying a leisurely meal and they are the hot place in the hood. A polite request for us to head into the bar was heeded, can't blame em. Sorry guys.",0.9836,0.832,0.161,0.007,0.5972222222222222
2009-10-16,5.0,"I have been to Tango Sur and never got around to rating it, but probably would've given it 4 stars for bad service and just so-so atmosphere even though the food is great... but I went to Folklore last night and the menu is essentially the same, its much cozier than Tango Sur, it's in my neighborhood, and our service was fantastic. Definitely 5 star worthy. Knowing how much food they give you, my sister and I split the filet with spinach mashed potatoes and they literally bring you two filets for the price of one.  Ridiculous portions and ridiculously delicious.

2009-10-15,4.0,"It took FOREVER for this place to open, so I was very happy to try it right away.  I thought there might be some hang-ups given we were a group of six and came on their first weekend, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The space is beautiful and I thought the food was a very good.  It is also unlike anything else in the neighborhood (yeah!  something other than a douche-filled sports bar!).  My husband and a friend shared the dinner for two which seemed to be the best deal--lots of tasty meat on a hot platter for only $31.  We had a few good bottles of $30ish Chilean red, great conversation, plenty of well seasoned food (though the salad that comes with dinner is really lame) and an adequate server.  The empanadas, while a wee bit pricey at $2 each, were probably the best I'd ever had.  They brought a free caramel flan since it was the opening weekend and we scraped the plate!  Everyone in our party went home with leftovers and all said they would be back.",0.9966,0.713,0.287,0.0,0.5455895691609978
2009-10-15,5.0,"Fantastic first time experience. The location is a definite plus and street parking is plentiful. Our server was very knowledgeable about all the items on the menu including the wines. We started off by creating our own ""sampler"" plate of the empanadas. My favorite were the corn empanadas. Second, was the salad. Nothing memorable. Just your typical lettuce, onion, and tomato with oil and vinegar. Then the main course. There were 5 of us. We each ordered a different entree: chicken, ribs, steak, blood sausage, and sweet bread. The food was delicious and savory. And did I mention...HOLY PORTION CONTROL!!!  The sultry ambiance combined with great food, wine, and service made for a delightful and FULL evening. I definitely had good food coma sleep that night.",0.9848,0.775,0.225,0.0,0.6233333333333333
2009-10-13,4.0,What a nice place. The portions are generous and food is very good. Service was excellent. I have had better steak but with all of the other items we ordered I can say this is not just a meat and potatoes joint. They have some real interesting items. The host was very accommodating and they placed us at a favorable table. Will definitely be going back.,0.9623,0.71,0.29,0.0,0.5783333333333334

2009-10-06,4.0,"Yip yip yeah!  Finally, the long awaited Folklore has arrived!  No more driving to Southport for me...instead just a quick jaunt down the street to meat heaven.    We decided to stop in on the Sunday night after they opened and were nervous about the possible wait.  However, we were seated upon arrival!  The interior is familiar; candlelit tables that are close together but not too close, pushed tin ceilings, servers with seductive accents, sexy music playing in the background, and people making out all over the place.  Ok scratch that last one but you know what I mean.    The menu is almost identical to Tango Sur: empanadas, sweetbreads, antipasto for starters and meat for one and giant meat platters for two (or three).  The main difference I noticed is that they have a section dedicated to grass fed beef-nice job Folklore! Also, they serve cocktails here and yummy ones at that.  The wine list houses some excellent wines from Argentina, Chile, and Spain.  I noticed one of my favorite Spanish reds for $38 a bottle which is almost half the amount other places charge for it. Score!!  For an entree we split the (insert name I don't remember) duo which had perfectly cooked flap meat, sweetbreads, blood sausage, and short ribs which came with the ever so perfect chimichurri sauce.  Oh holy meat!  Everything was delicious but I think I prefer my old standby of the lomo relleno.  The entrees still come with that random salad consisting of lettuce, onion, tomato and vinegar and the desserts still come out on a platter at the end of your meal.     The reason why I'm knocking a star is because of the rushed service.  After 5 minutes of enjoying our app's our salads came out and then 2 minutes after that our entree.  Umm.  I hadn't even gotten through the app yet.  Their excuse was that medium rare doesn't take long to cook.  Well, I think we all know that it wasn't the steaks fault!  They kindly took it back and we enjoyed our meal at the pace we wanted.      I left full, tipsy, and happy.  Folklore, you serenaded me and I love you for that.",0.9979,0.788,0.198,0.014,0.5719444444444445
2009-10-05,4.0,"I had read about Folklore and wanted to try it, so went there for dinner on Friday night. I knew it was new but I didn't know it was BRAND new! We were there on the third day of business. Well, you know what you get with a brand new, nice restaurant in Wicker Park... a long wait. We probably waited for about 1.5 hours (most of it over at Innjoy at least, where we could sit down.) But it was worth the wait! First of all, the drinks are yummy! I tried the mojito and this one drink with mango, tequila and hot sauce. Plus the drinks are a decent size, unlike at some restaurants. We also got a nice bottle of Argentinean wine that was SO cheap for a restaurant bottle of wine! And quite tasty! And the food was delicious! I have never been to Tango Sur, which is the original sister restaurant so didn't really know what to expect. I knew it involved a lot of meat though. I split a filet special with my boyfriend and it was more than enough food! The steak was very flavorful and tender and it came with a side of spinach mashed potatoes. Yum! Also got to try the beef empanadas... those were just ok. My friends got other cuts of steak and they really enjoyed theirs, as well. If you are in the mood for a lot of meat, I would highly recommend it. One minor thing I thought they should change... they should make their own flavored butter to go with their bread. It is a nicer restaurant and I always love the herb butter that nicer restaurants have. They just brought out little packaged pats of butter, like the ones you get at a diner.  Oh, and about the atmosphere: cozy, dark, romantic... but a bit loud. It is a small restaurant so be prepared to wait on a weekend night.",0.9967,0.801,0.191,0.008,0.5339701092558234
2009-10-03,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place.  So did my friend.  We entered to a rather nice looking space and sat at the bar to eat.  My friends mojito was pretty good.  And that's where the stars stopped.  I ordered the Milanese y caballo -- literally chicken fried steak with two properly cooked eggs on top, but NO seasoning, absolutely no flavor.  I couldn't even finish it and i can always finish my meals.  My friend had the short ribs.  They weren't melt in your mouth soft, but they weren't tough either even though they were grilled.  The problem with the short ribs was just that, she got three giant short ribs and nothing else.  It was a platter full of meat.  Even at a steak house you get a baked potato or veggies or something.  Not here, just meat.  I felt bad for not wanting to take home the left overs, they asked us three times if we wanted to.  I wouldn't waste my time with this place.",0.22,0.783,0.125,0.092,0.5305555555555554
2009-10-03,2.0,"Very long wait AFTER having been seated AND ordered.  Many of the items that came were not what we ordered, and the ones that we received were mixed.  Empanadas were awesome, sweet potatoes were two plain (not even a touch of butter or sugar or anything) steamed sweet potatoes on a plate, and procuitto and melon was a slice of procuitto just laid over a slice of melon.  We weren't asked how we wanted our steak cooked, and one came medium and one came rare.  Hopefully these are growing pains for a new restaurant and they will get themselves sorted out.",0.8934,0.839,0.135,0.026,0.5868542568542569
2009-10-02,5.0,"Ok first off, the correct adjective is ARGENTINE, as in the title of the restaurant's name. I was once corrected in high school by a native after I referred to the people of Argentina as ""Argentinean."" I have been waiting for this place to open forever and here it is, finally! I had been a patron of Barra ñ for years and openly welcomed this addition to the 'hood (because I can stumble home in my drunken stupor). The drinks are superb and so is the food. All portions are rather generous, food and drinks alike. The decor is cozy and warm. I will be come a fixture at this place. Definitely order the empanadas, beef and spinach are my favorite. The sweetbreads are on point--the side order is plentiful. I haven't had the vacio here, but I'm sure it's just as good as ñ's or Tango Sur's. The procuitto with the hearts of palm and salsa golf is yummy, too. This family of restaurants also boasts some of the best, flavorful chimichurris in the city. Make sure to wash it down with some mojito-action. I tried the mango picado for the first time...a bit on the heavy side so I'd stick with the other drinks.  At any rate, the staff is charming with plenty of familiar faces if you've ever frequented ñ or Tango Sur. This place is going to be my new neighborhood hangout. I might look like an empanada by the end of the year.",0.9907,0.839,0.161,0.0,0.5849077733860344
2009-10-02,5.0,"As a Filipina woman (with a morsel of Spanish in her) who embraces and recognizes a lot of Mexico in herself, Folklore truly made me feel Argentinean as well. To call this establishment a restaurant/bar is an understatement, with its candlelit rooms and echoing Latin music, and intelligible waiters that make you swoon, you can't help but lose track of time. With previous yet failed plans to dine at Tango Sur, I dined at Folklore last night with my sister to celebrate my recent job offer, she lives in the neighborhood and walked past it during its soft opening - yes, all it took was a stroll past this joint and she immediately made reservations for last night's grand opening.  I should preface this by saying that my sister and I are absolute foodies, we're not those women who order salads as entrees and steer clear of white bread, blasphemy!  It may have been raining up a storm last night but upon opening the rustic, wooden door, we emerged into an atmosphere adorned with sexy lighting, beautiful people, cocktails up to par with the mixologists at Violet Hour and phenomenal steak. When you come to an Argentinean steakhouse by all means do you NOT order the chicken, though I'm sure it may be fantastic, you have to eat the steak here!  We were greeted and immediately seated and our waiter, Alfredo, kindly and patiently guided us through the menu. For drinks, I ordered the Mango Picado, a tequila filled glass of amazing with a splash of Cointreau and fresh limes - there's a bit of spice to this drink and a little bite with those fresh limes but if you love tequila I highly recommend this. My sister ordered a lime mojito and let me just say that this lime mojito was so great it should be the mojito from which all mojitos are made.  While catching up with one another's lives over fabulous cocktails and warm bread, Alfredo brought out our house salads (again not as entrees, but they came with what we ordered), lettuce with tomato, onion and a light coat of vinaigrette - it was a clean, well put together salad, we ate just a little though in preparation for our meat, meat, meat.  I ordered the Bife Vesuvio, a grilled prime steak dish stuffed with spinach and cheese with Argentine style potatoes. Upon first bite I deduced that this is the dish I would like to eat if I knew I were about to die. It was brought out to me as the chef suggested, medium - and although I like my meat medium well, I'm glad I went with the chef's recommendation since it was a stuffed meat dish, perfection on a platter. Since the dish was also rather large I stood no chance at finishing it and brought the leftovers home with me. Awash in the memory of my fantastic dining experience last night, I can't remember the name of my sister's dish - it was a cut of prime rib, grilled over mashed potatoes. I can guarantee you that I'm not doing it justice, but she loved it.  The service here is top notch, albeit a grand opening - everything flowed smoothly and if you dine here ask for Alfredo, he's soft-spoken, attentive and absolutely and effortlessly sexy. Folklore Argentine Grill will now be recommended to all of my friends and I cannot wait to return because guess what, we had no room for dessert...and dessert is always a must on my list.",0.999,0.751,0.214,0.035,0.5855720899470899
2009-09-27,5.0,"Folklore, I've been waiting for you. I'm a bit obsessed with Argentinean wine, the Tango, the culture, and of course, the food.  Last night's soft opening connected me with all of those elements + others thirsty for the same enlightenment. Hot on the heels of sister restaurants Tango Sur and Ñ, Folklore fills the 'steakhouse with late-night hours' void. And unlike Tango Sur, there's alcohol. You'll find Latin libations such as mojitos, pisco sours and caipirinhas make the menu. I tried the mango mojito and was so enamored I had three of them (this coming from someone who doesn't usually drink cocktails). I believe I've found my favorite new mixologist and drink in the city: resident mojito maestro Marissa rules the coop! The restaurant is stunning with its hard-nosed rusticism meets wildly romantic feel: check out the tin ceiling! And, as my friend said, ""it makes you want to make out"". This alone guarantees my return for a full meal. Even the washroom is gorgeous with its spa-inspired stylings.  Folklore isn't just another pretty face on the Divison scene, either. We were able to sample a wide menu selection including meat, meat and more meat! The beef here is the shining star (I couldn't get enough) and they also offer the organic, grass-fed variety. The service is excellent and complements an experience built on elegance, culture and flair for fun. Oh, and the music: SEXY. Urban chic at its best!",0.9863,0.829,0.146,0.024,0.5683135704874835
