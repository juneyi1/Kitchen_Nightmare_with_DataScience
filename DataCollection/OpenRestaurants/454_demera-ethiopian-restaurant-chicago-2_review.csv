2017-08-30,4.0,"First time here at an Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago. I like that there is plenty of seating and the decor is a nice nod to the Ethiopian culture.  I got the four meat special: Yebeg wot (lamb), Doro wot (chicken), zilwa ribs and the beef ribs. All spicy and good. I had enough injera too. Even though I usually like the real teff dark grey injera. I was full and the salad was good. It is more than enough for sure. I wish I had a little bit more sauce/wot in all of them. I liked the woven basket the injera was served in. Especially the doro wot (chicken with boiled egg) The staff was friendly and I did not have to wait long for my food. I went around 7pm on a week day so it was not too crowded and I had ample seating. I liked the decor, and also that they were playing Ethiopian music which to me just adds to the true experience and culture.   I wish they sold the berebere chili powder to you can buy it and take some home:) I have seen that sold at other restaurants.",0.9868,0.808,0.192,0.0,0.5968711843711844
2017-08-26,5.0,"BINGO I WON! I have been to very few Ethiopian restaurants before this. My wife (her Royal Highness) had been to 1 more than I. She did not like that last one. I was desperate to find a good one for her. I have 4 near to me and I researched them all. I chose this one. We showed up too early and went and had coffee. Not the best start, I was nervous. We went in to this well set up restaurant. The menu had a lot of foreign words for the dishes. There were English explanations but we wanted a mixed  couples dish that took some choices for combinations. Our waiter a very friendly young man named Pablo was a huge help. He could not only help us work out the choices but had a deep knowledge of the foods. He could help us with understanding things like how hot some dishes were compared to others. We worked it out. We had 3 meats, fish, lamb and chicken as well as 3 vegi dishes with their wonderful native bread. The food was everything I could hope for. We were full by the end and happy. My wife was happy, this was a goal for me. The price was fair and later I was chatting with Pablo and mentioned a fine tea that we had at another place. He gifted us with a pot of their tea. The scent of cardamon, cinnamon and the other parts was as good as the tea itself. We did not use or need sweetener. It was a truly memorable meal.",0.9956,0.76,0.214,0.025,0.5774712643678162
2017-08-22,4.0,"Came here for a date night and we were pleased. We heard the wait is long, but it was well worth the 20 minute wait for them to get our table ready.  We started with the sambusa. Crispy and flakey on the outside with a nice flavorful filling. Similar to an Indian samosa, which I love, so this hit the spot for me.  Our main course was the vegetarian platter. We tried a variety of the vegetarian dishes. It wasn't like other Ethiopian places where all of the dishes tasted the same. They all had their own distinctive taste. My only complaint was that I wish some of them were spicier, but that's just my personal preference.  Service was great and our waitress was very attentive.  Definitely recommend trying this restaurant!",0.9865,0.73,0.236,0.035,0.5351851851851852

The manager came to the table and told us that this  happens all the time and blamed us that we should mention meat restriction while ordering.

2017-05-25,4.0,"Pretty good food. First time trying Ethiopian food and this place did not disappoint. This place isn't for the weak because you don't use utensils to eat - you use bread. Most people are afraid to touch their food, if you are that kind of person then you won't have a good time BUT if you are open to new experiences and eating the food the way Ethiopians eat it then this will be a great experience. I had no idea what to get but the waiter was gracious and answered any questions we had. We went with the one of the platters and just picked one kind of chicken, beef and lamb. I'm not the biggest fan of lamb, but they made it pretty tender. I liked being able to pick anything off the platter and eat it. Each bite was a new experience!  They also have gluten free bread! It's harder to be vegan or vegetarian since the protein is mostly meat unless you just want chickpeas, but that totally limits the flavors you can try. Dessert was the basil lime sorbet. First time I ever tried a sorbet that wasn't rainbow. haha It was a very good end to a delicious meal. I went back a couple of times because I really liked the food.

2017-03-02,1.0,"I've been a customer for years so it pains me to write this review, but there are soooo many good Ethiopian spots out there now you don't have to deal with bad service. So I was home one night with a lot of work to do and I needed the joy and brain power only a good kitfo can provide. I ordered delivery from here and after waiting well over an hour, my food hadn't arrived. I called the restaurant and got no answer. I called again and still no answer. I called eat24 and the rep put me on hold and called Demera. She came back on the line and was very irritated with how rude they had been to her, but hey, at least they answered her call. They told her my order was ""out for delivery."" She said she'd call me back in awhile and confirm I received it. She called back (and by now I'm bout to die of starvation) and I still didn't have my food. We repeat this whole process again. A few times. SHE is getting madder and madder each time she has to talk to them cause apparently they're being rude to her. They tell her they can't get ahold of the delivery driver (cause you know, cell phones are not things). Basically they did not care about taking my money and not giving me anything for it. The kitfo never came and they seemed pretty alright with that. Thank god I didn't order directly through the restaurant cause I got a refund from eat24. I was counting on an easy dinner so I could focus on work, but instead I got to spend lots of time on the phone and then walk my hangry ass to 7-11 for freezer pizza anyway. Demera, you had one job! Why?! At least eat24's customer service was excellent.  P.S. They don't serve dinich anymore. Ouch!",-0.8821,0.767,0.102,0.13,0.47380952380952385

We were quickly seated, our water cups stayed full, and the food came out in good time. We did the shared meal at $15 / person for the 5 of us. It came with plenty of bread (more than we needed!) and a variety of foods to pick up including peas, shrimp, chicken, beef, lamb, some type of greens, and beets.  I had never tried Ethiopian food before so I was looking forward to coming here. I personally did not like most of the dishes and was a little put off by the sour taste of the spongey bread (although the texture was fun!). I still give Demera 4 stars because although I did not personally like the food, my family did. That is just my taste preference.  You eat this food by ripping up pieces of the bread and using it to grab the protein dishes. Very hands on. My mom asked for a fork and they gave her a little flak which was pretty funny, but the server was not rude in any way. Just joking around. The overall consensus at the table was that it was a great meal.

2017-02-20,3.0,"I went there for lunch on Friday.  It was maybe 20% filled.  The service was fine, but the food was a disappointment.  I don't know if it was really this restaurant or I have had enough Ethiopian/Samali/Eretrian food.  Basically it is all the same.   Regardless of your choice, the food will come served upon a sourdough spongy bread called injera with more of the bread in a basket.  The bread will be used as a knife and fork.  It is like making your own tiny tacos. We had the assortment of dishes.  Each was pilled in a small hill on the tray.  Some of the dishes were mild and some were spicy.  In a general way, it all tasted the same.  All of the food was obviously served out of a crock pot.  Although I assume it was fresh, it is the type of food that can easily be saved and served again.  The texture of every dish was like baby food.   I have eaten at almost all of the Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago.  I think my problem is with the East-African food in general.  Let's take beef for example.  What happened to the expensive cuts, such as the tenderloin?  Generically, the beef is the absolute cheapest cut you can buy, regardless of which Ethiopian restaurant you go to.   You won't see pork on the menu because most Ethiopians are Muslim.  I'm okay with that, but the irony of selling liquor did not go unnoticed. Next to us was a large group of people who were having a good time and apparently loving the food.  So, I must conclude that I only speak for myself.",0.9343,0.843,0.101,0.056,0.5414965986394558

Our server was awesome.  She was really upbeat and friendly, and seemed to genuinely enjoy her job.  She made the experience very pleasant.   Overall, it was a nice experience and I am glad I tried it.  It's not my cuisine of choice, but I'm no longer scared of it!",0.9975,0.676,0.268,0.056,0.6129629629629628

2017-02-07,4.0,"Demera made it possible for me to have a very pleasant experience in trying Ethiopian food for the first time. My friend and I made reservations for Restaurant Week on a Monday at 5:15pm. There were a few tables occupied already when we got there. We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. As first timers with this cuisine, the menu could be overwhelming specially with the terminologies. We decided not to order from the RW menu and get the deals from their regular menu instead. We asked our server for recommendations on what to get for the Meat Messob for 2 which was $38. She explained how each meat is cooked and what it comes with so this was very helpful and we decided on mild heat level to be on the safe side. We decided on lamb, chicken, ground beef, beef strips, shrimp and fish. Each protein was cooked in different sauces and various ways as well. My favorite is the lamb, it was very tasty. I wasn't a big fan of the ground beef but my friend liked it. The Injera, which comes with all Messob orders, is a ""sourdough crepe-like bread"" that you could dip, wrap a protein or vegetable with, or just eat it on his own.  Eating Ethiopian food requires eating with our hands although if you're uncomfortable with the idea, the servers will happily give utensils if you ask. My friend and I savored our dish and enjoyed eating with our hands as well...to feel the authenticity of what we were having. Overall, it was a great Ethiopian cuisine-first-timer experience for me. I cannot say about how good the food is, compared to other Ethiopian restaurants because this is the only place I have tried this cuisine. The interior is simple and the place is clean and well- kept. Our server was very helpful, so happy to be of service, we did not wait long for our food to  come even if the place was filling up, our dish was very satisfying and experiencing Ethiopian cuisine at Demera is as authentic as it can get...in my opinion.",0.9962,0.815,0.172,0.013,0.6142046049188906

If you are someone who prefers quiet conversation as part of your dining experience, I would say this place is probably not for you. Coming to the food, we ordered chicken sambussa for the appetizer, which came with a tangy sauce, that was absolutely divine. The Demera messob for two that we had comes with injera bread, and choice of 3 vegetarian (we went for spinach and two kinds of legumes) and 3 non-vegetarian(lamb, chicken and shrimp) sampler portions. For someone who was new to ethiopian cuisine, I really enjoyed this option as it allowed me to find my way around the myriad options on offer. The food, in terms of the spicyness is very close to what I am used to with Indian cuisine. So, if you have a low threshold for handling spicy food, you might want to  let your server know your preference. No complaints about the service which was attentive, yet not obstrusive.

Everything was really good, you won't really go wrong if you choose between beef, chicken, lamb and seafood.  Anyway, the reason why I put only 2 stars was that first of all, you have to eat with a crêpe-like thing if you choose this great combo plate but I became bored quickly with the taste of crêpe. Also it tastes somewhat sour so I didn't want to eat with it. Secondly, the waiter didn't show up soon after we arrived, so we had to wait for a long time (at least it felt long) to order drinks and food.

For $16.50pp you can create your own 2 meat, 2 veggie combo plate, which means if you're not dining alone, everyone can get their own combo plate and you can start trying all the different types of meats and veggies they have on the menu. The only bummer is that if you want more injera bread it costs extra.  We got the following items: Vegetarian: - Ye-Misir Wot: Red lentils, always a staple and always a reliable one at any Ethiopian restaurant. - Quosta: Delicious, I always love spinach, but this was even better. You still have the soft tenderness and hearty taste of spinach but the Demera seasoning they used on it made it even more flavorful.  - Tikel Gomen: This one was okay - it's got carrots, potatoes, and cabbage. The potatoes were a bit overcooked and hadn't soaked up much flavor. I've made this one better so I wasn't super impressed with this one. - Yatkilt Wat: This one was amazing too. The squash and zucchini were so tender, and had soaked up all the Demera seasoning making a very flavorful vegetarian dish.  Meats: - Ye-Siga Alicha: The beef was tender, the sauce was amazing, perfect combination with the Ethiopian salad and some injera to balance out the strong flavors (not spicy) of this dish. - Ye-Beg Wot:  - Doro Wot: Good amount of food with this one, came with a hardboiled egg, and a couple sizable pieces of chicken that was cooked super tenderly that it just fell apart when you used the injera to pick it up. This is and always will be one of my favorites.  - Michetabash: I don't know what sauce they used for this, I assumed Demera's house special or something because they didn't ask for a preference, but it was delicious. I can't even really remember it because it was somewhat similar to the other meat dishes, with the same level of complex flavors that Ethiopian food is so well known for. You've got the sweet cardamom and cinnamon tastes combined with savory spiciness and umami.  I would recommend most everything at this place. I've stayed away from tibs because I like dishes that have more of a curry like consistency, but many people are fans of tibs. Will have to try that next time.

The place is much smaller than I expected it to be and the ambiance was ok. The food took a very long time to come and we were famished by the time it came. We ordered the veggie sampler, fish, the non-veg sampler and a couple more dishes. There was ample amount of food and most of it was very good. But I was a bit disappointed in the messir wat and a couple of other options in the sampler. Overall a good place to come if you are tasting Ethiopian food for the first time.

Especially the meat portions, which were lacking. We normally don't eat a lot of food but the fact that we still felt hungry after clearing our plates was not a good sign. On the other hand, it's a great sign food quality wise that we cleaned our plate. We ordered a meal for two, the three vegetarian and three meats. Because we still felt hungry, we ended up ordering desert and wine in addition. Our total bill was more than anticipated for such a light meal.

From the strip bulb lighting reminiscent of a Walgreens to the barely cold beer and service that is forgetfully forgettable, it's the food that is the worst part.  Got there and our reservation got us a table next to the kitchen, with the swinging doors to match.  Ordered the sampler. It's supposed to have a variety of meats and veggies all on a big Ethiopian flatbread, but for some reason our waiter ignored our preferences and brought out a catfish looking talapia and another fish dish, along with sour smelling cabbage and a few other vegetables. So as a group we now got fish and veggies.  Who the hell goes to an Ethiopian restaurant to have fish?  So now we were left having to order multiple extras, which was seemingly by design on their part as the fish went uneaten and frankly, inedible. After we got the chewy  lamb and bland chicken, that all went untouched too.  As a group we left most of the food uneaten, laughed about it, enjoyed the company and just wrote this off.  And btw, I have contention with their mention of Michelin. It's bullshit. They are not ""Michelin Guide Recommended"" but merely listed, along with 7500 other Chicago area restaurants.

2016-10-01,2.0,"Came here for my first experience with Ethiopian food because of all the good reviews. I wanted to like it but just didn't. We were seated fairly quickly, although it took a long time for our server to come over to get our drink order.  This was a theme throughout the night - for appetizers, to entrees, to even the check.  To start, we split the the sambussa - small fried meat-filled dough (empanada like) was tasty. We tried both the beef and chicken. The sauce that came with them was also great. However, things went downhill.  We ordered the meat messob for two, which is a sampler of 6 of their meat dishes.  We told our server this was our first time and asked for recommendations on what to order.  She was not helpful at all and even seemed annoyed.  I wonder if we didn't order the right things. I don't remember exactly but we got a mix of proteins  - chicken, beef and lamb and also got the Shrimp Wot.  You eat without utensils but use the Injera bread, sourdough flatbread that reminded me of a crepe, to eat the meat and sauce.  I didn't like the Injera bread nor its somewhat spongy texture. I found it pretty bland and, if anything, on the sour side. This is a problem since this is how you eat everything.  Aside from that, I wasn't impressed with the meats.  You had to pick 3 meats in Wot style (a sauce with onion, garlic and ginger root) with the messob platter.  The sauce was good but I found that this made everything taste the same. I couldn't tell which was beef and which was lamb.  I also didn't realize that some of the meat still came served on the bone.  The shrimp wot was the best thing on the plate and what I mostly ate.  Ultimately, while the food may be a personal preference, the lack of service is the final straw.  I can't see myself returning.",0.9066,0.875,0.077,0.047,0.5895962732919255

Was our first time eating Ethiopian food so we were at a loss, I asked server for suggestions and she suggested a messob, the one where you pick your sides. I was good, the meat items all tasted the same because they were in the same berbere sauce. Beware berbere sauce is spicy, so keep that in mind especially when dining with kids. We ordered a combo of sambusak, the lentil and chicken were tasty, but I did care for the meat sambusak. We were not given silverware, maybe you have to request it since everything is basically finger food. I ordered the ""shai"" which was warm and spicy, similar to a hot apple cider but without the apples. I would recommend this place to someone who wants to try Ethiopian food.

The location is quite far north from the Loop and areas where most tourists stay when in Chicago, but it's accessible by the city train.  I opted for a Lyft taxi which was $20 from the Loop.  Additionally, the location is directly across the street from Green Martini (don't quote me on the name), which was a famous hangout spot frequented by Al Capone, which is kinda cool! The restaurant serves a broad and diverse clientele.  The prices are a bit on the higher side for dinner, but the food does not disappoint. I felt the food was fresh and delicious and not too spicy, which can turn off the unacquainted.  The waitstaff was very friendly and more than happy to help guide patrons through the menu.  There's actually a glossary on the menu which explains the names of food items.  I thought that was great.   Even though we arrived later at night in the middle of the week, the place was pretty busy.  That says a lot. I think it's an elegant place to go for an intimate dinner, whether with just one person or a group.   There were multiple vegetarian items, meat dishes, authentic Ethiopian coffee, and Ethiopian beer,  There were actually meat combo items which is not common at Ethiopian restaurants; they typically offer combinations for vegetarian dishes.   I was very happy with the experience and enjoyed my time here.

Looking to escape the brisk weather, I asked if I could sit for 30 minutes before my reservation. The hostess asked for a few moments and had my table ready immediately. The warmth just continued from there as I ordered a delightful pot of chai. While the appetizers were quite lovely (lentil Sambussas, absolute perfection), the vegetarian platter intended for two stretched to three very hungry dinner patrons. With an extra order of ingeras (the fluffy, spongy sourdough flatbread), we were able to sample eight different Ethiopian dishes on a single ""plate"" (which was really just another ingera stretched out over a metal serving platter.) I have to give credit to restaurant which utilizes every single drop of flavor by creating an edible serving dish.  A bit pricey, but worth the dollar signs given that this restaurant is Michelin recommended. Be sure to make reservations! I made one a few days in advance at 7 with no problem at all. Even at 6 on a Thursday (while walking by), there seemed to not be too much of a rush.",0.8747,0.842,0.118,0.039,0.43147546897546896

I've felt that service was declining, and today was the final straw for me. I saw that Demera had started serving brunch, so when a Groupon was available for brunch I jumped on it!  We had a reservation for ten, but we were a little late, so I called to say we were still coming and apologize. The host confirmed that was fine because they aren't busy on Sunday mornings. When we arrived, we were the only people there, so that was no overstatement.  There was a server guy, and a new server he was training. This guy was one of the most condescending, loudmouth dumbasses I've ever encountered. He was having loud conversations with the new server, schooling her on everything from 'what is groupon' to 'how alcohol is the ultimate evil but the media controls our perception of good and evil'. There's something really ironic about hearing the guy who is getting you a glass of honey wine complain about alcohol and sugar poisoning society and how consumers are too ignorant to understand.... Let me just say, that's an interesting business choice.  Lots of other fun things happened, including the servers hanging out in the back for ten to fifteen minutes while their second customers of the day waited to be served, and while I waited for a fork to eat my omelet with. At the end, I asked if they could break a 100, and they couldn't (all good, it was early in their day) but then gave me a totally unsolicited rant about how they don't have any change and the managers aren't there, and how this is normal for the restaurant industry,all in the most condescending and inappropriate way. I don't normally name names in reviews like this, but I see many other reviews describing this guy. His name is Anthony, and he is not good.  The food was awesome as always. The Doro tibs omelet is delicious.

I think our server might have been a bit overwhelmed by having such a large group, but did a good job staying on top of things. We ordered a few bottles of their honey wine, a bottle of red, a few beers, and pitcher of the honey wine sangria. We also ordered a few sambusa samplers (5 sambusas each, one of each variety) and the family-style sampler for all but one of us ($15 per person over 8 people). The food was simply delicious! And there was SO MUCH OF IT. The lentil sambusa was my favorite of the appetizers. I liked everything on the main dish sampler, but my favorites were the beef, the yellow lentils, and the cabbage & carrot stuff.

2016-03-14,2.0,"I am not sure why this place is ""Michelin rated"" because my husband and I definitely didn't experience that quality. Here's how the whole thing went down. I called last Thursday for a reserveration for two people for Sunday, and requested a gluten free injera bread (made with teff only). The nice lady took down the notes and requested to call on Sunday morning just to make sure. On Sunday, I called around 11 to confirm the 1:00 p.m. reservation as well as the gluten free bread. Confirmed! My husband and I arrive for our reservation and was greeted by a very loud host who was definitely not friendly (at least to me). I thought maybe he's being biased (since I'm Indian). We got seated and out of the blue I brought up that I'm gluten free. He almost yelled at me saying, ""Yeah sorry we don't have any gluten free bread. So are you gonna to stay or go somewhere else?"" Those were his exact words! I took a few seconds to digest this rude remark, and politely replied saying I called on Thursday to make a reservation and already requested this. Once again, he goes off on a rant how they don't have gluten free bread and that we have to call the day of to confirm. I was on the verge of tears because I never expected to be ""scolded"" by a wait staff. I responded to that by saying (in a sheepish tone) that I did call this morning to confirm and I was told they have the gluten free injera bread for me. Another lady came to my rescue (she was super nice) and took the host inside the kitchen. He comes out and goes, ""Yeah well you're lucky we have a little bit left. Let me know when you're ready to order,"" and walks away. My husband and I decided to let that awkward moment pass and look forward to the meal. After we placed our order, the food arrives stone cold. I'm not even exaggerating. The bread seemed like it was sitting in the fridge all night and the dippings tasted like they've been sitting outside all morning. I don't think they were even heated up. I thought they literally gave us a platter that someone must have sent back to the kitchen. I have tasted Ethiopian food at over a dozen places all across US. This one by far is mediocre.

The prices are also very reasonable! I believe the messob plate is around $30. However, this place (as well as most of the Ethiopian restaurants!) are ALWAYS on Groupon, so you can save more money :) The groupon voucher, $38 for 2 people includes an appetizer or dessert, a combination messob platter, and a bottle of house wine, you can't beat that! Just remember to tip your waitress on the price of the original dinner.  My appetizer recommendation here are the lentil sambussas (although you only get 2 pieces and they're not very big). They come with this delicious, spicy, sweet sauce unlike anything I've ever tasted before. I googled the sauce and it's called ""awaze."" If they sold packets of this sauce, I would totally buy it.  It's made with berbere seasoning, honey, and a small amount of liquor I believe. The spice and complexity builds and makes for a tantalizing experience unlike anything I've ever had before.

We were asked to wait for about 10 minutes before being ushered to our seats. There were a lot of other people waiting to be seated so expect this place to be quite packed on weekends. We had to wait a while before our waitress came by to help answer our questions and take our orders. There are multiple combinations on the menu that makes it very convenient to pick from especially when there are vegans and meat-eaters in the group you are eating with.  Our food though took a very long time to arrive. Almost 25 minutes. I will assume it was so because of the high density of customers that night.  The vegetarian options were delicious and perfectly spiced. Unfortunately, none of the small pockets of curries on our plate were hot or even warm when it finally arrived. The two lamb wots that came with my selection were mouth-wateringly soft and juicy. Excellently cooked. The salad in the center of our Messob was way too tangy so we left that alone. The dish came with a generous side of injeras that we gobbled down easily and also worked on the original injera that the dish comes served on. All in all, a nice slightly upscale place with many combinations to pick from (meat or no-meat) but is slightly slow serving you dinner on a busy night.

2016-02-03,5.0,"The first time I ever tried Ethiopian food, I looked at it with disdain. I mean, to be honest, it's not the most appetizing looking food out there. ""I have to eat it with my hands too?!"" I thought. Let me just say, it was worth it. Ethiopian food has one of the best aromas and boldest flavors. Just make sure you're not wearing anything when you eat that you don't want smelling like Ethiopian food for the next couple of days. Demera is, in my opinion, the best Ethiopian place in Chicago. The interior is a little more on the formal dining side. You can go in there with sweatpants, but you might feel self-conscience. They have many options to choose from on their menu. I honestly haven't been dissatisfied with anything I've ordered. Everything is perfectly spiced, and nothing is bland. The meat is typically tender and pulls of the bones easily. Even the vegetable dishes are cooked nicely. Surprisingly, coming from a carnivore, the vegetarian dishes are my favorite (especially the Quosta). The sambussas (kind of like a flaky empanada) are so incredibly delicious. I could really just go there and fill up on those. I'm not even a big fan of wine, but their honey wine is fantastic. I couldn't even tell how alcoholic it was until about two glasses in when I was more than feeling it. It's super sweet though, so if you're not into that then I would avoid it. Two things you should know beforehand. Firstly, the food isn't terribly expensive, but if you're looking for a cheap meal then look the other way. Secondly, the groupon is an amazing deal. However, if you get the groupon, then it greatly decreases the amount of options you can pick from on the menu. You still have choices though. If you haven't tried Ethiopian food yet, then start with the best. Go try Demera.",0.9968,0.759,0.207,0.034,0.5829312865497075

2016-02-02,4.0,"This place is my go-to for Ethiopian. When I first saw the portions a few years back, I was like, ""That's it?"" The food is deceptively filling. You eat with the injera bread and it basically expands in your stomach.  Our last visit was on Saturday during Restaurant Week. They had a dinner for 2 special for about $30. This included a shared messob, appetizer, and dessert. We started with the beef sambussas. They come out fresh from the kitchen and with bebere sauce. The sauce definitely gives the sambussa a kick. Our messob included 3 meat items and three vegetarian. As always, it was a good combination of mild and spicy. One of our favorites is the Doro Wot. Essentially, it is chicken legs with farmers cheese and egg. It never disappoints. The only disappointment we have was the service. It took almost 10 minutes for any sort of service. The manager ended up seeing us and intervening. Everything was okay from there. We did not have an assigned server though. This could be because the restaurant was packed. We had a 6 pm reservation, and we were nervous that we would not get a table right away. We were seated right away. It did seem like they were turning people away at the door.  (Note - There was a concert going on at the Aragon Ballroom. I recommend checking ahead to see if you need a reservation.) Parking can be tough. There is a city lot behind the building. The restaurant also offers valet when concerts are not taking place. My recommendation is to either take the Red Line to Lawrence or use the city lot.",0.9577,0.873,0.102,0.024,0.4540100250626566

2015-12-13,5.0,"I've tried everything on the menu at both Demera and Ethiopian Diamond and I've been to each more than a dozen times. I hosted my birthday party this year at Demera. My party of 30 guests was accommodated at three long tables. I ordered the Vegetarian Messob for everyone, which basically included every vegetarian dish on the menu. They let me bring in cakes from outside and they served Ethiopian coffee and pots of delicious tea with cardamom with dessert. The dinner party was perfect and everyone LOVED the food! My favorite dish was Kayseer Ena Carrot Tibs, ""beets and carrots cooked with onion, garlic, ginger, and special Demera seasoning."" I recommend Demera for lunch, dinner or events. I'm a huge fan of Ethiopian food, and I'm familiar with every Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago. I hosted a party at Ethiopian Diamond a few years ago, and I love Ethiopian Diamond too, although I enjoy Demera more because the seasoning seems more expertly done and I like that Demera chops the veggies finer. I also think the meat is cooked better at Demera and is more savory. The only Ethiopian restaurant that I don't enjoy very much is Ras Dashen, because I think it's bland. Quosta, garlicky spinach, is one of my favorite dishes, and Demera does it the best. I ordered it at Ras Dashen a few weeks ago and didn't even want to finish it because it lacked both garlic and salt. I travel a lot and I try Ethiopian restaurants in every city I visit. Of all of the ones I love across the country, Demera in Chicago is among the best! As a lover of Ethiopian cuisine, I feel very lucky to have Demera here.  Here's my ranking of Chicago's three most popular Ethiopian restaurants: 1. Demera (A) Good for: Best food! They never skimp on seasoning and the veggies are cooked to perfection. Demera seems to use the highest quality ingredients and cooks them perfectly.  The service is kind, but not polished. If you're a stickler for very polished service, this might annoy you, but it doesn't bother me. I don't have a fit if I have to flag someone down to refill my water glass.  2. Ethiopian Diamond (A-) Good for: Very good food, although not entirely consistent. It can sometimes be too oily. The portions sometimes seem too small when I have dinner with a party of 4 or 5. Their service is the best! Their Clark St location has a buffet.  3. Ras Dashen (C-) Good for: Cheaper. The food is bland. Placing a carryout order by phone can be frustrating.",0.9967,0.775,0.201,0.024,0.5833405483405483

When the music suddenly got too loud for me, they turned it down on request. The food was very tasty, had a good variety, and seemed less oily than at other Ethiopian restaurants.

Maybe it did, and maybe it's supposed to be cold like that, and I so I suppose serving it cold is proper. It seems, though, like it ought to be no colder than room temperature.

I left hungrier  than I was when I first walked in the place. I didn't like the spices that they used to season the dishes most taste the same no real distinguished taste between them...I didn't know which one was the beef, shrimp or pork.  It was just glob of goop on a spongy platter that I was told to enjoy and couldn't!

The menu contains the usual suspects, and what we sampled - the vegetarian for two - was fresh and tasty.  Much to my surprise, the stand-out veggie option was the collard greens which were utterly delicious.  I thought the non-veg dishes, especially the shrimp, were less exciting, and I'd probably skip the sambusas next time - they taste like they are being fried in slightly too-old oil.  By DC standards, Demera is a bit pricey for Ethiopian (DC is the land of the $10 veggie platter), but it's certainly not breaking the bank.",0.8658,0.891,0.097,0.011,0.45043290043290046

2015-07-15,5.0,"Despite my love of sauces, spices, grilled meats, tasty vegetables, fried stuff, eating with my hands, and food in general, I had never experienced Ethopian food until our venture to Demera, a mainstay on the Chicago Eater 38. After a visit, I can safely say it's a well-deserved spot. If you like any or all of the above listed, you'll enjoy a visit to Demera. The stock menu seems to be getting the sambussa sampler followed by a messob sampler. Sambussa sounds like samosa, which is a good proxy. Basically, if you like deep-fried meat-stuffed carbs, then a sambussa is for you. My favorite is the lentil, and the spinach is good as well, but if you're a meat and potatoes type of diner, the chicken and the beef are for you. If you're spice-averse, avoid the delicious, peppery dip. The messob selection looks daunting, but the waiters are very helpful. Again, the lentils (#21) are flat-out fantastic, but you can't go wrong with anything. Carbosaurs will go for the potato and carrot (#28), while green fiends will dig the collard greens (#25) or spinach (#26). Meat-wise, I'm all about anything lamb, but there's plenty of chicken and beef to match anyone's fancy. The wots (#38 beef, for example) and tibs (#32 lamb, natch) seems to be the most recommended and ordered. Wash it down with an Ethiopian Beer on the menu--I recommend Bedele--and I will find you a gravely full man.",0.9858,0.813,0.164,0.023,0.6219444444444446

Some of food not that warm. The ones i liked were the meats with bones in it. Some were really good others were meh whatever. Nothing really stood out like omg i need to come here again. It does come with a salad though which is really good. The ones i didnt like were the ones that just look like mush or dog food(without the bone). The sourness of the bread really pairs great with the red based sauces not really with the green sauces which are already tart. Service: the restaurant was empty so idk how the waiter could be bad. She jus sat us down and thats it she didnt even pretend to hide or pretend to do work she just stood there and it was really uncomfortable. She only said ok ok thats it. Didnt explain anything she really made things awkward. The ambiance is okay not really pretty not ugly jus okay there was african art but nothing where i was like wow that looks great just looks like a bunch of crap from hobby lobby.

In the two times I've gone here, I've shared a messob combination platter with my friends that usually come with 2-3 veggie sides and usually 2-3 varying meats to go around that keeps a satisfied smile on every face.  Specifically I've got to call out the Ye-Bog Wot (spicy lamb curry) which is just BURSTING with flavor.  Tender pieces of lamb are perfectly soft within a fiery dark red-brown sauce that when paired with the acidic or textural lentils, and semi-sweet beet salad with injera forms a symphony in your mouth.  I'm not sure if it's the traditional way of eating, but I'm the type of guy who takes a little bit of everything and makes a injera burrito out of it, and whenever I have, I can't help but savor all of the unique flavors Demera brings to the table.  It is seriously fantastic.   Their desserts are no joke either!  I've tried their basil-lime sorbet and tiramisu (kind of strange for Ethiopian food, but whatever!) and both were awesome.  The basil-lime sorbet was sweet and tart with lime but also really herbacious with the basil as evident from it's dark green color - a perfect palette cleanser at the end of a filling meal!  Maybe not the most appropriate in the winter when I had it, but I can only imagine how divine it must taste in the summer heat.  As for the tiramisu - for me the coffee flavor was honestly a little restrained, but the sabayon covering it from lady finger to cocoa to plate was light, luscious, creamy, mousse-like and mouthwateringly divine.  If they just served me a bowl of that with the lady fingers, I could eat it for days. All in all, two amazing experiences for fantastically affordable prices.  I've heard they've started doing Sunday brunches too, so I'll have to stop in then sometime again and give it another whirl!",0.9956,0.771,0.176,0.053,0.5449156746031746

Tigist runs a great show there; she's a gracious host and knows how to make customers very pleased. Our waiter Dejan and all of the other bus staff and assistants were pleasant and efficient. And of course, there was the fabulous food; this time around, the flavors were strong and aromatic, the way I like food to be. The stars of my meal: kitfo (lub-lub style) coupled with ayeeb (that addictive cheese!), the samboosas (especially the lentil!), doro wat, lega tibs, kik alitcha, and gomen. It was my friend's first time eating Ethiopian food, and she loved it, too. The Ethiopian music playing over the sound system added to the atmosphere (I love this music!). I've been eating Ethiopian food for over 25 years, and this was the best of all meals I've had in this culinary heaven! Thanks so very much, and I will be back with many more friends and family!

The meal is served with a basket of sourdough tortilla like bread, which is what you eat the main course with). Followed by stewed lamb in a spicy sauce and beef prepared 2 different ways, both prepared mild, that came with 3 vegetables, we chose the potatoes with carrots that were a little sweet, but good, the lentils, which were fabulous and the collard greens, which were awesome. In the middle of our platter, was an awesome little garden salad with a wonderful vinaigrette, it was amazing. To drink, we had 2 Ethiopian beers, recommended by our server, they were nice and crisp. Our dessert was simple, vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. The food was great, the service was great, I recommended everyone come here for African cuisine.

Almost all the tables were empty (it was 5) and there were about for parties that were making the line behind us. When the host arrived, he asked if anyone had reservations. I didn't, but the party behind me did. We kept waiting. Then he came again and asked if anyone else had a reservation. And again another party did behind me did. I understand that if you don't have a reservation you have to wait IF THERE ARE NO EMPTY TABLES. The host was very rude by ignoring parties that didn't have a reservation. After five-ten minutes waiting in line and being completely ignored by the host we decided to leave the place. He didn't even told us ""we are working on it"" ""give me some minutes please"" or anything.  This is the way many restaurants can lose potential clients.

2015-02-01,4.0,"We came here for my friend's birthday. We arrived 10 minutes early, the first to arrive of our party of 14. The hostess told us we could sit at the bar. We were barely greeted by the bartender. When we asked for a drink menu, we were either ignored or the guy didn't hear us or maybe didn't understand English well. A few minutes later, a different guy came over, greeted us warmly, and gave us a drink menu. We didn't order anything yet because the rest of our party had started arriving by that point.  There were tables pushed together in the dining room to accommodate our party of 17. Only 14 of us ended up showing up, which luckily was no issue at all for the staff. I ordered an African beer that was imported from Nairobi, Kenya, called Tuskan and I enjoyed it. We decided to order as a group to keep things simple. I sampled different appetizers that looked like dumplings. One of them had sauteed spinach and the other had lentils. I got to take a bite of one of the beef-filled ones, which was also good. The lentil one was probably the stand-out of the three, though. We ordered several big pans of messob for the table. Lucky me (sarcasm), I got stuck with the vegetarian platter because my girlfriend and my friend's girlfriend are vegetarians. I thought it was going to be awful and would pale in comparison to the meat. However, I was pleasantly surprised; I loved the vegetarian messob! At first, I was weirded out by the texture of the injara bread (the holy sour flatbread used to dip into the food), but it worked out really well. Clearly the Ethiopians know what they're doing.  Our waitstaff were extremely attentive (there were multiple taking care of us). Our waitress personally apologized when one of my friends asked if there were free refills on the mango juice, saying, ""I'm so sorry!"" on more than one occasion. We also were given a bunch of crayons to draw on the tablecloth like kids. They put up with our crazy antics writing things all over the paper tablecloth. We also ordered a few desserts to share around the table, which were great. My favorite was definitely the tiramisu.  Overall, this was a really cool first experience trying Ethiopian cuisine. It was so novel to have a communal eating experience like this where everyone dips little pieces of floppy bread into a big pan of different food. So cool!  One tip I have is to do the Restaurant Week menu for two, if it's that time of the year! It's a really great deal. Our meal would have ended up being only $33 for both of us instead of twice that had we taken advantage of the deal. I would definitely try this again and next time go to Green Mill for jazz because it is literally right across the street.

I love Ethiopian cuisine and this place really sets the bar high. They have an expansive menu with items I've never seen before. The appetizer that's like a dumpling is amazing - we got the sampler and I never thought I'd eat what was like a fried tuna fish empanada (again, sounds funny but I dont even eat tuna fish and wanted more). But it was lovely as well as that spicy sauce that came with it. For the main meal, we asked our server for recommendations and got a nice variety of lamb, chicken, beef, bean, and veggie items.

So I asked if we could have a different table, as the restaurant was still almost empty at that time  and there was a lot of free room, we got transferred to the other table.

2014-11-10,3.0,"After a few years of wanting to try Ethiopian food, the boy and I finally made a trip to Demera. I was soooooooooo excited for this. I had attended quite a few concerts at The Riv right across the street, and wondered what Demera would be like....        I came, I saw, and it was just okay.  I ordered a meat messob for one which was 4 different meat choices.  My choices were Ye-beg Wot Ye-beg Alicha Doro wot Michetabish These dishes were supposed to contain lamb and chicken.  I really could only make out 1 piece of meat in the entire mix of the 4 items because the meal looked like 4 piles of sauce. I noticed one visible chicken leg, but the other 3 piles of sauce I guess the meat was finely ground up because I didn't really see it. Demera could easily have served me a veggie dish and I would've been none the wiser.         The meal is served with a sourdough bread called injera which is like a very cold pancake. I'm not really into sour dough bread, but for some reason I didn't mind the injera. The injera meshed really well with the sauces I had on my platter. My sauces were all very spicy which is fine because I Love, Love, Love hot food. If you can stand your food being really spicy go for it. My food was so hot that I left the restaurant with no coat on and I was completely fine while my two dinner companions were shivering from the cold!! That food had my entire body hot lol!  The flavors kind of reminded me of Indian Food which I really love.  I also had the beef  & chicken sambusa which I really enjoyed!! The dipping sauce was awesome. I tried Demera's honey wine, and It was good.          The service: my dog is more attentive than the waitress was. #PointBlankPeriod. The waitress was nice when we actually saw her. My two dinner companions and I were in the restaurant  a little over 2 hours, and we  only got asked for drinks twice, and never got water refills. The waitress pretty much stood behind the bar chatting with the bartender. When we arrived we got our appetizers within 15 minutes. The meals we ordered took over an hour and a half to come out. I wanted desert but I had no patience to wait based on us already being there over two hours. We actually watched everyone that came after us eat and leave while we sat and waited.  #GurlBye. While waiting I noticed gnats flying around. Shouldn't those be dead already!? It was cold out, and not to mention November was like 2 weeks away. Something inside that restaurant  is keeping them alive!!! To summarize my meal:     The flavors were nice, but I am a carnivore. I would like to actually see meat on my plate, and not mush. I prefer Indian food over Ethiopian. Indian food is similar with the spices, but you can actually see meat on your plate. Looking back on my meal $17.00 for 4 piles of sauce with sourdough bread is kind of expensive. I was full when I left, but when your  meal is mostly bread that's what happens. I'm glad to have finally tried Ethiopian food. I would like to try something with more meat involved because the spices were awesome!!

I think if you want to feel fancy or feel good about the fact that you are spending more money, than go here, but if you want some amazing Ethiopian food and pay half the price for the same thing, but not as oily and ya know, killer,  than check out Ras Dashen Ethiopian Restaurant down the street. like only a few blocks.

2014-09-06,2.0,"Rainy days do not keep non Ethiopian folks in especially when Demera is on the list of things to do. The place was hopping during a night full of torrential downpours and I watched the delivery guy make 3 trips inside to pick up orders while we dined.  I will apologize in advance for only taking one picture but fellow yelper Sarah has pretty much covered it.  We ordered the #18 Messob for two which included six items (at least three vegetarian). It is also served with a center of salad  and injera. I am the first to admit I had no idea I would eating with my fingers. I understood that it was culturally acceptable but with table linens, stemware and reservations I somehow thought it was at least an option.  We had the shrimp tips, lamb tips, a beef dish, chopped spinach, spicy lentils and spicy chickpeas. We paired our dinner with the Ethiopian house made Tejj (honey wine) which is now $26 a bottle.  Honey Wine- the wine is unlike any wine I have ever tasted. The first sip is sweet and tart. After the first sip I was reluctant to have more but after a few more sips the taste changed a little and I enjoyed it. Would I order it again.... Yes if others liked it or were trying it for the first time.  Vegetarian options- the two spicy dishes (lentils and chickpeas) were not spicy to us. In fact, they were pretty bland. (coming from a cajun girl and her Indian friend). The chopped spinach was okay but I would be inclined to order something different should there be a next time. We both opted to leave the leftover vegetarian dishes.  Meat - We absolutely loved the shrimp and lamb. They were bursting with flavor and the sautéed vegetables that accompanied them were also delicious. The beef was awful. Was any season used?!! We barely touched it.  Injera - this is the breadlike item which is  brought in a basket and used toeat each item on your Messob tray. I did not like its taste and wish there were a civilized way that I could have eaten without it that  would not leave my dining compadre grossed out. With no forks, you are forced to deal with it.  At a point I would use it to scoop my food up but I simply eat the veggie or meat out if the center and toss the used injera to a side of my small plate.  Service & Decor were nice. It is very clean, decorative and it has a polished appearance. Servers wore black pants, white long sleeve tops and black shoes. Different servers kept our glasses full of honey wine and water. It is the prefect setting for a 2 hour dinner because you can enjoy the meal without feeling rushed. It took 30 minutes to get the check and pay. We had to look around for a waiter to bring the check and after standing up the check on the table, it was another 15 minutes before they swiped our cards. Perfect for frequent diners, friends getting together after a long hiatus of schedule conflicts but terrible for folks who want to get in and get out.  Parking - there is a huge city lot behind the restaurant. Only $2 an hour.  Overall I liked Demera. It was great place to try with adventurous friends and ultimately a very enlightening ethnic dining experience. If I were to try Ethiopian again, I would prefer to eat some place that Ethiopians frequent themselves.

Those were the best from the sampler we ordered. And the sauce that comes with the appetizer is AMAZING! I put it on everything.  As for the entree, you receive 2 vegetarian options and two meat options, including seafood. They'll tell you that the entree can only feed one, but it will definitely fill two people, as long as you get an appetizer beforehand. The one downfall was our waitress. We informed her it was our first time. She was very short with us and uninformative. She basically didn't want to be there; however, other staff members were very sweet.

The right amount of spice, the right amount of bread, friendly service, but that's not even the best part (ready?)! Demera makes tejj, which is Ethiopian honey-wine.

I took a friend  from out of town who wanted something he had never had before. He's had quite a bit, but knowing where we grew up, I could easily bet he hadn't had Ethiopian food. As a new vegetarian, I hadn't recalled how vegetarian the menu was the last time prior. I was not disappointed, I was even genuinely surprised to see how amazing their lunch specials were considering how cheap the prices were. I had a decent size plate of delicious vegetarian food, while he had some meat choices that i recalled were great. He loved it, it was one of his new favorite places, and I was happy to introduce him to such an awesome, previously unknown food to him. A ton of flavor, the waitress was nice and kept up on our water as well as tea. She was quick to bring us additional bread as well. I've never had any other Ethiopian food, so I can't compare it to other things, but all I can do is make a comment on how the flavorful spices are very in relation to many Middle Eastern foods (which makes since when you think about trade routes, cultures, foods, you know). The atmosphere is nice and the honeywine is to die for. I just recommend, don't be a Eurocentric prick and refer to it as honey mead since its totally plausible for other cultures to have created things independent of Europe. The first time I was there, I heard this would-be hipster ordering the honey mead, despite clearly saying honey wine, and if he had any inclination of world cultures would've just stuck to saying honey wine. If it wasn't inappropriate, I would've laid him out (verbally) on the spot.",0.9961,0.763,0.206,0.031,0.568038493038493

2014-02-17,3.0,"My friends and I came here for dinner.  We started off with two appetizers:  the Chicken and Vegetarian Sambussa,  which were three thin dough shells stuffed with a blend of minced chicken, vegetable and herbs; and Ambasha, which was their so-called traditional skillet-baked bread served with your choice of two options - we went for the Ayib, which was the homemade cottage cheese flavored with Mitmita and spiced butter.  The sambussas were good, and the side of the hot red sauce was potent; I didn't need the sauce and the sambussas were fine on its own.  I did particularly like the Ayib; the bread itself reminded me of foccacia texture. The ayib itself had a cottage cheese-like texture, but was good. For the main entree, we decided to share the Veg-Meat Messob, which came with our choice of 2 meat and 2 vegetarian dishes.  We opted to go for the Ye-Misir Wot, which was labeled as 'spicy' - this was the split red lentil stewed in rich berbere sauce, onion, garlic and ginger.  It tasted what it was described on the menu - lentils in a spicy red sauce, which I thought was pretty solid; the Quosta was chopped spinach cooked with onions, garlic and ginger - like creamed spinach; Derek Tibs, which were dry fried lamb chunks with onions, green pepper and especial seasoning - grilled with a crispy exterior; and the Ye-Siga Alicha, which were the beef cubes cooked in a mild sauce of onions, garlic, ginger root and turmeric - my favorite - it was like a semi-thick stew of pot roast in this Ethiopian spice mixture.  All was great with the injera bread, which is pretty huge in diameter and you probably need about 1-1.5 rolls for yourself - it was spongy and slightly tangy.  We also tried the Ethiopian Tea, which was infused with anise, clover, and cinnamon - great with 1-2 teaspoons of honey.  Of course, I couldn't pass up a dessert, so I tried out their Missionary's Delight, which was plain vanilla ice cream served with mango juice drizzled over it - very good, not too sweet, and quite refreshing after a good meal.  The service was great, and the food was pretty solid! +sambussas (forego the sauce) +Ye-Siga Alicha",0.9977,0.793,0.199,0.008,0.6077278911564626

We got there around 6:30 and it was just starting to fill up. Our server was with us right away and ordered drinks (tejj - Ethiopian honey wine - for me, Ethiopian beer for him). We also ordered the beef sambussas, which are like empanadas with egg roll wrappers instead of dough. Our drinks and appetizer came out quickly, and all were delicious! The wine is very sweet, so pace yourself. I definitely couldn't have had another glass. The sambussas were so tasty for being so simple, and whatever spicy sauce came with them was incredible. I want to put it on EVERYTHING. For dinner, we ordered the Demera messob, which included 3 meat entrees and 3 vegetarian ones all on a large plate made for sharing. It comes with injera, which is basically like a sourdough spongy flatbread. Sounds weird, tastes good, especially with the different flavors of the food you're using it to pick up. We ordered chicken, lamb, and beef for the meats; spicy chickpeas, carrots and potatoes, and cooked spinach for the vegetarian portions. I loved the spinach, but didn't try the other veggies. My boyfriend said they were great! The chicken (doro wat) was tasty, but a little too sweet for me - lots of ginger and similar spices. The lamb and beef were less of a stew and more like meat with grilled vegetables, and I liked them a lot better.  Overall, the meal was delicious and I'd love to try it again sometime. Eating without utensils seemed a bit intimidating at first, but it's not as messy as you would think and ends up being kind of fun. Only downside: instead of giving us credit for our reservation, they chose to cancel it instead.

Service - also wonderful. The server was attentive and had great suggestions since we were kind of lost with the menu. They even brought me a free, delicious, dessert for my birthday.  The aftermath - here's where shit (literally) goes nuts ... I got the worst food poisoning of my life from this place. Eight days. EIGHT. DAYS. Anything you could think of that happens with food poisoning, happened. I had to go to the hospital and get pumped full of fluids and be monitored for a while. It was seriously hell on earth. Eight days. We were told it was likely ecoli poisoning. And honestly, this was the first time I have ever had something extend the 24 hour mark.  Pro - I did lose 11 pounds in the first three days, hahaa. Crash diet?! Con - the whole experience of getting that sick after a seemingly fabulous meal. You couldn't pay me to go through that again.  In conclusion, I'm disappointed that I'll never be returning. I do realize we may have gone on an off night. But, ecoli?! So disappointing. Especially from an Eater Top 38 restaurant. EDIT: the restaurant commented on my review saying I probably got ecoli from something I ate prior to or after visiting. I started puking three hours after eating. I had nothing else for nearly eight days afterward and this was all I had to eat the day I went.

Not as bustling as Ethiopian Diamond, but definitely livelier than Abyssinia, it's typically easy to score a table. Service at Demera is fine, I've never been to an Ethiopian place and found it particularly attentive. I will say that for the most part though, they are on the ball. I'm a creature of habit, ordering the same thing every time I come to Demera - the Addis Abeba, an Ethiopian twist on the margarita, and the vegetarian messob that samples the entire vegetarian menu. Demera has a lot of great messob, or combination, platters that allow you to try cross sections of the menu and mix proteins if you like.

I gave it three stars over four because our server was very pushy. Me and my friend didn't know the food and she was very quick and vague with describing the food to us. And kept coming back every minute for us to order. It was a little rude considering it wasn't even busy. Then she left and we had a new server. Our original one didn't even tell us she was leaving. The new server was nice. A little more professionalism from the first one would have been nice.,0.984,0.732,0.206,0.061,0.5062770562770564
2013-10-27,5.0,"My first experience with Ethiopian food and if it's all as Demera serves it, I'm in love!  We arrived about 30 minutes early for our reservation but they had no issue seating us early. Our waitress was very kind & attentive throughout dinner. Neither me nor my dining partner had tried Honey Wine ($22 for a bottle) before so we decided to try the Ethiopian specialty Tejj. We both liked it and it was a nice experience but I don't think it's something I'd get again. We then decided to get a mix of vegetarian and meat messob. Side note - all cuisine is eaten with your hands, so wash up! All of these stew-like items were served over a sourdough flatbread and a basket of additional flatbreads for scooping up the dishes. Quosta $10.95 - chopped spinach sautéed with onions, garlic, ginger and Demera seasoning - My favorite of the veggie dishes! It had great consistency, flavor and was spot on. Ye-Dinich Ena Carrot Alicha $10.95 - potatoes and carrots stewed with onions, garlic, ginger, tumeric and  special Demera seasoning. Fabulous dish with just a tad bit of spice to it. Ye-Shimbra Assa $11.95 - ground chickpeas shaped into dough, cooked in rich berbere sauce Ye-Beg Alicha $13.95 -  tender lamb cooked with onions, sliced jalapeños, garlic, ginger root and turmeric Doro Alicha Wot $13.25 -  two chicken drumsticks marinated in lemon and stewed in a mild sauce of onions, garlic, ginger, sliced jalapeños and rosemary; served with hardboiled egg & also with some cheese. I enjoyed this dish greatly, all flavors meshed so well together. My favorite of the meat dishes. Ye-Siga Alicha $13.25 - beef cooked in mild sauce of onions, garlic, ginger root and turmeric We finished up by sharing a dessert the Sambussa Turnover for $5. It's a sweet pastry filled with with almonds, walnuts, cardamom, rose water and saffron served over a raspberry sauce. I liked this dish but I'm not big on non-chocolate pastries so I could have done without it.  I left absolutely stuffed, slightly buzzing from the honey wine and pleased as punch. I would return in a second and plan to tell spread the word about the goodness of Demera! It gets quite packed so I recommend making a reservation.",0.9976,0.81,0.183,0.007,0.6610837438423645

The servers were great. Very friendly and helpful. They were able to suggest foods and explain what they were.  We had the Chicken Sambussa appetizer and we liked it so much we ordered a 2nd. Reminded me very much of Indian food and the sauce that came with it was to die for! We also ordered the infamous honey wine and needless to say I ordered 2 glasses. Quite sweet but still very good! When the food arrived I felt a bit nervous seeing this was my first time with Ethiopian food and I wasnt sure what to expect but it was AMAZING! What we ordered from The #18b Sampler which gave us 6 choices: Veggies: #26 ( Quosta- Chopped Spinach- wonderfully garlicy) & 28 (Ye-Dinich ena Carrot Alicha- Potatoes & Carrots) #28 didnt feel so far off from american food but it was REALLY good! Def. my favorite of the veggie choices. We ordered one other veggie but I cant recall what it was. Meats: Hands down I LOVED 53 (ye-shrimp wat) Oh my gosh so good! Spicy but amazing!

2013-08-31,4.0,"I'm not currently a vegetarian, but there are certain cuisines that I always order vegetarian dishes from, because they are so darned good, and Ethiopian is one of them. I've been to several Ethiopian restaurants in the city, and while this is not my favorite, I would never say no to dinner at Demera. Parking is not too difficult, the last time I came here, I got a spot just a block away on Broadway (by the post office). Getting here by public trans is also easy, as one of my dinner companions took the red line to the Lawrence stop, and I've come here by bus with my sister from Montrose Beach in the past. As for the food, I ordered a vegetarian platter, and liked that I was able to choose my dishes. I also liked that we each got our own little platter, so I could have the yeshimbra assa all to myself (I always feel like I'm hogging it when we have a large shared platter).  When they brought the food, mine had one of the wrong things on it, so they brought me a separate bowl of the missing dish (it was one of the lentil dishes). There were 4 of us dining together, and our food all came at the same time. Two of us had vegetarian platters, one had a meat platter, and one had a lamb dish. The meat platter looked good, but the various dishes looked the same, and the lamb dish looked grayish, due to the sauce (but then I'm not a fan of lamb or sauced meats, so I might be biased, but she said it was good). I thought our vegetarian platters were the most attractive, because of the variety of colors and textures. They were out of collard greens (which I was so looking forward to), so I got the spinach instead, along with kik alicha (yellow split peas), ye shimbra assa (chickpea ""fish"" stew), the spicy red lentils (forget the name), and the tikal gomen (potatoes and carrots). The injera is very good, and they give you plenty. The service was good, although we had to flag down the server to get our bill.  All in all, I would definitely recommend Demera, as it's delicious, reasonably priced and easy to get to via public transit or car. I just wish an Ethiopian restaurant would open closer to my neck of the woods (Sauganash), so I could get my fix more than every couple months!",0.9931,0.806,0.145,0.049,0.49706552706552704

The tables all around us seemed to get great service but literally nobody ever stopped at our table to check on us. My husband had to walk across the restaurant to find someone and ask for some water. Weird! But the last few times I've gone, the service has been ok so I am hoping that was just a fluke.  I think the veggie messob is delicious, and the times I've gone back I've had much better service so I think I know not to let them seat me in no-man's-land again.  My favorite thing is the Ye Misir Wot. I could eat a whole plate of that by itself. It's so flavorful and delicious! The rest of the veggie dishes are pretty good too- I've tried them all. I tried the sambussas and thought they were ok- I'd rather just eat the messob platter. Never tried any of the desserts.

I admit when I heard honey wine I automatically thought of mead. However, their honey wine is in no way like mead, well I mean it can get you quite buzzed like mead. The wine had this earthy almost roasted coffee light flavor with a hint of honey with no after taste. Yes, I know it is a weird description, but just try it and you'll see it is delicious but hard to describe.  Now on to the topic we are all wondering about...how was the food? I gotta admit the bread they give you kinda threw me off. It is like a crepe, but uber spongy with the thickness of a pancake, moist like damp sponge  with the taste of sour dough. Surprisingly, paired with the food it was pretty damn good.  FYI- they can make the bread gluten free if requested. Overall, the food was delicious!

Not only did I get good food, good wine, and good company, but I got a real live free parking space on Lawrence Avenue! When the stars align, friends, they knock the moon out of orbit. Demera is pretty and calm. Even with the restaurant about 3/4 full, and with a large group in one corner talking and singing ""Happy Birthday"", the Young Lawyer and I could hear each other's conversation easily. The lighting is strong enough that yours truly doesn't have to use the flashlight feature on her I-phone to read the menu, but subdued enough that my sunglasses weren't necessary. Service was prompt, professional and friendly. I didn't look at the Groupon deal myself, but we got a bottle of wine (something red). Thinking about this in the sober light of day, I have to wonder if that was part of the groupon. Well, what the hell. We could choose three vegetarian selections and three meat selections. There was some kind of restriction, because we wanted to try the chicken McNuggets (ye beg wot), but we couldn't get that. We asked if we could do the split 4 veg/2 meat, which was fine. As the Lawyer noted, it probably costs them less to substitute a veg for a meat selection. We had #21 Ye Misir Wot (lentils), Ye Shimbra Assa (chickpeas), ye dinich assa (carrots and potatoes), kik alica (peas), doro wat (chicken legs), and ye siga wot (beef). Of course, it's all served on one giant pizza-sized injeera, along with four more rolls of injera. Everything was terrific.

I couldn't choose the veggie sides ( they don't let you !) . I was fine with that since I was more focused on my meat dish . It came out under cooked , very spicy n flavorless . I was so disappointed and thought of sharing my friend's chicken dish . His dish was so tiny and had no chicken in it . We complained to the waitress but she chose not to replace my lamb dish and they were very unresponsive . Food was very bad and so the service .

Second, it's comparable to like a hybrid of Indian and Middle Eastern food. If you are with 2-3 people the messob is a nice big sampler dish to share. There are a number of vegetarian and meat options to choose from with this dish. There are mild and spicy options for most meats. Don't be afraid to go spicy. Their ""spicy"" not like fire-hot, but it does have a gentle kick. If figured a bottle of honey wine would balance the meal. (And it did!) Personally, the most unique things I tried was the injera, a sponge-like flat bread. It absorbs flavors like tofu, but does have its own subtle sourdough bread flavor. There is no silverware on the table, so you pinch, dip, and eat your food with the injera. Similar in utility to naan, but very different in texture! Friendly wait staff.

If you've never had Ethiopian, definitely give it a try. Demera is a great choice.  The menu here is quite extensive. For a great sample of everything, get a messob. If you are not into family-style (perhaps Ethiopian is the wrong way to go then), our server recommended an entree each. My friend and I split a Vegetarian and Meat Messob for 2. You get three vegetarian options and three meat options. We got Ye-misir Wot (spicy lentils), Gomen (collard greens) and Kayseer Ena Carrot Tibs (beets) for the vegetarian options and Ye-siga Wot (spicy beef), Doro Alicha (chicken drumsticks), and Ye-beg Wot (lamb). My two favorites were the Ye-misir Wot and Ye-Beg Wot because they were more stew-y/curry-like. It was PLENTY of food. The injera (like a sour crepe) that comes with the messob was enough for the two of us. Great prices too! Including tip, I spent $20 for a meal of that size and quality. It's a shame that Ethiopian is hard to take to go.  They have great service here. Food comes out really quick, the servers are really nice about explaining Ethiopian cuisine if it's your first time and making recommendations, and they don't hover. The restaurant itself is quite big and plenty of seating. Lots of parking options nearby as well (street parking and a lot right behind the restaurant for $1/hour) and it's right next to the Lawrence stop so it's very convenient.

(3) if you're indecisive or inexperienced with the cuisine (both apply to me), the Messob is the ticket! try a little of everything on a big platter in perfect portions to share.

The stand outs were Ye-Shimbra Assa (chickpeas formed into spicy little dumplings), kayseer ena carrot tibs (beets and carrots cooked with a slightly sweet sauce), and Gomen (really delicious stewed collard greens).

I came with a group of 10, and the majority of us loved it (except for those pickier eaters who were pre-determined not to enjoy). We did the restaurant week meal which is a meal for 2; it came with a bottle of wine, an appetizer, a combo of 6 items (my pairing chose 3 vege and 3 meat), and a dessert. Truly, that's way more than enough food for 2, I practically ate myself sick and there was way more to go. For the wine - definitely try the honey wine, but it's real sweet so a glass will probably suffice. The red went better with the food, though not surprisingly it's a short list. For the food - it was really good, some better than others. We had the sambussa sampler. The tuna sambussa was gross, the beef devine, and the rest were all good. And it comes with this amazing house-made hot sauce sweetened with a little honey. For our dinner combo of 6, I wish the server could have pointed out to us what was what as I couldn't differentiate between the meats and some were easily better than others, but I remember the spinach and the beet vegetarian dishes being delicious. For dessert I had the sambussa turnover, which was decent but didn't taste fresh.

Wish they sold those at Jewel or something, I could heat them in the oven for a quick snack now and then. Oh but easy on the sauce that comes with, it'll clear your nasal passages right out. The salad in the middle was really delicious with the dressing they had, though I wish we could have a fork for just that part. Eating with your hands was a fun experience and the chipati was interesting, though not what I remember in Africa.  We got a chicken dish with an orange type sauce that was both our favorite, a beef dish with cheese that was good but greasy, a lamb stew that was my second favorite, potatoes and carrots that was a hit, some spicy lentil thing that had too much tumeric in it, and another bean thing that we weren't particularly a fan of. Even though we couldn't tell you what the names of the dishes were we left completely stuffed and with leftovers in tow. (Which I had for lunch/dinner the next day and it was still as yummy as the night before). I highly recommend checking this place out, and if you go for a birthday they'll give you a huge piece of delicious tiramissu!",0.998,0.752,0.24,0.008,0.5117410714285714

We finally coordinated a time for dinner and made a reservation (though it didn't seem necessary for a weekday dinner at 7:30pm). To start, I ordered a white wine...but she brought a red. I said I thought it was a white wine and she questioned me. All the white wines are listed on one page separate from the reds so I'm not really sure where the confusion was (because I also pointed as I ordered to make sure she understood me...there seemed to be a little communication barrier). Turns out they didn't have what I wanted anyways so I ordered the honey wine (to which she brought ANOTHER red...more communication barrier...she repeated my order to confirm, I thought she repeated what I had said...turns out she said something else). I finally got the right one. Honey wine - good. interesting taste, but really really sweet. Wouldn't really recommend eating it with the meal because after eating some the food, the wine tasted even sweeter. Chef's recommendation for 4 - we didn't know what to order so we just ordered this. It was a great variety with 8 things total on the platter.  beets and carrots - surprisingly good, I usually hate beets. This was more on the sweeter side red lentils - really good, one of my favorite of the vegetarian options Split yellow peas - not bad, not great spinach and onions - good, not a standout Lamb (not sure which one) - really good. One of my favorites. Beef (also not sure which one) - very flavorful Chicken (I think it's the chicken breast cubed one) - definitely my favorite! highly recommended Fish - forgetful, it was just ok, not a lot of flavor The bread that comes with is pretty interesting. Tastes like sourdough bread with the texture/consistency of a thick crepe kind of. Pros - good food, great location (for me!)

I've been to other Ethiopian restaurants and prefer Demera.  The food is great and they make things easy for you, with helpful service and a glossary in the menu.  Seriously, a glossary.  That helps, because as much as I enjoy this food, I don't know what the hell any of it is called.  So don't ask me.  Well, I do know a couple of basic terms like injera and sambussa, but as far as the individual dishes, I am lost.  Today I learned a new word, messob, but that still isn't the name of a specific dish.  Plus I'm bound to get confused because ""messob"" sounds so similar to ""meekrob"" which makes me think of that classic South Park episode in which Cartman tells Kyle that he is full of meekrob (in addition to having sand in his vagina). Anyway, the yellow lentils and spinach are awesome.  I've tried all the vegetarian dishes and they are all great.  For some reason the meat dishes are no good.  Somehow the vegetarian dishes are all in the A range and the meat dishes are in the C range.  The sauces are tasty but the beef is dry and the lamb is fatty and chewy.  And you just might crunch down on a big piece of bone.  The chicken drumstick dishes are okay though. So just order vegetarian.  This stuff is delicious and filling, and we could all stand to eat less meat--unless you are in some kind of iron-deficient anemic emergency situation.  But then again, lentils and injera are high in iron, so...you're out of excuses.  Order the vegetarian messob and a few sambussas.

Fast forward to cashing in this Groupon.  I found the glossary on the menu to be extremely helpful.  Not only in terms of the dishes, but also the description of the injera.  I think it might be the only man-made superfood: gluten-free iron and protein in a spongey pancake.  Sign me up.  Also, our waitress was helpful and put us all at ease in this brave new world of deliciousness.   Since the Groupon was for the whole shebang, we had an appetizer, vegetarian messob, dessert and a bottle of wine.  They were out of the honey wine but the red we had was an excellent complement to the food.  Our appetizer was the sambussa sampler, and wowsers, they were good.  They definitely rock the boat if you're aiming for lower-fat eating (fried dumplings will do that) but sharing a couple is worth it.  Three of us shared the messob for two (choosing everything but #27, 28, 31)  and had plenty.  Especially me.  I ate a lot.   The prices without a Groupon are manageable and it's definitely possible to fill up without the appetizer/entree/dessert combination.  It's also a shade more elegant than you might expect on the corner of Lawrence and Broadway (no offense to Green Mill or the ghost of Al Capone).  I hope to visit and eat a lot again soon.",0.996,0.773,0.197,0.03,0.4984674329501916

Tons of flavour, none overlapping and more injeera than we knew what to do this. We tried the fruit medley, the flake pasty and the ice cream for dessert.

I also liked their beer selection which included Guinness, and Two Brothers' selections (I had an Ebel Weiss).   My personal advice in eating Ethiopian style is to finish your meal while the items are still warm.  I've found the eating near the end is not too appetizing when everything has cooled off and the food has been spread out every which way.  Of course, the opinion can vary depending on how hungry one may be!",0.9431,0.875,0.112,0.014,0.5627777777777777

2012-02-13,3.0,"Came here with a group of 4 on a Friday night with a reservation. Had one of the other three individuals rated this place, it likely would have gotten a 1 star review, but I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt based on one previously positive take-out experience. Were it not for the awesome Sambussa's (the spicy Vegetarian is by far the best item on the menu), the food could easily have been rated as 'bad.' Unfortunately for Demera, what Ras Dashen (literally a mile north) does well, Demera is particularly weak- as a result our business will be directed to Ras Dashen instead.  We ordered a four person messob with various dishes that came to be the chefs choice for the most part. Having told our server that we were new to eating at Demera, the initially friendly waitress nodded and went about getting our drinks. Upon returning 30 minutes later with our food, the platter was set before us, the waitress came by to check on drinks, and at no time was there any explanation about what was in front of us. We all waited as she literally stood at the end of the table, looked at our drink glasses, waited for an explanation, and then she walked away without saying a word. As a result, we were left to guess until she came around 20 minutes later to explain what we had been eating.  So, what were we eating? Tilapia, Chicken, Beef, lamb, and some yellow dish that looked like corn (I believe it was kitfo). The tilapia that we initially thought was chicken was clearly out of a can(?), was not fresh, and was inedible. The lamb literally looked and smelled like cat food, had bones in the otherwise soft meat (another thing not told to us as we dug in), and was another inedible item. The chicken was fine, but had no flavor or spice, and what we believe was a beef-like product had turned cold as soon as we started eating. The spongy injera was also tasteless and miles behind the Ras Dashen version. How an establishment with such great flavors in their Sambussas completely miss the boat on every other item on the menu is completely beyond me. If you are looking for Ethiopean in Chicago, try Ras Dashen. Better in every way, right down to the better African beer selection and tasty injera.

I was very disappointed in this because that taste is what I crave about Ethiopian food... and  is the only thing I can not replicate at home.  The second issue with my food was that every mini dish I tried was full of oil. So much oil that is broke down the injera so that I couldn't use the bread underneath it as a utensil like you are supposed to. It is also not a good feeling to have to eat really oily food with your hands.  Lastly, I was extremely disappointed in the service.

2012-01-06,3.0,"I took advantage of a Groupon deal here recently with a friend. The first thing I need to say is Ethiopian food is just not photogenic. While I usually like to see pictures of my food, this stuff always looks more like an art project brought to me by my cat. That said, the food is really delicious! And the one close up here of the Injera reminds me of rolled up carpet padding. I like to describe it to the uninitiated as ""Spandex Crepes.""  Now for the details: Ambience - This is probably he nicest Ethiopian place I've been to. It's spacious with lot's of room between tables, and there is a nice panoramic view of the bustling Lawrence Avenue/Broadway. intersection. It's clean, nicely lit and there are cloth linens and napkins.  Service - Our service was excellent. Seated by one young lady and served by another,  both were gracious, accessible and helpful. There was some ""splaining"" to do relative to the Groupon deal and how to choose from the menu, and they were patient with us as we went through all the choices. The food arrived quickly after we ordered. We never felt rushed. Food - The deal was a good one. Samosa or ""Sambussa"" appetizers. Spinach, beef and beans. Then we chose the combo platter which had 3 veggie and 3 meat entrees. A bottle of wine was included along with dessert. The appetizers were hot and not so greasy. The variety of vegetables, meat and beans very pleasing.  The entrees included a very flavorful beet dish/salad, Shiro,a legume mixture, Gomen, a collard green mix, Lamb stewed in Berbere Sauce, Beef with onions, garlic ginger, and turmeric, and Doro Wat, a chicken drumstick in a spicy sauce with a hard-boiled egg. These items were all bursting with flavor and healthy spices. And with the Injera they were quite filling, inspite of really being small amounts of food. So I love the food, the variety and the spices, but the only downside from my perspective is while I could come here solo, I probably never would.

The different meats and vegetables come laid out on a huge plate along with some sourdough bread, which from observing the people eating by us, is torn by hand and used to scoop up the richly spiced stews.

I liked quite a few of the vegetarian items too but can't remember what they're called. Many of their items were too spicy for me but I did like the ones that I could eat.

Food:  Every time I have been I get served plates of flavorless mush that taste pretty much the same. Incredibly unpalatable.  Veggie combo--flavorless mush.  Doro wot--again flavorless curry with chucks of equally flavorless chicken.  If this wasn't served to me as ""ethiopian food"", my taste buds would probably not recognize it as such. Also, the manager was ignorant.  Despite ranting on and on and on about how we should try the ""african veg combo"" and how there was an ""african band"" playing later, I'm pretty sure he thinks ethiopia is a city in the country otherwise known as ""Afrika"". Kind of annoying.  Atmosphere: The best part of the experience. Probably better than you will find at any other Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago.  I don't really get all the hype about this place, but as a general rule of thumb, if there aren't many ethiopian people eating at a supposed ""ethiopian"" restaurant, chances are the food is probably not that great or ""authentic"".  I guess if you need something to chew into before a concert  at the congress theater and you have extra cash you would like to waste, its okay.

Kind of like an Indian Samosa (which, hello, has such a similar name. There's some fodder for a lengthy Wikipedia search on the origins of food).  Next, we always do the messob platter. Here, you have many options. The idea is that the items you pick (usually six - veggie, meat, or a mixture of both) are served on a large, round platter. It's easy to try new things and fairly simple to accommodate people with food restrictions (e.g., vegetarians).  So, no utensils. No worries - you eat by ripping off small pieces of the soft, tortilla-like dough and pinching the food off the platter. Don't be shy, dig right in.  We did dessert once, but it was underwhelming. Given our fond love of everything else they serve, it's easy enough to fill up on real food and abandon this final course.",0.8845,0.859,0.094,0.047,0.5469155844155845

2011-09-07,2.0,"I have visited several of the Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Tonight my boyfriend and I were thus excited to use our Groupon at Demera, however we didn't have the best experience.  We had reservations at 830 and were promptly seated by a friendly hostess.  The restaurant was buzzing still, but not overly crowded.  10 min later when no one had come to take our order we flagged down the hostess and asked her to send over our server. She apologized, offered a few suggestions and took our order of drinks and an app and said she'd give us a few min to decide our dinner combination.  Fast forward to 20 min later, we have finished our apps, though no one has returned to take our dinner order. Once again we flag down the nearest person and ask for a waitress.  The hostess once again returns, apologies and promises to rush our dinner order.  I will give her credit, she did have our food rushed out. 90% of our dinner was quite tasty.  One of our meat dishes though had bone shards mixed in it.  I'm not talking about large discernible chucks that could be easily picked out, but literal tiny fragments which made it virtually impossible to eat.  We left that portion alone, which was fine as we couldn't even finish the rest since it was such a huge portion. Our Groupon also offered dessert.  Once again guess who had to flag down a server even though it was quite obvious we had been done eating for a while.  This time the hostess must has packed up and left because a different server came over.  We ordered our dessert, it wasn't anything special, but honestly I was so stuffed at this point I didn't want more than a bite.  At this point the restaurant is pretty cleared out, AGAIN we had to ask for out check.  Apparently tax wasn't included in the groupon, so we had a $6 bill.  Weird, I've never had to do that before but whatever, not a big deal.  AGAIN we had to flag someone down to take our groupon number and pay the rest if the bill.  I was a server for many years and can sympathize to a point, but this was truly ridiculous.  To sum up my wordiness, good food, terrible service.  Don't plan on getting out until 2 hours later.",0.9548,0.84,0.101,0.06,0.46681286549707607

I got the Yelp Deal to try this place out.  Made reservations and the table was waiting for us Sunday night Labor Day weekend and we were seated right away, at least the four out of six.  The decor was nice and very representative of Ethiopian art.  The walls were decorated with painting and a few statues.   The waitress took our drink orders right away and patiently waited for the missing couple for over a half hour to arrive.  I ordered the Ethiopian Honey Wine.  It was a little on the sweet side but one glass was good enough.   As the missing couple indicated they were closer to arriving we ordered an app because the rest of us were starving.  We ordered the Appetizer Messob-beef, chicken, tuna, vegetarian and spinach sambussa paired with ambasha.  Great choice and love the cheese and hot sauce it was served with as well as the special bread, kinda sweet, I would say close to a corn bread taste and texture but clearly different.  I would recommend this to anyone.   We were ready to order our main dishes so my BF and I ordered ours and I didn't pay much attention to what others got because ours was the perfect combo... be aware that when you order a main meat dish it comes with a veggie side... I ordered the usual as I always get at all Ethiopian restaurants as it's my favorite and I don't want to stray.  I got the Doro Wot (spicy)-two chicken drumsticks marinated in lemon then stewed in a delicious berberesauce with onions, garlic and ginger root, served with hardboiled egg and home-made cottage cheese with a veggie side of the Ye-Misir Wot (spicy)-split red lentil stewed in our rich berbere sauce with onions, garlic and ginger.  This was so good mixed in with my BF's order of the Derek Tibs-savory lamb chunks dry-fried with onions, sliced jalapeños and especial seasoning and his veggie of Quosta-chopped spinach cooked with onions, garlic and ginger.  I would order this same combo over and over again not to mention the injera- the sponge like tortillas served as the bedding of the plate as well as additional ones to scoop up all the yuminess of the plate.  I wish we could have taken the left overs home but we didn't have a place to store them.     We skipped dessert because we were way beyond full but I am a happy customer.  I can see myself returning for another great meal. Downfall- I ordered a glass of wine as we received our dinner but didn't receive it until I was practically done and because I was so full from the meal, that my friend had to help me finish it.  Overall the service was good and they were on top of refilling our waters but not so quick on the draw picking up our plates from apps and when our meals came they scrambled to make room.   When we got there it wasn't busy but closer as the night went on the place was packed!  Good for them, I always see that as a good sign!",0.9986,0.797,0.187,0.016,0.507472137791287

My friend who was driving is a bit of a worrywart about being late, so we ended up getting there quite early.  There was a sign in the window that said they didn't open until 6:30, and it was about 6:15 when we got there.  As we stared at the sign in stunned confusion, the sign was removed and we were let in.  There were about 2 other tables at this point.  We decided we would have some pre-dinner drinks.  Unfortunately, it took about 15 minutes for a server to approach us, at which point we were beginning to get hungry. I had a Groupon, and none of us had a clue what to get, so we asked the server to basically order for us - mixing up spicy and mild, meat and veggies.  The server did a great job of choosing for us, that was well-appreciated. We had the housemade honeywine.  It was very sweet and very yummy.  I would have preferred it cold though, rather than room-temperature as it was served.  The appetizer was my favorite part of the meal.  Little fried pieces of heaven. We had a mix of beef, chicken, tuna, spincach and lentils, mixed and spiced and wrapped in a phyllo-like pastry.  Yum! I should add that by this point, it had gone from just us and 1 or 2 other tables, to a packed house with a line.  When the main dish came, I was a little more nervous.  They brought a basket of bread (looked like a basket of towels to me...that's how white-bread I am). The bread is large pancake-like, but sourdough-y tasting pieces of flatbread. You are supposed to rip off pieces of this bread and kind of ""pinch-grab"" the main dish.  No forks here.  The main dish was served on a HUGE platter (about the size of a trash can lid) with 12 different choices from beets to lamb to chicken legs and lots in between.  Some of the dishes I liked, some I didn't.  I think they were prepared well, it was just my personal preference.  It did make for a fun experience. Lastly, dessert.  We shared two desserts.  One was fruit over an oatmeal cakey thing drizzled with honey.  This was good.  Not outstanding, but good.  The other dessert was a shortbread-y berry-y concoction that was DELISH. Overall, to me, the experience was better than the food.  I'm glad I went.  I'm glad I experienced it.  I would go again if someone else wanted to go.  But I probably wouldn't choose it.",0.9947,0.838,0.135,0.027,0.5835059523809525

Service was pokey.  Well, for everyone except the water server, who was making rounds like a mad man (thank you!).  We were seated against a wall in the back dining area by the bathroom hallway with just one menu (annoying, and we didn't get another menu until a good 10 minutes after we were seated and I asked for one again).  Anyway, once we finally both had menus and looked things over, we started with an order of chicken sambussa (excellent!  flavorful chicken/veg filling, spicy dipping sauce) and this honey wine I've read so much about in previous reviews.  The wine took a while to get out to us, and when it finally arrived I was more than ready for it.  It's served in unmarked glass wine bottles (are they actually making this here?), it was perfectly chilled, and was strong and sweet with a very unique taste.  I do recommend it if/when you're here!  The sweetness is a great combo to combat the spiciness of the food, really nice pairing.   We opted for a 3 meat/3veg messob platter, served with that delightfully fluffy/spongy bread, which I realized has the same texture as those awesome velveteen blankets I love so much.  I mean that in the best way possible.  I like the bread, really.   Our dipping materials:  - mild chicken drumstick with hard-boiled egg (can't really dip/pick up well, but we made it work) - beef & spicy lamb - yellow peas (my favorite of the veg., great curry-like flavor, chunky texture) - garbanzos (spicier than I thought!  but good...) - potatoes & carrots (THAT was fun, trying to scoop up / eat a rather large potato with our hands...  could we get this cubed please?) This is one of those mighty impressive dinner table pics, once the full platter arrived with nice salad garnish in the center, our basket of bread to the side, our honey wine bottle and glasses - ah.. perfect!   Everything was super flavorful, well presented, filling and delicious.  One of the few times I've seen my date throw in the towel before finishing everything.  Service was pokey to start, but they finished strong and did improve throughout the dinner.  I'd definitely go back if I'm in the mood for this type of flavor and food.  Yum!",0.9982,0.777,0.215,0.008,0.6352922077922077

Although there were only one or two tables occupied , once we were seated we weren't approached by anyone for what seemed like about 15-20 minutes.

It was delicious and thankfully no one was freaked out by all of the sharing.  Of the three places we've tried in Chicago (Ethiopian Diamond II, Ras Dashen and now Demera), I have to say Demera was by far my favorite in ambiance.  It was bright and clean with lots of windows and minimal decor.  The other two were much darker and more intimate but for a Sunday afternoon, this was perfect.  The food at all three were fabulous, I have to say this might be my favorite of the three though.  The vegetarian among us loved everything he tried too.  Surprisingly, I think all of the meat eaters loved the veggie dishes the best anyways. All of us loved the beets, shockingly.  They were kind of sweet and cinnamon-y.  The shrimp dish was my favorite and the sambussas we got as appetizers were TO DIE FOR.  Get the tuna ones, you will not regret it.  Unless you are allergic to tuna then you will probably swell up and die and then DEFINTIELY regret it. Service, well.... I'll choose to believe they didn't want to interrupt and want you to relax and enjoy yourself and socialize.  That doesn't explain why it took them 20 minutes to greet us and another 15 minutes to grab some beers.  Nothing really does.

The first thing you should know is if you want to bring your own wine, there is an $8 cork fee. No thank you. I walked here, but I think they have parking next door at only $1 an hour, which may qualify for the cheapest Chicago parking. This place is very easy to get to, being right off the red line at Lawrence or the #36 bus line.  When you first walk in, the aroma of the food is amazing. We wanted to try several different dishes, so we got the veg/meat sampler for two. The appetizer we chose was the chicken sambussa, which was the highlight of the meal for me. But when the main course came, we were kind of surprised that nearly everything was in a paste-like form. Granted, the beef, lamb, chicken, and carrot/potato dishes were our favorite (I don't remember which we got), and the Missionary's Delight dessert was a winner, but as far as entrees go I think we were expecting something a little more...solid. Service and atmosphere are both very nice (they have sidewalk seating), although during our meal (inside) I had to swat away two gnats. Ew. Also, we were presented with our check before the meal was over. Strange. The lag between courses seemed longer than it should have been with only a handful of other tables occupied.

One thing I'll say is that they have great desserts - I don't think I've ever saved room for desserts at any other ethiopian place, so this was a new experience, and an exceptional one at that (what can I say?

If you want to attain the best of the meal, I'd advise you to dig in with your hand. Literally. It was a Friday evening and we went in a group of six so we figured it'd be best to order the family style messob sampler. We had a vegetarian in the group so they allowed us to order a mix of veggie and meat dishes. It came in a huge bamboo-weaved platter in which the entrees were placed together. The sour Ethiopian flat bread was served in a separate plate. The way to do it is to hold the bread with your left hand and peel small slices with your right hand and proceed to wrap that around a piece of meat or vegetable in the platter. It can become messy, so it will be an ill advice to suggest children below 10 years of age to join in.  The food was great although I'm not a fan of the flat bread. Quite a few of the meat choices were spicy so if you're a spicy person, that'd be very satisfying. Many of my friends were also appalled by the presentation of the food. But I believe it's the quality and flavor that should be prioritized. Enjoy the meal open-heartedly and do not be judgmental. It can be a pleasant dining experience.

We asked for 8:00, were told to ""hold on"", she came back and said she had 8:30. We said that was fine. We gave our information and she said, ""Okay...7:30, for two."" ""No...you said 8:30."" ""Oh, you want 8:30 instead? Hold on."" We finally got a reservation for 8:30 and were very confused about the whole interaction. Little did we know that was only the beginning of the ineptitude. Fast forward to 8:20. We arrived early and were promptly ignored by the host. He eventually seated us at a table for four and set out four place settings. When we told him it was just the two of us, he seemed very confused. He took away the two menus, but not the other glasses and napkins. We proceeded to sit at our table be ignored for over 15 minutes. Finally, the host came by and asked if we want some cocktails. We ordered two and he scurried off without even asking if a server had spoken with us. About 10 minutes later our cocktails had arrived, but still no server had so much as made eye contact with us. We were even visibly TRYING to get someones attention. It was very frustrating. Finally a waitress from a different section came and asked if we were still waiting for two more. No, we're not. We never were. ""We are more than ready to order, please!"" We ordered the vegetarian sampler and an extra appetizer. The waitress was civil, but seemed kind of zoned out. The food came quickly and tasted good. Not amazing, but good. I'll take Indian over this cuisine any day. I also don't get the hype about the honey wine, it wasn't that great. The sambusas were quite good though. Of course, our second appetizer never arrived. Once we saw how much food there was, we didn't even attempt to ask for it. It wouldn't have mattered. Our server NEVER came back once to see if we needed anything else or if everything was okay. We finished the huge meal and patiently waited for our dessert (which was included in the sampler). Surprise! It never came. Not one server approached us to ask if we wanted tea and dessert (which we saw everyone around us being served after their meals). The only person who did a good job here was the bus boy. Our glasses were always filled to the brim with water. We had the yelp coupon worth $60. We didn't spend anywhere near that and our service was so horrible that we did something we've never done before. We didn't tip...I know, it sounds really bad. But, honestly, who would we even tip? The host got our drinks and one waitress took our order, then never spoke to us again. Someone else plopped our food down and ran away. No one deserved a tip. We dropped the coupon on the table and walked out without a word to anyone. NO ONE NOTICED! The food was no where near good enough to make up for the horrendous service and just plain incompetence of the wait staff. They had a million waiters and waitresses running around looking clueless or just hanging out up at the bar, laughing, and taking pictures. It was ridiculous.

We have tables of 4 coming at 7pm.""  I responded that we had a reservation.  He responded that we were early and that he couldn't seat us there and we'd have to wait.  After about 5 minutes we decided to go to our regular Ethiopian place, Ras Dashen.  We told the man that we were leaving and to cancel the reservation and again, he was rude again with his response, in which I could detail here, but the main point is that the man was yelling at us, the customer!  I really couldn't believe it!   Not only were we treated very bad, but there is a huge HOLE in the restaurant! I assume there are bugs and rats and other animals running around that place.  I am certainly glad that we did not eat there, and we will never eat there.  Bad service is one thing that can be hit or miss at a place, but a huge gaping hole?  Well, that is another thing.",0.803,0.873,0.071,0.056,0.6020178840767076

As far as the staff is concerned, they were professional and friendly.  I always rate how good service is on how many times I have to ask for water to be refilled.  The more times asking, the less attentive the service seems to be.  However, at Demera, I never had to ask.  Glasses were always full, dishes cleared and delivered right on time.   I'd recommend going on either a Friday or Saturday depending on how spicy food treats you.  (You might need a day to recover from all the goodness and fullness before heading back to work.)  And of course, coming with an empty stomach with a group of people or as a couple so as to share the food is ideal to sample as many dishes as possible.  The place gets busy, so reservations are recommended.   In any event, this is a new favorite spot, if not the reigning favorite at the moment.  You'll see me in here again ASAP.",0.9961,0.765,0.205,0.029,0.5528206168831169

I lived in East Africa for awhile so I'm also very familiar with high quality Ethiopian food, and Demera definitely has great quality food. They have lots of vegetarian and meat options. We had a group of four so we ordered one vegetarian mesob and one mixed meat and veg. We were able to have 8 of the 9 veg options on the mesob this way (we opted for two orders of shiro b/c that's a must!). All the food was great. The injera (Ethiopian bread) was also really good and nice and sturdy for picking up all the mixes.  I have to say as a general note to anyone who has never eaten Ethiopian food before: you will eat with your hands! You use the injera to pick up with various food. Don't ask for utensils -- seriously, just give it a try. It's not that hard. My only reason for giving Demera four stars and not five is that we went for lunch and they didn't have a lunch menu option, which meant the meal was quite expensive. In general, Ethiopian food is quite pricey in big U.S. cities so don't let that stop you from coming here.",0.9789,0.863,0.129,0.008,0.5845614035087717

While the selection was limited to just a handful of reds & whites, it was a very diverse selection and all bottles were under $30. We ordered a South African pinotage and it was really delicious. They also offer some Ethiopian honey wines which we did not try, but were very tempting (gotta save something for a second visit!). In order to maximize what we got to try, we decided to do one of the messob platters. (Which from previous experiences with Ethiopian, I knew to be the traditional way of dining, with various dishes served on injera on a platter to share.) We went with the vegetarian messob since I'm not a meat eater and neither of us were in the mood for seafood. In our messob platter we ordered: - red lentils - ground chickpeas - split yellow peas - mixed legumes - chopped spinach - potatoes & carrots The favorites were the red lentils which had a really flavorful, slightly sweet sauce; the chopped spinach which was sauteed perfectly with onions, garlic & a hint of ginger; and the legumes which had just a little bit of heat to them. We also enjoyed the chickpeas & yellow peas but they didn't stand out quite as much. The only dish I would say wasn't a hit was the potatoes & carrots. It was alright - but kind of basic, no real 'wow' in the flavor department.  We had no issues with the service. We had wine ordered and delivered within a few minutes of sitting down and our water glasses never sat empty. I left with fingers smelling of turmeric and garlic & onion breath that could probably knock someone out. Both pluses in my book - but probably not so much so for the folks around me afterward!  **Note - they do have a full bar but you can BYOB with an $8/corkage fee per bottle.

They were really good. Our entree was presented on their authentic, homemade bread and because I'd done my research I knew exactly what to expect, but my taste buds couldn't adjust. It took everything in me not to ask for a fork or spoon b/c traditional Ethiopian cuisine is eaten with your hands. But after the gnat experience I just couldn't get into it. The meat was tasty but the whole experience was overshadowed by the poor upkeep of that filthy bathroom and the fact that a guy off the street came in and went straight to the kitchen along with a young lady.

Cons:  *Stanley Tucci clone/ restaurant manager guy was super hyper to an annoying level- ran around frazzled all over the place all night- almost ran into me while we were being seated- by HIM- sort of freaked us out.   * The bathroom sinks had no working hot water, and in January, in Chicago- that equals an icy-cold and unpleasant hand washing experience.  If you are required to eat with your hands and will need to wash up afterwards, hot water might not be too bad for business.   *Service was a bit slow, but very pleasant and sunny.  We will be back!",0.9888,0.76,0.184,0.055,0.5457502374169041

The food is good, but they take it easy on the spices.  It makes sense to keep the food as accessible to a wide range of palates as possible but it makes the food taste kind of plain.  It's not bland, but nothing really excites either.  Also it's not a lot of food for the money.  They're counting on you  filling up on bread since you use it to scoop up the food.",0.7346,0.888,0.087,0.025,0.5795068027210883

Finally, I have decided to pay you a visit.  After hearing nothing but great things about Demera for a long time I finally have the chance to stop by over the weekend for dinner. Friends have been raving about it, especially the vegetarian and vegan options. I arrived with a friend at about 8:30ish and the place was packed. Great! Always good to see a neighborhood restaurant supporting itself. Finally we sat down and I was starving. I started off with the vegetarian sambussa and I'm going to say WOW. Awesome. It was one of those strange vegetarian moments where you could have sworn you were eating a meat. The lentils, onions, and peppers were perfectly spicy. Time for the main dish. I went with the ye-misir wot which was described as split red lentil stewed in our rich berbere sauce with onions, garlic and ginger. Sounds good! My friend got chicken so I looked the other direction and acted like I didn't know him. It took awhile for our dishes to come out so I was starving. The plate came out on the huge plate with a little bit of extra lentils and what looked like spinach. This was my deal breaker. I was told that you dip and use your hands. Cool, that's fun. What I was told, was that the bread was nothing like pita or naan, but a slippery, sloppy, rubbery sponge. The food was fantastic, but I just could not get over the ""bread"" that was served. I know it's ethnic, I get that but it was a little distracting. Loved the stew, loved the spinach, and everything else. But you can keep the bread. I did enjoy it though!

2011-01-08,4.0,"We stopped in at Demera on the urging of some friends before a recent Aragon show - I've eaten Ethiopian before, but not here, so I was keen to try. I can't remember what we ordered, but I know there ended up being lamb, beef, chicken, tilapia, spinach, cabbage, red lentil, and chick pea options.  The lamb was good, although with bones, and I was careful to pick one without, since I would be eating with my hands and didn't want to make a mess. Chicken was...well, it's chicken, and it tasted like what it was cooked in. The beef was very good, and the tilapia may have been the winner. Good sauce with nice fish flavor. As for the veggies, I could skip the cabbage, but the spinach was good (very reminiscent, to me, of good Indian saag). The lentils and chick peas were especially good. I've always said I could do vegetarian if I could get access to good Indian food, and maybe I can amend that to include Ethiopian for a little change of pace. Both very satisfying.  Our tab, even including a couple beers, was less than $55 for four of us - considering we left stuffed, really really reasonable. And big big kudos to the very helpful manager, who we kind of put through the ringer - two of us stopped in without a reservation to get a table for four as others parked the car, and he said he could squeeze us in after maybe a 10-15 minute wait. We decided that would be too tight with the upcoming concert, and left, but not after he said he'd likely be open late with the nearby concert, and thus we could always stop by after the show - just make an Open Table reservation from our phones when the encore started and we'd be all set. Then we met our companions, and changed our minds. So we went back in, but he had promised the space he cleared. No problem - we could eat at the bar immediately, since a party was just leaving. Great! He even recommended a BBQ spot that reminded him of Memphis when he heard me describing a recent vacation there to some friends.  Needless to say, with tasty food, super reasonable prices, and helpful staff, I am really looking forward to going back.

I've had Ethiopian once before and LOVED it (ahem, Ras Dashen).  I loved the flavors, the communal atmosphere of the cuisine, etc. and was very excited for another take at it.   My friend and I stopped by for dinner on a Sunday evening a few weeks ago before heading to the Green Mill and at that time, there were only a couple of tables seated.  We were greeted by our server who took our drink order (a diet coke) and food order consisting of a few meat and veggie entrées.  She gave us each a water.  Twenty minutes later (no exaggeration),  a few more tables arrived and still diet-coke-less and with now empty water glasses, we had no trace of our server since we sat down.  The place was a ghost town besides the hungry patrons.  The others around us were whispering and craning their necks as well in search of service.  Thirty minutes into 'dinner', she appeared to greet the newly-arrived and now disgruntled tables and eventually dropped off a watered-down coke in which all the ice had melted.  After forty-five minutes, the few round of appetizers were brought out to those who had ordered even before us.   Sixty-minutes in, meals began to exit from the kitchen (this is after I watched two tables stand-up and walk out and their drinks sat on their tables for the duration of our meal as no one bussed them).  The food was borderline warm and in my opinion, just okay.   Oh, and then they were preparing for a party of some sort so for a good 5 minutes, employees emerged from the wood-work to drag tables around in circles on the tiled floor deciding how best to arrange them and it was so loud and intrusive, that over the cold and overly-salted food, my friend and I could do nothing, but laugh.  It was like a joke was being played on every one there.   The others around us were just as shocked and appalled at the entire scene (from food to atmosphere) so it wasn't an isolated experience.  This place has such excellent reviews that I expected so much....I'm not giving up on Ethiopian, but next time I'll just stick with what I know.

2010-09-20,3.0,"I had my first Ethiopian meal in Adams Morgan in DC back in 1996. Yes, I know. I'm old. But, besides the Geritol, the point of that introductory sentence is to say that I have been eating this food for years. As such, there are a few things I expect when dining at an Ethiopian establishment. 1.) Authenticity. One of the things I look for when going to an ethnic restaurant is if the dining room is filled with people of that particular ethnicity. I figure that if folks who know this food and can, likely, prepare (some of) it, are willing to shell out cash to eat it, so should I. Likewise, if no one of that ethnicity is around, I have to wonder why. When I came to Demera, I spied one table with visibly Ethiopian people. In fact, my table was the only other brown one in the joint (A-A and Desi in the house! What what!). I think I discovered why. 2.) Taste. My food was pretty bland. As was explained to me by my dining companions, India and Ethiopia share(d) a spice trade route, so some of the flavor combos are similar. Makes sense. Perhaps in catering to its audience (good business), the boldness of those flavors were nowhere to be found. I've rarely had bland Ethiopian food, but I would categorize this food as in dire need of spice. We ordered the Demera Messob for three. The veggies were definitely the star of the show. The lentils, spinach, carrots, and cabbage were all pretty tasty. The meat dishes, however, were indistinguishable from each other and all under-seasoned. The injera was pretty good. It wasn't as sour as I have had it (and, to my understanding, the sourness is an Americanized thing). We should have ended there, but we saw dessert on the menu and thought, 'why not?' Probably shouldn't, would have been a better sentiment. The coffee was delicious, strong and served in jebena. Awesome. The desserts... meh. I ordered the volcano and did not care for the sweet/spice combo but that was my fault. I've never known Ethiopian food for its dessert options and should not blame Demera for me not enjoying them. 3.) Service. While I have never received ""Be Our Guest"" service at an Ethiopian restaurant, I am used to 'polite intrusion' or 'reserved enthusiasm.' Here, we received the brush off. Like others have mentioned, it takes a while to get someone's attention and when I finally did, I was greeted with a sigh.  o_0  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you had just finished running a marathon and need to catch your breath. You poor dear. Please, take a seat. Is there anything I can get you?

Thank goodness I had my groupon so I didn't feel ripped off. The spongey bread threw off the taste of every dish. The dishes themselves were not bad. I enjoyed the potato, the tilapia, the spicy beef was tender. But overall the bread completely ruined the dishes for me because it made everything taste super sour. It over powers every other taste.

2010-09-06,4.0,"I'll probably give it a 3 star but the extra star is for the value for money lunch special. We went on Labor Day, around 145 p.m. and the restaurant was not crowded. There were 3 tables of 2 persons each, already tucking into their meal. Two four-persons table ordered food before we did, and we waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive, after we ordered it. Since we ordered everything from the Lunch Special menu, we were puzzled by the long wait. So if you do want to try this place for lunch, make sure you have a leisure afternoon off from work and isn't too hungry to begin with. The lunch special is extremely valuable at $7.95 per person. You can choose 4 out of the 8 dishes available on the Lunch menu. The only down side is that they only have beef available for the lunch menu. Before I went to Demera's I was keen to try the lamb dishes, since they all look very yum. The beef cubes that came with the lunch menu was very good. They are very generous with the portion. Although it was a lunch special, they did not stinge on the meat/veggies at all. Once I get over the idea that I have to wait almost an hour plus (seating + getting the waiter's attention + waiting for kitchen to prepare food) for the food arrive, I might be brave to try out the lamb at Demera's =p",0.9929,0.819,0.173,0.008,0.5966760037348272

Definitely an interesting experience because I'm not used to eating with my hands. The meats were mostly spicy and very hot. I liked the meats better than the veggies. Only thing was that the bread made me very full within minutes (so I asked for a fork and started eating just the meat and veggies). I'm not sure I'd try it again only because I don't think my stomach can handle the amount of spice I ate today (and usually I can handle a lot of spice).

2010-08-25,5.0,"Allow me to preface this review with the fact that prior to my visit to Demera, I had never enjoyed Ethiopian cuisine.  I was also extremely weary of how my brother-in-law described the process as ""communal eating without utensils"".  I'm a fairly 'traditional' silverware guy.   Having said that, my experience at Demera was superb. We were a fairly large group and decided to order a meat messob for two (six choices) and a vegetarian messob for two (six choices).   I can't recall all of the dishes that we chose, but I can remember the Quosta (chopped spinach cooked with onions, garlic and ginger) & the Ye-siga wot (beef stewed with berbere sauce, flavored with onions, garlic and ginger root) standing out as my favorites.   Demera also offers a couple Ethiopian beers among twenty-or-so other imports and domestics.  The Bedele (Ethiopian) was a solid Pilsener.   The service was good.  I don't believe my ice water ever passed below the half full threshold and our waitress was patient and polite.   If you are like me and either have never been to Demera or haven't ever had Ethiopian food, I would recommend taking a minute to glance through Demera's website.  Their entire menu, with descripitions & their reasonable prices, is posted there (very helpful when writing a review).",0.9643,0.874,0.109,0.016,0.4796825396825396

2010-08-22,4.0,"We went here because the reviews said it was a cut above the rest of the Chicago Ethiopians places. And it was. It's a little more Western-paced and less laid back than some of the other African restaurants we've been to. The tables are western, no traditional woven mats or anything, but at about 8 o'clock, when the traditional dancing lessons begin... it becomes clear that eating here is supposed to be an Ethiopian experience. I'm not going to promise that you will get lessons in chest-bouncing dancing every night, but this place starts out very respectable and then gets quite lively as the night goes on. You're not just coming to eat. You'd do well to arrive late on a Friday and expect to stay a while for dancing.  The meal is what you might describe as a variety of curries eaten with injera soft low-gluten flat bread. It's not literally Indian curry, but that's the idea. The servers create your meal with you based on a brief discussion of the menu, which has some complexity to it. If you drink, you have to drink the honey-wine of course, though there are many other options.  I wish I remembered all the details of the meal but I am writing this review a month afterwards and all I can recall in detail is the chicken pastries.

Trying Ethiopian food was on my bucket list and because I had never given it a try, I headed back last night.  I had no idea what I was doing and neither did my dinner partner, so I was very happy that the manager and my server were able to create a meal based upon me loving spicy food and my boyfriend's inability to tolerate it. We started with sambusses, which are like flakier samosas (sans potatoes). Then, we just asked for the meat-chicken-vegetarian surprise, which worked out great. Getting in touch with my Irish side, one of my favorites was the cabbage and carrots, which were a little sour and complemented the spongy injera bread. I had heard about this Ethiopian bread/eating utensil on Check Please, but there is really no way of describing it. I love pretty much anything sour and chewy, so it was a very pleasant and unexpected combination with the savory flavors. Pairing all of this with a delicious Spanish dessert wine and a tiramisu that had the consistency of a bread pudding just added to the list of the surprises. It was not what I was expecting at all, but that wasn't a bad thing. A review on Check Please could never give you a full picture of what Ethiopian food really is; you need to experience it yourself.

It really stuck out to me because between him and our server, they were very nice and very helpful with selecting what we were going to get. We ended up going with the messob sampler. It included some of the sambussa which was an appetizer. We ended up going with the chicken and the beef, both were awesome. Next came the entree which 3 of us split. I really enjoyed some of the items but disliked some things too. My favorites were the beef and carrots, and both of the beef stew like samplers. We also got dessert with the sampler.

Parking on a Friday night was surprisingly easy -- we found a spot right in the front. In the service department things were not as smooth.  All went well until we got our check -- where we were charged for some appetizer we never ordered; however when I pointed it out our server apologized and quickly took care of the situation.  We split the bill to the 2 credit cards and after we both signed our bills, the waitress appeared again and said she had to re-run my friend's card as it did not go through.  Other than that, all was well.  Definitely recommend this place -- and will go back myself.",0.9894,0.797,0.188,0.014,0.553452380952381

Having tried Ethiopian food once before and was not fully impressed, at the urging of my awesome coworkers, I decided to keep my little foodie tummy open and try it again! (also our groupons didn't hurt either!) The 6 of us girls split 2 bottles of delightful wine (didn't pick it, wasn't sure what varietal it was) but it was delicious! We also split 5 entrees. And..I'm going to try and describe them because I am too ignorant to remember the names. A chickpea dish (slightly fried cripsy balls of chickpea in a dark sauce). Collard greens. kitfo (raw beef, kind of like Ethiopian beef tartar but no raw egg on top). Gourd Gourd (rare beef dish in a slightly spicy sauce) and a lamb dish.  For a girl that could live off just meats, this will probably be the one and ONLY time I will ever say this. I enjoyed the veggie dishes more than the meats, ESPECIALLY the lentils that came on the sides and the salad! I liked the kitfo (despite my uneasiness with eating raw beef). But the gourd gourd being super super rare was impossible to eat for me. I couldn't' chew through the meat so I ended up swallowing LARGE chunks of beef. I tried 2 pieces, because like Andrew Zimmern says ""try it again just to make sure you hate it"". And the lamb was pretty good but a little overcooked, which I found ironic since the other meat dishes were not cooked/barely cooked.  I think the main reason why Ethiopian food is just not for me is because of the bread. I love the idea of eating with hands, I'm ALL for that to eat everything. but the bread is just too sour for me. Sour and yeasty and too squishy.  Why am I giving it 4 stars? I guess because the staff was so hospitable. Our group of 6 girls were loud, rowdy and probably really annoying. But the staff was super friendly, they only came by if it looked like we needed more food or drinks and never gave us the stink eye like they should've.

I went to a diner group at Demera looking for some adventure and found two things: a new love of Ethiopian food and a renewed willingness to try new things.

We walked in without a reservation, so we had to wait a few minutes, and with the manager's apologies were seated at the table closest to the restroom. In my eyes, not a big deal, as we were lucky to be seated at all with all of the hustle and bustle around us.  Our server was prompt, answered all of my new-to-Ethiopian friend's questions, and made some stellar recommendations for the meat courses. Onto the food! Drinks: Tej for me, beer for my friend, both very good. I find tej wonderfully refreshing and a perfect balance to Ethiopian food.  Appetizer: Chicken sambussa. Beautifully seasoned, not at all greasy. Main: veggie/meat messob. It was difficult to choose because my friend and I have such different tastes (she loves lamb but I don't eat it, I like spicy but she can't handle it), so we had to make some compromises. We ordered the veg/meat messob, with the following dishes: ye-shimbra assa (25), shiro (27), tikle gomen (30), ye-beg alicha (33), doro alicha wot (40), and michetabish (44). I really enjoyed all of the veggie dishes, and am seriously considering going back to try beyanetu, which is a sampling of every vegetarian option. I just love the seasonings and preparation. I can't speak for the ye-beg alicha, as it's lamb, but my friend devoured it quite happily. The doro alicha wot was tasty but nothing to write home about, and we both agreed that the michetabish was the best meat dish by far. We gobbled it up and ate the injera upon which it was served as well. Such a wonderful array of flavors, delightful really. Dessert: Ethiopian-style tiramisu. An excellent portion for two people to share after a very filling meal. Light, fluffy, and not at all soggy the way lesser tiramisu can become.  Our waitress was great, as was the manager, who came over to check on us as we ordered dessert. About 20 minutes after we paid our bill, he came back to us to ask if he could relocate us to another table, because there was a party of 10 coming in. We were happy to get up, and told him we were considering heading out anyway, but he offered us another round of drinks to thank us for moving. So we accepted, and he came back with our drinks quite promptly, making some nice conversation before setting up for the large party.  All in all, a delightful evening. 4.5 stars for the food (which will probably be a 5 when I don't have to compromise on what I order) and 4.5 stars for the service (only because I had to wait a long time for my water to be refilled), with a bump up to 5 for the manager.",0.9984,0.795,0.193,0.012,0.5859183673469386

I would actually say 4 1/2 stars - the only drawbacks to this place were: a) it was uncomfortably hot in the back room - not sure if they don't have AC there or if it's just poor air circulation and b) there was supposed to be live music, and we saw the guys setting up and then 2 hours later, packing up, without ever playing anything. all this however, is of no consequence when you consider the food and the atmosphere. We first went to Demera a month ago and were turned away after an hour's wait because the reservations were backed up.  (note to self - wait a week after the groupon comes out to try the restaurant!) The manager felt so bad that he gave us his card and told us he'd ""take care"" of us next time.  Indeed he did - two bottles of wine, on the house, and he came back several times throughout the evening to chat and check up on us. The waitstaff was equally wonderful - so, so friendly and helpful with decision making. And the food - I thought I had died and gone to heaven - EVERYTHING was fabulous - the sambussa apetizers and special cottage cheese, amazing. Our family style platter had ample options for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike, and though everything was on the same platter, the chef would have gladly separated meat from veg if we had asked. The chickpeas and beef dishes were my faves, but everything was flavorful and delicious.  They even have gluten free injera (spongy bread that you use to scoop the food) if you call ahead.

We had a communal platter for dinner with the vegetarian options kept well away from the meat options. The injera (spongey bread) came in a generous portion and they even have gluten-free injera which tastes exactly the same much to the pleasure of my GF friend. If you are GF, phone ahead and they will have more options for you, the manager and waitress both informed us. The staff was so wonderfully considerate of me as a vegetarian and my friend who is gluten intolerant. This place is really popular so be sure to make a reservation.

I was sooo craving the injera!  We had the vegetarian plate for two. We especially loved the spinach ones. Our least favorite one was the beets, but then again I have never liked beets. I would have to say that is the first time I have even been able to tolerate the beets. We each tried the wines. They were nothing to die for, but they were ok (red wine). The waitress was kind enough to let me sample a couple before I chose the one I wanted because I was unsure of which one I liked. Overall, this place was a steal for the groupon deal (we paid 20 bucks for $40 worth of food...so after having paid the 20 on groupon we only paid $9 extra plus tip for two!). The dining experience was great. Parking was pretty easy to find since we arrived after most dinner rush (at about 8:30 ).

Most of them were ordered spicy, and Demera delivered on the spice. My favorite part was the veggie dishes. One was a mashed chick pea. The other was lentils. Next time I come here, I'm tempted to order strictly veggies. We couldn't leave without dessert. The hibist volcano melded citrus with earthy spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, and clove.

First impression, the taste was great and new.  Really an interesting blend of Arab and Indian.  Which totally makes sense since Ethiopia is on the trade routes between those two cultures.  The injera has a very pronounced sourdough flavor which I love.  Some people just dont like the spongy consistency of it but it was fine for me. The second impression was not so good.  The lamb had number small bones in it and my beef dish had several ""tendony"" parts that I had to toss.  For dishes which you are supposed to grab with the injera I would think that the chefs would take enough care to not serve bones and tough pieces.  I would never serve that to my guests.  To me it shows either laziness or an inattention to detail.  Or perhaps it is just cultural and for them it is perfectly fine.  But my brother even got a piece of bone in his cabbage side dish, now that just should not happen.

Imagine my delight when I found Demera, a cozy Ethiopian restaurant with a friendly neighborhood vibe just up the street from the Aragon.  Being vegetarian, I asked the server for menu recommendations and she pointed me to the vegetarian messob, which offers a sampling of the vegetarian dishes. I went with the beyanetu for one--for $15, you get a sample of every vegetarian offering on the menu. It's a lot of food, and might be better if shared with someone; but so delicious! The injera bread is so tasty, and I enjoyed the many flavors in the sampler.  I also tried the Ethiopian tea, which was spicy and enjoyable.  When I mentioned to my server that I was seeing the Pixies, she told me that I'd get $5 off my meal for showing my ticket or ticket stub for any show at the Riv or the Aragon. This apparently applies to all purchases over $10. So keep that in mind if you're going to a show nearby!

2010-03-20,4.0,"This was my first experience eating Ethiopian so as well versed as I think my pallet is I had nothing to directly compare the food to. That being said, I knows what I likes and here's my opinion. Food: Good, really good. Well spiced, most of the dishes we ordered (we did a combo platter of 6 different items) had a bit of heat to them and as a lover of spicy food this was right on the mark. A few minor quibbles would be the salmon was slightly overcooked for my liking but that could just be because I generally like my salmon pretty rare, and the injera (bread) was a bit too vinegary for me but this was easily combated by loading each bite with food. Overall though the food was quite good, I particularly liked the lega tibs, special kitfo, and ye-shrimp tibs. Service: Attentive, knowledgeable, we didn't really test the service much but we didn't need to and I would consider that a good thing. The food was a little, and I emphasize little, bit slow to come out but it was a Friday night and we didn't order appetizers so I don't even think I would call this a complaint. Ambiance: I just don't like live music when I'm at a bar or a restaurant, maybe I'm too buttoned up or old fashioned but it's just not my thing. That being said, the music at Demera was actually pretty good, not too loud - which is key for me, and (i presume) authentic. However I really could have done without the dance instruction and MC-ing, I don't like trying to talk over someone who has the advantage of a microphone while I'm dining. Again, I'm probably just an old man, I'm sure it would be enjoyable for others. Outside of that the place is casual, quaint, typical neighborhood place. Value: Phenomenal, prices are unbelievably reasonable and portion sizes ample. The two of us were stuffed at the end of the meal and all for $20 per person INCLUDING tip, and we had one of the more expensive samplers (messob) which included seafood. I need to eat more Ethiopian now to see how Demera holds up but for a first experience I left happy, and full.",0.9968,0.807,0.184,0.008,0.5220278587625526

The head manager told us about how the old servers (off the boat Ethiopian servers) couldn't even open a bottle of wine.

So we went on down there and gave it a whirl. I got my favorites... doro Wat and Kik Alicha... both were good, but sadly, I've had better. The injera was good... not too vinegary which can often happen at an Ethiopian place.  I had an Ethiopian wine which was a suggestion of the server and it was delicious.

2009-03-12,4.0,"It's been about a year since I last visited Demera, not long after it opened. This restaurant has definitely earned its fourth star. They have worked out the kinks, in food and service, and provide a fun dining experience. I visited last night with four friends. Some of us were completely unfamiliar with Ethiopian food, others had some experience, but none of us were pros. The server did a great job of explaining the dishes to us, and suggesting some of her favorites. She helped us figure out how to best order for our group, and even gave us a pen to keep track of our choices. On top of that. she was very friendly and funny, and never made us feel uncomfortable with our ignorance. The service is fairly slow, but if you're in that much of a hurry, go across the street to the Broadway Grill. The menu is fairly long, but very descriptive. A lot of the preparations are similar (stewed with Berbere sauce, stir fried, dry fried), so if you take a little time, you can figure things out. And as I said above, the servers are always ready to lend a helping hand. The Messob dishes are combination plates of meat or vegetables or both, so that's a good way to order for a group. We ended up with 8 or 10 different items, which was terrific. The beet and carrot dish convinced one diner who doesn't like beets that they might not be all bad, and the spinach quosta was great. We also had beef, lamb, poultry and shrimp dishes, and each had it's own character. I was a big fan of the dry fried lamb, and the beef kifto, a kind of tartare, was excellent. On my previous visit, I wasn't crazy about the injera, the bread you use to eat your dinner. I liked the flavor, but thought it was too thick and cumbersome. The injera last night was perfect -- sturdy enough to hold up, but thin enough that you were able to pick up a decent amount of food. If you don't know, you will be eating with your hands. If that's a problem, there's always the Broadway Grill. Demera used to offer a lunch buffet. They now offer a lunch special of four items for 8 bucks. It's a much more civilized approach to dining, and a great deal. I still don't have enough experience with Ethiopian food to rate Demera five stars.

The only thing that prevented this from being a five-star review was the wait for our food, which took slightly longer than I'd have expected.  Never the less, I do recommend Demera and will be returning.",0.2476,0.843,0.085,0.072,0.4845704948646125

She brought us menus and our waters, and we decided to start out by ordering the sambusas which are very similar to the Indian Samosas.

Nine Ethiopian restaurants?  In my day (growing up near Detroit in the early 1990s) we only had one Ethiopian place (this place called the Blue Nile in Trapper's Alley downtown), and we liked it!   You might get shot there!  But we liked it!  The food, of course, not the potential of getting shot. The reason so many people from the suburbs went downtown to the Blue Nile was how unique and, seemingly authentic, it was.  This place really went all out with their setup of eating off low wicker tables sitting on beautiful rugs on the floor.  And that's what Demera lacks - a feeling of authenticity or like you discovered some form of food that is exotic and inaccessible (though I'm not sure it's possible to even get that from Ethiopian anymore).  It felt odd walking into a relatively upscale Ethiopian restaurant and eating off a sleak glass table.  It almost feels too sterile, too clean. Great for health inspectors, I'm sure, but not great for total immersion. I noticed when I walked to the bathroom that they do have an area in the back where you could sit on the floor and eat and I might request to do that in the future.  Though it only looked like three tables and this place gets crowded. Atmosphere (or lack thereof) aside, the food is really good.  I got the Vegetarian Messob (a combo platter of four vegetarian dishes) for $14.50 and for the price it was a perfectly sized dinner (often Ethiopian places seem to charge more and give too much food) .  One of the dishes on it, the Gomen (collared greens) was the best Ethiopian food I've ever had in Chicago.  The other three dishes didn't quite measure up to the high bar the greens set but were still tasty. As far as finer Ethiopian dining went, it wasn't a horrible experience and I did enjoy the live music as opposed to the canned, scratchy recording that many Ethiopian places choose.  But in this attempt at a ""better"" ambiance, I ended up longing for a run down Ethiopian joint.  But, hey, at least they don't supply silverware to totally ruin the experience.",0.971,0.841,0.104,0.055,0.594090909090909

Plus, they didn't seem to be very knowledgeable about their beers.  When asked the difference between the three ethiopian beers, I was simply told the most expensive beer (and the largest) is very good.  Uh, great, but how about whether they're lagers or stouts, etc?

That in itself was wrong, but the chicken has tomatoes in it, the potatoe & carrot dish was oily, and the zil zil tibs (beef strips) was served fajita style on a hot plate and was horribly overcooked.  Not an enjoyable experience at all whatsoever, I'm sticking with Ethiopian Diamond further north.",-0.2909,0.867,0.054,0.079,0.6297364672364671

But I wasn't too fond of the extraordinarily bland beef dish that I ordered (uh, we ordered by number, so I really don't remember what these plates were called). My pal I's salmon dish was better, but it gave off a hint of that unmistakable fishiness that I sometimes find issue with when eating salmon. I couldn't help but wonder if the fish was either old or of poor quality. As chopped up and highly spiced a fate as it was led to, any sub-par fish would easily be well-masked with this preparation. Still, it wasn't terrible. My fave was suzanne s.'s cabbage and carrots dish--not pretty, but fresh and lovely tasting.

But, it looked really inviting from the outside and by the time we left the place was filling up.  We have never had Ethiopian food before, but we're adventurous eaters so we asked our (very sweet) waitresses for recs. I can't tell you exactly what we had, but on top of an appetizer we had one beef dish and one chicken dish. Lots of yummy food! While other people on yelp had problems with the wait, our food came out very quickly. But, maybe once the place fills up the wait can get too long? Also, a note on the service -- All the wait staff were friendly and attentive, but it was also clear that they did not have a ton of experience. I wouldn't call it obnoxious or rude, but family run and laid back. If the restaurant makes it, I'm guessing that with time the service will become more seamless.  The food is served family style, so it was really easy to share. I think the next time I go, I'll order one of their  sample platters where you can pick 4 meat dishes, 4 veggie dishes, or 2 meat and 2 veggie dishes. This way you can sample lots of different food. Also, the table next to us ordered a fish dish that looked SO GOOD. I'm not 100% sure what is was, but I think they plated a whole fish.

Overall, I thought the food was quite tasty.  My table ordered a variety of meat and vegetable dishes, and almost without exception, they were well-prepared, flavorful, and filling.  I particularly enjoyed the lamb tibs and the red lentils.  The sambussas that were ordered as an appetizer, while tasty, were a bit on the greasy side. The dining room was also pleasant, warm, colorful, and roomy.  The live music - provided by an incredibly bizarre-looking octogenarian wearing a blindingly teal get-up - was a nice touch. Now for the negatives.  First, the service, while courteous, could only kindly be called incompetent.  We waited for the server to make her initial visit, we waited for our appetizers, we waited for her to come back to take our dinner order, and we waited, and waited, for dinner to come out.  Needless to say, we did a lot of waiting. And when the food came, we were a bit perturbed to see that the four separate meals that were ordered - for nine people to share - came on a single platter!  As you can imagine, having nine people feeding off of one platter requires a level of dexterity and flexibility that generally does not lend itself to a relaxing dining experience.  When we tried to explain the problem to the waitress, she looked at us as if we said, ""I hate puppies"" - total bewilderment. Final verdict - would I come back?  I'd say yes, as the quality grub outshone the service problems.",0.9537,0.828,0.12,0.052,0.5672380952380953
2008-01-01,2.0,"I was hoping for better things from Demera.   They're just down the street from us and we have been eagerly awaiting their arrival.  But after having lunch there, I don't think we'll be in any hurry to go back.  We never received menus and were ushered over to the buffet.  With eight options, half of which were vegetarian, I didn't feel like I had much to choose from.  Everything was okay, but I've had better.   My boyfriend ordered coffee when we first were seated, and a half hour later, he had yet to receive it.  At this point, we were pretty much ready to leave.  It wasn't until he asked for the check that the waitress explained to us that their coffee takes much longer to prepare than what we are used to.  As a former waitress, I think she should have told him that to begin with.  The coffee was good.. but when you only have so much time to dedicate to lunch, it'd be nice to know if a cup of coffee is going to take 45 minutes.   My boyfriend also felt sick after eating here.  I think I'll head a little further north next time I want Ethiopian food.",0.9365,0.853,0.113,0.035,0.4096681096681097
2007-12-27,3.0,"Four of us went here for lunch today. We were not overly impressed with the buffet...it looked a little tired/like it had been sitting for a while. So, instead, we simply ordered off the regular menu. Perhaps not as good an economic move, but better in terms of food.  I don't have their menu in front of me now so I can't remember the names of each dish we had but I can summarize: We had the tilapia in berbere sauce which was good though could have done with larger chunks of fish. We also had a lamb dish and it was disappointing. The lamb was a bit tough, not so tender at all, and it was a bit of an etiquette question in terms of the bits of bone and where to put them. We had the yellow and the red lentils. The yellow were better. Then we had a steak dish with cottage cheese and goshen. It was great...so many fresh spices going on and then BAM a fair amount of spicy heat.  The coffee is definitely enough for two...I drank most of one pot and boy was I h-y-p-e-r. The service wasn't all that friendly. Not mean or dismissive just not all that attentive...when we asked for a recommendation the young woman wasn't all that excited about giving one.  Ras Dashen's meat courses are maybe a little better...and they have a wider variety of vegetarian dishes.  There's a parking lot behind the place, $5.",0.5596,0.849,0.079,0.072,0.4924961256692026
2007-12-25,5.0,"I didn't quite know what to expect when I first set foot in this restaurant. I had never tried Ethiopian food prior to this and I was a little nervous. On first glance however, this place did not disappoint.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very charming and relaxed. The walls are decorated with all types of art and on the night I went there was live music. The service was excellent and the waitress was extremely helpful in explaining to my friend and I what everything was. The food itself was very delicious, however there didn't seem to be much variety amongst all the dishes. Everything we ate was a little on the spicy side so at the end of the meal we ordered a pot of Ethiopian coffee. At first this seemed a little risky since a pot cost $5, but the coffee was worth every penny. It was sweet without having to put sugar in it and had a slight anise flavor. On top of the that it was served in what looked like a small clay pot, but the amount of coffee coming from said pot seemed to be endless. This is a great restaurant  and I highly recommend it, especially if you want to try something new. I went with a friend who is often skeptical about trying new and foreign foods and now even she wants to go back.",0.9883,0.806,0.172,0.023,0.48895562770562767
2007-12-22,4.0,"WOW!   So this new Ethiopian restaurant just opened in Uptown.  A friend and I decided to be adventurous and give it a try. Are we glad we did!  In my humble opinion, this has the ability to become a true Destination restaurant on the Chicago scene. As we hesitantly stood outside, deciding whether or not to take a plunge,  a couple was exciting. I quickly asked them.. So what is the food like?  They both said, Great, MUCH better than Mama Desta's... and thus began our evening. The food and service was EXCELLENT.  We walked in and were immediately greeted by smiling faces and waitresses in what I assume are native Ethiopian dress.  They were extremely accommodating. When we sat down, we were asked if we had eaten at an Ethiopian restaurant.  Years ago, we said, at Mama Desta's... she smiled and said, with confidence, we would enjoy ourselves more there. And was she right! The restaurant itself is very relaxed and unassuming. One of the very first things we noted, was the diversity of the patrons. It pretty much epitomized why I love Chicago.  Folks of every race and orientation, were all smiling, enjoying themselves.  The decor is OK, and I hope as they become more successful, they add a bit more authenticity.  The tables are well spaced, so you don't feel crowded.   There was jazz music playing!  And at the perfect level to both enjoy it and have a conversation. I find more often than not, when a restaurant offers music, it tends to overwhelm the experience. This was not the case at all. NOW FOR THE FOOD... OMG!  It was phenomenal!  I will not pretend to remember the names of what we ordered, but it included what is like a chick pea somosa, followed by a perfectly spiced chicken dish and a rosemary beef fajita type entree (that was at the suggestion of our waitress, who was spot on.)  It came on a large tray complete with a small salad, chick pea spread the best greens I have ever eaten. All of this with the crepe like bread you use to eat everything. Again, it was almost fajita like in terms of how you eat dinner.   As I said, right now I do not know the names of everything, but with what I am sure will be my frequent returns, I will have them memorized shortly! I do have two suggestions for the owner. 1. The lighting was too bright.  I understand that they lower it later in the evening, but this restaurant has the chance to become a great date night destination. Please lower your lights upon opening. Also, they had no wine list, which was a bit annoying. The waitress was very gracious in going to the bar and finding out what was available, but she should not have to do so. But overall, a phenomenal new restaurant , not just for Uptown, but for the city.  As they just opened,  I am sure they will do some tweaking, as any new place would, and I look forward to returning very soon.  ONE COMPLAINT...$4.50 for a Miller?  $5.00 for pretty much every other beer?  Now, that my friends, is ridiculous.... Again, this is a great date restaurant or one with a group of friends!  I highly recommend it and look forward to going back many many times!",0.9987,0.766,0.21,0.024,0.550447443181818
2007-11-30,3.0,"A cute place just opened in Uptown on the corner of Broadway and Lawrence.  I've been waiting with excitement since I've never had Ethiopian food.  They didn't disappoint me.   The place is actually pretty big. The tables are well space out and everything has that nice new feel, without looking sterile.  It's very welcoming.  There's a long wooden bar on one side of the restaurant.  We sat near the bar and decided to try a few of their wines.   All the servers looked African and had cool accents.  Our server in particular was very nice.  She talked to us a little bit since it was our first time.  It was then I learned there is no silverware.  We were about to eat with our hands.  How unique. My BF had the sweet honey wine; we were told it was an Ethiopian specialty.  It was sweet alright.  VERY sweet.  LOL.  But it was good.  I couldn't drink more than a glass though.  If you've had Muscat wine it's like that only sweeter.  I had the Pinot Noir and it was wonderful; really light and fruity actually, but not as sweet. We decided on one chicken dish and one lamb dish.   They came out together on this big round silver platter.  The platter was lined with the biggest crepe I've ever seen.  It's not actually a crepe; it's the Ethiopian style of bread.  But it has the consistency of a thick crepe, only cold and with more little air holes in it.  The bread also had a distinct sour taste to it.  Like sourdough bread.  They also gave us two additional breads that were rolled up like huge napkins.  Our server instructed us to use the bread to pick up the food and enjoy. The meal came with two side dishes.  One was a mash of sorts with potato and carrot.  It was tasty, slightly sweet...not hot, but not cold either.  The other side was mashed lentils.  The lentils were spicy ( I thought) but the BF said they were mild. Our dishes both came in bowls and looked like stew.  I was wondering how on earth we'd be able to pick up the food with the bread when it was so liquid.   Also there was a layer of oily something on the top of the food.  I'm not sure it it's like Indian food and was clarified butter or if it was really oil.  But it was tasty...just really messy.  Despite my best efforts it was running down my hands.  I noticed too, when I went to the bathroom to wash up that it left a slight stain on my nails, but I've had that happen with curry before too. My lamb came in small hunks that were still on little pieces of bone.   This made it a little easier for me to pick them out.  But they were really little and while the meat had a wonderful flavor it wasn't as tender as I thought it would be - given that it looked like it had been stewed.  Also the cuts of meat were pretty fatty.  So I had to really work to get to the good stuff and there wasn't a whole lot of it.  But there was a ton of the stew and lots of the bread and I certainly could have stuffed myself silly with that. My BF had chicken drumsticks in a similar sauce as mine, which I can't adequately describe - other than yummy and tasty.  But his also had lemon and hard boiled eggs. The chicken meat was really tender and juicy.  Again since it was on the bone it was easier to handle.   The bill was around $35 which I thought was super cheap considering we had two glasses of wine.  As we were wrapping up to leave the owner came up to us and asked us about the meal.  He was very kind and genuinely interested in our feedback.  We were definitely made to feel welcome.  Now I want to go try other Ethiopian places to see if there is a difference.  So I'm glad this cool ethnic place opened right near my house.  It gave me an opportunity to try something different without going far from home.",0.9988,0.811,0.171,0.017,0.5583463535187674
