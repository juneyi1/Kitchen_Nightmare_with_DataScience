It's a great spot to come with a large group of friends. Be sure to bring the right mates though, aka the fun ones. After reading the previous reviews, I was scared that we were gonna get constantly harassed but it wasn't like that at all. The owner did come by a few times to make us chug some booze however, he was never inappropriate with our table. If anything, he made our experience even better! It is BYOB so we brought bottles of wine, beers, whiskey, etc. Let's just say there was enough to drink for everyone (even some for the table next to us). The place is small, so everyone in the restaurant gets pretty friendly after a few drinks. The food is served family style, they bring out dishes like fried rice, orange chicken, string beans, and peppered beef. It was decent (just think your average Chinese American joint), the crab ragoons were probably my favorite. But again, you shouldn't be coming here for the food. Towards the end of the night, they turn on the karaoke so be sure to stay for that! Reservations are necessary for the weekends. The later the reservation, the rowdier it will be. It starts to pick up at around 9 p.m. so be aware of that. No one likes being the sober one showing up to a party. For about $40 a person, it's a well-worth it experience.

The restaurant itself seems to be entirely devoted to partying. The tables are all set up to accommodate large parties.

Our table sat facing this light, so I spent much of the dinner with lasers in my eyes.  You cannot order off of the menu, everything is served family style and you basically just take what they bring you.  Let's just get this out there - the food is not good. Terrible substandard ingredients, even by Chinese takeout standards.  As many of the other reviewers indicate, Jimmy is the drunken owner of this establishment who seems to spend the majority of the time partying with customers. Prior yelp reviews warned me of his probable antics, and he did not disappoint on our visit. He actually slapped a member of our party, and aggressively forced another member to drink straight alcohol by putting the bottle in his mouth and tipping it over. Saw Jimmy deliver several carrot penises to tables throughout the night.  With tip the cost of this experience is about $40 a person.

Another hour later (this is now 2.5 hours after ordering) I had to call 5 times for them to answer the phone and he told me that the delivery man had called me 20 minutes ago and that I didn't answer. The delivery man either did not call me or had the wrong number because I have been sitting by my phone for 2.5 hours waiting for a call. I told him that I did not get a call and that I would like my money back. He said he would refund it. Hopefully he does return it or I will be calling the BBB.

There's a lot of shrimp in it and otherwise it's exactly as you'd expect.

Spice/heat level was perfect. The orange chicken was fresh but it came with the sauce in a small cup on the side and it wasn't nearly enough to coat all the chicken. Wouldn't order this again, but not b/c it wasn't good, we just want to try other things.  The delivery guy was hilarious. He used my first name, and noted the special care they took to be sure to prepare the dishes without onions or scallions because of an onion allergy we had mentioned. This has NEVER happened before.

Everyone might think it's cool the owner takes shots with them until he spills spicy garlic chicken juice all over your hair, chair, and white blouse because he couldn't hold the platter steady when placing it on the table (which happened to my friend while I was here). After doing so, he didn't offer anything to compensate; he only padded her excessively with a wet rag even though she insisted on doing it herself.  Also, music is like you're in a club. Have to shout just to have a dinner conversation.  Another complaint-$30 per person is their standard rate on the weekend and you can't chose to order individual plates? Ridiculous. They bring out a bunch of platters (which they spill) and each person takes a plate of stuff and is stuffed. Way over priced and not worth $30.

2013-11-16,2.0,"For the sake of their Yelp reviews, I'm glad Lan's doesn't consider itself a karaoke bar, because although they offer it on Friday and Saturday nights, it's not very good. They only have one mic, which was definitely on its last life (cutting in and out, exposed wire), only a few books with a fairly limited song selection, and the system for choosing a song is going up and telling the guy what song you want to do. When he's MIA, that's pretty difficult to do. Luckily, Lan's does not consider itself a karaoke bar, and thus, it will get more than one star...but not by much. The food was pretty good, but definitely not the greatest I've ever had. The egg rolls and crab rangoon were definitely bland, but the basil chicken, garlic shrimp and some beef dish (had green beans with it) made up for it. The problem was the service was pretty bad, and the interior design of the place left a lot to be desired -- gave off a ""dive bar"" feeling.

I use Yelp all the time to find good places to eat and always read the reviews.. I just don't write them.  Yesterday, on Valentines Day, my girlfriend had just gotten off a 12 hour shift so I thought it would be nice to eat in and order Chinese food. Being in the Gold Coast there aren't a whole lot of good places that deliver so I went with Lans.  I ordered the Mushu Port and Sweet and Sour Chicken - and an hour and a half later it arrived.. however it was missing the sweet and sour sauce as well as any sort of rice in any way shape or form. I called back as soon as the delivery driver left and said I was missing half my order. The person I dealt with from that point forward (i assume the owner) was the most arrogant and unbelievably rude person I have ever dealt with. After his snarky comments the first time I called he said he would have the driver bring the rest of my order. 45 minutes later - I called again to see what the progress was. He got upset, told me to relax and he said that the driver still hadn't been back to the restaurant so at this point hadnt even picked up the rest of our order. Still, I remained calm, said that now the rest of my food was getting cold and that I'd like him to rush the remaining order to me so I could eat my food. (REMINDER - this is VALENTINES DAY) Another 30 minutes passes and I call again. He told me to stop calling and said the food would be delivered when it was delivered. then hung up with a snarky ""Enjoy"".  Another 30 minutes. I called back and no answer. Called again, no answer. I proceeded to call 15 more times within the course of 30 minutes, no answer. He was clearly avoiding my call.  Then I had my girlfriend try from her number. First ring he picks up. She decides to tell him we want a full refund for our order price as our meal and night was ruined. He started laughing and hung up the phone. She tried calling back 10+ more times - no answer.

2012-05-27,4.0,"A conversation I had with the server makes perfect sense for this review.  This is a restaurant in transition (not in a negative way).  They are remodeling and from what I was told, trying to cater to their bulk of business which is the Karaoke Late Night crowd.   I walked into this restaurant at about 5:40 pm on Saturday, May 26th, 2012.  It was recommended to me from the owner of the place I was staying at.  The place is unassuming, tucked away about a block in from North Ave.  As I walked in, the place was completely empty.  I thought the restaurant was closed and that I had walked in while they were preparing for the dinner crowd as workers were on the counter folding napkins.  I was assured they were open and they gave me the ""Ocean View"" (sat next to the fish tank).  The music was soft enough that it gave it a decent mood and they had Forrest Gump on a large TV playing which kept grabbing my attention.  The restaurant definitely has a family feel to it as there are martial arts trophies above the fish tank.  Chinese decor throughout the restaurant lets you know that this is really a Chinese family running this restaurant. I was handed a menu and started looking it over trying to decide what I wanted to eat.  As I kept reviewing the menu I noticed they had a few ""Lans"" specialties that kept catching my eye.  The first thing I asked my server was the portion size of the meals as I wanted to try a few different items on the menu.  The server told me that one entree could definitely fill you up as it also comes with my choice of rice.  I was recommended the Sizzling Soup so I asked about it.  The server told me it is meant for two people so it would probably fill me up so I decided not to order it.  I always start off with egg rolls when I go to Chinese restaurants and this time was no exception.  The order listed is for 2 egg rolls and I asked if I could have one chicken egg roll and one vegetable egg roll since they cost the same.  The server obliged and took my order.  Next I ordered the Lan's Szechuan Beef (white rice side) and the Chicken Fried Rice.  The server asked me how hot I wanted the beef and he joked ""do you want it Asian hot or..."" I told him to make it Mexican Hot!  He smiled and took the order.  Soon after I received the order of egg rolls, which were nice and toasted on the outside which I don't normally like but really enjoyed the crunch this time.  The chicken egg roll was sliced diagonally in two pieces and the vegetable egg roll was lying next to it with some nice carrot art on the plate.  The chicken egg roll was decent but the veggie egg roll was better.  It might have been the fact that the veggie roll was fuller than the chicken one but it just seemed to taste better and provide more happiness to my taste buds. Soon after the main entrees arrived at my table and I could smell the spice from the Szechuan Beef.  The Chicken Fried Rice was full of large real chicken which made it really appetizing.  I first dug into the Beef and white rice.  As I served myself I came across the only negative comment I have for this place.  The Beef is about a third of ""greens.""  I understand it gives it flavor and is part of the dish but it shouldn't account for 1/3 of the plate in my humble opinion.  That being said the Beef was delicious.  They got the heat just right for me with this entrée as it was just enough for my mouth to scream bloody murder but not too much where my taste buds went numb.  Good taste minus the portion of actual beef.  I dove into the Chicken Fried Rice and was not disappointed.  The rice had a light juicy, sticky taste to it that made the eggs and large pieces of chicken satisfy as well as cool down my taste buds from the spice of the beef.  Obviously I planned it this way as I knew I was in for some heat with the beef.   The cost of my dinner was $30 including a good tip.  That is expensive for just one person but I ordered two entrees, egg rolls and a soda.  If you subtract one entrée which is what a normal person would do, it comes down to about $20 for one person.  The price is still a little expensive for one person but this isn't a fast food Chinese food chain you are ordering from.  They do deliver and I constantly saw the delivery guy coming and going so that seems to bring in some good business and gave me re-assurances that I wasn't the only person who was eating from this restaurant on a Saturday night. Bottom line, both Chicken and Veggie Egg Rolls were good, the Lan's Szechuan Beef was good, the Chicken Fried Rice was delicious and I will be ordering this entrée again.  The price isn't bad if you keep in mind this isn't a Fast Food Chinese chain.  You get what you pay for just like everything else in life and this was worth it.",0.9929,0.864,0.094,0.043,0.5067787596138114

I had to call back to confirm they were going to deliver.  The person on the phone then decided to change our order to take-out.   3)  Most importantly, the food was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  The orange chicken was simply chicken drowned in orange juice.  The garlic chicken (ordered medium/hot) did not have ANY spice.   4) It is way overpriced.  We ordered the orange chicken, garlic chicken, and shrimp dumplings.  It was $40.

I ordered the General Lan's Chicken to-go and picked it up at the restaurant (obviously not paying for them to deliver it ten yards).  Instead of a nice, delicious stir fry meal, it was completely parted out.  My bag had a container of rice, a plastic thing of deep fried chicken, and a bucket of sauce/veggies.  The sauce was very watery and there was no convenient way to get the flavor into the chicken.  I ended up dipping each bite in the sauce and getting a dry chicken flavor on the inside.  The veggies had been soaking in the sauce for who-knows how long and were not even remotely appetizing.  They ended up in the garbage. The only saving grace was the chicken egg rolls I ordered with the meal.  Two decently sized egg rolls with a tasty dipping sauce for $4...I should've called it at that.

Moving on to entreés: we ordered the manchurian beef, fried chicken with garlic, and chicken fried rice. Everything was decent, but overall they could have jacked up the flavor more. The manchurian beef was described as being cooked with ginger and garlic so I expected it to tantalize my taste buds and it didn't, but the chicken fried rice was delicious. And the fried chicken with garlic? Put those two things together and you have a winner in my book. We didn't really know what to expect with this dish based on its description, but it ended up being small pieces of boneless chicken in a light garlic sauce. Again, they could have used more garlic, but that could just be me since I love garlic.

2011-01-22,1.0,"A friend of mine and I have a monthly BYOB club. For the month of January we decided to try Lan's Old Town. What a mistake. The food was fine, it wasn't anything special. We actually did a fixed price menu where I worked with Jim, the owner to come up with a menu so we wouldn't have to do ordering that night. I actually have found that with a large group (20 people) it's easier to do this, so I don't mind when when places ask us to do this. When I planned ahead with Jim he told me to go on their on line menu and decide the menu items we would want. I did this and called him back and the total came out to about $17.00 (without tax and tip) a person. He agreed to this price and we both said ""OK see you this Friday"" This seemed very fair considering entrees run about $9-$12 dollars.  When we arrive there is a table set up for 12 people and most of the seats are already filled. I ask Jim what the plan is to get the rest of the guests seated (It was already to minutes past out reservation time). He tells me that a table is just leaving. Well, that only seats 4 people so we are still short another 4 seats. I bring that up to him and he snaps at me and tells me that he's moving that table as soon as soon as they get up. So here I am with 8 people standing around waiting as the rest of the guests just stare at us wondering how they can help. Well, finally another girl went to go tell them that there still weren't going to be enough seats and somehow she gets them to understand that 12+ 4 does not equal 20 so they finally pull another table. When all is said and done we finally all get seated at 7:55, 25 minutes after our reservation. I just don't have the patience for this. If you can't fit us all at a certain time then don't take my reservation. It would have been one thing if we hadn't made the reservation a while ago. Also, don't snap at me when I tell you that we still don't have enough chairs to seat everyone. RUDE  So after the mess with getting the group seated everything is just slow. We have to ask for plates and serving ware for many of our guests and wine glasses also. We had two servers that I think do EVERYTHING in the place. Jim and then a younger guy. The food started coming and it was fine. Although one frustrating thing is that Jim hadn't shared the menu and the fact that we had a fixed price menu with the other server so he had no idea. It made for a lot of confusion. If I was giving just the food a rating I would give it a 3. I liked everything we had: Grab Rangoon, dumplings, mu shoo chicken, been with broccoli, Lan's pork (although we could barely tell there was pork in it), chicken fried rice, and then some shrimp thing. He never brought us out white rice with any of our dishes which was weird. Our server was no where to be found so I couldn't ask him for some.  So here's the final issue of the night that just sent me over and is the reason I will NEVER go back. We get the final bill and there is a charge for $54 on it. It's not labeled and it's before the tax line. A few of us look at it and our waiter is no where to be found, so we assume they have added on the tip. I'm fine with that. So we divvy up the bill, collect the cash and hand it off to Jim. When he comes back with a cc statement for someone to sign he says ""you're going to leave tip on top of that, right now that's only a 9 dollar tip"". I say ""I thought you added it into the bill, what's the $54 dollar charge"". He tells me that is the glass fee for everyone at our table. I was so pissed. No where on line on his site or on the menu does it have a glass charge AND he never mentioned a $3 glass charge during the three times we spoke on the phone. I had to go ask everyone else for another $4-$5 for a tip that honestly Jim didn't deserve. I did a short search on people's review and I couldn't find anyone talking about this charge. Who knows, somehow it appeared out of thin air. At the end of the say everyone paid $27 for dinner which was WAY to much.  Jim, you are a bad business man and have awful service.

Unfortunately, all of them were closed for Christmas (oy vey!) or we were out of their delivery range.  And so I turned to Yelp for help...and discovered Lan's. An hr later we had won ton soup, kung pao chicken and sweet and sour chicken (we were in a chicken kinda mood) at our door.  The won ton soup was good, but the rest of the meal failed to impress. It was very greasy and didn't taste very good. We helped ourselves to a bit and threw out the rest. We're very big into leftovers these days, but opted for a frozen meal the next night over Lan's leftovers. It was a Merry Christmas, but would have been even merrier with good Chinese food. Perhaps next year!",0.9898,0.759,0.206,0.035,0.3784

2010-09-18,5.0,"First, let me list a few of the interesting things that happened while I was at Lans: - Owner (?) poured some incredibly strong Chinese booze on the bar and lit it on fire---twice - Same owner explained how he tried to smuggle a tiger bone into the country - Patron brought a 24 pack of Heineken in and passed a can out to everyone in the restaurant. Ok, now that I have your attention, let's get into my review. A friend and I were completely stumped about where to eat. We didn't set out for Chinese food, but after stumbling upon Lan's on Yelp, the reviews made it seem interesting enough to try out. We were being lazy and decided to drive even though we assumed that parking would be hard---it was. We eventually found a metered spot though and walked into Lan's. Walking into this place, I was immediately interested. Let's break it down: first, the restaurant has huge, red gimmicky doors. Directly behind the door is the host stand sporting a giant pig statue and on on the floor is a giant floor mat with dogs on it. Looking around, I quickly noticed a big fish tank on the left in front of a bar extending the length of the place and floor to ceiling mirrors on the right wall. The decor is a weird mix of tacky 80's and faux Chinese. Anyways, the most important part of this entrance is that when we got there, a man who I assume was the owner (who I later learned was named Jimmy) was standing behind the bar with a flaming puddle of Chinese liquor in front of him with the only 2 patrons in the place sitting there taking pictures. Uh, what? Jimmy looked over and said, ""sit where ever you want. The place is yours."" Ya, I think we'll be taking the bar. Jimmy stayed and talked with the 2 men there who seemed to be regulars while his son (?) came over and gave us some menus. We looked it over and ordered some crab rangoon, Cokes, pork moo shu for my friend and Szechuan beef for me. (When I asked the son how hot the Szechuan beef was he said ""you know, white people spicy"".) While we waited, we talked, watched some Chinese tv on a humorously small tv on a stand behind the bar and eavesdropped on the conversation the between Jimmy and the men next to us. Pretty funny stuff. That's when Jimmy explained how he tried to smuggle a tiger bone through customs and that he's Irish and Jewish (if his name threw you off, Jimmy is very, very Chinese.) Eventually the appetizer came and Jimmy came over to show us the best way to mix the sauces together. The crab rangoon was good, but not great. Eventually our entrees came out and we chowed down. We both enjoyed our respective dishes a lot. Midway through, Jimmy popped over to talk with us a bit, introduced himself and asked our names. We asked about all of the martial arts trophies in front of us and he explained that they were his sons'. He also explained that he used to have a big flat screen behind the bar, but someone stole it so that's why we were treated to the glorious 15""er. Speaking of the bar, it isn't really a ""bar"" per se. This place is BYOB. We didn't know that before we came, so we were bummed out we didn't bring anything. Jimmy said he'd like to get a liquor license sometime in the future. Seems to me like it'd be a good idea, but on the other hand it might take away some of the charm of this place. As we ate, more and more people filtered in, including a couple of cops who were regulars. Jimmy kept trying to give them free shots of that booze, but they declined. Eventually, the original group of two guys that were there when we first walked in grew to 4 and they brought a 24 case of Heineken. After realizing that they had far too much beer for just themselves, they offered everyone in the place a can. Most accepted. Situations like these would be gone if Lan's sold alcohol. Through all this we kept eating. Jimmy gave me more free rice and reheated my friend's pancake without us even asking. He came over one more time to show that he remembered our names. We eventually got the bill, only to realize that we weren't charged for the Cokes or the appetizer. Split in half, I paid $12. I've never left a place so full. Wow, I wrote way too much. But I think that speaks volumes about this place. It is an experience. The food wasn't amazing, but it was good. Everything else, however, was amazing---fun and interesting. We'll definitely be back... if only to see if Jimmy remembers our names.",0.9985,0.845,0.134,0.022,0.45579365079365086

Loved all 3 dishes - you have the choice of spice (we went with hot). Mongolian beef was my favorite of the entrees. The shrimp fried rice was not that good - actually unspectacular. This was kind of a disappointment b/c thats usually a go-to-dish. Very fun time and will definitely return. Side note: The owner, Jimmy came out and asked if our dish was spicy enough - it was but Jimmy had something hotter for us. He brought out 2 tiny peppers, one red, the other green.

First of all, this place is byob, which is a nice escape from the usual over priced bottles of wine/ drinks.  We usually arrive around 8:30 or 9 for a later dinner, and sometimes with another couple ( trust me, makes things more interesting!) One of the family members usually waits on you and takes your initial order.  By the time you have finished your meal, then owner Jimmy is also winding down to close up shop. This is when the fun begins.  Almost every time we've been there, he pulls up a chair at our table with a case of budweiser or some Jack Daniels and tells us whirlwind, laugh out loud stories. Jimmy is very proud of his cuisine, and it shows. The dumplings and pot stickers are fabulous, and the dumplings sauce is even better...it goes with everything.  Hubby likes the crispy duck and Mongolian beef.  I like the chicken wih asparagus and pea pods. PS- top 3 best chicken fried rice I have ever had! Not too greasy and not too dry...just perfect. We live close by so delivery is always fast.  The service has always been friendy from everyone there, especially Jimmy.  The place is somewhat small, good for groups of 2-4, otherwise if more, you may have to wait for a while. I am just so thrilled that we moved to the area and stumbled upon this place.

That vacuum is the absence of a really good (and not wildly expensive) Chinese restaurant. Well, that vacuum sound is now gone and my search to find that Chinese restaurant led me (with Help from Yelp) to Lan's.  About Last Night (a Monday). Arrived at nine o'clock . Place was empty. Normally that's a 'red flag', but based on Yelp reviews I know food is very good. So we stay (ended staying until after midnight). The owner (Jimmy) personally greets us and becomes our instant best friend. The guy at the table next to us (John, a wine distributor) apparently is friends with Jimmy and soon becomes our friend, too.  My wife and I brought a bottle of wine (yes this is a BYOB place with no corkage fee). By 10 we had finished the wine and we start on Saki shots (or is it 'bombs'?). I lost track of how many after about seven or eight. My poor wife.... all she wanted was a quiet dinner and we end up laughing and telling hilarious jokes for three hours.  Oh, by the way, the food was very good (that's a must if we are to go back).  Food is four to five stars, but Jimmy's graciousness easily bumps it (and the experience) to five stars.  Yes, Jimmy is a splendid host, but that gets old quickly if the food sucks. We ordered the fish special, a halibut with snow peas and baby asparagus. Very fresh and when the taste of it hits you, it's ""Oh yum!"".

My friends and I came here on my birthday and Lan himself served us. What a warm, personal and funny guy. For food I recommend (in order): - The duck - crispy, juicy and served with a Chinese mustard, soy sauce (I think that's what it was). - Shredded pork and green beans. - Manchurian Beef - Shrimp Toast - appetizer - Garlic Chicken  The other items - noodles dishes, rangoons, potstickers and egg rolls were pretty standard. It was hilarious - at the end of the meal, Lan came out and quietly crouched beside me and asked whispering ""Whose birthday is it?"" I broke out laughing informing him that it was mine. He started to laugh as well. He brought out the cake singing Happy Birthday. At the end of the night, Lan took pictured with and of us - remind me to post them.

2009-11-04,3.0,"I have been passing by this spot when it transformed itself from overpriced empty sushi place, to deserted Korean and now finally to a seemingly successful Chinese. Tonight I placed a takeout order and they recommended sauteed scallops with black mushrooms, bamboo shoots and cucumber. That last part sounded weird, but I went with it. I also inquired whether they had brown rice instead of white, and was assured that they did. Once I picked the food up, the price morphed from 13.95 to 18.73! Now, we know that the taxes in Chicago are high, but what they did  was to charge me extra $3 for brown rice instead of complimentary white without mentioning it. Their menu lists  ""Seamed (Sic) Brown Rice"" for that price and that's what I was given. The food portion was fairly large and the food tasted OK, but nothing special. For me it actually tasted a little tastless - I am used to a citrus flavor of scallop curry from Big Bowl, so Lan's was distant second to me, not to mention that their price ended up being higher too.",0.8874,0.888,0.081,0.03,0.3876190476190476

2009-10-23,4.0,"Lan's has decent Chinese food and very warm service. In another city I'd give them 3 stars but as Chicago is so lacking on the Chinese food front (even the super Americanized version), I have to bump them up.  I went on a Friday night with a gaggle of 8 gals and we were treated very well by the father and son proprietors, shared multiple appetizers and entrees, brought our own wine and sake so for $20 our Friday night started on a great note. (Papa Lan kicked back a glass of sake with us in fact :^). The Mooshoo chicken was probably the favorite of the night. The Garlic Shrimp was recommended and though it did have nice meaty shrimp and a tasty sauce I was dismayed that the shrimp were deepfried in a breaded coating (totally unecessary)...but  perhaps that's what people want.  Garic eggplant was wonderful (take heed that we ordered it ""medium"", which most thought was pretty hot...would go mild next time.) Health nuts like me can appreciate the (Japanese?) seaweed salad, tofu/veggie soup and brown rice option. I would recommend going with 5 or fewer people if dining in because Lan's really isn't geared toward groups and the large table we were at required awkward foot/leg placement.

The decor inside is striking and pretty, though not overly fancy.  Service was phenomenal- one of my table mates struck up a quick friendship with Jimmy, who I think is the proprietor, and he was happy to keep our glasses and tummies filled all night long.  There were no long waits for food or for a table, even on a spontaneous Friday evening out. Now, I am no expert on Chinese food; in fact, I don't even usually like it.  Is this the exception that proves the rule?  As mentioned in other reviews, the fresh vegetables used at Lan's really make the meal.  The vegetable broth tofu soup is a big, healthy serving that we split among three people as an appetizer.  Other non-vegetarians enjoyed the crab rangoon and the potstickers.  For a large, family-style meal, we ordered five or six meals and spun them around the lazy susan.  My veggie order was the garlic eggplant, and holy cow was it good- voted the best choice of all by several meat-eaters as well as myself.  Other crowd pleasers included two chicken dishes, the crispy duck, and ""hot-hot-hot-hot"" kitchen-customized kung pao chicken for some of my adventurous companions.",0.9893,0.765,0.187,0.048,0.5707633053221288

Lan's is BYOB so don't forget to bring some wine/beer/cocktails.  The waitstaff encouraged us to bring in a keg if that is what we desired.  Lan's has a delivery arrangement with a liquor store down the street in case you forget about the BYOB policy. 4/5 stars: Recommended",0.9928,0.785,0.194,0.021,0.48236714975845413
