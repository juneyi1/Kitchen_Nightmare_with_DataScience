2006-08-04,3.0,"Fat Moe's is your typical hole in the wall grease burger joint.  Service wasn't outstanding, and they do not appear to accept credit card.  The Italian beef and Polish Sausage sandwiches my comrades got were reported as being pretty good.  I thought the Chicago Style hot dogs were above par, though they could have used lettuce and tomato.  Prices were pretty much what you would expect.  While I'm not going out of my way to come back here, I'm not going to avoid it either. The Fat Moe's I reviewed was in Edgewater on the North Side.  I have no idea why the address is now on the west side.  Maybe they moved, or maybe someone's a joker.",0.7707,0.821,0.12,0.059,0.5125000000000001
