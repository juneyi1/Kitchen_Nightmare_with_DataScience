Sadly, he was not there the night we were there. As part of the menu for the dinner, we tried: starters (coconut shrimp, calamari), filet mignon, salmon, creme brulee, and key lime pie!

2017-08-25,2.0,"Having dined here in previous years decided to return on a recent business trip to Chicago. Unfortunately Ditka's has been left behind in the quality dining stakes and is a shade of its former glory. Table selection was fine, menus given but no wine list.  Wine selection had to be explained and when it came the red wine was cold. Starters were vastly overpriced, steaks ordered were wrongly cooked and not served with proper accomplishment. Steaks taken back and new ones delivered, which were just ok, far better quality steaks to be had in Chicago and for the price paid, try Gibson's. Ordered a macchiato and got a latte. When the final bill came not even a side order given as gratis for the mistakes made. A simple small gesture that would have warranted one more star maximum. Mike Ditka was a winner in the NFL, a distinguished career with many awards, unfortunately he isn't winning anything in the restaurant game and should hang up his shoulder pads sooner rather than later.",0.742,0.811,0.111,0.077,0.47913419913419913

I'm a Connecticut yankee and love my pot roast, but didn't believe the menu when it said pot roast nachos. There was, in fact, pot roast on a filling but perfectly apportioned plate. The nachos stayed crisp despite a perfect amount of toppings, and the roast made them the best nachos I have ever had.  My wife had sliders for an entree, and really enjoyed them. I had their lowest grade wet-aged paddle steak, which was recommended by the server because I like my meat well done. This was accompanied by mushrooms and some whipped potatoes.  My meal was so good that I would have French-kissed Ditka if he walked in the door, porn-stash and all, and I'm really committed to women (read wife here).  I am finicky about beer, and I also really enjoyed Ditka's own ale.

2017-06-08,5.0,"A few of my good friends and I decided to take an impromptu day trip to Chicago about a week ago, and one of them insisted we eat at Ditka's. I was a bit skeptical; you don't typically associate a restaurant with a sports-related name with high quality food, but boy is that stereotype not true here. I was incredibly impressed with Ditka's, and I really want to come back. From the moment you step in, you can tell you're in a premium experience. I would recommend dressing at least a little classy. I was fine in a polo and khaki shorts, but I wouldn't suggest rolling in with sweatpants and a t-shirt. The interior is beautiful, with stunning wood themes. We were escorted to our table by the extremely helpful and kind staff.  Our waiter was great, and he joked around with us and made sure we had a great experience. We weren't here for a full steak meal, but I would LOVE to come back and try the steaks. I'd also love to try ""da pork chop"", another apparent favorite here. It sounded/looked amazing. We ordered a few dishes to share. We ordered the wings, the meatloaf, au grautin potatoes, and the pork nachos. Oh man, let's talk about that meatloaf. The meatloaf is deceptively huge in person. For $20, I was expecting a good sized portion, but this thing is massive. We couldn't eat the entire thing. It's arranged in such a cool manner; the bottom layer is a jalapeno cornbread, topped with the meatloaf, and then mashed potatoes. On top lies a bed of onion straws. It was delicious! Cornbread is my weakness, and when I read that it was included, I knew I would love this dish. The meatloaf was tender and seasoned well. The other dishes were great as well, but I mostly stuck to the meatloaf; it was that good. I also had the Pomegranate Rum Punch. This was certainly one of the more interesting drinks I've had. It looked stunning. It isn't something I'd be likely to order again, but that's simply because I discovered I wasn't a huge fan of the pomegranate and alcohol flavors mixed together; not the restaurant's fault. I'd love to try some of their other drinks. Overall, this is somewhere I am so happy I tried. I will definitely return next time I'm in Chicago.",0.9992,0.652,0.306,0.041,0.592543934240363

2017-05-24,5.0,"Came here with my boyfriend to have a nice, tasty dinner. Both of us have been to Ditka's before, so we knew that coming in to eat here would be a great experience.  At first we were seated up upstairs right behind the host stand. This was not a problem for us at all, but we thought that the downstairs looked more relaxing. I asked the hostess if it was possible to move to a table downstairs, and she was very generous and let us. The hosts downstair were just as kind and professional and seated us right away. The table we were sat at was perfect.  To begin, our server, Sam, was amazing. He was funny and knowledgable, and his calm and relaxed behavior made the experience much more enjoyable. We wanted to take our time with our meal and enjoy everything, and he picked up on that immediately and accommodated to it wonderfully.  We started the meal out with the small portion of  Coach's Pork Nachos, which is something we have had before and knew it was a must to order. As always, the pork on the nachos tasted amazing and was so tender.  We then ordered a salad and soup. My boyfriend got the Crab Bisque soup, which he thought was tasty. I ordered Mikes Salad, which is so delicious I always wish I had more of it daily.  Then, we ordered our main dishes. I ordered the Manchego Chicken, and my boyfriend ordered the BBQ Ribs. We also split the loaded baked potato. The Manchego Chicken was delicious. The creamy sauce with the gnocchi, arugula, mushrooms bits, and bacon mixed so well together. The Chicken was crispy and tasted great. The loaded baked potato we ordered on the side is one of the best potatoes I have eaten, and also probably the biggest. My boyfriends BBQ Ribs were so tender looking they came right off the bone. His French fries were fresh and crispy. He also ordered a classic mojito, which he loved. He likes that it doesn't taste weak and that it tastes refreshing. The glass it comes in makes it look all the better. We both enjoyed our meals greatly.  For dessert, we ordered the carrot cake. It's huge!! It came with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a mint leaf on top, and a bit of caramel sauce on the side to dip cake pieces in. The cake itself is moist and the cream cheese icing is everything anyone would dream of. We ended up taking home leftovers of the cake and our dinners, which made a pretty great meal the next day.  The service overall was exemplary. Water was always filled, even when slightly low. I never once got to finish my water, which I thought was amazing for them to keep up on, along with all of the other tables. Plates were taken out of the way nearly right away when empty. Crumbs were removed from the table before the main dishes. When you get up to go to the bathroom or anywhere else, your napkin is refolded and placed on the table.

2017-05-22,3.0,"This place is ok. The service was very good, but there were some parts of my meal I didn't enjoy. I started with the buffalo wings. They tasted frozen and the sauce didn't have a ton of flavor. I also got the mike's salad which had a ""balsamic vinaigrette"". I put that in quotations because it didn't taste like balsamic. It tasted more of a italian dressing. Some of the mixed greens I didn't like, but the other ingredients in it tasted good. For my main, I got the double cut pork chop with redskin mashed potatoes. The pork chop was very flavorful and tender. The apples that came with it added a great sweetness that went well with the pork. But the best thing were the mashed potatoes. Great texture and well seasoned. I ended with the cherry cobbler which was very good and not too sweet. Ditka's is alright, but be careful with the appetizers and salad.

However, go upstairs and you get the sports bar feel with TV with the fancy food. Today, I chose the sports bar feel.  I was told to go upstairs to check it. They sat me at a high top which was your typical high top. It was against the railing for the stairs which also had a ledge to hold your jacket and for your date to hold her purse. It was close to other tables but never felt cramped.  I ordered the Oyster shooters. It tasted fresh with a strong dose of Tabasco. The Tuna Poke ""Nachos"" was also delicious and refreshing. The Sriracha Aioli and Wasabi cream had a nice balance. My date who is anti spicy foods even said it didn't make her mouth burn. The Crab cake was amazing. I make a well known Crab cake considering I was a fine dining chef for many years but I think we both agreed that this place had me beat. It was probably much more un-healthier but still very very delicious.  Now to the only bad part of the food. The Lobster Mac n Cheese. They used Rotini pasta (if I recall correctly) and those ridges would be nice if it had a nice thick sauce. Sadly, the sauce was very thin. It was lacking in flavor and body as well. The lobster tasted dry and old and rubbery.  The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. Everyone had a nice big smile which is rare these days. How often do you visit a place where wait staff actually enjoyed their job? Rarely... I know but it happened here.  Overall, I did enjoy this place and I must return back to eat their steaks.

The sweet potatoes were really ""sweetened"" sweet potatoes; so cloying with some added sweetener as to completely mis-match with steak or anything else. French Bordeaux was usually poor.  Service by the waiter bordered on uncaring.  Result:  a very poor meal at a very poorly run restaurant.  Avoid if you like good steak and good atmosphere.  Try Lawry's or Ruth Chris or Morton's--real treasures in Chicago for red meat and red wine lovers.",0.9653,0.768,0.162,0.07,0.46430335097001757

First came he sharing, I provided a tong full of friends to everyone at the table. My friend sitting across the table wanted  a dip of ketchup, to which I passed him the tongs, which he used to grasp the fry, reach across the table, and smother that fry in a   ramekin full of that sweet tomato sauce grown from the ground of freedom that is the United States of America. Then came then the taking, I conveniently grabbed a tong full of every side dish at the table. Smashed red skin potatos, lobster mac and cheese, mashed sweet potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and that cream spinach. Even mixed and matched by grabbing a fry and following up with a scoop of mashed potatoes and inserting the combo directly into my mouth full of salivation.  I finished off the meal by grabbing each two way filet with these glorious grub grabbers and finished each fabulous filet in one bite.

The guys were happy, they enjoyed their meals, and it was obvious they were all satisfied! I was pleased with my dish, surrounded by meat, it was nice having a meal perfect for me! The service was great, our waters and wine glasses were always kept full! These guys took care of us, the staff made it a point that we have a good evening and we did! This was my first time here and I am happy with how the night went. Our guests were happy and extra stuffed which made the night even better. Ditka's has a great dinner atmosphere, a menu that has something for everyone, and a staff that goes above and beyond! I definitely recommend checking this place out!

Fortunately we settled on Ditka's and it was a fantastic decision. We didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night but sat at the bar and waited about 45 mins to snag a table.  However, we never even made it to our table because our second floor seats were next to Mike Ditka himself!! So many people stopped by to take photos of him and we felt like VIPs just by sitting there. Add to that an awesome live music experience and we really had a blast here.  For food, we got the oyster shooters (highly recommend, they taste like Bloody Marys), chicken soup (bland and small portioned) and Fried Chicken  plate (very well made, huge portion and satisfying plate all around, highly recommended).  The drinks were also very well made and the bartenders were a hoot to chat with. An all-around fun night in Chicago.  --- Distinguishing factor: Great authentic Chicago experience. Awesome ambiance.

2016-09-05,2.0,"I was not impressed with this restaurant. Seems like an upscale Fridays. It was simply decorated in memorabilia in plain black frames. My husband loved his ribs. They were fall off the bone. I am not a fan of ribs but again looked to me like a Friday's dish for twice the price. The bread was good but thought they should have warned you it had nuts inside. The kale/caesar salad was delicious and I thought is was a good price of $8 and big enough to share and they split it on two plates which is always nice. I ordered chicken piccata and I was very disappointed. It was battered and had so much fat that I called over the waiter and told him I couldn't chew it. He saw the line of fat running down the side and said he would take it into the kitchen and have it cut away. When he came back, they had removed all of the skin and reheated it and poured yellow sauce on top. It looked pathetic. I couldn't cut through it because it was so dry and when he stood there as I tried to cut through it, he said he was sorry and he offered another dish. I am not a steak or meat person and there was not a lot of other things to choose from so I declined and my husband was already finished. They did bring us dessert on the house called grasshopper pie that was mint chocolate chip ice cream in a crust that was unbelievable and huge but I felt like I ate dessert for dinner and being health conscious was disappointed in the whole experience.  I would never go back. We heard they have some wild parties upstairs. The bathroom is upstairs and I actually had to walk through a party and the bathroom was so dirty I actually had to tell a manager so that he could have someone tend to it.

We enjoyed our meal and drinks - good food and shared a dessert to splurge. Got the bill and handed the waitress a brand new freshly opened gift card to pay. She brings the card back and says this is declined. I called the company and they stated the card was declined because a different transaction was ran for the full gift card amount 1 minute prior to the card being ran for the bill amount and there was no way to get the money back at this time as the transactions were pending. I was concerned the waitress made a mistake and we asked to speak with the manager. The manager came over and showed us the credit card log proving the waitress had not incorrectly ran the card. We were upset but nothing we could do so we paid with cash and left. We were told to wait a week to see if the charge would drop off. Checked a week later and our gift card still shows a zero dollar balance. The rep with gift card company said the card was likely put through a card reader at the restaurant prior to the transaction in order to steal the card information. Now we have to file a dispute and wait 1-2 months to receive our money. Long story short-- this waitress stole the money off the card. It was a brand new freshly opened card that had not been used anywhere else. I'm thankful we did not use our personal accounts. Beware if you go to this place.

We've been through all the Chicago steak houses, except for this one, so we were excited to give it a try. Let me cut to the chase. The food and service are terrible. I imagine Ditkas caters to Bears fans, people on expense accounts who don't care, or out of town folks who are used to Outback as their go to steakhouse. The waiter was not present in the moment and did not try to connect with us at all. The guy read through the specials and answered questions about the menu like a bored sixth grade kid aching for summer vacation. On to the food.  I ordered a bone-in ribeye. I asked for it to be pink throughout. It was served grey and well-done. You could tell it was actually a great cut of beef because despite the over cooking because it was still easy to cut and had decent flavor. I wish I asked for a new one because the beef wasn't the problem here. My wife had the prime rib. It had a nice color but was tough and lacked flavor. It was not the melt in your mouth flavor goodness one expects from great prime rib. The sides. If a steak house is going to charge you for sides the sides need to be an experience themselves. We ordered Brussels sprouts and twice baked potatoes. Both were terrible. The twice baked potatoes were flavorless, dried out and cold to the touch, like they were made in an assembly line and set aside until people order them. The Brussels were cold and flavorless. I'm not sure what cooking technique was used to prepare them but they lacked seasoning, flavor and were served cold and mushy. Honestly, eating them raw would have been better than what they did to them. Based on this visit we will never come here again. Mortons, Gibsons, and Harry Caray's are much better choices.",0.9887,0.767,0.157,0.076,0.7099294224294224
2016-02-03,5.0,"I decided to visit on my own for Chicago Restaurant Week. The staff was excellent, they were very friendly and accomodating without sounding like they had rehearsed a bunch of nice things to say; they seemed very sincere. I had my own booth in the lounge area, which I have to say I enjoyed. I knew what I was going to get well before I came in. I started with organic kale caesar salad. Thankfully, it was a blend of romaine and kale. I don't mind kale too much, but it needed the romaine or it would have been overwhelming. There were an awful lot of garlic croutons as well. I'm not a big crouton guy, but these had a strong garlic flavor, so I decided to have a  couple. he Caesar dressing was really flavorful as well. I also got a bread basket with two warm crispy rolls and a ramekin of softened butter. My entree was da pork chop. And let me testify, it lives up to the hype. It's a double cut bone-in chop, with a nice salt and pepper crust. The chop was very juicy and cooked to a perfect medium. Pork chops can be difficult to cook just right, but Ditka's did it very well. The chop was accompanied by diced cinnamon apples, cherry jus, and mashed sweet potatoes. All the flavors complement each other so well. I also got an order of caramelized brussel sprouts. I had to add a little salt and pepper, but they still had a very good flavor. Dessert was banana cream pie, albeit without the chocolate sauce. The caramel was rich, the cream was thick and sweet, and the graham cracker crust was really flavorful firm. The crust was so firm, I thought I'd need a steak knife to cut through it. It would certainly rank in the top 3 or 4 banana cream pies I've ever had.

2016-01-10,4.0,"I have been to Ditkas before but this is a review of my dinner experience on New Year's Eve. I will say that I am a fan of Ditkas due to its casualness and affordability for a steakhouse. And unlike many similar spots, on NYE, they had a fixed menu along with their full menu which was much appreciated. I made reservations about a week prior on Open Table and was seated promptly upon arrival. The crowd was mixed from families to friends in casual gear to people dressed up for New Year's. Our reservation was early (630) since we were headed elsewhere for the ball drop. I believe they had live music later in the night but was not around for any of that.  Service was good as the waitress made no attempt to rush us through the meal. We ordered Mules (which sadly did not come in copper mugs (they were out at the time)) to drink. For an appetizer, we went with the Colossal Shrimp Cocktail which indeed was four colossal shrimps. The cocktail sauce which they were dipped in had a ton of horseradish which I think is a good thing especially when the shrimp were so large that they needed a good amount of sauce. While simple, sometimes the basic apps are always the best. For dinner, I went with the Scallops while my friend went with the Salmon. The scallops were good though maybe a tad undercooked. The scallops were on a yummy crab risotto. The salmon was the better of the two meals especially if you like your salmon medium rare. It was over broccolini and a pineapple quinoa which was really good. We also split the lobster mac and cheese which is really really heavy. Perfect for sharing with a large group but for two of us, it was more than enough.  No dessert as we were headed out for the evening but I would assume that they are pretty good. Then again, I have a sweet tooth.  Overall, Ditka's is a great steakhouse for any occasion. Good food, affordable pricing, and best of all, you do not need to put your name on any wait list months earlier. Go there!",0.9981,0.753,0.218,0.029,0.5225009838646202

2016-01-05,5.0,"This review is late, sorry. A couple years ago, a date and I were in Chicago and went to a very, very high end, well-known restaurant (at my suggestion). It was nasty. Tables too close together, chairs so big, my 6'4"" companion had to sit on the edge or else his legs would have stuck straight out, and food mediocre. I felt the entire time that I was supposed to appreciate how clever (rather than talented) the chef was. The next night, we were walking around, and saw Ditkas. Stopped to look at the menu and I suggested we go in (trying to redeem myself, knowing he would find something to like here.) First, let me say, the layout is perfect. four-tops arranged so that you felt private even though they were still close. We preferred to sit at angles rather than across, as did most of the diners, and there was plenty of room for this. Then there were the oyster shooters. WOW. If you don't eat oysters, this is where you want to try them. I have been trying to replicate them since! Everything we ate was exceptionally good. Everything.  We went back the next night!!! I went again a couple months ago with my daughter, celebrating her graduation and, well, didn't have a reservation so we ate outside and it was windy. Still, we had  A LOT of oyster shooters, still amazing!!!!! And again, all the food was excellent. I LOVE a restaurant that cares more about the diners than about proving how clever they are.

The ambiance is great also. It's full of sports memorabilia wall to wall as you'd (hopefully) expect. As it turns out, there is a Ditka's in Phoenix also, so we're definitely going to try it.

2015-12-10,5.0,"Was here (again) for lunch and as always, a great visit. This place has definitely earned my title of Favorite Chicago Restaurant but might even be My Personal Favorite Restaurant. Each visit, you're greeted with a warm and true welcome by the hostess. Service is always outstanding. Today, I had the privilege of trying the pizza on their lunch menu for $11. It was phenomenal. Thin crust and ever-so-slightly burned on the bottom. Fresh mozzarella cheese and high-grade sausage. It was a mix of Sicilian style pizza with New York. Delicious! Might be a sin to some people to eat thin crust pizza in the heart of downtown Chicago, but trust me it's worth it.... Service was great! Had a waiter (unfortunately forgot his name) who was very prompt and checked on me often. Was very warm and friendly. As soon as you place your knife and fork on your plate when you're done eating, a busboy immediately sweeps in to scoop up the plate to ensure you have a clean table. Have 1/2 a glass of water left? He's ready to refill ASAP. Prices are very good at this place and I suggest the valet parking for $15. Unfortunately I thought it'd be cheaper to park at a lot a block away and spent $27.... I went here for the sole fact of watching the ESPN 1000 radio show taped here live with Da Coach but learned that it requires a ticket for $25 to simply watch the show. Didn't let that bother me since I was able to exchange a few words with John ""Jurko"" Jurkovich upstairs after using the restroom. Great experience, great food....When can I come back??

2015-11-30,5.0,"So other people travel during Thanksgiving to visit family. As foreign borners we take advantage and visit new cities. But as we're here longer and longer we've become slowly indoctrinated in the American way and are starting to enjoy Thanksgiving more and more. So where else to go to celebrate the combo American traditions of football and overindulgence than Mike Ditka's restaurant.  To most Americans he's the player/commentator/coach/Hall of Famer. To us the first time we heard of him was starring opposite Will Ferrell in KICKING AND SCREAMING. And when we heard he had a restaurant close to where we were staying , that was the ultimate. I booked two weeks ahead, with multiple reservations and times available. Traditionally turkey time is celebrated at @ 1-4 pm but as holiday heretics we were happy to go at 6:45.  Under requests on opentable I asked for a booth as the area looked more festive, with multiple TV's; essential as that evening's game was Bears vs Packers.  The called two days before dinner to confirm if I wanted a booth which was great. On walking in, we were greeted by a scrum of humanity. Well heeled patrons of all ages lined up in the hope of getting a seat at the great one's restaurant. At least 20 people, all of whom would be eventually seated. We had to wait 5 minutes above our waiting time but eventually got booth seating with  great views of the bar and TV's. For thanksgiving they had a 4 course meal for $45 including an exceptional crab bisque, a caesar salad, a choice of pies and, of course, unlimited turkey. Yup. For my carnivorous son, as many plates as his 6'2"" skinny frame could take. Served with yams, beans and mash , it was as good a feast as was available in Chicago that night. Others had the crab cakes and two bone in steak which were both pronounced excellent. Had a coupple of glasses of wine; an ok Sangiovese and a surprisingly good Pinot under his own label. Cakes were decent, not grand but not really the point of the meal. What blew us away was, on visiting upstairs, how busy the place was. Every table, every corner, every function room was packed.

We ended up having an amazing dinner and a very memorable night at Ditka's.  For wine-we chose Nickel & Nickel-because it was a Wednesday so why the heck not go big!  For food-we started with the calamari and shrimp cocktail-both of which were fresh and crisp. I loved the marinara and the aioli served with the calamari as well as the horseradish infused cocktail sauce for the shrimp.  To follow, we ended up getting a filet, lobster tail, porterhouse, and Brussels sprouts-all of which were cooked to perfection. The filet was especially juicy and nicely crusted with a peppercorn glaze.  During our dinner, the table next to us asked me for some ibuprofen and I had some on me. To thank me for this gesture, they ended up buying us a bottle of wine for the trouble! So unexpected and so kind! Needles to say-plenty of wine was consumed.  I would recommend Ditka's for anyone looking for a very traditional steakhouse where you can find all the staples you crave. It's a plus if you are into sports as there is a ton of memorabilia displayed throughout the restaurant. I'm only knocking off one star as our server was unreasonably surly.

She got the surf and turf and I got the oysters. All was well, we paid, had a nice time and went on home. Later in the night I had aweful stomach pains to the point where I was taken to the ER and it was food poisoning. It was an awful 24 hours.. The doctor said it was most likely the oysters not being fresh. I call the resturant and tell them about my issue and I was told I would have a manager contact me... Nothing. Not a call or email.. Strike one.  Fast forward to last weekend. It took me 3 years to come back to this place... But we went to the Arlington Heights location.  My wife and I go and get situated and I order an Ice tea... After sucking down the 1st one I notice a little something in the ice... After further examination, it is a dead spider caught in the ice. AFTER I DRANK THE F'N drink...  Let me state that I'm not a man who sends food back, complains about service or anticipates anything ""on the house""...  I tell my waiter ( Who was very kind ) and he was disgusted and embarrassed at what had happened.  I should have just cancelled our order and left but I figured, hey, it happens.  The waiter told us "" I talked to my manager and we are going to see what we can do"".. Cool.   Dinner is done and he brings us a chocolate cake to make up for the spider... I appricate the effort but the table next to us got the same cake ""on the house"" for just showing up..   Strike 2 We get the bill and there was nothing taken care of. I was even charged for the ice f**king tea... How do you have the balls to charge me for an ice tea that had a spider in it?? Strike f**king 3.

They were able to seat four of us immediately in the upstairs bar area, at a high top table. We planned to eat a late dinner elsewhere so we had appetizers and drinks, and this was the perfect place! The drinks were expertly crafted and there's a lovely wine list, the vibe was perfect for our needs, the appetizers were absolutely delicious, and the service was impeccable.  For food we shared the pot roast nachos and the guacamole. The pot roast was delicious and tender, and the other nacho toppings were amply spread across all of the chips, which is a major plus in our book. As for the guacamole...without a doubt the best I've had out anywhere, period. They sprinkle a little cotija cheese and pomegranate over the top, which makes it really zing, but for me it didn't even need those things. It was fresh, perfectly seasoned, great texture, and just so freaking good that I suggest everyone try it!  Shortly after we arrived the entertainment started, in the form of one man singing a variety of well-loved songs, including hits from Louis Armstrong and Sinatra. His voice was amazing and he does a great Louis impression. Surprising and enjoyable. As the evening went on people were loosening up, singing and clapping along, and it was a really fun time. The service really was great. Our water glasses literally never got more than 1/2 empty and we were checked on regularly by our waitress, while not being too much. The steaks being ordered at other tables looked and smelled delicious and I would definitely get a full meal next time.",0.9973,0.732,0.237,0.031,0.5563663967611336

I ate 2 of the oysters and by the time the steak even came out, I had already RAN through the restaurant to vomit. After the steak came, I took one bite of it and had to run back to the restroom again. I tried to at least continue to sit through dinner because my friends had come in from out of town, but I couldn't. For the rest of the night I continued to puke to the point that I ended up in the E.R. with severe dehydration and a confirmed case of food poisoning from oysters. The next day before my friend left town, she stopped by the restaurant to tell them that I had spent the night in the E.R. She demanded a refund for dinner because of the fact that I ended up in the hospital, and because our dinner was cut short due to them serving toxic oysters. They did end up refunding her for dinner and told her they would like to take care of my medical bills. Unfortunately, a few days later when I called, the manager she had spoken with was no longer employed there. Since then, I have been waiting for weeks at a time to get return phone calls from management and the restaurants insurance company. Both have now told me that this is the fault of the company that supplies them with the seafood even though they were the ones that served it to me. Two oysters and a bite of steak ended up costing me 72 hours of misery and nearly $2000.

This recent visit I had to change reservations at the last minute and they were able to take care of our last minute larger party with no problem.  The restaurant itself is a shrine to old time Chicago Bears Football and Chicago Sports as well as many of the teams Da Coach has played with and worked with over the years all done tastefully in the style of a high end restaurant. Full Size Bar area is right inside the door along with a small gift shop counter. The Second floor area is mostly for larger parties and or private group dining. The Main level restaurant sits just to the left as you enter and the also on those perfect Chicago days have limited outdoor seating. The service and food...

All these years, I just figured Ditka's was an overpriced downtown restaurant attracting tourists with too much testosterone.  I stand corrected. Ditka's is a great Chicago fine dining experience, and I hope the tourist trade continues to support it as time marches on, because as a Chicagoan, I'd like it to remain in our star lineup, and downtown rents aren't cheap.      Just make sure at least one of you has the pork chop.  At this point, I can't eat a pork chop until I go back.  I've tried other places and making my own, but Ditka's ruined me.  I am not even a big pork chop fan. Ditka's porkchop-it's signature dish-is huge Berkshire chop- they slice it in half after cooking. Makes it easy to share, but next time- it's all mine.  Everything else was top notch, too.

One review had a photo saying ""and this is only a half order"" and it looked big but being a small 100 lb Asian girl, I could of very well killed the entire large order at $16 on my own and still precede to my main course. I got ""da pork chop"" which was pork chop, apple chutney, and mashes sweet potatoes. This was actually really delicious and I would recommend it for anyone coming here. Pork chop was very tender and complemented the rest of the aides very very well and at lunch time it was only 18$ plate which was very very well worth it. I would come back here for lunch entree because the price at lunch was very worth the meal. But it was nothing out of this world that I would crave to come back anytime soon or probably ever.

He proceeds to tell me there's more than 3 selections and hurriedly flips the page on the menu to Pinot Noir. He obviously wasn't listening. (2) He asked us where we were from. I guess he assumed we were tourists. (3) I ordered raw oysters and asked for no horse radish. He says the horse radish is on the side dear and pats me as if I was a child. (4)  After that everything was fine until the end of the meal. They brought a birthday dessert for my friend which was nice. But she was stuffed so she asked the bus person if it could be wrapped to go. He took it with no problem to wrap up. But when he went toward the back with the waiter, the waiter gave the gesture to him as to why we wanted it wrapped to go. I guess he didn't realize one of us saw him when he did this so that did not sit too well with us.  Overall the food was good. But this waiter was not good.

The dining room was a decent size and was filling up with an early dinner crowd, even at 4:00 on a Monday... I ended up getting a seat at the bar and settled in with a few brews and ordered the pot roast nachos. What followed was a giant mound of tortilla chips covered smothered and top off with well... a heaping portion of pot roast... not just any pot roast but good pot roast, like the kind your grandma makes on cold winter nights. It was more than enough for one soul to indore dispite its deliciousness. The gentleman next to me was enjoying what looked like the porterhouse which was also bountiful and looked delicious. So i take it the portions are pretty heaping so come hungry even if it is listed as an apitizer.

We have only run into Ditka himself here once, but he is in often enough that we have many friends who have caught up with him (and had a photo taken, which he was very kind about!)  We have also been here for a few years on Christmas Eve. Our church service is nearby so we come here after. It is so beautifully decorated and they put a ""fireplace"" scene on the TVs which makes it really cozy. However, I admit this is year (2014) was the one time the service wasn't up to par - our food took an exorbitantly long time to arrive and we did feel as though out server was pushing us to keep opening bottles of wine, even though we repeatedly told him several of us were driving.  My husband and I have come here for several ""date nights"" and love bringing out of town guests here - all with great experiences. Most people order the steak, but we've also had rave reviews about the salads and especially the meatloaf (my aunt was so excited to save some for the next day for lunch - she looked forward to it all morning!)

We were seated upstairs in a semi private back room (who knew this restaurant was so big and stretched so far back!). Our waiter was SO wonderful and friendly and bantered with everyone in our group. Drinks were flowing, appetizers going around. Oysters were wonderful and I HIGHLY recommend getting the calamari but GRILLED. I have a dairy and gluten allergy, and even on such a busy night they took wonderful care of me and were able to work around it.  Now the main course....holy crap! How have I never eaten at Ditka's before for all the years I've lived here?!?! I ordered the salmon with mixed veggies and white rice. My first bite literally fell apart and melted in my mouth. I took my first bite and just went ""holy shit....heaven."" Everyone at the table ordered food from the salmon to chicken, sea bass and of course steak and prime rib and we all had the same reaction to the food! I don't think I've sat at a table before with more mini plates flying back and forth because everyone wanted to try something the other had.  A friend ordered the banana cream pie and being a chef himself was blown away by the dessert and the use of fresh fruit inside it which he appreciated.  My only one complaint was the valet....I paid inside but had the tip in my hand to give him. When he pulled up with my car I handed him the tip and he looks at me and goes ""you still owe me $12."" I was a bit floored by his tone and told him I paid inside. I understand him asking, but he needs to find another way that is more polite when it comes to discussing money. Then after I drove a few blocks I realized he didn't even give me my keys! He was so focused on counting the money he kept my keys in his coat pocket.

The main course was the prime rib sandwich. Also very delicious and a generous portion of meat. The bread was crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. The dipping sauce was perfect. I ordered the sweet potato as opposed to regular french fries and I'm very glad I did, they were money.  All in all, if you are in Chicago, this place is some gimmick.

The waiter came by several times to bring us menu's and take our drink order. His service deteriorated as time went on. As we waited I watched the servers zoom by one by one bringing food to their patrons. It took longer than I would have expected to get our burgers. I didn't get the pork chop to speed things along. I got the Kobe burger with sweet potato fries and an extra side of slaw. The burger was the thickest, juiciest, best cooked piece of ground meat that I have ever had. That being said. It was hanging on to just being warm. I know it wasn't waiting for the fries because they were even colder. The slaw that was heavy on the horse radish was probably scooped out of a bucket.

Solid.   I felt greens were in order so our server suggested ""Mike's Salad""- I love it. I thought it was hearty enough for a meal! Lots of pecans, apples, goat cheese goodness. Glad my husband and I shared.  I had the twin filets enjoyed with glasses of Freemark Abbey cabernet.  Can't go wrong with Napa wines!  At this point I was feeling full but not over the top full. The filets were so tender and just the right size at 4 oz each. My husband and his friend had ""Da Pork Chop"" which was also recommended by our server. Beautiful dish. Pork chop was very very flavorful. Our other friend had the Chilean Sea Bass which was an absolute hit.  We did get the lobster mac and cheese side dish to share - another recommendation that was spot on.  Lots of chunky lobster and gooey cheese.

2014-09-01,5.0,"One more review of Ditka's is not going to make much sway in the opinions held of this place. After all, this restaurant is an institution, a way of life and a shining beacon of humor depending on your knowledge of ""Saturday Night Live"" skits. Nonetheless, this review is here for a couple of reasons, the main one being that just on scanning through most of these prior write-ups, no one has talked about lunch (which was what I was here for). The other reason being that this is totally bragging rights for me because I got to eat here, check in here on Facebook and probably embarrass myself as I strolled past the bathroom door upstairs and had to casually double-back to find it (more on that later). My folks have raved about this place for years, and for good reason: it gets packed at night, with reservations being nothing short of a necessity, despite how huge the property is. Multiple dining rooms open up both on the ground floor and upstairs, not to mention the patio outside, but the customers keep coming back and it's because of... well, I'm sure a lot of things. Some people will probably love the memorabilia on the walls. And some will love the spacious private dining rooms for events. Some may even get a rush from Ditka looking back at them as they do their business in the bathroom (pictures of Ditka, that is). I'm going to guess, though, the majority of patrons keep coming back for the delicious food and exceptional service. So the three of us walked in one morning for lunch and the place was just about empty. A hostess greeted us and took us to a table in the dining room and it was just a matter of seconds before our server came up. For the life of me, I cannot remember his name, but he had a bit of a Jim Carrey vibe going on, but in a good way! Like, ""Eternal Sunshine..."" Jim Carrey and not... every other instance of Jim Carrey. But that doesn't matter! He was quick without being overbearing, honest about the menu and he pulled a few strings to convince the chef to serve us a crab cake as an appetizer as opposed to the entree it usually is reserved for during dinner hours. With Iron Mike beers in hand, and iced tea just because, we chowed down on that crab cake and I immediately sold out to my favorite seafood places in Dallas by declaring this the best crab cake I have eaten. Honestly, the thing looked massive and may appear intimidating at first, but you can scarf that thing down in seconds depending on how voracious your appetite. And you can then use the seconds afterward to have an internal debate on whether or not you should order another one. Hint: you should. We placed our entree orders and I headed off to find the bathroom. The place is expansive but easy to get around in, at least on the ground floor. Heading upstairs is where things get a little tricky but not to the point where you need to travel in pairs and brush up on your cartography skills. A dining room and bar are right at the top of the steps and from there you go off into hallways splitting into other private rooms. I actually managed to walk right past the door to the bathroom while actively searching it out. But with that taken care of, I hurried back down and readied myself for lunch. The three of us each ordered a different burger: The ""Fridge"" (think your standard burger with lettuce, tomatoes, etc.), Iron Mike (think a farmhouse-type burger with the egg atop it) and the Caliente (think a burger designed to make you rip your tongue out and dunk it in a glass of water). All the burgers were delicious and messy, making me consider going the knife-and-fork route with mine, but all were worth the effort it took to polish them off. Shortly thereafter, a busser came by and cleared the table without haste and we were on our way. There's no doubt that Ditka's excels because of the reputation it has built for late-night dining. But you may be pleasantly surprised by their lunch options, too. I guess the takeaway conclusion here is if this place is open and you're hungry, it should be a no-brainer for stopping in and sitting down.",0.9971,0.849,0.118,0.033,0.44230530753968245

2014-08-15,4.0,"Restaurant review This is a limited review for a Northwestern Chicago Live dinner reception on the second floor. In the past year, they had a sit down event which was great, but this time we had an even better experience. It was a open bar and finger food circulating around the room party. The bar itself was great, they make a mean long island ice tea and had a large selection of other beverages to choose from. The food itself was good, sliders, chicken skewer, sushi? not sure why they have sushi at Mike Ditka, more sliders, and a large selection of dessert. I wish we had steak, but this was a good dinner still. Wait staff was friendly and attentive throughout the event! Pro: friendly staff, good drinks Cons:  Hidden gem: None, pre-fixe menu at the Oak Brook location",0.9904,0.732,0.244,0.024,0.5155671296296297
2014-08-12,4.0,"It was a night out with some old friends before we all went back to our respective schools. We chose Ditka's because it had a very good rating on Yelp, had options besides steak, and also didn't want to go anywhere too fancy. It was a Monday night and although we didn't need reservations, there were a decent amount of people in there at about 8pm, with the bar/lounge filling up as we ate.  The inside of the place has a bar, lounge and I think some sort of upstairs. Its not exactly a very modern interior, but had a traditional/old world feel to it like Chicago Chop House. We were in the dining room, which is actually kind of tight quarters, but still comfortable. Lots of Ditka memorabilia and football related-stuff, if you like Ditka (or football) this is your place! I did order a glass of a bold Cabernet, I think it was called ""Nickel & Nickel"", which was OK, but in my opinion not as tasty as the Chianti I usually like to get, which they did not have available in a glass. We shared a couple of appetizers which included the organic kale salad and the guacamole & salsa. Both were fantastic and the guacamole gave some of the Mexican places I've been to a run for their money. There were 3 steaks and one chicken dinner. I can only vouch for the prime filet, which, though pricey, was very delicious and cooked to perfection. The chicken was a very large portion, and was quite flavorful. It came with veggies and maybe even a potato. We shared 2 sides of the lobster mac and cheese and the red-skin smashed potatoes. The potatoes were pretty good, but the lobster mac was better. I think I would get the lobster mac every time I went there, it was really that great. We also had enough room for desert, which we ordered the peanut butter pie and the crème brule. The peanut butter pie was fantastic while the crème brule was just fair, I've had better. Not a big deal. The service was good, there was only one slip-up that may have been perpetuated by us. We did take a long time to get our order in, but the salad and appetizer was served before our menus were collected and before we ordered our entrees. This was annoying as we had to hold the menus and nobody wanted to start eating until our entire order was put in. The desert also took an unusually long time to come out. Other than that, our server was nice, and even helped us pick the sides so everyone had a decent portion. We had a good time, and though the atmosphere wasn't exactly my style, the food was good and that's really all that counts. I'd probably go back, but would probably rather spend a lot of money elsewhere.",0.9984,0.81,0.182,0.009,0.5650649350649352

This place was not. It was classy and tastefully decorated in Ditka memorabilia and photos.  My husband had the prime steak with lobster Mac and cheese. He said the steak was good, but not the best he's ever had. The lobster Mac was amazing, very well seasoned and creamy! I had the filet two ways. I asked for medium well and ended up with medium, on the edge of medium rare, but it tasted good. The hollandaise was amazing and I wish I asked for more to smother my steak in. The horseradish on the other steak was very overpowering. Unless you love horseradish I would recommend asking for it on the side or scraping it off. For dessert we opted for the flour less chocolate cake. My husband ate the ice cream that came with it. The actual cake itself was not what I expected. I guess I prefer flour in my cake. It was like eating diet chocolate pudding.  Over all I would say the atmosphere is better than the actual food but for a Bears fan I think it would be a great time.",0.9924,0.745,0.213,0.042,0.505072463768116

So the following morning we decided to revisit for breakfast before heading home from the city.

We were there late at night so there weren't a lot of people in the restaurant but I can see how it would be a great place for groups and special events.  We really enjoyed most of our time there & this would be a five star review had it not been for the unprofessional manner of the staff. Maybe it was because it was late on a holiday and they were excited to be closing soon, I'm not sure. Their attitude towards the customers was very polite and respectful. It was the way they interacted with each other that brought down my rating. It was very quiet in the restaurant so I'm sure that played a role as well but during our time there we were bombarded with the conversations the staff were having with each other. Apparently the hostess was having some sort of issue with school and the buser and waiter are ""bro's"", we also overheard our waiter (who was very professional while serving us) drop the F word in casual conversation with staff...by overheard I mean we were sitting at a table not far from the lobby in which these conversations were taking place and it distracted us from our own conversation.

2014-07-07,5.0,"I've had the pleasure of eating at quite a few of Chicago's steak houses but Ditka's so far has been my favorite. I'm not going to lie. Ditka's is not cheap. But the quality of what you get is well worth the price. And a bargain compared to other places in town. First the inside is decorated with so much cool memorabilia. Not cheesy stuff like at a sports bar but the real stuff collected over a career spanning decades. What's nice is there are a number of zones in the place.  One is more of a sports bar feel with TV's, the bar and more casual seating. The other is a dining room where we sat that's more cloth napkins and cutlery and then there's upstairs which looks like it's been modified to be more party rooms for groups. So no matter what you're looking for, you can find it here.  Mark our server was excellent. Very professional but fun to interact with. He understood that the four of us were here to have a nice meal with good friends and enjoy ourselves. He was always around and never once did we have to ask for water, bread, cutlery, etc. When our appetizers were brought out, he was there and noticed right away I had ordered a bowl of soup not a cup and swapped it out immediately.  Speaking of food, the soup in question was the lobster bisque. Even thought it was the dead heat of summer, I could not turn it down and I'm glad I didn't. Using sherry as a base, it was complex, creamy and quite a treat. The bowl was a large portion and perhaps given what was about to come next, the cup would have been a smarter move. Wife and friends had the Caesar salad and enjoyed it. Pretty basic but that's what it is.  Our dinner was outstanding. There was a special steak on the menu called a Tomahawk cut and now we know why. With a dry aged steak as big as your head and a bone that was easily a foot long sticking out of it, you could really go all Fred Flintstone as it just made you want to pick it up all caveman style and go to town.  My friend's wife had the kick ass paddle-steak, a 20 ounce bone in rib-eye which like the tomahawk had a sizable bone sticking out. Both were reported as excellent with the rib-eye being slightly more flavorful (they usually are) but the tomahawk being more tender.  My wife and I both had the filets. She did the filet two-ways which came served with one horseradish crusted and one with Bearnaise. I had a similar dish except mine was topped with two lump meat crab cakes and lemon and green peppercorn sauce. Our steaks were center cut filets and unbelievably tender and juicy. Cooked medium well, they were were perfect with some pink in the middle and a nice char on the outside. And the crab cakes were all crab and no filled like breadcrumbs. Sides were good but we stuck to the basics. Mashed sweet and asparagus. The lobster mac and cheese looked dangerous and given the amount of food in front of us, we're glad we didn't get it as we would have probably exploded. I might go back for just that. We ordered desert and had the banana cream pie and the raspberry cheesecake. The cheesecake was OK and probably the weakest link in the meal but honestly, that's like only winning $100 million in the lottery instead of $200 million. The pie? UN-frigging-believable. I would go to Ditka's just for the pie it was that good. We could not figure out how they got it to be so flavorful as usually banana cream pie is kinda bland. And the banana's stood up the weight of all that cream and sat nicely on the crust so when you put your fork into it, it cut away cleanly and didn't ooze all over the place. Sorry about using the word ooze in a food review. There is an extensive wine list in a wide variety of price ranges and a nice scotch and after dinner drink menu as well.  Sure this is Chicago and there are a lot of steak joints in the this town. But for the price and the quality of what you got, Ditka's is up there as one of my faves. Sure they could coast on Da Coach's rep but I'm glad they chose not to. Skip Smith & Wollensky and come here instead. You will be glad you did.",0.9993,0.758,0.2,0.042,0.5972100122100122

I ordered my steak medium with a loaded twice baked potato. The steak was a little tough than what I had expected and it had a burnt flavor to it. The potato wasn't real hot but was okay. The best thing was that our waters never went empty. The minute our glasses were close to being empty a gentleman filled them up immediately! Must be a designated water person. Amazing that guy was.

With the steak, shared a flight of sides.  This was probably the most disappointing element.  You could only order certain sides and it is very starch heavy. Was looking forward to the lobster mac cheese but it tasted more like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese with a some lobster meat dropped in than some of the really interesting mac cheese now available at steak houses.  Creamed corn was just corn in milk, effectively, while corn tamale cake was very bland. Banana creme pie was an excellent dessert.   Two other things, one good, one bad.  Wine list had a lot of wine by the glass and also a lot of nice bottles very reasonably priced, much better value than many other steak houses.  On the down side, had reservation for two weeks and was seated in the bar.  Not a big deal, we wanted to watch the hockey game, but should of been given the option of dining room or bar.   To sum up, good steak with complex flavor but not superior to the best steaks in Chicago.  Sides were mediocre at best, dessert was good.",0.9962,0.713,0.239,0.048,0.579845141308556

Our water glasses practically never went dry and if we needed more bread or a beverage refill, it was brought to us promptly.

The meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection; the pork tender and full of flavor, the burger juicy and savory. The mashed potatoes and vegetables that accompanied the pork chop were cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of seasoning and the sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had.  The waiter offered wine and beer pairings that went great with our meals and were reasonably priced. The wine, beer and alcohol menu is extensive. There's definitely something for everybody.

2014-02-19,5.0,"I won't bore you with a big drawn out review. If you want meat specifically ""Da Pork Chop"" or the not listed on the menu ""Tomahawk"" then this is the place. It's a Chicago Steakhouse and it caters to the carnivore. Ditka's is a place for the guys or the gals when you are looking to get your carnivore on. They also have a nice selection of local brews and a very decent wine list. I usually get the Tomahawk which is a bone-in rib eye but like none other in the fact that there is no trimming of the bone length so it is quite impressive coming out on or more to the point hanging off the plate. The steak is not really that oversized but it is a full meal so I don't recommend you mess with a bunch of apps or salads. But if you want a killer app the Roast Beef Nachos are a sure bet, just as the name says beef and nachos, killer. As I pointed out earlier there is also Da Pork Chop it's a 2 bone cut of pork that is a beautiful thing to behold, and is cooked just right, its hard for me not to get the Tomahawk but DPC is a great alternative. This place has been here for a long time so don't think it is a place for just hype and no substance because that is certainly not the case. The steaks are great the service is very attentive and for what you are getting in downtown Chicago it's not unreasonably priced either.

This was definitely not the case. Ditka's serves high quality food in an amazing ambiance. You walk in there and it feels high class yet not pretentious. The food satisfies both the ""average man carnivore "" and the ""refined, hipster glasses wearing, yuppie that you'd be embarassed to introduce to your parents""  I would bring a date here, I bring a business partner here, I'd take an 80 year old woman here, it fits everyone. Everything i've had here is delicious, but I'm a big fan of the pork chop. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better quality hunk of pig. The chop is juicier than a political sex scandal or a Spanish clementine.  Also a big fan of the desserts. they're huge. They're Ron Jeremy sized.",0.9497,0.832,0.144,0.024,0.5164705882352941

What I liked about the menu at Ditkas was they had a wide array of selections, hey have you covered from upscale steak house to classic comfort food.  And they cover a lot of price points, so if you want a $60 tomahawk steak like I ordered, they have you covered with a steak as good as you will find at any steakhouse in the city.  My wife had the meatloaf, and it was delicious.  We split an order of lobster mac and cheese, and I could have just made a meal out of that.

The NY strip was money with some mike ditka wine and a mike ditka cigar to end the night right.

Just get one..It comes with all the fixings and even a side car of mikes own beer! All great! Day 3 was Pan seared salmon with a jalapeño corn cake. Again awesome. Day four was a ton of mikes wine and an assortment of apps. Service was great every time and the bartenders were friendly and very knowledgable. If your lucky mike will be there as well.

Some of the memorabilia is pretty cool, unfortunately we were seated in a back corner room with not as much.  Our server did a great job, friendly and helpful and about everything you want in a waiter. Food was good but nothing special. For appetizers we got a Shrimp Cocktail and some French Onion Soup. Both were pretty good, and the Shrimp were nice and big (although for $17 I would sure hope so). We both ordered the Prime Filet Mignon. The sear on both steaks was very good but my steak came out rare even tho it was ordered medium. When they brought it back it was questionably medium rare (but barely and nowhere near medium) but I was pretty hungry so I just went with it.  The grilled onions were actually very good and my mom's Bearnaise sauce was serviceable. Asparagus was very bland and the potatoes were good, but again nothing special.  We got the banana creme pie for dessert which was pretty good.  If you're in town and looking for a place to go with some history then this place is for you. If you live in Chicago and are looking for a good steak place I'd recommend going somewhere else.

(they should try chopping the spinach instead of leaving as whole leaves.)  But the smashed sweet potatoes were DIVINE. Just sweet enough and just mashed enough. Plate-licking good they were!  But as scrumptious as the entrees were, la piece de resistance was the banana cream pie. I don't even like banana cream pie...or I didn't until I tried Ditka's!

In terms of what I tried I shared the two filets with shrimp scampi with a friend. The meat was good; the shrimp a bit oversalted and I think both of us were expecting shrimp scampi pasta versus just a breaded shrimp on top of the steak so that was a bit disappointing.

I mentioned it to my boyfriend and he assured me it was Ditka. We became calm but excited ( being from la its not cool to swoon when you see celebs). I asked the host if it was him and he said yes, and told me i could take pics with him and everything. He made me feel very comfortable asking about his boss.

2012-12-29,3.0,"It was the weekend before Christmas, many creatures were stirring in the city of Chicago, including my wife and I in town to pick up my brother and his kids flying in for the holidays. After a long drive from Michigan we're hungry.  Our first option for food has a que for over an hour, so we decide on Ditka's, which we spotted just before we went to check out option number one. So Ditka's it is. I'm excited. Being a Bears fan, it was the Ditka team I caught my 6 year old imagination and made me a fan of American football. We enter the restaurant and leave the cold. It's busy inside but we're seated immediately. To the right is a stall selling merchandise. We're brought upstairs to fine looking dining room. The walls are creams and browns and full of memorabilia.  We're seated in the middle of room, a nice round clothed table. It's a bit swish, everyone is dressed up here and there is a very formal but relaxed demeanour, a group of men, one with a Walter Payton jersey to the left of me, what I gather is a group of friends uniting before the Christmas break to the left of me. At the top right of the room is a bar. There are TVs everywhere. Ditka's is a mix of sports bar and high-end restaurant. The prices are high-end restaurant that's for sure. Our server is very nice and chats away to us. Conscious of the prices I go for the $16 Kobe beef burger. My wife goes for the pot roast, in the end we also splash out on a fine bottle of Riesling. It's our first night off from the baby in over a month after all! The wine is fantastic, beautiful and cool. We both have soups to start. Both very good. My wife's pot roast is immaculate, very earthy and flavourful. My burger is also very good, layers of ingredients between the bun. It's good food, but I do feel it's a bit overpriced. I look around after, there's some impressive memorabilia on the walls. The place is also huge, with an upstairs and downstairs and private rooms available. There's a nice memorabilia stand at the bottom of the stairs which doubles as a coat room.  We skip desserts and coffee as we are conscious of how much we've already spent. It's a must for a Bears fan, and the whole place screams of Mike Dikta's taste. But I can't escape the niggling thought in the back of my mind, regardless of how good the food is, there's a extra buck of two on the price just because it has the name Ditka on it.",0.997,0.823,0.161,0.016,0.5026042820228867

My family and I have dined there 10+ times and the experience has always been worthy of 4-5 stars. This Ditka's, however, was a huge disappointment. I took two friends who had never dined at Ditka's. I should have tried the downtown location before assuming that it would be the same as the Oakbrook restaurant.  First, the waiter was slow and far too casual with us; his attitude came off as disrespectful. I understand that he may have been more comfortable with us as we were likely the same age but that doesn't mean we don't expect the same prompt service that those around us appeared to be receiving. Our food came out, after taking a very long time, and he did not ask us if everything was satisfactory until we were almost finished. He took over 20 minutes to bring us our check after we requested it and our drinks often sat empty.   Second, the food we were served left me embarrassed that I ever suggested going here with my friends. Two of us ordered stakes which came out at room temperature as if they had been sitting out for over fifteen minutes. Mine was indeed cooked correctly at medium-rare but my friend's medium was even more rare than mine.The other ordered a hamburger but I don't know what he thought about it. Jalapeno hash browns sucked. They were soggy and bland. The one's I've had at the other location were crispy and flavorful, not greasy crap like the ones I received.

We showed up early and didn't have to wait long to get our table. It was pleasantly full but not overcrowded like I had feared.  I wasn't drinking on this particular night but the boys were and they all commented that their drinks were strong. I ordered the lobster bisque to start and it left much to be desired. I'm a seafood snob too and I've had the real deal back at home so I wasn't expecting much to begin with. The calamari though was surprising, I really enjoyed it. It wasn't too fried and our group of 5 split it well, no one was left wanting more. For dinner, I went with the fillet mignon done two ways. They were both about the same size but came with different toppings. One was done Oscar style and one with horseradish. I think I like the Oscar style one best but they were both cooked perfectly rare. My bf and I split some mashed potatoes and they were excellent in my opinion and came out piping hot in a skillet.  One of the guys in our group got the surf and turf which was a 4 oz center cut filet with veal demi, 4 jumbo baked, breaded shrimp with lemon garlic butter, and sautéed root vegetables. He seemed to really enjoy it and cleaned the plate. My bf went with the NY strip steak and he liked it as well. I don't remember what the other guys got but I know it was of the red meat variety.  For dessert, the bf got key lime pie which was alright and I went for the cheesecake which was excellent.

Attentive service as well.  Worth a return trip.,0.9779,0.709,0.291,0.0,0.76

TWO times I went to go to the ladies room and men were using the bathroom in there.  I am not paying over $200 for a dinner to have to wait for rude customers to read the door and follow directions.  If it is a super busy weekend, which this was, the management should have a better handle on the clientele.

2012-09-24,5.0,"Great food, great atmosphere, great service, great location!  I was new to Yelp and leery of going to a place with great reviews in case we were let down from high expectations.  This restaurant, along with others we reviewed and tried, didn't let us down one bit.  We made reservations for 12:00PM at approximately 9:30AM the same day, and I will add that noon was kickoff for a home game vs. Rams.  I don't know how busy it normally is, but we were so happy to get in!  We arrived about 15 minutes early, and we were seated at a booth up a few steps from the floor.  We sat in a perfect distance from a very clear TV, and we were surrounded by about six other TV's, all with the Bears game on.  We decided to start off with an appetizer and drinks and asked if it would be OK to watch the whole game.  They waitress was kind and said there was no problem with that.  They had a tailgate menu, and we decided to go for the Tailgate Tower which consisted of loaded fries, wings, and pot roast nachos.  A-MAZ-ING.  We were told to try the pot roast nachos and glad we did.  My husband orders wings just about everywhere we go, so I was hoping these wings would not disappoint us.  We both agreed they were probably the best wings we had ever had.  Normal wings are flavorful on the outside, but the chicken inside is, well, chicken.  These wings had a distinct out-of-this-world flavor on the outside, and the flavor continued on throughout the whole wing.  The fries of course were perfect as well (real cut-from-the-potato type of fry smothered in perfect cheese and topped with pieces of bacon)!  I was also a little hesitant because we went there for food, the game, and of course drinks, but one review I read said Ditka's was chincy on the alcohol.  No ma'am.  I ordered a Mai Tai, and there was no skipping on any alcohol.  If anything it felt like they gave me extra!  And it was delish!!  Since we had planned to stay for the whole game, we waited until about half-time to order again, and we decided to try one plate, share it, and order again later!  Haha - this is not our typical restaurant behavior, but we both wanted to try everything!  We decided to try the Maryland Style Crab Cake entrée.  Once again, it was excellent.  I had never had a crab cake, but I figured if I wanted to try one, I should do it here.  Again, I was not let down.  The sides, rice and coleslaw, may seem boring from just reading the menu, but they were delicious as well!  We were actually pretty full and had plans to get a hot dog later, so we decided to skip the last entrée.  Throughout our entire time there, our drinks were filled, our dirty dishes were taken away, and we were tended to as necessary, but not bugged.  Perfection if you ask me.  All in all, we had high expectations for this place due to reviews and recommendations, and those expectations were met, if not exceeded.",0.9976,0.789,0.166,0.045,0.5469368686868687

Great bartender named Eddie (Isn't there a Carlin skit about guys named Eddie, and what happened to them?). We walk in and my Dad, who is really not that sick, is hacking and coughing like he is on his death bed. I mean he is acting like you would think Magic Johnson would be 20 years in on his HIV. I crack a joke to Eddie about how is has stage 3 cancer, he somehow buys it and then i immediately tell him I'm joking and that he's just being a wimp. Eddie proceeds to make him an old school hot totty. I had a couple of beers on draft, we both had burgers and couldn't have been happier. Service was lightening quick and food was delicious. In fact it was so good, that after going back to the hotel for a. workout for me b. nap for Magic, we met my cousin there for drinks before dinner. I hopped in a cab and headed to the north side, but my Dad and cousin stayed and went upstairs for what they both said was a wonderful dinner. 2. Fast forward 24 hours, and at this point my brother, Dad and I sat behind home plate at Wrigley for Cubs/Cards, then went down to my friends bar ""the Stretch"" and continued pounding drinks. My brother drops us off at the hotel, and we shower and get cleaned up. We try getting into Gibson's....hour wait, we try getting into Hugo's....hour wait, finally my Dad says, ""i know this sounds crazy, but I would love to go back to Ditka's."" So we head back over and walk to the upstairs bar. The hostess asks me if we checked in downstairs and then tells me there is a 45 minute wait, I quickly put a couple 20's in her hand and ask how that wait is looking ""actually it disappeared Mr. Sullivan and your table just opened up in front.""            At this point my old man is ecstatic. he thinks this is a scene out of Goodfella's. We go to our table, and good looking lady early 40's comes over and says ""came back to see us again,uh honey?"" and rubbed his shoulders. He starts telling me its because of the huge tip he left last night.....I inform him that its probably because he is wearing the same ridiculous shirt for the 2nd night in a row. so the highlights 1. 20 oz bone in ribeye was fantastic 2. Great Chianti 3. The staff was wonderful. 2 blond ladies worked the upstairs and could not have been classier in how they waited w/ us. 4. For dessert my dad orders this Oreo cookie, ice cream platter that was as wonderful as it was enormous. OMG, I am not even crazy about ice cream and couldn't get enough. 5. This is the 3rd time I have seen him, but John Vincent is an impersonator singer of all the greats, Dean Martin, Johnny Cash, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra......I mean you would think the guys were singing it themselves. It made for the neatest ambiance in the world. Half the steakhouse was singing along. Guys in suits and ties, guys like us, a bachelorette party of 10 girls and a couple queens, it was a great variety and this guy brought down the house.

If you are a visitor to Chicago, or a resident like me, Ditka's is a MUST.  Yes, it's a celebrity restaurant so it's going to attract every meathead football fan who figures that because it's Ditka, it must have good food.  Well, it is Ditka's place, and yes, he's there often and very friendly, and YES the food is excellent.  So gals, it's OK to go with your moron husband who spends forever on the couch watching football like it's going to make him better at...ummmm.....errr.....how the hell does watching football make the quality of life better??  Anyway Ditka's (head bow) is a very fine steak house in the best of the Chicago tradition.  First, the martinis are pure and classic.  I recommend at least one.  The pot-roast nachos are incredible!! I'm not a pot-roast fan, but they make a fantastic nacho!  Their NY strips and T-bones are done perfectly, the meat seems to be perfectly tenderized and and the a la carte sides are amazing.  The mashed potatoes are soooooo good.  Very creamy and flavorful at the same time.  With the fine meal you'll have, it's an abomination to not finish it off with a single-malt scotch or grappa.  Perfect digestives.

I'm as guilty as anyone when I view Ditka's as somehow lesser than the other Chicago standby steakhouses (Gibson's, Chicago Cut, Gene & Georgetti, etc.) due to its celebrity-themed nature.  True, the autographed photos and sports memorabilia on the walls may not create as nice or romantic a feel as certain other venues, but after visiting for dinner this past Saturday I left the restaurant realizing I've yet to have a bad meal here in my half dozen tries. The steaks are always good, well prepared, perfectly salted, and not overpriced (most are $35 to $50).  The sides are amazing and plenty big enough to share -- the jalapeno hash browns are outstanding.  The spinach salad with warm bacon dressing is delicious and unique.  The wine list is lengthy and is priced so that there is something for all budgets.  The banana creme pie is a must.  Service is impeccable.  The restaurant is almost always packed and the energy is vibrant, but it's not so loud that you can't carry on a conversation with your table.

It was just so delicious. My husband had the Meat Loaf Stack, which he was moaning over and afterwards declared was the best meat loaf he'd ever had.

2011-12-13,4.0,"Da Coach! Ditka's stands as one of my favorite places in Chicago to get steaks. The main differentiator here is that they've always cooked my order perfectly to specification, which seems to be the biggest issue for steakhouses anywhere. I also really like the ambience/atmosphere. Definitely an upscale place, but photos of Da Coach line the walls and the football theme is present but not overdone. I've dined in the lounge (bar on the 1st level), the main dining room, as well as upstairs, and each is a good experience and slightly different in their own ways.  FOOD: I've had the bone-in filet, rack of lamb (sadly no longer on the menu), and most recently the 22oz ""paddle steak"", which is a bone-in ribeye and what our server referred to as the best steak on the menu. At $39, it's also a pretty good value IMO. As I stated above, everything I've had has been cooked exactly how I ordered. Medium rare is true to form, and the cuts are of high quality. For example, my paddle steak had the right amount of marbling and didn't suffer from the extra fat and gristle that ribeyes can often suffer from. As a friend stated, the crust on the steaks here is beautiful; it's a nice, thin crust without over-charring that adds a lot to the flavor and texture of the steak.  One thing that I did notice this time around is the quality of the sides - they seem to have gotten both smaller and less appealing, both visually and taste. Although one could argue that they're just sides, they're an integral part of a steak experience. We got the asparagus and jalapeno hashbrowns this time around, and I felt like both were mediocre. The hashbrowns also seem to have shrunk to about half their original size. Thankfully, the steak was so big and delicious that I was still satisfied with my meal overall. That, and the bread rolls are delivered hot and they were soft, so that makes up a bit for the sides.  Now dessert - that was incredibly disappointing. The 6 layer chocolate cake was dry and tasted like it came from a box; the frosting was reminiscent of the canned variety you could get from any chain grocery store. The key lime pie was far too rich and sweet. The only thing that I enjoyed was the banana creme pie, although I've had much better. Do yourself a favor and skip the dessert menu and head somewhere else. The desserts and sides almost knocked this review down to 3 stars for me, but given the positive experiences of the past two times and the quality of the actual beef, I opted to keep it at 4 stars. SERVICE: Service was a bit slow at first, but that was likely due to a minor miscommunication as our server believed that we were waiting for the 4th member of our party when we were going to order without her. After this initial confusion, service was a lot faster and refills on our drinks were carried in an almost ninja-like fashion. The busboy kept clearing our half-full basket of bread, prompting us to ask for more. However, this probably worked out in our favor since we got 3 fresh baskets of bread each time one of us wanted another roll. VALUE/OVERALL: When looking at Ditka's, one focuses on the main course - the meat. And Ditka's delivers on that end magnificently. Perfect crust and temperature for great cuts of beef. The prices are very reasonable, although not outstanding for all cuts of beef. Overall, I've always enjoyed my experience at Ditka's, and it still stands as one of my favorites in the city.",0.999,0.768,0.196,0.036,0.555245946863594
2011-12-11,5.0,"I'm from Wisconsin and a Packer fan. Having said that, I LOVE this place. As you come out of the revolving door it's like you're stepping back to 1940's Chicago. There's a classy, aire of professionalism here and you notice it as soon as you walk in. We entered right into the front waiting area that was packed and gave our name to the friendly & smiling hostess. She advised us of the wait and took our names. For the next 40 minutes I watched her greet couple after couple the same way - cheerful & smiling like she'd seen them before - almost like she was greeting members of her own family. Make no mistake, this place isn't cheap but while you're going to shell out a fairly good chunk of money to eat here, you are not going to leave hungry. We usually come here for lunch then skip dinner because of the size of the portions. If you're a burger person this is the only place in Chicago to eat. The burgers are really the best in the city. Steaks are very good as well but again, fair warning, they are expensive. A 14 oz NY Strip was $47.00. Burgers start at $11.00. I recommend the onion strings with the spicy ranch dip on the side. The fries were a bit disappointing -  greasy and thin - I'd like to see them go with steak fries. The drinks are what you would expect in a football sports bar - large, lots of liquor but again pricey. I had a Margarita that came in a pilsner type glass and was nice & potent.  If there's a downside to Ditka's its the restroom location & size. Both are upstairs so you really have to make your way through the crowd, climb the staircase, maneuver  through the crowd again in the upstairs dining area then make your way down a hallway to your final destination that, hopefully, isn't occupied. Service is nothing short of friendly & attentive - exactly what you would expect in a city like Chicago. Waitstaff wear black pants, white button down shirts with a clean white apron - all of them are clean cut and presentable. The waiter for our little room area (Brian?) overheard a couple at their table wishing each other a happy anniversary. A few minutes later a little fancy piece of cake showed up with a candle in it and he said 'happy anniversary' and that the cake was compliments of him. Very classy. White table cloths on the tables, monster knives to cut your Fred Flintstone size burger or steak.  It can be loud in the bar area (lots of TV to watch the big game) but other areas are quiet and elegant. The crowd ranged from business people to young & older couples dressed nicely. I've only been here in colder months so everyone is dressed nicely. I don't know about warmer months but while there isn't a dress code I would recommend you come here not looking like a slob. If you're going to come here you really need to make reservations - it's not uncommon to wait up to an hour for a table regardless of the time of day. Again, great place to eat and meet up with friends, spectacular food - just don't be shocked with the bill comes.  Go Packers.",0.9985,0.767,0.199,0.034,0.549951058201058

2011-11-17,3.0,"I was in Chicago for business and came here for a business dinner. Sorry, I wasn't impressed. Before I go any further, let me say that the service was great: friendly, personable, suggestive, helpful... everything a server should be. Nothing but good things to say about our server, although I forget his name. I wish I could remember it so I could give him the props he deserves. I have a problem with the food, menu, and pricing. Not really sure how to explain other than to lay it out: Ditka's calls out their USDA prime steaks in a small box on the menu. That's great. You know those are prime cuts and you can order them if you want. Immediately to the left of that box are his ""signature cuts"". Call them what you will, but they are not prime cuts so one is to assume they are USDA choice cuts. Fine. But to charge $39 for a choice ribeye isn't cool. I can get that same steak at Outback Steakhouse for $29 (more or less) and it comes with all of the sides. Before you blast me, let me say that I completely understand that both of those establishments are very different and menu pricing reflects everything that goes into a restaurant: rent, utilities, local market, cost of goods, wages, etc. But to charge $39 for a choice a-la-carte' steak is a bit ridiculous. I would bet the proprietors know it too because they call those their ""signature cuts"". If they called them ""USDA Choice"", something that everyone knows and understands, you can bet people would be a bit pissed. OK... so enough of my soapbox spiel. As you might guess, I DID order the $39 ribeye and it tasted like a $20 steak. On top of that I had the creamed spinach and it was nowhere near the creamed spinach that other places serve. Where was the cream and the butter and everything else that makes healthful spinach into the totally yummy train wreck of a vegetable that I was looking for? This was honestly way too lean and way to healthy and way too bland to be a top-notch steakhouse side order. Sorry. So, where does that leave us? As much as I hate to, I really should give this place 2 stars because it signifies 'meh, I've experienced better' and I have at just about every other high end steakhouse I've eaten at.

The food and service were top notch in addition to Mike Ditka actually being in the restaurant over seeing things personally. The staff were super nice and friendly. Our table actually had a 2 waiters who were beyond on top of everything, but did it in a way that was not overbearing. The restaurant had tons of sports pictures and memorabilia. It was from every sport though which was interesting and also not only Chicago teams. For drinks they had a good selection of beers, wines and cocktails. The beer selection was good, but didn't focus on local breweries as much as I would have hoped. Less than half of the draft selections were locals, but the ones they carried were very good. So I know this place is a steakhouse first and foremost, but I ended up going with the pork chop. It was definitely a good decision. Unlike the steaks it did come with sides so there was no need for me to order from that list. The pork chop was bone in and very large. It was cooked perfectly and the cherry jus on it was great. I also realy enjoyed the apple chutney and sweet potatoes it came with. It was among the best pork chops I've ever had.",0.9961,0.751,0.238,0.012,0.5265681444991789

My wife is a big-time meat eater and made quick work of the nearly full pound NY strip she ordered.  She even ate the fat--which is saying something because I don't think I've ever seen her do that with other steaks.  In fact, she said it was one of the best steaks she had ever eaten--and this is a lady that knows beef! The ribeye I got was juicy, flavorful and cooked just right.  They even wrapped up the bone for me so I could take it home to my dog to naw on--he was a big fan of Ditka's, too! They have an extensive drink list including some excellent scotches and bourbons.  Always a nice touch.  And their house red (Ditka's Ass Kicking Red) is one of the best wines I've had--full bodied, flavorful and an almost velvety texture with a very pleasant aftertaste.  Definitely pairs well with their steaks. In short, I'd definitely go back again and try their other fare, such as the pork chop and the burger.  If Ditka's does the burger right, they would become one of my personal favorite all-around restaurants, easily.",0.9968,0.79,0.193,0.016,0.5175694919115973

So here's my thing...I thought of this as a 5 star place until yesterday.  The first time I went we didn't have a reservation but walked in and had a party of 6 sat around 10:30.  We had excellent service, got several bloodies with the beer chasers, and had awesome food.  So yesterday we were heading out to Ditka's for a friend's birthday.  It's not her fault her bday is on Father's Day!  We did make a reservation for four at 11am.  There was nothing on the website about a Father's Day brunch, nor any signs in the restaurant.  We arrived right on time at 11 and went up to the hostess desk and she said they'd take care of me upstairs.  Strange.  So we go up there and notice it's a buffet.  We had gone on the website as this was a place my friend really wanted to go as she hadn't been before to look at the menu.  We were upset to find out it was a brunch, but hey, we were already there.  We ordered the bloodies right away, which came without a beer chaser and were not nearly as good as the last time I was there (as I suppose I would expect during a buffet).  I thought perhaps they weren't doing the chaser that day but every other table was getting theirs, so it was just the principle that they didn't give us one.  We then asked if we could order off of the regular menu and the waiter said there might be a few things available but he'd have to check with the chef.  Ok.  Strangely the table next to us (who had a different server) got menus handed to them.  Whatev, so we decide to go check out the buffet.  When I saw there was prime rib, I immediately got nervous.  I was planning on getting the $9 Coach's Choice or whatever it was called and clearly my budget for brunch was going to need to expand.  Nothing they had in the buffet was very good, other than the rosemary potatoes, which were awesome.  The prime rib was better than I'd expect from a buffet, but then again I wouldn't get prime rib from a buffet intentionally.  Everything else was just blah (except the cheesecake, which was great).  So when we get back to our table and our server kept walking by but didn't stop, I thought perhaps we should ask the amount of this buffet.  Wait for it...$42 a person!  Are you kidding me?  Look at the other places around there with bottomless bloodies or mimosas that are only $25.  $42 and it didn't include drinks?  Perhaps I wouldn't be so mad if anyone had told us this up front as we clearly weren't there for Father's Day and had no desire to do the brunch.  So we then found out from overhearing another table that the regular menu was downstairs and brunch was upstairs.  So then why when we arrived (two couples without children or their parents there for Father's Day) automatically shuffled upstairs?  Had they said would you prefer the buffet or regular menu we definitely would've said regular menu.  Even if there was a sign (which is customary) or something on the website advertising the said brunch buffet and what was included and the price.  But we really felt we were treated poorly all over the board.  Perhaps if I was there specifically for the buffet, I wouldn't be so angry but my Dad is in heaven and we have no children so I definitely was just there to show my friend how great the breakfast there was and looked like an ass because it sucked.  $279 bill for 4 people unexpectedly is very annoying, particularly because not one person treated us respectfully.  So I'm averaging my first visit 5 star with my second visit 1 star to give it a 3.  Although not sure I'll be going back any time soon to bring that up or down.  Next time you have an event like that Ditka's, advertise it!  It's pretty standard.  Also don't treat the table with the 30 year olds and no children differently from the other tables.  We make as much money as everyone in there or more and now you're not getting our 20-25% tip!  Finally, if you refuse to advertise things such as this, simply have the hostesses advise people when they arrive, particularly if they  made the reservation on OpenTable and clearly weren't aware of the buffet.  When I found out we could've sat downstairs and had our regular experience I was furious!",0.989,0.811,0.113,0.076,0.4428494098494097

It came with burgundy mushrooms which were amazing.  My BF had the tenderloin medallions and he likes them a lot and the other person in our party had the dinner portion of crab cakes and said that they were VERY meaty and good, but she thought that one was almost enough (however, she eats like a bird so take that with a grain of salt).  The thing that I had such a hard time with was the bottle of wine that I know is normally no more than $18 in the store was $50 - YIKES!  I know it's downtown but that was a shocker so just be aware of that when you go.  I suggest checking their menu out online before you go.  It's going to be an expensive meal but if you go with some red meat (or the chops I hear) you won't be disappointed.

We decided to sit in the bar area as it seemed more lively. Our booth seat was facing the bar and TVs so it was a great spot for us. We also wanted to take our time so we made our waiter well aware of that and he definitely did a great job in giving us our space as well as taking care of our drink orders.  And now, the reviews... Starter- Shrimp cocktail: Pretty good. Really fresh tasting. Nice presentation. Bread basket: Nice assortment of small breads. The onion one was by far the tastiest. It also came with nice soft butter. Yum! Main- Full Back Size Filet Mignon: Very tasty. My hubby had it cooked Medium and it was very good. The meat was well seasoned and nicely cooked.  Da Pork Chop: The very best! It's a great thick cut of meat on top of sweet mashed potatoes with a cherry jus. OMG! The best pork chop I've ever had! The meat was tender, juicy, again well seasoned. It went perfectly with the sweet potato mash and cherry jus. Thank you Aaron for the recommendation! Side- Twice cooked back potato: Huge! It was loaded with cheese, bacon, sour cream. The works! What's not to like?! Dessert- Banana Cream Pie: Award winning! Literally! So good! The filling was thick and creamy. The graham cracker crust was thick and buttery.

The second time we came here our waiter said that the chefs told him that they can accommodate our food allergy. BUT come to find out the chefs could not accommodate our food allergies that night due to them using the fryer that they use for the buffalo wings for shrimp that day. Good that they are knowledgeable about the cross contamination, but the problem was that they did not tell us that until the plate of buffalo wings had been served to our table. The waiter told us right before the person with the allergies took a bite. It doesn't get any closer than that. It is hard to only give this restaurant 3 stars because they are good, but it is stressful to eat out when someone in the party has anaphylactic food allergies which could result in death and for the restaurant to fluctuate from night to night with what you can eat, especially when it is the same product that you had before.

Someone at my table ordered an extra - as if it was even slightly necessary - meatloaf.  Three slices of thick meatloaf, served over jalapeno cornbread and topped with mashed potatos and thin fried onion rings.  This dish rocks!  It is a 5 pounds and a heart attack on a plate, and I do not typically enjoy meatloaf, but Ditka's meatloaf is delish!

This burger knew that it was the main event, and was more then up to the challenge. They have several variety's, I believe I got the classic Ditka's burger and it was super yummy. The fries are great hot, but once they start to cool down, they're not as good. 3. The servers are great. I went in right before my flight on a Monday afternoon, and the place was dead. My server was still extremely chatty, and recommended several dishes and, yes, flirted up a storm. Speaking as a former server myself, it's really easy to let the sleepy Monday business make you sleepy and not as peppy as you should be.  I really appreciated the extra effort he took.

2008-12-23,2.0,"It breaks my Coach-loving heart that I was so disappointed in this place.  We arrived in time for our ""Game Table"" reservation, dressed top to bottom in Bears gear and were promptly escorted to a table in the dining room... Um, seriously? How could the guy have looked at us in our hats, jeans, and Bears gear just before kickoff of the Bear v. Packer  game and thought that our reservation could have possibly been in the TV-less formal dining room. We told them we had reserved a game table and they kind of himmed and hawwed but eventually found us a table. Annoooooying. You don't call weeks in advance and make a reservation for a game table in the bar to have them give you a hard time when you say you expect to sit at a game table in the bar. Our server, while he eventually warmed up to us, was a tad edgy at first. My friend's beer was served in a glass with a huge crack and chip in it. The onion rings were soggy and under cooked. We sent them back and they sent us back a new, better batch and said that they were on the house. Too bad they appeared on the bill.  My fillet medallions arrived. Mediocre, at best. For $27 for 3 silver-dollar sized medallions, I expected them to be at least above average and probably along the lines of Wildfire or better. Not so. Someone tell Da Coach that my mom has cooked better fillets from Da Jewels in her sleep. The horsradish/bluecheese/pepper ""crusts"" were just lumped on top and were just barely ok. They fell very short. This made me very sad.  It was freezing cold. I know it was like 6 degrees outside, but Jaysus, it was cold at our table. The coat check girl's teeth were chattering. No good.

We could not leave Chicago without having the sought after lamb chops so we went back the next day after the wait time at our first option was unacceptable for our stomachs.  The second time around was perfect.  Jim was our waiter and he was excellent.  He made the restaurant experience a very pleasant one.  He had personality which made it a more relaxing time especially after endless blocks of walks.   This time we ordered the lamb chops.  Yummy for the tummy.  We had the salad again and Italian wedding soup.  All in the yummy for my tummy category.  The lamb chops shared the plate with asparagus and spinach with sauteed mushrooms.  We shared the lamb shops as they serve incredible portions.   Being from San Diego, we have some historic athletes, Tony Gwynn, Phil Mickelson, Trevor Hoffman, but only Junior Seau has a restaurant.  Seau's restaurant get 1.5 stars just because it is an accessible place, but falls flat on it's face next to Dikta's.  Some Chicago locals might think that I am too generous on my Dikta's rating, but San Diego has yet to pull it's weight on athlete owned restaurants.

I somehow left smelling like smoke even though we were in the non-smoking section.  Unimpressed. I hope the $41 steaks are better.",0.9371,0.766,0.206,0.028,0.48095238095238096

The bottom line is,  I dig Ditka's.  Sure it's a little over-priced and Mike Ditka has the LAMEST voice over bit when you call and the hostess puts you on hold (Try it -you'll laugh).  Let's not be picky -  the food is GOOD.  I have had steak here and even schlepped over for Ditka's traditional Thanksgiving dinner.  Yeah, that's what I said T-day at Ditka's with the fam.  Everything was spot-on delicious and the service could not have been better. I was shocked at how PACKED it was (thinking I was the only cheesy goof dragging my parents to Ditka's.  Technically it was turkey and football, right?)  There WERE more drunk botoxed-up women present than on an episode of The Real Women of Orange County but I got over it.   I will go back to The Coach's place.  He may smoke stinky cigars and rip me off a little, but as a restaurateur, he knows how to work it.",-0.2754,0.882,0.064,0.054,0.559700176366843
