The sushi was not fresh or prepared well. The crab was the toughest I have ever eaten. And for the price of this establishment that was very unexpected. I have had better sushi from a grocery store. When concerns were brought to the manager he did not address our needs. Overall this was a terrible experience and we did not order more than two sushi plates as they were awful and had to attend dinner following elsewhere.

I always try to find crazy bloody mary offerrings for my instagram post :D (@karkifoodie) It did not just look great but the food that came on it was amazing. The duck bao was crispy and tasty. The pork belly was juicy. Grilled cheese, yes it was on it, was decent. Shisito peppers was flavorful. Spring rolls were crunchy. Even had a crab roll sushi. And most importantly the bacon, it completed this bloody mary. All this on a 32 oz bloody mary, which had good amount of alcohol and flavorful, will set you back $40. Also had their most expensive fried rice, at $28 you get chicken, shrimp as well as lobster. The portion is not huge for the cost but it makes up with the taste. It is flavorful.

The crazy rice had decent portions of seafood but the rice was not good at all. It was overpowered with fish sauce and soggy.  We also got the Brussels sprouts which were good but overdressed with the sauce they pour on top at the table.

Our server was great - friendly, responsive. Checked in regularly and made sure everyone's wine glasses were full. The food was plentiful and delicious. I especially liked the tiger shrimp tempura, oxtail pot stickers and adobo braised pork belly. The mushroom & asparagus salad was good, but salty. Surprisingly, the one clunker was the unexpected slice of birthday cake they brought me - it was really dry and not very good. But since it was a surprise, I can't complain too much.  Would definitely recommend this place for groups. It was a bit loud, but we could still hear each other and I wanted that kind of bustling vibe for my party.

2017-08-21,5.0,"I've been here a few times over the past couple of years and every time has been a great dining experience. The staff is very attentive and great at giving suggestions how much to order for your group size. The only downside I've come across is that, like all popular restaurants, it is pretty noisy. If you've come with a large group, my advice is to sit next to the people you like best because you probably won't be able to hear anyone else at your table. You must try the crispy brussels sprouts salad. I never even knew I liked brussels sprouts until I had this salad. It's crispy, a little bit spicy, and the perfect dish to start your meal. I also highly recommend the oxtail pot stickers, which are basically Asian comfort food. Feeling sad? Eat those. Feeling happy? Make it two orders to celebrate.  If you love corn on the cob, definitely get the grilled street corn and pretend like it's for the whole table as you secretly eat the entire plate yourself. The sushi is all really good. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but I would recommend The Great White. It's nigiri with a potato chip on it.

If you love ox tails then you will also love these unique pot stickers! The ox tail meat was seasoned perfectly.  The crazy rice was seasoned will with a blend of spice that gave a nice kick and included a hearty portion of meats. The roll was so good with a mix of flavors hitting your taste buds!  The ONLY reasons I did not give 5 stars were because the dishes came out too spaced apart and the tight squeeze between the tables and the aisle.  The two appetizers came out 5min apart and although that is not normally a big thing, but our entrees had the same issue...so I sat and waited for my food, at least 5min, after the first entree was delivered.  One positive is the food was piping hot, ijs, who wants to sit and wait.  In addition, our table was in a tight spot so the waiters and staff had to squeeze though the aisle.

There are various party sizes, but we appeared to be in the section catered to group sizes of 8-10 people. I ordered the lychee cocktail, which is $15 (typical River North cocktail price). It comes in a martini glass and has a piece of lychee fruit in it (canned lychee, but fresh lychee would have been nice). The cocktail was refreshing and not too sweet.

Next up were the oxtail potstickers. Good, but nothing noteworthy. We also ordered the street corn (skip this) and the lemongrass beef lollipops (YUM!)

Highlights included the Peared Sake cocktail and the ginger carrot cake encased ice cream dessert. The peared sake cocktail came with a cinnamon rimmed glass which paired perfectly with the creamy flavor in the drink; I could live on these. The street corn, buns, and brussle sprout salad were all favorites of ours. Neither of us cared for the Sunda Crepes. The shrimp was overcooked so it was tough and rubbery to the point where we didn't eat the dish. The only other improvement that could have been made was that our waitress was pretty slow and inattentive. She made us wait nearly 40 minutes after our first drinks and appetizer were served before coming back to take the rest of our order.

The menu is best characterized as Asian Fusion for sure - I see Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Malay, and Filipino influences in the dishes.  Dishes are meant to be shared, so 3-5 dishes per couple.  The menu is creative and we did get some solid sushi rolls.  The hot entrees were good, but very heavily seasoned and intensely flavored.  You almost have to down more alcohol!  We ordered: * Sweet Potato Caterpillar Roll: Interesting vegetarian roll with sweet potato and asian pear replacing the crab meat.  The gochujang sauce was a nice touch.  This roll would be awesome if the rice was a tad bit warmer (3 stars). * Crunchy Pig, Hidden Lobster: My favorite dish. Fried bacon on sushi?  Heck yeah.  (4 stars) * Crazy Rice: This is a fried rice dish with lots going on - fried egg mixed in with lobster, tiger prawns, and chicken.  Rice was heavily seasoned and chicken was dry, but the seafood items were good (3 stars) * Sea Bass: Fish was perfectly cooked - juicy and super soft on the inside, but man that outer crust was salty.  The salad was inedible since it was overloaded with miso vinegar dressing.  Coconut-curry ground cauliflower was good (3 stars) * Jackfruit Creme Brûlée: Simple and good.  Basic creme brûlée topped with fresh berries and thin strips of Jackfruit, which to me tastes like a mango-pineapple hybrid. Overall a nice, trendy restaurant for drinks and maybe to share some creative sushi rolls.  Hot entrees seem heavily seasoned, so watch out.",0.9977,0.738,0.253,0.009,0.5745317460317463

Quite spicy but good flavor! The wine was great, and okay priced. Brussel sprout salad as others have mentioned is great- definitely for sharing though.  The bad: The place as others have said is poorly lit and very noisy. I can't imagine the noise level on a Friday or Saturday night. Our server was very attentive at the beginning (before our whole party arrived) but by the time we were mid dinner service she was kinda of MIA. I had the chicken pad thai (which I couldn't order spicy?) which was just okay. Too many shallots and not enough noodles or chicken, especially for $17. My friend was largely unimpressed with the sushi for the price. With SO MANY sushi options (not to mention unlimited sushi) in Chicago, I wouldn't come here again.

The yellowtail jalapeño dish tasted like bacteria. I immediately asked to send the dish back. Pretty much lost my appetite after that. I also ordered the salmon and tuna nigiri and the hamachi tartare, which I barley finished because of how repulsed I was from the old yellowtail. On top of the food being gross, the service was terribly mediocre, especially considering the price of the dishes.

Food:  Tuna Nigiri - very good, a nicely cut piece of fish Tiger Shrimp Tempura - ordered this at the recommendation of the server, it could have had more flavor or more sauce on it but it was still good, nice and crispy. Garlic Crab Noodles - Wow this was delicious, very rich. Unfortunately there was some shell (or other crunchy foreign material) in mine which made for an unpleasant chew, but otherwise this was great.  Lobster and Wagyu Roll - This was my favorite of the night.   Duck Buns - Ideally there would be more filling and less bun, one of the four buns only had one tiny piece of duck on it.

I have listed the items in order of preference.  Duck steamed buns: life-changing. The duck is very tender and the bun has an excellent pillowy texture. It is all complemented perfectly by the hoisin.  Beef lollipops: very tender and the glaze is delicious. Definitely don't ignore the sauce they come with. 100% better with it.  Drunken noodles: the noodles are cooked perfectly. They're a flat noodle with a nice thickness. The sauce is wonderful and the shrimp were cooked to perfection and really took on the flavor of the sauce. However, the beef (which was a large part of the dish - there were only 4 medium shrimp) had absolutely no flavor at all. Very bland, cooked medium to medium-well. Disappointing.  Panang chicken: curry is mild but had a nice balance of flavors. Chicken is served with the skin on.

The host was friendly-ish, but a bit of an attitude when asking some questions about leaving/wait time. The food was ok and served quick, but overpriced for what it was. My favorite was the spicy kracken, the lobster and waygu was nothing special, it lacked flavors that stood out, and the crazy rice was decently packed with goodies (lobster, shrimp and chicken was all great portions for the bowl size) but lacking some flavor. Overall, I'd give it another shot, but with a reservation and a larger group to be able to try more options as it's more of a tapas style Asian fusion.",0.8551,0.864,0.096,0.04,0.5288139329805996

I made my sad reservation for 1 via OpenTable for 5:15 PM (benefits of still being on EST = pick of reservation times).  I was seated immediately upon entering, and took in the overall vibe of Sunda, which is absolutely gorgeous. Super modern, with gorgeous touches of Asian artwork and artifacts on the walls and near entrances. There are long tables near the sushi counter, as well as a variety of hightops and regular dining tables, so there is literally a spot for groups of all sizes (even non-groups of one, like me).  I began as any meal should - with a cocktail. As soon as I saw that Sunda had an Old Fashioned, I immediately ordered it. It was delicious, had zero maraschino cherries in it, and was perfectly blended.  When my friend told me about Sunda, she immediately said the Crispy Brussels Sprouts salad was to die for. As a pescetarian (fish, no meat),I rarely get to enjoy Brussels sprouts, so I was extra excited to try this salad (Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, chilies, and a vinaigrette with shrimp/clam). I also ordered the Sunrise sushi roll (spicy salmon, lobster, avocado, tobiko, and spicy wasabi aioli).  The salad lived up to every expectation. Even non salad lovers would die over the crispy Brussels sprouts. It was so unique, but everything worked so beautifully together. It was also huge - meant to be shared... and I put down almost the whole thing.  The Sunrise roll came out when I finished up with the majority of my salad. The sushi was beautifully prepared, fresh, and delicious. It was the perfect complement to my salad (as was the second Old Fashioned that I ordered).  Sunda was wonderful, even for dining solo - I will definitely return here during future trips to Chicago. Meanwhile, that Crispy Brussels Sprouts salad will remain in my dreams.",0.9959,0.779,0.192,0.028,0.575984200984201

2017-04-29,5.0,"Order consisted of:  Street Corn Tiger Shrimp Tempura Pork Belly Steam Bun Oxtail Potstickers Crispy Brussel Sprout Salad Seafood Longevity Noodles The Gambler Mochi One of the greatest dining experiences I've ever had. Every single thing was great, from service to food.  Street Corn was really great. I never would expect corn and coconut to be such a great combination but it works wonderfully.  Tiger Shrimp Tempura, I would probably order about 68053884322 more orders of this if I could. It's their version of Walnut Shrimp (if you read any of my other reviews you know how much I love this). It was by far the best one I've ever had. PorkBelly Steam Bun is something I personally always get whenever I have the opportunity, I've never had one that was mind blowing, but the one at Sunda is a different story. THIS is what steam buns are suppose to taste like. Oxtail Potstickers were amazing. They were so juicy and tender. They had this sort of short rib flavor to them.  Crispy Brussel Sprout salad was very very good. My group wanted to get another veggie to mix up with the other flavors and this was a great choice. The chillies in it are perfect. Seafood Longevity Noodles are very similar to Lo Mein. I absolutely love Lo Mein noodles, and these were definitely the holy grail. They also have octopus, perfectly cooked octopus, so just order it. The Gambler is more of a fun thing to order. It has spicy tuna and spicy shrimp and one of the pieces has a ghost pepper in it. I personally thought it was fine flavor wise, everything was definitely very fresh I think I just enjoy more ""meaty"" sushi. Also was my first time having ghost pepper and I found the flavor or the ghost pepper kinda gross but I've never liked things that were overly smoky tasting.  And the Mochi, the mochi was great. My favorite flavor was the jackfruit. If you ever had candied raisins at your grandma's house, it tasted just like that. It was great. There's also a raspberry, which with the chocolate sauce, was good as well.  I usually don't comment too much on service because I feel like I'm an easy person to serve at restaurants, but I have to say that our waiter, Alex, was one of the best I've had. He was extremely informative and honest about everything.  My only real gripe was how loud it was. This was by far one of the loudest places I've ever been in my life. I can't fault the restaurant or take anything from them because they can't control how people are talking but it was incredibly loud. The music was amazing though so I guess it balances out. 5/5 have some self respect and go here immediately",0.9993,0.715,0.258,0.027,0.6260971055088701
2017-04-29,4.0,"Had a lovely dinner here last night! The restaurant itself is very upscale and trendy. Since it was Friday, we were super lucky to get reservations at the last minute on OpenTable for 7:15 p.m.  Wasn't too crowded when we arrived but it definitely got more lively within the hour. The atmosphere is on the louder side, which we didn't really mind but there were a few times where we had to yell to hear one another. Glad we got a 4 person table for the two of us, otherwise with all the food we ordered it would have been a tight fit.  The menu here is extensive. Great selection of Asian fusion dishes and sushi. You'll probably be able to find a dish for everyone. Our server recommended starting with 2-3 dishes from the salad/hot section and then go from there so that's what we did. What we ordered: - Crispy brussel sprouts: based off all the yelp reviews, I knew that this dish was a must. And I loved it! Shared it with my bf, and I probably ate about 3/4 of it. Sorry not sorry. The jalapeño was a great touch but lacked the minced shrimp. - Lemongrass beef lollipops: pretty good but not anything extraordinary. Very unique presentation (sliced strip steak wrapped around lemongrass). However, it could use more of the lemongrass flavor. Couldn't really taste it. - Sunrise roll: Yum! Spicy salmon, lobster, avocado, cucumber, tobiko with a wasabi aoli, how can you go wrong?  - The gambler roll: 6 piece futomaki, that has spicy tuna & shrimp, avocado, cucumber in the center, topped with sambal and scallions. The catch? One of the rolls has a hidden ghost pepper. Even though it wasn't the best sushi, my boyfriend and I had a fun time with this one. I ended up getting the ""lucky"" piece and it's pretty damn spicy. You also get a token for a free dessert for your next visit. - Adobo braised pork belly: so by the time this dish came out we were already super full but since I have no self control, I ended up having a piece anyways. The meat was so tender and it's quite a big portion as well, took the rest home. Great interpretation of the classic Filipino dish. They also have a happy hour every weekday from 3:30 to 6:30 with dim sum and specialty cocktails & other drinks, so I'll have to check that out next time!",0.997,0.772,0.186,0.042,0.5271329365079366

Mimosa kit: this is really good! You can mix your own juices or just order individual mimosas. Perfectly tart, lightly fizzy and available in a lot of flavors. Garlic crab noodles: I wanted to love this but didn't. The noodles were a bit dry and I wasn't really tasting any garlic. The dish had some bits of crab in it but overall just felt like a carb fest with no real zing to it.  Chicken scramble: I didn't order this but my dining companion seemed happy enough.

2017-04-17,3.0,"The place is beautiful. The sushi program needs work.  The Crispy Rice dish is a winner at places like Katsua and other sushi joints around the country.  Here, for some odd reason, they pre make the quenelles of tuna way in advance. As a result, they are pasty, flavorless, and setup. They're even a little dry...like a skin formed around them.  ALL of the nigiri sushi pieces are pre-sliced before service. (See my pic) As a result, the fish is a little dry and tired by the time it reaches you. More sliced surface area means it dries in the hours before it is used. And one can only assume that what doesn't get used is served the next day.  The fruit and veg garnishes like jalapeño slices and limes are also done in advance, so they are all dried out. I squeezed a lime wedge into my Pho and no juice came out! The Pho itself had great flavor. But it definitely does not need a whole bone marrow bone, plus two vertebrae of oxtail. All of which were delicious. But I had to spend at least 5 minutes pulling out the bone marrow, and picking the meat from the oxtail before I could enjoy it. Plus then I had a plate of huge bones next to me the whole time (no one bussed it up). But the flavor of the broth was deep and rich.  None of the above is excusable for a place that serves sushi. Any proper sushi chef would walk right out. This is especially egregious with a superior place (Roka) literally across the street.",0.984,0.842,0.132,0.025,0.5429894179894181

2017-04-17,3.0,"After the Saint Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, I was so famished! We arrived to Sunda around 2:30PM Saturday, and it wasn't that crowded. (Kitchen closes at 3 and prepares for dinner weekends.) The hostess is straight ahead with plenty of dining tables throughout the restaurant. Tables are spaced apart, which is always a plus for conversations. We still had reservations though. Sunda is trendy and modern with a cozy, dark atmosphere. It is a well known restaurant with a mix of Southeastern and Eastern Asian cuisine. FOOD: Firecracker (2/5, Tempura spicy tuna, nori, avocado dynamite sauce, and unagi sauce): I wasn't that big of a fan of the tempura spicy tuna. There was just too much going on, and I didn't think the avocado dynamite sauce paired well with the tempura. Spicy Kraken (3/5, Braised octopus, spicy shrimp, tobiko, jalapeno, kaiware, scallions, rayu aioli, unagi sauce): This was my third favorite of the night. The octopus and scallions definitely stood out. Everything paired well but just decent for me. Crunchy Pig & Hidden Lobster (4/5, Soy paper, lobster, avocado, jalapeno, sweet chili sauce, tempura crisps, and bacon): Texture wise, it is strange. But the taste is just on another level with its interesting flavors. This was actually my favorite of the night, but I did take some of the bacon bites off.  Baked Snow Crab Handroll (4/5, Alaskan snow crab, dynamite sauce, tempura crisps, soy paper, and sesame seeds): Simple and tasty. The dynamite sauce in this is what made the roll so good. I recommend this if you're not sure what to order. Maguro (3/5): Tuna. 4 pieces. Just okay, I've had better. Hamachi (3/5): Yellowtail. 4 pieces. Just okay, I've had better. Unagi (5/5): Freshwater eel. 4 pieces. This was the best out of the three we selected. I ate 2 out of the 4 pieces. I loved them! Service was great. Our server was friendly and attentive. He came around our table a few times to inform the kitchen was closing less than 20 minutes. We were still deciding, so he also gave some recommendations. Water and drink refills were on point.

2017-04-06,1.0,"Sunda is probably among the most insensitive and difficult restaurants for clients who need to know what they are actually eating.  Unfortunately when I eat foods with a fair amount of gluten, I get sick.  While the full menu is extensive and tempting, the gluten-free menu is skimpy and short on details (not even bothering to translate the nigiri names from Japanese as they do on the regular menu).  Surprisingly, most dishes at Sunda contain gluten, which is unusual for Asian cuisine. At most Asian restaurants, soy sauce can be (and usually is) served on the side. The social aspect of ordering at Sunda is fraught with problems.  The restaurant pushes family style eating with small plates meant to be shared communally.  Yet, it is almost impossible to tell visually, or from the menu, what exactly is in any given dish.  Why not use the labels VG, VN and GF directly on the main menu to at least help? Not wanting to impose on my friends, I told them to order whatever they wanted.  I would get something that I could eat and I would eat alone. Frustration ensued.  I waited a full 30 minutes after my friends finished before the restaurant deigned to bring a single thing I could eat.  Even though I spoke with them directly about having to order separately, the servers made zero effort whatsoever to make sure that everyone had at least something to eat, and I was basically the kid sitting alone at the lunch table with a blank stare while my friends had to choke down their own feelings of guilt.  The kitchen and staff's callous indifference and slow service stretched out our dinner for an extra hour of awkwardness. The chef has responsibility for the content of the menu and needs to take a closer look at how the menu affects customers with food sensitivities.  It is not hard to design a menu (especially of Asian inspired dishes) which has broad appeal.   If you are going to promise a dinner that is supposed to be shared, kindly make sure that the food actually can be shared.",0.6746,0.81,0.101,0.089,0.42148853130995995

2017-03-31,4.0,"Sunda was a really hip place when it opened 7 or 8 years ago, and I recently went back.  I'm impressed that it has shown some staying power and they are still serving solid asian food. The menu is expansive, but I have always steered more to the sushi side of things at this restaurant.  The standouts here the Spicy Tail of Two Tunas and the Crunchy Pig, Hidden Lobster.  Both of these rolls are very good.   But the thing you have to order is the Crispy Rice. both the spicy tuna and wagyu versions are worth ordering and you will be happy if you do!",0.9364,0.862,0.138,0.0,0.38757575757575763

2017-03-30,5.0,"First off I'm going to say Sunda has been my favorite restaurant in Chicago since I first went to it over 2 years ago. The staff is always friendly and very friendly and attentive whenever I dine here. However, The food is the real star of this restaurant. Almost every dish is great, made with fresh ingredients and seasoned well. From visiting several times my top dishes would be: Crispy Brussels Sprout 5/5: Definitely a must have. It is crisp, delicious and GREAT. the price is on the higher end however the portion is enough for 2-4 people. Pork Belly Bao Buns 4.5/5: comes with 4 fluffy steaming hot bao buns filled tender pork belly. The sauce is delicious and the price is pretty reasonable for the portion. Adobo Pork Fried Rice 5/5: Something about a rice bowl with an egg on top just is perfection. This dish is extremely filling and oozes comfort with the salty pork, rice and over easy egg mixed in. The other dishes I have tried are: edamame 3.5/5: just your basic steamed edamame various sushi rolls 4/5: overall decent rolls. I personally don't find them amazing just very fresh and well made. Lemongrass Beef Lollipops 4/5:  delicious however you need to be in a beef eating mood since it isn't the cheapest appetizer. The meat is wrapped around lemongrass sticks which is pretty fun to nibble off. The flavors are good and you get several sticks to share (or not). Tiger Shrimp Tempura 4/5: Really sweet and rich. The tempura is fluffy and crisp which makes this dish pretty good. However same as the beef lollipops it isn't the cheapest so if you're in the mood for something a little fried and sweet order this. Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice 4/5: fairly simple however the flavors all work together to bring out the freshness in the tuna. A nice dish to get after eating something really fatty. Firecracker 2.5/5 : really the only thing I've tried that I'm not a fan of. It has a lot going on and personally I rather order something else. Mango/Pomegranate Iced Teas 4/5: Personally I love the mango one more but they are both good. The Iced teas come in a cool setup where you get the flavor concentrate and regular iced tea. Therefore you choose how sweet you want your drink to be!. Generally they refill the iced tea for free but I don't think you can get more of the syrup. Btw you can make 2-3 full glasses of Iced tea with the syrup. The drink is a little pricey for what it is, but overall something I would recommend to try at least once. Desserts 4/5 : The desserts here are pretty good, I have to say they all are great but my favorite would be the seasonal cobblers. The fact they change the fruit adds a good mix to the flavors you expect to get. Overall Great Place to grab a couple drinks and appetizer or have a nice dinner out!",0.9984,0.785,0.209,0.006,0.562936742744435

Had a chance to return to Chicago and visit Sunda again. This time with a party of 7 and we all left very impressed. The ox tail gyoza and black cod were superb and all through the evening, the wine was all we picked out as we left the cuisine ordering to our very knowledgeable waitress who did a superb job recommending dishes for us to try and keeping the tapas style plates coming.

2017-03-20,4.0,"A friend and I came here for our last dinner in Chicago, and it certainly did not disappoint. This place is HUGE and seats a lot of people, but it's relatively loud and dark inside. Probably not the best place to go for an intimate date.  The cocktail menu here is amazing. I got the Strawberry Fields, which was perfectly fruity and sweet. They also have real pieces of strawberry pulp floating in the cocktail! It gave the drink a nice texture.  We ordered the Oxtail pot stickers to start. The filling was very good, but the skin was a bit thick for my liking. It felt too dough-y after a few bites. The garlic crab noodles were also really good the first few bites, but then it started to taste too salty. Could've done without it, and I regret not ordering the Crazy Rice because that's supposed to be the most popular noodle/rice dish. The real highlight of Sunda is actually the Signature Crispy Rice though. I've never had pan-fried sushi rice before but it was actually really good! We got the seafood dynamite and the spicy tuna. The rice gave it a nice kick and complimented the toppings nicely.  Overall, I'd highly recommend the cocktails and sushi here. There's a huge sushi bar near the front of the restaurant and the fish all tasted really fresh.",0.9972,0.7,0.284,0.016,0.550547619047619
2017-03-19,2.0,"Very disappointed in Sunda this time. When visiting Chicago, this has been a go to restaurant with local friends, but surprised how the service and food has gone downhill. Last time we ate here, it  was packed (as usual) and the food was better than average. This trip, a Sunday night at 7:00, no wait, and I even joked with the hostess where was everyone and she just smiled. Now I know why, the waiter forgot to put in the appetizer (brussels sprouts, the best dish we had) so this showed up 1/2 way through dinner. Tuna was mush, and since we were still hungry,  had to order Pad Thai. This dish was so bland, and the waiter explained that ""it is more authentic"", more authentic than what? A frozen dinner? This I would rate a 2/10. The Waiter, Russel, forget to bring beverages and was too busy waiting on a table of 10 to care about any of his other tables. Sorry Sunda, we are done with you and will not be returning. Too many other great choices in the area. Your downward spiral is quite evident.",0.9804,0.804,0.154,0.042,0.4988095238095238

It's usually spilling over with seafood ingredients however the shrimp are no longer ""tiger shrimp"" which resembled prawns on prior visits but now are more akin to popcorn shrimp & I literally found 1 morsel of lobster. I can remember past visits for this very dish. The first time I thought it was ingenious to contrast the spice with the cucumbers. The shrimp were some of the biggest I've ever encountered.  When I asked the waitress when the dish changed she gave some bulls*it speech about how apparently its always been served this way.

Would return, but would not be my first choice considering all the great nearby options.  Food:  Crispy tuna, didn't feel the tuna was great quality and was on a damp square of rice. Brussel sprout salad-yum!- nice crispy shredded Brussel sprouts- order this!  Pork buns- best dish I had, pork had great flavor and the buns were nice and soft.  Pork bulgogi- ordered this expecting... bulgogi. What was brought was 4 strips of bacon with a fried egg accompanied by lettuce cups. This dish was confusing and sent back to the kitchen (thank you to our patient waitress).  Seoul chicken wings, average- wing and thigh were connected and made for a messy dish (we were warned..). Despite the sliced chiles topping the dish, overall lacked some heat.  Duck fried rice, would recommend- duck was tender and had good flavor.  Drink: had the grass tiger- basically a spicy Moscow mile- yum!  Service: really impressed, hostess was very attentive and helped us immediately.

2017-02-04,3.0,"Was really excited to try this place after hearing good things from friends and the of course, the favorable reviews on Yelp. Came on a Saturday for restaurant week brunch. The menu for CRW seemed small and we were both pretty hungry so we decided to go with one CRW menu and then order a few items off the regular menu. Ambiance: Beautiful open space that's cozy at the same time, would love to come back to hang out and get drinks! Service: Our waiter was friendly and laid back, explained the menu and made suggestions. The busboys were on point with the water refills and clearing of the plates. Drinks: got a mango mimosa, was pretty good (good ratio of champagne to juice 3:1) Food: Here is where the stars started falling. From the restaurant week menu, we got:    - chicken tom ka gui soup (did not like, it was just coconut, chicken and vinegar. very tart)   - roast duck and crispy turnip cake salad (this dish had potential to be delicious, however the duck was chewy instead of crispy outside and moist inside. The 3 small cubes of turnip cake is what you'd get at a dim sum place in Chinatown... except it was NOT crispy or hot and kind of just bland overall - not much turnip taste :(   - tuna with spicy octopus, tobiko, scallions (this was just 1 piece of nigiri, fish was fresh but overall nothing to blow your mind over)   - Chicken Afritada-braised chicken with jasmine rice (my Filipino college roommate makes it better. Again, it was very bland.  From the regular menu we got the ramen with pork belly - the noodles were the most disappointing feature, not chewy or curly, and unable to carry the broth. The pork belly was fine and the broth was just ok - not terribly rich but not terribly salty either like in some places. We also got the tocino plate, which I LOVE tocino but this again, was executed poorly. The tocino was cold and lackluster, not sweet or salty. The ""crispy rice"" patty it was on was also not hot and NOT crispy.  Overall, I felt like the restaurant week menu really couldn't fill you up for $22, and the other dishes were just flat tasting and bland.

2017-02-01,1.0,"Lunch at Sunda.   Pork Bulgogi is literally bacon slathered in a combo of bi bim bap sauce with something more distinctively American, tangy bbq sauce.  The bacon is DROWNING in this sauce.  A fried egg with a nice, runny yolk sits atop a filler portion of short grain rice.  The kimchi needed to ferment for at least another week -- barely any heat or flavor.  The miso soup, while pleasantly made with what seemed like real dashi, was unfortunately 'koi' as hell.  A little more kansai style and less kanto would have suited.  The tofu, being medium firm, felt noticeably out of place. Disappointing tofu in an otherwise decent misoshiru.  The spicy tekka maki was a pathetic, amateurish assembly, already falling apart as I went to pick up the pieces.  Absolutely average, everyday American quality sashimi.  And yet, that was my favorite part of the bento.  This was $18 and a sheer disappointment.  I can get better pork bulgogi for far less (and loads of ban chan with it) at any number of great, north side Korean bbqs.  Miso ramen with oxtail and bok choy.  The broth was good, not great.  We wisely chose oxtail which was succulent, tender, and still on the bone.  While sprouts in ramen aren't unheard of, it gave the ramen a strong impression of pho, which I found disappointing.  The egg ought to have been soft boiled but instead was poached. Nitpicky perhaps, but definitely felt like an attempt to be different just for the sake of it versus a real enhancement. But the most unforgivable part of the whole dish was the absolutely bland and overcooked-to-the-point-of-mushy ramen noodles.  They can't possibly be making their own.  I've had better packaged ramen.  At least this only cost $12. I've had better 600 yen ramen all across Japan. Typical downtown, trend setting place catering to people that crave authenticity, don't actually know what it is but sure are willing to empty their wallet NOT to find out.

Crab handroll, the piece of super white with truffle and a little potato chip (heaven!) sea bass.  My friend had never been so we met up after work on a Friday. The people who greet you at the door are awesome. So friendly and helpful. I was an hour early so I sat at the bar and had a really great old fashioned. The woman running the drinks program is amazing. Very knowledgeable, friendly, and hard working! We talked to her about sake. But minus 1 star because they charge $7 for an Amstel Light. This place is spendy! When we wanted to be seated we were met with a stone-faced woman, who I'm hoping was just having a bad day and is not normally like this. Although we talked to our server and she said people in hospitality don't have bad days. Either way, this woman didn't greet us, didn't ask us to follow her, robotically brought us to a table that we didn't care for. Because it was early in the night we thought it reasonable to be asked to sit elsewhere. She pivoted and marched back to the host stand. Didn't say follow her, or sure stay right there while I check. It was confusing and not good. So we were seated in the back in the dark corner which was perfect. It was a good spot to catch up with my friend. Our server, Kimberly, was friendly and fun. We wished we could go have drinks with her. She made recommendations and turned the beat around. We filled ourselves with sushi, and roasted cauliflower. Then we tried the apple cobbler. It was a little dry. They use these crust cubes on top instead of oatmeal crumble. I wouldn't get it again. All in all, still solid! An expensive, but very nice place to have sushi. Definitely hang out at the bar if you can, and get that super white with the truffle. The only other thing I would say is that a lot of the sushi is spicy.

At $16 for 8 small pieces of sushi, we felt as though it wasn't a very good value.

We all ordered cocktails and didn't really love any of ours. The pear sake tasted like soap. My friend barely drank a sip and it sat there the entire 2 hours we were there and our waitress didn't even notice or stop by for us to tell her we didn't like it. The sunda old fashioned was too sweet. My strawberry fields was alright and the lychee luxury drop was also alright. Also they are way over priced, even for city prices.  For food, we asked our waitress if it would be too much food bc none of us were all that hungry and she guaranteed us it wouldn't. Of course we had an entire bag full of leftovers. We started with the bang bang salad, which had a lot happening. Huge portion, but kind of bland in flavor. Seoul wings were huge and delicious. Best part of the meal. The duck buns were underwhelming. The duck was weirdly chewy and the skin was too thick and not crispy at all. Drunken noodles were good. Penang chicken was soooo delicious, but doesn't come with rice?!? It's served in a coconut and had the best presentation out of everything we got. However, it was pretty liquidy and without spoons to eat with or rice to soak it up, we ended up with just curry all over all our plates. Dumb. We couldn't even track our waitress down to ask her for rice.  For dessert we got the green tea doughnuts. One of the worst desserts I've ever had. The doughnuts were hard and cold, without much green tea flavor. The pot de creme was hard and cold. We all ate a bite and left the rest. Again, our waitress didn't notice or care.  Overall, such a horrible experience for such a renowned Chicago restaurant. The food was okay overall, but the service completely ruined it us. When you're paying $50+ per person, you expect to get some sort of attention. Our waitress stopped by maybe 3 times total and we ended up being there for over 2 hours.

I was here for Sunday lunch with three other friends and we ordered the fried dumplings, two sushi rolls, adobo pork and the brussel sprout salad. My favorite item was without a doubt the salad. The sushi rolls were okay, but I have had MUCH better sushi elsewhere so I am seriously wondering why other people gave such high ratings for Sunda's sushi. I was sad because we meant to order the adobo fried rice, but instead we got the adobo pork which was so salty and impossible to enjoy without a full bowl of rice. The proportions (meat:rice) was so ridiculous.  Sunda provides a nice ambiance, I guess, but I would not come back. It is overpriced, service is slow and the food is mediocre.",0.7978,0.784,0.14,0.076,0.6614814814814816

The food is full of flavor and will make your tummy content. Note that the portions are meant for sharing. For dessert we shared the ""Ridiculous"" fried ice cream topped with walnuts and caramel.  DRINKS If you lie sweet drinks, I highly suggest the Blackberry limeade, it is on point  they also have a variety of beers and cocktails to choose from.  MUSIC The music was poppin'! Good food, and good music! My boyfriend hadd to ask what the playlist was, and in case you were wondering its ""Dance Pop"" on Spotify. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.

2016-12-03,5.0,"The service at Sunda from start to finish was an A+. First off, a rant to the 20+ restaurants in Chicago that showed absolutely no interest in hosting our bachelorette party because our group was not willing to spend the steep food and drink minimum for dinner. After contacting 20+ restaurants, Sunda was my saving grace.  The staff was upfront, patient, and helpful in planning dinner for our party of 14. They were clear about the expectations in advance via email. They informed us they could only split a maximum of eight credit cards for our group. Sliced cake for the bride-to-be was an option, but the cake cutting fee would be $3.00 a person. I ordered two desserts from the menu instead. They told us we would be in the main dining area with chairs with no backs. We were fine since we planned on restaurant/barhopping and did not want to spend a fortune on one place. They offered to hang our coats at the free coat check. Problem solved. In the end, they moved us to a dining table since our party went down to 10. One of the few upscale places in Chicago that was willing to accommodate to our group's requests despite us not having a private room or prix-fixe menu, or spending the minimum food and drink. BUT, we were beyond content with our dining experience that we stayed at Sunda longer and spent more than the minimum! Many thanks to the staff at Sunda for making our group feel special and responding to my numerous and incessant emails. I felt uncomfortably demanding at times, but they were always nice and professional in their responses via email and phone. Sunda offered a wide variety of Asian fusion cuisine that was interesting and delicious. We ate family style and shared the lumpia, duck steamed buns, sushi, crazy rice, and a few other dishes. They even took orders from people who were not able to attend the party and brought out champagne. The dining experience was lovely. We had multiple, knowledgable servers and the dishes arrived at a good speed that allowed us to graze and chat over a couple hours. Sunda went above and beyond to make this bachelorette party dinner memorable. Bottom line: In Chicago where good and creative restaurants are a dime a dozen, Sunda has staying power because of their excellent customer service.",0.9957,0.772,0.176,0.052,0.5482978279030911

Excellent service, you get seated quickly and the my server (a British guy) made strong recommendations which I took.  The first was for a ""brussels sprouts"" salad which featured sheared sprouts blended with other vegetables and carbs into a delicious, crunchy delight! Both the server and the chef said it was a tremendously popular item. Four out of five!!! The entree for me was a sashimi over rice, really sashimi and other items over rice, seaweed and other interesting but tasty items.  The rice had a sesame seed coating across the top similar to the outside of sushi pieces.  This was very flavor packed and awesome....highly recommended!  Five of five! My only complaints was the extremely high noise level and the lack of lighting.  This is a ""hot"" place for mostly twenty-somethings to get dressed up and hang out; unlike many similar places it has great food....it made the noise tolerable but still it was distracting.

For one, the uni looked yummy but was just a bit above mediocre and I think that's mostly due to the quail egg. To be fair, uni is usually mediocre at best unless you get it immediately. My issue was that my waitress asked if I wanted the quail egg and didn't mention that it was going to an extra $7 for each egg ($14 total). Not a huge deal because I'm already spending the money on sushi which is expensive, but I usually don't get the egg and I prefer the uni. Had I known it would have cost double, I would have opted out.  As for the fish, you have to order four pieces if you're doing sashimi which is a bit annoying.

I really like what sunda has going for it and when I'm with two or three other people I have no complaints, the atmosphere is exciting for out of towners and the food is great. That being said, I had a very bad time two weeks ago when I brought a group of 10 people for a business dinner. I have a sever food allergy and generally Sunda is really good at accomidating it, they have a special menu and can adulterate some dishes per my request. The problem was while my group was able to order a ton of dishes, I picked 3 small items from the allocated menu for myself. Even though my waiter was very knowledgable, he did not reflect this to the food runners. This meant that my 3 small dishes were then placed at the opposite end of the table and were not announced to the table as being ""special"" or for the person with the food allergy, therefore by the time the plate got down to me it was basically gone. And because this was a business dinner, with a few people I had never met before so I didn't say anything. All in all after ordering about 16 items for the table, I was able to have a miso soup, two pieces of sashimi and a bit of chinese broccoli.

What I'm annoyed with is that Sunda recently started offering private delivery and they are guilty of doing the same thing that a lot of high end restaurants seem to do - downsizing the portions and ingredients for delivery orders.  I don't get it.  If I come to your restaurant and order a dish, I pay a certain price and I get a certain amount of food.  But if I order it for delivery, you send me half the amount of food with less premium ingredients for the same price?  Con artists. Suffice it to say, I spent over $100 on Sunda delivery one night.  I know the food at the restaurant is worth it, and I expected the delivery to be good.  The packaging was nice but the food was downsized, little garnishes and sauces were missing, etc.  It's sad that a money-making machine like this place feels they need to cheat their customers.  Sunda, FYI, your delivery customers are also your restaurant customers and vice versa.  Delivery customers aren't second class citizens who deserve less shrimp!",0.6904,0.831,0.103,0.066,0.46808702791461404

The bloody mary cart was an impressive show but I don't know what people actually do with all these toppings (shrimp, wasabi, bacon, mushrooms??). Some of my party just started snacking on them. The mimosa also came with several options for the fruit juicy and my lychee one was quite tasty. As for the food, our waitress recommended family style to try more options. Again, I had order first and eat quickly to catch a flight, so can't comment on anything else except my own dish. I got the soft shell crab eggs benefit. Very interesting Asian fusion concept. The eggs benedict itself was quite tasty, they had it on this Indonesian biscuit instead of traditional English muffin, much better! The crab was not very big, but fried crisp and lightly battered.

2016-09-02,5.0,"This was one of the places that I wanted to try out in restaurant week but couldn't do so, so when I saw their brunch voucher on gilt I thought I'd try this Asian fusion place out. Needless to say I was very happy with the food. First we order a mimosa and a bloody Mary. Different from other places, their mimosa comes in different flavors such as lychee, mango, strawberry and of course orange. We had a lychee which we thought was better than the usual Champagne + orange juice. The lychee flavor was less strong, which balanced the champagne flavor more. The bloody Mary itself was one of the top five I've had. They also came with a separate cart where you can choose additional items, such as shrimps, olives, cucumber all the way to wasabi, Sriracha sauce and korean kimchi (how would that go I wonder, didn't dare to try lol). As I was finishing off my drink, I added some wasabi, which turned out to be surprisingly good. Even my bf who doesn't in general like wasabi liked it. Some new ideas for making our own bloody Mary! In terms of the food, we ordered shrimp tempura with walnut and creamy sauce, shiitake edamame dumplings, sisig and seafood longevity noodles. The shrimp tempura would be what you'd get in a nice Japanese restaurant, but I liked the walnut which really brought out the creaminess of the sauce. The edamame dumplings was very unique. I'd say the edamame filling is not very flavorful when I took a whole bite of the dumpling like usual. But when I chewed on it slowly, I could taste the freshness and feel the smooth texture of the edamame. The sisig was probably my fav. It was very flavorful. The huge pieces of octopus in the longevity noodles was fresh and tasty too. Overall this place is Asian fusion with a twist. I like how they are trying to be creative and unique.

2016-08-31,4.0,"Beautiful restaurant in a really great neighborhood.  I was on my own during a business trip on this visit - overall a great experience at the sushi bar.   I asked my server for some recommendations on sake - he provided a couple great options so I went with a flight of three (Junmai/Tokubetsu Junmai Nigori/Junmai Ginjo).   For an appetizer, I ordered the crispy rice spicy tuna - what a creation.  I've never had crispy rice sushi and it's great (the rice ball is seared slightly with spicy tuna and fresh jalapeño perched on top).   For my entree I debated between Pho (looked amazing) and the Pancit Canton - the server recommended the Pancit Canton so I went with that.  It was good, not amazing - there were components that were great, though - including the fresh noodles, the BBQ pork bits provided bursts of flavor and texture.  Overall I'd characterize the dish as moderately bland - not much spice (I want spicy when it comes to noodle dishes!) and the bok choi pieces were unmanageably huge!  The pork belly wasn't very crispy either as advertised.   Overall great experience - really nice, deep and diverse menu.  While I probably wouldn't order the entree I had again in the future I don't regret it.  I would go back.  The sushi was amazing!  A nice pan-Asian option in food paradise!",0.9946,0.736,0.239,0.025,0.5794642857142858

A few of the rolls can be underwhelming, as I wouldn't categorize them as traditional Cantonese dishes. But the black truffle rolls may be some of the best you've had. Them come 2 at a time and can be on the pricey side--but any foodie will need to take a bite out of it. Then again, isn't everything better with truffle?  The atmosphere is trendy, though there is a traditional sushi bar to dine as well. Also great for larger groups with a more private area in the back (where we sat).

2016-07-16,4.0,"I really would like to give this a 3.5/4 out of 5. My experience  was a little bit of a let down , since going in to this I had heard so much hype around this restaurant.  Walking in, the atmosphere is gorgeous. The decorations, lighting and vibe are romantic and trendy. It is extremely loud so I do not recommend going there for a first date if you are trying to get the know the person.  Going in to tonight's reservation, my boyfriend and I made sure to do our homework. We knew exactly what to try based on the reviews and recommendations we saw online and from our friends. To start, I had the pear sake cocktail and my boyfriend had the old fashioned. Both were two of the best cocktails I have ever had. I downed three of the pear sakes and wish I could have had more. I am convinced there is no alcohol in it though.  Food wise, we started with the Brussel sprout salad and the beef lollipops. The Brussel sprout salad came out almost instantly and was hands down the best thing we had all night. The beef lollipops on the other hand were so slow to come out. I honestly think we waiting 25 minutes+ after the salad. Once they came out, they aesthetically were gorgeous but tasted like hamburger meat. Wouldn't recommend them at all. Brussel sprouts I would give a 9.5/10 and the beef lollipops I would give a 5/10.  Next, we ordered the wagu beef crispy rice. Again, the service was extremely slow but the meal itself was pretty good. I would give it a 7/10. Glad I tried it but wouldn't get it again. Next, we got the gambler roll and the tail of two tunas. The tail of two tunas was fresh and I really enjoyed the fried shallots on top. The roll was a tad fishier than I usually like, but overall still good. I would give a 7.5/10. Finally the gambler. what a fun dish idea. Basically it's a roll with 6 pieces, each a tad spicy but one piece has a ghost pepper inside and you don't know which one it is. It was so much fun playing with the roll and thankfully my boyfriend got the ghost pepper and not me. The pain lasted 2 minutes and he was loving it the entire time. The roll even comes with a chip in the center that gives you a free desert for next time.  Overall the experience was pretty good. A tad disappointed in the overall experience but would try again.

Our server was highly attentive, making sure we were taken care of but not hovering in any way. Our drinks were made very quickly, and the food followed shortly thereafter. The only reason service wasn't phenomenal is because one of our dishes (the brussel sprouts - our favorite, as it turned out) was forgotten and only brought out when we asked for it at the very end.  We ordered:   Crispy Brussels Sprouts - the highlight of the meal. These are not your average boring, greasy, bacon-fat-laden brussel sprouts. These are bursting with layers of flavor (slight spice, some fish sauce) and texture. This was the dish that was forgotten - such a shame, because if there is one dish I would recommend above all else, it's the brussel sprouts.  Steamed Duck Buns - I liked the scallion buns - throwback to Chinese street steamed buns. The duck was pretty decent but all the pieces I encountered had a piece of ligament/tendon in them. Really wasn't a fan of that.  Drunken Noodles - pretty solid. Good quality and above average, but I would probably skip these in favor of some other noodle dish next time. Signature Crispy Rice w/Tuna - okay. The sushi rice was well-crisped, but the overall texture and flavor was just...not memorable Drinks: Sunda Old Fashioned - one of the better old fashioneds I've ever tried. Usually the bourbon is overpowering, but here the flavors were very well blended.  Lychee Luxury Drop - don't worry about the hint of wasabi! It was the perfect kick to offset the sweetness to the lychee/St. Germaine. All in all...if you go, don't mess around and GET THE brussel sprouts!!",0.9956,0.776,0.189,0.036,0.5167550505050506

We knew what we were getting into when we ordered them, but they were even heavier than we imagined. They would be perfect to make a meal out of. They didn't skimp on the lobster or the fried oyster in either of the rolls. The beef lollipops were delicious and lemongrassy with a gingery sauce. The shrimp tempera had delicious candied walnuts. The sprout salad was a good balance of spicy and salty. We also ordered the mochi ice cream and the green tea donuts. Both were fantastic, but the donuts stood out. They were the perfect fluffy texture. I was the only one to have a drink. I had an unfiltered sake. It was very nice. Our server was very nice and was constantly moving from table to table.

It is nice when you have a large group, because they will accommodate you and give you a semi-private place to sit in. Otherwise, coming with a group of people, it can get quite crowded, especially at the shared dinner tables and people walking back and forth.  The décor is nice and intimate.  Would be a great date place if its not during rush hour (would recommend a weekday). The cocktails here are delicious - I've liked everything I've had (pear sake cocktail, blackberry limeade and strawberry fields). The strawberry fields was a bit on the sweeter side than I prefer, but still very delicious!  In terms of the food, I have tried shiitake edamame dumplings (5 pieces, but very small and could probably finish the entire portion on my own), pad thai w/tofu (subpar, lacked any real flavor - prefer more traditional pad thai), and the sweet potato caterpillar sushi roll (good, large, however not worth the price).

2016-06-15,4.0,"In a nutshell....food, pretty stellar...service, friendly but lacking a bit in execution...manager, fabulous. I went last weekend with a few friends, and we shared quite a few dishes. Almost all of them were amazing, but two especially stood out. I highly recommend starting your meal with the Crispy Brussels Sprouts Salad...the menu description does NOT do it justice. And if you don't get the Crunchy Pig, Hidden Lobster Sushi, you'll be missing out on a food item that should be on everyone's Food Bucket List. I mean, seriously...bacon on sushi?!?!? Why don't more places do that??? The only dish that I thought didn't work was the BBQ Octopus. To me, the BBQ overwhelmed the flavor of the octopus. As for service, there were just a few misses, but a restaurant like this should shoot higher...first, we shouldn't have to ask for fresh plates between courses when the table is sharing numerous dishes, and second, just because I order a second beer, doesn't mean I don't want to finish my first. (My biggest server/bartender pet peeve is when they take your unfinished beer, without asking if you are done with it.) But, any service misses were forgotten due to Kevin Finegold, Sunda's outstanding GM. When we described our dining experience to him at the end of our meal, he said he wanted to buy us after-dinner drinks to make up for it, and then proceeded to walk us to their sister spot (Bottlefork) and introduce us to the bartender there, and make sure we had seats at the bar. Wow. Just wow. THAT is above and beyond. Now, not only am I anxious to return to Sunda, but I'm looking forward to trying out Bottlefork's menu.

2016-06-15,2.0,"This is your typical ""see and be seen"" crowd for River North. It's a very dark, loud, upscale place and the menu prices certainly are reflective of that.  My date and I each ordered an item from the sushi menu. Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna for him (4pcs) and Unagi Foie Nigiri for me (2pcs).  Note: the tuna is more ""poke"" style. While fresh and flavorful, at that price we were expecting glorious slices of tuna, not shredded fish). The Tuna was also served first way before before the unagi. So I watched my date eat his dinner and maybe 20 minutes later, he watched me eat my bite sized meal! It was a less than ideal dining scenario, especially since we were there to celebrate his birthday :(  We ""luckily"" decided to order tofu pad thai to share as well, since our stomachs were still growling after the small sushi portions.

2016-06-01,4.0,"As I was on my trip in Chicago, I realized that Filipino food must be the newest fad that's taken hold of the culinary world. Sunda is no exception to this rule.  Sunda is an asian fusion restaurant, featuring fusion cuisine from the Philippines, China, Japan, Thailand, Korea, and Vietnam. All the dishes we had were excellent (pork belly steam buns, lemongrass beef lollipops-very saucy and a bit sweet, drunken noodles, crab garlic noodles, sunrise sushi, panda sushi, rainbow sushi), except for the dessert, Sunda Sundae. I understand it as a take on the Filipino halo halo, a personal favorite treat of mine.  The biggest problem with the dessert is the added syrup/juice of the jackfruit, which I am accustomed to the taste, but it was overly sweet and too much.  This taste was awful and aversive enough for the other guests at the table, that they just didn't eat their order of the Sunda Sundae once they were past the three scoops of ice cream (taro/ubi macapuno, avocado, sweet corn/cheddar) with the small drizzle of condense milk on them.  There were also many items in the Sundae that were not listed on the menu. Such as the lychee, random piece of flan near the bottom, and sitting at the very bottom, the blended ice of calamansi. This was a big hodge podge of everything thrown together, the flavors not always completely complementary. I personally think it would have been better, if they held back on the syrup, and instead put something like coconut milk/evaporated milk.   I also really wanted to order the mochi, but the menu was sort of confusing, in the sense that, we were not sure if one order of mochi came with all the flavors that were listed, or if it was just one or two pieces of a flavor that you choose. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience, it was a friend's birthday and we had all decided to take a trip to Chicago and meet up. The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice, casual, and romantic, and it was very busy. The lighting was dim and moody. Our waitress was great, friendly, helpful and attentive. I only gave 4 stars because of the dessert which was inedible to other people in our party, one of the recommended cocktails (it had jalapeño in it) was not very good and caused a party member to feel ill for the rest of the night.",0.9887,0.804,0.138,0.059,0.5099291223681468

The menu consists of appetizers, salads, hot meat/seafood dishes, Asian noodle dishes and of course, sushi rolls, sashimi etc. I got a hot green tea which came out in its own little loose leaf tea pot, with a side of honey. It was so good and, as with everything else we ordered, the presentation was perfect. There was even a little honey comb dipper in the honey. ($4.50)  The menu is made to share and everything is delicious so no matter what you get you cant really go wrong, I highly recommend just making a selection of a few appetizers, rolls and sharing it all. We started with the Brussel sprout salad and it was SO good. Shaved Brussel sprouts with carrots, chili, cabbage, crisp onions and a shrimp sweet and sour sauce. ($17)  Then we shared the steak lollipops which were good but probably my least favorite thing of everything we ordered. My friend was trying to find something he had before and got the two mistaken (apparently what he was searching for was the lamb chops and he says those are insanely good, we will have to try them next time) and then we had 4 rolls which were all very good but the best by far was the Lobster and Wagyu roll (sp?) it's on the pricier end ($25) but it is worth every. Single. Penny. This roll melts in your mouth (probably the truffle aioli combined with lobster and delicious flank steak!) I cannot explain how amazing it was except to say that you should absolutely try it, much different than any sushi roll I've had in the past.  We also made the bold move of ordering the Gambler Roll. This roll has one randomly selected piece which includes diced up GHOST PEPPER. My boyfriend lost the game and ended up with the spicy hot piece but the good news is whoever ends up with the ghost pepper gets a token for a free dessert on their next visit.

The fried pieces of shaved brussel sprouts, red cabbage, carrots, and chilies made a perfect medley of flavors with each bite. The vinaigrette dressing adds even more flavor and be generous when you pour it over your salad! The bits of shrimp also add a nice texture to the dish.  Oxtail Dumplings- VERY good. While pricey for 5 small dumplings, each dumpling is packed with flavor and filled with tender, shredded oxtail meat. The light broth is also great for dipping.  Pork Belly Skewers- Highly recommended for the pork belly lovers out there. Generous portions of meat that are grilled to perfection.  Duck Breast Kimchi- Disappointing after we ordered per the server's recommendation. At $45, this is the most expensive main on the menu and does not live up to that price. The kimchi flavor was underwhelming and didn't work with the duck as well as I would have hoped.

2016-03-11,3.0,"Sunda is squarely 3.5 to 4 stars. Fun, hip, innovative Asian fusion cuisine. Most things have a twist which is what elevates it from the three to four star range. Nothing is wow. P,rices are appropirate for this idfferentiation: expensive in the $75-100 person range, without drinks, and without going wild, but a full meal and sampling of items. maybe a bit too expensive, especially for non distinctive items. My biggest problem w Sunda is things were pre-prepared plus its reliance on fried items. The highly rated bean sprout salad came out not hot and overly relies upon cripy fried items. The flavor is innovative and tasty for a fried sweat and sour salad dish. The best thing was the spicy tuna sticky rice sushi roll, but it came out within one or two mins of ordering and before items we had ordered previously, so it had been prepared. To its credit, it was very tasty and the rice and other components didn't feel or taste pre-prepared. The secret to this dish is that the tuna is not a piece of maguro w a slice of jalapeno, but a tuna tartare on top of sticky rice w jalepeno. The flavor and texture of the tartare was excellent. Personally, I would have prevferred fresh sushi rice to fried sticky rice. WORST item was the ""lemongrass"" lolipop beef. BAD.

The host says she doesn't know, and I'll have to call dine  in.com  or grub hub to ask. It was irritating to me that she didn't offer to find out herself, and also her tone of voice was rude.

2016-03-11,5.0,"Easily my favorite restaurant in the whole city! Service is always stellar, the food is incomparable, and the vibe is awesome. A little loud on a Friday night, but it's expected with a restaurant so popular. Maybe if the music was turned down a bit, it would be helpful. My current favorite items are the grilled ahi tuna and pork salad; adobo braised pork belly; seared salmon; and tiger shrimp tempura. Believe me, all absolutely mouthwatering!  I've also had the Brussels Sprouts salad - their most popular one - but wasn't a huge fan. It had a nice tangy kick and I've never had my sprouts so thinly shredded, but at times it was dry and felt more like slaw, which I wasn't craving. We could have also done without the Crazy Rice, which was a little too salty and bland for our taste. If you're looking for sushi, the Sunda handroll is a great choice.  As far as drinks go - tried their blackberry limeade and strawberry fields, both delicious.  Hard to get a table so book in advance!",0.9933,0.728,0.241,0.031,0.7116255144032922

When we walked in, the lobby was packed and we were told our table would be ready shortly if we wanted to wait at the bar that had no available room.  15 minutes later, I asked if the sushi bar seating was self serve and the hostess told me that it wasn't but our table was just being cleared up. 30 minutes later we still weren't seated and watched as the hostess told other people checking in the same thing. The managers were handing the hosts plates of lumpias to pass around to apologize for the wait, which was fine. 1. Sunda shouldn't be accepting reservations on opentable that aren't available. 2. They need to train their staff not to lie and say the tables are being cleared off when it's a matter of them mismanaging their covers.  Sunda has been open long enough to know better. The food we ordered was all fine except for the warm mushroom side for $18 was horrible. We didn't touch it after one bite and the server didn't offer to take it off or asked if something was wrong, which is fine, it was busy.

I feel like the rainbow roll is a good way to compare the quality of sushi and this just didn't impress not enough fish for the amount of rice. The crab encrusted tuna was pretty good but would've liked to taste the mustard a bit. The crazy rice was pretty good flavor and spice wise, the quality of the chicken wasn't that great though.

2016-02-12,5.0,"Went to Sunda last night for a birthday party, and boy was it awesome. I'm normally not the biggest Brussels sprout fan, but like other reviewers, I was thoroughly impressed by the Brussels sprout salad. It was flavorful, crispy, and addicting. The tempura tiger shrimp was quite impressive as well. It was a great mix of slightly sweet and savory and had a lot of texture. We probably polished this dish within 5 minutes.  In terms of sushi, we ordered the truffle tuna. My tip is do not use soy sauce as it mutes the beautiful truffle flavor. Now, the other note about this dish is that it is quite expensive. It only comes with two pieces, so we had to place 2 orders, which came to $28 for 4 pieces. The jalapeno hamachi was beautifully plated and delicious, but I will be honest that it wasn't much different than the jalapeno hamachi you get at other sushi restaurants. In terms of Thai food, we ordered the panang curry and pad thai. The panang curry was surprisingly spicy, which we really liked. It had a great depth of flavor, a good amount of juicy, moist chicken and was beautifully plated in a raw coconut bowl. Unfortunately, the pad thai was underwhelming. It was a little too sweet, and it tasted like maybe they put too much fish sauce? Not quite sure, but definitely our least favorite. Finally, their spare ribs were fall off the bone amazing. We got the Chinese New Year Special which meant the ribs were cooked in a spicy bean curd sauce. It would be interesting to see what the ribs tasted like normally. We also indulged in the cocktail menu. The Strawberry Fields and Lychee martini are perfect drinks for people who like sweet and fruity cocktails. The Saketini was a nice departure from the sweet drinks as it was more citrusy and had a sake after taste. This is a great place to go for a nice, swanky dinner. It's probably best to go with a large crowd versus a date, because it is quite loud. Definitely will be back.",0.9993,0.671,0.315,0.014,0.6724831268948913

Things took awhile, the service was friendly and accommodating when we got it. They did their best and we had a great time nonetheless. We ordered the bloody mary bar which means they come around with this cart and give you a bowl of a bunch of garnishes. The tacinto (bacon) is incredible! It's slightly sweet and when it's been soaking in your bloody mary for awhile, it makes your drink delightfully peppery. I had the soft shell crab benedict and it was amazing! The biscuits they were served on were almost TOO buttery (I know, right?) but they had an amazing fluffy texture. The real secret drink is the Sumo Mary. I actually wanted to order it but it wasn't listed on the menu so I thought they stopped making it. Apparently it's an off menu item. It's $40 but it comes with a meal.

It's a trick of the trade and as we shared our meal, the place got packed with a hopping office crowd. I started to look at the dishes and they all seemed to have one trick or another up their sleeve. I have had a lot of very high quality sushi and Japanese/Asian fusion and this was an imitation not the real thing. My drink was over filled with ice cubes and watered down, but the coup de grace was the ""gift"" from the chef of a final course of escolar. Look it up.

As it was around 7 on a Friday night, we had a bit of a wait, but it was totally worth it as we got the end of a long table to ourselves.  My friend had two manhattans so I take it they were good. I had a delicious white wine from the Languedoc region that was creamy and perfect. My husband tried two different sakes, the second being a cloudy one he loved. My other friend had a beer and a sake.  No complaints from any of us. As you know from my former review, we were blown away on our first visit here back in the spring.  I am happy to report the quality has stayed exactly the same, which is to say, perfect!   The tuna stuffed avocado is a delight to taste!   New for us was the wagyu and lobster roll, which I liked, but which my three compatriots loved!  Creamy lobster, a hint (thank goodness, not too much) of truffle oil, all topped with craftily executed wagyu was something to experience! Next up - the tried and true 'lettuce wraps' that, while actually almost impossible to eat as lettuce wraps, remain my favorite thing on the menu.  First of all, the pork and tuna play so well together, as do the chilis, mangos, and spices, you can't help but just have fun eating this. I also think the portion size is the best deal I've had here. Just love everything about it. Finally we tried the coconut sea bass, because of course, I adore Chilean sea bass, and anything cooked with different peppers and coconut broth has to be tried.  The four of us smiled with decadent glee as we portioned off this final part of our meal.

The red pepper puree wasn't 1) enough and 2) strong Dessert: Ridiculous: really good. The three layers of ice cream, carrot cake and puff pastry were quite tasty. The single small change I would have made is make the puff pastry crispy since that is what you expect. But a must try! Overall: great ambience.

Kept the sauce on the side to try it with the sweet sauce that it comes with, soy sauce and the sauce from the miso cauliflower. All surprisingly good with the salad. The miso cauliflower was delicious. Had the spicy tuna crispy rice. My husband loved the crispy rice and I did not. The texture reminded me of rice that wasn't cooked all the way through. I loved the tuna on top though. Ordered shrimp (not for me), salmon and tuna nigiri. Nigiri was fresh, but they put sesame seeds on the salmon. Didn't really care for it, because it changed the texture and the taste. The lemongrass beef lollipops were good. They are a little bit too sweet for my taste, but my little one loved them. My husband ordered the number ten and the loved it.  He also had the sake flight and his favorite was the unfiltered one. The pomegranate soda was refreshing and really tasty.

2015-12-08,4.0,"I've been to Sunda a number of times. It is one of my colleague's favorite sushi restaurants in Chicago, so needless to say, we have tried quite a bit of the menu. This is not a traditional sushi restaurant, so come in expecting a trendier type of place. The service is usually quite quick, but especially so at lunch. At dinner, sometimes, waiters can get a little bit tied up. Although it is a relatively simple item, I am a fan of their miso soup with enoki mushroom. It is flavorful and the mushrooms always come cooked with a wonderful texture. The spicy tuna on crispy rice is one of my favorite items on the menu. The rice is not overly crispy, but just crisped up on top and bottom. My colleagues are big fans of the Red Dragon roll, while i tend to prefer more simple rolls like spicy tuna and yellowtail with scallions. The sashimi here is good, but it definitely isn't the best.  When I am feeling in the mood for it, I like to order the bento box ($18), which comes with a protein/main item, a small cucumber seaweed salad and your choice of a spicy tuna roll/avocado cucumber roll/ California roll. My favorite is the New York steak, although the salmon is also solid. It is definitely enough food on its own, so if you are stumped, I definitely recommend trying it out. Last time we were there, we also tried the Pad Thai. I thought the fish was good, but it was nothing special in my opinion. Pretty much what you would expect from your run of the mill pan-Asian restaurant.

It all looked delicious, and mostly tasted good. Some items were a bit too spicy for some palates at our table, but everyone was happy with the food and desserts.

2015-11-24,5.0,"We had dinner at Sunda on a Sunday night and were totally blown away. It was an OUTSTANDING meal! Décor: This is a pretty big place with tons of tables of different sizes. When full, the dining area is pretty packed with people, it's a bit hard to navigate the sea of patrons, but you still don't feel like people are on top of you. The decorations are a cool ""modern Asian"" and everything is super clean. The sushi bar is large and seemed pretty empty (which is a good thing to remember when/if I want to swing by for a quick bite). Bathroom: Very clean and inviting, the individual ""stalls/rooms"" are cool. Staff: Our waiter, ""Daniel L"", was probably the best waiter I have ever experienced at any restaurant. Not only was he friendly and personable but he knew the menu inside and out and did an outstanding job of ""timing"" the food to come out at great intervals. When the rest of the place filled up he got very busy but he was still there when we needed him. The bus boys/helpers were great too, bringing food and taking dirty dishes, and our water glasses were always full. Absolutely FANTASTIC service! Drinks/Food: We started with wine (some kind of red blend which was very good!) and a cocktail - they have a solid selection of liquors. From there we dove into the meal and it was heaven at every bite! We had: Spicy Edamame (SO GOOD! The sauce was tangy and spicy and it came out HOT), Miso Soup (great flavor! but lacked a bit on the tofu, seaweed, onions inside), Crispy Brussel Sprouts Salad (holy cow, this was OUT OF THIS WORLD!), Oxtail Pot Stickers (very tasty with great flavor), Lemongrass Beef Lollipops (oh man, these were DELICIOUS! The flavor! the glaze!), Pork Belly Skewers (so tender and tasty!), Signature Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna and Shrimp (the topping was good but I did not like the crispy rice), Unagi Sashimi (prepared perfectly!), Red Dragon Roll (YUM YUM YUM), Crunch Pig Hidden Lobster Roll (this was interesting but not enjoyed too much at all... wouldn't get it again), Pho (huge serving and very good), Seoul Fried Chicken (very enjoyable), NY Strip Steak (good, but pretty fatty/grisly), Sunda Sunday (a mix of all kinds of flavors and very enjoyable), and the molten Chocolate Cake (tasty, of course!). Wow, we had a TON of food but it was all worth it. My top 3 favorites would have to be: Brussel Sprout Salad, Lemongrass Beef Lollipops, and Red Dragon Roll. Value: The prices are a bit high. It makes sense because it is a nice place an all but you will spend a decent amount for a full meal here. However, the food and the service are SO WORTH IT!

First and foremost - you need to get a bloody mary when you go here.  Sunda's bloody mary cart is like nothing I have ever seen before...holy garnishes...anything from pickled tomatoes to kimchi to pickled cucumber to mushrooms to bacon (I am blanking on the actual name of this meat as they did not call it bacon...it is not 'American' bacon technically) to shrimp to tofu...the list goes on.  It's amazing...and the best part is, they'll give you as much of whatever you want. Now the food...I can't say enough good things about it and the best advice I can give is to go to Sunda (very) hungry because you'll want everything. We had crispy brussel sprout salad, steamed duck buns, shitake edamame dumplings, and a special they had which was a crispy pancake containing beef, shrimp, bean sprouts, and onions.  All of the food was AMAZING.  I recommend it all.  There was so much else on the menu we wanted to try (the longevity noodles, their bibimbap, and more.

2015-11-16,5.0,"Unbelievable!!!  Oh, Chicago!  You were already an awesome city, but you have Sunda, which bumps you up a notch!!! Sunda has such a fantastic and unusual approach to ""Asian Fusion""  But really, front and center is the cuisine from the Philippines!  I may be a bit biased (or even more critical) since I am Filipino, but Sunda has taken a much needed modern approach to Filipino cuisine. We really had no idea of what to expect.  Yes, we did peruse Yelp to check out what others were saying, but they were across the board.  All I knew was we just needed to try a little bit of everything.  We ordered the following: Crispy Brussels Sprouts, BBQ Octopus, Crazy Rice, and Lemongrass Beef Lollipops.  Although, there were only 4 dishes, they were very generous portions.  We were struggling by the time the Lemongrass Beef Lollipops came out.  Luckily, we stroke up a conversation with the 2 guys seated next to us (also FIlipino).  It was such a comfortable situation, we ended up joining tables and sharing our meals together!  Let's just say it felt like I was at a relative's party.  We were able to partake of their meal, which included the Adobo braised Pork Belly and Pancit Canton and we happily shared ours.  As we conversed with our impromptu meal partners, we found out that I had a birthday close to one of the local guys!  And, the sly dude got us each a birthday cake!!! Anyway, let's talk about the food!!! Crispy Brussels Sprouts: I love Brussels Sprouts!  Crispy, crunchy, and with just enough fish sauce flavor that it was not overpowering the dish!  A definite must! BBQ Octopus:  Now with Octopus, I am always a bit weary, since there is a fine line on how to cook it.  But Sunda did a perfect job!  And even with the flavors of the gojuchang and kimchee, you can still taste the octopus. Crazy Rice:  Holy hell!!!  It's a take on bibimbop, but seafood style!  Lobster, chicken, shrimp!  All the flavors worked well together and did not compete with each other, of course a fried egg helps to bind it all together!   Lemongrass Beef Lollipops:  OK, I have to admit this was the least favorite of the dishes we were served, but we were almost to the point of bursting by the time this came out!  IMO, the meat was a bit too tough, but it was savory. Adobo braised Pork Belly:  Once again, Sunda, has taken my nanay's recipe and somehow modernized it.  It's salty, vinegary, and garlicky, what else do you need?  Oh, yes, some white rice to sop up that sauce. Pancit Canton:  THE BEST PANCIT CANTON I have ever had!!!  I can't describe exactly what made it taste sooo good, but this was perfection!!! We were actually lucky the night we were at Sunda.  We also got to meet Billy Dec, one of the owners of Sunda.  Our newly acquired meal partners knew him and introduced us.  Billy Dec was super nice guy, down to earth, and definitely knows more Tagalog than me... So if you're in Chicago, and want a new, modern, refreshing take on Asian cuisine, I highly recommend Sunda!!!  I know I will be paying Sunda a visit the next time I'm in town!",0.9982,0.768,0.184,0.048,0.5273572084481174

Appetizers were devoured in conjunction with the Red Dragon (signature sushi roll), some sort of meat pot stickers, and the Tiger Shrimp Tempura, which I'm now aware has a creamy honey aioli to complement the candied walnuts.

The Cadillac of the Rockit Ranch offering, this sleek, chic family-style Asian-inspired shop is rolling out amazing dishes in a gorgeous and cavernous dining room.  We came with a group of 8 colleagues after a long day of meetings. No one particularly wanted to ""take charge"" of ordering, so we asked the server (great attitude, amazing knowledge) to put together a series of sharing courses for us. Awesome. We went through around 15 courses of their top hitters, from spicy brussel sprout salad (believe), through a handful of sushi offers, carmalized pork belly, fried chicken, oxtail potstickers, a beautiful black bass -- the list goes on and on. Wine and cocktail lists were extensive, so it also makes sense to ask for some advice there. After ordering a Pinot Noir sight unseen (and not being totally happy with is), our server recommended the ""Prisoner"" red blend which turned out to be an amazing accompaniment to the meal. The main dining area is a brilliantly spaced collection of dark wood and light. Whether you sit at the sushi bar or at one of the wide, rough-hewn teak tables, you'll get a sense that you're part of a crowd. Since we were a work group, they decided to seat us in the semi-private back room, which is great for enabling conversation, but less energetic. Next time I'd sit in the main room. All in all, with a couple drinks each and the 15 some courses, plus two desserts to share, the final bill surprisingly only came out at around 75 bucks per person, making Sunda a surprisingly great deal for a Michelin recommended experience.

The dishes are shareable so we ordered two appetizers and two entrees: Lumpia-Being Filipino and growing up with lumpia, I can sometimes be quite the critic.

I would definitely recommend it. We pushed the adobo fried rice to the side and battled over who would get to eat the most of this dish.

I might come back, but won't make an effort to do it. SLICK, MODERN AND CROWDED. Hopefully that summed it up for ya. Also, reading their description on yelp as to the inspirations of the restaurant was possibly one of the silliest and far fetched paragraphs I've read in my life.  SWEET, VERY SWEET. I had the tiger shrimp tempura and it was so unbearably sweet and I did not like it whatsoever to be honest. But that's just a matter of taste, I wish it wasn't drenched in sauce. So, i thought to get a couple pieces of nigiri, I was shocked by how sweet the rice was. I've never had nigiri with rice this sweet, I had to leave all the rice on the plate. I think the chef has an obsession with sugar. Fish was fresh, about average quality grade. Nothing to brag about.  OUT OF UNI. What do you mean you are out of Uni?

Ambiance and wait staff were great, but the food, not so much. Starters - Lumpia with pork and shrimp. I've had lumpia before, and by had I mean I ingested like 100 in one sitting, but this did not leave me wanting more. It was fine but nothing super special. I will say there were quite a few pieces of it so it's a good appetizer to share. We also got the Oxtail Pot Sticker. Very meaty with a nice kick from the wasabi cream. It had a sweet undertone so I didn't love it but it was adequate. Entrée - Pho. Tons of meat. It comes with a huge bone marrow sitting in the middle, surrounded by a big piece of bison short rib and oxtail. The soup was darker than I had expected it to be. I was hoping for something more clean and clear as that is what I've had in the past. It was as if they already added the hoison sauce into the broth, which for me is a huge no because as you can read, I do not like a sweet taste in savory foods. But they also gave hoison on the side so not 100% sure what made the soup sweet and dark. Lastly, the soup came tempered down. It looked hot with steam coming out but when I started to mix everything, it came out more cool than hot which is not appealing with all the fat from the marrow and oxtail. My friend had the Adobo braised pork belly. It definitely can be shared amongst the table, nice and fatty. That I thought was better than the pho. I also sampled the drunken noodle which was unfortunately drenched in sweet sauce.  Overall, too many sweet components in their entrees.

The drinks were creative and not too sweet. Overall a great experience. Though the place was packed, I thought the service was just ok. The food arrives whenever each dish is ready so it's a bit chaotic especially considering how many different dishes we ordered. I get they do this to keep the food fresh and I like it in theory. However, due to the hecticness, some of the things we tried to order again (a 2nd order of the edamame dumplings because they were so good!) never showed up.

Though I'm not a big fun of this type of bar ish setup, Love the atmosphere. Totally miss the loud crowd...lol. But food... Big sigh.. Got mushroom salad. Let's say ingredient is fresh but too spicy, the spice especially the lemongrass totally masked the unique fresh taste of mushroom. Plus the type of pepper used is more of a Mexican hot rather than Asian spicy. I would give negative points to the chef on this one, totally overkill the main ingredient in this dish. Then I had Uni sushi and Unagi sushi. I always order them because they are simple but hard to deal with. Uni is not fresh, I had one but refuse to eat the second piece. After I told the waiter, he was surprised and told me they have it air shipped in daily. Okay, I believe you but it's not fresh. You might want to change the vendor. Uni is hard to keep fresh and not everyone knows what to do with it... Unagi sauce is totally wrong... Please research, you are supposed to put the eel skin inside the sauce and simmer it down... Hmmm I have way too high of a standard.. I should not expect a restaurant in river north understands the dish it provides... My fault. So I didn't finish the Unagi as well. I also had a hand roll. It's okay. It's also my safe bet because tuna is simple and it won't ever be bad even if it's not right. So, here you go. If this is in Cal, I'd demand a free meal.

2015-09-02,3.0,"Our server was impeccable along with the guy helping her serve and clear the table.  We were here for my boyfriend's 30th birthday with his best friend who flew in, his siblings, and parents who are the very traditional type that rarely eats out at a restaurant and if they do, it's usually a causal place.  The sisters wanted a new place to try so I was the one who picked this place, thinking it would be something the parents and everyone else could enjoy.  Sushi was okay- I could prob get sushi anywhere like that for half the price.  I did enjoy the lemongrass lollipops (something diff that you don't usually see), very moist and the dipping sauce was a great accompaniment. We ordered two of everything - tiger shrimp tempura (I think I ate more walnuts than anything, but the sauce was good, not too sweet as some are), bbq grilled kimchi octopus (flavorful, nice charred taste), coconut sea bass (great fish, coconut juice wasn't as flavorful as I thought), adobo braised pork belly (very tender and this was the dad's favorite), smoked salmon rice crisp (just typical, not something I would recommend, no pizazz about it), steamed buns, pork belly & duck (a lot of sauce, not enough meat), drunken noodles, crazy rice, and pork adobo rice (all were great, esp the crazy rice since it had the lobster - fried egg on both those rice dishes was perfect).  There may have been a few more dishes, but I cannot recall now..we ordered a lot! A few of us also ordered miso soup, I did not but the mom said it was so salty and kept pouring water in everyone's soup.  I just thought maybe she was over-exaggerating but I got a spoon full of my boyfriend's and it already had the extra water and I have to admit - that thing was suuuuper salty!  I'm not sure what happened with their soup.  On to the cake, that I picked up at a Greek bakery.  As soon as we walked in and the hostess greeted me, she saw me with the cake box and told me off the bat that there's a cake cutting/serving fee of $3/person. I do appreciate the fact she told me upfront but I obviously couldn't decline and run the cake back to the car (since this was clearly a b-day dinner).  At the end of our face stuffing feast, the server brought the white choc mousse with raspberry and choc cake out with candles that I brought and then she took it back to get it cut and we waited over 15 mins for it be brought back out. We were all getting antsy and kept wondering what happened to the cake.  Both the server and her guy helping kept wondering where our cakes were bc they looked over at our empty and cleared out table and we looked at them for the cakes and then they kept looking back towards the kitchen.. So then our server finally runs back and she came out and told me there was misunderstanding from the kitchen and they were waiting for her to go back there but she told them to go ahead and bring it. She then apologized for the wait and said they would only charge the cutting fee for half of the people. Keep in mind, we had 10 people in the party - 9 adults and a 3 yr-old who waited so long for the cake, she actually passed out in her mother's arms by the time cake slices came out.  So we were charged $15 instead of the $30 to cut the cake.  I do think it was a bit absurd, but at the same time I can understand something like this.  They did however, take the fruit off the top and placed it on the slices that were served, so that shows that actually put some effort and justice in the cake cutting/serving fee. In the end, they also gave my boyfriend a $10 GC as a bday gift - nice gesture! To conclude, positive vibes to the server and her helper and how tentative they were with clearing out the table and drink needs.  Some food was mediocre, salty, and some were superb.

We started with the fried brussel sprout salad.  The flavors were just ok, not great.  We followed with the duck dumplings.  They were not at all what we expected.  It was essentially a roast duck sandwich with fluffy breading.  The breading overwhelms the flavor of the duck.  I ate the duck by itself.  We then had the seabass in a coconut curry broth.  It was served tepid and the flavors were just ok.  Finally we had a dessert that was the strawberry rhubarb cobbler.  It was not tart enough to taste the rhubarb.  If the place were a 1/3 less expensive, I would have enjoyed it just a tad more.  But earlier in the day we had a Vietnamese meal in Chinatown and four dishes left us extremely full and very happy for the price of $21.  Our meal at Sunda cost us 5 times that and about half as happy.",0.9586,0.826,0.124,0.051,0.5542753623188406

But the service and food left something to be desired.  Food: We got a bunch of small plates to share... so maybe our mistake was not going for any of the main dishes, but nothing we ate was super memorable or amazing. The ones I can remember are:  - Steamed duck buns: This was probably the best dish I tried. Loved the traditional Chinese duck/hoisin flavors. The bun was perfectly soft and warm. - Lemongrass beef lollipops: thin sliced steak wrapped around a stick. Not memorable. - Tofu pad thai: Very good. One of the better pad thai dishes I've had in a long time! - Lobster and wagyu sushi roll: Good roll, but not outstanding as you'd expect the ingredients to reflect. And at $23, not worth it frankly. The service was rather annoying... we told our waitress at least 5 times that it was our friend's birthday, expecting her to come out with  a small dessert/candle. Yet every time we reminded her, she'd come back and ask if we were ordering dessert or needed anything else, almost like she'd forgotten again. It ruined the surprise and the birthday girl caught on fast that we were asking for a special birthday dessert for her. No bueno.

Good but nothing out-of-the-world. Heard the brussel sprout salad is amazing but not a huge fan so I opted for something a little more classic - Crazy Rice (seafood fried rice with some heat). Well at least what they say about heat as it was medium and nothing spicier than what you can find at a Chinese/Thai restaurant.

2015-07-12,2.0,"The food at Sunda was excellent, but the hostile service here made me wish I could get up and leave no fewer than five times. If I had not been there for a birthday party, I would not have spent a dime. The hostess went out of her way to make us feel like peasants upon our arrival. I lived in NYC for eight years and never encountered this much attitude in a restaurant. It was a surprise party for which we had arranged for the chef's table. We told this to the hostess, who told us that it didn't matter and that more of our party would have to be there for us to be seated. She suggested we surprise her at the (crowded) bar and then be seated. We stood at the bar, next to our large, clean, empty, reserved table (not, unfortunately, the chef's table). At the bar, my friend and I each ordered a $22 glass of champagne after waiting ten minutes to get the bartender's attention. Once we did, he had a bar back pour and serve it. I wanted to close out, but could not get the bartender's attention  again. I waved my card at him desperately, then put it away and drank my champagne. One minute later, my male acquaintance who had arrived ordered a drink and the bartender asked him if he would like to pay for our champagne. I shouted (because it was very loud and the bar was too wide for any normal volume call to reach the man) that I would pay. Ten minutes later, I closed my tab.  Our server walked away while I was ordering and finally took my and my friend's orders after most of my party had already eaten. My friends and I tried waving him down, but he would nod at us and then walk away and not return. At one point, he brought my friend an expensive drink that she did not order but did not stop long enough for us to say we needed food. I definitely would have stormed out in a normal situation if the waiter was rudely ignoring me and bringing random drinks without stopping, but this was a birthday.  The food, once finally ordered, took a lot of time to come out, and we wondered if our server had forgotten to place the order for us. Everyone had completely finished their meals by the time ours arrived. The trend here of making people wait without acknowledging their presence or looking them in the eye really bothered me.  There were actually more fiascos, but this review is long enough. Food aside, it was the worst dining experience I've ever had, including the time that I got food poisoning from a movie theater pizza.  I never thought that poor service could completely ruin a delicious meal for me, but in this case, I would gladly have traded it for a stop at Portillo's or, better yet, waited two hours at the Michelin-starred restaurant down the block from my apartment. The service will likely put this place out of business if it continues to be this abysmal.

Our table for two was spacious and the seating was comfortable. Chris ordered Prosecco which he said was tasty. I had Tito's Vodka and soda with lime. My drinks were okay but were not as strong as mine I make at home. :) We each started with a Miso Soup and split the Crispy Brussels Sprouts salad. We both agreed that these two were the stars of the evening. The Miso Soup was salty but the flavors were fabulous. The salad was inventive and more than enough food for two people. The chili peppers added a nice kick.  We stuck with sushi rolls for the rest of our meal. We had the Sweet Potato Caterpillar, the Rainbow, the Number Ten and the Lobster and Wagyu. All of the rolls tasted fresh. The Number Ten rolls in particular were some of the biggest I have had in a long time. Later, we split a piece of birthday cake that one of the busboys brought out. It was a bit dry but it was the thought that counted. The one busboy who was in charge of refilling water was very attentive. Our waiter, Jake, was friendly but sometimes he disappeared for quite some time. I am taking into account that the restaurant was packed, but it took 10-15 minutes to take care of our bill which I found a tad long. Also, Chris and I found ourselves boiling up in the restaurant as we were halfway through our meal. It seems that the A/C was struggling or not working at all. The word, overpriced, did enter our minds after leaving. Nothing we tried here failed but for sure, you can go elsewhere and devour sushi that is just as good or even better for less money. We did not go hungry by any means though. The menu is extensive and there are plenty of other options besides sushi to try.

On food and atmosphere alone I would say it's a four, but have you seen the prices here?? $20 for fried rice?? Give me a break. For the amount you will spend here you can get a much better/more satisfying meal elsewhere.  I will sum it up by saying this place is kind of like the hipster tapas version PF Chang perhaps - tastes fine, but not worth it if you've had good, authentic Asian food. If you're not very familiar with Asian cuisine and don't frequent authentic Asian restaurants though, this is probably not a bad place to check out.",0.929,0.819,0.131,0.05,0.4389499389499389

Had the hamachi marrow which is a delicate yellowtail that looks maybe a little seared or torched, topped with delicious roast bone marrow giving the piece a smokey saltiness.  Best part of the meal was the escolar ""great white,"" a piece of fish wrapped cylindrically around a ball of rice, topped with a crisp potato chip and black truffle.

Your ears may ring after eating there. Also, this place is BUSY. Reserve a table. Otherwise, you won't be eating there without a very long wait. As for the food and drinks, absolutely excellent. The flavor nuances in the edibles were incredible, and by far the best I have ever had from an Asian Fusion-style restaurant. The ""fusion"" part of the cuisine was absolutely present, pulling together Japanese, Chinese, and Thai flavors perfectly. Everyone in our party of five enjoyed their meal, including the pescatarian in our group. The service was also excellent. Our server payed just the right level of attention to us, spending several minutes at the beginning to explain the menu and make suggestions. The only problem was that a couple of times servers bumped into the back of my chair as they were passing by to serve other tables. It wasn't a deal breaker, but definitely not something I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Our server was top-notch, though.

The waitress was attentive and made sure we had everything we wanted, and I rather liked how the restaurant was set up.  I came for Sunday brunch and got the braised pork on rice patty. I thought the Asian twist on eggs benedict rather interesting; however, the pork, while tender, was too salty and needed the help of the hollandaise sauce to diffuse the saltiness. The entree also came with a side of salad, which I thought was rather out of place in an Asian fusion breakfast setting. I also wasn't blown away by the salad like I would have expected to be at a place like Sunda.

Expect overpriced, small portions (even relative to other fancy restaurants).  Shiitake Edamame Dumplings (5): 4/5 -- This was a pretty solid choice. Pretty flavorful, and the accompanied sauce was excellent.  Crazy Rice: 2.5/5 -- The crazy rice wasn't crazy enough. The dish combines lobster, crab, and chicken in an flavorless manner. You would think they would add more spices to this dish or something.  Red Dragon: 2.5/5 -- Again, not the best sushi in the world. If I pay $20 for a roll of shrimp tempura, I expect a wow factor and warmth (I mean tempura means fried after all). Unfortunately, I got neither.

2015-04-20,3.0,"Tried out Sunda for brunch because it was near our hotel.  The first table the hostess seated us at was a high top that was literally right behind the bar/drink station/computer. I was literally sat looking right at a messy server station where a server had left a used protein shaker and other dirty dishes. I asked to be moved. The hostesses were not very nice about the move, but they did ultimately move us to a real table in the center of the restaurant. I was glad we moved because this ended up being quite an expensive brunch, and I would have been angry if we spent over $100 on brunch looking at a server station. We ordered from the sushi side of the brunch menu. All of the food was very good, but I am not sure it was worth the price--at least not as brunch items. For example, the $18 rainbow roll was good, but you can't have just that as a meal. Service by the waitstaff was very good.

2015-04-06,4.0,"My husband brought me to Sunda for my birthday last month. It was a great place to be for a celebration dinner.  Our reservation was at 5:45PM which was perfect because we were going to the Book of Mormon immediately afterward. This was also great because when we first arrived it wasn't as packed or as loud as it was when we were leaving. Maybe I'm a fuddy-duddy but I like being able to hear people at my table without yelling! We ordered the appetizer of spicy edamame. I like spicy food but this was a little bit spicier than I would've liked. The chili's were getting stuck in my throat and making me choke a little. We also got the tiger shrimp tempura which was amazing. It was warm and creamy, and the shrimp with the candied walnuts was perfect. It was a great starter dish and I would definitely recommend getting it.  We also got the crunchy pig, hidden lobster roll and the baked snow crab handroll. My husband also got some nigiri. All of the sushi was fresh and tasty. The crunchy pig, hidden lobster was surprising, but in a good way. It had bacon bits on top! I also had a strawberry fields drink, which was just ok.  There were some things I would've changed about the experience (some of the servers) and some things that would make us come back (the food). Right after we were initially seated, we were right next to two really drunk men. One of the men knocked his wine glass over onto the floor, and red wine spilled all over me and glass was everywhere. Some of the service people thought that I had spilled the glass, and the gentleman that came with a broom to clean it up was very rude. He kept asking me to get up but there was glass all over the floor, on my chair, in my hair, etc. We ended up switching tables which was a pain for the staff, but we didn't want to sit next to drunks all night. The night certainly wasn't ruined by this, but this server was a bit ruder than he should've been (especially misplaced rudeness). One server came over with two glasses of sake to make up for it (big points for her).

The servers are knowledgeable and friendly, not a hint of condescension. Although the restaurant is busy at no time did we feel rushed.  The menu is interesting with enough variety to satisfy even the most finicky eater. Portion sizes are fair and represent a good value. I didn't feel ripped off. So why only three stars? One reviewer used the word Meh! to describe the food and I think that's a fair assessment; at least based on the items we ordered: Steamed buns with duck, a Bento box with Jidori Chicken and the house Pancit.  The steamed buns looked beautiful and the duck was done well. I've had better texture in buns but they were still better than average. This was an auspicious beginning. Then came the Bento Box, which is a very good value. The Miso soup was above average. The seaweed salad was as good as I've had anywhere including in Japan. The California roll was a disappointment, it was bland and insipid. The jidori chicken was another disappointment. It was a bit overcooked, and chcken doesn't take well to overcooking. The seasoning was uninspiring.  The Pancit was good but nothing to write home about. The house version comes with shrimp and pork belly and small pieces of Chinese sausage with ramen noodles and vegetables. The shrimp didn't taste fresh but were still acceptable. The pork belly was solid but again a bit on the bland side. The other components of the dish were good and what made me very happy was that the vegetables were not overcooked. So the primary reason for the three start rating had to do with the fact that the food was just OK. I don't need a spiritual experience every time I eat out but based on so many reviews I was hoping for something with a little more wow factor. This is a good restaurant and they deliver a solid value for the money. You won't walk out hungry. I just wish they would push the envelope a bit on their seasonings. Oh, a small point for management. I expect to have my plates cleared when I'm finished with them. I shouldn't have to ask to have them removed.",0.9954,0.766,0.189,0.045,0.5384179894179895

Three different waiters, and they were all very nice, helpful, and attentive. So, let's start. Edamame: I love edamame anyways. Simple with salt. Nice starter. Crispy Brussels Sprout Salad: I cannot say enough good things about this. On all three different occasions, I brought different people.. And they all LOVED the salad. The sauce comes with diced shrimp. Sweet, but has hot peppers in it so it's very well balanced. Steamed Buns (pork belly): OMG. One of my favourite noms. Melt in your mouth pork, yummy pickled veggies, and of course the steamed buns were good.. Delicious! Lemongrass Beef Lollipops: So yummy. The pepper that comes on it really elevates the dish. The glaze on it was sweet and delicious, and I loved dipping it in the soy sauce. And it's cute how they're wrapped on a lemongrass. Haha. Tiger Shrimp Tempura: My sister, who loves the Panda Express version (ugh), absolutely LOVES this (as did I!). She said she could never go back. This dish is actually delicious. Perfect amount of sweetness, and I loved the walnuts. Brown rice: Typical.  Signature Crispy Rice (spicy tuna): I was afraid of tuna. I'm not a big fish person, but this really blew my mind. So simple, yet so delicious. Tako Taco: Eh. Wouldn't order again. The cilantro lime cream was really good, but I couldn't get over the salsa. It was so cold it was off putting. Stuffed Avocado: It was just okay. Wouldn't order again. Lobster and Wagyu: Ordered all three times. Amazingly yummy. Would order again and again! So much flavor, and actual lobster. Firecracker: I got this the last time I was there (about a week ago). Hands-down my favourite dish. It looks like there's way too much going on, but it works. And the avocado underneath was a nice surprise as was the chili threads. I am getting hungry thinking about it. Will order every single time. The teas they have here are so yummy. I've tried both the pomegranate and mango. I'd definitely choose mango. Less bitter, but both are worth the try. I've had four desserts here. A crème brûlée that was delicious. Can never go wrong with that. The green tea donuts were fluffy but eh, and I didn't like the chocolate it came with. We also got the vanilla ice cream in a carrot ginger shell with candied walnuts. DELICIOUS. Never had anything like it. Last, the mango sorbet with fresh fruit. My favourite.  Overall, I have had really nice experiences at this restaurant.

Garlic noodles dish has plenty of crab in it.   That is one thing I love about the east coast, you can get actually real crab meat in abundance.   The garlic noodles was a little wet and not enough seasoning for me.  I had to add soy sauce to it.   Personally, I prefer garlic noodles at Anqi in Costa Mesa or Crustaceans in Beverly Hills.

When she was questioned regarding her statement that she'd be seating us as soon as half the party arrived just five minutes ago, she shrugged her shoulders dismissively. Unacceptable. Do not say one thing and do another, especially when it's only been five minutes since our reservation time. We were forced to wait one hour for a table, and multiple times the hostess would point at random tables and say 'just wait until they get up, then we'll seat you'. Yeah, none of those tables were going anywhere anytime soon. Once we were seated, service was slow. Our waiter was barely there-- we received better service from the bussers. The food was excellent; the crispy rice with tuna and jalapeño were amazing, as were the firecracker rolls and edamame.

Entree: JIDORI CHICKEN INASAL Sunda Bento Box: Miso soup: good as any other place 4 piece california roll: good Jidori Chicken: good portion and cooked well. Unfortunately with such a thick cut of chicken breast, the flavor fails to seep into the meat. It came atop rice and tomatoes and I found myself wishing there was a sauce to dip it in.

When my mom was hesitant about the bussel sprout salad because she doesn't like brussel sprouts, we ended up ordering something different. Since I looked down about the fact that we didn't end up getting such a raved about dish, he ordered it for us anyway and told us that the dish was on him. Such a nice guy! The egg rolls were great and not too filling. I think we had trouble finishing it all because of the extra appetizer. Everything was amazing though. The pad Thai and crab fried rice were both non greasy and super delicious but I would suggest getting entrees from different parts of the menu like get a meat based and a carb based dish instead of both carb based dishes. The deserts were mostly green tea flavored but the special is usually something more common to American tastes. The donuts are amazing so please do not be intimidated by the green tea flavor!!

We started off with some edamame and drinks. I got the Hibiskus Hard Lemonade and he got the House of Bamboo. They were both impressive. A little gracious with the ice, but the taste was great and the servings pretty big. Then he got the Red Dragon roll and I got the California roll. My boyfriend has a big appetite, and the Red Dragon satisfied him. It was a nice serving with 8 large slices. My california roll was a bit smaller, but that satisfied me. They were all beautifully displayed. The ambiance was great. Lots of wood details, quiet and classy, felt upscale.

What attracted me originally was the fact that it is an upscale Asian restaurant, yet when they first opened, they were offering specials to bring people in. (I'm not a fan of paying for pricey downtown lunches on a regular work day, unless it's a special occasion.) I had the grilled salmon once and the panang chicken once, and both were cooked to perfection and very tasty! If coming for lunch, they also have a weekly special which is one entree for $8.88! On this particular trip I was with a group, so to share we ordered: -Edamame -Brussel Sprout salad -Steamed Buns with pork belly -Tempura Rock Shrimp I would have/could have enjoyed all of those, alone! I never used to be a fan of brussel sprouts, but lately I've been trying to get into them, and this salad is awesome! The combination of the vegetables with minced shrimp made this sooo tasty! After small portions all of those, I shared the baked snow crab roll and the rainbow roll with a friend, and they were fabulous!  Overall, Sunda is pricey and I can get comparable dishes at other Japanese/Thai restaurants for much less. (Especially pad thai and traditional sushi rolls.) What keeps me coming back is the quality, presentation, and the ambiance. I will continue to enjoy the lunch specials, and I can't wait to bring my husband here for a date night!",0.9881,0.841,0.143,0.016,0.5542864187094956

Never the less, note that there is valet parking for $14 just outside the restaurant and that the establishment is not wheel chair accessible. There are a four steps up to the main dining area and the rest rooms are down a steep flight of stairs. There is also a banquet room on the 2nd floor for events. Please note that if you are using a wheel chair or crutches, this would not be a pleasant climb up or down the stairs for you. With that said, when you walk in you are greeted with a beautifully decorated open space. To your immediate right, the bar area is a gorgeously decked out with sofa, tall tables, and almost floor to ceiling windows.  A noteworthy mention, the bartender/ mixolgist Nahm is phenomenal at blending a drink to your liking. Get to know the man. Let the man get to know you. You will be pleased with his craft and get an amazing drink that will leave you dreaming about it for your next outing. And always, tip your bartender well.  Moving along to the dining experience... the staff here are friendly, knowledgeable of the menus, and efficient. The only issue I had was that with service was that there was an up-charge with an item, which was not mentioned during the ordering process. Granted it was worth every penny, it would have been nice to not have a sticker shock at the end of the meal.  Must try items: Sunda Hand Roll, Signature Crispy Rice w/ spicy tuna and sliced jalapeño on top Pork belly skewers,and Kale & seaweed salad. Each dish was delicately paired with their respective ingredients, giving you the experience of the 5 senses(touch, taste, sight, smell, & hear). Delicious, but could pass on the next try: Seared Crab-Crusted Ahi Tuna sashimi.  The combination sounds amazing on the menu, but realistically, the creamy, yet crusty crab didn't work with the raw tuna. The Spicy ""Tail of two tunas"", also tasty, but not a fan of deep fried shallots. Maybe there will be a revisit just without the fried shallots, maybe not.  Pass: The Lucky Scallop, which was the special roll for the night. On paper it sounded great. You have tempura unagi, avocado & cream cheese, topped with seared scallops, tobiko, and mayo. The scallops were small, and not seared to perfection. In the end, it was just too rich with the dairy, the deep fried, and the extra drizzle of whipped delicious fat.  The meal was very filling.

2015-01-25,2.0,"Food was decent - expensive but good. For $9 a bite, it better be tasty.  Service - not so great.  Sit down, waiter asks, ""sparkling or still?""  This is a pretentious question in my mind (who actually drinks sparkling water in the United States??), and I am annoyed and say ""still is fine"", figuring he would bring a Pinterest-shaped bottle of tap water that he would leave at the table.  He brings us an $8 bottle of 'premium' (lol) water (which he opens out of sight), and starts pouring, knowing full well that we don't understand that we are receiving.  This is poor etiquette, especially at a nice restaurant (well, the prices would indicate ""nice restaurant"").  Halfway through the meal, the waiter OPENS A SECOND BOTTLE WITHOUT TELLING US, and continues re-filling our waters.  You can't bring me something I didn't order!  $16 for 'premium' water (for two people) - without ordering it - are you kidding me???  This is bad form at best, and deceitful at worst.  The bill arrives, I put down a credit card and a gift card. Waiter sees the gift card, asks ""how much is on it?"" Why are we talking about money in front of my date?!?! This is a nice restaurant - be classy.  Stealthily take the check and figure out what I mean.  It's a gift card and a credit card, this isn't rocket science. Just exhaust the gift card and put the rest on the credit card, don't you do this every day?  Instead, you put me in a difficult position - I have to weirdly avoid the question or acknowledge in front of my date that I'm using a gift card.  Wow.  Think before you speak.  Have a little tact.  Be on my team.  Be smooth.  Think about what's going on.  Never use 7 words when 4 will do.  It's obviously a date, just take the bill and disappear. Isn't this all on the syllabus of Waiting Tables 101?  I'm being a bit dramatic, but seriously, this move was not cool. The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 - the ambience is great.  I went on a Wednesday, and the place was absolutely buzzing.  Almost too loud for conversation at times.  Probaby the perfect volume for dinner/drinks before going out.",0.9881,0.692,0.191,0.118,0.6675073099415204
2015-01-23,3.0,"Que fancy. We arrived at 1700 for an early dinner (birthday treat, yay!). I love the place, it looks great, and is clean. I had the spicy tail of two tunas and snow cap rolls. I was absolutely smitten with my tuna roll, the snow cap roll left a little more to be desired, comparatively - perhaps I should have started with this one! I was completely satisfied with my food regardless, and the waitress was wonderful. She brought out a piece of birthday cake for me after we had finished! I have a huge sweet tooth so my review of this cake is completely biased, I can assure you however that I found it delicious! Took off a couple of stars secondary to the fact that I wish they had a few more sushi options, or some flexibility in ingredients. Also, the food was pretty pricy. Fine by me, I'm not one to complain about $$ if I feel it was justified. However, I'm not sure the prices here were entirely substantiated.

2015-01-21,5.0,"One of the best meals I've had in Chicago to date. I went with my roommate and boyfriend on industry night, and we all walked away SO happy. Let's start with drinks: we each had a lemon drop martini and a moscow mule. Both were very strong and very delicious.The boyfriend said they were each probably the best he's ever had. For food we got: Shiitake Edamame Dumplings (5)- yum! Different than many dumplings I've had, and creamy and mushroomy inside... mmm Oxtail potstickers (5)- also very good, meaty, delicate wrapper Flaked Pork Adobo Fried Rice- my roommate had been here before a requested we get 2 orders of these, but we convinced her to just get one and try another rice dish. We wish we would have gotten 2... not instead of the other... but just MORE. It was my favorite thing... the flavors were just amazing, there was plenty of pork in it, and a fried egg on top that we had the server mix into it. You can't go wrong with a fried egg. I would go back just for this dish alone. Signature Crispy Rice- Seared Waygu Tartare (4)- yum yum yum. Similar to a nigiri sushi, this dish has strips of sushi rice pan fried and crispy, with a strip of waygu beef tartare (SO SOFT AND DELISH) and a dot of pesto on top. Firecracker roll- Elaborate spicy roll, with lots of fixins, it was delicious, but we were bummed we didn't realize the middle part of it was guacamole you were supposed to top each one with until we were almost done. I thought it was another roll that got the most toppings there in the middle. Very tender, fresh sushi. We finished with the Sunda Sundae, which I'd never had anything like before. A delightful combination of 3 different kinds of ice cream, my favorite being the Ube-macapuno, layered over some other amazing things that you need to dig to the bottom to get. At $16, it's pricey, but we shared it no problem between 3 people, which makes it reasonable I think. Sharing is caring! The service was great, the servers were all there to serve us, and like a well orchestrated ballet. There are so many places to eat in Chicago and I could never hope to touch them all, which sometimes makes it so hard to get back to places, but this is one I'll definitely be returning to if I can.",0.9967,0.766,0.184,0.05,0.5690789473684211

Came here for my birthday dinner with my roommates and was pleasantly surprised by everything I ordered.  The service was fantastic and our waiter was very attentive to our asks. We had a round of drinks and I ordered the Strawberry Fields cocktail which was delicious and quite strong... delicious/strong enough that I ordered another one at the end of the meal.  As far as our meal, we went all out. Brussel Sprouts Salad - an absolute must. It was the most fantastic brussel sprouts salad I've ever had. They give a chilli sauce for vegetarians but honestly you could just eat the salad without any vinaigrette. SO flavorful. We devoured this dish. Sweet Potato Caterpillar Sushi Roll - this roll surprised me. I wasn't expecting that much sweet potato in each bite but it was a nice surprise. I enjoyed the red pepper puree on the top of each bite and it had an adorable presentation. I might try another sushi roll if/when I return to Sunda. Malay Style Tofu - I wish I took a picture of this dish because it was literally a big square chunk of tofu. The waiter said they spice it just like they spice their fish, so it was a unique blend of flavor and I actually couldn't stop eating it. It tasted very Indian and I enjoyed the sides on this plate a ton also.  Complimentary Birthday Cake - always a sweet addition. The waiter was nice enough to give us a cake with a candle and song for my birthday. I was so full at the end but it was a nice sweet touch to the end of the meal. Overall, great experience at Sunda. I think I would order some different dishes because they do have a special Vegan menu so there is much to choose from. I won't give up the brussel sprout salad though.",0.9979,0.762,0.238,0.0,0.6567042606516291
2015-01-12,3.0,"Sigh, I wanted so much to love Sunda... I've had this restaurant on my list of places to try since I've moved here. The New Asian menu has my name written allll over it. Perhaps, I built up too high of expectations. But, there comes a day when you get overwhelmed by the plethora of options and you happen to order all the wrong things. My visit to Sunda was that day :( Before, I jump into the food, I want to note that service was impressive. Our waiter was funny and attentive. He gave thoughtful recommendations and even brought a free slice of cake with a side of birthday singing (we mentioned it was my roommate's birthday). Also, the venue was colorful and fun, albeit a little crammed as some of the tables were too close to each other.  Now on to the food, I did vigorous stalking on Yelp to prepare my order for the night (Yes, I'm one of those people). Thankfully, one of my other roommates wanted to share food and let me do all the ordering so I was able to get a bit greedy with my selection: 1. First, the four of us ordered a round of cocktails to start the night off right. I ordered the Lychee Wasabi Cocktail. I consider myself adventurous when it comes to trying daring flavors, but the wasabi flavoring was way too overpowering and refused to let the Lychee shine. For a drink with a description that says ""hint of wasabi,"" I was certainly let down. Not off to a good start, especially at the ~$15/drink cost... But my roommates loved their Strawberry Fields and Blackberry Limeade drinks! 2. The whole table shared the Crispy Brussel Sprout Salad. Wow! My favorite of the night - hands down. The minced shrimp, fish sauce-based vinigrette was killer. We probably would've licked the plate for any remaining brussel sprout, red cabbage, carrot or fried shallot crumb if it was socially acceptable. These are beyond any other brussel sprout dish I've ever had, even Uchi (Houston). 3. Oxtail Dumplings. Saw this a lot on the Yelp Reviews and it was good, but not great. Personally, I thought the filling was kind of heavy and seemed to be an odd combination. 4. Garlic Crab Noodle. The biggest disappointment of the night! This is asian-italian gone wrong. I love garlic, but it did NOT do it for me in this dish. It got kind of mushy and felt so, so heavy. I couldn't relish all the chunks of crab because it got lost in the other extreme flavors. 5. Red Dragon: shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, unagi, jalapeño, avocado, tempura crispies, unagi sauce. Tasty! This was a good roll and had nice crunch and spice from the jalapeño. My other roommate had some sashimi and did not get her bang for the buck. In fact, this phrase applies to the overall experience. Sunda is quite the pricey establishment and, while I know this happened to be an off-ordering night for me, I'm not sure that I'd come back to give it another try.",0.9822,0.811,0.123,0.066,0.5578934901576411

2015-01-02,4.0,"We've been trying to get to Sunda for more than a year and finally had dinner there on a whim.  We had highs & lows to our experience, but overall - definitely a tally in the win column and we'll be back.  Here's how our 3 hour Sunda tour went (yes, almost 3 hours on a Monday night!  Yikes!). We had reservations for 8:30 pm and arrived with a minute to spare.  We were asked to have a seat at the bar while they prepared the table.  We seized the opportunity to try a couple of martinis.  My husband ordered 'The Jaded Heart' (no pun intended!) and I the Lychee Luxury Drop.  We both LOVED the green chartreuse flavor in his martini and mine was sweet & refreshing.  After about 15 min, the hostess came to let us know that our table was almost ready.  Five minutes later, she revisited to let us know we could either eat at the bar where we were or take a table in the lounge.  We were most interested in taking in the ambiance of the dining room (thus the reservation!) so we asked if we could wait for a table.  Again, she returned just after 9 and tried to sell us on eating at the bar, but we preferred to wait.  Miraculously, around 9:10 pm, we were shown to a table (which rocked like the Titanic on its last eve).  Our waiter did try to place some shims under the table, which helped a bit;  he also offered to move us to another table, but warned us it might be a while until one would be available.  We politely declined :)  Onto the food!  We started with the Dynamite Oysters and the Oxtail Pot Stickers.  Both were delish, but the Dynamite Oysters are extra special and I highly recommend them.   As for their Signature Sushi, our two must haves next time are the Lobster & Wagyu and the Baked Snow Crab Handrolls.  Both were absolutely amazing.  I wouldn't waste the tummy space on the basil shrimp sushi.  It was just ok, nothing special.  And I highly recommend avoiding the calories of the Crunchy Pig, Hidden Lobster.  It was mushy & sloppy & not much by way of fresh, distinct flavor.  The firecracker was a win too, but didn't rate as highly as the coveted Lobster & Wagyu or the Snow Crab hand rolls.   For dessert, we shared the Creme Brulee special, which was really wonderful and had a number of contrasting textures & flavors from the jack fruit & red beans to purple yam ice cream down to the creamy creme brulee base.  Definitely a winner & worth the calories! Overall, our server was very nice and made some great recommendations, but the timing of the different dishes was painful!  We ordered everything up front, but there were times we waited 15 - 20 minutes in between sushi dishes to arrive.  Each dish came separate, which was great and allowed us to experience each individually, but the wait time in between dishes was undesirable (the Sunda team could take a lesson or three from the Girl & The Goat on timing;  now there's a place that has it down!). So the timing was a bit disappointing and caused us to be there upwards of 3 hours.  We weren't expecting a quick dinner, but would much prefer to be around the 1.5 - 2 hour mark on a Monday night.  Also, although our waiter was very professional, some of the other staff were not.  While we were eating, several times we had wait staff reach across our plates/table while we were in the midst of dishing out sushi / eating.   Once I was mid bite and someone's arm came across mine.  Wow! We really enjoy sake, but don't know enough about it to order a great bottle and most often ask for a recommendation.  Our waiter highly recommended the Tyku Black.  It was very mild and uninspiring.  That was a $75 miss for us.  Next time, I'll order another cocktail or two and skip the saki since their martinis were so delish! So bummed I forgot to try the Bacon Old Fashioned, but something to look forward to on our next Sunda tour!  Despite the length of time of our experience and the misses on some of the dishes, there were some amazing dishes and cocktails that we'll have to experience again.  We'll be back!!",0.9991,0.783,0.18,0.036,0.45427054154995317

I only tried the crunchy pig hidden lobster sushi (yes that's right, I said CRUNCHY PIG HIDDEN LOBSTER SUSHI!!!) and the flaked pork adobo fried rice. The reason I only tried these two things is because they were both so freaking amazing that I could not stop eating them!!! For dessert I shared the green tea donuts with a friend, which were good but nothing spectacular. My French martini was fabulous, though, so it compensated for the lackluster donuts. It was a great dining experience overall, and pricing wasn't too inflated. I will definitely be back here.",0.9937,0.685,0.286,0.029,0.5767316017316018

2014-12-16,2.0,"Sunda is overrated to the max! 1. The food is mediocre. My main gripe is that they don't seem to understand how to treat ingredients that really shine when prepared simply. Sushi here is bland and below average quality. Bone marrow here is taken out of the bone and mixed with breadcrumbs. Uni is fried and stuffed into stiff indistinguishable leaves of some sort. Come on, Sunda, these beautiful ingredients are no brainers! They even have an overly sweet ice cream sundae that they call ""Ridiculous."" Talk about ego. 2. Service is slow and rude. Let me give you an example. Last time I was here, I ordered an uni appetizer and was given a salmon one instead. When I told the waitress about the error (after waiting for a long time for her to return to our table), she brusquely said, ""Oh...so you wanted the uni too?"" ""No, I just wanted the uni,"" I replied. After another 20-25 minutes of waiting, I received some fowl-smelling brown uni. The worst part of it was the end of the meal discovered that I was charged for the appetizer I didn't order. But this is not a totally isolated experience. Each time I am here, I consistently underwhelmed with the service. Overall, this place is a disappointment.",-0.5778,0.857,0.063,0.08,0.5195238095238095

After the drinks we waited for another 25 minutes and then we were offered free appetizers when we were seated. Around 10:05pm we were finally sat. There was already appetizers at the table for us. The brussel sprout salad was my favorite appetizer. We order several rolls for the table for everyone to share. The ""tail of 2 tunas"" was my favorite. The meat and lobster was my least favorite. It had a good flavor but it was too heavy to be considered ""sushi"". Overall, I thought the pricing was high for each roll. We were also comped dessert, so we can creme brulee and green tea donuts. The donuts were light and fluffy. The creme brulee was unique to say the least. It had jelly beans on it...

2014-11-26,4.0,"This place is a prime example of how everything deserves a second chance. I came here for dinner and drinks my first time over a year ago. We ordered a bunch of things, but i found everything to be standard and main draw back, over-priced. You can be over-priced, but you better be damn good to charge 1.5-2 times more than other places. Place is super trendy and really rowdy, which is kind of a turnoff for me. Decor and atmosphere wise, it's just another contemporary Asian fusion restaurant. Good looking, hip crowd. I came here for the second time a week ago. We ordered 10 dishes and a bunch of drinks. This time, everything tasted MUCH better and were more memorable. I don't think they changed chefs, so not sure what happened the first time. Drinks here are extremely pricey, on avg $15/cocktail, containing minimal alcohol, which annoys me. They sure are tasty though, so if you're a lightweight, these are perfect. Pity, i'm not.   Drinks: Peared Sake and Grass Tiger (spicy kick to it), both were SO incredibly tasty. Food standouts: Crispy Brussel Sprouts. I know brussel sprouts are now offered at every trendy restaurant, BUT THESE, holy guacamole, are the most delicious, burst of flavor, makes me only want more with every bite. Miso Bronzed Black Cod: IMO, best dish they have. It's $35, but you will be blown away. GET THIS!!! You will be glad you did. Meat is silky and just melts in your mouth. I could daydream about this all day.  Other memorable dishes were the Malay-Style Chilean Seabass, but i'm not a huge fan of the curry sauce mixed with my chilean seabass. Curry is too bold, and sorta overshadows the taste of the fish. Pork Adobo Fried Rice was scrumptious, a tad oily and heavy, but great portion for the price! Panang Chicken Curry, loved the spices used and the milky broth. Kinda spicy though. Service was exceptional given how busy they are. Our server checked up on us numerous times, filled our waters promptly, and was easy to get a hold of.  Presentation was spot on, too, for drinks and food, even for the apps.

2014-11-23,5.0,"I've been to Sunda on a few occasions for work. The owner of Rockit Ranch Productions (which Sunda is part of) is also a board member for the organization I work for, the American Liver Foundation Great Lakes Division.  Every time I've been to Sunda so far, I've been for a board meeting and eaten in their private upstairs room. The private upstairs room can comfortably seat 40 people yet it's still comforting and inviting. I'm sure you could fit more. There's a bar in the corner and usually one or two staff members work it during our meetings. They are always super cool and very attentive people. I've never met a staff member at Sunda that I didn't really like. There's a flat screen on one end of the room which is perfect for sharing presentations or videos. The space is great for any meeting - it's secluded so there's no lingering noise creeping up from the downstairs dining room.  Now on to the fun part....the food! As we go for board meetings, they usually serve us a prix fixe menu of sorts in a family dinner setting. We're all just passing around dishes and serving ourselves. The table service sets the perfect tone for the meeting as it's closed-door. That said, we have the best board members so doing a family style anything doesn't feel odd in the least. It makes for a great and intimate setting.  On to my favorite menu items.... - lemongrass beef lollipops - brussel sprout salad - any sushi they put in front of me (I am never the one to choose the menu if the staff get the opportunity. Thank God, I have colleagues who enjoy good food as much - or more - than I do!) To be honest, I've never really noticed the main dining room as I'm always just walking through to get to the private upstairs room or to leave after the meeting.

The Bloody Mary bar also looked totally legit...you get to create your own by adding all the toppings you want. Pretty cool.

It's creamy, warm texture and the hint of candied walnuts make for a fun play on an otherwise ordinary dish.  For my main course I tried the braised pork belly on crispy rice patty. WOW this was killer...the pork belly was so tender it could fall apart just by looking at it. Then add an egg with some sunda sauce on top of a bed of sticky rice? Pure perfection. If you are brunching at Sunda, this is the meal to try! Also worthy to note was their chicken pad Thai...the generous portion of classic pad Thai definitely did not disappoint.

The brussel sprouts salad was prepared such that many of the ""leaves"" of the sprouts were freely floating (they were no longer attached to the stem), which made the dish light and airy.  What tied it all together was the dressing, so flavorful with sweetness and acidity that worked delightfully. If you like brussels sprouts, this is a dish you CANNOT miss.   The other dishes were well prepared (but you know which dish was my favorite), the ambience was hip and new, and the service was friendly and attentive; what you would expect of a restaurant that looks the way it does with the price points they offer.  It was all on par with my expectations, except the brussels sprouts salad blew me away (if that wasn't obvious).",0.9883,0.815,0.165,0.02,0.5910287081339713

The nigiri was okay.  I went with a few of my common choices that I use to judge sushi service.  Tako was firm but not chewy, well done.  The maguro, uni, and sake was fairly standard, nothing special either good or bad. The ikura was firm with a good amount of salt and rich flavor.  Rice was average with a su that was fairly midline.  The saba was slightly mealy and tasted more of vinegar rather than of the mackerel.

I cannot wait to go back. So we're there any negatives????... A few but no reason to remove any stars. They are normally busy and the tables are pretty close together. So be prepared to sit close to your guests especially if you have a large party. It's a beautiful intimate atmosphere so you may actually love that part! The valet is somewhat slow, but you can always pay to park and walk a few blocks.  I love this place and guess what??? ... I'm allergic to all seafood! Yep that's right... I can't even enjoy the seafood and this place is still on my top 10 list in Chicago. Go check it out! Thanks Amelia and Nahm!!!",0.9937,0.709,0.233,0.058,0.583126984126984

The garlic noodle is absolutely delicious. The duck fried rice was actually impressive too. My favorite though was the pork belly - large portions of 8oz! The salmon was OK. Felt like a fried dumpling wrapped around a salmon.  The best was probably the pancit noodles. It came with pork belly and shrimp and hit the spot.

It was impossible to hear anyone, even across the table.  They play music here and the noise level means all you can hear of it is the low rumble.  The music doesn't do much more than make everyone yell louder in order to be heard over top of it.   The food makes this place quite enjoyable, but the noise level precludes any kind of romantic evening or even casual conversation.  I'd steer clear.",0.9502,0.815,0.163,0.021,0.6240852130325815
2014-10-07,4.0,"I'm still in a food coma as I am writing this review for Sunda, so my review may be slightly biased. Two of my friends and I decided to have dinner at Sunda earlier tonight, and we were the first patrons for dinner service. We arrived five minutes before their opening time of 5 p.m., and the hostess allowed us to sit at the bar until the tables had been set. I watched as the servers set the tables with great care: plates, cutlery, chopsticks, glasses, and a black napkin. Another hostess then came and escorted us to our table. Our server came and asked if we wanted bottled or tap water, and we chose tap water. Water service was excellent as our glasses were consistently refreshed.  We had heard about the happy hour specials, and that had enticed us to come to Sunda instead of Roka across the street. However, the happy hour specials on the Sunda Social menu available online are only available in the bar or adjacent lounge. Our server brought us the social menu, and it wasn't as impressive as the dinner menu. We opted to stay at our table, and ordered three menu items: crispy brussels sprouts salad, summer garden cut roll, and chili albacore sashimi. The sashimi was my fourth ""raw"" meal in four days, starting with the raw bar at the Hubbard Inn. Knock on wood, I've been in good health, but I'm always a little bit hesitant when it comes to raw seafood and meat.  The items were prepared well, and came in good portion sizes for three people to have a three-course ""tasting menu."" Sashimi with 8 slices of albacore, 3 cups of salad, and 4 pieces of the roll. The salad lived up to its hype: It's almost like eating fried veggies! There's just a bit of a char to the brussel sprouts, and the dressing comes on the side, so you can dress your salad as much or as little as you would like. Our server offered to mix the salad and dressing for us, but I just jumped in and poured the cup over the salad and my friend and I blended the salad with the two serving spoons.  We opted against dessert, but there is a new smore-inspired dessert that is served in a mason jar.  I recommend Sunda for casual get-togethers with friends, family, and co-workers. Its loud, as many other Yelpers have indicated, so perhaps not the best venue for date nights or to hold a conversation.",0.9831,0.875,0.099,0.026,0.4950804571772314

2014-09-28,3.0,"Ok, so I came  back a second time to Sunda, this time for a cousin's birthday and sad to say, my rating of this place has not changed.  Couple of highlights from this time's experience: 1. Servers are incredibly busy and may not provide each table the attention it needs - our server took half the drink order and then disappeared to pick up the tab from another table. There were 8 ppl in our group and it was literally 15-20 min between when the first person got their meal to the last person.  2. I ordered the Chilean sea bass this time and was clearly disappointed with the lack of a flavor profile in the fish (and the accompanying cauliflower and tomatoes), felt like I should have ordered the beef long ribs, which were a hit at the table and 10 bucks cheaper!!! 3. Coffee, supposedly from La Colombe, but a friend from Colombia confirmed it wasn't (at least his cup). 4. Finally, given it was a cousin's birthday, we brought in a cake, which was brought out at the end of the meal and served up separately (cut and plated by the kitchen subsequently). Imagine our surprise when we saw a $5 cake cutting charge per person (40 bucks total) on our bill at the very end. When we asked our server why we weren't informed before, she smiled and said it was the restaurant policy.  So now, I've had two not so great dining and service experiences at Sunda - I will definitely not be back for a third time!!!",0.8385,0.866,0.08,0.054,0.4257575757575758

2014-09-24,3.0,"Bad first time experience here although food for the most part was good. I feel like this can often be a special occasion restaurant so having a bad service experience can kind of sour one on the place. Came for an anniversary dinner which they were aware of. Our food was pretty good, with our favorites being the mushroom medley, mushroom miso soup and miso eggplant cod. Not all of it we liked however and we were not a fan of the citrus scallops as the sauce was a bit overpowering and the sweet potato cauliflower roll was a bit dull tasting and unexpectedly cold (usually expect sweet potato roll to be on the warmer side). Drinks were tasty including the peared sake and yuzu whiskey sour. Everything was going fine until service issues began when one of the rolls my girlfriend ordered was never brought out. We were wondering what happened to it or our server which we hadn't seen for probably at least 15 minutes by that point. This was close to the restaurant's closing time at 11 pm, at which point the bus boys were clearing our table and we mentioned we hadn't seen our server or received our last roll. Then it turned out the server was dealing with a large party which was having payment problems. It was a bit disappointing that nobody else came to take care of us, and that all of our food wasn't brought out. The kitchen was at this point closed so it couldn't be brought out then. The server was still dealing with the payment problems with the other table so the bus boy had to get the MOD to take over. While he did offer us some desserts, we weren't even aware of what was available and felt bad about having the kitchen bring out food since it was past 11 so we just turned it down. He was nice enough to comp a couple of drinks and the most expensive plate we had ordered which was appreciated and I can't complain about that. 5 minutes after that our server finally rushed over apologizing about being gone, and wished us a happy anniversary which would have been nice to hear at the beginning maybe not after we were a little confused and frustrated about the missing food and server. I liked Sunda but it was just a bummer to have the service issues pop-up towards the end and especially during a special occasion.

We had the crispy brussels sprout salad, it was good. The rolls were meh, not a lot of taste and the fish didn't seem as fresh as I would have liked. We also ordered a spicy citrus scallop dish which was horrid. I could not eat it. Raw slimy scallop, doused in a redish lemony sauce on lettuce and in a rice cracker cup. Texture and taste ughhhhh. This dish just sealed the deal for me. Service was inconsistent. We wanted a bottle of wine and asked to taste it before we ordered the whole bottle. Our waitress seemed annoyed by that and very rushed to get to other patrons. I asked for a gluten free menu and she looked at me like I was crazy (they do have one and its advertised on their website).

Sushi was OK ... Salmon was dark orange (not fresh). The service was good but No-one could do anything but spout off their favorites which many times were not fish related.   This is just another trendy unauthentic place.

No suggestion to go to the bar, no apology- and FYI there's no place to sit in the restaurant by the hostess stand so we just stood around.

This was honestly some of the best sushi I've had in years, but I have to put it out there that the prices are very high. Most rolls are around $18 and you will want to try a few different things on the menu if you're like me. We dined with a group of 10, everyone has 2-3 dishes and cocktails, and we racked up quite a large bill, but everyone was in agreement with how fantastic the quality of their ingredients were and amazing flavor combinations (surprises like mango and chili sauce were scattered throughout the menu!). I would recommend the stuffed avocado plate; this was by far the most interesting and delicious thing I tried all evening. The variety of sashimi I tried was great quality and very fresh.

I first had the lychee drop, oh gosh who would think of adding wasabi to a drink. Pure genius!!!! I literally had 4 of those drinks. I wanted to change it up and get the cucumber drink but nothin compares to that drink. I think from now on I'm going to ask if they can add wasabi to a drink and see if its good.  Clearly the best drink and the right kick.  I had some things I wanted to order in mind and the waiter offered suggestions and I clearly changed everything. I ordered the spicy edamame, tempura shrimp with candied walnuts and the red dragon roll. I wanted the crusted sea bass but I had sea bass the previous day. I didn't see any mentions About the sea bass but I did about sushi so I decided to stick with that. Let's say everything comes out fast so don't get comfortable eating and talking. I love how quick everything comes.  Spicy edamame, awesome Tempura shrimp with candied walnuts, not bad, I've had something similar from a different type of Asian fusion so nothing made me go gaga, but you do get a good serving of it. Red dragon, was not bad. I've had some awesome sushi but this was not bad.

It's rude to drive your costumers away when we were still eating and ordering food and drinks. They should not take reservations. I would not advise groups to go there if they plan tp talk and enjoy each other's company. The food was not exceptional to begin with, rather mediocre, in fact. The ""crispy duck fied rice"" was greasy, not crispy. How can it be when they removed the duck skin which is the only thing that would make the dish crispy? Same thing with ""crispy pata"" (pork hock), a delicacy in the Philippines whic is famous there because of the crispy skin. They removed the skin also. Very bad dining experience all around.

Living in LA for a few years, I worked at one of the top sushi/asian restaurants in the city... I would like to say that I have a pretty solid pallet for asian food and know a high-quality meal from a mediocre one.  That being said, this was very middle of the road for me and man, am I disappointed.  My boyfriend took me here for my birthday - made the reservation ahead of time and told them it was my big 3-0... I mean.. 2-1. We arrived on time and had to wait - our table wasn't quite ready, no biggie. The menu is pretty huge... and we took total advantage of this ordering a few different dishes from every section - hey, it's my bday we going all out, san! Before I dive into the dishes here, I'll say that our server was OK.  Friendly enough, attentive, etc.  However, it was a little disappointing that he didn't look at the reservation notes or say anything about my special day as the server next to us did for their table.  Guess I am not as special as that person. Now, for the food - we started off with a salad, the BANG! BANG!, which was actually one of the highlights of our meal- and that never happens and I'm not sure it should... I appreciate the quality of the greens - but the other food should have trumped the salad.. I mean c'mon! What I was most excited for out of the many dishes, was the spicy tuna on crispy rice and the sea bass - I FREAKING LOVE SEA BASS.  And sadly, these were my least two favorite dishes of the meal.  I have seen people ranting and raving over the crispy rice on Yelp, and I want to know - were you all drunk?  This was the most disappointing crispy rice I have ever had. It lacked in flavor and when you say crispy rice - then it should be CRISPY rice, not a soggy, tasteless blob. Wah. I'm still sad over this.   The MALAY-STYLE CHILEAN SEABASS, which costs you $35 freaking bucks, was sadly seasoned and overall underwhelming.  The curried cauliflower puree definitely over shadowed the fish. None of the rolls were anything to write home about - flavors didn't always work well together and they really lacked in having that burst of flavor you wish to get when you bite into a roll. The wagyu beef is not true Japaneese wagyu beef, it's the American's sad version of it.  Don't pay that kind of money unless you're getting the real thing... you dig? Before I leave you with only negativity here, let me tell you that there were two dishes that stood out from the rest - those being the tatakis. The SALMON TATAKI and the BLACK TRUFFLE TUNA TATAKI were definitely delish. If I was to return- I would steer down that route for the majority of my dishes again. Over all - I feel like I wasted a decent amount of money on dishes that were not worth it - such a let down.",-0.8752,0.808,0.093,0.099,0.5313988095238095

I would really recommend this place for those who go out on a Saturday night and want a trendier more lively place to eat and hang out at. We sat in a larger table against the wall right next to Billy Dec!! To those who don't know, he is the owner of Sunda and a number of other bomb ass Chicago restaurants! So the first half hour of our dining experience was us discussing Billy's attire and what we need to do to be Billy... We also enjoyed watching 30-something year old women try to get his attention and throwing their business cards at him... pretty entertaining. I guess you can say, the people watching here is great! As for the dining experience and food, also just as great. We had one item that we sent back(7 spice fried chicken) because it didn't fit with our taste buds that night but the server was very nice and accommodating and quickly sent us out something else. The stand out items were the delicious bottle of rose we had(of course I cant remember the name which makes the mention of it kind of pointless) and the crispy pig, hidden lobster roll. This thing was an Asian twist on all my favorite items: lobster, jalapenos and bacon. I could have just had seven plates of this roll and watched Billy and be a very happy woman.

2014-06-29,3.0,"Sunda is the place to see and be seen, but mostly for the see.  I'm always weary of ""Asian Fusion"" places because most of the time, quality suffers from the shear quantity of dishes represented from several countries.  Of course, I have to give props from featuring some staple Filipino dishes like the Lumpia, Crispy Pata (one of my favorite Filipino dishes ever), pork belly BBQ, Pancit Canton, and Pork Adobo Fried Rice. Gave Sunda another try after barely remembering the first go a few years back because they were participating in the Yelp Summer of Sushi.   Definitely nice atmosphere and décor.  The cocktails were a little too sweet - I tried the Strawberry Fields and felt like I was drinking a syrupy daquiri. I do remember how good the Sunda Signature Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna sushi was, which was still the case.  Generous mounds of tuna atop crispy sushi rice make for a great contrast in textures.  We also tried the Summer Roll, which the featured roll for the sushi deal, but it wasn't as good.  I don't think spinach and sushi mix in a roll well.  Hubby ordered the Wok Fired Shishito Peppers, which were on the over soy-sauced and salty side.  We shared the Tiger Shrimp Tempura, which was my second favorite dish.  I'm a sucker for crispy shrimp tossed in a sweet sauce and candied nuts like walnuts or pecans.  An order of Kai-Lan completed the meal.  Although it was a side, it arrived last.  I liked how it wasn't drowning in oyster sauce.  The dishes were definitely on the small side, but that was enough food for the two of us.  I forgot that rice was a la carte here; maybe it was good we didn't order any, but if we did the crispy duck fried rice looked tasty. We completed the meal with the Sunda Sundae, which was a gourmet halo-halo.  The description on the menu says it all: avocado ice cream, sweet corn and cheddar cheese ice cream, ube-macapuno ice cream, calamansi granita, sweet beans, jackfruit, coconut gel, sweetened condensed milk, fresh berries, and toasted coconut.  You had me at avocado ice cream and sweet corn and cheddar cheese ice cream, which my Lola used to make for us when we spent summers in the motherland.  The calamansi granita was a surprisingly refreshing twist.  I also wanted to try the pistachio Sans Rival, but perhaps that will be enough to lure me back to this place in another few years.",0.9965,0.783,0.177,0.041,0.48000000000000015
2014-06-27,4.0,"Food is good, good, good! But restaurant is loud, loud, loud! I read some of the reviews about Sunda and most of the reviews are spot on with the food, décor, atmosphere and specifically the noise level. I came here for dinner on a Monday evening at 8pm and the restaurant was packed to the brim, but good thing I had made reservations so my guest and I were seated a few minutes after we arrived. YES, be smart and make reservations for Sunda and don't be a restaurant newbie, like some reviewers, who expect to get a seat without a reservation. Sunda was definitely alive and kicking. The crowd was boisterous, to say the least, and everyone was very trendy looking. Don't take ""trendy"" as code word for ""they have a dress code"" though because from what I saw they don't! I saw some individuals with sneakers on and even one with a backwards snapback cap, however a majority of the crowd was dressed ""appropriately"" for a trendy restaurant. Most men were wearing button-downs with jeans and shoes and women were in skirts, blouses, dress shirts or dresses. As I said, it was trendy, but in no way ""dressy"". It seemed a majority of the customers were from the after work crowd, looking to grab a drink, dinner and nighttime chat. There were a lot of groups as well hanging out together. As for the food, it's what you'd expect from an Asian fusion restaurant. It looks like Asian food, taste like Asian food, but is a copycat. Sunda does a good job of giving the customers what they want in that the food is Asian-inspired with ""Asian ingredients"", but it's obvious it caters to the non-Asian fan base. During dinner, we ordered the following: Firecracker Special Roll, Scorpion Shrimp Roll - Fancy looking sushi rolls, but nothing special that I can remember. They were really good and the pieces WERE huge, but I could've easily ordered this at a 50% sushi restaurant.  Tiger Shrimp Tempura - Reminded me of Honey Walnut Shrimp with Mayonnaise served at Chinese restaurants, minus the mayonnaise. The shrimp had a small crunchy cackle, but was glazed really well. I probably could've ate 100 pieces of this easily! Sunda Steamed Buns with Pork Belly - The buns were huge and they weren't stingy on the pork belly either. The pork belly was juicy, extremely flavorful and fit perfectly into the bun.  Miso-Bronzed Black Cod - The fish was so soft and moist. The moment I dug my fork into it, the pieces would just fall right off because it was so delicate. The flavor was amazing and very fresh. Crispy Duck Fried Rice - By the time we got to this, we were full, but I squeezed in a few bites and it wasn't spectacular. It was unimpressive with the extremely small pieces of roast duck and other side ingredients. I wish they would've did a little bit more with this dish. Sunda Sundae - We topped off the night with this smorgasborg sundae. For those not in the know, it basically is a loose interpretation of a ""halo halo"", the infamous Filipino dessert. However, it was a bit different in that there was avocado ice cream and cheddar cheese ice cream, which I have NEVER ever tasted before! Other than that, most of the other ingredients, ube ice cream, sweet beans, jackfruit, sweet corn and condensed milk were all too familiar. The creation was still unique and quite picturesque. It was the perfect dessert to end our meal. Despite the deafening noise levels, the food was overall pretty good, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was great! If you plan on having a romantic dinner here, I recommend doing a complete 180 because this is not the spot. However, if you want to have a good time with some friends and have a good chat, this restaurant is more suited for that.

In terms if drinks, we each got Dirty Martinis which were made perfectly!  Our unfortunate complaint is due to our waitresses attitude. She started out very pleasant and helpful but at the meal went on she became very annoyed of us and was not attentive to us. We asked for a round of saki bombs to celebrate the graduation (we didn't plan to do them full on by knocking the table, just to pour the sake into the beer) and she just stared at my husband for a minute. He asked again and she claimed, very rudely, that she had never heard of them before and that within her year of working there she had never had anyone order them. We explained what they were and she again, stared at us. Finally we just asked her if she could ask the bartender for them. A few minutes later she came back with them and then pretty much never came back to our table and charged us for two full sake bottles (when it was only three sake cup fills) and two full beers. Of course she was uber polite and friendly again when she brought us our check.  If it weren't for the service we would have really enjoyed our meal to celebrate my husband's accomplishment.

2014-06-09,3.0,"********************* 1112 ********************       Sunda is a swanky, modern, New Asian and modern Japanese restaurant. It's a popular spot in Chicago and it's literally across from Roka Akor which successfully opened in San Francisco recently.       We had RSVP and came in. We thought we go the table for 2, but they said my default OpenTable prefer chef table, but no one ever called me to confirm what I prefer. And Sushi counter is not a chef table, unless the chef was there which he wasn't.     The hostess didn't bother to ask what would we like to do. She flatted out to tell us NO. Then asked us to wait for a 5 minutes, came back and offered us a high top at the lounge, seriously?  I didn't think so. It was a SAT night. This is why I rarely dine out on SAT night, only when I'm traveling.       Sunda is a PRICIER modern Asian and Japanese restaurant, offer dishes from Dim Sum to PHO, from Thai soup to Sushi/Sashimi. If you come here to eat just rolls, you will be filling up quickly but if you order more finer dishes, dinner for 2 with 2 cocktails would take you to average $250. Now if you order a bottle of Opus One here for additional $400, it'll be over the top.      We weren't happy with where we were seated, but we ordered plenty of food anyway.  HIT  - UNAGI/FOIE freshwater eel tempura, seared foie gras,  yuzu unagi sauce - this was a nice dish, reminded me of the late Japonaise in Chicago back on its hay day.  - SUNDA'S SIGNATURE CRISPY RICE pan-fried sushi rice glazed with soy sauce  and topped with SPICY TUNA jalapeño - you see this dish in a lot of Modern Sushi places now. This was  a solid dish.  - BAKED SNOW CRAB HANDROLL Alaskan snow crab, tempura crispy, dynamite sauce. My friend loved this dish. I love the soy paper wrap, it makes a different.  - Uni from Japan, fresh, nice texture and tasty for only $10 2 pieces sushi. - Torched Wagyu beef was delicious, thinly cut, and perfectly done the way we requested. - Miso glazed black cod was cooked perfectly, moist and almost raw center, tasty, and nice.  MISS - Miso Soup with mushroom - salty - CITRUS SCALLOPS - Hokkaido scallop sashimi, avocado, rice cracker, lime,  banana sauce - this was a really off dish, overpowering by the sauce, I could barely taste the fresh and sweetness of Hokkaido scallop. - SUNDA'S YELLOWTAIL JALAPEÑO Japanese salsa, extra virgin olive oil, ponzu - too much sauce, it killed the dish. - Escolar sushi was dry.  COCKTAILS & DRINKS Cocktails is $13-$16 each  - LYCHEE LUXURY DROP absolute, st. germain, lemon juice, lychee syrup, hint of wasabi was an interesting. - Johnnie Walker Blue $55, Macallan 18 Yr $27, Yamazaki 18 Yr $30, so you are better off with after dinner libation drinks here.       Sunda was extremely loud with the crowd and music blasting. We weren't enjoyed the food and drink as much, but our wonderful server BEN, surely saved the night for us. He got a British accent, handsome, tall guy, look like an aspiring actor/model does this for living while pursuing his dream. He was kind to knee down to listen to us, each time we ordered or requested anything.      He was decanted our 2003 Opus One wine correctly. And you know how I'm with wines and ""Champagne"" (Champagne is a region name, in France, not a type of wine or drink, haha).       Ben accommodated our food and drink requests. I'm sure if he was the manager in charge, he could have moved us to a table on the dining floor too.       I wouldn't come back because there're plenty of good Japanese restaurants around Chicago and for this price point, I would get better food elsewhere. However, I would come back just for this server Ben. the extra STAR is for his impeccable service. Ben surely made our evening at Sunda.  P.S.

Had at least 5 different signature rolls and none of them were very memorable which is why I won't even bother naming them. However the brussel sprout salad and the tuna on top of fried sushi rice were tasty. After the apps, I was pretty apprehensive of anything too Asian sounding and rightfully so. I ordered the beef long rib which was tender and had a delicious sweet sauce. The others at my table were quite dissatisfied with their meals. One bite of the seven spice chicken had me gagging - it tasted like licorice.  he chef did a crazy bad job tinkering with the flavors and my friend said he would rather have eaten vegan chicken nuggets. Another patron had the pho which was edible, but tasted nothing like the traditional. It got two visible thumbs down.

2014-06-02,5.0,"I'll start with this, my boyfriend is infamous here for his many, many, many past dates at Sunda. As always, I chose to overlook his philandering past and instead concentrated on the delicious sushi and outstanding service at Sunda. If you have the chance to, sit at the bar and get Nahm as your drink slinger/server. He is the man. No other way to say it. If you don't want one of the many carefully crafted cocktails on the menu, simply tell Nahm what kind of alcohol you want, and he makes the magic happen.  While you discuss the finer points of existence with your dinner company (Nahm included) enjoy the steamed pork buns with pickled veggies. Amazingly succulent pork belly surrounded by flavorful pickled veggies are encompassed in a pillowy soft bun, all perfectly balanced and two-bite sized. Not to miss. If you still want some more pork, get the pork fried rice. Get it even if you don't want anymore pork, because it it outstanding. Served with a friend egg on top, this rice is sticky, sweet and spicy and the egg just binds all the flavors together is heavenly harmony. For sushi, we got the firecracker and the scorpion rolls and the snow crab hand roll. All were out of this world good. I love the tempura and spice of both the firecracker and the scorpion rolls while the snow crab roll was a great palate cleanser after so much flavor.  The atmosphere at Sunda is like the food, undeniably cool with just enough sexiness thrown in. I can totally see why my lovely boyfriend has taken so many past ""dates"" here. But he certainly isn't the only guy. Looking around the restaurant this seemed to the be first and second date hotspot (and yes, you can always tell what number of date it is). It makes sense though, food is good, price is high enough to say ""I can afford more than a Big Mac"" but not high enough for your credit card to get declined.

2014-05-29,2.0,"Yelp is of course not infallible and perhaps for the majority of peeps the rating for Sunda is about right. For us though, it was not right. The place is pricey but we knew that going in and it wasn't too big of an issue. You gotta pay a little extra for location and ""dazzling"" food. Unfortunately the food was far from dazzling, there were some nearly highlights but also some extremely lowlights (if that is even a word) The place was very loud even though it wasn't at capacity. Sitting across the table was about the max. distance where you could hear each other, thus it felt more like a bar and less like a nice restaurant. It's also fairly dimly lit for mood lighting but you can still read the menu. The menu is quite extensive but I couldn't help feel that less is more in terms of the items on offer. Guess it caters to the masses, rather than make a few dishes well, they've gone for making many dishes so-so. We tried a smattering of items off various parts of the menu. The free check in appetizer was pretty poor. They were basically jalapenos lightly cooked, lacking in batter and much taste/texture. It was ""free"" so not a huge surprise. Beef lollipops - mince meat on lemongrass. It was ok but for $18?! Tiger shrimp - the portion size was good, the shrimps were not tiger size, more kitten sized. Taste was ok, a fancier honey walnut shrimp. Hamachi Tartare - probably one of my favorite dishes we ordered. It did taste quite fishy (I don't mind that too much) which suggested it was not super fresh but I did like the taste. Crispy Duck Fried Rice - I liked this dish but the name is a bit of a stretch. Good luck finding any crispy duck skin in this dish. There are tasty pieces of duck but we were hard pressed to find any crispy duck. Crispy Rice Tuna - probably my wife's favorite. Pretty much what it says on the tin. The tuna was very tasty. Tail of 2 Tunas - following on from the crispy rice tuna, this was a nice tasting roll. However the consistency was lacking. It looked like it had been rolled by a child and then squashed. Pig Lobster roll - this was also a tasty roll but also suffered from presentation issues. One piece was 50% larger than another. Maybe that is nit-picking but that was quite a discrepancy (it wasn't an end piece) Based on the above alone, I'd probably give it 3 stars but to add to the downside, there was the timing issue. We were sat promptly and a server was over soon after. That was good and courteous. We ordered some items off the menu and our temporary server looked to be in a rush and before we could finish ordering, we were cut off and said, that's a good start and he dashed off. Our new server was harder to find and looked to have too many tables to manage. We did order the rolls at that later time. Some of the dishes came out in a timely manner but for some reason the last 4 things we ordered came out over 45 mins. after we ordered them. This meant an empty table for over half an hour. We were not really sure why, perhaps they had to cook a fresh batch of rice in a rice cooker and that took half an hour? Either way we were not informed and had to chase down the server to get a reason (none was given). Given this place is $$$, I am a believer in you get what you pay for, whether it be in good food, service etc. If this restaurant is likening itself to Panda Express then it should be $. If it's supposed to be going more down the $$$ path, then I would expect much more value wise. We wanted to try this place out and we did.

Also had the Signature Crispy Rice, topped with a nice hunk of wagyu. Highly recommended. The citrus scallops came in an edible rice bowl and had a ceviche like taste. Beef lollipops came wrapped around a lemongrass stick with a tasty sauce.

We ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts salad, hidden lobster crunchy pig roll, and the beef lemongrass lollipops. I really liked the Brussels sprouts salad-- it was an example of how a creative Asian spin on the dish can make something so delicious and different. This was my favorite dish of the night. But the beef lollipops were just ok, and the sushi roll we got also was just ok. We ordered the green tea donuts too, but there was barely any green tea flavor to it.

2014-04-08,2.0,"This was my first time at Sunda and my boyfriend's second. He thought it was OK but knew I wanted to give it a try so we went for my birthday. Make reservations, it was very busy on a Saturday night. There were lots of heels, black dresses and the best accessories worn out for a night out. I counted two bachelorette or sorority girl birthday parties during our dining experience. The place is OK, probably too big for a quality Asian restaurant. The décor is a bit overdone and phony.  I feel they are trying to do too many things. Good for the area and social scene. Staff is OK, they are busy and overwhelmed. I felt by asking questions I was taking up too much of our waitress's time.  My boyfriend really enjoyed the Crispy Brussels Sprout Salad. He's on a brussels sprout kick. It's a good size portion with shredded sprouts other cabbage. The fried shallots give it a warm feel with a nice crunch.  I ordered simply, the mushroom Miso soup. I wanted to something warm and this did not disappoint. It's hard to do a Miso soup wrong.   Next up we ordered the Black Truffle Tuna Tataki. Both my boyfriend and I are suckers for anything truffle. I was a bit surprise with how the sushi came out. It's under the roles, but it's not really a role. The fish is rolled up set on the chip with the black truffle on top. I loved the truffle and soy infused truffle drizzled on top. I did not like that I had to pick up the chip and eat it all in one bite. I was hoping for more of an authentic sushi role.  We then were going between another role, pad thai or the crab noodles. Wants to be different I went with the Longevity Garlic Crab Noodles.  I was a bit disappointed and probably should have stuck with what I know I like. The dish tasted more like a warm tuna casserole my mom would make or from some Italian restaurant. The crab is shredded very small mixed in with a pile of soft noodles covered in a garlic cream sauce. I will know better for next time.  For a drink we shared the Peared Sake. Not big drinkers, we wanted to try something. Also not too into Sake, this seemed like a fair compromise. It was a light, sweet and refreshing drink. It's sweet but the cinnamon and pear ton it down a bit. I could have had a few of these! The next time round I will order more sushi and want to try more of the unique dishes.

2014-03-25,3.0,"Sunda - 110 W Illinois St. Chicago, IL There tends to be a general disdain towards pan-Asian or Asian fusion restaurants.  It probably has a lot to do with Asian food purists who feel like it's hard to do so much well at the same time, or a lot of them tend to be more low-key carryout-type places - nothing wrong with that, just hard to shine when you're trying to do so much at once.  Sunda busted on the scene a few years ago to much hype - much of that has to do with the chic decor and the celebrity sightings, but I place like that won't last long unless it's got the food and drink to back up that hype.  Five years later, the decor and menu at Sunda remain minimally changed, and the crowds continue to pack the place night after night, so the formula's working.   I'm giving this review 3 stars, as this trip to Sunda was alright, but I've have much better there.  We got the 7-spice fried chicken, kimchi soup, oxtail dumplings, ginger tofu, and the ridiculous.  I passed on a few dishes that have shined before in the past - the Crispy pata, the brussels sprouts salad, and the miso black cod, to name a few.  We also skipped their sushi dishes - which while expensive are fresh and pretty rich in flavor.  For an Asian fusion joint, the peeps at Sunda do a great job and it's worth checking out and great for a big group of people.   Details and pics up on my brog at: eatinginchicago2014.word…",0.99,0.809,0.159,0.032,0.38406862745098036

2014-03-09,4.0,"Three of us were looking to grab a quick bite within walking distance and noticed this Asian Fusion restaurant on the Yelp App. It was already late in the afternoon and we were the only customers at the restaurant. The exterior had the looks of a warehouse and the interior was simply stunning. The venue was huge and lounge-like. There were shades of brown matted and polished across the vertical floor with yellow-colored lighting and large bouquets of flowers to exude a cozy and modern atmosphere.  The chefs were Filipino and the menu had an assortment of Asian dishes of various modernist interpretations. The complimentary Shrimp Chips were fresh, crisp, and quite addictive. We also started the meal with Edamame ($5) that arrived charred in flavor glazed with sesame oil and sesame seeds. It was delicious. We also shared the Kale and Seaweed Salad ($14) that came with Japanese mustard, toasted seaweed, carrot, seaweed, cabbage, pickled cucumber, mint, basil, red onion, pickled beet, radish, and sweet chili lime vinaigrette. It was fresh, crisp, tangy and sweet in every bite. The price was high, but recommended.  Unfortunately, the Oxtail Miso Soup ($8) had an abundance of hand pulled oxtail meat, but the soup was too salty. I had a hard time finishing it. My entrée, the Longevity Garlic Crab Noodles ($15) was tossed with Lump crab, lomein, toasted garlic, and scallions. The noodles had a persistent garlic aroma, and the dish was filled with lots of chunky fresh crab that was pleasing to the eye and taste buds. This was one of the best garlic noodles I've came across. Highly recommended.  Our dessert, the Seven Spice Pumpkin Bread Pudding ($9) was amazing. Every spoon came with the flavors of caramel, liquorish, cinnamon, candied ginger, shaved orange, mint, and whipped cream. The Bread Pudding was soft, and easy to cut into.  Service was highly knowledgeable, very friendly, professional, and prompt. Our water refilled without asking. Extra plates were provided and our table was kept clean as we transitioned from one plate to the next. Normally, I'm not a fan of Asian Fusion cuisine so I don't frequent restaurant of this genre. I must say, I was thoroughly impressed from the beginning to the end. There was a range of moderate to excitable wow factor from the dishes and the exquisite décor that made the entire experience memorable. My friends had their sushi items and bento boxes and kept saying, ""OMG, this is good!"" as we dined and chatted. The Oxtail Miso and the steep prices were reasons that they didn't receive a 5 star rating. One of Chicago's best. I'd love to return to try their Ramen, Oxtail Rice Porridge, and Pancit.",0.9974,0.812,0.169,0.019,0.5643510737628384

I was met by a snarky hostess and informed to wait at the bar for my table for one....at 5:00pm on a Tuesday.... Ok, that's fine, I'l order a drink and peruse the menu. Well that would be fine if the bartenders gave a damn. A drink list was dropped (thrown?) at me when I took a seat at the bar and when I asked about looking at a menu the bartender rolled her eyes. I ordered a glass of wine and then was ignored for about 30 minutes. When I went to check with the hostess about a table, she said that she couldn't find me and there was no seating. Uhhh your entire restaurant is empty - what gives? Having not seen the bartender for the better part of 45 minutes, I threw down a $10 bill and left. I walked across the street to Roka Akor and had an exceptional dinner and great service to boot! Take home message: Don't waste your time at Sunda.

For a premium place i would have expected the fish to be cut on demand... Oh well... I listened to the nice waiter and ordered his recommendations. Crispy rice, yellowtail sashimi and lobster/wagu beef rolls.  First 2 were ok.

2014-02-22,4.0,"This is a review purely based on the desserts. After a night at Ruxbin followed by a drop in at a Tacqueria, my sweet tooth was craving something. My friend raved about the Ridiculous so it was worth dropping by to finish the night.  We ordered the Sunda Sundae and the Ridiculous. The Sunda Sundae was very underwhelming. Out of the three scoops of ice cream, the most memorable one was the corn-flavored scoop. The sundae also had lychee (a bit sour), red beans, aloe vera, on top of this lemon italian ice. I didn't feel like the flavors went well together, and it was definitely overpriced for a dessert that I could have gotten at an Asian mom-and-pop shop.  However, I really liked the Ridiculous. It's a tempura/carrot cake wrap on a mound of creamy vanilla ice cream. On top, there's a bed of caramel sauce, toasted sweet pecans, and bits of ginger. The only thing that would make it better is if they chopped up a few bits of bacon and sprinkled it on top for a salty taste. Maybe that's too much to ask for. I loved the bustling environment on a Friday night! The waiters were very attentive and the decor was awesome. Definitely must try their dinner menu sometime.",0.9786,0.775,0.174,0.051,0.5444444444444444

The valet parking at $14 was a shocker -- I've always felt that if you spend a certain amount this service should just be comped. We spent $175 and had to spend another $14 for parking?

2014-02-21,5.0,"SCENE & BE SEEN This is one of the cool places in Chicago. Reservations are highly recommended unless you want to try your luck & just show up.  When you first walk in you immediately notice the decor and it looks rustic elegant. The hostess station is under this giant circle light which I thought was really unique. As we were taken to our table, we walked by the beautiful sushi bar. The sushi chefs were prepping for a big night & all of the fresh fish looked amazing. The sushi bar looks like it would be a fun place to eat at. I love to be where all the action is in a restaurant, so maybe next time.  Our table was a cute small round table perfect for the day after Valentine's. Our waiter Michael came over & gave us a quick overview about the concept. He mentioned that the dishes were smaller like tapas & meant for sharing. This was great advice & we decided to order with that in mind.  I must take a moment to point out the service. Our waiter Michael was fantastic. He was the highlight of our dinner. His knowledge of every menu item was simply amazing. He not only displays this professionalism with our table but with all of the tables around us. It was fun to listen to his flawless descriptions. Not once did he stutter or stop to think about what to say. They are very lucky to have a dedicated waiter who showcases their dishes extremely well.  I MUST say thank you to Victor who kept our table clean, water glasses full & napkins folded. Victor is a gem. He politely asked if we were finished with our dishes before ever making a move to grab them. He also refolded the cloth napkins if you got up to go to the bathroom. That is so old school. After returning from the bathroom, I looked at my wife and said, ""What happen to my napkin?"" And she informed me how Victor came over to fold it. He mentioned to my wife, ""It just looks better!"" Thanks Victor! It is this type of service you pay for and expect from any fine dinning restaurant. Michael & Victor made our experience amazing here and should be the model for every restaurant to copy.  Prior to coming here I checked out the menu & read other reviews. I also sent out an email asking for advice and the one item that kept coming up was the Rock Shrimp Tempura. I must say it was delicious. There was plenty of shrimp & they were really tasty. It was probably the freshest tasting shrimp I have had in a while. I really loved the creamy honey aioli. It wasn't over powering but just the perfect amount of creamy sweetness. The dish worked on so many levels including the candied walnuts.  Next we wanted to go with some sushi. This was a task because the sushi list is quite extensive & unique. We kept running our choices by Michael. He was completely honest with us, which I love in a waiter.  We finally decided on the ""Spicy""Tail of Two"" Tunas"". The roll has Yellowfin with pickled jalepeno, escolar, fried shallots on top and a spicy mayo. We love stuff extremely spicy so we requested to have extra jalepeno added in. The chef added it but he removed the veins and seeds where all of the heat is located. That was a little of a let down but we will survive. I loved the suggestion from our waiter Michael. He told me about wrapping the sushi in soy paper and not seaweed and I loved it. I'm a huge fan of soy paper now.  I loved the pace of our dinner. We were never rushed to put our order in. We kept one of our menus and kind of decided where to go after eating our prior dish. This made for an enjoyable dinner. I hate when a table gets slammed with a bunch of dishes. It's hard to enjoy and appreciate each dish.  Since we had been doing all surf we decided to hit the turf. Another highly recommend dish was the lemongrass beef lollipops. It is NY strip beef that is wrapped in lemongrass with a ginger citrus sweet glaze. The steak was very tender with a dipping sauce I enjoyed. I must talk about the presentation of the food. Every dish was laid out like a piece of art. I did snap some photos but the lighting wasn't the best. So hopefully you'll have a chance to enjoy them.  At this point we were completely stuffed but highly encouraged to get dessert. We went with the ""Ridiculous"" which is vanilla ice cream wrapped with ginger carrot cake tempura. It's deep fried, then topped with walnuts & carmel sauce. It was the star of the show for us. It was the most delicious amusement park dessert ever and I say that with great respect for the dish. It was everything we anticipated but more. The smell & taste were complete perfection. I would stop in the lounge here just to have this to end my night & I'm not a dessert person. It's the perfect spot for a date night or group dinner. It's a place that's cooler then you & still let's you hang out. It's a place to be seen and Scene!",0.9996,0.774,0.205,0.021,0.6128669410150889

2014-01-23,3.0,"I have been hesitant to try Sunda as sometimes I tend not to like Asian Fusion or places that try to be too trendy.  Last night I had a friend in town who was staying near Sunda and given the weather we decided to stick close.  She was craving Asian so Sunda it was.   We went at 5pm right when they opened and still got a look from the hostess for not having a reservation.  We waited a few minutes for them to come back and seat us.  Our server was very friendly and helpful with the slightly overwhelming menu.  There was a lot to choose from and the cuisine seemed all over the place but all sounded good.   My friend started off with a Tiger beer and I got a nice dry sake.  I was of fan of my sake, but for $12 for a very small glass of it I only had one.  Sake is often overpriced at restaurants and this was no exception.   My friend ordered the shaved brussels sprouts salad and the Lobster Wagyu Roll while I ordered Miso Soup with Mushroom and the Crispy Paata (Pork Shank).   Shaved Brussels Sprouts salad- I tried some of this and this was fantastic.  I would say maybe a tad more dressing than I prefer but I would order this again.  Lobster Wagyu Roll- I did not try this but my friend was very pleased with it and it looked good.  Miso Soup with Mushroom- There was nothing special about it, it was miso soup. Crispy Paata- I was a big fan of this.  I did not use the dipping sauces although they were both good, but the pork shank was cooked to perfection and did not need it.  I also loved all of the flavors of the salad that came with this.   Overall it was a very enjoyable meal.  So why 3 starts instead of 4?  The food was a solid 4 however this place is pricey and can get loud.  Some of the items on their menu seem deserving of the price, some seem overpriced.  Would I go back?  Absolutely, but this will not become a regular hangout of mine.  I do feel that my pork dish was worth the price so that is definitely a dish I would get again.  I cannot imagine how loud this place would be later on a Friday or Saturday evening and I am sure I wont find out.  I would stick to earlier dining times here if you want to converse with your dining partners.",0.9971,0.807,0.173,0.02,0.5051249051249052

I believe this restaurant is best enjoyed with a group of at least 3-4 since it is family style.

Some of the items we had were: Kale and Seaweed Salad Bang Bang Salad Rock Shrimp Tempura Miso Cauliflower Chicken Fish And a few of the specialty sushi rolls (sucks I can't remember) The bartenders also know what they are doing as well. The craft cocktails are awesome and are similarly priced to something you would have at a trendy bar. My friends also mentioned they had a good selection of sake. Now some inconveniences: The restaurant is ""cozy"" .. which means you can be sitting next to another patron or be bumped or squeezed between waiters because they don't have that much space to work with. Also if you have to ""powder your nose"" then don't wait until last minute. It's quite of a walk to get there between squeezing through tables and walking down a couple of flights of stairs.  The food is soo good that it's still a 5-star experience. Now is this a regular eat, maybe not.. unless you go with a group. The price can add up fast.",0.985,0.866,0.134,0.0,0.49271646228167965

The waiter saw how disappointed I was at not seeing some of my lunch/dinner favorites on the menu and made it a point to go the kitchen and ask them to take requests. He then came back and gave me the full dinner menu and said I could order whatever I liked! Talk about service! Started with the tuna and jalapeño on pan fried sushi rice, one of their specials. Needless to say it was fresh and delicious. Then had the lemongrass beef lollipops which were cooked to perfection and had the perfect balance of flavors complimented by a single slice of Thai red chili on each one and a dipping sauce that was just tart and sweet enough to balance the spice. The red dragon sushi roll was next which was fresh and had a great crunch to it due to the sprinkled tempura flakes on top. For dessert we had the tempura French toast with fresh fruits and I am salivating just thinking about this dish.

Once we were seated our waiter immediately came over to take our drink orders even though we were still taking off scarves and coats and settling in. At first he was friendly, but he became forgetful and bothersome by the time we were done. For drinks, my friend had the pear cocktail, it was good. I ordered a Lychee Luxe drop, not my favorite at all. It tasted like shrimp cocktail sauce strangely.  We ordered the Bao's with pork belly, just all right, the sauce they were in masked the flavor of the other components. I also ordered the crab garlic noodles, wayyyyyyyyyy too much garlic, it masked the flavor of that poor delicate crab meat.

To be honest nothing was bad. The sushi however was the weak point. The stuffed avocado was supposed to be spicy and was not at all. The tomato compote just did not work with the rest of the flavors and it could have used some differentiating texture. It was just too mushy. There was some crunch on there but could have used a lot more. The soft shell crab roll wasn't bad but it was underwhelming compared to everything else and can be found in a lot of sushi joints.  I honestly wanted to try about 15 other dishes. I am definitely coming back here the next time I am in Chicago.  Tip: Keep to the fusion dishes  and away from the sushi.

I found this an interesting contrast to the decorations aiming to give the place an Asian zen-like feel.  Service: Fantastic. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating. Food: Okay. We tried the steamed buns, and oddly enough, tasted like steamed buns. They were fine, just nothing out of the ordinary. The short rib meat was tender and had a decent taste, but nothing I haven't had before. The crispy pata was pretty large, but I found it dry, like it had been sitting under a heating lamp for a couple of hours, and it lacked a bit of seasoning (except for salt - it had a bit too much of that). The best part of the meal was a gravy/sauce that came with the pata - I could have had a bowl of that stuff - and the green beans with caramelized walnuts (nomnomnom).  Drinks: *thumbs up* If I'm to go back to Sunda, it will be for the drinks. We tried the  lychee cocktail (with a splash of wasabi) and that went down dangerously easy. The peared sake cocktail smelled ""pretty"", like perfume, and it tasted like it too.... it was decent, but not something I'd have again.  The 110 and walnut rye Manhattan were both fantastic and I'd recommend them if you're into that kind of thing.

It was very quiet and only a few tables were taken but you could still feel comfortable in a way that the place didn't feel deserted.  We had the hardest time deciding on what to get! The menu is absolutely great and offers something for everybody.  We decided on the Wok Fried Shishito Peppers to start us off...and I wasn't able to get them out of my head for the rest of the week! Best snack I ever had! The sauce they marinated in makes you want to eat the whole bowl by yourself! It's a must try. The Bang! Bang! Salad also grabbed our attention so we ordered that and shared as an appetizer. It was delicious! Didn't really understand the presentation of the salad but the taste made me forget all about the oversized lettuce leaves and the hiding green noodles underneath.  For our main meal which at this point we didn't even need because of the taste explosion that was already happening in our mouths, we've had the Garlic Crab Noodles and Bi Bim Bop. We shared both and both were just as good. The crab noodles is definitely something for a carb lover who likes a deep creamy taste, I enjoyed my leftovers with the Shishito peppers that night and the saltiness and freshness of them paired perfectly with the noodles. The Bi Bim Bop which is a bowl of rice with steak and vegetables was another flavor explosion on its own.

2013-09-06,3.0,"My husband ate here in 2011 and had an amazing food experience. We were traveling with our then 14 month old daughter and so made a very early reservation, like 4:30 - 5pm. The host assured us that kids were fine, however when we arrived they were slightly put out that she was with us. They rustled up a high chair and everything after that was great. Our server was accommodating and lovely to our daughter, as was the rest of the wait staff. She was well behaved and enjoyed the food. The food during that trip was so very memorable, we had the steamed pork belly buns, corn fritters, spicy tuna crisp rice, oxtail potstickers, and garlic noodles - all which we talked about for months and remember to this day.  When we returned to Chicago this past may we were determined to return and made a reservation for 8pm, Saturday night, the only one we could get. We were traveling with our 4 month old son, who pretty much just nursed, slept, and looked around at that age, and arrived 19 minutes before our reservation. They did not act irritated that we had a child this time, even though we were there during prime time and both hosts were smily and friendly with our son. That said, we then had to wait fifty minutes to be sat, well past our reservation time. Meanwhile, walk ins were being sat on the patio, and lounge area. When we asked about it they said they had a table for us in the dining room, and it was almost ready - for 20 minutes. They only sat us when we told them we were leaving. And no apologies were offered.  We had held out for the food. The food we had remembered so well. What a disappointment. The food was meh. And I don't say that because we had created crazy high expectations from the last time - the food wasn't seasoned, and some came out cold. They had somehow seemed to squeeze in about ten more tables in the same area as last time, and I was literally bumping elbows with the men at the table behind me. It was packed and people seemed to be having a good time, our server was very friendly, and no one complained about our baby (who slept the whole time).

2013-08-31,4.0,"I've been looking all over Chicago in search of great, authentic Southeast Asian cuisine and am really surprised to have found that in Sunda. I usually try to steer away from Asian fusion or any fusion cuisine in general since I tend to favor the original cuisine better. Sunda really does it right though and I am pleasantly surprised!  The decor is absolutely beautiful. It feels quite lounge-y at times, especially on weekend nights. I love the set up and there's a lot of different table settings you can choose from (community table, sushi bar, regular table,etc). Now on to the food. Here are some of my favorites from Sunda: - Rock shrimp: crispy bite size shrimp smothered in creamy sauce. And although I used the word ""smothered"", the sauce is actually used fairly sparingly so you don't feel like you're just eating globs of cream. - Kobe beef sushi: my favorite! Really succulent Kobe beef on top of pan fried sushi rice. Get this everytime I come here! - Pork belly: very soft, very juicy. Always hits the spot. You can order it either as an appetizer in a bun or as an entree if you're greedy and want it all to yourself (and I don't blame you for being greedy, it is delicious)  - Crispy Brussel sprout salad: done right.

It was a lil strong, but I needed strong - it was gonna be a long night.  My lady had the Peared Sake. Our server assured her that it was only a ""splash"" of sparkling Sake (She wanted no parts of Sake) and that other than that it was standard fare Grey Goose (pear infused), with the Pineapple and such.

Half of my dish was sushi rice (which was tasty but I think it's because I haven't eaten rice in a long time), 6 pieces of fish, 5 cucumber slices and a little serving of lima beans.  This dish was $18.  That is the lunch price.  WTF.

2013-08-21,1.0,"I've been here at least 20 or so times since they've opened and with my past two visits I've been disappointed for one reason or another. Don't get me wrong the food is for the most part consistent and when its comes to Asian-inspired cuisine and sushi it is as expected but the service is severely lacking.  If I am paying River North prices for sushi and Asian cuisine that I can get just about anywhere I expect a little more. So let me roll up 2 underwhelming visits into one review.   Visit #1: So I went to dinner with 3 industry friends last night around 10pm.  Restaurant was about 30-40% full. We walked in and got a table. 1) friend had a 50% off industry card and asked if it applied to the bill or just him. We were told total bill. Ok.   2)I sent both my water glass and soy sauce bowl back because they were dirty. I've never once had to do this.   3)Took about 10 minutes for our waitress to come over and ask about drinks or greet us. A friend ordered hot tea, she came back with box of tea to select, took another 10 minutes after the selection,  we were eating by time she got her tea. 4) our water was not refilled once during our meal and only when server was clearing plates did she ask my friend if she wanted a refill on water. 5) we tipped on the pre-discount amount, as we're supposed to, and one of my friends overheard the server say 'wow they left a big tip' as if she was expected us youngish looking industry folk to stiff her on it. Even if the restaurant was at capacity, I would not have expected any of this but the fact that they were near empty by the time we left just made the experience all the more upsetting. Visit #2: I walk in an average capacity Wednesday night and stand at the host/manager reception area as both a manager and host are looking down at their computers.  I continue to stand, unacknowledged for what to seems too long, and finally another host walking back to reception area says 'sorry for the delay, someone will be with you in a moment.'   I get it, the restaurant is busy, but I'm not invisible and if I am standing less than 24 inches away from you and staring at you like a deer in headlights, waiting to give you my money the least you could say is, 'Sorry for the wait but I will be with you in a minute."" No harm no foul.     In sum, if you want consistent sushi and other Asian-inspired cuisine, Sunda is fine, but if you want respectable service to go along with the prices you are paying in River North go anywhere else.",0.9353,0.845,0.091,0.065,0.4545865633074936

I couldn't taste the alcohol. I could drink these all night! Lychee Luxury Drop- I LOVE lychees so I was a huge fan of this drink. It was strong but delicious and there was a lychee to accompany the cocktail. Hot: Lemongrass Beef Lollipops- these were tender and moist. A little difficult to eat because we did not have knives. The sauce that accompanied the lollipops was fantastic! Roasted Duck hash- this was my boyfriend's favorite dish of the night! The duck was full of flavor and the daikon cakes were amazing! I wanted a bowl full just to myself. ORDER THIS!! Sunda Signature Sushi: Salmon Jicama- this dish is incredibly refreshing. The perfect light palate cleanser of clean flavors after eating two heavier meat dishes. It made a great transition into our lighter seafood dishes for the evening. There were 3 of these and they were like small tacos.  Main Flavors: Malay Style Chilean Seabass- the seabass was light and buttery with an extremely flavorful crust of chiles and spices. The cauliflower puree was full of curry flavor. I would highly recommend this dish! Specialty cut rolls: spicy ""tail of two tunas""- This was a very delicious roll, however I did not find it to be spicy. Some extra jalapeno would have gone a long way.

2013-08-07,4.0,"When I want sushi, I tend to go with the hole-in-the-wall places, as my experience has been that they normally have the best sushi. Being totally opposite of hole-in-the-wall, I was hesitant to try Sunda. But Sunda, you impressed me! A friend and I made reservations kind of late for a Saturday night, so we ended up getting a really early one at 6:30. People starting filtering in a half hour to an hour later. The place itself looks very contemporary, romantic and upscale. I have to admit that I was expecting a more chic crowd--one guy a few tables down was wearing a baseball cap! I thought that was a bit inappropriate for Sunda. We skipped appetizers and dove right into the sushi. We ordered the Spicy Tail of Two Tunas, Red Dragon, Firecracker and Lobster & Wagyu. Let's start with what I do not recommend--the Firecracker. When we ordered it, we did not realize that the entire roll was fried. The description on the menu makes it seem like only the fish inside is fried. Overall, the roll just lacked flavor. I do recommend the other three. The Spicy Tail of Two Tunas was an incredible take on the traditional spicy tuna. How they get that tuna inside to be so creamy is baffling. The Lobster & Wagyu was the most inventive sushi roll I've ever seen and tasted. Lobster, aioli, scallions and jalapenos made up the inside of the roll, and it was phenomenal. I'm pretty sure wagyu is some type of meat (our server called this roll a type of ""surf and turf""). Whatever it is, it was paper thin and covered the top of the roll. It had a nice spice to it, but at the same time, kind of overpowered the lobster. Regardless, a great-tasting roll. And finally--my favorite of the night: Red Dragon. It contains typical sushi ingredients--shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, jalapeno, avocado, etc.--but it was beyond delicious. For dessert, we had the ""Ridiculous,"" which was a large scoop of ice cream coated in a thin layer of ginger carrot cake and drizzled with caramel. Foodgasm. Lastly, the service was good. Our server was very nice and provided great recommendations (Red Dragon and Lobster & Wagyu), but service was a tad slow for a Saturday night.",0.9911,0.871,0.125,0.004,0.5362405106970324

Simple yet tasty, flavors all blend together into me smiling my face off while still trying to chew, and simultaneously trying to stuff another one into my mouth. Couldn't get enough, I almost didn't even offer to share with my dining partner because I wanted it all to myself. Luckily she's gluten free and couldn't eat it anyway. SCORE. Brussell sprouts salad: oh my god. The sauce is amazing, the brussell sprouts themselves are crispy yet soft, the flavor buttery with a little bite of vinegar or something tangy in the sauce. Get this. Great atmosphere, bar area has open seating as can be expected, the blackberry limeade cocktail is delicious, girly and beautiful to look at.  My one confusion is the Rock Shrimp Tempura. To me, it tastes like it came out of a frozen dinner box you can buy from Costco, so I personally don't see what all the fuss is about. Other than that, swanky, pricey, but potentially worth it depending on who you are. Plenty of sushi places in Chicago so I probably won't come back, but I can fully understand why this place has great reviews.",0.9959,0.764,0.225,0.011,0.5474404761904762
2013-07-29,3.0,"The food is very good, unique and reasonably priced.  It is a terrific place for vegetarians.  The drinks are also excellent and match the food nicely.  The wait staff was quite good, the right amount of chatty, informative and educated about their product without crossing the line to over-friendly.  The main room is sleek and very loud (we were sitting at a 6 top and couldn't hear across the table, only the people to either side of us).  My one piece of advice-- DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR.  We were at Sunda this weekend and the door handle (metalwork) sliced my sister's finger open.  By the time we got inside she was gushing blood.  A staff member helped us and had all sorts of things to stop the bleeding, close the wound, etc (as expected of a sushi restaurant).  Fine, no problem.  Accidents happen.  But then we kept hearing of other people who had their fingers cut by the door handle-- 3 staff members and another customer.  Sunda, if you know that there is a problem that is injuring customers and staff members on a regular basis, fix it or get a doorman.  This is unacceptable.  All this said, the firefighters at the station just down the street were great helping my sister evaluate her injury.  Thanks Engine 42!",0.8801,0.796,0.121,0.083,0.6161837897552184

2013-07-28,3.0,"I think 3 stars for this place is just right. I thought it was pretty good, but I don't see the hype that many of you others yelpers give this place. We went early and sat at an actual table. Just so you know there are some long communal dining tables with high bar stools. I felt bad for the people at those tables because the chairs have no backs and no cushions. Oddly enough though, I saw the staff put cushions on the chairs around 7pm so some people got some padding and others who sat there earlier didn't. This makes no sense. Our server did a good job of pacing the dishes. We started with the fried brussel sprouts salad. Maybe I'm just a snob, but I didn't see how this was so unique- I mean it's fried greens- there was some tasty chili sauce and it was good but not amazeballs. We then had the pork belly sticks which were fine. It was what I expected. We then had the rock shrimp tempura- this dish was a little heavy on the walnuts, but it was good. We then had 2 sushi rolls that quite frankly were a bit disappointing. It was sushi as plain as could be.  I guess what is lost on me is that I didn't find it to be as Asian fusion as I expected. In same cases I think the Asian flair was missing altogether. I thought our server was a little overbearing at times trying to get us to order more drinks and dishes. I'm not opposed to eating here again, but I'd rather have someone else pay for it.",-0.9062,0.835,0.061,0.104,0.47110426929392446
2013-07-25,2.0,"So I'm upset with Sudna. I have been here before on two occasion and had a wonderful time. Recently, my BF and I went there for lunch. Not a busy day. We were dressed in casual, but nice clothes. We didn't have a reservation, but it was past one, and the place wasn't that busy. We were asked, as we were being led to the lounge, if the lounge was ok. We said yes mostly because it didn't really seem like we had a choice. Anyway, the ""lounge"" is a long, dark, sparsely decorated area with a few small tables and bar stools. We were seated literally right next to a cash register by a small bar. I always thought this area was a waiting room. The chairs were uncomfortable and there was NO ONE else there. At all. The entire hour we were there, not one other person/couple was seated there or anywhere near us. I felt like a leper. So when I went to wash my hands, I walked through the main, giant, beautiful restaurant. Imagine my surprise when I see there are lots of people here, yet plenty of open seats. And yet, my BF and I were banished to the eternally empty ""lounge."" Now, here's the thing, I was upset. I felt ""not good enough"" and frankly this a is place you go to for the ambiance and beautiful artwork. There is none of that in the lounge. Now, our food was good, although our sushi rolls were falling apart in our bento boxes, and our waitress was lovely. But I was very upset. I wish I would have said something, but I felt weird, like I didn't want to make a scene.  Anyway, I felt compelled to email a nice letter to Sunda from contact info I found on their website. That was over a week ago. They never replied. So, yeah, the food is good, if a bit pricey, but this incident really left a bad taste in my mouth. The fact that they did not email me back is quite rude. I felt they could have easily smoothed this over and retained me as a customer, but they didn't even bother and I won't be going back.",-0.6955,0.748,0.118,0.134,0.526480836236934

2013-07-08,4.0,"Lovely dinner to end a long weekend of eating, drinking, and merrymaking in Chicago with friends. My friends made a reservation (or rather, their concierge did) after hearing plenty of good things about this place. To my (happy) surprise, I discovered that Sunda is a fusion Asian restaurant with a lot of Filipino and Japanese dishes. Which meant I get to fix my Filipino food craving, and my friend gets her sushi. Win-win!  The restaurant is huuuuuuge, and the best way for me to describe the interior is a large, swanky Vegas restaurant that you'll find at the Cosmopolitan hotel or City Center in LV, if that's a useful reference point. The lighting is a beautiful amber, and the decor is a little loud, if only to match the energy of the place. It's refined, sure, but it didn't feel too exclusive; I saw folks in nicer duds, to parties that look like they just came from a day of shopping on Michigan and State. The menu is super fun, and it was really hard for me to pick a dish...so I went with two! First, the pork adobo flake fried rice. It was absolutely fantastic; the pork belly was wonderfully braised and fall apart tender, the rice was a little but not too sticky, and it was all mixed together with just the right amount of soy sauce, garlic, and an egg on top. Phenomenal.  I really should've stopped there, but I just had to see what the heck is up with the Crispy Pata. All I can say is, bring another person, or another stomach. This thing is also huuuuuuge. But, despite its size, every single square inch of that Flintstone-size meat dish was thoroughly tasty and tender. I love the two sauces it comes with, too. Needless to say, I was eating this thing for two days.  I'm excited to read that people have had consistently good visits to Sunda; it's definitely a place I would love to come back to.",0.9971,0.769,0.214,0.017,0.5071979717813052

As we entered, I immediately noticed how dark it was on the inside. I wasn't a huge fan of that, but I suppose it makes things more intimate or romantic. We started with the shitake and edamame dumplings which had a great texture on the inside. I would recommend them. Second, we had the lemongrass beef lollipops, which was also pretty great and for me was the star of the meal. Third, we had the ginger tofu. The first couple tofu blocks was pretty tasty, but I was a little bored of it near the end. PLUS it really could have used more mango on the dish, or bigger strips. The mango was so tiny and it was so dark you didn't even know it was there. Lastly, we had the Pancit Canton. I would call it an elevated Cantonese Chow Mein. The skin of the pork was nice and crispy. I just felt the inside of the pork was a bit too fatty. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and there was plenty of them! Overall it was a good dish for the price, but it wasn't as epic as I was hoping for. Sunda was a good meal, but if you are travelling to Chicago I wouldn't say it's a place you HAVE to go to, but I think you should consider it if you want some lighter asian food to mix things up.

2013-06-30,4.0,"I have to say that the food here was pretty awesome. I was a little put off by the fact that we had to wait an additional half hour after we arrived for our 7:30 reservation. People were getting seated left and right, there was open seating everywhere, and yet we were not getting seated. So although I'm sure there is an order to it, considering we had a reservation, it was frustrating especially since we weren't getting any updates from the hostess. However, once we got in, it was a good experience. The wait is a little on the longer side, so go here for a date or a girl's night out. There were many, many families though and larger groups, so this place really accommodates everyone. The service was friendly, ready to serve.  The prices are a little steep but for a higher-end restaurant in Chicago it was reasonable, especially for the quality. Yes, I wouldn't pay $15 for 5 potstickers, but we did end up ordering the Thai soup (coconut milk, chicken, chilis) that was amazing. It was rich, the ingredients were fresh, the chicken was tender, and with a little lime had just the right amount of acidity and balance. It was enough to serve 2 people with two bowls, or 4 people with smaller servings of 1 bowl each.  We also ordered the crab noodles, which was actually pretty good! It got to be a little much after a while but the flavor was amazing, the lump crab was succulent, and it was the perfect ""blander"" pairing to the adobo pork belly. The pork belly was a bit saltier than I expected but the sweetness offset it. It was very rich so if you get it I would definitely recommend getting something to balance out the richness. If I were staying in Chicago I would definitely come back for the lunch. It seriously sounds awesome, especially since the food we ate tonight was so amazing.  In the end those three dishes came out to be about $70, which is a bit pricier than I would expect, but doable for this quality of food.",0.9978,0.778,0.211,0.01,0.6359700176366843

Plus the ""ridiculous"" dessert (which we shared). All items were excellent as was the service. The reason for not giving the 5th star is the noise level.

I think somebody sprinkled crack on that cuz I almost had a glutinous moment was gonna order some more....actually I did order more of it. Then that was followed by crab puffs that had a claw in it. It was so good that I had to pull the claw out of DH hands cuz he was gonna eat that as well and we don't have the extra money for dental work. I ordered a off the Nigiri Sushi menu the Tomato Salmon and that was so damn flavorful and juicy...and sexy!! I had also a Miso Bronzed Black Cod and the DH had the Short Rib.

2013-06-17,4.0,"Sunda's menu encompasses just about every asian-style cuisine I can think of (maybe not pho?), so I would expect some misses trying to tackle so many dishes. My one-star deduction has nothing to do with the food, but with the semi-slow service and very high prices. The food is great!! If anything, its sushi is its second fiddle to its appetizers and non-sushi shared plates I was with a group of 6 last night with a 50% industry discount. Granted there was not a lot of cost-conscious ordering, but even with no desserts, one drink per person (two of which were non-alcoholic), and a 50% discount the bill was $35 per person. For the full price of $70 per person, I would expect multiple drinks and dessert regardless of its super swank interior and Riv North zip code. But onto the food.... The hits of the night are as follows:  - Oxtail Potsickers are warm little pockets of savoriness. - Pork Sunda Steamed buns are a fantistic mix of doughy bun with dry by flavorful pork and asian slaw served in slider form. yummmm. - Crispy Brussels Sprouts salad was a good portion with lots of charred flavor and not too much sauce. - Crispy Rice with Wagyu Tartare is pricey for the little rice and beef rectangles, but totally worth it. You can really taste the quality beef.  Honorable mentions: - Rock Shrimp Tempura was a crowd favorite, but I prefer larger shrimp and seafood that is not fried. It really more of a gussied up popcorn shrimp, but it sounds fancy.  - Pad Thai is pretty standard, but at the better end of the spectrum. Its not greasy and only $12.  Sushi: We tried a few rolls that all really tasted the same. Good, but similar. The Sweet Potato caterpillar was rather forgettable, but had a nice presentation. The Scorpion and Rainbow were both fresh, but a little on the small side for those prices. Perhaps I was dazzled by the earlier orders of Steamed buns and kobe beef, but the sushi just wasn't very memorable for me.  The service seemed just a tad on the slow side. I also would have appreciated a little more thought given to when to bring our dishes out from the kitchen. The dishes came as ready with no real though to when we would want the dish in the meal.

I was not sure i would enjoy because i usually stray from the pretentious moniker, or any place that may be trendy to the point of being mistaken for a dance club. So i went early. 6pm. Seriously. Service: All were friendly, our server was attentive and knowledgable and made great recommendations. Food:  Insanely fabulous. Braised spare ribs, seared crab crusted ahi tuna and rock shrimp everyone talks about. So good. The rock shrimp tempura was great, spicy and hit with some candied walnuts. The tuna was amazing. It was a fusion on sushi, and was completely solid. I'm not sure what i can say about the spare ribs. I would order it as my last meal on earth. So tender, great flavors. Drinks: Tried a few specialty cocktails and did not disappoint. Very innovative and refreshing. Atmosphere: Asian Fusion, tasteful, sparse. I have a feeling i was happy i got there early, as I bet this place  would be hard to have a conversation in around 9pm.

I'm not sure why the servers who manage this area get so worked up about tables being reserved yet they don't put a reserved sign and even better - there's no one to fill them during the duration of your stay! Why would you move two people in an empty area from a small patio table of 4 to an even squishier table of 2. I'm petite so I cannot image how the average American would feel. It's not the first time, which has led me to this review. The server was also the epitome of diligence. She came over every other minute as we perused the menu. Would've probably killed her to smile too. There are a lot of fantastic bars and restaurants in the area. This is no longer one of them.",-0.8704,0.837,0.051,0.112,0.45314814814814824
2013-06-06,5.0,"Loved the food and the ambiance at Sunda. Like many restaurants in the neighborhood, Sunda is always bustling and crowded. Even on a week night, at 9:00pm the restaurant was quite full. The ambiance is sexy and so is the food. We ordered the ginger tofu, roasted cauliflower, veggie dumplings to  share. All the dishes were fantastic. Great flavor profiles and absolutely delicious food. We also ordered one of their signature veggie rolls, which was quite delicious too. Do not, I repeat, Do not leave this place without tasting their ""ridiculous"" dessert. Like the name suggests, it is quite ridiculous. Just forget the calorie count and indulge in this sugar-coma inducing dessert.  The only thing that they can improve on is service. While it was friendly, it was very slow. We were a group of 3 and our dinner ran over 2 hours... which is quite unusual for food like this.",0.9869,0.738,0.227,0.036,0.8228571428571428
2013-06-06,5.0,"5 stars for the food but they have to learn to cope with the restaurant crowd a lil' better Typical of many of the restaurants in the Near North side, Sunda boasts a nice ambiance, lively atmosphere, local celebrity sightings and 20-something PYTs, but for me the highlight was the vast menu featuring truly delicious food. I was a tad surprised to find so many vegetarian options. We were able to get reservations only at 9pm on a Wednesday when the weather wasn't so good. So I recommend planning ahead and making reservations earlier.  Since there are so many small plates featured in the menu, I recommend sharing (if you're a small group) as they are not stingy with the portion sizes. Pretty much everything we ate tasted fabulous and these were the highlights- 1. Amuse bouche - sticky bun with truffle 2. Mushroom n edamame dumplings 3. Ginger tofu 4. Roasted cauliflower 5. Sweet potato rolls   For the dessert, we got the 'Ridiculous' named aptly considering its size, the sugar overload and decadence and I was about to scream out with 'joy' as I tasted it... just like in When Harry met Sally. We also got the bread pudding which was warm and delicious. Cannot think of a better way to celebrate my birthday than basking in a glorious food coma...

I'm glad i came for brunch - it could not have been better. We started off with the mimosa and bloody mary bars. The mimosa bar is standard - OJ with different kinds of fruit juices and some fruit to top it off. The bloody mary bar is in its own class. There was everything from hard salami to mango slices to water chestnuts, asparagus, green beans, and jalapenos. The bloody mary drink itself is made with either absolut pepper or effen cucumber. I highly recommend the cucumber. To get our hunger pains in check, we were brought 4 small slices of some sort of bread with a delicious sauce on it. Warm and delicious. For the main meal, my husband ordered the dusk hash and I had the smoked salmon skillet. The hash had so much duck meat in it. The skillet was beyond filling - the fish smoked perfectly and the potatoes/tomatoes roasted to perfection. The absolute best food eaten were the potatoes that came with the hash. They were super light, fried, and quite possibly was the best thing I've ever tasted. I can't wait to head back for their sushi and dim sum.",0.9895,0.716,0.203,0.081,0.6189880952380953

I don't mind paying a lot of money for food if I think it's particularly special or innovative, but here, I feel like I'm just paying for a trendy venue than the food itself.  I came on a Saturday afternoon with a friend, and we ordered 3 dishes: Crispy Brussel Sprouts Salad - $15 ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sund… ) - this was the only dish that I REALLY loved, especially the shrimp dipping sauce - i'm just not sure if this appetizer was worth 15 bucks. Spicy Tuna with Crispy Rice - $14 ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sund… ) - pretty good.. it was basically 4 small pieces of a spicy tuna roll with slightly baked rice.  Rock Shrimp Tempura - $16 ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sund… ) - this is basically walnut shrimp that tastes exactly the same at an authentic chinese restaurant, except here it's half the portion and double the price. it's fine if you serve it as an asian fusion dish, but at least try to do something more interesting with it...? then i'll feel like it's worth it. OVERALL: I guess it's a good date spot if you're willing to splurge... Just know that you're pretty much paying for the trendy environment, not the true quality/value of the food.

So, now we had two gift cards and we needed to use them.  I sent a tweet to Billy Dec and asked if he had any recommendations.  He responded and said to ask for Chef Jess when we arrived.  So, that's exactly what I did. Although my server kind of looked at me like I was being ridiculous, Chef Jess made his way out of the kitchen to greet us.  He didn't stop there.  He placed the entire dinner order for us (Chef's choice).  He explained the dishes, coursed them out perfectly and basically served us the entire night.  It was the best restaurant experience I have ever had.   The food was dynamite.  The Brussels sprout salad is obnoxiously delicious.  The sushi and sashimi are so fresh.  The duck breast was cooked perfectly.  You really can't go wrong here.   Btw, the cocktails are the best way to go.  Be adventurous.   Oh yah, our gift cards had expired, but we didn't know.  That wasn't a problem either.  The manager said it wasn't a problem.

We tried the strawberry fields and blackberry limeade. Both were made with fresh fruit. The only issue was the fruit pieces kept clogging the straw so it was difficult to drink. Also, the fruit and ice made up more than half of the glass. I'm a lightweight and I didn't taste or feel the alcohol at all. For $15, I should at least get a buzz.  Food wise, we had the oxtail potstickers to start. They arrived hot but the bottom wasn't crispy. I'm glad we got the wasabi cream on the side. We tried it and didn't care for it at all.  Adobo braised pork belly: two huge slabs of pork belly. Says it comes with mustard greens which is a joke since it came with literally three pieces of sautéed mustard greens. They should take that out of the menu description if they're going to be that stingy with it. They were more generous with the cilantro garnish. The pork belly was tender and well seasoned. My husband thought it was too salty. I thought it was fine so it was probably too salty.  Lump crab noodles: pretty good. Well seasoned. Pretty generous amount of crab. My only complaint is the noodles were slightly overcooked. Would've been better if they were chewier, not mushy.  I really wanted to try the fried ice cream dessert, but we were too full. Next time.

One of the best pork belly dishes I have had (compared to Michelin/ non-Michelin restaurants in Hong Kong and NYC). Meat was tender and the skin was a little crispy.

The other is in the specialty Sushi, the Escarole. It comes with a piece of potato chip and a sliver of truffle.

Another winner.  At this point, we are very full as the portions were much larger than expected.  For the main course, we had the adobo braised pork belly and the pad thai.  The pork belly was very tender and had excellent flavors.  The pad thai wasn't great.  I wouldn't have chosen the pad thai, but my daughter wanted ""noodles"".  To top it all off, we had the molten chocolate cake.  Yum!!!  I love restaurants with attentive service and Sunda did not disappoint.  Our server was kind and check-in with us often.  To boot, our water glasses were never empty.  I would definitely go back again!  My daughter says, ""ditto!""",0.9885,0.783,0.177,0.041,0.5499206349206349

2013-03-18,3.0,"Let me start this review by saying I don't like restaurants at River North (except very few places that actually have good food). Last time we came to Sunda was probably 4 years ago on a Thursday night after work, and I thought I was at a night club. On top of that, I only liked the appetizers, and wasn't a big fan of entrées here.  I told myself I would never come back here again, so when I saw the Gilt City coupon, I dismissed it quickly. However, my husband said we should give it a second chance, stating ""maybe it has changed?"" I highly doubted that, but decided if we would go back, with a Gilt city coupon is probably better than without one. As a result, last Sunday, we came here at 5:30pm--yes, I intentionally booked an earlier reservation to minimize the possibility of another night clubby-ish dinner.  The hostess first wanted to seat us right next to the bar, after I asked (nicely) if there's a table further away from the bar, we were lead to the back of the dining room. Most people might not like that table, but I was very happy. Our waiter, wearing a St. Patty's day necklace, came promptly and asked about drinks and gave us the Gilt City menu after I mentioned we had a Gilt City coupon.  We got to choose one salad, one sushi, and one hot appetizer to share, and then one entrée each. We got the mushroom and asparagus salad, spicy tale of two tunas, rock shrimp tempura to share; I ordered the cod and my husband got the pork belly.  - The mushroom and asparagus salad had all the ingredients I like, perfectly seasoned and very yummy - Spicy tuna rolls were fresh, a little bit spicy but not too overwhelming. My favorite dish of the night - Rock shrimp tempura were good, but it was very rich and heavy. After two shrimps, I felt like I was eating mayo drenched fried shrimp...and I think this is where everything started to go downhill.  - Cod and pork belly were both yummy at first,  then after two bites, the flavor became very one note--cod was too sweet and pork belly was too salty. Neither of us could finish half of the dish, and we started chugging water like crazy.  - The chef's choice dessert was a selection of five different mochi ice cream. I love mochi, no complaints at all!    This was exactly how I felt last time--yummy appetizers, but very average entrées. Would I be back again?

Although I asked the waitress for a sparkling water and saw her give the order to the bar tender, my water just sat on the bar across the room until I noticed it sitting there and I got it myself. Once we sat down for dinner there was at least a 30-minute gap between when we finished our appetizer course and when we received the entrees. This seemed like an insane wait, especially for food that was pre-ordered in advance!  As for the food itself - every bite of sushi was creative and outstanding. The steamed bao buns were delightfully delish. The Bang! Bang! salad with raw ribbons of shaved green papaya, carrots, zucchini, jicama and citrus chili dressing was totally bangin. For entrees, I was only able to snag a taste of the lo mein (we also ordered fish and some meat dishes), but since the food took so long I couldn't stay to enjoy it otherwise I'd miss my train home.

2013-02-12,4.0,"There are two reasons to try out Restaurant Week spots... a) you want to try it and haven't yet, duh and b) to get a great deal on usually pricey meals.  This was definitely in the A category and probably lost a couple points in the B category.  I'm not saying everything wasn't absolutely delicious but for the size of the RW portions, I don't know that the $44 price tag was worth it.  Both husband and I agreed and we really have no problem shelling out for good food and it was good but I just wanted more of it.  I may also have a portion control problem.  Damn you, Chicago and your big plates. Our server started out awesomely, he did a great job of explaining the very large menu and pointing out his favorites and some seriously creative dishes which had us questioning our RW menu choice.  After some hemming and hawing we stuck with the RW menu but now I want to go back to try some of the others.  And also to see how big portion sizes are because he mentioned most of their menu is meant to share but RW dishes were tasting sized.  Anyways, I'll get past the portions, I promise... Started out with miso soup, pretty standard miso with big chunks of tofu, yum.  Up next was the sushi course, I got the ebi salad with mango and avocado, one shrimp over rice.  Delish.  Third course we both got the kale and seaweed salad.  The greens were fried and super crispy and delicious.  Apparently there was supposed to be a whole host of other stuff on the plate but mine just had greens.  Husband had the rest... carrot, cucumber, mint, basil, beet, radish, etc.  Looked good, he did not share, so I can't say for sure. Next up was a hot course and a main course.  I got the pig stick, a small piece of soy braised pork belly with some pickled slaw.  Husband got the crab puff which he said was awesome, once he figured out how to eat it.  I got the miso glazed black cod and husband got the pork belly.  My fish was cooked perfectly and the glaze made it absolutely so buttery and delicious, I just wish there was more of it.  There I go, back to portions.  Husband actually had a good sized piece of pork braised with adobo and I had a tiny piece and it was delicious. Last was dessert, the berry cobbler came in a small sake looking glass, about two bites... the chocolate cake was not so much cake as the mousse in two small chocolate cups with berries.  Again, fantastic and probably all I should have as far as dessert goes but I wanted more, dammit. I also got the mango soda, it comes as a small glass of syrup and a carafe of soda water so you can mix your own.  I dug the presentation and it was super refreshing. Overall, I want to come back and have a legit meal here because I think the RW was a tease.  Which I guess is the purpose right?  Hook you with a good deal and make you come back and spend boats of money?",0.9946,0.777,0.152,0.072,0.5003776241679466

2013-02-12,3.0,"Sunda does not kid around for restaurant week! Even lunch was a nice selection of dishes for a good deal.  I think I'm extra picky about Asian fusion because I'm so torn on whether I like it or not. I love good authentic Asian food and comforting Asian-American stereotypical foods, but something modern and very American just reminiscent of authentic Asian flavors is something I'm having trouble adjusting to. The Asian flavors have to live up to my mom's cooking, and that's a pretty tall order even for authentic restaurants. So to me, it really has to be creative for it to be worth the ""fusion."" We tried the pork belly on a crispy rice cake off the Saturday brunch menu, and it was an example of a creative, well done fusion dish, though the meat was just not quite there in terms of being... something more? We tried their wonton soup, which had crispy duck skin and foie gras wontons - SO flavorful, but I think I would've enjoyed it a lot more if it weren't so extra salty like the broth sat and reduced too much or something.  The restaurant week lunch boxes were only okay, not as good compared to the two dishes off the menu. My char siu bbq pork was way too sweet and the whole thing was very dry. The tonkatsu curry was bland and had no curry flavor. But the spicy tuna roll was nice, as was the little salad. The mini-desserts were really good - very light and refreshing surprisingly. I couldn't finish my entree but loved the dessert.  I remember thinking everything was really good while eating, but an hour after the meal nothing stood out at all. I'd love to give it another try for brunch, but since it's not easy to eat my way around Chicago, this didn't make my return-soon list as I had hoped.  3.5 stars - would have rounded to 4 if the meal were more memorable...",0.9934,0.772,0.18,0.049,0.5650354609929078

2013-02-11,4.0,"I visited Sunda for Restaurant Week 2013 (RW'13).  It has been on my list for some time now (according to my Yelp bookmarks since March 18, 2010).  I finally made it an afternoon date thanks to an easily made reservation via  opentable.com .  The decor is fantaaastic (as most Chicagoans would pronounce the word) with a clash between modern American and rustic Asian.  I was particularly drawn-in to the light and airy straw dangling in an ominous pattern above the sushi bar.  Just as their slogan claims: East [does] meet West.  Some great design choices were made to have various waiter stands throughout the restaurant which had their own beer taps, and tables with a built-in wine/champagne bottle chiller.  Being that it was Saturday afternoon, there was an Asian-inspired Bloody Mary Bar (i.e. Siracha, Kim Chi, bamboo sticks, ginger) and a Hot Tea Sampling Bar for brunch.  Of course, being the tea lover that I am, I tasted each one and read their descriptions.  Unfortunately, the teas had been steeping wayyy too long and were quite bitter. We started our meal out with drinks.  My partner and I each had a glass of sparkling.  I tried their Moët Ice Imperial Champagne which was served over ice with blackberries and mint.  Think a slightly sweet blackberry mojito.  Sunda's RW'13 menu was a Bento Box with your choice of meat (Seafood Curry, Grilled Spare Ribs, Grilled Salmon Filet, Crusted Pork Loin, Grilled Chicken Breast, Char Siu BBQ Pork, Grilled Petite NY Steak, and Chicken/Pork Adobo).  Each Bento Box came with a deliciously healthy seaweed salad, bland miso soup, an oversized pile of white rice and your choice of four rolls of spicy tuna, avocado & cucumber, or California roll.  The waiter warned us claiming that other patrons complained of the small sizes, but it was more than enough food.  My two-cents is that us Americans have over-sized portions and our stomachs are accustomed to being overfed.  Maybe they just gave everyone more white rice to balance it out.  Who knows?  Back to the meats, both were quite tasty.  My steak was cooked perfectly and charred with a semi-sweet glaze.  The adobo pork was very lean and flavorful due to the vegetables that accompanied it. Our Bento Boxes were then followed by dessert.  Yes, I would agree that the desserts were small in size but gave us a good idea of what the restaurant had to offer (Isn't that what Restaurant Week is all about??).  We did one of each option: Berry Cobbler (Warm seasonal berry cobbler with berry-hibiscus purée and vanilla bean ice cream) and Chocolate Mousse Cake (Chocolate mousse fudge cake with yuzu pineapple and  blackberry purée with grilled pineapple, crispy feuilletines, and fresh blackberries).  The Mousse Cake won the price with the dark chocolate flavor and texture, although I wasn't a fan of the hint of pineapple.  The Berry Cobbler was mediocre with the cobbler having little to no flavor at all (the crust and cobbler are usually my favorite part). All in all, I would most likely come back to Sunda, where East-Meets-West",0.9861,0.881,0.09,0.029,0.5211111111111111

Unfortunately, the service here was awful.  First, we had to ask our server for the restaurant week menu, instead of being offered the menu right away like every other restaurant I have ever been to during restaurant week.  The server ""strongly recommended"" that we supplement from the menu because ""the portions were small"" (they really weren't...not for a 6 course meal).  Then, our first 3 courses were brought out all at once, and no one bussed our dishes...and our waiter seemed to have disappeared.  When we finally found our waiter again and explained what was wrong, he was very apologetic, but it couldn't change the bad impression we got of the place. The food, on the other hand, was very good.  I don't know that it was worth the prices on the full menu- you can find similar Asian ""fusion"" food in the city for much less.  But, 4 stars for the food!

2013-02-07,3.0,"Twas a pretty penny Sunda was. Not sure it if it's all its cracked up to be.   It was a GNO: Girls Night Out and SUNDA was our first stop. Our waitress was super helpful in picking out our cocktails. Anything with LYCHEE and my second love, ST. GERMAINE liqueur I knew the Lychee Luxury Drop was going to be my choice of cocktail for the evening. Our waitress recommended the Pear Sake. MMM was that  great. Both drinks weren't too sweet or too strong. Presentation for both made it even more appealing.  My girl and I were debating whether to take advantage of Restaurant Week and their Prix Fixe menu or their house menu. We were given Miso Soup already because the waitress had thought we were going to go with that menu. When we told her we would go with the house menu she said sorry and said the soup was on her. That was incredibly nice of her. The sushi/nigiri menu was so tempting we had to order one of each. Of course we ordered the No You Didn't... The Ultimate Handroll. And yes, we surrre didddd and it was sooo fiiiiiinnne! I wish the nigiri came with more than 2 pieces because the Escolar was so fresh. The flavor was in the truffled shavings and the potato chip as well.  Being Filipino I couldn't pass up Loompya. Their version was a high class egg roll. It ain't what my mama makes.  What was incredibly disappointing was their Pad Thai. I don't recommend it. I wasn't anything special. We had to send it back because the noodles were undercooked. The second batch was a bit better but we were full by then and not in the mood for it. I was curious on how their Adobo tasted so I had to get it. My friend isn't a fan of pork so it was too much big for her. It also was her first time trying Adobo. I guess the texture and flavor isn't for everyone. I have to say I was quite pleased. The pork belly was so tender, you didn't need a knife. It wasn't too sweet, saucy, or how some make it too sour.  I needed white rice with all this meat of course. It sucks it didn't come with the dish so we had to order it.  I rate it a 3 star kinda place only because we were treated so well from the moment we walked in. Service here was top notch! If I were to go back I would definitely drink more cocktails and maybe stick to starters and  the Japanese menu.",0.975,0.844,0.108,0.048,0.5261347061347063
2013-02-05,3.0,"Many of the food items here and several of the drinks were fantastic for our group of 8. However, numerous service errors and possible food-borne illness marred our experience here. We came for a friend's birthday party. He unfortunately got sick a few hours after the meal. Because it was restaurant week and we had significant overlap in what we ate and drank, we've been able to trace it back to the Miso Bronzed Black Cod or a dirty nigiri plate.  First, the bar. When we came in, we decided to order a cocktail while we waited for the rest of the group. Each of 3 of us ordered a drink and then wanted to close out our tabs. The bartender assumed (incorrectly) that we all wanted to be on the same tab, running the whole amount on the first guy's card. My 110 was ok but too bitter.  The bar is not designed well for the traffic flow. I got knocked into at least 3 times by ladies carrying shopping bags in. What part of the universe are we in where none of them would say excuse me when they hit me with their bag? Then we sat down to a table. One side had a bench and the other side had 4 chairs. We were asked if we wanted to check our coats. Again, instead of giving each of us our coat check, they were all given to one person at our table. I didn't even know they had done this until the end of the meal when we had a round-robin to get our coats. This is highly insecure since some people check bags there. The bench at the table made it extremely awkward for those on that side of the table to get in and out to go to the washroom, which is incidentally, a million miles away from the front of the restaurant and down many stairs, and down another hallway. Next, we had 7 people who wanted restaurant week and one who wanted to order a specific entree. They gave us a lot of grief about this, claiming ordering restaurant week was all or nothing for a table. They had to get a manager involved, who made an exception but not until after asking a lot of questions about what the 8th planned to order. Seriously, we're about to drop $700 at this table for our meal and Sunda is fussing about one person who wants to order something different? Incredible. Then the waitress asked whose birthday it was and we pointed to our friend. We thought that meant she was going to do something special. But no - the only indication of birthday for him was a HBD! on the back of the bill. They brought us a complimentary corn succotash with some spice to it, but took it away from us before it was finished and without asking anyone. They were totally overwhelmed and understaffed on the floor, but yet there were 3-4 people behind the empty bar at any given time, including the manager who stood chit-chatting with them in plain sight of us. I waited 15 minutes to order a drink at one point while staying attentive for a bus boy or waitress. I have to say, it was fantastic. The peared sake. It comes with cinnamon on the rim and a piece of pear and is delicious and strong. They brought our miso before taking the rest of our restaurant menu order. I have to hand it to them, at least they gave us selection and decent portions for the tasting menu. I had the Tomato Salmon Nigiri, which was big enough for 2 bites - and this would have been perfect if the waitress didn't keep spilling soy sauce on our table from an errant bottle. I physically moved to the left when she poured mine for fear it would drip on my clothes. She made no attempt to wipe it clean for any of us - and only noticed the problem on the 7th soy sauce pour. My friend, who was later sick, got the salmon nigiri on a dirty plate.  Next came the salad. I had a mushroom and asparagus salad, and the highlight of it was the crispy enoki. It had a nice ginger vinaigrette.  The highlight of my meal were the next two tastes. First a wagyu beef roti prata and an adobo braised pork belly. Both were good sized portions and quality cuts, expertly marinated. The wagyu in particular was bao taco style - and the bun was perfect. The only issue here is that each of our previous courses took 15-20 minutes to come out, and the wagyu beef came precisely 4 minutes before the adobo. My birthday friend literally had to stop the servers from taking it away from him before his next course was served. Pacing and extreme noise is a problem at this place. The chocolate mousse cake was more of a chocolate mousse tart - it came in a neat dark chocolate shell that was edible. It was quite good, with blackberry and pineapple accent puree to add flavor.  At the end of the meal, after taking the cash away, they did not return the main receipt. This is a huge annoyance for the small-business man in me. The coconut candy on the way out is good, but two of my friends didn't like it.  In all, I'd come here for the food, but they have major service issues. At this price point, they should get this correct. And the possible food-poisoning of my friend concerns me - they have an awful lot of fish out at the sushi bar.",0.9887,0.829,0.1,0.071,0.5323214285714286

It's literally places like these that make me want to LIVE in chicago.  The complimentary banana bread is on point! so good, but not too sweet. LOVED IT.  We asked the server for a recommendation, and we ended up ordering the tempura french toast and crispy pork on rice patties. The crispy pork on rice patties was kind of like an asian fusion take on eggs benedict, but it literally was simply AMAZING. NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE IT. To be quite honest, I still dream about it. IT WAS THAT GOOD. perfectly savory, but not salty at all. I could literally eat it all day every day. The tempura french toast was also DIVINE. It was perfectly crispy, but not greasy and tasted so light and fluffy that I literally thought I was in heaven. The syrup was also a perfect consistency (because I ate really sticky syrup) but for something that is sweet, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, which i LOVE.  Ugh, whoever came up with those two dishes is literally a God that I can worship because that chef in the kitchen is literally a purely brilliant genius.  I also ordered the lychee mimosa which was perfect- not too sweet, but not too strong, and lightly bubbly.

2013-01-25,4.0,"This is a place I've been meaning to go for a while, and I certainly wasn't disappointed when I went for the ""Sunda Social"" on Thursday night.   Here's a breakdown on food: Edamame - delicious and well done, and they give you a ton, we couldn't really finish between the two of us and we were snacking on it between having entrees brought out.   Kale and Seaweed Salad - the kale was good, and the toasted seaweed was delicious, the crispy chewy combination was surprisingly tasty.  The dressing and additional vegetables made this salad delicious, perfect size to share between two! Red Dragon - This roll was as good as the reviews have been making it out to be.  Eat it quickly though it gets cold fast!  Firecracker - Definitely the highlight of the evening.  It is definitely spicy, and I'm someone who eats spicy food and doesn't even realize they're spicy until someone mentions it.  They sliced the roll and put it around this guacamole mix that we didn't even notice until we realized what we just tried to pick up was not crispy like the roll but rather gooey in texture.  (In our defense it's pretty dark in the restaraunt!) Spicy ""Tail of Two Tunas"" - This was a very simple roll and a great way to end our evening.  It was the perfect temperature and texture and I love how this place doesn't oversauce their rolls.  Most places put so much sauce all over the plate and rolls that it really detracts from the real taste of the fish.   Moving on to ambience and service: Ambience - the mood for Sunda Social is that fun happy atmosphere most people look for after a long day at work.  They give you three options for seating - communal tables, bar, or sushi bar.  No matter where you choose to sit it gets pretty loud in there. The lights are dim, the sushi bar is bright, and the music is nonexistent? I'm sure there was music playing but I couldn't hear it over conversation and the all around buzz. Service - our server was Jay, she was very nice and did a great job recommending items.  The staff is very attentive when it comes to refilling water and drinks.  The service is a bit slow but they are crazy busy so I can understand that.  Though -- I really like to be able to control my own soy sauce, so having a staff member come by to pour more was kind of annoying.   All in all a great experience.  The bathrooms are super clean and nice as well, they're on the lower level.  However I don't know if I can vouch for the patrons at this establishment, I accidentally left a ring in the restroom after washing my hands and 15 minutes later it was gone and no one turned it in.  Jay was nice enough to check with the host desk for me, so that's a definite plus point for service and her tip! Oh they have a coat check, which is always nice in Chicago!",0.9983,0.76,0.201,0.039,0.6194847995695453

This place was really busy for a wednesday night and I can see why, it's SO good!! iIt's a great place for a date and because it's mostly small plates and sushi, it's great to share. Here's what we had to eat... Oxtail pot stickers....MUST GET! This was the first bite of food we had here and I couldn't wait to try what was next after these! sooooo good!! Escolar....HAVE to get. I don't know what they put on this  sushi to make it so good but we ended up ordering more of it because it was so delicious. We made sure to have this as our last bite of the night. I'm not a big raw tuna sushi fan and I can't recommend this enough Unagi/Fgie...this is definitely a double bite suhsi but again, delicious. The foie gras on top was just the perfect touch! Lemongrass beef lollipops.....these were good. very lemony tasting because they cook the beef on the lemongrass. But once you dip it in the chili sauce, it's much better. Crazy how the chili sauce can take away some of that lemon taste. The Number 10...we got this roll because it came highly recommended to us. But it was our least favorite thing on the menu. The waiter was correct when he told us it was a heavy roll. There was so much cream cheese in there that you couldn't even taste the fish. It was a typical roll to me. Something that I could get at any sushi place. With all the other delicious items on the menu, i do NOT recommend getting this.

I've only tried the sushi here, not appetizers/entrees, though those are on my to-do list.  The rolls are pretty tasty, though most of them seem to lean pretty heavily towards ""fusion""--lots of jalapenos, cream cheese, etc. I tend to be more of a sashimi and nigiri kind of gal, but my boyfriend, a (still) budding sushi convert, loves the fusion-y rolls and is still somewhat wary of mounds of raw fish, so we stick to the rolls and I can't complain. I wasn't super impressed with the uni nigiri I tried last time, which seemed a little on, for lack of a better word, the tougher side. I don't know how sea urchin can actually be ""tough,"" but the consistency was a little off. The taste was decent though, and I don't think it was an issue of freshness, so maybe that was a fluke.

I'm not sure if it was from the surrounding table or the music, but the noise level was on par with a night club. I notice the building design wasn't really optimized for sound absorption, so maybe thats why the noise level gets amplified. Anyways, I digress... Adobe clams: Too salty, had to send it back and waiter was nice enough to oblige. It came back less salty, but the dish itself still isn't that flavorful.  Rock shrimp: Absolutely perfect! I love it. Shrimp dipped in tempera batter, covered with a sweet creamy aioli syrup that is explodes with flavor. nuff said Sushi Firecracker: Pretty good. sushi roll had all these awesome ingredients in there like cream cheese, unagi, jalapenos, tempura, tuna, spicy mayo...but I'm not sure if all of it shined through in every bite. My taste bud got confused and it tasted like I was eating a cooked tuna roll with guacamole and tempura. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not amazing and nothing notable compared to other sushi rolls.   Garlic crab noodle: Tastes like ramen noodle. Not really flavorful and the crab was sparse and underwhelming. Pass. Duck Hash: Aaaaa-Mazing! Perfect blend of ingredients...when it isn't too salty. First time I had it a few years back, it was too salty, then the 2nd time, it was perfect.  Overall, the experience at Sunda is A-OK. They are often inconsistent with their salty levels.

The only dish I was impressed with was the soup for its complex layers of chili and coconut milk.  The menu itself was just all over the place; it was more a hodgepodge    rather than fusion- it lacked cohesiveness and focus.   Is the place trendy- yes; but that in itself is not worth paying $20 for an oily noodle dish.  Sorry Sunda, this Filipina just wasn't impressed...",0.5919,0.89,0.065,0.046,0.5725

Being a foodie, and one who has eaten most states and many countries, I must say, without reservation that Sunda is consistently the best I have run across.   I have made a habit of simply allowing my server extraordinaire (Ben) to bring what he chooses.  One fine dish after another appears at our table, with detailed explanation of what it is.  The Executive Chef and Owner (Scott) stop by most times to say hello and to make sure the experience is Perfect.  And it is. Rather than go on and on about a certain dish, I invite readers to simply surrender to Ben, or to whomever is your waiter/waitress and have them surprise you with their selections.  It's all amazing, with one dish being even more amazing that what preceded it.  Can't wait to go back!",0.9846,0.774,0.212,0.014,0.5430335097001763
2012-12-10,5.0,"Ate here on a recent Friday night and was more than pleasantly surprised at the experience.  Usually, I've found that these trendy ""celeb hot spots"" are more often style than substance, but the food was the best part about the place. Sampled a few different things as the menu is large and varied.  Began with the tuna tartare on crispy rice.  Best thing of the night.  Could have just ate this and came away happy.  Followed up with a bite of the ""salmon tomato"" sushi.  Good, not great, although I prefer tuna over salmon when it comes to raw fish. Next came the oxtail potstickers, very good.  Followed that  with the bbq duck buns.  These were awesome and a steal at 14 dollars.  On a side not, they pour a side dish of a soy sauce type dipping mixture for your meal which is incredibly good.  The steamed buns dipped into that were fantastic. For an entree had the crisy pata.  Basically a deep fried pork shank towering above a bed of mustard greens.  Came with a foie gras gravy which had great taste but a somehwat grainy texture......probably from the liver.  Great pork dish. Desserts were good but paled in comparsion to the other offerings. Cocktails were weak and poorly flavored for a place with a ""nightclub"" type atmosphere with a noise level that would give a senior citizen a heart attack.  I would stick to beer or sake.

Now some people (aka the people at the table next to us) were really thrown off by the fact that such a sweet dish was given at the beginning of the course, but for someone like me who is addicted to sweets (and i mean SEVERELY addicted), this was a godsend.  For myself, I ordered the tempura french toast batons.... now for someone who is watching their caloric intake, I knew it was a bad idea when the waitress literally told me ""this is probably the worst thing you can ever eat. as in worse than any other desserts. but it is TOTALLY worth it"".  But I ordered it anyway. And she could not have spoken truer words. For $12, I got massive slabs of lightly battered french toast and it was AMAZING. The entire plate was filled with some brown and white sauce, fresh berries, candied pecans, caramelized bananas, and more.. and it was probably the best brunch item I have ever eaten in my life.

Phillipino Pancit was OK but not exceptional. Keep in mind I was ridiculously full so it was hard to appreciate anything at that point.

Student loan debt for days and a Visa/Mastercard statement ending in a strongly suggested exclamation make eating anywhere sans drive-through a rare treat for this little miss can't be rich. But by some stroke of luck, the stars aligned and I was able join friends for a long overdue ""fancy"" dinner.  Seated in the far back dining area, it was still nearly impossible to hear even the person sitting right across from you at your own table. I'm pretty deaf to begin with, but this is one of the loudest, intimate dining experiences I've ever had.  I was excited to dig into the drink menu, as the cornucopia of cocktails looked top notch, though the prices of each cocktail was more than my personal per diem. I decided on the lychee cocktail because I have soft spot for St Germain, but I was tempted by the jalapeno one as well. I liked that the lychee cocktail wasn't sweet, instead a perfect spirited transition from fruit to not-so-frou-frou beverage, but not a stunning cocktail overall. Admittedly, I've had better for le$$ at other city locales, namely Rodan.  I saw that Sunda is recognized as a place that's good for vegetarians, and while that's not entirely false, I can't fully agree with that label. Pescatarians are a go here, for sure. TONS of options. But if you don't cheat on fish, get ready to feel mighty left out of this shared plate experience. Our server prefaced our meal by saying that it's meant to be family-style, but as a large part of their menu is sushi or in odd serving portions where there might be a bunch of filler and 2 buns of goodies, it gets a bit awkward passing a dish that could only be justifiably portioned between two people. I mean, the portions are fine- but there's a difference between family-style and tapas, and tapas would be a much more fitting description for a vast majority of the dishes we dined on.  I think the highlight for me would be the brussel sprout fried salad and the stuffed avocado, though the stuffed haas comes with a somewhat hefty $17 pricetag, the tuna it was stuffed with was some of the better tuna I've had the pleasure to binge on. I can't say that you'll likely find me here for a full on dinner during an off-restaurant week time frame, but on a special ladies night out for drinks and a few app$, for sure.

2012-11-05,5.0,"I figure I'd come out of semi-retirement and write about Sunda since they did an amazing job for my mom's birthday dinner. The venue is much larger than it appears from the front.  There are small tables in the front room by the bar; there are seats at the sushi bar; long tables run alongside the sushi bar; a good number of tables in the main space, a private room on the first floor, and banquet room on top.  The design is modern but not sleek, more welcoming with the dark wood tables and communal tables. Tables are not too close to each other but it does get louder as the night goes on which can make conversation difficult. The service was phenomenal.  My mom didn't like the table we originally got, but staff was kind enough to switch us.  Our waitress, J, was very attentive and explained every dish in great detail and seemed to have an uncanny ability to know when we wanted to order more food or drinks.  My mom also got a candle-lit dessert for her birthday and a card signed by lots of members of the staff.  The busboys were also Johnny on the Spot with clearing dishes to give us fresh ones and boxing things up to go whenever asked; and of course my mom wanted to box everything no matter how little was left. The food is modern asian, but i will say with a big Filipino leaning.  It's the main reason my mom wanted to try it.  Personally it was weird for me to equate modern with Filipino cuisine, but it Sunda changed my mind.  We started with a small donut type puff with powdered sugar. It was tasty yet felt like starting with a dessert instead of bread. We ordered a bunch of ""small"" plates to start out with and share. They say small plates but the portions are normal sized.   -The brussel sprout salad is the french fries of salad, you can't get enough. It has a little spice that went well with the roasted flavor.  -The ookoy was a different interpretation I'm used to; Sunda's was kelp and all veggies which is a healthier version if you disregard the golden brown and delicious frying of using tempura batter I think. -The duck bao was more like a scallion bun and duck sandwich.  The scallions might have been a little overpowering but the amount of duck, with it's flavor, balanced nicely with it. -The loopya are filipino eggrolls, which are smaller and crispier than chinese eggrolls; they are also meat filled.  it came with sweet and sour sauce, meh, but the garlic sauce that came with it was awesome.  I love garlic so i thought it was perfect. -The crispy rice with kobe beef tartar was spectacular and a must try. The beef melts in your mouth. -The sisig we got was an off menu item we got. It used pork belly instead of the traditional liver and face meat.  This version was definitely a more high class version, but just like the traditional, it went great with beer. We were full after that.  But my mom wanted to try the Crispy Pata and Adobo Pork Belly.    -The Cripsy pata was very tender meat on the bone that you could cut off with a spoon.  It came with the garlic sauce mentioned earlier and what I think was a liver based sauce.  It was not overly fatty and had good balance of seasoning and was nicely crisp. The Adobo pork belly was huge. it was delicious and a great modern take on a classic dish, but almost too strongly flavored. I definitely needed the salad and also a side of rice to counterbalance the strength of the flavor. Then for dessert we had Ridiculous and the season sorbet.  The Ridiculous was vanila ice cream cover in carrot cake and caramelized nuts and brown sugar and cinnamon.  It was tasty but overly sweet for my taste buds. The sorbet was mango and had lots of fresh fruits.  That was more up my alley. I know it was a long review but we ate a lot of food and all of it was worthy of praise.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes amazing food at surprisingly well fitting proportion per cost ratio.  Most ""small plate"" places rip you off but not Sunda.  You will be full; and beyond satisfied.  Thank god my mom has no shame to take home a few Sunda bags filled with food so I have leftovers for later.",0.9987,0.779,0.169,0.052,0.546185185185185

2012-11-02,5.0,"Although recently I've been burned by the trendier eateries in Chicago (I'm looking at you Picolo Sogno) I'd heard enough about Sunda that I thought I needed to at least try it. What better time to do that, than my anniversary. I'm a huge fan of Asian cuisine (and my s.o. isn't) so whenever I get the chance, I try a new place. I did some convincing and viola! Sunda. Here's my review.     DÉCOR:   The decor is sleek, trendy and  clean, yet warm and inviting. Fully reflective of the 'fusion' cuisine. Someone took great care to ensure that sight lines were clear of restaurant apparatus (i.e. wait station computers, dish bins etc.) and that the room was properly lit and kept at a good temperature.  SCENE: I'm a firefighter, so this isn't the 'scene' I'm used to, but I felt welcome. Sure, there were the obligatory girls teetering on too-high heels and the suit-clad power ties but the clientele was very diverse and that was something I was glad to see. There were tables of girlfriends out on the town, businessmen and couples of all stripes who looked as if they were enjoying their experiences. SERVICE: When we hit the door we were greeted warmly and attended to like we were family. From the moment we were seated we saw a nice (but not overly frequent or pushy) parade of folks from the gent delivering sushi to someone who I assume is a floor manager of some type. Each one nicer than the one before.  Our waiter was knowledgeable, informative and funny. Giving us suggestions about the menu and ensuring we had the best possible experience.  FOOD: Here's the reality, I'm not a connoisseur of Asian cuisine, I'm a fan. I like a lot of different things, and as a foodie, even some that make the average person squeamish, but by no means am I hardcore about it. That said, overall, Sunda provided the best meal I've eaten in the last 10 years. I will follow that up by saying in those 10 years I've been to 5 countries and no less than a dozen Caribbean islands, one of which is the culinary capital of the Caribbean.  I'm not just whistling Dixie here folks, the food is THAT good. Here's the rundown: To start we shared the crunchy pig hidden lobster roll, which was unlike anything I've had. Yes, it's fairly basic (save the soy paper v. nori) but the flavors we're absolutely on point. I had two pieces of the Escolar super white tuna...then I had four more. They were perfect; cut on the proper bias, a good thickness and the proper amount of rice (nigiri style). If I had one complaint it would be that the rice didn't hold up to the chopsticks 100%. To me? Forgivable. Then we moved on to the Rock Shrimp Tempura. I've had it before, but never like this. It was wonderfully done; sticky caramel from the candied walnuts mixed with honey aioli and tempura shrimp. Then, the main course. Malay style Chilean Seabass, in a 'rub' of coriander, lemongrass, miso and chilis, on a bed of curried cauliflower puree. We both had the same thing, and thank goodness, because there would have been a fight. Hands down the best seafood dish I've eaten anywhere, including the islands. It was as good as any lobster or crab I've had (including the storied Hurricane restaurant in Kennebunkport) and served perfectly.  We ended with a complimentary dessert to celebrate (which was a hazelnut fudge cake with cream cheese buttercream) as well as the one we'd ordered, which was the 7 spice pumpkin bread pudding with Chantilly cream and orange caramel.  The bread pudding was beyond delicious, the cake was average. If any one asks, they SHOULD put the bread pudding on the menu, at least until spring. Seriously.  All in all, I am a Sunda convert. I love, love, love this place. It's worth every penny (which wasn't all that bad, frankly) and is definitely worth your time. Oh, and because it was a special occasion, we were given a very nice card  wishing us happy anniversary that also included a gift certificate for our next visit.

He was also helpful in explaining in great detail the various dishes and drinks. Food came out quickly, empty dishes were removed promptly and my water glass was refilled frequently. Also, when booking the reservation, I was asked if we were celebrating any special occasions. I mentioned that the one of the couples each had birthdays within the next week.

2012-10-05,5.0,"They know their shit.  Sunda is one of the best restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of dining at.  They have everything down so well - ambiance, service, food.  Sunda is a rather large restaurant. I hadn't expected it to be after reading a lot of the reviews. I had expected it to be small, warm, and hush-hush. Instead it was big, warm, welcoming, romantic, fun. Feel free to dress up or just come as you are. Nobody cares, all anyone there cares about is either delivering great food or eating great food.  The service is impeccable. Our waiter (like the asshole that I am, I forgot his name) was delightful. He was knowledgeable, had an opinion, and was incredibly fast. He was pleasant and charmed me, whether he knows it or not. He was able to make us laugh but also knew what we were there for. He recommended an item or two from each section, and he answered all of our questions honestly. Hats off to him and the rest of the Sunda crew.  Based on our waiter's suggestions, our cravings, and one friend's food scares, we ordered the following: - Truffled tataki tuna, salmon, american kobe sashimi, enoki mushroom, chive, soy, truffle vinaigrette. (My favorite of the night. I swear to you, you can smell the truffle oil before it even arrives at your table). - Rock shrimp tempura. (Good, but if you live in any major Asian community you won't be impressed).  - Lobster and wagyu roll: creamy lobster, scallions, jalapeño, wagyu sashimi, truffle-foie aioli. (One of the better and more interesting rolls I have had). - Baked seafood dynamite: kani, scallop, ebi, roe, avocado,scallions, cucumber, dynamite sauce, tempura crumbs. (It's okay to pass on this one). - Adobo braised pork belly. (A huge serving. Soooo good, but really heavy, so be sure to have a man or man-sized stomach at the table). - Pork adobo flake fried rice. (Amazing flavor with bits of pork. Good on its own but may be too much when accompanying the Adobo Braised Pork Belly). - Asian cheesecake: silky tofu cheesecake, crunchy cinnamon crumble and kabosu macerated, seasonal fruit. (Somewhat dry, but the flavor and creamy consistency still there). - Chocolate Mousse Cake: chocolate mousse fudge cake with yuzu pineapple and blackberry pureés with grilled pineapple, crispy feuilletines and fresh blackberries. (I'm whatever about chocolate, but my friends finished this one easily). As you can see, it was quite the dining experience. A couple of bottles of wine, and we were good to go. Our waiter took the desserts off the bill even though they were half eaten because I didn't like them. I wasn't being a brat, I swear - I told the waiter I didn't want dessert, but he put some on the menu anyway since my dinner partner kept insisting I try them. He came by at the end, asked if I liked them, I said no (I'm really just not into desserts), and he took them off. I was in shock, I felt horrible, but damn was I impressed! I love Sunda. If I lived in Chicago, this would totally be a weekly spot. Bi-weekly at the very least. Glad I don't live here, though, because this bill was definitely in the hundreds.

The only thing that fell flat for me was the saketini. It just tasted like cucumber vodka and I didn't really enjoy it. The Grass Tiger was a much better cocktail and a lot more fun to drink. The jalapeno in it gave it great spice and the ginger and lemongrass made it really refreshing.  Service was very good. The manager/owner? spoke to us twice to see if we were enjoying everything and we really appreciated that.,0.9962,0.688,0.294,0.018,0.5375396825396825
2012-09-02,5.0,"This is STILL my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I LOVE the food, drinks & atmosphere. Kristi at the front is such a great hostess and is so sweet! Although it is sometimes hard to get into, make reservations ahead of time or go in at lunch time for a less crowded scene. If you don't like a fun, loud, & upbeat scene- this may not be for you. The food is absolutely delicious! I can honestly say, I've never had a bad meal here. Some of my favorite items are: Rock Shrimp, Pork Belly Bao Buns, Baked Snow Crab Handroll, Lemongrass Beef Lollipops. (These are perfect on a tapas style basis, SHARE SHARE SHARE & find what you love!) If you love jalepenos and bacon? Sounds weird I know, the Crunchy Pig, Hidden Dragon is a must.  The combination of lobster, avocado, bacon, jalepenos, with a sweet chili sauce in this specialty roll is amazing. My favorite drink at Sunda is the Strawberry Palmer, which is a mix of absolut wild tea mixed with strawberries, lemongrass and lemon juice topped off withlemon lime soda. Last but not least: YOU CANNOT go to Sunda without getting ""The Ridiculous"" - it is one of the best desserts I've had in a long time!

2012-08-30,2.0,"This is one of those grossly overpriced restaurants that compensate for lackluster food with a trendy atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I came for dinner and like most reviews state, it is VERY loud making it very hard to hold a conversation.  We got the pork belly ban bao (buns), baked seafood dynamite roll (kani, scallop, ebi, roe, avocado, scallions, cucumber, dynamite sauce,tempura crumbs), crunchy pig hidden lobster roll (soy paper, lobster, avocado, jalapeno, sweet chili sauce, tempura crumbs, bacon) and the Sunda house specialty sushi spicy tuna with crispy rice and jalapeno.   The pork belly ban bao was smoothered with hoison sauce and pickled slaw.  Unfortunately, it masked the taste of the pork belly.  This is a common theme with some of the dishes we tried here.  Same thing with the rolls, they add so many extra things to the rolls that you couldn't really decipher what you were eating (if that makes sense - see pics).   I must say the one saving grace of our meal were the Sunda specialty sushi.  I never thought to have sushi with crispy rice before but whoever thought of this is a genius!",0.152,0.896,0.056,0.048,0.5009615384615385
2012-08-29,5.0,"Sunda embodies everything about what you envision when you think of a perfect night on the town in downtown Chicago.  The location is in the middle of all the action.  The atmosphere is about as hip and trendy as it gets, while still being welcoming and not pretentious.  And the food options are original, prepared to perfection, and presented beautifully.  This is the type of place where you wouldn't be surprised to run into a visiting Hollywood celebrity having dinner, but at the same time, reservations are easy to get for us common folk too.  The best part about Sunda is that the food lives up to the hype and reputation.   My boyfriend and I went to Sunda on a Friday night and were seated immediately on time for our 7:30 reservation.  Upon sitting down, we were immediately served with a little starter bite of a fabulous crostini with some sort of shrimp pate.  We started with a bottle of sake, and were pleased that they had both reasonable and fancy options.  It's hard to talk about Sunda without comparing it to their across the street neighbor, Roka Akor.  If you are a sake expert, then I'd have to say Roka probably has the better and more expansive sake menu, but Sunda's menu suited us just fine. After reading just a small portion of the 900+ reviews, it was obvious you can't go to Sunda without getting the rock shrimp.  It was every bit as delicious as described.  Not over-battered like I found Roka's rock shrimp to be, but more just a lightly dusted batter so as not to overpower the taste of the shrimp.  The candied walnuts and honey aioli added a light sweetness, without making the dish overly syrupy.  I probably would not order this again, just because it's one of the less original items and I'm more into the sushi-related items.  But it's definitely worth trying if you're a fan of rock shrimp. We then had the crab cake crusted ahi tuna sashimi, which blew us away.  The sashimi cuts were a little thicker so you could really appreciate the tasty crust, but seared perfectly so that the tuna was rare inside.  The soy glaze added the perfect flavoring and we were sad when this dish was finished.   We finished with the Tail of Two Tunas sushi roll.  Every ingredient was extremely fresh and of the highest caliber.  You could taste each individual flavor, yet they all blended together nicely at the same time. For us, with relatively small appetites, the 3 small items were the perfect size for us to be satisfied without being stuffed.  We probably could have added a 4th item to really fill up, but it may have caused food coma and enticed us to go back home rather than stay out for the night. I had dined at Roka Akor a couple times prior to this visit and had really enjoyed my experience there.  After our meal at Sunda, I had no recollection of the Roka experience.  It really was a perfect experience in every way.  When you are in the mood for a nice night out with a fun atmosphere, excellent service, and absolutely mind blowing creations, I think Sunda is the perfect choice.  I can't wait to go back and try many of their other options.",0.9989,0.784,0.196,0.02,0.5709259259259257

2012-08-23,1.0,"**Sorry Sunda, but the (1) ONE star is truly due to your Assistant Manager and the way she handles situations.** Food - 3 (at best, had better, honestly) Myself and 3 colleagues decided to try Sunda for lunch since we came across a gDine deal for it. Sunda is only a 10 minute walk from our office and thought we would try some of what we were told was ""GREAT"" Asian Fusion cuisine. The ""GREAT"" part was GREATLY EXAGGERATED. The food is good, but not great. We had a lunch special bento box and this is the meal I had. Miso Soup - Good flavor, warm, not hot, was just that, Miso Soup. Bento Box (Seaweed Salad, Spicy Tuna Roll, Chicken Katsu Curry) - Seaweed Salad was ok, under seasoned, tasted bland. Spicy Tuna Roll as someone else mentioned was over spiced, could not taste the tuna, but good thing I like spicy sushi rolls. Chicken Katsu Curry was good, chicken fried to perfection and not oily, the curry sauce is hard to mess up since it is just water and Japanese curry paste, this portion of the dish was well seasoned and flavorful. Dessert -  WE DID NOT GET TO THIS PART, ALTHOUGH WE PAID FOR IT (**SEE BELOW AS TO WHY**) Now for the reason I am giving Sunda a (1) ONE star rating To anyone who does not mind being called a liar and disrespected in public, this is truly the place for you! The meal started off great, we arrived, were greeted and were promptly seated. Since we had prepaid on gDine our lunch options were basically already decided. The ambiance was good, a little too dark for my liking but doable. The staff seemed to be on their A game until it all went to hell. During the meal, my colleague and the server kept on going back and forth with playful banter about spilling the drinks. A little bit of Sake was spilled initially and a joke was made about taking some money off the bottle, and that rolled on throughout the meal. The server came back to the table numerous times and each time she would say a little something and my colleague would say a little something, both would laugh and on with the meal. While waiting for dessert, the Assistant General Manager approaches the table. She asked us how the meal was and  we acknowledged her letting her know that we had no complaints and all was well. She then began to state that her staff said we were being rude to them and were calling them ""F*ing Retards"". My colleague asked the Assistant General Manager did he hear one us call her staff members that and she said, No, but was told by her staff. At first we assumed she had the wrong table, because no such language was used at our table and above all, we never would have disrespected anyone like that either. Then the Assistant General Manager began to attack my colleague verbally stating, that he did call the server an F*ing Retard and she would like it if we left the restaurant immediately. We told her we were waiting on our desserts and she said I will comp your Sake, but please leave now or I will call the police. ""CALL THE POLICE, really!!?? My office is very casual and we were dressed in T-shirts, but do we look like HOODLUMS, that we need to be escorted out  by police officers?? We were not dressed like everyone else in the restaurant and we assume that had something to do with it as well. We decided to leave to avoid any further interactions with the Assistant General Manager. The last thing I thought would happen today was that I would be Disrespected, Publicly Humiliated and Kicked out of a restaurant for Absolutely NO REASON!

2012-08-13,5.0,"Just dined here tonight with a good friend after it came highly recommended by a few co-workers. I had youtubed a video on it which really stirred my interest. It's all in tagalog, which I speak, so for non-speakers you might find it hard to follow. But of course, it's all about the food, and that needs no words.  youtube.com/watch?v=KTQf… Here's what we ordered: Mizu Martini (Watermelon) Lychee Luxury Drop Martini Appetizers: Ox Tail Pot Stickers Adobo Flake Fried Rice Main Dishes: Crispy Pata Honey-Ginger Braised Beef Shortrib Congee Review: The drinks were to be expected, a bit on the sweet side for the Lychee, but very good. We found the appetizers to be well-balanced. I particularly liked the Ox Tail pot stickers. They were truly different and the ox tail had good flavor. The sauce was similar to Toyo-mansi (for those familar with filipino sauces) maybe leaning more towards a citrus mirin/ponzu sauce. The Adobo Flake Fried Rice was also very good. It was a little reminiscent of the filipino-style breakfast rice dishes (Tapsilog, Longsilog, Tocilog) It was quite garlicky so for those who are put off by that, beware. I'm always a sucker for a fried egg atop rice, it makes me feel at home. Not too sweet, not to sour and definitely not too vinegary as some Adobo-infused dishes can be. Overall a well-balanced dish and flavorful dish. The main courses we found to be quite exquisite. The Crispy Pata was very tender and will be well received for those Lechon (roasted pig) lovers. The sauce it came with was very similar to the Sarsa Lechon that is always served with filipino style roasted pork, but with a slight hint of chili. It also came with some picked radish salad that was decent. We both really enjoyed the Honey-Ginger Beef Shortrib and Congee combination. I'm not a fan of arroz caldo only because I had overkill growing up. My mom would always make it when someone was sick and in large quantities, but this was something else. After watching the youtube video on this, I had to try it. The large quantity of beef was literally falling off the bone, spoon and fork tender, nicely seasoned. Literally, to-die-for style beef. The congee was good, could've used a bit more of it, but its taste complimented the beef well. They make the congee with butter and the drippings from the beef so it is overall a rich dish. Easily enough for two, but some/most will not want to share. Our bill came out to $106 before tip and valet ($11.99+tip). While it is on the pricey end, the food experience was well worth it. We left happy and will gladly come back. I'm actually planning on scheduling a group/family dinner here for my college grad in a few months.",0.9967,0.797,0.163,0.04,0.4820859213250518

Located in the downtown area, of course the environment was absolutely beautiful. We sat down and the word to describe the decor of this place is sleek. Tables with intimate lighting fixtures. This place is doing it right. As you might already know readers, I am Filipino. I enjoy the cooking of my people and I am super judgmental of Filipino restaurants. This one blew me out the water. Who knew Filipino cuisine could be highlighted in such a great way? I did. But now the posh downtown Chicago folks get a chance to taste it. How exciting.  We ordered the braised pork belly and the adobo flake fried rice. Yes, adobo flake fried rice. Adobo is a meat (in this case pork) braised in soy sauce and vinegar and the meat is flaked/pulled and thrown into the fried rice. It is so amazing. The rice was cooked perfectly and served in the cast iron pot. The adobo braise pork belly was so tender and juicy. The depth of flavors were so complex yet brought me back to a familiar taste. This is a must try when you go there. We also had the five spice fried chicken and some place over fry the chicken leaving it dry and tasteless. Not Sunda, in their fashion, the of course made is juicy and delicious. The five spices added a bit of a kick but sweet at the same time. The the dishes were presented like they were going to be served to royalty. (you eat with your eyes first). To wash it all down I got some mango iced tea. The iced tea (unsweetened) comes to you in this huge carafe and a little tiny pouring cup on mango syrup (flavor and sweetener) so you can control how sweet or unsweet you want it. Genius! Our server was knowledgeable and attentive even though the place started to become hectic, she kept her cool. So I challenge all you readers to give Filipino food a shot here at Sunda and I am sure you will not be disappointed.

The waiter forgot our drinks twice (blamed it on the bartender) tacky.  He always acted very rushed and like he had somewhere else to be.  There were different servers bringing the food, which they literally threw it down in front of us and off they were.    The drinks, I had the watermelon martini which was very good, and my boyfriend is a scotch drinker. Twice they brought him the wrong scotch. The first time the waiter promptly changed it out, but the second time he refused. Now my boyfriend knows his scotch, he has been drinking it for years and has like 30 different scotches he has collected.  I thought that was just unexceptable service!   Our food...the Brussel sprout salad was amazing and we also started with prawn crab Rangoon and pork belly skewers which were all very impressive, very well cooked . Then onto our main courses which were not quite the success.  My boyfriend had the sesame grilled lamb, and I had the pork shank. The lamb chops were unetible. The lamb was RARE or raw whichever yuck. I had the pork shank which was very good.    Told the waiter that the lamb was raw and he seamed very irritated. Kind of like who do u think u are. Whatever. Right there kind of ruined our meal.  He accommodated my boyfriend sent it back.  About 15 minutes later after we had to ask him twice for our drinks he cames back and says.  Sorry about that lamb, they cook it in a water bath, I looked at it and it was a little flimsy. What???  Flimsy. Is that code for raw?    The place is so loud you can not hear the person next to you talk. Like super loud, even for me   Not impressed. Way to hyped up.

By far their best deal is the ""Sunda Social"" 4-6pm (I think) offer on weekdays where many of their appetizers/rolls are half off! A few favs: -Shishito peppers as a starter is always delicious. They're not too spicy and nicely charred.  -Brussel Sprout salad is fantastic. -Oxtail Potstickers are delish  -The Duck Hash is INCREDIBLE. One of the best things I've ever had.  -The ""oh no you didn't ultimate handroll"", but ask them to make it into a regular cut roll.

Plus he was pretty easy on the eyes :) Some of his recommendations included the Crispy Brussels Sprouts Salad, a must get even if you are not a fan of Brussels Sprouts. The texture and Asian flavor with the woodiness of the Brussels sprouts was fantastic. Also, he recommended the Unagi/Foie, rice topped with fried unagi and foie gras. It was also great, very interesting texture but great flavor together.  My friend got the Sea Bass entree that basically melted in your mouth. The fish was prepared so well and really showcased the natural flavor.  My other friend ordered the slow roasted short ribs. It was also excellent, extremely tender and the seasoning was a perfect Asian short rib flavor.  For the three of us it was a bit pricey, but we did order some of the more expensive items on the menu along with a round of cocktails and a bottle of wine.

I went here on a sunday, and for the first time ever, I got an industry discount because i too work in a restaurant. (I think my boyfriend and I reek of the ""hey! I'm young and i wait tables!"" smell).  It was 50% off select dishes and appetizers (most of them, pretty much), which made my boyfriend and i happy campers.  The food ruled. We ordered ahi tuna, and sushi with american kolbe beef. The tuna was prepared rare and had tasty glaze on it. Overall I've had better ahi tuna before since the one here was a bit flavorless minus the sauce. The sushi was not my favorite, i thought that cooked beef tasted a bit odd with the combination of other sushi flavors.  I ordered the pork shank for my entree, and when that hunky piece of meat arrived to the table, i felt like i was feasting in the middle ages.

This is the one item I rank as stellar. -Sunda Poke -- Seemed covered in some sort of mayonnaise type sauce, I have never had Tuna Poke as ""creamy"" as this one was, and I wish not to again. -Stuffed Avocado -- this freaking thing was $17.00 and was about 3 bites in total.  Our table laughed at how small it was for the price.  It was spicy tuna with some avocado on top.  AVOID. -Confit Pork Shank -- I have recently stopped eating meat, but the dead animal carcass lovers at the table really enjoyed this $26.00 masterpiece. -Noodles -- this was something that I could have made at home.  AVOID. -Scorpion Roll  -- It was a softshell crab roll that was so mundane and boring, priced at $16.00 for 5 pieces.  Another laughable item at the table.  The rolls here are very expensive.  Since this one was under $20.00, this one would be considered a bargain at Sunda. In summary:  The drinks seemed to have 0% alcohol in them, and they were conveniently priced at least $13.00 each.  Oh wait!  Even just a Ketel and soda = $13.00.  WTH?  Our server was outstanding, Michael I believe.  A+ for that.  I just have a hard time swallowing $16.00 for a 5 piece soft shell crab roll, plain, with no sauce at all.  This place is popular and trendy, but as far as food reviews go, I am not impressed.  There are so many other great places to go to in the city where you won't feel like you were kicked in the face upon the bill arriving.",0.9121,0.764,0.128,0.109,0.6074664224664225

The place was pretty loud anyway, so your neighbors don't really distract your dining experience.  We ordered a variety of apps, rolls, buns, and entrees to share between the four of us. Food is certainly tastey, but the fundamental recipe are mostly based on food you can get from Chinatown or Thai restaurants for a small fraction of the high price they charge here. Don't get me wrong, I think they certainly use good ingredients and the presentation is above average (note - not great as I would expect for this price), but as anyone who really know AUTHENTIC Chinese & Thai food can instantly recognize, it's a $10 plate dressed up as a $25 plate because you're in a hip place.

Rolls are overpriced, but maybe it's because I'm use to tons of sushi and asian options in the San Francisco bay area where there are tons of giant rolls that are nowhere close to Sunda's extreme prices. Nevertheless, you've got to try Sunda at least once. Our order for the night for the two of us: - Beef lollipops - probably one of the best things we ate that night. I didn't really taste the lemongrass but you can't really go wrong w/ meat and ponzu sauce. - Duck steam bun - good onion bun, duck and sauce tastes like every other dim sum peking duck. - Garlic noodles - Not bad. Light amount of garlic in a small serving that was perfect to split for the two of us and allow us to eat a ton of other dishes. - Brussel sprout salad - This is a warm salad. I didn't care for the dressing at all. I think it's a fish oil base? Too bad the waiter put the dressing on before I could say STOP. Luckily the bf liked the salad so I had him eat most of it. - Summer roll - Avocado, asparagus, mango and other greens in a rice paper wrap. Pretty refreshing and definitely a ""summer"" feel - Crab/lobster roll - way too expensive ($19) for something that tasted just OK. I think the name of this was something like couching pig hidden lobster or something along those lines. - mango ice tea and a mango soda - $8 ea!! They have an interesting way of serving it though. You get one shot glass with the mango syrup, a cup of ice, and a large canter of ice tea or soda (sparkling water). You can mix as much (or little) syrup as you want for your perfect tea/ice/syrup ratio.  Oh, noise level was pretty loud in here so it was hard to hold a decent conversation.

I would say that my favorite thing about Sunda is that you can get dishes that simply aren't found anywhere else. Places like Gibsons and Joe's Stone Crab are wonderful.

Purchased a Gilt City voucher a few months ago for Sunda for a five course meal; decided to cash it in for lunch recently.  When you walk in, you are immediately transfixed on the gorgeous decor of the space: a large dining room that had different spots for sofa areas and long tables in the middle of the room. Sushi bar was on one side and a private dining area in the back. Everything about this place screamed high class.  Now for the menu. As mentioned before, dined on five courses: warm spinach and mushroom salad (the olive oil topping on the salad gave it a lot of flavor); chicken and mushroom shu mai (dumplings...yum), Summer of Sunda roll (liked the avocado in it); Pancit Canton (nice mixture of the egg noodles and roasted chicken), and finally a plate of mochi for dessert. I believe that the Pancit was the best dish of the afternoon...their interpretation of a classic Filipino dish and probably as good as what my Mom usually makes (and that's a high bar to jump over).  Another bonus is how the service treated us. I've had many experiences where restaurants would give you less than stellar service if you flash a discount voucher in front of them, but not here. Angie, one of the managers came by early in the meal and welcomed us and assured us that we would not leave the place hungry (which, judging by the boxes of leftovers we had to bring home, was definitely true). Our waitress was polite as well, and when I came to her to ask about an overcharge on the check, she apologized and gave us the correct one. Genuine and no attitude.

2012-04-09,4.0,"Updating my review for Sunda! I went here this weekend for Easter brunch and I think the verdict is that I like this place much better in the daytime than at night. Made reservations for brunch here for the fambam to celebrate Easter. (I highly recommend using Open Table to make reservations, plus you can score the points too! woot woot!) It was pretty cool because they sat us at the ""Chef's Table"" even though we didn't put any special request for it. The starters were really tasty, as a special they had Roasted Pork Bao and it was super tasty..I didn't care too much for the dipping sauces they offered with the bao but when we asked for hoisin sauce it was super delish. We also ordered the Pancit Canton which is a great dish to serve family style. I was really happy with what I ordered...it was so damn tasty. I ordered the pork belly on crispy rice patties. The meat was so succulent and the crispy rice added a nice crunch to it..but once you break into the yolk of the perfectly poached egg that sits on top of the dish...it's over...it just melts in your mouth. Another great brunch dish I'd recommend is the Loco Moco..it's one of my favorite Hawaiian plate lunch meals, but it's perfect for brunch..it's kind of like an islander version of steak & eggs...but better because it comes with rice and is ladled with gravy aka fatty yummy goodness. Another plus for brunch is that they have a bloody mary bar where you have the choice of vodka or soju, they bring the glass to your table & then you head over to the bar to add in any garnishes of your liking (I say bring your glass plus your appetizer plate because they even had kimchi, sausage, tofu, asparagus, and other veggies/items you wouldn't find on a typical bloody mary bar). Sunda is also great for lunch, if you're coming with a group GDine is also a great way to make reservations, they have great prices ($15/person for lunch with a prix fixe menu).",0.9981,0.72,0.238,0.041,0.6824548440065683

2012-04-06,5.0,"I'm always a little skeptical of anything ""Asian fusion.""  What's so fusion about mango chicken?  Which seems to be on every menu at these kinds of places.  End rant. Sunda absolutely delivered.  Actually, it exceeded any expectation I might have had.   The Space: Although I was traveling alone, I was told reservations were a must, so I made one.  But when I walked in, the only place where I wanted to sit was their lounge area just to the right of the entrance.  It drops down a few steps to make it an even cozier little area.  You could either sit on the wraparound communal bench with your back turned towards the street/window + admire the whole restaurant or you could sit on the wobbly stool facing the street/window + people watch.  I chose to admire the restaurant.  It's a pretty cool space, super high ceilings, dimly lit all around.  There's a sushi bar, a long communal table in the middle of the main dining room, and then tables all around. The Service: My hostess was definitely a bit rude in the ""I'm speaking to you in a really polite tone, but deep down really don't feel like talking to you"" kind of way, so I was beyond happy to have been given a server who was the complete opposite.  Noelle - not the peppy ""let me brown nose my way for a better tip"" kind of server.  She was a low-key kind of friendly, not over the top.  She was also gorgeous!  Totally girl crushed on this woman. BONUS! I am a Foursquare superuser, and therefore received 20% off my bill because I ""checked in.""  Noelle had no idea about the promotion, but she was happy to honor it. The Food: The reason I chose to dine here was because a particular item caught my eye: Pork Adobo Flake Fried Rice.  I am part Filipino, and Adobo (I prefer chicken) is a super popular Filipino dish I grew up with.  I'd never seen it on a menu in a real U.S. restaurant before (other than my local hole-in-the-wall, home-cooking kinds of places).  But adobo fried rice???  I had to try this.  So I ordered: Pork Adobo Flake Fried Rice (5 stars) - This can be shared or enjoyed as an entrée.  With a fried egg on top, this was tasty, had depths of flavor, rice was well-cooked, perfect balance of saltiness/soy sauce & garlic (really important in adobo), meaty chunks of pork (hate it when it's so fatty), an overall winner. Chicken & Mushroom Meatball (5 stars) - Three skewers with meatballs each.  Served hot & fresh, very tender, juicy, delicious, another winner. Longevity Garlic Noodles (3.75 stars) - This is definitely a good side dish to share, and I think is more enjoyable in smaller portions.  I could definitely taste the butter & the garlic without it being overkill.  Could've used another ingredient to me, maybe a fresh herb, but that's just me.  The noodles were a little too soft for me, but I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be cooked.  I'm probably being picky, but oh well!  Tellin' it like how I tasted it. ;) I do realize this is alot of food for a tiny girl, but when I travel alone I try to make friends with table next to me so I can share my food.  As soon as it arrives, I'm always like, ""Omg this is so much food... Would you please have some?"" :)  I hate wasting food!  And it's not like I can heat it up in my hotel room.  When unsuccessful at befriending a table, I give away to the first homeless person I see. Wish I had more people with me because there is soo much more on the menu I would love to try!  Not going to start naming them because it messes with Yelp's review highlights.  I will definitely be back, Sunda.  Thank you for one amazing, memorable meal.  I was here 6 weeks ago, but the flavors are still so clear to me.  That definitely translates into: You must dine here.",0.9991,0.734,0.207,0.059,0.5455909351692484

This place has been on my neighborhood To Do list for a while now, but I've always been swayed by other places, and turns out, rightly so. We only ended up here because Slurping Turtle was closed, and what a bummer. Our waiter, while polite, was just not on his game. My friend asked for a beer list, and he mentioned they were listed on the menu.  Once he'd walked off, she verified they were indeed not listed on the brunch menus, the only ones on our table. When he finally arrived, we were eager to order, as we'd waited quite a while to be seated for our reservation. Unfortunately, she asked for a beer which sent him darting off before we could go, ""Oh hey! Hi!"" to reel him back.  Another 10 minutes passed, and I was about to eat my chopsticks, when he finally returned with the beer to take our order. Now, the menu seemed a bit lackluster--nothing made me go OOH, I AM SO GLAD I DRAGGED MY ASS OUT OF BED FOR THIS. So I put in orders for two items. One came. After a sufficient amount of time, I asked about the second and was told it was coming. Either he didn't put it in AGAIN, or the kitchen staff was disorganized, because it STILL did not come out.  Order fiiiiiiiiiiiiinally came out, and he offered to comp it--yay, I mean, the hungriest person at the table got all the food last. Oh, did I mention nobody ever refilled our waters, ever? One of my thirstier friends grabbed a 5th glass of water, which had been placed on the table in front of nobody.  The ambience was nice, but not as impressive as I'd been led to believe by all the past reviews. With all the other top-notch sushi places in River North, the Gold Coast, Streeterville and the Loop, I can't see this one lingering near the top of my list anytime soon. Food was good, but not memorable. Service was polite but not attentive or quick. Ambience was nice but not eye-opening. For the prices, I'll go elsewhere.

It took an extraordinary amount of time to order our food, and this only happened once we flagged down our waiter. 3. The food took 45 minutes to come out.

I thought I was getting ripped off. The sushi rolls were decent... nothing to complain about.  The fish was fresh tasting. The steak filet that we got was actually pretty bad.  It was extremely chewy.  One of the worst steaks I've had in a while.  It was served in chunks and there was one that I could not chew up and I had to spit it out.  It is rare to do that in a restaurant for me. However, even with some of my negative reviews, the pork belly, two long strips of pork, was the best pork belly I've ever had.  Extremely tender, flavorful, just the perfect amount of fat and char.

2012-03-19,5.0,"I recently went to Sunda and was very satisfied. The service was fantastic from the waitress to the food runners and bussers. As  this was our first time, we asked our server for her opinions and she was so helpful. This was appreciated since we were one of the last tables to arrive. We started off with the Bang Bang Salad. The textures of this salad/ noodle dish were grand. It was sweet, tangy and so yum yum. Next came the Rock Shrimp Tempura. This was one of the most memorable dishes for me. It paired well with the previous dish with it's glazed walnuts and subdued sweetness. The honey aioli perfectly coated the shrimp. Again, the textures were heavenly. Each bite was like having an orgasm in my mouth.  I'm salivating at the thought.   As an avid sushi eater, a roll was mandatory. The No You Didn't Ultimate Handroll did not disappoint.  I loved how the tempura balanced out the softness of the salmon, tuna and crab.  At this point, we were getting full and the prospect of the next course was almost daunting. However, when the Shaking Beef arrived, my gorge mode was in full effect. The aroma had me  shaking with glee.  The filet was extremely robust in flavor. It came with lime sauce on the side, but this was unnecessary. In  fact, the sauce was a bit overkill as the flavor of the meat was so bold and mere seconds away from being overpowering. A bed of jasmine to balance the seasoning would have been ideal. Regardless, it was a fine cut of filet and cooked to perfection.  Devouring such vast amounts of food is certainly atypical. I am not gluttonous,  large or even close to medium. However, this menu was so unique and divine.  Thus, when dessert was offered, we had no choice but to comply.  When this magnificence was put before me, my heart sang. The vanilla ice cream was encased in a crunchy, sweet, warm sphere of exquisiteness.  With each bite, an angel got her wings. I'm fighting every ounce of me to not go there now soley for this divine creation.  Awesomely awesome awesomeness",0.9964,0.765,0.199,0.036,0.6306637806637807

The food is quality.  The menu is pan-Asian with singular dishes that hail from specific countries like lumpia from the Philippines to Asian fusion dishes that borrowed flavors and ingredients from a variety of Asian cuisines.  Our favorites were the seared tuna sashimi, lumpia, duck hash, and kobe beef sushi bites.  Many of the dishes like the rolls and sashimi were just ok on the other hand.  I would suggest staying away from the more classic type of Asian dishes and trying more of the unique Asian fusion type of dishes.  Most of the dishes are intended for sharing so it is great for larger parties and groups. On a Saturday night, this place was brimming with a unique mix of young-ish couples to older parties in their 50's to families with kids to gaggles of girls out for a night on the town.  The sound level is not quite stratospheric, but don't expect to be having a quiet conversation with your boo unless you're going to be sitting on his lap and whispering things in his ear.

Our ""Bang Bang salad"" didn't have any dressing on it. Seriously, how can you forget to put dressing on the salad? There wasn't even a drizzle and without the dressing, it was favorless.  The other big thing was the ""jasmine rice""; it was undercooked. We're asian. We eat rice pretty much everyday; we know when rice is not cooked well. This rice was wet so it was sticky and it was crunchy.  The main complaint that my husband had, though, was the pork belly. We were expecting a good amount of fat on the piece. Sunda's pork belly is so trimmed that there was only a hint of fat. If you like that sort of thing, that's great, but we were very disappointed. On the plus side, the ""Adobo braised pork belly ""was cooked very nicely; crunchy on the outside and tender inside. It tasted more like char siu sauce than adobo, though, but I didn't mind it. The ""Shaking beef"" was awesome. Cooked to the medium rare specification perfectly. The sushi was decent; we had the ""summer of sunda roll"", which tasted fine, but it was not rolled very tightly and the filling kept spilling out, no matter how I held it with the chopsticks.

I did not want french toast and bananas for restaurant week from this hyped up restaurant.  All in all they said sorry the host must have misinterpreted what was asked over the phone.  So we picked up and left it just wasn't worth wasting a birthday there or having french toast, ill go to ihop for that for 3$.  Thanks for wasting our time.",-0.8493,0.845,0.054,0.101,0.43461538461538457

2012-02-15,4.0,"I'm often at least a little bit skeptical of places that put incredible effort into decor and vibe. Not that I have a problem with an appealing space, but to me it should always be food first, scene second. I'm happy to report that Sunda does both quite well. I think enough has been said about the decor and vibe of the place--very cool space, great decor, cool bar, beautiful people--so I'll focus on the food.  If the very term 'Asian Fusion' has you thinking 'cliche' and 'overdone', Sunda will challenge those stereotypes. Loved the Toast & Jam, Beef Lollipops, and Devil's Basket (I'm pretty sure the titles of these dishes alone speak to the creativity of the menu here). Also, sashimi is not a commodity. It may be pricey here, but you'll get what you pay for in terms of freshness and beautiful cuts of fish. There's also a pretty extensive cocktail and saki list which is a great complement in my book. Be warned that menu items are anything but cheap, and they tend to add up given the small-plates sharing concept Sunda employs. I think it's also fair to say that you're paying a premium for location, decor, and for the privilege of seeing and being seen here. Also, in the spirit of full disclosure, I've had better sushi rolls in considerably less ostentatious atmospheres throughout the city.

I also highly recommend the crispy rice pan fried sushi - I've tried both the spicy tuna and kobe beef. The spicy tuna was very good but the kobe beef - ridiculously amazing. It's a rare occasion when I prefer beef over any type of seafood but Sunda has found a way to make it happen.  I've also tried a few of the sushi rolls - rainbow roll, mushroom lover, tail of two tunas, spicy tuna, and firecracker. All good, expect the mushroom lover was pretty disappointing. Being a mushroom lover myself, I figured this roll was meant for me. It was pretty flavorless and disappointing. I definitely wouldn't order it again. In addition to the great food, they have such a cool, trendy atmosphere and the service has always been great. The servers have recommended some great options and helped us figure out how much food to order for a group.

The Steam Bao Buns with Pork Belly is simply amazing. The pork just melts in your mouth. The Lemongrass Beef Lollipops were delicious. The beef was nicely seasoned and went rather well with the lemongrass ""skewer."" When I saw they had Adobo Braised Pork Belly, I knew I had to try it. I am so glad I did. This dish instantly became my favorite here. The flavors just melded together so well, I didn't want it to end. We also got the Longevity Garlic Noodles, which were pretty good. It was a simple dish with nice garlic flavor that wasn't too overpowering. The Crispy Pata dish was pretty delicious. It was a bit dry in my opinion, but not everything can be as mouthwatering as what my mom makes. Overall I loved this place.

The first time I came here I took a girlfriend out to dinner because she was moving to SD, CA and I wanted a nice atmosphere on a summer night. We got seated in the middle of the restaurant and even though it was an early dinner, the place was packed and LOUD. I don't even think there's music playing in the background but all the chit-chat from the patrons just filled the sound waves. Our server was very nice and explained the menu to us. We each got a meat entree (sorry we ARE omnivores).She got the braised beef short rib and I got the crispy pata and split a pork adobo flake fried rice. We swapped some of our entrees and both plates were so flavorful and moist. The rice was perfect to share for two with enough garlic to flavor.  I came back again for a 2 friends' birthdays with a party of 15 and had the same server from like 2 months before. This time we sat in front of the sushi bar on a long table with stools, which to tell you the truth, looks like a great set up, but sucks when you're wearing heels and a dress. One gentlemen from management (I believe) introduced and greeted us all personally and then all of a sudden, we were being asked for our IDs because he bought us all a shot. Nice, and thanks. I ended up getting the braised short rib because I couldn't stop thinking about it from before and tried the rock shrimp tempura (AKA honey walnut shrimp) which was very good, but the shrimp were teeny tiny. Still good though. We ended up ordering a dessert for the birthday peoples and I don't know if it's on the menu or not, but it was something of a taro bread pudding and it was DELICIOUS.

Rice on the nigiri and rolls was cold and a bit too wet (meaning that the chefs probably dipped too many fingers in the water when they scooped up the rice). Perhaps the dark lighting did not help the visual appeal of the fish... I feel like really good and fresh fish seem to look very vibrant. The rolls were pretty weird too and definitely had a local influence (who puts BACON on rolls?!?!). If you consider yourself a sushi snob, then I would not recommend this place.

2012-01-13,5.0,"I went here twice within two weeks. For someone who doesn't eat out all that often, that says a lot. Both times I went with girlfriends for the Sunda Social special which is their happy hour and food special from 5-7 Monday-Friday. This is the way to do Sunda if you are on a budget. The items on this menu (and a lot of their staple items are on it!) are half off. I listed the half-off prices to show what a great deal it really is. Both times it was only $23 a person! The first time I went, I went with 4 other girls and we shared everything. Some of us got the Mah Thai which was their special drink for the day and it tasted excellent. For appetizers  we got the edamame ($2.50), rock shrimp tempura ($7.50) and brussel sprout salad ($7). They are pretty large portions--definitely enough to share with 5 people. The brussel sprout salad may be the most amazing salad and version of brussel sprouts I have EVER had!!! The shrimp glaze/dressing that goes over it is absolutely delicious. The rock shrimp is also to die for. For rolls we got the firecracker ($7.50),  dragon ($8), tale of two tunas ($8). Firecracker is deep fried which I do not like-- I would not recommend this one. Dragon roll was also good. Basic shrimp and eel--can't really go wrong here. It did not stand out as original, but it was tasty. The tale of two tunas was the best roll of the night. Fresh and a little different than your classic spicy tuna. The fried shallots of top add a great crunch and is different than the basic tempura flake. In addition, we tried the hand cut spicy tuna and jalapeño on top of the crispy rice from the regular menu. This was okay. I thought the tuna lacked flavor and my friend said it was must better the first time she had it-- maybe it was just a bad batch! To end, we got the ""Ridiculous"" dessert. This was exceptional. Vanilla ice cream surrounded by ginger carrot cake and carmel. I die AND it is HUGE!!!! I came again with one friend who was dying to try Sunda and I was very excited to go back. For appetizers we got the brussel sprout salad and the toast and jam ($7.50). Sharing between two people you really realize how big the portions actually are. The toast and jam has such a cute nostalgic presentation. We tried the chicken and mushroom meatballs ($4.50) which were also outstanding. The hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce gives it that classic chinese flavor in a gourmet setting. For rolls, we went with the golden child ($7) and tale of two tunas. The golden child may be my most favorite roll I have ever tried! For a mango and escolar fanatic, this was my dream. Sweet and fresh. We ended with the ridiculous again and it did not disappoint.  This restaurant truly lives up to the hype. I would avoid the communal seating because the benches do not have a back. I would reccomend going with 2 other people and sitting at the sushi bar. The service is absolutely outstanding. Water is filled instantly when your glass is half full and they fold your napkins when you leave. You really do feel like royalty here!

Delightful.  The escolar bite with the potato chip on top was delish.

Aside from the fact that we had to wait about 35 minutes past our reservation time and the hostess was kind of snobby, we had a great time at Sunda.  The cocktails I had were delicious - some of the best I've had in recent times.  I highly recommend both the Blackberry Hime and the Toasted Ginger Snap.   It was my friend's birthday so the chef came out with a complementary sake shot.  Nice touch, although the magic wore off a bit when we saw him doing shots with other tables too.   Onto the food.  It was pretty much a pork love fest.  But who doesn't love them some pork?  Vegetarians I suppose, but I digress.  Two of my friends are Filipino and recommended we order mostly the Filipino items on the menu, though I did stake my claim in two sushi rolls for appetizers.  The Crunchy Pig Hidden Lobster Roll and the Firecracker were two of the best (if not non-traditional) sushi rolls I've had in a while.  Really good.  In fact, I want some of those in my rumbling belly right now.   We shared several entrees: the pork belly adobo, crispy pata, and the longevity noodles with crab (I guess you've got to take a break from the pork at some point) with a couple of orders of garlic rice.  I try not to think about the fact that when I'm eating pork belly I'm more or less eating a bacon steak.  I mean, it's so delicious, who wants to think about the fact that I'm probably gaining weight just by looking at the damn thing.  So I put that little detail out of my mind until I can't button my pants anymore (not there yet).  I think it goes without saying that this was a really good pork belly.  The crispy pata was also a knockout.  Get it.  You'll like it.  The longevity noodles and the garlic rice were nice and garlicky...I sure kept the vampires away that night.   After we left, I rolled my cholesterol laden self home and promptly had a heart attack.  Well, no not really.  But if I did, it would have been a hell of a meal to go out on.",0.991,0.795,0.154,0.051,0.5065883740883741

Then I went to Sunda a couple of weeks ago for a group dinner - meaning all of the food was pre-set. I asked the waiter (English guy - fabulous) to alert me to which of the dishes we'd be eating had gluten. He went all out - letting me know what I could or couldn't eat, bringing me special things - unasked for/uncharged - to supplement when there was a course I couldn't eat. This was above and beyond since there was plenty I could eat, but he made sure they made a special salad and dessert for me.  Most importantly, the food was fabulous.

It was crowded of course (being Christmas we expected lots of people) but we were seated promptly which was nice (FYI they would not seat us until all of our party was together, so if people are running late, etc. plan accordingly). We refused to pay the $11.99 valet service fee. really?  The ambiance of Sunda is nice, with warm lights and Asian inspired decor. However, it is LOUD. I could barely hear myself think. My mom, who has trouble hearing, could barely make out anything people were saying right next to her, let alone the waiter talking about the menu at the other end. We basically had to shout at one another at one table.They had music playing, which in the end, was not needed as people's voices took over any sound in the speakers. gross.  They have Sapporo on tap, so that's good. My mom wanted a mango ice tea. Several minutes later, servers set down two carafes of plain ice tea and soda water. They then set down mango and pomegranate syrup so we could mix the flavors into our drink of choice. A nice effort, but there was no explanation of how much syrup to mix in a glass, or why we had to mix our own drinks in the first place. We had to help my mom get her own glass of mango ice tea because she didn't understand the concept, and really...I can't blame her.  Appetizers were decent but overpriced in my opinion. Everyone seemed to be raving about the brussel sprout salad, but I...just didn't like it. It felt overcooked but no one else complained, so I guess I have weird tastes. The egg rolls tasted like hot dogs, and the crab dish we ordered came in a pot of cooked hot peppers that seemed only to serve as decoration since the crab itself was not spicy. I will say...the shrimp toast with tuna ""jam"" was the best thing we ordered. I usually don't eat tuna, but this was amazing and the textures were just right. I recommend it highly! The entrees were better. We ordered chicken, sea bass, braised short rib, and pork. The ribs fell right off the bone and was seasoned nicely. The chicken was decent, but nothing to write home about. The pork skin was a little too crispy for my taste, but otherwise delicious. The bass was cooked perfectly and tasted great (I recommend that one too!).  We were pretty full by this point, but we ordered a few desserts to try. My mom insisted on the chocolate lava cake, which was AMAZING. I love chocolate and anything that oozes chocolate, so that was a win. The fried ice cream also gets my vote..for some reason it tasted like something from my childhood, which brought back crazy memories of summer for some reason. The chef's special dessert of the evening was a walnut/caramel cake with strawberry compote and that was...interesting but not my fave; I found it to be on the heavier side than the rest of the desserts.  all in all, an enjoyable experience but I'm not sure if I want to return.

When Sunda is busy, they are very busy and they won't seat you unless your whole group is present even if you are short just one person. Since traffic in the area coincides with peak hours, we had to delay our reservation and it took a while to gather everyone and get seated. The restaurant shouldn't be blamed for being popular though and Sunda is popular for a good reason.  I never thought I'd say this, but you have to try the brussel sprout salad.

The place was packed and I was glad we got there precisely as our reservation was up. The hostesses were very welcoming and showed us to our table promptly. Our table was served by a trained (although not active duty) chef who was quite knowledgeable about the menu and how it was designed, was ready with a suggestion and did not hesitate to tell us her favorites.  We drank red wine and Sapporo on tap. I was a bit disappointed with how much colder the beer could have been (chilled glasses, wherever they are offered, may be spoiling me). For a restaurant that comes so highly recommended, I figured they would have this basic Our food was good, but not exceptional. We ordered the server recommended toasted Brussel Sprout salad, an Avocado stuffed with tuna and a Crab cake crusted tuna roll (maybe too much tuna for one night?). We enjoyed the first two and the third was just a little dry for our palates or at the very least for our palates that evening. The food was freshly made, and well balanced in texture and flavors. The presentation was very good, but left a little something to be desired.  We did not order any of the entrees as we really do enjoy trying several smaller dishes than be filled up on just the one. We thought of trying their dessert next. While settling on the easy was tempting, we decided to give a try to a dessert our server recommended: the Mango Tiramisu. We were glad that we tried it, but only in a way that you are glad to find out what not to get the next time. There was too much sliced mango in there, and it was oddly crunchy in texture. As someone who grew up eating what are fondly called the best Mangoes in the world, I can attest to the creamy and rich flavor and texture that this king of fruit is most famous for. That texture, among other basics, was lacking in this Tiramisu. It was served in a large, white creme brulee dish and It looked and tasted like custard more than like Tiramisu.  The place was abuzz. We were seated at a table for 2 just inches away from other diners in what was a very large dining room with ultra high ceilings and a large bar at one end. The crowd was a mix of families with kids. This really surprised me (just how many kids, infants and babies there were around us.) Not that there's anything wrong with it, but I gathered the place had a reputation for being a date place.  Something to think about for when we have kids of our own, I guess. Would I go there again? Probably not. There are far too many gems out there waiting and deserving to be discovered.

We arrived around 8 o'clock Monday evening and the place was packed! They offered us a place at the sushi bar, communal high tables or regular bar. We chose the bar (if you read my other reviews, you'll understand why).           Our bartender/waitress was incredibly knowledgable and friendly. She walked us through the menu and convinced to drink over six glasses of Moet as a result of the cute raffle they had going on. Each glass would get you some sort of prize, either a moet inspired stocking stuffer (I won a keychain, candle and flashlight) or a free glass of champagne. I was obsessed.          On to the food. We were both really hungry and wanting to try everything (or maybe it was me). Either way, as appetizers for the two of us, we ordered the dim sum style pork dumplings, edamame and miso soup (plain).  Then as entrees we ordered the lobster and wagyu beef rolls and dragon rolls. As well as an order of the 6 oz wagyu beef filet because desperately wanted to try it and see if it lived up to the hype. It did. It was delicious and served with a bowl of sticky, sticky awesome rice. The steak melts in your mouth the way every steak should. Amazing.         The lobster and waygu rolls were so fantastic. They were spicy as they had some sort of wasabi sauce and jalepeno tucked inside, but the spice was a gradual heat that wasn't overwhelming and didn't take away from the rest of the roll. We ended up asking for another order they were so good.  The dragon rolls were the best I've ever had. The avocado was fresh and actually had the taste of avocado which seems to fade at typical sushi places. The dumplings were served in a dim sum box and were sticky and tasty! The miso soup was also really good and not overly salty. My only regret is that I wish I would have tried it with oxtails.

2011-12-12,4.0,"I visited Sunda after hearing rave reviews about the atmosphere and food from a couple of different co-workers. As I live pretty close to it and my friend from out of town wanted to get dinner at a good Chicago restaurant (read: non-chain or tourist trap), I told her to meet me here for dinner. FOOD: Crispy shrimp ""toast"" and spicy tuna ""jam"" - Nice, fun dish. The shrimp were definitely ground up within the ""toast"", but this was delicious. Definitely something to get instead of edamame for a starter. Miso bronzed black cod - Fork-tender and flavorful, a perfect complement to the pork belly. I really liked this sablefish, and it was perfect with a side of Sunda's jasmine rice.  Adobo braised pork belly - I LOVE pork belly. And the serving size was enormous. It was prepared with care. Add all of those up? This is one of my favorite pork belly dishes of all time. Lychee and raspberry sorbet - Light and refreshing, this was a perfect dessert for the time. It was gone before I knew it! Sunda also has great cocktails (don't remember what I tried...perhaps another reason why I think the cocktails are so good??), and it's a trendy spot to hang out on a Thu/Fri/Sat night.  SERVICE: Service was fine overall. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable, and gave us good recommendations and suggestions. She was also around frequently to see if we wanted anything else and water service was top-notch. OVERALL: The hype is justifiable in my opinion. Sunda is popular for a reason - consistently good food, a great atmosphere (if not a bit loud), and a solid menu suitable for everyone. One small beef with Sunda - they don't have any ""half-portions"" like places like Sable have on the menu for its larger plates (although Sunda DOES have a good helping of small plates of their own). I'm the type of person that likes to try a little of everything, not a lot of one thing when trying out new restaurants. But the food quality and taste delivered, so no more complaining.

2011-12-11,4.0,"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to hit up Sunda forever! We are huge sushi buffs and heard this place was extremely unique and interesting.  Our server recommended the Peared Sake to drink. I like sake but I wasn't sure how this would taste. I ordered it and man was it good, I could have had five or six. Made with Grey Goose La Poire, Zipang Sparking Sake, pineapple juice, ginger syrup, and a cinnamon rim it was a fantastic mix of flavors. At $13 it was a little expensive but hey, it was my first time here. My boyfriend stuck with a good glass of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc.  We started with Rock Shrimp Tempura made with glazed walnuts and glazed honey aioli. We love the rock shrimp at FIsh Bar and this did not disappoint. The serving was quite large and I was pleasantly surprised with the result.  The star of the evening? The Lobster Wagyu Roll. Outstanding doesn't even come close to describing how amazing this roll is! I have never tasted anything like it and probably never will again! I've had Wagyu beaf at Roka Akor but when paired with lobster it was like nothing I have ever tasted. The scallions, jalapeño, wagyu sashimi, creamy lobster, and truffle-foire aioli was the perfect combination of excellence.  We also tried the Escolar which was under the category ""Topped Nigiri Sunda Style"". The Great White Tuna came with truffle shavings, a potato chip, and chives. Was it good? Yes. $9 for two pieces? Unacceptable. Macku does better topped nigiri for less and for bigger pieces at that with more creative toppings.  I wasn't impressed with The Number Ten roll. It was a tempura roll with shrimp roe, avocado, scallions, cream cheese, unagi sauce, and wasabi aioli. I just wasn't too impressed overall but my boyfriend loved it and I trust his judgement.  We also had some signature sticky rice with beef on top. I'm not sure the exact name but the server made sure to point them out. The rice comes with other types of meat and fish on top as well.  Generally, try what the server recommends but be prepared to pay. Nothing is cheap here but it's worth a shot. Dessert was also great. We had a wonderful dessert martini made with Effen vodka that our server so kindly split for us without our asking. For dessert we had vanilla bean ice-cream basked into a slice of carrot cake. Absolutely outstanding!  Four stars for some amazing signature dishes and drinks. The service was great and attentive and I appreciated the speed at which the dishes were paced.

We celebrated my mom's 60th birthday here. Indian parents are the true test for good service (even more so than the plethora of celebrities that frequent this place) because they can be extremely demanding and are not easily pleased. So, I can say without a doubt that the service was excellent. The restaurant was very trendy, and we got to eat at this large table in the center of the restaurant, which I thought was awesome, but everyone else disliked because of the bench seating. I knew they'd find something wrong with the place, so I'm totally fine if their only issue with the entire experience was lack of back support.  I had heard the restaurant was very loud, and it wasn't a problem at first because our reservation was at 5 pm, but as the place started to fill up it did get really hard to hear what everyone was saying.  The waiter introduced the menu by saying everything was set up for sharing. (Hey, I think I've heard that somewhere before.) So of course, we opted for the small plates/sharing. In addition to the salad, we really liked the corn fritters. The stuffed avocado sounded much better than it tasted, and the shortribs were fall-off-the bone tender but lacked flavor. I was confused though because he said even the entrees are meant to be shared, but it just looked like a regular meal to me. The drinks are also delicious and I highly recommend the Polynesian Storm. I will most definitely go back again for the brussel sprouts, but will try new items for the rest of the meal.

It wasn't good, and there weren't a lot of options. My friend said hers was so bad that it has ruined sushi for her for a month. On top of all that - all of our sushi came out at different times. My other friend, ordered a soup, which never even came at all. Our server was unapologetic, and didn't even recognize the fact that he had forgotten the soup and still wanted to charge us for it.  Then the bill came... We had to separate the checks ourselves, which we did; and we wrote all of the totals/separate on the back for the server so he didn't have to do any work. It takes him at LEAST a half an hour to come back... and he came back with incorrect change. Needless to say we were very irritated. The manager had to go correct his careless mistakes.  The food is completely over priced for what you get (not quality). The wine menu is pretty limited. The service was so poor - that almost that alone would make me never want to return here. We were there from 5:30-8:30. For someone who worked as a server in fine dining for five years, I would say that Sunda should be embarrassed.",-0.8452,0.82,0.071,0.109,0.47465986394557824

As with most nice places we had to wait, even with a reservations for about 5-10 minutes.  The service was pretty solid, even though the place was packed. The drinks were decent, but on the small side and the food was really good.  We had some appetizers, rolls, and some dessert.  The food was freshly made and the proper attention was given. My only problem was that it was so crowded AND they were playing music pretty loudly that it was a couple of octaves higher than I like to have it when I eat.

2011-10-31,5.0,"I was worried.  No lie, walking in the door I was sure we were going to get attitude and a seat somewhere in the back, possibly the basement.  This place is beautiful.  Gorgeous.  Huge, spacious and wonderfully dark in the sexiest way, I was certain the lovely hostesses would give us grief. Didn't happen. They were happy, helpful and polite.  Our seat was wonderful, and while it was situated right in the busy heart, it was comfortable and nice.  We opened our menus and were stunned by the variety and intensity of the offerings.  Everything sounded so wonderful, we had to come up with an immediate plan of attack on how best to try the broadest range of foods. Our waitress' arrival meant we had to toss out drink orders (which we had prepared) and we began with our first choices of food.  She was quick to give advice and assure us that we'd picked some of her favorites as well.  Even as it began to get busy, the noise level did not rise too high and we soon had the first round of food. This was it, the moment. Let me tell you something, I love food.  I eat all the time, whenever I can.  This stuff was amazing.  The worst stuff we had was the best I'd had in awhile and I ate here a night after coming home from NOLA.  This place has some magic they sprinkle in things.   Steamed Soup dumplings - Sounds crazy but these were the best soup in a bite I have ever had.  Somehow they manage to get the broth inside the dumpling so biting into each is this explosion of flavor in your mouth.  Its amazing and delicious. Lemongrass Beef Lollipops - Chop into these like the owl or unroll them and enjoy at leisure but if you like beef these are one of the tastiest ways to have it period, bar none, and I say this in this city.  These things are a miracle of flavor. Charsui BBQ Pork - BBQ pork, a staple of Asian style cuisine, usually something dessicated and chewy.  This was moist, succulent and delicious.  The pork flavor shined through and the smoky BBQ was amazing. Crunchy Pig, Hidden Lobster - Lobster rolls with bacon, SMART! Veggie Q Roll - Tasty, clever and refreshingly light.  A great accompaniment for any meal. At this point, understand, we were stuffed.  Full.  To the gills.  Bulging out of our clothing full.  But dessert, dessert had to happen.  Had to.  It was writ, burned into stone, like from on high. For dessert we had... The Ridiculous - Ever had fried Ice cream?  The Ridiculous is standard fried ice cream taken to the extreme.  Its the size of a football.  It could feed three people.  Its covered in this delicious crispy shell then drizzled and drowned in sauce.  Its delicious.  Anywhere else on Earth this would be a king of desserts.  At Sunda though, it is second to... Taro Bread Pudding - This is ambrosia.  No not your Aunts salad, I mean the Old School food of the gods kind.  This is the most delicious bread pudding in the city.  Its wonderful.  Words fail me here, but it tastes like sweet taro tea mixed with cream, cake and heaven.  That's all I have.  Its better than that but really, its all I can do.

Here, they just wrapped it around bamboo. So you get excited about sugar cane, and then get no flavor when you reach the center. Their Chilean Sea Bass dish was by far the highlight. We were already stuffed when it arrived, but put it down after tried a bite. Compare to West coast Asian fusion places, this place is overpriced.

Which is disappointing because this place has everything going for it. It's a cool space, great vibe, trendy yet still casual atmosphere, and the food is interesting but not intimidating (and above all else, just plain good!).  When I went for dinner, we had to wait well over an hour for our 9 o'clock dinner reservation, on a week night. I think having to wait an hour anytime you have a reservation is a little ridiculous, but that late on a Wed or Thurs is just silly.  Then when we went for brunch, there was no wait and we were seated right away. However, our server just never showed up. About 15 minutes after we sat down the manager finally came over (I'm guessing the ever increasing pissy expressions on our faces were a clue that something was up). He took our drink order and said the server would be right over (which turned in to another 5 minute wait). Unfortunately throughout our brunch the server was just non-existent. We practically had to do the ole wave your arms in the air across the room to get her attention thing, just to get her to stop at our table.  So why the 4 stars you might ask?

While I only went with the raw fish and rice, my fellow diners went with curries, and they both raved about them.  Service was impeccable. Friendly, attentive, and professional. And I have to say, I don't know what they do to their Diet Coke, but it may have been the best Diet Coke I've ever tasted (for reals).  So what keeps it from 5-stars? Little annoyances mostly: ~They don't leave the soy sauce on the table for you to refill your dish. They were attentive in coming back around to fill, but I disliked not being the Master of my Dominion.  ~Ginger was severely lacking. Not enough of it, and rather flavorless. Meh. ~This place is LOUD. Even for lunch, I had a hard time hearing my companions. I can't imagine what it's like in the evenings. I suppose its supposed to be that way, but I prefer to have a conversation while I eat.  ~Some lunch options are pretty reasonably priced, but the nigiri and sashimi options are some of the priciest I've seen in Chicago. While I rave about the quality, when you look at bang for your buck, it's not as tempting. $16 for four pieces of tuna sashimi. $8 bucks for two scallop nigiri. Etc. Adds up reeeeallly quickly. (read: I love it because it was on the company's dime)  I think I'll be back for ""Sunda Social""--happy hour from 5-7--drinks look fantastic and the deals look pretty damn good.",0.9745,0.806,0.122,0.072,0.6063929313929315
2011-09-14,4.0,"Been to this place a couple times now and I have to say that I'm impressed with the overall experience I've had every time.  I have mixed feelings about asian fusion restaurants because some dishes are so good when prepared traditionally, that someitmes the fusion version just doesn't measure up.  Anyways, here's the details on food, service, and venue: Short summary:  Highly recommended, great food, lively ambience, but a bit loud and difficult to have a conversation with a group.  But what can you expect from a restaurant that's really popular and hot right now. Food: Great selection, there's sushi, hot/cold apps, entre dishes, noodle dishes, and dessers.  My recommendation is that  you order a number of dishes and just eat family style.  It's the best way to try everything.  My favorite dishes so far:  crispy brussel sprout salad, rock shrimp tempura, truffled tataki salmon and tuna sashimi, and buddha style grilled ahi tuna and pork salad.  Also good, but not faves:  filet mignon(served chopped with side of kim chi and other ban chans), pad thai, and miso glazed black cod.  The truffled tataki sashimi is just awesome.  If there is one thing on the menu that I had to pick as a must try, it would be the truffled tataki sashimi(both salmon and tuna).  The combination of fish and truffle oil just washes over your tastebuds and leaves you feeling decadent and wanting more.  One flavor doesn't over power the other and you just get a harmonious taste.  The sashimi melts in your mouth and the truffle oil just gives it a nice luxurious finish.  Superb dish. Service: Very nice service.  I would say above average, but nothing like fine dining service.  The servers I've had were very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.  My water was always filled and the dishes were always cleared.  There seemed to be a manager(maybe owner) that roamed the floor asking each table how they're doing.  And he seemed to chat up some regulars that he knows, which was nice.  He also helped me out when I coordinated a private dining event and one of my guests was vegetarian.  He really did a great job in showing that guest their vegitarian options and adding it to our fixed menu.  So I would say great service in the private dining section, and above average service in the general dining room. Venue: Heavily asian themed in decor, the restaurant is beautifully designed and layed out for every type of taste or group setting.  It is very open floor concept, and it seems like each section takes on a different feel or mood. The restaurant has a big dining area that has a few sections.  There is a sushi bar you can sit at, there's a fully bar right when you walk in, there are high tables near the bar and sushi bar for a more casual get together, there are many different sized tables on the main dining room floor, there is a glass wall that separtes a long dining table from the general dining room(semi-private), and there is a private room that can hold from 12-50 people on the second floor(private bar up there as well).  The main dining room can get loud and I found it difficult to carry a conversation with more than 1 person at a time.  That would be the only complaint I have.",0.9974,0.814,0.151,0.035,0.5595984363894813

Super trendy and chic (and huge inside), and yes like others have said it is quite loud inside, so if you're looking for a romantic date night this probably wouldn't be the spot. But we were here for a bachelorette weekend, so the noise was not an issue for us.  Shaking Beef - Just eh. Tough and kind of bland to be honest. Uncle Paul's Roasted Chicken - Really flavorful and tender! Loved this one. Longevity Garlic Noodles - A real basic dish, but very very strong in the garlic department! It was weird that they served this dish last after all the meat dishes had arrived. Being the Asian gal that I am, I'm used to eating noodles/rice WITH meat and not separately. It was weird eating just the noodles by themselves, but it was good. Crispy Brussel Sprout Salad - This one was recommended to us by our server. I really can't stand brussel sprouts, which is why I was surprised by how much I loved this dish! Probably my favorite dish of the night. The bitterness that I usually dislike about brussel sprouts was cleverly masked by the salad dressing and the crispy shallots provided an excellent crunch.

My waitress was also celebrating her birthday on the same night.  I unfortunately forgot her name, but I really wanted to compliment her in this review.  She spent the time to walk me through the whole menu and advised me on what I could order that was gluten free.  There were plenty of options, and I appreciated her helpfulness!!   I was actually not feeling all that hot that night, so I went with the basic edamame and my own rainbow roll.  It was one of the best rainbow rolls I have ever had.  However,  I did have a taste of a kobe beef appetizer that was melt in your mouth delicious. This place is definitely along the vibe of STK in Miami.  A very young, hip crowd,,,borderline meat market.  But, I was sitting at a table with 5 guys, and all the other scenery (aka, scantily clad chicks) allowed me to enjoy my birthday and little sushi roll in peace. They also brought me a beautiful gluten free dessert that was a mousse type entree made of coconut milk and served with raspberries.  It was fantastic.",0.9964,0.722,0.264,0.014,0.5269565217391304

2011-07-27,3.0,"I've been to this restaurant twice. Once at night, when the crowd had their noses so far in the clouds, I felt if I ate anything I'd be misconstrued as a fat ass that needed lipo. Overpriced maki, but good...this was clearly a place that was a ""be seen"" place over food quality. Second time, lunch. Tried a gDine deal. For those not familiar w/ gDine...I recommend it to A. try multiple dishes at a new place B. get a great deal. I think our gDine was $19/person for 4 courses. The trick...you get a special menu, that may seem a bit limited. But hey, it's 4 courses and it's under $20. First course: app (spicy tuna roll, 3 pieces) Second course: soup (miso that was basically just broth) Third course: eck. This was a bummer. The menu contained mainly curries, which I thought was interesting, based on the huge sushi/maki list from my previous visit. I went for a shrimp, cod and sea bass curry, my bf for chicken katsu curry. His curry came out coagulated, almost like beef gravy that had been setting for like a half hour. WIth a dry and flattened panko chicken breast. It would've been a better stew, just wasn't fit for a curry. Mine came out wrong. It wasn't even what I ordered. But...they quickly got it right and it was quite delicious and flavorful. Fourth course: a delicious combo of mochi with dipping sauces. Hands down, my favorite part of lunch...and I'm not even a sweets person. Maybe I'd go there again?

2011-07-25,3.0,"Just like all of Billy Dec's ventures, they start hot and fade fast. I have eaten at Sunda 5 or 6 times. My first several visits were great, great service and great food. My most recent and final visit came last weekend.  The service was terrible, we had to basically beg our waiter to bring us a 2nd and 3rd round of drinks, our glasses were empty more often than full. I ordered my usual favorite the Miso Glazed Black Cod which was delicious as always however the portion was about half the size it usually is, it was literally gone in 5 bites(no exageration) when I commented to the waiter he said ""yes, fish prices have increased so we downsized the portions"" WTF??? Its a $32 entree, charge me a few more bucks and let me leave with a somewhat full belly. I literally had to order some appatizers after the main course because 2 other people in my party also ordered the Miso Cod based on my recomendation. Party of 3, 3 rounds of drinks, appetizers and no dessert $397 tab before tip and we left hungry for the most part.  A year ago this was a 4-4.5 star establishment, my visit in May 2011 was a 3.5 star experience and my most recent July 2011 vist was 3 stars at best.

2011-07-24,4.0,"I went to Sunda last weekend for brunch with my sister. It was my first time there for brunch and only my 2nd time in general. Let me just say, as far as service goes, it was one of the BEST experiences I've had since living in the city for 2 years. Sunday brunch is a perfect time to go to Sunda because it was not crowded at all and the noise level was very conducive to a quality conversation. First thing I loved about the brunch was that they bring you out a complementary piece of caramel covered banana bread as a starter. It was to die for and actually might have been my favorite part of the meal. The other signature thing Sunda offers for brunch is one the coolest bloody mary bars I think I've ever seen. Although, I don't drink bloody mary's, the unlimited garnishing bar included over 20+ items including for bbq eel (amazing) and every vegetable imaginable for only $6.95! Plus there were small plates at the bar, in case you just wanted a side dish of veggies etc. From our waitress, to the hostess, to our water guy, everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating.  We ordered as an appetizer the steamed sticky rice which had a wonderful smooth flavor. It was a bit salty for my taste, but I am super sensitive to that. Then for our meals, we ordered the eggs benedict (one of my fav brunch items) and the firecracker maki roll. The firecracker maki roll was great, but the eggs benedict unfortunately came out cold and just was not good. However, when I told the hostess of this, she apologized profusely and asked us if we wanted anything else. We decided to order a few desserts including the chef's daily special and mochi instead. When we got our bill, the eggs benedict was taken off and we received a 20% discount, which essentially took care of one of our desserts.  Very good customer service!!!! Overall a great experience, with the service and atmosphere topping the actual food in my opinion. I would definitely go back and try lunch or dinner there.",0.9898,0.83,0.13,0.04,0.5454323308270679

I prepare at home by rolling the ground pork, beef, shredded carrots, potato, chinese cabbage, ginger, peppery Philipino filling in a thin lumpia wrapper.  What was served was more of a sausage consistency rolled in a thick egg wrapper...not horrible, but not as moist and vegetable/meat describable an appetizer as I would have liked.  The dipping sauces were tasty.  The seabass was off the chart --flaky, moist, flavorful but not over powering of the fish.  I could eat the seabass dish every day!  The pureed cauliflower just didn't do it for me.  I wished there was more flexibility in the menu to allow the guest to substitute the side items rather than be forced to order based on the 'chef's plan' as described to us by the waiter.",0.9007,0.848,0.111,0.041,0.635

By the end of dinner, I was screaming in utter joy. The food is designed to be served family style, which I like because I can pick at a little bit of everything. Personally, I ordered the Crispy Pata and Baked Snow Crab Roll.  Both MUST HAVES.   The Crispy Pata was crispy and tender.  It came with a garlic foie gravy and another sauce.  The other sauce was sour and the perfect compliment to the pork. The Baked Snow Crab roll was just amazing.  No other words.  I would order 3 of them and be completely satisfied with my meal. I also picked at what my friends ordered.  My hands down favorite was the Rock Shrimp Tempura.  Definitely ordering that when I go back...and definitely plan on going back!

The Sticky-Icky Rice, Pad Thai and Miso Glazed Black Cod are also favorites of mine.  On my most recent visit, the service was a little slow to begin with (took the server 5+ minutes to greet our table), but once we got rolling everything was fine.  Some people might call the atmosphere ""trendy"" but it's on the milder side of trendy. My 60-year old dad didn't feel uncomfortable here. It's warm and inviting. The dining room is a mix of square tables, and large group tables accented with long rectangular ivory-shaded chandeliers. The decor is modern and Asian-inspired with exposed brick and dark wood. They have great private dining space, a huge sushi bar and a lounge behind the main bar for a casual night.  For those looking for a little excitement, keep your eyes peeled. You never know who you might spot -- everyone from athletes to musicians to movie stars have been known to stop in.  P.S. Follow @BillyDec on twitter.

So because the head chef is Filipino, Sunda has some Filipino flair in some of the dishes on the menu which is very cool. The Gilt City tasting menu was an excellent deal and a huge amount of food.  I started with a speciality cocktail, the Blackberry Hime. It was pricey at $14 but it was amazing. Hennessy with blackberries, mint, lemon juice, apple soda and lavendar. It was unlike any drink I've had before. I could have drank 5 of them! But to be kind to my pocketbook and my senses I stuck with the one. I can't emphasize enough how awesome this menu was. We got to try so many dishes and it was such a large amount of food! Round 1- Southeastern chop chop chicken. I found this salad to be very fresh and tasty but it was a bit too spicy for my super sensitive tastebuds due to the jalapeno dressing. Round 2 - Sushi Round.  Tail of two tunas-very fresh & tasty with some spice to it.  Mushroom Lover Roll-WOW! Highly recommended will order this next time I go. Round 3-Lemongrass Beef Lollipops. I don't like lemongrass so this was probably my least favorite round of the night. Round 4-Rock Shrimp Tempura-AMAZING! Anything having to do with honey sauce has got to be good and this was no exception. Round 5-Chicken Breast Tobanyaki. The chicken was so moist & flavorful. Fantastic dish. Round 6-Adobo braised pork belly. best dish of the night! Do not miss this dish. Best pork belly I've ever had.  Round 7-Dessert was a tray of mochi. I love me some mochi and this was better then the usual mochi I get from the frozen boxes at the market. It was melt in your mouth good mochi. It came with some sauces for dipping which was a new spin on mochi and I did try each sauce, but personally I didn't necessitate them at all. I'm in love with red bean anything so devoured the red bean ice cream mochis! Atmosphere was good and decor is pretty awesome.

I would even say incompetent.   The hostesses were rude and seemed to have no sense of organization.  We had reserved an area in the lounge and in the dining area.  It took forever for us to be seated in the dining area (way past the actual reservation time), and at one point, we asked if they had seated our party since the group has dispersed because they were taking so long.  The hostess took us to a table that was supposedly our party; a bunch of Asian people seated there(we were also Asian) and these people had no idea who we were.  I could not believe that the hostess mistakenly thought our table had been seated and then maybe thought  we were supposed to be seated at the table because we were all Asian.  I asked her if she thought ""we all looked alike.""  Once we got seated, we ordered some sake, and it took the waiter about twenty minutes to come back and tell us that the sake we ordered was out.  We asked why it took him so long to report that to us.  The waiter offered no apology nor did he attempt to make any suggestions for what to drink.  Then the waiter brought us our food.  We ordered a lot of food; he hurriedly announced the dishes he was putting down on the table that we could not understand him.  As it turns out, they gave us a wrong dish.  What was the worst was since we were a party of eight, the bill automatically figured in the tip of 20%, which, in my opinion, the wait staff and hostesses deserved zero.  I am starting to think that the service was so poor because they knew they were going to get a 20% tip and didn't bother trying to do their competently.  The quality of the food is very good but the incompetent service renders Sunda a poor rating in my book.  A great restaurant doesn't get sloppy with service just because they have been around for awhile.",-0.9763,0.816,0.067,0.117,0.4494444444444444

Sunda is an asian-fusion restaurant that offers Chinese-Viet-Thai-Japanese dishes.  Not sure if there's much of a 'fusion' since each dish is distinctively from their origin, but each dish shines well on its own.   Stand-out dishes are the oxtail potstickers and duck hash.  The meat in both dishes were flavored perfectly and extremely tender and juicy.  Let's put it this way, I dined solo and both portions were enough for two.  I wanted seconds, heck THIRDS after I was done.   The service was decent.  My waiter disappeared a few times throughout the night and my water glass was left empty of two occasions.  I actually had to flag down another waitress to get a second glass of wine. Despite the lack of service, I would gladly go back to Sunda for the AH-MA-ZING potstickers and duck hash and the lively atmosphere.  For some truly stellar food, I'm willing to overlook an absentee waiter.",0.9418,0.823,0.127,0.05,0.45396825396825397

2011-06-16,5.0,"I've been to Sunda twice and both times have had a fabulous experience.  The first time was with a few friends for dinner.  The menu is huge and all the dishes are made to share.  We started with sushi, rock shrimp, and the longevity garlic noodles.  Round 2 we ordered another round of the noodles and sushi and also the adobo braised pork belly and a sea bass dish.  The girls I was with ordered the sea bass thinking it was the sea bass toban, but when it arrived we realized that the toban was a special the last time they were there.  The server was so accommodating and offered to take the sea bass back and give us something else.  We were fine with keeping it, but the next thing you know, the manager on duty (Brian Cummings) came up to our table to tell us that he's having the chef whip us up a special sea bass toban just for us.  We were shocked (and of course after the toban came out completely amazed by how delish it was).  Talk about outstanding service!  Everything we ordered was delish, cooked perfectly, and the sushi was very fresh.  We had a few of the specialty drinks also.  After such a great experience, I decided to go back a few weeks later with my husband for our anniversary.  Once again, we were treated with the same fabulous service we got last time.  Our server, Rachel, was so friendly and nice.  We started off with the tuna and white tuna sushi, edamame, and the chicken sui mai.  All delish and again the sushi was very fresh.  For dinner we shared the duck breast (it was wrapped around a pepper with an amazing sauce) and once again the adobo braised pork belly (officially one of my favorite dishes ever).  We were stuffed by the end of the meal and wouldn't have gotten a dessert, but to our surprise, we got a complimentary dessert since we were celebrating our anniversary!  Vanilla ice cream with a tempura batter and caramel - so so yummy.  The drink menu is pretty reasonable for Chicago - a glass of champagne ranges about $10+, their specialty drinks anywhere between $10-15, and bottles of wine.  I've been scouring asian restaurants around country for a Lychee martini and I finally found one I love at Sunda.  The Divine Lychee is by far one of the best lychee martinis I've had and would go back for that alone!  I don't know if my words can really do the food justice, all I can say is Sunda is definitely a must try.  Impeccable service paired with outstanding food and a chic atmosphere.",0.9992,0.743,0.247,0.01,0.5104808590102707
2011-06-16,2.0,"Went here for the Gilt City 5-Course tasting menu for 2.  Let me say that this is the 3rd  such Gilt City meal we have purchased and the prior two both set the bar rather high.  After the meal I'm still trying to figure out the hype of Sunda.  The staff was friendly, but both the drinks and the food left us lacking (not in portion size - that was huge - but in well balanced flavors.) In total we received 8 dishes.  None were superb and the huge portion sizes were completely unnecessary.  They sat everyone with the Gilt City dinner together (neighboring tables) and all but 1 table left with multiple bags of leftover food. It also did not appear that the flavor profiles were considered in the coursing and progression of the meal. 1st Southeastern chop chop chicken salad: Not a bad dish, but not really inspiring.  This dish would be great for lunch (by itself), but had to much going on for a starter.  The salad was heavily dressed and it looked like half a chicken was atop the salad. 2nd Spicy ""Tail of Two Tunas"" Sushi: Nothing spicy about this roll.  Just your average tuna roll. Mushroom Lover Sushi: Just your average roll again. Kinda bland. 3rd Lemongrass Beef Lollipops: These were good but simple.  Living near Argyle St on the north side there are a few places that serve similar items (Ba Le for instance). I've had better before.  This is also where the course progression went awry as the single chili slice atop each ""lollipop"" overpowered the later flavors in the chicken and pork belly. Rock Shrimp Tempura: More like sweet-and-sour pork batter on shrimp than an actual tempura.  This was by far the best dish of the night.   4th Chicken Breast Tobanyaki: Good in concept but bland in execution.  The pesto-like spread on top was not flavorful enough to enhance the chicken below. Adobo Braised Black Pork Belly: It's pork belly, so it can't be bad. Good but uninspired....definitely not memorable  (I can get pork belly anywhere...do something with it that will make me want to come back!!!!) Dessert Ice Cream in Gelatin with Jellies: A nice idea but poor execution.  The combination of the plate used for service has low sides and the fact that the ice cream melted far before the gelatin was soft enough to easily cut made this more of a challenge then dessert should be.  (Cutting them smaller and serving on individual spoons for single bites could prevent this.) The cocktails ranged from hits to far misses in the 3 we tried.  They also didn't have any after-dinner cocktails which I thought was a bit odd. With all the other places to eat in Chicago I doubt we'll give Sunda another try.  Sorry...",0.9895,0.81,0.131,0.059,0.5300613275613276
2011-06-16,4.0,"Our server told us that a lot of food was coming and he wasn't kidding.  The 5-course Gilt City tasting menu was loaded with so much food.  Yup I left at the end of our meal with a food baby. We started with the chop chop chicken salad.  The salad was light and the peanut jalapeño dressing was tasty.  By the size of the salad, we knew we were in for a lot of food.  They happily boxed up anything we couldn't finish.  If we had actually finished everything, I would've slipped deep into a food coma before dessert. The next course were the apps.  The rock shrimp tempura was a really good version of honey walnut shrimp from my favorite Chinese take-out place.  Crunchy small nuggets of shrimp with glazed walnuts and a creamy honey aioli.  We also got the lemongrass beef lollipops, which were ny strip slices wrapped around some lemongrass.  The beef was very tender and was good with the spicy chili sauce. Stomach capacity = 50%.  Then the sushi course - a Mushroom Lover's Roll and a two-way spicy tuna roll.  One roll for true mushroom lovers and the other for spicy fans.  Both rolls were good and very filling. I'm now at about 80% and our main entrees are now rolling out.  The Chicken Tobanyang was good, but my favorite dish of the night was the Adobo Braised Black Pork Belly.  Hell yah!  Two huge mouth watering slabs of pork belly in some tasty adobo sauce.  It was pull apart fork tender with crispy edges and I wanted to eat more and more, but had to tap out.  The leftovers made for an awesome lunch the next day, followed by some food coma. I had no idea what the dessert would be, since it was chef's choice, but I was happy when I saw the mochi ice cream platter.  So full, but must... eat... balls.  The mochi was super soft and were filled with some green tea, vanilla, red bean, and strawberry ice cream.  My favorite was the vanilla mochi with the hot caramel sauce.  At the end of the meal I was at 110% stuffed. The service was great and very attentive.  Also as part of of our tasting, the chef de cuisine stopped by our table while we were feasting on the pork belly.

We tried several cocktails.  My favorite was the Lychee cocktail, which was very refreshing.  My friend had the Blushing Geisha, which was really good.  I did not like some of the other cocktails that we ordered. We had the chicken/mushroom potstickers, which were not as special as I thought they would be.

It's a very nice restaurant - beautiful design.  As we were eating - the restaurant got fuller and much louder.  I would not suggest this restaurant if you are looking to have a good conversation and a quiet night. We had a few dishes to share, here are some thoughts: Oxtail Pot Stickers - Being from Hawaii - we are very used to Oxtail.  Our Chicago native dining companion didn't seem to have much experience but the name oxtail is pretty....interesting.  It is basically a shredded braised beef (no funny tails) in the dumpling.  Delicious!   Pancit Canton - Your basic Filipino pancit dish.  I didn't think it was great but it wasn't bad - definitely more of a commercialized dish so I didn't feel the authenticity was all there...but that's what happens in a asian fusion-y restaurant so I expect it. No You Didn't...The Ultimate Handroll - This is usually served as a handroll but our waitress offered that we could get it as a cut roll which we did.  I thought this roll was good, not great.  They stuff a whole bunch of seafood in it to make it the ultimate - but I think I personally prefer more delicate and subtle flavors.  And I seem to remember the red cabbage more than anything else... Crunchy Pig, Hidden Lobster Roll - A very interesting dish - a very good dish.  I hardly see bacon in sushi dishes but all the ingredients in this dish worked so well together.  We had a non-sushi eating companion with us who actually ate and enjoyed this roll.  The tempura crumbs are good and were seasoned with a little extra something - a little extra awesome maybe.  :) Lobster and Wagyu Roll - FAVORITE.  I could have just ate this all night, I love raw wagyu sashimi on sushi mixed with lobster, truffle...oh my - ah-mazing.  It tastes clean and fresh with wonderful flavors, definitely recommended. All in all, a great experience!  So glad we had this the night before we left.  Not gonna lie - it was a pretty hefty tab but it's great for group dining.  Can't go wrong with good food and good service.",0.999,0.7,0.274,0.026,0.5538867521367522

My experience with Sunda was great.  Lyn P whose review you can find here too, recommended and met me at Sunda while she was on a short visit to Chicago post her vacation to other lands.  Her company was very much appreciated because she knows her food and upon her great recommendation I found a new place to take friends to when I visit.   Jojo - if you are downtown on your visit, I recommend this place. Sunda labels itself Asian Fusion which usually means a slight higher level of Asian food with a mix of various dishes from other Asian countries.  Sushi predominates the menu but you see a sprinkling of Filipino, Korean and Thai influences.  The Filipino dishes are presented in a familiar but tasty presentation.  The fried egg rolls are thin and meaty.  The sauces on the side gives you an option of the vinegar or sweet n sour sauces.  I prefer the sour, Lyn prefers the sweet.  I also ordered the Pork buns (pulled pork that is placed in between steamed buns and delicately flavored).  As with new places I over order and also got the spicy tuna sushi which had the nice spiciness that I craved for with some crunch as you bit into it.  Lyn ordered the garlic noodle dish and was happy with her choice. We had some tea with pomegranate juice (you are provided both items separately (small glass on top of the pitcher that you mix together to get the right taste for you). Overall, the food was good, pricing reasonable and since I overordered, I brought my leftover pork buns to savor for dinner. Note:  Lyn mentioned that the Chef was Filipino which is why there were some Filipino dishes in the menut that often are lacking with Asian fusion cuisine restaurant.  Most Filipino dishes are mix of various cultures from Indiai to Chinese to Malayan and Spanish influences.",0.9881,0.897,0.101,0.003,0.43858482787054215

We couldn't get a private table but were perfectly happy at one of the community tables with a 360 view of the drinks bar, the sushi bar, the other community tables and the private seating area -- all great to view! The ambiance was probably my favorite part of Sunda - very River North, a sort of open, contemporary, chic, spacious feel with lot of artistic flair that envelopes you and makes you want to linger. A real-estate that stretches from practically Lasalle to Clark on Illinois is certainly impressive and that space has been put into very good use at Sunda.  Customer service was great as well - when a friend of mine couldn't hold her drink (literally), the spill was cleaned up promptly and the drink replaced just as quickly!  The food was good but I think I was expecting better. Loved the corn fritters, the roasted chillies but my vegetarian caterpillar sushi looked better than it tasted and a couple of the sides fell by the wayside. The ridiculous dessert ( fried ice cream wrapped inside a carrot cake) was phenomenal but the pudding recommended by our waiter was pretty disgusting.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the night was the drinks menu - again they sounded great, looked pretty great, but flattered to deceive.

2011-05-14,4.0,"Whatever negative reviews you've read about the service, let me say that I have nothing but positive to say about the service.  The menu can be intimidating, and our waiter put us at ease.  He helped us pick a saki, since neither of us know the first thing about saki.  (I know enough about wine not to order a wine from Sunda, though.  Can you say obnoxious markups?  $12 bottles should not cost $40.)  He also helped us determine how much food to order, and gave good recommendations for the times when we couldn't decide between two items. For the record, we ordered duck hash, the ""Oh no you didn't!"" roll, the roll that featured lobster and bacon, the pork belly, and the Chilean sea bass creation.  For desert we had the Ridiculous.   For me the dish of the night was the lobster and bacon roll.  A ton of creativity went into that one.  I had the duck hash to myself, and my wife had the ""Oh no you didn't!"" roll to herself.  We enjoyed those dishes, for sure.  I love duck, and this was a real treat. The pork belly dish was great (and I look forward to the leftovers this weekend).  My wife liked the sea bass more than I did.  It might be because I was getting full by the time the sea bass came out, as it was the final dish. I liked the Ridiculous, which is saying a lot because I don't care for carrot cake that much.  The nuts made it shine, I think.  Aside from the wine selection and pricing being a disappointment, I would say that Sunda could do a little better when it comes to dessert selections, though.  I wasn't dying to try anything else on the menu, and dessert is a very important part of a night out for us.",0.9388,0.754,0.141,0.105,0.5987567987567988

The space is gorgeous, trendy and cozy all at the same time (hard to say trendy and cozy together), and the different dining areas provide a different experience. The front lounge is casual, and the place my friends and I spend a lot of time in for Sunda Social (Drink specials & 50% off menu from 5-7, Mon-Fri).  The dining area is lovely, more reserved, and the communal tables provide a friendly area to meet others if you're up for it.

Everything is meant to be shared, so the entire dining experience becomes a new, great memory.

The meal starts out with miso soup or mixed green salad (both fresh and fab) and then California or Spicy Tuna roll.  It was a little surprising that you only get 3 pieces of the roll, but I liked the roll because it wasn't too overpowered by the rice.   Since it was still Lent, my Catholic-self could only choose from the salmon or the sea bass curry.  I opted for the salmon (oxtail broth and napa cabbage) which was delicious.  However, after sampling the sea bass curry from my friends, I decided that that dish was absolutely the winner.  You just wanted to keep eating it.   The best deal/part of this meal was the dessert as they do not skimp out on the portion sizes.  The bread pudding they have is AMAZING...and I don't even like bread pudding.  Once the waitress mentioned that there was taro, sweet corn and some cream in it, I knew I had to order it.  It was the best bread pudding I've EVER had...and I was in this major food coma after that.   Loveeeeeeee! * gdine.com  is pretty cool.  It allows you to pre-pay for your meal when making a reservation on the website.  You can also pay using as many credit cards as you want.  The ""catch"" is that you have to prepay for tax and 20% tip.  (I didn't really mind that as we were scoring an amazing deal as is...and you don't have to worry about splitting the bill after the meal.  You know, when all you want to think about is when/how you can take a nap.)",0.9977,0.771,0.225,0.004,0.57421875

However, my Sunda experience started out rocky. We had reservations and still had to wait awhile (prob. 10 minutes or so) lucky their food won me over in the end.  Sunda, word to the wise, switch you amuse-bouche back to the pork chips ASAP. People loved them on yelp and new amuse starts off the meal on a very poor flavorless note. I think the waiter said it was crab something? I was starting to think my Sunda experience wasn't going to be a good one!  Sunda saved themselves with the following in order of how much I loved them!  1) Sunda Signature Sushi, shrimp tempura, avocado, wasabi. I think this may be my favorite thing I have ever eaten. I could eat at least 3 orders of this myself. '  2) Roasted Duck Hash Salad, great flavors, highly recommended. Nice bug hunks of moist glazed duck in a wonderful sauce topped with an egg.  3) Rock Shrimp Tempura. I feel this is a really trendy dish at the moment, available with slight variation in many Asian fusion restaurants at the moment. I haven't met one I didn't like. This one wasn't my favorite I have ever had, but I would totally order it again, so clearly it was still good!  4) Rainbow Roll: My boyfriend warned me not to get sushi because everything else was so amazing at Sunda, but I didn't listen. It wasn't that the sushi was bad, because it was good! The sushi rice was wonderful and the fish was nice and fresh, but with all the amazing food at Sunda, don't waste your time with the basics.

Now, I don't get the whole, we don't seat incomplete parties because they probably would have had a bunch of drinks waiting for me and our tab would have been way more, but I digress...if that is your policy, whatever.

What you should try: Devil's Basket: wok tossed crispy soft shell crabs (2), dried chilis, shallots, scallions, toasted garlic - Amazing.  The crabs pick up the hint of heat from the chilis.  If you don't like spice you'll probably be fine.  This is a good spice, not a ""fire in the hole!"" sort. Oxtail Pot Stickers: braised oxtail, caramelized onion jus, ""white"" wasabi cream - extremely tender, just wonderful.  Dim Sum style. Any of the Truffled Tataki Sashimi; the Summer of Sunda Roll, or the Lobster and Wagyu Roll.  Or the Firecracker Roll.

Let's move on. So's I walk into Sunda after way too much drama in my life to meet a super model by the name of Preet (Erika G, are we writing the same review?). Kiss kiss out of the way, it was time to get a drAnk on. This is happy hour and the drinks are on special but the sizes don't differ. They're huge. I started with a Strawberry Delight. What's in it? Muddled strawberries, rum, happiness, and a little forgetfulness. It's also approx. 3 feet tall. I ordered another on sight. Once the alcoholic fruit juice started to race through my veins and I started talking about what ailed me, the last of our party arrived (V & M) and we moved the party from the bar to a proper table. One thing I hadn't bothered to take in in my haste to get lit, was that Sunda is very cooly decked out. It plays up the Asian Fusion thing, but never forgets the essential three elements mentioned up top: Pretty. Sexy. Money. Almost everywhere you look, you'll see the three and, by the time you leave, you'll feel like, at least, two of them. A new seat calls for a new drink, so I stumbled on to the Blushing Geisha. Had I not been so [redacted], I might have given some pause to the name. Nope. Not tonight. What's in it? Again, strong booze I can't taste, fruit juice, essence of blackout. Seeing that the union of my ass to my seat might not last for much longer, my crew decided on food. Do this. At happy hour (half-off) prices, you can't go wrong. On Anything. We ordered a scary amount of grub, but the winners were the duck hash (duck, daikon, egg) and the shrimp toban (shrimp in egg sauce). Sopped. We sopped that isht up and didn't care who watched because we looked d@mn good doing it. Food in belly, I continued my tour of the cocktail menu with a mai tai. You'll expect the rum. You won't expect the muddled pomegranate seeds. Even though booze is all the dessert I need, we ordered the Ridiculous. Or, the Slapyomama. Or, the Stoptalkingandeat. Or, whatever it's called. The best carrot cake dessert ever. Ever. I don't know what it's like to go on a date here or have a proper, multi-course dinner. But, as far as happy hour drinks, food, scene, and price is concerned... I don't know how you can do better. I don't know that you can.

The sushi was absolutely delicious!!! We ordered the firecracker roll and finished it so fast that we needed to have another!!! I'm no sushi connoisseur but in my opinion, this was by far the best sushi roll I've had in a long time.

We were greeted by a warm and friendly staff upon arrival, which was fantastic. Often times, you go to these hip and trendy restaurants, and the host staff ends up being complete jerks who are more in to themselves, than actually providing great service. This was not the case at Sunda, and I really appreciated their professionalism. Within minutes of being seated, we were offered a complimentary small chicken and mushroom salad (delicious). As for starters, we ordered a couple of Dim Sum dishes: soup dumplings and oxtail potstickers (good, but the least favorite part of the meal), as well as the longevity garlic noodles and baby bok choy. We also ordered the Oh No You Didn't hand roll, as well as the garden vegetable sushi roll.  If I could have re-done anything about what we ordered, I probably would've dropped the oxtail potstickers and swapped it out with the chicken and mushroom shu mai. We didn't have dessert this time around, but I've had a couple of dishes before, and remember really enjoying it. The service was impeccable. We never had to ask for any water refills, and as we finished plate after plate, the server assistants were there to seamlessly remove it from our table. Overall, the meal was fantastic and the service was wonderful.

Really good and unique combination that makes you want to have more and more.  Looks great on the plate and even better in your mouth.  Second thing must try is the their spicy ""tail of two tunas"" roll.  The combination of two kinds of tuna, avocado, and the spicy sauce makes it a magic tasting roll.  I could eaten two whole rolls by myself.   But let's back up.  There are a few other unique things to start with like the seafood fried rinds that arrive on the table as you sit down.  Incredibly colorful pieces that you hesitate to eat because they look beautiful.  But do take a bite - taste like a light pork rind.  Also try the warm edemame with a tiny bit of salt.  Then order the rock shrimp in tempura batter with mayo sauce and candied walnuts.  The one disappointment was the other signature roll with fried tuna and jalapeño.  Kind of a bad experiment that tasted like fried fish in buffalo wing sauce and a jalapeno on top. Dessert was also pretty good.  Can't remember the custard that we tried but had this ice cream covered in caramel and candied walnuts that was the bomb.  Wow.  Also, shout out to the white orchid tea from mighty leaf.

In terms of ambiance, definitely reminded me of other trendy Asian fusion restaurants, like Tao, but certainly felt very ""in"" and hot, and I think it's important that you feel like you're somewhere hip and cool. This place is in and trendy right now.  As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by very attractive staff, which is always a plus, and they seem very purposeful in ensuring your table is prepared in an adequate amount of time. In the meantime, you head to the bar.  The cocktail list is pretty great...they make an awesome Manhattan, I think they call it the 110.  Highly recomend it. My gf had a Mai Thai, and it was hilariously served in an over-sized glass goblet, Hawaiin style...pretty sure they tried to drown her in booze, but it was certainly exactly what Saturday called for. The service was splendid.  Not overbearing, but just enough to ensure nothing was left amiss within the menu.  Personal favorites were called out as well as a general order of operations ---sometimes asian food is hard to interpret in terms of appetizer versus second course etc and here they make sure your meal flows smoothly. For apps, we ordered the ox-tail pot stickers and loompya.  I have to admit, this was the sole part of the experience that I wasn't completely psyched about.  The pot stickers were quite average, I found them to lack flavor.  The loompya were described as a mix of pork/shrimp, a play on the traditonal egg roll, but I found the pork to completely overwhelm the palate, and I didn't like that -- my gf did tho... : / We decided to stick with sushi.  The truffled tuna sashimi is to DIE FOR!!! It honestly melts in your mouth and its flavor is incredible.  So good that we ordered a second serving!!! For rolls we had the Lobster Wyagu, Caterpillar, and Dragon.  They were all excellent!

Sunda would be the perfect place for after-work drinks and dinner, or any occasion really. Sleek, sexy and proper are words that came to mind when walking around the space. Good looking people and friendly staff filled the room. The ambiance was fantastic. I believe our waiter was in training, and not only was he very professional and detailed, but was able to give us great suggestions on favorites.  We started with the Yellowtail Jalapeno,under Sunda's Signature Sushi. The roll itself sat on a cucumber drizzled in zesty sauce with some jalapeno inside. Very fresh and light. The Ocean Garden Salad was also a nice start. The cocktail list was very fun and ample. I tried the Blushing Geisha and Peared Sake, both of which were strong and out of the box. The garnishes and rims were a cute touch. My friend and I also shared a bottle of Sake. What's sushi without Sake? For rolls, we rocked it out with the Rainbow, Firecracker, Lobster and Wagyu Roll. The Lobster roll was by far the best and most interesting roll I've had in awhile. It's filled with creamy lobster, scallions, jalapeño, waygyu sashimi, truffle-foie gras aioli. Order this!! Unreal. Of course I was stuffed, but I had to try this delightful Almond and Banana cake they were offering on special. I ate the whole piece alone and I don't feel one bit bad about it.

2011-03-12,2.0,"I had been dying to try Sunda since it opened. I recently started working right around the corner and was craving Asian so decided to take the opportunity give Sunda a try.  The only positive was that the staff was surprisingly very nice, especially the bartender who handled my takeout order.  The negative = the food.  I ordered the Loompya and Lo Mein with beef off of the lunch menu. I really wanted to try the sushi instead but couldn't fathom spending that much money on lunch ($30 wasalready pushing it...) I'm pretty convinced the Loompya came from a freezer bag. You know those terrifying frozen snack taquitos soccer moms feed to their kids? Yeah... I'm pretty convinced the loompya here is made by the same company. They didn't taste fresh to me whatsoever. Several of my coworkers tried them as well and agreed, many of them joking that it's something that would be decent when you're drunk --- but that's about it.  The Lo Mein was super greasy (and that's going out on a limb for me since my grease tolerance is pretty high, ha). The dish in general was bland and so greasy that I could only eat about 1/4 of the dish before tossing it. The only positive was the bok choy mixed in.  In short? I don't get the hype. I'm guessing that perhaps Sunda is better known for their sushi than for their other dishes?  If I had bought the loompya and lo mein from a street cart or a food court and had  paid $7 for it, I'd totally be fine. But getting it from such a buzzed-about restaurant and paying $30 for things off of the lunch menu? BLEH. Not a fan.",0.9916,0.783,0.176,0.04,0.5888875770693953

2011-03-08,4.0,"Sunda was some good eats! I'm just glad I wasn't the one paying because they're a bit out of my price range for everyday dining. But, for a special occasion, I think it would be nice. The decor was very modern and angular and the lighting was on the romantic-side at dinner time. However, the place was bustling, so if you're looking for a ""quiet"" dinner, this probably isn't the way to go. Our server was energetic and informative, which is always appreciated, especially when one is not familiar with a particular cuisine and might need some recommendations.  We started with drinks and apps. I got the Matilda--always difficult to pass up when a place has it on draft. Yum. Others at my table opted for cocktails and wine. Again, prices run a little high, with cocktails and $12-$13 dollars. For appetizers we had the Roasted Duck Hash (complete with fried egg on top--score!) and the Rock Shrimp Tempura. Both were tasty and very satisfying. Loved the batter on the shrimp! Not oily, but crispy perfection! Items were brought out as they became ready, but there was not more than a couple minutes lag-time between the items. Then came dinner, and I was very happy with my entree choice...Note, these entrees are designed to be shared, but we opted not to. I had a nice meal with one dish to myself, it was the perfect amount of food for one person--maybe even a little too much since we had appetizers. My choice was the ""Shaking"" Beef. The lime-pepper dipping sauce for the wok-seared beef was so refreshing--a perfect accompaniment with the greens. Others at my table ordered sushi (definitely not my thing) and other pork entrees. Everyone seemed please with their selections. Dessert was a nice ending to the meal. We had something called ""Ridiculous"" which consisted of a ball of tempura ice cream with carrot cake, caramel, walnuts, and whipped cream. It was aptly named and ridiculously delicious. We also got the cookie plate, which was less impressive but nice if you just wanted a few sweet nibbles to go with your after-dinner coffee. Overall I was pleased with my meal at Sunda. My only complaint is the pricing, but I guess you do pay for quality. My only disappointment was that we didn't have an celeb spotting that evening--although I did see a dude that vaguely resembled Ryder Strong of Boy Meets World fame, if he had a beard. I really don't think it was him, though.",0.9972,0.79,0.181,0.029,0.6433281573498963

2011-03-04,4.0,"This is another spot we've passed a few times going to our other favorites but decided to check it out for lunch today.  Sunda is nothing like I'd imagined because at first, stupid glance... you can assume that it's shallow, pretentious and sans food worth digesting. I am enthralled that was totally wrong about the good cuisine here! I started with a nice glass of Trace merlot and ordered one of the best bowls of miso I've sucked down in about 10 years... ever since my favorite Japanese place near Wrigley closed that used to make homemade sakuri mochi wrapped in toasted cherry leaf.  Well this miso isn't overly-salted and is quite generous with the seaweed and tofu. WTF is up with other places skimping on something so cheap as tofu in their miso? What gives? Not Sunda. This is a nice bowl of miso that comes to the table in heavy porcelain. Next up in my lunch special were 3 tasty and most spicy tuna rolls. They're the perfect size for a lunch special and did not have me wanting to reach for wasabi. Didn't have to dip it in soy sauce. Just ate it. Finally, a huge bowl of shrimp and sea bass green curry came to the table and it was so much fish in it that a hungry guy like could me split it with my friend and we both had well enough to spill over our mounds of rice. The dish was kissed with lemongrass, peppers and pineapple in the  most sensual way. i wasn't supposed to be having these erotic feelings while on the clock!  I'm usually NOT a fan of green curry (prefer red or yellow) but if I can find it the way Sunda offers it, it can become my favorite. We argued about dessert and finally decided to pick both the cookie bites sampler and the thai creme anglais choc molten cake with rice crispies. We made our way through the intensely-flavored cookies bites and found that the tangerine bar (will make u say screw lemon!), molasses and brown sugar tasting cookie and the brittle were awesome. The molten cake was saved for last and I swear to you I wondered if it was New Year's because this cake was so savory, it had a pleasant hint of black-eye peas in it!  I know that may seem gross to read or imagine, but this really works along with the chocolate and cream.  Never had anything like it! ------ UPDATE: We've since been back to Sunda a number of times for an early lunch and it hasn't disappointed.  Andrea has served us a couple of times and goes out of her way to make us feel comfortable.  We are definitely fans of their taro coconut bread pudding made from brioche. The LaVazza coffee is great after a nice glass of Trace Merlot.",0.9968,0.749,0.183,0.067,0.5104331726973236

But this is a review of Sunda. The first thing that struck me was how busy it was for Thursday night; they were packed!  Luckily the kickass front desk manager at the Westin called ahead and got them to seat me at the sushi bar.  The decor is pretty hip and the crowd seemed pretty hip, too. There was a lot of good people watching.   The service was a little bit on the slow side, but the food more than made up for it.  That, and the manager of the restaurant, Angie, brought me a very delicious whitefish treat just because she was glad to see a solo diner.  So, they get extra stars just for being friendly and generous.  Summary: go here, eat, have a nice time. You'll be glad you did.  If you end up drinking too much here just go get a room at the Westin because they are cool, too.",0.9919,0.775,0.211,0.014,0.6783333333333333
2011-02-26,5.0,"Yum! 1: It was nice to see all the waiters/waitresses/hosts/etc not all Asian. Not that that is bad, but I feel like Sunda wasn't trying to hire only Asians to make you feel like you are having an ""Asian"" dining experience. The service was impeccable - the right people were chosen for the job regardless of how they looked. Plus they all had a nice snazzy uniform to make the team seem unified being that all of them didn't have black hair or slanted eyes. 2: The drinks were awesome. Pear sake with the cinnamon rim a keeper. A few fine sakes and we were smitten. A full sake list from light & crisp, smooth & round, rich & bold, and nigori cloudy make drinking sake as elegant as fine wine. Besides, good sake pairs best with this menu anyways. Drink up while sake doesn't have the sulfates wine or booze does that leaves you the hangover! 3: Food was amazing. One surely to please as it did for us was the ""rock shrimp tempura with creamy aioli honey"" - wowser. Then the lobster and wagyu (kobe beef) roll: creamy lobster, scallions, jalapeño, waygyu sashimi, truffle-foie gras aioli. My tongue was impressed, my stomach happy, my curiosity wanted to try everything else of carefully crafted culinary genius on this menu.  4: The ambiance was beautiful. Something to be seen with your own 2 eyes to take in right. We stayed for a couple of hours for drinks and dinner; being that we were so comfortable, with the place having good energy, perfect lighting, not being rushed by service we made a whole night of the place and could have easily stayed longer at that!

2011-02-23,3.0,"Working across the street from where Sunda sits, at Illinois between Clark and LaSalle, my friends and I watched with anticipation as it was being constructed a couple of years ago. Before its heavy blue doors ever opened, we got ahold of the menu online and circulated it amongst ourselves, delighting over the promised delectables. In a gesture that I now know to be characteristic of this establishment, Sunda's owners ventured across the street and handed over a stack of $25 gift certificates to the security guard at our building, inviting our entire staff (100+ full-time) to dine in its plush new digs.  And yet, I never got around to eating there until a couple weeks ago, for lunch.  I have to say, I was just a tad disappointed. I blame all the hype for my high expectations. Sunda is a beautiful place where lots of beautiful people go to be seen. And if that's your thing--well, you'll love it. But me, I'm all about the food, and to a somewhat lesser extent, the value. Unfortunately, these didn't get winning points in my book.  I ordered the Pancit Canton, a traditional Filipino noodle dish. I LOVE noodles. But while I expected these to be delicious--especially since my friend and fellow diner, a Filipina foodie who eats dinner for breakfast, is a huge fan of Pancit--they were just OK. The best thing about the dish was the crispy pork, which I picked through my noodles to get to. And my friend's Ramen Lover was bland.  I would still give it another try, when I've got another $30 to blow on lunch. The service was fine, but not remarkable, and I found meter-parking in the middle of the lunch-hour rush.

Granted I went on industry night with a friend in the industry, and thus my first experience involved everything being half off, but I've seen the prices and I'm willing to go back. It was just SO good.  Appetizer highlight - crispy Brussels sprouts salad. WOW. We also had the crab cake crusted tuna, which was actually my least favorite, since it had some steep competition. My friend had the stuffed avocado which I didn't try, but would absolutely order next time.  For roles I split the Tale of Two Tuna's and the Number Nine with a friend. Both fabulous. Seriously, I have never had fresher, creamier tuna than in that first role. And the number nine is an unagi roll with great flavor.

He says and does the right things when he does say and do something...until you find out that one thing that's wrong with him.  It PAINS me not to give this place 5 stars, because the food....was phenomenal. You HAVE to try the Lemongrass Beef Lollipops. NY Strip Steak on a stick?! I mean COME ON. It's so tender and juicy and the chili glaze they smother it with is absolutely to DIE for. And then there's the Pancit Canton- a filipino dish that has been Americanized the right way with losing a hint of Asian- if that makes any sense. It really is pretty delicious and you definitely get the BANG for your BUCK with the amount they give you. The Firecracker (specialty sushi) was also very good (tempura spicy tuna, cream cheese, jalapeno, water chestnuts, unagi sauce, spicy mayo, tempura crumbs)- but I can't say it was AMAZING.  What hurt was the service. From the moment we walked in WE had to be the ones to go up to the hostess and ask to be directed. THIS IS YOUR HOUSE....YOU TELL ME WHERE TO GO was my initial reaction. Our party wasn't complete so she had us wait, but that's all she said. She didn't direct us to the lounge where we can order drinks or offer a menu that we can take a look at. She just said ""Oh, you have to wait."" And then there was our waitress, who gave us nothing but attitude. We assumed that because we weren't super tall and wearing business suits she treated us differently, because she definitely treated the table next to us with a whole lot of pzazz. It was also VERY LOUD in the restaurant and hard to hear even the person across the table which is weird - something ought to be fixed here!    But yes, reserve online via Yelp/Open Table...it was nice because I had mentioned it was my birthday and we definitely got a free dessert out of it at the end of the night! :) Very convenient and they email and call you to remind you.

The bussing team did not pay attention to when diners had finished earlier courses so that main dishes arrived when there was no room at the table for the plates.  They just got jammed in front of us.

You cannot walk into this place in a hoodie and jeans, or even jeans without feeling completely out of place, it is REALLY nice. The atmosphere is pretty dressy.  Overall, we ordered the chop chop chicken salad which REALLY let me down, it was so incredibly dry; i did enjoy the subtle taste of the jalapeno but the chicken tasted bland/dirt like and the whole salad was just.. dry.  We also ordered the corn fritters which were pretty good. We ordered the scorpion roll which my date loved but I wasn't too particularly thrilled about, first of all it consisted of 5 pieces (2 of those were end pieces with the tail sticking out)..I mean it just seemed like such a small amount of sushi for the amount we paid; maybe I'm spoiled with my cheap and delicious suburban sushi joints. I got the blushing geisha and it was pretty strong (good thing) and had a good gingery kick. Also got miso soup, which was delicious as usual - but how can you really mess that up? The best part of the entire meal was the dessert. We got the ""ridiculous"" which is basically tempura fried vanilla ice cream and carrot cake, it was so delicious, I felt like I was consuming opiates!

Once seated, we had to wait a bit longer for anyone to take our drink orders. Our server, while friendly, seemed to be all over the place.

She blamed it on the large party seated next to us, but looking around, there seemed to be plenty of large parties seated everywhere.

It's got great energy and the wait staff is fantastic.  I'll go with the food and say that I think its some of the best Asian fusion I've had. Let me just say the menu is expansive and our waiter helped us through the maze of choices.  We ended up going with a bunch of small dishes to try many items. Tops on our choices were the specialty cut rolls, which is basically sushi. Thumbs up to the firecracker - spicy tempura tuna, with creme cheese, jalapeno, water chestnuts, etc. Just great. There was also one with a funny name - something like pigs with hidden lobster - just think bacon paired with lobster and well, it's awesome.  We also did Sunda's signature rice pan fried sushi - shrimp tempura. I have to say, it sounds cool but it really just amounts to a small square of rice, browned in a pan with a glob of what looked and tasted like guacamole.  My wife's cosmo martini was a good as it looked but ran about $15. So here's where they lose a star. I know I'm gonna pay a lot. Got it. But our bill for four drinks, and four sushi type dishes came to about $120. Is that bad? No. But as much as I loved the creative dishes, and the service and atmosphere, I'd just have to say it was a bit overpriced. Did it kill the evening. Not by a long shot.

Don't get me wrong; the restaurant is gorgeous inside.... decor is unbelievably well done and they whole place is quite the trendy scene. Our meal was really the ""just ok"" part.  It's a bit perplexing to me that Sunda encourages a ""shared plates"" style of dining. Most of their main dishes do not lend themselves to a tapas type meal. Obviously, the ""appetizer"" type plates and the sushi rolls are great for sharing (duh); however, the main dishes and choices from the grill are plated as an entree for one person.  Starting with drinks.... definitely one of the better Saketinis in town. Muddled with cucumber and was unbelievably smooth. Yum. 1 more, please. My friend had their espresso martini and loved it; I loathe espresso martinis so I didn't sample.  A fun drink list overall.  We ordered the lemongrass beef lollipops, the duck baos, the atlantic salmon ""bundles"", and the chilean sea bass with curried cauliflower puree......  Lemongrass Beef Lollipops - by far the highlight of the meal. Almost ordered another plate of them. These are the only thing I'd specifically go back to Sunda for, they are that good. Seasoned so well they don't even need the dipping sauce that is served alongside. Duck Baos - They are good, but I also love Baos. I wouldn't order this again; I can get the exact same thing at Wow Bao.  Atlantic Salmon Bundles - Meh. Bland. The salmon itself was fresh and tasty, but the crab salad in the middle of the bundles had zero flavor. Skip it. Chilean Sea Bass with curried cauliflower puree - Very good, but again, was absolutely not plated to be a shared dish. A big, beautiful piece of fish, pan roasted to perfection. The cauliflower side dish was a really nice accompaniment. The flavors were all there and the fish was quite perfectly cooked, it was honestly just hard to eat as a shared plate.  Server was fine; frankly the 7 other people that stopped by our table asking how the meal was were nicer and more courteous than our server.

We were seated right away and were encouraged to order family style by our server. I got the saketini to start off the dinner and it was delicious and refreshing. We ordered a ton of food and there were no complaints (and hardly any talking) from anyone, including the meat and potatoes guy who is afraid of sushi! My hands-down favorite was the crouching pig, hidden lobster roll. It's a clever name (win!) and it was DELICIOUS! I will definitely be returning to Sunda.

The menu is extensive and I loved the variety and everything looked liked it would be SO yummy... but I was a tad disappointed in some of the dishes, I will have to admit. Or maybe my expectations were just a little too high going in since I have heard many rave reviews. Overall, it was pretty good but not exceptional, and it was a bit pricey at the end of everything for what you get.  We ordered a bunch of plates to share, which was what was recommended... it is my favorite way to dine! Here is what was on our menu: Brussel Sprout salad - yummy, definitely different and tasty Rock Shrimp - delicious, the shrimp were a bit small but the flavor was great. Sliced Kobe Beef Carpacciao - It is kobe beef, how can you go wrong? So tender and fatty, the way I like it! Pork Belly - WAY too salty. It was almost hard to eat Seabass - The fish was good but not great and the side of cauliflower was just weird... too mushy Green Beans - a nice side dish Oxtail Potstickers - was nicely pan-fried and I liked the tender ox-tail, but I thought it was an odd filling for the dumpling. Maybe just not used to it.  Duck Hash - It was honestly just okay... and what was the hash? I thought there would be something with potatoes, and I also didn't taste a daikon cake. It was a good tasting of food for 5 people, and we left satisfied but not totally full. And it is a ""night out"" place since it is so trendy and $$.

Knowledgeable bar tenders, great servers and extensive recommendations for any food lover, sushi or non, and well versed chefs ready to wow you. The must list:  Oxtail pot stickers (so delicate, so perfectly crisped on the outside) Miso Soup with Crab...need I say more? Smoked Crab handroll (rolled in soy paper so as not to disturb the delicate taste of the massago and crab together blended so perfectly) Shaking Beef (you will tremble with ""excitement"" all over your body)  Shrimp tempura  and...its not on the menu but maybe if you ask really nice you might just entice Chef Jesse to make a stuffed avocado...perfectly sliced avocado, pieced back together into a sphere and filled with spicy tuna mixture on a bed of salsa and greens..almost too pretty to eat, almost. As cliche as it is to serve a Mai-Thai in a tiki glass...go for it, that little guy will sneak up on you faster than you can set the glass back down. The peared sake leaves ginger drinks no disservice either, the notes of sugar cane and ginger dance down your throat as if they were naturally meant to be there.  I'd give it five stars, if the portions were just a bit bigger, but the family style service (which is not always emphasized, and at $20/entree might be a stretch) points towards ordering a few extra dishes to share, overall its a four-star classic in my book. Stop by for ""Sunda Hour"" daily $8 signature cocktails and specially priced appetizers and rolls, definitely worth spoiling dinner over!

The waiter was clueless as to what items had MSG and what didn't and had to go back a number of times to the kitchen to find out if each item I asked about had it or not.  This held us up.  And, then when I finally placed my order, he got it wrong!   I do not recommend this place and would never go back to it!  There are too many awesome restaurants in this City to eat at with much better service and better quality food!",-0.8892,0.802,0.075,0.123,0.63

Our waiter was awesome, very sweet and knowledgeable, also fast.  We also got a free shot of sake when they found out one of our party was leaving for Australia. -Excellent food. I really loved everything we tried, but The caterpillar roll and oxtail potstickers were the faves. -Granted, I was with 5 other people to split the bill, but I thought the prices were pretty reasonable.  $60 each, with a really good tip.  We had plenty to eat and 2 bottles of wine.  Maybe I have been living in the city too long, but I found this  reasonable for a special occasion Now, the not so good -The noise. It was so loud I was literally yelling at my companions.  It was so loud, I couldn't here the waiter form across the table. -The hostesses. I don't like it when I receive eyerolls when asking a legitimate question.    One of my party was 5 minutes late.  They refused to seat us until she arrived.  When she did arrive, I was told we would be seated immediately.  20 minutes later, we had not been seated.  When this was questioned, they were very short and somewhat rude.

I'm not going to lie, this place is amazing (her favorite), but it's just tough to justify the money spent, so I'm going to be overly critical. Pros (non-food): -Hostess pulled the table out for my girlfriend. -Waiter was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. Very detailed and thorough). -Decor, very romantic. Modern and chic. -Food served very fast. -Food packed up very fast. Cons (non-food): -We were seated very close to 2 other couples so we were able to hear each others' conversation. -Dessert menu took 10 minutes to get to us after we asked for it. -Waiter would look around when talking to us (everything seemed scripted, not natural or sincere). Food ordered: Escolar, the great white tuna = Very good, but at $4.50 a bite probably not worth it. Spicy tail of the two tunas = I'm a sucker for yellowtail. Had a nice kick to it. Rock shrimp tempura = Great flavor. However, it gets old and we both felt like we needed some white rice to tone it down. It gets a bit old after 5 pieces so we took the rest of it home. Roasted duck hash = Recommended. Love the egg on top. The sauce is very tasty. Duck very tender. Best tofu; my mom would love this dish. Thai fried chicken = Thumbs down. At $21, you can buy a huge bucket at KFC or Popeye's with similar tasting quality without the sweet and sour sauce and the fish sauce on the side. Dry braised string beans = Thumbs down. Nothing special about this dish. The waiter made it seem like this dish came with the Thai fried chicken and that we had a choice between this and something else. $8 down the drain. Dessert: We ordered the ""Ridiculous"" and it was very good. Very heavy though so we couldn't finish it. Order this when you have at least 4 people in your party. If you barely have room left, try the avocado mousse because it's light and awesome. Drinks: Peared Sake = Decent. Nice touch with the cinnamon or brown sugar on the rim. Divine Lychee = So good, my girlfriend even drank half of it (and she doesn't drink). However, alcohol content seems weak. Chocolate Sensation = I need to learn how to make this chocolate martini at home. So good (alone). Definitely recommended if you like chocolate.

I met him roughly a year ago when I was a soldier in the military and he was visiting our armory in Elgin, IL. Nevertheless, surprisingly he remembered me as we chatted for a moment; fun times. Makes sense that Sunda was recently named the #6 celebrity hot-spot. :-) Okay, enough with my tangent...  A few moments after being seated, the assistant GM - Kevin - came over and introduced himself and asked how our evening was going, among other things; very personable and accommodating; definitely a effort that should be modeled in other downtown restaurants.  In terms of dinner, I can sometimes be indecisive when ordering appetizers and an entrée, but our server - Ben - was very patient, knowledgable, and helpful with making great suggestions from their menu; which helps. Our food arrived within a reasonable amount of time and was very well prepared; not to mention very appetizing. Oh, and BTW, the presentation was an absolute plus.  To conclude, we had a really great time while dining at Sunda and will definitely return in the near near future with other friends.

2010-12-06,5.0,"On a summer Friday night, I met up with a friend at Sunda New Asian at 110 W. Illinois on the corner of Lasalle downtown. I was expecting fabulousness after reading about the restaurant on Perez Hilton (Jeremy Piven apparently dropped his phone into the toilet there and made a waiter fish it out!) Well I decided that if it was good enough for Jeremy, then it was good enough for me! The restaurant did not disappoint AT ALL. Luckily, my friend went to the restaurant while I was driving into the city so, by the time I arrived and gave my car to the valet, our table was ready (a 30-40 minute wait because we failed to make reservations in time). The crowd was very well-dressed, young, and fun. Our waiter came over to us right away and was very open and attentive. He told us about the specials for the evening and I was sold right away on the lobster roll with avocado, mango, and jalapeno inside with bacon and tempura on the top. Oh. My. God. It was the best sushi I've ever had. My friend bought the spicy tuna roll and it was equally delicious. We also shared an appetizer of oxtail pot stickers that were meaty and flavorful. The other highlights (let's face it...what was NOT a highlight???) were the drinks and dessert. They had a beautiful list of cocktails from which I ordered the Rising Sun (Ty Ku Soju, Macadamia Nut Liqueur, Pineapple juice, Black Cherry Brandy) and the Blushing Geisha (Tequila, Pama, Domain de Canton, Guava Juice, Calamansi Soda). My friend ordered the Go Go Berry (strawberries with Absolut Mango, St. Germain, Triple Sec, and Mango Juice). They were all superb. We also chose the Mochi ice cream dessert. It came with the following flavors of mochi (ice cream wrapped in rice paste): green tea, mango, vanilla, red bean, and strawberry. The green tea ice cream was the best green tea flavored food I've ever tasted. The flavors were clean and bright and just plain delicious. The prices at Sunda are not cheap. But the quality of the service and the food were well worth what we paid and I would definitely go there again! Maybe next time, I'll see some celebrities! I think I'll steer clear of Jeremy Piven, though. I wouldn't want him to ask me to fish his cell phone out of the toilet.

2010-11-23,4.0,"4th meeting of the Co-worker Birthday Lunch Group (aka my birthday lunch).  I wanted to try Sunda for some time and was excited that it was my turn to pick the place. I love these lunches because it's a nice opportunity for some girl talk and a little indulgence. I'm lobbying for the celebration of half birthdays, 6 lunches a year doesn't seem like enough. We started with the rock shrimp tempura and spicy tuna signature sushi. The sushi was fantastic, served like pieces of nigiri; the tuna was minced and served over the glazed rice. There was a nice slow heat to dish and the glaze created a nice, crunchy texture. Sadly, the rock shrimp let me down. The shrimp, served with glazed walnuts and a honey aioli, was too sweet for my liking; I think I would have enjoyed it if there was some spice or savory to offset the sweetness. For my meal, I waffled between the Sunda Set Combo and seared ahi banh mi. I went with the banh mi and had a bit of buyer's remorse watching one co-worker enjoy her combo. My sandwich was fine; the fish was fresh and perfectly seared and the bread was nice and crunchy. The problem was that I didn't glean any flavor from the pickled veggies and spice butter also on my sandwich. I was expecting some complexity of flavors, but was disappointed. The dressing on the accompanying salad was also extremely bland. Like I said my meal was fine, but something I'd make tracks to Sunda for. The combo is quite the steal, for $18 my co-worker got a choice of side salad or miso soup, 3 pieces of sushi, and a choice of 7 hot entrees with rice. There was a ton of food, which all looked quite amazing. The rest of the group got sushi and starters and seemed quite happy with their choice. The space is beautiful, very sleek and modern, but service during our meal while friendly was a bit off. There was a long lag between ordering our starters and our lunch and at lags during other parts of our meal too. It's definitely not an in and out lunch place (or a place you should go without a reservation). We were never offered dessert before the check was dropped, which was disappointing as it's something we usually enjoy indulging in.  Overall, I'd give this place 3.5 stars. It didn't live up to the anticipation I had created, but I'm rounding up because I'd definitely come back and give it another crack.",0.9907,0.779,0.159,0.062,0.6148391812865497
2010-11-22,3.0,"Sunda is definitely a place to be and be seen - as evidenced by the crowd of fiftysomething men with their twentysomething paramours.  We had a reservation but had to wait 30-40 minutes anyway, which is annoying.  I know that crowds can be unpredictable, but I'm old and prefer to eat before 9 pm on weekdays. Once we were seated I became aware of how incredibly loud this place is - which was sad since I came with a group of friends and was really looking forward to some good conversation.  Again, this just might be me being grumpy and old.  Our waiter suggested splitting dishes but we had already been looking at the menu for a but and thus were settled on what we all wanted respectively... so we did some bite-swapping but no real sharing. The good: The pork bao sandwiches, which we split as an appetizer, were really tasty.  I also enjoyed my spicy tuna roll, which was meaty and legitimately spicy - a pleasant surprise.  I also had a bite of the corn fritters, which were tasty but basically just fried corn.  Boyfriend's pork belly was really tasty and a giant portion, which was cool, except that it wasn't served with rice or anything so it was way too rich. The bad: the Number 9 roll was super boring and flavorless.  I was really disappointed. Overall, it was a decent experience and the food was pretty tasty, but it's just not really my scene.  I'm more of a Chinese-takeout-Gossip-Girl-reruns kind of gal, I guess.",0.9788,0.754,0.167,0.079,0.5822222222222222
2010-11-22,4.0,"Once again I waited too late to make a dinner reservation for my husband's birthday, so every place we wanted to go was already booked.  A friend suggested Sunda and I was a little apprehensive because while my husband like sushi, I knew that wasn't what he had in mind.  I took a look at the menu online, though, and much to my surprise found that Sunda is much more than just sushi.  Tons of delicious-sounding options.  Of course, they were fully-booked, too...  However, the woman on the phone said that she could seat us in the lounge and that we could still order off of the full menu.  Done! In hindsight, I'm actually really happy that we were seated in the lounge versus the main restaurant.  It's communal-seating which I don't care for, and it's incredibly loud and bustling.  Great, if that's your cup of tea.  But I much prefer the scene/vibe of the lounge.  Yes, the tables and chairs are lower to the ground and the tables are much smaller than a dinner table overall.  But our server gave us this little mini table to set on the sofa so we could put excess glasses or whatever there and leave room for the food on the table--brilliant.   All of the food and drinks we ordered were really fantastic.  I won't go into detail but the few things that I found to be really noteworthy were the lychee martini, lemongrass beef lollipops and the pork belly.  BBQ pork was also pretty good.  The only disappointment was dessert.  I don't know why we even bothered because quite frankly it just wasn't very good.  We ordered the molten chocolate cake but I think they should call it something else because it isn't molten chocolate cake.  It wasn't warm and no chocolate oozed out as you'd expect.  I had one bite and let my husband and our friend devour the rest. I'm a stickler for good service so I must note that it was very very good.  The timing between dishes was spot-on, too.  We'll definitely go back, but we'll stick with the same time of this past reservation--around 8 p.m.  The later it got, the crazier/more chaotic it got and it was like breaking through a mob scene trying to leave.",0.9829,0.832,0.119,0.048,0.4917261904761904

2010-11-21,4.0,"Well now I've been back for dinner and I was not disappointed. I went with a group of four for a friend's birthday. We couldn't get a reservation in the main dining room so we sat in the lounge. It was perfect and slightly quieter than the rest of the restaurant which was right up our alley. We had a small table with two lounge chairs on the ends and a long bench along the back where us ladies sat. Our server gave us a small table to place on the bench to hold our drinks which would come in really handy when our food came. We decided to share everything, thankfully, because everything was delicious.  We started off with roasted duck bao buns, which are adorably served like sandwiches for easy eating. Then we had indo corn fritters and the lemongrass beef lollipops. The corn fritters were fried but not greasy, and absolutely delicious.  We split sushi and a couple of main dishes for dinner. The Golden Child, Firecracker, and the Lobster Wagyu, and Sunda's Yellowtail Jalapeno which was served like sushi but just yellow tail wrapped around fillings with a jalapeno on top. They were all fresh and unique. We probably could have stopped there, but we also felt porky that night. We got the Adobo Pork Belly which I think we can all agree was the superstar of the night, and the Charsiu Barbeque Pork which made a valiant effort to keep up. We were all pleased with each dish. The Pork Belly was two huge pieces and would be a great solo main if you're starving and really love pork. However, I highly recommend going with a group of close friends so that you can try several different dishes. Because we were there for a birthday, we got the molten chocolate cake with a candle for dessert. It was okay, but not molten.  I was expecting hot, runny chocolate oozing out of the cake with every bite. It was just chocolate cake though.",0.9945,0.813,0.17,0.017,0.5685714285714286
2010-11-19,1.0,"About a month ago, me and 10 of my girls had dinner here to celebrate a birthday. We had a great time while there, but soon after reality set in for half of us: FOOD POISONING. We all work at a busy Gold Coast salon, and 2 of us (one was the birthday girl) had to cancel their fully booked saturdays, one had a flight sat pm and had to change her seat so she was closer to the bathroom, and the rest of us were just left feeling miserable and clinging to the toilet.  We all understand that is a risk taken when going to eat raw fish, but the reason im writing this review is because we have been treated so horribly by the management staff since the incident. We had to call repeatly to the GM, who seemed annoyed that we were bothering him, when we could actually get him on the phone. Some of us received $50 gift certificates in ""compensation"", which came along with use restrictions: only good sun-thurs, and only 1 per table. This is unacceptable for a group who spent $900, that IF we ever go back we cant use the ""gift"" certificates together. Anyone in the restaurant business knows that $50 in a gift card only really costs the restaurant about $15 in food. And the girls who had to cancel their clients easily lost about $500 each. This should be horribly embarrassing for Sunda, Rockit Ranch Productions, and i think Billy Dec would be horrified to know that his customers, who got violently ill, were treated like this. A restaurant of this caliber should know the importance of customer service, especially with a group of busy, chatty, Gold Coast haridressers.",-0.9901,0.739,0.082,0.179,0.5732517482517483
2010-11-17,5.0,"I dined the other night with some friends at Sunda, and we decided that we should share our food to be able to try as much as possible. We started with the Lemongrass Beef Lollipops (per other Yelp reviewers suggestions) and the Oxtail pot stickers (suggested by our waitress). The Beef Lollipops were exquisite. The way the beef was wrapped around the handles (of onion, I think) were very attractive. Our waitress warned us that the pepper that came on the handle was a very good, but very spicy pepper. I only tasted a bit, but really enjoyed the flavor of the pepper of the beef, along with the spicy chili glaze. The glaze was so good, that one of my dining companions actually ate a spoonful by itself after the beef was gone! The Oxtail Potsickers were great, very delicate and tasty. They were presented with a drizzle of white wasabi cream on top, which added the perfect contrast to the delicate beef. On to the main course. I tasted only one other person's dish, which was the Spicy ""Tail of Two Tunas"". It was very tasty with one tuna being in the roll draped with the second tuna. I only ate one piece, but yum! I ordered the Malay Style Chilean Seabass. All I can say is WOW! The fish itself was crusted with a tasty coriander, lemongrass and miso topping, which provide a perfect crunch to the ""like butter"" fish itself. The fish just melted in your mouth, and was very ""buttery"" tasting (not like butter, but the texture). It was perfect and everyone else at my table tasted it and we all agreed that I had the best dish of all of us. It came with a side of Curried Cauliflower Puree, which was, as it says, cauliflower, that has been pureed and seasoned with a mild curry (powder? sauce?), and garnished with some grape tomatoes and herbs. Dessert: I don't remember what it was called, but we had the Avocado Mousse dessert that comes in a martini glass with lychee and raspberry at the bottom of the glass. Taking a spoonful of all of the flavors together, I was in heaven. I would come back simply for dessert alone, it was that good. The service: I want to take a moment and say that we had excellent service while we dined, always attentive, not intrusive, and a joy to work with. Overall - I will definitely go back, but the prices make this, for me, a really nice ""once in a while"" dinner out.",0.9979,0.794,0.189,0.017,0.5855119047619048

2010-11-08,4.0,"Sunda. What can I say, this was my third time eating there and I am finally ready to write a review. I don't understand the hype. The first time I ate there was for my brother's graduation and the Chilean Sea Bass was defiantly memorable. I think Sunda turned me on to Chilean Sea Bass for the first time (learning it was near endangered turned me off...) also; you can never go wrong with the sushi! However, the Filipino food there is definitely an acquired taste. But Filipino food tends to be that way... I applaud the effort to make higher end Filipino food, but honestly it's a hit or miss. I've gone there with two different dates and both dates were not so happy with the Crispy Pata and a little more tolerant of the Pancit. But of course, the Loompya is always a hit - maybe it's an American thing. My experience with Sunda is more tolerant and mildly amused, than anything else. The food is good, esp. if you're ordering sushi and fish, but the meat/main dishes have left me wanting. The drinks are pricy and the ambiance definitely hip and young. It's a nice place that seems to draw in a very fresh young crowd, and on the plus it's probably the only Filipino restaurant I semi like.

2010-11-08,4.0,"3.5 stars, rounded up to 4. I was debating on just giving this place three stars, but I decided on four because it does have some pretty awesome dishes.  Came here for a Sunday night dinner, and the food was either hit or miss.   Pork belly buns were not great.  I've probably been spoiled by the great pork belly buns I've had at Momofuku in New York, but the buns here were a bit soggy and too salty.  The management removed this dish from our bill, which was a nice gesture - still, these can be worked on.  They have potential. The sushi here was good - had tuna, sea urchin, and octopus.  About $14-15 for 4 sashimi pieces (so $45 for all three/ 12 pieces), so a bit on the pricier side, but the sushi was very fresh and of good quality.  Good stuff. The miso bronzed black cod was decent - my main complaint about this dish was it was a bit too sweet.  I read the chef's bio and saw that he had been the opening chef at Koi in Los Angeles - Koi in LA basically does this exact same dish, but just not as sweet.  The fish was cooked perfectly though, but the devil is in the details.  Less sugar, please. The star of the night though (and probably why this review does get 4 stars) - the Atlantic salmon sashimi ""bundles"".  These were creamy blue crab wrapped in salmon - DELICIOUS.  I would go back again just for this dish - it was truly awesome.  Well balanced, not fish, and really smooth.  $15 for 5 pieces (a bit small, but worth it).   Service was fine.  No complaints.  Maybe a bit slow in between the sushi and main courses, but wasn't too bad.  Tried one of the cocktails here, some berry one, which was good.",0.9949,0.718,0.211,0.071,0.5569559228650137

Service was spotty - they promptly seated my girlfriend and I at one of their communal tables, which is what I would expect from this trying-to-be-trendy atmosphere - though I had to wait a very long time for my second glass of wine when I clearly wanted to drink it along with my meal, not as a digestive.

It was one big large room, music playing, voices bouncing and echoing off the walls... but towards the end of the night, it wasn't so bad anymore. Food - it took a while for the food to come out and it came out sporadically, our side dish came out before the entree ... weird huh?  Pros: Since it took us about 30 minutes to sit down since we had 10 in our reservation and the table that we were waiting for was taking forever to leave, they compensated us by giving us appetizers on the house. How awesome is that?? Pass the Rock Shrimp Tempura please ... that is what they hooked us up with and the edamame. The rock shrimp could have been my entree alone, this dish was so good. I generally don't eat too much shrimp, but my god, I could eat this all day long.  I ordered the Cod ... it was like eating ice cream ... it just melts in your mouth. They cook their fish perfectly and it tasted amazing.  Since food took a while to come out, they gave us more rock shrimp and FREE desserts!! three kinds to be exact!! molten lava cake, thai ice cream puffs, and a custard/flan like dessert. SOOOO good!! The only way a restaurant can make up in bad service is by giving free food away, giving a future gift certificate for use, or by not charging for some items. Sunda went above and beyond in correcting their mistakes and it definitely makes you want to come back!! Of course only restaurants of this caliber are willing to fix their mistakes like that ... mediocre ones just apologize, but do they have repeat customers? I will definitely come back to Sunda.",0.9968,0.737,0.201,0.061,0.6042836792836794

The rolls tasted terrible!  The Firecracker roll was a pile of mush on the plate.  The ""manager"" came over and asked how everything was and I explained a bit about my disappointment.  In the middle of my explanation - and I was nice - she looked away.  She did not care.  Nothing was comped or not even a ""I'm sorry you are disappointed""  Nada.

He split the cost of the appetizer that he thought it would be for the table to our bill too. It was little so I did not argue but to be honest this is not our share and he did not even come around to ask what we wanted for the appetizer.

I didn't see any celebrities, and i really didn't think the crowd was all that interesting. Granted, my birthday fell on a Wednesday so there was probably a lot of people from the after work crowd instead of the clubbin' crowd on the weekends. First of all, i love that the menu is pretty much compiled of small plates. The hubster and I love that, because you can order a bunch of things and keep ordering until you're stuffed. The food and the portions were great, but the service was just okay. We told our server that our table was wobbly twice, and she never came to fix it. It was so wobbly that if my husband leaned forward the table would make a loud noise and my chopsticks would roll off my plate. The trek to the bathroom is pretty ridiculous after you've had a few pear sake-tinis (B-T-Dubs: AMAZING!). Also, not that a bathroom makes a restaurant, but it really wasn't that nice and kinda dirty.

I have to say, this place came close to getting a one after my husband and I had been there for 40 minutes without getting seated when we had an 8:00 reservation.  When they came up to tell us at 8:40 that we could sit at a communal table I just about died.  We finally were seated in the restaurant by 8:50....  Instead of making a scene, my husband and I were strategizing how we could make the restaurant lose money - our plan was to use our coupon, not order drinks, and yelp the crap out of how horrible this place was....  But all that disappeared when one of the owners ended up spoiling us for the rest of the night by throwing all kinds of free stuff our way and apologizing profusely- the chef even came out to offer us some free toro sashimi with sake expressing his apologies!  Needless to say, they more than made up for our wait! We ordered one sushi roll (Sunda Rainbow Roll), the DELICIOUS ahi tuna/pork dish, ""all of the above sashimi"", and the ""shaking beef"".   The fish is AMAZING there - so fresh, perfectly cut, and just overall the best sushi I have had in the city (way better than Japonais).  I cannot wait to go again.  Just about everything on the menu had me drooling, and I still cannot stop thinking about the ahi tuna/pork dish that I hogged from my husband.  It is a MUST if you go there.

We had selected out a cold dish and hot dish to try off the prix fixe, only to be informed that when we select the prix fixe for $33 a person, we actually get ALL five main dishes along with the side of rice and dessert!   Finding out that they had a sushi bar as well, we opted to try one of their other items along with the prix fixe menu: Alaskan Salmon Bundles (not prix fixe):  Fresh salmon wrapped around blue crab meat bundles... shame it's only five pieces, but it was innovative and delicious. Prix Fixe: South Eastern Chicken Chop Salad:  The peanut jalapeno dressing was made wonderfully... very low amount of heat, but just enough to let you know the jalapeno was there.  Chicken was tender, salad was fresh.  Yum. Spicy ""Tail of two Tunas"":  Rolled yellowfin spicy tuna draped with super white tuna on the outside, with a kick from jalapeno.  Again, not ridiculously spicy, but enough to awaken your taste buds.  This was excellent. Rock Shrimp Tempura:  A clever upscale take on the traditional honey walnut shrimp found at other Chinese restaurants.  The tempura crust seemed a bit thick, but the dish comes together very well. Miso Bronzed Black Cod:  Served over glazed, slightly crisped eggplants, this was the clear winner of the hot courses.  Fish was tender, moist, and flavorful.  Definite winner. Chicken breast of Tobonyaki:  The outside was very flavorful, but the meat itself was slightly dry and couldn't match the flavor of the outside.  Good dish, but can't keep up with the cod. Sunda Cookie Bites:  Eight different mini cookies, that my wife each had half a bite of each.  Fun, enjoyable, and all very different flavors!  The creativity of the cookies was wonderful, and the size was just right as the richness of each cookie can be enjoyed in a bite. The only dishes we were able to finish were the sushi, cod, and cookie bites, so I'll be enjoying some salad, chicken, and shrimp for lunch today... and the servers were kind enough to pack a new box of jasmine rice for us! Verdict:  Excellent food, great customer service, well worth checking out as it's one of the few places that I've tried that excels at pan asian upscale approach!  And a great value for your money if you're able to take advantage of the prix fixe menu during the Dine Around Chicago Gourmet Festival month!  Look forward to coming back here again!",0.9991,0.752,0.233,0.015,0.5694084724799012

I tried the beef lollipops, roasted duck baos and sticky rice rolls with shrimp tempura and avocado. The beef lollipops were really tasty and had great presentation. There isn't a ton of meat there, but it was really satisfying. The baos were pretty good but I don't think i would order them again. The presentation again was lovely but the duck wasn't very flavorful and actually tasted kind of dry. But the sticky rice rolls really saved this entire thing for me. The rice was beyond delicious and the avocado had a nice flavor but it wasn't very spicy (even with wasabi in it) and the avocado did overflavor the shrimp. Either way, I would still order it again. The one thing I will say though is that I dined her alone (reading a magazine) and the staff didn't seem to know what to do with me.

I loved the vinegar dipping sauce they had paired with it, yummy and you can't get garlic foie-gras gravy with it either back home!

I had the Strawberry Delight, an indulgence on my part and it was STRONG and TASTY. Loved it! My friends had gin martinis, cucumber martinis, mai tai's and all were excellent.  I also have to admit I like coming here because of the hope that I'll see a celeb with the owner, Billy Dec.

Yeah...I'm sticking with my original rating of a three star A-OK, but here's why: Decor as mentioned by almost everyone is a huge plus, except the bathroom is like two flights of stairs underground. Also, I never realized how loud it was in the restaurant. Food was MUCH better than the first time around. Adobo pork belly is the go-to entree. Among the best adobo and/or pork belly I've had in the city. I would have upped the rating to four stars if it weren't for... ...the service. Killed me again. Reservations on a Monday for 8 PM. We got seated at 8:30 PM. Whammy. Server was below mediocre. He rarely checked on us and did not fill our drinks or ask for refills once. Water was refilled once by his serving entourage, aka food runners. Not sure if I'll give Sunda another run. I think I've been fooled enough by it's looks. I will say, however, you might have a few celebrity sightings as this is a very trendy spot. Our party was seated next to Josh Duhamel and Fergie.",0.9178,0.846,0.11,0.045,0.5694444444444445

It was rather heavy for me since most of the apps are fried, but it still tasted good. I just can't take too much fried stuff. The only thing I didn't like was that salad thing that was also fried. Yeah, you read that right. Fried salad. Besides that, everything else was good. We ordered almost everything on the happy hour menu. The drinks are very reasonable and not watered down in the least.

2010-08-16,5.0,"We just got back from a bachelorette party in Chicago and chose Sunda for our dinner venue after it was suggested by a friend and it was great!  The food, service and ambiance was exactly what we were looking for.  We were seated right away  and our server was attentive and the food came out in succession at a good pace.  The manager came over with shots (with his head sushi chef, who my friends wouldn't stop staring at) and wished the bride to be congrats and continually made sure we were all set throughout our dinner.   As for food, I loved everything we ordered, but a few things stuck on my palette in particular:   Garlic noodles with blue crab - simple and they weren't cheap with the crab so there were good chunks in there Steamed Baos - delicious (that's all that needs to be said) Spicy Tuna with crispy rice and jalapenos - the crispy rice added an unexpected texture to the normal spicy tuna maki we're all used to and the jalapenos was the icing on the cake for those who really like spice Miso Cod - It wasn't too salty and the fish was cooked perfectly As for the sushi, the fish was fresh.  I usually gauge the quality based on the uni because that's my fav and it often has a funk to it if it's not fresh.  All the sushi/sashimi we ordered tasted great and was well presented...  For dessert, my fav was the mochi ice-cream and I hardly ever eat dessert!  Overall a great experience and definitely worth 5 stars!  And I give it a 6th start just cuz the manager is from Guam too! =)",0.9971,0.755,0.237,0.008,0.5413123582766439

Main Dish: I ordered the NY Steak Set Combo, one friend ordered the Kobe Tartare Sunda Signature Sushi and another ordered the Shrimp and Sea Bass Curry. The NY Steak dish had a Korean twist to it - the steak was topped with Kimchi which was good.  The negative was that the meat was a bit on the chewy side. The Kobe Tartare was not tartare, it actually was cooked. However, the Shrimp and Sea Bass Curry was good - it had taste similar to that of the Thai green curry dish. Drinks: We ordered a mango tea and a pomegranate tea - the mango was good, it had a sweetness to it; the pomegranate was a bit on the tart side with a taste similar to the POM juice they sell at the grocery stores.",0.9851,0.788,0.182,0.03,0.49074074074074076

First the good: The duck salad was phenomenal.  It an amazing balance of sweatness and texture with the fried dicon.  Probably the best salad I have ever had in my life.  The next dish we had was the pork belly, which was succulent and plentiful.  Finally, for dessert I had the taro bread pudding, which was soft and complex as the taro taste didnt come through until the end of the bite....but pervaded the dessert.  All 3 of these dishes were 5 stars. Now the bad...and its really really bad.  We had the kobe beef  tar tare which looked unappetizing.  I;ve never had dog food before but I imagine thats how it would taste.  The garlic noodles were overcooked and they used the wrong noodles (your not supposed to use flat noodles for this dish).  It was also warm, when it should be served cold.  Finally, we had a tuna tar tar served on cracker/wonton.  It wasnt that bad but nothing special. This place has so much potential.  If they fixed a few things it could easily be a 4 or 5 star restaurant.",-0.4849,0.784,0.104,0.112,0.5805837173579109

We finally came again.  And I'm glad we did. Last minute reservations are impossible, but luckily I know someone on the darkside that scored us reservations.  I like the atmosphere: filled with a lot of eye candy, but still manages to keep a very chill, laid back tone.  Our waitress was awesome, super friendly and very helpful with recommendations.  The menu is extensive and has lots to choose from.  I saw they had Blue Fin tuna, so i HAD to try it.  Blue fin is an endangered species, so it's a rare find in restaurants.  It's endangered for good reason: it's frickin delicious.  I'm all for saving animals and whatnot, but I have absolutely zero qualms about that piece of Blue Fin sashimi sitting happily in my tummy.  Everything we ordered was awesome as well.  The signature makis are unique and worth trying.  And the rock shrimp tempura was definitely a big hit.  The chocolate molten cake was so good my friends and I had to order a second round. Right now I'm in my room, sick with a cold.  I'm pretty sure the only thing that would make me better right now is some Blue Fin tuna.  Can somebody please pick me up and take me to Sunda, like now?

I make those at home and I rarely see these in restaurants so my experience was already starting off well. I decided to go the Filipino food route for my lunch choices and ordered the pork and shrimp lumpia and then the Chicken and Pork Adobo.  The lumpia was rolled ""shanghai"" style so it was thin and meaty. Great flavor to these and a good portion for sharing. My meal came with a salad with a light vinagrette and also 3 pieces of sushi (spicy tuna or cali roll.) I choose the spice tuna and it was really good - they spice the tuna instead of using spicy mayo. The adobo was different from what I am used to but it was still fabulous. The sauce wasn't as vinegary as I like, but it still had great garlic and soy flavors. I dug the grilled onions in the dish (also not what I am used to) - they were cooked to the point of perfect carmelization. The pork and chicken were seasoned well and not overcooked/dry.

I had a rainbow roll and it was good - what I would have expected based on other sushi places.  The service leaves something to be desired.

Either way, the food was amazing as always. As a semi-pro Bloody Mary aficionado, the best bloody mary used to belong to Joe's on Weed (pepperoni, jack pepper cheese and basically a side salad of veggies in your cup) and a touch of Guinness at the bottom really made the difference. The torch has been passed to Sunda though. Not even factoring in the literal buffet of exotic ingredients (red chili peppers, lemon grass, jicama, unagi, shrimp, seaweed, tofu, among the other dozen other ingredients I had to refer to the chart to figure out), the drink itself was unlike any bloody I've ever had. It was refreshing, flavorful and had such a unique flavor. The waitress insisted it was because of their house made mix, but I think substituting the vodka for Sochu (a Japanese liquor) was the real difference maker. Either way its a must try.

I believe we had to wait almost 30 mins for the RESERVED table. But they bought us a round of drinks from the bar, so I thought that was particularly nice of them. After that, we got seated at our table almost immediately. Our waiter was very charming and made some very helpful recommendations. I've had their sushi and was not impressed and was only interested in their non-sushi dishes.  We ordered the honey walnut rock shrimp tempura. It was basically the honey walnut shrimp that you get from a chinese restaurant but about 3 times better. We ordered something called the Devil's Basket which was 2 soft shell crabs cut in 4 pieces sitting in a bed of red hot dried chilis. Very delicious. The waiter pointed us in the direction of the crispy rice sushi and helped us pick the Kobe beef one. It was probably the most tender kobe beef I've ever had. The meat literally just broke apart in my mouth, and in a good way. For entrees we had the roast duck breast which was sitting in buttery mashed potatoes and this amazing sauce. Their side of cauliflower was fantastic. Best freaking cauliflower I've ever had in my life. Next entree was the Shaking beef, meaning Bo Luc Lac for those familiar with vietnamese fare. It was a delicious rendition of it although the meat was a bit on the chewy side. The side of string beans was also amazingly delicious. They put walnuts and chinese sausage in with it and the flavors were so well-matched. We finished off our meal with the bite sized cookies and the ridiculous, a big deep fried tempura ice cream ball covered in way too much caramel sauce. It was all good but not amazing.

I will go back, probably with my girlfriends on a Friday or Saturday night before we hit the town.",0.9201,0.864,0.136,0.0,0.5671794871794872
2010-07-07,4.0,"I've been to the restaurant twice and I put this restaurant to be on the same level as Japonais. Both are trendy, asian fusion, good food, and expensive. You don't come here if you are looking for a budget dinner, or to find prices that are ""reasonable"". This is a splurge and indulge type of place. The portions vary in the entrees and like all restaurants, I'm sure some dishes will be hit and miss. Though, I haven't hit a miss yet. My favorites are the longrib, baked seafood dynamite sushi roll, and pork belly. I haven't had the sashimi here yet, so I can't say if they are fresh or not. The restaurant's decor seems fancy, but you don't feel forced to dress up. I've come here twice dressed casually for dinner and never felt out of place. Instead of bread, they serve a small salad on the house. I feel like there's so much on the menu that its best to eat family style so you can sample everything. I would say if you are a carnivore, like my bf, this is an awesome restaurant since most dishes are just all meat on the plate. I can't wait to go back!",0.9837,0.83,0.158,0.012,0.4862847222222223

After hearing many people/magazines talk about this restaurant I was expecting the typical hot spot, crowded, expensive and food that was soo. Sunda was just the opposite. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. Each dish that was ordered had great flavor and a great menu of drinks to go along with it. Because it was my friends birthday they gave us a free appetizer and dessert. They definitely know how to treat their customers well.

2010-07-06,3.0,"My friend and I both work on Kinzie street just a few blocks away from each other. One day we decided to go to lunch and decided to hit up a nice spot that we wouldn't normally go to instead of the usual Singha or Potbelly. There are a lot of nice restaurants in River North that we never go to because 1) it's River North and no one hangs out there on purpose, at least not any of our normal friends, 2) it's a crazy stupid douchey scene at night, 3) the restaurants and clubs get really pricey at night. We decided to go to Sunda. The interior of Sunda is beautiful. It looks modern, but at the same time there are a ton of antique-looking Asian pieces that give it an old-world look. Right away we were served some chips. They were kind of like the consistency of shrimp chips, but thankfully didn't have that shrimpy taste that I'm not crazy about. Light and airy, kind of styrofoamy, like they're supposed to be. I don't know why they were pastel colors, but whatever. To drink, my friend got the mango tea and I got the mango soda. They were tasty and presented in a cool way, but $8 a glass? For tea and soda? Our waiter was really friendly and nice and helped us pick out the right amount of food. He also gave us recommendations on what he thought were stand-out dishes and wasn't afraid to answer honestly about things he didn't think were that special. Our waiter told us that the signature sushi is what Chef Rodelio Aglibot is known for. The signature sushi differs from regular sushi in that the rice is pan fried in ghee (clarified butter) and glazed with soy sauce. Then you can have it topped with hand cut spicy tuna and jalapeno, seared American kobe beef tartare, or shrimp tempura with avocado and wasabi. We opted for the spicy tuna. I wasn't sure how this would be, but I was willing to give it a shot. We both thought it was delicious. The rice on the bottom is cooked and so flavorful, then the fresh raw tuna on the top an a slice of fresh jalapeno. I was afraid it was going too be too spicy, but it wasn't, and I'm sensitive to spicy. Great balance and combination. A second recommendation from the waiter was the rock shrimp tempura with glazed walnuts and creamy honey aioli. I found these really addicting, but who doesn't love something fried up and drizzled with mayo and mixed with some glazed walnuts for a nutty crunchy sweet contrast? For an entree we split pancit Canton. This was also a recommendation from the waiter. I liked this dish, but I wanted something more out of it. I don't know if I wanted more salt, like a dash of shoyu, or a little more spice or what, but it was not my favorite of the day.  I thought that Sunda had good food, a great ambiance, and good service. It is pricy. We paid about $30 each, and that was just for lunch. I'm sure dinner is a lot more. That said, we did have leftover pancit and tempura. The serving sizes are plentiful and our waiter did mention a lot of people split dishes family-style like we did. We probably could have had a third person at lunch and have ordered the same amount of food, which would have made it more economical. I'd recommend Sunda to anyone who needs to take a client out to a high-end restaurant, someone who wants to impress a date, or someone celebrating a special occasion.",0.9981,0.801,0.162,0.038,0.577139754598771

So, I generally try to avoid these trendier restaurants because I think they typically bring down my reputation, but I compromised on the eve of a friend's birthday.  We arrived on the earlier side (you know, for the early bird special) but I actually didn't mind that because it wasn't overcrowded or loud yet.  By the time we finished however the bar was packed.   There were 6 of us so we got to try a ton of stuff on the menu.  I am not fibbing when I say every dish was phenomenal.  We started with this coconut shrimp type appetizer, of which I could probably eat an entire vat-full.  Then we tried a roll that our server said was most similar to a dragon roll; honey barbecue ribs (my favorite), a pasta dish with beef, the adobo pork belly, a duck roll, Filipino-style pot stickers, and last but certainly not least: the sea bass. The sea bass was out of this world. Drinks were delicious as well - lots of hand-crafted martinis, etc.   Overall, I loved the atmosphere and we had a great time.  Our server was a bit MIA sometimes - we had to flag down a manager to order another round of drinks - but he was otherwise knowledgeable and efficient.",0.9737,0.872,0.107,0.022,0.49090752242926167

However, our waiter was incredibly friendly and very patient with our very large -and very indecisive- group, taking the time to really talk through the menu with us, with his suggestions being spot-on. And one thing about super-trendy spots is that their interiors are way cooler than the usual takeout and dive bar spots that I frequent, Sunda being no exception. The food was fresh and full of flavor, with the rock shrimp tempura being the thing that dreams are made of. I had the shrimp and sea bass curry and had one of those experiences where you are painfully full, but its so good that you want to just keep eating.  We went for lunch and had no problem getting a reservation the day before. The crowd was light, the waiter was attentive, and the food was incredible.",0.193,0.853,0.073,0.074,0.48025412087912095
2010-07-04,5.0,"Having already indulged in a few mid afternoon libations at the Wit rooftop my girlfriend and I decided some food was in order before things got too crazy.  What was intended as a simple refueling exercise quickly evolved into the best meal of our whole time in Chicago. The decor is what you'd expect from an Asian restaurant but classily executed and not overdone. The low lighting and subtle ambiance were soothing and suited our mood perfectly. The clientele were a mixed, well heeled crowd bar the chap next to us who looked like he'd mistakenly strayed from Viagra triangle.   Realizing that we were perhaps a little tipsy and in need of some guidance our clever and charming server - Rachel - steered us to some amazing selections:   Hamachi with Jalapengo kicked things off beautifully. Artfully presented and deliciously flavorful.    Next up the Buddha salad which is quite frankly knock your socks off good.  The flavor of the rich crisp pork contrasting beautifully with the seared succulent ahi, crisp lettuce and sweet mango. Next sticky rice topped with with Ahi -a perfect combination of chewy crisp rice and delectable, silky ahi.    However if you ever go to Sundha and don't order the lobster roll with Waygu beef you will have missed something quite sublime. It was hands down the best thing I've eaten this year and caused my GF to proclaim that Sunda is amongst her all time top 5 dining choices. Ignore this suggestion at your peril.  My final tip is to take as many of the small Red candies at the reception desk as you can possibly fit into your purse/pockets/cheeks -they are unbelievably good - but beware the scary green candies.

2010-06-30,2.0,"Trendy space gets 4 stars from me.  Food gets only 2 and since I love food, Sunda underwhelmed me. Nothing was awesome but nothing was terrible Ibut I've definitely had A LOT BETTER. Big noisy space, cool decor but filled with business diners and women who were made up and dressed up just because they were going to a ""hip spot"".  I found Sunda to be annoying, as someone coming from NYC because restaurants and scenes like that are allllllll over NYC, so bf and I settled for Sunda because it was the only restaurant in the area without an insane wait. App: tuna tartare special. It was tuna tartare sandwiched between two fried wonton skins. It was pretty good but you really can't mess up tuna tartare. A bit salty though.... Main: baked crab roll your classic mess of fusion sushi. Waaaaay too much mayo on top, waaaay too much crunch. By the time I chewed through the mess on top I was wondering if this roll really had the crab that it said was in the roll. I really hate fusion restaurants that do this. Don't go to a sushi spot to order these disgusting sauces up balls of mayo if you don't like real raw fish.  Bf's main: black cod with  miso. Waaaaaay to salty. Miso flavor was great, the overdoing the miso paste was not.  Fish was perfectly cooked though.  What a waste.  I must've had black cod with miso a million times and I've never had it quite as salty.  This was not an enjoyable meal.

2010-06-29,4.0,"I was here for the first time Saturday night working at the Piven Theater benefit...and I will definitely be back. The VIP dinner was upstairs in a private room, and they did a great job accommodating all the benefit guests. As an employee of the theater, I was busy working all night so I didn't get an authentic dining experience by any means, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself even with all the hard work.  The cocktails they were serving guests looked and sounded delicious (although gala staffers weren't allowed to drink until after everything was over at 11pm, and this was all happening at 5:00, so we only got to look, not taste). As we meandered around the room mingling with guests and preparing for the live auction, the wait staff were bringing out courses upon courses of food, and it all smelled and looked so good. We were all getting extremely hungry, and very jealous that all these people were getting fed. About 15 of us volunteers/theater employees were in one of the random back hallways of the restaurant on these crazy Asian inspired couches that were super comfy and stylish (there are so many twists and turns in the hallways of this place I still don't understand it)...then suddenly 3 guys in chef uniforms came out with 4 platters of food, asked us if we were the volunteers, and they fed us! Oh man it was great...I don't know if I was just starving from looking and smelling the food all night, but it was some of the best food ever...and it was even presented very well and looked very pretty, but it only lasted a second because the 15 starving staffers were like vultures picking over road kill. We had 3 things to try, including some pork spring rolls with two kinds of dipping sauce (sweet and sour and something that was spicy and green...both very good). There were also a variety of sushi rolls on a platter, and fried shrimp tempura. I am still salivating while thinking of the shrimp...some of the best I've ever had, and one of the first things gone when they brought it out. Unfortunately I was on the far side of the couch from that platter and only got a piece or two, but had I known it was that good I would have trampled everyone else to get there first.  Later in the night we came back to pack up some stuff, and the downstairs bar and restaurant was still packed, even around midnight. The ambiance in the place is very swanky...relaxed, but still upscale. Totally my kind of place. And the whole restaurant still smelled amazingly delicious...somehow all the dishes there must really compliment each other. Usually sushi/Asian restaurants smell fishy and the amalgam of dishes leave an unappetizing stench...but not Sunda. I can't wait to come back and try the much talked about brunch (one of the bartenders was talking about the mimosas they have and I made a mental note to come check it out for myself), as well as some of the other entrees that everyone else seemed to enjoy so much during the event.

While I know Sunda has been open for quite some time, I haven't had the opportunity to check it out. My sister was in town and we both had a hankering for sushi and fab drinks. I offered up a few suggestions, but hands down Sunda won once she looked at it online. We made a reservation (leaving us minimal options only because it was Friday night at 8 pm). We opted for a 10:30 reservation for two and took our chances by showing up a little early. We were pleasantly surprised when they did seat us early after a short 15 minute wait.  The crowd was pretty dressed up. We felt a bit on the underdressed side not wearing a skirt or dress. This is definitely a ""pretty people"" place. I swear everyone was giving each other the once over. The only ding I could dig up was the fact that it was pretty loud. I don't know if I would go there with my boyfriend just because we wouldn't be able to talk and converse over a date-night meal. I actually like to talk to my company without shouting.  After navigating our way to a communal table, we scanned the drink list and couldn't choose between all the available options. My sister went with the Divine Lychee and I went with the Toasted Ginger snap martini. They were equally delicious. We also scored some free drinks sent from another table. We told them to pick for us. And they chose the Blushing Geisha. It was crisp, smooth, and went down way too easy to be tequila!  We ordered edamame to begin our meal with. I found it odd that they didnt give us a bowl to put the empty shells into. I also wanted soy sauce to dip my edamame, which I was not offered. We placed our order with three specialty rolls to start off with-- Summer of Sunda, Dragon, and Firecracker. They cleared our plates (with the empty shells) and gave us fresh ones for our sushi. That's when we were offered soy sauce. Now it was time to dig in!  Our fave roll, hands down, was the summer of sunda. The flavor palette of the basil combined with the mango and tuna was delicious. I wanted more! I found the dragon roll to be right on. No complaints. The firecracker roll was quite spicy, but plated in a unique fashion. It was made to look like nachos! The wasabi cream looked like a nacho cheese sauce. It was warm, gooey and yummy. Something I wouldn't have expected, but that is what impressed me.  I was not able to take advantage of dessert, but I have a feeling I will be back very soon! I definitely recommend this spot.",0.9982,0.768,0.196,0.036,0.5973761423761423

Everyone in my party left completely satisfied and wanting to come back.  Great Chicago restaurant for those who want to try something new and non-chain.   My best advice is (if at all possible), to make reservations for happy hour, Sunda Social.  Weekdays from 5-7pm, a separate, smaller menu is available with sushi rolls and appetizers for Half Price!  A number of their best and most popular appetizers are included.  We decided to share some so we could have a taste of everything.   - Everyone should try the Rock Shrimp (tempura-ed, cooked and glazed to perfection).   - More adventurous types will love the Roasted Duck Bao Buns.  They coat the duck with that delicious plum sauce.   - Though I'll agree the sushi isn't the best Chicago has to offer, the rolls merge creative ingredients, are presented beautifully and still taste great.  The Golden Child with Mango is a great summer sushi roll.  Deserving of mention is the Number Ten sushi roll for those who like Shrimp Tempura.   The restaurant ambiance reminded us of luxury hotels in the Philippines, Asian Contemporary.  Sunda has a nice open layout so you can see the bar and sushi bar from practically any table.  We saw all types of people, mostly after work business types, but our 5 person party of casual 20-somethings didn't stick out.  There were a few families with smaller children there, also.  With our discounted appetizers we spent the money on drinks, perfect for martini and wine lovers.  I had the lychee martini to complement the Asian dishes.   A must visit for foodies, out of towners who like Asian fusion, downtown Happy Hour folks and Girls Nights Out.",0.9991,0.697,0.303,0.0,0.5287429854096521

I highly recommend (most of) their specialty sashimi; tuna atop toasted shrimp-flavored rice; and their miso-glazed cauliflower.  Service was also quick and helpful, which was a plus considering how packed this place was.  At about $125 for both of us (including 1 drink a piece and tip), this place is not cheap..... but if you want a place to dress up and start your night out on the right foot, you can't go wrong at Sunda.",0.9632,0.847,0.153,0.0,0.6923129251700681

Wonderful organic miso soup with mushrooms and great garden vegetable roll. Also had an opportunity to sample some shrimp appetizers and other rolls. Everything was delicious and wonderfully prepared. I was also very delighted with my drink, which was iced tea with sweet or flavored vodka.

We were finally seated...in a horrible location I might add.  It was a tiny table meant for two but we had three.  One of my friends was seated on the side of the table with his back up against a pole.  He was uncomfortable the entire time and we could all tell.   The service at the table was good.  Every time we dropped a crumb or finished a plate, someone was there to pick it up.   The food was ok.  Nothing special.  It certainly didn't make up for the other areas I mentioned in this review.   Overall, 2 stars is generous in my mind.  This place is not worth the hype!",0.9651,0.817,0.131,0.052,0.5397893772893773

I've had the cod and the seabass there - both are good, but literally the just cook the fish put it in an eggplant, and do absolutely nothing for presentation. You spend $25-$30 on that and have to ask yourself why you just did that. It's a $15 dish effort at best.

We ordered:  Oxtail Potstickers  Hand Cut Spicy Tuna  Sunda's Yellow Tail Jalapeno  Sunda Rainbow Roll  The Sunda's Yellow Tail Jalapeno came out first. It was tasty, fresh. It was unique to other places. Next came the Sunda Rainbow Roll, again presentation was great, fresh tasting, however nothing really special about it. An hour and a half passes (remember only having two items come to our table) and after ordering another glass of wine our waiter said he was going to come check on us again. He did come back and said ""everything ok, can i get you anything else."" I was confused, as was my friend. I said, ""well you could get us the rest of the items we ordered?!"" He said ""oh what else was that"" I told him and he goes ""oh ok, yeah the kitchen is backed up, I will go check on those items"" Who forgets half our food plus blames it on a slow kitchen?! Shortly after that happened some one else served us the Hand cut spicy tuna, again it was ok nothing special. Then a few more min. pass and another person, possible manager, comes over and ask what we are waiting for (pot stickers). Shortly there after we get the potstickers. (Potstickers were all very good probably the best item we ordered!). After we finished them, the waiter came by and gave us our bill. He said ""oh by the way the potstickers were taken off"" So it was nice they did take something off the bill, but the entire experience was not impressive. I don't remember an apology of any kind, although he may have said ""sorry about the wait"" at one point, it wasn't significant enough for me to feel better about it. Maybe it was his first night, maybe it was a slammed kitchen. I would have thought that would have been mentioned at some point during the hour and a half we were waiting.

Lemongrass Beef Lollipops: These were BAD BAD BAD. It was a low quality cut of beef, thinly sliced and wrapped around a lemongrass stick. It was overcooked and tough and had an awful cheap beef flavor. Now I am sure they get fresh beef coming through the place all the time because they are such a high volume place, but to describe the flavor of this lollipop all I can say is imagine putting a steak in the freezer then pulling it out after 4 months nice and freezer burned and eating it. It was that type of ""beef"" flavor. Now I know the food was probably fresh, but it just tasted bad, nay, awful. BBQ Pork: Was mediocre. It was a very fatty piece of pork. Now I am a disciple of the pork fat gods, I love the stuff. I will smear lard over toast and all. But the pork just was not that good. The sauce on top was meh, and the bok choy it was served with was bad too. To be fair, we didn't try any seafood, maybe it's good there.

2010-04-07,5.0,"We had a mix of things for dinner at Sunda, since there were so many interesting dishes that we couldn't settle on a large entree. The waitress was friendly and accommodating, though the place is so busy, you shouldn't expect your server to be readily available at all times. Decor is very hip. Ambience is youthful and trendy; I'm not, but Sunda made me seem cooler for just a few moments. Lots of young business types standing and drinking at the bar. I was impressed by the diverse crowd (though trending young), since there were different races, a good mix of men and women, and some gay fellas (yay, it must be cooler here than I thought). We had the oxtail potstickers, which taste a lot better than they look (tender braised meat in a thin wrapper, covered with a tasty sauce); the steamed duck bao (which are more like slider-sized sandwiches with bouncy and slightly sweet twists of bao dough encasing the meat); and loompya. The loompya was good, but since I've had a lot of different kinds of this type of dish, it was the least memorable for me. Shanghai style (like they serve here) is my favorite, though, because it's thinly rolled and crispy and great with a dipping sauce. We also got the truffled takaki (the ""all of the above"" version) sashimi. This consists of thinly sliced pieces of fish wading in a light sauce and covered with various delicate leafy sprigs (watercress and something else I cannot recall). The quality of the sashimi was excellent, with that exquisite transition from firm to buttery texture while you are eating it that blows your mind. The cocktails were fanciful (trendy? imaginative?) but not strong, so I have no excuse for my lack of recall about which girly fruity concoction I picked. I remember that they were flavorful and enjoyable in the way that sunny cocktails whose primary target group are women generally are.

Intrigued? So was I. Press like this though sets some pretty big expectations and big expectations often lead to some pretty big disappointments. But not in this case!!  My experience with Sunda was pretty much perfect for the modern trendy higher-end restaurant scene Sunda is trying to be.  Décor, food, atmosphere, crowd, and staff were all superb! Especially the staff who absolutely did everything to make sure we had the perfect time. You certainly won't be making a mistake by trying this place out ...and be sure to arrive hungry! There are so many great dishes, if you're anything like me, you'll almost certainly want to try more dishes than you have room for ...unless you're a cow with four stomachs! Sunda's diverse menu may just make you wish you were! In any event, I recommend this place without reservation, maybe you won't have the five star experience I did but I'd be hard pressed to imagine anyone not at least enjoying this place.  The details....  Went on a Thursday night just under a couple weeks ago with a friend from DC. We had just been to Epic the night before so not only did Sunda have to live up to its press but also to Epic's great experience as well. At 8:00 PM, Sunda's chic rather size-able place was completely packed. Not wanting to wait for a table we took a sushi counter reservation I had made by phone earlier. This turned out to be just fine and the crowd definitely gave the feeling you were in the place-to-be for dinner in Chicago on a Thursday night.  On the menu for us:  + Duck Hash Salad - unique and simply UNBELIEVABLY good! My friend not liking duck ...at least until he tried this dish was equally impressed. Thanks to Brett D for the recommendation! I may have skipped over this otherwise and I'm *soooo* glad I didn't as it was possibly the highlight of what we ordered.  + Truffled Tuna - a very good subtle dish. Take a moment to enjoy the delicate flavors here.  + Oxtail Pot stickers  + Tail of Two Tunas  I enjoyed both of these and would recommend them.   However they left less of an impression on me than the other dishes and after two weeks I have a bit of a hard time remembering them in detail.  Well done but not as unique as many of the other menu options.  + Corn Fritters - you know I wouldn't have ordered these from the description and by themselves they were dry and not very interesting. However, add the accompanying sauce and it completely transformed into a fantastic little small plate dish and possible the perfect mate for your Asian import beer of choice. With an extensive saké, wine, and drink list though it would almost seem like such a shame to drink beer for all but the most die-hard of fans.  + Sake and Escolar Nigiri (Salmon and Super White Tuna sushi style with rice) - super fresh and absolute wonderful flavor! Not as generous in portion as some sushi places but in all other aspects as good as I've had in the states and even abroad except for Tokyo itself.  + Char Siu Pork - not bad; just nothing special. this is the one item I would recommend not getting and saving your appetite for one of the other amazing options.  + Ridiculous - ""Ridiculously Good"" !!! This hot carrot cake dessert baked around a scoop of ice cream and topped with a layer of melted caramel was the perfect ending  ...drool On closing, I can't underscore the part about the staff enough. Everyone from the seating hosts who worked around us being late and were willing to squeeze in a possible third later when there wasn't room; the chefs who not only prepared the outstanding dishes but also joined us for an impromptu saké shot (should have found out what that saké was as it was the best I had had); Ray our most excellent server who really helped us pick the best Sunda had to offer and then took a genuine interest in our experience; and Stacey, Sunda's absolute fabulous manager who really made us feel welcome and valued ....what more can I say she was great! The staff did so much to take care of us, I almost for a second thought they had even updated my car to a Bentley when the valet pulled up in one. OK, they weren't ***THAT*** good but seriously I can't thank the staff enough as they really helped seal the Sunda experience for us.",0.9996,0.714,0.249,0.037,0.5794910693594904

Food was OK.  There is so much delicious sushi elsewhere in this city (for much cheaper), that paying almost $20 for a fusion roll seems silly...so I didn't try it.  The special scallop hash appetizer was great.  Garlic noodles with crab meat were tasty.  Greasy, but tasty.   Overall...trendy, but overpriced.",0.9896,0.731,0.208,0.061,0.642241968557758

It took us a while to be seated even with reservations, which was upsetting, however we were treated with a complimentary appetizer (I believe it was a version of honey-walnut shrimp....my fave!)  With both my date and me being filipino, I had to have him try Sunda's version of Crispy Pata which in absolutely no way disappointed. The meat was so tender, it fell off the bone while the outside was nice and crispy. It also came with two savory sauces, reminiscent  of what Mom makes, but upgraded. We also ordered the kobe beef tar tar and a roll (I think it was called The Number Nine) which were equally amazing. I know that one of the chef's best desserts on the menu was ""The Ridiculous"" which definitely lived up to it's name.

2010-03-20,2.0,"I really don't get the hype on this place. Maybe I had too high expectations after hearing people raving about this place.  The food was between good and ok, but it wasn't great. My fiance and I were not blown away. We've definitely had better contemporary sushi that have blown us away and leaving us impressed and wanting more (we are self-professed foodies and we eat out ALOT). The Spicy Tail of Two Tunas specialty roll was odd mainly because it was topped with fried shallots. The combination did not go well. Contemporary sushi is supposed to look pretty. The roll was like Plain Jane and the random sprinkles of fried shallots over the pieces and plate made the entire thing look ugly! I love fried shallots, but with the roll? It was odd. The other roll we ordered was Wa-Machi which was basically filled with hamachi and topped with green tobiko. The look of the roll was also not very appetizing because of its dull appearance. Don't get me wrong, I love traditional rolls anytime but if I'm going to pay $15 for a darn contemporary roll, it better look like there was some effort in making it look pretty and contemporary! Our favorite dish of the night was the string beans with lap cheong (Chinese sausage) and walnuts. This, I have to admit, was very delicious.  Our server was adequate although I couldn't help but notice that another server who was serving the other tables next to us was beyond adequate than our server. After each dish arrived at the nearby tables, their server would go over and explain to them what went into the dish and how it was cooked. To me, this demonstrates professionalism and knowledge by the server which I regret that our server did not quite display at a restaurant like Sunda. The prices are also a little higher than other contemporary Asian places I've been to. I'm not a fan of how their sashimi menu worked. This is the only restaurant I've been to where each order of sashimi comes with 4 pieces and because of that, each order already costs about $14-$16. That defeats the whole purpose of ordering a large variety of sashimi platter to try and sample. At other places I've been to, one order of sashimi would come with 2 pieces. This is perfect for ordering a wide array of sashimi with a couple slices for each type of fish to try and savor. Sunda is a good place if you just want to go out and dine in a modern Asian restaurant.

Kind of pricey but its the new thing! This sort of discourse is usually a big deterrent to me, equivalent to seeing a radiation symbol on a door.  But since I lived in the area, on the same street, and literally had to pass by every day, I decided... a little radiation never hurt.   July 28 2009, I tried Sunda for the first time, on my birthday, with my dad.  We had the lunch specials and some sushi.  I had the ""shrimp and sea bass curry"" - green curry, pineapple, peppers and lemongrass.  I love seabass and shrimp but I HATE curry.  Our server was a little asian girl by the name of nikki (i think) that was so emphatic about the curry fish I had no choice but to try.  My dad had ""grilled petite ny steak""  (8 oz) Korean style with sesame and soy.  Before our dishes came out the server brought us some fish chips that you can usually only find in Chinatown.  I was told that the restaurant ""imports"" them from Chinatown, LOL. The two meals were the perfect amount of flavor and size for the both of us for lunch.  I am not a big fan of curry nor korean style anything but since Sunda was somehow able to do some magic with their curry I would definitely try it again in the near future.  February 27, 2010 my GF and I went into Sunda to grab a quick appetizer before our actual dinner at a restaurant nearby.   We asked for a table at the sushi bar because it was 99% vacant and we really only had about 10 minutes before we had to leave.  Surprisingly though, the two hostesses (a petite black girl and equally petite asian girl) gave us very smug looks and then rolled their eyes.  I'm not sure if they were annoyed that we didn't want to sit at a real table or if they were just trying to make it seem like the place was so cool that you couldn't just ask for a table without a 3 month reservation, even if it is clearly not that busy.  Anyways, we told our waiter, who looked like a photocopy of Llyod Lee (played by Rex Lee) from Entourage (very awesome), that we only wanted to order some super white (escolar) tuna and had to leave.  He was very understanding and quickly put in the order.  The sushi was quite heavenly and the service from after the hostess part was excellent.  To my surprise I was thoroughly impressed by Sunda and will be back for more soon, hungry and hopefully able to stay longer.",0.9964,0.814,0.147,0.039,0.49332678638234195

Lucky for me, I got to try this place on the company dime, and they way overordered so I didn't feel bad stealing bites of a lot of little things.  The sushi is decent. I wouldn't make this a destination when I'm craving it, but they were creative and made for a good conversation starter. I would pass on the veggie roll - it's like crudo wrapped around rice. Too healthy for my needs. Throw in some avocado or cream cheese and we'll talk. The shiitake mushroom roll was tasty, as was the spicy tuna.  Also tried the seaweed and mushroom salads. The seaweed salad was actually awesome. It looked like a big bowl of stringy slim but tasted light and refreshing. The mushroom salad was a bit boring, and could have used a more flavorful dressing.  Oddly enough, I ended up not liking the shrimp and wasabi appetizer, which is apparently what Sunda is known for. All I could taste was guacamole on top of fried nothing. On the other hand, the corn fritters were fried but pouring with flavor. I wanted to dump the sweet dipping sauce on everything. There were lots of meat dish that looked great. The one vegetarian dish appeared to be a kind of wet crouton salad, but that was just a cover for the garlic noodles laying beneith. They were really, really good, but I had dragon breath for the rest of the afternoon (even after two rounds of listerine). Not a good dish for date night. Last but not least was...mochi!

Sounds good to me!   Once seated, they brought out a complimentary noodle dish and we ordered edamame to start.  Picked out one of the specials of the evening, which was some kind of fabulous roll that was topped with a seafood mix of crab & lobster, baked, and had a bit of a spicy mayo flavor.  It was too die for and our server assured us that they were planning to make it a regular fixture on the menu.  Also got the garden veg roll, which was enjoyed even by my carnivorous date.  The escolar was fantastic as well, the potato chip giving it quite a surprisingly great twist.   For dessert we chose the ridiculous, which was......ridiculously delicious!!  It started off a chain reaction in our row, as everyone looked at the table next to theirs and ordered it as well.  It was a tough choice as all of the options sounded great.   I can't say enough positive things about Sunda - great service, polite staff, very innovative and tasty flavors, and a super hip & urban vibe.  My only small complaint is that our table was next to a post with a small gap in between that became the walkway for the wait staff.  The constant traffic was a bit annoying after a couple of hours, but didn't overshadow what was a wonderful experience.  Sunda has risen to the top of my favorite Chicago restaurants!!",0.9978,0.686,0.254,0.06,0.626027481290639

At first, I didn't really think it was anything special but after having a few more bites, I appreciated the flavors and became a believer! My favorite dish of the night was the pork/duck bun- I liked how it came in the basket too. We also got some fish dishes which were great--very flavorful and tender--and finished it off with a molten chocolate cake. The cake was pretty standard but with a unique sauce that I very much enjoyed. The atmosphere and decorations are also very nice. Our waitress was very attentive and informative. The manager also came by to make sure everything was going smoothly, which was nice. I'm taking off one star for the hostesses.

Then we got the raved about devils basket which is the wok crab made with four types of chillis, scallions, and some other stuff. It was super spicey, like i mean your mouth is on fire kind of spicy, but delcious as the crab was on the sweeter side combined with all the spicyness equals a great combination :) Then we had the bbq pork as an entree which was also delicious. I'm not a fan of pork but the flavor and the quality was really good as well as everything else. I could tell this restaurant wants to serve good quality ingredients.

Next time :) The reason i'm not giving them 5 stars is because our server was really rude, I asked her if there was anything light to drink and she was like no, this is all we have, with a really bad attitude, and the whole time she was kind of cold, so I feel like if she could have offered us any suggestions at all, the place would have received 5 stars.

2010-01-05,2.0,"My high anticipation and expectations for Sunda were unfortunately not met, though there is a caveat. I went for an early dinner/post work light eat. Therefore, we focused more on the small plate and sushi items of the menu and did not order a main entre. However, that should not exempt a restaurant for serving relatively uninspiring dishes without a distinct flavor. The decor was impressive, especially in the large space. There were two bars, communal tables, interesting lighting and lots of things to distract your eyes. The service was equally pleasant, fast and knowledgeable about the food they were serving. The front room also gets very high marks. But it always comes back to the food, that is what we pay far (quite dearly in this case) and why we let someone else do the cooking. As I said, we ordered four small plates to share and call a meal. Two of them were sushi rolls (more sushi and sashimi on the menu then I expected), the duck bao and finally the highly touted Devils basket (soft shell crab in a whole host of chili peppers and other hot spices).The Number Nine ($16) and Golden Child ($12) specialty rolls were anything but special in my opinion, especially for the price. Number nine is a shrimp, unagi, tobiko, asparagus, tempura flake, kaiware and unagi sauce while golden child consists of super white tuna, mango, avocado, tempura crumbs with mango crème. I am normally a huge fan of large and complicated maki rolls as I love the different flavors you can create in one bite. Unfortunately I did not get any of that with either roll, with the main culprit being I couldn't quite taste anything from the fish which is supposed to be the star of the show. I think the golden child roll was a bit more satisfying with the mango flavor, but neither one was good enough to order more of (a fair standard for which I judge maki rolls). Maybe I'm being harsh, but there are plenty of good local sushi places I can go for complicated rolls at much less cost. The Duck Bao buns (4 for $10) were also confusing and disappointing in that the main flavor should be the duck, which did not have a lot of flavor. The second part is that the bao bun is more like a bao sandwich, which turns into a lot of bao dough served with some only ok duck. Finally there was the Devils basket, wok tossed crispy soft shell crabs in dried chilies, shallots, scallions and toasted garlic ($16). Hailed by Chicago Magazine as the best new dish of 2009, I was very curious what would come out of the kitchen. I don't know if I would crown it the best dish of the year, but it was by far the best dish of the night. Lots of good flavors with an overall message of spicy crispy goodness. Unfortunately it was the only such dish that seemed to have everything figured out to present a unified flavor. My main message is not that I had a horrible time, or that the food was terrible and inedible. Quite the contrary. And maybe my expectations were a little high walking in the door so that anything but perfection would be a let down. But what I keep thinking about is that most of the food presented did not pass the sniff test, simply is the food tasty with good flavors. Combine that with questionable value and you leave scratching your head. Maybe I had a bad night, or they had a bad night because everywhere I look is nothing but praise. I would love to come back, try the main course dishes (they do look very interesting and tasty) and change my opinion (I always love good food); when I do, I know I won't be paying the bill.",0.9927,0.758,0.149,0.093,0.5604962218188024
2010-01-02,1.0,"Sunda - what a blunder!!!! We (couple of my friends and I) decided to go to Sunda for our New Year brunch hoping for a great meal. First thing we found was that it was a reduced menu but we decided to keep an open mind when we saw that it said $10 unlimited dim sum when you order an entree. We had a reservation yet it took 10 mins for someone to come take our drink orders. When the drinks came, my order was wrong (how confusing is it when the order is a lychee mimosa but I got what I thought was a mango mimosa). The server didnt even notice it and didn't bother to come ask us how our drinks were. Then we order our food (after another 10 min wait for the server to come back). Now the restaurant was busy but not packed so these delays didnt make sense. We had ordered 3 entrees and 3 sets of dumplings under the $10 unlimited menu. After 25 minutes of waiting for the food, the server comes over, makes some fake apologies and informs us that they ran out of dumplings coz they didnt plan well (genuises!!! considering that they said unlimited - was that really a surprise). What pissed me off was that it took 20 minutes to let us know - makes me think they filled other orders and then stuck us with the ""ran out of"" excuse. Then they say that they will replace the orders with sushis but our server is nowhere in sight to take the order after he hands over the menu. At this time the restaurant was mostly empty. It was the shoddiest display of service I have ever seen. Then they bring out the entrees and my friend's rice is ice cold. At this point he really gives them a piece of his mind and then they call over the management team to placate us. Our server of course kept vanishing off to serve his friends who had come into the restaurant and were seated not too far from us. We decide to order a 2nd drink and I clearly tell the server that I want the mango mimosa that was mistakenly served but he brings over a lychee this time instead. i send him back and he gets me a mango mimosa. We all do a double take because this was clearly not what I was served the last time. It makes me wonder what I was served the last time around - lychee mimosa mixed with someone else's left over drink?? It was really the most disappointing meal I have had in many years....what a colossal New Year's Day mistake. They covered the charges of our 2nd drinks and the sushi orders as a gesture when they should have given us the entire meal free after this.... PLEASE DONT GO TO SUNDA if you can help it...its all hype and no substance....pathetic service.....guess customer is clearly not king there - wonder how long they will survive with this kind of service in a city with so many options....",-0.783,0.847,0.071,0.082,0.43189393939393933

I have had the Indo corn fritters, garden veg rolls, mushroom baos and other items.  They are all scrumptious.  The server was extremely attentive, sincere and came to the table to numerous occasions to make sure everything was okay.   Sunda has a beautiful, trendy backdrop, impeccable, yet relaxed service and exquisite cuisine.  You will not be disappointed.",0.9908,0.769,0.231,0.0,0.6419590643274854

I know a lot of people have pre-conceived notions about billy dec, the underground, rockit, etc etc, but i have to give it to the guy and his team : they do a bang up job of making classy restaurants. The clientele is definitely upper rim - but as someone noted below, not a snooty upper class , more of a relaxed setting . A lot of old and young, diverse professionals from Chicago - this place hasn't quite turned into the tourist / suburbanite trap that is now Japonais. I went with a large party , about 10 people , for my friend's birthday. They were very accomodating with the reservation and had our table ready on time. The server was excellent and did a great job of handling everyones orders - many of us were vegetarians and she was receptive to what was veggie friendly on the menu, what was good, etc etc.  Having been here for lunch and dinner - i'd definitely recommend the corn fritters,  and the sunda special sushi with the avocado/shrimp topping - it was probably some of the best sushi i'd ever had.  The curry chicken/noodle thing for lunch is fantastic, the desserts are all pretty much awesome, and the thai fried chicken for dinner is superb...i'd avoid the grilled chicken with bok choy dish though, it was a bit more boring.

We started with 3 apps, the mushroom and asparagus dish, crab garlic noodles, and soft shell crabs.  Oh, and I got a miso soup, which was nicely flavorful, complete with an ample amount of scallions, weeds of the sea, and tofu.  As a veg, I only tried the shrooms, which were served in an iron skillet--they were strong.  I kind of adore mushrooms in any format, but this was a nice selection of exotics--enough for 3 to share if you're also getting other apps.  I powered through most of it myself and was full, but still had my game face on for sushi.  The garlic noodles got good reviews as ""very garlicy"", and the soft shells were wonderfully presented in a pot of seared peppers and were quite spicy. I got 3 rolls, the veg roll (minus the lettuce and ponzu), a hamachi and scallion roll (though they forgot the scallions), and the golden childn roll minus the mango creme (they forgot the real mango)...at first I was fussy abt the omissions, but I have to say, the fish stood alone quite well.  I was really impressed--I haven't had fish I liked this much since I lived in Boston and had access to Oishii (godliness of all sushi restaurants).  My brother got a spicy tuna (good), california (w/ real crab, good), and a shrimp tempura roll (also solid). I would definitely return.  I would say that our waiter initially was not up to par--he took a while to get to us--he became more attentive once the meal was under way.  I'm pretty sure he was just pissed that we weren't ordering copious amounts of alcohol.  The rolls were very well sized, and although their special rolls are overly fussy for my taste, they were willing to leave off components that I didn't want, which not all places will do. For the 1st time in my life I had leftovers after eating sushi...I blame the appetizers.  I was disappointed with myself at first, but then realized that now I get veg rolls for lunch today, which can only be a good thing.

She agreed with me that you can get sushi anywhere.  But Filipino food at an upscale downtown restaurant?  That's why we were at Sunda.  You can't find that anywhere. The decor and clientele scream high class,  but upon closer inspection it's a relaxed high class.  The waiters were rocking Converses and we ate at a communal table with a good view of the entire restaurant.  It wasn't kitsch so much as it was comforting. They've got four Filipino dishes on the menu, though our group ordered three.  A buddy and I matched our food with some good ol' San Miguel (Filipino beer).  We ordered: Loompya (a clever re-spelling of the classic lumpia).  Perfectly formed eggrolls, with a savory green vinegar sauce unlike anything I've paired with this Filipino standby. Crispy pata, the giant fried pork shank.  This came out delicious and juicy.  It was also fun seeing a giant shank sitting on the table. Adobo pork belly.  I've never seen pork belly used in adobo, and after eating this, I want to see it much more often.  Adobo is such a versatile Filipino food, and in this dish it was the meat that made it. Protip: White rice isn't included with the dishes, but you can order it for a couple bucks.  They brought us several bowls and only charged us for one order.  Nice! Eventually, the general manager came by and admired our Filipino spread.  He brought us some off-the-menu sisig, which was so mind-blowing I almost broke down in tears.  My roommate was even impressed when he tried the leftovers the next morning.  The executive chef here is Filipino, and I've heard stories of there being other off-the-menu specials, depending on what ingredients he has.  I definitely recommend inquiring about them. I'm ecstatic to find a place willing to bring Filipino cuisine up to a new level.  It wasn't even too pricey, coming out to about $50 a person including tip and drinks.  I wish Sunda the best of luck, and hope all you Yelpers give the Filipino dishes a whirl sometime!",0.9975,0.793,0.184,0.023,0.5352219161310071

2009-10-19,4.0,"Hello to all the Yelpers, to day will review Sunda.  Let me start with saying that Sunda was my 3rd sushi fusion experience (Japonaise, Sushi Samba, Sunda)  Let me say this, it's better than Sushi Samba but not as good as Japonaise.  Me and my date went to Sunda on Saturday, place was packed and buzzing with vibrant people.  Service was pleasant and since they were busy we had to wait even with a reservation for another 30 min.  During the wait we went by the bar, where large number of people were hugging the bar so we couldn't get to the waiter.  Pleasant enough the girl sitting by the bar was nice enough to grab the waiter and order the drink for us.  I don't drink so I can't tell you if the drinks are good or bad, but while my date was drinking her Tornado I was able to look around and feel the place out.  Here's my take.  Sunda is a Philippino/Sushi Fusion decorated from ""philippino bamboo"" decorated in a modern feel.  That's what they say, what is saw was weird ""bench"" sitting setup which didn't look comfortable at all, it doesn't give you any privacy because you are rubbing shoulders with people next to you. This might be good if you go with bunch of guy and you are sitting next to group of girls.  The rest of the place looked nice but nothing special.  Sushi bar looked lot better than the sitting area.  So after two drink we were seated on one of those benches and since I didn't like it I asked the hostess to seat us by the sushi bar.  That took another 10 minutes of waiting. Once we set down it was all good.  My favorite thing is Caterpillar and this time I decided to try something different. What ever I went with was good but not good enough to satisfy my unagi craving.  Food - fresh and great  Ambience - Ok, seems like there is potential for meeting nice people, in-crowd still visits this place. Seating setup for a $100 - $200 dollar dinner did not appeal to me, I expect some nice seats when I spend that kind of money.  Service - good  That's it folks, my last comment is I'm pretty sure I'll be back to Sunda.  Have a nice day.",0.9864,0.757,0.154,0.089,0.6082041343669251

It was my first time sitting at the sushi bar but I really did enjoy it.  The sushi chefs were working diligently to serve the very crowded restaurant and yet their work still looked so delicious and perfect!  It takes me nearly 5 minutes to cut one tuna roll at home... no joke.   The sushi was delicious!  Very fresh and looked absolutely beautiful.  Obviously it's a pricey place, so don't plan on leaving there with a bill for 2 at less than $100.  It is also a LONG dinner type place - meaning don't expect to be in and out in less than an hour - try more like 2 hours+.  However, it is well worth it.  If not only for the delicious food, but for the people watching.   The people watching is almost better than at O'hare!  I was captivated by the beautiful men and women... where did they come from?!  I swear I never see this many beautiful people in Chicago...  I'm pretty sure Sunda flew in the cast of Gossip Girl or something.

The only other thing I didn't love was that we had a 9:30 reso and were there on time and we still had to wait for a table for 15 minutes, normally this is not the end of the world but the bar was sooooo crowded with people waiting to head over to underground we couldn't even get a drink (not like we really needed another anyways......)",0.9436,0.79,0.142,0.068,0.4749470899470899

I am typically not the type of person to love those new, cliche restaurants that are launched by a group of Chicago nightlife staples.  Sunda definitely proved to be an exception!  I went with my extended family for my mom's birthday.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table which were all amazing.  The wrinkled green beans were so delicious we had to get a second order and I am still trying to figure out how to replicate them at home!  I couldn't decide what to get for my main dish (the menu is huge) and ended up getting riddled with anxiety when the waiter came by me and just ordered some sushi.  I ordered two of the signature rolls which were both phenom!  My sister ordered the duck which was also amazing and one of my cousins ordered the pork - also fantastic!  My aunt, uncle and grandma all went with the soft shell crabs which were cooked in a steaming boll filled with vegetables and thai dried chillis.  The results were magically spicy and delicious. The menu was pricey, so definitely more of a special occasion place, but definitely worth trying if you're into Asian cuisine!",0.9821,0.831,0.162,0.006,0.6004046677959721

2009-09-01,3.0,"I wanted to like this place more than I did. Everything sounded delicious on the menu and in the reviews but something about it was just off.  It was as hip as I expected but in a very Cavalli sort of way. If you like Roberto Cavalli clothes, you will like the atmosphere and people watching of Sunda. The main room was excruciatingly loud. My reservation was at 8:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night and with the size and cavernous nature of the dining room my boyfriend and I could barely hear each other. Definitely put in a reservation, this place was pretty packed for a Tuesday.  The service was good. Our waitress was very nice and really down to earth which was a nice change but nothing too memorable. She left us around 10:00 because her shift was over which was fine because we were paying the bill at that point but it was definitely a little awkward seeing her eat at the sushi bar while we were leaving.  We ordered a sashimi dish (with tomato and thai basil) which was flavorful but subtle, the devil's basket (deep fried soft shell crab in a cast iron basket of chilies) which was great for me but might be too spicy for some and the beef lollipops. The lollipops had an interesting presentation but were dry and the sauce overpowered the light scent of the lemongrass the beef was rolled on. We also had a few of the hand rolls. They were really small but had a good flavor. The spicy hamachi poke was my favorite.  I was really disappointed by the dessert. We ordered the mochi plate and being at a nice restaurant, I expected them to be homemade. They were not. They were definitely taken out of the plastic packaging, cut in half and put on a plate paired with three sauces (which were fine but nothing special, the sauces too could have come from a box).  With so many Asian fusion places in Chicago, I just don't know why you'd go to this one. It's interesting but I think you'd be better served at more low-key spots like Spring or Takashi if you're in it for the food.",0.9962,0.772,0.188,0.041,0.5520313681027966

We had two appetizers - Rock Shrimp which were AMAZING!!! and the Watermelon Eel salad.  The eel salad was a few cubes of watermelon topped with eel 'bacon'.  It was a new taste, as I had never tried fruit and fish in the same bite.   My wife and I split the beef ribs and they were OHMYGAWD good!!! The meat was soooo soft that we didn't need a knife.. I was able to PULL it off with my chopsticks!  Amazing!!!!! For dessert, I had the Ridiculous, and my wife had the Molten Chocolate cake.  I can say the Ridiculous was... damn good!  it is like a scoop of vanilla ice cream that is dipped in carrot cake batter and deep fried.  Very very tasty.   By the way, when you go, ask for Daniel!

2009-08-24,4.0,"Have you ever had a dish that was soo good, you immediately ordered another serving of it? That happened to me at Sunda. . . . twice.  My husband received a $100 gift card for his birthday, so we were ready to spend big (for us anyways) at Sunda. We started with the crispy duck hash which was fantastic and then moved on the escolar (white tune) topped with a black truffle. The escolar was amazing, but don't bother with the fancy truffle prep. It ass nothing. Just get the regular order for like half the price...and that's just what we did, enjoying another round of the perfect fish.  Then it was on the duck bao, which were sliced like sandwiches rather than stuffed like dumplings but were still delicious, soft and chewy with a tangy hoisin sauce on the duck.  The much-raved about crispy rice, which we opted to have topped with the shrimp and avocado, was fine but I wouldn't order it again. the crispy rice part was great, but the topping, which was essentially shrimp guacamole, was just too much. I had to scrap half of it off (and I love gauc).  The highlight for me was the fried crab handroll though. Holy hell. As soon as I took one bite, I asked my husband ""can we order another one?"" (in my defense, they are small. shared by two people you get two small bites each).  So the crispy duck salad, bao, 2 rounds of sushi, 2 rounds of crab handroll and the cripsy rice, plus 3 tall Sapporo's and a small bottle of hot sake (for sake bombs) was $130.  The service was fantastic throughout the dinner. We did have one little hiccup and that was that after we paid - $30 plus tax and tip on my card after using the gift card - we got home and realized we didn't have my credit card. We called and the host said ""well no one has turned it in"". Okay.... well it's Friday night and my card is floating around Sunda or out on the street. Someone could do a lot of damage. Maybe you could go LOOK for it, check with my server? Nope. So I called and cancelled it, then at 1am, got a call saying they had it.  But other than that slight annoyance, everything was great and we will definitely be back for more of the crab handroll, the bao and the crispy duck.",0.9946,0.766,0.174,0.06,0.4776642628205128

And the cocktails are quite yummy - I think one of the most popular fruity drinks is the ""Go-Go Strawberry."" And honestly, it tastes pretty good...  As for the food, there is nothing spectacular or unique. We tried about 5 different appetizers. None of which are worth going into detail. For main course, we tried some sushi and the ""Toast and Jam"" - a crispy fried shrimp (toast) with a layer of spicy tuna puree (jam). Sounds cool!  Tastes kinda yukky.  :-(  For MUCH less money, I'd rather head to Uptown and have authentic asian cuisine at a place with outrageously innovative food... at a noise level that I can have conversations.    Note: this is NOT a good date place.

2009-08-10,3.0,"Overall 3 and a HALF stars, but be warned.. my math may not add up Ambiance - 4 stars: No matter if you love or hate the food, the ambiance is pretty swank, given you are looking for a lively location that is loud. If you're looking for quiet, romantic, dark areas to canoodle, Sunda does not fit the bill, but if you're more in the mood for a lively atmosphere more appropriate for a fun or first date (albeit pricey), Sunda definitely fits the bill. The place is typical trendy restaurant design. High ceilings, open dining areas create a welcoming feel. The decoration makes the place feel slightly earthy with materials that kinda make you feel like you're dining in a forest...kinda. Anyways, Sunda wants to create a ""hipster"" type atmosphere and it hits the mark, albeit it tries so hard that it becomes a bit generic in doing so.  Either way, not an ugly place! Food - 3 Stars: To be honest, save for the Duck Salad thingy that I ordered (which I must say was absolutely delicious), nothing else the other 3 in my group and I ordered was memorable. Now let me preface by saying the food is worth the price for the type of atmosphere Sunda tries to create. I expected prices to be slightly more expensive (what can I say I have expensive tastes). So.. GET THE DUCK.  The rolls were good, but nothing extraordinary or imaginative. I also got the sea bass, and while I thought it was decent, and well cooked, again it was nothing extraordinary. There was a wide selection of drinks, and they were good, but again, nothing special (plus, the cocktails were a bit overpriced). Did not get desserts as they didn't seem to be anything special. Service- 3.5: Our server was very knowledgeable and his recommendation of the duck was spot-on.. Only complaint-- food was pretty slow to come out, but it's because this place was packed even on a Monday night.  General comments: So basically Sunda is a place to go to be seen and maybe a place to try just to say you've tried it (or catch a glimpse of visitng baseball players such as A-Rod or Jeter). The duck is DEFINITELY worth going back for but everything else is more of the same, which isn't me trying to bash Sunda or anything, its just that nothing BLEW me away.",0.9966,0.774,0.184,0.041,0.5184947538337369
2009-08-10,4.0,"I've been living in San Diego for awhile now and am totally out of the loop of Chicago restaurant hot spots, but apparently this is one of the new ones.  It's Asian fusion and to describe it to those who are not familiar let us pretend for a second that restaurants are dudes. Well Sunda would roll with an entourage of others like Japoinais, Nobu, and Sushi Samba. The average Joe like myself would probably not be able to hang with them because their occupations are all doctors, lawyers, and business executives that require a hefty income to keep up with. Back to normal. Restaurants are restaurants and people are people, and I was able to check out Sunda because my new boss was taking me out. Here is my analysis.  We will start with my cocktail which was a pear seared sake. I was told it was their best seller and can see why. It was fruity but had enough kick that I wouldn't have been embarrassed to drink it in front of my buddies from college.  As an appetizer we ordered some sort of sushi roll that had tuna in it. (The name slips my mind) It was very solid and woke my taste buds up for the deliciousness that was to come in the form of a main course. When deciding, I flirted with the cod for a bit but went with the sea bass. That entrée decided to party with my tastebuds like it was new years eve of 1999. Overall the food was great but as mentioned before came with a bit of a pricetag.  In terms of atmosphere it was cool but loud. My new boss probably thought I was an idiot because I couldn't hear her that well due to the restaurant noise and rather than continue to yell ""WHAT?"" I just answered her questions to what I thought she was asking. EXAMPLE  (What she said) How do you like living in San Diego? (What I thought she said) How do you like playing with legos? (My answer) Oh yeah, I love legos! (Her facial expression) This guy is an idiot!

But who could resist the temptation of a new Billy Dec restaurant?! And see what all the hype was about in Chicago. Boy was I in for a surprise! Service: FIVE STARS!! Each time I've been there, I've been presented with great service right from getting out of the car and getting seated!

It does get crowded and can get a bit loud, but still offers enough intimacy for you and your special friend! Food: A great spin on traditional Asian fare! The sushi was on par with typical sushi restaurants, but nothing spectacular. However, items I would recommend include the roasted duck has salad (full of flavor!), steamed soup dumplings (a bit overpriced, but a great taste of those from back at home!) and the duck...what...pork? They're steamed buns filled with duck and pork and are served in traditional bamboo baskets and are just the cutest lil sandwiches you'll ever see! Drinks: I had to give them they're own private section because they really are worth mentioning! A few favs come from the specialty cocktail menu. For those of you wanting just the right amount of flavor and not too strong, try the peared sake and toasted ginger snap. If you have more of a sweet tooth, try the go go berry!

Billy Dec, the owner and visionaire of Sunda, has created a masterpiece of Chicago.  I have had many dinners at Sunda with close friends, always dining omakase (at the mercy of the exec. chef, a personal friend of one of my friends). I recommend anything here, however, my go-to dish is the assortment of fine tuna sashimi with a side of sweet rice and spicy mayo.  the pancit - is new and uniquely crafted in an immersion of east-meets-west with the new, modern fused with the traditional world of the Philippines. The roasted duck is more than delightful and the best roll by far is the Number 10 roll.  Sunda also boasts to have a very rare sake. After drinking this particular Sake, i am no longer drinking anything else. Sunda is the only restaurant in the US to be able to serve and carry this particular brand, and it is well worth the price. By the bottle, Tyku is $250. It is sweet and refreshing, with a very subtle and mild aftertaste of the Super Premium Junmai Ginjo sake. Tyku is an award-winning sake and is definitely a fine-drink that needs to be tried. Always on hand- and always chilled to perfection, the perfect combination of the Tuna sashimi platter, number 10 roll, roasted duck, and a bottle of Tyku harmoniously creates a beautiful marriage for a great meal.  Sunda is one of the top-sought-after restaurants at the moment in Chicago, where celebs such as Jeremy Piven can be seen dining here, next to you on a regular basis, so when dining on a hot night - thurs.fri.sat, dining at a table is only available by reservation.

They have sushi, noodle dishes, and innovative salads that make it easy to try and share. The rock shrimp, blue crab noodle dish, crab cake sashimi are fantastic.

2009-07-29,3.0,"Billy Dec's new spot and already extremely successful after being behind Rockit Bar & Grill and The Underground. The restaurant's name is a nod to the Sunda Shelf, a Southest Asian landmass, and incorporates modern takes on dishes from throughout the region. A large chunk of the lineup is devoted to China and Japan, but fare from other countries, including Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand, makes an appearance too. There are new Asian dishes such as Malay-style Chilean sea bass, crab-crusted ahi tuna with Japanese hot mustard-soy glaze, pork shank confit with garlic-foie gras gravy and watercress salad, and a couple of Asian-inspired noodle dishes. There's also a full sushi bar. The establishment is divided into 3 dining areas: a long communal seating area next to the sushi bar is first come-first serve, the seats in this area are back-less and not very comfortable for extended dining; the bar area is in the front and seats are relaxed with plush cushions and there are couches to relax on whilst setting your amuse-bouche on low, wooden, southeast asian coffee tables; the true dining area is set along the back wall of the interior, the seating is relaxed and are partitioned with Taoist and Buddhist accents.  The decor is the high point.",0.9327,0.877,0.093,0.03,0.3708908452658452

The food was poor to say the least and my table of six sent back sushi that was not fresh as well as barely nibbled on each plate that was brought out. Our wine glasses were left empty many times and our waiter was no where in sight to refill throughout dinner. (we had to have a server locate our wine so we could pour ourselves.) It took over 30 minutes to get our initial round of drinks and when it was time to pay the bill, our waiter had disappeared and we eventually had to ask a manager for the check. The restaurant was extremely loud - since the sound bounces off the walls at Sunda, the least they could do is skip the loud music. Even at a round table, it was extremely hard to hear and had to repeat conversations over and over. And the topper was when they misplaced a credit card of ours and come to find today, had double charged one of our guests.

The visit started out with complete awe at the phenomenal interior/decor. Well done, Tony Chi, well done! There's a mixture of communal tables (which seems to be the trend all over town), round tables, couple seating, and a beautiful bar. Now add in the sexy, intimate lighting along with the well-dressed crowd. This is my kind of place!  Sure, they know how to decorate, but can they execute Asian food correctly? Most definitely!  The duck bao buns were fantastic! I thought the oxtail potstickers could use a little more flavor, but nonetheless were good. I loved their take on toast and jam. How could you not love anything fried that's paired with sushi? In fact, the couple next to us asked what it was called because it looked so good.  Having read some negative reviews on the sushi, I was yet again skeptical. However, the Number Nine roll that we ordered was really good! The portion was also pretty big. I'd skip the ridiculous dessert next time.  The food rolled out a bit slowly, but the service itself was great. I love the fact that every waiter/busser rocks a pair of converse sneakers!

My dad and I ordered the sake, my mom had a japanese beer (in a large bottle, so that I could also enjoy some sips, much to my delight). We ended up ordering appetizers, which were large enough that even my dad's  stomach ended up being satisfied. I will definitely be back, if only to sample more of the cocktails, which looked very inventive, and different sushi rolls.

The california roll had itty bitty pieces of avocado. I was a little disappointed in that. The entree was great though. The sea bass in my dish was very tender. The curry was not as creamy as I usually have for curry dishes. But you could tell it was made from scratch and original. They had put a lot of ginger in the curry to give it some kick. Definitely very healthy and good for digestion!  The katsu dish my friend had was very good as well. Crispy and nicely fried, and the chicken was tender.

Makes me wonder what kind of food Billy's getting into back on the homestead at his very own Rockit Ranch! But I digress-- so I finally made plans to check out Sunda for lunch knowing how tough it is to get a dinner reservation right now (actually, for the next couple of months). Upon entering, the modern yet incandescent interior conjured up NoMI-- and no surprise, considering New York design aesthete Tony Chi decorated both. His firm belief in the 'invisible design' philosophy is wholly evident at Sunda as everything ebbs and flows with a gentle energy... almost making it look easy, yet so smart. Looking over the menu, I was very pleased with the extensive lunch options. Some of us make lunch the largest meal of the day and appreciate a dinner-sized menu! I started with miso soup (perfect-- mild but still flavorful) and moved on to the Southeastern Chop Chop chicken salad. I love chopped salads and this one hit the green spot-- a huge portion with napa, mango, peanut, mixed with a slightly sweet jalapeño dressing.  My colleague chose Sunda's signature dish-- crispy, pan-fried then soy-glazed rice topped with spicy tuna and jalepeño. Judging by the smiles and swoons, this crispy rice is worthy of all the hype. We also tried a roll on special-- the Summer Roll-- and deemed this our favorite. Escolar, tuna, avocado, cilantro and a zippy sauce distinguished it from a typical summer roll-- light, fresh, just lovely! Our service was attentive and we felt free to linger a while longer. A lunch designed with summer wanderlust in mind... ahhhh. Between the delicious, artfully-plated food, zen decor and aim-to-please staff, I predict Sunda will become a tenacious rockstar in the realm of Asian Fusion.",0.995,0.821,0.171,0.008,0.6181818181818182

Once seated, the dining area wasn't very crowded despite my impression that they would be fully booked.  I'm not sure if that means that OpenTable underestimates the number of open tables or if that means that they have reservations that they take through other means.  We were immediately greeted by our server, who was SUPER nice, attentive and very accommodating.  Service is great here.   As for the food, we were given a complimentary salad, which was pretty meh.  It was pretty bland and could have used more acidity.  But the rest of our food was really good.  We had the tuna sticky rice as an appetizer and I had the Malay style chilean sea bass while my boyfriend ate the Adobo pork belly.  The tuna sticky rice is interesting and was very flavorful.  The only downside is that you may wish you had a toothpick to..uhh..extract the sticky rice from your molars.  My sea bass was SO good and I could definitely taste the various herbs.  I also really like the cauliflower puree that came with it, and I usually do not like cauliflower.  My boyfriend also really enjoyed his pork belly dish, which he said was ""a little salty but very tasty."" I also really enjoyed my lychee petals cocktail, which was a bit pricy but a refreshing treat.  I would definitely come here again and try something else, perhaps the sushi.   By the time we were ready to leave, the dining room was probably 60-70% full.  Since other diners had joined us, it was a bit crowded seeming as I was seated on a long bench that spanned numerous tables.

I was expecting some magical for all the hype it's gotten and the prices. We started with the Indo corn fritters and garlic noodles. The Garlic noodles were good and a fair portion, but the indo corn fritters were nothing amazing. I would definitely get the corn cakes from the cheesecake factory over these fried things.  I had the long ribs and my husband had some crispy pork thing that the waiter recommended. My long rib was tasty, but there was so much fat on it that I got about 5 bites.

The waiter was nice, but had offered to buy our drinks if I could name my wine (which my husband had ordered as a surprise). I took one drink and told him exactly what it was. He just stood there dumbfounded and seemed worried about how to get us our drinks gratis the rest of the meal. Finally he said he would comp our dessert (just one to share)...it didn't quite equal the $20 we spent on our drinks. I also had to ask for ice in my water about 5 times because he kept forgetting.

Next the food and drinks were mediocre.  They had fancy names and descriptions with fancy plating and glasses but the actual taste of everything was not impressive.  I ordered a drink with citrus vodka and melon and it was weak and very light.  The sushi we ordered (split the sunda special roll and the spicy tako roll with one of my girlfriends) was just your typical sushi, nothing special at all, but we paid a very high premium.  My GF and I were still hungry after the rolls (we didn't want to be stuffed for a night of drinking but needed some carbs) so we ordered their duck breast steam bao, which was actually really good (think peking duck in a steamed bun) compared to everything else. But the bao didnt taste freshly made either though.  And note that it took us many tries before we could get our waitress back so we could order the bao.  Other girls tried different items but no one was really impressed.  One had the chicken entree, which smelled delicous but it ended up being bland and dry chicken breast (and it took forever for the waitress to bring extra sauce for the chicken.. by the time it came, the chicken got cold).  Then there was a big hassle with our check (we had a big group and we tried to keep it simple with mostly cash and then just a few credit cards, which the waitress agreed wouldnt be an issue) but when it came back i was charged an extra 20% gratuity on my card (when they already had included 20% gratuity)!!    I guess the general population that goes (its a very posh place where everyones decked out) might not notice an extra $40 bucks charged on their card but I would granted I was already unhappy with the price I had to pay for mediocre drinks and food.

2009-05-27,4.0,"Oh, if there was a meal to induce a Yelp review, the dinner date I had at Sunda last night would be it. Everything comes out family style, like a true Asian spot, which was great because we got to try everything together. Like so many Chitown sushi spots, Sunda's ""signature rolls"" aren't all that signature...but their salads are where they shine. Some brilliant dishes are hidden in this otherwise stereotypically boring category. For example, the duck hash salad was a perfect harmony of European and Chinese classics. Daikon or radish cake is a favorite found at dimsum - toss that in with the duck as the ""lardon"" with frisee, and you've got something completely inspired. Also impressively novel was their unagi / watermelon ""nigiri"" - blocks of watermelon served as rice. Portion size is a little disappointing, but let's be honest, you're in River North, not the suburbs - it's no surprise when the kitchen foregoes quantity for quality. We tackled the hamachi jalapeno sashimi and the scorpion roll, both of which were decent. The servers accidentally brought us the Number 10 roll, which we were then told to enjoy on the house. By that time in the night, we were both super full and it is an incredibly rich roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese, all deep fried...you get the picture), so unfortunately we didn't take full advantage. When we hit the dessert list, we loved the pudding (raspberry lychee, guava vanilla, even taro coconut...what's not to like?). However, we were sorely disappointed by the ""Ridiculous"". I've had tempura ice cream back in LA, and was hoping for something similar. The ""tempura"" was all wrong on this, and the carrot cake was terrible. The only thing we ended up eating on that dish was the ice cream. As for the drink list, they've got a decent list of fruity martinis, which clearly caters to their target demographic of 20 and 30 something females. I went against the grain and had a dry petite syrah, which was perfect for my mood. Next time though, I'm hitting up that martini list... Even though Sunda's been open for a few months now, it's still fairly busy. I had to call and drop a friend's name to get on the list at 8 pm, and even then, they booked us for the wrong day. We ended up sitting at the wooden tables between the sushi bar and the lounge, which was fine. It was actually fairly reminiscent of Avec, except at Avec at least you have hooks under the table to hang your purse/jacket. And Avec's cultivated and maintained a serious reputation in this city for great food/service. Sunda's got a while to go before it gets there. I just hope it doesn't turn into another Sushi Samba, or else this city is seriously going in the wrong direction.",0.9853,0.777,0.141,0.082,0.5913333333333334

He was actually attentive to our needs: wanting to order food & drinks at a restaurant. Cocktails were good, I'll give 'em that much.

Sunda is already an impeccably put together, well-oiled machine.  Mother's Day dinner here was sumptuous, stylish, tasty and fun. If you can't tell already, we were impressed. From personal interaction with the fabulous Chef, Rodelio (also a fellow Los Angeleno and prior chef at Koi), to our adorable server Daniel who was both sweet as sugar and smart as a whip, to the food that was as much as a standout as the phenomenal décor, it's a total package experience.  Expect clean, modern lines with Oriental influence... understated elegance, contemporary layout, sleek soft lighting, an amazing art installation of white branches over the sushi bar... Mmmm, perfect... after all, your surroundings should look as good as you do, right? I did have a small issue though feeling that their tables were a tad short. Keeping in mind I'm no LeBron James here, I *should* be able to cross my legs under the table without my knees resting on it's underside.

Not to be missed.  + Buddha's Classic Crispy Rice - OMFG! Pan fried and soy glazed rice topped with an option of smatterings (tuna tartare, kobe beef, shrimp). One of the most amazing dishes I've ever had, we even ordered a second round!! Go for the tuna, you won't be disappointed.  + Filet Mignon Tobanyaki - Pickled Wasabi? Never had it? You're missing out. It makes this dish utterly impeccable.  There were also a few items like the Ultimate Handroll and Lemongrass Beef Lollipops which fell a bit flat for us and the banana fritter dessert didn't wow either. Were they horrible?

We had a 7:30pm reservation and weren't seated until 8pm but it didn't really matter so much to us. The hosts were VERY attentive and apologized profusely, checking in with us everytime that they walked by. Quality service was noted. Standing by the entry for 30 minutes did give us a chance to get a good look around and we were both excited to see Chicago local Top Chef contestant Radhika dining there as well. If it's good enough for a Top Chef contestant... shoot... Anyhow, once were seated we realized that the quality service extended to the servers and the bus-boys (though I don't know if that was their proper role or not). Everything was explained, suggestions were offered immediately, all questions were answered honestly and accurately, it was very impressive.  Now my friend LOATHES seafood so therefore Sushi was not an option for her, but that didn't prevent her from finding some food that she very much enjoyed. We started with the Lemongrass Beef Lollipops (recommended by a friend and frequent diner) and they were AWESOME, then she followed up with the Thai Fried Chicken which was really, really delicious.

2009-04-15,2.0,"I'm the first real person to review this restaurant, yeah! Some faint praise: I think pan-asian, by its inherent nature, is mostly awful; this was not. It was not memorable, but probably better than it really has to be. At least this year. The room, as I'm sure someone above noted, is very pretty: black, lacquered wood, etc. I suppose it can best be surmised as capturing the feel of the signature restaurant in an expensive boutique hotel--that is, it looked like a large investment firm plopped $6-7 million into it as a loss leader to burnish an image. Except it's a stand alone venture. And one supposes the layout, naturally set up so that you can leer at other people poking at their food (while staring back at you, of course), encourages you to linger and quaff a few more $14 cocktails. Can't knock the hustle. Service is mechanical but efficient. Heavily staffed, but stiff. They served an amuse of fried duck skin and some marinated cabbage. I could say this had nothing on Sun Wah but the real problem is that it pretty much had nothing: some cracklins and some ribbons of cabbage. Very prescient of what was to come. Our waitress suggested we pick one or two things from every category; there were at least six categories. Good one. We went with a salad, an appetizer, a noodle dish, and split an entree; we took home leftovers. We had: 1) Salad:burnt watermelon and unagi ""nigiri"" (chili-caramelized watermelon, peppercress, unagi ""bacon"", mango, lime)--there were five ""pieces"" for $14. Not offensive in the least; entirely forgettable in a heartbeat. The unagi was grilled and very lightly soaked in a surprisingly not-too sweet sauce, thankfully; I suppose it's called ""bacon"" because of how thinly sliced it was. The watermelon was neither caramelized or chili-ized; the citrus fruits were non-existent; the peppercress was merely garnish. I ordered this dish because of nod--intentional or not--to the picked watermelon and pork belly dish at Fatty Crab in NYC, a dish I think is one of the more seminal plates of this decade of American dining. There, the fatty niblets of pork mirror the texture of the fruit, and the sweet and tartness of these two ingredients, respectfully, intermingles in a playful and delicious manner. Here, while certainly playful, the joy was lacking: the eel was a bit mushy and the watermelon was a lukewarm thud, with no crispness or snap; because neither had been given a resolute flavor profile, it was like eating two slightly adverse textures. Eaten, but with a sigh. 2) Hot Appetizer: ""Toast and Jam""--shrimp toasts and a ramekin of spicy tuna tataki. This may be the most clever dish of 2009 not served at an Alinea-class restaurant, even if it did only comprise two components. Somewhat fun to eat, simple flavor profile, well executed. Dish could probably be improved by giving the tataki a more robust flavor profile than simply one-note spicy, but it's rare to find anyone doing the rare tuna dish in an interesting fashion. Stingy on the toasts. $14 3) Noodles: ""hong kong style crispy noodles--double fried with brown sauce char siu pork, prawns, asian vegetables."" Pedestrian and (obviously) nowhere near the level of your favorite noodles at _____ (insert Sun Wah, Katy's, LTH, etc.); when viewed in context of the P-A genre and Sunda itself, pretty good. Asian vegetables = bok choy. Who knows if the pork really was ""char siu-d."" Brown sauce was nicely balanced and not over-salted. $14. 4) Entree: ""crispy pata--confit pork shank with garlic-foie gravy, pea shoots."" Warning: Objects may appear less delicious than they appear. From looks alone, this would seem to merit a best-of-the-year mention: the dish comes out with a whole pig's foot stood up on end a AND FRIED, with extraneous green stuff surrounding it. Alas, the pork is not up to snuff in the slightest, and the meat's done-ness was not consistent; there was a cafeteria quality to it. The foie gravy was a bad, bad idea: it was reduced to a pasty, sambal-like thickness, thereby robbing it off its transcendent texture and fattiness; it didn't add anything to the foot. Incidentally, the garlic aspect was served as a separate vinaigrette, which ended up working very nicely for the suprise of the dish: those extraneous greens, watercress actually, were very nice. $22 Desserts are clearly an afterthought: gussied-up cookies, banana fritters, mochi, etc. My guess is that Sunda will pull a Mercat and stick to the same menu for the foreseeable future.

My sister had the Go Go Berry cocktail which was perfectly delicious as well.  Once we were seated, the service was attentive...maybe a little too attentive. Between the bus boys and the waiter, you are never left with a half filled cup of water or moment alone! We ordered the beef lollipops appetizer which came out as the Kobe beef crispy rice (which, by the way was delicious) - the waiter comped the incorrect app but let us eat our hearts out so we weren't too disappointed. The table ordered the sea bass, Wa Machi Rolls, Firecracker, Spicy Tail of Two Tunas, and Yellowtail roll - everything was perfect and delicious. The Sea Bass preparation was very unique! Because of the mistake of our appetizer course, the waiter kindly comped another round of drinks and desert - ""the Ridiculous"" which was, as the name suggestions, ""Ridiculous"" - delicious creamy vanilla ice cream surrounded by carrot cake shell with carmel glaze. Simply just WRONG and fantastic at the same time.  To conclude while the restaurant has growing pains, I truly think this will be a staple trendy spot for all to enjoy - perfect for girls or guys nights out with the communal seating at some of the tables.",0.9961,0.705,0.237,0.057,0.6947544642857142

The decor, drinks, food were all REALLY great. Starting out with cocktails, we tried the lychee martini,  the kung pao mango, the pear sake and the wasabi h20, they were all well made and amazing.  I will come back to the bar just for a drink for happy hour. On to the food, our group shared 4 rolls and a bunch of appetizers.  Everything was insane.  Again,cant choose a favorite.  Very tasty and different, not your typical Asian fare at all.  The toast and jam was really good, and all of the sushi we had was top.  We also sat at a great table away from the rest of the restaurant sort of ""In"" the sushi bar.   For dessert we split the ""Ridiculous,""  it is its name, just get it. We met the head chef and head sushi chef, both very talented and the nicest guys ever. The only thing that failed  was our server.  He seemed like he didnt really know what he was doing and we barely saw him throughout the meal.  Then, at the end of the meal, he overcharged out credit card by $15 each and lost one of the credit cards in our group.  Not a fun way to end the meal.  Another note, it's PRICEY.  Our was $80 a head for 6 people.  But overall, SO good, will return. 6-24  Im editing this because Ive been back to Sunda 3 or 4 times since my last review.  It's not the best, it's just ok.  Still a fun scene.",0.9943,0.744,0.207,0.049,0.5312611408199645

Kind of like your neighbor who you secretly believe to be a serial killer, or the guy who may or may not have recently had a nose job. In Sunda's case, I can't put my finger on exactly what it is. It may have to do with how you can't tell where the bar ends and dining tables begin. Or maybe it's the cooky mirrored effect in the back. It all adds up to it not quite delivering on the club-esque, Sushi Samba affect it's looking for. The crowd is the same as Underground. But instead of observing them in their cave at 2am, you now get the treat of seeing them in Sunda's sobering light.

Most of the crew got there at 9, but my boo and I were running behind and got there about quarter after, only to be told our table wasn't yet ready.  After another 20 mins of waiting, they offered us a free drink, and while my friends indulged in some of the specialty cocktails (the vote: the peared sake was the best, followed closely by the lychee cocktail)  I was shocked, nay, offended that they did not have Ketel One for my standard drink, but substituted Chopin and all was well.   Fast forward to 10:15 and we finally get seated.   We're all hungry and somewhat irritable but lo and behold, Sunda brings us right back to good spirits with free appetizers (shrimp chips? decent but forgettable, beef lollipops-does anyone else see a sexual innuendo in there? good nonetheless, but I don't love beef, and rock shrimp tempura-DELICIOUS and pretty well sized). The premise of the place is that things come out as they are ready, which is pretty ballsy for a trendy, billy dec, asian fusion restaurant, but since everyone was served within 5 mins of one another, it really wasn't bothersome.  My date and I shared a bunch of stuff like the fat kids we wish we could be: -crab cake encrusted ahi tuna sashimi ( i was too full to enjoy this ) -truffled tataki (salmon, beef, tuna) sashimi (TO DIE FOR) -super white tuna sashimi (also delicious, a little difficult to eat) and two others I cant recall at the moment......

The fish is incredibly fresh and the meats are tender and full of flavor.  We tried numerous small dishes including the Lemongrass Beef Lollypops (amazing!), two orders of the crispy rice with spicy tuna, and one of the most amazing nigiri dishes I've ever had....two pieces of escolar (white tuna) wrapped around rice with a thin potato chip on top with a bit of black truffle shavings.  Oh, and how can I not mention the seared tuna crusted with crab cake.  I took a double take when I saw this on the menu, but the two distinct tastes work perfectly together.  I think the mustard that fuses the crab cake to the tuna really helps the two fish flavors coexist beautifully.

Came with mashed potatoes and beans. We also ordered a tempura hand roll - I think it was called 'no you didn't' or something like that. Also good. The bao bun appetizer was good, but not what I expected. I was thinking it was going to be the traditional bao, with the pork and 'soup' in the middle, self-contained.

2009-03-06,5.0,"Second day of 'regular' opening and everything went like clockwork.  We were in good hands and everyone appeared to know what they were doing and did it well.  The place is beautiful, the bar area charming--sitting low by the windows on Illinois.  The restaurant while having some potential for noisy was just fantastic with a lot of interesting spaces at the bar, at the long tables, at the sushi bar and other we did not explore. But go for the food.  The crab roll slightly warm and crunchy with REAL crab meat melted in your mouth (well, ours).  The black cod, one of my favorites, was perfectly seasoned and also perfectly cooked.  Our wait person, Sarah, insisted we try a dessert which we rarely do and the banana fritters (I don't know what they are called on the menu--they just appeared) with crunchy coconut coating and a berry dip and think whipped cream on the side made us every happier than we had been! The mixed drinks.  I had one with mango in it and was concerned it would be too sweet.  So the bartender made it less sweet and not only the liquid really fabulous, but the chili--sesame coating on the glass made me swoon. This is absolutely going to be the 'in' place--and I hope the prices stay as reasonable as we found them to be.",0.9751,0.852,0.136,0.012,0.5729967948717949
2009-03-04,4.0,"This place is brand new, but already represents a trendy, fun and delicious Asian restaurant for the area. The food influences span cuisines from all over Asia. The space is well done, lots of different areas to choose from to sit. Sushi bar, community tables, regular tables, the bar, and the lounge.  I sat in the lounge. Service was great, quick and knowedgable. The soup dumplings, duck bao buns, sea bass, spicy tuna 2 ways, and other items I tried all were prepared well and tasted even better. Great drink list too, from beers, sakes, cocktail list etc. The desserts are unreal. Try the ""Ridiculous"" - enough said! This place is going to do real well, and everyone should try it. It is going to be packed at all times I feel.  Oh, lastly, don't forget to order the sticky rice!",0.9899,0.761,0.23,0.009,0.4984197175373647
2009-03-02,5.0,"Although it wasn't officially opened yet...I had the pleasure of attending one of Sunda's advance tastings.  The food, decor and service were all amazing and some of the best I have had in Chicago.  The menu has a wide variety with a little something for everyone.  From creative Asian appetizers to full dinners, sushi to Asian inspired cocktails, everything was tasty and exceeded my high expectations.   I especially recommend the lemongrass beef lollipops, steamed bao buns, crispy shirmp toast with tuna jam and the Food Buddah's classic crispy rice with Kobe Beef or spicy tuna on top.  A special shout out to the #10 sushi roll - I don't know what's in it but it was one of the best tasting things I've ever had. I'm sure this place will be crowded once it opens but it is well worth the wait!",0.9763,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.4823115079365079
