We were super-curious about the speak-easy in the basement. We made our way through a nice enough bar/restaurant and found a staircase. At the bottom of the stairs waiting a gentleman standing by a bookcase. He took your party number, gave you the approximate wait time and you stand on the stairs and wait.... but then.... but then he magically turns around, opens the bookcase - BAM - the speak-easy is hidden behind a bookcase! HOW COOL IS THIS?!?! We were escorted in pretty quickly, agreeing to stand in the back until a table became available... our entire wait time was a whole 10 minutes.... totally fine. We got a GREAT table at the front of the bar, nearer the stage... oddly, they have 1950s soft-core porn playing... quite odd, but hey, gay-or-not, I'll roll with it! It was quite entertaining but then... the top of the hour arrived... the curtain flies open, the music starts playing, the lights illuminate the stage and there is a burlesque dancer on stage! Yes... a live burlesque dancer! AND SHE WAS AWESOME! Quite the show... only lasted about 10 minutes but my jaw was on the floor! OH WAIT - drinks? You're probably wanting to know how the drinks were? FABULOUS - DUH! This placed earned every single star! It was such a hoot - now, to be fair... I can only account for the first drink or two... I may have lost count that night - totally worth it!

2015-11-03,4.0,"An historic post-Fire building, easily identified by a large sign overhanging Orleans Street; and, yes, the door is green.  The interior is a large dark room (rather brighter in a dining area overlooking Huron Street), walls covered with advertising signs and other memorabilia.  Lovely old back-bar, partly obscured by decorative clutter.  Comfy wooden swiveling barstools with backs and arms.  Full bar.  Three TVs, pool table.  Restrooms down 14 steps, not accessible.  The men's room looks relatively clean, but is smelly. I probably wouldn't recommend a place so saloon-ish for children (good heavens, am I turning into a crypto-Dry?), but, to my surprise, there was a large family party having a good time in the dining area. Three blocks from the Chicago Avenue station on the Brown and Purple Express Lines.  One block closer to the station's Superior Street entrance, which, however, has no elevator.  About a mile from Rock Bottom, one-half mile from Clark Street Ale House. Very respectable menu of craft brews and imports.  I tried a fixed flight of four draft samples at $11: - Coronado Brewing Co., Coronado, CA.  Orange Avenue Wit, 5.2%.  Clear gold, with a light head fading to halo.  Virtually no nose.  Bright, low-IBU taste, with an orange and antihistamine taste, and a bit of bitterness expressed only in the fade.  Refreshing; this would make a good summer beer. - Metropolitan Brewing Co., Chicago, IL.  Magnetron Schwarzbier, 5.5%.  Fairly clear dark brown with orange-red highlights.  Light head.  Roast malt nose, with a slight ""summer sausage"" note.  Classic Schwarzbier roast malt taste all the way down. - Surly Brewing Co., Chicago, IL.  Coffee Bender Brown Ale, 5.1%.  Slightly cloudy root beer color with orange highlights; light but enduring head.  Coffee is present in the nose, but to me the dominant note in both nose and taste is cigarette tobacco. - Solemn Oath Brewing Co., Naperville, IL.  Punk Rock for Rick Kids Belgian Pale Ale.  Also reviewed under First Draft.  Copper-gold, light head.  Hint of ""fruit cocktail"" in nose.  Light and sweet taste, again with a fruit cocktail note, and some out-of-balance bitterness in the fade. In addition to the four-draft sampler, I tried a pint of: - Ballast Point Brewing Co., San Diego, CA.  Ballast Point Pumpkin Down Scottish Ale with Pumpkin.  5.8%.  Clear red-brown, almost no head.  Weak malt nose.  Sweet malt Scottish ale taste, with only slight pumpkin or pumpkin pie spice character, though this seemed to grow with continued tasting.  Flavor is sweet malt all the way down.  Doesn't really work very well either as a Scottish ale or a pumpkin seasonal.",0.9893,0.795,0.14,0.065,0.4715920634920633

2014-08-18,1.0,"An utter disappointment, and let me tell you why. I created this account just to come here and say this. The place is an old Speakeasy. That's their one claim to fame, and let me tell you, they really up sell on this point to generate attraction. That's why we were there. We asked if the area was accessible. It turns out it's only available as a space for rent, and you can only see it if the owner is around and you ask. Really? That space, which is your single largest attraction, and could increase seating capacity in that otherwise cluttered and tight space. But it's off limits. Ok, I'm sad but fine, I can understand, sort of, I guess. I ordered Talisker on rocks. A standard pour is 1.5 oz of spirits. WHAT I GOT was 2 oz of ice water that was Talisker flavored for $16. They under poured the drink and didn't serve what I ordered. If I wanted water, I would have asked for water. They essentially served everyone at the table water that night, unless they ordered beer. If they did a standard pour, a single bottle of Talisker 10 year retails for $48. 750ml / 1.5oz = ~17 pours * $16 = $272 - $48 = ~$224 profit per bottle. They poured 0.5oz which means they're making ~50 third-pours * $16 bla bla bla = $752 profit per bottle. What I'm trying to say is their under pour is a scam and markup is unreasonable. Based on what their menu said about what is in their poutine, my fiancee ordered some for the table. What they didn't list on the menu was that it ALSO contains hot giardiniera, and consequently is spicy. Now, I like spicy food and didn't even notice, but for everyone else at the table, it was essentially inedible. So, don't go for the sights, you won't see them, don't go for the drinks, you'll get water, and don't go for the food, because it won't be what they advertise. Sorry, guys; if anyone at the Green Door is reading this, I'm forced to tell everyone in my social circle and my colleagues this story and warn them to avoid the place.

Old school modern bar/tavern in River North                         -When to have it?           I've been wanting to try this place ever since I moved into my apartment (I live two blocks away), however, that was 2 years ago and I just tried it for the first time! I wish I tried it sooner, but I know I will be back. Since my boyfriend and I were in a rush, we decided to pick up instead of dine there.            If you are in the mood for a good burger or just standard delicious American food, Green Door Tavern would be your pick. Reasonable prices and a huge selection of beer.   * Service:   Since I have not had the pleasure of dining there yet, I can't say much about the service. However, when I called to place a pick up order, the man was very friendly and said our food would be ready in 15 minutes.  That's what I'm talking about!                -Did the service ""Help, Hurt or Neutral""?                   Neutral * Food Since one of my boyfriend's friends said their burgers were one of the best he's ever had, I knew I had to get one.  I settled on the ""Feature"" burger with pepper jack, griddled onion, and guacamole.  The burger was juicy and cooked medium well (just as I asked) perfectly.  I loved the guacamole on it since it gave it a spice and I didn't even need much ketchup with it.  As a side, I swapped fries for their chow chun broccoli, which was asian style broccoli with peanuts--spicy, crispy, and tangy! I would definitely order this whole meal again.                                    I give it 4/5 NOM NOMS                      Overall Grade:  B+.  Next time I want to eat there and try their blackened chicken wrap.",0.9926,0.801,0.166,0.032,0.37199999999999994

We found a table in an otherwise deserted area of the bar.  My partner's drink was obviously about 95% cranberry juice and the sweetness was getting to him.  We, being brainiacs, decided to combine my vodka tonic and his vodka cran.  We made a little mess on my grandma's table cloth and within minutes the nicest lady came by with a dry towel and wiped it down for us.  Nice touch!

2014-03-08,3.0,"Living in River North for the past 10 years, I had found a comforting bar spot in the Green Door Tavern.  Last year I moved, still in the area, but a bit farther out, so I hadn't been to the Green Door in about a year.  A few nights ago, I was jonesin' for some bar grub, so I walked up Orleans to grab a bite at the GDT and was met with a pretty big surprise - a completely revamped menu.   Which, I'll admit, I was immediately skeptical and disappointed about.  The GDT has been around since 1921, making it one of the oldest bars in Chicago - really, the bar was actually built as a grocery store in 1872 right after the fire, but was opened up as a ""restaurant"" in 1921, operating as a speakeasy until prohibition was repealed in 1933.  The bar is decorated with trinkets and signs from the bar's history and some real interesting old school pictures.  In the basement is the door to the building's old school speakeasy, which you can rent for private parties.  Enough history, though, on to the food.   Formerly, the food at the GDT was pretty standard bar grub - wings, the typical apps, burgers with your choice of toppings (they had a few menu options but they were pretty standard - a black and blue, a bbq burger - something along those lines).   So I was pretty shocked when our waitress put down the new menu - the new menu reads like gastropub fare with a bit of ethnic flair.  Scotch eggs and scrumpets as appetizers, Korean influenced ""Lawrence Avenue Wings"" and a pork belly slider with kimchi and watermelon, and an interesting selection of fries - poutine fries, chili cheddar fries, and Saratoga chips.   Now usually I'm not a purist and can accept change when it comes, but I'll admit I was a little skeptical when I first looked at the new menu.  If anything, I guess I felt like if any place should stick to tradition, it should be this place - but I guess I use the word ""tradition"" loosely, because I have no idea what the menu was like in 2002, let alone in 1930....ha. But I came for a burger and some wings, so that's what I ordered.... Not really the buffalo I was looking for, but the Lawrence Avenue Wings sufficed - good size wings, marinated in a spicy Korean sauce reminiscent of Kam Pong Gi - spicy sweet Korean chicken wings.  These had a barbecue sweetness to it with just a hint of spice and a gentle crisp to the skin.   The burger choices were also a bit more adventurous than before, with ingredients that are in line with the new gastro-pub theme, but they're nothing overly ambitious.  In the end, what's important is still here - they're still a solid 1/2 lb, and they still brand the buns - a pretzel-style roll, with the ""GDT"" initials - a nice touch.  And the burgers are still accompanied by side of crinkle-cut fries that are just lightly salted. My fiancee went with the bootlegger, a monster topped with applewood bacon, ketchup, and an overeasy egg that mostly kept its form with just a bit of runniness.   I went with the CH-CA-CO Burger, named after the ranch in Kentucky where they get the beef for the burger from.  For a few dollars premium, the beef from the ranch is grass-fed, antibiotic free, yadda-yadda - ethical yet, maybe a touch better.  In terms of the beef themselves, both burgers had minimal seasoning, but were well cooked.  This burger was topped with watercress of average freshness, a thick slice of bacon, and the ""GDT sauce"" which was a bit of a chipotle mayo.   Overall, I'm not a huge fan of the transformation of the GDT menu.  On the inside, the place is the same, and has the same neighborhood bar feel.  The price did take a small bump, but a hugely significant one.  The quality of the food isn't a whole lot better, which is to say it's not bad, but pretty standard bar grub.  Despite that, there's a sentimental spot in my heart for the GDT, and I will still keep coming back.

DO NOT GO HERE.  THE ""MANAGER"" MARY HAS MADE IT COMPLETELY CLEAR THAT MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS SPOT ON.   after what I had hoped was a one-time perfect storm of a bad bar experience, I was reluctantly convinced to go here again.

Inside you are surrounded by dark wood, populated with numerous items including a trombone, couple of airplanes, framed photographs, and lots of sports.  This haunting wood not only takes you back in time, but after a few beers you start to wonder if you are losing your balance because over the years the wooden walls are in fact leaning or sagging.  Kind of makes you feel like you are inside the belly of a ship, merrily drinking to cheer on the Cubs game.  I've decided this is the place I want to be whenever the Cubs actually win their second World Championship.  Highly recommended no matter what baseball team you like, for a great time camping around the stone fireplace in the corner, and enjoying the history of Chicago written (or mounted) on the walls.",0.9904,0.742,0.205,0.052,0.49944444444444447

So let me get to the experience.... Waitress was so busy that we didn't get menus for about 15 minutes, not to mention a beverage.  The waitress came back to take our order, but had forgotten yet to give us menus.  She apologized profusely, and then the drinks were about another 10-15 minutes.  We ordered, and the food was 'meh at best.  I guess they have recently started serving brunch, so they certainly have some kinks to work out.  The other tables around us had equally dismal experiences.  Long waits, and sub par food.  The table next to us sent one of their dishes back, and the Coke was flat for them too.   I think someone in leadership of this restaurant needs to step up.  It was like leaving two people to take care of a full restaurant with no additional help.  If you're going to do a huge Groupon promotion, you should staff up in anticipation of all of the redemption's.  I'm assuming you're trying to increase your business, not chase everyone out because the service is so sub-par.

I wasn't a fan of the sammich itself, though - three layers of regular ol' wheat bread is a little bland. They should really make it a regular (not three layer) sammich.

Honestly, why Irish? An interesting thing to do would just to deck out your place with obscure countries, sit back, and watch the confusion. Anyway, back to the bar.       I would have to note that the service was exceptional even on the day of the St. Patrick's day parade and post antics. Our server made sure our green beer flowed until we had enough while still maintaining the decency to let us pound our beers and mingle with the other patrons.        After a long day of drinking and still more to come we decided to take advantage of the kitchen. Orders of mini corndogs and chicken fingers sufficed for pure substance with sporadic moments of tastefulness. It's bar food people.

We talked to the waitress to see if we could get a look at the old speakeasy room, which is available for rent for private parties. There wasn't a party going on, and even though they were busy the bartender took us down there, unlocked the door, and let us look around.

2010-10-21,4.0,"I suppose my honorary citizen of Chicago card should not only be taken away, but should be burned in effigy and then Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart can escort me to my new residence in the 708 area code. Why? Because I've lived in Chicago for 20 years and have never once set foot in Green Door Tavern, until last night. What took me so long!? I have no idea ... especially when I have spent the better part of the last 20 years looking for Chicago's best cheeseburger (yes, CHEESEburger ... after all, when is the last time you had a hamburger that didn't actually have cheese on it? The mind boggles!) ... The only problem with my plan to find the perfect cheeseburger is that it was strictly in my head! I wasn't trolling around the city with a notebook trying every burger/fry/beer combination I could stomach, instead I was thinking ""I'll bet that diner/pub/bar/tavern has a good burger (not Good Burger)"" It's true that you would typically find me at Wildfire on a Wednesday, but the economy has hit my 3-martini-peppercorn-filet-cheddar-mashed-potatoes-lovin-self where it matters most: in my frequent-diner-wallet! The solution? Start treking for the perfect burger and leave it to my BFF to suggest Green Door Tavern. It was only the other week after a less-than-stellar experience at Nacional 27 across the street that I thought ""Maybe we should have gone to Green Door instead!"" I don't have to tell fans that this place is loaded with character and characters, TVs blaring sports, patrons blaring convos, quick and friendly service and darn good bar food. I had planned on getting myself a bleu cheese burger decked out with bacon and grilled onions, but then I saw ""Patty Melt"" on the menu ... my all-time favorite, but I really wanted the blue burger so I am waiting next time to try the Patty Melt. The burgers were definitely rare even though we ordered them medium, but rare burgers don't scare me that much ... I just know that most places will deliver a rare burger when it is ordered medium ... and a charred burger when it is ordered well. I know a place that meets that happy medium, but I'll save that for later. With nothing ""red"" on tap, I opted for a couple of Harp. The fries were PERFECTLY salty to me, though the crinkle cut is (oddly) the more difficult cut to fry to crisp while keeping the interior moist. There were also a TON of them and I couldn't finish them (I'll thank the 2 beers). My date had the Onion Frites burger that looked really delicious. Maybe on another visit I'll put the Onion Frites on the bleu burger! Yeah! In the end, I'll give major props to ambience and service, but Moody's Pub still has the best burger I've had in the last 20 years.

A guy from the kitchen brought out our food and we were never checked on after that. Edmund fitzgerald on tap and 312 specials so the beer selection made me happy. The BLT did not. It was sad. The bacon was overcooked and the avocado on it muted any other flavor except for the taste of too much lettuce. Fries looked like the frozen kind. Excellent pickle.

The Green Door is chock full of history and fantastic. The clientel were a mixed bunch of young professionals to people who seemed to be regulars. Not sketchy at all! Their drink specials were awesome and we wished we were there on Monday as they had beer specials. (They had $3 Well Drinks while we were there on Tuesday)  Their beer selection was awesome and prices were normal for a bar. It was $6 for a draft beer so we tried out their mixed drinks since they were the special. My girlfriend loves Bloody Marys and she said these were the best she's ever had at a bar. I had Whisky and Cokes and they were mixed pretty strong. Their bottled beer was reasonably priced. The ebst part was the atmosphere. For a Tuesday evening it wasn't packed and he bartender who started serving us earlier in the evening must have gotten off and sat down with us at the bar and talked and drank with us all night. It was a lot of fun. So if you're looking for a great place to have drinks that is easy to get to, about 2 minutes from the Brown Line, than this is the place for you!

It gives the place a good vibe and the feeling of a real old-fashioned pub. My order came on a round, foil-lined platter, though the burger seemed relatively small to the size of the serving dish. Honestly, it's a good burger with just the right amount of spice to it, but I would have expected a bigger serving for the price and the exaggerated platter size. Not a bad place but not spectacular either. Service was good and we were able to pay our tab quickly without waiting around for our waiter to bring it.

The Green door is like an old friend,  the first time I entered was about 1992,  I sat at the bar,  talked about the decline of the middle class with some guys who worked at Scalas roast Beef right down the street.  Dressed as a construction worker and drinking at a bar in a very nice neighborhood leads to very little conversation,  so I am normally left to my own devices,  but at The Green Door,  I feel more at home,  especially with the staff.   Beer prices are typical for the hood,  Tuesdays they have some very cheep apps,  I can't remember what,  but it was enough to carry me over. I am seriously running out of old school Chicago bars in the Loop, River North and other high rent districts,  for this reason alone I will give 4 stars.  If you want lots of bells and whistles,  there are plenty of other places for you,  it will leave more room at the bar for me.",0.9466,0.842,0.11,0.048,0.4632645502645502

This is believable, since you reach it through a nondescript door at the bottom of the stairs leading to the bathroom. There's another secret entrance, now littered with chairs, which leads upstairs, and a private alley entrance. The room is crammed with old photos and tchotchkes and advertising materials, such as the banner for the half-boy half-girl Japanese Wonder.

Our server was great too. She was very pleasant and very easy to chat with.  I got my burger, it was served with crinkled cute fries. One of my favorites, besides steak fries.

2007-05-09,4.0,"After watching a nice showing of 28 Weeks, with all the biting, clawing and blood puking, who wouldn't be in the mood for some nibblage?  My wise companion suggested we give the Green Door a shot.  As I stepped through the doors, I couldn't help but notice how the place is just a tad bit over-decorated with various vintage nick-nacks (think Sanford and Son with twice the junk).  The place was quite spacious with multiple sections for drinking, dining, and playing pool. The only section filled at the moment was the main bar area so we sat ourselves.  Our server (who seemed to be the only one working that night) promptly came to drop off our menus and take our drink orders.    We ended up gorging ourselves with a Waldorf salad (a bit too much lemon juice on the apple), crab cakes (yum), mini hot dogs with all the fixins (yummier), and a HOLY-CRAP-THAT'S-MONSTROUS 1/2lb grilled dog.  The roof of my mouth got cooked by the screaming hot (temperature, not spiciness) chili that came with the mini dogs.  I left the place so full I wanted to do a bit of puking myself.  4 stars for the dogs and 3 for the rest. Highlights of the bar: - Seems like neutral territory (Switzerland for Sox and Cubs fans) - Good service - Big place with plenty of seating - Clean john - Awesome hot dogs (dare I say near the top of my list for good dogs) All in all a darn tasty watering hole - 3.5 stars but rounded up since Yelp doesn't do halfsies.  I'll definitely be back once the skin in my mouth grows back for another round of dogs... maybe even the mini corn dogs.",0.9627,0.849,0.107,0.044,0.5413333333333332

Housed in an old historic building dating back to the days after the Chicago Fire, this building has been many things from a grocery store to a speakeasy.  They have at least 10 beers on tap and a menu to satisfy even the pickiest eater.  Yes- it's typical bar food with a couple of salads thrown in- but whadd'ya expect?  It's a bar!! We had a burger which was okay but the corned beef sandwich was better- juicy and warm- just perfect!!.  The fries were salty and the beer cold so all was right with my world.   I guess they do some type of improv downstairs in the Speakeasy area on Fridays nights so we will have to come back then to check it out. Nothing fancy but a good place to grab a bite to eat and a beer in a very causal environment.  And to think when we started out our evening, we were worried that we were not dressed well enough!",0.8933,0.878,0.088,0.034,0.4530357142857143
2007-04-03,3.0,"The Green Door is a decent place to go for yer standard bar fare. As you enter the place you a mildly reminded of cheesy chain restaurants that nail old relics to the walls to look ""interesting"" or ""authentic"". However, this place has a certain amount of charm over top of that dismal first impression. The relics are a bit more real than in most of those chains, they are doubly abundant... which makes it seem eccentric than contrived. The atmosphere in the main room is dim and a tad dank... which I love. When I go into a pub, bar, whatever... I like to feel like I am being transported out of the location that I just came out of and this place does a decent job of that... up until you go out onto the sunporch seating area. Anyhow, the food is decent... not great by any means, but decent for bar food. Pretty average menu to boot, ranging from burgers to wraps. They have a standard, if somewhat-wider-than-average selection of beers on tap... which is fine by me. Big points, on the other hand, for the presence of Maker's Mark... they also have a few other bourbons to boot. The service has been a bit inconsistent, I go here mostly at lunch during the business week and I would guess that once in every four times I go I have poor service. Lastly, they have a HORRIBLE selection of music. Very generic juke box, usually they are playing ten 100 type rockish music (i.e. - Stones (meh.), Dave Matthews (/vomit), Phish (grrr...)) or there is some HORRID contemporary chart-topper country on. There are few forms of music that grate on my nerves greater than contemporary chart-topper country. So if you are annoyed by horribly contrived, generic, grating, soulless ""music"" don't bother going here... I must admit that it is sometimes difficult for me to keep my lunch down when Keith Urban comes on the speaker system. *stumbles off to consume more bourbon*",-0.7263,0.812,0.094,0.094,0.45771864301276066

2007-03-20,4.0,"Went here the day before St. Patrick's Day because my friend was in an improv performance downstairs in the speakeasy.  She's part of the ""Just the Tip"" improv group. Pretty cool atmosphere down there, with a lot of history.  Luckily we were the first ones in the speakeasy because we were able to find a seat.  Latecomers had to stuff in the narrow hallway - Mental Note:  Good improv requires one to come early for good viewing. One drawback was that there wasn't any level of service down there.  We ordered our food & drinks from the bartender upstairs & a waitress brought it down, but that's as far as it went (also note: if you want to eat, come extra super early because there's just one bar area & if you don't sit there, you're having to put your food on your lap).  No waitstaff came down to take drink orders, so I had to be sure to ration my drink. It was a $5 donation, which was really a donation - ""Just the Tip"" donates its monies to a new charity each time they perform (plug for my friend: every 3rd Friday of the month), which is way cool.  This time, they donated it to a charity that has something to do with guide dogs for the blind.  Way cool. My Garden Burger sure was tasty (as were the seasoned fries that came with it) - can't forget to mention that.
