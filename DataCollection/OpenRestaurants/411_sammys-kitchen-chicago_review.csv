2017-05-14,5.0,"I'm always looking for off the beaten path places when I'm out of town and this one seemed like a good one and was I right, friggen nailed it today. This place is one of those hidden gems because it was filled with locals and everyone new everyone by name, I was the out sider today. It's right across the street from Midway airport at the end of a departing runway because planes were taking off right over my head every couple minutes. The place is small with limited counter seating and some tables which were almost completely full by the 8am hour when I left. The place is definitely a dive as you can tell by my pictures. The decor is almost nonexistent and it just looks thrown together but don't let that fool you. Service was spectacular with every employee working the front taking care of me the whole time that I was there. The menu was I can't remember because when saw ham on the bone which I'm a sucker for because I hate the processed roll crap that most everyone serves now, you had me at ham on the bone so I looked no further. As I sat there I saw big plates of breakfast passing by. OMG when the plate hit the table I was like WTF three eggs, mound of hash browns, thick ass piece of ham steak and thick Greek toast, holy cow all that for $6.50, is this for real ?. The hash browns were perfect with a soft pillow like inside with a nice crispy golden brown skin all mixed up. The ham was probably the thickest slice I have ever been served with a very juicy/tender texture and nice flavor, no heavy smoke. The eggs were perfect sunny side up and the toast was perfect Greek with that little chew to it from the crust. Overall for $7 flat out the door before tip this was probably the best bang for the buck breakfast that I have ever had and it was better than average quality which was top notch. This place definitely knocked it out of the park and worth all the five stars. They go way out of way for the breakfast ham and eggs and the best that I have ever had hands down, breakfast is my favorite meal so I eat and review it more than any other meal. I would highly recommend this dive place for breakfast. YouTube has a video I just found after posting my review. m.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ…",0.9925,0.769,0.161,0.07,0.49295066045066044

With how good the food is, you'd expect to pay more. You'll walk out with a full belly and a smile. Why? Because the food was great and the check did not hurt your daily budget.  Service is great.

2016-07-10,3.0,"At first glance, it's difficult to spot. I've lived in the midway area majority of my life and never even knew it was there! Parking is horrible. Price point is great, especially with the portions. The coffee wasn't the greatest, pretty much just brown water. The place itself looks a bit dirty and I have to wonder if the cook even uses gloves or proper hand washing. The fans and vents need some serious dusting, something I couldn't help but obsess about since they put them on full force whenever it is hot outside. They also do not have air conditioning. This is a popular law enforcement hang out, and is known to get pretty crowded mid-morning. They should look into expanding since their client base is growing. Service has always been great, it is family owned and they are very friendly, especially the handsome, very muscular son.  The ham and eggs is the best on the menu, next would be the Denver omelette. Something tasted musty when I first tried the chicken noodle soup, and the noodles pretty much melted in my mouth because of how overcooked they were.  If you need a meal that will fill up up under $10, this is the spot for you. Better carry out than dine-in.",0.9749,0.767,0.153,0.08,0.6614942528735632

You seat yourself and everybody was very welcoming. A big guy with lots of muscles took our order. I posted a pic of the menu bc I almost didn't believe the prices for the amount of food you get.

My husband at the pancakes and I had a bite. They were very good. The inlet was huge and they gave me more potatoes than I could eat in two sittings.

I came in after years of hearing how awesome this place was and how great it food tasted. My daughter and I were running errands, so we decided to stop in before they closed. We were there for lunch, and it was packed. The lot and dining area are small, which is fine. We found a seat near the back and waited until someone took our order. Our waiter was okay. Not terribly attentive or friendly, but also didn't ignore us. The restaurant was busy, and the two waiters were busying themselves going from table to table. I had a chicken sandwich and I think my daughter had chicken tenders. We also split an order of fries. She had no complaints about her food and ate nearly everything on her plate. My sandwich was enormous. It was an entire butterflied chicken breast and was twice the size of the bun. It was, however, rather bland. There was no seasoning on it at all, not even salt or pepper. I was able to season it with what was sitting at my table, but I felt strange doing it because really, who doesn't season a piece of chicken before throwing it on the cooktop?  I may go back for breakfast one day, since that's what seems to get all the rave reviews, but I've been unimpressed with their options outside of breakfast.",-0.4186,0.854,0.072,0.075,0.558974358974359

Once I saw the reviews of Sammys I knew this was the place. They did not disappoint! From the moment we walked in we were taken care of like we were at a fine dining establishment. I wish I would have gotten their names but the gentleman working made sure our coffee was filled all the time, cut up my niece's French toast before bringing it to the table, opened the little creamers for our coffee, and when my sister sneezed he yelled ""bless you!"" from across the room. I know that seems like a small thing saying bless you but after the good service we had we knew this was a special place.  Now the food! The ham!!! You have to have the ham. Normally when you ask for a slice of ham for breakfast you get the typical quarter inch slice of ham. At Sammys you get an inch thick, maybe more, piece of ham. It was so tender and seasoned to perfection. My mom and I shared an omelette because I read portions are generous here. Glad we did because it was more than enough for two people. It was the best omelette I have had in a long time. The ingredients tasted fresh and it was perfectly cooked. For all four of us to eat it was only $16! You can't beat that.  My sister and I agreed even if I don't have a layover again in Chicago, the next time I'm visiting my family we are going to make the trip to Sammys just for the experience and food again.",0.9962,0.791,0.201,0.008,0.5434126984126985

2014-11-02,4.0,"I do not like them, Sam-I-am. I do not like green eggs and ham. Yeah? Well Sam-I-Am ain't nevah had ham like this, or he would change his tune!!!! THE SCENE One of the many reasons I love breakfast so much is because of being raised in Chicago. I always thought it was just our family, but it seems eating breakfast ANYTIME of day is a long standing tradition throughout the city.  On a recent trip back home I discovered most of the places I grew up loving are no longer in business. Glady's Kitchenette was the benchmark of the best breakfast anywhere and it has sadly bit the dust along with other favorites like Miss Muffets on 79th and Bobby's on 90th. These were iconic spots that vividly materialize in my minds-eye everytime I think of the best breakfast places I've ever eaten. Bobby's and Miss Muffets in particular served their breakfast with ham carved off the bone! Let me tell you a secret... You haven't eaten breakfast until you've eaten breakfast with a giant slab of fresh cut ham! So when I heard Sammy's Kitchen was serving breakfast with fresh off the bone ham, I made it my duty to pay them a visit. Besides, they were only minutes from our hotel.   THE EXPERIENCE Located in a tiny building with an even tinier parking lot on the corner of 55th and Luna Lane you will find this quaint little hole in the wall establishment. Nothing about this place is standard. The entrance door was propped open and you could see directly into the kitchen. I assumed it was a side door and walked around to the font of the building trying to find a proper entrance! NOT!!!  The moment you walk in , to your right is a dark storage area with public restrooms just behind it. Directly in front of you is the kitchen counters and to the left is the dining room with a mish-mash of tables and chairs. It's a busy place, so without much standing room you tend to find people standing wherever they can, but generally blocking the entrance. This created a bit of a traffic jam for those coming in, those going out and the staff who unfortunately have to keep the refrigerated drinks and silverware outside of the kitchen near the congestion. You will hear  ""excuse me, I just need to get in there"" often as you wait to be seated. It took us 20 minutes to be seated, but honestly it flew by as I spent most of that time in conversation with my Chicago brethren waiting with me to be seated. THE FOOD Sammy is the definition of the term ""service with a smile."" They truly go out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home. They initially got my order wrong, but never sent it out because the manager/owner caught the mistake. They promptly told me of the error, but assured me they were working hard to get the order out quickly, and they did!  - HAM & EGGS (3.75 stars) | $6.50 It wasn't the exact flavor explosion I was looking to experience, but it did the trick. I enjoyed the ham more than the eggs.   - FRENCH TOAST (3.5 stars) | $3.95 - VEGETARIAN OMELETTE SPECIAL (4 stars) | $4.50 My wife loved it! Included onions, pepper, mushrooms, cheese, hashbrowns and toast. - CORNED BEEF HASH (1 star) | $  I did not enjoy this at all. Cooked too hard and had very little flavor. - Pancakes (3.75 stars) | included as a substitution - Hash browns (3 stars) | included  This is old school Chicago style hash browns. Good, but would be awesome if they were seasoned.  Featured on the TV show ""Off the Bone"":  youtube.com/watch?v=yZ6J… FINAL THOUGHTS The portions are enormous, especially the ham slice, which could have fed my family all winter! I believe it is right at one pound of grilled porky deliciousness. We all enjoyed our meal and none of us could finish our plates because of the sheer amount of food. If I had any complaints it would be they added waaaaay to many onions to my eggs and I wish the hash browns were seasoned. Other than that we found the meal to be very enjoyable and super easy on the wallet.  Service: 5 stars Reasonable Prices: 5 stars Food: 3.5 stars I DO like them Sam-I-Am, I really do like their glorious ham!",0.9967,0.798,0.133,0.069,0.49547619047619057

The food is great and they have huge portions.  Nothing super special about the menu, just a basic breakfast and lunch diner-ish feel.  The soup is probably the only ""stand out"" item on the menu.  They have a couple of soups made fresh every day which is nice.   The best part of this place however is the staff, I'm not sure if it's family owned and operated but it definitely has that feel.  I've been here about 5 times over the course of 2 years and I swear they remember me and it's usually the same 2-3 people working there.   The last time I went was 07/14/2014.  I was there early in the morning and my friend and I ordered breakfast.  We sat at the bar area and I was telling the waiter how I had just come off of working 8 hours and drove straight to the airport for my flight and that I was exhausted.  When we got up to pay for our breakfast he handed us 2 brown paper bags with soup to go for each of us so we could have some after we got up from our naps.  Seriously?  That is amazing.  It's things like that that make me wish I lived closer so I could come here more often.

2013-09-06,5.0,I've read reviews on this place before so decided to try it out last weekend for breakfast. Got there about 10am and it was completely packed (granted there are only about 10 tables in the restaurant). We ordered our food and decided to place it to go as we didn't want to wait for a table to open up. About 5 min after we ordered a table opened up and the man at the register (I believe he is the owner) offered us to sit there if we wanted to eat in. We assured him we were fine taking it to go so he offered it to the next people in line ( a line forms out the door with people waiting to get a table). While we stood by the counter waiting for our food I got a good chance to observe the employees and I must say they are very busy and do a great job! After about 20 minutes our food was ready and we walked up to pay and the man would not take our money. He told us it was on the house for being so patient and waiting. I could not believe it!! It's great to know that there are still people in this world who care about their customers and believe in good customer service. The food was also very good....I got the vegetarian omelette and my boyfriend got the pepper and egg sandwich. The pepper and egg sandwich is the best I have had in the area! I will definitely be back not only because of the food but mostly because of the exceptional customer service! We plan to go back for breakfast this weekend and leave a generous tip!!

Sammy's is high speed, low drag, no white table cloths, plastic dishes, and you can't beat the price for the taste.  It's not open late, they have some small tables to seat four, some half booths, and three windows.  Came in for some breakfast (of course) and was greeted with some very courteous and respectful service.  The menu has just enough items to give you options without getting you to stall.  A meal with a large orange juice averages $6 per person.  What a steal!  Feel free to pay for your meal at the counter. Pancakes: Fluffy, good size. Veggie Omelet: Not greasy.  I might say a bit dry but that's a personal preference.  Low on salt and highly customizable. Orange Juice: no pulp, tastes fresh. Parking: East and west side of the building.  West side of the building is a bar but I'm quite sure they don't open until after Sammy's closes.  North side of building is reserved, don't park there.
