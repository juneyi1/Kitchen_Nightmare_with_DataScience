2016-04-01,5.0,"Nearly perfect Thai-ming. As often as I spend weeknights at Emporium Wicker Park (literally right next door), I'm surprised that I hadn't been here until just the other night.  Well shame on me for taking so long!  This place is quite a treasure. Seeking sustenance, Anna T and I walked in on a Thursday at 7pm and I was impressed right away by the cute Asian decor in the entryway.  Inside the dining area, they had some seriously groovy music playing--it was Oriental, but with a clubby vibe, and made me want to take a nice warm steam bath.  Aside from that, the bathroom was virtually spotless and the rest of the interior was awesomely tasteful. I always make a point to order hot tea when I'm eating Thai/Chinese/sushi, and in this situation what I got was quite possibly the BEST cup of tea I've ever drank.  It was jasmine tea, and once it had cooled down a bit I found myself head over heels in love with the sensual aroma and soothing flavor of it.  Not sure exactly what, or why, but that damn cup of tea hit home in the best way possible. Our appetizer was chicken satay, which came with a tasty peanut sauce and cucumber salad (amazing, by the way).  A good value for like $6, too.  Anna T got some chicken thing, and I chose the pad thai made extra spicy. While mine was flavorful and indeed spicy, it seemed to be lacking in the chicken department, and also didn't come with the lovely floral garnish of carrot that adorned her entreé.  I couldn't help but feel a tad jipped by comparison, especially considering that her white rice came in a delightful heart shape (cue the 'awwwwww's') and my pad thai was very unceremoniously slapped down onto a plate. Bread = 4.5 Circuses = 5 It was very quiet while we dined, but that's just as well, since the atmo in here is more suited towards a dinner date anyways.  Pot Pan will definitely be on my radar whenever I visit Emporium next (which, let's be honest, will probably be tomorrow).

Boyfriend gets the pad thai, I get the ""potstickers"" and a spicy noodle dish with shrimp.  I wish I had taken a photo of the ""potstickers."" I took a bite of one and found that - huh, that's weird - there's no meat it in! We all know what a potsticker looks like yes? Wrapper outside, something identifiable as meat, usually mixed with some vegetables, on the inside? This thing was instead half-filled with a pure-white mush. Since it was the exact same color as the outside, I laughed for a second and said, ""haha, I guess they forgot to put filling in this one! It just looks like undercooked dough inside, woops."" So I bit into a second one. SAME THING. I'm completely baffled. I hail the waitress and  - get this - they tell me there IS meat; it's shrimp ground up with vegetables. I think I just stared at her with my mouth open for awhile. Folks - there was NOTHING identifiable in that as shrimp. Absolutely nothing. It was literally a bland white mush. So I tried the noodles, and I find the shrimp is completely raw - not ""sort of on the rare side"" but literally gray, slimy, and raw. The sauce is thick, sickly sweet, and awful. At this point, I am just so sad. Why would anyone do this to Thai food? Did Thai food run over the owner's grandmother at some point? Boyfriend is three bites into the pad thai at this point and has to stop because it's so sweet that it's making him feel sick. This is literally the WORST Thai food - perhaps the worst food in general - that I have ever had at a restaurant. A spattering of folks below gave this place 4 or 5 stars, and I can only imagine that they are either related to the owners, have been eating bricks all their lives and this is their first foray into people food, or are really freaking drunk.

The sauce was terrible: pure sugar and hardly any flavor. I'd rather by an instant pad thai box from the store. My soup was a little better, but still far too sugary especially for a soup. The chicken was so bland and tough, I could hardly recognize it as chicken. We both have aching tummies.

I was looking forward to spicy noodles while staying in and watching a movie. Now I'm just laying on my couch feeling like I should have spent the calories on some Piece pizza instead of oily and soggy noodles. Disappointed.

At least the vanilla flavor was. They also offered green tea, chocolate, and one other flavor I cannot remember. Perhaps lychee? Also, a single serving with whip cream is only 2.00. So if its something new you have never tried, it's totally worth it.  The steamed pot stickers are also very yummy. You only get 4, and they are not very big, but they taste great for an appetizer.

The restaurant itself was clean, fast paced, and of what waitresses can be found in the place, they are very compliant and sweet...or at least understandable.  The negatives: Their pad thai, which seems to be everyones favorite since nobody knows or wants to try anything new with a different name at a thai/chinese restuarant, is very bland. The serving was large and proportionate, and the tofu soaked up all of the flavor , but there was no kick to it. No spice what so ever. And that's always disappointing when ordering good pad thai.

If I go to a restaurant that serves it, you better believe that's what I'm getting. It's not that I'm not an adventurous eater, or that I dislike leaving my comfort zone. It is simply that I love green curry to the point of wishing I could publicly declare my undying devotion to it, before promising it a lifetime of care and commitment.  Oh wait. I just did. Mooooving on. The Pot Pan is beautifully appointed, with (what I assume to be) an authentic Thai (or tourist-Thai) atmosphere. We came for a birthday dinner and the food was indeed celebration-worthy (or at least mine was).  The service, however, was a little spotty, considering we were the only large party of maybe three other tables. I won't go into detail, as it truly didn't detract from the fun of the evening, but I would recommend a little more attention to detail from staff. But once again, not a big deal on this occasion. The food, including it's presentation, was delicious. I can't speak to the taste of everyone else's dishes, but my green curry was JUST the right kind of spicy. It can sometimes be very difficult to impress upon a restaurant that I do, indeed, want it as spicy as humanly possible. Often I end up disappointed. Not so at Pot Pan.

Maybe I wouldn't have noticed all of this if our service was a little more attentive.  We couldn't understand it - we were the ONLY people in the entire restaurant. Why couldn't we get better service? The food was alright, but both of us ordered spicy entrees and neither of us tasted any spice at all. It took forever for the waitress to bring our check over.

When we open the bag, there were the two tum yum soups, each in it's cup and each cup wrapped in a plastic bag. What happened? well, the 2 plastic lids were totally destroyed, which means that at least half the soup (in each cup) was all over the plastic bag, which I wasn't going to eat, due to the unknown origin of the plastic bags and the hygiene issues. I ended up having the soup that was left, though. In the ingredients of the soup it reads ""mushrooms"" but what did I get? ONE mushroom in each soup... really? Alright... enough with the soup. Crab rangoon: most of it was crust. Just a little cream cheese and the sauce for it wasn't enough. Chicken satay: the chicken tasted like anything but satay. Funny flavor also. Spring rolls: is it really that hard to go wrong with spring rolls? Well, it seems that it's possible! We were not even able to eat them with our bare hands! They were not sticky as spring rolls should be, so they kept on falling apart, plus they were not tight. Seem that there wasn't enough filling. oh, on top of all these, the delivery dude was rude.

The spring rolls tasted good; my only complaint is likely a matter of taste...but who wraps up all the ingredients into a thick, watery leaf of iceberg lettuce and then wraps it up into rice paper?

We ordered the pad woon sen and pad see ewe in addition to spring rolls as appetizers. None were good at all even after we tried to doctor the food with chili and fish sauce... speaking of which, they did not have fish sauce out. Soy sauce is not a Thai staple like fish sauce. We had to actually ask for the fish sauce with peppers (nam pla prik.) Nam pla = fish sauce... prik = pepper. At least the waitress did get that for us. Service was okay, but the lady seemed a bit rude.  Anyways, back to the food... Both noodle dishes were waaay too sweet. Even the thai coffee was the same way. The spring rolls had old tofu in it and lots of sauce on top which I assume was to try and cover the shoddy ingredients. Shame on you Pot Pan... I went home not eating too much.

2010-11-02,2.0,I considered giving this place one star but I decided to give it two stars. The place itself is nicely decorated and byob is always great. The service was friendly though fairly inattentive and they screwed up the order. We went in on a Saturday night for a quick bite before a play. The place was probably one third full. We asked to sit at a booth but the manager said they were reserved for larger parties. Problem is that every booth when we got there and every booth when we left had only two people in it. So really the manager should have just let us sit in a booth since that is what we asked for. I ordered tom yum tofu. It came as tom yum shrimp. I must say that the broth was delicious but it was full of bell peppers which is not what I want to eat in my tom yum soup. And then there were the shrimp that I don't eat. I ordered pad thai tofu since I like to try this dish at Thai places that are new to me. I guess I am kind of a Thai food snob since I lived in Thailand for 3 months but a solid tom yum and pad thai or pad siew is always a good indicator of the food at a Thai restaurant. I think this is the worst pad thai that I've ever had. Seriously. It was drowning in some ridiculously sweet sauce. Like a sweet and sour sauce right out of a bottle. There was also no egg in the dish. No egg in pad thai?? That is one of the best parts. I added lime to cut the sweetness and hot pepper sauce to make it edible. I barely ate half of it and I forced that half down.

Luckily the dressing wasn't too syrupy so it was still edible, but that was kind of a downer for me. No one likes their cucumber salad submerged in dressing. Anyway, the panang curry was very good. It was spicy, thick, peanutty, had plenty of tofu and vegetables and the portions were huge. In fact, the rest of it is my lunch today. I would go back for the panang curry, for sure. My friend wasn't as lucky. His sweet and sour ""chicken"" had one piece of chicken. It was a little sad. Though, he liked the flavors of his dish.

They were tasty. Well cooked, not soggy, and filled with meat, cabbage and vermicelli noodles. Amanda (my lady friend) had the Bamee Wonton noodle soup. It was all right. The noodles and ingredients were a nice combination but the broth lacked flavor. It was very bland. Adding some of the red sauce from the table helped but you don't want to count on that.

2009-06-03,2.0,"If Panang would deliver to my house, I wouldn't even need to be writing this review! I've had Pot Pan multiple times while living in this neighborhood - because it's the least restrictive means of getting my Thai food fix. But if I had better options - I don't know that I'd eat here again. I'll do a rundown by dish I've sampled: Pad Thai: it's *alright* if I'm ravenous. It mostly tastes...too sweet, almost ketchup-y. I do love the addition of the red cabbage, but since it's all covered in the ketchup-y sauce...eck! Panang Curry: my favorite Thai dish, period. Pot Pan's is very tasty, and spicier than others I've had (which I like). I can actually find the hot peppers in the sauce, and I appreciate that. The takeout/delivery portion always seems a little small (especially in comparison to the large takeout portions of other dishes, like the Pad Thai)...but that's probably for the best. Curry Fried Rice: it's really tasty (though not so great the next day), and I like the vegetables throughout (tomatoes in fried rice!? alright!). Unfortunately every time I eat it, I seem to get an upset stomach the next day. Not like sick, just uncomfortable. I have no idea if it's the curry or what, but I'm sure it's this dish. I'll have to leave myself a little post-it about not ordering it anymore unless I want to feel surly all the next day. Thai tea: passable - but I've had far better. The service is really friendly - and the delivery is like, lightning fast. The prices are also pretty reasonable comparatively. I just don't think the food is so amazing that it could stand out if there were better options in the neighborhood. Lucky for Pot Pan, they've sorta cornered the market.

Went here with a friend who was visiting from the wonderful city of Cleveland and wanted to introduce her to thai cuisine.  Unfortunately, she was staying with a friend of hers in Wicker Park, an area to which I am unfamiliar. We chose pot pan because of its close proximity to where she was staying.  In short, the food was average.  The Tom Kha was orange colored and oily, due to the copious amount of bell peppers in the soup.   I wasn't particularly a fan of the sweetness provided by the peppers, or the color.  There were no pieces of galangal or lemongrass in the soup itself, I assume they removed them prior to service, which I didn't mind. The Pad Thai was extremely wet, something I didn't enjoy at all.  There was an odd, musky scent (that really turned my friend off....) and the sauce was very sweet.  It was served with a lemon wedge and a few crushed peanuts.  Like I said, it was average, there isn't much else to say. Service was unattentive, not rude, but not friendly by any means. The decor is what took the two star food to a three star yelp rating.  They had great music playing and a very simple and comfortable atmosphere.  Otherwise, I probably won't return.",0.9516,0.808,0.133,0.059,0.4532199546485261

2009-05-11,3.0,"If there's any cuisine that I would absolutely die without, it'd be Thai food. We went here with a party of about 20 on a Saturday night. Parking was actually not too bad for a Saturday night in Wicker Park. Damn you Laz again for 25 cents for 15 mins! Note: Do not park in the back of the restaurant - one of our friends were towed. Decor was modern Asian chic - neutral stone tiles lined the walls and the upholstered tufted booth seats had a tufted Moroccan feel.  Oh and what is up with the music? I  felt like either stripping or doing the robot. Being the Thai Connoisseur that I pretend to be, I'm always more critical when I try out a new Thai reastaurant. My signature dish: Basil Chicken. I must say when it arrived, it looked really enticing. If there's one thing this place does well, it's presentation. From the  deep red plates they serve your food on to the slight touches of garnish on each plate, it makes the cuisine look like something out of Top Chef. Beware beware, whenever you make something look that good, expectations always spike (see my review on Friendship Chinese Restaurant in Logan Square). Sadly, this was the case. Basil chicken is somewhat tricky - it's literally a sweet and salty dish. Here it was way too sweet. Also, the ratio between meat and vegetables were definitely leaning towards the latter end. 3 stars. I did have a sip (or three) of my friends Thai Iced Tea. It was pretty awesome and they give  you  a good amount. 5 stars. Value was very good. It is BYOB and with about as many bottles of wine as we had people, the staff was very accommodating even when we got louder towards the end of the night. Total bill with 20 people? $203.15.

2009-02-23,2.0,"I've been trying to find a Thai restaurant in the Chicago area that is worth a damn in particular a restaurant who makes a good curry, knows hot from mild, and can make decent Pad Thai. In the case of Pot Pan, like most Thai in Chicago, it is not worth its weight in fish sauce. I ordered delivery, so I will forgo commenting on service or atmosphere and go straight on to the meat and veg of the subject.  I ordered a slew of appetizers and a hot spiced chicken/tofu combo Pad Thai. The appetizers were merely palatable, not near good, but palatable. Fried Tofu was alright, a bit rubbery, but not bad. The sweet and sour sauce with the tofu looked like it might have been made in house but tasted bland and suspiciously similar to something found in the Asian section of Jewel. The Spring rolls were poorly constructed and flavorless. The ""fresh"" veg in the rolls were dry and clearly cut before they were received in the kitchen. The Crab Rangoon, well, it was the exact same Crap Rangoon you find all over this city, but one can't really complain about fried fish flavored cream cheese fritters. The Pad Thai was lack luster, although better than most in Chicago. Although I ordered hot spice, this Thai could hardly break a ten on the scovel scale. The dish was seasoned far below par, tasting more of wok oil than anything else. One of the marks of good Pad Thai is the delightful variance in texture between the tofu, meat, noodles, and veg and albeit possible that time in a styrofoam box could have had a negative effect, there was a uniform rubbery texture throughout this travesty. Was the food awful? No. Although I can not say it was worth the money or time I spent chewing. There are worse though, so I give two stars for effort.",0.7739,0.747,0.144,0.109,0.49507575757575767

Pot Pan's had a little sweeter sauce and it also offered up a few more veggies so PP's might just trump Bamee....and speaking of veggies, they were incredibly fresh and tasty.    Apps: We went with the Baby Egg Rolls and Pot Stickers.  Baby Egg Rolls were fantastic, (and another reminder here) reminded me of Joy's up in E Lakeview/Boystown, 5/5.  The Pot Stickers lacked a bit and were just deep fried as opposed to ""seared/pan fried on one side and steamed on the other"", which would be the proper, healthy, and tastiest way to prepare them.  Still good at a 3/5. Entree: I covered mine above and now for the Chicken Pad Thai ...save for the chicken, which was very good, the rest of this dish completely missed the mark.  It was way overly sweet and tangy and had zero spice.  Frankly, it would get a 2/5 at best, tbh.

2007-10-29,5.0,"Pot Pan has recently reopened, and the menu hasn't changed. Personally, I love quite a few dishes. The Tom Kha with tofu is an excellent pre-meal soup, if you're a fan of coconut milk. As a fan of sour tastes, this one hits my tongue just right, and the mushrooms, tofu, and peppers add that extra piquancy. The Panang and Red Curries are also both quite tasty. I thoroughly enjoy, for pure aestheticism, the large silver-colored serving dish in which the rice arrives. For $1 one can have a very light, refreshing cucumber salad. When not getting the Tom Kha, I often either take this as my appetizer, or, if I'm particularly ravenous, also get the Tofu salad. All of the entrees I've had were fully customizable (I'm somewhat picky about which vegetables I have in what dishes) and have yet to have a complaint. Some dishes stand out above others (I thoroughly enjoy their Pad See Eiw). For something with a little extra kick I would definitely recommend the Basil Fried Rice or Spicy Grilled Eggplant (along with the curries, I normally finish quite a few glasses of water with these dishes). As to the new decor, I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. The music doesn't really strike me as fitting in with the entire restaurant. However, they have utilized the smaller space well. The tables, chairs, and general color pattern are much more warm and cozy (as opposed to claustrophobic). The location on Milwaukee also now offers excellent people watching.

Pot Pan is delicious Thai that has been in the Bucktown-Wicker Park neighborhood for years, without the declining quality of Penny's or the ever-changing bland Pan-Asian place next to Quimby's.

2007-03-19,4.0,"This is the best Thai restaurant in Wicker Park that I've been to so far.  I stopped in and sat at the bar for a few minutes while I ordered my take out.  It's a relatively spacious restaurant, with lots of Southeast Asian Thai decor.  They got my order pretty quickly, and I was happy with my Vietnamese Spring Rolls and the Chicken Pad Thai.  I usually get this when trying out Thai restaurants because it's become a known staple at all Thai restaurants and the easiest way to make a comparison.  There are quite a few Southeast Asian cuisines that don't make it on to a menu or some make as specials so that's going to be unique to the place.  I thought it was pretty good, and was quite impressed with the portions of food that they give.  I'm glad I'm not getting ripped off as I was able to have this as leftovers for lunch the next day.  I will have to sit in the next time and take advantage of the Thai iced tea.  I'm always kind of disappointed when I don't see Papaya salad on the menu.  I may have to program there phone number to my cell phone to pick up food here in the future.",0.9723,0.84,0.135,0.025,0.5304347826086957
2007-03-02,3.0,"This place has okay food. Nothing to write home about. The waitress was okay, but one of the employess kid was running all over the restaurant, and it made me a little uncomfortable. The Lard Nar isjust so so. I know a lot of places that have better. The vegetable soup is just veggies in a bowl and then they pour boiling hot water over them to cook them and... TaDa!!! There's your completely flavorless soup! The eggrolls were the saving grace of this place. I don't think I would go back.",0.8252,0.847,0.122,0.031,0.53125
2006-12-15,1.0,"Ok, I admit it, it is friday night and I am home eating take-out pot pan! Give me a break, I am tired.  Ok, I am kind of surprised this has favorable reviews, and is specifically compared positively to Penny's.  This food is HORRIBLY overcooked and greasy.  The noodles are a mushy mess (so much so, I did not recognize them as noodles in my dish) and thought I was ASSURED the lad nar is vegetarian if ordered with veggies I very distinctly taste oysters.  Tempura is inherently greasy, but this is some of the greasiest tempura I have ever tasted! If this is quality thai food, thai food is a mushy terrible, greasy, over sweetened but otherwise flavorless mess.  Even my side of plain steamed noodles is a mess!  They also smell and taste strongly of chlorine. I am very big on clean flavors, and strong flavors, as well as texture, and this really has NONE of the above.  After a few bites I am entirely DONE with this meal, and it was more than twice the cost of Penny's.  I am not a huge fan of Penny's but when I am starving I even their worst dish I had was palatable.",-0.7693,0.724,0.132,0.144,0.5295705627705626
2006-11-25,3.0,"I got delivery from them last night. The ordering process was fairly painless, and they delivered in a speedy fashion. We were quoted 45 minutes and the food was there in 30 minutes. They were friendly too. There is not much to write about the food. The green curry was very spicy and tasted too much of black licorice. The Pad Thai had no soy beans but cabbage (never saw that before) and the taste was overall pretty bland. Shrimp dumplings were nothing to talk about. It all kind of  felt like I was eating frozen Thai dishes from the local grocery store. Not bad, but not good either. It wasn't too expensive but in that price range, I can think of more interesting places to eat from.",0.652,0.815,0.108,0.077,0.49411764705882366

2006-01-30,4.0,"Pretty good as Thai food goes, and their dining area is pleasant & tidy & almost never crowded.  It's far enough removed from the obnoxious heart of the North/Damen/Milwaukee Hipster Central district to be a nice choice for a reasonable, low-key meal.",0.8481,0.685,0.253,0.062,0.7462962962962963
