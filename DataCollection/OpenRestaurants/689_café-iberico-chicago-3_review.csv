2017-08-28,5.0,Live down the street and a passed many times thinking I should try it. Finally stopped in after they change their sign which gave it a updated look. It's going to be my new favorite go to place. Large Tapas plates. Everything was fresh. Craft cocktails. Ceviche type dish was flavorful and not your standard Lemon doused with hot peppers. The white bean soup was absolutely phenomenal and we did not even try any of the entrées. Five tapas was too much for the two of us and we both went home with leftovers.  The goat cheese tapas was touted as a house favorite. My daughter concurred. We sat in the bar. The dining room is noisy but looked fun and busy. Looks like a place locals frequent.,0.8873,0.87,0.101,0.029,0.47188269247092773
2017-08-22,3.0,"This is the one restaurant that I have frequented the most over the years. Up till now I have always given them a 5 star rating. Why the change? Well I went there during the winter, and asked to sit on the side with the deli, as I have in the past I was told that the other side was currently being renovated. I thought to my self, renovation great. Now wait hold on!! The other side was  perfect, it didn't need any improvements. That side reminds me of the many places I have eaten at in Madrid, Espana. Better yet the food was almost on par with the places in Madrid. Over the years, I have taken many friends and family members there to enjoy the food and ambiance. We celebrated many special moments there. Just prior to leaving after every meal, I scoped out all of the Spanish products being offered for sale at the deli. Normally, I would always find something, in addition to taking home some serrano ham, manchego cheese, and chorizo butifarra. This was my routine for many years. This is one of the only places where I could pick up chorizo to put into my signature dish at home, paella.   Well, I purposely didn't go for months to allow them time to finish the renovation work that they started. Upon my return, I did my usual, as soon as I stepped in and faced the hostess; I requested to sit on the side with the deli. To my surprise the hostess said, that side has been blocked off and is no longer part of the restaurant. There was some sort of disagreement between the building owner and the restaurant owner; and as a result the lease was not renewed. I was probably standing with my mouth open in astonishment!! At first, I was speechless, I never wanted to sit anywhere else. We ended up being seated upstairs in what was once called the pintxos restaurant. I have to admit that I did not enjoy the ambiance up there. Nor the fact, that there is no more deli! The sudden realization that everything changed set in, and saddened me.

2017-07-14,2.0,"Noo thanks Not much about this restaurant that left a positive impression on me - food, service, ambiance, everything, subpar. First off it feels like a dungeon. When it fills up it feels a little claustrophobic. Servers come around every now and then to take plates and refill drinks/water, but not frequently enough. Also our server forgot to put in the ""hot"" tapas we ordered, so there was a bit of a gap in our meal vs a steady stream of plates coming out. The sangria is terrible, I didn't finish my glass. The food - I honestly can't remember anything I liked very much. We had smoked salmon, jamon with manchego, seafood salad, two types of paella (iberico and the special with cuttlefish and cauliflower), chorizo and murcilla, croquetas, ensalada de pollo, pulpo de plancha, and patatas bravas. I'll skip the stuff that was just ok (not great and wouldn't order again) and cover the bad - patatas bravas were unlike any I've ever had, they were boiled potatoes covered in a weird sauce (not fried with hot sauce and aioli like I'm used to). The paellas were bad, like in a blind taste test with microwave rice-a-roni I would fail. Bland rice, low quality ingredients, 0 saffron flavor, not even a little hint of socarrat?  Anyway, this isn't a place I'd return. In a city full of good food there's no reason to waste time here",-0.654,0.739,0.126,0.135,0.5549499925361994

The one thing I wasn't too happy about was our service . Our waitress wasn't all that great. She would only come over when she would see us wave her down . She never really check in on us or if we needed anything . I think I waited at least 20 minutes to get my watered refilled which I wasn't too happy about . I try not to say anything negative about waitresses and waiters since I was one before and I know how it can be on a busy day but to wait for water is just straight up annoying .  Other than that , I think I'll have to maybe go again to try some of the tapas I didn't try and hopefully the service will be better as well .",0.8933,0.75,0.149,0.1,0.5356150793650795

There were still dirty napkins left on it. Our server forgot one of our orders and we ended up leaving it because it took so long. Our server also forgot to bring our bread-- which every table but ours was receiving when they first arrived. We asked for it, along with eating utensils. Food: We ordered the parrilla mixta (squid, shrimp, octopus special of the day), the paella, gambas and patatas bravas. The parrilla tasted burnt. The gambas were decent, the patatas never arrived.

2017-06-11,3.0,"I enjoyed Café Iberico. Per the recommendation of one of my favorite salespeople I decided to give it a try because it honestly wasn't on my radar. Two other things also contributed to my visit, I didn't want an extremely strong cocktail nor did I want a hefty meal. Today was extremely hot so a pitcher of cold sangria sounded real appetizing. The restaurant put ice cubes in your cup only & not the picture as to not dilute the sangria.  It was tasty, not to strong not to light. I felt sort of like a lush seeing as how I dined alone & had an entire half picture of sangria on my table but the guilt disappeared after my 2nd cup. The shrimp dish (Gambas al Ajillo) was kind of boring. There's flavor there but the dish lacked creativity in my humble opinion. It's honestly something I could've made at home. Now the Croquetas de Pollo was a different story altogether. Once the waiter explained that it was creamy I decided to indulge. Imagine if you will a better & lighter version of ""Chicken Cordon Bleu"". The aioli that came with was extremely thick however & if spread heavily could totally overpower the ""puffs"". This dish was great though. Prices are fair & aside from the annoying music in the bar area the ambiance was nice as well.",0.9747,0.778,0.158,0.064,0.7071839080459769

2017-01-03,1.0,"I am emailing to express my disappointment with the very poor service that my friends and I received at Cafe Iberico on December 19th.  Up until recently, I've enjoyed going to Cafe Iberico for the food and the service. I always recommend this restaurant to friends and family that are looking for a good tapas place in Chicago. Unfortunately, after our visit on Monday (December 19th), this has changed.  On the said date, my friends and I decided to go to Cafe Iberico to celebrate my best friend's birthday. The service started off in a very dissapointed way. It all began when I called to make a reservation that day. The person on the phone was rude, had an attitude and lacked any form of civilized communications. I overlooked her poor communication skills because I know Cafe Iberico is generally a good place with good food and good people.  In the evening, one of my friends was the first to arrive and was received by Lupe, who was very rude and unpleasant to my friend. She quickly stated to my friend that she was the first one from the party of six, but didn't state that she needed to wait til everyone arrived and/or offered up any waiting options --- something a host typically does to keep the guest busy.  We eventually got sat at a table nearest to the back by a closed door. As soon as we sat down we realized that it freezing cold, probably due to the door. Our waiter was not welcoming or accommodating and didn't even introduce himself. We had to ask one of the busser who came by with water, because at this point our waiter had left, to see if they could do anything about the cold and he didn't really say anything. We asked the same busser if we could move to the table behind us that was empty and one of the waiters came back to tell us that that table was reserved for a party that was going to be arriving soon. The best they could do was covered the seams of the door with a plastic bag and assumed that was going to help. It didn't. We were shivering the entire time.  One of my friend's glass broke and we had to ask twice to get someone to clean up the mess. Instead of property cleaning the mess, the waiter brought three napkins and thought that would suffice. In addition, we had to ask them twice to clean the water that had spilled on the floor, when it should've been done automatically.  The waiter rarely came, didn't ask to see how we were doing and didn't offer any refill on water. We order food that never got added to our order so it never came out. We ordered a second pitcher of sangria and only got it after we reminded the waiter. Two hours later, we paid. The food was great, but it was overlooked because of the poor service. At this point we were very annoyed and wanted to get the dinner over with. We noticed that the table behind us stayed empty. The party that was suppose to ""show up"" never did. This is what brought us over the edge.  As we made our way to the exit, my friend asked the same waiter who told us the table behind us was going to be occupied, where the party that was going to sit there was. The waiter avoided the question and sarcastically ask ""do you want to speak to the manager?"", and two of your employees, one being Lupe, the rude host laughed.  Needless to say, my friend's birthday dinner was a complete disaster because of your rude, unwelcoming and unapologetic staff. It was an awful experience at a restaurant that I use to love to go to.

We used to grab a few tables at the bar, pull them together, and share a table full of tapas with pitchers of sangria. Who could resist enjoying Spanish music in a beautiful bar with the walls decorated in authentic blue tile and the ceiling covered in wine bottles? It felt like home in more than one way, and the food was exceptional. Needless to say, I was looking forward to taking my fiancee there so that I could share an awesome experience like that again.  The place has changed a lot and has sadly lost some of its charm. We were seated downstairs in a dark room without any signs that this was an authentic Spanish restaurant. Instead of beautiful Spanish tile and pleasant music background, the walls looked bare, uninviting, and there was a big flat screen on the wall broadcasting some sort of cooking show (who wants to see that?). We were seated in the far corner of the room even if the place was empty at the time. There was a bar downstairs, but the bartender spent the entire evening chatting with staff who would come downstairs for a gossip or two. Our waitress must have had tables upstairs, because she checked in on us just once before we were done with our dinner. I was going for a romantic dinner with a Spanish twist, and ended up getting an almost food court-like experience. I'd give the atmosphere 1 star out of 5.  Food was hit or miss this time. Cazuela de Carne Asada was excellent, Pulpo a la Plancha was not bad, but Datiles con Jamon were way too sweet and not enjoyable at all.

I had the most inattentive bartender who didn't even try to engaging. I had to flag him every time I needed something and had to follow up on my order.  My meal was meh and my order was based upon Yelp reviews and the waiters recommendation.  Queso de Cabra (pesto bread with goat cheese and marinara) - cold and just bread with pesto and cheese. I could have made this at home.  Pastas Bravas (spicy potatoes) - these were tasty but I've had better. Champinoes a la Plancha (grilled mushrooms) - assorted mushroom medley. Just ok. There was a lot of different mushrooms but the flavors were not outstanding. Red Sangria - simple and straight forward but has too much ice and got watered down quickly.  Overall the portions were bigger than I expected. I would try this place again but in a group as the tables looked like they were all enjoying themselves.,0.9197,0.87,0.101,0.028,0.512279541446208

2016-10-06,3.0,"This place was nice but I really don't understand the hype. I came in on a weekday for lunch with my friend. The restaurant was huge with plenty of tables and seats around the bar area but only a few people were there at the time. Which is why I didn't understand why they chose to put us at a table RIGHT next to another couple. We were so close that our seats were touching and could hear every part of their conversation. It wasn't a huge deal but just odd that they chose to use their space like that.  Other than that, the service was fine. The food was decent as well. The best thing we had was garlic shrimp where the shrimp was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh. The next was the chicken and ham puffs. It's difficult not to like anything that is fried with melt-y flavorful filling.  I didn't really care for the seafood paella though. The rice was sort of dry and the seafood was just okay. Maybe it was because we were already so full by the time we got the paella but it didn't quite meet the expectations that all the reviewers raved about. I would recommend this place if you come with a large group so you can try different things and not get stuffed on just 2-3 dishes. It also seems like a fun place to have drinks with your friends. It's located in a nice area in the city. We were able to find street parking since it was the middle of the day but I can see that this place area would get quite busy at night especially the weekends.",0.9937,0.784,0.184,0.032,0.5380952380952381

I liked the ambiance and colors of the place as soon as I walked in. The restaurant was very loud and it was hard to hold a conversation across the table.  The food was great; I have absolutely no complaints about the taste of the three different dishes we ordered. The Paella Marinera (seafood paella), Patatas Bravas (spicy potato dish), and Pollo a la Brasa (roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies) didn't disappoint. The highlight for me was the flavor of each dish. The Paella Marinera was enormous for three to share and was delicious. The amount of seafood in the dish was surprising as well (plenty to share with everyone). The Patatas Bravas were seasoned with the perfect amount of spice and tomato goodness, and I could literally eat them all day. The Pollo a la Brasa was cooked to perfection; the mashed potatoes that came with the chicken were the highlight of the night. Can someone either give me the recipes for the potato dishes and/or give me the phone number of the chef, pretty please? The red wine sangria was fruity and very refreshing. We ordered a pitcher and it was the perfect amount to share between the three of us. I wish I could give Café Iberico four and a half stars, because I only want to deduct .5 from the rating due to the service that night. Usually, if a restaurant is busy, I'm willing to let a few service issues go and give the place five stars. However, we were there on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't packed. There were a few empty tables in the restaurant. Our waiter did forget to bring the olive oil for the bread, even though we asked for it multiple times (it took over 30 minutes to finally get the oil upon asking a different waiter, hurray)! It took just as long to also get the check, pay for our meal, and leave. The attentiveness was lacking throughout the meal, but that was a minor issue.

Pros:  - We were seated promptly (in about 15 mins) after we arrived at the restaurant (they don't take reservations for a party less than 8 on the weekends).  - The hostess and the server were very polite.  - some of the tapas were excellent. I liked the eggplant with goat cheese, the lamb, and the octopus. My daughter really liked the bread with goat cheese but I thought the bread was too greasy.  Cons:  - the sangria was not great. My wife remembered it to be much better on the earlier visit so it might just be an anomaly.  - some of the tapas were just okay. For example, I was quite disappointed by the chorizo.  - my main complaint however was with the noise. It was LOUD. And I mean REALLY LOUD! It was nearly impossible to hear the waiter and we felt that we had to shout to hear each other on the table. This is because of poor acoustics in the restaurant.

Both sides of the resultant bustling with lively customers, and we were seated promptly. Yes the service was quite good and you get waters and bread with olive oil right away, but the actual culinary experience was disappointing.  I grew up three years in the Canary Islands, and one year in Madrid, so I am no stranger to delicious Spanish cuisine. We ordered a potpourri of tapas: gambas al ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce), pulpo con papas fritas (octopus and fries), patatas bravas and jamón ibérico with queso manchego (Spanish ham and manchego cheese). The ONLY dish we loved was the octopus, the shrimp dish was passable and the others were throwaways. We also ordered sangria which was ok, but very very sweet. Nothing about this restaurant was memorable. And the price was expensive considering all the other amazing restaurants where we had eaten this weekend. Clearly it's different types of cuisine, but we ate at The Girl and the Goat, Lou Manatti's and Chicago Diner, and of all the places mentioned, Cafe Iberico was the worst food and the most expensive. We probably won't be returning anytime soon. Three stars for the service, the location (easily accessible to public transportation) and for the octopus dish. Everything else not so good.

First, the amazing - Sangria, especially the red. Just get it. The food - no complaints, the vast majority I really enjoy. Of special note- the patata bravas. The first time i came here, I did not get them as I figured it would be a waste to get potatoes. Don't be me. Get them. The octopus with fries - even if you don't like octopus, you will like these. Trust me. The octopus is grilled, and chopped up into easily bite size pieces, mixed with fries. Worth the try. For service, they need to smooth it out. A few times our forks and plates were taken away, with food still on the way! When the food gets out, we have no way to portion it or even eat it. Asking for the items takes an incredibly long time - 5 or more minutes for plates and forks, while the food gets colder.

The patatas bravas were really spicy, not super common in Spain, but good if you like spicy food. Croquetas were good, and tasted similar to what you would get in Spain.

Grilled octopus: I was pretty confused by how the octopus was mixed in a mound of french fries. The fries were a bit soggy, and the octopus pieces were few and far between. Goat cheese spread: Found this tapa extremely mediocre; while the goat cheese flavors meshed well with the tomato sauce, the marinara itself tasted as if it came from a jar. Grilled shrimp: the one somewhat redeeming tapa of the night. Had a nice amount of spice to it. Overall, the tapas here are larger in size than at a typical tapas place, making it easier to split among larger groups; however, given the quality, I found the food extremely overpriced and underwhelming--in addition to the lackluster tapas mentioned above, the complimentary bread was extremely dry and likely slightly stale.

I did like the pork dish with fries that my friend ordered-great flavor there. I found the service to be generally unaccommodating. They would not split the check for us, generally were very stiff, and were clumsy as well. Dishes were placed at the very ends of the table, instead of in the middle, and were then forgotten.

2016-02-06,3.0,"After being told the wait time at Au Cheval was a ridiculous 6 hrs, we furiously searched Open Table to see if anything else has last minute availability. Luckily we were able to just walk right in to Cafe Iberico. Ambiance: The main dining area was a huge room packed with tables. Honestly it didn't have that modern or trendy type atmosphere that a lot of places in the area have. No frills decor, which didn't really bother me. I did think that the tables were pretty smushed together to maximize the seating. It was pretty hard to navigate around all the other tables when going to the bathroom.  Service: The service felt just a little bit rushed. We ordered a ton of stuff and were in and out within an hour. It seemed like they just bombarded us plate after plate to the point where there was no space on the table. We had to quickly finish everything on the table to make room for the next dishes. No time for talking haha. I guess I would prefer this though over having to wait long periods if they staggered all the plates. Somewhere in between would've been nice. Food: In true tapas style, we just ordered a ton of different dishes and then got a little taste of each.  Patatas Bravas - This seemed like a more traditional take on patatas bravas than I've seen at other tapas places. It was a huge mound of fried potatoes drenched in a tomato based sauce. The flavor was just ok for me. I did like the slight hint of spice. Also, I was hoping it was less saucy so the potatoes would still be crisp. Quantity wise I was satisfied. Unlike Mercat a la Planxa, we got a full plate of potatoes instead of 5 tater tots on a plate.  Pincho de Solomillo - Basically a skewer of beef and fries and onions. The marinade was pretty flavorful and the meat was juicy. Pretty much like Spanish style steak frites. Queso de Cabra - Pieces of toast spread with some sort of pesto sauce. Then you top it off with a mix of marinara and goat cheese. Loved the crunchy toast mixed with the creamy goat cheese.  Croquetas de pollo - The description said it had chicken and ham in there, but the inside was pretty much had the texture of mashed potatoes and it was hard tell what was in it. Either way, I liked the taste. Crispy outside, smooth filling, and that creamy, cheesy dipping sauce was money. Reminded me of the cheap, street food croquettes I had in Amsterdam. Calamares a la Plancha - Grilled calamari that had a nice smokey, charred flavor off the grill. Texture was a little rubbery and hard to take down.  Empanada - This wasn't what I pictured. Instead of the usual bite sized empanada, it was like huge like a pot pie. Flakey crust filled with beef, veggies, and unfortunately nasty ass raisins haha.   Gambas al Ajillo - Probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. A skillet with shrimp tossed in olive oil, garlic, and some crushed red pepper. Garlic lovers will rejoice about this one.  Raxo adobado - Almost like a pork version of the pincho de solomillo. Pork loin and fries topped with onion/cilantro. The marinade was again tasty but the meat wasn't as tender and juicy as the beef. A little hard to cut through.  Chorizo y Morcilla - Mixed plate of chorizo and blood sausage. The chorizo had a nice crisp skin, but I'm not too big a fan of blood sausage. Wish the portion was a little bigger though.  Overall, dinner was just ok for me. The food was pretty good, with none of the flavors being too memorable. The meal was pretty much all business trying to finish all the food rather than taking our time and enjoying the company.

2016-01-10,2.0,"Went here on a Saturday night with a small group. Our rez was at 6 so the place was starting to get busy. The hosts seemed a little harried with seating people and managing large parties coming in. They were pleasant enough, but a bit abrupt and unsure? Hard to describe but it was a minor point. Also, in the lobby area, there is case along the bar in which each tapas dish is sampled. Kinda like in the mall where they have sample dishes on display. It was odd and not very visually appealing. We were seated quickly upstairs and served drinks quickly. The menu is large, and has photos of each item. Honestly, the photos were not that appetizing and kinda made the menu overwhelming to read. Most of the items are things typically on tapas menus. We ordered: spicy potatoes, fried calamari, grilled shrimp, goat cheese/crostini, mixed meat/seafood paella, chorizo, garlic mushrooms, and clams. All of the food was fine, but that's it. The best dish was probably the mushrooms, but they could have used a little more salt.   For the record, this is the largest tapas restaurant I've ever been to.  Most places I've been are tiny (and more expensive), but the food at those places was more complex and flavorful. I think this place does really well in terms of volume - our party of 7 seemed to be the smallest group in there. The servers were attentive and friendly which is always great.

2016-01-05,4.0,"My wife and I love Cafe Iberico. First of all is location, it is right in the middle of downtown Chicago. While the street parking can be challenging, they do offer valet which is nice.  The interior is very authentic. You feel like you're in Barcelona with the decorations, music, crowds, and very cozy (cramped) seating. While we enjoy it for a tapas restaurant, be aware intimate quiet conversations are not possible. Nonetheless, the food is top notch. We love the spicy potatoes, goat cheese dish, meat platter, mussels, and sauteed mushrooms. Pretty much all of the tapas are excellent. The only reason I do not give this restaurant 5 stars is I do agree that at times the paella leaves a bit to be desired. Sometimes it is excellent and others only so-so. I must say though, this restaurant is always loaded with customers who certainly by the cheers for the soccer teams on TV appear to be from Spain.

The place has changed, and not for the better. It was crowded, noisy, and the food was really mediocre (it used to be crowded and noisy with good food). Bacon-wrapped dates, supposedly filled with goat cheese, arrived on a plate with a tasteless orange sauce, and a mound of rice pilaf in the center. The dates had a mushy texture, and the rice (included mainly to make it look as if you were getting more for your money) was bland. My husband's grilled squid was okay, but nothing fantastic. Tomato bread with Manchego cheese and Spanish ham was good, though the bread was soggy. A plate of Morcilla y Chorizo had a stingy two pieces of Morcilla (blood sausage), and the rest was mostly inedible (fatty and tough) Spanish chorizo. Either the Morcilla is a lot more expensive, or they assumed no one would really want to eat it, hence the skimpy portion. The worst, most disappointing thing we ordered, however, was the seafood, pork and chicken paella - it was as bland as the ""Spanish"" rice you get at a Mexican restaurant - no, I take that back - it was much more bland that that. There wasn't a hint of the paprika that usually enlivens a good paella. The shrimps were tiny dried things (there may have been three of them in the whole pan). The whole mess was liberally sprinkled with peas and chopped red pimentos, which added no flavor at all. The Sangria was okay, and that's about it.

We arrived at 7pm on a Saturday evening and didn't have any trouble getting a table right away. We were seated upstairs in the main portion of the restaurant, which was still pretty empty at 7pm. I wasn't impressed with their dining space. No decor to speak of, essentially just a very large room with long rectangular tables. Their dining furniture is beat up. Also, no music at all. As the restaurant got more crowded, it became clear that the acoustics in the room were extremely poor; we were shouting to talk to the person right beside us (and again, not because any music). I ordered the scallops a la plancha, bacon wrapped dates, and patatas bravas. The food was interesting... I've had tapas many times and none of the flavors were familiar or like other tapas dishes I've had before. The bacon wrapped dates and the scallops were both served with rice side dishes. The scallops were cut into thin slices, which changes the concept of biting into a scallop, as there was no depth to these guys. The patatas bravas were like blanched potatoes in sauce. No sort of crispiness, instead they were soft potatoes in a runnier sauce. And finally, the bacon wrapped dates were dense and small.  Our waiter was in a rush and didn't introduce himself. Just came by as quickly as possible to take our orders and leave. At one point, the wrong dish was dropped off at our table and the waiter said we could just eat this instead and then asked if he could cancel the original order we had placed for the other dish. Unprofessional.  I will say that the $18 and up bottles of wine at this place are quite redeeming. We enjoyed lots of wine and sangria and left with a bill under $30 each, so that was the win of the evening.  Bottom line: I would not opt to come here again unless it was for the inexpensive wine list.",0.5384,0.846,0.077,0.076,0.5390937019969277

2015-10-12,2.0,"Arrived in the early evening on a Saturday, and had to sit at the bar because apparently every table was booked. For anyone familiar with authentic Spanish tapas, the notion of making reservations to eat tapas has got to seem a bit silly. It is supposed to be a very casual, low key way to eat. Anyway, the food was ok, if not awe-inspiring, the staff was friendly, and the restaurant was nice. That said, portions are smaller compared to the authentic tapas, and maybe we were there on a bad night, but items were very slow to come out of the kitchen. Had octopus, bacon wrapped dates, calamari good, not overcooked, but not spectacular either, and the goat cheese in tomato sauce was fine. If you ask for their signature tapa (jamon Iberico), they give you a cheap salty serrano ham instead. I asked to see the Iberico ham package (leg) but they refused. I liked everything that we ordered, even though there was not much of it. Some of the pickled things were so tiny and minuscule they were a waste of mouth energy just chewing. Maybe this is a fun place to go when someone else is paying; it is a pretty poor value considering all we had were drinks and some small items.  We might have ordered something else, but the kitchen was so slow neither of us wanted to wait another 45 minutes for a small plate of sausages or gambas. Four or five stars are beyond me. I have a problem when we, a party of two are over $100 and several plates into our meal and aren't even remotely half full. The service was good, but we got the look of ""that's it?"" when we decided to cut our losses short and stopped ordering dishes.  I've been to Spain, I know what tapas should be, and sure some items were appetizing but barely enough to share.  I'm embarrassed to say that we stopped ordering, walked out hungry and continued to walk until we got to ""Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse""... at the other end of the strip and had a second dinner and much more satisfying. If you feel like blowing money, do yourself a favor spend 5 bucks at the taco place. Then throw the rest of your money in the air and wave bye bye to it. I guarantee you that it will make you feel better than throwing your money here. I'm not a cheap skate, I know good food and I also know when I'm getting ripped off and the flavors are not astounding.",0.9822,0.79,0.137,0.074,0.5433091787439615

Luckily the dining area doesn't smell, but the fish market smell is not appetizing at all. On a Saturday night, the paellas take over an hour to make. Why would I come to a restaurant to wait over an hour for half the items on the menu? I might as well save money and make something at home in less than an hour. The best thing I tried is the spicy potatoes. Please don't order any dishes with shrimp. Their shrimp is disgusting! The shrimp they serve is probably the source of the fish market smell when you walk in. There are a few restaurants in Chicago that don't source their shrimp from fresh sources, and this is one of them. I don't think they cleaned the guts out of the shrimp before cooking. I thought the octopus was ok, but the others in my party didn't like it. The chicken also wasn't appetizing.

Why am I docking 1 star (if I could, I'd probably dock 1.5 stars)?  When you first walk in, there is a horrible, musty smell that just doesn't put you in the best eating mood.  It's because the kitchen is located adjacent to the entrance.  Also, the interior is pretty dated.  Finally, I was not overly impressed with the sangria.  The first time I went there it tasted extremely watered down.  The other times I have tried it, it tasted better, but I was expecting a lot more since I had heard such great things about their sangria.

2015-08-31,4.0,"I sought out a Spanish restaurant for dinner because I was craving paella and this one claims to be the largest and most authentic outside of Spain. The interior is homey--nice, but not fancy. We went a little early because they don't take reservations and it was mostly families there. We got a nice table by the window and service was efficient, if not overly personable.  We started by sharing a cazuela de carne: slow roasted beef with potatoes and carrot in a clay pot. We were really hungry and this comfort food made our mouths and tummies so happy! The beef was meltingly tender as were the vegetables and it all had so much flavor. That is a dish I will crave again on a cold night in the future.  We then shared a seafood paella which was good, but didn't match up to what I've eaten in Barcelona. The rice got a bit crusty around the edges (here, a good thing), but not in the bottom of the pan so was a bit one-note texturally. It had nice saffron color and flavor though. The seafood wasn't as plentiful as I would have wished, but it was a pretty good dish overall.  We were originally interested in ordering and sharing multiple tapas, but this isn't really the place for that unless you have a large party. Each tapa is larger and more expensive than would be practical for 2 people to share--think ""family style"" side dish portion.  I would go back in a heartbeat for more of the cazuela de carne and think it would also be a good place to come with a large family or group of friends to share the large tapas dishes.",0.9969,0.79,0.21,0.0,0.4722098214285714

Next thing I noticed: it was incredibly loud. Me and my BF found it difficult to even talk from across the table, since it was so loud. If you enjoy a more lively, louder crowd, this place it great. If you enjoy a quitter, more intimate/romantic place, skip this restaurant. Moving on the service, our waiter explained the menu and then disappeared for about 20mins, we eventually asked a busboy to find him and bring him back because we were staving and ready to order! The great thing was, once we finally ordered, our food and drinks arrived in less than 10 minutes! The sangria was excellent, it's prepared very traditionally and was an excellent complement to the meal. Next, the food. We had three tapas. It was difficult to choose because everything in the menu looked great! The tapas range from about $8-$13, I found these prices reasonable for the quality of the food (although don't expect large portions, it's tapas, after all). The calamari was very good! Not the best I've ever had, but it was fresh and delicious. Next we had pinchos de pollo, grilled chicken on a stick served with saffron rice and caramelized onions. This was excellent. It reminded me of food I had in Puerto Rico it tasted incredibly fresh, we both loved this dish. Lastly we had grilled octopus served over sliced potatoes. I would avoid this dish. The potatoes has literally no seasoning or sauce whatsoever, making the dish very bland. Even though the octopus still seemed fresh, the overall taste of the dish was super disappointing, especially when compared to the quality of the other two dishes. Overall, it was fun to try a tapas place and the quality of ingredients at this restaurant is top notch.

I had a perfectly decent Manhattan for after dinner, and I tried a little of my date's flan, which was spot on and not too sweet.

2015-04-19,2.0,"Cafe iberico is very well known in Chicago for its tapas. Not really sure why it's so popular however.  It's average at best. There are so many other amazing tapas places in the city or in surrounding suburbs.  It takes about a good 45 mins to an hour just to get seated. It takes another 30-40 mins to get your food from when you place the order. Then it takes about a good 15-20 mins to get your check after you are done with your meal because the server is too busy with all the other tables to notice what's going on. The servers I may add work very hard to put in the orders quickly, but things run slow, because of how crowded they are at all times. If you call ahead they let you know that after a certain time you can't make a reservations, you can just walk in and you will have a 20 min wait. What a lie lie lie, they only tell you that so you get to the restaurant tsk tsk, not nice. You walk into what should be their bar area, but because they are so incredibly crowded it's more of a waiting area while your table is ready in what feels like forever.  The floors in the lobby area are just gross. They are old, have dirty on them, the grout is ancient and filthy, they should really consider looking at rehabbing the place to look up to date and clean. It's not very appetizing to see that.  The parking is ok, you might have to drive around a few times if you are parking yourself, but they do have valet, or you can pay a premium for parking lots in the area. Let's talk about the food. It's not as authentic as I would have hoped.  The rice is rice-a-roni, it definitely tastes like it's from a box. The chicken isn't exactly tasty like other places. I'm not even sure that it's marinated with anything as it tasted like it was just sautéed.  The presentation of the food is nice, but it lacks in flavor or it just tastes weird, nothing special and a little skeptical of some flavors.",0.9705,0.815,0.124,0.061,0.5795448792400012

I know normally this restaurant does not take reservations but upon our arrival it was nice that they prepared a table for us. Maybe it has to be a very large group or I'm not sure what exactly got us an actual reservation but glad we did.  We had many tapas including many names that have slipped my mind. The first one we had was a bread with a tomato like spread on top that sat on slices of bruschetta and a slide of cheese which was my absolute favorite of the night. It was so good we ordered another round of it. We also got a toasted cheese dish which was good. It had bread with something green spread on it and you spread the toasted cheese that sat in a pool of a red tomato sauce on top of the bread. I am a fan of all things cheese. We also ordered octopus that was cooked well. The omelette we ordered came in the form that I liken to a slice of cake. It was layered in a wedge shape with potato, egg, cheese and some herbs. It was very good and even when it cooled off it still tasted great. I typically can't stand cold eggs.  The atmosphere of this restaurant was another big win in my books because there was not a high volume of restaurant noise which made for an amazing night of real conversations that didn't require us to scream over each other.

What I absolutely LOVE about this dish is the rice+raisins. It is subtle, moist and fragrant. Goes perfectly with the dates. #2 Paella Iberica (served with seafood, chicken and pork) Large portion, so definitely order to share Other dishes I've tried but wasn't blown away about: - Pulpo a la Plancha (grilled octopus with potatoes and olive oil): The octopus is grilled wonderfully but the potatoes don't really work for me. Feels like soggy fries.  - Salmon Ahumado (smoked salmon with capers and fresh dill cream sauce): This seems like a spinoff from your regular smoked salmon bagel. Doesn't strike me as a particularly Spanish dish but I may be wrong... - Champinones a la Plancha (grilled mushrooms with garlic and olive oil): Just very regular mushrooms to me...

White sangria was the way we decided to start our night.  Get s pitcher of sangria to share is better than getting a cup each. Most people go for the red, but we decided to go for the white. White sangria tasted more refreshing and sweeter than the red. Depending on how you want to start the night... long you wanna last for the night... you can choose your color of sangria accordingly.

The potato had perfect amount of seasoning... Yummolicious is the way to describe this dish. Seafood Paella: make sure you order this right away as you decide on other dishes. It takes about 40 minutes for this dish to cook. It's amazing both the rice and the seafood are cooked perfectly. The rice tender but not soggy while the seafood were not overcooked and chewy.  Dessert - strawberry crepe: omg so good and so deliciously. The strawberry was fresh made i think. The sourness and tartness of the strawberry goes perfectly with the sweetness of the ice-creme.

Went here with friends and tried several different dishes, each of which are detailed below: Tortilla - this was very flavorful and a good sized portion, one, fed four adults Datiles con Jamon - pretty good, they were a little over cooked and the goat cheese they were stuffed with was a bit strong.  The rice they were served with was delicious. Patatas Bravas - these potatoes were boiled where as I preferred fried, but the bravas sauce was very good with a good spice level. Champinones a la Plancha - this dish was very good, a quality mix of mushrooms, perfectly cooked with a good pronounced garlic flavor. Croquetas de Pollo - these were decent, good flavor but a little dry. Empanada - we had the beef version and it was very tasty, good balance of flavors. Gambas al Ajillo - this dish missed the mark as the shrimp were way overcooked Jamon Iberico - this dish was not what I was expecting.  Typically when you order Jamon Iberico, with no other description, one would expect high quality, hand carved pieces of jamon.  This on the other hand was not that.  It was jamon, but certainly was not the highest quality version. It reminded me of a cut that was a couple notches above serrano. The tomato bread that it was served with was tasty. Raxo Adobado - this dish was thin cutlets of pork that were simply grilled, served with an onion / herb slaw and thin french fries, simply and tasty. Paella Iberica - this dish was pretty good, but again the shrimp were over cooked and the paella was made with long grain rice instead of bomba, which made a real difference in texture. For desert we had the Peras al Vino, Filloa de Helado y Crema, Chocolate Mouse and a special chocolate bread pudding.  Everyone of these deserts were absolutely amazing...amazing.",0.9967,0.791,0.188,0.021,0.5433831672203767

We found him near the entrance and mentioned the 2 events that had happened. Again, the manager seemed completely unapologetic, like these things are common and we shouldn't really be complaining about it.

I gave this place a second chance because my boyfriend's boss was raving about it, even though I had no distinctly fond memories, except of the octopus. I want to preface my qualifications to judge this ""authentic"" food with the fact that I've had tapas in Spain and also I have taste buds. First off, it's like they recently discovered salt and a deep fryer and can't get enough of it. ""Papas"" just means french fries in which they hide the relatively yummy (though overcooked) morsels of octopus which I was really excited about. The mussels had clearly not been cleaned so I got complimentary sand with that dish. The ""patatas bravas"" were over cooked & dry & boring. I don't even remember the clams, so that tells you all about that. We didn't order the paella because my boyfriend is allergic to shrimp and I had gotten it during my last visit and OD'ed on sodium. The sangria was a very sad excuse for what is normally a glorious beverage. The only fruit in it was orange and apple (that I could tell) which was mush, indistinguishable from canned fruit. I don't want to be overly harsh. Clearly this place has a fantastic fan following and, sure, it's fun and reasonably priced. But would I eat here again?

We weren't hungry, but just wanted to try it out so we just ordered the potatoes (fries) and grilled octopus and the seafood paella.  The octopus was a nice surprise as it's served on a wooden platter with cut up octopus pieces that were not chewy and pretty easy to eat!  We enjoyed it with ketchup even though it might have been a sin.   The seafood paella came a little bit later because it takes longer to cook.  I found that it was pretty salty.  Like borderline send it back salty.  The saving grace was that we were given bread so I just ate the paella with the bread and kinda picked off the top.  Flavour was good, just too much salt.  Service was fine - nothing too special.

My favorite go-to dishes there is the garlic potato salad, the goat cheese baked in marinara sauce, iberico ham and of course their sangria . This potato salad is oh so creamy, garlicky, and even more garlicky! I do recommend brushing your teeth after this or your breath will be able to ward off vampires easily. The goat cheese baked in marinara is just amazeballs! It is savory, salty and strong tasting that you spread on your bread...you will probably eat all the bread with this and  forget you are watching your carbs!

I have to say this is my biggest complaint about our experience, because at 7 pm on a Friday night, we were shouting at each other over the thumpingly loud music and other diners.  So instead of using our mouths to talk, we set out instead to stuff them with baked goat cheese, ensalada de pollo, raxo adobado, paella, and one dish on special featuring fried mussels (yum!). Only the raxo adobado would I recommend passing on for an alternative. The sangria was just as good the second time around - though nothing beats Dominicks of Ann Arbor. Prices overall are pretty fair, not too pricey. I will also say I actually appreciate the no reservation policy to keep this restaurant as a good last minute dining option.

But I did my best to note the various small plates that were coming across, and the ones I did catch were very good. I'm noting the ones I can remember below: Jamon Iberico, a.k.a. everyone's favorite Iberian ham and manchego cheese combination. The manchego was good, with a bit less bite than I remember. Likewise, I don't think anything beats actually eating this cut of ham in Spain. But the tomato bread was excellent; almost like a tomato jelly spread over the slices of bread. Patatas Bravas - One of the ""must haves"" here. Potatoes in a hot, thick sauce. More than a dash of cayenne. The potatoes were one of my favorite dishes. Pulpo a la Gallega (Octopus, Galician style) - my favorite small plate. The octopus was sliced thin, briny and remarkably tender. Likewise with the thin-sliced potato. This is a very simple plate, which is what I felt made it work the best. Calamares Fritos - decent battered and fried calamari. The tomato sauce was decent. Otherwise it was what you would expect. We also split a couple of pitchers of sangria, which here is made with apples and lemons. I'm not a sangria fan but thought it was OK. Overall, not a bad reflection of Spanish cuisine.

Having visiting other tapas restaurants we knew going in what kind of dishes we would like and what we wanted to try, but after ordering everything there wasn't one single tapas plate we actually enjoyed. The spicy potatoes tastes like they came from a bag of frozen, store bought breakfast potatoes with some sauce from a can poured over the top. The grilled shrimp with garlic was overcooked, and again tasted as though it was frozen. And the stemmed muscles lacked flavor and again freshness. The paella was the only dish we were able to finish, and I think that was mostly from the fact that I was so hungry from not eating anything else that I needed to finally have something. The prices were just okay, but for what we got they were not good at all. I tried it once but won't go back again. If you're thinking of the tapas route in Chicago, there's plenty of much better places. I wouldn't come back here.",0.9747,0.869,0.111,0.02,0.5385416666666667

Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious. Service was attentive and consistent throughout our meal. I loved all the tapas we ordered, especially the goat cheese dish and the jamon iberico. The restaurant was about half full on a week night, and was a good environment to chat with friends without it being too loud.  I guess considering this restaurant is in River North, I was expecting a little bit more of a trendier/classier vibe, given it's location. This restaurant is definitely more homey/authentic than Cafe BaBaReeba. I'd have to say I prefer BaBaReeba over Iberico (better/larger menu, more interesting vibe). Also, there is quite a distinct odor when you walk into the front bar area. I'm not sure if this was related to food sitting out in glass display cases, but it smelled faintly of rotten food right when you walk in.

We started off the night with 2 pitchers of sangria - 1 white and 1 red and I much preferred the white one because it was more refreshing and fruity. For food, we decided to order jamon iberico (ham), gambas al ajillo (shrimp), pulpo a la plancha (octopus), vieiras a la plancha (grilled sea scallops), and the paella iberica. Everything was so delicious with my favorites being the scallops and shrimp! The saffron sauce that came with the scallops was great mixed with the rice and scallops and I loved the marinade of the shrimp. For my birthday dessert, they gave me a free platano al caramel and it came out in a very X-rated arrangement, which my friends and I found hilarious (1 banana, 2 scoops of ice cream - you get the picture).  Overall, it was a fun and yummy birthday dinner and I would definitely recommend Café Iberico for get togethers if you go during the week or don't mind not being able to make reservations on the weekend.

You will not find any $15 tapas plates that has just enough food to feed a new born baby here. Instead, you will find extremely reasonably priced plates ($8-12) consisting of authentic, Spanish comfort food that can actually be shared between a large party of people. I came to Café Iberico at 6pm on a Saturday with a group of 9, and was shown to our seats in their downstairs section. The upstairs had limited seating, mostly meant for smaller parties and those making a beeline for the bar. The downstairs is much more intimate, and is more accommodating towards large parties. Between the 9 of us, we each ordered a plate and 2 pitchers of Sangria. The Sangria was nothing special, but the food was great.  I liked just about everything we got, but my favorites were definitely the grilled mushrooms with garlic and olive oil, beef tenderloin skewer with fries and onions, clams with shallots and parsley, seafood paella (takes a while to make though. ~40 minutes), and sautéed chicken breast with green and black olives.  But honestly, you can't go wrong with any of their dishes. Do come with a big group so you can all get something different and experience something new.  Also, the location is awesome!

I've been with out of town friends who don't want to spend any money. I've been with my boyfriend, when we have no money. I've been with my sister, because we have no money (do you see the trend here).

However, if you're on a budget, but still want to have a nice time out--go to a restaurant where you can feel like you're spending a good amount of money, but you're not (ha!)--this is a wonderful, solid choice.  A couple of must haves: Sangria, half pitcher for one, full pitcher for two (ok, not for real, but hey, it's cheap and delicious), queso de cabra (I have a friend who will fight you for this if you go with her), paella (this is really big), and the octopus with potatoes (polpette con papas?). If it's just me and a friend, I usually get a half pitcher (or full pitcher) of Sangria, one of the paellas, and any of the other items. It's plenty of food and delicious. The atmosphere is great for chatting and catching up, too--especially if you get the paella because it takes close to an hour to make.

Number one thing is check on customers, seeing how everything is in the beginning. Our waiter waited until the end of our dinner to ask that. We asked for dessert. This time he waited for our dessert and served it to us personally. From what I've seen the busboys' would do that for him. They were more attentive to the customers with picking up plates and serving food from the kitchen.  I decided to not low ball him on his tip because it was almost $48. We gave him $5. I judged him for serves not how well the food was. I could give him $3 because that's what the serves was to me as a customer.

Much less if you aren't drinking alcohol.   The portions are decently sized -- perfect for four people -- so if you want to try a lot of items, I would recommend going with more than just one other person.

Since we are successful working gals, we decide to wine and dine ourselves. Wine and dine we did indeed. We were seated immediately without a reservation. We sat in the main dining room, apparently they had a Cafe Iberico express in the front part of the restaurant. Kind of like a point and get food selection from a food display. seems like a great concept.  We ordered the white sangria to get the juices flowing. I loved the taste of it but I felt like it was a bit watered down because of the ice.  We then ordered the Artichoke salad. I am a huge fan of artichoke and I was not disappointed. it is served with fresh artichokes marinated with sherry balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. We then had this combination platter of Spanish sausages, totally yummy with the breads they serve you. I mean how can you hate sausages. All tasted differently, but all very delicious and cooked to perfection. And if you didn't think we were full yet, then you guessed right because we ordered this seafood paella made with shrimp, fish, clams, and other seafood in a special saffron broth. Which was the best dish of the night. The seafood was not over cooked and plentiful. the rice just was so infused with flavor, with a little lemon over it was the icing on the cak.....err-paella.

2013-10-14,4.0,"INTRODUCTION I've been to many tapas places, but they are usually holes in the wall.  Iberico was HUGE by any comparison.  So many rooms and floors I easily could have gotten lost if left to my own devices.  I also went on a weekend so it was mobbed.  However, the staff is clearly very well prepared for crowds so we had excellent, fast, and courteous service the entire evening.  DRINKS We had both the red and white sangria.  The red was a bit tart for me and very strong.  The white was equally strong but a bit sweeter. FOOD Largely hit or miss, which is typical for tapas joints, and mostly due to my own personal taste.  I felt the grilled and fried options were considerably more flavorful than the cold options.  Particularly the calamari, mushrooms, goat cheese marinara, and chorizo dishes were excellent.  The cold seafood dish was very underseasoned and the charcuterie plate was not easily shareable so those were my least favorite. AMBIANCE The place is massive and very loud.  But I knew about the loudness coming in so I was OK with it.  90s music videos on the screens.  Sparsely decorated on the upper floors.  The lower floors are much more tasteful.  Plenty of room on the tables for the plates and most of the dishes were easy to share.   CONCLUSION A FUN time!

I'm told that a lot of folks from Spain in Chicago swear by it. Atmosphere is nice, approachable and not at all pretentious. Some restaurants might take a place like this and move it a couple blocks east (off LaSalle) to be able to price things through the roof. I like that they haven't done that.

2013-08-31,4.0,"We had dinner here last night. Cafe Iberico is one of my favorite places for tapas. They are very tasty, reasonably priced and have good variety. A tip is to order the paella first as it will take some time for it to cook.  Meanwhile, have tapas while you wait. We had the Cafe Iberico paella and the seafood paella. Both are pretty similar (the Cafe Iberico has pork and chicken in addition to the seafood). For tapas we had three calamari/squid dishes, the croquettes (a must try), and two orders of bacon wrapped dates. We probably should have ordered more variety, but this (along with the paella) was enough for five people. We did not have sangria or alcohol, and so for five, our bill came out to about $22 per person (that's with tax and tip included)! Valet parking is an additional $12 plus gratuity. This is a great place for groups--the atmosphere is lively and energetic, and there is plenty of group seating.",0.9622,0.889,0.111,0.0,0.5714285714285714
2013-08-29,3.0,"My friends and I were craving some tapas and sangria on a warm summer night, and came calling at Cafe Iberico to get our fix!  We arrived a little after 6 on a Wednsday and were seated immediately, in fact we were the only people in our section which felt a bit awkward.  But within 30 minutes people were trickling in and the place was full and bustling by 7.  So don't eat early like a grandma unless you want to be the only people in a quiet restaurant! They had about a zillion specials which our server read off a paper and did not explain with tremendous clarity, but maybe that's just because of the white sangria.  Sangria was okay, the fruit didn't impart too much flavor so it was more like wine on ice, but it was still refreshing.   We ordered what we thought was a modest amount of food but when the plates came we realized that this isn't your ordinary tapas joint - these portions are BIG!  I've never seen patatas bravas piled so high!  The patatatas (typo and it stays) were very spicy and coated in a thick tomato sauce.  They were okay, a bit saucy for me and I've had better incarnations elsewhere.   One of our favorites was on the specials menu - a scallop dish with rice, crispy almonds, and an orange sauce (not orange fruit, orange colored).  The scallops were cooked beautifully and the rice/almond pilaf was delish and had just the right texture.   We also got some gambas al ajillo (shrimp with olive oil, garlic, and wine) and it was just okay.  Not much flavor from seasoning, just a dominant shrimpy taste, and not in a pleasant way.  The shrimp were small and twisty-shaped instead of the proud, big, toothsome ones you want.  Forgettable.   The baked goat cheese was the next star after the scallops - hot, soft, creamy goat cheese in the center of a luscious tomato sauce, and crispy garlic toasts alongside (supplemented by the basket of crusty bread with a soft interior).  Nothing not to love about this. We got a salad for good measure, the Ensalada Mixta, which was very big and had asparagus, beets, hearts of palm, and other treats with endive and a light, creamy dressing.  Pretty good salad actually, and a nice way to get your veggies in during the meal.  Not enough ""stuff"" amongst the lettuce, those little beets were tiny treasures! We also ordered baked rice and chorizo, but they forgot about it and cleared our plates and brought the check - then brought the chorizo.  We had realized they'd forgotten it but decided not to remind them because we were too full!  They did take it off the bill - we'd have of course managed to eat it if they brought it during the meal instead of after but since they forgot and we were settled into being ""finished"" we just couldn't.   The meal was only about $80 with tip.  All of that for $20 a person is not a bad deal at all, so your money goes a long way here (since the portions are large).  However there's just nothing special about it.  Average atmosphere (TVs showing sports in the restaurant section, not just the bar, no thanks), below-average service, average sangria, and average tapas.  Even the standouts, the scallops and goat cheese, weren't like, amazing.  They were the way I expected/hoped all the food would be!  Just really well-executed, simple dishes.  Alas.  You'll do fine here and fill up, but there are way better places to get tapas in Chicago. BTdubs, reservations only for parties of 6+.  According to the menu they don't split the check but I don't know if that's true.",0.9904,0.844,0.107,0.049,0.5436291486291487

I had to edit after I went to La Tasca, another Spanish Tapas restaurant, in Arlington Heights.  Café Iberico can take some pointers from La Tasca when it comes to service!  Almost thought about down-grading this to two-stars, but the food does it make it worth it for three-stars.  I probably will never go back, because I'm sure I can find another Spanish tapas in the city with better service and atmosphere.",0.9674,0.855,0.135,0.01,0.5632323232323231

Mussels - wow this was delicious, first time ordering this but i'll keep getting this here now. steamed in great broth, good size mussles and good size dish, the type you want to  keep soaking bread into the size type of dish Special Paella of the week - pork ribs - eh won't get again. we tried the special menu pork ribs paella. it was missing some flavor, very oily rice and not much salt or flavor. ribs were so so , oily again. Drinks: sangria, sangria sangria! They have it by the glass, half pitcher, and full pitcher. obvious the latter the best price. half pitcher was plenty for two of us. great sangria, not too sweet, but not too strong either.  Too full for dessert... Service:  Not the best, they are always super busy and we went on a weekday. we called ahead to see what the wait was, and she said none, so we walked in 5 minutes later and she told us 20 minute wait. A little odd, and felt fooled. They have a waiting system where you stand around in the bar and your name will be prompted on the tv screens. When our name was called we flagged the hostess and she barely acknowledged us and told us to follow her about another two minutes after that. it was weird. waiter was attentive, and fast, nothing to right home or complain about.

The calamari and the marinated pork were not bad.  The paella (Iberico) was below average; I think one of the specials we had, a large chicken empanada, was not bad but not killer.  On a Thursday evening at 9 PM, the place was crazy loud, but that's easy because large tables are seated very close to each other, so I spent a solid hour yelling at my four dining companions in order to be heard.

Two of us arrived first, after 10 minutes,  another member of the group arrived, and then after about 20 minutes, the final three of our party arrived. The place wasn't that busy, but the restaurant immediately annoyed us by refusing to seat a partial party. Perhaps this is a sound policy of theirs for busy times, but when the restaurant is not busy, it's rude and off-putting. Indeed, the service was slightly substandard. Although the waitstaff was helpful and offered some good tapas suggestions, little things were amiss such as a shortage of serviettes (cheap paper ones at that), the prompt refilling of water and the periodically late arrival of individual dishes (eg we ordered Gazpacho soup, beef skewers, clams, mussels and lamb in a third round of tapas, but the soup arrived inexplicably late, only slightly before we were ordering desert). All in all the tapas was average: goat cheese and a heavy-handed tomato sauce, mussels, clams (both fine), shrimps (fine but the dish was removed too quickly), lamb chops (excellent and perfectly cooked), beef skewers (over-cooked but with excellent caramelized onions), grilled octopus with fries (octopus in tiny over-cooked chunks), and empanadas (excellent).  On the whole, I'd probably suggest just giving it a miss.

The red sangria was strong but otherwise lacked any good flavor.   My wife felt the mussels had a funky smell and the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese had not taste what so ever.  Even the Jamon Iberico wasn't very good.

The good service is the only reason I didn't give this place 1 star. The seafood paella was just bad. It was flavorless and the rice was undercooked. The ham and chicken croquettes were not bad but there was way too much sauce on the plate and they dunked the croquettes in the mediocre sauce. The calamari was meh...nothing special. The 3 roasted peppers with bread was good...my favorite thing we had. The beef brisket was the special of the night and that was also good. The flan was probably one of the worst flans I have had in a long time...the texture was not smooth. The beef skewers were not tender, but did have decent flavor. The veal empandas were aiite but again, nothing special (crust was meh). Also I was disappointed that u have to sit at the bar to order the pintox!! That makes no sense.

I don't understand also when people say go out to other restaurants, chicago has so many good ones, I tried to do that go to the ""better restaurants"" I always felt ripped off, many times walking out hungry, disappointed from lack of flavors and not so clean. Iberico fulfills all my requirements for a restaurant. I'll admit it is extremely loud but don't forget it is a younger crowd usually. Everything is so clean, from dishes, glasses, utensils and bathrooms. Everything I had there is so flavorful and reasonably priced. And since we're such regulars there I've noticed it is also consistent, never disappointing. Just went to yesterday to a restaurant that had almost 5 stars on yelp and couldn't find one flavorful thing that I can order again next time. Also went to the signature room in january and 400$ later everything was so blend. Here I love everything from their saffron rice scallops to   goat cheese marinara, ham wrapped dates, quail paella, grilled octopus ( I never had such soft octopus anywhere). I go a lot to tapas restaurant as I love tapas instead of just having a piece of fish or meat with 2 sides, and by far this is the best. Either you get the cold or hot tappas they're all good. Also I've noticed everywhere that if you ask the waiter for recommendation and they say it's good I take it, if they say I haven't tried it I learned not to order that. Their desserts are really good too especially their specials if you get bored with the ones from the menu. The restaurant I mentioned that had 5 starts here didn't have one decent desert choice.

2013-05-12,3.0,"Found this place thanks for the chicago yelpers. The place was pretty packed. Food: We had 5 people and we ordered about 6 tapas and the paella iberico-  special paella of the restaurant.  I was disappointed  with the paella ..  Very moist and very limited amount on the seafood... the size of the paella, it truly lacked a lot of the seafood.  In addition, the chicken and sausage was too dry and rubbery in the paella.  Ordered the chorizo tapas,  jamon iberico,  Plato mixto, croquetas, mushroom, and calamari tapas.  The best ones were croquetas , plato mixto, jamon iberico and calamari.  The other ones were presented well, but the chorizos were overcooked, and there were any ham in the jamon one.  Anyhow, overall food was okay. 3/5 Service: it was about 15 min and we had to watch our names on the TV to come up to be seated.  Once we were seated,  we saw the waiter every 15 min.  No refills on water and no checking on us to see if we needed something until we actually called him.  He was pretty mediocre for a buy place with a good population.  His name was Francisco provided such poor quality service.  It was weird how the restaurant couldn't split the check for us. I had to manually calculated all 5 people shares.  2/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 nice and very well decorated.  It is 3 story place.  It has a nice cozy Hispanic atmosphere.  But the tables were a bit too close.   Overall, tapas portion are a bit too big but that is why they were over priced.  It is not your typical tapas style. I would come back to try their other tapas but not paella.  I was just too disappointed because it looked sooo good but it turned out to be very mediocre.",0.9477,0.822,0.117,0.06,0.5453917050691245

I don't like over-hyped restaurants. 3. The amount of mixed reviews on Yelp.  Well, as you can see, my gut feeling was right. We had (and sorry I don't know the actual dish names because I didn't order the food): 1. Seafood paella - This was my first paella ever. I was not impressed at all. It tasted like fluffy minute rice meaning there was no flavor, no kick, no life to the dish!  2. Octopus paella (this was on the mini, special menu) - This was tasted worse, like mushy minute rice. 3. Spicy potatoes with tomato sauce - I thought it would be like marinara or spaghetti sauce. Boy was I wrong. It tasted like steamed potatoes that were covered in spicy, warm, unsweetened ketchup. Weird.  4. Croquettes - They looked like little mini, pinky finger-sized cheese sticks from the freezer aisle in Costco. I refused to try one because we got only five for $10 (ridiculous!!!) and the general census at the table was that they were not good. They also did not look appetizing. 5. Some kind of octopus tapa with fries - It tasted like burnt. That was my first and only impression because I didn't take another bite. 6. The ONLY THING I LIKED: the scallop tapa (from the specials of the day, non-menu thing). BUT. They cut the scallops so thin and presented them on steamed, bland, mushy potatoes to LOOK like they were nice, fat pieces of scallop............. 7. Sangria - It was good. You can't really mess up sangria though.. 8. We probably had more, but...my memory fails me, and this review is already too long. This place was SO loud even though there was nobody there when we went in.  I couldn't understand a word the waiter said because of the noise and his accent (nothing against that, but the combination didn't help). He also kept rushing us to order and made me feel very anxious because of that. Considering I went to Purple Pig the night before and paid almost the same amount, I would NOT recommend this place...

There are signs of kabobs, etc. from a previous restaurant in the space that failed-odd.  Service was ok. I also noticed that the prices have went up and the food simply does not justify the prices.  Overall, this place, for whatever reason, has went down hill and is not longer a viable option for me.

2013-02-07,4.0,"I've been here twice for tapas now.  While I have yet to check out babariba or whatever it's called, this seems like a good time to yelp one of ""the"" tapas bars of Chicago. The short of it: SAY YES TO SEAFOOD AND SANGRIA. The long of it: Great for groups of 2 to 12 and probably more than that.  With twelve, we each had a little bite of each tapas, which made our dinner feel like an awesome cocktail party.  With three, we each had a good little plate of each dish, which made dinner feel more like a tasting course.  Either way is yummmy and fun! Start with pitchers of sangria: each has about six glasses in it.  The red is a light version of the traditional sangria, while the white tastes like an alcoholic Capri-Sun.  I love Capri-Sun so I loved the white sangria. While you're deciding on your tapas, they bring you plates of bread, which you dip in the awesomely peppery and fruity olive oil.  But don't fill up on the bread, tempting as it may be.  Two tapas per person seems about right, a bit less if you're ordering a paella (which you should order first because it takes 35 minutes to make to order.  Also because it's delicious.) Things we really liked: MUSSELS in marinara sauce.  This is a relatively huge portion of mussels in a great broth.  You'll want to keep the pot for dipping your bread in later.  Best dish I've had. OCTOPUS with fries, grilled (fried?)  A friend says he sees people come in and just order these with sangria.  The octopus is slightly chewy, well seasoned, and the fries complement it well.  Another good sized portion. SQUID: I think this was a special.  Great! Other things we also liked: PAELLA: seafood paella is bomb.  It also feeds about 6 people comfortably.  So much flavor in the juicy rice, and the little mussels and other seafood are great. SHRIMP: garlic shrimp, a classic.  Tasty but not very special. GRILLED FISH: I have no idea what fish was ordered.  This was similar to the shrimp. JAMON Iberico, served with Manchego and some tomato toasts.  Delicious and simple. Other people liked these but I thought they were just OK-good: Baked goat cheese: the one at Piece is better.  Served with little garlic butter toasts. Garlic mushrooms: the ones at Sultan's are better.  A little boat of mushrooms that just aren't garlicky enough. Scallops: surprising to be down here, but the preparation didn't take advantage of the scallop.  I like this dish, in fact I recommend this dish: it's a bed of rice with the fried scallops and a mayo-y spicy sauce on top.  I just really love scallops, and I thought the sauce overpowered them. Lamb chop: a little tough.  It's like a pot roast in there, and the onions and potatoes and sauce are tasty.  But meh. This place is also very fast at bringing out your food, which makes it a fun and slightly overwhelming experience.  Experiment with your orders and all will be well (especially if you say yes to seafood and sangria).  Way easy to get to via the Chicago bus (#66, stop at Lasalle) or the brown line.",0.998,0.791,0.187,0.021,0.5205989689323024

At the time we were eating, we were told that they weren't taking any. Started with an ensalata mixta, which was good - I liked the asparagus and hearts of palm for a little variety. From there the olives (which were...olives, right? Not bad, but nothing special about them) and the jamon iberico, which was very good. I love jamon iberico ,and it was served with good manchego cheese on chewy bread. Our patatas bravas were very good, crispy potatoes in outstanding spicy tomato sauce, and corquetas de pollo were good, although not especially flavorful. The pulpo a la plancha was interesting - grilled tasty octopus served with what were basically french fries. I like this, but then, I like the texture of octopus. If you don't, then you might want to avoid. A late addition to the meal was an order of the chorizo y morcilla, which I didn't have much of, but what little I had was tasty. Finally, we had two paella, the iberica and vegetariana. Both were good, in decent portions. The iberica was my favorite, since I love the seafood/sausage/chicken combo, but the vegetable one was also good, with a pretty good mix of veggies that had stayed crisp and weren't cooked to death. Noise level certainly gets high was the evening progresses, I will say that.

2013-01-26,2.0,"I have been to Cafe Iberico many times over the years.  And, many times over the years I've waited for at least 1 1/2 hours to get a table.  I've sent many of out of town visitors to Iberico for the great food at very reasonable prices as well.  Last night, however, may have been my last visit and I will likely never recommend it again.   We were very excited there wasn't a wait at 7:30 on a Friday night.  My husband and I were quickly seated and we were very happy.  The server came over and we ordered drinks which he promptly brought.  We ordered goat cheese, dates, olives and a veggie empanada.  The olives arrived quickly and 10 minutes later the dates.  However, the goat cheese and empanada were no where to be found.  The olives were just okay and the dates were burnt and tasteless.  The rice with the dates wasn't seasoned.   We flagged down our server to order the octopus, mussels and ribs which he wrote down and was gone.  He didn't ask us if we'd like another drink (which we would have since we were childless for the weekend - yay!) and didn't check to ensure we had received our entire order. The mussels, octopus and ribs came out quickly but still no goat cheese nor empanada.  The mussels were plentiful and the sauce was tasty.  The octopus has always been a favorite but was greasy and not seasoned.  We flagged down the server again and told him the goat cheese and empanada had never arrived (over 30 minutes later).  He quickly left - again not asking us about drinks - and didn't give us an opportunity to even order another round.  The goat cheese and empanada came to the table minutes later but they were cold and unappetizing.  The goat cheese wasn't even warm and the toasts were hard.  The empanada probably would have been really good had it not been ice cold.  The server never checked back with us.  We had to flag him down to get the check.   Overall, the food was not flavorful, not well seasoned and not appetizing.  The service was mediocre at best.  Very disappointing that an old faithful is no longer going to be on my list.  There are too many other restaurants in the city that will fill my tapas craving.  Cafe Iberico is mailing it in.",0.9614,0.87,0.086,0.044,0.4887901234567902

2013-01-07,4.0,"I came here on two separate occasions within three weeks.  One cold, windy Sunday evening, I decided to play tour guide and take my from-out-of-the country friend to dinner. We ordered half a pitcher of sangria with white wine, queso de cabra, pulpo a la plancha, and almejas en salsa verde. We loved every dish but I particularly enjoyed the baked goat cheese and clams. The baked goat cheese paired well with the basil sauced bread and complimentary bread. The clams were fresh and enticing. I loved the sauce so much that I even dipped my bread in it. With tip and tax, dinner came within $50.  My second occasion was for a friend's birthday on a Thursday evening. Our party of five ordered two pitchers of sangria with white wine, avocado and salad dressed with balsamic vinaigrette, pulpo a la plancha, ensalada rusa, croquetas de pollo, gambas al ajillo, raxo adobada, and vieras a la plancha. Now in English terms...my favorites were the avocado and salad, octopus with fries, and chicken and ham croquettes. The avocado and octopus are on the softer end of the flavor invasion. The croquettes were melt-in-your-mouth type of good. But I don't think I would've known it was chicken and ham had I not look at the menu. I loved the ali-oli sauce that it came with! My least favorite dish was the raxo (marinated pork loin). The meat was very thinly sliced and pan-fried to cardboard texture. It lacked flavor and the toughness gave my jaws a good work out.  Dinner for five with tip and tax came within $135.  Service was great: nothing was forgotten, dropped, and/or cancelled.

I realize I tend to rate places based on service, and this is not only because I am a server, but also because I believe that the most important part of your experience at a restaurant is the hospitality. This man was quite rude. It's my friend's birthday. She was told on the phone when she made the reservation that she would be given a free birthday dessert. We brought to the server's (named David M) attention that it was put on the bill. Instead of getting a manager, he argued with my friend, and said ""ask any server here, we don't give stuff for free."" He then walked away and pointed at our table while laughing and telling his coworkers about our dessert b.s. He came back to the table about 8 minutes later to inform us that he charged $132.00 on a card we asked to have charged only $30.00. Pay attention! I can't stand this crap. He went back to void everything and start over, and wound up charging the $30.00 to the card TWICE! We asked to speak to the manager and he asked for a credit card to fix the mistake. We asked again for the manager and he asked again for the card. The birthday girl then said ""here's an idea, GO GET THE MANAGER!"" He went and got the manager and he handled the situation... Sort of. He explained what happened, which we already fricken knew. He wound up taking 50 bucks off our bill after we had to ASK for some sort of resolution, which after discount was still $302.00. If you're spending that much money at a restaurant, you damn well better get the best fricken service you have EVER gotten. I was really disappointed.

2012-11-15,3.0,"We had a lovely meal here for a friend's bachelorette/pre-wedding night meal! The restaurant was spacious, the service friendly & fast, and the food good. * JAMON IBERICO - 3.5 stars yelp.com/biz_photos/café… (Spanish style cured ham with manchego cheese and tomato bread) The tomato spread was tangy and fresh, the bread's crust had a nice crunch but was quite soggy on top. The cheese & ham were placed separately, under the bread, which made this a little more difficult to share with such a big group. * PATATAS BRAVAS - 3 stars yelp.com/biz_photos/café… (Spicy potatoes with special tomato sauce) Pretty tasty, but for all the fanfare around this dish, I was a little underwhelmed. The flavors were strong and savory, not so much spicy. My biggest quip with this dish was that the potatoes were not at all crispy! More like soupy. Not what I think of texture-wise when I think of patatas bravas. * Rice with bacon wrapped dates - 4 stars yelp.com/biz_photos/café… You can pretty much never go wrong when bacon+dates go together. The rice was tasty but a little undercooked and hard. * CROQUETAS DE POLLO - 3 stars yelp.com/biz_photos/café… (Chicken and ham puffs served with ali-oli sauce.) A little oily, and the outer breaded layer is a little thin - I like just a little more crunch. I found the filling to really not be much protein, even if it was fairly tasty. * CHAMPIÑONES A LA PLANCHA - 3 stars yelp.com/biz_photos/café… (Grilled mushrooms with garlic and olive oil) A solid dish, but I'm just not too big of a fan of pure mushroom - the flavor is so strong that it really is better as a side/addition to something else. * GAMBAS AL AJILLO - 3.5 stars yelp.com/biz_photos/café… (Grilled shrimp with olive oil, garlic and wine) Garlic-y! Tasty! Crunch! Fresh! P.S. Don't get this if you have any sort of adversity to garlic. * QUESO DE CABRA - 4 stars yelp.com/biz_photos/café… (Baked goat cheese with fresh tomato basil sauce) So simple, yet I really liked this one. The bread was lightly toasted and had just a hint of a pesto/garlic spread. The warm tomato sauce and cheese tasted great when you added it on top. * VIEIRAS A LA PLANCHA - 3.5 stars yelp.com/biz_photos/café… (Grilled sea scallops with saffron sauce) One of the more unique dishes of the night! The scallops were seared lightly, though in my humble opinion could be a tiny bit more on the rare side. The rice was cooked thoroughly (in contrast to the bacon wrapped dates) and soggy, which I actually enjoyed in this saffron sauce! * PLATANO AL CARAMELO - 3 stars yelp.com/biz_photos/café… (Sautéed banana with caramel sauce served with vanilla ice cream) Haha - you have to see the picture. Like I said.. bachelorette party. I thought it was hilarious that they would do this for us (or is it standard? I wasn't sure). Not the most unique desserts, but I always like cold+hot components together. The caramelized banana was almost too sweet, even for my major sweet tooth.

2012-11-14,1.0,"This place has so much wrong with it that it's hard to know where to start.  -bad service,  -dirty, slippery wet floors  -average at best food, quite bland -sangria made with orange soda pop served out of trash cans surrounded by fruit flies -disorganized Some of the things it has going for it is a good wine list, but everything comes from a cellar which reaches over 90 degrees in the summer, so you're just paying for baked wine. Also, the pulpo is good, but prices have skyrocketed, so not worth it. And it would helped if they tried seasoning their food- more paprika, pepper, salt and try using more saffron in the dishes! I'm not sure why so many people like this place, but they need to try better Spanish food: I'd do Emilio's, Gitana or Mercat for REAL traditional tapas and Tavernita & Mercadito for small plates.

We came just minutes after the restaurant was scheduled to open and was pleasantly surprised to see how empty it was. No wait? Fine by me! Seafood Bruschetta -- We ordered an appetizer which seemed to be a special, not a regular on the menu. Each lightly toasted crouton had a certain item (seafood or cheese) with a red bell pepper on time and melted cheese. Everything was jiving. I was fortunate enough to get the crouton that had the salmon. Salmon is hard to cook. Definitely wasn't dry. On the fishy side but the melted cheese helped! Pollo a la Brasa -- A half-roasted chicken with red mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes was covered in a delicious gravy-like sauce. Very creamy and thick. A great side! We had to fight for the last of it. The chicken was roasted to perfection. Very tender and easy to cut and serve. You also get two pieces of asparagus and a tomato cut in half. Make sure you dip the asparagus in the gravy sauce!  Paella Marinera -- Iberico has two types of Paella. Option 1: Strictly seafood Option 2: Seafood with meat. A traditional dish made with a distinctly deep pan. Iberico's paella consisted of Spanish rice, shrimp, fish, clams, squid and peas all slowly cooked in a wonderful saffron broth. They give you tons of seafood. Absolutely wonderful! I highly recommend it. This was easily shared amongst 4 starving ladies. WORD TO THE WARNING: ALLOW 30-40 MINUTES. It's slow-cooked people so it's going to take time. It's totally worth the wait! Make sure you order their sangria to end the meal! It's very strong. ;)",0.995,0.724,0.215,0.061,0.5610222832722832

And about that food, I wish we brought a bigger collection of people to try even more dishes, but a couple of the highlights of the meal were certainly the chicken croquettes with spicy aioli and of course the (big!) paella with everything.

My friend and I stopped here for lunch on our way to Lollapalooza. First of all, we didn't receive a single judging look for our less-than-appropriate outfits, so mad for the staff's composure there. We were sat promptly in their cafeteria-like dining area and barely had to wait a minute before the pitcher of sangria (decent, but not the best I've ever had) we ordered was on our table. Great service! We immediately jumped into our food order, which consisted of patatas bravas, croquetas de pollo, pulpo a la plancha, and the paella iberica. Their menu is so extensive that whittling down our order to those four dishes was probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Luckily, we made the right decisions -- everything was great. The patatas bravas were roughly the size of a small mountain. They were seasoned well, but a little overfried. The croquettes were good, but nothing remarkable; the croquettes at Porto's in LA are still the best I've ever had. The octopus was fantastic -- perfectly charred and seasoned, and atop a bed of deliciously soggy fries, I could've eaten three orders of those. By the time the paella came around we didn't have any more room in our stomachs (this seems to be a disturbing trend for me). It was good, but it tasted a little generic -- almost like something you'd make from a box.

I came here with a group of girls after work for happy hour.  We sat down and it was NOT crowded but took the waiter 15 minutes to take our order from the point of getting our water.  When i got there my water had flakes of something floating in it and they replaced the cup. When we got our bread and oil I found broken glass and a bug on my plate with oil but was still really signed on to eating there.  I called a waiter over and told him what happened and he rolled his eyes at me and angrily grabbed my plate.  He came back and plopped another one down not even apologizing or showing concern. (this guy wasn't OUR waiter which I understand might have been why he was upset but still not  acceptable) I pulled a manager aside to explain the situation and she apologized but walked away from a table with 4 empty sangria glasses...didn't even ask what she could do to help.  Our waiter dropped the check and yelled ""sorry for my rudeness!!!!"" Wow. Nice. This wasn't even the waiter who rolled his eyes about the broken glass.  We explained that we spoke to the manager about the other waiter and he was still rude to us.  Nothing was done to remedy the situation or apologize except more rudeness. I have been here before and the food was great but I cannot believe that a place that is so popular would think it was okay to treat their customers this way.  I will absolutely think twice about coming back here and warn others to be wary.",0.9316,0.77,0.131,0.098,0.5876068376068376

I remember the garlic shrimp tasting better-there were only a few tiny shrimp in an almost flavorless sauce. They forgot one of our tapas and presentation of the dishes was lackluster.  What really put me over the edge last night was that it took our waitress 30 minutes(I timed it) to bring back our check after we had given her our credit cards. She kept telling us to wait.

With that, I know I am not misguided in saying that the quail paella I tried was poorly executed. You could barely taste the saffron, the bottom of the rice did not form a little bit of a crust (which is not just a cosmetic thing, but which actually is reflected in the rice on top) and then the dish was someone's revenge extrapolated to me, as it was served cold. The food/price ratio was extremely high for a tapas place (both for the courses called entree and the tapas themselves), and that usually reflects poorly on the quality of the food, as it did at Ibérico. The saving grace was the mixed salad with endives, asparragus, cherry tomatoes and heart palms (but that is not very representative of tapas). Oh, and the tortilla española was actually good.  The sangría had only orange slices and no other fruits, but it tasted good and was refreshing.

We got 2 pitchers of the red sangria and it was good---not the best I have ever had but tasty nonetheless. FOOD: Cold Tapas- Garden salad-pretty much exactly what you expect  Potato salad-very very good, enough garlic that it had a serious bite to it, we all really liked it Hot Tapas- Goat Cheese-Fantastic, as good as I have ever had Garlic Shrimp-only so so, better quality of shrimp not cooked for so long would have been better.  It wasn't gross or bad tasting just not meeting potential. Salmon-pretty good but watch out if you don't like your salmon well done as it was a bit crispy on parts.  I like that, so it was good for me. Calamari-my friend said that it was good but I don't eat calamari so I can't say for sure.  It looked like it was supposed to look. Mixed Paella- the one with seafood and chicken (we skipped the pork).  This was solid and did not take as long as they said it would to come out. Dessert- Crepe filled with ice cream-The ice cream was good but the crepe ended up being a weird texture due to the freezing.  I know its more work to fill the crepe upon it being ordered, but it would have been a much better dessert that way.  Current preparation is killing the texture. Tiramisu type thing-I forget the name of it but it is described on the menu as a tiramisu type dessert so we will go with that.  It was really good.  Basic for sure, but definitely delivered on flavor. Note on the service: I notice that Cafe Iberico is getting slammed in some reviews.  I had a good experience.  We were seated right away, the server was very friendly and attentive.  It was loud, but generally speaking tapas restaurants are--so no big deal for me there.  It was Thursday night at 7pm--our food all came out at the right time and we had no complaints.",0.9959,0.723,0.197,0.08,0.5567943409247756

2012-07-16,2.0,"This used to be one of my favorite tapas places in Chicago, so when my parents came to town to visit, my husband and I decided to take them there. Last time we came to Iberico was probably half a year ago, and they were usually busy on a Saturday, so when we were seated right away, I was thinking, oh it's off to a good start! I couldn't have been more wrong. We waited 10 minutes for water, another 10min for someone to get us drinks, another 10min to order food, by the time we ordered food, I felt like I was too hungry to complain. And the thing was, they weren't even half full!  Their sangria was as good as I remembered, but the food was kinda inconsistent. We had the potato omelette, salami plate, grilled mushroom, octopus, sauteed cod (off the special menu), and the seafood paella.  The omelette and salami plates were good, but I guess you can't really mess up potatoes/egg or cured meat. However, the octopus used to be my all time favorite from Iberico, and this time it was missing some serious seasoning. Not sure if they changed chef or they just forgot to put salt on the plate, but the dish was really NOT that good. I could read it off my parents' face, they were probably thinking ""I could cook octopus better than this""...  What else? The dessert. I used to LOVE their crepe, so I had to have it. I am not complaining about the filling, which was just vanilla ice cream. But the crepe was lumpy, stale, and can't even be cut open with my fork. I can mentally picture Gordon Ramsay spits it out and goes ""this is the worst crepe I've ever tasted"" if it were made by one of the Master Chef contestants. It was neither airy nor fluffy, it tasted like it had been living in the fridge for the past 3 days... Oh did I mention they also conveniently forgot to give us bread and olive oil from the start? Not like we really needed it by the time we were done with octopus, but at least they should have the curtsey to ASK.  I was hugely disappointed at Iberico.

We orders the grilled octopus with fries, mussels in marinara sauce and cold pork loin with spaghetti. The cold pork loin wasn't very good. I wouldn't order it ever again. It was swimming in olive oil. The mussels were good but they were very small. Practically the same size as clams! Also, it does not come in a typical marinara sauce. It's more of a creamy tomato sauce. It was very good with bread. The star of the meal was definitely the grilled octopus. Delicious and not too chewy. The sangria was good, but I think it's better at Cafe Ba Ba Bareeba.  Service was sorely lacking, which is disappointing.

Pros: Phenomenal food for the price, and cheap pitchers of sangria. I had the Paella Marinera -- it was pretty good, but I don't think I'd recommend it. It could use a little more kick to it. However, my boyfriend had the Pollo a La Brasa, which was seriously the best chicken I've ever had in my life. I made fun of him for ordering chicken, and I really am not a big chicken fan. I was wrong -- it was outstanding. The chicken was so moist and soaked in delicious juices. The mashed potatoes were delicious and had a unique taste to them. Also, it was huge for the price. It was enough for several people. The Platano al Caramelo for dessert was delicious and cheap. Tip: Order the Pollo a La Brasa.",0.9871,0.715,0.225,0.06,0.6996913580246912

This place is just okay. It wasn't horrible, but I've definitely had much better tapas before. Maybe it was going to Spain and having real tapas that spoiled me, but none of the dishes really wowed me. The sangria was alright, the server was mostly on top of his game (although a bit disconnected and rushed most of the time), and the noise level wasn't too bad. The only thing I would really have to throw a fit about is that they only have Manchego on one of the tapas. ONE! What kind of Spanish tapas joint doesn't have Manchego on practically every dish!? They didn't even have a cheese plate or anything! The whole place could use some more creative dishes and a slight attitude adjustment.",0.9882,0.783,0.217,0.0,0.563888888888889

I had a feeling something was missing, so instead of asking if we still wanted it, the food was instead brought out with to go bags... like I want to bring home goat cheese crostinis home, NO. The second time I went my friend asked me there for lunch and I reluctantly went... and honestly, the only thing that stands out from that meal was this hotdog looking thing that  had a mushy texture and I don't like that... and the scallops, which were actually good.  The last thing that I have to say is, when I went for lunch, the place was empty like two or three tables in the middle were full and then one table by the window with two men... and if you have been there you know the dining area is huge... so we get sat right by these two men who are trying to negotiate with the manager the whole time about a catering order and the price and if they will or will not deliver to the location and which food they would be able to order and on and on and on and on and 40 min later... they didn't even order anything and I am pretty sure they went there for free samples or something...

2012-06-26,2.0,"""I love Cafe Iberico so much!  It reminds me so much of a restaurant I went to along Las Ramblas in Barcelona/ Playa d'en Bossa in Ibiza/ Gran Via in Madrid!"" - Someone I would like to smack upside the head. Let's start with the wine list, one of the restaurant's (relatively speaking) strong points.  Most of the wine is from some of the large bodegas and household names in Spain - Marques de Caceres, Muga, and Martin Codax.  Because the restaurant is run and managed by Galicians, it was really nice to see a strong representation of Albarino wine and surprisingly enough, Estrella Galicia (the beer that we pretty much drink like water). [1] While we waited the typical 35-40 minutes for our paella to be prepared, we nibbled on olives to offset any effects of the  Albarino we were drinking.  The paella finally arrived - except I wouldn't really consider it paella.  Not only is the type of rice used incorrect [2] but rather than using saffron as a seasoning and coloring agent, it was pretty apparent that tumeric was used.  Although the seafood in the paella was fine, the rice was bland and flavorless and undercooked at parts of the bottom of the pan. For dessert, we shared the filloas, which were a lot more decadent than anything I'm accustomed to.  The crepe at Cafe Iberico is filled with both strawberry sauce AND ice cream.  And it was gigantic.  Dessert was fine, but it definitely wasn't anything like some of the airy, just slightly sweet filloas you can find at an outdoor festival. If Cafe Iberico serves the ""most authentic"" Spanish food in all of Chicago, then I'd hate to see what the competition is up to. [1] We came back to watch El Clasico here and enjoy a few Estrella Galicia beers at the bar.  A very lively atmosphere considering Cafe Iberico is a restaurant and not a sports bar.  We were mostly in the company of Barca fans though.

Service: Went there after reading on yelp, a girl led us to the table, gave us the menu and said she will be right with us. After we got the menu I specifically asked for a cup of hot water, she said yes and then never came back. We sat right next to the cash counter! She walks around us all the time and didnt care to ask if we are ready to order or bring the water. We had to call another waiter who doesnt speak very fluent English,long story short, we ordered several tapas(small portion) and ended up having a main course for one of them! We said we didnt order this one and he said yes you did. I told him that I am pretty sure about what I ordered. He seemed really pissed, took the plate, turned his back to me and walked away when I was trying to order sth more. I was really unhappy!!! Food: We didnt order wines, so cant comment on that. What I can say is that we ordered the signature dish(forget its name but it is a big pan of fried rice with some seafood on it which takes 45 mins) . It is tasteless!!!!It is just fried rice with some shrimps! Everyone can cook it! I can be chef for it!! The other dish we ordered is a pot of broth muscles, tasteless as well. So disappointing.

I heard the Tapas here was resonably priced and the quality was great for the money. I found quite the opposite however. The beef dish I ordered was small and way over priced. A bite of skirt steak for $8 are they crazy. I can get a whole skirt steak at any greek resturant and it would have been better quality and a much bigger portion for the money. I also ordered the goat cheese which was quite good. They only gave me a few pieces of garlic bread and when I asked for more they actually charged me $3. Seriously... The service here was also a bit on the slow side and I feel our refills were ignored because we didn't order Alcohol.

2012-04-21,5.0,"All I really have to say for this place is that it was definitely an awesome Yelp find. I wanted to meet up with a friend I hadn't seen in a long time but since he had been living in Chicago a bit, I told him he had to make the pick. We ended up coming here which was an excellent choice. Forgive the picture quality however; the lighting was dim. We started off with the patatas bravas which were potatoes covered in a spicy tomato sauce. There was something just oh-so-smooth but firm about the texture that made the potatoes work. The sauce had a great spicy kick to it that intensified by the folds as you ate more; one minute you're having a good time and the next, you've hit it up a notch with the heat. They were excellent. Next tapas that came out was the queso de cabra which was baked goat cheese with a tomato basil sauce to top on some bread. That goat cheese was amazingly creamy and smooth. I don't know what magic wonders they worked on that cheese but it was so silky in my mouth, I wanted to just eat the whole thing. Altogether, the plate reminded us of a spin on bruschetta. Classic. The best tapas of the night was the pulpo a la plancha. We have to thank Yelp for that heads-up. It was grilled octopus with potatoes and olive oil. Amazing. The grilled octopus had a fantastic texture, and the charred part spoke volumes about the quality of the grill and technique. So much flavor packed into the seafood parts and the potatoes were a nice pair. Everything was garlicky in that I-need-more kind of way. Everyone loved this dish. Out next came the paella iberica which the waiter kindly told us to order ahead of time so we could get it on time; it was its own medley of seafood (mussels and clams), pork, chicken, peas, carrots, and rice in saffron sauce. I've got to say that it wasn't all too fantastic in my book and fairly basic. However, it wasn't bad; the rice was a good texture and consistency instead of mushy and the meats were plentiful. Perhaps I'm not a paella person? The last dish was their braised beef short ribs in mashed potatoes (it was a weekly special so I don't remember the official name). The beef peeled away from the bone beautifully and nearly melted in my mouth. So rich and creamy, the short ribs were fantastic. They were also bedded on some of the creamiest and heaviest mashed potatoes I've ever had. We definitely would've had more of it if we had the stomach real estate! Our drinks of choice were glasses of sangria from a shared pitcher. Quite delicious indeed! I'd love to come back here for some quick eats if I lived in the area.",0.999,0.795,0.205,0.0,0.575967261904762
2012-04-19,2.0,"Cafe Iberico, you disappoint me.  I keep returning, usually at the behest of friends, and I always hope for the best.  I tell myself, ""Maybe this time it will be different.""  But, sadly, my hopes are always dashed, as was the case the other night. Although quite affordable, the food tends to be hit or miss.  Some of the items I have had have been fantastic, which is why I am giving two stars instead of one.  The mussels are very good, as are the scallops, and the stuffed dates were absolutely delicious.  Other items, however, have been mediocre (the garlic mushrooms and the baked goat cheese were nothing to write home about) or extremely disappointing (the seafood paella was bland and overcooked with very little seafood - I don't know why I expected better). The true downfall of Cafe Iberico is the truly horrible service.  Not only is it incredibly slow, but I have never had a server manage to get the table's order correct.  Every trip to Iberico entails missing items (for which you will be billed) or wrong items (for which you will be billed).  Most recently, the olive plate my table ordered never got to us, two of the people in the party never got their drinks, and they brought us the wrong type of paella.  We would have alerted our server, had we been able to find her.  We were finally able to flag down another server, who, instead of correcting the mistakes, brought us the check and said that if we were going to complain about things, then we needed to pay and leave.  Sadly, in my experience, this is to be expected.",-0.8821,0.808,0.081,0.111,0.6293869731800766

I've heard lots of great things about their food and really wanted to try it for a while now. We were seated immediately, but it was surprisingly crowded for a late Sunday evening dinner. Unfortunately, we were seated right next to a very rowdy crowd of club goers that were in the process of being over served.  After several minutes of waiting, our waiter finally came to our table to take our drink order. That really set the tone for the service, lots of waiting around for our waiter. I had to ask other service staff for our waiter at least twice b/c we were waiting so long.  At the end of the meal my husband ordered a cappuccino that he never received. Poor service is a huge pet peeve of mine.  The only reason I gave this place three stars is b/c of the food. It was super good! It's a shame that the service blew.

2012-04-08,3.0,"Fia R and I came to this tapas bar in search for a Spanish fare. The décor encompassed two floors that started with the bar area, plenty of TVs, dim lighting, sectional dining areas, and dark wood and red bricks that overlapped our surroundings. We were seated at the bottom floor. The vibe was casual and the noise level was high.  We started off with the Jamon Ibirico ($8.50) that came with four pieces of bread topped with minced tomato, manchego cheese, and thinly sliced cured ham. The bread they used was the same as those in the basket that was complimentary for every table. The cheese had good flavor, but it also dominated the cured ham that tasted lackluster. The dish was rather filling and not something I'd like to have again. Next, we had the Pulpo A LA Plancha ($8.75). It was presented with an assortment of seafood that included shrimp, squid, scallop, and white fish. The dish was covered in French fries that anchored this dish in a deep garlic flavor. There were some nice depths to the flavors, but the amount of French fries seemed to overwhelm the tiny pieces of seafood. I probably would have enjoyed this dish more had the potatoes was authentically fire roasted. It's not a dish that I would recommend either. Lastly, we shared the Seafood Paella ($12.95). It came with the same mix of seafood steeped in rice and a flavorful broth. The rice was a little soggier than expected, but the ensemble of flavors was passable, especially the seafood and peas. I find their prices to be affordable and the portions were satisfactory.  Service was nonchalant and not particularly friendly. Our water was refilled several times and the server did come back to check on us regularly. However, I wished the dishes could be (re)introduced when they were delivered to the table. I also wished the server had taken the initiative to discuss the menu since this was our first visit.

2012-04-01,2.0,"You get what you pay for, first of all, and I came to the downtown location with reservations after seeing the reviews all over the map, and I think this is a very fair and balanced review after I'd flipped through 2 pages of reviews and scoured the quick tips.  First, this place is quite affordable for tapas, that should speak for itself and the expectations you want to set. For 5 of us, dinner food + tax + tip came to around $15 each and then some of us got sangria. Don't come to an affordable place with hundreds of seats and then expect that the waiters are going to catch every fork you drop. That being said, the low level of service here is entertaining. We sat right by a dish station so we heard lots of clattering. Our waiter nearly spilled sangria on us as he poured, gave us 4 plates instead of 5, and one of them was dirty. However, look at the big picture. The restaurant is packed. There's usually a bit of a wait for tables. The upfront bar is narrowly designed WITH seating so you create a traffic flow problem. The seats on the main floor are cramped and the conversation is so loud I can barely hear myself talk. Do you expect waiters to walk with grace or be able to notice every person's needs? Probably not. Even so, for the prices I was paying, the service is still subpar, which is dragging this review down to a 2. Quality of food: Don't expect it to be 5-star, however, I'd give the food 3 stars, and that is why I'm so perplexed why this place gets so packed. Then, perhaps many of you do not know what real amazing paella should taste like, and having visited Barcelona, I guess my taste buds were spoiled. Again, for a conveniently located restaurant, with affordable prices, high turnover, huge number of dining guests, expect mediocre food. My friend recommended the PULPO A LA PLANCHA (grilled octopus) and I squirmed eating it. I'm always a little hesitant to eat seafood from a casual restaurant in the midwest, and this one the texture was not crispy all the way through - in fact, some pieces of octopus were downright mushy. However, I did like the potatoes. We also ordered PINCHO DE SOLOMILLO (beef tenderloin skewer). The beef was decent, but I think the winner here were the caramelized onions. For entrees we tried the Paella Iberica (allow for time). As far as paellas go, this is low-quality to mediocre. The rice is bland, bits of protein are scarce, and I was hoping for more saffron to come through but I guess they were being stingy. My favorite dish of the whole night was actually the POLLO A LA ANDALUZA (sauteed chicken breast with green and black olives). The chicken was tender and cooked all the way through (thank goodness), and I was impressed withe complexity of the sauce. On the whole this was the one dish which I felt was worth having again. The ambiance about this place is a whole other level of crazy. I sat facing the large TV monitor that played cheesy low-budget high-makeout music videos all night long - kid friendly? natch. Even one of the waiters noticed us making fun of the videos and said, ""we have a lot of bad videos for you to watch!"" I thought he was pretty funny. However, I did not like the ambiance either. Compared to most other tapas places I go to on the east coast (there you go - I'm pretentious), this place was too loud, too big, too hurtful on the eyes. I'm just not sure if the ambiance was ever intentional or someone dreamed it up as a joke one day, and if so, well, I was definitely entertained.",0.9924,0.84,0.114,0.046,0.592650519978106

We walked in at 7PM on a Saturday with no wait (excellent!), but were lead to the dining area upstairs that was crowded with families selecting dishes from laminated photo menus (not so excellent).  My small table of three didn't get to try many dishes, but it seems that the menu is rather hit or miss. I've never had a so-so dish at Cafe Babareeba, so I may have been expecting the same savory yumminess. We had the scallops, the Duck Salad, the pork tenderloin with fries, and the lamb and beef tenderloin skewers. The service was attentive and fast and all the dishes came quickly. Strangely, they all were a little on the cold side. I really enjoyed the scallops, but I loved the duck. The salad that the duck was on top of wasn't particularly interesting, but the duck was very tender and flavorful. The pork was overdone and accompanied by a very oniony relish and bland fries. The skewers were as expected and came with a small serving of roasted potatoes.  The sangria is pretty standard, unlike the creative sangrias at Babareeba.The caipirinha was rather small for $9. Iberico seems like it would be ideal for a larger party and I might come back with a big group, but only if I wasn't able to get a reservation elsewhere.

I think we were geniuses.  The place embodies Spanish tapas bars except for the fact that there were not toothpicks all over the floor. The big TVs blaring,  the tapas on the bar as you walk back to the tables-  with people hunkered over deep in loud conversations ,  the checked table clothes, the menu with pictures.   I felt like I had literally been dropped back in Madrid.  We ordered several pitchers of Sangria,  and then started ordering food,  more food and more food and more food.  I have no idea what all we ate - but the seafood paella knocked my socks off.  Everyone had such a great time!   The servers were fast and patient,  the food was great -  I came home with enough chicken to feed myself for a week. FABULOUS.   And the best part for you penny pincher's out there - 11 people ,  more food than you can imagine,  3 pitchers of Sangria and the whole bill came to about $200.  Amazing.  Plus all those folks from places that aren't Chicago loved it.  A good time,  no a GREAT time was had by all.  Yippee!",0.9916,0.793,0.161,0.046,0.5

They have those displayed along with the prices at the bar. So you can pick out what you like an order. Also waiters will walk around with samples. It also gets pretty loud becaus everyone's having a good time. So if you want a quiet dinner probably this is not the place. We had a big group of ppl. So we ordred a couple of sangria pitchers and tons of tapas. I pretty much lost count of what we ate but everything was good.

Dining at Iberico last Friday, the manager on duty tried to charge me for a dish that was NOT what I ordered.  I ordered a seafood paella (that took 60 minutes to make), and a veggie paella came out.  After letting the waitress know, she went back to the manager and they said they would comp the paella.  Then as we leave, the paella was charged on the bill and the manager was ADAMANT we pay for it since we picked at it.  After an unpleasant conversation with the manager whom wasn't the least bit apologetic, I asked for her boss, to which her response was ""I AM the boss"".  Please.  She wouldn't be able to run a taco bell cash register if her life depended on it.   In the end, she took it off the bill, threw the leftovers out instead of letting us take it (poor bums).  And I will never be back to Iberico again.  Go Tapas Valencia!",-0.8236,0.829,0.067,0.105,0.41944444444444445

We went as a group and got to sample quite a few dishes  highlight: paella -- solid! very flavorful with all the goodiness of clam and pork fuse with the rice underneath bacon wrapped date-- this is my must-have whenever I see it. So far I love Iberico's the best! Bacon is much less greasy and the date is not soaked with honey, which are common mistakes seen with this dish sangria- we got the one with red wines and asked for a second pitcher!! Don't have to say more about how much we enjoyed it grilled mushroom - didn't know mushroom can be this tasty! They are tiny little cute goodiness in a metal pot. the gravy is flavorful, but not too heavy. Well done! Spanish sausage platter-- on par with Publican's sausages. better yet, Iberico grill their sausage to have a charred skin and tender inside. Can't ask for more :) nah:  grilled octopus with fries? really? can you think of something less lame?  beef tenderloin with potato and baby carrot-- I admit beef is not the strong suite of a Spanish restaurant.

Tapas are a fun way to eat, plus I love that many restaurants now provide small plate menus. Great way to sample a lot of good food.  Cafe Iberico has a premium location. Their interior is really nice. It has a older Spanish feel too it, the ceilings are really low, and it's nicely lit. The bar is really cool too. Loud and full of great energy.  Their Tapas speak loudly about the tradition, cuisine, and history of Spain. FOR THE COLD: Ensalada Mixta, Rusta, and De Pimientos are nice veggies to have on the table during your meal. Jamon Iberico is also a nice snacking plate to have during your experience. The Salpicon de Marisco is one of my favorite things to eat, not just here, but anywhere. Love me a good mix seafood salad.  FOR THE HOT: Queso de Cabra's a nice way to transition from the cold tapas. Who don't love some warm goat cheese on toasted bread??? The grilled Pulpo(octopus), Calamares (squid), or Vieiras (scallop) a La Plancha are a must order. Tapas at their finest hour. For meats, you cant go wrong with the Chorizo Y Morcilla, Raxo Adobado, or Pincho de Sollomillo. Cafe Iberico is good traditional tapas in a hot location. As many said, it gets busy.

2012-01-31,3.0,"It's been a while since I've been at Iberico, but it's a regular spot for my entire family, and I'm pretty familiar with the menu. Iberico is definitely one of Chicago's go to Tapas restaurants, but I'll be honest, I'm not sure why. The location is awesome, the ambiance is different, a little more hipster than anything, but the food is a little above average. The patatas bravas were drowning in sauce, which is usually a good thing for me as I love any dish with tons of flavor, but this one was lacking. The sauce lacked depth, and had kind of an overpowering chorizo and acidic tomatoey taste that I didn't care for. The queso de cabra was wonderful, I'll give them that. Goat cheese usually is spectacular at every Spanish tapas restaurant. The gambas al ajillo were good, but I've had better. Their sausage tapa with chorizo and blood sausage is one of the better dishes almost anywhere though. And as everyone else mentions, the Sangria is top notch, and I'm not really a Sangria or wine person. The paella from Iberico, definitely deserves it's little section though. I've had all types, and all are actually very delicious, with fresh ingredients, and perfectly cooked rice. I'm a big fan of the seafood paella, as they load it up with clams, octopus, squid, shrimp, and lobster if I'm not mistaken. The last time I was there, my brother was getting a little adventurous and decided to choose the Paella Negra which he's had before. It's basically paella with squid and maybe octopus, but it's hard to tell since they take the ink from the squid, and finish the dish off completely, hence the name 'negra'. It was good, aside from the presentation, the dish was just completely black, it was actually pretty tasty. The ink is very subtle and mild, and once you get over the thought of eating it and the color, it's a good change of pace from the usual. I really enjoy the flan here. It's perfectly made as they've been doing it for years, and the caramel sauce has a very nice distinct flavor. The service is unspectacular, but it's expected with the amount of traffic they receive on a daily basis. It is also pretty loud, so if you're looking for a more quiet or romantic dinner, I'd suggest a different place.  I'm giving Iberico a 3/5, as it's a solid go-to Tapas location in the city, but definitely not the best. I would recommend making Cafe BaBaReeba your first stop at a Tapas location, and then go to Iberico and compare for yourself.

As she was getting our check, I asked if the restaurant did anything for birthdays. She said ""of course."" She then brought out a slice of chocolate cake with a candle in it. She later brought the bill and charged me $5.50 for the birthday dessert. I could not believe it. She should have told me that there was a charge for a birthday celebration or at least asked what the guest of honor would like if we were going to have to pay for it. She also obviously knew that we had not been to the restaurant before because we had asked her about the number of dishes to order, etc. when we arrived at the restaurant. I talked to the manager about this on the way out and he tried to explain that the restaurant only offers a candle for birthdays. I told him that the server should have told me that was the case rather than selecting a dessert herself and padding the check. He said that he would talk to her about it which I knew was BS because he didn't even bother to ask WHO our server was. Overall, this has got to be one of the worst dining experiences that we had in Chicago and I am so bummed that it happened on a birthday. Luckily we went to the Signature Lounge at the John Hancock Center after this and had a fabulous time there.

2012-01-02,4.0,"Highly regarded and often visited Cafe Iberico is my (and many others') choice for good tapas food in Chicago. They don't take reservations for parties less than six so wait times can get ugly on popular nights. But a long wait is usually a good sign and that remains true for Iberico. Also true to form for good tapas is a rowdy and sometimes overwhelming noise level from energetic groups. But the best part is that food good is consistently good without a complicated menu and a nice drink list. We ordered a whole lot of food (and some before I got to the table) so I won't try and recap each dish. The standouts included a calamrai & fries dish, a sausage and rice dish and two different beef plates - one with cheese and one on a skewer with fries. That doesn't leave many choices for the ""non-favorites"" like spicy potatoes or baked goat cheese but that doesn't mean they weren't good. Also, the red sangria we ordered was tasty and not as sweet as I remembered. Cafe Iberico remains one of the best (if not the best) tapas option in Chicago. The food is consistent and delicious and accompanied by nice drinks and good service and value.

Dinner consisted of Ternera Asada (Roasted veal served with raspberry vinaigrette) Queso de Cabra (Baked goat cheese) Spicy potatoes and Paella Marinera. The goat cheese and veal really stood out in particular. The goat cheese had great flavor, was creamy, and left you craving for more. The veal was served cold, sliced thin, and very tender with a unique flavoring due to the raspberry vinaigrette. It was quite good. The Paella Marinera was the least spectacular of the dishes. It was somewhat bland, overcooked  and didn't have the quality flavors of the other dishes. With so many other items on the menu, I would hesitate to order it again. For dessert we ordered a sautéed banana, drizzled with carmel. I am not a big dessert eater, but it was very good. It was a nice place, with great food and a good atmosphere.

Since '02 I've had tapas at other places inside and outside the city, many of which are great places for dinner. This time around, I couldn't believe the wait time, since they won't take reservations. After an hour plus at the overcrowded bar drinking, at best, average sangria, we headed to our table. The place was packed like a sardine can or cattle car. I figured I order my favorite type of meats; chicken, beef & shrimp. The rest of my friends and family ordered a few more tapas.  I have to say, the tapas did come out in portions and in good time. The quality of the food was good but the flavor of it is where I was greatly disappointed. The beef had minimal seasoning and was bland at best. Chicken wings was not far from the beef on taste an flavor. Grilled shrimp was good but digging it out of the shell like looking for gold was messy and killed my appetite. The potatoes in the spicy sauce were nothing more than baked potatoes in a Spanish ketchup. Not spicy at all. If you're looking for tapas in the city, there's other great spots where parking won't be an issue, wait time will be cut down and the sangria will be above average. The flat screens all over the place blasting Spanish pop tunes and Latin hoochie mamas along with the bling bling of the men with their pants halfway down their butts is a nuisance when trying to carry on a conversation with your party. Such a turn off for this type of place.

2011-11-09,5.0,"Based on my 20+ visits to Cafe Iberico, I can safely conclude - I LOVE this place!  It's very rare for me to say this but Cafe Iberico's atmosphere triumphs over the food. This place has everything for a good chillout zone - laid back, casual and stays open late. It's a perfect place for bringing a crowd of friends, co-workers for happy hour, date for an ice-breaker or family for fun evening.  Food & Drinks -  I have come across many tapas bars that are an epic failure when comes to sangria. I consider it an important part of a tapas meal. No good sangria, no returning customer! Cafe Iberico does a better job but just above average at the best. I, personally, enjoy consuming superfluous amounts of sangria per Cafe Iberico visit. It goes well with their atmosphere and sometimes, present company.  If that's not your thing, feel free to order a bottle of wine.  Food is good and meets expectations well (don't set expectation to what you may have eaten in Madrid) . Their tapas menu is fairly wide with a well-balanced selections between seafood, beef and chicken. They have a lot of the traditionally popular tapas recipes on the menu and then some of their own which fare well. Portions are generous for tapas size but you'll probably order a few rounds. If you are longing for something off-the-menu, ask their friendly serve staff. I have never been disappointed by their suggestions. If you are dessert person, skip the flan and ice-cream. Tip to first timers - order few tapas at a time. Keep the menu handy and order several rounds, if required. Their turnaround time is fast and keeps things fresh at the table.  Parking - its downtown. You may get lucky with metered parking otherwise they have reasonably priced valet service. 10-min walk from Chicago redline station.  Word of advice... be ready to wait on Fri-Sat evenings.

In fact, our waiter had only two or three tables and was never far away if we needed him. - Not as loud as we expected; I can definitely see how it would be very loud if all the tables were full, but that just wasn't the case last night. It seemed more like background noise, and we didn't really have trouble hearing one another. - Wine: I know you're supposed to get Sangria, but I really just can't deal with that much sugar. I love me a Rioja, and I really enjoyed the Atano (Antano?). And the pour was pretty stellar. I don't really want to say #losing, so maybe just #mediocre? - Food: Ok, so my gal pal raved about the paella. I'll give you this - it LOOKED beautiful and delish. But two things: one, the dish was not as deep as you would think for a $13 paella, and two, it just didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting. I went for the traditional tapas - patatas bravas (que rico! the sauce was a different consistency than I was expecting but it still made my belly happy), queso de cabra (good, but nothing over the top. I think I would have preferred that it was served with some marmelade instead of marinara sauce), and the plate of chorizo.

The service was pretty good, fairly attentive, but not fantastic. We sat down at the bar and had some Sangria (HIGHLY recommended!!) while we waited for a table. They have a neat system of displaying names on screens throughout the bar area underneath delightfully euro-trashy music videos when tables are ready, so you can just hang out and enjoy yourself and not have to listen for your name to be called or deal with one of those buzzing lighty uppy ""pager"" things. We ordered 3 tapas and one paella, with the tapas coming out at various times and the paella coming out at the end. All of the food was absolutely delicious, and after 2 half-pitchers of sangria and enough food for at least 3 people (or two very hungry people,) our bill was still only in the $60 range. How cool! Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the ambience being as fun and euro-trashy as it was, and with how inexpensive a bunch of really tasty food was! Great for vegetarians and carnivores alike, just make sure you're ready for some dancey music while you eat.",0.9962,0.769,0.211,0.02,0.5727609427609428
2011-10-25,4.0,"I went to Cafe Iberico with a friend for the first time a few months back. One of my best friends has been raving about it for years, but we never seemed to find time to go when we were in the city (now I live a few blocks away). It was a Friday around 5:30pm. It wasn't very busy (yet) and we were seated immediately upstairs.  We sampled the white and red sangria, both were very good and we ended up getting a pitcher of the red. We ordered the ENSALADA DE VEGETALES (season grilled vegggies marinated in a sherry vinagerette) and one of the specials (which I cannot remember). Both were very good. We definitely wanted to try some dessert so we got PERAS AL VINO (poached pears in red wine w/ ice cream)  and pLATANO DE CARAMELO (Sautéed banana with caramel sauce w/ vanilla ice cream). The desserts were DELICIOUS! We ate them in less than 5 minutes! I went back about a month or so ago with my boyfriend. This time we were seated downstairs and it was a bit later on a Friday (maybe 7ish). Still seated right away, but it was a bit louder downstairs. We ordered the Ensalada de Vegetales, PAELLA IBERICA (w/o seafood), some sort of spicy sausage tapa, and of course a pitcher of the red sangria. All very good (and no room for dessert). I'll definitely be going back again sometime....and this time I won't be too full for dessert!",0.9848,0.847,0.132,0.021,0.3006547619047619

You would think that they would put their heart and soul into this plate. The pallella had no flavor. The rice was watery and the seafood was limited.

There is now an actual tapas bar in the front of the restaurant where patrons can select the number of their item and have it delivered to the table. Meanwhile you still get a menu and can order items off the menu as well. I went with a group of four and two went to the front to order while I ordered items off the menu. Needless to say we got a few too many items. That would be a bad thing if everything was not out of this world delicious. Hands down the best items we ordered were the pulpo a la plancha (grilled octopus), fried mussels served on a half shell, the tortilla espanola and the garlic potatoes. We ordered too many items to list here but there was not a dud with any of them. Washed it all down with pitchers of white and red sangria. Total came to $40 per person with generous tip.

They also skimp on the croquetas I think- those things are too good to only get 5 :) We had the white sangria (a pitcher) and it was a great compliment to our food. I felt the prices were reasonable and it was a great place to sit and chat without feeling rushed at all!

2011-10-15,2.0,"My first reaction to this place is, terrible. But that would be unfair. The thing is, Cafe Iberico receives a lot of praise so you go in with high expectations and are disappointed that it doesn't live up to it. I think regulars have an attachment due to the ambiance or whatever sentimental reason and don't really judge it without bias.  I was taken there on Wednesday for my birthday and for one, it was waaaaaaaay too loud. The music was so loud the speakers were distorting and everyone in the restaurant was yelling over it to talk. Now, I don't mind loud places, in fact I love them, but this was waaaaay too loud. I mean is it a club or a cafe?  The food came quick and hot but the meat was unseasoned and the sauces were not helping. Now, the food was not bad overall, we had pinchos of chicken and steak, some goat cheese dip thing, a squid and fries thing, a smoked salmon dish, patatas bravas and maybe something else. It was all prepared fine, just not great. Average, especially for downtown. This is more of a neighborhood place. Good thing is they don't charge downtown prices.  Nice mixed crowd. A few snobs but it is downtown. Nice decor but I could do without the R rated Euro movie playing on the screens that showed full frontals of a man and woman. I like the idea, but I am eating ya know?  Overall, an average place that is ok if you don't mind yelling to talk to your date/coherts, and still not being able to hear. Food is ok if you're into average Spanish food. Oh and I forgot to mention, the service is mediocre too. The only reason I go out to eat these days is for the service. Food is food and in Chicago there are plenty of choices. My server although quick forgot that my date, a regular, ask for no potatoes on her squid/octopus dish and he didn't listen. She said it costs more but she was willing to pay as she always does but he failed to accommodate and she was too hungry to send it back. He could have been a little more personable as well. Anyway, I won't be back unless someone offers to take me there again and only if they insist.",0.9423,0.833,0.104,0.063,0.5559690799396682

It was good, and decent---which are adjectives I abhor when it comes to describing tapas.  -The worst part was the dessert. Seriously?

2011-10-02,4.0,"Tapas is a great way of trying several dishes at smaller portion sizes, rather than having to buy full-sized entrees and without having to break the bank. Cafe Iberico is one of those places that has such offerings, specializing in Spanish cuisine. It's large, with 2-3 bar areas, and a decent amount of seating. The ambiance has Spanish-like decor: yellow walls, mirrors and wrought-iron designs plastered all over the walls, marble-like tables, and wood-lacquered chairs. I found the bottles covering the ceiling near the front very intriguing. It gave an otherwise boring ceiling, something to look at. Dress attire is casual, but most patrons wear something a little nicer like a sweater, button-down, or a blouse.  Our party of 3 came here for an early dinner. We were initially going to order 8-9 dishes, but the waiter said 2 tapas per person would be good, so we wound up ordering 6 dishes: 1) Pulpo A La Plancha ($8.75) - grilled octopus with potatoes and olive oil. The octopus were tender, almost melting in your mouth and full of flavor. Octopus is very hard to prepare, but Iberico did it perfectly, making this mine and everyone else's favorite dish. They added a portion of well-seasoned fries to this dish to make it look more substantial, which was a nice bonus. 2) Mejillones a la Marinera ($7.95) - steamed mussels with marinara sauce. The mussels were fresh, plump, and not overcooked. The marinara sauce was light, almost the color penne a la vodka. The sauce was great for dipping the bread into. It was a solid dish, but simple in preparation, not really doing much for me. 3) Pincho de solomillo ($7.95) - skewered beef tenderloin with fries & caramelized onions. The beef was tender but did not hold a lot of flavor. I suppose they tried to counterbalance that with the caramelized onions, but these onions were cooked so long that it was as sweet as marmalade. It was almost inedible because of how sweet it was. Definitely not my cup of tea, and I would have preferred the beef to be complimented with a green chimichurri-like sauce. 4) Almejas en salsa verde ($8.50) - small clams sauteed with shallots, white wine & parsley. This was downright my second favorite dish, if not my favorite. I have a love for clams, and these clams were perfectly cooked so that they were plump and not shriveled up. The combination of the sweet shallots, similar to an onion, and the white wine made for a superb sauce for both the clams, and to dip my bread in. I found myself dipping as much bread as I could, so that I could savor all that yummy goodness. 5) Chorizo y Morcilla ($7.50) - combination platter of grilled Spanish-style sausages, 6 pieces of very thin-sliced chorizo and 2 pieces of blood sausage. The chorizo was overcooked and a bit dried out, making for a very disappointing dish. It didn't have any real heat to it, or any real noticeable spices. For those not familiar with blood sausage, the 2 pieces were mushy in consistency, and is not for everyone. It was good, but nothing from the norm. The portions in this dish were so small, making the dish look practically empty and making me wonder what we were paying for. 6) Paella Iberica ($12.95) - a cafe Iberico original served with seafod, chicken & pork. The paella was actually decently sized, much bigger than any of the tapas dishes. It was easily shared among us, with plenty left over. The paella was perfectly cooked with chicken, pork, squid, fish, shrimp, 2 clams, 2 mussels, yellow rice and peas. I was surprised as how delightful this dish was, making this a must try. Service was something lacking, to the point where it was inconveniencing us. And I'm very patient and tolerant. However, the waiter never came to check up on us or clean any of the dishes as each one was brought out. Every time one of the servers came out with another dish, we had to reshuffle everything or he had to ask his buddy to clear some of the dishes, when they were already clearly stacked on top of each other on one side of the table. We'd be waiting there 1-3 minutes each time as they attempted to organize our table, with our help. Cafe Iberico had some hits and misses. The dishes I recommend trying are the Pulpo a La Plancha, Almejas en salsa verde, and the Paella Iberica. Portions were generous for the most part, and tapas were priced very fairly (with the exception of the Chorizo y Morcilla). Service is something they really need to work on, but putting that aside, I would definitely come back for those 3 dishes time and time again.",0.9994,0.803,0.181,0.016,0.5210882173382173

If you wait upstairs they'll call your cell phone. We waited upstairs and got two mini pitchers of sangria for $24 (hey! It was a long wait). When you order sangria, they don't put ice in the pitcher. They put ice in your glass. I think that's a great idea so that your sangria doesn't get watered down prematurely.

The service was somewhat slow but we didn't mind because our legs and feet were smokin' and they needed some rest. The sangria was exceptional. I had the white but the red looked just as tasty. Our 1st  tapas was potatoes with sausage in a bold red sauce. We devoured it! The second tapas dish was a pesto bruschetta with baked goat cheese. I won't even tell you how good that was. Try it out for yourself.  Our main course was a seafood paella. The rice in the dish was really good. We probably should have gone vegetarian on this. We like seafood but I think as a 3rd dish it was a bit much.  Our bellies were so stuffed so we sadly had to decline dessert. We still had to walk back to our hotel which was about 1 mile away.

I prefer red; however, I was a little disappointed when I saw how they served the white sangria. They keep it in a huge plastic garbage bin next to the actual garbage behind the bar. Then, they put the pitcher directly in the garbage containing the sangria and scoop it in there. And then ladies and gentlemen, they serve it to you.  I was a little grossed out that the sangria is kept in a garbage bin. I'm sure they need a huge place to store it, but at this point in Cafe Iberico's career, I think it is time to invest in some sort of dispenser so that it may be more sanitary.

The atmosphere was nice, and I loved that they had Spanish TV channels on (not that I speak Spanish or anything). The place just had an authentic feel to it. The menu was great, and even included photos. The waiter was prompt in greeting us, getting drinks, and taking orders for our first two (cold) tapas. He recommended a Spanish beer that I loved. The tapas were *excellent*...Jamon Iberico, and Plato Combinado - basically, delicious meats and cheeses. The accompanying bread was also fresh and delicious. We ordered 3 more (hot) tapas, and two of them were brought out (grilled squid, and ham & chicken puffs). We were totally done with them, and the waiter asked if we would like anything else... Up until now, everything was ""5-star"", but I told the waiter that we ordered the goat cheese and he went into a mini-tirade about how the chef screwed up the order and he's made ""20 mistakes"", and blah, blah, blah. It was not big deal, and it's not like I was starving or anything, and could have even gone without the last tapas. So the waiter went from being *wonderful* to totally pissed off. BF was irritated that the waiter threw the chef under the bus, when it was ultimately his responsibility to deliver the food to us. BF also said that the waiter reached across the table to refill water, whilst dripping water from the pitcher onto the food (I was in the rest room when this happened). Anyway, BF is rarely irritated by anything, but this waiter was pissing him off. We got and finished the delicious goat cheese, and sat for quite a while and I finally had to flag down the waiter for our check. He kinda tossed it on the table with no comment or eye contact. Listen dude, we didn't do anything to make you mad at US! Anyway. BF paid and left 15%+ tip, but included some change in it (I was embarrassed by this, but like I say, BF was super irritated)...and as we were walking out, I heard waiter complaining to (manager? owner?) about the fact that he got loose change included with tip, presumably blaming chef's errors for this.

We had Patatas bravas, pulpo a la plancha, champinones a la plancha, croquetas de pollo & paella iberico. The croquetas de pollo & paella were my favorites, but everything was great. We got there at around 5 pm on a Friday and there was no wait at all. The place quickly filled up, however, so we were happy we got there when we did. By the time we left the place was packed. Our server was great. Charming, funny, flirtatious, but just the right amount of all three. My friend had the sangria which looked great, but I wasn't able to partake that night. I'll definitely do so on my next visit. Overall, I highly recommend this place. It wasn't very expensive and it was really great food and atmosphere.",0.9967,0.651,0.335,0.014,0.6235260770975057

RECOMMENDATION:  The sangria is great, but if you only have two people, do not get the pitcher.  It's not that it's too much alcohol, it's just too much fruit and acid.  Get a glass each and then switch to beer or booze.",0.9505,0.818,0.182,0.0,0.55
2011-06-23,4.0,"I came here last night with my parents on their first night in Chicago. They're staying at the Westin River North, and it was around 9pm and we wanted something tasty but not in the $$$$ range most River North restaurants tend to fall into. Once I realized that we were close to Cafe Iberico, we made the decision to go there, because everyone I know loves it. I was pretty impressed. They've got the classic tapas dishes you find at all tapas places, but they're very well done. The Patatas Bravas were ACTUALLY spicy here, not just mildly spiced like at most places. We also tried the Chorizo y Morcilla (sausage sampler plate) and it was pretty awesome - chorizo and a ham-like sausage, but also a black sausage that usually I would never eat (blood is weird) but that I tried and actually ate an entire slice myself. We also got a few of their weekly specials. (These aren't listed on their webpage so I can't tell you the Spanish names, unfortunately.) We had a grilled beef dish with potatoes and peppers that was pretty tasty. The potato and goat cheese croquettes with a roasted pepper sauce were really really good, bonus points for having bread at the table to sop up extra sauce. But what was really good (and which a lot of people probably wouldn't think to order) was the grilled cuttlefish with squid ink and pasta. I know, squid ink is kinda gross. I even usually don't eat things with tentacles. But this stuff was GOOD. Tender cuttlefish, more like the texture of a scallop, and the squid ink sauce was almost sweet tasting. By far the best dish we ordered. The pitcher of sangria was also tasty, and huge for only $15. We shared it between 4 people, and everyone got at least 2 glasses. My only complaint - it's really noisy in there. I don't know if it was because we were sandwiched in between 2 parties of very excited 20-year-old girls, or if it was the bus boy who kept dropping things, but the noise level seemed high for a Thursday night. Luckily the food was good :)",0.9982,0.757,0.222,0.021,0.5529365079365078

But last night, the music definitely seemed louder than ever in the main room, they'd changed the music from reggaeton to house, and the videos they were playing on their TVs had flashing strobe lights. It was like being in a dance club. We could hardly communicate with the waiter, let alone each other. The table next to us got up and left after a few minutes because they were having a yearly reunion and found they couldn't hear well enough to catch up with each other. We did speak to the manager, who graciously offered to move us to another table in the smaller room, but we already had all our food and couldn't be bothered to move. The food is always excellent, but it's very difficult to have a conversation here, especially with people near middle-age.",0.8589,0.854,0.105,0.041,0.4682291666666667

If you order soda here, know that refills do not come free. They don't even give you a can. It's from the fountain at their bar. Also just like in Spain, bread is not complimentary. They also have fancy bottled water at every table. If you don't ask specifically for tap, they will charge you for the bottle. (In Spain though, there's no concept of tap, you always pay for the bottle so you might as well get soda, wine, or beer.) The bf and I ordered the pulpo a la plancha and the patatas bravas. The octopus was decent; came with skinny fries. The potatoes were meh, nothing to write home about. The service was okay. No complaints there. Overall the meal was overpriced and mediocre at best.

We were amazed.  The pulpo / patatas / gambas / every item we ordered for the wedding was something that we had ordered before, and we absolutely could tell that they stepped it up a couple notches just for us. Chef himself must have been in the kitchen overseeing the event from top to bottom because the quality that day was impeccable.  It was amazing and hands down the best meal we had there by far.  My only regret was that our stomachs were too small to try all of the food we ordered, but our guests assured us that everything was a perfect 10.   Thank you Chef, Karolina, and crew!",0.9807,0.877,0.116,0.006,0.6047892720306515

We were seated quickly (30 mins) for a Saturday night with a party of 5. Drinks were re-filled and menu was explained.  Food: The wood was decent. We ordered several tapas for the table and shared.

Unfortunately, something entirely different turned out to be our buzzkill.  Instead, after we had been there for a while, we were asked by a manager to leave.  Because there were people waiting for tables.  Wait, what??  We just spent $250 at the restaurant that employs and you're asking us to leave?  She offered to comp us drinks at the bar, but for a group of 6 or 7, we weren't exactly going to be able to talk to each other standing at a bar in an extremely crowded restaurant.  This was also kind of embarrassing for me and my party, as we were there in honor of a visitor to the department.

And even though food is the focal point, lets not forget the sangria.  Unlike other tapas bars who make many flavored sangria and sangria inspired beverages, Cafe Iberico makes only two.  They make only two because that's all they need.  They are fresh, wonderfully blended, and very affordable.  And that goes with thier food too.   If you're looking for something exciting, then I'd probably go to another place, but if you'd like to spend a nice evening, eating some great food that you already know, and want to enjoy some tasty sangria, I would definately hit this place up.",0.9951,0.745,0.239,0.016,0.5163333333333334

The prices are reasonable - you can probably get out of here with drinks and dinner for about $40 per person if you're splitting several dishes. Nothing on the menu really stands out, but you're not going to Café Iberico for outstanding Spanish cuisine. The menu is large enough that you should be able to find something for everyone - I usually stick with the patatas ali-oli (potatoes in a garlic mayo sauce), patatas bravas (spicy potatoes), and croquetas de pollo and then see what the rest of the group wants to do. A pitcher of sangria is usually your best bet if you're with a group - it's pretty decent and reasonably priced. The restaurant is very large, but gets quite crowded - so either make a reservation or prepare to wait at the bar for awhile (up to an hour). Once you have a table, the service is usually very attentive, but the restaurant can get loud with that many diners in it.

We waited for over an hour to be seated -- and on a side note, I don't understand why a restaurant would NOT take reservations but would also not have an acceptable area for their patrons to wait. My friends and I kept getting told to stand aside, even though it was so crowded that we pretty much had nowhere else to wait except outside. (They should be glad that the weather was actually decent, otherwise I would have been PISSED.) When we finally did get to sit down, a frazzled waitress took all our orders in a rush and nearly forgot one corner of the table because she was bustling so fast to get away. Given that we waited so long to be seated, I do have to say that I was rather impressed with the short amount of time that it took for our food to come out. A friend and I shared the vegetarian Spanish omelette, the octopus fries, and the baked goat cheese. Out of those, my favorite was the octopus fries -- very oily and decadent, but I loved how the octopus was soft and well-done rather than chewy. All the portions were generous and filling. I didn't like how the restaurant was loud and playing some clubbing music in the background half of the time. I was basically screaming at my friend who was sitting across the table from me.

We also shared two different meals - the eggplant rolls (week night special) and the other was Pincho de Pollo (YUM).  The eggplant rolls were terrible.  Cold, mushy, soggy ... it was like eating an old brown banana peel stuffed with an even colder mysterious stuffing.  It was just wrong.  TSK TSK!  It was so unsatisfying we tried to complain to our server who basically was trying to trick us into thinking it was good (good attempt might I add).  Pincho was really good.  I would of ate the onions all by themselves.

2011-03-17,3.0,"i was long overdue for a revisit to cafe iberico - i hadn't been in YEARS - so me and the bf decided to stop in for a weekday night dinner date.  after being seated, the waitress (nicely) pressed us to order a few times within the first 5-10 minutes. it felt like she was rushing us, although i'm sure that was not her intention.  generally speaking, i don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. personally, i think the hot tapas are more appealing. & not only is the food reliable & tasty, it's cheap! just about all of the tapas are under $10.  we ordered:  - sauteed mushrooms: arrived room temperature, smooth with a little kick - pork loin: we thought the pork would be marinated & tender, but instead it was flat, crispy & a little on the dry side. taste was still there, but it wasn't quite what we were expecting  - goat cheese with marinara: delicious as expected; i'm not sure how could anyone mess this dish up - ham & cheese croquetas: a small portion, but our favorite; the dipping sauce (an aioli) was the cherry on top  - 1/2 picture of red sangria: strong & hit the spot  so, what makes me give iberico three stars? in one word: the service. the staff is overly attentive. and by overly attentive, i mean they will take your drinks & food before you are finished with them. (major pet peeve.) both our waitress and what seemed to be 50 bus boys were constantly assaulting our table, taking things away without asking if we were done first. they were like snipers, removing an object & vanishing before you could utter a sound. after what appeared to be a ""floor manager"" saw my face when my glass of sangria with a few sips left in it was taken from me, he went & got me a brand new glass & explained to me that he trains his staff to remove things quickly in order to keep the tables clean - by nature, tapas creates a lot cluttter with all of the small plates & dishes. i get it - but could ya ask first? all of the activity at the table put us on edge - by the end, we were practically clutching onto our bread basket & the remainder of the goat cheese to forbid anyone from taking it. and that is NOT my idea of a relaxing date night. thanks for the glass of sangria though. so, iberico is tasty & cheap - but you might have to eat like you're in prison to finish any of what you order.",0.9771,0.861,0.097,0.042,0.5394656795224975

For the party, we brought a cake to be served at the table.  We asked that it not be refrigerated.  First, they charged us $1/person for a ""cutting charge"" and they didn't even cut the cake.  They just brought it to the table.  Secondly, the cake was in the cooler.  Our table was right by the cooler and we could clearly see it.  We asked to have it taken out and it was, for about 3 minutes, before it was put right back in the cooler. If you are going here, be prepared for crowds.  The place was beyond packed the entire time we were there.  It was overwhelming to be honest.  It is also very loud, tough to have any conversations.

2011-01-26,5.0,"I went to Iberico yesterday for my birthday with one of my best friends. We typically have long lunch dates that entail a little eating and a lot of talking. On this day, however, it entailed a whole lot of eating, and talking proceeded when we were incredibly stuffed. We started with Jamon Iberico, a cold dish.  I won't go into details, but I will say that the saltiness of the ham was complimented greatly by the fresh tomatoes. Very good way to begin the meal This was followed by 2 more dishes. Potatas Bravas, which are basically just homestyle potatoes covered in a spicy tomato sauce. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. I was in love with the sauce. I will recommend that those that don't like spicy be careful as it does have a good kick. But if you enjoy a little heat, definitely get these.  The other dish was Pulpo a la Plancha, an octopus dish. On the menu, it says it comes with potatoes, which are actually just fries. I was a little interested by this as the other style of potatoes are much better. I think it would be safe to assume that it is strictly for presentation. However, on to the best part: the octopus! It is simply grilled octopus, but it is grilled absolutely perfectly. The texture is great. Too often, octopus will be a little tough, but this was not the case. Recommend for anyone who enjoys seafood. Don't let those suckers turn you off! The last plate to come out was Queso de Cabra. Baked goat cheese with a tomato basil sauce and bread. It was fairly good, but as it came out after we had both helped ourselves to multiple helpings of our previous dishes, we were barely able to eat half. It is a good dish, and might be better before you move on to the other ones. Just a little too heavy and too strong of flavor to finish with. Our servers were on top of things, and our main server was quick to offer his thoughts on what was good. He suggested a dish that consisted of dates, however neither of us wanted that, so we went with his second choice of Jamon Iberico. Like I said, perfect opener. We went in the afternoon so it was not too busy, though I can imagine most nights it would be busy.",0.9989,0.744,0.241,0.014,0.5054177897574126

Cafe Iberico had long been my favorite tapas spot in Chicago...the one I recommended to others, the one with the most authentic food and excellent atmosphere. After this past Saturday night, I'll never be back. We were told our wait for a table for 4 would be 40 minutes, and to watch for my name on the TV screen for when it was our turn (okay, this is a pretty great system, kudos for that). The hostess offered us immediate seating at the new restaurant upstairs, but after seeing that the menu consisted of a laminated placemat with photos of the food, a la a cheap takeout place, we declined. I called the hostess (it was too crowded to get back to the stand to ask in person) after 55 minutes to ask our status. She was unapologetic, and it was another 10 minutes still (65 minutes, after being told 40) before we were seated. Speaking of the seating....way, WAY too many tables in the room (the southern dining room, main floor). I was literally brushing backs/hair with the woman at the next table the entire time. I could probably have heard her conversation as well, if it weren't for the deafening noise in the room. I've been to loud restaurants, and I've been to busy Chicago restaurants on Saturday nights more often than I can remember...this was a whole new level. My ears were ringing like after a rock concert for the entire next day. All of this could have been ignored, had the food and drink been as I had remembered. Nope. Our paella wasn't made to order as it always had been in the past--it came out overcooked and forgettable. The crostini with the goat cheese/marinara was soggy and spongy. And the sangria was...just okay. Our server was fine for our initial drink and tapas order, then we never saw her again. We may have added a few other tapas to our order if given the opportunity, but instead we couldn't get the check fast enough. So, so sad, Iberico. You've changed. And not for the better.

I don't really care about the service as long as they bring me my food and refill my water. I don't need to be treated like a queen. Also, try to avoid this place on weekends because waiting while you are hungry can be quite frustrating, and the waits can get long. We've literally never had to wait on week nights.

The bf definitely enjoyed it more than I did--must be a guy thing. Rabbit meat is just too weird for me... And if we are in the mood, we always share a pitcher of sangria--bf likes red; I prefer white.  The atmosphere is lively.

2011-01-23,3.0,"I enjoyed my meal at Cafe Iberico, but honestly, I prefer Cafe Ba-ba-reeba.  One does get the impression Iberico is more authentic in the tapas department, though. Here's a breakdown of what we ordered... Patatas ali-oli (red potatoes with garlic mayonnaise sauce).  Super garlicky.  I'm not big into mayo, but these were okay. Patatas bravas (spicy potatoes with special tomato sauce).  My favorite.  The potatoes were quite spicy - they kind of tasted like nuclear-hot fries. Pincho de solomillo (beef tenderloin skewer with fries and caramelized onions).  I enjoyed the beef as it was tender and well seasoned.  The fries didn't do much for me, especially after having the patatas bravas.  They were just limp and relatively flavorless.  And the carmelized onions weren't much of a bonus. Croquetas de pollo (chicken and ham puffs served with ali-oli sauce).  Pretty good, although the chicken and ham are blended to a mush.  I might have preferred them a little chunkier. Gambas al ajillo (grilled shrimp with olive oil, garlic and wine).  I'm not a shrimp fan, so I could have done without these. To wrap up we had a dessert of flan de caramelo.  Didn't really blow my hair back. I enjoyed the atmosphere, since it was packed and lively.  Service was generally good.  If someone suggested returning, I wouldn't be against it.  But as I left, I found myself wanting to have tapas from the Cafe Ba-ba-reeba menu.  That's not Iberico's fault, but my ratings do reflect quality compared to the competition, so even a good meal can lose a star by not being a great meal.",0.9934,0.746,0.203,0.051,0.5415514592933947
2011-01-22,4.0,"This is definitely my go-to tapas place in Chicago. It's the closest you can get to enjoying tapas in Spain, due to both the atmosphere and the food! Definitely try their sangria, especially the red wine sangria, because it's delicious! Be careful though, because it will definitely sneak up on you and you'll feel it when you get up to leave. I go there at least 5-6 times a year and I've tried various things on the menu- I've never been disappointed. Some of my favorites are: patatas ali-oli (potato salad with garlicky mayo sauce) jamon iberico (Spanish ham with manchego cheese and tomato toasts) queso de cabra (baked goat cheese with tomato sauce and pesto toasts) pulpo a la plancha (grilled octopus with potatoes) and raxo adobado (pork loin with thin french fries) If it's your birthday, don't tell them unless you're jonesing for a phallic- but delicious- dessert. If not, just order the caramelized bananas- YUM!  The atmosphere of the place is awesome. They always have lively music playing and it's a fun place to go with friends. There are usually large groups of people there and every time I've been there on a weekend I've seen at least one birthday celebration. It's definitely not the place to take your grandma for tapas; the crowd is younger and the place is loud and vibrant. They don't get a full 5 stars because the service can be off sometimes and they don't take reservations.  I was there on a Tuesday night once and the place was relatively empty but our waiter was extremely slow. To make matters worse, he was standing close to our table because we were right by the kitchen and he was just talking to his coworkers while we sat there wanting to order more and needing water refills. Not taking reservations is a pain too, because sometimes the wait can get long. The upside to that is that you can sit at the bar and wait while drinking their yummy sangria! Another major plus is how cheap this place is- you get so much food and sangria for about 25-30 dollars per person, usually! All in all, the food, atmosphere, and affordability make this an awesome tapas spot",0.9937,0.823,0.148,0.029,0.5208815958815958

The dish was arranged with the two balls of ice cream clustered together near one end of the banana...and the banana was garnished with a little dollop of whipped cream at the opposite end...

My favorites were the patatas bravas (spicy tomato sauce potatoes), pincho de solomillo (beef tenderloin skewer), queso de cabra (baked goat cheese with tomato basil sauce) and the carmel flan.

The meal:  Three tapas One entree Two people Plenty of leftovers. Rehone your concept of tapas - these were all entree sized.  My date only eats halal, so we ordered a salmon and mint rice dish, a plate of steamed mussels, stewed eggplant over toast, and an entree of seafood paella. The bread on the table was soft and crumbly and dry (good bread should be light and airy on the inside and have a hard crust) and the olive oil barely tasted olive-y.  No olives were served with our meal.   The salmon was easily the best part of our meal - crispy and caramelized on the outside, moist and tender and flavorful on the inside.  The whole thing tasted olive-y.  And the serving size is about 6oz, which is insane for a dish that's a tapa.  The rice it came with supposedly had mint in it, but we couldn't taste any. The stewed eggplant - too sweet, but otherwise acceptable.  The mussels seemed amazing at first, especially with the wonderful salty briny broth they were served in. I fell in love with them, until I got a few under my belt, at which point the insane levels of salt started to hit me and dry out my mouth.  Definitely a dish to be shared.   The seafood paella - bland and disappointing.  Tasted like the metal of the paella pan more than anything, and clearly had no saffron.. The serving size was huge, however, and had a good serving of seafood in it.   Service was all right - our waitress was sweet and attentive and calm throughout the noise and bustle, but the bus boys didn't refill our water even once (which started to hurt with those super salty mussels). Would I come back here for great food and ambiance with my single, discerning friends?  No, definitely not.  Would I come back here years from now, as a mid 30's suburbanite with little kids and maybe out of town visiting relatives, and feel confident that my group and the restaurant were appropriate for one another? Yes.  Iberico is like a Spanish version of the Olive Garden - delicious to no one, acceptable to everyone, good value, big portions, safe and bland tasting, nice clothes optional, screaming kid friendly.  I had been painting my new apartment all day, and had been doing errands downtown when hunger and circumstance brought us to Iberico - I was worried about walking into a downtown restaurant on a Saturday night in ripped jeans, messy hair, and a paint stained tee, but my date convinced me.  As soon as I walked in, and saw that the fanciest dressed people there were in Ed Hardy, I felt better.   I would definitely recommend Iberico as a solid bet for tourists, familes, and big groups.",0.9987,0.749,0.195,0.055,0.501998243302591

2010-12-04,1.0,This place sucks. We called in advance and they said the wait was going to be 15 min. When we got there it was ridiculously packed. The lady in the front put our names down and told us to watch the screen; she said the wait was going to be approx. 30min. An hour later we went to check what the hold up was; and they rudely informed us to keep watching the screen for our name. Another 35 minutes passed so we went back to the front. This time a different lady who apparently had no idea what was going on told us to keep watching the screen and she wasn't sure how long the wait would be. This place sucks!! The service is complete crap.  Almost 2 hours of waiting after being told it was only going to be 15?  Unforgiveable.,-0.9427,0.882,0.0,0.118,0.4948412698412699

2010-11-27,3.0,"Cafe Iberico is definitely A-OK. I lived in Spain for an entire year so trust me, I know excellent tapas. I would not define Iberico's tapas as the best, but I think this restaurant is more known for its ambiance, quick service and unbelievable prices. I must say, the octopus is amazing. By far the best thing that we ordered all night. I would recommend ordering them without potatoes, which are basically just french fries. Who wants french fries when you get extra octopus when you order without? I don't know how they cook it but I'd highly recommend ordering at least a couple dishes of this yummy tapa. We actually didn't order a lot of the traditional tapas. I was with a big group, so I left everyone else take charge, because I'll pretty much eat anything ;) The scallops were good but I think they put sour cream somewhere in there and I never remember most tapas in Spain ever having sour cream. So that is a definite American twist, which I was not happy about. In hindsight, I would have liked to order a paella and also the tortilla, as those are staple tapas dishes. I would come here again because it is a fun atmosphere and perfect for large groups. They don't take reservations, which is a bummer, but those waiters turn business around pretty fast so I can't imagine you're every waiting longer than an hour.

Well, thanks to the manager at Cafe Iberico, she can count on losing 6 families worth of business. As we were just getting our plates and beginning to eat, one of my friends unfortunately began having a seizure. We know they can happen at any minute, but its not like you can do anything about it once its happening. I, along with the other 4 girls, proceed to lay her down and ask the waiters that they just give us a minute until she regains consciousness. Well...the manager wouldn't have it and as opposed to leaving us alone (like we asked her to), while our friend got better, she proceeded to get all the staff to come to our table pick up our friend and move us outside!!!!!!!!!!!  YES, as my friend is having a seizure the manager finds it in her heart to open up a space outside for us, claiming she has other costumers to worry about. She even graciously asks my friend to go get her car so they can just put her in there....... As another friend asks for the check, the waiter insists that he doesnt think we'll have to pay since we hadn't really touched our food at that point. Again, thanks to the lovely manager, not only did she inform us that we would have to pay.......as she gave us the check, she called the waiter over and asked him to make sure we were charged for everything that we ordered!!!!!!!!! Are you serious Cafe Iberico?!?!?! This is the person you have in charge?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!? Needless to say, we wont be going back.

2010-09-20,5.0,"This is my favorite Tapas Place! I've been to a few around the city, and I always compare each one of them to Cafe Iberico. Their tapas and paellas are close to those you'd find in Spain. I would describe their tapas to be straight to the point. The food is not complicated, not made into a crazy fusion of some sort. Just like how Spanish Tapas should be. I figured some people may not like Iberico because their tapas are not ""fancy"" and loaded with unnecessary ingredients. But that's the beauty of it all. You get to enjoy the true taste of the dish.  Definitely worth trying would be Calamares a la Plancha (grilled squid), Gambas al a jillo (grilled shrimp), Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes, better than Cafe Babareeba's!), Paella Iberica, Mejillones a la Marinara (steamed mussles), Champinones a la Plancha (grilled mushrooms), White Sangria, etc. Everything is reasonably priced and the portions are just right. The only thing that bothers me about this place is that it can get really loud. Which doesn't seem to matter after a few Sangrias! The most quiet spot in this restaurant (if you want to have a decent conversation with people you are dining with) would be the smaller dining hall to the right, close to the walls. I try to request to be seated there if possible. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait about an hour and a half since they don't take reservations then. So make sure you ate a snack before going and just enjoy a few glasses of Sangria while waiting at the bar. Also, since the paellas take about 30-40 minutes to make, we found it easier to order it while waiting for a table. You just have to pay ahead of time.",0.9878,0.853,0.134,0.014,0.528777189888301

The tomato and jamon bread was excellent, although calling it Jamon Iberico is a misnomer, as it is clearly Jamon Serrano, not the more expensive and delicious Iberico.  The garlic mushrooms were sublime.  Garlicky, firm, and well  cooked.  Patatas bravas were a little spicy, but not too much, and had a nice rich sauce without it being very creamy as in some places.  The tortilla was moist inside and still well cooked, just as I personally love it.  The list goes on...garlic shrimp, pork loin, beans and chorizo stew, croquetas, grilled squid, all delicious.  For dessert we had filloas with ice cream, a white chocolate crema catalana (like a brulee), wine soaked pears with ice cream and a booze soaked sponge cake.  Delicious.   The best thing is that for 4 people eating enough for 6, we paid 172 with tax.  This included 32 worth of alcohol (3 Sam Adams and 3 Jack and Cokes), and the exorbitant Chicago restaurant sales tax.  Food alone was under $140, which is superb.  Probably the cheapest spanish restaurant I have eaten at in the US from San Francisco to New York.  For the awesome food, extensive tapas selection and price, you can't beat it.  At least not in my opinion.",0.9987,0.738,0.246,0.016,0.5518191028829327

It's actually more than 1mile south (just below the intersection of LaSalle & Chicago) in the River North neighborhood. Ok, on with my review... I love Cafe Iberico. The tapas are terrific and the sangria is to die for. It's strong, delicious, and the pitchers are actually a great deal considering how many glasses you get. I just passed a professional exam for the State and went to Iberico to celebrate afterward with a friend. Weekends are crazy here because it's such a popular restaurant and has been on most people's radar forever. Fortunately we went on a Thursday around 6pm so we were seated immediately, had incredibly attentive wait staff, and the kitchen sent our orders out in record time. I didn't get too experimental but did try a new whitefish (that I sadly don't remember the name of) as well as the only mushroom dish on the menu which was very good and had an amazing broth. Other than that, we had a lot of the standards... grilled octopus, beef skewers, goat cheese in tomato sauce, etc and everything tasted great. All-in-all a fun, albeit mildly drunk evening. In contrast, I have been here enough times to know that you can really run the gamut in terms of how easy it is to get seated and attentiveness of the wait staff. It is also loud so I really don't recommend going here on a first date unless maybe during the day when the dining rooms are less full. By 7:30pm, it can get noisy and you'll have a difficult time hearing one another. Still, the food is excellent and the prices are low considering how much variety there is and the size of the portions. Oh, and since I just noticed there was another review warning people not to sit downstairs... I agree that the atmosphere is generally better on the 1st floor but it really depends on what you are looking for. I have requested to be seated downstairs on several occasions because it was simply too loud upstairs and it is more secluded which is nice if you're in a mood for a little privacy.

The ambiance is kind of terrible. The tables are ON TOP of each other, and you have to yell to be heard. It isn't even pretty inside.  The service was terrible. We ordered five plates, one being a half roasted chicken. Our server told us that one would take an extra 15 minutes. We also ordered the white sangria. He brought it out quickly but it tasted like watered down, spiked apple juice.  And I think that was the last time we saw the server until he brought us the bill. The food came out very quickly, but 4 of our 5 plates came out at the same time. It was ridiculous. I've gone to 4 other tapas places in Chicago, and never have I felt so rushed to get out of there. We were sitting at a small table, and there was NO room. So now were both shoving food into our mouths because there is still another plate coming, and there is no room for it. As we would finish these plates, no one would come and pick them up. So then we were sitting at a table with dirty plates for quite some time. Our meal: Goat Cheese - Meh... I've had better Jamon deli plate - SLIMY. It was gross. I couldn't eat it. Potato salad with tuna and carrots - Excellent, but hard to mess up. Beef Tenderloin Skewers  with fries -  Tasted exactly as expected. Nothing interesting about it. Finally someone came to take our plates away.

Also we have a group tradition of having Sweet Mandy B's cupcakes for birthdays, and they let us bring them into the restaurant. They even took them from me at the beginning and served them to us on a plate with lit candles when it was time for dessert. They told me they typically charge $1/person cut fee - but it didn't show up on the bill, and the waiter told me not to worry about it.  Love that.  All in all we had a great night here. The staff was friendly and accomodating and the food was delicious. I think we'll have all our birthday dinners here from now on. :)",0.9963,0.758,0.228,0.014,0.6396666666666667

We went on a Saturday night around 8:15.  The wait was fast, just enough time to grab a glass of sangria at the bar.  I believe that we could have easily grabbed 2 drinks, alas, the bartender was an idiot.  However, the beverage was mm mm good.  When the giant TV screen (which played nothing but the cheesiest of the cheesy music videos [ ie: The Macarena]) displayed ""Alexandria party of 2"" scrolling across the bottom, we were promptly escorted to our table in one of the 50 giant dining rooms.  By the time we sat down, I had already lost some hearing in both ears and I knew that in order to have a conversation with my friend 14 inches away from me, I would have to seriously exercise my vocal chords.  This place is LOUD!!!  The acoustics definitely hit ""an 11"".   Rather than engaging in any witty banter, we just picked up our menus and each picked out 2 small plates to share.  Unfortunately, we had to do this through gestures (meaning, point at the menu and either nod, shake our heads, or give a facial expression indicating our opinion about said choices) because talking about what we wanted wasn't an option.  About 20 minutes of sitting in ""silence"", our waiter finally came to take our order.   We opted for a pitcher of sangria and the following: Gambas Al Ajillo (grilled shrimp)- FIVE STARS, AMAZING Champinones a la plancha (grilled mushrooms)- FIVE STARS. If I had to eat something everyday for the rest of my life, this dish would be in the running. Pincho De Solomillo (Beef Tenderloin w/fries and carmelized onions)- FOUR STARS.  The beef was not exciting at all, but the onions and fries were orgasmic. Pulpo a la Plancha (grilled octopus w/potatoes and olive oil)- FIVE STARS. Perfected cooked octopus, amazing flavor, and I loved the fact that it was all intermingles with the potatoes (which were actually fries, but still, it was goooooood) All the portions were generous as far as ""small plates"" go, and we were both full.  4 dishes plus a pitcher of sangria all was just under $45.  Pretty good deal for a nice night out! So, the food and drinks were amazing.  SO good, that it would be worth the lack of conversation, the terrible (!!!) service, and braving the loud, over-dressed, and rather hoity toity crowd.   Just be sure you're in a good mood before you enter!",0.9966,0.769,0.173,0.057,0.6780246913580248

Patatas Bravas - Still think the potatoes need to be fried more but it could just be how they make it.   My preference is to fry potatoes more based on how I've had at other tapas joints. Patatas Alioli - Still my favorite dish and was perfect and refreshing dish to have on a warm summer evening. Pincho de Solomillo - Smaller cuts compared to when I had it the first visit and not as tender Almejas en Salsa Verde - good sauce, clams not overcooked Chorizo y Morcilla - not bad but have had better chorizo at other tpas restaurants.

2010-06-22,5.0,"Cafe Iberico was one of the first restaurants I visited when I first moved to Chicago 4 years ago- and ever since its held a special place in my heart. I try not to go too often for the sheer fact that I want to keep my visits special, but I still make a trip every couple of months or so...  It's all in the presentation....  The atmosphere is very simple and you will feel like you're sitting in a Spanish cafe drinking sangria amongst your closet friends.  The tile on the floor (and some tables) looks as if it were old Spanish tile with bright eccentric colors that will make your eyes wander through the designs.  The wooden ceiling in the north dining room drips with Spanish charm, while the old fashioned deli just up a few steps makes your nose become excited with the aroma of various meats and cheeses.  The staff is very attentive and you will rarely, if ever have to ask for your water to be refilled and table to be cleared for the new appetizer-style plates to arrive.   For the main event... The restaurant offers a great variety of Tapas food that couldn't express the Spanish-food-culture more.  The small plates are great to pass around and make it very convenient for everyone to sample.  Although I've tried almost everything the menu has to offer I do have a few favorites that I will order every time I step foot in the establishment (they are listed below). * Tortilla Espanola - Vegetarian Spanish omelet * Jamon Iberico - Spanish style cured ham with manchego cheese and tomato bread *Patatas Bravas - Spicy potatoes with special tomato sauce. *Pincho De Pollo - Chicken brochette with caramelized onions and rice. *Gambas Al Ajillo - Grilled shrimp with olive oil, garlic and wine. *Mejillones A La Marinera - Steamed mussels with marinara sauce. *Filloa De Helado Y Crema  - Stuffed crepe with ice cream topped with whipped cream and strawberry sauce. With all of the positivity being sung, I only have one itty bitty complaint- and that is the size of the tables.  The tables are pretty small if it's a table of 2-4; and with all of the delicious food that is ordered it's sometimes hard to find room for it all.  I understand that they are trying to save space and have room for smaller parties of people (2-3), but they need to big a smidge larger to fit everything comfortably (without glasses clinking and plates overlapping one another). If you are looking for a great first date place, friend/family/group dinner, casual night out with the girls (or guys) or even a place to take clients, Cafe Iberico is the perfect place for all of the above.  Salud!",0.9979,0.82,0.171,0.009,0.4703079906204906

The wait can be a bitch sometimes though.  If you go late enough (and they have nice late hours) you can usually get a table right away, even on a weekend.  It is also very loud in there.  Part of which is due to these odd videos they play on tvs all over the place.  They are strangely entertaining though, and I find myself mesmerized by them all too often.   I can't wait to go back now...writing this review made me crave some patatas ali-oli and croquetas de pollo...mmmmmmm....",0.8536,0.793,0.139,0.068,0.6273809523809523
2010-06-07,4.0,"I have been hearing about tapas bars for a while now and am glad to say that i finally went to one. This was the first time I've ever tried tapas but knew exactly what they were before i went there. A group of us went there recently for dinner on a Friday night. One thing i didn't realize about the place was that there was two levels to the restaurant and the top level had a different menu than the bottom level. We didn't really know the difference so we just stayed on the bottom floor. We were all guessing though that the top level had pricier selections. It looked pretty busy there but we were sat right away, but it was really loud so it was kind of difficult hearing each other talk at the table. They had a variety of different drinks to choose from, but my boyfriend and I opted to order a pitcher of the red sangria to drink through out dinner and we had no problem finishing that baby off lol it was really good.  Their menu is divided up into cold tapas, hot tapas, entrees, and deserts. Since tapas are smaller servings served family style you normally order a couple to share, that way you get to try an assortment of different dishes. We agreed to order 2 tapas; 1 cold and 1 hot. i picked the cold one which was a plate of spanish style cured ham with manchego cheese and tomato bread (which was kind of like a crostini that was topped with seasoned tomatoes). He chose the hot one. I can't remember the name of it but it was kind of a disappointment. the menu description said potatoes in a paprika wine sauce with sausage only for us to find out that ""with sausage"" basically means they only add a couple of chucks for flavor. The food came out a lot faster than i though it would and was not bad, but nothing spectacular. Some other things ordered at our table were grilled squid, beef tenderloin, and pork with chimichuri all of which were pretty good too. We tried some different desserts on the menu too and my favorite was the chocolate flan with strawberry sauce. it was realllyy good.  Like i said the service was fast and the staff seemed nice. When we weren't particularly thrilled with the potato tapa we asked our server, curiously, if that was how it was supposed to be made and brought out. She explained that she would get her manager even though it wasn't that big of a deal. the manager explained that that's just how it was prepared and asked us if we would like another order of it. we declined but said that you. Turns out that she had another one sent out on the house which was very nice. There is a lot to be said for a restaurant who takes care of their customers.  I would probably want to try another tapas place before i came back there again, but would be willing to give it another shot in the future and will def try out some of the seafood or paella.",0.9938,0.843,0.122,0.035,0.6454851752021564

We ended up waiting about 45 minutes to be seated but that was fine because it was a beautiful night and quite frankly, I had nowhere else to be.

The location is great, the ambiance is true in it's authenticity, and the food is delicious. You should be prepared to wait it out if you're going on the weekend, and calling ahead will not help as they do not accept reservations. They have implemented a TV that displays your name when it is your turn to feast.  I have favorite items that I always get, and on my last visit me and my girlfriend decided to try something new. So I wanted to order the RAXO ADOBADO (hot pork dish with home fries), and the waiter suggested the ""special"" version on the weekly specials list. I HATE myself for not noting the exact name, but If you are in there just look for it on the specials page (hopefully it is still there). This pork must have been cooked for hours it was so tender. If you're going on a date, and he or she maybe lost some teeth, or perhaps has been advised to drink ensure instead of solids by their doctor, FEED THEM THIS! It was deliciously moist and soft, and the mashed potatoes and peppers. It were awesome! My regular orders are the Croquetas, smoked salmon, clams, baked goat cheese, and the gambas. Salmon is always good, but they never give me enough bread! I love the clams the most, sometimes there are more shells than clams, and the shallot garlic sauce is bomb. I'd highly recommend these but you really can't go wrong. TRY THE PORK! Please don't leave without having some sangria. One pitcher will do the job for a party of 2.

The waitress I've had twice was a vegetarian (the same as I) so she was immensely helpful. I would have to say that their queso de cabra and patatas bravas are my favorite!  I was recently there to celebrate my boyfriend's 31st birthday and we had a party of about 30 and they were very accomodating. I cant believe they were able to pull it off on a Saturday! I would have to say they have to be the best tapas place I have been to and I have been to plenty of them. The waitresses have always been promp and attentive and always care about their customers. I love all the food I have had minus the salad with the beets, but then again I was trying beets for the first time in my life and I should have gone with my guts and listened to everyone when they said beets taste like dirt...haha...will definitely go again and again!",0.973,0.859,0.141,0.0,0.5238095238095237

For me, as a vegetarian, the tapas were so so.  My vegetarian-friendly tapas really truly just tasted like sides.  I got the spicy potatoes (patatas bravas), grilled mushrooms (champinones a la plancha), and the spanish omelette (tortilla espanola).  Spicy potatoes tasted like plain potatoes with a spicy kick... but I couldn't taste any real distinctive flavor that made me think of anything else but just potatoes.  Same for the mushrooms too... nothing too thrilling about the sauce.  Just tasted like cooked mushrooms.  Spanish omelette was good... but I kind of wish my favorite dish wasn't a cold tapa. My bf on the other hand really enjoyed his food.  I guess the tapas here are really only good for meat-eaters.  He got the chicken brochette (pincho de pollo), grilled octopus and fries (pulpo a la plancha), and the mussels in marinara (mejillones a la marinera).  His favorite was definitely the mussels as he claimed the marinara sauce to be really amazing with its richness in flavor.  He was determined to eat up all the sauce with our complimentary bread, even after finishing the mussels.  The octopus was very tender, he says, as octopus normally comes off kind of chewy to him... but he says Iberico's octopus was very good.  Chicken was good too and the caramelized onions on top were so good, he wouldn't mind learning the recipe to eat it with other meats too. I also had the sangria, but didn't find anything too excitingly different about it.  Maybe I'm just not enough of a sangria connoiseur to be able to tell you if it was any good.",0.9975,0.751,0.24,0.01,0.5948707482993199

Two out of five stars because hell yes I've experienced better (read: Mercat, Babareeba, dare I say People Lounge?). Every time I dine here it's like a whole 'nother experience. And trust me when I say, it's not for the better. I came here tonight and shared the calamares, the patatas ali-oli, queso de cabra and a plate of seafood paella. Zzzzz, wait, am I still writing a review here? Yes, unfortunately I am. Wake up Tash, the people have to know! The last time I came here (February of this year) the entire course was amazing, I couldn't get enough. Tonight however was another story: the calamares were tasteless, though grilled they were just doused in oil. What's weird was that the first bite of the squid was really good, when I went back for seconds I was so put off and bored by the non-flavor flavor that I was confused, did the waiter swap out the plate on me?  The queso de cabra is not well balanced, the tangy tomato sauce overpowers the goat cheese, there was no blending of flavors here folks, just a pot of tomato sauce with a dollop of goat cheese in the center. The patatas ali-oli were okay, though you can't really mess up potatoes and mayonaise right? The paella which was the saddest thing on the table, was sorely overcooked. The shrimp and mussels were rubbery and chewy to the point that I had to stop eating. Next.  Yet another gripe was the noise level here. It's Tuesday night, come the f*** on, who are these 35+ y/o rowdy hooligans yelling at the top of their lungs at 8pm? I couldn't hear my aunt nor my waiter without straining to hear and replying in yells. Yep, I yelled all night. This is ridiculous, when you dine downstairs it's dark and and though not quiet, it's a like eating at an entirely different restaurant. That said, don't ever try to get seated upstairs.

2010-03-26,3.0,"It's hard to believe I've been coming to Café Iberico for nearly 20 years. Back in the day, tapas were groundbreaking. There weren't any places serving ""small plates"" and capitalizing on that trendy food description like there are now. When Café Iberico first opened, I went often. It was dirt cheap, still a small place in a fairly uncharted area of downtown, and no one knew about it. It was like having a special secret. Fast forward two decades and everyone and their mother knows about this place. The place has tripled in size, and sadly, the food is just not as good. I went for lunch today after previously only going in the evening. Wow. It's like a completely different place in the cold light of day. Acceptable decibel levels and no wait for a table. Moving on to the food. The three of us ordered Champinones a la Plancha (grilled mushrooms), Croquetas de Pollo (chicken and ham puffs), Raxo Adobado (grilled, marinated pork tenderloin) Queso de Cabra (baked goat cheese), Jarrete de Cordero (roasted lamb shank), Pincho de Solomillo (beef tenderloin skewer) and Ensalada de Alcachofas (marinated artichokes). Some dishes were good, some were decidedly mediocre. The beef tenderloin was really good, especially the fries that accompany it. The pork tenderloin was dry, and the sauce on it was overpowering. Grilled mushrooms were good. Not much you can do to screw those up. Artichokes were a tad drowning in vinaigrette, but still tasty. I always enjoy a good artichoke and these delivered. Baked goat cheese - this hasn't changed much in all the years this place has been around, and that's a good thing. The lamb was quite salty, and I am a liberal user of salt. Maybe the salt use was intentional as it just made me down more sangria. The sangria: this is what CI is known for and justifiably so. It's fruity, it's sweet, it goes down easily. I don't normally drink alcohol at lunch, but hey, it's Friday, I'm leaving early, so why not? Café Iberico is hit or miss. It's inconsistent. You just never know if you'll have a great meal or just an average one.  Give it a try if it's convenient. Most likely, you will come here with out-of-towners as they're always hot to try this place, but it's no longer a destination restaurant for me.",0.8257,0.855,0.072,0.073,0.618433484504913
2010-03-25,3.0,"Cafe Iberico was my first foray into Chicago tapas. Right off the bat it wasn't what I was expecting, which was an intimate, dimly lit tapas bar with few a tables and maybe some Spanish guitar to set the mood. It's sort of the Applebees of tapas places, but not in an entirely bad way. More like in a I could see this place being in any smaller Midwestern town and being very attractive to non-adventurous eaters kind of way. It's big, loud, fast and only vaguely Spanish. But the food was good. Didn't knock my socks off, but I had fun and left full. Here's the rundown: Patatas Bravas - Cubed potatoes in a smokey, spicy tomato sauce. The highlight of the meal for me. Portion was big enough so that the three of us got about two big spoonfuls each. I could have polished off the whole thing myself. Queso de Cabra - Toasted french bread with a tomato and mozzarella dipping sauce. Tangy and good, but not a standout. It takes a lot to mess up cheesy tomato bread. Five pieces so not an easy split. Camerones Gambia - Grilled shrimp in butter sauce. Nine to ten shrimp in an order. They are not huge but are tasty. Like the queso, it's a solid dish but a bit forgettable. Salmon and Scallops (forgot the Spanish name) - Three chunks of salmon and three small scallops in a green garlic sauce. I expected the sauce to be spicier but it was more sweet. Not a ton of flavor on the seafood and the salmon was dry. Probably the low note for me.  Vegetable Paella - Large pan of rice with peppers, onions, zucchini, carrots and squash. The sauce was really flavorful, almost like soy sauce. Big enough to be a meal for one person.  Tiramisu - Basic preparation (lady fingers in Baileys plus cocoa powder) but with drizzled with STRAWBERRY sauce and chunks. Uh, what?! It's tiramisu, people. Chocolate sauce that shit up. And maybe add some vanilla ice cream. Just sayin'. This one confused me and I wasn't feeling it. Wish I'd gotten the crepes. Fried Banana - The most phallic dessert imaginable. But so good. Seved with cinnamon and vanilla ice cream. Putting aside the whole fruit as dessert issue, I really liked this and would get again. Red Sangria - Fruity and delicious but, in the grand tradition of sangria, not strong at all.  Caipirinha - So good. A great summer drink, but delicious all year round. Light, refreshing and just sugary enough. HIghly recommend this one. This place is better suited to big groups, where you're not as interested in the ambiance and more about being able to cram a bunch of people around a table and chat and share some OK food. Probably why they don't take resies for parties of fewer than six. Not a good spot for date night or trying to impress your dining companion.",0.9964,0.767,0.169,0.064,0.48656270959087866

How had I forgotten this - (B+) GAMBAS AL AJILLO (Grilled shrimp with olive oil, garlic and wine.): These were great, not mind blowing, but great - (B+) CHAMPIÑONES A LA PLANCHA (Grilled mushrooms with garlic and olive oil.): I'm not a mushrooms guy and even I liked these - (C+) CHORIZO Y MORCILLA (A combination platter of grilled Spanish style sausages.): This was my bad call. Trust me, I have a Morcilla source in Lawrence, MA... I know a thing or two here and this was weak - (B-) VIEIRAS A LA PLANCHA (Grilled sea scallops with saffron sauce): Nothing special here, I'd pass - (A-)PATATAS BRAVAS (Spicy potatoes with special tomato sauce.): Sounds simple, but these spicy potatoes are pretty amazing.

The two tapas dishes that I still dream about from Cafe Iberico are the Mejillones a la Marinera (Steamed Mussels with Marinara Sauce) and the Pulpo a la Plancha (Grilled Octopus). I am inclined to believe Cafe Iberico knows their seafood; they sure as heck cook it very well! The mussels are uber tender to the bite, and highly addictive. And the marinera sauce! Infused with a plethora of seafood-y flavours, bread MUST be dipped into it to savour up every last drop. The Pulpo? Superb. ""Chopped up in bite-size pieces, the pulpo is juicy and madd tender on the in, yet grilled to charred perfection on the out.""  bit.ly/cWyNij  It's probably just me but, does anyone else love the slight taste of char on grilled foods?!

The 4 of us were finally seated at 9:55 at a table for 2 and real hungry. There was a table for 4 people that was open right next to us but they sat us down at the table for 2, needless to say for a tapas restaurant sitting four at a 2 had me pissed off. Anyhow the waiter came, basically was pretty inattentive, never told us about the specials, and ultimately was way too quick with our dishes, at one point i had to tell him slow it down cause clearly we had no room left on the table, but did they? No, matter of fact they sped it up, as if they wanted us outta there as quick as possible. We spent more time picking up and rearranging dishes then we did eating. Everything we ordered was good, the goat cheese was excellent, patatas fritas was very good, the PINCHO DE SOLOMILLO, was the highlight such tender meat, pollo a la brasas also very good, the salmon tasty and great sauces all around, the food and the price got this place UP to a 3 star rating.

I'm not a huge fan of tapas, but the prices/portions were reasonable and made it easy to share. One major nit I had to pick was the hardness of the bread served with the tomato/goat cheese dip. I basically took one bite, and that was all I could handle. The place was surprisingly packed, for mid-week, and I felt the space could have been somewhat better used, as there was basically nothing going on at the front of the restaurant, apart from the TVs and a bar. More seating could have been placed here, to ease the hemmed in feeling of the back room/event space where we were seated. If it is a birthday you're celebrating, I believe they also throw in a complimentary dessert. Yelp is a family site, so I will only go as far as saying that the banana with two scoops of ice cream, whipped cream detailing and two candles in the ice cream scoops looked phallic, to say the least. Not sure if that is the traditional b-day dessert presentation or if kitchen staff were feeling extra creative.

2010-01-01,4.0,"Pros Great location, near the brown line and close enough to river north/loop to meet after work or before going out downtown. A lot of variety. The whole point of tapas is to go with a group and enjoy a lot of different flavors. They offer plenty of unique dishes to satisfy the adventurous and the cautious. Big thumbs up on the rotating specials that keep the experience interesting for those who go there fairly often (tapas works for picky eaters). Reasonable wait times. They don't take reservations so most people would assume the wait can be 2-2.5 hours on Fridays and Saturdays. I've never had to wait over an hour, which is enough time to share a pitcher of sangria at the bar.  And you can show up with a big group and be seated no problem. Very good food. I wouldn't call it great, but the plates vary from just ok to terrific. I've never had something I hated there, though I prefer their seafood and vegetarian dishes to their meat dishes.  The pulpo is a real winner. Affordable! My friends and I are pretty big eaters. We always order a ton of food and sangria. Still it's never more than 20 bucks a person. In river north that is a STEAL. Cons Some of the food is oily. I've found this to be the case at most tapas restaurants, and Iberico is no exception. The artichoke dish would be a lot better if it weren't swimming in oil. Boisterous atmosphere. It's a big place which is why you don't have to wait too long, but it does get loud. I like some noise, but would prefer not to have to yell. So overall it's not perfect, but I will go there any day over Ba-Ba-Reeba or Emilio's. I haven't ventured much out of the Loop/River North/Lincoln Park/Lakeview area, but I don't feel like I need to in order to get great tapas for a reasonable price.",0.9782,0.795,0.139,0.066,0.5508823529411765

We got the tostadas de pisto first -- bread with veggies on top in the cold app section.  Pretty good and went fast! Then we got the scallops in the saffron sauce.  The scallops would've been nicer if they were seared a bit more I think but overall they were good and the sauce plus the spanish rice were really good. Last of the tapas was the patatas bravas, which had a good spice to it.. was a lot of potatoes though and really filling. Finally, what I'd been waiting for: paella iberica, which is their paella with chicken, seafood, and pork -- I'd say it was good but a little disappointing because it wasn't crispy on the bottom so it could've been cooked awhile longer.  I didn't like the pork in it and maybe it could've used some sort of zing or something by adding andouille sausage instead? Finally, we ended on arroz con leche at my brother's request, which tasted like arroz con leche usually does and they give you a good portion.

One item we always get is the grilled octopus with fries.  It's lightly seasoned, but it's very tender, almost just melts in your mouth.  The baked goat cheese in tomato sauce is also outstanding and goes well with bread.  Other items that standout are the mixed seafood salad which is light and refreshing and the beef skewers with caramelized onions.  The onions are so sweet and and the Mayo based sauce goes well with the beef and onions.  All the other items are good, but not outstanding. For the most part, it offers a rustic, country Spanish cuisine that's fairly simple in flavoring and preparation (olive oil, tomato sauce, salt and pepper and occasionally saffron), but it's fairly tasty and reliable.  It's a great place for a couple of sangrias and a few plates of Tapas.",0.9945,0.783,0.21,0.006,0.47997448979591834

I was going to go to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, but I had a few friends say oohhhh noooooo and one suggested Iberico. It had a pretty solid rating on yelp, wasn't a pain in the ass to get to (I'm in Logan Square), and as a bonus was open late. My boyfriend and I oohed and ahhed at the menu and got excited. Neither of us had eaten tapas before. We get there around 11p on a Saturday night. i had a backup in case this place was open til 1:30 but the kitchen closed early but that was definitely not the case. We were seated immediately but there were still plenty of people there- perfect! It was a bit hard to hear in there at first, but as we ate (we stayed until 12:30) it emptied a bit more and it was easier. There were also a bunch of 90s music videos playing, which was kind of weird, but entertaining. We started off with a half pitcher of sangria (red). It was only $10 and we each got about 2-3 glasses out of it so it was a great deal. We split an order of Queso de Cabra, goat cheese in a tomato basil sauce. I've never had anything with goat cheese I didn't like so it was divine. As for our plates, I got Salmon Ahumado (sliced salmon, dill sauce, capers, toast) and this Spanish potato salad with tuna, peas, carrots (can't find the name as it's not online even though it wasn't a special). Both dishes were cold and very delicious. The potato salad was a huge portion so I took half home and it made for a good snack. He got Patatas Ali-Oli, Red potatoes with garlic mayonnaise sauce. He loves garlic and there were cloves of it, and I will probably be eating his leftovers from that (again, huge portions), and Gambas Al Ajillo, grilled shrimp with olive oil, garlic and wine.  We didn't have room for desert, as we were so stuffed, but we had a wonderful time! Bill for 5 plates and the 1/2 pitcher of sangria was about $51, so definitely not bad at all, also considering we have 2 portions of leftovers.

The only real complaint back then was how loud it would be because it would *always* be packed. Last night was the first time going there since then and the changes were horribly unbelievable. This place transformed into a dive.  We are living in the suburbs now and we decided that we'll chance more than just one glass of sangria. The server would not upgrade our sangria glasses to a 1/2 pitcher and said he'd have to void out the two-glass order. 'So what?!?' we're thinking, they're going to get more money! Duh! We just said 'whatever' and took the glasses. We took one sip and noticed immediately that they were watered down, significantly. When the server gave us the new plates from the adjacent table for our tapas, we noticed that the plates were not cleaned thoroughly. We felt debris/residue on the underside and could see bits on the topside. My wife and I started getting that ""What happened to this place?"" look on our faces. When the tapas did come, it didn't taste flavorful nor did it look appealing. To top it off, one of the plates (chorizo y morcillo) wasn't cooked sufficiently and we contracted food poisoning. We lived in the bathroom the next day wondering if this was enough to file a suit or notify IDPH (IL Dept of Public Health). Before we're done w/ the tapas, we asked the server for the check so we could just pay, eat what's left and get the hell out of there. A complaint to the management would not have been productive because it wasn't about the money. The quality of the visit was horrible compared to then.  This place used to be the bomb and everyone in town knew it. But after seeing some recent reviews, I'm not the only one who noticed that things were bad. They must have gotten different chefs and/or different management during the time. What a shame. Lost a once-great hang-out. We will never go back there and I recommend nobody else patrons the place.

It was absolutely DELICIOUS. I was quite tempted to lick off my plate. The beans were buttery, the cheese creamy and spicy, while the walnuts added a slight crunch and the balsamic vinegar some tang. All the ingredients complemented eachother. They really need to put this on their permanent menu! The vegetarian paella was way better than Tapas Barcelona in Evanston. The rice was cooked just right, not too firm or mushy. Plenty of vegetables like artichokes, green beans, green peppers, and more are in the dish.

2009-08-19,2.0,"Bubble Gum. This is what my coworker Andrea found on her plate as she was digging into her lunchtime tapas selection, which incidentally arrived about 20 minutes after the rest of the selections of our party of 8 did. The victim: chicken stuffed with spinach and cheese.  *sigh* So sad. A ravenous appetite instantaneously turned to disgust. Andrea lifted her fork and shared her specimen with the class, which she explained she had thought was cheese. Luckily she had smelled an unmistakable bubblicious odor before biting into it. Obviously we were grossed out and Andrea was done. Now, horrified as we were,  we're a sweet bunch (shucks we work at a non profit) and take things in stride. Yes this was unacceptable. (Really? Your line chefs chew gum while preparing food?).  But, mistakes happen. Further we were having lunch out (a rarity for us) to say goodbye to a friend of ours and didn't have  much time to spare. We were wrapping up and really, we wanted to move past this faux pas. Problem was, we couldn't get our server's attention, despite all 8 of our heads searching. Dum dee dum dee dum.  10 minutes elapse.... Now this is after we had *already* been trying to get our server's attention for about 10 minutes (prior to bubble gum incident) since she had neglected to bring a salad we had ordered. Finally, server appears, Andrea politely shows her the wad-o-bubble yum on her plate. Server asks if she would like a new entree and Andrea says no (no appetite for it now, and we have to get going), but whatever she could do to reduce the bill would be appreciated.  A few minutes later the manager (?) comes to our table. ""Suprising!"" she says, when Andrea shows her the gum.  Ummm, yeah. Then, as an afterthought, ""I'm so sorry. Can I get you a new one?"" No Andrea repeats, we have to go but whatever you can do to adjust the bill is appreciated.  ""Would you like another entree?""  Nope, no time.  ""Perhaps a chocolate tequila?"", the manager continues, obviously distressed. No, that's ok Andrea says. My other friend mentions to the manager that  she never got the Ensalada Mixta she ordered (40 minutes ago). ""Oh do you want it now"" she asks, apologetically, but with no indication that it would be brought either quickly or gratis.  Faced with the prospect of waiting for who knows how long, we said no thanks, just make sure it's not on the bill. So, we're anxiously waiting for the check, and a few minutes later we see our server....starting to pour us sangrias.  Ummm, appreciate the thought, but as we have tried to make it eminently clear, not to mention it's 2:00 pm on a Wednesday, we don't have time to linger! Can we just have THE BILL? About 7 minutes later (but who's counting) we get the bill. The chicken entree is taken off. Ok, fine.  We expected more (a few entrees comped?, something to take home?). The manager comes over and redundantly explains that the chicken entree was taken off. Then she sheepishly tells Andrea that if she *wants* she can take something else off the bill. Andrea doesn't really know what to say and  tells her to take off whatever she thinks is right. Manager disappears back up front, we're gathering our money (tip automatically added), and then as we're about to settle, the manager gives us a new bill. ""We took off the Jamon Iberico"" she exclaims.. Grrrrrreat. We retract our 7 dollars or so, and hit the friggin' road! Now, I've been to Iberico many times before. I enjoy many of the menu items such as the grilled octopus, shrimp with garlic, and goat cheese. I haven't had major problems before.  And shucks, I try to give people the benefit of the doubt.

My first experience was seven years ago---about a month after I moved to the city.  I was meeting a group of college acquaintances to meet some shared visiting friends.  We were here for a few hours and had nearly the entire menu with a never-ending supply of sangria and I still paid under $20.    I've returned many times.  I brought my 19 year old cousin and a friend on visit from OH.  They were nervous, never had tapas before.  I ordered for the table, but they didn't trust me so they added a salad ""just in case.""  The salad went uneaten and my recommendations were devoured.   Whenever I come I have to have three things:  queso de cabra (the baked goat cheese), patatas ali-oli (cold garlic potato salad), and Jamon Iberico (ham and cheese with tomato bread).  All are excellent, every time.  I also love the sangria, which is reasonably priced as well.

The Bad: - Pincho de Solomillo - I've never had beef tenderloin be not so tender.  The meat was tough, chewy and had a terrible flavor.  This was definitely my least favorite tapas of the night. - Salmon Ahumado - Not a lot of flavor going on here.  Needless to say it wasn't one of the tapas I ordered. - Mejillones a la Marinera - My first mussle experience had sand in it.  Definitely not Good Eats! - Platano al Caramelo - My caramel banana dessert would have been much better with salted caramel.  Let's just say that I'm glad it came with ice cream. The Ugly: - White sangria - I was really looking forward to the sangria from here but ours was served warm.  They tried to put tons of ice in our pitcher but several people at our table were poured a glass with no ice and left with warm sangria.  It's like trying to choke down a warm beer.  No thanks.

I highly recommend the queso de cabra, tortilla espanola, and the jamon iberico.  The paella is definitely for sharing and is definitely worth revisiting.

The food itself was great, though it helps if you have a wide palate.  For simplicity's sake, you can't go wrong with any of the shellfish (though pass on the garlic butter shrimp tapa), and you MUST get some jamon iberico.

(my friend wants to add this saltiness is out of the ordinary so it may have been a unintentional error on the part of the busy chef.)  the flavor of the paella, however masked by the saltiness, was still fantastic.  for those of you who care about this sort of thing, we did have to wait about 20 minutes for a table for 2. atmosphere was cozy and hip, one of the best combinations.

The long wait, however, can be aggrevating because there's not a lot of space to stand around and everytime I just feel that I'm blocking people by the door. Pitchers of sangria couldn't be any cheaper and always makes my trip here worth it. I always order the Patatas Ali-oli to start off with. Basically, it's cold potatoes mixed with oil, sour cream, garlic, and chives. I highly recommend it if you're not crazy about watching your weight. Their paella is to die for as well. I'm also a fan of their chicken skewer that comes with the Spanish rice and sour cream. The chicken is a bit bland, but the sauce makes up for it. Their garlic prawns make a perfect savory dish. People have mixed opinions about this place it seems. Either you're a fan or you're not. Some say it's too greasy, but I think it all depends on what you order. I, personally, love it. They offer good salads on the menu if you're concerned about the grease. I typically don't order salads when I dine out, but I've tried a few here, and honestly they're pretty good! There has never been a time where I went here and didn't leave without getting dessert. They're ice cream wrapped with crepe drizzled with strawberry syrup is amazing!!

We arrived on a Friday night which I knew would be busy. We had a birthday party of 14 people. We stayed happy during our wait with a pitcher of sangria. Not the best I've had, but good nonetheless. When we reached our table, we were so excited to get started ordering. Unfortunately we sat for at least 20 minutes before we were brought menus!! Bogus. There were servers crawling all over the place, but no one noticed us trying to get their attention?  When we finally got our menus and the very unfriendly waitress named IZEK came over, it was all huffs and puffs. She was rolling her eyes at us and nearly wrestled the menu from me when I wanted to point at a menu item because she could not seem to understand ""pork loin"". Then when my friend asked for pepperoncini, she brought sauteed green pepper and onion. Again we explained what we wanted, but instead got frozen whole jalapenos! Ahhhhhhhhhh! The food was ok. The croquettes were super tasty, but also super rich. One was enough. The calamari was the fattiest I have ever had (ick), though I liked that it was mixed with fries. The warm goat cheese in tomato sauce was the best item I tried that night by far. Crunchy, creamy, sweet, all in one! Potatoes -ok, tuna potato salad-outstanding, pork loin-ok, chicken skewers-ok.  When I asked the manager for our servers name, she was more than accommodating in trying to rectify the situation even though I was not trying to make an issue out of it. What an outstanding display of managerial skill. Thank you! Too bad the waitress stood there after giving us the stink eye. They gained one extra HUGE star from me when they brought our gay friend a birthday dessert in the shape of a HUGE penis. Two scoops of ice cream at one end and a large plantain trailing to the other side of the plate. They even added a schmear of whipped cream on the tip for added effect.

But the only way its authentic is if authentic Spanish food isn't very good. I've eaten there twice recently once with 7 other people and once with just Amanda. I've had most of the dishes on the menu between the two recent visits. And I have to say that all of the dishes seemed kind of bland. Some even seemed kind of americanized.  One special was a beef stew and I swear to god it was like Dinty Moore beef stew with slightly better beef chunks. There were no Spanish flavors. Nothing unusual. It was fine for beef stew but I would have hit up Bob Evans if that's what I wanted. It is one of the less expensive tapas places and their drinks, the sangria especially, are good and cheap. But when I go out to eat I go for the food. The atmosphere is nice. Very open a few tiers of seating, big windows, spanish television on the TV's. People are dressed in a wide range of outfits from fancy to t-shirts. I just can't highly recommend any of the tapas. Nothing stands out as significant. I have friends who vehemently disagree but for my taste, go to Cafe Babareeba. On a side note there is a good desert if you do go. The crepe filled with ice cream.  Amanda and I ordered it, looked at the ice cream filled crepe with strawberry sauce, also known as the ice cream burrito, and thought: There' no way we're gonna finsih this. And then we finished it.

Some highlights to point out is that their potato tapas are very good and their paellas are quite tasty too, so if you're in the area and don't want to make the trek to Halsted, stop on by.

2009-05-19,4.0,"Cafe Iberico serves the best Spanish tapas in Chicago. The flavors are all authentic and the menu has enough options to keep even the pickiest of eaters happy. Personal favorite menu items include the queso de cabra (baked goat cheese), tortilla espanola (spanish omelet with onion and potato), patatas bravas (spicy potatoes), and the calamares a la plancha (grilled calamari). In addition to the delicious food, their sangria is really good and priced very reasonably. I like the red best, but the white sangria is also quite good. Iberico is a great spot for group dinners as shared food creates a much more interactive experience than a typical restaurant. Only four stars for two reasons. First, they don't take reservations on weekends which makes it a weeknight only destination. Secondly, the food is very rich and my experience has been that the dinner party tends to break up when the first member of the party starts to feel sick to their stomach.",0.9895,0.744,0.232,0.023,0.5351523809523809

We could have stood in the front for hours without being acknowledged. I eventually waved someone down.  The place is ridiculously loud. I  was there on a Wednesday. It wasn't crowded, and still, I could barely hear my table mates. Tile on the walls. Till on the floors. The place does not have the acoustics for a nice relaxing meal. Really, hang some curtains, or carpet, or big fuzzy sweaters. Something! The bathrooms were surprisingly gross. I don't expect scented soap and a back massage, but cleanliness? Yes.  On the other hand, the good one, the food was really great. I really loved the goat cheese one that other reviewers have also mentioned. The Sangria was pretty good too. Prices were also better then some of the other local tapas places. We even splurged on dessert! Our waiter was stellar. He was so attentive. We never wanted for anything and were so well taken care of.  I guess overall, Cafe Iberico was a win for me. Despite its shortcomings, what I really come for is the food.

We arrive around 8 pm on a Friday night, not surprisingly there's a 30 min wait due to this place's immense popularity. The hostess at the front then tells us that there's a new restaurant ""Pintxos"" upstairs, which just opened and has the same owner and chef as Iberico. She assured us that there's no wait and bonus: you can order the same food as downstairs! What, no wait and the best of both worlds? I'm there. We then proceed to go upstairs and was promptly ignored by another set of servers upstairs for maybe 20 mins. When someone finally does the honor of gracing our table she firmly states that the two restaurants are separate with different menus and if I want downstairs food I must haul my ass downstairs. Not being interested in what Pintxos has to offer (an uninspiring meager collection of yakitori wanna-bes), we went downstairs to ask the first hostess what the dealio was. She tells me in an extremely impatient tone that she told me THREE times that we CANNOT order Cafe Iberico food upstairs. WTF!!! Either she's suffering from a dissociative disorder or BOTH me and my friend misheard over the 10 decibels-over-hearing-damage-threshold eurotrash pop that was blasting the entire night. I'm rather inclined towards the first. So at this point, instead of inviting her to taste a can of whoop ass outside, we sucked it up and put our names on the list (we were hungry and we've already waited so long!). Long story/wait short, we ended up sitting in the bar area after an hr wait, by then our names still hasn't been called.

I thought the Sangria was well priced for a pitcher - I think it was $18  - although I thought for as much as we drank they were pretty weak (or maybe I have a high tolerance?) We waited at the bar for 35 minutes to be seated which was fine once we got a seat and our sangria. When we were told the wait (this was a saturday night) they said 30-40 minutes and said we could go up to some other restaurant upstairs that has the same Sangria and I think slightly different cheaper looking food. They were trying to sell it too hard  and seemed kinda sketchy about it so we said we'd wait.  We ordered 2 hot tapas and some paella between two people and it was a decent amount of food. We got shrimp, mushrooms, and the iberico paella - they were all decent - nothing stellar. There were like 5 shrimps...ok...a ton of mushrooms which were good, and the paella was good. My main complaint was that everything came out separately - like mm let me eat my two shrimp then 20 minutes later my paella...then another 20 minutes later my mushrooms... Maybe its just me but I thought the whole point of tapas was that they came out at the same time and shared a bunch of different ones with people? Wait staff was slow and we thought they forgot about us a few times.

Last week, my family was in town and hadn't yet tried Iberico so... new victims! Yahoo!

Of course, plates of jamon iberico + manchego and pulpo* were necessary, all of which were tasty. The roasted mushrooms were also a fan favorite - just make sure your fellow diners either have gum on hand or are turned on by garlic breath of monsoon proportions. I only wish the tortill didn't have the aftertaste of refrigerator chill last time, because it's usually quite good. There are a few things missing from the menu that Ba-Ba-Reeba has - bacon wrapped dates and better baked goat cheese, but Iberico's menu is more authentic which gives it the edge. *Re: pulpo. You love it or you hate it. If you hate it, it's probably because you haven't had it prepared the right way and the ""texture freaks [you] out."" When done right, it should be warm, soft and delicate, not reminiscent of your old bike tires.

Your patatas bravas (aka spicy potatoes) are no longer a culinary delight.  Gone are the days of lightly fried, crispy spicy potatoes.  Instead, it's been replaced with some spicy, yet lackluster, mushy potatoes.   The squid I once craved is a little bland, completely lacking that garlicy/lemon zest.  It's just 'blah' in my eyes. The chorizo plate, which was once magnificently presented in all its grandeur, now appeared as some small pieces of burnt chorizo, randomly strewn all over a plate.   Oh, and seriously?  You're going to replace manchego cheese with swiss and hope no one notices?  That's a little sinful, I think. Your pitchers of sangria ($15) are still delightful, although a little more watered down from what I remember.  The saving grace of the meal was the duck special and the creme brulee-esque dessert.   The service was fantastic, as always.  Glad the decline in food quality didn't spill over the service.  Good to know!

The Croquetas De Pollo-  Chicken and ham puffs served with ali-oli sauce.  The chicken and ham was ground together and lightly fried.  These were pretty awesome, and I really enjoyed them with the sauce.  I would recommend this if you come here. yelp.com/biz_photos/gSMA… Queso De Cabra-  Baked goat cheese with fresh tomato basil sauce.  The goat cheese was soft, creamy and very tasty.  The tomato basil sauce was great, but I wish there was some more seasoning to calm the overwhelming tomato flavor.  yelp.com/biz_photos/gSMA… I am sure this would have been much better if I was with some people and was able to try more items.  This is great for groups, and not so great by yourself.  The food was ok, but I wasn't blown away.",0.9908,0.779,0.221,0.0,0.6587481962481962

2009-03-15,3.0,"First off, this place is HUGE!!  When you first walk through the door it seems to be a small, quaint tapas joint, but start wandering around a bit and you'll wish you left a trail of popcorn to help you find your way back to the table.   We went on a Friday evening without a reservation, and ended up waiting for about 30 minutes or so.  Once seated, the service wasn't bad at all, with plenty of helpful suggestions if you're not sure what route to take, which is definitely possible given the extensive menu. I ended up with Patatas Bravas, Queso De Cabra, Calamares a la Plancha.  This proved to be an order a bit bigger than I could handle, but it was super tasty.  I have to throw out a big kudos on the squid.  As a rule, I'm very wary of ordering calamari in the Midwest, but our server assured me it was tasty, and man oh man it was!  The lemon & garlic combination was subtle but nice, and the squid was FRESH!!  That made me really happy, as I was more than expecting to work on a plate of rubber bands, but you could easily cut it with a fork.  I was really impressed. The potatoes were also really good, and I'm not sure what is used for the spice but it was really tasty.   The atmosphere is okay, though it does tend to err a tab on the corporate feel.  Granted, there isn't a lot of goofy shit on the walls `a la TGI Friday's, but it feels a bit like that rather than an authentic tapas place.  All in all, it was a great experience. Would I consider this a top-shelf tapas place?  Probably not.  It's not bad at all, and the food is definitely decent, but the biggest advantage in my opinion is the value.  It may not necessarily be the best tapas in the world, but it is damn good tapas for the price.  A party of two can easily get out for under $40, sangria included, and considering what that same amount would buy you nearly anywhere else, I would say you're way ahead. I wouldn't be afraid to recommend it at all.  Well done Cafe Iberico. cafeiberico.com",0.9984,0.718,0.246,0.036,0.5986182336182336

I must admit that I was initially intimidated by many items on the menu... I don't like fish, and vegetables aren't exactly my style. Not to mention the fact that I can't speak Spanish to save my life, so I didn't know how to say the names of any of the dishes. Whatever. I ordered in my pathetic butchered version of Spanish, accompanied by much pointing to the menu. It took a while for our food to arrive, maybe because we were in such a large group. But when it did... Oh boy. The closest thing I've ever had to a culinary orgasm ensued. The champinones... Incredible. Make sure to dip your bread in the sauce--DO NOT WASTE IT. IT IS FARRRR TOO GOOD. The patatas alioles... potato salad with garlic?! Could it get any better?! And oh my God, the aceitunas... I love olives, but they take it to a new level. One day, I decided to be a bit adventurous and try the queso de cabra, or goat cheese. Greatest decision of my life. I love this place. I've never had outstanding service here, but I could frankly care less, when the food is this good.",0.981,0.791,0.158,0.051,0.44775020614306327

2009-03-14,4.0,"I arrived here with some friends on a Saturday night and only had to wait a few minutes before getting a table in the back room. The atmosphere consisted of a packed, energetic crowd with almost everyone engaged in very loud conversations. So my group definitely had to speak louder than usual to hear each other. This was the main reason why I decided to give this place 4 stars instead of 5. The service was excellent as our waitress was very friendly, attentive, and efficient in bringing our dishes and drinks. Great smile with an excellent attitude. As we waited for our food, I ordered the Sangria which I heard many friends rave about. I was impressed with it as it had a great balance of fruity flavors and aromas that matched well the red wine in the Sangria. Very tasty and delicious. Not the best Sangria I ever ordered, but definitely in my top 5. For dinner, we ordered the TOSTADAS DE PISTO tapas and the QUESO DE CABRA tapas. The Tostadas De Pisto was toasted bread topped with stewed eggplant, peppers, onion, Zucchini tomato and olive oil. The eggplant had amazing texture and was cooked to perfection, and the peppers and onions added a great kick to the dish. The Zucchini tomato (I never knew there was a Zucchini tomato!) was delicious, and the olive oil which was drizzled on top added a light, fruity flavor to the dish. Overall, I was very satisfied with these tapas. The other tapas we ordered was the Queso De Cabra which is simply baked goat cheese with fresh tomato basil sauce. The goat cheese was a little undercooked for my preference, but the taste was fantastic... very rich and creamy without being too salty. The sauce was so fresh and good. You could tell the sauce was homemade. The combination of the sauce with the cheese was a winner. Definitely a delicious but light tapas meal. Overall, my experience here was great. The entire order cost us less than $30 so very reasonable for the quality of the food and Sangria. My only disappointment was that we weren't hungry enough to order a couple more tapas dishes. I definitely plan on coming back here in the near future with an empty stomach so I could indulge in more of the tapas!",0.9985,0.745,0.24,0.015,0.5584025974025975
2009-03-13,4.0,"On my first night in Chicago, about a week ago, me and the girlfriend went to Café Iberico. We got there and the place was pretty crowded for a Thursday night. They sat us in the back room and the waiter came over to take our drink orders.  Before we even got the drink they came over and asked us if we would mind switching one table over. Of course we didn't mind, but I am still unsure why we needed to. They switched us between a 2 person table and a 2 person table, so that couldn't be why. About 3 minutes later another 2 person group was sat down, which seemed very odd. The waiter was extremely nice, and ever gave us a Spanish lesson after we mispronounced our order. The sangria we ordered was delicious, and break we had was delicious as well. As our main dish me and the girlfriend split three things, we got a bread dish that came with a pesto type sauce, cheese and some red sauce. Additionally we split 2 different fish dishes. All of the food was very delicious; however I thought the portions were a bit small. The mashed potatoes also came with some greens in it that wasn't listed in the menu, which was a bit disappointing. We both definitely enjoyed ourselves and the prices were very reasonable as well. My only major complaint about the place was the noise level. I am not sure why, but it was incredibly loud in there, even in the dining room area, not just the bar side. At times it was even hard to hear my girlfriend over the noise. Overall though, it definitely was a great expierence.",0.983,0.808,0.138,0.055,0.5422633744855967
2009-03-12,5.0,"Cafe Iberico is my favorite go-to restaurant in Chicago.  They serve the tastiest and most reasonably priced Tapas I've ever had.  The food comes out very quickly, and the service is always great.  I have never tried something from their menu that I didn't love.  The portions are generous compared to other Tapas restaurants.  The sangria is so inexpensive...I think it's $7 for a half pitcher, which will get 2 or 3 people well buzzed.  Parking is pretty easy near the restaurant.  I always find an open meter quickly.  After trying Cafe Ba Ba Reeba last night and leaving disappointed, I will never again stray from my beloved Cafe Iberico. P.S.  If you're new to Iberico, try the following menu favorites:  Canalon de Atun (my absolute favorite), Croquetas, Jamon Iberico, and Salmon Ahumado.  You will also never go wrong if you order one of the day's specials...ESPECIALLY if it is served with saffron sauce.",0.9627,0.801,0.161,0.038,0.6212481962481963

Service never fails, food is always hot and tasty, and the price is right.  A few things to try if you've never been here before:  Queso de Cabra - Very tasty goat cheese with a toasted garlic (?) bread  Patatas Bravas - Potatoes with a pepper tomato sauce. You will have a lot of sauce left over to eat up with bread.  Championes a la Plancha - Sauteed mushrooms. Very good. Interesting (in a good way) with the sauce from the potatoes.  Pincho de Pollo - Skewered chicken with this yummy yellow rice.  Croquetas de Hamon - OMG, these are awesome, and you will definitely want to have some of the spread they bring with it on bread.  Paella Iberica - Yellow rice with several different small veggies and meats. Comes in the skillet.  Salmon a la Pimeinta - Lovely cooked salmon just golden with some asparagus and a yummy green sauce. I wish I knew what it was.  I once came in with a group of six, and at the end of our lunch, we paid $120 including tip! That's TWENTY DOLLARS per person including soda and desert! I cannot express how awesome this place is.

I have eaten at Iberico upon many occasions and with lots of different people, from just grabbing lunch while working in River North to a large group event for a staff party one year. And every time it's the same; absent service, bland food, and a dining experience leaving me still hungry and wondering why everyone loves Iberico so much. The atmosphere itself is very Spanish and I do love the bar area and large tables in the main space, but the food itself is basically what you could get at other tapas joints and is nothing to write home about.",0.9806,0.813,0.179,0.008,0.4695578231292517
2009-01-26,4.0,"So, we'll call it ""my bad"" for not having the foresight that a River North restaurant would require some form of reservations for a Friday night...sorry to my threesome date for the grueling hour and a half plus wait that we endured (despite being told 45 minutes at the name-giving).   And, on a side note: to the several angry patrons who b*tched out the hostesses for making them wait for so long...relax.  Not their fault.  Have a drink.  Be satisfied with giving the party of 25 (who was there from before we got there until we left) a dirty look on your way to your own table for attempting to dine like the Europeans...and then have another drink. Despite the horrendous wait (and the WAY off estimated time), we had a great dinner here.  Great because for the three of us, we had a pitcher of sangria and more tapas than we could handle and our bill was $54.  We were full on that.  And having waited so long, I was definitely tipsy.  Bonus. Patatas bravas were good, as were the gambas...pork tenderloin?  Yes please.  (However, after all this, we were rockin' some stanky breath...good thing we were rolling with gum.)  And of course, the queso de cabra...mmm!

Cafe Iberico is a little piece of Spain in Chicago. The main dining-room reminded me of a place I went to outside of Barcelona, another life-time ago.....no - I mean it...like 17 years ago.... It's warm and inviting and it almost feel like you are entering someone's place with all the dishes displayed on the back wall. The decor is not fancy at all, just rustic and straight to the point. Much like the cuisine. There is a large choice of cold and hot tapas on the menu and they also carry specials but everything you will get is simple and authentic. The most expensive seafood items are around $8-9. Most glasses of wine are around $6, and it's the same thing for cocktails!!!! The delicious desserts (their Crema Catalana is to die for) are only $4..........it doesn't get any better than that. So yes....Chicago has still a lot to do in the climate/weather department to match lovely Spain but at least you can catch a glimpse of its sweet sweet life at this wonderful place... Oh - and if you mind the noise, go there in the afternoon....it is lively but totally manageable. And it slows you down - Spanish style.",0.9859,0.791,0.171,0.038,0.5819324194324194

However, it has a lot of energy, and if that's what you're in the mood for, you won't be disappointed. And I bumped into a girl from my grade school and high school who was at the table next to mine. Its popularity makes it a place to randomly see people you might otherwise not meet again. Our table was too small for all of the dishes we ordered; no problem, we just ate more quickly. Well, I guess I'd prefer to not have to do that. But there was a lot of food to share. I delighted in a few vegan dishes: marinated olives (with whole cloves of garlic - yum!), artichoke salad (with red and yellow peppers and vinaigrette, grilled mushrooms (with garlic and olive oil) and patatas bravas. All were delicious and hit the spot. Mmm, the patatas bravas here are some of the most perfectly spicy ones I can recall; I'm drooling for the mushrooms as I think about them. I didn't have the patience to wait for veggie paella, but that's my fault for eating a small lunch. I'd love to try it some time.

We ordered 5 dishes to split between the 3 of us, and we thought it was too much food. And our waiter had recommended 6 dishes!! My favorites were the spicy potatoes and the tortilla espanada (sp??).

2008-12-08,4.0,"Skip BaBa Reeba, Skip Emilio's, go to Iberico! I hesitate to say I have ever dined at Cafe Iberico because I would say the dining experience at Iberico is more of a celebration than a food experience.  The only contingency related to this review is that you should definitely go with at least four people so you may adequately sample the range of tapas available. Also, one more item, if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait, wait, and wait some more.  When you do get a table, you will be packed in like sardines.  But if you love tapas, this will not bother you because eating this wonderful food is truly a communal experience.  There's a reason Iberico can pack them in, and it's not just the amazing prices. Unlike Emilio's, the portion sizes of the tapas are quite a bit bigger and you truly do get a good bang for your buck.  Must-have Tapas include Patatas Ali-Oli, Queso de Cabra, Croquetas de Pollo, Canelon de Atun, and Championes de la Plancha.  Translation: Garlicky Potato Salad that will make you a social leper yet feel as though you have died and gone to garlic heaven, a yummy marinara sauce with hot goat cheese and toasted bread, succulent and rich (you can really only have one bite!) fried ham ""puffs"", a great rendition of Tuna canelloni, and grilled garlic and olive oil infused mushrooms.   This is the place for people who have chronic indecisiveness when it comes to ordering.  The beauty of tapas is the ability to order many items affordably and within the range of your appetite.  This is not the place for people who don't like to share.   I have been to Iberico with one or two folks who like to hoard plates or refuse to try new things, which inevitably creates whispering at the table. The Sangria is pretty good, I mean, it's pretty cheap wine and it does the trick.  The full bar is of particular convenience for parties beginning their nights for pre-drinking tapas.

I Started with the Croquettes which were awesome, had some sliced meats, the Spicy Potatoes, which are pictured, were phenomenal and then had the goat cheese marinara which was lacking basil but still good and then ended up getting the Paella. I think the Paella was something like the everything paella as it had all the seafood, peas, etc, but also chicken and pork. There wasn't one thing on the menu which I wouldn't order again. The sangria was good as well and the valet parking was only $10 which isn't bad for downtown. Now the problems: Having a restaurant that doesn't take reservations makes about as much sense as having a restaurant that doesn't serve food. That being said, we had a large group so we got there at a round 6:30 and before I could finish my first mini-picher of Sangria we had been seated. Not only was it way crowded with the ""couldn't get into Gibson's"" crowd but it was at least 400 degrees in side and I had to go wife beater which ended up being a little out of place. Not only that but there were these little tiny gnat like bugs which kept flying in front of my face which isn't all that appealing when you are trying to eat. Apparently due to the extreme temperatures the bugs didn't realize that it was winter and haven't gone into hibernation yet.

""Yeah, that waitress is amazingly cute, I would totally tap..."" ""What?"" Eating at Iberico is sort of like trying to eat tapas at a rock concert.  I went there for a birthday party last night and when we first arrived at about 6:00 p.m., I remembered how much I used to love Cafe Iberico.  We were having a nice dinner over sangria, talking about what most people do at a 30th birthday party but then suddenly the whole thing changed. By about 7:00 p.m., our group couldn't hear the person next to them.  We had been sat in the large back room when it was nearly empty but when it was full, it was a cacophony of conversation and Euro music.  I don't even know why they play music overhead because people trying to speak louder and louder to have a discussion even drown that out. Still, Cafe Iberico is a great place to go with a large group of people (with how much this place keeps expanding, including having a deli in the back now, I'm amazed there are still waits).  The bill is very easy to split since almost all of the dishes are the same price ($4.95 or $5.95, with some seafood dishes being $6.95) and large enough to split between quite a large group (we had eight and all of us got to sample every dish). Just bring $20 and the check will pretty much wind up splitting equally; no matter how many people are there.  I don't know how this works, but somehow it always ends up true. Word of advice: it takes 30 minutes or so to make the paella, so it's a good idea to order this first and then drink sangria before ordering the rest if you want them to arrive at the same time.  The paella is $8.95 (for the vegetarian) to $10.95 but it is gigantic.   One thing that I think has improved at Cafe Iberico since I used to be a regular is the selection of vegetarian tapases. From the spicy Patatas Bravas to the zesty queso de cabra (this place uses goat cheese to the best effect I've seen), there is a glut of choice. I would have thanked the group I was with for this choice immensely, except they wouldn't have been able to hear me anyway.",0.9943,0.849,0.13,0.021,0.48105247465712575

The mushrooms were just button mushrooms, but the marinade is what made them.  I could eat the whole dish, seriously.  The seafood salad was like ceviche but cooked.  It was seasoned lightly with a mix of olive oil, lemon, salt, and pepper.  It went fast so we ordered 2.  The baked goat cheese was served with toasted bread and was average.  The grilled shrimp was garlicy and plump, but it did have a slight fishy taste.  My friend said she had a hard time chewing on the beef skewer, but it was ok for me.  The spicy potatoes were simply fried potato cubes sauteed in a tomato based sauce.  One of my friends said it wasn't to his liking because of the mild curry (or some other spice) flavor.  Chicken noodle soup was more like noodle chicken stew.  The noodles were soggy and there wasn't any broth.  I won't be ordering that again.  In my opinion, the mussels are the best deal.  Fresh and plump, they were cooked in a tomato broth.  It was excellent for dipping in the left over bread and sopping up the remaining stock.  Yum! Their sangria is pretty good too.  Often times I encounter sangria that is a) too watery or b) too harsh (possibly unripe fruit or cheap wine?).  But it had a nice balance of sweetness and tartness that made it refreshing and easy to drink... while looking at the cute waiters :oD  The service was friendly and quick.  They included gratuity for our party of 6.",0.9976,0.792,0.183,0.025,0.569047619047619

2008-09-29,4.0,"Iberico has become a personal favorite of mine.  Mainly because of one never-fail reason: Cheap sangria.  I also work nearby, and that's convenient.    This place gets cer-azy busy later on most nights, but you can saunter right up to the bar and order food to avoid waiting for a table.  There is seating on the main level and lower level - 3 separate bar areas, and the place is pretty huge!  The servers really seem to hustle too, although it does seem to get pretty hectic in there.   Disappointments:   1. I think they recycle the bread starters here, and I was very sad/disgusted to see this because I always wolf down the bread every single time.  However, while sitting at the bar one time, my friend and I witnessed two 1/2 empty bread baskets come to the bar staff - not to the kitchen? not the trash can? and we then lost track of what happened to the bread, but our guess is that it went out as 1 full recycled basket.  Maybe this happens at a lot of restaurants, I don't know...  Ignorance is bliss.  2. Menu prices have increased and I'm not happy about it.  All in all, Iberico is pretty cheap, but they have risen a bit and the dishes, as expected for a tapas place, are small.  Very tasty though.  The scallops are amazing!!!",0.9735,0.773,0.154,0.074,0.5462222222222223

While the white sangria isn't as good as red sangria, it's still pretty rockin'.  And they put oranges in it! 2. I'd been scared to try octopus for, well, ever.  Guess what?  When it's char-grilled and smothered in delicious seasonings, it's actually really tasty.  Not at all chewy like I anticipated.  I'm most definitely ordering it again. 3. One goat cheese with marinara plate is NEVER enough for five people.  You must order two...bare minimum. 4. For those budgeting babes and fellas out there, Café Iberico is one of the most cost-effective restaurants out there.  For a table of 5 people, our bill was $120... including tax and tip.  Can't go wrong! Café Iberico has always been a go-to spot to bring out of town guests when you're looking for a restaurant that isn't too stuffy or fancy.  It's loud, vibrant, the food is dependably good and sharing small plates always promotes good conversation.",0.9773,0.74,0.187,0.074,0.4964912280701754

2008-09-19,3.0,"I know the prices looked good in comparison to some other tapas places and that, yes, tapas places inflate their prices because they can BUT for the price, I expected a slightly more substantial portion especially since the website said 2 tapas plates per person were enough.  (As a general rule I go for three but i thought 'Hey!, the restaurant knows best...') Its only enough if you fill up on the bread and oil and fork out money on coffee and dessert. The other main gripe of mine was the rushed service. Don't expect a good review if you don't let us spend enough time in the place to enjoy it! I felt more like a number than a paying customer. This is not a game of how many people can we get through the door each night, its supposed to be a relaxing authentic Spanish atmosphere. Epic fail on that count. However, the three stars are on account of how delicious the grilled shrimp in garlic and white wine was. I could happily just order that and skip the rest.  I also ordered the grilled squid with olive oil, garlic and lemon juice- tasty, but the rings were even more rubbery than usually expected. The rest of that dish was among the best squid I'd eaten. The sangria was alright, the red wine was a tiny bit sharper than I like, but thats just a preference. If I ever went back, I'd order the white. Dessert was delicious- I had the weekly special which was a chocolate  ladyfinger based dessert with strawberries and strawberry sauce. Heavenly.

Since then, Iberico just seems to have gone downhill. I've visited plenty more Tapas bars that offer way more in selection and with better quality! Seating is ample so it's good for groups and you will be in and out in a flash if you prefer that. I was looking forward to a Spanish cheese plate, a staple at tapas bars. Heck, I think even McDonald's has one on their Extra Value Menu. Not avaiable at Cafe Iberico! We did get the Jamon plate that had slices of cured ham, manchego cheese, along with bread piled high with seasonless raw tomatoes. So many tomatoes that the bread grew soggy under the weight. What wonders a little Sea Salt would've done. My dining partner got the Olive plate and it looked divine. One olive she described as ""chewy"" and I think I talked for the next ten minutes as she ate it! Our fave of the night was the Queso de Cabra (creamy goat cheese and a tomato basil sauce) and it's so fun to say!

Some of their best dishes: -Tortilla Espanola - sounds a little bland in theory, especially to this carnivore, but it's surprisingly delicious. -Pincho de Solomillo- if you like the idea of caramelized onions and well-cooked, well-seasoned beef, this is definitely one to get. -Pulpo a la Plancha (octopus and fry-like potatoes) boyfriend, who is seafood-averse, actually liked this dish -said the octopus was really tender. -Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp sauteed in olive oil and garlic) -enough said. -Baked goat cheese- a tapas favorite, and iberico always does it well. -Giant ice-cream filled crepes with strawberry sauce that can be difficult to finish after the gluttony one can't help but engage in during an iberico dinner... -Paella Iberica - amazing paella. this dish is so easy to screw up - cook it improperly and you can burn the outside. Iberico makes it so every piece of this dish is edible.  -Last but certainly not least, the sangria (red!) is sweet, seductive and sneaks up on you like *that*. The only potential pitfall - this place's bathrooms tend to look like those at a frat party as the night gets busier and the crowd grows denser. So drink that sangria cautiously, friends. One of the most important things to note: Iberico doesn't take reservations. Know that you may wait for an hour - or 5 minutes. If you're looking for a date place with set times, go to Cafe Ba-ba-reeba or Emilio's instead. That being said, this was a huge get-together place for my friends, who could stand to wait 45 minutes together, sun or snow.

The upside: The Tapas was tremendous.  Our group of 11 shared just about everything around and the only things I found to be so-so were the shrimp (Gambas Al Ajillo; which were cooked just right, but only tasted so-so) and one of the potato dishes(Patatas Bravas) which we ordered two of.   The first one came out just right and the second one someone must have spilled the cayenne pepper in. All the other dishes were simply wonderful.  The fish and steak were done just right.  The taste was full, but not too spicy and the prices were surprisingly low.  Even the clams (Almejas En Salsa)  where wonderfully done and taseful, something I can rarely say with clams. The restaurant was beautifully decorated and seemed quite authentic.   The downside: Cafe Iberico is EXTREMELY noisy.   I could barely hear the person next to me, let alone across the table.  It would seem a simple thing for the management to install some sort of sound abatement but it has not been done.  I found myself yelling on more than one occasion, and missed most of the conversation.  I did not try the desert, but several people had the Flan and found it mediocre at best. In summary I had a wonderful time at Cafe Iberico.  I loved the food and the decoration.   However the sound problem is something that was quite frustrating.  This is not the place that I would take a date or expect to be able to transact any conversation.  So if you're looking for a great, cheap meal I heartily recommend it, but if you're looking to socialize, go elsewhere. - Andrew",0.9835,0.79,0.144,0.066,0.5974789915966385

This time, it was part of my week of culinary indulgence (still on-going), and subsequent bodily expansion.  Actually, when I came here yesterday, it was about 1 PM. The last meal I had was half a bowl of oatmeal at 6 AM. I was famished. No, rather, I thought my stomach was eating itself and my blood glucose level was so low my friends had to practically carry me to the restaurant. I was a sad sight. I was led to a table, sat down. Opened the menu, and as I tried to read, the room spun around. I think I mumbled something to the tune of ""just order for me"" and closed the menu. A few moments later, the bread basket arrived. I scarfed down a few pieces, dipped in olive oil with a sprinkling of salt and pepper.  Finally, the room stopped spinning. I looked around. The space is actually quite large! And beautiful tile everywhere.  My favorite dish was definitely the scallops. That and the seafood paella. I'm coming back for those. We also enjoyed the chorizo dish and the grilled octopus - not rubbery or chewy but really awesome with the fried potatoes! I also really loved the potato salad which was a surprise because I usually hate anything that is suggestive of mayonnaise. Delightfully light! The desserts were so scrumptious and not to be missed. They were decadent and sweet without being too sweet or overly rich. Just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth and make you say ""mmmm"".  Service was decent, but nothing spectacular.

As we entered the place, a waiter carrying multiple glasses of soda almost spilled them on us as he used the foyer as a shortcut into the dining area. Then we entered. The first thing I noticed was the floor... broken/cracked vinyl tile. Ick.  The second thing I noticed as we walked into the dining room was the NOISE. Definitely not conducive to dating if you actually want to talk to your partner.  The third thing was the most disconcerting - the smell. And no, it wasn't a nice food smell. The place smelled like it had been washed, from walls to floors to table tops, with a dirty bacteria-laden mop or dishcloth.   The smell was so distracting that we started losing our appetite.  The place was filled with families and the table next to us (10 people) were letting their 5 year olds run around, even bumping into my chair. Seriously, I felt like I was at McDonald's. A waiter finally came and took our drink order, and then we waited 15 minutes for our drinks! I had taken the waiter's suggestion and ordered a Cosmo, but it was terrible. It tasted like water mixed with vodka and red food coloring.  After waiting for another 10 minutes for the waiter to return to take our food order, we had had enough.

Oh, Cafe Iberico, you let me down. THE SHAME. First of all, noise just reverberates in this place. My friend and I were screaming across the table to each other, and even then we had trouble hearing. There was a severe miscommunication at one point which resulted in him thinking I had asked him to be my maid of honor (I just got engaged). That was awkward.  There was this gigantic douche face who was sitting at the table across from us who was squeaking his shoes on the floor (you know how converse squeak on tile?) and it was VERY loud. Eardrum pinching loud. I would flinch every time he did that, it was genuinely annoying. The servers didn't do anything about it. They just stood around waiting for him to stop, even though most everyone on our side of the restaurant was visibly annoyed.  We got a goat cheese/tomato sauce tapa to start off with. It came with little buttered pieces of bread. Pretty good...although Twist was better. We both got different kinds of paella for our main course. What they lacked in taste/imagination they made up for in size. It was basically a big ass, bland bowl of rice, veggies, and a stick of butter. Huge let down.  I'm not impressed with this place.

Then the next few dishes were attempted to be served to 2 other tables near us and they kept saying it wasn't theirs, and we kept trying to tell the servers it was ours.

But where they lost me is when the European born and bred dining companion ordered the Paella, waited the forty five plus minutes (we were in no hurry) and paced our selves for plenty of sangria, brochettes and lots and lots of jamon.  But it really disappointed and he is a Chef with an aunt that is from Spain and to see the disappointment in his face when he bit into the long awaited Paella really made me take away the fourth star.  It was old. When you wait forty five plus minutes for something that is suppose to have been made to order, you expect it to be a fresh prep, not left over from yesterday and then reheated.  The seafood was a little skimpy and tough to the bite and the paella itself tasted like reheated leftovers.    We enjoyed everything else but when they push something on you and gear you up for the amazing finish, it really needs to live up to it.  And why no fifth star from someone who tries to find the good in everything?  Our server apparently underestimated our needs for well, service and while we plotted and schemed our way around the menu, we couldn't place an order because no one would take it!  The busboy finally got someone to get us more drinks and then we placed a food order with them and they sent us the wrong items.  Made the best of it though because it was twenty minutes before the server resurfaced.

We chose 21 dishes and 3 desserts between the eight of us.  It was more than enough food to go around.  The plates that I thought were the most appetizing were their Champinones a la Plancha (marinated mushrooms), Patatas Ali-Oli (garlic potato salad), Gambas al ajillo ( garlic shrimp), Ensalada De Pimientos Asados ( roasted peppers and toast), and also their braised leg of lamb which was the special of the day.  I definitely do not recommend any of their chicken dishes, and definitely pass on the sausage plate.  Nothing was especially to die for and I would never go out of my way to eat here.  With drinks, our total equaled $30 a person including tax and tip. What I find strange is that only the busboys bring the food to your tables.  The wait staff only comes by to take your order or to check on your table.  I felt awful seeing these men carry 12 steaming hot plates along the length of their arms.  I hope they are tipped out handsomely.  What I find disgusting about this place is that they do not provide serving spoons.  Yes, tapas are meant to be shared and passed, but I have always been raised not to use the fork or spoon that touches my mouth onto a plate that is shared.  Even though all of us are good friends, I still don't like the concept of not having a serving spoon.  Lo and behold, my mother raised me well.  It is now Wednesday and all 8 of us have the flu.  We are congested, feverish, and we have all been hacking something fierce, our noses are runny, and we have water in our lungs.  4 of us have called in sick twice already.  Thanks.  Thanks a heck of a lot. P.S.  They only accept reservations during the day, and good luck finding parking...anticipate $10 valet parking plus tip.",0.9769,0.763,0.142,0.095,0.6492346938775511

We got the salad, tortilla, calamari, scallops, queso de cabra (goat cheese), and pincho de solomillo (the meat on the stick which I didn't actually see on the menu). Then we got two desserts. It was me (fat kid) and two ladies (light eaters), so that was enough food. Everything was tasty, except the pincho de solomillo (not even served with horseradish - the horror), but the scallops and calamari were VERY good. I didn't like the sangria very much. For dessert we had the banana with caramel which was wicked awesome, despite the disturbingly phallic presentation. We also got flan, which was disappointing imo.  I would go back if it's convenient, but I wouldn't wait in line for two hours. Edit 5/31/08: They're losing one star and are lucky it's not two. They told us our wait would be 20 minutes. After half an hour we went back to check why we hadn't been called. They kept saying we were next as they sat people. Over and over. Don't really appreciate being lied to. I also didn't enjoy some things this time. The seafood salad was pretty gross and the pincho de solomillo just isn't good (wish I'd remembered from my last visit).

2008-01-22,4.0,"You know how people talk about having that kind of friend that they can go without seeing for months or years, and when they meet up again it's like no time has passed?  Maybe there's a different hairstyle, or they've been exercising and look really good, but aside from the minor differences, the two of them pick up like they talked yesterday.  Well Cafe Iberico is like that. The Sadie and I love Cafe Iberico.  We'd probably eat there more often if we lived in River North or somewhere along LaSalle, Dearborn, or Clark streets.  As it is we try to eat there every couple of months, just so we catch up with our infrequently seen tapas friend.  Neither The Sadie nor I are originally from Chicago.  And until I moved to Chicago, I'd never had tapas.  I'm an adventurous eater, but I'd never had the opportunity to try them.  So once The Sadie introduced me to them about 4 years ago, I've been smitten.   Typically our dinner will consist of the Sangria (buy a pitcher, it's more economical that way), and about 2-3 dishes.  We love the Jamon Iberico.  The Iberian ham is like pancetta or prosciutto and complements the tomato topped toast and Manchego cheese very well.  We also love the Raxo Adobodo (pork loin with fries) and the Pincho De Solomillo (skewed beef tenderloin).  The caramelized onions that come with the Pincho are dark and sweet and balance the beef exceptionally well.  We've tried the Patatas Ali-Oli and I found them too heavy with mayonnaise, and The Sadie was completely non-plussed, but I think it could be that the order came late in the meal.   Some of the other dishes I've tried and enjoyed are the Plato Combinado (Spanish coldcuts), the Salmon Ahumado (salmon w/ capers and a fresh dill cream.  Yummy!), Pincho de Pollo (skewered chicken w/ Spanish rice), Queso de Cabra (baked goat cheese), the Croquetas De Pollo (deep fried ham and chicken puffs), and Chorizo Y Morcilla (a combo platter of Spanish sausages.  One of my personal faves.) I love the flan at Cafe Ibrico and the Plantano al Caramelo (sauted banana w/ caramel sauce) is a favorite of The Sadie. Unfortunately there are a couple of drawbacks to dining at Cafe Iberico.  The first is planning when you go.  Early is always better.  After 5pm, the restaurant fills quickly with downtown workers (secretaries, office assistants, wage slaves, and cube dwellers).  Once this happens, the wait grows exponentially.  So if you go after 5pm, be aware of it.   Another drawback is the noise.  In most of the restaurant the ceiling is low and the walls are painted brick meaning that when the restaurant is full an average conversation has to be conducted at a near shout.  The large dining room on the north side of the restaurant really needs to cover the walls in some sort of heavy drapery to cut the noise to a manageable level.  The Sadie and I dined there early one Saturday (about 2:30 pm) and with only about 7 other tables occupied the volume was edging toward being too loud. The final drawback is the paucity of available restrooms.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot that can be done about that. The drawbacks aren't enough though to drastically impact my review.  They're really more of a collection of nuisances that if expected and planned for, don't affect your experience significantly. All-in-all, Cafe Iberico is an enjoyable, inexpensive place to dine, and a great place to take your out of town guests if you want to have some fun, some great food, and a memorable experience.",0.9979,0.833,0.143,0.024,0.5546274961597542

The tapas, overall, is quite good.  I usually hit the specials menu but also have a list of standbys: tortilla, sausages, croquettas, chicken skewers, marinated vegetables and beef tenderloin.  Plates are small, of course, and I'd recommend 2-3 per person for a hearty meal. Like others mentioned, that place gets packed fast.  They remodeled relatively recently and made the entry area slightly more manageable, but you still may be waiting outside for well over an hour if you're there during prime times.   I think partly for that reason, I fear I will eventually grow out of Iberico.  3 years ago it would have been a solid 5 star joint.  But, it can be a bit hectic and dealing with the crowds while there are so many other delicious places to choose from isn't as worth it as it used to be.  But for now, I will still stop by regularly for their wonderful sangria, happy patrons, and reasonably-priced small plates.",0.9881,0.792,0.158,0.051,0.49349493643611286

The service was definitely another positive.  Our dishes were out quickly and our drinks always full.   I will definitely be going back, and have already recommended it to a few people.  I could do without the Spanish techno they had playing in the background, but after some sangria, you hardly notice it.",0.9854,0.749,0.204,0.047,0.48262845849802366

If you like garlic you MUST try the garlic potato salad.  It screams fresh garlic and you will need mints for the next two days but it's worth it!  Just make sure everyone eats it so that you all stink. I really like the chilled grilled veggie plate and of course the mixed olives.  The manchego cheese plate is awesome too.

The Drinks: You definitely need to order sangria by the pitcher, as it's some of the best I've had.  Personally, I prefer the white wine version, but the red wine sangria is also amazing.

Unfortunately, some of my favorites have left, but I think Julio is still there! He is the best. He's got glasses and is always smiling. Anyway, besides the service... The Sangria - Is awesome. I recommend going on a weeknight when it is not too busy. I like red better than white because red tastes more like wine. The white is good for anyone who likes really sweet sangria. A pitcher is really cheap (about $12 or so and is enough for 2 or 3 people). If you're getting just one glass, I recommend getting the half pitcher. This will get you a lot more for a buck extra. The beer - I like beer, like most other people. They have the basics with some added labels. I really like Estrella. It's a Spanish beer that has a sort of spiced taste. It is similar to Quilmes from Argentina if you've ever had it. Other beer I've tried there: DAMN BARCELONA. The best part of this beer is the name. I didn't like it all that much... The food - is wickedly amazingly good. Tapas is basically small plates of food you can share. At Cafe Iberico (or CI as my friends and I call it) they are more like entrees. I always get the Salmon a la Pimienta. It's always so good and filling. I like it better than the other salmon dish... which I forget the name. The garlic potato salad is good, but pretty garlicky, so I'd get a mint if I were you. The chicken skewers with caramelized onions are yummy. The shrimp dishes are very tasty but not as filling. I haven't really had anything I didn't like there.  The desserts - Unfortunately, I am usually too full or too tipsy to try the desserts here but I wouldn't be surprised if they were good.  The bad??? The only thing I can think of is that it does get pretty loud in there... but it's a bar!

We made a mistake when placing an order and wanted to switch one of the tapas for another 5 minutes after ordering. We told the waitress and she said the food already on the grill (fast!)

While we stood there drinking our sangria we got to watch some weird TV show that was on without sound so we spent our wait time creating a story line and people watching. You have to watch the TV because they scroll who's up to be seated at the bottom of the screen - very high tech! This is definitely the best way to spend your wait time!  The selection of tapas was more extensive than any other tapas restaurant that I've been to. Between 4 of us we had 2 pitchers of delicious sangria and probably 6 tasty, savory selections of small plates ranging from octopus to beef tenderloin!

My two girlfriends and I who had traveled to the area together fell in love with the restaurant and it's tight quarters, crowded dining areas and delicious sangria. We likened it to our little slice of New York, Sex in the City style. The menu is vast and has something for everyone, whether you don't eat red meat or are a vegetarian. The desserts also are quite divine and the selection is paramount.  The four or five times I've been here, the service was consistently good and the food was consistently cooked perfectly and seasoned just the same. That is, with the exception of my last trip ...  The crowd was particularly large and the wait was longer than normal. The dining area was overly crowded and even though I'm used to the waiters doing topsy turvy dances across the dining room with trays of food, it was so packed it was unsettling. The fish was overcooked, the chicken was overcooked, and the only pleasant part of the meal was the dessert. All of the meat and veggie dishes were overcooked and dry as a bone ... talk about disappointing. The freshness just wasn't there, unfortunately. This isn't enough to keep me from going back, though. I'm willing to give it another shot before saying ""Adios!"" The selections are amazing and there's always something new to be had on the expanding menu.

The place is PACKED - and getting from the outside to your table will take several gropings and about 10 minutes, no joke, unless you're from NY and you don't mind shoving and getting shoved back.  It's most definitely a popular hangout, and the drinks flow freely here.  The bar portion is just packed, and the seating seems to always be full.  There WILL be a wait, with or without a reservation, I'd guess.... if going on a weekend evening.  (I was there on a Friday night.)

Some plates were in danger of falling off, but the pitchers of sangria were safe and secure and within reach, so no one was too worried. The lights were down low, the music was pumping high to an Andalusian pitch, you had to scream to be heard, and it's hard to tell what was loudest -- the soundtrack, your vocals, your stomach growling, or your gut digesting. In fact, when I went to Spain for the very first time last fall and found myself elbow to elbow with locals on many a stop on plenty of tapas tours, I thought to myself -- Cafe Iberico got it right. Last night when we went, I had to wonder if we were at the same place (a couple of circles around the block in a plaintive attempt to find street parking that ultimately ended up in the hands of the valet was our first clue that we didn't, indeed, pull up to a wrong spot). I almost had to wear my sunglasses when we stepped in -- bright! Open! Airy! Muted music! Plenty of room to maneuvre! Are we not in Spain anymore?! Idealistically speaking, the remodelling was a good thing. Room to move and toast and order more tapas, no need to see the shrink for claustrophobia next week. And the sangria as cold and just-nice sweet as I remember, the large variety of tapas as tasty as I fantasise (and mi dios, still the same good prices like the pre-Euro days). If you truly yearn for a more Spanish atmosphere, then revel in the the Latin time the waiters abide by in their service.

The baked goat cheese was delicious, as were the grilled mixed vegetables, the mushrooms, and some kind of eggplant bruschetta thingy. Garlic shrimp were a little too garlicky for my taste and I wasn't fond of the tails (and feet?) still being on, but that's just me. Everyone else seemed to love them. We also liked the spicy potatoes and the potatoes with sausage. The pork chop was a bit disappointing - rather tough - but the accompanying fries were good. We also had a salad but it must have been forgettable because I can't remember much about it except that it had too much mayonnaise in the dressing. One of the best things was the wine - decent wines by the glass at very reasonable prices. Just the thing to wash down the wonderful tapas!",0.9902,0.74,0.204,0.056,0.6027555555555556

The best dish I have to say is the grilled octopus. The queso de cabra (goat cheese), patatas bravas (spicy potatoes), mussels were pretty standard. I did NOT like the croquettas - despite what others have recommended - it tasted like deep fried ham and cheese sticks that had just been microwaved.  Also, the paella was just not good.  It was too yellow (too much saffron), and didn't have as much taste as other paellas, which makes me think they didn't cook/bake it long enough.  Also, the meat/seafood was minimal in the paella, a big no-no when the rice is already too yellow.

Here is a very biased comparison of the three: Iberico vs. Emilio's (on Fullerton/Clark in LP): - Emilio's seems to have the most ""interesting"" (could be because it's more authentic?) dishes - Atmosphere at Emilio's is more intimate, fancier, and less noisy/crowded feeling - Parking is possible in front of the Emilio's in LP Iberico vs. Reeba: - Reeba's prices are way high for such small portions - Atmospheres at both are similar: lively (noisy), not overly dim, have sections that seat large parties - Waiters/waitresses are much friendlier, more patient, and more willing to help pick out dishes at Iberico - Street parking difficult in both areas I've liked everything I've eaten at Iberico.  I'll spare you the bad Spanish spellings, so I'll describe them in English: toasted bread with smoked salmon, capers, and dill cream; cold seafood salad (almost like ceviche); spicy cubed potatoes; grilled octopus with French fries; steamed mussels in tomato broth; roasted chicken with Spanish mashed potatoes & asparagus; seafood & pork paella (Order first!  It takes the longest to make.); ice cream filled crepe with strawberry sauce; and the red sangria!  ALL SO VERY GOOD & CHEAP!",0.9735,0.859,0.111,0.029,0.5122431077694235

When I previewed Iberico's menu, I did not foresee any vegetarian-lifestyle-killers. There were plenty of salads and seemingly vegetarian items. Until the following scene unfolded -  Me to waitress: ""This white bean soup. What is in it?"" Waitress to me: ""Beans."" Me to waitress: ""Okay, but what is its base? Does it have ham or cream or beef or anything like that?"" Waitress to me: ""No, it's beans."" Me to waitress: ""Okay... beans?"" Waitress to me: ""Yes."" Me to waitress: ""Okay, well then I will have the white bean soup."" *Awkward conversation with dinner companion until plates arrive. Strangely the waitress brought both of my plates about 15 minutes before she brought the other person's. Finally all of our orders arrive.* I take spoonful of soup. I spit spoonful of soup into my napkin. I flag down waitress -  Me to waitress: ""So, you're telling me this just has beans in it? No ham, nothing like that?"" Waitress to me: ""No, just beans. No ham. Beans... and it has sausage."" Me to waitress: ""Okay... so you realize that I have not eaten meat for 15 years. Because you told me that the soup only contained beans, I just ate one of the most repugnant varieties of meat possible, right?"" Waitress to me: ""So you don't want the soup?"" At that point I imagine I turned a lovely shade of green, and shot the waitress a look that is usually reserved for cat-calls on the red line. I thought that things had hit as low as possible. Until my fellow diner (who will not again be dining with me) pulled out this gem -  Fellow diner to me: ""You won't die. I promise."" And he was right. I did, in fact, live through the night. I certainly hope both he and my lovely waitress enjoyed the rest of the evening. I spent the rest of it retching. Psychosomatic. I know. But this reveals something that could have been a lot more dramatic. If a diner allergic to nuts asked if a dish had peanuts in it, and the waitress said no, and the diner asked if it had cashews, and the waitress said no, and the diner ended up in anaphylactic shock because the dish, instead, contained walnuts, Iberico would have a far bigger problem on their hands than a disgruntled vegetarian.

You can get completely stuffed on Spanish tapas and soused on sangria for about $20. The good thing about tapas, and the reason for the cuisine's popularity, is the ability to try several different dishes. One of the original restaurants of this type, Cafe Iberico's been serving tapas since before tapas was cool. Their dishes range from the expected Marinated Spanish Olives (aceitunas alinadas) to the very-American-seeming Chicken and Ham Puffs. Yes, these are deep-fried rolls of chicken and ham served with a white cream sauce. Since I'm from Indiana I naturally love 'em. They also serve grilled octopus, which does not taste like chicken and is actually one of my favorites. I also love love love the Queso de Cabra (baked goat cheese in a tomato basil sauce), the grilled mushrooms, the smoked salmon, and the spicy potatoes. The grilled shrimp always sounds really good, but the couple of times I've had it it's been overcooked. There are so many items to choose from it doesn't really bother me, so instead I'll get the chicken brochette with carmelized onions and rice. There are standard menu items, but they also feature weekly specials to mix it up a bit. For those who don't like to share their food, Cafe Iberico has several salads and entrees to choose from, including Paella. Desserts feature flan, of course, and last time I went there with a birthday group they served the Platano Al Caramelo - sauteed banana with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. WOW! Cafe Iberico is not the place to go for a romantic date. For one reason, they don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday at all, and the rest of the week only for parties of 6 or more. Another reason is it's a casual atmosphere and it can get pretty loud. That being said, it's a great restuarant for a get-together with friends over a pitcher of really good sangria. I think that's why I like the place so much. The surroundings are comfortable and amiable and I'm sharing good food and drinks with good friends. If I don't like something they've picked there are several other dishes in front of me to choose from.

2006-08-18,3.0,"Well, folks let's look back 5 years ago to an age when amazing restaurants were undiscovered by the usurping throngs of the ""social elite"" -- in those days Cafe Iberico was the only place to go for the tenuous combo of bourbon, Tapas and sangria.  In those days, the atmosphere was quaint, the food was top-notch, and the people were chill. But those days are long gone. Now if you want to get some Tapas on a weekend night, you're most likely going to scrape the bottom of the barrel to find anything at all.  Cafe Iberico has expanded beyond its own capacity at this point in time. They have seating that is for a lack of any better description ""jammed tighter than dark matter inside a quark."" Nowadays, the throngs that meet you with their din of drunken shrieking and elitist nose turns are nigh impossible to handle.  The food over the past 5 years has taken a sharp decline as well. For instance over last winter ('05-'06) I took a date there to drink bourbon and talk about whatever rolled off my riled mind. We sat down and took off our coats and were met with sub-arctic temperatures. I mean a polar bear would have had difficulty surviving in that joint. For some reason they were running the air conditioning on a Thursday night, in the dead of Chicago's winter. When our food arrived the dishes that were supposed to be piping hot were cold and the dishes that were supposed to be cold were sporting a fine layer of miniscule ice crystals (okay the ice crystals may be a bit eccentric). When I asked the wait staff and hostess to please turn down the AC, I was met with... ""I'll check with the manager."" and a look like, ""Good luck chump.""  Anyway, the moral of the story is that this used to be a GREAT place to go and have amazing tapas... but no longer is it worthwhile... unless you go on Tuesday night toward the end of Spring. I was going to give them 5 stars but then I remembered how badly they have dropped the ball... but instead of giving them the 2 stars they now deserve... they pour some pretty fine bourbons so, I'll fudge a little and give them 3 stars.

Service was decent, we were greeted shortly after being seated and checked on every fifteen minutes or so. Food arrived fairly quickly.  I figure on a busy night, they probably make a few in advance and just send them out upon being ordered.  My fave tapas would have to be the scallops with saffron rice and the goat cheese.  The goat cheese isn't anything out of this world, but for some reason, I have to order it every time I go.  I think the only thing that could improve the menu would be if they offered flavored sangrias =) The restaurant itself is humongous, therefore it's fairly loud.  Also, the main room has a tv on at all times, along with latin music blaring through the sound system.  This is definitely not the place to go for a quiet evening, but the place to be if you're looking for a lively environment.",0.9818,0.878,0.122,0.0,0.4918732782369146

2006-05-13,4.0,"The idea of Tapas is a great one...go out to a bar with some friends, share a few drinks, and everyone has a few small plates of food, not enough to be filling in and of themselves, but together a delicious display to delight the palate. Cafe Iberico definetly has the corazon of any of its contemporaries in Spain. From the exterior, Iberico seems like just another sidewalk cafeteria, and has little more than a small neon sign in the window to recommend it. This is probably because all the recommendations are coming from those eat here The interior is a small bar and 2 large dining rooms, one upstairs, and one belowstairs. The upstairs one is nicely decorated enough that you could eat here for a night out on the town, but if you only wore blue jeans and a t-shirt, you would fit in perfectly as well. While the decorations may come off a little on the tacky side, Iberico more than makes up for it with everything else... They have the cheapest sangria in the city...at $13 bucks a pitcher, It would be a crime to not try the sangria roja, which is fruity enough that non-wine drinkers can still enjoy it, but strong enough that a couple pitchers may still have you and your friends dancing on the tables singing ""La Bamba"" Iberico has probably the best variety of hot and cold tapas in the city, although Ba ba reeba, Sangria, and others may occasionally beat them in price. My group and I ended up sampling the stuffed eggplant rolls with goat cheese, the spicy potatoes, the croquettes, bizcochos, and garlic shrimp. Not one dish disappointed. The portions are small, so by yourself you may need 2 or 3 plates, but at about 5-8 dollars per item, even a hungry man won't break the bank The presentation is excellent with each plate artfully arranged and nary an unused space to be seen, even when the dish is larger than the meal on it. The eggplant was soft and cooked to perfection, the goat cheese inside warm and just beginning to melt. The croquettes were crispy and contrasted nicely with the tang and coolness of the mayonaisse, and the garlic shrimp had a flavor that belied their size. The wait staff was helpful and friendly, and brought our late guests full glasses of sangria at no charge, even though the pitcher was empty when they arrived. The waitress also made a number of excellent sugesstions for what to order, based off of what she eats in her down time, always a good sign for me. We arrived about a quarter to 5 to grab a bite to eat before seeing spamalot, and the restaurant was empty. By the time we left at 6:30, Iberico was packed, and there was a line out the door, so be sure to make reservations if you are going to be eating later in the evening. On the whole, Sangria is still my favorite Tapas Bar, but Iberico wins for best all around...pricing, selection, location and wait staff are all just a bit better. Iberico also offers valet parking, but check for street meters about one block west of La Salle! Price Range: $5-10 per tapa Good For: groups, birthdays, night's on the town (for dates go to Sangria) Recommended: Eggplant stuffed with goat cheese if available, any dish with goat cheese if not",0.9987,0.784,0.185,0.031,0.5285789158430668

2005-08-14,5.0,"I like it here alot.  the white sangria is better than the red and tons of fruit in it.  the tapas... try the roasted cold veggies, garlic chicken skewers and the chocolate mousse (comes with a big fat strawberry on top). nice place for b-days....you & your friends are never rushed out.   and btw...I know someone that used to work there and she loves it as well, so if you have ever worked in the food biz, you know thats quite a compliment!",0.9627,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.5062500000000001

2005-08-12,4.0,"Second favorite Tapas place other than Cafe BaBaReeba. I thought everything tasted awesome! The different sangria was very tasty too..they have white, peach, ect. The Cafe fills up very fast so make sure you grab a table fast! The atmosphere is very ""Spanish!""",0.8899,0.783,0.217,0.0,0.503989898989899
2005-08-02,4.0,"My favorite Spanish restaurant in the city. Not the best, but nothing compares to the food in Spain. Its  a great ambience. Great place to go with friends,share some food and enjoy some drinks. Their sangria is mediocre, but then again, so is all Spanish restaurants' in the city. Too water downed. My recommendations for this restaurant are the jamon iberico, the croquetas de pollo and the solomillo skewer. The paella is okay but better than most places. Try the Estrella! Great beer!",0.9879,0.694,0.306,0.0,0.5458333333333333
2005-07-24,5.0,"Cafe Iberico is still my favorite tapas place in the city. The place always fills up, so try to get there before 5pm for immediate service (then again, who eats dinner so early in Spain?). Tapas are basically bar snacks in Spain, but glammed up a bit on this side of the Atlantic. Order a bunch of these smallish dishes and share with your friends. Tasty selections include the mushrooms, the beef on a skewer with fries and heavenly caramelized onions, and the shrimp. The sangria and paella are good, and they always have some interesting specials. Definitely save room for dessert. They are all delicious and reasonably priced for a downtown restaurant. If you do have to wait for a table, enjoy the TV programming from Spain, or stare at the decor ranging from wine bottles in the ceiling rack to colorful tiles on the walls.",0.9912,0.772,0.228,0.0,0.6000000000000001
2005-07-11,5.0,It looks small from the outside but this place is actually huge!  Its really good tapas for cheap.. I went with a party of 16 once and our bill was $120 with drinks!  You can't complain about that!,0.9364,0.691,0.309,0.0,0.53
