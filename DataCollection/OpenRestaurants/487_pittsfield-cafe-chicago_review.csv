2016-06-28,2.0,"Great, friendly service. But, its the type of place where the pancake syrup comes in single serving packets, which is fine for some restaurants, but the prices would have to justify that. I wouldn't expect real maple syrup from a Deluxe Breakfast Platter from McD's, for example.  But it's not just about the syrup. Overall, seems overpriced for what you get. Sausage links (breakfast) tasted generic. As did everything else really. Just generic. So prices should've been generic too, but they weren't.

I would expect more garnishment and pico de gallo or salsa or avocado or something to dress the omelet and make it look better and compliment the flavors. The hash browns were good and corned beef was homemade but really tasted average. My biggest complaint is the service. It took three request to get coffee. We finally got it after our meal was over.

The food was alright, nothing special besides the prices given that the cafe is in downtown Chicago. I ordered a cinnamon banana french toast and the edges tasted like a fried egg. Maybe french toast is difficult to cook....I don't know. What I do know is that I got an upset stomach afterwards. **SERVICE: We came down here because Wildberry had an hour and a half wait and we were on a time crunch. The waitress never came to check up on us until she began telling us multiple times to pay and leave even though the place was probably half full and it didn't close for another hour (this was ridiculous). When we were ready to pay the waitress informed us that she could split the checks but she didn't want too because it was too hard and it was busy so it all went on my card. I've been a cashier at multiple places before and I know it is really not hard or time consuming to do this but I let it go. She stood there and interrupted us multiple times as we tried talking about how to pay so that it would only be one transaction.  She brought me the slip to sign and, already unhappy with the service, I gave her a 10% tip.  She took it and then came back and literally DEMANDED (in an incredibly condescending manner) that I give her more because  ""in case you didn't know, this place is a /restaurant/! This isn't McDonalds, you need to tip me at least 15-20%!"" Her voice was insulting and loud enough for everyone in area to hear. I have never been treated like this and, in shock, I tipped her 20% and left. As I left, a customer was arguing with her about being charged prices higher than what was on the menu and for things he didn't pay for.  TL;DR I don't eat at fast food chains but i'd rather go to mcdonalds than visit this place again.

This place is in an interesting location, but something is wrong in general.  1) tables in the patio are cold now in December, just imagine in Jan/Feb 2) more important, all the 4 eggs of our benedicts were way too overcooked (hard): no good!! 3) hollandaise felt little too greasy 4) breakfast syrup for the pancakes is served cold  5) pancakes are nothing special at all 6) French toast is too chewy 7) scrambled eggs for my baby were overcooked and resembled an omelette instead  So, I can't understand the average of 4 full stars.  I would have given it a 3 if it weren't for the overcooked eggs.  Prices are good.",0.4916,0.833,0.093,0.074,0.5979497354497355

Actually they have tables set out in the foyer of the hotel, which we opted to sit at. So we only got a quick glance at the inside of the cafe.  The food was really delicious. I got one corned beef skillet with scrambled eggs and another with eggs over-easy. I would recommend sticking with scrambled eggs - the yolk from the over-easy eggs kind of overpowered the taste of the corned beef. Didn't get any drinks, we were trying to recover from the night before. It wasn't too crowded so our food was served really fast and our waitress was really attentive.  The prices here are unbelievable, especially for being located in the Loop.  Overall: great brunch spot. Nice environment and good experience.

The setting is sort of semi-hidden, inside the lobby area of the Pittsfield Building, and the place is set up diner-style with tables and a long lunch counter. So far, so good. Service is generally pretty quick, and most of the things I had were fine. Fine, but certainly not memorable in any way. Whenever I get unburnt coffee in a diner setting, that's a plus, so that was good. Freshly squeezed OJ was indeed freshly squeezed, also good. But the rest? Meh. Toast was nearly cold. Had to ask for butter, cream for my coffee, etc. The service was actually rushed - too much so, given that the place was busy but not even full. Servers are almost brusque as a result, one of the non-diner-like aspects. I had the corned beef hash, which honestly, wasn't. I love the stuff but am pretty forgiving of variations, just come close. But this was shredded corned beef, sort of tossed with onion and green pepper pieces and about 0.1 oz of potatoes. Nothing tasted like it had been cooked together; it was more like a salad. And the great flavor melding you get from the ""hash"" just can't be there.

2015-08-29,1.0,"So came here mainly because Wildberry down the street had an hour and a half wait and it was raining so we would have gotten soaked. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Got here and we had a very hard time finding the place we called for directions (is inside the building where chase bank is). We asked if they had a wait. Lady on the phone said no wait. We get in and there was a wait of about 15mins, not bad, but how do u lie to ur potential customers?! FYI-We only walked across the street.  Anyhow, we were wet and hungry so we stayed. Atmosphere is tragic. Sad, dim looking place with tables in lobby of building. We sat outside and waited, finally the buzzer brought us water. We waited for another 15mins or so and the waitress kept walking by complaining about how busy it was. Um, don't u want business? We ordered a cup of coffee and a soda cuz the water tastes like chlorine tap water. They brought my coffee, I noticed the creamer that needs refrigeration was warm from sitting on the table too long, so I asked the buzzer for some cold creamer since our waitress was no where in sight. He didn't seem happy and without answering grabbed my bowl of creamers and I see him put my bowl of warm creamers back in the fridge and get a new one out...  that's going to make someone sick. He returns and we say thank you he just throws the bowl on the table and walks off.  Another 10 mins or so go by and they bring my order but not my wife's. The waitress tells us that she doesn't have her order because ""someone, decided to steal your steak"", (she had order the steak burrito). It arrived after another 10-15 mins. At this point they still had not brought her soda out. We reminded the waitress and it took her an additional 5 mins to get it.  The food... Bad. Just bad. Whoever said the corned beef was the best they had ever had, man... Long stretch buddy, another review stated it was like lunch meat with potatoes and sadly I have to agree, tasted like a fatty chewy hotdog... my wife's burrito tasted like they had fried beef jerky in some rancid oil. My wife liked the waffle that's why the one star. In my opinion it was like eating crispy cardboard. Absolutely no flavor.

2015-08-11,5.0,"Firstly, the cafe is located in the historic Pittsfield Building, an immaculately preserved art deco building emblazened with the glitz and glamour of the 1920's. Step into the cafe and you're transported to the American diners of the 50s and 60s, a la Route 66. In fact, you couldn't get more Americana unless a Bald Eagle landed in your eggs and pooped the stars and stripes. But I digress.. The joint is family run, with 2 generations at the door. 'Pops' will greet you with a smile, then send his son over for the dirty business of seating you. The menu is extensive, with All Day Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner options. The decor matches the menu - think American staples like meatloaf, hot dogs and burgs, steak and eggs and silver dollar pancakes. Nothin' fancy, just classic good eats. Each visit (spoiler alert: we came back 3 times in as many days), I opted for The Sampler - one of the all-day breakfast items that includes 2 pieces of French Toast, 2 scrambled eggs, hash potatoes and 2 strips of bacon. For less than $10, you get a serious cup of Italian coffee paired with a more-than-adequate plate of food. The boys behind the counter work some kind of magic, because in mere minutes they whipped up the best french toast I've ever had. Simple, eggy (but not soggy), paired with hot and fluffy scrambled eggs, and perfectly cooked (RE: crispy but not TOO crispy) bacon, piled on top of creamy (but not too greasy), hash. Erm, that was the long way of saying everything was perfect. Seriously.  Top that with exceptional service, no wait times (the cafe is hidden from the tourist crowds), and less than $10 for a filling and tasty meal, it's safe to say we hit the vacation jackpot. Cheap, cheerful, and by far some of the best food we ate on our trip. That said, this isn't the place for Hipsters or the food elite.

Inside is a courtyard. It's almost like dining on a square, like eating at an indoor ""patio.""  We were here on a Saturday ""morning"" (noon on Saturday is mid-morning, in my book), and the square was quite peaceful. We hung out until they were closing, but there was no rush to get us out of there as they started to clean the tables; on the contrary, they told us to stay as long as we liked.  Like others here have said, the corned beef hash is excellent, the menu is filled with standard breakfast fare at reasonable prices. The coffee is not Intelligentsia, but still well quaffable, with no hipster trying to convince you that you need a little pot with an s-shaped spout to ""pour over"" coffee grounds that are measured to the gram. The service is friendly and efficient. The Toni Patisserie is through a hallway if you want to spend the same amount on a macaroon and cappuccino as you just did for a full breakfast here.

She looked at me like I was stupid when I was surprised that they have a $7 order of corned beef hash that comes with nothing but the corned beef hash. I've seriously never heard or just eating a heaping plate of corned beef hash by its self. I have always ordered it as part of a traditional diner breakfast, eggs, hash and toast... I decided on broccoli and cheddar omelet and I asked for one pancake on the side. She said she's couldn't get me one pancake but that a short stack of four pancakes was $4.99. Then when she brought them there was only two cakes. I asked her to clarify and again with the dumb look. $4.99 for 2 pancakes seems a little overpriced, besides the misinformation. Either way, the food was alright(pretty average diner breakfast) but the server was impersonal and rude and only came back to drop off the check. I probably won't eat here again based on service and price but the atmosphere and look is cool for sure, very prohibition era-esq. Be sure to check out the bathroom, lol.

This establishment is located inside a building downtown that looks a bit abandoned inside. The ""cafe"" has seating outside of the store doors and counter and booth seating inside. This place is a dump.  The menu is typical greek/american restaurant style with meat and potatoes and no fruits or veggies. The prices are low for Chicago.  I ordered the pancakes. I asked to add fresh strawberries. Three berries came with the pancakes, and one was pathetically past its prime.  The pancakes were clearly from a powered mix. I was given a little cup of butter. It was dirty, crumbs all over. I told the server and she made an excuse that the kitchen has tight quarters and they have it next to the toaster.  My companion ordered the sampler which was 2 eggs, sausage, and french toast. Worse french toast I have never had. It tasted, I kid you not, like an old leather shoe. One of his eggs was raw - I don't mean the yolk - I mean the white of the egg was still really raw. Not borderline. He said the sausage patties were definitely frozen.  Our server never returned to ask about our food. We couldn't track her down. We asked the busser to locate her. He did not. We never got the check. We went to the cash register to say we wanted to leave, then they wanted our money and found the check. I complained about the horribleness of the food, and they knocked off $4. The total price then was around $18. Not even CLOSE to worth it. The cashier didn't apologize, but instead said that the kitchen got slammed. Well then don't put out so many freakin' tables. No sorry. At this point, two servers are sitting at a booth both on their smart phones. The owner should be absolutely ashamed.  There are a hundred better places in Chicago.

Nothing Let's move on to the good:  1. Good coffee (I know I'm not the only one who thinks good coffee is hard to come by) 2. Great staff - Grrrrrrreat (cue Tony the Tiger).  3. Fresh squeezed orange juice - out of this world excited about this! 4. The building... ...let's talk about the building.  This is located in an old timey building that houses businesses, a barber shop and such. I chose to sit in the lobby to enjoy my lunch and wow - what a cool atmosphere. Imagine sitting and enjoying a cup 'o joe in the middle of a vintage building smack dab in the middle of the city. Well, imagine no more my friends, Pittsfield is IT.  A few things to note:  -- If you're in a rush to eat, this is THE place for you. The food service takes 5 mins. at most. WOW! How many full service joints in the city can claim such fast service? Not many.  -- CASH ONLY! But, not to worry, Yelpers. There is a Chase bank on the corner with an ATM.  What I ordered/ate:  -- South of the Border omlette -- Rasin Toast -- Fruit cup -- Coffee -- OJ Honestly, good service gets me every time. So when I walked up to the entrance of this diner and an older man kindly greeted me and sat me down telling me, ""Wherever you like!"" in a happy tone, I fell in love.

Secondly, when I went to pay they charged me $1.20 more than the breakfast special which was two pancakes, two eggs, and two pieces of bacon. When I asked why I wasn't getting the breakfast special price they said that since I hadn't gotten the bacon they had to ring up the items a la carte. This  makes zero sense.
