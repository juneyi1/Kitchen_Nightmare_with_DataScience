The checkout process was extremely easy and quick AND my food was ready! I ordered the calamari combo, which was a small order of the fried and grilled calamari, the meatballs and the toasted ravioli. The grilled calamari was UH-mazing! I ordered it on a whim, but I highly recommend it! It came with bruschetta mixed in. Man...YUM! The fried calamari was just okay though. It was a bit short on flavor and taste. The meatballs were okay as well. Nothing stood out about their seasoning. The toasted ravioli's were also very good.

Although we were clearly in the process of trying to make an exit, Mario came over and literally scolded us for bringing our kids.  When he looked down and saw that my 10-month old daughter had dropped food on the floor (heaven forbid!), his exact words were ""We can't have this.  This isn't Chuckie Cheese.  I have to have my staff clean this up now"".   My husband told him not to worry, we most certainly would not be coming back.  Nor will any of our friends or families at my son's nearby preschool (Oh yes, Mario, I will be sure to spread the word!) Out of all of our dining experiences at other restaurants in the neighborhood (Pump Room, Carmine's, Tavern on Rush, Gibson's, LuxBar), never before has anyone ever gone out of their way to try and humiliate us the way that Mario did last night, within earshot of the entire restaurant and staff.  Truly unprofessional.",0.9819,0.828,0.132,0.041,0.3868085618085618

The veal saltimbocca was pretty par for the course. The servers were a bit abrupt with us but I think that was on account of the fact that they were about to close up.

Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner here and definitely satisfied our craving for yummy Italian.  As others have noted, Mario actually walks the room and engages in conversation with each of his guests to make sure they are satisfied with their experience.  This is a nice personal touch that you just don't get anymore these days.",0.9918,0.834,0.143,0.022,0.4327940577940578

2010-02-24,5.0,Mario himself is a great guy. I just always like going in there...being recognized and always a happy hello. I guess I just like the neighborhood feel. Parking down the block is always a plus for me. The food is good. The drinks are good. Great Service- I have never had any complaint and would recommend this place highly.,0.9726,0.583,0.376,0.04,0.5911111111111111
2009-10-04,3.0,"I've run past this place a million times (well, maybe not literally) on my way to the lake front path and never eaten at Mario's until last night.  Our food was quite good but I must say that the ambiance was not fitting of an Italian place.   I am willing to chalk it up to the large party that sat next to our corner table half-way through our meal, but the restaurant was really loud.   I know I sound like an old fart for saying this, but seriously, I couldn't hear much of anything my admittedly soft-spoken wife was saying. I will probably go back to Mario's, but I will almost certainly request a table that is not in the corner.",0.8593,0.887,0.096,0.017,0.3622222222222222
2009-04-14,1.0,"We had a dinner reservation for 3 adults and a 10- month old.  We were seated next to another baby-15 months old, which again would indicate that children are welcome. It was not until my child started talking-not crying, but talking, that the owner felt he needed to come over with the bartender as backup and essentially tell me to shut my child up. As he put it he had a lot of ""nice diners"" coming in on a Saturday evening. I could not believe what I was hearing! My son was not crying he was not throwing food or playing with silverware-he was speaking; how I am supposed to reprimand him for that? Truthfully I thought it was a joke. My husband and I work closely with the CVB as well as local concierges and I can assure you I will be sharing my experience. If they don't want families in there on a Saturday night, that is their prerogative. They shouldn't accept the reservation. Please do not ask me to discipline my child for doing nothing wrong.",0.9651,0.787,0.159,0.054,0.4727272727272727
2009-03-23,2.0,"Less than average tasting, over priced, Italian food.  I wish it were better. I really do. Very nice neighborhood feel. Friendly and accommodating. Good service. Attentive owner. The place is often busy. (? It must be me ?) This time I ordered pasta with seafood. Pasta was wet ( not drained ) and over cooked and tasteless. Seafood quality (mussels,clams,shrimp)was average. Red sauce flavor was less than average, likey due to the abundance of water from the noodles. An Italian restaurant should have much better pasta. Previous visits resulted in a meal with too much garlic and meat meal that was dry and over cooked.  I'm sorry to say that after this 3rd and final visit, due to the prices/value/quality, I won't be back.",0.9591,0.834,0.156,0.01,0.4096153846153847
2009-02-23,4.0,"This cute little neighborhood italian restaurant is a great spot for gold coasters who want some good food in a cozy environment for a fair price.  I enjoy my experience whenever I go here, which has been about 6-7 times all without any problems.  While I have never had any complaints, I have never been blown away either.  Although it was nice to have the real Mario come by the table and ask us how we were enjoying dinner.  It's that little touch gives this place that friendly chicago feel and makes me keep going back.  Plenty of places can provide simiar food (standard italian dishes) but Mario's does it with that extra friendly attitude that customers appreciate.  It's a bit pricey depending on what you like, but that is true of most places in the area. This place is a solid 3.5 overall, so I will give it a 4 since Mario was nice enough to introduce himself and inquire about our meal.  Customer care goes a long way with me",0.9903,0.756,0.244,0.0,0.466
2009-02-17,4.0,"I like Mario's.  It's basically a neighborhood restaurant that happens to serve the Gold Coast neighborhood.  As such it's a little nicer than your average neighborhood Italian joint might be, but the spirit is pretty much the same.  Consistent food, friendly, personable service, reasonable (for the area) prices. I like the Chicken Limon best, although when soft shell crab is in season (which I love), they do that very well. I used to live on Dearborn, and I still make it over to Mario's now and then.  I think anyone who lives near it in the Gold Coast probably has some memory there.  I ate there with my friends the day the U.S. launched attacks on Afghanistan.  It was such a communal experience, with the not-yet-hated President Bush announcing the invasion on the televisions to total silence in otherwise packed room.  The Gold Coast is one of the more Republican neighborhoods in Chicago, but politics didn't matter for that night - just community, and Mario's was (and is) a great place for community.",0.9872,0.775,0.199,0.026,0.475
2008-12-18,3.0,"I went to Mario's for dinner - it was really just ok.  It was right by my hotel, which was very convenient, but there wasn't anything that really stuck out for me.  The bread was ok, the bowtie pasta was good, but not outstanding, and the service was fine.  We were sitting next to a tv fire - yes you read that right, there was a tv that was showing a fireplace - it was a little odd, but I appreciate the attempt to feel homey.  Overall, not a bad dining experience, but there are so many great restaurants in the city, I don't know that I would deliberately choose to go back to Mario's.",0.94,0.692,0.21,0.098,0.41183862433862434
2008-05-11,2.0,"At most restaurants, you get a salad before your meal.  Not so at Mario's. The atmosphere is fairly cozy with lots of dark browns.  A plasma TV rotates pictures of fine art. But the food was weak.  I got some beef-stuffed ravioli (the ""special"") and it just tasted bland.  Seriously, I've had better Chef Boyardee.  The sauce had no flavor.  Mushrooms were just dumped on top, not mixed with the sauce at all.  And the portion was small, compared to what you'd get at most other Italian joints. The only reason they can charge those prices is the location, but you'll get more flavor and a better value courtesy of your can opener.  Skip it.",0.8481,0.823,0.122,0.055,0.5206349206349207
2008-05-02,3.0,I lived above Mario's for about 4 years and was just never really that impressed by the food. It is a great spot to grab a drink at the bar (a bar in your building- no matter how crappy-  with Chicago's winters is probably one of the biggest luxuries of all time). The servers are friendly and Mario is in there all the time watching over things.  They heart of palm salad and roasted mushrooms aren't bad.,0.3999,0.769,0.131,0.1,0.5361111111111111
2008-02-25,4.0,"I'm with Deepa J. on the great location since this place is super close to where my boyfriend lives. Even though it always seems busy, we were able to get a seat during prime time without any wait. The boyfriend wanted a hearty meal so he ordered the chicken parmesan, which came out well-cooked and flavorful. My baked cavatelli tasted homemade (literally! we make this all the time, so I was a little let down that it tasted so similar) but the sausages on top were delicious and something I definitely don't have at home. We dug into the bread at the beginning (hot, toasty on the outside and fluffy on the inside) so we did have quite a lot of leftovers for lunch the next day. They do make a good tiramisu and it comes as a generous square-shaped portion. However, I wouldn't recommend the coffee. We probably should have gone across the street to 3rd Coast for that instead. Anyway, I thought it was nice that Mario made the rounds and stopped by each table to ask how everyone's meal was going. He even waited patiently as one lady (a regular?) pulled out her wallet and started walking him through a whole bunch of family photos. Now that's something I don't see everyday.",0.9752,0.854,0.124,0.022,0.497975172975173
2008-02-23,3.0,"Marios in my mind treads the boundary between average and good. The biggest selling point is obviously the location, it's a stone's throw from where I live, so a great option to saunter in unplanned.  I wasn't hugely impressed with the fare especially for the price tag that came with it. Did like their tiramasu for dessert though, definitely better than the rather ordinary entrees. The artificial fireplace and rather dated ambiance apart, have no complaints about the neighborhood feel that it touts itself for. So while I'd be hard pressed to recommend this restaurant, if you live in the Gold coast area and need a change from the typical scene, Marios does provide a reasonable alternative.",0.8903,0.776,0.145,0.079,0.6351190476190477
2008-02-06,4.0,"I like this place and would def recommend it to anyone who is looking for a solidly good, but not spectacular Italian meal.  I have tried their ravioli and chicken marsala, which were both very tasty and seasoned well.  The bread is warm and crispy and they'll bring more if you are not listening to those diet tips and want to stuff yourself w carbs.  Waitstaff and busboys are attentive, friendly and helpful.  Sometimes you get a coupon (termed a gift certificate) in the mail if you live in the 'hood.",0.9672,0.762,0.238,0.0,0.5454545454545454
