My girlfriend and I walked in and asked if we seat ourselves or be seated by the host or hostess and before we could even finish the question, the host said "" just seat yourself "". It took 15 minutes to even get a server to come to us then. It took forever to make a wrap and open a bag of regular Lays chips. Then we sat with the bill and the card waiting to be rung up for another 10-15 minutes right after our server served he table next to us. So we gave up, walked in and asked if we pay at the register and the same host cut off our sentence again and said you should wait and pay for the server in a very ""jerk"" way. Then when we said we were sitting outside for 15 minutes waiting, annoyed he said, ""Fine, I'll do it."" Again very annoyed and then we left. Don't go here unless you don't care about customer service. I never write yelp reviews but felt very inclined. I'll never go back. Slow service is fine but for the host to be such a jerk I think speaks to the restaurant. I'll never go back.",-0.9565,0.856,0.036,0.108,0.420839874411303

2017-06-15,3.0,"This review is for a delivery order.  I was really excited to try Janik's, when I finally got some time to order in, this was the first place on my list. I ordered the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich on sourdough bread ($9.50) and the Nutella and custard croissant ($4.50). I initially ordered the two egg breakfast sandwich but the restaurant said they were out. This was rather confusing since I assumed it was a very popular choice at a mainly breakfast/brunch cafe. However, no biggie, I was still excited for my TBA sandwich.  I absolutely LOVE sourdough bread, it is always my top choice for sandwiches. This place gives you a whole bunch of choices for bread, including, croissant, brioche, english muffin, etc... The first thing i noticed about my sandwich was that it was not on sourdough bread. It looked like basic white sandwich bread you buy packaged in the bread aisle. It was also a bit stale/dry, like it has been sitting around for a while. Furthermore, they did not toast the bread, which was a bummer to me. The filling of the sandwich was decent. Everything was in a good ratio and I was able to get a bite of all the ingredients in each bite. The bacon was crispy and the avocado was fresh. However, I thought there was too much mayo and mustard, as it was dripping out of my sandwich with every bite I took. The sandwich came with a choice of side (pasta salad, potato salad, or chips), I choose potato salad. The potato salad was probably the best part of the meal. It was chunky, creamy and well seasoned.  Maybe it was because I ordered delivery, but the Nutella custard sandwich did not come warm. The description said that it came with strawberries, but there was only one strawberry in the box. The croissant was not as flaky or buttery as I would expected but it was a generous portion for less than $5. The custard comes on the side (more like a dip) which was also a surprise to me, I thought it would be with the Nutella in the sandwich.  I am not sure if I will order either of these items again. However, I am hoping to have better luck with their breakfast items, if I decide to order from them again. They definitely fell short of my exceptions, mediocre at best.",0.9963,0.803,0.167,0.03,0.4764309764309765

I have been eating here almost everyday since i work in the area (9 months) . I have ordered this almost 10x and had no issue with it so far because i love pasta. I am lactose intolerant so i order my pasta with NO CHEESE because i do not enjoy a day in the bathroom because of it.  First encounter: I order it on the Eat app and i wrote the kind of soup i wanted with my pasta combo then followed said NO CHEESE.  I got my pasta back, it has cheese. I called them immediately and tell them. She is there arguing on the phone with me that I need to say no cheese on pasta because the cook thinks it is for the SOUP. The cream of chicken soup DOES NOT HAVE CHEESE, how would it make sense for a customer to write NO CHEESE for the SOUP?? She then says well if you are lactose you can't eat this because it is creamy. EXCUSE ME? i have eaten this dish at least 10x and had no issue. You are not going to tell a customer what to eat, I am buying food from you WTF?!?! She did not even offer to REMAKE IT? i said well i need you to remake this because I CANT EAT IT. She annoyingly said is that what you want us to do? then we will.  I had taken a break from Janiks because of this issue. My coworkers got me a gift certificate to Janiks for my birthday couple days ago because they know I love their soups. I decided to give them another chance. I reordered the same exact thing but mentioned clearly NO CHEESE ON PASTA. Second encounter: I get the pasta back and there is cheese on it. I tried to keep my calm and called them to tell them AGAIN. She is on the phone arguing with me AGAIN saying that she GUARANTEE (3x) that there is no cheese on it (because he remade it twice) while i am staring at it and unless she does not know what cheese look like but it is melted on the pasta. I said well do not guarantee something you cant back up, i will bring it back and SHOW YOU.  I asked who i was talking to on the phone, showed it to her and she did not know what to say besides he is remaking another one for you. I said well i do not want another one and i want a refund and i also want a refund for this gift card that i received on my birthday because i am not eating here again.  I am in the customer service world as well and this was handled SO wrong on 2 separate occasions.

Knowing that they are more of a breakfast and brunch place, it was hard to shy away from an omelet, but I felt I should be a little bit healthier today and so only got one egg and potato-based dish. The southwest salad was large and fresh; Plenty of chicken, and a good ratio of the greens to black beans, corn, avocado, tortilla chips, and cheese. Rarely does it happen that a salad fills me up, but this one was pretty substantial. Also the breakfast bowl; it's not too hard to ask for a breakfast spot to do eggs and potatoes well, but they gave a large portion for $7(we still have some leftovers).

There was a line of people (one paying with multiple credit cards) and they told him to wait until they finished ringing up other people's order (my order was prepaid via yelp). He finally gets my food and places it inside a hot bag. He gets home and I have a  missing item and the food is cool. Obviously it was sitting there for a while. And since they were to busy charging other people they let my food get cold. I contact yelp and they refund my missing item. They call the resturant and spoke to Felipa.

The food is extremely good. I've worked my way through most of the menu, and you can't order anything sub par.  Just be aware, they are very good and very popular, if you get there at peak brunch time it will be crowded. The wait is never terrible, though.

They also have great deals on cocktails and drinks-cocktails range from 5-6 dollars and a pitcher of margarita or mimosas is only 20!  Also, the coffee is bottomless and sometimes they give you a full cup to take with you on your way out. Which brings me to my next and final point: the staff and atmosphere of Janiks is great.

2016-03-21,5.0,"""One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.....how he got in my pajamas, I'll never know.""  --Captain J. Spaulding Where else can you find commissioned pieces of art**, delicious breakfast potatoes, and the world's best banana smoothie?  If it's somewhere other than Janik's Cafe then I'd really like to know. On the heels of a couple very unpleasant breakfast experiences, I was more than a wee bit hesitant to try this Ukrainian Village hangout.  But Anna T made a handful of claims that this spot was the bombdiggity, and after eating here on 3/19/16 I'm inclined to agree with her. Once we got seated at the only unoccupied table, a waiter came by and I immediately decided on the banana yogurt smoothie.  HOLY LORD was it good.  Fresh, fruity, and fantastically filling.  Sitting there and gradually sipping away at it (I didn't want the goodness to end!), I felt that it was the tastiest smoothie I've ever had.  Sitting here and typing this all out, that still holds true.  Best.  Smoothie.  Ever.  #nobull In no time at all the food arrived and I feverishly ate my order.  The ham & cheese omelette wasn't much different than one I'd make at home, but it had plenty of meat, so that's something.  It came with toast and breakfast potatoes that were masterfully seasoned and almost didn't need hot sauce.  Almost.  But with so many choices of stuff in the condiment caddy--2 types of salsa picante (green & red), 2 types of ketchup (regular & spicy), along with butter, sugar, and an assortment of jelly--it seemed rude *not* to use them.  Major kudos for the variety. If I'm eating before 11am, it's going to include bacon.  So I was a little taken aback when my side order of bacon came out all meager-looking.  But then I realized I'd asked for 'extra crispy' (contents may shrink by 80% during cooking), and they delivered just that.  Anna T's Belgian waffle was superb, I wouldn't hesitate to order that on a future excursion. Bread = 4.5 Circuses = 5 **You're probably wondering why I leadoff this review with a Marx-ist quote (Groucho, not Karl).  I was inspired by a piece of art hanging on Janik's wall of the 2nd-most well known Marx brother, Harpo (the mute one with the top hat and curly hair, always doing sightgags). There were landscapes, surreal paintings of eyeballs, other random stuff, but a portrait of Harpo Marx instantly caught my attention.  I said to myself....""I absolutely have to have this.  This is going in my apartment.""  Our waiter gave me the guy's business card, and a few hours later the artist and I negotiated a price (his name is Brett Whitacre, for those that are interested).  As of this writing, I now have a 1-of-a-kind piece of painted glass pop art proudly displayed in my entryway!   :) BIG thanks to Janik's Cafe for a wonderful breakfast (especially the smoothie and potatoes), Anna T for the outstanding suggestion, and Brett W for being a gifted artist in his own right.  Don't worry my man, your work went to a good, appreciative home.  I figure since I started this one off with a Marx brothers quote, I might as well end it with one: ""I could dance with you 'til the cows come home. On second thought, I'd rather dance with the cows 'til you came home!""  --Rufus T. Firefly",0.9958,0.85,0.124,0.027,0.5527511495596602

2016-02-16,3.0,"*See edited review at bottom It was a Sunday morning and my partner and I were starving. It was one of those days where you spend more time than you want to trying to decide on a place to eat. We kept looking up brunch places, and just none of them were standing out to us. Fortunately, a gift from above was delivered to use. My roommate asked if we wanted to join him at Janik's Cafe. We had never been there before, so we figured why not? When we arrived the inside of the restaurant looked cozy. That's just what I want from a brunch place. The menu was a typical brunch menu. The bonus was that the food was very inexpensive compared to other breakfast/brunch places. The brunch fad has definitely been causing breakfast food prices to steadily grow, so it was refreshing to see most of the menu at or under $10. I couldn't decide what I wanted to get like usual. Did I want something savior or something sweet? That question keeps me awake at night. I overheard my friend mention maybe getting the chilaquiles, and immediately I knew what I wanted. I hadn't had chilaquiles in quite a while, so my stomach had decided. My partner chose to get the pancake combo and my friend got the breakfast bowl. As soon as our food arrived, everyone but me knew they ordered the wrong thing. The amount of food on the chilaquiles plate was insane. There was just mounds of eggs and tortilla. It had a salsa verde with it and I ordered chorizo on it, so as you can assume there was a pile of meat on top. It came with refried beans and rice on the side. I have to say that the taste lived up to the looks. It was delicious. There was so much flavor it. The fun part was you could alter the flavor as you ate by mixing and matching. Maybe one spoonful you get the chilaquiles with the beans, or maybe you get some sour cream in it, or even some with the meat. I decided to spice it up a bunch by adding some El Yucateco hot sauce that was on the table (the scary neon green one) and I didn't regret it. I can honestly say that Janik's Cafe now has my favorite chilaquiles in the city, and I will keep coming back for it. The rest of the food that my friends ordered was honestly very average. There wasn't anything special about it. The pancake combo was exactly that. Two pancakes, with small pieces of bacon, sausage patty, and eggs. It tasted alright, but nothing stood out about it. The breakfast bowls looked tasty, but the portions were kind of small in comparison to the chilaquiles. Edit: I ordered pickup from Janik's Cafe twice now and my experience with the food hasn't been as great as my first visit. The food amount is definitely reduced in the takeout containers and the presentation is not pretty at all. It looks as if they don't care how they are placing it in the container. It looks sloppy and unappetizing. I also ordered the banana walnut pancakes and was very disappointed. All that was on the pancakes was about 5 walnuts and a few slices of brown banana.",0.9438,0.848,0.096,0.055,0.5756190476190476

2016-02-01,3.0,"In the modern day society, brunch isn't quite right unless foisted with crabcakes, lox, duck eggs, etc. You're not getting with the trend until you start downing those bottomless mimosas and discussing what's the next best brunch place. That would be the least of your concerns at Janik's, your typical community cafe with the unpretentious breakfast and lunch entrees. Grab any available table, seat yourselves, and order. With five famished adults and a ridiculously inexpensive menu, we recklessly pointed our fingers across the menu like children, ""I want that...and that...and this...and that!""  1) My corned beef sandwich was served on rye with lettuce, tomatoes, pickle, mustard, and Swiss. For less than $6, my sandwich was packed with generous slices of corned beef. To complete the meal, I also had a small side of standard potato salad.  2) For $2, you can have a plump piece of french toast served with powdered sugar and condensed milk. This can easily be shared between two people, especially if you want to have enough capacity for other items. 3) A good portion of the menu is composed of Mexican-inspired items. Our chicken tostada had two sunny side up eggs with a pile of shredded meat, lettuce, tomatoes, rice, and sour cream. It was served slightly warm but the flavors were standard.  4) I like how a lot of breakfast items can be easily turned into a dessert. The pancakes with nutella and bananas are a perfect example. This platter had three thick pieces of pancakes that were crispy on the edges and fluffy in the center. In between each pancake was a generous spread of nutella and the whole stack was decorated with banana slices.  Overall, I think Janik's was well worth the visit. We ordered over 10 items in total and it didn't even damage our wallets. If you want to keep it simple, Janik's is the place to go.",0.987,0.866,0.129,0.005,0.42738095238095236
2016-01-19,5.0,"I really have to go back to writing more reviews. I'm a Chef and don't eat out much but when I do I am VERY critical. So this review is well deserved. I had the day off and while cleaning and doing laundry I got hungry. I was craving Lox and Bagels. I am originally from NY but had my first Lox and Bagel about a month ago in Chicago. I know it's not the best option to order from a cafe, especially take out but I was prepared to not be overly wowed. I ordered delivery on one of the coldest days in Chicago and my order arrived more than 30 minutes before the estimated delivery time. First off, everything was packed Really REALLY well. Everything was separated, hot separated from cold, etc. My bagel was wrapped separately, I got a container of cream cheese and then a platter that was packed and air wrapped really well with Lox, capers, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, mixed greens, and feta. The spread was fresh, veggies were crisp and I loved the addition of feta crumbles. I really enjoyed Janik's Lox and Bagel platter...really good. The only thing is..I wish the Lox was sliced thinner...but it might just be my preference. I also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes and a slice of french toast with mixed berries to make my minimum. Now I got the potatoes because I read good reviews and they did not disappoint, great flavor. I am NOT a pancake or french toast fan at all but I thought I'd get something savory so I got a slice. First off, the mixed berry compote didn't come from a can which I thought it would be. It was perfectly balanced with sweet and tart and was not overwhelmingly sweet at all. I french toast was delicious! I literally ate the whole piece right away.. usually that's not be at all. I am so satisfied that I think an omelet or Benedict is in order for next week from Janik's.

The food was great and the service was average.  This final visit:  FIRST, I had ordered a salad. Upon arrival, the salad had 20-30 rotten prices of lettuce on the plate. I could deal with a bad piece or two, but the kitchen staff knew this and continued to serve it to me. That is unacceptable.  NEXT, after removing the rotten food, I noticed there was A HAIR in my salad. Attention to detail at this restaurant is spectacular.  AFTER THAT, we had zero follow up from our server or acting manager. It became clear later that there isn't an actually manager on duty.  I was not looking to get any of the bill comped in any way. None was even offered. This sort of action would never take place while I was running a shift at my restaurant.  While I was finishing my meal, our very own waiter began closing our outdoor seating section. The section was well covered until that point. I then ate the rest of the meal in the blazing sun.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: I then asked to speak with a manager about why our experience was so poor. This was the first time I saw the ""manager"" the entire time.

This is a decision I absolutely do not regret (even if we did try milk & honey first, which had a 40-minute wait). We walked into the cafe and were immediately greeted and seated. The place was happily bustling with people, but they still found a place for us. I abhor waiting, so Janik's immediately left a good impression on me.  The menu is filled with a lot of really delicious options, so it was hard to choose. I knew I could not ignore the banana Nutella pancakes, so I gave into fate and ordered them! The wait was pretty short, so again, I was a happy camper. My banana Nutella crepes were really delicious. There were three substantially-sized pancakes with a healthy topping of bananas and Nutella with powdered sugar on too. The part that impressed me the most is that there was a spread of Nutella and banana slices between each later. I had leftovers (yay for big portions!).  The only thing keeping me back from five stars is that service wasn't particularly attentive and my water was empty for the majority of the meal. I'm forgiving, of course, because I know it was busy. Perhaps they were able to bring the food out so quickly because servers weren't filling waters and making small talk.  We noted that they also have milkshakes and fresh-squeezed juices.

I know that I can get a great meal in short amount of time. They can accommodate groups of any size and have a nice patio for outdoor dining.

2014-07-25,5.0,"My preferred place for brunch in the neighborhood! The food is very tasty standard diner fare. I like the custard with the French toast, I've never had it that way before. Cheese grits also really delicious! I can't speak to the meaty things. A really good deal for the neighborhood. The service and atmosphere are what make it 5 stars for me. Janik's reminds me a lot of the Greek diners in NY my mom would treat me to on the weekends when I was a kid, food and atmosphere-wise. The service is great -- all the staff are nice people, as is the owner, and my coffee is never empty if I don't want it to be. Overall, an excellent place to have a leisurely and low-key brunch, even during peak weekend hours in Wicker Park.",0.9748,0.819,0.173,0.008,0.4681818181818182
2014-07-21,4.0,"Pretty good brunch at a reasonable price with great service. We went on a Sunday morning around 11 am and were seated within about 5 minutes inside for 2 people. It can be a bit noisy inside so beware if your ears are fragile. Seems like a good spot for kids so they can scream at the top of their lungs and not disturb anyone. The outside patio looks like it's a good spot as well for a brunch date or small group.  We ordered the meat lover's omelette with potatoes and toast and the banana walnut pancakes. They were both terrific! We could have had another scoop of potatoes though, but oh well! The service was really attentive as well.

Luckily we only had to wait about 5 minutes and we were able to score an outdoor table. Side note: this area is perfect for people watching :) Service and price point are great, but food is pretty mediocre. I ordered the French Toast. Tasted like I could have made it from one of those frozen food packages. The eggs were also really bland. Although I wasn't impressed you did get eggs, French toast, sausage and bacon...all for $8.95. Not too shabby on the wallet. However it left me craving good French toast I'm use at other places. This is where quality over quantity comes into play. I probably won't be coming back here.

2014-07-06,5.0,"Janik's is my first choice go-to for brunch in trendy Wicker Park. It's good enough that when I moved out of Wicker, I'd still insist on meeting friends here! The reason it stands so far above the competition is combination of the food, the service, and the overall vibe of the place.  As a relaxed, relatively unassuming but nonetheless delicious brunch spot in Wicker Park, it stands in STARK contrast to pretty much everything else around. The food is generally good, not epic, or mind-boggling, or trying SUPER hard, but very good and certainly several notches above what you might expect for the price.  There's rarely a wait and the staff are usually friendly and attentive. One of the mark's of a great place in my book is whether the owners or managers remember you after a few visits, and I think this is really the element that makes it so much more appealing to me in comparison to your ultra-yuppie places like Milk and Honey or the underwhelming Bongo Room. They seat you quickly, refill your coffee constantly for free (seriously you can get your face buzzed off here on the cheap!), and are inviting as heck!  What else do you want when you've just gotten done with a work out, rolling with your Bloody Mary buzz, and feeling excellent because it's Saturday?!",0.9959,0.743,0.237,0.02,0.5591904761904761

It is hard to believe they have the most disgusting Velveeta mac and cheese on the market, more like something you would get at the chintziest diners. Just boil some macaroni, put in some butter, milk and shredded real cheddar cheese, viola.  You could even bake it for a bit. Viola, mac and cheese.

2014-04-01,3.0,"Janik's Cafe is a great place to visit on a frequent basis. The service is quick and friendly, and usually a very short wait. The food, while very average, is really cheap with decent quality ingredients.  Breakfast Bowl -  I got this with an addition of avocado and it and it wasn't too bad. It was pretty much Southwest style of of skillet. While nothing really burst with flavor, I think it was an acceptable offering, at a fraction of the price of a normal skillet meal. There are multiple options of meats for the bowl, and everything turned out as expected.  Eggs and Crabcake -  I had this the first time trying Janik's and was not a good selection. While the eggs were done properly, the crab cake had a really high breadcrumb ratio. I understand that the margin for a cafe like Janik's must be very low, but I rather that this option be omitted off the menu. I think the execution was rough, and the crab cake really didn't do the preparation any justice, and almost turned me off to the whole experience.  French Toast - The french toast was $2. Seriously. A side of french toast with condensed milk dipping sauce was $2. And in all honesty, it could've been shared between two people as a sweet add-on. In addition to being affordable, the side was actually executed really well. It was definitely worth every penny.  Nutella and Banana Pancake -  After getting relatively filling entrees, two of my friends decided to continue the party (since everything was so cheap) and split a Nutella/Banana Pancake. This was a really good choice because Nutella and Banana are a match made in heaven. While the overall pancake was a bit too sweet (it was dripping in Nutella and banana action), it was hot and still pretty good. It is a lot of pancake to consume, so I'm glad that we were able to share it rather than having to order a full portion for myself to finish.  Overall, I think Janik's Cafe is a great casual breakfast joint that produces relatively good quality food (in conjunction with the price). I would consider the food itself to be acceptable, but not too far above that standard. But the pricing, speed, and the friendly service will definitely bring me back again and again. They also have a vast variety of food options that helps keep each visit pretty fresh. So you're hungry, you don't wanna wait, and you want a big bang for your buck... definitely give it a try.",0.9979,0.761,0.208,0.031,0.45198275862068976
2014-03-30,5.0,"I can't even begin to express how much I love Janik's. We started going here 6 or 7 years ago. In the summer, because it is so close, we stroll the four blocks to Janik's for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. When we first started coming here we had one kid...now we have three. They recognize us, always give us a warm greeting, and take great care of us. We love the outdoor dining area when the weather is nice. Service/staff is lovely, restaurant feels like a small business - fun art on the walls, lots of personality - not bland and stark like so many places close by. They serve cocktails/beer (great place to visit during Division Fest!) and great mimosas/bloody mary's.  THE FOOD: nothing short of awesome. My kids get chocolate chip pancakes or Mac n cheese every time (which I pray they don't finish so I can dig in!). My husbands gets this awesome shrimp omlette, sometimes with a little spinach tossed in. I like the egg/cheese (sometimes with bacon) sandwich with the fruit bowl (always great fruit here). I've seen people order huge meals, and others have a bagel and fruit. There are so many options, you can bring a group here and everyone will find something they like. And...they serve breakfast all day!  When we go for lunch my kids still get the pancakes or Mac n cheese. I had the pulled pork sandwich today and I can honestly say I liked it better than Smoke Daddy's. Just melts in your mouth - I ate it in seconds...heaven. My husband got the chicken fajitas and he raved about them. We've enjoyed their burgers, chicken sandwiches, and wraps. Yummy salads, too! Once I just wanted grilled chicken, tomato, cheese, onion and lettuce in a wrap with sour cream...""no problem"" they said. The staff are friendly and hard working. The place is clean, the atmosphere is always upbeat. They give my kids animal crackers and coloring stuff while we wait for our food!  I must not forget the coffee - delicious! You can get it in a cozy mug, or a to-go cup. I often order the vanilla latte...I am picky about my coffee and this is one of the few places I am exited to order it from! My husband commented that when you compare prices here to other places on Division, you get better food here for so much less. They are beyond reasonable and the food isn't pretentious...just good solid eats! We like that we can eat here twice a week and still spend less than hitting many of the other spots once. We actually went twice just this past week! The employees here speak very highly of the owner (who is so kind and always cheerfully greeting guests) and there appears to be very little turn-around. I've noticed that they have added staff, but seems like no one has left since we started going there. I think that says a lot about the business itself and I am happy to support that by eating here.  Bottom line: the food here is straightforward - I like that you can keep it simple, but since it is fresh and homemade, it tastes amazing. Prices are the best in town and this is a fun place to take out-of-towners (my parents love going here when they are in town!) and kids. You.

I will have to give kudos to the system as it is very easy to use. My husband ordered a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and I ordered a steak and cheese omelet with mushrooms. Since we were under the 15 dollar limit, I also ordered the cheesy hash browns. Aaaaaand here's where the low ratings come in. When we got ready to eat our food, there was no bacon in my husband's BACON, egg, and cheese sandwich. Then, my pet peeve. The hash browns were NOT hash browns but rather breakfast potatoes (which I personally am not fond). To top it off, there was NO cheese... sigh. Oh I also forgot to mention that they had a strange after taste which led me to believe that the oil they used was quite old. I also would not have ordered the potatoes if the description of the omelet stated the inclusion of potatoes. The positives were the delivery service and the omelet.

She replied, ""yes, I'm the manager, do you want to order something?""--long story short, the customer service left a lot to be desired, from the manager to the server, who could care less that I was displeased with my food. They, didn't offer me anything, and I actually had to go back to have them remove the item I sent back off of my check.

The first two times, I had the same waitress (kept forgetting to remember her name!)  and basically sat in the same table.  The other two times, I've had two different waiters, different tables. The first day, I had the lime-chicken soup and Chilaquiles and the second was creamy tomato fettucine and another bowl of soup. With the other two, one was a two-eggs and ham, while the other was another set of eggs with pancakes. The Chilaquiles was quite excellent, and more food than I had originally planned for (probably 'cos of the soup). Having the creama and salsa was handy! The fettucine with the chicken was good as well; almost reminded me of a vodka sauce but alas it was just creamy tomato.  Yay, coffee! The over-easy eggs and ham was good; other than the whites being rather runny. Loved the taste of the ham, and the potatoes were excellent.  Better than shredded potatoes/hashbrowns. Fourth time around, over easy eggs (uh, again with the whites?) and great fluffy powder sugared pancakes.  The meat candy (bacon) was excellent, being crunchy which I quite enjoyed.  Soda can, but no glass compared to the first time where I had a glass to pour it into. Not picky but if it was summer time, glass w/ ice would be welcomed. The lime chicken was very good, kinda reminds me of the chicken soup I had down in Guadalajara one time at the Supermercado. The cafe itself was very nice, loved the openess and availability of the seats, the way they recycle bottle beer packages to hold their sugar/seasonings.  Bright lightings, large open North windows.  Even the artwork was nice to look at while waiting for the food which came pretty fast. A good plus is the payment via credit/debit.  Decent hours, especially if you want a really late breakfast.

I tried both the blt with avocado as well as the lox and bagel. The sandwich was pretty good, but nothing special. It came with a bag of chips which I could do without. The lox and bagel was a better choice, with fresh lox (though, could have been cut a bit thinner) and some traditional accompaniments. Overall, the food was good, but it was not outstanding - a 3.  Service was friendly, but not quick. We sat with empty plates on our table for a bit too long and waited a while to order. Also, there was no mayo on the blt, so that had to be requested later (and came when the sandwich was almost totally eaten). However, everyone was friendly and helpful. A 3 for service.

Like many places, you place your order at the counter and then they bring it to your table. The rice and beans arrived stone cold and must have been sitting out for a long time. I asked for fresh, hot beans and rice and they returned the wrap to me while I waited for the rice and beans. The chorizo was very bland and nothing to write home about. The fresh beans and rice arrived when I was halfway done and were ok. Overall, the only thing I had that I can recommend was the $5 bloody mary, which was just right.

I ordered the breakfast bowl, which is basically potatoes, sausage, onions, and green peppers on the bottom with an over easy egg, a little bit of salsa and black beans on the top. It also comes with toast. And the lady at the cashier, who I think is the owner, had to add a HUGE caramel latte to my order so that it would be over $10, and it just barely was after that. I think I paid $1.17 in tax. So the prices are great, you can get an enormous meal for a cheap price. Also I ate the leftovers the next day for breakfast and they tasted just as amazing as the day before. I cannot recommend Janik's enough. Incredibly friendly service, food was ready fast, and was delicious.

Two coffees came out promptly.  I didn't care for the coffee at all, either it was the coffee itself, but I'm also sure it was because they don't offer real creamer, rather coffee mate (sorry, that stuff's gross).  They also   served their coffee in styrofoam to-go cups.  At this point in time, who's serving coffee in styrofoam? I guess I just got back from SF where whole heartedly embraced their green initiatives, but I still think styrofoam is a bit tacky. The kicker was when the food came out.  We didn't have salt, pepper so we went inside and grabbed one off one of the tables since the wait staff seemed to busy to help us.  The huevos were fine, nothing special but the lox platter came with lox that was brown on the edges, indicating that it was old.  When the staff came out of refill the coffee, we pointed this out.  All the woman (owner?) did was agree that the lox was brown and wasn't fresh before she apologized and left after refilling our coffee.   Looking at other reviews, I don't know if we had an atypical experience or if we expected it would be a good place for brunch.  A lot of reviews and patron seem to enjoy their sandwiches, but I'd definitely hold off if your expecting something more in the lines of Milk & Honey or Letizia's",0.987,0.869,0.106,0.025,0.4446729196729197

Next thing I knew, I ran to the doorway of Janik's, the only cafe that had open tables on a Saturday morning. Janik's was my home for at least six hours as I studied, and it didn't really disappoint as a study spot. It had a steady stream of customers to create some background noise, but wasn't overcrowded. I also adore the art you can find here: paintings on plexiglass, for sale by a local artist, as you can see in one of the photos.  I didn't like the Chai for it was too sweet, but I was tempted by their array of food: breakfast, lunch sandwiches, Mexican, etc. They also have daily food specials, a row of Stash teas to choose from and some alcoholic beverages.  After five hours, I finally gave in and bought myself their Belgian waffle special that came with some eggs and bacon. The Belgian waffle was a nice flower, coated with powdered sugar, that hit the spot...for only ~$6. Not bad! The waffle ended up being a lifesaver since my dinner that night in the area was horrible!

Also, the abundance of strawberry jelly (as opposed to its redheaded stepchild ""grape jelly""...ugh) was appreciated.

2008-04-16,5.0,"Caveat:  this is a Pitchfork-style review with anecdotal evidence.  I had a lot of time to think about this review while riding the bus today. GOD, I HATE WICKER PARK!!! When I first moved to Chicago, all my friends that live or have lived in the city told me that Wicker Park would fit my creative personality.  Now, I have to sorta take that as an insult (not really, but still, Wicker Park is as much of an artist's community as Six Flags).  I wanted to make a web comic that encapsulates the Wicker Park experience.  Each edition would be the same premise (inspired by, ya know, places like Earwax): Customer walks in to order a sandwich... Cust:  Hi, could I get the California Club and a cup of soup please? Server:  *with obvious suggestion of severe ennui* uuuuuuuuugggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... yeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaah, I guess Cust:  Oh, um, gee, sorry to put you out.  Can I pay today with my debit card? Server: *even stronger boredom* uuuuuuuuugggggggghhhhhhhhh.... naaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh, did you, uhhhhhhhhhhhhh, read, uhhhhhhhhhhhh, the sign?  Uhhh, sooo boooored! I've never seen people so painfully bored in my life.  I've also never really experienced the inability to get good, no frills or surprises, food.  I'm from the south, and we like food that keeps it simple, uses fresh ingredients, and is priced accordingly.  I'm sorry, I 'm just not into experimental, artisan-crafted, fusion dishes that are fun-sized and more satisfying to look at than eat (I'm looking at YOU, Las Palmas Restaurant, and your Mexican-French-Intergalactic Fusion Clusterf**k... just make me a quesadilla... Steely Dan Christ!).   I enjoy fine food every now and again, but Jeebus, if I want art, I'll take the blue line to Monroe and visit the Art Institute.  If I want a sandwich, I want bread, some stuff, cheese, and a satisfying side. Janik's Cafe takes everything I hate about Wicker Park cuisine and inverses it... giving me a profound sense of hope again! I've eaten there twice this week! Good, tasty food that's simple:  timeless sandwiches, hearty salads, chunky soups, and even Mexican dishes and breakfast food (served all day).  I had a warm Chicken Cesar sandwich today for $4.75 that is still keeping me fat and happy at this very moment.  You get an awesome, eclectic, but unpretentious meal, and when you throw down a 10 spot, you get change.   Plus, everybody employed there is more than happy to see you because they seem to care about their food and business and appreciate you spending your money there and enjoying the food.  I'm a former server, so I know how to provide good service and also what to expect.  And Janik's delivers. It isn't hard - good, uncomplicated, wholesome food that's filling with a choice of different side dishes at a very fair price, coupled with smiles and an inviting atmosphere.  I don't know why this concept is lost on the rest of Wicker Park and some of the surrounding area, but since Janik's is a rock in a sea of lameness, I will continue to make a special trip to Damen & Division for my favorite lunch in Chicago.",0.9978,0.733,0.202,0.065,0.6092305037957214
