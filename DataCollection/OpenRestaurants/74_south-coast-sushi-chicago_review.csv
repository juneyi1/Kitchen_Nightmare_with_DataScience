2017-07-30,5.0,"Our favorite neighborhood joint. Where do we start? Food-wise we stick to the basics (Sushi) and it's consistently delicious. Consistency is key because we've been over 30 times between take-out and dine-in and they've never gotten an order wrong. All of their sushi is rolled to perfection and presentation is on point. Service-wise, we've never had a bad experience. Everyone is upbeat, full of energy and very knowledgeable about the food. Additionally, South Coast is hyper-sensitive to my wife's celiac and does a great job accommodating (separate gluten-free soy sauce/king crab instead of imitation/etc.).",0.9464,0.79,0.181,0.029,0.7708333333333333

2017-06-03,4.0,"Tonight we were in the mood for sushi and SCC is our local go to for such cravings. As usual we were promptly greeted and seated.  AMBIANCE: this is a great date night spot with dim lighting, candles on the tables, interesting chandeliers and soft music. There is a sushi bar for those that like to watch the chefs at work, a cocktail bar for those looking for a liquid meal, outdoor seating and regular tables inside.  STAFF: they are courteous, friendly, and willing to explain anything on the menu. DRINKS: we tried out the original sake which came in an ice bucket with a cold sake glass and was delicious. I also tried the sunburst cocktail which was white rum, cranberry juice, and peach juice with an orange slice on ice (photo attached) which was very strong but also quite good. APPETIZERS: first came the complimentary fried seaweed with two dipping sauces which was absolutely fantastic, it's like a Japanese play on chips and dip! Then we ordered the tempura sampler which was pretty average but especially enjoyed the corn patty (photos attached). MAIN COURSE: we tried out the dragon roll and the sushi platter. The chef was nice enough to go over all the types of fish on the platter and everything was delicious! Very fresh fish, sticky rice and nice tight rolls with unlimited soy sauce. OTHER: there is next to no parking for this place, it's all street parking and the closest train stop is at Roosevelt so it's a bit hard to get to unless you're local but it's definitely a must if you're in the area!",0.9958,0.761,0.215,0.024,0.5499806674806674

Full service bar, and free parking across the street are nice touches.  My favorites are the volcano roll and the Sea Bass. The texture of the sea bass is so velvety, I often crave it.

Once I got a really sour/old batch. Out of the 3 orders I ordered. They gave me 10% off my next order and one order of free sushi to make up for this. It did take me almost a week to call in but that's besides the point. They know me in there and know I come in at least twice a week. This had me slightly upset. My drive to this place is about 20-30 minutes each way, so yes it is that good. And of course this is why I didn't immediately report the sushi that I had to throw away as I wasn't sure exactly when I'd make it back. Other than this.

2016-12-14,2.0,"This restaurant was a complete disappointment. I've been to a number of sushi places many much cheaper than this restaurant that have been much better dining experiences in every aspect. That might be a little unfair, the atmosphere is nice. --The Food The most important part of any restaurant is of course, the food. At South Coast Sushi I ate the following dishes: Miso Soup: 3.5/5 Pretty decent Miso Soup, I've seen it messed up by some restaurants. They actually did a decent job, but it was a bit too salty.  Gyoza: 2.5/5 The Gyoza was astonishingly mediocre. The pork filling was decent, but not very big. The dough was very crisp, which was not a style I enjoyed as it did not allow the flavor of the sauce to stick to the dumpling. This was not a great start to the meal, but I was still open-minded. Tekka Makki(Tuna Rolls): 2/5 This dish is a staple of any good sushi restaurant. They served them a sizable portion of tuna, but the texture and flavor were not particularly good making the tuna rolls really quite unenjoyable. Shrimp Dumplings: 2.5/5 The shrimp fell out of the dumpling when I tried to eat it because of how the dough was cooked loosely around the shrimp. Not being able to eat the shrimp with the dough was quite disappointing.  Sushi: 4/5 I ordered Sweet Shrimp, Squid, Ikura(fish egg), and Salmon nigiri sushi. These were all quite good in my opinion, but I had not tried Squid and Sweet Shrimp before so I don't have any way to judge them. However the Ikura and Salmon nigiri I always get when I order Sushi and they were both quite good. --The Service Had the service at this restaurant been good I think that this would have been a 3, maybe 4 star review and not 2 stars. The service was horrible. It took 30 minutes for tekka makki and shrimp dumplings to come out. Then it took about 40 minutes after we ordered for us to get the Sushi we ordered. The restaurant was at less than half capacity so there was no reason the food should have taken this long. Perhaps the restaurant could have rescued itself from a bad review if it had recognized the long wait for service, but instead the server seemed offended when we asked(very politely) about the long wait.",0.4252,0.81,0.099,0.09,0.5540705128205128

As i was eating my roll I discovered that the rice was somewhat mushy and that it created a mushy texture with the avocado in my roll. i also discovered that the End pieces of the roll did not have any of the shrimp tempura in it so it was just mushy rice, avocado and a little piece of the fried crust of the tempura shrimp- without any shrimp).  My friend's Crab roll were very large, larger than average, however it was mostly rice that was creating that inflated size. She ended up taking off most of the rice and setting it aside, and also stated that the eel sauce was not like the typical sauce that she gets from other places. it wasn't as sweet.

2016-02-04,4.0,"South Coast Sushi....sister to one of my favs! I've dined at the south location a few times now and each time the experience was great. Keynote different than the OG Coast...it is NOT byob, however they have a full bar and offer great drink deals throughout the week. They also offer a very creative martini menu. (Example: jalepeno martini...it works) I will say, what they lack in byob, they made up in parking. YES that's right...a FREE parking lot right across the street for South Coast customers. This is HUGE for a city dweller...plus it's the south loop so parking in general of just easier than Bucktown. I usually always order sushi here and always always get their special roll of the night to ensure the most fresh of fish...and that it is. I feel like their sushi rolls are more creative here than most other sushi joints. I've never had a bad meal here. PLUS, upon being seated, you are given their complimentary tempura dipped seaweed type deal (really I can't remember what it is exactly but it's good...and gone in seconds). The sauces that accompany this free little treat are super delicious....hang on to them and dip your rolls in it - trust me.  Lastly, when I was here on Monday, my girlfriend was kind enough to treat me, and also mentioned to the waitress it was my birthday. They then told us to hang on (as we finished our HALF PRICED bottle of wine...Monday's special). The waitress came back with a (comped) delicious birthday treat complete with a candle so I could make a wish. It was the cutest thing:) South Coast consistently served up unique and fun sushi rolls, with a quite ambiance perfect for catching up with friends, or even date night.

2015-11-16,3.0,"The Saturday past we decided late in the game to head out for sushi. Coming from the Bridgeport area, many sushi bars were quoting hour long wait times. Here we were able to score a table within twenty minutes. In attendance were six adults and three kids.  After seating and handed menus we didn't see the waiter again for over fifteen minutes.  A busboy stopped by with water right before our waiter returned.  The late timing of our waiter would be repeated constantly over the course of our dinner.  The place was moderately busy but most tables were on the tail end of their meals. Later evening on a Saturday night, the lights were dimmed to a level where we needed to use the table votive (light) to see the menus. The place is decorated quite nicely. I guess it could be a fine dining option with friends or on a date.  The front area of the restaurant could be used as a meeting place, if professionals aim to meet clients for a meal or chat. We placed orders for 3 - 4 appetizers, 8 - 9 rolls of sushi, we had some sashimi, a couple bottles of hot sake, some noodles and a few more items.  Many of the rolls ordered were off the deluxe sushi menu.  All but two types of rolls were average stuff.  The appetizers weren't memorable except fodder for my review. For example the shrimp dumplings, which I expected to be more than a large triangle dumpling filled with a single piece of boiled shrimp.  At a cost of 4 pcs for $10.50!, we should have gotten the gyoza instead or a few pieces of ebi.  I don't mind spending money, but there should be a value realized when tasting.  For instance, the noodle dish which I want to guess was yakisoba with chicken (?) A good selection, everyone thought the noodles were tasty, however I think a bowl went for almost $13 dollars.  (Yikes)  Service was so slow.  Alike another review that recalled the experiences of a large group dining, they mentioned their food arriving slowly, the same I would relate about this experience.  Slow, hard to find staff, when I called for someone to come over they motioned for us to wait for ""our"" waiter.  Wonk, wonk, wonk.. Okay experience which I probably wouldn't repeat right away.  If I'm in the hood, it wouldn't be my first choice.  But if others wanted to check it out, I'd probably join in.",0.9705,0.924,0.065,0.011,0.4936202686202685

I remember feeling disappointed at the portion and then being annoyed at my bill. I was expecting the standard 8 piece per roll.

2015-02-09,4.0,"Interesting ware-housey atmosphere, outfitted with cool tables, booths, a sitting area, plants, bar, etc. that break up the space and give it a trendy feel. The house music helps the trendiness too. Standouts: The free appetizer: Tempura seaweed strips with two dipping sauces - the wasabi mayo is yummy. The ginger salad: Unlike any other ginger salad I've had at a Japanese restaurant. It's a good-sized salad, composed of real mixed greens (including some Asian greens I think..? I couldn't tell, I ate it too quickly to contemplate), and the perfect amount of a very light ginger dressing that had a tiny spicy kick to it! Not your typical orange dressing.  The sushi: I always order a mix of straight-up ngiri and sashimi, which gives me a good idea of the quality of the food. It was all excellent! I actually went in with low expectations, unsure if Chicago could pull off good Japanese, and I was pleasantly surprised. The rolls: I typically steer clear of maki, since I don't want too many sauces masking the flavor of the fish, but I tried a couple - south scallop maki (pan-fried scallop sandwiched in a dynamite roll), and the spring maki. These seem good if you like maki, but the true stars of the night were the ngiri and sashimi. Definitely going back!",0.9857,0.801,0.181,0.018,0.5053086419753087

I will acknowledge that I was wrong about the ambiance inside the restaurant.  It was cute and cozy and classy, but casual.  Unfortunately, we got a brand new waiter who didn't know anything, so wasn't able to ask any of our questions about the menu.  He wasn't that attentive either.  They do have a special 5% off for customers who pay in cash, so stop by the ATM before you come by, although I don't recommend coming by. Overall, everything was meh, for an expensive price.  If you're looking for good Sushi in the south loop, go to Kai Sushi on State & 13th St.  The ambiance there isn't as nice, but the quality and flavor of the sushi and the service is much better.  Stop by Jewel ahead of time for much cheaper drinks than a $9 martini.",0.9644,0.712,0.165,0.123,0.5720603720603721

Our server was very good and she won extra points later in the dinner.  They seemed a bit short staffed so drinks took a while.  Not a big deal.  We received the complimentary tempura seaweed/kale thing.  it was tasty but you really can't go with wrong with anything that's been ""tempured"".  We started off with the Tuna Tartare, Volcano and Spring Maki.  The tartare was good but, just like Hub51, they serve it with a Styrofoam like sesame chip.  House made won ton chips are the ONLY way to serve tuna tartare or poke, people! The Volcano was good but the snow drift like tempura crumbs added nothing to the dish.  The spring maki was just okay.  Our 2nd round was the spicy tuna, crunch maki and super white tuna and Toro Nigiri.  For the first time for me, I liked the nigiri better than the maki. The toro was excellent and was the star of the meal.  The super white was also good.  The maki kind of feel flat and didn't have enough taste. Then came the biggest misstep of the night.  We were drinking Belvedere martinis, straight up with a twist.  Our 2nd round of drinks were taking a long time. Our waitress finally brought our martinis to the table and apologized.  No problem and we took our first sip and my partner and I just looked at each other.  Is there Sprite in this we both asked? It might've been tonic but the vodka was carbonated and sweet. It's bad when you go in for your first sip of a drink and taste something totally unexpected. We flagged our waitress down and told her the drinks weren't right.  She apologized and then shot death looks at the bartenders.  I'm guessing she had previous problems with them that night.  She apologized and said she would take these back and make the new ones herself.  Great move! She came back with our new drinks and they were perfect. Maybe we needed to go out of our comfort zone with the maki and try some new stuff.  Maybe they were short staffed or the room was ""star struck"" since Blackhawks Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane were dining right behind us.  Who knows.  I wanted to be ""wowed' and I was just ""content"" by my meal.",0.9974,0.745,0.196,0.058,0.4831141463900082

The decor is really beautiful - lots of raw wood and diy-looking chandeliers. I loved it.  I'm a vegetarian and enjoyed the miso soup (nothing to write home about, but tasty), ginger salad (the lettuce was very green and leafy but the dressing was a bit too spicy and not your typical ginger dressing), and several veggie rolls - one of which was not on the menu but was recommended my our waiter. They were both good and reasonably priced.  Overall - I'd say it's a slightly better than average sushi place (for someone who doesn't eat fish) with fantastic ambiance and great service. Because of that, I would recommend going IN to eat and not ordering out - you're paying for the experience on-site at this place.

2013-11-09,4.0,"South Coast was better than I expected in a lot of ways. Yelp was making me think that this place was just whatever, but it's not. It's pretty chic inside, with dark wood decor and artsy chandeliers. Their dinnerware (can't believe I just said that) is modern and trendy, and their plating is thought out. It's like your neighborhood sushi bar, turned up a notch or two. I think it would be a great place for a date-- nice enough to feel special but not stuffy enough to feel awkward.  I went with a group of three girls. We all got martinis and all of them were simple and good. Don't expect any crazy mixology. The seaweed salad we got to start was everything you'd want in that dish: super fresh, a little acidic. It came with a little cucumber, too. The tuna tartare was great as well. The tuna was diced and mixed with ginger and white soy, then served with a crispy sesame cracker. The waitress also brought us a complimentary appetizer-- I think it was deep fried seaweed. It came with two super yummy and fatty mayo dips that we ended up dipping everything in.  We had two maki rolls, the Crunchy and the Dragon Rock. The Crunchy roll left a little to be desired. It was covered in tempura crumbs but lacked the texture you'd expect from them. The Dragon Rock roll was savory goodness, but I'm not sure how you can go wrong with a deep fried roll filled with shrimp, avocado, jalapeno, and spicy mayo. I also had a piece of tuna nigiri (my first nigiri!) and I really enjoyed being able to taste the freshness of the fish by itself.  That wasn't enough to fill us up so we ordered another round of food. Whoops. I felt kind of dumb ordering the chicken teriyaki but it was worth it. Super tender slices of chicken covered in a tasty sauce that had just the right of tang and sweetness. We also had miso soup and a side of asparagus (pretty generous portion).  The waitress noticed that I was opening a birthday gift from my friend and was nice enough to bring out a little birthday dessert with fried bananas and a candle.",0.9978,0.736,0.22,0.044,0.5950314153439151

My bias is towards savory, spicy and tangy, so I'm not very informative on desserts and I'm not a big roll person. The kani ceviche is a delicious start, esp if you really like lime as much as I do. The hamachi carpaccio is also very good and less filling. The spicy miso is great for me, though the amount of spiciness varies from visit to visit...nose-runningly hot this evening, which I loved. Tonight I had the super white ponzu app which was very yummy.

The hamachi is consistently delicious (yeah...that's among my favorites everywhere, but they don't fail expectations).

My sister, a girlfriend and I came here last night prior to the Justin/Jay Z concert at Soldier Field to grab a drink and maybe a couple rolls before the show. We were lucky enough to grab a few seats at a small table near the patio which we shared with another group of girls. I'd say that is where our luck ended. It was busy and crowded (most likely due to the concert), but to say the service was horrendous is an understatement. No one came over to us (not even a bus boy) for 40 MINUTES. We asked one waiter to take our drink order, and she told us she was not our server. We asked another waiter to take our order and he said the same and by that point, my girlfriend told him which wine we wanted and that was that. It took him another 15 minutes to come back to our table and tell us that there were no clean wine glasses in the restaurant and they were trying to find some for us. After another 10 minutes of waiting, I finally went up to the host stand and voiced my complaint and utter shock of how terrible the service was. The hostess did manage to get us our bottle of wine (after another 5 minutes) and three champagne flutes...since there were no wine glasses. There were also no water glasses left, so we did not even get water during this entire time. No one even dare ask us if we wanted to order food and by that point, I just wanted to finish our wine and get out of there. I had to go back up to the host stand to ask for the check (my sister and girlfriend wanted to leave without even paying-but since I've worked in the hospitality business before, I didn't want to do that). After waiting another 10ish minutes for a check, I was at a total loss. We threw down some cash and walked out, without seeing our server, the hostess or anyone of any sort of managerial role.

2013-02-23,1.0,"OMG.  One of the worst dining experiences of my life. I went there last night with my boyfriend and some of his friends.  We were celebrating the birthday of a guest from out of town.  It was a huge disappointment.  The service was absurdly slow and much of the food was awful. We arrived at 7:30 and were seated around 8.  That's OK for a Friday night.  We eventually got some water and placed drink orders.  When the drinks came, the server spilled a drink on me and the diner next to me.  And it got worse.   Others in our party ordered the softshell crab and promptly sent it back.  It was mushy, not crunchy.  The excuse we got was, there is sauce in the crab, that's why it's not crunchy.  According to the diners that ate it, there was no evidence of sauce.  it was probably mushy because it had been sitting around in the kitchen before it was served. We were comped an odd appetizer:  seaweed tempura.  Or maybe it was deep fried lawn clippings, that's about how big the pieces were. One member of our party ordered sweet shrimp.  She held it up by the base of the tail and it drooped sadly over to one side.  It was flaccid.  It needed Viagra. Food slowly appeared with no particular rhyme or reason.  Other diners had their food while my BF and I waited for our small order, some sushi and one roll.  We sat and sat, all we had was miso soup, water and tea while everyone else got food.  Finally, after we complained to the manager, an hour and fifteen minutes after being seated,  we got our dinner.  My BF complained that his eel was overcooked, crunchy, not tender.  I had a dragon roll that was small and unremarkable. We got some sort of roll for the table, something with scallops.  Yuck.  The roll tasted awful.  It looked like they took one scallop, sliced it in thirds and somehow treated it so it was like a tiny rubbery hockey puck. Oh, did I mention the music?  It was some sort of repetitive electronic something or other.  Now don't think I don't like electronic music, I do.  I like loud, abrasive industrial rock.  But this was just repetitive.  The beat of the music matched the throbbing in my head that developed as the evening went on. So I Ieft with a headache and a feeling of slight nausea.  Not how you want to feel after leaving a restaurant.

2013-02-11,4.0,"My husband and I went in on a cold, wet and slushy Sunday afternoon after going to Field Museum. I suspect this place is jammin' during the week, but it was very quiet that day (not a complaint). We were seated immediately and enjoyed the sleek and modern decor. Our server was very sweet and helpful.  We thought it was the best sushi we have had so far in Chicago. We started with a Seaweed Su, and it was so good, I wish we got two! We got two signature maki rolls and 4 regular maki rolls. As the name and price would lead you to believe, we enjoyed the signature maki rolls more than the regular, although all of it was delicious. Our favorite out of all of them was the Popper maki, which was smoked salmon, cream cheese, jalapeno, cilantro, fried nori roll with an avocado hot sauce. The only roll that was a little unmemorable was the Crunchy maki, which was tuna, spicy mayo, scallion, avocado, cucumber, tempura crumb. It just didn't leave much of an impression for us, personally. There is lots to choose from, so we will probably try many others next time. Great saki options.

2013-01-18,1.0,"Twenty minutes ago, we walked away from what may have been the worst sushi experience.  Ever.  In my life. As residents of the South Loop, we really wanted to love this place.  So in support of another local business, we stopped in tonight to finally give it a try.  Eeek. DECOR:  At first glance, the restaurant looks great...nice ambiance, with a beautiful & stylish decor.  But ""you can't judge a book by it's cover""...and the trendy outer shell of this place only goes skin deep. SERVICE:  I'm still struggling to figure out how our server could have been any less attentive.  And it's not like we came in during the dinner rush time:  It was later in the evening, and the table to my right (as well as a few others) were now vacant.  But there we sat...drink menus still in hand, hoping to order cocktails, yet nothing to sip on but the warm water in a spotty glass after 20 minutes. So then our server finally takes our drink order...which was a simple request of a beer for me and tonight's drink special for my wife.  Shouldn't have been too hard to remember, but apparently we were forgotten about.   Tick...tock...tick...tock.  I'm out of water, and at this point, can't even get a refill to quench the thirst...So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt...maybe they're really slammed tonight?  Perhaps the bar is backed up?  Uh, no.  I look over at the bar to my left, and there are two bartenders and what looks like a manager, yacking it up and having a good time like it's grade school recess time.   After another 15 minutes, we look at each other and begin to think that getting up and making a graceful exit would be a good way to end this unpleasant service experience.  But just as we were getting up and putting on our coats, our server magically appeared with our drinks.  I can only assume that the bottle opener for my beer was somehow missing and this is the reason why it took so painfully long.  I should have ordered something with a twist top... Finally...we get to order food.  My wife selects the ceviche appetizer, the sushi entree consisting of assorted fish, and their namesake roll...the Coast Crab roll.  At long last, with drinks in hand, we settled in for what we hoped would be great food.  But little did we know that the worst was yet to come... FOOD:  We should have walked out when we had the chance.  Each of the items that we ordered lacked any imagination...lacked any visual appeal or presentation...and most egregiously...lacked any form of taste. Starting with the ceviche...below average at best.  Imagine a soggy leaf of red cabbage, with unidentifiable chunks of leftover seafood stacked on top, then drizzled with a few teaspoons of lime that tasted like it came from one of those plastic green limes from the Jewel supermarket nearby.  All of this flanked by an asian sesame cracker that was nuked in a microwave a minute too long.  There were also bits of corn mixed in, but they tasted like they came from a tin can, probably bought at the same time while they were at Jewel.  Blah. On to the sushi entree...which was an overpriced yet very amateurish effort.  Oddly, it looked like someone used a spoon to cut these pieces of fish...and then slapped these sad, jaggedly looking morsels over the top of a wad of rice.  Not surprising, it tasted about as good as it looked. Last and certainly least...the proud namesake:  the South Coast Crab roll.  This may have been the biggest tragedy of the entire meal...and this was from the ""Signature Maki"" section of their menu.  It's as if they were still at that Jewel supermarket, and they happen to stroll by the deli and picked up a prepackaged California roll in one of those a clear plastic disposable containers.  Then after taking it out and slapping it on an aluminum cafeteria serving tray, they sprinkled a little red tabiko on top just for an exciting visual effect.  Lastly, to make sure it's ""garnished"", they dump a generous handful of stale panko bread crumbs on top.  This could have been the most flavorless, uninspired roll I've every tasted.  Ever.  In my life.  Heck, somebody probably could have sprinkled tabiko & panko over the top of a #2 pencil and I would not have known the difference if this were a blind taste test.  Don't just take my word for it...please take a peek at some of the pictures other Yelpers have posted...and if you still dare to sample these sad looking morsels, be sure to smother it in wasabi soy sauce if you're looking to enjoy any form of taste. ""How is your dinner?  Is everything good?"" our server asks cheerfully. Speechless is my only response. After another lengthy wait for the check, we submit to the fleecing of our wallets and savor the flavor of buyers remorse as we finally put our jackets back on.  We should have left long ago when we had the chance... We really wanted to love you guys.  We really did.  Oh well.  Maybe we'll see each other again over at Jewel.",0.9945,0.788,0.133,0.079,0.49866843033509695

I would rank South Coast's sweet potato the first among all the Japanese restaurants in Chicago, before Roka and Yuzu. I also liked the banana maki at South Coast, which was nicely decorated. However I prefer the ones at Sushi Taiyo and P.F. Chang, which are crunchy. Moreover, while gomae (spinach) was nicely decorated, it was not that fresh. Not enough sauce was given to make up the dish's lack of flavor. Finally, the tamagoyaki was thick, but it lacked flavor.  The portions at South Coast are relatively small. Moreover, the to-go bag is also not user-friendly. I was given a transparent plastic bag to carry my leftovers, which made it slightly awkward. The waiter also forgot to give me napkins.

Our maki dinner consister of avocado roll, sweet potato tempura, shiitake tempura, griller asparagus and the moo. Avocado maki was like the regular, the tempuras were just awesome and moo is just out of the world. Moo is just how its described- its a full loaded maki that is big and makes a mouthful. And its just super awesome! We saved just about room for desserts since the description of Banana Maki intrigued us. Its one of the most uniquely created desserts that I have come across- hot fried pastry that has a piece of banana in it, served with cold vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.. mmmmm.. make sure you save room for this wonder!

I still prefer traditional but, now they have inserted an american flare (cream cheese) in my maki roll. I got sashimi. Hamachi tasted fresh and pieces were cut at a good size. Salmon also tatsed fresh. The Age dashi tofu tasted good.  Lychee sorbet was also delish but take a pass on mango sorbet. Great service, very polite and friendly. The place was packed but the server always checked on us. Will return if Iamin the South loop.",0.9744,0.786,0.194,0.02,0.5064285714285713
2012-03-18,5.0,"Ok, first of all I'd have to preface this with - omg this place is SO much better than Coast in Wicker Park!!!!!  Unbelievably fresh sushi!!!   We go here about once a week because we live not too far from it.  I absolutely love this place and it has not once disappointed me in any way (food, service, wait time, quality, etc.).  Now, here are some of my recommendations from the menu:  South Scallop roll - if you love scallop, this is a MUST for you!   White Dragon roll - really good, even though i don't usually like cream cheese in my sushi, this one is PRETTY good!  Angry Salmon - in appetizers - amazing!!!  for all salmon lovers - i HIGHLY recommend!!!! the soup, with the chicken - i always forget the name - but it is REALLY good.  it's not miso...but you will know when you look at the menu.   Salmon - maki, hand roll, nigiri, sashimi - in whatever form, every time i've ordered salmon from them, it has been so fresh, it knocked my socks off! ;) The other stuff is also very very good - the ones I've listed our just our favorites!  Please give it a try and don't discount it due to its location.  It is worth it!  The vibe is also very cool, it's half dim, so kind of romantic - but also good for groups of people. It's not uber expensive but kind of.  An average special roll there is $15, which I think isn't very bad, esp cuz they're very tasty!  Lots of meter parking outside, make reservations on weekends, this place gets packed!",0.9964,0.746,0.237,0.017,0.5829761904761903

I'm not a huge sushi eater, just to try somewhere different, we decided to check it out. The pleasant experience begins the second you walk in . BF and I both commented how nice the place *smells* inside....it was like a subtle watermelon or cucumber or flowery or something smell, but whatever it was, it was very nice (you certainly don't want to smell fish when you walk in a sushi joint). The decor is so inviting and nice to look at. This place has been feng shui-ed and yin/yan-ed so well that I could feel my Chi energized just by being there. We were led to the banquette seating, which I'm not a huge fan of, but there was such ample space between all the tables that it was totally comfortable (not sure if they put more tables in on the weekends, but it seems as though that could be possible). Service and food were impeccable throughout. We each started with a salad, the warm shrimp, and baby spinach. Both were fresh and excellent...the sesame dressing just lightly coating the spinach was just perfect, and the sweet corn tempura with the shrimp was a great combination. They have an extensive cocktail list, and I'm sure the drinks are great. We both got sparkling juice (pomegranate, and blood orange) along with some acai hot tea...all went nicely with the food. We got two maki rolls, the ""Tuna on Top"" (I think that's what it was called) was a special, and the Dragon Rock...both beautifully presented and delicious. There were a ton of other things on the menu that I wanted to try, but we decided on dessert instead. The Japanese ice cream sampler was way bigger than a ""sampling"" of ginger, green tea, and red bean ice creams, but rather full-sized scoops (who knew red bean was so tasty!). We got the Mochi as well, mango and chocolate...yum! I've never heard of Mochi but I loved them...little ice cream thingys encased in a rice flour coating (not a good description, but trust me, they are tasty and fun). Again, the service was perfect throughout, and plates were whisked away quickly (if not a bit overzealously, as we had to swat his hand away once, which I hate having to do), and water was filled continuously. So yeah, we were stuffed and totally impressed, and we will be back very soon.",0.9992,0.703,0.27,0.026,0.6449311171009283

Of course I can't compare South Coast to Tokyo but as one of the best sushi in Chicago I was expecting more.  The sushi rice was cold(like it was from the fridge) and the fish was not fresh. The worst part was none of the sushi chef was Japanese. They were actually speaking Vietnamese loudly to each other that I could hear them from across the room. If you know anything about sushi you don't eat it from Vietnamese. Just b/c they are Asian it doesn't mean they know sushi. Sushi is very delicate and it requires a lot of knowledge to make good and safe sushi to eat but if you just want some place to eat a slab of cream cheese on rice and thinks it's trendy to do so this is the place for you.

The food was incredibly appetizing (the kani ceviche was absolutely delicious.. but watch out for those chili slices for those who don't like super spicy ;-) ), and well plated. I've been there only a couple times so far, but what I've tried so far, I've really liked.  The decor was well done with dark colors and nice accent pieces, lending to a zen-like mellow ambiance. The service however was just ok. I've had both excellent waiters and little wait time, and rather slow service with waiters who didn't seem to keep an eye out for their customers. But overall, not a bad experience in terms of service. The desert was excellent! Of course, I've only tried one item, the chocolate dome.. which is not on their regular menu, but oh so good!

Since this place has opened, it's IMPROVED! I was nervous about their location, as a lot of South Loop restaurants have struggled since coming in...but this place seems to be quite popular, regardless of the day of week. This last visit, I noticed that the front had been turned into more of a lounge area...and with the cool white branch chandeliers, trendy wall art and comfy decor...if the food doesn't live up to the look, they'd have been in trouble.

2011-12-27,4.0,"I went to South Coast on a Wednesday night where I had prompt seating with ample room to move around.  I showed up about 30 minutes earlier than my date but they gave me my table right away anyway and I had a drink and read my book while I  waited.  The space is very beautiful with a minimalistic approach to elegance.  It's dark enough to make everyone appear a bit more sexy but not so dark that you can't see your food on the table or your dining partners across from you.  Ladies, you can feel totally comfortable putting on your night face for this dinner (no one wants to get caught in bright lighting with their night makeup on). The waiter was really attentive and knowledgeable without being overbearing.  He brought us out some complimentary appetizers while we were considering what to order and made some pretty decent recommendations.  I had the spicy miso soup to start which was every bit as good as the other reviewers have said.  Then we had the Dragon Rock, Salmon Poke, spicy tuna roll, the white tuna avo and a few individual pieces of sashimi.  Everything was really fresh and totally hit the spot for my sushi craving.  I probably could have used a dolly for my boyfriend to wheel me out to the car. The only thing negative is that I didn't find any of the sushi mind blowing or super memorable.  It was all very good and I devoured it but I didn't eat anything that made me have a foodgasm.  I am constantly in search of the foodgasm.  I'm hoping something on this menu has what it takes. The beers are all $5 and on Wednesday all of their cocktails are $7.  Dinner for two ended up around $70 with two drinks each which is really reasonable in comparison to what we've paid elsewhere.  The restaurant is very accessible by public transportation and has easy street parking for all of you drivers.

The sushi bar was a unique arrangement. 5 minutes turned into 45 minutes and we were still waiting for our table. Apparently the previous customers decided to take their time. Unfortunately we were in a rush and decided to order take out instead.

The salmon was fresh.  The sashimi platter had Salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and surf clam. They were delicious. Verdict: Although I didn't get to experience the food inside the restaurant.

Generally you'll find 2 people working the front desk who are always attentive and helpful. Their to-go bags have a cardboard liner in the bottom so your food lays flat. They also tape the bag shut, an extra step that does not go unnoticed. These may seem like small things but make a huge difference when carrying your food home. No spillage or bags tipping over on a rough turn. Also, they give you real chop sticks and not those crappy kind that split apart only to end up with wood shavings in your food. They even threw in an extra set for me knowing the food was for one person. The prices are a bit higher but I've never had anything bad from South Coast. My recent trip landed me the edamame, California king roll, and the popper roll. The California roll was loaded with so many tasty little things. The popper had a nice crunch to it and was a tiny bit spicy; something I really enjoyed. I'll stick with my to-go orders for now but would happily dine here.

They also serve fresh wasabi (not from the powder but I suppose it costs more so we went w/ the normal one) Pricing: rolls go for $9 to $12, a bit on the pricey side for your standard  makis but they are generous with the fish. I forgot to check the price on the sushi we had. They should really consider doing happy hour specials... Lastly for the ladies, the waitor is SUPER cute, I didn't want to be inappropriate and rude to my friend so I only stole glances off the corner of my eyes. yes a tad creepy but hey you'd be looking too ;)",0.9939,0.731,0.22,0.049,0.5649184149184149

2011-05-18,5.0,"South Coast Sushi Bar is every mouth's dream. I went to this place with someone from school a few weeks back and everything about this place is absolutely to die for. The decor is nice and modern - the chandeliers were especially interesting in that they were thee swirls of wood. The sushi station and bar were chic and unobtrusive and the dining area was spacious. Only complaint that the lights were a little dim for my taste, but it wasn't anything unmanageable. As for the food, everything was fabulous. We tried the tempura seaweed, which tasted loads better than it sounds. We also had the beef wrapped asparagus and it remains the best thing I've ever ate in my life. Hands down. Veggie tempura was solid and even featured corn, which turned out to be a lot better than I thought! Also, spicy miso soup is a must - the tofu is nice and tender and the briny soup had a perfect kick of heat. (So many appetizers - can you tell we were starving!?) As for the entree, I had the Ebi Tempura, which comes with shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, mayo, roe. I'm not such a huge fan of roe or avocado, so I got substitutions of cream cheese and extra cucumbers. Usually, I have to fight with the waitress about substitutions, but not here. It was absolutely fab. We also got an order of quail eggs, since I'd never had them before, and they were also quite good. For desert, mango and green tea mochi and chrysanthemum tea.

2011-05-04,2.0,"Meh. That what I thought after my dining experience with a hefty dent in my wallet. Believe me I do not mind shelling out some cash for a great meal but this meal was lacking in a few of most important departments: the food and the value. First of all, the stars are for the decor/vibe and the service. It's very zen, low lighting, organic looking fixtures, and larger than it looks. The service was friendly and casual, not too over-bearing, extremely accommodating. Now the not so fine aspects. We started with some appetizers: the hamachi carpaccio and the angry salmon. Neither were terribly offensive but neither delighted me. The carpaccio wasn't sliced very thin and the vinegar/jalapeño/lime bite, while I enjoyed, reminded me of a ceviche more than a carpaccio...and really masked the fish, and it was $13, which made me feel robbed. We got two rolls, one was downright horrible and the other was passable, but uninspired. Now the entree is what was inedible. I got the yakisoba, since their fish was not impressing me. It was awful, the flavor profile was greasy and off. My boyfriend said he could taste cinnamon or nutmeg, neither which belong and left a horrible taste in my mouth. It seemed very dark for a yakisoba and whatever liberal amount of a seasoning-that-didn't-belong was seeped into ever bite which infused every ingredient with it's pervasiveness. I ate a few bites and gave up. I kept hoping that my palate would adjust and I could find some redeeming quality to continue choking it down, I failed. I boxed it up and feigned fullness. My man got the salmon teriyaki, which was obviously farm raised and tasted boring. The drinks were strong...so that was good.  Overall, i live so close and so wanted to love south coast. Instead I felt burned and dissatisfied. I wouldn't recommend tarrying there again. Bleh...",-0.9785,0.747,0.091,0.162,0.5842746913580248

Love everything about South Coast Sushi, I have 2 other sushi places closer to my house and also make the 12 block walk south to South Coast. The sashimi platter is truly a treat and I have yet to have a bad meal.  Today was the first day with anything other than an excellent experience.  From the minute I walked in the door I could tell they were using an old mop / mop water and the restaurant had a lingering smell.  You would think they would notice and swifter the floors even when their are customers.  I worked in a restaurant for a number of years and managed a few as well.  I know it is a hard thing to break out a swifter or mop once customers are there. But if it was my first visit I may have never gone back.  Clean up your act... you deserve it. Oh don't be mad at your staff mr/ms manager this is your responsibility.

2011-03-01,3.0,"My husband and I went here for dinner a couple of days back. We'd like to give it a 3.5 stars but that's not possible on yelp. We didn't think it was 4 star quality so we'll just leave it as 3 stars for now. Don't think we'll go back again though.  Service was great. The waitress was friendly and ready to explain anything we didn't know. They cleared the plates really promptly too.  We ordered the Niku soup and Miso soup to start. The Niku soup's presentable was kinda impressive but the taste didn't match up. The soup was tasty but it was tasty in an MSG-laden kind of way. Niku soup should been infused with the taste of beef, but this wasn't so. It seemed like the taste was artificially enhanced. The handful of udon was nothing to rave about either. The beef wasn't well done - it was too tough and they didn't slice it thinly enough.  The miso soup was all right, but the tofu was too hard. The tofu should have the kind of texture such that it dissolves in your mouth. We had to chew this one.  Next, was Shiitake Mushroom tempura. The tempura bits given were miserable. This dish was a so-so as well.  The Philly mak however, was something different. We felt that the combination of avocado, smoked salmon and cheese was great. The taste of each food item did not interfere with the other in the palate.  The finale was their signature roll of South Scallops. I loved this although my husband did not. I thought the scallops were cooked very well - soft and yummy. And the dynamite roll sandwich was a quirky idea that paid off. Basically they had a jam of avocado and other stuff roll into a plain sushi and then they sandwiched the scallop in 2 rolls. Something like an oreo cookie.  By the way, just something to take note of, the size of the sushi were tiny as compared to the many other sushi restaurants we've come across.  OH, one thing I didn't really like about the restaurant was that it was so dark inside that we thought it was closed! Fortunately, we were sat at the counter where it was well illuminated. The rest of the restaurant was caped in darkness and I wonder how the other patrons actually see their food properly before they ate.

The fish was extremely fresh and clean. However, i was disappointed by their rolls. They were small, esp for specialty rolls. I also wished they offered more raw fish rolls like a volcano roll. Most of them were cooked.  Overall, i would prob not return bc its a bit pricey. $90 for two rolls, a sushi assortment, and two drinks isnt really worth it to me.

2010-09-08,4.0,"The vegetarian sushi is better than the traditional sushi. For me, this is dangerous when combined with their much-too-drinkable martinis, as I suddenly want to strip naked and roll around in the Moo Roll. (Stupid name, delicious flavor.) I'm happy to argue about why I still call myself a vegetarian when I eat shellfish, but not in this review, darling. Let's discuss over South Coast dinner. I really enjoyed the flavors of the tempura maki, particularly the incredible sweetness of the shitake and the crispy shell around the sweet potato maki; the mayo inside the maki is also delicious without being heavy handed.  You can tell the chefs care about their cuisine, and the servers are polite and attentive. This is exactly the kind of reasonably priced, beautifully executed food that South Loop needs. The only reason I knock off a star is the ambience: it was a little too close to a bad ""dining in the dark"" experience I had in LA, where bored wealthy yuppies paid a lot of money to eat things they couldn't see. A little more light, South Coast, and I might be able to read the menu without squinting when I'm searching for another martini. Wait, maybe the lighting *wasn't* the problem.

We arrived around 9:30 on a Saturday night. This section of Michigan Ave offers plenty of street parking which was a plus right off the bat. But when we pulled open the door and saw the stylish ambiance (dark brown walls, cool chandeliers, sushi counter in the back and windows that open to Michigan Ave) we were hooked.  We were promptly seated in a modern banquette along the wall opposite the bar. The menu has a wide range of items. Sushi, of course, but there were also cold and hot starters, salads, and entrees. There is also a separate list of their beers, wines and signature drinks.  Knowing that they close at 11, we quickly placed our order and waited for our feast to begin.  It started with complimentary tempura battered seaweed with two types of sauce. Perfect for munching on until our edamame showed up. I liked the serving dish for this- a classy two sided wood platter so much nicer than the ceramic bowl most places plop down.  And finally- the sushi. We ordered 3 of their signature rolls and one regular roll. They came, as expected, artfully arranged on a tray. Wow! Know before you go that their spicy items are just that . .SPICY! So much more than my regular sushi place. But delicious!  Service on this night was good - quite a feat given it was our server's first night on the job.

Although they are probably pricier, the sushi is one of the freshest I've had (but can't say that about the raw sweet shrimp which my hubby said was not as fresh). But this place is better and fresher than Oysy on Michigan Ave. The decor is darker than I would like but it is pretty hip and a little club like. Their lychee martini is strong but a bit on the sweet side. I got the niku udon soup which I like the presentation of it served on a very wide rimmed bowl/platter but the portion is like a cup and it tastes a bit like sukiyaki. It was good. I also got the sea bass with brown butter soy reduction and fried corn tempura/fritter accompaniment. I really liked that dish. We also got the spider roll which was good but the portion is smaller than other places for the price. My husband got the 12 piece sashimi but he said he actually got more than 12 pieces which was great. He said it was fresh! Our waiter was ok but seemed to be a little hard of hearing and we had to repeat ourselves a few times. For dessert we got the 3 scoop ice cream combo of Green tea, Ginger, and red bean. I liked the green tea ice cream the best out of the three. Overall it was really good but the bill for 2 with booze is a bit steep at $150 including tip.

It had been... gasp!... a good 6 months since I last had sushi. A food crime punishable by a tribunal somewhere, I'm sure! South Coast boasts an amazingly complete menu. Cold apps, hot apps, soup, salads, signature maki, entrees, desserts and an impressive cocktail and wine menu.  I started with the spicy miso soup. As I was eating it, I really exclaimed, ""THIS is the best miso I've ever had!"" The addition of jalapeno and a spicy broth made an old standby bold. For our other appetizers, we tried edamame, soft shell crab and the corny tuna. All delicious! I admit, it was really difficult settling on a few maki rolls. In a perfect world, I would've ordered 1 roll each among a dozen specialties, but 4 had to do. We ordered up a sushi storm including the White Dragon (by far, my favorite!), Spider, Negi Hamachi and the White Tuna Avocado. All delivered fresh, vibrant flavors. Tip: if you love Godzilla rolls elsewhere, the White Dragon is it! Service was friendly and efficient, and done with a smile. I can't wait to come back!

Also, I found the servers to be very professional, which is always a good thing.  We stuck to the nigiri and rolls and found them to be tasty. One thing that struck me was that (a) they didn't make them too massive as many other places do, and (b) they didn't over-embellish them by trying to pack in too many different ingredients, another common problem with some sushi places. I wouldn't say the fish was bland by any means, instead it was effective and simple, however none of it blew me away. Instead, we got what I consider to be fresh, subtle sushi, and that's by no means a bad thing. One thing I didn't particularly like was the way the unagi was positively swimming in sauce... that didn't sit well with the subtlety of the rest of the rolls and nigiri we'd chosen. Prices were quite high, the bill was a little 'up there' considering we didn't even have alcohol, but it seemed about on par with Oysy, though Oysy's rolls and nigiri pieces are a bit larger. However, I don't think the service or ambiance is as good at Oysy (which is not terrible by any means), even though I love their sushi.

Go figure for yourself. I came here with my friend after a rained out concert at Soldier Field. Needed a pick me up moment and what better way than to go blow $100 on sushi, right? This place was close by, and we needed a roof over our wet heads. After much hype from someone who works there, I finally caved in with high expectations as I always do. This place exceeded all of my high hopes and demands, and I am almost mad to have found such discovery because now my wallet will be broke because of it!  The lychee champagne drink kept me happy and sane on a gloomy rainy day. I told the waiter to keep them coming because I honestly was not going to get tired of it anytime soon. They gave us a complimentary appetizer which resembled something of thin, small, green tortilla chips with a spicy mayo dip. I'm sure I'm way off the actual ingredients but I was too hungry to remember the name of the dish. Nonetheless, it was so kind of them! We ordered the crunchy roll which was absolutely delightful! I couldn't get enough of them considering they were a tad small. We ordered a few other rolls that I couldn't remember and some sashami. It was the sashimi that made me realize how fresh their fish really is! The white tuna simply melted in my mouth and the salmon had me craving for more.

The interior space was amazing. In NYC, a place like this would be packed with tables to maximize profit. Here, the tables are nicely spaced apart and create just the right ambiance. The decor is just right, interesting, subdued, and modern. I have a thing for unfinished / industrial spaces. We ordered some good sake, and the one complaint I had was that when I said the name of the sake, the server kind of repeated it, wrong, and joked ""... or however it's pronounced"", and told me it was enough for two people. It was a standard 180ml bottle (not enough for two people), and his comment on the name just kind of rubbed me the wrong way. At a place like this with prices like this, you should be professional 100% of the time and know your product. However, for the rest of the night, he was great. Attentive, refilling our sake and water glasses, and on point.  We ordered a bunch of sushi and some rolls. I would go out on a limb and say this fish was the freshest, highest quality I have ever had. It literally melted in my mouth. As another reviewer mentioned they don't overuse the rice. It's just a little ball for sweetness underneath the fish. Great technique. The sushi chefs were great, leaning over the counter to see what we'd eaten and how we liked it. I asked the one in front of us how the uni was and with a big grin gave a thumbs up, so I had to try it. Delicious. I can go on and on, but you get the point.

2009-09-29,3.0,"Really 3.5 stars but I could not find the half mark.  Good solid sushi, good solid menu for both sushi as well as sake. But I am a sushi snob and tend to like quality over quantity and I while I will eat any good sushi, I would only rave about great sushi.  This sushi is like, no hana, akihana, oysi and many other main stream sushi.  By  way of comparison 5 stars for me would be eating at NOBU off his omikashi menu or eating at L2O here in Chicago or Japanase here in Chicago.  HERE IS FIVE STARS TO ME:  FISH:  It goes without saying that top sushi is fresh fresh fresh. A good indicator of whether a place has FRESH fish is to order a single nigiri piece of snapper. Snapper tends to get chewy and rubbery before any other more robust fish like salmon or tuna and it also tends to be used less often and so is a good gage of the turn over on the stock in the resturant. If the snapper is chewy leave. If it melts in your mouth - stay.  Ask the chef what he believes are his ""best cuts"" for the day - never imply that something is not fresh. If you think it is not fresh just leave.  By the way any place that precuts the fish before marrying it to the rice is an instant 4 star or below no matter how good their fish and rice. Cutting the fish in advance starts the oxidation process so beware.  TEMPERATURE: This demonstrates if the chef a) knows what he is doing, b) is the one running the show as opposed to corporate, and c) demonstrates a very good turn over of fish.  I am looking for sushi no colder than 65 degrees and rice no hotter than 75 degrees.  Where the warmth of the rice is just enough to bring out the oil in the fish which was recently refrigerated and the fish is so fresh that it melts in your mouth.  Another way of putting it is that the temperature at the time you eat the fish should be around room temperature.  CUT: The cut of the fish should be small - not these gapping slabs of fish which americanized sushi resturants pump out to please the masses. A good sushi chef will not cater to the customer but will make the customer recognize his talent.  Or as I have heard it from inovative chefs before the customer must submit to the food not the other way around.  RICE: Probably the most important characteristic for great sushi and most overlooked by americans looking for slabs of fish on a dot of rice.  Assuming the freshness, temperature and cut of the fish are all present, now comes the aspect of nigiri that seperates the men from the boys.  The rice should be seasoned with the right balance of vinegar, mirin, sugar, and sake. Yes, these are all standards with good rice.  The word sushi means vinegared rice and it is the rice that really makes the differnce if you assume that the fish is super fresh and the chef knows how to cut the fish and keep it at the correct temperature before serving it. That is what to me means 4.5 stars. To get to the last level, one has to be inovative with the nigiri. I have seen it at Nobu, I have seen it with Mike who works at Oyse on Michigan Avenue, I have seen it with some chefs at Japanese. Basically with all the above taken care of, the chef departs from the familiar and adds a twist to his nigiri.  Say for example white truffle oil on the maguro. Minced msuhrooms on Toro. chopped shaved fennel soaked in lemon atop fresh salmon. I have several dozen more equally interesting example.   Inovative rolls are nice, but once you have had the roll, you can always go to your favorite sushi place and have them whip up the same combo. To me Nigiri is the measure of a great sushi place.  This fish earns 3.5 because while it does have inovative rolls, the chefs in the back are not inovative on the nigiri and the fish seems a bit cold and the cuts are a big large. As for rice, it is 7 out of 10 but not the best I have had.  Finally as an aside, I await the return of a long missing star on the sushi scene, the one who trained all the best chefs in chicago, ITO SAN who used to work at many of the different places I have seen over the years. His reliability was laking and I am sure he was difficult to work with - but man what a genius with a knife and maintaing super quality where he worked.",0.9991,0.771,0.179,0.05,0.4644402673350041

2009-08-12,4.0,"If you're not in the neighborhood even denizens of the West Loop might find it a bit of a trek to get to South Coast Sushi at 1700 S Michigan, but I have a feeling the South Loop people are just fine with those that give up or deem it too far to travel. This huge sushi house is a jewel in the neighborhood touted as such mostly for the room, the décor and the outstanding service. Despite the challenges of walking there and finally giving in and getting a cab, the cab driver wasn't even sure where it was despite my giving him an exacting address. My poor date: we sent text messages back and forth and the last was that she would be standing outside the restaurant with cash in hand to throw at the cabbie. She was able to keep her money though as the cab had to come to a screeching halt half way down the block past the restaurant. Amazing, we were still on time. Then I found out we didn't have a reservation because as my date put it ""It's never busy, plus, it's Tuesday"". Anyone who read my reviews last year knows that I am a Tuesday through Thursday diner. This was fine with me. Our waiter approached us within moments and we mulled over the drinks menu looking for sake. I'm not a sake pro, but I know what I like. After the bill came later and it was revealed that we only barely went over $100 because of the 2nd bottle, I knew it couldn't have been that expensive, but it was my taste buds earlier that had pegged it. I'd had better sake at Japonais (especially) and Mirai. Granted, I never saw the menu and it was really between my date and the waiter that the choice was made. In any event, it was drinkable, but I wouldn't say it complimented the sushi. The waiter made some recommendations for dinner, including a tasting menu, a 3 course dinner menu and any number of specials. Oh, and don't forget the Rib Eye special! Dude! We're here for sushi and you're not dealing with amateurs. Give the rib eye to the underweight hostess and bring us the sake! So he did, and a nice Amuse Bouche that made us kinda want a whole evening of chef-inspired nibbles.  We started with the Angry Salmon appetizer which was maybe a bit too spicy if you're going to head into mild nigiri and sashimi soon after. My lips were set alit and my tongue was tingling, sensations I covet, but not before Super White or Maguro. We contemplated the Hamachi Carppacio, but were tempted by the Fatty Hamachi that was available, so we went with the fat. Nigiri were built with fresh fish exactly as they should be: long lardon of fish under a small sushi meshi ball. Most of the fish was consumed without soy sauce because it didn't need it, but most of the better-than-most ginger was used to clean palates and enjoy on its own. One overly ambitious busboy swept a plate still piled high with a ginger rose, but our gasps brought him back immediately. At last! A busboy who understands the nuance of a gasp! Our poor waiter. We let him know right away he wasn't dealing with amateurs, but we aren't snobs either. We really put him through his paces and he met every order, suggestions and directive in a professional and timely manner, e.g.: A 2nd order of Super White was deftly decorated with an impossibly thin slice of lemon ... on our recommendation ... and I touted the unadvertised House Special Maki has ""having possibilities"". The room is huge and beautiful and thoughtfully decorated with modern flourish. The front third of the restaurant is tables, the middle is bisected by a hard bench with throw pillows and more tables and the sushi bar fill the back third. We sat at a table with the bench which itself is high and hard. Overly-exuberant diners might find themselves knocking their head on it from time to time, but there is no doubt it as beautiful as the dark wood chairs.  Most of the patrons were very casually dressed. I think the South Loop is inhabited by lots of younger folks and the college crowd, so there were plenty of people in jeans and t-shirts. You can dress up if you want to without any issues of looking out of place. I will say that I found the prices to be comparable and even on the lower end of my usual sushi places. Not sure if other reviewers don't inhale plate after plate and imbibe drink after drink like I do, but a bill for 2 just over $100 is a bargain in my book. If specials and special requests didn't drive the bill sky high.  Mad props to our server and the staff! The service was really the highlight of the evening, but I'll also go back for more sushi, people watching and design tips.",0.9962,0.818,0.126,0.056,0.4823295454545453

Not many sushi places offer free appetizers but South Coast does!  They bring out seaweed that is coated in tempura and fried and serve it with two sauces.  One is ginger based and the other was wasabi based.  Both were excellent!

Have been to Coast in bucktown a few times, closer to where I live, but I tend to stay away b/c of the crowds - just too much...Here I would go back in a heart beat, however. I really like the setup - place is very well put together, very cool, and you can actually hear the other people at your table. Service was very good last night. Shared the tuna carpaccio (excellent), shrimp dumplings (good, nothign special), and salad (always consistent), and my mom had the seafood soup which she really liked. Compimentary seaweed tempura with dipping sauces was a nice offer to start. Fish was great - I am more a nigiri man myself, though can enjoy some maki. For me the true test is a good piece of nigiri/sashimi, and they passed on all fronts. The banana maki to top it off left half our table speechless (or just numb to its goodness).

For starters, I love the decor, and if I could redo my apartment, I think I'd borrow from their interior.  Low lighting, great wall prints...just a very cool looking place to relax.  Also, their lychee martini is pretty fantastic, which may or may not add to the enjoyment. Coast, and South Coast, have fantastic, fresh sushi.  I always lean towards more of a tuna-based roll, so their selection is fantastic.  My old favorites are the Volcano roll (spicy, spicy tuna with some roe and tempura crumbs on top) and the Crunchy (tuna, cucumber, tempura).  The South Scallop is probably the best scallop I have ever consumed (literally melts in your mouth), but for $13 for 4, it's not an every day thing for me.  Also, recently ordered the White Dragon, which is pretty fantastic.  The sashimi/nigiri is fantastic - I have a weakness for the super white tuna (though, if you wikipedia it, you'll learn not to have too much of it...eek!) and other forms of tuna selections.   And, of course, any meal that ends with mochi (at least 6 flavors to pick from) can't be that bad.",0.9948,0.746,0.229,0.025,0.5742528735632184

We started with a lychee drink each - both good.  My friend's lychee martini was very good, sweet but strong.  My sparkling lychee was easy to down too, and I enjoyed the prosecco in it.  Drinks are $10-12 each. We ordered a few apps to share.  The edamame was normal as was the cucumber salad.  The crab cakes wrapped in fried wonton wrapper were really good - delicious spicy dipping sauce, flaky flavourful meat.  Quite expensive at $16 (this translated to $4 per wonton). The menu is pretty extensive, with a nice assortment of regular and special rolls.  The a la carte nigiri was really expensive and each order ($4-$7) comes with only once piece of sushi, not 2 like most restaurants.  Taking that into account, I decided on the sashimi entree and my friend ordered the spicy California, vegetable tempura roll, and the sweet potato roll.  The sashimi entree was nicely presented and had a decent amout of fish for $24.  I tried a piece of each roll and found the fried one awesome, but I'm a huge sucker for fried foods.  The spicy California was not at all spicy, and I have a personal bias against avocado in sushi. Though full, we decided to split the banana maki for dessert.  Great choice!  Fried (yay!) banana drizzled with hot chocolate sauce and served with creamy vanilla ice cream.  I think this was the definite winner of the night and worth all the extra calories. So how did the bill come out to $140?  I think all the little things added up.  They charged us $3 for my tea, $2 for fresh-ground wasabi, $2 for extra ginger sauce (requested for the spicy California roll that wasn't spicy!).  These things are usually free at most Japanese restaurants.  Just a horrible value proposition all around.  To be fair, they do have a $35 set menu on Tuesdays which MIGHT be worth a shot, though I'm convinced some sneaky little extras will pop up on the bill. I don't think I will come again, especially during a recession.  The next time I eat Japanese, it'll be ramen.  From my kitchen cabinet.",0.9978,0.712,0.226,0.062,0.5751817796715757

California King roll: I think the extra ingredient was tempura and maybe some extra green vegetable, but other than being larger, did not taste significantly different from ordinary California roll. South Scallop roll: Only 4 pieces, granted each came with a large raw scallop.  Had some special mayonnaise and seemed partially baked.  A pleasant, novel taste.

As far as the sushi goes, it is definitely one of the most delicious in the city (and trust me, I eat sushi approx. 1-2 times a week, its delish!) - I'd definitely recomment the salmon avacado roll (the salmon literally melts in your mouth!) and the Mexican roll - two of my favorites!!!!",0.9921,0.731,0.269,0.0,0.637202380952381

Freshness and cut is everything when it comes to sashimi. So, that dish alone is ok. But, the portion is rather small for the price charged. 3 thin slices for $8. For the entree, it uses a few combination of techniques. Sea bass is nicely cooked. But flavor is very simple. Again, the portion is rather small. I still feel hungry after the meal.

The table spilt an order of edamame and we each had miso soup.  After our standard teaser we got down to business by ordering 8 rolls, 11 pieces of nigiri, and 8 pieces of sashimi for the table.  That sounds like enough food right? Wrong!  I will admit we are big eaters (not Audrey), but 2 rolls per person plus, edamame, plus miso, plus pieces should get your tummy full.  What really disappointed me was that all of the specialty rolls were very small. ""Specialty Roll"" means two things to me: 1. The roll is special (Duh!). 2. The roll is large. South Coast nailed #1, but failed miserably on #2.  I'm sorry, but I'm looking for mouth busting pieces out of a $13 roll. Okay, enough on that rant. Aside from their itsy bitsy-ness all of the rolls were yummy. The standouts were the Spring Roll, Volcano Roll, and the Coast Crab.  All of the pieces were extremely fresh and tasty as well.  At the end of our meal both Mike and I need to reorder. The interior is warm, modern, and open.  However, I'm beginning to get the feeling that would be sushi restaurateurs are all buying the same ""Instant Sushi Restaurant Design in a Box"" kit.  Don't they all look the same?   I do love that fact that every table isn't sandwiched between another.  Our server was great and overall the service has always been on point.   All in all a good experience.  However, I think Coast needs to care less about their margins and more about their patrons tummys. 9 rolls 12 pieces of nigiri 8 pieces of sushi 1 edamame 4 miso soups 1 corkage ------------------------------- $210.00",0.9776,0.813,0.129,0.058,0.4680605158730158

Coast gives reservations for 50% of the space, and saves the other half for walk-in diners. I highly recommend making a reservation or arriving before the dinner rush. Otherwise it may be difficult to get a table. S. Coast's menu is similar to that of Coast, except while Coast has a rotation of special menu items, S. Coast has these items available on their regular menu. Bonus star for S. Coast.  I highly recommend the Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Ebi Tempura, and Volcano maki. For nigiri or sashimi, I had the albacore, tako, and unagi and they were all fresh and flavorful. Finally, I love the gomaae (boiled spinach with sesame sauce) for an appetizer, and the mochi for desert. Also, definitely get some of their fresh wasabi. It's well worth the $2 and you'll never eat regular wasabi again! One thing that drives me nuts: there is a $5 corkage fee for each bottle of wine, and unlike Coast, they do not waive it even if you spend a lot of money on dinner. Maybe I'm just picky, but if my party is going to spend $200 on dinner, the least the restaurant can do is waive the corkage fee.",0.9632,0.858,0.127,0.014,0.44099655246714065

The atmosphere was really nice.  The lighting was pretty cool and I like the chairs they have.  The staff was nice but a little overbearing.  Maybe it was because they were dead and there were twice as many staff as customers.   The BYOB is a bit misleading.  I think it is BS to be BYOB and still charge a $5 corkage fee and a fee for bringing your own can of Sapporo.  I thought that was disingenuous.

We had to have the banana maki based on all the reviews here, and it did not disappoint.  It wasn't super fancy, but it was delicious. They had toro (fatty tuna), which my fiancee loves, but not many places have.  It was amazing. Definitely worth going back.",0.9845,0.635,0.294,0.071,0.7207738095238095

I didn't understand why there was a fee for something that didn't need her service. It's not like she needed to open the bottle for us or anything like that. I thought corkage fee was for service and also for lost revenue for not selling a drink from their list. They don't have a liquor license, so obviously there is no drink list. Why should they make money off of the fact that they don't have a liquor license? Furthermore there was no uncorking service. We left before even eating.

2007-10-14,5.0,"We had a fabulous meal at South Coast a couple weeks ago when visiting Chicago for a conference. It was a looong day, and we thought sushi would be a good reward. We walked up from the conference center, looked horrible, had our bags of conference crap, no reservations - and they were happy to seat us, and did so right away. Score. First of all, the service was fabulous. Very attentive but not overly so, the waitress came right when she was needed, and all of our food was timed perfectly. And the water - oh my god my water never made it under 1/4 empty (I mean 3/4 full I guess). Seriously - I love water, and he filled the glass constantly. It was kind of funny - I'd drink a few sips and would say ""I'll get more water any second now"", and was not disappointed. Anyway, the food was excellent, and a couple of things were rather amazing.  Appetizer - Miso tuna. Seared tuna with red miso and this carrot stuff on top. The carrots were the stand-out part (and this is not due to the tuna not being great... it was. It was just those carrots were freaking amazing). I've never had anything like those carrots, and when you dip them a bit in the vinegary dressing they were like heaven. And I never use that word usually because it sounds so lame. But they were amazing. A couple weeks later and I totally remember those darn things. 5/5. Rolls:  Crispy - a unique roll that was very enjoyable, particularly due to the crispy bits on top and Spring - mint and the soybean paper on the outside made this one really nice an unique.  Moo - our favorite roll of the lot. Especially the end pieces where the rice seemed to almost melt into everything else, and it was just this amazing taste. Not my favorite roll of all time (that currently goes to Futo Krispy from Moshi Moshi in SF), but those end pieces come pretty damn close.  Husband also had one with salmon and cream cheese - only tasted one piece, but it was super-fresh and tasty. Very light on the cream cheese, but I was OK with this. Sashimi taster: Good, but definitely overpriced. The fish was fresh (not the freshest I've had, but definitely fine) and very tasty, but only 6 pieces that weren't huge... so it felt very expensive for what we got.   I had the iced green tea, which was very tasty with some splenda. All in all, a very fine meal with excellent service. Atmosphere was great - the restaurant is beautiful (of particular note were beautiful and really unique chandeliers, woodbeams on the ceiling, and a great color use in general). It was very expensive for the two of us ($44 each), thank goodness for a per diem.",0.999,0.713,0.24,0.047,0.6794295634920632

We got about 4-6 rolls and shared the different kinds. Had leftovers to take home...which I don't know how to feel about leftover sushi. I ended up getting rid of it cause it had sat in the car anyhow! I also really liked the Philly Roll, and Seaweed Salad. If you like spicy I recommend the Angry Salmon...very tasty and very spicy (for me anyhow)!

We were served at the bar just as if we were at a table, which was odd. The place seems to have become a bit pretentious since they got their liquor license. There was still one or two open tables byt the time we left, which means they don't know how to manage their reservations. I guess next time we'll make a reservation.

It was a little much, but shouldn't really complain.) Waitress was pleasant and made good recommendations.

Also doesn't hurt that I live across the street :) Definitely a more intimate feel (dark decor and low lighting) than most South Loop locations. Reminded me of the vibe in Gioco, actually. They have glass doors all along the front that have been mostly wide open during the warmer weather, which at least gives you a inside/out dining feel. The sushi was excellent, actually a little better from memory than their big brother Coast up north. The Hamachi and Super White Tuna are must-trys.
