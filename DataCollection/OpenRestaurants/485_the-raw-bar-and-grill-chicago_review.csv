What is going on with this place. Why not change the name if you don't have seafood? It's basically a bar menu. I ordered crabcakes, which were horrible. My kids had burgers, which they loved, but...they're kids, give 'em a burger, they're happy. The website even shows the old menu. Stay away from this place.

2017-01-06,1.0,"Shady, shady, shady!! I've only been here twice, but my second experience ensured I will never, ever, ever go back. The first experience wasn't memorable. My friend and I had a quick drink while we were waiting for a table at another restaurant in the area. The second experience was the night of the 2016 World Series and the Cubs' amazing victory.  Wrigleyville was obviously insane, but my friends and I wanted to be near the field for this historic event. We arrived early, however, all bars in the area were either already at capacity or had huge lines. Most places were charging a cover, which we expected. Raw Bar didn't have a line and had plenty of space. When I asked the guy at the door if there was a cover, he said, ""not now."" Throughout the series, I'd heard stories about Wrigleyville bars starting to charge cover as the game progressed and even increasing the cover as space became limited. My two girlfriends and I sat at a table and ordered food and beers. An hour after we sat down, my friend's husband came to join us. He was asked for a $50 cover at the door, paid it, and sat down with us. We heard a commotion in the other room and learned that the owner/manager was going around to everyone already in the bar and demanding a $50 cover. People were understandably outraged. At that point in the night, the game had already started and there's no way anyone was getting a spot anywhere else. Our options were basically pay $50 or have no where to watch the game. Which, I'm sure, was their strategy. If they had been upfront about it and asked us all for a cover at the door, it would have been fine. But asking for it after the fact is completely insane and downright unethical. I will never patronize this place again.",-0.8996,0.846,0.059,0.095,0.4953030840127615

They were not charging cover when we got in at 4pm but because they started charging cover sometime after that they decided they could just tack on cover charge to everyone who had a bar tab open, pretty easy to do when you ask for a credit card to start the tab. 45 minutes before game time, we paid for our drinks and left. greedy and misleading. all those people are going to be surprised at the end of the night with the added cover charge to their tab.

A friend and I walked in around 6:45, and were greeted by a host/barback/manager who seemed overwhelmed by the number of people in the restaurant.  He informed us that it would be at least a 25 minute wait, but his tone almost insinuated that we should've known better than to walk in, and that our presence was a direct affront to him. We sat at the bar to wait for out table, and the bartender was nice enough.  We ordered a Green Line draft and a Knob Creek old fashion.  The drinks were good, but at 20 dollars were slightly over-priced, even for the neighborhood.   We were seated in about ten minutes, and had to wait another 10 minutes before being greeted by a server who was clearly in over his head.  My friend was in the bathroom when the server came and I didn't know what he wanted to eat, so I ordered a dozen blue point oysters, which I was informed they were out of.  So instead we ordered half a dozen each of the two oysters they carried.  There was a slight language barrier with the server, so our communication was a little strained.   My concerns about the server being overwhelmed were confirmed when it turned out he wasn't supposed to pick up our table in the first place; the manager on duty questioned him on why he picked it up, and the server whose section we were in came over to take our order and seemed surprised when I told him we had already been helped.   When the oysters finally came, we tried to place our entree orders and were straight up told we couldn't.  The server had other things to do, and asked if we could wait 8 minutes before ordering.  At the point, based on the quality of the oysters, we decided to just ask for our bill and pick up some sandwiches down the street; we were in a rush, and might have stuck around if we hadn't been.   The reviews I've read of this place really indicate that our experience was atypical, and I know that when there are large events around a restaurant, it's unfair to judge the restaurant based on them.  I'm giving this place three stars because it was cute, half of our staff experiences were ok, and I do want to get back and try it on a slower night.",0.9813,0.865,0.105,0.03,0.4598338293650794

I felt sick later on from the oysters I assume so I probably wouldn't return unless the quality of the food(especially the raw) options is improved.

Unfortunately, they didn't even have the types of oysters that were listed on the menu, but since I have had the types they did have I went ahead and ordered a second dozen because the server said they were $11/doz. When the oysters finally came they were pretty dry, and weren't separated from the bottom shell like most places that specialize in raw oysters. The worst part was that when the check came, the oysters were $22/doz despite the fact that the server said otherwise when we ordered (the menu just says market price).    When I asked him why the price was different, he essentially said I was lying and he wouldn't ever say that.  My girlfriend who was with me heard the same price I did. To summarize, lied to about the server by the price, mediocre oysters, and poor service.  We won't be back.",-0.8047,0.827,0.076,0.097,0.6292521367521368

My husband returned his rare steak because it was not rare it was well done and they returned it covered in more sauce and raw, so either the chef is an idiot and thinks we know nothing about food or it was like out of the movie Waiting, and they were like, ""I'll give you rare!""

Our server was truly apologetic but nonetheless, my galentines and I had a fabulous meal here and we still got our oysters and cocktails. I ordered the Pomegranate cocktail which was delicious and my friend ordered the chocolate martini. Both are $11.00 so if you do use the groupon deal, you basically get a free dozen oysters ([$11/cocktail] x2 + oysters on the half shell). After fresh bread sticks, olive oil and parm were placed on our table, we ordered half Blue Point and half Naked Cowboys and they were as fresh as you can get being in the Midwest. They were served with sides cocktail sauce, lemon, slivers of ginger, Tabasco sauce and crackers. These were one of the highlights of the evening. For a party of three, we ordered a variety of tapas and specials. We got the crab cake ($8.00), a pasta special with white wine and garlic sauce tossed with shrimp, squid, mussels and topped with a red heart-shaped pasta. We also ordered a creamy shrimp, squid and scallop risotto which was divinely rich and also topped with several heart-shaped pastas.  Live music started at 7pm and the relaxed ambiance with candles and low lighting reminded me of a Nawlins' jazz club.

He could tell we were all dressed up and pretty disappointed (we were celebrating a birthday). He told us to hold on a moment and came back out with another employee, Tony (Owner/Manager?) who ushered us in and sat us at a table. He told us that our server, Andy would be with us momentarily.  Andy came over and told us about the menu specials and wine & drink specials. It was half off bottles of wine and we ordered a malbec which was amazing and complimented the food quite well. The menu consists mostly of seafood so I'm assuming this is their specialty. Unfortunately I don't eat seafood so I can't comment on it but my dinner companions seemed to absolutely love it. They had oyster shots, frog legs and fish dinners.  I shared the following with another diner and absolutely enjoyed every bit of it.  Appetizer: Cheese Ravioli - This was perfect for two people to share. There were a total of four ravioli and had plenty of marinara. Even enough for us to use the complimentary bread to finish it with. Baba Ghannouj - It should be noted that we did not order this. The aforementioned employee (Tony) brought it over to us before dinner arrived as a courtesy. This appetizer was made fresh with smoked eggplant, tahini sauce, garlic, parsley and fresh lemon juice and was served with sliced pita bread. It was some of the best baba ghannouj I've had in the city. Dinner: Egyptian Chicken with Dill Rice - This was also shared. We told Andy we were going to share it and he had the kitchen split it on two plates without us even asking. Great service for sure. This dish came with grilled red and green peppers and tomatoes. The dill rice was terrific and the Chicken was AMAZING! Cooked perfectly, it was tender and juicy but the flavor was what made this dish. I'm no foodie so all I can really say is it had a lemony type flavor and was perfectly seasoned. We ended up having a few bottles of wine and after we were offered dessert and had to turn it down, Andy brought a cordial of Cuarenta Y Tres for the birthday boy.

2014-04-20,1.0,"Our party of 6 had dinner at Raw Bar & Grill on a Saturday evening. The only reason this restaurant has 1 star is because those of us who had the seafood dishes (priced $10-20) thought the food was good. How did  Raw Bar lose the other 4 stars? Let me count the ways... 1. The drinks are extremely overpriced. A pint of 312 cost $7.  2. Although the restaurant was mostly empty, we were seated at a small table with barely enough space for 6 people. 3. Our server provided the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant. A) After we ordered appetizers, our waitress tried to take all of the menus except one, even though we were still considering our entrees. B) On that note, she generally kept trying to clear food and drinks off our table before we were done with them. C) A friend ordered filet mignon and got prime rib. When he told our waitress about the mistake, in response she opened her notepad and showed him that she had written down ""prime rib,"" thus ""proving"" that she was right and he was wrong. Regardless of the cut of beef, she never asked how he wanted it cooked, resulting in my friend being the unhappy recipient of a well done steak. D) Another friend ordered a burger that was overcooked; he asked for it medium rare, and it came well done. E) I ordered a side of steamed broccoli for my mahi mahi. Our server responds, ""Ok, Persian Salad."" Confused, I asked whether the Persian Salad could be an option as a side, despite it not being listed as one on the menu. She said yes, so I asked for the Persian Salad instead. Later, she brought a bowl of Persian Salad. I said I thought it was going to be the side to my mahi mahi. She replied that my side was steamed broccoli. We kept the Persian Salad as an additional appetizer, but it was mediocre, and in retrospect I should have sent it back. F) Full disclosure, English was obviously not this server's first language, but even so she clearly didn't take the time to listen carefully to our requests and questions, and she was astonishingly difficult about admitting to and correcting her mistakes.

In another case, the prime rib was perfectly flavored and had an amazing sauce but it came out medium well when ordered flat-out rare. The thing is, the food really did taste great, in all. Additionally, the service was very good and they really went out of their way to make sure things were going to be well-liked. Special requests were handled with aplomb. I went to Raw Bar because I had a voucher. Unfortunately, they served us drinks that were not exactly included without mentioning that and we had to pay extra. I think that was a bit of a cheap shot on their part. Finally, it seems the drink prices on the menu are not exactly the prices being charged. ($10 for a glass of very moderate to crappy wine? I wouldn't have ordered it if that's what the menu said...) I don't think I'll be back, unfortunately, unless an AMAZING deal presents itself.",0.991,0.725,0.204,0.071,0.6382380582380582

The pieces were, as our server called them, cheerio sized and so rubbery it was like chewing gum, there was no seasoning in the fry batter and after two pieces we had to say no more.   The worst part was when we asked them to take it back they refused to take it off of the bill and instead of asking just brought us out another batch 20 or so mins later, that's pretty shitty management in my opinion.  I will never go back to this place and would not recommend it to any of my friends/family.  The staff was friendly and I wish them the best because of the food is always prepared like that there's no way they will remain to stay in business.",0.6475,0.729,0.142,0.129,0.4482342219184325

2013-10-21,4.0,"Ok, so I'm going to make you understand why this place has mixed reviews. But first off, I'm a fan.  So with that being said: 1) The outside doesn't match the inside.  It looks like a bar in wrigley, which, it is, sorta.  The inside back area looks like they're trying to be a ""fine dining"" restaurant.  Which I guess is a bit odd, because from the front it looks like a bar.  I wouldn't want to hang out in the front unless I was just going there for cocktails, the waitress seems bored and stares at people and the servers kinda hang around that area.  The entrance into the dining room ....WATCH YOUR STEP! Especially if you're wearing heels, its dark and its carpeted, so you think it's smooth, but it's bumpy and slopes down.  I'm sure some people have buckled a knee or something walking in.  Not a good start! 2) Some of the appetizers are small and overpriced.  Example: The cajun shrimp appetizer, $9.00... for THREE shrimp on top of about 3 tablespoons of guacamole with a handful or so of chips... they should call it guacamole with shrimp garnish. LOL. But that shrimp was good... it should be closer to $5. 3) The oysters are super fresh and their cocktail sauce is awesome.  I come here almost specifically for the raw oysters.  I get the big ones (cowboy they're called).   4) The wines are good, but they're not heavy handed at all on the pour.  So if you're going to each have more than one, go for a bottle cuz it's the same price as 4 glasses. 5) The servers are either new or have been there too long and it shows.   6) They offer groupons... ALOT... probably because of their decor and location.  I've used a groupon both times, but I've been very satisfied, and FULL from the food.  So it's a win-win for me. 7) Try the Blackened ostrich.  It's really good and tastes like steak.   The caesar salad is really good, but slightly overdressed.  The crawfish soup was amazing and creamy, more like a bisque.  Stay away from the grilled, octopus... the outside was soft and the inside too chewy, a sure sign it  was both frozen and overcooked.  Besides, that, I can't complain and if you're here, order the right items, and sit in the back, you shouldn't be disappointed. :)",0.9968,0.81,0.172,0.017,0.5107007333751521

2013-02-24,3.0,"I have been meaning to try Raw Bar for quite sometime and our soon to be expiring groupon finally got the boyfriend and I out to Wrigleyville for a very nice and relatively romantic dinner.   The groupon was for 1.5lbs of maine lobster and 2 glasses of champagne for 2. I of course drank both the champagne and boyfriend had a couple Green Line Taps.  The staff was exceptionally nice and attentive, our server, who I am assuming was the manager or owner took very good care of us. I don't often feel special at a restaurant but I felt very welcome at Raw Bar. It was probably an unusually slow night for a Friday in Wrigley but it was pretty cold out and we just had about 5 or 6 inches of fresh snow the night before. It meant no waiting for us so that was a plus, I was happy to see the place fill up when we were leaving around 8:30. We ordered their special, margarita ceviche and their little neck steamers to accompany our lobster, which we ordered cajun & steamed style. I was going to order the lobster just steamed because cajun sounds strange for lobster but the owner/manager man assured us cajun was the best option and just made the lobster garlicy and delicious. He was right and we really enjoyed our lobster. I thought everything was really good, the ceviche was especially enjoyable with shrimp, scallop, octopus, avocado and red onion, chips to eat it with, yum! The little neck steamers were pretty tasty in a garlic and wine broth. The lobster was a nice treat since I never eat it, it was one tail split in half for you. The boyfriend extracted the tail for me and cracked the claw. I really enjoyed it, doused in butter.  I really cannot say if this is the best seafood around, surely it is not. But for being trapped in the midwest in the middle of winter I really enjoyed what I ate. Everything tasted and seemed fresh but I know if I went to the east coast tomorrow for some lobster I would probably cry for what I could be eating.  That aside, we had a nice cozy and romantic dinner with really friendly service and a good meal. I will say this place is probably ludicrously expensive however. The meal was a $120 something dollars before the groupon was applied. That's kind of absurd. We had 3 beers, 2 glasses of champagne (included in the groupon) 1 glass of wine, ceviche, steamers, lobster (included in the groupon) and 1 dessert. Thankfully our groupon took $60 bucks off the bill, but thats crazy! If I'm going to spend $120 I'm going to Carnivale or Chef's Station in Evanston or some other fabulous steak house in downtown Chicago. Don't get me wrong, the meal was good but this isn't a 5 star restaurant, it's a bar in Wrigley that happens to be charming enough to be romantic. What's my point here? I'm glad I tried it and had a great meal but I'm more glad that I had a groupon to ease the pain of receiving the bill. Probably cannot justify spending that kind of money unless I am in a super fancy restaurant in the future.",0.9993,0.71,0.248,0.042,0.6533421405552553
2013-02-21,1.0,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! I would never ever go back there, and I really think no one else should go there. So, my boyfriend and I went there with this groupon. We had no idea what this place is or where it is, but we decided to give it a try, because I am a huge fan of oysters and I can't get enough of them in Chicago. The ambiance is: Below mediocre. There is a terrible smell (much like a urine smell) in the room, and the decor is just bad-there are plastic skulls and fake flowers in the room. The food: Straightforward bad. The oysters were frozen, and calamari was more burned fat than calamari. Drinks: Just bad. Their champagne is just bad sparkly white wine,and their beer selection consists of the most cliche kind of beer you can get all over the US. Service: Cloying and Deceitful. There was nothing friendly or fine about it. So, the specificity of our experience is as follows: We went there when it was still very early, around 5 pm. The place is totally empty, and although we considered just leaving it, we decided to stick through it. We sat at the bar, with the intentions of having that dozen oysters that Group-on has promised us, and have a couple glasses of champagne. The smell was pretty bad already.  We sit at the bar and this waitress comes and starts talking to us. She introduces herself, asks for our names, and then starts talking about this great deal they have, which is that on Thursdays, oysters are 60 cents each. We are so lucky to have gotten there on a Thursday! Also, we are there on a happy hour, so all drinks are half off! So, we order  a dozen oysters, and our two glasses of champagne. In the meantime, she doesn't give us a free second, and she keeps talking about how fantastic this deal is, how they don't have it anywhere else in Chicago and etc. Oysters come, they are nothing like good blue point oysters; they are stuck to their shells, some parts of them too cold, where it is obvious that they WERE frozen. They are pretty mediocre. However,  because it is so cheap, we decide to have another dozen (well, it's 60 cents each anyways, as this waitress keeps reminding us, isn't it?) and we order calamari and two classes of beer, because all the drinks are half off, too (from a selection of pbr,312 and green line). Calamari is just bad- and well, if you know green line, you know that it's not a good beer particularly(well, at least you can find much better pale ales, I can tell you that). When we order the check, there she comes: she takes the group-on, does numbering and tells us that our bill would have been 93, but now it is 51!! When we ask her why, we learn that those green lines were 7 DOLLARS EACH (YOU CAN GET GOOD BEER  FOR LESS THAN THAT AT REVOLUTION PEOPLE) and because we are using the group-on we are not eligible for the happy hour prices OR the Thursday off oyster prices BUT SHE JUST DIDN'T TELL US. At the end, it ended up costing MUCH more than it was worth, where some terrible bartender was intentionally deceitful and terribly annoying as to not even give us a minute to ourselves in the full hour that we were there.

2013-01-26,1.0,"I dined at Raw Bar last night with Tyler M. I thought I would also share my pov of our extremely disappointing experience. I'd like to add that I'm from the north burbs and don't get down to the city much, but when I do I don't mind splurging on excellent food and service (which raw bar claimed to offer).  My first impression wasn't terrible, but the decor seemed kind of stale. It also felt a bit awkward being the only patrons, but hey, who doesn't like special attention. We started with a couple drinks which were fine and got to ordering apps. We picked the ceviche and a half dozen oysters. These particular oysters were a substitute for the blue point oysters listed on the menu. I forget what the server called them but he seemed to be over-selling the fact they weren't their normal ones, but we're comparable. The oysters were dry and puny, Very disappointing. The ceviche wasn't bad, comparable to some I've had from garden fresh. At this point I'd give the food 3 stars. The undivided attention we were receiving got a bit more awkward at this point when the server came several times asking of we were ready for entrees as we were eating the apps. When we we ordered I picked the blue crab claws from the warm tapas section, only to be sprinkled by the substitution fairy for a second time... again the server over-sold the size and quality of the stone crab claws I would get instead, I said ok and proceeded to order the crawfish soup and the garlic shrimp and scallop scampi over rosoto. Tyler got the soup as well and the blackened mahi mahi. The soups came first which I must admit was very good. things were looking up until, the stink of crab claws arrived. I didn't think a lot of it at first and have them a chance. The meat tasted just as funky as it smelled, it was also a very mushy texture, not right. I set the bowl aside and very quickly the server came over and asked ""are those bad? I thought the smelled weird when I brought them over."" very tacky way to handle it in my opinion... what?! How did these leave the kitchen?! He took them away and promised to remove them from the bill, which was fine I guess. Before the entrees came the manager, sony, came to apologize. She claimed the claws came in fresh and didn't know why mine were bad but eluded that the rest of the batch was ok... weird... she then asked of there was anything what I'd like to try. I the asked about the prawns listed as a special on a chalk board. The server described them as some kind of nachos with the large prawns. When it arrived I was a big pile of black beans with 3 shrimp, not prawns, shrimp on top. These shrimp and the shrimp (2) in my entree were not even large by shrimp standards, barely jumbo. We called the server over to take the prawn beEn mess back, when he argued that they were prawns when I compared my shrimp side by side. He was not convincing as he says ""that's what they tell me the are"", another tacky response. Tyler said his dish was ok, and was pretty average mahi mahi, which he orders and cooks often. I tasted it and wasn't impressed. My risotto was good and garlicky and the scallops were decent as well, but again pretty average.  To add to poor experience we over heard the staff talking about someone purchasing xl condoms from a store, which they later denied to Tyler in a response to his review. Now we're liars I guess...  We asked for our check, refused boxes to take leftovers. Got the bill which was confusingly itemized and totaled over $100, $34 of which was for the 3 over priced drinks we ordered. At least they removed the stinky crab and imposter prawns... sigh. I know this is getting wordy, so thanks for reading.

Their entrees are all equally tasty and you cannot go wrong with the seafood here. On this trip I opted for the special trout/salmon stuffed filets with goat cheese, which made each bite memorable.

2012-11-07,3.0,"So, coming here,we were hoping for  some excellent seafood, and instead we got ok. seafood. First off, when walking in the place was basically deserted, which is all well and good, but then the bartender barked at the hostess to take us to the back... we were going to sit at the bar... anyway we take our seats,and whip out our trusty $25 RESTAURANT.COM coupon that we picked up for $2. You have to spend $50 to use it, but that's easy when each plate is $20 Anyway, after seeing our coupon, the waitress then directs us to every expensive dish on the menu, including $40 crab and lobster. We almost fell for that one until we saw the sad little guys swimming in their tank looking like they needed a meal themselves.  Anyhow, we ended up with the red-snapper and the swordfish.  Both of the meals took a while to come out, and both of the meals were only mediocre. The red-snapper was actually recommended by the waitress ( probably because it was the most expensive fish dish)  so we were slightly annoyed that it didn't taste like much.  In conclusion, without that coupon we'd never go back to this place, and I don't recommend it to anyone who wants some great fish at great prices without that coupon either. By the way... I don't know what everyone is talking about with the warm bread. Ours hit the table in a basket, cold, we poured our own cheap olive oil in a plate, and sprinkled our own Parmesan cheese into it, despite being one of two tables in the building.",0.9802,0.836,0.131,0.033,0.6266666666666666

Waitress tells me it's $10 off the usual $37.00 okay. Shows me a plate of two huge legs someone else orders. woo-hoo! yeah, I'll order that! We order oysters on the half shell as our app.  15 minutes later, we get bread in a basket, cold, white. 20 minutes later we get our main dish and oysters all at once.  I understand, stuff happens, we are hungry. Problem is my plate does not even come close to resembling the crab legs the waitress showed us earlier. Mine are small, cut at the joints and if assembled may equal one small leg. It is lukewarm, and I have to crack it open but first I need some utensils. My side of broccoli are two huge crowns that were dipped in water. It was so hard my knife couldn't cut it. The bus lady brings me a cracking tool. It's still a spiny struggle.  I complain to the waitress and she brings the manager. hmmm. Manager returns my crab leg platter with a cut down the center of each section, warmed up, gives me a somewhat ""al dente"" broccoli. ok, I may be on my way. Crab was tasteless. Even the smothering of butter with garlic couldn't save it because the garlic was raw.   The Bill comes in and I am charged $37. Tell the overworked waitress that it was $10 less and she says, ""oh no, it's $37 with the discount""  You mean they normally ask $47 for that stuff? No way!!! The manager compromised and gave me $5 off. Still overpriced for what I got. And I went away over garlicked and hungry. I know, you could never get enough garlic, right? Not when it's raw. And here is where I have to add, I had a coupon. Yup. Did that influence my plate/serving? Perhaps. Even with the coupon it was an expensive night out for what we got, not worth the visit.

We ordered a cucumber salad to start things off and our first bites of it was like licking a spoonful of salt, the salad was over-seasoned. The waiter came by many times to see how we were doing and happan to menetion that the salad was too salty. We were surprised that he went back to the kitchen and made us a new salad and it was perfect, lightly seasoned with all the veggies freshly cut and crunchy.  A few seconds we received a basket of warm bread with the traditional condiments of olive oil and grated cheese. As our entree we ordered the steamed mussels with goats milk cheese and baked clams. The mussel was decorately placed on a large platter and was steamed to perfection, the bread came in handle to soak up the creamy goats milk cheese sauce, the baked clams had too many fillers and overly seasoned, to our surprise the clams were whole and not chopped. The service was spot on, he was very courteous and checked on us during the entire meal.  Having such as great meal and experience from our first time there, we tried this place again but in the evenings. It was crowded but they also have more servers. We sat down in the back and waited and waited and waited for our order to be taken. We ordered the same mussels dish and a seafood pasta this time. The mussels were not decorated in the same manner as we first had it, they were dumped together in a small bowl ( I think we had less mussels than the first time around). The seafood pasta was decent but for not worth the price, the portions was very small and the pasta was over-cooked. We had to ask the waiter for some bread and the bread itself was not the same. The service was terrible, it was so bad we had to get up and ask for the bill.  Would I come back here for any meal? No. I think I take my chances buying the fresh seafood at the store and steaming them up myself.",-0.6586,0.9,0.051,0.049,0.4453334741139619

No live music that night, and it was great, very romantic, quiet, calm.  The guy who greeted us when we arrived, who I can only assume was the owner, even lit our candle for us.  He was very attentive and very nice the whole time.  I ordered a Champagne martini, that someone had said was good, and they were right. It was delicious. Probably a little expensive but where can you really go these days without spending at least 10 bucks on a martini. It was strong, which in my book, qualifies as a good martini :)  We ordered the cold seafood combo which was so/so for me.  The oysters weren't that great, but I guess I am not really a huge fan of oysters in the first place, but everything else was fantastic.  Because the crab legs were so good, we decided to go ahead and order the Kind Crag Legs @ Market Price.

My tempura battered shrimp was breaded in what looked like the chicken tenders at Denny's... HINT-- Tempura is a light, fluffy batter, not bread crumbs with Mrs. Dash thrown in. My broccoli was barely cooked and tasted like mold. This is not a lie, it was the opposite of fresh, or at least stored in a moist, dank environment. All in all, a terrible experience. Not gonna lie, we hit up the McDonald's down the street on the way home.  Awful, awful, awful.",-0.9435,0.818,0.065,0.116,0.5410919540229885
2011-02-05,2.0,"This has the feel of a neighborhood joint, with super-friendly service.  The interior is very eclectic with an odd assemblage of time-lapse knick-knacks that feel more like they belong in someone's living room than a restaurant - but I think that's the point.  The menu, too, is widely spread out - with a wide selection of seafood, a healthy list of persian/middle eastern options, and then a couple of token italian/asian dishes to round out the effect.  Obviously, some of the locals really love this place - we saw a number of people having a great time, chatting with the waitstaff etc. So perhaps this place just isn't for the uninitiated; but I don't think I'm going to take the time to get to know it.  The dishes we had - grilled baby octopus, oysters rockefeller and mussels were all ok.  But for instance, the portion of the octopus was *shocking* - $6 for 5 small pieces - legs, nothing else.  The oysters rockefeller were like none I've ever had before, with mostly breadcrumbs and not much else.  The mussels were good, if small.  I was also really irritated by beverage system.  The wine list doesn't list prices for anything - forcing you to ask the price of every single wine, beer or cocktail individually; the waitress (or at least ours), didn't know much of the pricing, so almost every request was a back and forth project; and the pricing (as mentioned by other yelpers) seemed really out of line for a neighborhood restaurant, with the cheapest goose island beer at $6 and not a glass of wine (at least the day we were there - i talked to the manager) under $8 - for a not memorable wine list. Overall, I think it's a cute place, and I love the fact that it's family owned and has been for 30+ years.  That said, I won't be helping to keep it in business.",0.9872,0.855,0.12,0.026,0.4396428571428571

2010-11-13,2.0,"Ok, people.  It's time to put this place in perspective.  Specifically, an east coast perspective where seafood is a way of life.  The short and sweet version of this review would simply read ""Fine.""  For those of you still with me, let me break it down for you.  We came with a travelzoom coupon and used it to try a sampling of a tapas.  Overall, things were fine but nothing was truly spectacular and the meal was ultimately not worth the price.  I think they generally have a good chef and good menue conception, but the quality of the seafood is average at best. Maybe it's because we're in the midwest.  Maybe it's because everyone on the east coast is a seafood snob.  Regardless, here's what we thought:  Baked Spanish Clams - Nice conception, a little over-seasoned, too much breading and the clam itself didn't seem to be top quality Blue Crab Claws (for $17) - GREAT garlic, white wine broth, but again the quality of the seafood was Meh.  In hindsight I think they had been frozen and thawed. Blacked Tiger Shrimp - Totally overcooked.  Just bad.   Smothered Alligator - best thing we tried, really well cooked and a delicious, delicately flavored sauce.    While the atmosphere and staff are really really great (they brought us a free shot when we expressed our disappointment with some of the food), it seems to me that they just don't have the huspa to make it as a real seafood restaurant.  Part of me is curious to go back and try some of the non-seafood options, because I do think the chef knows what he's doing.  But then again, Chicago's plethora of dinning options makes it easy to move on and never look back.",0.9927,0.742,0.191,0.067,0.47151437151437153

No fear, Eric is here to redeem your image.  *cracks knuckles* Complaints read on here: the atmosphere is sucks or is crappy, the music is terrible, the seafood is subpar, the service is lacking, and your date is ugly. Prepare for itemized retaliation: (I hope you passed your basic outlining course) A) Atmosphere and Music:  You are eating oysters, which continuously force me to envision vaginas, in a low-lit restaurant with candles on the table, whilst drinking any of the well-crafted cocktails from the (specials) menu, and you have R&B playing at a moderate volume throughout your dining experience.  Complaints against this kind of situation FORCE me ( I didn't wanna...) to conclude that you're one of two things: 1) You're intimidated by the opportune circumstances presented to you.  Meaning, your mojo's weakness is made evident by your lack of follow-through to Luther's baby-making music. 2) You're bitter.  About what?  Shit, I don't know.  But you suck. B) Subpar Seafood: .40 cent oysters on Thursdays.  Delicate, yet hearty, crawfish soup.  These are the only seafood items that I ingested during my trip to Raw Bar.  However, they were delicious.  The soup was a cream/tomato base and contained ample chunks of crawfish.  It was utterly decadent.  The oysters were served with saltines, Tobasco, lime wedge, and cocktail sauce with pieces of lemon peel (I think).  They were fresh as can be.  In fact, I could hear the ear-splitting last screams of the oysters, in between Luther's vocals, as they were shucked to death.  I don't know what seafood any of the complainers had, but it must've been an off day for Raw Bar- or the complainers are too used to filet-o-fat. C) The Service Is Lacking: Let me just say, the manager (or he could've been the owner, I'm uncertain) shook my hand on the way out whilst simultaneously inquiring if I enjoyed myself.  How often has that happened to you?  Yea, same here.   You know, you can't be an ass to your server and expect them to maintain their cordiality.  It's like that scene in Waiting where that fat braude (broad? Woman.) berates Ryan Reynold's character for her incorrect order.  You complainers also probably got some short-n-curlies in your fixed entree. D) Your Date Is Ugly: You're ugly.  You're date is as proportionally unattractive as you are unattractive.  Oh, I had a dirty martini with feta cheese stuffed olives.  It was titled Feta-ish martini or something.  If dirty martinis are your favorite cocktail, as mine are, then you will enjoy this martini.  If dirty martinis are something that you don't like, then I probably wouldn't like you as a person.  Bahaha.

I could tell the handwriting was not the handwriting of our waitress (again, me being perceptive, I'm just so amazing!). I told her it was wrong, and she was super sweet and said ""oh! he must have rang you up wrong! I'm sorry, I'll fix it right away!"" My ass he rang it up wrong. I'm sure the owner did it on purpose. But she fixed it and it was no problem.  I would go back for that baby octopus, but I seriously dislike the man. You may think I'm exagerrating....

No, what really bothered me was the skinny guy in the black shirt who stared everyone down unfriendily, and then made innapropriate sexual comments to my friend. Also, there was a guy who looked like a manager or owner, taller, curly hair, berating some staff in front of customers--I guess the location carries them through with Cubs season, but I hope this place fails miserably.

I was going to Metro for a concert and Yelped places to eat around there. I planned on meeting my friend at Uncommon Ground, which had positive reviews. But on my walk there, I noticed The Raw Bar & Grill with an enticing sign-- 1/2 off wine on Wednesdays. I love wine! Especially by the bottle! I asked myself, ""Is today Wednesday? Why, indeed it is! Suh-weet."" So I crossed the street and asked my friend to meet me there instead. Why didn't I get my phone out and Yelp this place before going in? Dumb dumb dumb.  So I ate dinner already, but my friend didn't. It's when we ordered that they informed us that the 1/2 off wine only applies when each person gets an entree. My friend protested-- that's not what the sign says. The waiter mumbles some lame statement about how they forgot to add that. So that just killed my mood. I was looking forward to killing a bottle. But fine, we just ordered by the glass. Then they brought out my friend's mahi mahi. Now this was the unforgivable part. As soon as the plate hit the table, I breathed in the smell of fish. Not the ""this smells incredible"" smell, but the kind of scent you'd expect from a tugboat captain's boots. Not very pleasant.  I tried her mahi mahi, wondering if it at least tasted good. Instead of being flaky and melting in your mouth like good fish, it was chewy and tough and the flavor wasn't good. I've had better fish at Long John Silver. Hell, even the frozen food aisle in Dominick's has better fish.  Their waffle fries were also subpar. McDonald's tastes better. For the price, the food should have been exponentially better. They brought out the check and gave us a take-home menu that promised 15% our next meal. I left it on the table. Will never return.",0.9815,0.765,0.156,0.079,0.5701350373764167

She brings it back and kept asking if I'd liked it. ""How's that?""  ""Are you sure?  Are you sure?"" umm, yea, and I'm not going to return it again, esp w/ ur attitude. And everytime she'd leave the table, we'd say thank you but she'd already pivoted away. Long story short, the crab cake was just EH.  It didn't have the seared-till-crisp outside, like they used to.  The ostrich, seemed like overcooked beef.  It was always cooked in a burgundy sauce...but this night the sauce was light in color.  Boyfriend loved his lamb shank. The ostrich sauce coupled w/ the daquiri snafu, tells me they need to have a serious staff meeting regarding Raw Bar Standards.   After dinner, I was super sad and felt like I'd just had dinner with that bff that had changed for the worse.  But hey!

I'll admit to having some poor service but only in the bar area seating and I've never heard anybody complain about the manager (the starer/horn dog) but now I will keep a look out.

As a person who drinks a lot of wine, I have to say that I've had some wonderful wine at Raw Bar, so maybe they are serving flat wine or it's a bad batch some people are getting.

We ordered tapas and got: Smothered alligator - There was a tiny 3 inch piece of meat in this rather large plate of goop. We had to push the sauce around to actually find the alligator. Grilled squid w/ scallions - Where were the scallions? And why the hell does this squid taste so darn fishy? My friend & I each ate one piece, made funny faces at each other, then decided we didn't want to get sick so we gave up on that dish. Beef empanadas - $4 for an itty bitty empanada. Pricey considering the size, but the tastiest thing we had during our meal. Blackened tiger shrimp w/ guacamole & tortilla chips - The guac was good - again, the shrimp just didn't taste fresh. And the consistency of the meat was weird. For a place that specializes in seafood - I cannot believe the poor quality. The ideas sounded delicious but the execution was poor.

Especially since at that time, I lived across the street above the Piano Man, when Metro was the only thing around, Uncommon Ground was ""Pete's Meats"",  and I was about the only suit in the 'hood. I came to Raw Bar because I met the owner at my gym. Our visit was a successful one. Quiet Tuesday night. No-one in the dining room. A handful of diners in the bar. We kind of like the funky, retro 70's can't-really-figure-it-out decor: Mini-lights with plastic grapes, the red bordello lighting, a mounted deer head behind the bar,  a nice vintage deco bar, exposed brick walls, 70's jazz. Is it ""retro haphazard style?"" The menu is extensive and the prices very reasonable. We started with the craw fish soup or bisque which was excellent. Creamy tomato goodness, with lots of fish and perfectly spicy. Since it's pretty rich, sharing it works well. We followed with the Persian salad which was a great follow up to the rich bisque. Clean, crisp, crunchy veggies in a light vinaigrette. Cucumber cool. Skip the shrimp cocktail-it's not really worth it. And Michael the server did warn us of that. And sharing three shrimps between two people can only lead to unhappiness and inequality! The ostrich entree was moderate in portions, tasted like tender flank steak, and had a flavorful sauce. I had a sauteed scallop and shrimp dish with penne and vegetables. There were crispy little fried sweet potato shavings on top, too. It was a garlicky but very light olive oil sauce, and the portion was generous. You also get good bread and the olive oil/parmesan dipping sauce with your meal. We drank one of the feta olive martinis, which didn't really wow us, and tried a Loire Valley Muscadet wine with dinner. That was fantastic. Overall, I think the place is a good value. The service was good, if somewhat ""pushy.""  I know the server was trying to help, but he kept acting as if we needed huge amounts of food. I wanted to ask: ""Exactly how fat do I look?""  I know he needs to sell, but how many times does one have to say ""I'm not that hungry tonight?""  Of course, given the choice between a server who ignores you, or this guy, I'd take the latter. There are really some good combo's here, like prime rib and shrimp for $16.00. Not a bad deal. I'll definitely go back and  try some other dishes and maybe see what the weekend is like there.

The place looks a little small, and when you walk in, you think it is sort of a dive bar, but keep going, and you will find a dinning area with very unique facade.  There is sort of a sea thing going on, and it is unlike any other restaurant in Wrigleyville.  If you want to forget you live in the center of one of the biggest cities in the US go here and I don't know quite where you will think you are, but it isn't the middle of Chicago.",0.8745,0.884,0.102,0.015,0.4958888888888888

It looked like the people around us were getting great service, but our waiter seemed a little inexperienced. He was really friendly, just not very good. However, the food is great and if you go you will not be disappointed. Try the alligator tapas....they were very good.",0.9789,0.604,0.327,0.069,0.6724260355029585

2007-11-21,4.0,"I just went in on a recent Saturday night with friends and family. The menu is extensive, so we had a hard time choosing. We decided to split everything we ordered which is always a great way to try a bunch of items.  Mostly all of the fifteen items we ordered were right on. For entrees, the Lamb Shank and Jumbo Chicken Charcoal were tasty. I can never get enough of those berries on the chicken & rice dishes! Pair it with the Persian Salad for a tangy treat. The appetizers were gone practically before they hit the table surface. I always order the ALLIGATOR and it never disappoints! Sop up the extra sauce with the bread that is brought to the table. Again, the persian salad is nice. Not the best I have ever had. The best is the one I make, of course! I always like the ostrich whether as an appetizer or an entree. The only food I didn't like was the persian chicken potato salad. Basically it was gross and unfortunately I was really looking forward to it.  We came on Saturday, so they did have live music. Being sat right next to the stage, I thought it would be overwhelming. It turns out that we were louder than the music! No problem. It provided a nice background for our evening.  The Orange Fizztini was great. I finished up with some of the table wine. Overall it was a successful night. Thanks Toni!",0.9861,0.793,0.162,0.045,0.559126984126984

I had a pasta dish with Italian sausage and shrimp in it and it was out of this world!         My dining partner ordered blue crab claws and got something she didn't believe was a blue crab claw. Although the chef said it was, infact, blue crab, they did not argue and brought her something different. That was classy and showed great care for the customer.

2007-05-06,1.0,"I haven't tried Raw Bar's food, but the wine and sangria we ordered tasted stale. The bar replaced it on request with fresh wine from uncorked bottles. The fact that the second round tasted better told me the first glasses were old wine. At their prices, Raw Bar has no right selling stale wine. The bar owner spent a good hour ogling the female part of our party and is rumored to be quite grabby with the staff.

The piano music was so-so. They have a really nice selection of ""tapas"" that were all really excellent.  We got the Jumbo Sea Scallops, Charred Tiger Shrip, Smothered Alligator, and Beef Empanada.  They were all very excellent and hit the spot! My date had a few blue moons and I had their ""Raw Manhattans"" which were served in Martini glasses and were exceptional. After dinner we hung out at the bar for a while and had some more drinks.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they offered Anchor Steam in bottles (I usually drink this draft at Hopleaf and love it). All in all an unexpected great restaurant.  I'll probably go back here to sample their entrees in the future.",0.9779,0.841,0.149,0.01,0.5381410256410256
2007-01-16,4.0,"Having tried several dishes at R.B., all I have to say is:  if you like lamb, try the lamb!  It falls off the bone and is served with a heaping mound of dill rice.  Just scrape it off the bone and mix with the rice.  Easily 2 to 3 meals.   I wouldn't say the atmosphere is ""weird"".  It's ""eclectic"", and quite unlike your new trendy snobatoriums that pop up weekly where people talk loudly about their pointy shoes rather than enjoying a nice, fairly mellow time conversing with friends. For seafood, R.B. is pretty good, but unfortunately, incredible seafood costs $$, so go to Joe's in River North.  Yeah, I'm a tad surly today...

2006-12-21,3.0,"Their interior decor and ambience in the main dining area (non-smoking) is amazing and deserve 5 stars.  Their selection of food, including the wide variety of seafood deserve 5 stars.  But the actual taste of the dishes are questionable (2-3 stars).   1) fresh oysters after being opened should NOT be washed with water.  You need to preserve the raw flavor as you open them.  2) raw does not equal ""sashimi"".  The word ""sashimi"" deserves to be used only when prepared in a certain way, and blending with sesame seeds and picked ginger is NOT the way to do it.  3) putting too much salt and garlic and other strong spices kills the natural taste of the ingredient (e.g. steak, mussels), and you don't want to do that.

2006-10-28,3.0,"This place is... weird. We ventured into the Raw Bar before a Metro show because it was the only place that... well... was not a sports bar along the strip. And sports bar this was not. But we could not stop repeating the fact that this place was just.... weird. Not in a bad way. Not necessarily in a good way, either. The decor is a strange mix of sea theme crossed with lounge crossed with kitsch. There are fuzzy leopard angel fish stuffed animals on the wall. There was a white feather wreath above our table. There was a whale poster at the entrance of the dining room. The ambiance is very pleasant, particularly so because we caught the tail end of a jazz trio, excellent. With the dim lighting, cozy booths, and plethora of candles, I imagine this would be a romantic date spot.  The menu is a little too large. Not in the way where you think, 'wow, there are so many excellent choices, I don't know how to select just one."" It's more in the way that you're entirely overwhelmed by the variety of cuisine and subtle variations that you are paralyzed to make a choice, forcing you to randomly point at something when the waiter comes. I ordered three tapas: the grilled portabella mushrooms, the dolmeh (which never actually made it to the table) and some strange eggplant-onion-mint mixture. The mushrooms were well prepared, however the flavor was bizarre. Again, not in a bad way, but not necessarily in a good way either. The flavor was intense pickle.. possibly balsamic, but entirely strange. Others at our table ordered squid, salmon-stuffed poblano peppers, and mussels. Being a vegetarian, I didn't taste any of these selections, but they basically made similar comments: that the taste was not bad but somehow unusual. Our poor waitress was a mess. She kept repeating that she was new, but she didn't need that disclaimer because it was entirely obvious. She brought the wrong wine twice, forgot a dish, kept muttering inaudibly, made strange comments. She was very kind, though, and entirely kept with the theme: strange in an obscure way. The menu is very well-priced, however, and overall we walked away, if not a bit disoriented, not displeased with our choice. I would probably not recommend the restaurant aspect of Raw Bar, but for the close proximity to Metro and the cool ambiance.",-0.3949,0.828,0.084,0.088,0.5607193154068153
