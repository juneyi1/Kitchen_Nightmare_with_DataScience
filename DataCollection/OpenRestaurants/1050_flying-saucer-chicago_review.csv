2017-05-08,1.0,I used to take people from the neighborhood here for the organic food but I got sick on a chewy country fried steak dish and when I called they did not offer a remedy which made my job as the healthy eating fairy that much harder as it drove a wedge between Humboldt Park folk and this cute little diner. The tables are too close and the space nazzis will definitely remove your jacket if you have it taking space in an adjacent chair. I wouldn't mind the intimacy if people were actually happy to intermingle in the boujie conversations but this dream is squashed with a timid blushing smile if you overhear a convo or attempt to make friendly small talk with the person sitting a few inches away. Did I miss an etiquette class lesson that said no talking when sitting at farm tables packed like sardines? Also I found it interesting that there was no sugar alternative for beverages.. so a sugared up version of me was probably even worse suited for the weird isolation of the 14 inch bubble of elbows in eating,0.9173,0.729,0.158,0.112,0.539795918367347

2016-05-21,1.0,"One of the most humiliating and disrespectful experiences I have ever had in my life. Here is the build-up. I was treating my brother and father to some breakfast after running in the  Hope for the Day run in Humboldt Park, a race that sought to raise awareness about suicide. It was my father's birthday and my brother's birthday the week prior. We got seating immediately in the middle of the restaurant, at a table that was situated in what seemed to be the epicenter of traffic. My father sat down first, and I noticed that he had moved the table in such a way as to avoid unnecessary friction within the restaurant, as the original configuration was oddly in the way of every possible path. After a minute, the manager/possibly owner, came by and straightened the table to its original configuration, which was awkward and obtrusive. After he left, I adjusted the table's position. This person, a balding, tattoo'ed, tortoise-shell glasses wearing, effete monstrosity of a man with an English accent, came by and moved the table again. After the first time, where I saw him correct my father's positioning of the table, I was a little irked. But now, when he moved my configuration of the table, I got more agitated. He returned. I asked him, ""Is there some sort of fire code enforced that you have to keep moving the table?"" ""No, it's so that people have room to move about in the restaurant,"" he said. ""Well, there seems to be even less room to move, now,"" I said. I noticed that a better table had opened up. I sighed and thought of a resolution. ""You know, this is not working, what if we moved to that table over there,"" I said. In response, he furrowed his brow and spat out, ""You know what, your attitude is not working. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?"" I left, in shock and disbelief. Angry, but compliant and hurt. It affected me for hours after, and I thought about the reasons that would lead a man to disrespect a fellow human being so badly. Was his life so petty and shallow that the only power left he had was dictating who goes and who stays during the brunch hours? I felt angry, but I also felt sad for him, and for us, as humans.",-0.9888,0.871,0.018,0.112,0.48409961685823744

I came here on a weekday to eat alone and asked if i could sit at a tiny table because there were very few people there. But the male server rolled his eyes and said 'ummmmmmm if you HAVE to take up a two top table, then be my guest.' He couldn't even be bothered to hide his disdain. So instead I sat at the bar and ordered to-go, which made the server appalled, visibly. I ordered a coffee for there and watched as he took everyone else's order at the bar and brought them all coffee before me. I even had to remind him that I ordered one. He huffed and rolled his eyes. And THEN went to the very attractive woman sitting next to me and took her order, flirted a bit and treated her the way he should be treating everyone: with fucking respect.  So you know what i fucking did?! I fucking paid and told him to keep the change and then I watched as he realized I had left him a ten dollar tip. That ten dollars was worth it to see the look on his face. He looked as if he had just swallowed his whole foot! And then he thanked me and said good bye.  Flying Saucer, why do you keep a server on for years who only shows respect when someone flashes them a nice tip? That isn't how this business works. I've worked in Lincoln Park where I have to deal with entitled, sexist bros and high heeled rich white chicks. You are in the heart of humboldt park and the majority of your clientele is probably nerdy weirdos and sometimes maybe entitled white people on the weekends, am i right? So having a veteran server that's chronically bitter and noticeably annoyed with every single customer doesn't really make sense. Have him work in a bar in wrigleyville or in a late night vegan diner in lakeview where teenagers that don't tip hang out. Then maybe he'll appreciate where he's at a bit more. You have such a cute spot with eclectic vintage decor and a place like that would be so much nicer with a kinder server. One that smiles and isn't pissed off at you before you even sit down.

The Metropolis coffee is hot and strong. The baked goods are yummy and worth buying extra for later at home. Good diners are hard to find in this region where you can come as you are, get a great & filling meal and not spend a fortune. It's a small place and worth the wait if you see a line. (I've never had a wait longer than 20 minutes and the staff does a good job of juggling things and keeping track.) If there's space at the counter, then take it. (It's a great counter.) The owners here are to be commended. They had a dream -- like most of us have and don't act on -- and they have delivered on it for more than 15 years. And it ain't easy. Where else can you find an independent diner providing quality meals at an affordable price on a consistent basis without major interruptions, ""renovations,"" feuds, makeovers, etc.? Like I said: It ain't easy. Anyone who doesn't like the Flying Saucer should either eat at home (too picky) or find themselves a nice, pricey white table cloth bistro (so they can tell their friends they ""discovered"" some nouveau hipster cuisine that no one else has heard of). Frankly, if you are disappointed here, then there is something wrong with you that counseling and medication might fix. Might not. If the world were perfect and Chicago were a breakfast town (it's not), then every neighborhood would have a Flying Saucer-quality restaurant or two or three. But it's not and we don't. Therefore, this restaurant stands out because it has its regular tried-and-proven dishes, fun specials and is reasonably priced overall. The Flying Saucer is worth going out of your way for and it is as reliable as an old friend or as a relative who has to take your calls. It is yummy and I have never had a bad meal here.

It was nice to have a meal that I can say was a before-after experience that didn't leave me feeling like I sacrificed anything. In fact, when it comes to this place the only things I've ordered thus far is the breakfast bowls. They're large portions, always tasty, and definitely leave you full. But four stars. What are the drawbacks? Well, the trucker bowl is my staple, but the food is inconsistent. The ratios are just different, and it's one of those things I would notice. Less potatoes one time, less gravy another. Also, for a cash only, sit down spot, the prices are a little higher. It's not that I'm that cheap, and if I want cheap breakfast I'll make it myself.

The coffee cake was good, but ""home fries"" were just large chunks of boiled potato finished in a skillet, with no onion or other embellishment, and bacon was cheap and overcooked. I think this may be the result of a slapdash attitude in the kitchen, because every error seemed to point in the direction of laziness: the fruit cup I ordered, for instance, was full of stems, and the orange wedge it came with was sliced at random angles, making it challenging to remove the peel without making a mess. The meal wasn't inedible, but it was far from anything special. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, nor would I consider it a special treat if I were in the area again.

I do wish they had a few more vegan options, but I suppose when you do it right, there's no need to add to it. Why mess with perfection?

Maybe I just managed to go there on their good days or I have just been seated by the nicer servers, but they all seem nice and attentive to me. My only two complaints about Flying Saucer are 1) It's cash only. Not the hugest deal in the world and I usually have enough in my wallet to get what I want, but still, it can be a pain. 2) The add ons can be a bit much. Pay extra for maple syrup and margarine for your pancakes? That's a little silly to me. In the end, I do it and it's not that much extra. But still, who can have pancakes without maple syrup and margarine? If I were to make a suggestion to you, gentle readers, it would be this: go on a weekday for breakfast if you can. It will be far less crowded, you'll get a table right away and service will be speedy and attentive. If that's not an option, they do allow for carry out which is great for brunch in bed (not that I do that sort of thing).",0.9927,0.781,0.172,0.047,0.6181520806520806

We were a party of 6, 5 of whom happen to be Mexican, so sadly the 20% gratuity was built into the bill and we couldn't express our disapproval through the tip. We were sitting for 20 minutes before one of our party got up and asked the counter for water. He brought 2, we waited another 10 minutes while watching them bus every table in the restaurant and fill all other waters and coffees before 8.5mo pregnant me got up to ask for 4 more waters. When the waters were brought we told him we were ready to order and then waited another 10 minutes. We were there for more than a half hour before having our order taken. We almost left and I wish we would have. A table that was seated 25 minutes after us had drinks and their orders take before we were even acknowledged. The table next to us had their coffee refilled 3 times without us even being looked at.

Everyone I've spoken with prior to going has said that Flying Saucer is 'hit-or-miss'. I feel like I fell right in the middle of this. The food was great, I just think we missed the rush where the heat and freshness of the dishes we ordered would have been spot on!  Overall, I'm definitely going back. I'm convinced this place will knock it out of the park next time. I've just moved into the neighborhood and need a great go-to diner. Come on guys! ;) The decor in there is charming and the staff was friendly. I'd suggest giving it a try.",0.9931,0.751,0.236,0.013,0.4872519841269842

I'm mostly vegetarian, sometimes... but I've taken it a step farther for the last 38 days going mostly 'plant based', code word vegan, but not a true die hard vegan, so I can't dare offend the V-crew. So, the last couple of days I have been seriously craving a comfort food breakfast. Seriously. I'm almost dreaming about fluffy scrambled eggs. So, I'm yelping like crazy and I find this place. Sounds decent, close enough, let's go. I go with the Bazza bowl made vegan... can I just say where was the flavor. It was plenty of food all tossed in a bowl but bland as shoe laces. It's places like this that give vegan, excuse me, plant based, a bad name. A little cashew cream would have been lovely to tie it all together, or better yet add a small dab of guac, I'm desperate... give me some lime and cilantro... something.

2014-01-24,2.0,I'm always down to try new breakfast/brunch establishments so imagine my excitement as I planned a brunch date with a friend at Flying Saucer. Boy what a disappointment that turned out to be.  Service was okay. We were greeted minutes after walking in and seated quickly after. After looking over the menu I opted for my go-to benedict and not only was it over sauced with their red pepper sauce (completely overpowered the eggs and eventually the baby spinach) but halfway into eating it I found a twist tie lying beneath one of the english muffins! I called our server over and he apologized for it (not very sincerely may I add...) and promised not to add it on the bill. I think he was more mad about losing the possible tip over the fact that I almost ate a twist tie. I often am willing to give places a second try but with so many great brunch joints in town it's kind of hard to forgive something like a faulty benedict and finding a foreign object on your plate. Maybe next time it'll be better....?,0.7909,0.757,0.144,0.1,0.47703256339619976

Sometimes at the end of a shift I understand the quality is going to go down a couple notches, but it doesn't mean that I'm happy about it. About 2pm we were the last people to get food for the lunch shift that day and the food was pretty mediocre compared to what I had experienced in my last visit.

Tip #1: It's cash only Tip #2: You won't be seated until your entire party is present. I thought the food was A-OK as a 3-star suggests. I like that there are many options for the vegan, vegetarian and meat eater in you, so that's a plus. I ordered the Flying Breakfast Bowl and added organic steak because I'm a meat eater! Think Chipotle burrito bowl with eggs for breakfast! It didn't take too long for our order to come, but the food was oddly just warm... not hot... like it would be if it has just come off the skillet. It looked delicious though and fresh so the actual temperature of it was VERY odd. Anyway, my food was tasty. It wasn't to die over but it was good and I sure did eat all of it. No complaints on my end other than the temperature. Two of my friends ordered the Black Bean Cakes which looked amazeballs when they came out! I tried a bite of it and it tasted ok, but yeah... just ok, which was shocking given how yummy it looked. I think it was because the black bean cakes were softer than expected. I was thinking they would be more like the texture of a black bean burger... more together... but instead the cakes were softer/mushier/creamier than expected. It tasted fine especially after adding some Cholula to it. My other friend had the Tofu Sweet Potato Hash and seemed equally satisfied.  No regrets checking out Flying Saucer.

Not those IHOP pancakes that are all exactly the same size and perfectly golden. This was misshaped and dark. Just how I make at home. And just how I love it!!!

It was delightful. I LOVED it. I would be a vegetarian if I could eat like this. The hubs ordered a corned beef hash skillet. It wasn't the pickly briny fatty corned beef that some people use. But the canned crispy on the edges, finely minced diner corned beef that he enjoyed. It was served w runny eggs (or any other style you choose) and a biscuit smothered in gravy.

Another couple was going to join us, so we asked one of the wait staff, if we could be seated --- he stated that we will only be seated at a four top when the second party arrives, no sooner. (I have never in my over 30 years of dining out ever encountered such a policy, especially given it was not a matter of reservations or a line). He was, it should be noted, snide and short, and offered no suggestions as to where we could conveniently and comfortably wait for our friends. It should also be noted that it 35 degrees outside, my girl friend was visibly exhausted, the restaurant is small and packed in, with no area to stand, no seats besides those at the tables.

The same server then approached us, churlishly stating we are not to block the doorway --- there was, I repeat, several tables available, and there were no other guests waiting, nor anyone leaving or entering the restaurant, and we were quietly, respectfully talking.  We then exited the restaurant, stood in the vestibule to call the other couple and propose having brunch at more hospitable restaurant. The same server then poked his head out of the door, and stated, 'It is best if you leave.'

Our kids stayed seated the whole time, with the exception of going to the restroom to wash their hands.  We monitored their voice levels and made sure they were well behaved.  My issues were as follows: -The waiter scowled at us when we walked in and although we were saying we'd like to sit by the window where there was more space, he made us sit right in front of the door.  -I asked for a glass of water that we drank down to the last drop and it never got refilled. -We were the only group with kids and as soon as we sat down, they cranked up the music as if to indicate they needed to cover up the sound of our annoying kids. -We just came from Garfield Park Conservatory and my friend had accidentally left behind her son's little bean sprout seed that they had planted in a little planter and, not even five minutes after we left and turned back to retrieve it, the waiter had thrown it out! -He automatically added 20% gratuity to our total bill, which was a bit surprising since we were only 3 adults and 3 tikes.  I typically tip more than 20% when I bring my kid anywhere just to make up for the crumbs dropped on the floor but it's his prerogative.  It always annoys me when service is automatically added but if, hey, they are going to decide how much I'm going to tip, that's what they're going to get.  It's pretty much always less than what I would have given.   -The waiter never gave a single smile.  Now, I'm not expecting to be treated like royalty...I just expect to be treated like a friend.  When I come to your place of business, I want to be made to feel welcome.  I read a reviewer, a friend of the business, who pretty much blamed the customers for their complaints about this place and that's just a huge turn-off.  It shouldn't just be the ""in-crowd"" and the ""hipsters"" who get treated well...it should be anyone who comes.  The reviewer basically said the servers are treating you like ""peers.""  But that's just not true...my peers treat me way better than that..we treat each other with respect and greet each other with warmth.  We don't treat each other like annoyances.  That's not a peer.

Nonetheless, I wouldn't have become such a regular, and a friend, and a promoter of their business if they weren't so awesome. The food is fresh, often organic, vegan options but also options for meat-lovers (the Heartland steak is fantastic) and portions are, shall we say, hearty. You get your money's worth. From the fluffy pancakes to the giant bowls full of large vegetables on rice and pico de gallo (?), to the breakfast sampler and the totally irresistible weekend specials, I've truly never had a bad - or even mediocre - meal here. Ever. Now, a few reviews here complain about unfriendly service. I've never experienced it. But then again, I don't expect the fakey smiley corporate Bennigan's experience. I don't want - or need - to be fawned over. Take my order, bring me my food. If there is a ""hipster"" aesthetic, it's that pre-gentrification Wicker Park - and this restaurant is in Humboldt Park, but same theory - was filled with bars and restaurants in which the servers, cooks, etc. were your peers. We were serving each other. There was no condescension, no patronizing, no hierarchy, no sense of entitlement from self-absorbed patrons. Just be cool, y'all. And by that, I don't mean be hipster by current definition. I mean don't be a douche, by current definition. The owners and waitstaff and kitchen staff are ultra-cool, not in a ""cool, hip, look at us, we work at an ad agency or social media company and drink craft beer and ride fixed-gear bikes"" kind of way, but in the absolute realest way. If you are offended if they don't always think the world revolves around you, you are missing out, not them. The ambience: always great music in a cozy, slightly retro but not too-too setting. It's just comfortable; I prefer the counter but the banquettes are cool too.  Kids: The Saucer is excellent for kids. Without asking, the staff will automatically bring toys (I like the plastic dinosaurs) to your table to help occupy your small children; it's very family-friendly, as the owners and staff have children themselves, who are often there. If your experience was otherwise, I suggest you are the exception and perhaps the source of any friction which may have occurred. The general aesthetic and desire of the restaurant is to be welcoming to all, and indeed I see every time I'm there folks of all ages, colors, backgrounds. It isn't for hipsters, it's for people who enjoy a place just like the Flying Saucer. It's one of the best places you will find, and my only complaint is that they won't put the Andy Wrap on the menu full-time.

She had ordered the special French toast, reading it off the specials placard, even mentioning how much she liked mints, especially with chocolate. Easy enough. But when they brought our food, they brought her a limp-looking, misbegotten two pieces of French toast. We politely told the waitress who brought it and she took it and headed back to kitchen.

We were there on Sat afternoon.  They said a 20 min wait but I think some people took off so we were seated quickly.  The service felt odd.  The second we sat down they asked if we knew what we wanted so I just said a water.  My boyfriend wanted decaf coffee.  He said they didn't have decaf but could give him a decaf americano.   My water came 1/2 full and w/o ice.  I mean if you're going to give me water why not go all the way with it? The vibe is hipster which is fun even though I'm the opposite.  When the guy came back to take our order I asked for veg sausage biscuits and gravy w/ scrambled eggs.  My boyfriend got the egg sandwich medium with chicken sausage.  The bill was $25!  I saw on the menu the bagel and cream cheese is $6.95.  Ouch. We waited for what seemed like a very long time for our food.  They refilled my water just before it arrived.  To be fair I saw a big table that was ahead of us. My food was not hot.  The eggs were a little runny and not seasoned well and the biscuits were hard.  Hard biscuits can be ok if you have enough gravy to soften them but I didn't have enough.  My boyfriend's sandwich needed to be eaten with a fork because the eggs were very soft. Maybe we ordered wrong but I can't bring my self to order one of the bowls.  It seems too starchy!  I think I'll leave this one to the hipsters.,0.5534,0.902,0.047,0.051,0.4558574879227053
2012-09-20,3.0,"I like Flying Saucer! And really...who doesn't like brunch right? Flying saucer is easy in almost every sense of the word....it's close to (my) home, its laid back and it serves a darn good decent brunch. *Almost is the key word because....they only take cash, and of course it's inevitable that whenever I'm in the mood for Flying Saucer I don't have any cash on me (ggrrrr atm fees!). Their coffee is delish, and for $2 a person is bottomless - can't beat metropolis. It's BYOB - helloooo to my own personal bottomless mimosa's As for the main event -  - I've had their cheese grits twice, for some reason on my second visit I wasn't as thrilled with them. Maybe it's because I'd been perfecting my own version of Paula Deans recipe at home. So here's my conclusion, if you can make it at home (and better) don't order it out, so I won't be anymore. - I was impressed by their Eggs Benedict, it was pretty unique. Eggs benny topped with baby spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts w/ red pepper sauce ($9.25). You also have the option to add ham ($1.50). - Breakfast Burrito...meh. Kind of dry and I personally found it boring ($9.50). Maybe I should've gone with the option of adding chorizo($1.50) or organic steak($3.25) to liven it up a bit. - I'm DYING to try their quiche but it's apparently a hot commodity and is sold out the past 3 times I've gone...waaa Here's my thought about the service -it's nothing frilly, there's no production. They make sure you have everything you need and want but don't expect any ""chatting up"" or any sort of banter...which in my opinion isn't bad thing but may be a turn off to others.

2011-12-19,4.0,"Arguably one of the better omelets around town! My hungover and crabby ass sauntered into Flying Saucer at noon on a Saturday and we were seated within about 2 minutes.  Good to know there's a brunch spot out there without crazy-long wait times.  Totes necessary when you're tummy is rumbling and begging to be filled with eggs and carbs to soak up whatever you were drinking the night before. The menu at Flying Saucer covers the bases well.  A build your own omelet section, egg dishes, french toast, pancakes... all the usual suspects.  It's a good variety and truly everyone should be able to find something they'll like. I went with an omelet with chicken apple sausage, scallions, cheddar and tomatoes.  What you usually get with a diner omelet is all these ingredients chopped up pretty finely and mixed into the eggs.  At Flying Saucer you get these ingredients left in fairly large chucks and just nestled inside the eggs.  Kind of like a plain omelet with the ingredients placed on top and then the rest of the egg portion folded over.  It was kind of cool because I had BIG pieces of chicken sausage (YUM) and tomatoes to work through.  The whole thing actually eats more like a scramble due to the size of the omelet ingredients, but who cares?  It was tasty as hell. The one star was lost with lack of beverage selection.  I like a nice, fountain Diet Coke, but unfortunately Flying Saucer only offers bottled, local sodas.  NOT Diet Coke.  Sigh.  So I also ordered a cup of coffee, which tasted kinda burned.  I also wasn't even offered a coffee refill.  It was just kind of lame on the beverage front. Drinks notwithstanding, I really enjoyed my brunch at Flying Saucer.  You KNOW I'll be back for one of those luscious omelets soon!",0.7341,0.811,0.113,0.076,0.5537698412698413

2011-12-12,3.0,"Last weekend, I sat my ass down in a comfy seat at Flying Saucer, eagerly awaiting what I knew from experience would be a totally warm, cozy, coma-inducing breakfast.  This place is usually like giving your guts a hug with a down coat on.  So I ordered the thing I have ordered three times before, the trucker bowl, which has never failed to satisfy and comfort me and make me useless for an entire day. Let me just point out that I know nobody likes to be hungry and hung over and pay for a meal they don't want.  But when I have this experience, you can ask my dining partners: it ruins my life.  I melt into a pile of bloody tears and I sigh heavily for HOURS after the dining experience that has failed to meet my expectations, I start to vocalize how ""See?!  This is proof that the whole world is against me!  Put 'crappy breakfast at Flying Saucer' on my list of examples!!""  I am basically a big downer and nobody wants to be around me after a disappointing meal, so it's in everyone's best interest that breakfast be tip top. When I ordered the trucker bowl, I expected the biscuits, scrambled eggs, fluffy white mounds of pepper gravy, ham, onions, cheese, and potatoes.  The key here is ""fluffy white mounds"" of gravy.  If you've ever made gravy from scratch before, you'll know that it's very easy to completely fuck it up and end up with oily, watery goop that separates from the flour and is just basically about as useful to me at breakfast as a pool of dog vomit.  So that's what was poured all over my breakfast: oily, pinkish, separated gravy fuck-up that should have been discarded and re-made from scratch because it was unfit to grace the top of a heap of such amazing ingredients.  But nah, they just figured, fuck it, we're busy, these assholes will eat anything.  And they served the crap.   The minute the server put the bowl down, I knew just by looking at it that it wasn't right.  I started to breathe into a paper bag to calm my distress and my boyfriend eventually talked me into taking a bite.  I did, and it was as if they had mixed Sriracha with the gravy (maybe that's where the pink hue came from??).  It was definitely made spicy with something other than pepper all of a sudden.  I'm telling you, I had been looking forward to this yummy bowl of slop that has never failed to make me happy before like you would not believe.  I had thought about it all week.  I had dreams about dipping my feet into that gravy and tucking myself into one of those biscuits for a long winter's nap. We called the server over, and I asked ""Is this by any chance the vegetarian gravy or something?""  He said ""Did you ASK for vegetarian gravy?"" and before he could hear me say no, he went to check our ticket to see if I'd asked for vegetarian gravy.  He didn't even glance at our weird bowls of pink watery gravy.  He came back and showed me where ""regular"" or whatever was written on our ticket....which really proves nothing, because it's not like the chef explodes if he accidentally goes against the ticket and fucks something up.  But, oh, the ticket never lies, stupid customer!  ""OK,"" I said, ""it just, uh, looks weird....it's usually different.""  So the server points at the pieces of ham which are OBVIOUSLY SLICED AND ADDED TO THE TOP OF THE DISH SEPARATELY FROM THE OTHER INGREDIENTS, and says ""Oh, it's because you had it with ham.""  Then he leaves. Whatever.  I've had it with ham before and it hasn't fucked the whole dish.  I ended up scraping everything to the side and eating what hadn't been tarnished by the dog barf excuse for gravy, which wasn't much.  And I paid for it and left and whined all the way home about how the Devil had his dong dipped in everything I loved, because the universe HATES MEEEE. It's funny, I'd been willing to forgive the time we went and one of our group ordered the chicken fried steak, which came out bleeding all over the plate and squawking and mooing.  They fixed that up pretty quick, so I was going to overlook that.  Just before we ordered this time, someone said to me ""I can't believe you haven't Yelped this place yet, you love this place!""  Well.  Now we know that love is a very strong word, which should be reserved for places that don't sacrifice quality just to get butts in and out faster.  That crap gravy ruined my day.  It will be a long time before I put my day in Flying Saucer's hands again, and if I do, I'm'a go back there and stand next to the guy making the gravy and give him some tips.  Like don't let the Devil spit in it, perhaps?",0.989,0.791,0.126,0.083,0.46299072039072037

One awesome perk is that they sell semi-local cage-free eggs by the dozen, at a much more reasonable price than grocery stores...score!

2010-06-01,3.0,"Brunch is my favorite meal of the day and Sunday brunch is the best time of the week. I came to this spot last Sunday with four other friends, a few had been here before.  Three of us ordered the trucker bowl (one vegetarian, two with meat), someone ordered french toast, I got the vegan breakfast burrito.  The trucker bowl seems like some kind of like a brunch adventure with everything just thrown in a bowl. Kind of like those skillets at chain breakfast places, I think it's usually tough to go wrong with a dish like that.  My ""burrito"" on the other hand was weird and very much unlike the burrito listed on the menu that said it could be veganized. With the cheese and sour cream removed, the Flying Saucer peeps added this sweetly fried (maybe nutmeg-ey?) tofu and sesame kale, and put some black beans and salsa on the side. It wasn't bad, it was just weird and confusing. The potatoes were undercooked and needed salt/pepper/flavor. I don't think the waitstaff said a word to us besides taking our order. The place was pretty crowded and my water and coffee was never empty, so that's cool. They automatically included tip on the 5 person table, which was a gutsy move since we would normally tip well above 20% rather than the 15% they included. I think we added a few more dollars than the amount on the bill, but c'mon. It's not like we had 10 people at our table. All in all, Flying Saucer was pretty decent. I wouldn't say it's the best in the area, but I'd have no problems going back again to try the vegan pancakes.",0.9748,0.815,0.139,0.046,0.5242222222222223

Then the food came. I ordered their version of Eggs Benedict, with artichoke hearts, spinach, a sun-dried tomato hollandaise, and a side of home fries.  The potatoes were cooked OK, but were...well, season-less isn't the word because they tasted weird.  The eggs were overcooked (proper Benedicts are a 4 minute poach or slightly runny) and I bit into a shell.  It was a brown eggshell, so for fans of brown eggs, here's your spot.  All in all, a two-star meal. My server was the icing on the crap cake.  She twice trash talked about customers to a fellow employee in earshot of other customers, even when one of those customers complimented them before leaving.  That's just unprofessional!  She also never acknowledged me, asked if I needed anything (FYI, I wanted a muffin to go), or thanked me when I paid - she just flung my change on the counter and twirled away.  You know, it's little things that take 10 seconds total to make someone want to come back.

NO one was waiting today when we walked in, this is key. So, anyway, my friend and I come in, no one is at the door and no one else was waiting so we grabbed the table by the door which was two tables pushed together against the little booth built along the wall. The waiter comes up and says to my friend he wants us to get up and go stand in the back hallway to wait for a 2 seat table to open up since I guess the one we sat at was his only ""fiver"" and he wanted to save it.  My friend said ok and started to get up. Well, I looked around and saw  no one else around so I said to her, ""why do we have to get up again?"" because I didn't hear what she had just agreed to.  She explained and I said to her, ""absolutely not.  If there were people waiting I could see him saving that for a bigger party, but there is literally no one else around so I think we should pull these tables apart and sit here. I don't know why we have to get up and go stand in the back of the restaurant just IN CASE, on the OFF chance that a bigger party comes in before we're done! We're live patrons sitting here ready to pay to eat here and they should just give us this damn table or pull them apart, if a larger party walks in tough shit, they can wait a few. Why should I wait if no one is even here?""  Just then as she started to explain what he was doing and why, the 2 seat table just next to us finished and they started to clear it off, I guess with the intention of having us move to that one.  So, I think, ok, this one is ready. Fine. Seriously, it was fine, but then this guy says to me, with full sarcasm, ""is THIS going to work for YOU?""  I explained my position about being a live customer right there and then he kept arguing with me about this theoretical party that was going to walk in. I said,"" I guess there is no such thing as Customer is right since you're continuing to argue with me"" then he says with more sarcasm, 'We want you to feel at home' or something like that which I found again, sarcastic and off putting. I have never, in 22 years in Chicago, felt the need to walk OUT of a restaurant, but at this point he was so snotty to me I actually wondered if he might spit in my coffee or something.  Maybe not, but I felt very uncomfortable and unwelcome. It's not like I can't wait for a table or even mind moving but usually there is another party that needs the table, and I mean a party of LIVE people who are actually PRESENT. I don't think I was being unreasonable for being insulted by that treatment. I actually had gone the previous day to take a friend to Kuma's, who had a one hour plus wait (out of town visitor really wanted to go there so I was ready to wait hours for a burger) the second they opened and they actually had to move us from our table, I did this happily after waiting an hour plus for that table and we didn't even mind, so it's not that I am so difficult as a patron.  My friend said that she saw his point and why he wanted to save the fiver and he was just trying to be efficient as a hostess, but she agreed he went about it all wrong and didn't handle it correctly.  I told her I agreed with her, and saw a reason behind saving a larger table, but the host or hostess is typically dealing with people waiting IN THE FLESH and that's why they need to move people around. I have never seen a business treat a live customer worse than a theoretical customer.  I found it absurd.  That being said, it may be a while before I try to go there again.  Which is sad, because the other waiter I recognized from ages ago, who used to patronize my record store and I wanted to say hi.  I was just too embarrassed and humiliated and just wanted to go eat at a friendly place and today, that was not going to happen there.",0.9819,0.785,0.12,0.094,0.48653783431180697

A friend of mine took me here - as I'm a newbie to Chicago, and was completely sick of going to ""traditional"" places for breakfast (i.e. The IHOP, Golden Nugget, etc); I was looking for a hometown homegrown restaurant to quench my ""dont-want-to-cook-at-home-this-morning"" breakfast desires.  Since I'm vegetarian, she thought this was a great place to introduce me to as she thought the menu well balanced... and she was right! I absolutely love the La Bazza Bowl and the Sweet Potato Hash, and of course my being the chocoholic... the Vegan Brownies are terrific! Everything is freshly made, hot and super delicious! In addition, on all my visits I've found the service there is very prompt and fast, and the owner is very attentive to your needs and requests as he is an owner operator. In addition, as I do know they specialize in Vegan requests, they are also very accommodating to non-veggie's as commendable by their menu and rotating specials of the day. After my first experience I even brought in my other half and he loved it too! I'll keep going back to continue trying different things on the menu until I find something I dont like... but I highly doubt that! It's not always easy catering to a Vegetarian Diet while eating out, and either your stuck with a salad or fruit bowl for breakfast etc or you go to a place that caters to Vegetarians, but the carnivorous other half doesn't get what he's craving. I found this place to be well balanced for carnivores, herbivores and omivores alike! A little something for everyone in my opinion, and that's what I like to see.

First of all, you can feel good about eating here both because it's healthy food and because they use environmentally/socially friendly ingredients.  I appreciate that, even though they have a lot of amazing vegetarian food, they offer organically produced meat-based dishes as well. I wouldn't recommend Flying Saucer for everyone.  It's kind of hippie food, I'll admit it.  Personally, I think their kale is to-die-for; but I know that's not how everyone wants to start their day.  That may be for the best, if it means I can still get a seat on Sunday morning.",0.9517,0.785,0.177,0.038,0.5333333333333334

No ""can I get you something to drink?"" No ""are you going to need a few minutes to order?"" All we received, ten minutes after being seated was ""what do you want?"" We ordered and got the pleasure of someone walking in, receiving the same poor service and commenting ""service with a smile"" in a very sarcastic voice. I was pleased. The server heard it and sneered at him.  When our order arrived the server put it down on the counter and walked away. No ""do you need anything else?"" or ""need a refill on your drinks?"" I had to get my own ketchup and hot sauce from another table as none was offered to me. The server did not come back at any point during the meal except to take away the plates and put our bill on the counter.  We walked away feeling thoroughly annoyed. I served all through college and would NEVER have given someone as crappy of service as I received. It was extremely offputting. Sure, the food is pretty good and it came out quickly.

I came here around 1:30 this Sunday knowing that the wait would be long.  They didn't give me a specific time, but instead an explanation of how many tables were almost finished.  We sat down within 40 minutes and the weather wasn't too bad outside so we didn't mind.   I came with 3 friends one of which was vegan.  I knew flying saucer was a safe place to go, but I wish they had a website with their menu on it so I could have double checked.  There were plenty of vegan options and about four or five menu items that you could make vegan by request as well as many side items that could be veganized as well.   My vegan friend ended up getting the sweet potatoe hash which was really good.  The kale seemed really freshed and was still sort of crisp after being cooked.  Really yums.  I got the breakfast bowl with vegan chorizo.  It was great!  I didn't even use the tortillas that came with it because I was too busy forking down huge bites to bother.  My husband got the caprese eggs benedict.  Also delicious.   The service was really great and the atmosphere is super friendly.  For dessert we got a vegan brownie and our waiter gave it to us on the house.  That was really nice, but the brownie wasn't.  I hate to say it but that brownie was dry, dry, dry.   I will be back!  Soon!",0.9976,0.764,0.227,0.009,0.5308858858858859

I've had actual southerners verify those cheese grits as ""really damn good,"" so you can trust them. One more reason to support this place: Flying Saucer has a great community consciousness.

While we briefly contemplated ordering ""one of everything,"" because it all looked so good, we decided on a more circumspect order. While Dan took the slightly healthier route and got a bagel with veggies and cream cheese, Abby and I decided to split the pumpkin pancakes and ricotta-stuffed French toast special, opting for the short stack in both cases.  Short stack?!? These were plentiful portions, topped with lots of delicious whipped cream. The pumpkin pancakes were fluffy and tasted ""just like pumpkin pie,"" according to Abby. The spiced apples, cinnamon, and ricotta gave the stuffed French toast a rich, satisfying flavor as well. A sublime brunch at a very reasonable price! The only negative part of the experience was that we were seated at a table right in the doorway, which meant everyone else had to sort of climb around us to come and go.

The food wasn't exactly cold, but it wasn't hot either.  Having been a server, I could tell that what had happened was the food had been prepared and then the server had forgotten it, probably because she was too busy jawing with the guy that I think was the cook but may have in fact been a bum from off the street, and so it just sat in the window getting cold.  It was at least on the side of warm that allowed me to eat it, but I really wish I hadn't.

Shitty shitty shitty service, with an extra salty dose of sniffy attitude.

Guess what? SOS as before.   Having worked my share of brunches, etc., I know the difference between a manageble ""hum,"" vs. insane rush/crunch - ""in the weeds"" time; this was the former. There were a few open seats & tables when I was there - and it didn't matter one whit. The service S-U-C-K-E-D. Here's why:   When it takes more than 5 minutes at your table to even see a menu - SUCK. When it takes closer to 10 minutes to even be asked if you want some coffee? SUCK. When what's supposed to be hot food comes out lukewarm, with places colder than indentity theft? SUCK.   As I mentioned before, I try my best to support any food establishment adding a different style to the existing abundance of Puerto Rican and Mexican places around Humboldt Park (such as the very solid Feed on Chicago & California), but I just can't do it for this place.
