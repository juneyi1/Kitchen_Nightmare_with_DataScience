The entrees are now made fresh to order, sauces are probably previously prepared and kept hot, but the meat is all cooked fresh so it is hot and delicious when it arrives to the table. Even papadum was warm when it was set down before we ordered. I'll be back more frequently! Service from owner and manager (? or head waiter? maybe just a good quality waiter) was great.

2017-03-12,5.0,"Favorite Indian I've had in Chicago so far. Recommended to us by an Indian colleague and we weren't disappointed!  Arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday night with no reservation and were seated promptly and there were a number of tables available, by 6:30 when we were leaving the place was completely packed, so on a Saturday either get there early or be sure to make a reservation! Now for food. We were told to get the biryani and anything lamb so we combined the two and ordered the lamb biryani. We also ordered the fried shrimp as an appetizer and then asked the waiter what his favorite vegetarian dish was which he replied without hesitation the vegetable korma, so we got that (medium spice) along with a serve of naan bread. They bring out pappadums to start which some great salsas and the shrimp were nice and lightly fried so you could still taste the shrimp along with the lemon and spices. When the entrees came out we thought it looked pretty small, but I know this always is the case with Indian food, it looks tiny but somehow the bowls are never ending and you are stuffed after, which of course we were. Both dishes were amazing and complemented each other really well also. Very very happy with our meal. Service was prompt and very attentive and the atmosphere was really nice, a little more upscale (e.g roses on the table) than the places we've been to on Devon (not that I don't enjoy the casual Devon vibe also!).

2017-03-02,5.0,"Dope little spot if you wanna drop some culture on a date night. Essence has likely been the most authentic Indian food I've come across and I wasn't disappointed. The biggest disappointment is that it's located directly adjacent to Taco In A Bag and in general fuck that place. The restaurant itself is not huge but the vibe is just right. One corner kind of looks like it's part of a home and gives off an overall comfortable feeling and experience. For appetizers you can't go wrong with the veggie samosas since they are cooked perfectly and have a healthy serving of the rustic filling. The mains were chicken vindaloo, lamb palak, chicken biriyani, and garlic naan bread.  The vindaloo had some nice spice on it and was stew-like with potatoes. On the other hand the lamb palak I ordered wasn't too desirable. There were nice cuts of lamb but the spinach curry sauce visually leaves little to be desired.  It kind of looks like Mexican mole with a grit and tasted much better as leftovers.  The chicken biriyani reminds me of an Asian fried rice, just Indian style, and it's just as pleasing. I'm a rice fiend for real. The vindaloo and biriyani I'm sure would kill with shrimp as well I'm sure. And don't play yourself by not getting the garlic naan. Being near Lincoln Square puts you in a nice neighborhood here so my only advice is to be sure to walk past Taco In A Bag and go to Essence.",0.9927,0.715,0.213,0.072,0.6399292149292148

Lighting is ample, and the room was quite conversation-friendly. It made a good first impression. SERVICE: Our server was attentive, prompt and reserved, as seems to be the case in most Indian restaurants I've visited. (An amusing aspect that I've experienced in other Indian restaurants was the server pouring wine into our glasses, then capping the bottle, rather than leaving it open to breathe.) Dishes arrived in a timely manner. GOOD: We liked the onion kulcha. The wine list has a decent viariety of choices at affordable prices. The basmati rice did not disappoint.

Jhinga Karahi: Breaded and deep fried shrimp with a trio of sauces served on a delightful little rotating platter: one was green, one was a chunky onion, and one was a dark maroon. They were all pleasantly sweet and tart. The shrimp themselves were served on a separate plate on a bed of carrots and lettuce. The slight letdown with this was the small size of the shrimp. Butter Chicken (Chicken Makhani): Thanks to everyone here who recommended it; it was the best thing I've had in a while! This and the biriyani came at the same time and I was slightly disappointed with its size; however, once I really thought about it, it was just me expecting huge serving platters instead of the tiny yet packed ones they use at Essence of India. Contrary to other reviewers, I found the serving size to be pretty decent. It's an explosion of warm, savory buttery goodness upon first bite. We ordered it to be spicy and I found that it was definitely pushing my boundaries; my nose was runny the entire time! The sauce is completely awesome and every other dish was dipped in it. Lamb Biriyani: I'm eating it cold form my doggie box as I write and it's still the bomb dot com! Thick chunks of lamb in basmati rice topped with a slice of hard boiled egg. Medium spice.  Keema Naan: Naan stuffed with lamb. It was warm, crispy on the outside, soft and inviting on the inside. Either the lamb itself wasn't as audible in this dish compared to our biriyani, or it was the spice levels tinkering with my taste buds. Either way, it is a slice of heaven!!

We went on a Monday near opening, I think around 5:30pm. The hubs, three kids, and I. We were seated right away by a friendly waitress. The place is small and clean. It was empty the whole time we were there except for a few pick-ups. We ordered our food from a male waiter who wasn't friendly nor rude just there to do a job, I guess. The food arrived and was good. Chicken saag wasn't the best I've ever had but I enjoyed it. The chicken tikka masala was sweeter than I prefer but the hubby liked it. The lamb chops were excellent. We also ordered chicken biryani which was supposed to be mild/medium spice but came out extra spicy so my kids could eat it. We had to ask for plain rice and yogurt. The buttered naan was very good as well. We enjoyed the food except for the burn-your-face -off biryani meant for the kids. The two things that really bothered me about this place was one, while we were there the bartender and the friendly waitress stood by the bar and stared at us almost the whole time we were there.

I'm pretty sure the radio was set on VH1's ""Saddest Songs of Simon and Garfunkel"", and at a level just quiet enough to be on the edge of perception.  That, combined with the almost complete lack of ambient conversation, made it very difficult to relax.  That, plus the head waiter (owner?) standing at attention in the middle of the room watching the few occupied tables with an annoyed expression. The food was delivered very quickly, so points for that.  However, everything tasted as if it hadn't been tasted by the kitchen staff.  Very bland.  If the food had been amazing, it would have compensated for the atmosphere.  But small, bland portions, rice not included, etc, meh.  Meh meh meh.  We both felt much better as soon as we left, as if a pall had lifted.",-0.8127,0.781,0.1,0.119,0.5932819575060955

They also serve some sort of crisps as well, with a variety of dipping sauces (all sauces veered mild & sweet). I particularly liked the green one. For entrees, I ordered the medium-spice chicken saag (chicken & spinach in a gravy sauce), and my boyfriend ordered the spicy lamb gosht. Solid entrees, and the spice levels were spot on ( spicy means spicy...slow burn....). We ordered these dishes with basmati rice & some sort of wheat bread. I wasn't wild about the wheat bread compared to naan, because it tasted... well... very wheaty! That's my own fault, though. Not sure what I expected with that. Finally, the ambience is nice as well... comparable to Hema's kitchen in terms of coziness. Overall, I'm glad we finally tried this place.

I was so hungry and it was so bad I couldn't even eat it. Also, for $12 they do not include rice or anything. Just a small bowl of nasty, flavorless goo. My fiancé got lamb and it was overcooked, but his wasn't nearly as bad as mine. I should also mention that we were not greeted until we had been seated for about five minutes, no drinks or anything.

He didn't ask if I wanted anything else, he just took the bowl away and the saag remained on our check.

When I visit with everyday Americans I get better service too.  LoL, WTF, maybe my beard is intimidating, I dunno.  But I won't harp much on that, it's not worth it.  I return for the food and the clean atmosphere because unlike much of their competition on Devon Ave, this place is a LOT cleaner.  Next time your in a restaurant lay your (bare) arm across your table space, you'll know what I mean instantly.  Hopefully things don't change for me, I've been lucky to eat great every time.  Also, I like that they offer levels of heat or spice, rather.  At times I find it hard to relate with the guy to make my meals spicy.  He'll ask me questions that, kind of, don't make any sense and we end up going back and forth on spice level.  The good thing is, they usually get it.  So, a few spoons into my curry, I've got a good stream of sweat pouring down my scalp.  I'm completely fine with that.",0.9872,0.796,0.142,0.062,0.5051917989417989

I have to say that overall we had a great time and enjoyed our time here but it was definitely not the best Indian food I've ever had. It's nice that they take open table reservations which might be a good thing on a busy Saturday night. The place has a pleasant atmosphere with a nice amount of space in between tables which is always a plus since I hate being right next to my neighbors to the point where I can hear their entire conversation.

Speaking of food, because that is why I came here. Like I said I just wasn't overly impressed. It was tasty but nothing that made me say, ""this is remarkable or amazing."" We decided to try the butter chicken which is apparently the signature dish here consisting of Tandoori chicken simmered in tomato sauce, butter and spices. When asked how we wanted it cooked, we said mild, but I hated it mild. I should have definitely said a little spicy because it felt like a dessert dress with more of a sugary taste instead of what I'm used to in a chicken tikka massala which is what I would order next time. I guess I'm more about the orange curries over the red ones even though the red can be as equally delicious as long as I get it on the spicier side. Then our friends made us get the chicken biryani dish because they swear it's the best one they ever had. This I felt was tasty but the pieces of chicken were huge and I wish they spent more time making them smaller since they were overwhelming in comparison to the rice. The flavors were there and we definitely liked it more than the butter chicken but it's not the best I've ever had. They do, however, have fantastic naan here, on the chewier side which I definitely recommend and a few portions to dip into your curries.

It was busy but there were 2-3 tables open so no wait and service remained prompt and friendly throughout. I asked my server for a recommendation between 2 dishes I was eying and he steered me to the lamb biriyani, a great choice: big chunks of lamb, which were very tender, in a flavorful rice dish. And what really made it come alive was adding the raita, a yogurt based sauce which came with it. When I commented on this combination, my server gave me a quick oral recipe for raita, and made me think for a moment that I could actually make this myself at home. Ha!

2014-03-22,4.0,"When my favorite Indian restaurant on Devon closed down, I was heartbroken. But then I tried Essence of India, and I feel as though I've been given a second chance at love.  My husband and I went here for dinner on Valentine's Day. We made a reservation ahead of time for 7:30 p.m. We were able to find parking relatively easily, though this can be a challenge in this area.  When we got inside the restaurant, all but one of the tables was taken. We got the last table, which of course was in the worst location. It was right by the door, so not only was it cold but people standing around waiting for a table were basically looming over us. Then, of course, a couple came in after us that didn't have a reservation, and they were seated within moments at a nice cozy table in back. Oh well, c'est la vie.  Anyway, our experience got much better from there. They gave us that crispy wafer-like bread (I don't know what it's called) along with various sauces and chutney. Really tasty. For food, we ordered three different dishes and shared them between the two of us. In addition to wine, Naan and rice, here's what we got:  - We got the Shahi Paneer. This had cottage cheese cubes in a cashew, tomato and cream sauce. This was amazing. So creamy! We absolutely loved it!  - We also ordered the Murg Tikka Masala, which is basically chicken in a creamy sauce. Delicious!  - We also got an order of the Shrimp in Coconut Masala. It was OK. It's a sour dish and just didn't have the same great flavors that the other two that we ordered did. I wouldn't order this again.   We were pretty stuffed after all of that, but we still had some food left to take home. We also ordered two mango lassis to go, which were a nice way to end the meal. Overall, this was a great Valentine's Day dinner. I defiantly want to go back when it's less crowded, like when it's not Valentine's Day. I feel like we would get a better table and better service.

Overall, I don't think the food was worth the price.  Two entrees, add rice, add a paratha, and now its $45 for two people without drinks.  Personally, I have higher expectations if I'm spending $20/person vs $10-12, and I don't think this was worth it.  Next time I want Indian food I think I will go to Paprika.",0.9738,0.817,0.164,0.019,0.46315789473684205

2013-11-18,1.0,"My wife and I really like Indian food and having just moved back to Chicago, we were eager to find a good Indian restaurant in our area. Yesterday we tried out Essence of India and called for delivery. Unfortunately, Essence of India was one of the worst Indian food experiences we've ever had. The first warning sign was the delivery time. When we called, they told us that it would take about 45 minutes which seemed reasonable for delivery. However, the delivery guy showed up just 20 minutes after we called. We live about 10 minutes driving distance away, so this meant that Essence of India only needed 10 minutes to get our order ready! We know that a restaurant doesn't cook everything from scratch after you place your order, but in this case it was clear that there was no fresh cooking involved at all! Just taking pre-cooked stuff and putting it into delivery containers. We always order the same 2 dishes at every Indian restaurant we go to: saag charman and murg tikka masala. We love these dishes and by always ordering them, we have established a good reference point for comparing restaurants. Unfortunately, the quality of these 2 dishes from Essence of India was among the worst we've ever tasted. 1. The spinach in the saag charman had been pureed into oblivion and all that was left was a watery dark-green sauce with little spinach taste left. 2. The tikka masala sauce was also watery and the chicken was dry - which is not surprising I guess given that it must have been sitting there for a while. We were unable to finish eating the dishes and ended up heating up frozen Indian entrees from Trader Joe's that we had in our freezer. It's sad to see that a frozen Indian entree was better than restaurant Indian food from Essence of India. Add to this that Essence of India is not a cheap place (e.g., rice needs to be ordered separately) and we'll have to continue our quest to find a good Indian restaurant.

There's something wrong if you get bland food at an Indian restaurant. We both asked to make our food hot. Um.. either the server mixed up his instructions or what we got is the hottest they can make their food, which wasn't hot at all. My friend was furious  - and rightly so, since he's Indian and he thinks they misrepresented Indian food.  We will certainly never go back to this restaurant nor encourage our friends to do so.

But we ordered two Indian beers, vegetable samosas, butter naan, rice, butter chicken, and I believe the murg tikki masala. As you guys read, they give you a little crunchy naan like thing (I have no idea what it is) and a few chutneys. Those are good, although one of them is unbelievably salty.  All of the dishes that we ordered were really good, but the star was the butter chicken. AMAZING. I never knew I can enjoy Indian food this much. The murg tikki masala was yummy too but the butter chicken was just so buttery and savory.  I craved the butter chicken after that so much I had to go back! That time I tried the lamb pasanda or palak and butter chicken. The lamb was good, although it was like dark green in color and definitely didn't look appetizing. But again. THE BUTTER CHICKEN WON.

2012-06-12,4.0,"After trying a few Indian restaurants on Devon when I was a student at Loyola I was surprisingly sorely disappointed. After recently moving to Ravenswood, I happened across Essence of India and thought I'd give it a go. I arrived around 7:45 on a Monday night and there was literally NO ONE in the restaurant... the wait staff was just hanging out by the bar waiting for someone to come in. This was a little awkward (and typically a bad sign!), but I was determined to have some delicious Indian food. The waiter was very friendly and gave us a few moments to look over the menu. I've tried a wide variety of Indian food, so I was comfortable with trying out one of their ""Lamb Essence"" dishes, the Josh Rogan. My dad, on the other hand, was freaking out because he couldn't find his go-to Indian dish, Lamb Madras. I asked the waiter if they had something similar on the menu, to which he gave a prompt no to. After my dad hemming and hawing of the menu for another 10 minutes, the waiter came back and said they'd make the Lamb Madras for my dad. That took me by surprise, and I was happy that they were so accommodating. The food took about 20 minutes to come out, which I take to be a good sign meaning that it's somewhat, if not completely, made to order. While we waited we were served Indian ""chips"" and a variety of chutneys. Their mango/jalapeno salsa was quite spicy, but it was balanced out by the mint and sweeter chutney. I enjoyed these as you could tell they were homemade and fresh. When the entrees came out I was pretty pleased with the dish. It had a nice spice to it when ordered medium, and it built up as I was working my way through. A few pieces of the lamb were tough/fatty, but some of the pieces were extremely succulent and melted in my mouth--the way lamb should be! I finished about two thirds of my dish and was absolutely stuffed. You could definitely get two entrees and share between three people with 1 or 2 sides of rice (which unfortunately you must order separately).  Considering this restaurant is dangerously close to my apartment, I will definitely be back and up for trying some of their other entrees.",0.9939,0.8,0.151,0.049,0.5956989247311827

The waiter was fine, but needs to learn how to smile, or make people feel more welcome.  My boyfriend was undecided between two dishes and ask for a recommendation and got nothing.  He decided on a lamb dish, myself a vegetarian dish.  We also got the vegetarian sampler, a rice dish, garlic naan and mango lassis.   We were brought a plata of papadum and various chutneys and their papadums are amazing with the cilantro mint chutney, or I was really hungry!  The mango lassis were good, but came in tall, narrow glasses with ice so not worth it.  The food was okay.  The Kashmiri rice, which we've had someplace else, was a bit dry, small and just not that good.  Our entree dishes were fine.  The garlic naan was awful!  It was cold, had garlic only in the middle and the garlic was probably the jarred stuff.  Was very difficult to eat. We had lots of leftovers which is fine, but when we got home I realized that they didn't give us our leftover naan.  That's half an order that they threw away!  And I could have fixed it at home and made it decent.  And we were never asked if we wanted dessert, which we might have....  We were handed our bill with out leftovers. I brought my leftovers to work and the container opened up during transit, fine, but when I went to reclose the lid the container broke!

The most egregious moment was when I tasted the garlic naan, which came to us, cold and damp, hardly edible at all.  I took a bite and left it to take home and put in the oven to reheat it.  But they didn't even have the courtesy to put it in our leftovers bag.  Their Kashmir rice was greasy and nowhere as good as we've had it at another Indian restaurant (The Little India on Bryn Mawr).  Their mango lassi comes in small glasses (not very tall and not very wide round, maybe 6 oz.). Their serving sizes were small. We ordered their vegetable appetizers (which my girlfriend had to ask if they were actually vegetarian, as she saw something that was questionable;  the waiter informed us they were in a very harsh damage control sort of way, after we had asked the friendly busboy if he knew).  I ordered lamb saag (spicy), however, I had a less than pleasant moment in the restroom as their food made me immediately sick.

It's more formal than most Indian places (not stuffy but you tend to see people on dates rather than families coming in for meals) and more expensive than what you'll find on Devon but I like to think of it as a convenience charge for not having to take 2 buses north.  They charge extra for rice, which I hate so much. So much. Do you really expect me to eat my butter chicken with a spoon or something? It's like charging extra for tortillas when you order fajitas. The cost to you is negligible and it's basically a part of the meal anyway. I can rant about Indian restaurants charging for rice all day.

Everything was excellent. My friend's husband & I split 2 veggie dishes while she & my husband did the meat dishes.  We started with some drinks & samosas (which are huge...easily split).  For dinner I tried vegetable korma for the first time, and it was very nice.  Medium turned out not to be spicy at all, so I'd probably go hot next time, but it was very tasty.  I also tried something from the new menu, a dish of potatoes & green beans.  It was not a spicy dish, and actually had a mild sweetness to it, like carmelized onions.  It was really good!  I'd definitely order that again.  The meat-eaters had chicken sag, which they requested be extra spicy--which it was-- and the rogan josh.  By both accounts both dishes were delicious.  In addition to all that food (if you can beleive it) we got an order of vegetable biriyani & the bread assortment with the 4 types of bread-- peshwari naan,  garlic naan, onion kulcha, and pudina paratha.  I'm a bread-lover & this did not disappoint.  It was great to try a couple varieties at once.

2010-11-22,5.0,"Another local gem that I hadn't visited in the 3+ years I have lived in Lincoln Square. Man, I suck.  Food: I had the butter chicken. Although it came out in a weird neon red-orange color, I wasn't fazed.....I ate the whole thing despite the fact that I could have made two or three meals of it. Whoops. I guess that is all you need to know about how good the food tasted. Although some may consider the price a little high (think $10-$20), if you don't eat it all like a gluttonus pig, you will have enough for at least one additional meal. Drinks: They have some cool Indian beers that I have never heard of before. They're pretty decent, and cheap to boot. Can't argue with that! It's not the selection of say, Fiddlehead Cafe (across the street), but they don't pretend to be a bar with a huge beer list, so it's all good. Service: Waters filled promptly, quick ordering and plate clearing, and a very short wait for the food to come out. Sweet. Seriously, every time I go to an Indian place it seems like the service is a million times better than regular Joe-American place X. Ambiance: I liked the interior a lot. It was dark in there, but not too dark. It's a little small inside but we still had no wait for a party of five.  Misc: I used the men's bathroom and noticed that the toilet is literally right up against the wall. I cannot imagine anyone actually having to sit on that thing. How would that work? You'd have to side-saddle it or something. I only had to pee so I didn't have to figure it out for myself, thankfully.

Last time I was there, I had the Murg Lajwab and it was just as great the next day for lunch.

2010-11-14,4.0,"For over 2 years we have walked by this place and said, ""We should definitely come here sometime."" And this weekend we finally made it out to Essence of India after living in the neighborhood for a couple of years - shame on us! However, I now fear that I will frequently be returning, and I will be heavier and poorer for it. We came here on a Saturday night with some friends and the atmosphere was very pleasant. The dining area is cozy (in a good way, not a packed way) - great for a group or for a dinner date for two - and the interior features a very tasteful typical Indian décor.  Also, good views of the heart of Lincoln Square. I first tried the complementary crispy cracker-like item (someone please enlighten me - I have no idea what it's called) and 3 sauces to dip it in.  The green sauce is AMAZING - such a unique blend of sweet/sour/spicy goodness.  For dinner, I opted for one of their spiciest options, the chicken vindaloo.  It was very flavorful and the sauce had just the right amount spice that I was looking for (I could have handled something spicier, however this was just right -- not overly spiced where I could no longer taste the flavor).  The portion size was okay, although the potatoes were more plentiful than the chicken.  I enjoyed the really neat kettle-type dishes the meals were presented in (yes, I pay attention to these things.)  Oh, and the naan, my God the naan. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. Perhaps because I'm a carb addict. It was so good that we had to order several baskets.  While there are a variety of flavors, we ordered the plain naan and it was warm, crispy, goodness. It was great to dip in your food or to devour on its own.  The service was fast and friendly, and not at all overbearing.  So why not 5 stars?  * Pricy for Indian food - without any drinks & smallish-portions, expect to pay $20+ per person; * Adding to the price, surprisingly the rice is not included with the meal. However, the rice you do order is good and plentiful (two sides of rice sufficed for 5 people).  Based on our experience and all of the reviews on here, I think they should consider including the rice with the meals as the dishes are already pricey. The prices however will not keep me away; I will definitely be back. I can't wait until it gets warm out and we get to enjoy some tasty Indian food on their outdoor patio.

I did not feel my 6 ounces of hurricane was worth $9. Next, the food. We ordered the butter chicken, which was tasty but a little too bland even for my taste (and I am not a huge fan of spice). The lamb biryani was especially disappointing... it definitely seemed to lack some key flavors. And several pieces of lamb had huge chunks of fat on them, ew!  The service was also a little strange. I was there on a Saturday night and about half of the tables were still full. The staff of 4-5 waiters stood in the corner near the buffet and stared at everyone while they ate. On the one hand, this made for VERY fast service... the second anyone twitched, a waiter would swoop down to the table. But on the other hand, it was a little strange and it made me feel like I had to rush through my meal. I would have understood if we were there near closing or something... but when I come to a restaurant a full hour before closing on a weekend, I don't want to be rushed!

Protip #2 for Indian Buffets:  Fresh Naan and Tandori Chicken brought to your table is the sign of an establishment that cares.

Decor:  The decor was nice enough, but the tables we packed closely together and I had to weave past many filled chairs to reach the buffet. Service:  It was prompt and friendly. Price:  $11 for a lunch buffet is about right for the neighborhood. Food:  Everything was either cold and/or tasted like it was made many hours ago (an unfortunate reality in unpopular buffets).  The only original dish I tried was a vegetable medley with mustard, and I didn't like it.  Their potato and eggplant dish was just tasteless mush.  Their tandoori chicken was tasty, but it had been sitting on a hot serving dish and the onions were dried up, so I didn't think it was terribly fresh.  The naan was chewy and cold.  The worst was the veggie pakora (battered and deep fried vegetable clump).  It was cold and soggy with oil. They didn't have Chicken Tikka Masala or any kind of Paneer dish.  These two are pretty serious staples for me, but it was our fault for not inspecting the buffet before we committed.

2010-01-10,1.0,"Some of the reviews for this place makes me wonder if Chicagoans know what real Indian food tastes like. I have a deep love for Indian cuisine. Done well, it almost tops Japanese as my favourite culinary adventure. Having lived near Lincoln Square for over a year, Essence of India was a natural destination for the regular Indian food cravings that hit me every so often, cost be damned. I've eaten here three times now, and have been sorely disappointed with each visit. Here's a run-down; * Naan should be crisp, flaky, hot, and a little oily. Not doughy and bland. And if you sell garlic naan for $2.95, for God's sake, please use fresh garlic - not that mass-produced shit out of a jar. * Samosas should not be dry, devoid of flavour, and lacking those famous Indian spices. If you're going to make them the size of a baby head, then at least do them right. I enjoyed the sad little rubbish heap of limp salad it was presented on, though - very artistic. * If your customer is unfortunate enough to be seated alone in an empty restaurant, it kinda unnerves them somewhat if you sit and stare directly at them with a glazed expression for the entirety of their meal. * Chai can be amazingly good, even better when you serve it in an adult-sized cup for your adult-sized price. It's also nice when you offer honey to go with it instead of the less traditional Sweet-n-low. * What the hell is going on with places that charge extra for rice, as though it is a side dish? For $3.95 you can have this apparently optional accessory for your $12.00 curry, made fresh but complete with little clusters of yesterday's rice.  Speaking of curry prices, I typically go for the vegetable-based curries when eating Indian food, but I balk at paying $10+ for a vegetarian dish (I know full well that Indian is one of the more expensive cuisines, and truly understand why, but this is utter lunacy). So - after figuring I'd give them another shot and reading the mixed reviews here - I ordered the butter chicken. Big mistake, unless you live for bland chunks of tandoor chicken floating in a sickly sweet day-glo pink coconut sauce, void of any real spicing or (imperative to Indian food) depth of flavour. Then, gentle reader, be prepared to fork out $25 (incl. tip) for one person, for one sorry meal. This was with the lunchtime special of 20% off.  What disturbed me most was the complete lack of aroma. I've both gifted and assaulted my stomach with Indian food from across the world, and one of the most beautiful, pornworthy reasons for doing so is that dense, rich, incredible scent wafting from the meal placed before you. Indian food is a treasure, an art form, a labour-intensive act of love. Not so here, and how terribly depressing. You guys are meant to be at the top rung of spice-wrangling genius. You kinda break my heart.  I give you one star for a fairly good mint chutney, Essence of India, but woman can not live on chutney alone. Three strikes and you're out.

So, my husband and I had a lunch date for Saturday and the first thing that popped in my head was mmmmm....INDIAN!  We didn't feel like trekking to Devon, so I did a little search for someplace closer to Logan Square. Essence is in Lincoln Square and those Squares need to stick together. We started with the vegetable sampler, which was advertised as a samosa (MINE!), a vegetable cutlet and a vegetable pakora. What we actually got was TWO of each item, plus some extra unidentified breaded vegetables, plus some supplementary raw veg and another mystery breaded item (which was delicious).  The sad part was, the samosa wasn't the best I've ever had. It kind of reminded me of a mini potato pie. The crust was a little omnipresent. But, I was hungry... For entrees, I got the saag paneer (they called it something different, sag chaman?) I was asked if I wanted it mild or medium spicy, I said, ""bring it on, I can take the heat!"" My husband got the Paneer Khurchan, non spicy. And a side of garlic naan. Unfortunately, we stuffed ourselves on the apps and the complimentary poppadums so our entrees packed the punch of a tiny kitty fist. My saag was indeed VERY spicy, but it was really strangely textured, pureed to an almost puddinglike consitency. This was redeemed by the fact that they didn't skimp on the paneer (like a lot of places do). Unfortunately, I think I actually liked my husband's more.  All in all, we had enough food left over to reheat for dinner and I ended up enjoying my saag more the second time around, in front of the TV, in my jammies.",0.6889,0.896,0.058,0.046,0.5007642998027614

Sadly, this place was a  major disappointment.  One girl didn't like spicy things, and asked for no spice, no spice at all, and we joked with the waitress about sucking out all the flavor from her dish.  Ironically, her Tandoori chicken turned out to be the tastiest dish we ordered. Dal makhani, and chicken saag, ordered medium spicy, were compeletely flavorless except for the pepper.  Not that the pepper killed all the other flavors...they were just MIA. Normally, I am of the school of thought that says any food I leave on my plate is actively robbing a starving Ethiopian child, but this dal makhani was so bad that I sadly patted my high horse and abandoned it.   The dish would be happier in their garbage than mine.

I don't get it because I have only had good experiences with the food (I always order take out). One of the signature dishes I get at any Indian restaurant is a korma dish. And the vegetable korma here is one of my favorites that I have found in the city.  Now, there are going to be those who claim to get good Indian food you have to go to Devon. Well, my trips to Devon have always been a bit disappointing (Udupi Palace, Hema's Kitchen, and Bhabi's Kitchen) Often, I found the dishes oddly prepared (full boned chicken in the chicken korma, green vegetable korma, etc.), very oily, and extremely spicy. I actually like some spice, but what's the point of so much heat that it's overpowering? I actually like to taste my food! My wife can't take spicy food at all, and no one on Devon seems to understand the request for mild.  At Essence of India, you can request a spicy level of mild and actually expect that. One reviewer mentioned that when they ordered medium it was still mild. However, I find my medium dishes to be pushing the hot level. So you might want to approach with caution according to how much you can take.  The price level is not that much over other Indian restaurants in the city. And if you order take out, dishes are typically ready in twenty minutes. Does Essence of India deserve 5 stars? Well, I might be guilty for over starring, but that's only because I'm determined to see Essence's average rise for proving consistently good food and fast service.

2006-10-05,4.0,"BUFFET Essence of India has one of the best Sunday buffets I've ever buffed. For the size of restaraunt, the selection is perfect.  There's enough there to get plenty of dishes you enjoy, but small enough that you can try everything.  I lament I am unable to expound the gastronomic virtues of each dish, so you'll forgive me if I advise you plainly:  The food tastes fantastic. NON BUFFET Its a touch pricier than I had expected, but you can't begrudge cost when the food and service are so good.  The girlfriend and I ordered separate ""essences"" and each shared an order of rice. SERVICE Truly excellent.  Unlike a number of places in the city, these people seem genuinely happy to see you.  The staff are polite and understand that not everyone has a PhD in Indian food.  They'll explain everything and make suggestions without making you feel like an outsider. An altogether satisfying experience.  Be sure to save room for a mango lassi for desert. :)",0.9954,0.685,0.295,0.02,0.6778769841269842
2006-10-02,1.0,"After running by this place nearly every week on my way to Montrose beach for my marathon training, or to take my dog Max-a-Million to the dog park, my girlfriend and I were really excited about going to the Essence of India for dinner.  We went on a Saturday night and the decor was really nice, and the service was adequate, however the quality of the food was horrible (and I don't consider myself to be a picky eater). I ordered a lamb dish with a spinach sauce, and the quality of the lamb was horrible.  The pieces of lamb were cut into small bite-size chunks, however it was loaded with fat and gristle, I couldn't even eat the pieces.  Disappointed with my dish, I would have been fine with not ordering the lamb again, however I was shocked yet again when I went to reheat my left-overs the next day.  When I opened the dish, I found a small white textured item in my food.  I'm not sure what it was, and I really don't want to jump to any conclusions but the white item certainly did not look like a piece of rice.  Needless to say, I ended up feeding the left overs to my garbage disposal since I was too frightened by the food to eat it myself, or even feed it to my trusty dog, Max-a-Million. If you choose to go to the Essence of India, please take my advice, and stick with the chicken.",0.025,0.856,0.068,0.076,0.5471825396825396
2006-08-13,4.0,"This Indian restaurant has a nice corner location at Lincoln and Wilson, an interior that is cute but not too fussy, and a substantial menu that features several ""essence"" categories (vegetable, chicken, lamb, tandoor). Unlike the typical Indian buffet restaurants, the a la carte selections limit you in one sense but improve on the quality of the dishes themselves. The lamb palak featured chunks of lamb bathed not only in spinach but also in a complex secondary layer of ginger, garlic, and coriander. Other selections are labeled as spicy if you want to go that route. Saffron rice goes well with the dishes here, but again this is an extra cost. The breads are good, and I enjoyed a refreshing Indian beer too. For a better value meal here, I might have to try the weekend buffet here.",0.9805,0.804,0.196,0.0,0.6017857142857144

2006-07-27,3.0,"I ate here last night for the first time.  I'll go back at some point, prolly to try the lunch buffet, but I'd just as likely check out another spot.  The peshwari naan that we ordered was awesome.  My mushroom mutter was very good as was the basmati rice.  I thought it was a little weird that rice didn't come with the entrees, especially if you're paying $11 for a bowl of curried mushrooms and peas, but yeah, whatever.  It was still very tasty.  The service was incredibly prompt.  So much so that we had to ask three times for another minute because apparently us studying the menu wasn't enough of an indication that no, we weren't ready to order yet.  On the plus side, the food arrived superquick.   I wish I had noticed the outdoor seating area prior to popping a squat inside  because it would have added to the experience.",0.9045,0.855,0.101,0.044,0.526875
2006-06-18,4.0,"I really like Essence of India. While they are a little more expensive than I would like, I do think their food is superior to most other restaurants. The saag is killer and malai ka kofta (cottage cheese and potato, dried fruit and spices in tomato and cream sauce) is one of my favorites. Everyone there is friendly and attentive. They have a lunch buffet on the weekends that is cheaper than their dinners and gives you the opportunity to try a variety of different items.",0.9116,0.767,0.188,0.045,0.5704545454545454
2006-04-21,2.0,"Again, having just moved here from a minor midwestern city, I am not impressed with Essence of India- mainly for the price.  I have had buffet Indian food for much, much, less, and yet it dominated Essence in quality.  I have a feeling that much better quality Indian food can be found in the Devon Avenue area (about 10 mintes from this location).  That having been said, if you're interested in an expensive Indian meal with fabulous service, Essence is the place for you.  The ambiance/surroundings are perfect, and the service is fast and attentive.    Enjoy Essence of India!",0.9342,0.811,0.165,0.024,0.6083333333333333
