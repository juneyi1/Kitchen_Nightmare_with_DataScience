The last time we went there, it was 5:45 in the morning. It is Anand's favourite place and he makes it a point to introduce it to all our friends, and affectionately calls it Abdullah Bhai's place!  They do not have a fixed menu, but you can look at the dishes for the day by the array of display as you walk in. Easily 8 curries per day (both vegetarian and non vegetarian) which can be enjoyed with fresh rotis. The rotis are great and really big! Generous portions. Another favourite is the Idly they serve, it also goes really well with the very tasty coconut chutney.  The food is a tad bit oily for my liking, but it tastes great. We never miss out on the Idly, Samosas and Chai anytime we are there. Definitely a place that makes me happy, I recommend!!",0.9962,0.707,0.293,0.0,0.5485294117647058

Some sits in warm chafing dishes, other food just sits in the open. This is not sanitary, let alone legal.

I ordered Frontier Chicken, said to be the place's ""specialty."" Most of my chicken contained fat and bones, although the sauce was at least tasty.

They give two whole chicken legs, which is rare to be seen..most places will give only one leg that skimps out on the meat, and it's also served with fresh naan and the raita mentioned above and a side of salad. All that for only 10 bucks.  It's neat how they have a different menu each day with some of the more popular items available everyday. I've been there twice and saw chicken biryani and the tikka available but saw different items I could order each time. They have specials for each day as well. The second time I went, I took my friend along with me. He loves to munch down on food even though he may not have the most eclectic appetite. Quantity is always an issue for him, however I can say that Flaming Wok 'n Grill surely filled him up. We took two appetizers -- two samosas and an order of pakora, and for the main course we had two naans with one order of chicken tikka and one order of chicken biryani (it was a little dry) but delicious nonetheless, and of course it came with raita and salad. All of this cost about 27 dollars. It was well worth our money and time.  The restaurant may look shady from the exterior and the seating or decoration isn't too great inside. It is however open 365 24/7 and you'll see a lot of taxi cabs standing outside all the time. But please do step inside to have their food because it'll be a shame if you don't give it a try. Sure you can go to Devon to have Indian-Pakistani foods but there you won't get the friendly, one-to-one easy-going, homely vibe from their owners and/or staff there. The manager of the restaurant came to my table personally and was very polite and asked if we needed anything and told us to let him know if we had any questions.  Lastly, this place is Zabihah Halal as it clearly says on the windows. If you're Muslim, it's also nice to know that they have prayer accomodations inside and they hold Jummah prayer as well. There's also plenty of parking on the street across from the restaurant.",0.9893,0.849,0.123,0.028,0.5840909090909091
2013-10-07,4.0,"Don't bother with their online menu (on their website and Grubhub). It lists the dishes they have according to the day of the week but it is not accurate. While it is true that dishes here rotate daily, the best thing to do is to walk in with an open mind and look/ask what items they have for the day. If you're ordering for delivery, I suggest you call them and ask them what's cooking for that day instead of looking at the online menu on Grubhub because that is inaccurate. Such is how this old-school Pakistani/Indian diner operates. If you can overlook this, this place offers you a very authentic and no-frills experience. I like this place a lot. Majority of their customers are cabbies and we all know that cabbies flock to authentic joints. The day's curries and food are placed in metal trays behind the counter and customers peek over to see what they have that day and place their orders. The lady then scoops them onto a plate (or box, for take out). For those who complained about ""food already sitting out"" on the counter, well, this is how it's done in many parts of Asia and even in Turkey. It's a very common concept where vendors or restaurants cook pot loads of dishes and put them in metal trays for customers to pick what they'd like to have for their meal. I felt like I was in Asia again with this true down-to-earth experience. We've tried the lamb korma, chicken frontier, and vegetable dish. Really enjoyed them all and can't wait to return on another day for other dishes. Update: Returned for a second visit and tried the chicken tandoori masala, aloo gobi, vegetable briyani, chicken korma, samosa, and pakora.

My roommate who does speak the language called and ran into the similar situation. After the communication struggle, the order was placed and a set time was given for pickup (because they don't deliver...go figure). When I got there (a few minutes late on purpose) the order was not still ready and had to wait another 15 minutes. I know that the worker felt bad for the delay and he was kind enough to give me some sweets while I waited. Once we got the good home and served it, we found the quality to be mediocre.

They charge $5 for delivery which is higher than the others in the area. Their estimated processing time is 1.5 hours and on top of that they are at least 20 more mins late every single time!  What is most bizarre is that every time we have received food different than what we order. Sometimes they will call us to say ""we are out of butter chicken. we are sending you frontier instead"". but sometimes, they dont even tell us and change the order!! I find this so odd that I don't even know what to say. Yesterday, instead of 3 orders of pakodas, we received 3 samosas. When I asked the person he said ""oh if we run out, we send samosas"". First, I would have ordered samosas if that is what I wanted and 2nd, how about freakin letting your customer know that you are sending something different? Not once have they compensated in any way for the inconvenience. I should have paid attention to their long list of 1-star rating on grubhub!

It came in two varieties, differently spiced, with a bowl of lentil soup, chickpeas, and several pieces of naan. We ordered at about 1:15. We sat at a table for about five minutes, but were asked to move. The staff moved all the tables and chairs to one end of the dining room and began to clean the floor. My friend and I sat at the counter and watched as prayer mats were laid on the floor. At about 1:30, after our food arrived, we watched as several men entered, removed their shoes, and began to participate in a Muslim prayer. The guy next to me explained that it was the Islamic Sabbath. The restaurant had become a mosque, and by the time my friend and I finished our very good meal, about twenty men were praying towards Mecca. One man chanted some prayers, and incense was lit, the smoke wafting over our seats. My friend and I didn't want to be disrespectful, but seeing that other people at the counter kept eating, we did as well. We continued our conversation quietly, but one guy had a reasonably loud conversation on his phone, food kept being cooked with a loud sizzle, and diners came and went as the prayer service continued. I wish we had known that the Flaming Wok n' Grill became a mosque on Friday afternoons. It's an odd environment to eat lunch in, however good the food is.

Nearly everyday they have fresh made biryani, a rice dish that takes several hours to make. It is really good.

I guess there's a menu, but it's not worth bothering with.  Food's better in the evening when the turnover is high, and you should stick to the dishes of the day.  Ask for a plate of everything, it's worth it.  There are things that show up that I've never seen elsewhere, and the cab drivers who make it their hangout seem to know and love them by heart.  I encourage you to keep an eye out for mirch pakora (that is, battered and fried green chilies) with a brown filling, rather than a potato one.  The taste is incredible, and the filling is vegetarian, despite seeming otherwise. Some of the cab drivers I spoke to said they thought the food sucks, but it sounded like that's mostly a regional thing.  I feel some pity for the owner because it's a pain to get to the place with the bridge being closed and all the nearby construction.  But once you're there, you won't have any trouble finding a cab to get you back wherever you're going next. I was passing through Chicago from the west coast to the east by train and was taking a brief respite in the Near North.  The place had the kind of comments on Foursquare that made it seem like it might be something special, so I swung by, and it was.  Two weeks later, headed in the other direction, I went out of my way and rushed around frantically to find time to stop by.  There's so many things I want to eat in Chicago, that I won't find easily elsewhere, but I can't really imagine not making time to stop in here.  It's comfort food, it's well done, it's eclectic, and it's friendly.  And the owner doesn't mind helping you figure out who's willing to take a quick fare to Union Station at the end of a mellow meal. If you don't like the gritty cafeterias of poor neighborhoods in big cities with loads of cab drivers, I guess you should stay away, but none of those things will hurt you.  If you order food you think of as Indian, the kind of stuff you'd find in any mediocre Punjabi restaurant, you might be disappointed.  If you let the owner, the chef, or you eyes guide you, and order what people who know the cuisine would, and eat it with paratha or chapati rather than naan, you'll almost certainly leave happy. Some things are a miss, and that's always going to be the case in a place so dynamic, catering to such a wide variety of palates, from such a broad set of regional cuisines.  So get a little of everything and try not to mind too much if one thing among many sucks.",0.9747,0.794,0.124,0.082,0.47157380952380945

The reviews that are super critical of Flaming Wok I think just don't get it. If hole-in-the wall type, genuine Indian-style service isn't what you're looking for, you really have a number of other typical Americanized Indian restaurants right down the street where you won't get whatever just ruffled your feathers here. I also recommend coming here to take advantage of its 24 hour open doors. I went from around 3-4AM on a Sunday morning to see the place pleasantly packed.  Yes, there is no menu on display, but as my roommate and I looked lost, the owner beckoned us over to the counter. Yes he showed us the area where the food sat out, warming and did ask if we've had Indian food before (more polite than not, if you ask me - how's he to know?). He pointed out what was what, and suggested a few. We didn't know how much anything would cost, but I'm sure if you asked he wouldn't have lied. If you didn't care to ask, I don't see anyone getting indignant over $7-8 food that comes in heaping portions. The naan is indeed amazing, and whatever two things we pointed to were also delicious. At the end of our meal he asked if we wanted some salad, brought it over, and told us he'd be right back with something he thought we'd like. This was after he'd brought us our check. He returned with what the place calls ""Frontier Chicken"" that, despite our stuffed bellies, was really great. I told my friend that all the chicken in our dishes was probably the most tender and moist for its price that I had ever had. Really - everything has been cooking for so long it falls right off the bone. The man actually also served us himself, telling us to sit down when I got up to get some glasses of water. What I really loved about the place: The fact that the sort of uncomfortable smell of spices and maybe even a little grime just hits you in the face as you walk in. The place was crowded with people you could tell visited the place often. Why? most of the patrons reached over the counter with their plates and served themselves. The table next to me was full of four men eating with their hands (how it's done in the motherland) - always amazes me how well they can clean up their plates! A man next to us told us he hadn't seen us around before, and then urged us to take a delivery menu home with us. So, you may have to serve yourself with your own utensils, napkins, and water glasses (who hasn't done that before). You may find the smell a little funky, and the place not immaculate. You may not have a menu with prices, or 4 star table side service, and might now even know what you're eating.

2010-11-14,2.0,"Two stars on Yelp means ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""  My experience isn't quite so stellar, but anything less than two seems really harsh.  I'd love for a late night authentic Indian delivery place to succeed, so I hope I can change this review one day to a higher rating. I was craving some Indian food late one Saturday midnight after an ill timed nap, and Grubhub told me that Flaming Wok was the only place delivering.  I'm still an Indian food newbie, so I don't know what to order, but I do know I like some butter chicken.  The guy who answered told me they were out of butter chicken, so I told him to pick whatever he thought was good under the conditions that it isn't too spicy, and knowing I love me some butter chicken, and up to $20.  He did exactly that, and threw in some extras too, which had me really excited as I waited for the delivery to show with my Indian food presents.  All together with tax, delivery fee, and a good tip, I paid $30. I don't know if they normally do delivery, it didn't seem like it, and I think  it was the owner who did the delivery, so on one hand I appreciate them making the effort, but on the other hand, maybe they shouldn't do delivery until they are ready.  I had to find my shoes and put on a coat over my pajamas to go outside to the street, and get the delivery from his car.  I probably wouldn't have cared if the food was really good. Unfortunately, the two main dishes were very cold.  One was actually refrigerator cold, which makes me wonder if they literally grabbed some left overs from out of the fridge.  I don't know how else it could have been that cold.  I am down for some home cooking Indian food, but dang.  I don't pay that much money for home cooking leftovers!  I still wouldn't have cared too much because I do have a microwave, if the food was good. Unfortunately, neither dish was anything like butter chicken, no trace of the delectable, savory curry that I LOVE.  And the dishes were extremely spicy.  So my guidelines of 1. I really love butter chicken, and want something similar, and 2. not too spicy, were not fulfilled.  Plus the free extras were just two pita pieces of bread, an odd assortment of veggies as if for a sandwich, and a tiny container of green sauce.  My boyfriend and I poked at the veggies for a few moments, in confusion, like ""what the heck is this for?"", it didn't stand alone, and it didn't seem to go with either the chicken in tomato or the chicken and rice dish. I think the owner knew he didn't provide his best foods, which is what I was expecting when I let him pick for me, because when I told him I'd leave a Yelp review, he hollered out the car that next time it would be better or something like that. I don't know if I am going to risk more money seeing if that is the case, though.  I was pretty disappointed with my midnight Indian food fix.  My boyfriend ate a little bit of the chicken and rice dish, but I could tell he was wondering what the heck I was thinking when I ordered from here.  He absolutely refused to even try the chicken in tomato sauce dish that had come super cold.  (When I say tomato sauce, I do NOT mean delectable creamy tomato curry sauce, just plain, jane tomato sauce.  Or stew.)  Maybe another late midnight evening I will give them another chance, but only if they have butter chicken on the menu. Reading some of the other reviews on here, I don't know if they offer everything on their menu all of the time, so they might need to be more clear on that concept... which isn't a bad concept if it is understood correctly!",0.998,0.759,0.172,0.07,0.6183126536999777

Granted, in Chicago, you can't get it that fresh, except for the bread, that is FRESH.  When you sit down to eat, they start making the dough to make the bread that they're about to serve you.  The naans are extraordinary, people in India would be jealous.  And when had with their chef's special frontier chicken, it is as if they simply took happiness and mixed it in with your food. The rest of the food can be hit or miss.  But this place is CHEAP; if you don't like something, just get another dish.  Don't expect much service, lest you have any shame for having the owner's small sons set your table for you when they're helping out at the place.  Very likely, you'll be grabbing your own plates and utensils and  setting your own table.  But after paying some ridiculously small amount of money for feasting like royalty, you'll find a warm, fuzzy feeling also deposited in your stomach.",0.9099,0.818,0.119,0.063,0.6009189640768589

I eat Indian and Pakistani food regularly, and I have no issues with bones.  But this was mostly bone. The owner seemed nice enough, and I hate to blast a place that so many people obviously have liked.  I just cannot fathom why.  I actually had to verify the picture matched the place I had just eaten at.

If you are looking for quite possibly the closest experience you can have in Chicago of getting cheap, delicious grub from a food stall in India, this is your place. That being said this definitely isn't for everyone. Flaming Wok 'n Grill is a no-frills joint. Don't expect to be getting your Chicken Tikka Masala in a nice tray with your naan and table cloths.

For one, naan is not the most commonly consumed flatbread in India and this is not the kind of fancy restaurant where you'd find it.

So, first thing you have to do once you reach home is to heat the food in a microwave, which is what they do at the restaurant when you order to eat. 2) Be sure you try the roti or chapathi.

They have their own unique taste to it. 4) *** Tip *** Have a glance at the food available and go for the ones that are still available.
