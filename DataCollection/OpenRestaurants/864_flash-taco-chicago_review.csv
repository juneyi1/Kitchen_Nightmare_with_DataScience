After having two other not so good experiences, simply due to speed of delivery I chose to order again.  My mistake!  As always, my order was wrong. I asked for pico on the side, it was slathered all over my taco.  I asked for a quesadilla, which came to me partially unwrapped laying in the bag.  My favorite was the elote. The corn was swimming in a pool of water from their obvious lack of straining of their canned produce and the mayo and butter that was to be on top was less than a teaspoon in total.  If want want basic, and to allow someone to choose what you get instead of how you requested it, this is the place for you!  Prior to this, the first order was just wrong. The second order was wrong, the fish tacos smelled like swamp water, and the quesadilla had a foreign object cooked into it. 3/3 Don't waste your money or appetite.",-0.9627,0.729,0.1,0.171,0.4658333333333333

Today was the fateful day. We stepped inside and no service person to be found until a few minutes later a lady pops out from the back. There was no sign indicating any instruction for ordering the $1 tacos, so we just chose the most basic ones on the menu thinking that it would be sufficient. My friend orders 2 and the total came out to be $6.. wait what? Oh you have to order 3 tacos for it to be $1 and the choices are beef or chicken, and it only comes with onions and cilantro. Luckily it worked out to where she wanted 2 and I wanted 1.. we did 2 beefs and 1 chicken. Nope, that doesn't work either, you have to get all of the same kind.  Are you serious? We got 3 beefs, two without onions. They were tiny baby sized tacos, with decent but mediocre taste. Also, all 3 tacos had onions! SMH. Not a fan and will never return.

If you're completely sober and recently turned away from Big Star down the street because the wait was too long, just keep walking to something else. I'll admit that my standards for tacos were set pretty high when I went. I had planned on eating at Big Star with my friends before catching a show at the Subterranean (right around down the street from Big Star and Flash Taco) but the wait was way too long. One of my friends mentioned Flash Taco and we decided to hit that place up.  I ordered a barbacoa taco and a chile relleno. Both tacos were small - the way I like my tacos - and wrapped up individually in your regular foil and bagged in a plain old brown bag. I thought nothing of the generic and unoriginal quality to the wrapping while I was opening it but in retrospect I should have realized everything would be generic and unoriginal. The barbacoa had none of the flavor (and color - it was so pale) that I expect from my meat. Heck, a little seasoning would have been nice. The chile relleno was equally disappointing. The cheese stuffed in the pepper tasted like nothing special and the chile felt soggy to me. Which makes no sense because if you properly fry your food, it shouldn't be soggy with grease or whatever. But it was soggy.  My friend ordered the veggie taco and was equally disappointed by hers. She asked for no queso or sour cream because she's vegan but they still put the cheese on it. It also was supposed to have grilled bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, lettuce and mushrooms topped with guacamole but all she got was a bunch of lettuce and onions in a soggy tortilla.  Needless to say, I will not be back. After eating that sorry meal, we ended up going somewhere else for more satisfying food because our taste buds were severely disappointed.",0.4315,0.843,0.084,0.073,0.4076049097101728

I think Flash Taco's two star overall review can be heavily attributed to some unfortunate momentum.  Flash, in my experiences, has largely been quite pleasing. To be fair, 4 of the 6 times I've been there I was a few beverages deep. And on each of those occasions, I found the tacos tremendous. If you're in Wicker Park at 2AM, I think you'll be satisfied with a barbacoa, al pastor, or adobada taco. If its 7PM, and you're sober, I can't as comfortably predict your experience. On my first sober trip, I thought the tacos were fantastic. I found the al pastor and barbacoa to be well flavored, and the cilantro and onions to be fresh. On my second sober trip, the meat was under seasoned and somewhat dry. It was not one or two star bland, but merely a mediocre taco. Never, in any of my six trips, have I experienced undercooked meats. Never, in any of my six trips, have I experienced unfortunate bowel behavior.  Maybe my friends and I have strong stomachs, or maybe the people at Flash have a soft spot for me, and decide they'll forgo the food poisoning this one time. On the other hand, maybe we've got a little bit of review bias going on. In the end, I think Flash delivers a decent taco.",0.7707,0.828,0.101,0.071,0.6081890331890333

As you can tell I usually don't write reviews unless I'm a frequent customer of the place, but this had to be written after my one and only time: don't eat here.  Yes, it could be 2AM and you're hungry and you're drunk as sh*t yelling and having fun with the guys or gals and this place has cheap food, but seriously don't eat here.  Unless you want what could be a brutal experience for your stomach.  As I sit here writing this review I wonder if I should visit the hospital if these symptoms keep persisting.  Seems like salmonella poisoning the more I research my symptoms. Anyway, I was visiting Chicago for a week and before my flight back today I needed to get something on the go.  Hadn't eaten anything since yesterday afternoon's bowl of arugula and blueberries from Trader Joe's.  I thought this place looked cool at night every time I got off the Blue Line so why not stop by.  Telltale sign I should have just went to Lil' Guys despite the monsoon pouring buckets outside: took the employee 5+ minutes to notice me standing, waiting to order.  No bueno. Got the Polish sausage with some water and headed upstairs to quickly eat before headed to O'Hare.  Picked up a carnitas taco too from Flash Taco.  Ate and went on my way. A couple hours later while waiting for my delayed flight I felt something was wrong.  Stomach arching and cramping, nausea, dizziness, headaches, sweating (in an air conditioned airport)m dehydration after 3 liters of water and couldn't even piss.  Can count the number of times I found myself rushing to the restroom for a watery numero dos with vomit experience.  Yeah, disgusting, but it had to be said so y'all know what you could likely experience eating from this place.  I'm fairly confident Underdog/Flash Taco is the culprit.  I literally saw the Polish dog, fries, and taco in the toilet.  Never got the same experience from Wrigley Chicago Dogs or the Fois Gras duck sausage, Malin Akerman, corn dog or duck fat fries from Hot Doug's. I'm pretty sure I saw tears from the toilets I visited.  I'm pretty sure I scared flyers in the other stalls. Don't even get me started on the flight.  Pretty sure the flight attendant was secretly pissed at me when my ordeal even happened before the flight took off and I missed to toilet.  She skipped giving drinks to me.  Now I feel like i owe American Airlines another ticket purchase. Never in my travel experiences to third world countries or local eating experiences at what could look like the most sketch places to eat have I gone through an ordeal like this.  Throughout the flight I was planning what to write and research the place and read up on any health inspections.  Oh boy they got a lot of fails and passes after corrections made: webapps.cityofchicago.or... This place should get a black hole rating.  Don't eat here.  You're better off starving and waiting for Toast Two or Stan's Donuts to open in the morning.  I better just stick to Mexican restaurants in California...",0.8916,0.79,0.117,0.093,0.5119047619047619

2014-04-08,2.0,"Flash Taco is a late night place, keep that in mind. This place is many things, great is not one of them. They have daily specials, specifically 3 tacos for $3 (steak, chicken or ground beef - with onions and cilantro) on Monday and Tuesday. These specials expire at midnight and the next day's special does not begin until the next day, after they've closed. They told me once when I disputed not being able to get the special after midnight (I was working second shift, not drunk) they told there is fine print and that you have to read it. Well, I did just that and there's no fine print...so they are false advertising and not being penalized for it. The food itself is ""ok."" Though I've tried other things,  I typically get tacos. I've had probably every taco on their menu, the al pastor being the best. The menu says it's served on some special dish with a pineapple wedge- bullshit, I've ordered them at least forty times and never had that. They also don't include lime. The worst part though is they give you half the meat you'd expect on all their tacos and still charge over $2 per taco. How tacos are greater than $2 each is beyond me... With how often I go (it's cheaper and less hipster than Big Star) I am treated fair by the staff. In reality, they treat customers like crap. Granted, they don't attract the best crowd but they are usually rude and make no effort to appear ""thankful"" for your business. That's a major turnoff for me but most of the people who go are assholes anyways so it's understandable they're not so excited to service that population.

2012-06-20,1.0,"I came here with some friends around midnight on Monday night, and  I was very hungry because I hadn't eaten anything since lunch. Totally sober and just wanting something fast and cheap, I settled on this place. I ordered 2 steak tacos and a side of refried beans. They tried to give me just the tacos without the side of beans that I paid for. The girl I ordered from was the same one who put everything in the bag, and since I was only one of 3 people in the place, I highly doubt she got the orders mixed up. So I tell her to give me my beans and she does.  When I'm at the blue line station waiting on the train, I discover that they gave me the wrong tacos. Instead of the steak tacos w/ tomato, onions, and cilantro, they gave ground beef with potato and carrots. WTF? I was too tired and hungry to walk back to Flash Taco and make them correct my order, so I just ate the damn things. They were okay, a bit dry, but they would have been better if they hadn't tasted like bitter disappointment with a dash of seething rage. The beans w/ muenster cheese were too damn good for me to hate them though, so that's something. And I know what I'm talking about because I eat beans every other day.  One star for the awesome beans!  Overall, don't go here. I get the sense that what you order doesn't actually matter, they will just give you whatever the hell they want. That's not okay. I believe that if you pay for something then that's what you should be getting. I didn't get the tacos that I paid for, and I almost didn't get the beans either.

2012-06-17,5.0,"I AM A TACO SLUT! I will admit that I slept with a taco from Flash Taco one night... yes I was drunk... I had been drinking tequila down the street at the Flatiron... and a couple of other places... but the truth is... I slept with a taco. Flash Taco is just the thing to lay down in your belly after a night of ravenous tequila consumption in Wicker Park. The place practically calls to you as you walk by. Sometimes there's a dude dressed up like a hotdog out in front of it... which seems weird for a taco joint but I think there's a hotdog place in the basement or something like that. I forget what I always get there because I only go there after a night on the town if you know what I mean... and really I never intended... ever to sleep with a freakin' taco but it happened and I can accept that. It's not like the taco and I got freaky or anything like that... I don't even remember how it happened to be honest. I can't believe I slept with a taco. If you're going to sleep with a taco though sleeping with a taco from Flash Taco is probably a good choice. That other taco shack down the street... the one with the 'star' kinda pisses me off... the tacos there are pretty good but they got this sign that says '20 taco limit.' Not that I've ever wanted to eat twenty tacos... or sleep with them... but I just don't like the idea of anyone telling me how many tacos I can have. It seems downright unamerican and I just wont eat at a taco shack that has the nerve to tell me I can only eat twenty tacos if I feel like having more... although I suppose I could just order nineteen tacos and then stand in line again... but who wants to stand in line twice. Although I've met some kinda cute drunk chicks in line there I gotta say. Which brings me back to Flash Taco and the only taco I've ever slept with. There's always cute drunk chicks at Flash Taco too... shit... everyone there at night is drunk. They're open really late. One time I ate tacos there and then I was surprised to see the sun come up. I once did a calculation based on the hours listed on my receipt and figured out that in any given week there are only thirty five hours or so where you can't get yourself a Flash Taco. Even though I get incredibly handsome, irresistibly humorous and as strong as a kilt wearing Scotsman that singlehandedly carries big logs on their shoulder in some kind of competition I'm always seeing on tv when I do drink tequila... I don't use taco joints for dating. I go there for the tacos. But watching drunk chicks annihilate tacos and burritos does add to the overall ambiance of any taco place it's the tacos themselves that matter in the end. I think it was Alex's fault that I ended up sleeping with the taco anyway. He was from Russia and we were talking there one night... I told him about how I rode the Transiberian Express across all of Russia in college and we ended up talking so much that I didn't eat my second taco... which was one of their Asade Adobada tacos... they're not too juicy but they're really good... it was wrapped in foil so when it was time to leave I just put it in my pants pocket figuring I'd eat it later or something. I'm not a psychic or anything and I really didn't see that in my future that night I'd be sleeping in my clothes. Usually I sleep butt naked but after a night of great tequila sometimes I guess I forget to take my clothes off. I woke up and something just smelled so freakin' deliciously good. It smelled like I'd slept next to Felicia the hot little waitress at the Mexican restaurant I call my 'office'... after she pulled a double shift... the one who looks all cute and vulnerable in those 'peasant' shirts they wear as they bring me basket after basket of freshly fried tortilla chips with salsa that I had to personally insult the manliness of the chef in order to get it him to make it hot enough. I've kinda got this thing for peasant blouses you know? Actually I told Felicia that I'd like to speak to whoever made the salsa and when he came out I said... 'you have insulted my maniliness... I asked for 'extra spicy' salsa... and you give me this... do you think I am a man who cannot handle the caliente... is this some sort of an insult?' That next batch was some hot shit I'll tell you. Jose watched me eat it so closely I thought maybe he'd poisoned me and just wanted to watch me die. Sweat formed on the top of my head... which you could see really well because I don't have any hair there and that heat penetrated to every part of my body and I told him 'eso es una mierda puto bueno!'... which means 'I think I'm gonna need another tecate undele amigo!' We're tight now though me and Jose. Now that we see eye to eye on what 'spicy salsa' really should be. I digress... You should really try the Asado Adobada tacos there. Just try not to sleep with them.",0.9926,0.838,0.103,0.059,0.5382090336134455

Other night was out with some friends in Wicker Park and of course, at way early in the morning, Flash Taco is conveniently open. My friends and I stand in line for about 10 minutes until we get to the front. I ask for a Tinga Quesadilla (Chicken Breast marinated with Chipotle sauce and sauteed onions + black bean spread)...sounds pretty good right? -- Nope. Didn't have it. So I go for the meat and cheese.  After waiting for another 5+ so minutes in the wee hours, I get a quesadilla is what it is.. chunks of meat. And cheese. The meat was slightly flavored but nothing too special. I think the only thing that made it good was the cheese...and let's be honest here, anything with cheese will be good.  So that being said, don't come here for anything special.  Another thing to add-  when we were in line, someone mentioned the meat not being really cooked...is that what they do in the early morning with the intoxicated customers?? Maybe something to consider before stepping foot...  ""P.S."" my stomach didn't feel good the next day. ( :/ )  My suggestion is...go across the street to Big Star! mentioned in Chicago magazine.

When I became an adult, I no longer used childish ways."" 1 Corinthians 13:11 Or not.  Because I just can't quit the childish pursuit of going to Flash Taco! See, when I first moved to Chicago at the tender age of 24, I had friends who lived nearby and after late night bacchanalian debauchery, we used to stumble here for veggie burritos (at least something we did was healthy).  And in our imbibed state, they tasted great.  Or at least absorbed some of the alcohol. In the intervening years, I learned there was more to Mexican food than burritos and as my awareness grew, so did Flash's menu.  And yet, every time they added a new item, every time I tried it, the thing was just as crappy as everything that came before it.  Chile Rellenos.  Burnt and oily.  Huevos Rancheros.  Health hazardly undercooked.  One dollar (or so) veggie tamales?  The tamale guy would blush in embarrassment that these are called the same thing as his wares.  They fall apart if you look at them wrong.   Still, glutton for punishment, recently I tried their latest newness, the Veggie Huaraches.  I'm still not sure what these were supposed to be but what they consisted of were glumps of salsa, some sort of greens, and what passes for cheese here on top of underdone flatbread.  And, one thing didn't change.  I got sick the next day! So why would anyone eat here over the age of 25?  Because sometimes the wallet does not grow with the wisdom of years.  And they have a dollar menu.  And it's vegetarian friendly.  And it's off the blue line.  And sometimes I'm still drunk in Wicker Park at 4:00 a.m. and it seems like a good idea.  And it's how I keep up on the newest dance music on their loudly pulsating (seriously, you can almost see the volume) big screens.  Or, however I feel like justifying it.

The fact of the matter was that I needed to eat, especially if I was going to drink anything so I headed down the street from Johalla Projects Art Gallery before things kicked off.  So let me explain how tortillas work. The site around in a stack. Which means that the edges are exposed to air longer than the rest of the tortilla. Very simply...your tortillas have been sitting around uncovered for TOO LONG when the edge of the tortilla becomes rock hard! The tacos were bland to begin with. I ordered beef tacos with cilantro and onion, add sour cream. They were crammed full of ingredients but over all there was no flavor so you end up relishing the sourcream more than anything.  Disappointing. As my friend noted this food is not for sober taste buds. I did like the horchata though.  Lastly, I didn't appreciate  the staff either. I ask if I could use the bathroom. They pointed to the door. The door was locked and the large gap below the door indicated there was no light on inside. So I asked if there was a key and got the ""no se"", ""no key"".

Perhaps when one makes a chicken burrito, it would help if they remove all the bones and/or cartilage prior to placing the meat in the burrito. On a couple of occasions, it was so bad, I couldn't even finish my burrito. (Yes my mouth has been slapped with a good chunk of chicken bone more than once at this place.) I also believe a good chicken burrito is made with ""identifiable"" white chicken meat. Unfortunately, that is not the case with the regular chicken burrito here. The meat is mostly dark. And I'm not really sure what part of the chicken... wait, come to think of it, is it even chicken? There is some hope though. Flash Taco has recently added what they call the ""Chicken Supremo"" burrito. This thing is tolerable and yes the meat is even identifiable; nothing but pure white heavenly breast.

If you are a tourist standing at the corner of North and Damen right now, in daylight, and you noticed this fun taco place with the lightning bolt sign, and you're checking the reviews on Yelp on your little Blackberry or iPhone or whatever gadget you have, please run away. Find a doorway down the street, huddle in it, and search Yelp Chicago for a decently rated Mexican place in the vicinity. This is where you go when the choices are an ill-advised amorous romp with a stranger or bad Mexican food with too much cheese, and you're hungry or leaning toward celibacy. Oh, sometimes it's actually too much meat, depending on what you order. I spent Valentine's night/Sunday morning with a chorizo quesidilla and it was like a meat explosion -- not a good meat explosion, either. Yes, this is my life. Oh, and guess what? If you enter this place between 2 and 4 a.m., you will most likely wait in a terribly long line while listening to a bad mix of techno and ballads (I think it's mostly in Spanish but I'm never sober, so who knows).

I remember getting in to our apartment, sitting down and enjoying the nachos.  Truth be told, they tasted delicious and hit the spot.  Shortly thereafter I went to bed.  The next morning I awoke to see my roommates playing Mario Kart.  I joined them for a minute before feeling queasy.  I won't go too far in to detail, but let's just say that Flash Taco's nachos don't taste so swell the next morning. Finally, after two days of laying in bed, withering in pain from food poisoning, I came to the conclusion that I will never eat Flash Taco again and that my new goal in life would be to protect as many people as I could from eating such rubbish.

I'm totally in love with the super el cheapo mini corn quesidillas. A couple of those will set me back to rights when I'm starving and just need to get home to get some real food. Also, horchata is always good.  After I did my first bike race last month, I swung by here on my way home after the after-party and had the veggie nachos and they were seriously EPIC.

And I ended up here on default at 1:30 on a Tuesday night (bars close at 2, this is important). When we arrived, it was us and a couple of the people in the place, we ordered, and ate.

I was the only girl in the place, and the place was filled with a bunch of yelling guys. 75% were watching, a couple were trying to break it up, and a couple more were throwing in. My companion and I were trying to figure how the hell we were gonna get out before the cops showed up and without getting caught up in the melee.  To make a long story somewhat shorter, it ended up with the hipster winning (and throwing rock hands before he took off, hilariously enough), the floor covered in blood, the jock getting his face totally bashed in, the counter guys looking like ""oh god not again"", and my companion and I getting out of there about 30 seconds before 4 cop cars showed up.

As we walked away that night (morning??), I glanced back at the joint to make note of the name so that I'd never make the mistake of going there again and in my drunken haze I misread the sign and yelled out ""OH MY GOD, we just ate at a place called FLESH TACO!""  Well folks, that might as well be the name... that's how gross it is.",0.3792,0.803,0.113,0.085,0.6475000000000001

However, there are plenty of other Mexican joints that are actually tasty and that are just as cheap to get some quick grub at.

The seating is pretty much non-existent and what is there is highly uncomfortable. Avoid this place like the plague late-night on weekends as well, as it is always jammed-packed full of drunk and sloppy hipsters, yups and bangers... makes for a dangerous mix usually.

2006-10-27,1.0,"One of my worse food experience ever. I tried to get delivery from them. Being all smart and wired, I figured I would try their on-line order website and get the first time order discount. Well, that didn't work out, the coupon code given didn't work. I ended up calling and they wouldn't honor the coupon or really care that their stuff was broken. We still ordered. The food came in about 30 minutes (fairly standard except they really aren't that far from me). The taco salad was bland and uninspired. The chicken inside contained some cartilage; not the most appetizing.  And the salad itself wasn't really fresh. The Quesadillas were soggy and tasteless. I'm not going to mention the Nachos at all. My wife had a burrito dinner which she claims was just OK. At least it was dirt cheap. To top it all, both my wife and I were sick to our stomach the next morning. I've never eaten inside the place so I can't say if they have any atmosphere. However, I can say that I will never eat anything out of their kitchen ever again.  Avoid at all costs.

It will definately fill you up. Try one of their massive burritos, or a few of their steak tacos. Those are also really good.
