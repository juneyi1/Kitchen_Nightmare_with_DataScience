2017-08-30,4.0,"I've visited Southport Grocery & Cafe numerous times over the past few years.  It's one place that I only go to early in the morning because otherwise, it's too busy and the wait can be long..however, if you have time and are willing to wait, definitely check it out! Southport Grocery & Cafe is just what the name implies - there's a small 'grocery' area where you can buy some packaged goods and also bakery items (and coffee).  There are some unique items here, but where some of the items (various hot sauces) could only be found in a few spots a few years ago, now some are widely sold. The outdoor area in the summer is popular, and that's where I sat during only one of my visits (inside is great, too).   Service is friendly, and while the menu states that everything is made to order, we didn't have to wait long for our meals.  The portion sizes aren't huge, but decent enough, and you can get smaller portions of some of the sweet entrees.  The side of pork sausage was wonderful - I do highly recommend that.  I also had french toast on my recent visit - which was not too sweet, but nicely cooked and with a refreshing citrus flavor on the topping.   Coffee is tasty, but strong.  They are very attentive to ensure you get enough coffee also, so don't worry about your cup running empty. Price-wise, considering there aren't really any side offerings to some of the breakfast entrees, it's a bit pricey...I think for 2 of us we somehow spent $50 on breakfast with no breakfast cocktails (I did buy a savory pastry on the way out, but I don't think that's what tipped the scale). So, all in all, good, but a bit pricey for breakfast, but the menu is fresh and high quality ingredients abound.",0.9944,0.817,0.161,0.022,0.5697619047619048

Can't say enough good things about this. May be a little too fancy for my taste but you have to try it. So good. Then split a cupcake pancake (I'm a sucker for anything covered in whipped cream and syrup, but definitely very sweet).  Also split the chorizo and eggs. Kind of a strange twist on chilaquiles, was more like breakfast nachos that were kind of hard to eat. Delicious, but a lot of crunch. Definitely worth a stop, maybe not as an attempted boozy brunch though",0.4094,0.693,0.149,0.158,0.6112698412698412

The place was out of shareable bread, which was odd, as it is probably the easiest thing to make. Therefore, we settled on the grilled coffee cake as a starter. Unfortunately, the coffee cake did not come to the table for 45 minutes. The other food items probably took another 20 minutes after that. The cake itself was pretty good, the rest of the meal was not much to rave about. I ordered the cuban with a side salad. The bread on the cuban was pretty dry to the point of hurting my gums.

2016-11-20,3.0,"This place is perfectly located if you're trying to grab brunch before a Cubs game and is perfectly located in a cute area with shops, restaurants, and fun stuff to do.  When we got there around 11, the wait was 45-60 minutes, and ended up being right around 50. While the cafe and patio are cute, it's definitely packed once you get inside and a bit of a tight squeeze.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs, and honestly, I was less than impressed. It wasn't super flavorful. There was nothing specific about it, it just overall was kinda lacking for me. However, my friends and I also split the bread pudding pancakes and they were AMAZINGGG!!!!! THE BEST PANCAKES IVE HAD IN MY LIFE!!!! God they were so rich and sweet, so avoid them if you don't have a sweet tooth, but they were seriously to die for. But they are rich, and if you have a sensitive stomach like me, don't say I didn't warn you....... I also tried a bite of my friend's chicken and grits, and that seemed pretty good. I would probably order that if I went back.  Our service was ok. Like I mentioned, they were definitely busy, but it took a while for our waiter to come and even take our drink order, waters got low, little things like that. He was nice and polite and apologized when he did finally make it to our table thought.  I live in Wicker Park and probably wouldn't hike all the way back up to go here again.

2016-10-31,1.0,"What a frustrating brunch experience with friends from out of town here to enjoy the Cubs World Series weekend. To start, we were seated outside with no wait because of the chilly Sunday morning temperatures. We immediately ordered drinks ($10 each) and ordered our food a few minutes later. The time was 9:50am. One of my friends tried to add an egg to his Cuban sandwich, but was told they weren't allowed to add things to an order. He instead got a side of eggs and added them to his sandwich after the order arrived. After 10 minutes, our server came back and apologized and said they were out of kettle chips. My friend again asked if he could just have the eggs as his side and was told no. About 10 minutes later, a different server came to our table and said they were out of pimento cheese, so a different friend picked another cheese for her dish. Yet once more, 10 minutes later, the server came out again and said they were out of biscuits for the brisket and gravy dish and a side for two other dishes. We were given the option to wait 20 minutes for the biscuits or to substitute an English muffin, even though we were previously told there were no substitutions allowed. 2 people switched to an English muffin, which came out 15 minutes cold and uncooked. After over an hour, our food finally arrived, with over cooked biscuits, which were extra crispy. We were told we were given 15% off of our bill for this lackluster pricey brunch, but when the bill was paid, there was no 15% off, so we had to redo the transaction. I won't be returning here any time soon. There are several other high caliber brunch spots on Southport and this one has consistently fell short of my expectations. For a better experience and better food, check out Crosby's, Tucco and Blondie, and Corridor a little further south on Southport.",0.9382,0.892,0.073,0.034,0.3571264367816092
2016-10-29,3.0,"I'm on the fence with this one. Let me start by saying the cupcake pancakes are to die for! Well, my first one was...we ordered a variety of things to get the full experience. We ordered cupcake pancakes, bread pudding pancakes, grown-up pop-tart, biscuit & jam, chicken and grits and a gluten free vanilla cupcake. The bread pudding pancakes are definitely ""gooey"". In my opinion there's a difference between gooey and raw, but hey, what do I know. I sent those back and got another order of cupcake pancakes. This order came out just as raw as the bread pudding pancakes. However, because the first order was so good, I know they are capable. Maybe they're not consistent and that's the problem. My husband enjoyed the pop-tart. It was okay. The preserves used for the filling was good. The biscuit was super dry. The cheese grits were good, but the chicken was dry and lacked flavor. The cupcake was very disappointing. Although the icing was some of the best I've ever tried, the actual cake was very dry and didn't taste like anything. Our waitress that started off serving us only returned once after our food arrive. Another waitress grab our food because it was just sitting there waiting to be picked up. The seating is very intimate. You will hear everything the table next to you is saying. It's a plus that they make a lot of the food items in house and you can purchase many of the products.

2016-10-22,1.0,"I'm honestly shocked that I'm writing this review right now. I live in the area and have had brunch/lunch at this cafe several times, and the amazing food had always been well worth the sometimes long wait, but today was a complete turn around. My aunt was visiting from out of town and was quite peckish after driving several hours and missing breakfast. I suggested we walk around the corner to Southport grocery and cafe, because the brunch Rush was sure to have died down. Everything started out fine. We sat out outside and proceeded to place our orders. We had several things, coffee cake, a sandwich, soup, coffee, tea, and the cheese box. This is where things turned for the worse. I have seen my friends order the cheese box before and always wanted to order it. ( this was with me also understanding that it was not a traditional cheese board, and that the cheese came whole, and you had to slice it yourself ) when our food finally arrived ( which took quite a while, and never together, but wasn't unusual for this popular spot ) the server forgot to leave a knife for me to slice my cheese with, so after asking for one, he proceeded to come back and inform me that customers weren't aloud anything sharp or serrated, and only butter knives. I was confused. How was I supposed to slice my cheese? ( hard cheese at that) Was I supposed to just bite a chunk out of it? He then said that the manager did say we could use scissors. And then proceeded to sit a pair of dirty, partially rusted craft scissors on out table and walk away. As if that was a perfectly ok and appropriate thing to do. My aunt laughed. She thought he was joking. I had to get up and go back in and ask if he was serious. He just shrugged his shoulders. I handed him back the rusty dirty scissors ( that he had left on our table, next to our food) and let him know I was sending the cheese box back. No manager ever approached is to apologize, and my aunt was so taken aback, that she felt uneasy finishing her food. Worse experience ever. And this biggest downfall is that i really enjoyed this cafe and went a lot with friends, and now won't be able to recommend going there to anyone. :(",0.8212,0.792,0.112,0.095,0.47016250944822374

2016-08-24,4.0,"We had to stop here after hearing all the hype.  And the verdict: DELICIOUS.  There isn't a lot of seating indoors or outdoors, so if you can go on a weekday, I would highly suggest it! Service was simple; water is on the table, so you only order and receive your food from your waitress, and that's it. No fancy extras.  I ordered the savory hand pie, which was good, but not great. There was a lot of dough, and everything was separated on the inside- egg on top, spinach and mushrooms on bottom. The flavors were actually tasty, and having it warmed up was a great choice, but it was missing a holistic feeling. I also ordered the cupcake pancake which was the  bomb.com ! I'm glad I went solo, because it's obviously very sweet; but man, was it something that I have only imagined in my wildest dreams so far. Ooey, gooey on the inside, and topped with vanilla frosting. To die for!  My friend ordered the chorizo and eggs and thought it was superb; best she's had in the city! The iced tea, however, was terrible and tasted like Chapstick. We certainly didn't utilize the bottomless feature as we could barely finish 1/4 of the glass between the two of us.  We took a red velvet cupcake with goat cheese frosting to go. Such an amazing combo of flavors, with just the right amount of frosting that it almost made you miss the fact that the cake was a tad dry. Not to the point of being off-putting; I would just expect a moister cake.  Overall, some misses, but they certainly didn't take away from the hits. I would definitely dine again and just try something different... But I'll keep getting the solo cupcake pancake forever. :)",0.9894,0.734,0.185,0.081,0.6093349753694581

2016-05-14,3.0,"Today was my first time at Southport Grocery and I'll say right off the bat that the food was very good. I had a chicken salad platter that was fresh and tasty; served with a nice heap of mixed greens and a wonderful house made roll. My friend went for breakfast, ordering the bread pudding pancakes- which I tried and loved. So why only 3 stars? Well, two reasons: First, my friend asked for syrup for her pancakes (they come with a tiny bit of créme anglaise on the side) and the server told her they charge $1.50 for syrup since it's real maple syrup. This, in my opinion, is ridiculous. If you're a halfway decent restaurant you should serve nothing less than real maple syrup and you most certainly should never charge extra for it. Charging for syrup with pancakes is like charging for bread in an Italian restaurant or for tortilla chips in a Mexican restaurant in my opinion. Then, when the syrup was brought to the table, it was in one of those small paper ketchup containers that you get at a hotdog joint. Seriously...it was barely enough for one pancake and definitely not a $1.50 worth. Besides, for me it's not at all about the money. I'm willing to pay good money for good food. And they have very good food here. So why spoil the experience by milking customers for something as silly as syrup? If you are a business owner and don't get this then you miss the point. Also, while I really enjoyed the food, the service was another story. My friend and I showed up at 3:15pm; the place closes at 4pm. The first words spoken to us as we were being brought to our table was that the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. Then our server came and the first thing he told us was the same thing. We immediately felt put off and rushed so we both ordered things that required little effort from the kitchen. The restaurant had a few other tables seated and still eating when the lights were literally turned off then back on (as if to say ""Wrap it up."") and the servers started emptying the trash cans and carrying the trash out through the place as we ate. This is a terrible practice. I totally understand that servers work long hard hours. But when you say your place is open until 4pm and someone shows up a full 45 mins before closing then you need to treat them like the very first customers of the day. That's just good business practice. Anyway, I'm willing to go back to Southport Grocery for the great food, but I'll make sure to go early so I can get served without the ""get out"" attitude.",0.9814,0.884,0.095,0.021,0.5100518925518925

2014-09-28,1.0,"Tried to get a table at this place last week. We decided to go back to this place, having had a good experience there the first time we went. You'd figure if there were about 5 tables open on a Sunday morning the wait shouldn't be long, if any, for two people. We checked in with the hostess and she informed us that it would be 1:15-1:30 minutes for a table. I left it up to my girlfriend to decide if she wanted to wait. She said no. We kindly told the hostess thanks, but we could not wait that long.  It was the next thing that the hostess said to us that was upsetting. She looked at us, seemed to roll her eyes at us, and said ""Good luck"". It was said in such a condescending tone that it still makes my girlfriend mad one week later. Like we couldn't find anyplace else to go to. We ended up at Crosby's Kitchen just down the street. Got seated right away. And our breakfast was served to us in under 15 minutes. So I guess luck was on our side. We go out to eat at least twice a week, usually going to places with good food and friendly service. If this is the way the first person that we meet when we walk through the door greets us, it will be a long time before we would consider going back.",0.9478,0.853,0.107,0.039,0.36699735449735454

A big carafe of coffee was refilled the moment it was emptied.  The food was delicious. Among our table, we had the bruschetta (which was more like a scramble, and though it wasn't quite what I had expected it was still quite good), the breakfast sandwich, the brisket and eggs, and the chorizo and eggs. Everyone totally loved what they had. I think the hit was the breakfast sandwich: the ginger sage sausage is just absolutely over the top. So good, so good.  Since this was our last stop before getting ready to go to the airport, we also picked up some of the gourmet packaged goodies for our trip.

2014-08-21,2.0,"I reviewed this place just over a year ago, and now I am updating my review.  Sadly, this place has gone downhill in terms of the service.  The food is incredible, and I could happily eat anything off their menu and love it!  Unfortunately, the last 2 times I have been there, the service has been horrible.  My work schedule has changed, so the last 2 times I went was around 8am during the week--which is a pretty slow time for Southport Grocery.  Despite there being 4 girls staffed at the front of the restaurant, no one acknowledged me for a good 5 minutes as I stood by the front in front of their sign ""please wait to be seated"".  Finally a girl said ""you can seat yourself anywhere!""  Once I sat down, it took another 8 minutes for someone to come take my order.  The service was slow, I never got a refill on my coffee, and I ended up getting up to get my own to-go box.  This wouldn't have been so annoying if there hadn't just been 4 servers poking around doing nothing.  The most recent time I went there was this morning--hoping that the experience I just wrote about was just a fluke.  Sadly, this time was even worse.  There were two tables eating and no one else in the restaurant.  No one acknowledged me at the front for a few minutes before telling me to sit myself.  Then I sat at a table and waited--no greeting, no menu, no water, nothing....for about 5 minutes while the girls poked at the shelves and rearranged product.  I actually got up and left.  I went straight to Orange in Roscoe Village where I walked in and was happily greeted, seated, and served immediately.  MUCH BETTER. I used to be a server for about 10 years, so I'm a reasonable person....it takes a lot for me to entirely give up on a restaurant because I know there are good days and bad days and short-staffed days.  At this point though...I've made up my mind about Southport Grocery--it seems the bad days are here to stay for them, and I'll be taking my business elsewhere.  There are too many other places with just as good of food AND good service to match!",0.6723,0.809,0.1,0.091,0.5973015873015874

I got the Bruschetta, and the only reason this review isn't 4/5 stars is because the Bruschetta was TOTALLY NOT what I was expecting.  It was a mess of soggy crostini, watery tomato discharge and a heaping helping of sausage and eggs.  it tasted ok, but was not what I was expecting nor was it all that appetizing looking. i was expecting crispy crostini, delicately placed eggs/sausage with the meaty parts of the tomato, like you would see on traditionally bruschetta.  but alas, it was a watery grave of food.

2014-06-10,1.0,"I want to preface this review noting that this is one of my favorite brunch spots and overall I love their food and their small-town modern ambience. A couple weeks ago, my boyfriend and I headed here for a late brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  This is one of our favorite weekend activities and we were especially pumped since we were going to one of our favorite places.  Southport cafe closes at 4pm, which we've been made previously aware means the kitchen closes strictly at 4pm with no wiggle room whatsoever.  With this in mind, we still ventured over close to that time, knowing that we knew what we wanted to order and that we have had great experiences there. When we walked in, the hostess seemed visibly uncomfortable that we had walked in and informed us that the kitchen was closing in a few minutes.  We've been there quite a few times so we told her we would be ready to order by the time the kitchen was closing.  Flustered, she looked around and found a waiter and begged him to take our order.  Unfortunately, it was our least favorite waiter here.  Even when we have come in earlier, he still always makes us feel rushed and unappreciated.  Without any kind of greeting, he said ""You have 2 minutes to order.""  I replied that was fine, we just needed exactly a minute to decide.  With a huff, he left and returned in a minute.  We ordered a ham and cheese omelet, a grown-up pop tart (which we have had before), and the sweet and savory french toast.   My boyfriend was not a fan of the drink he ordered.  He decided to try something new and did not have a chance to read through the description fully because of the haste of our waiter.  I asked our server if we would be able to get more drinks even though the kitchen was closed.  He said yes through gritted teeth, appearing visibly to not want to serve us anything more.  Not once did our server or anyone else check on us.  It turned out that my omelet was missing the mushroom that it had listed in the description and had hardly any swiss cheese in it, making it very plain.  I tried it with the hot sauce that we were given, but the one our server had left us was horrible with it.  We had seen other hot sauces on other peoples' tables but they weren't available to us.  The pop-tart had hardly any powdered sugar on it, which definitely adds to the earthy flavor of the preserves.  My boyfriend needed more syrup for his french toast, which was dry without it.  All of these concerns could have been easily remedied with just one person stopping by, or even walking by our table.  Also, it is clear that the kitchen staff rushed in preparing our meal, even though it was ordered before their deadline. When we were finished, it took us 10 minutes of waiting to get a box.  We paid our bill and exited, discouraged and unsatisfied.  The complete opposite of what a pleasant relaxing brunch should be. Overall, we left feeling unappreciated (especially given the amount that we dropped on the bill) and disappointed in our experience.  Even when customers come in at a later time, if you are open you should expect to serve anyone who comes in the door with the courtesy and decency that you would at any time.  Unfortunately, because of this experience, it will probably be a while until we return.",0.7545,0.866,0.075,0.059,0.50822317563389

2014-03-03,4.0,"OK, as I'm sure everyone who's ever been to brunch knows: you will have to wait for a table. For a very long time. No surprises there. When we went here on a Sunday (I know, ROOKIE MISTAKE) they told us the wait would be an hour and 15 minutes, which was difficult to deal with for my ravenously hungry boyfriend who had been dragged all the way down to southport avenue on a brutally cold morning. And with nothing much around to explore within a walkable distance (by 'walkable' I mean 'without getting frostbite in this winter that just does not seem to end') we started to doubt whether it was worth it.  It was. That was a long introduction to stress the fact that, no matter what, brunch at this place is worth it. We had a spinach omelette with artichoke puree, the sweet and savoury french toast, the bread pudding pancakes and a scrambled eggs and chorizo dish. All the food was top notch; the spinach omelet tasted really fresh and the artichoke puree is an original addition to this brunch staple. My boyfriend wasn't crazy about the scrambled eggs because of the copious amounts of cilantro sprinkled on top, but I actually quite liked the mexican-like flavors. The french toast was insanely good, perfect for satisfying that typical brunch craving for savoury and sweet, and it comes with this cranberry-maple syrup-mustard dressing that pairs well with the ham and swiss. The pancakes were really something else: because of the type of batter they use, they're really soft and almost fudgy. Also, coffee: great. So. The reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is the service. They're nice and attentive, but on the day we went, there was no hostess, resulting in lots of people standing around looking confused because it was unclear who was taking names down for tables, or where we should queue up. We may have caught them on a bad day, but everything just seemed a bit disorganized. It's a minor inconvenience, but hunger makes me impatient. On the plus side though, they use noshlist, so you can track your place on the wait list.  Will probably try to come back on a weekday and take my sweet time at this place.

2014-03-02,1.0,"This review is not based on the food (which is fantastic) it's based on the customer service which sadly today, our experience was extremely sub par. We waited over an hour for a table for 5 people. Not the issue. What is an issue, however, is that this place constantly tries to seat 5 people at a table that already feels tight with four. Or they will turn a 2-top sideways and try to sit 3 ppl there. Today I explained to the host that we have a woman pregnant with triplets in our party and his response was ""this is all we have. We do this all the time.""  Not even a ""ok would you be willing to wait longer so we can ensure your party is comfortable and enjoys their experience.""  He was rude, not accommodating and as the first person your patrons see and speak to when they come in, an EXTREMELY poor representation of good service. I have lived in this neighborhood for 8 years and sadly I will put this place last on my list for places to brunch in the neighborhood.

While the food was delicious, I don't think the overall experience (essentially, you're sitting in a grocery store) is worth more than a 30-minute wait.  Among our group, we ordered: Grilled coffee cake, brisket & gravy, stuffed french toast (cheese + apples = amazing), the bread pudding pancakes and hash with brisket. I can say with confidence that SG's strong point is the baked goods- the french toast and coffee cake were delicious and had the right balance of sweet, spicy and savory.  The hash and brisket and gravy, on the other hand, were sort of bland and almost room temperature when they arrived. The eggs, ordered over-medium, were undercooked. Since there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant, I guess this is due to server's speed or poor timing in the kitchen. Beyond taking our orders and checking on us once or twice, our server was not really around.

We ordered coffee and juice.  The drinks also took a bit to arrive.  We decided what we wanted to eat rather quickly and then waited for a while again before our order was taken.  The two tables next to us, who actually sat after us, had their order in before us.  A little bit of an irritation - especially when you're on a time constraint. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my bf had the hash.  He wasn't really excited about his at all.  He said it was OK. On the other hand, the chorizo and eggs were fantastic.  My one complaint is that the tortilla chips were underneith all the salsa and they got soggy very quickly.

Recently, I had the bourbon bacon Hot Chocolate. Holy funky all that is awesome! At one point I took the entire marshmallow that was covered in candied bacon pieces and put the whole thing in my mouth....yeah....and I'd do it again! My friends and I always split the sweet and savory french toast as an appetizer. I don't even really like french toast but I like this kind!!! Great place to get little locally made jams, chocolates, teas etc.  A few tips:  1. Don't come at peak brunch time or be prepared to wait, where as I'm not the only one who loves this place and there is minimum seating.  2. There is only one table that seats 6 so don't come with more than 3 other people...Max.  3. They have a menu for little tykes so you can bring your kids,  but the atmosphere is kinda upscale/grown up and by that I mean no one wants to hear your screaming kids especially if all they eat is cheerios or chicken nuggets with ketchup.....just saying. 4.

I have a huge sweet tooth (maple syrup with a side of french toast please!), am a cheesehead (grew up in Wisconsin and believe a dish is not complete without extra cheese), and love the zing of a little tang (no, not the kids breakfast beverage, I'm talking about any vinegar-based condiment). Voila, the sweet & savory french toast is the perfect combination -- thick french toast slices, ooey gooey swiss cheese, and maple-mustard dipping sauce. Pure heaven. The portions are extremely generous, but, no fear, you will devour every last piece.  There's always a wait at this spot, but the food is always worth it. They will let you wander Southport and text you when your table is ready; great experience for those dining and those still waiting.

The waiter greeted us almost immediately upon sitting down and explained the layout of their menu, which admittedly was a little confusing upon first look. After bringing us our drinks (a couple of delicious pear-flavored cocktails) the server asked us if we had any dietary restrictions or preference before detailing some of his favorite dishes for us. He was quite friendly and helpful in answering our questions, and once we had ordered continued to be attentive to our needs throughout the evening (maybe even a little too much so). All in all service was a little overbearing at times, especially with a second man I assume was the manager checking in on us as well, though I'm sure they were just doing their jobs.

I went with a group of 5 on Sunday morning - prime brunching time for pretty much the whole city. We waited about 40 minutes and I liked that we could keep track on our phones about our place in line. We got a seat on the patio, which was nice but not super comfortable. Gorgeous weather though and a bit quieter than inside so no complaints.  I started with an Americano (~$3). Pretty good. The jolt I needed for sure. The table ordered a grown up pop tart ($6) to split, which was really tasty but could have used more jam filling. The pastry was delicious though. Bf & I decided to split the Hash with Brisket ($12) and the Sweet & Savory French Toast ($10). The French Toast was above & beyond the best dish ordered at the whole table. The ham & swiss were amazing on top of the bread and the sugary mustard syrup was the perfect complement. If this dish came with a side of fruit or a simple salad it would be the perfect meal. The hash left a bit to be desired, but was okay.  We ordered over easy instead of the menu-stated scrambled eggs, which was definitely a good choice since it was a tad dry. The cheese ended up clumping into a big ball in the middle of the hash and overall it was just a bit bland and undercooked for my taste. The bisket was drier than I had hoped and also a tad bland. Hot sauce perked it up a bit, but be careful! It's habanero hot! Overall I enjoyed breakfast and thought prices were comparable to what I'm used to elsewhere.

2013-09-02,4.0,"Southport Grocery has slowly grown to be one of my favorite brunch places, and definitely my favorite brunch place in the Lakeview/Southport Corridor area. It's a small restaurant, and in the warmer months the seating practically doubles with the outdoor patio. Make sure to arrive early, or be prepared to shop at some of the great boutiques and stores along the street while you wait. The staff is always friendly and everyone seems to have a great attitude, each person helping the other out. We probably had three different servers help us during our last visit, a Wednesday morning on the outdoor patio. Since everything's small, you'll be pretty close to the people next to you, but that's not the worst thing ever. Between the two of us, we ordered the southern screwdriver, beermosa, grown-up pop tart, ham and swiss french toast, and stuffed french toast. I don't normally have a sweet tooth, but it was in full force that day. I would recommend the stuffed french toast, which was served with a blueberry sauce and a lemon cream cheese - so YUMMY!  The price is fair for what you're getting, and never disappoints.

We are new to Chicago so we are in the ""try every place"" phase of our time here. I'm sure glad we did. We sat outside and were greeted by our friendly waiter who told us about the menu, how it works and every suggestion he made was spot on.  We shared a watermelon salad with homemade cream cheese ad green corn relish and for dinner my wife had a Duck Breast Reuben and I had the Pork Shoulder Steak and both were excellent. Apparently 90% of the food served was made on premise (including the greens which were grown on the roof and the house made sausages) and it really came through. Bursting with layers of subtle flavors (but not too heavy handed with the sauces) you could tell each dish was crafted and not simply prepared. We also enjoyed some wine and cocktails which were both excellent. The Rickshaw 2011 Pinot Noir was smoky and complex while my ""Day and Night"" cocktail consisting of a smokey Bourbon (gotta get the name of it - it was gooood!) along with house made ginger beer made for a spicy, smokey treat.  We finished the night off with monkey bread with a chocolate peanut butter dipping sauce and a bread pudding pancake. Are you kidding me? These things were so good I'm skipping the meal next time and just getting the pancakes. I even bought a bag of the mix to make them at home.  I hope I can duplicate the magic... Expect to drop at least $100 for dinner for two with drinks, a shared app, 2 entrees and 2 desserts.

Even though the breakfast menu isn't huge we all still had a difficult time deciding what to order. Two of my dining companions ordered the bruschetta egg dish which looked and smelled so amazing. I might have to try this next time I come by, they both loved it. Another friend ordered the southern omelet and was happy as well. I settled on the chorizo omelet and it was so delicious! The chorizo itself was incredibly flavorful, it complemented the goat cheese and arugula very well. Their omelets come with a side of mashed red potatoes that are awesome. I don't usually go crazy over mashed potatoes, this dish is worth it. I ordered a biscuit on the side because I was told this was a ""must have."" It is. Do it. Fresh, homemade biscuit with a phenomenal jam, this will probably put you over-the-edge full, but it's worth it.

2013-07-21,5.0,"This place totally screams ME - I am self-centered, I admit it, let's keep going so I can tell you a little more. It's a decent size cafe that is simple, serving very fresh ingredients and well-done food. Unassuming atmosphere and friendly services with a local feel to it - I totally fell for all that shit! I live for this kind of place, and truth is I've been meaning to come here for brunch for a while. Genius friends of mine suggested this place for dinner - WIN! According to our server, they have been around for a while (this I know), but only started serving dinner about a month ago (this I did not know). Came here one night with 3 other people, and I was impressed by the food and the concept.  First, my friend shares a rooftop with this cafe, and he told me about the little ""garden"" they have up there. I didn't believe it, so I went to check it out myself. Yup, there were plenty of little pots up there. Now I doubt if they use that for the meals they serve, but it still added an immediate star on my review.  We walked in around 8pn on a Friday night and it wasn't crowded, so we got seated right away. They offered water and the 2 boys got some drinks. My roommate and I both don't usually eat meat, so we shared the kale, tomato salad, mashed potatoes, and mac & cheese. The boys got a burger, tomato salad, some greens, and scallop pancake - they recommended 2 dishes per person, so we got 8. I was happy, but I bet the 2 boys could have had more.  Their menu was a little disorganized i thought, but then the server explained to me that it was i the order of light to heavy dishes, and then it made sense. I actually like it - it make our decision much easier. Most of the food were made to share, and the portion is right with the price. The tomato salad (with feta cheese, arugula, and pesto sauce) was absolutely delicious and refreshing. I'd recommend that to start out the meal. Mac and cheese was very good as well - the touch of morel was aromatic and refine. It sure does leave you wanting more. Everything else was very very very good - we were all satisfied with our food.  For desserts, we had the red velvet cupcake and the pancake (which was more fitting for brunch but still amazing nonetheless). The red velvet came with goat-creamcheese frosting and it was sooooo good! I can probably eat that thing daily! The cake wasn't as moist as I usually like it. But still overall good.  Services were alright. Our server was friendly. They brought us bottles of water so she didn't have to refill our water. You pay at the counter in the end, which I think is smart, because they have tons of little packages of goodies that I wanted to pick up as we were paying. Bill can range anywhere from 20-50 per person depends on food and drinks, but I think you'd leave happy with 20-30/person. Also, they sell bottles of wines for 20-25? I guess I'm so used to wine bottles anywhere from 40-150 (or more) that this shocked me! This place rocks!",0.9982,0.798,0.173,0.029,0.5574588200059899

2013-03-23,5.0,"I have been doing Sunday brunches with friends once every couple of weeks for the past 4 years in Chicago and I think I just landed on gold with this place. After having tried close to a hundred places for brunch, one would think that I would have a group of favorites without a single spot standing out, but Southport Grocery blew all others out of the water with respect to taste. I really do mean it! The taste of everything is absolutely divine!  The place itself is a mini bakery/grocery with a string of tables along the side wall. Interesting way to build it, and certainly catchy. Seems like those types of cafes are becoming more and more popular. The wait was veeery long. We went there at 10:30 AM, which was probably ill-advised on our part because everyone wants in by that time, but there are places you can go around to kill time. After almost an hour long wait, we were seated and since we were starving and had already looked at the menu, we ordered immediately. I had the breakfast sandwich, my friend had the hash, and then we also split a single order of the bread pudding pancake. EVery single bite we had was fantastic. The breakfast sandwich had sausage that was more tasty than anything I have ever tasted, and not as fatty. The red potato mash on the side was hands down the most tasty one I have tried. And then there was the bread pudding pancake that was perfectly gooey and soft inside, not overly sweet, and served with cinnamon-sugar butter and vanilla anglaise that added flavor but were also not very sugary. My friend's hash was also fantastic. I am actually meeting with a few friends for brunch again tomorrow, and I think I may be going back to try a few more items.

2013-03-02,4.0,"There are lots of great places to grab brunch in Chicago. I mean, GREAT places. For that reason primarily, it's tough to rate Southport Grocery ""as good as it gets,"" but as far as brunch or food in general on Southport goes, it's the best, and it's better than your average brunch. As someone who lives five minutes walk from this place, I couldn't be happier to have it nearby. It's small in here and there's usually a wait unless it's freezing out on a weekday or during off-eating hours. They'll call you if you do, and if it's nice you can walk down Southport and window shop in the meantime. Inside, there's a little cafe/grocery area which is surrounding by somewhat formal seating, a straight row of half-booth tables. It's not a casual cafe atmosphere because of how busy it gets, so don't plan on coming in to sit down and get work done while nibbling on a panini. The staff is super friendly, but there aren't so many servers working at once. Occasionally it can take a little time to get more water (they give you empty wine bottles full of water) or catch their attention, so best to go in expecting to take your time and enjoy your meal. And you will. Breakfast or lunch, eggs or pancakes/french toast, the food is heavenly. I had never ordered eggs here until my most recent visit and got the Southern omelet with pimento cheese inside, a mouth-watering biscuit halfed with blueberry jam inside and red-skin mashed potatoes. Normally I love me some home fries, but everything on the plate was to die for. For lunch, their cuban sandwich rocks. It's not that extensive in terms of choices of pancakes or french toasts or omelets, but there's plenty to choose from on the menu as a whole. You can also take a red velvet cupcake to go (it's one of the best even though everyone makes them these days), or easily add any groceries to your bill as you pay at the register.

We started off with coffee and bloody Marys.  I'm not a coffee snob by any means but I do prefer my coffee to be warm/hot, especially on a cold winter day.  Our coffee was lukewarm at best.  As for the bloody Mary...epic fail, probably one of the worst I've ever had.  While they don't skimp on the alcohol,  there was absolutely no flavor.  It was basically like red colored vodka and a little bit of pepper.  If you're thinking of trying an adult beverage here, maybe stick with wine, beer, or one of the easier-to-make cocktails like a mimosa.   For our meal, we ordered the chilaquiles, brisket and gravy, and a side of the bread pudding pancakes (don't judge, I was hungry!).  The chilaquiles had a nice tortilla base but the salsa verde was a bit overpowering. I saw no evidence of the queso fresco advertised on the menu and the chorizo was more of a Panko-chorizo crumble that was very short on the chorizo.  And to top it off....the fried egg was entirely overcooked (we're talking rock hard yolk). The brisket and gravy was pretty decent....though it would have been much better if it was served hot.  It was so disappointing to take that first bite and realize it too was lukewarm.  And lastly, the pancake....I have such fond memories of their bread pudding pancakes and was seriously looking forward to this today.  The pancake was as good as I remembered but the vanilla anglaise (served on the side) was ice cold....literally just pulled out of the refrigerator?!  Who wants to put ice cold sauce on their delishly warm and fluffly pancake?  Not this girl.  I guess if I ever come back, I'll just specify that I'd love it served warm.   One last note....our server was pretty attentive even though she was super busy.  She noticed all the unconsumed items on our table and asked if everything was okay.  I didn't want to point out all the things that kind of sucked as it wasn't her fault, so I just mentioned that it was a bit disappointing.  She kindly gave me a free cupcake of my choice to make up for it.  A small gesture but very much appreciated.   I don't know if I'll come back here again for brunch :(  I feel bad saying that given the good memories I had of this place in years past.  Either they had a really bad day today or maybe they're just going downhill?",0.95,0.758,0.135,0.106,0.5668485958485959

Southport Grocery was on the list along with Smoque BBQ, Spacca Napoli, the MSI Charlie Brown exhibit, a ride on the L and the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" sing-a-long at the Music Box Theater.  He was blown away at how friendly Southport's crew was and how much the gravy tasted like my late grandmother's (it made him cry for Christ's sake). I cannot thank Chris and his crew enough for giving Grandpa Dean a perfect experience that he won't shut up about. P.S. Best table bacon in the City",0.923,0.762,0.163,0.075,0.5130952380952382
2012-12-27,4.0,"This is my gf's favorite place to eat, so I have been there quite a few times and I feel qualified to write this review. Pros:  -I like the bread pudding pancakes and the hash with bacon. The bread pudding pancakes are reason alone to crawl out of bed early to beat the lines. -The coffee is amazingly smooth (seriously you have to try it).  -Apparently this place has a bit of a buzz around it, because I have seen a few Chicago notables dining here (Bears players, local politicians.... etc). Cons: -Be warned it is quite busy and I would expect a generous line if it is a weekend. -It is also a bit cramped and you kinda have to expect to hear other's conversations during your meal, but I think that only adds to the experience. -Beware odd days around holidays (not normal weekend breakfast hours). For example, I went just recently on the morning after Christmas and received mediocre service and old, dry hash browns. I go here often enough to forgive this transgression and stock it up to the ""A"" crew likely being off that day. -Parking stinks and you will likely have to circle the block a few times to find a spot. Overall, I really like this place and would suggest it to anyone looking for a early morning breakfast spot in the Wrigleyville area.",0.431,0.88,0.066,0.054,0.4496666666666666

I would add a dash of BBQ flavor, but otherwise I love the pork, rye, and pickle mix. The sides are also fantastic. The red potato hash and the quinoa are favorites of mine.

Well, that is because it is more like a dessert than breakfast. My favorite has been the red velvet and the bread pudding pancakes. What's not to like about that?!

Basil was scant as was the chorizo. The service was pretty scatterbrained and slow despite how busy they were. my green tea sat too long before being brought over and was bitter.

I will NEVER dine here again, based off my experience with a server, who was less than enthused to be working on Labor day. I called ahead of time to see if Southport was open. I was told that the restaurant closes at 4pm and the kitchen closes at 3:30pm. When we arrived the server did not greet my husband, but simply said (with a disgusting attitude), ""the kitchen closed at 3:30. You can't eat here"" my husband asked the server what time it was, and he responds ""3:21"". Sir, we still have 9 minutes to place our order, and there are seats available. After the server walked away is a flustered fury (I still have no idea what his attitude was about. Never met the man a day in my life) I went directly to the manager to explain to her the situation. The server returns, and starts yelling angrily at the manager (and making a huge scene by the way)!  The manager attempted to calm him down. Offered us free cupcakes (which I politely declined) and said in a calm matter that she apologizes, but the kitchen is backed up and there is no way we could be seated. If the server was polite in the first place, all of this could have been avoided. Long story short, I took down contact information to file a conplaint.  In the moment, the manager should have apologized for the way we were treated, sent the server home for insubordination, and offered us a seat.

These fellows are so full of themselves and enamored of each other that they apparently forget what they are there for.   Too bad, it used to be at least a half-way decent place to get lunch, but in the past year they've lost the good service staff they had and hired on these I'm-a-model-in-my-own-mind poseur-boys.  Good luck with that.  And good luck to you, if you give it a try.",0.8955,0.836,0.095,0.069,0.5162162162162164

2012-06-30,4.0,"I had been wanting to dine at Southport Grocery for some time now, and finally had the opportunity this morning. A group of six of us from the CARA marathon training program bipped over after completing an early morning nine mile jog (I need to have a nice brunch to look forward to in order to inspire me to make it through the grueling long runs). We arrived a little before 9:00am and Southport Grocery was already packed; initially they informed us there was a forty minute wait for a part of our size (most of the tables are two and four tops), but moments later they were able to squeeze us into the outdoor seating. As the sun was beating down (and Chicago was on route to another 90 degree balmy day) we appreciated that they promptly set up a large umbrella to keep us shaded. Southport Grocery is a small boutique grocery store with fresh, high quality local products and they also feature a cafe with a great menu (serving breakfast, lunch and brunch). They open at 8am on weekends (and 7am on weekdays), so are the perfect choice for early risers seeking a more upscale breakfast/brunch than a diner (as most of the other venues with gourmet brunches tend to open later).  After spending some time studying the rather interesting menu I struggled to choose my entree as quite a few items were singing to me. The menu is divided into Trademark Items (a few creative dishes, such as the stuffed French toast I settled on: It was filled with Mascarpone cheese, had a couple preparations of rhubarb and a bourbon syrup). There are also a section with omelets (the one with Spanish chorizo and fresh goat cheese was hard to pass up), a section titled Between Bread with several sandwiches (the grilled brie, described as an adult grilled cheese seemed particularly appealing), a section titled Shareables (with items such as an adult pop tart or more conventional goodies like coffee cake), a section dubbed Out in the Open with fare such as salads, a cheese plate, antipasto etc. and baked goods featuring their cupcakes, scones and muffins. They also have typical breakfast sides available and in addition to coffee and tea they have Bloody Mary's, Mimosas, craft beers (by the bottle) and a couple other adult beverages; there is even a children's menu; definitely something for everybody.  While my stuffed French toast was good, it was not quite as scrumptious as I was hoping and was certainly not memorable. Likewise my Bloody Mary had a nice mix (definitely on the spicy side, so not a good option if you are adverse to some heat) but was garnished with a single pickled asparagus - so a bit plain. Others at the table seemed happy with their meals and the red potato mash (served with the omelets was a hit). Service was also good, not great. While we greatly appreciated them squeezing us in and setting up the umbrella, at times water glasses sat empty (not good after a long run) and coffee refills also were a tad slow. The ambiance also is not quite on par with the food; tables are packed close together and it was a bit noisy (that every other table seemed to have an infant and/or young child definitely contributed to the din).  All in all Southport Grocery is clearly above average in terms of breakfast and lunch venues in Lakeview. For just a couple bucks extra than what you would pay at a place like Stellas or Melrose you can enjoy gourmet food with fresh, local ingredients. While my experience fell short of the best brunches I have had in Chicago, it was certainly good enough that I plan to return and look forward to trying more of what Southport Grocery has to offer.",0.9982,0.798,0.161,0.041,0.44611684834576404

I stumbled upon this place last year, and routinely invite every visiting friend and family member for breakfast at least once during their stay.

2012-06-26,5.0,"My first impressions of this place was a bit unexpected. I was expecting to order at a counter and find a table kind of cafe, but it's actually a wait to be seated (no wait when I was there), and have a waiter take your order. And the grocery section isn't really that but a boutique selection of foods, wines, homemade preserves and condiments, and other interesting finds (volcano salt!). But both of those unexpected sections of SGC add to its unique local feel. I was there to eat lunch and ordered the whitefish sandwich. The fish was cooked perfectly, tender and moist. If I were to order it again, I would order it without what I think was cheese (although I don't see it as an ingredient on the online menu), and add a bit of their famous giardiniera for some heat, but that's just my personal taste. The mixed green side salad was amazing though with fresh greens and a great vinaigrette dressing. Lastly, the service here was very welcoming. I would definitely come back here again.",0.9883,0.824,0.176,0.0,0.5125000000000001

He took my number and said he would ""text"" me when it was ready. We walked around and went in a few stores in the area, and 20 minutes later I got a text saying our table was ready. Pleasantly surprised with the shorter wait, we eagerly sat down to order some food. Per many recommendations, we started off with the grilled coffee cake. Delicious and perfect to  share--a must order! I was feeling ""lunch"", so I ordered the grilled turkey sandwich with broccoli salad on the side. The grilled turkey sandwich was very flavorful, even without the cheese or dressing, which I asked for on the side. The bread was delicious, but there was not much turkey- only a couple slices, and I could have used a little more. The broccoli salad was very good--mayo based, but not too heavy. However, it needed a little salt. Everyone else really enjoyed their food, as well as the cute atmosphere.

Both were delicious, the bruschetta was packed with freshly cut tomatoes and just tasted very light and healthy.   The bread pudding pancake is the best I've ever had. In fact, I'm not even sure if this thing is a pancake. It's like something new that you've never tasted before. The thickness, texture and taste of this pancake is heavenly. It is a must-try. I ordered the solo this time so it only came with one pancake, next time I will likely get the full order ($10) and make it the main meal.  Water is served in a wine bottle and your cup is a jar, I thought that was creative. The place is certainly more upscale than an IHOP, but I felt comfortable having breakfast there in my running attire. I recommend dressing up a bit if you come here for dinner.

2012-06-11,2.0,"The food isn't bad, but the attitude could use some adjustment. I would have given 3 stars, but as always, Yelp only allows 1 rating, so Yelp is actually hurting places like this. Not sure why anyone would wait in line for an hour to get into a place to eat - unless they included a happy ending or stock certificate. When I go to eat I am usually hungry, and if I have to wait more than 20 minutes I usually become famished, - standing in line only turns me into a whining older baby. Okay, so I have issues! I only come here when I find a parking space, otherwise I keep driving. The place is always busy, small, loud, but a nice outdoor eating area in the Spring and Summer - it's always nice to smell exhaust fumes while eating and drinking I think.  The pasta salads to go are good - the regular salad is okay, not crazy about the 'lemonzied' dressing - I get the citrusy thing, but that was all I tasted. The naked Tuna was Ok - I think the Tuna at Suvan's on Lincoln is a LOT better, but that's just my opinion. The interior is ok - cute - nobody has ever greeted me formerly when I entered since they're always so harried and rushed - almost every server and employee is pretty much the same; the younger know everything crowd, not quite yuppie, and not quite hipster. Not sure if they're metro or homo, not like it matters, but I usually like a clear distinction in sexuality - to me there should be no grey area when it comes to that. Sort of like PAT on Saturday night live - or Chaz Bono - even though I know Chaz is now a male,  it's still confusing because she used to be a cute little girl. So again, I have issues, is that so wrong? Now, getting back to my REVIEW.... There is a disorganized separation between a 'quasi-deli' and dining area of tall steel storage shelves. Sort of an afterthought, but I am sure that was all they could come up with since they knew they had to separate the deli area, which consists mainly of 1 cooler and 1 display case. The deli items are mostly overpriced like most expensive and up and coming neighborhoods  - for example, I wanted dark chocolate but was amazed that it was $7.25......my salad and a 1/2 lb of Tuna was only $10....no wonder people are in debt, including myself. I don't care it it's 'ARTISAN' chocolate, or that it was hand made. If that's the case it should be cheaper since the manufacturer doesn't have to pay for the million dollar machines and equipment to make the stuff!  Artisan is just another one of those yuppie catch phrases of trying to justify something that is not worth the price. And because of that word, yuppies and dummies like me will buy it. Unfortunately, I didn't see the price until after I signed the charge receipt. As far as the patrons, most of those I have seen dining in there seem to be those who love to be seen by others - not like I would know them or anyone else would, but you know who you are. I never understood the cold feeling I get whenever I am in an expensive place - it has nothing to do with class, because just as many rich people are as rude if not worse than poor people. It's that general feeling of ""God I am so important, and I am so much more important than you because I know Joe blow."" Speaking of Joe Blow, Is it wrong for 2 ""straight men"" to share a bottle of Pino Grigio at Noon while dining al fresco and wearing very expensive sunglasses and loafers with no socks? I guess not, but I did think it was funny. These are the same type of guys who are fighting over a 20 year old girl even though they are in their late 40's or early 50's - the drill is the same, and they still end up going home alone most of the time. Oops. got off the subject again.... Would I go back to Southport to eat? Yes, they do have good food, but like I said, I also like good attitudes so I would have to bite my tongue, and I promise I won't write another thesis follow up about his place and if I do give an update it will only be because the attitude has improved.",0.9985,0.743,0.189,0.069,0.5647323717948718

2012-05-12,3.0,"I came back to Southport Grocery today after venturing here a few months ago, and sad to say, I was disappointed compared to my first trip out here. We waited nearly an hour to be seated, which I understand is the norm on the weekend when going out for brunch. Upon being seated at nearly 1pm we immediately put in our order as we were ravishingly hungry. I'll break it down as follows: 1) Their coffee: It's always fresh and delicious, and they keep it coming. I'm not for sure what they brew here, but it's delicious. 2) The grown up poptart: We ordered one of these to be shared by the table of three, and it was pretty delicious. It was two layers of dough with a layer of marscapone cheese, blueberries, and walnuts in the middle. It reminded me of a spruced up coffee cake, and it was pretty delicious and large for only being $5. 3) The Southern omelette: This was probably the most appetizing thing that was at our table. One, it was huge, and it had pimento, red onion, and small chunks of sausage in the omelette. It was very flavorful and I gobbled it up rather quickly. This omelette came with a jelly filled biscuit which was dry and flavorless and a side of their potato hash. The potato hash was lukewarm and needed some salt and pepper or some other sort of seasoning--all I tasted was butter (not that that was necessarily bad, but it just needed something else). 4) Side of Bacon: four small, greasy slices of bacon. I could make better bacon with my eyes closed. The other people in the party got the cupcake pancakes and the chilaquiles. The person who got the cupcake pancakes seemed unimpressed and kept asking what made the pancakes ""cupcake"" except for the vanilla sugar butter. As for the person who got the chilaquiles he said it was bland and was disappointed to see only one egg in the dish. I was so sad that they took the steak and eggs off of their menu--that was a phenomenal brunch dish.

First she tells me she can't do it, after I explained they always do, then she came up with the ridculous suggestion that I order it without cheese and get a side order of the one I wanted. Then, she tells me she didn't know whether she could do the side order, but ended up serving the same side order to my friend with her bagel!  I felt like I was in a weird sitcom episode.  I mean, really, it isn't like I am asking for something premade to be deconstructed and I should get an $11 omelette the way I want it.  Service needs to sharpen up.

The brunch menu includes both sandwiches and breakfast items.  The breakfast items are unique and very good - everything from cupcake batter pancakes or bread-pudding pancakes to different options for omelets.  They also source local ingredients so there are usually seasonal specials on their brunch menu.  We enjoyed omelets and a sampling of the cupcake batter and bread pudding pancakes on our visit.  The food was excellent - the eggs and ingredients were hearty and tasty.  The pancakes lived up to our expectations - delicious and sweet. The service is friendly but it seems like Saturday and Sunday brunch is crazy busy for them so our service was a bit uneven.  We asked for hot sauce (with two great options!) and salt and pepper and took them awhile to bring it to our table.  A minor complaint for an otherwise great brunch.,0.9758,0.817,0.155,0.028,0.5466666666666666

2012-02-17,5.0,"Southport Grocery gets 5 stars for being amazing at two of my favorite things: cupcakes and brunch.  These are my favorite cupcakes in this city, subcategory: classic vanilla and chocolate. I'm not sure how they make their frosting, but both chocolate and vanilla are superb. It's the perfect amount of sweet, has a slightly grainy texture that is pretty fantastic, and almost seems to dissolve on your tongue. The cake, while being straight up yellow cake, is moist and delicious. Brunch can get super crowded, yes, but that is true of every place in this town that has brunch worth eating. The space is not enormous, which is part of its charm, and even when the sidewalk seating is available, you're going to have to be prepared to wait (though usually it's not as long as they say it will be). It's well worth it. This is one place that doesn't slack on brunch offerings. A lot of places excel in one brunch area; either they rock the savory, or they have amazingly sinful sweets. Southport does BOTH incredibly well. I usually struggle with whether I want savory or sweet, but they make it extra hard on me. The good news is that they offer their fantastic pancakes (some made from the same batter they use for the cupcakes) singly, so you can get a side of sweet just as easily as you can get a side of eggs or chicken sausage. As someone who is the WORST at decision-making, I super appreciate that I can make the compromise in both directions without feeling like a fat, fat, fatty.

Don't be afraid to ask for one of each type of hot sauce for the table; once you find your favorite, you won't be able to help yourself from buying a bottle to go. As far as the Bread Pudding Pancakes... I wouldn't know where to begin. That good. There's a reason they're mentioned all over this page. I tend to think that brunch is a hard meal to really screw up, but even harder to knock out of the park. That said, Southport Grocery definitely went yard.

We were standing near the ""Please Wait To Be Seated"" sign waiting for the host(ess). About 2 minutes pass and another party walks in, cruises past us and about 10 feet deep into the restaurant to a red headed young man who was, unbeknownst to us, the host. They are inquiring about the wait. I walk up to put my name in and he replies ""well I need to get their names first."" I tell him, ""No. We were here first..waiting over by where you SHOULD be."" We put our names in and wait. About 45 minutes goes by and we can see tables sitting empty. We also see a lot of people standing waiting for a table. We inquire as to why there are multiple tables sitting completely dormant for over 15 minutes in a packed restaurant and the host replies ""we have called them and are waiting for them to arrive"".  The policy is that people may leave and be telephoned when their table is ready. But the policy should have a 2 minute hold policy, not over 15 minutes. Further, the host was unable to see an open 2 person table, scroll down the list to the next set of 2 and seat them. He was only capable of going in exact order of the list and allowing tables and patrons to wait. The point of this story is that I sat there thinking about really popular breakfast establishments (Namely Walker Brothers) and how they are a well-oiled machine with their top host on brunch duty. She has the ability to seat people as quickly as tables open. This kid is better off for a midday shift. It soured my experience and made me think that no matter how good the food is, dealing with this incompetent boob is not worth the wait.",0.9021,0.881,0.079,0.04,0.40429666119321284

I liked their system of taking down your phone number so that you aren't chained to the establishment for the duration of your waiting period.  They sat us right next to the door, and of course it was being opened and closed the whole time. My bloody mary was just ok, not good but not bad. When I asked for another one, the busser whisked away my unfinished drink to literally refill it (without asking). When she returned with my new one, it was watery from the melted ice of my old mary and worse than the first one. I didn't drink much of it.  My table had the hash with brisket, spinach omelet and the bread pudding pancakes. The hash  I could have made myself. The brisket was dry and the potatoes were overcooked. Meh, it could have been worse. The pancakes, though, were very good.  About halfway through our meal, a family with two older babies and a toddler sat next to us. I'm sure I already sound like a bitch, but people PLEASE leave your toddlers at home. In fact, leave all the children who have not yet grasped the idea of table manners at home.

2011-12-20,4.0,"When you gotta eat on a Monday afternoon, choices along the Southport corridor are kinda limited. But The Southport Grocery & Cafe was open, as about 2,499 other people discovered. We arrived almost exactly at noon and were able to be seated right away. That's not to say there were plenty of seats available; there were only a couple, and we were lucky enough to glom onto a table. This place is not huge, and it was slammed! The downside of this for the customer is the noise level. I think half of our conversation was composed of ""what?"" and ""huh?"", and we had to lean in close with hands cupped around our ears to hear each other. Certainly the noise level is not the restaurant's fault, but customers should be aware, this is not the place to have an intimate, quiet conversation. You've got to speak LOUD to be heard above the hubbub. We got menus and placed a drink order quickly. We only had coffee, although the Cafe does offer some alcoholic selections. I don't know the brand of the coffee. I am becoming a coffee snob, and this was good, nothing great.  We went with lunch items, although breakfast items are still available mid-day. You get to select one of several sides. I ordered the Veggie Sandwich with a side of butternut squash quinoa for $8.00. My friend ordered the Grilled Brie for $9.50, also with the squash quinoa. We waited a reasonable amount of time for our entrees. Both were very good and very filling. I'd try either one again. Service suffered due to the crush of people. Or maybe there were one server short? In my ex-restaurant worker opinion, they needed another server. It was pretty impossible to get a refill on the coffee, and the coffee cup you get is really small. We sat and stared at our empty plates for a while, too. The stressed service also showed in the payment. There is a number at each table. We sat for quite a while, waiting for our check, and finally, we were able to snag down a server in the middle of his marathon run. He told us, you take the number to the counter and pay there. Well, we would have been out of there 15 minutes sooner if we'd known. It's not like we were given a set of instructions when we sat down. So beware, you will NOT get a check; you will take your number to the register and pay there. That does make it a little harder to tip fairly, because you don't know the exact amount you owe until you get up and leave the table. The woman at the register asked us, do you want to pay separately or together? I appreciate that. We chose to pay separately. That made life easier. Would I go again? Yeah, sure. But I'd prefer to go at an off-time, when I can actually hear conversation. And now that I've been schooled in the payment procedures, I'll be able to leave when I'm ready.",0.9392,0.846,0.088,0.066,0.5120833333333333
2011-12-05,5.0,"This is my favorite brunch spot in the neighborhood.  The staff here is adequate and the wait is long, these are things to expect and measure your experience by them.  The place does not take reservations is always jammed, as a result don't expect 5 stars on service.  Also, the prices are quite managable for a sit down that is on the gourmet side - items are generalyy $9 - $12.  The food crushses the typical neighborhood bar and is right in the same price range, perhaps even cheaper.   I have gone both the breakfast route and the lunch route for brnch both are hit.  You can't go wrong. My favorite lunch item is the grilled turkey sandwich.  It comes out full of taste and turkey.  The ragout and aiola bring this thing together on delicious, thick cut bread.  The cuban is also an excellent choice, briket takes it to another level.  For under $10 you can't go wrong with these orders.  Also you get a side with the sammie.  I have to say that the broccoli salad is my favorite, light and refreshing.  The potato salad is solid but nothing fancy, same goes for the salad. Onto breakfast.  I am not a sweets guy but oh my god, the cupcake pancakes are amazing.  They are what they sound like, quite decadent but worth it if you can handle a huge pile of sweets.  Stuffed French Toast is also excellent, the filling is a home run and is a fun take on classic french toast.  Hash is packed full of flavor and the white cheddar is excellent! At the end of the day, the bang for your buck is awesome.  Just don't expect Ritz Carltonesque service.  If I had to choose I'd go lunch over breakfast, but if you have a flavor for something sweet, run after the cupcake pancakes! ps Sign up for their email list and they'll give you a free birthday cupcake on the month of your birthday.  Nice touch!",0.9955,0.795,0.182,0.023,0.5888778659611993

At one point she literally said ""oh, i've had it out on the counter have just forgot to bring it to you"".... the real kicker is when my boyfriend FOUND A PRODUCE STICKER stuck to the cooked tomato in his hash!! Did they wash their produce before cooking it? Not a good question to be asking yourself yet is pretty hard not to think when something like that happens. When we told our waitress she curtly apologized but no one from the kitchen staff came out to apologize NOR was the item comped from our bill.  i adore the food here but it's pretty clear they are sacrificing quality service  to keep a focus on their amazing food....and frankly there are too many places in Chicago that do BOTH well that it will make me think twice about going back.",0.9913,0.788,0.18,0.032,0.6655982905982907

To top if off, the table had to order the Cupcake Pancakes to share. Omg, out of this world! They use their special cupcake batter which is light and not too sweet. Southport also has mimosas and blood marys which are pretty tasty. Once we got our bill we were able to pay at the counter.

At this hour, the inside was pretty packed solid, but there were a few spots outside that were just the right size for our group of 4. Our waitress was so strange, but I found it intriguing and entertaining. I think she was just a bit of a hippy, but she was so happy to be at work, friendly and responsive, that I loved her. And I hope she is always our waitress whenever we come back. I ordered the ""red meat"" omelette. For those of you who know me, this might seem odd, as I don't eat red meat. But, I DO eat Spanish chorizo. Yum! Anyway, it was chorizo, arugula and goat cheese (which I also love). The omelette was good but too runny! I'll have to agree with Coleen C. on that one. Way way way too runny. If I wanted a runny egg, I would order one. I want a cooked egg omelette. I also wished the pieces of chorizo were a bit larger. They were too small and too few. Boo. The red mash potatoes were AMAZING. There is definitely some sour cream in there and wow, I loved them. I could have eaten a huge plate of those suckers. The toast was hard = fail.  I would definitely come back here, because all of the food actually looked really good. I would skip the omelette, or maybe ask them to make sure it is cooked all the way through. Or, I would just order my usual scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast.

About 25 minutes later, they called to say our table was ready! super fast!

Our hostess was so friendly and efficient about it we totally didn't mind, but her offer of a free cupcake to make it up to us certainly didn't hurt! True to her word, we were seated within about 5 minutes in a lovely window table. Since we had the cupcake for dessert, we decided to go with two savory dishes and share! (we love sharing. having friends who will split entrees with me is like a main requirement of friendship). ANYWAY, we got the bruschetta and the southern omelette (as an atlantan, I have an obsession with pimento cheese) and they were the best savory dishes I've ever had. Seriously.

I for one really don't like mushrooms so I asked for my hash with none and instead of scrambled eggs a fried egg. Nothing too extreme. One other person ordered the brisket and gravy with egg whites. This was the one the chef seemed most mad about. When it came out the egg whites weren't done and just looked unappetizing. Not a huge problem though because the rest of it was delicious.  When we went to pay we asked the cashier to split the check three ways and he wouldn't. Again a bit odd because on the menu it says they will split the check a max of 3 ways. I'm not sure if he didn't know how to or just didn't want to. Usually this wouldn't be an issue but the other people were from out of town so its not like one person could pick up the check this time and someone else another time.  All said and done it was a little rough. I'll be back but I wouldn't go back with a large group and I will definitely just bring cash with me next time.",-0.4745,0.833,0.074,0.093,0.5286935286935287

Third, order your meal, gank some of your friends', and split one of the pancake dishes. In my case, the roast beef melt sans mayo with a side of mustard and the butternut squash quinoa salad was ideal. I also loved my friend's chorizo, arugula, and goat cheese omelet and the Co-Op Hot Sauce on my wife's red potato mash. The ingredients made the meal, but it was a 4-star brunch until the bread pudding pancakes. With the first bite, I sat back and just let the serotonin seep in. Gratified, I thought I would let the rest of the pancakes sit. Perhaps I blacked out, but before we left, I had downed the rest of the perfectly undercooked bread pudding mixture doused in vanilla custard sauce.

They have, by far, the best cupcakes in Chicago (much better than Sweet Mandy B's) with rich creamy frosting (not shortening based) and the perfect density of homemade cake.  After not having been to Southport Grocery for at least a year, I was visiting Chicago this past weekend and stopped in for lunch. I had one of their new gluten-free vanilla cupcakes (this was never on the menu before, and my stomach thanks them!) and it was pretty similar to the regular vanilla cupcake. They've also added a bunch of vegan sweets that were never on the menu before. Unfortunately, the tater tots that used to come with most of the meals have been replaced by a potato mash, though it's very good, so it's not too disappointing. I had a vegetable sandwich with greens; it wasn't too exciting but everything was very fresh. Everyone else's meals looked fantastic as well. They even include homemade biscuits and jam if you order breakfast. The small grocery area is as wonderful as always. Local honeys, jams, chocolates, caramels, spices, sauces, etc. abound. There is also a good wine selection.  There is always a wait, so make sure to put your name in and they will call you.

2011-02-20,5.0,"We happened upon Southport by chance. We were going to have breakfast at another place but I wanted to pick up the A La Card deck before heading out. There are only 3 places in Lakeview that sell the deck and the first place we tried wasn't open yet. Thank goodness for that because we then headed to Southport. When we walked in about 10:00 there was a 20-25 minute wait and we opted to just stay and have breakfast here instead of our original destination. We took that time to buy our Restaurant Card deck and browse their grocery section. It's small but they have some very cool stuff in there! I saw a bunch of things I would love to buy especially some unique items I could use in my baking like cute school bus sprinkles and white brownie supplies! They also were handing out Alterra Coffee to those of us waiting...sweet! We were sat within 20 minutes and looked over the menu. I ordered the Ham & Cheese omelet and we decided to split a bread pudding pancake. I liked the classy water on the table. We had a few different guys take care of us (tips are communal between everyone so expect to be served & helped my many throughout your trip) but they were all amazing! Everyone working there seemed to genuinely like what they were doing, very helpful and just very pleasant.  The food was scrumptious beyond belief! I first tried the bread pudding pancakes ($5)...oh...my...goodness!!! They are amazing!!!! Let's get something straight, I don't  like bread pudding. And I'm not a big fan of pancakes either. But these pancakes! Ohhhh these pancakes! Outside of these being super tasty, I have never had anything similar to this in my life. It was a pancake filled with the bread pudding...so moist, just like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I preferred my bites without the vanilla topping they put on the side that you can drench the pancakes with. The sauce is not necessary though. Honestly, these are AMAZING! I want to try the cupcake pancakes quite badly now!  My omelet ($9) was also just delish. Again, I don't like leeks but the combination of them in this omelet blended perfectly with the ham, mushrooms and cheese. I would even venture to say it was the best omelet I've ever had. It came with red potato hash which I kept second guessing myself trying to decide if it had cheese in it. Either way, it was just fantastic. I loved the skins in the mash. I tried some of my friends Brisket & gravy ($9), the eggs were cooked perfectly and the gravy was delicious! When you finish, you take your check up to pay & there is a tip jar up there for all the guys. A super-dee-duper tall fellow convinced us to get their last Salty Caramel Cupcake of the morning rotation (they change the special cupcake daily). Oh my goodness, the salty with the sweet...the way it hits your taste buds in waves is fantastic. They have some of the absolute best cupcakes I've ever had! Next time I go back I plan to focus on their cupcakes and get more of a variety to test. Overall, the restaurant is fairly loud and you are in very close quarters with your fellow diners so be prepared. Service is excellent, the food is all delicious, the prices are not expensive at all (amazing value for the money) and this has now replaced Sweet & Savories as my favorite breakfast place in the city!",0.9995,0.742,0.238,0.021,0.6005706075533662
2011-02-09,4.0,"Good brunch. Great sweets. Sunday around noon, we waited 25 minutes for a two top. The hostess calls your cell when a table is free. The space is really small. Tables are close together. Groups larger than 4 might feel cramped, but there is 1 table available that can seat 6 (maybe 8?). The noise level can get loud. Portion sizes are similar to M Henry and Perennial, smaller than The Bongo Room.  BRUSCHETTA ($9): crostini topped w/ scrambled eggs, smoked chicken sausage, tomato red onion balsamic mix, and queso fresco. Good but nothing I would need to order again.  BREAD PUDDING PANCAKES ($9): pancakes made w/ gooey bread pudding batter topped with cinnamon sugar butter and vanilla custard sauce. Excellent! Aside from the great flavor, the texture of the pancakes is noteworthy b/c they were extremely tender and not dense/doughy as some people have commented of the pancakes at The Bongo Room. However, pancakes from The Bongo Room are only $0.25 more than Southport Grocery & Cafe's and the portion is significantly larger. Nevertheless, if you enjoy sweets, these are a must try. Highly recommend. BANANA COCONUT FRENCH TOAST ($10): French toast dipped in soy coconut banana batter and topped w/ roasted banana chocolate syrup. Good but unmemorable. I didn't taste the soy. I prefer thick French toast so their bread was sliced a little too thin for me. The chocolate drizzle was the predominant flavor.  VANILLA CUPCAKE ($2.25): I really liked this cupcake. Simple but well executed. Dense yet moist. Good vanilla flavor. And $1+ cheaper than many cupcake shops in the city. Frosting has a similar texture to that of Sweet Mandy B's (e.g. slightly gritty but not unpleasantly so). I would get this again.  DOUBLE DUTCH CHOCOLATE BROWNIE ($2.50): I loved this brownie! Generous piece, thick, rich, moist, slightly crisped top, hint of espresso. Can't stop thinking about this wonderful confection.

We went for their super secret supper again last night.  The first thing they said when we walked in the door: ""Were you informed of the seating arrangements?"".  No, we were not.  They said they were going to sit us upstairs in the bakery.  Fine.  I am sure they will make it extra special and cute and everything in exchange for not sitting in the main dining room.  Well, that didn't happen.  It was like sitting in a poorly lit, chilly closet.  They tried to make us feel ""special"", like ""ooo, no one ever gets to see it up here!"".  It was like trying to convince a 2 year old that getting a shot in the arm is going to be really fun.  It wasn't like there was a cooking demo, or anything of the sort.  We sat in their storage closet/bakery.  For real.  Others convinced me to stay, because we knew the food would be good.  The food was good.  It was exceptional.  The food didn't let me down.  However, I am quite jaded about the experience.  I thought they had a little more tact than that.  I mean they could have been creative with it and made it an experience - like a mini-tasting of baked goods from the bakery we ate in.  Or making it candle lit without the gross fluorescent bulbs.  There was potential, and it was not reached.

2010-11-12,5.0,"Full review in blog: Arriving at the small shop and finding ample free parking we made our way in to find only one table occupied and we were sat immediately by our friendly and pleasant waitress. With menus presented my seating did not last long - seeing the bakery case and shelves upon shelves of amazing looking goods I was up browsing within minutes.  Identifying at least 10 things that sounded excellent in the bakery case and on the shelves I made my way back to the seat and found another ten items on the menu that also sounded good.  Offering to buy each of my companions a bakery selection on the provision that I get to try a bite they gladly accepted and made their way to the case to browse. With the three of us finally seated, waters filled, and tea ordered for my sister with Intelligentsia El Diablo for myself our waitress returned to take orders - a total of seven items for three people she warned us that it would be a lot of food but I assured her we'd be alright.  Chatting and again browsing the store while we waited I was appropriately impressed - Foie Gras in the refrigerated section, Columbus' own Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams in the freezer case, and even Scott Conant's famous Tomato Sauce on the shelf. Returning to our seats our bakery appetizer courses arrived quickly - and all were much bigger than they looked in the case.  Beginning with Nate's selection, a Vegan Blueberry Cornbread Muffin, we all took a bite and everyone agreed - sweetened only by the copious number of berries and perhaps a touch of sugar the muffin was dense without being heavy, toothsome without being chewy, and moist yet crumbly - it was very very good. Moving next to my sister's choice - the grilled sour cream coffee cake topped with Zingerman's cream cheese.  An enormous portion - easily enough for a party of 2-3 to share the coffee cake itself was lovely and baked to perfection.  Incredibly moist, tangy, and loaded with cinnamon, walnuts, and sugar the cake was buttered on each side, griddled,  and then loaded with cream cheese prior to plating adding a whole extra level of luxury to an already rich dish.  A must order for anyone who loves coffee cake. For my appetizer it had to be the cupcake - and an excellent cupcake it is.  Small and pricey at $3 the ""simple"" chocolate cupcake features local European style butter, dutch processed cocoa, and the smoothest frosting you can imagine loaded with Nielsen Massey vanilla extract.  Dense and moist, springy and luxurious it was definitely in my top 5 cupcakes all time...I only wish they had more flavors. Moving on to more sinful selections my sister opted for the cupcake pancakes - that's right, pancakes made from the same luxurious batter (sans cocoa) as the signature cupcake.  Somewhat more crispy on the exterior than the average pancakes but with a moist and intoxicating interior almost like a custard the stack of three cakes was topped with sweetened vanilla bean butter and a ""ration"" of pure maple syrup.  Tasting quite akin to the cupcake the only way this dish could've been better is if it were slathered with the same frosting as the cupcakes themselves. Knowing going in the door that the Bread Pudding Pancakes were at the top of my ""must order"" list I was thrilled to find out they offered single cakes - this would allow me to sample more than one ""main course.""  Fascinated by the marriage of two of my favorite foods - bread pudding and pancakes - expectations for the dish were high and fortunately were not only met, but trumped.  Described at length on their site from their inception to the recipe all I can say is that the pancakes are a little slice of heaven in the form of a pancake, or bread pudding, or whatever. For my actual main course the selection of the day came down to a decision between two types of French Toast - and eventually the victor was Stuffed french toast with seasonal local apples, cream cheese, streusel, soy-maple reduction & pralines, plus a ""ration"" of local apple butter.  Buttery and crisp on the exterior with an admixture of apple, cream cheese, and streusel inside the custardy bread the French Toast itself was exemplary, but what truly made the dish was the sweet yet savory reduction which tasted like a 50/50 blend of soy sauce and pure maple syrup.  Topped with toasty candied almonds and a cinnamon spiked apple puree the whole amalgam was nicely balanced, beautiful, and entirely satisfying. Reading the above review some people may call me gushing and I have to say I cannot disagree.  From the store to the setting to the free parking to the service to the food Southport is doing everything right.  As someone who has visited many of the ""best"" breakfast and brunch places in the United States I can definitively say that Southport Grocery and Café, their cupcake, their coffee cake, and their pancake all rank in my all time top 5 - there is no doubt I'll be back.",0.9991,0.828,0.158,0.014,0.5269137806637807

This is one of the best brunch places ever.  The menu offers a great variety of options and we could not decide so we decided to sample as much as we could. We split the hamburger with goat cheese and the southport cuban. You have to sample the bread pudding pancakes. Our selections were the perfect choices for sweet and savory. The iced tea here is also fantastic. I thought the neighborhood is really cute and a great way to kill time while you wait is to visit Anthropologie.

2010-10-12,5.0,"I don't know why it's taken me this long to review Southport Grocery and Cafe! They are wonderful and definitely one of my favorite brunch places in the city. Every time I come here, I get the same thing: the chorizo, arugula, and goat cheese omelet. I know, I know. There are some ridiculously good sweet dishes on the menu, and I'm silly to keep ordering this instead of trying them, especially since every time one is placed on the table next to mine I basically drool over it. But I love this omelet. It's the perfect balance of creamy to salty to savory and it's magic. And even if I didn't love the omelet, I love the potatoes enough to make up for it. You see, the sweet dishes don't come with the red potato mash. I could order it on the side with the bread pudding pancakes I've been dying to order, but I have a feeling I'd neglect the pancakes in favor of the potatoes. They're just that good. As an iced tea lover, I feel compelled to mention how good their iced tea is. Always freshly brewed, and the waiters are constantly coming by to refill your glass. There's something a little.. fruity? to the iced tea--maybe they have a blend of teas in it. Either way, I like it a whole bunch! I wish the wait weren't so long in the winter time (I've waited up to an hour), but at least they don't make you wait in the restaurant. They take down your cell phone number and give you a call when you're close to being seated. Plus, they have an Anthropologie a couple storefronts down, so I find plenty of diversionary activities. I would give Southport Grocery and Cafe four stars, but they serve Jeni's ice cream. It is THE BEST ice cream I've ever eaten. Better than Black Dog Gelato.

I was wrong - I left feeling just the right amount of full (satisfied but not gross/with unbuttoned pants). I liked the checkout method - you bring your table number to the cashier and they find your ticket and ring you up.

I had the ham & cheese omelette, and my fiancee had the cupcake pancakes with a side of sausage patties. I thought the omelette was good and the red potato mash  on the side was excellent - my favorite part of the meal. My fiancee loved her cupcake pancakes - I tried them and was not as impressed. To me they were a little too thin, and a little too sugary. Also, we were both thoroughly disappointed with the sausage patty. The menu describes it as ""patties"" so we were surprised that it was just a giant meat ball that came out. We were thinking more along the line of flat circles, but we got a giant ball. And the taste left something to be desired. For $4, I'd say you should avoid this side dish. The restaurant also does few ""extra"" things that I like, such as having the water come out in a nice large glass bottle for you to pour on your own. Also, I always like it when the coffee (which was also decent) is brought to you in a little pitcher so you can refill on your own. One of the things I didn't like about the place was the size. It can be a little cramped and crowded in there, and the wait can sometimes be long. They will take your cell phone number and call you when your table is ready though, so at least that is nice. You can walk around the fun Southport area while you wait. As far as the ""grocery"" part goes, it is mostly an eclectic selection of organic products, wines, pasta sauces, and things like that. They are of course very pricey, but if you're into that sort of thing I'm sure you'd love it. Me, I personally wish they didn't have any grocery part and just used that space for more tables, which would reduce the wait for weekend brunch. But I'm sure I'm in the minority there. So in the end, I'll go with 4 stars, because most of the food was good, or at least satisfactory (not counting the meat patty ball thing).

It seems like everyone and their mother has been to Sopo Gro a bajillion times and here I am lil' ol' me going for the first time today.  Sorry. I've been busy.  The tales of moms and their kids and baby strollers sent me running away a little. The long lines that I would see on Sunday mornings as I would be on my way to work scared me even more. There it sat. Tasting their cupcakes, thinking... I must get over my fear. I must go. I need some water. Finally today, meeting with a former client with her adorable lil' girl, (and yes, baby stroller in tow), I made it to lunch here. Found parking less than a block away, strolled in and found two lovely ladies waiting for me. I sat down, starving and as we caught up I perused my options. Plenty of goodies all around sandwiches, burgers, salads and appetizers all around, a tasty breakfast on the back and plenty of drinks to quench ones thirst. Since this is a grocery as well, a small selection of wine, pastas, goodies both to be stored and savored all around.  My Cuban sandwich was tasty. It was their version of a Cuban, so if it isn't pressed down, don't you worry, it isn't you, it's them. Plenty of meat, melted cheese and all on toasted bread. It made me feel like I was having a ""umphed"" up grilled cheese. Their slaw of red cabbage was good, but nothing that made me jump out of my seat and demand seconds for. My client had a salad that she practically inhaled.  And of course, needing something to snack on of the sweet variety for later, I opted away from their ever so famous cupcakes and went with two chocolate chip cookies and chocolate brownie. Having just finished off a cookie, I can say they were quite quite delicious. My client squealed with delight as they found her a single gluten free cupcake. It must have been magic because one minute she was munching on her cupcake, the next it was gone with only proclamations that it was the best GF cupcake she has ever had.  The staff was extra friendly and helpful with a side of always disappearing when not needed but magically appearing when they were, sorcery I tell ya.  Prices were fine, definitely par for the area.

Our server was awesome - she was super friendly and on top of it. Dinner was fantastic: Roasted asparagus, brie and pea shoot salad with slices of rhubarb.  Green garlic butter poached halibut with wild rice, breakfast radish and turnips.  Chocolate rhubarb tart with Jeni's salty caramel ice cream. Let me just say - I've been wanting to try a salty caramel ice cream for ages and this lived up to every salty sweet aching I've ever had. Oh! And the other food - the halibut was melt-in-your-mouth butter smooth and the wild rice was crunchy in a wild way. Wonderful!!

I would love to come back and eat the yummy sounding food sometime. I can only give 3 out of 4 stars because the massive crowd made me a bit glad I wasn't staying for food- hopefully they will expand to a larger location.

2010-02-22,4.0,"I'd heard and read a lot of good things about this place. So on a cold Saturday morning, we made the trek up here to get brunch. It's pretty standard to have a 20 - 25 minute wait for two, unless you're ok with community style seating, but really, given how close tables are in most brunch places, it's pretty much the same thing. I like that they err on the side of caution by telling you a wait time that's longer than it actually turns out to be. I like even more that they call you when you're up, so you can go off wandering around - and there's enough to do right next to this place. Solid Bloody Mary, not too stiff, but unfortunately, didn't quite have that spicy kick that differentiates a good Bloody Mary from a great one. The Mushroom Brie was nice, a little too salty maybe, but the Stuffed French Toast with Granny Smith apples was ridiculously delicious. It's fairly unique in that I haven't seen this French toast variant in a of other brunch places. My brunch companion said it best when she described the ambience as an upscale Goddess and Grocer. You kinda get that vibe of a nice café combined with a grocery store.  I'm thinking a 3.5 tending towards a 4.",0.9856,0.759,0.185,0.056,0.5382488479262674
2010-02-21,5.0,"Sometimes I have fantasies about sleeping inside a loaf of bread. Before you dismiss me, hear me out: bread is soft, warm and delicious smelling.  Sounds like the perfect place for a nap to me. Southport Grocery makes the bread I dream about napping in. They refer to it as ciabatta, I refer to it as nirvana.  After passing on Leo's Coney Island (SO glad they're here but totes sad I'll have to wait until the hoopla dies down to appreciate) because of an hour-long wait, the bf and I went to Southport Grocery. He's raved about this place for awhile, but this was my first time.  We walked in to a well-lit, cozy and BUSY place. For two there was a 20-minute wait, which isn't too bad for a happenin' brunch spot. Plus, SPG has fancy groceries and pastries you can oogle at and coffee you can order while you wait. However, it's not a place that's designed to be full. You're tripping over people if it is and that irritates me as a quasi-claustrophobic. I'd take away half a star, but then I think about the ciabatta and all's right with the world. Also, everyone that works there is very friendly. I had the grilled brie. I've already mentioned the bread. Holy cats. If it was just buttered, toasted bread, I would probably still order it and give SPG five stars. There was also yummy melted brie, sauteed mushrooms and spinach on the sandwich complimented by a butternut squash quinoa salad on the side. MMMMMMMMM. It was perfection--easily the best grilled cheese of my life. I am excited to return to SPG, but I'll probably never order anything else!",0.9812,0.847,0.127,0.026,0.6024276377217554

Today our table had the stuffed french toast, the steak and eggs, the brisket/biscuits/fried eggs, and one of the daily menu specials, the torta.  We were all very pleased with out meals, stuffed, and would definitely come back. Only drawback was our wait was over an hour...but what can you expect as such a tasty spot on a Sunday around noon!  And like another review states, the hostess takes your phone number so you can enjoy some of the shops on Southport while you're waiting...

2010-02-19,4.0,"A sunny Winter's day. And me with time for lunch in the neighborhood. Where to go? Problem solved by the Southport Grocery and Cafe. Now this has been on my list for awhile but for breakfast, not for lunch. So I had no idea what would be waiting for me as I pulled open the door and walked inside.  Since we were at the tail end of the lunch rush, we were seated immediately. The noise level in the place was high and people were bustling to and fro.  The menu placed before me was interesting with made from scratch offerings at the top that allowed me to choose large or small portions of soups, cheeses, cured meats and salads with a list of sandwiches at the bottom.  I went with the grilled turkey sandwich and my friend had the corned lamb sandwich. I also tried the soup of the day which was a pureed cauliflower served with a crusty grain roll.  The food was quite good. My turkey sandwich came with turkey, melted muenster cheese, watercress, caramelized onion and a little Russian dressing on a whole grain bread . The side took me aside as what I thought was going to be cold potato salad- was actually warm mashed red potatoes. Good but unexpected. And my friend's lamb? It came with sun dried tomato aioli and fontana cheese on a dark rye. Tasty and unusual.  And what would lunch be without a stop at the bakery counter to pick up a couple of cupcakes to enjoy later. The perfect sized treat!  Lunch for two ran about $30 and know if you go that to pay- you take your table number (and stand) up to the counter and pay. Tips are pooled so everyone shares. While you are paying- take a look around at the shelves full of organic sauces and such; there are even interesting cookbooks for sale. Ask for a sample of something as they will surely give you a taste before you buy.  Still haven't gotten to Southport Grocery and Cafe for brunch but now I am motivated more than ever given the breakfast menu that I saw. Think I'll wait til Spring, though, as I'd love to sit out front at the cafe tables and watch the world go by.",0.995,0.832,0.148,0.02,0.5410170487948266

It's fantastic. Everything I could ask for out of breakfast.  What do I ask for out of breakfast/brunch? Eggs. Potatoes (of any kind) and yep, that about wraps it up. Oh well veggies too. Fantastically enough, the hash has no meat in it unlike the typical corned beef hash. So, props for that. Last time I went we ordered the scrambled egg bruschetta in addition to our main dishes for brunch. LAY OFF, we were starving! Ooo Chris Farley...anyways... Bruschetta? Not so good. The combo of the eggs with the vinegar/oil with tomatoes was just not the best pairing.  Service is never a problem, they know it's packed and they are on it. I also had the veg sandwich (to-go, for the next day) and that wasn't very good. The veggies seemed marinated and the veggie selection was not what I want on a sandwich- carrots..zucchini.

Unfortunately, they lose a lot of points on atmosphere in my book.          Let me start by saying their bake goods are excellent especially their Cupcakes & Cookies. I am a huge fan of their cupcake pancakes for breakfast (think gourmet cupcakes, not international house of pancakes goofy type stuff).  Their omelets are well made and their ingredients are top quality (most of them can be purchased in their grocery section).          Unfortunately, they are usually packed with small children. It often feels like you are eating in the middle of daycare center. Furthermore, the seating is very close together and it feels like the people next to you are involved in your conversation (or crying in your ear, depending on who's next to you). If you previously had a rough night drinking this is a place you want to AVOID. However, if you're looking for a kid friendly place, on bar heavy Southport street this is a great choice.         I would probably rate this more like a 3.5.

2010-01-25,4.0,"Mmmmm. Yummm. When you're in a cycle of compensation of [way too much] for food, you gotta make sure that you're going to the right place. First time I came here was five or so years ago. I came with some friends who are now living in the 'burbs with a couple of kids. At that time, we were all cool urbanites looking for a good breakfast on a Saturday. We were attacked by poorly-behaved children and barely escaped with our sanity. Seriously, folks. Watching your kids throw things and scream how much they hate you...not so much fun for other people. I told myself that I was done with this place until I had children and could understand their mysterious ways. Fast forward to now. I came back on a Friday. There were less kids. They were better behaved. The parents still knocked me over with their double-wide strollers. I still shot over a patented side-eye. This looked like it might be a retread of the '00 years. But, wait. What's that? What is this menu with all of these wonderful food selections? Remember from the beginning: a perpetual lack of [way too much] makes me excessively cranky. Food gets me through. And this food is goood. I ordered the chorizo, arugula & goat cheese omelet with the red potatoes. I washed it down with an iced herbal tea and topped it off with a taste of the cupcake pancake.  I needed a cigarette.  Wow. The folks in the kitchen know what they're doing. My omelet was a great mix of savory flavors and hearty ingredients. It was just the right amount of food to satiate my hunger. The potatoes were creamy, well seasoned and every bit as delicious as the main dish. My tea was refreshing & crisp and my waitress kept my glass full at all times. Speaking of the waitress, she was fun. She had a sense of humor, knew the menu and checked on us repeatedly without hovering. Well done. The cupcake pancake was every bit as good as others have written. It tastes just like a vanilla pancake  -- but flat. And hot. And, served with maple syrup and vanilla sugar butter. If you can find anything wrong with the above sentence, put yourself in timeout. Once I have kids, this place'll get five stars.

To improve my brunch, SGC now bakes Gluten-free Vanilla Cupcakes available for $3 a pop (reasonable when it comes to GF items).  It was super tasty and crumbles in your mouth.

We also ordered a side of the red skin potatoes and they were creamy and heavenly. We also shared the bread pudding pancakes and they were sinful. Everything was clearly homemade and fresh and gourmet! I would suggest this wonderful spot to anyone. Can't wait to go back and try some of their lunch items.

2009-12-05,5.0,"Well, today was probably the tenth time I've been here this calendar year.  I've been debating between giving it four or five stars, which is why this review has taken so long.  However I will say up front this is my favorite place for Brunch in the city these days.   Like any popular Chicago Brunch location, it is best to go on a weekday if your job affords you that luxury.  If you go on a weekend, prepare to wait about an hour, and definitely longer in the Summer. Luckily they will take your cell phone number and call you when it's ready.  This is a perfect place to bring your a special lady in your life because you can shop, er, she can shop, up and down Southport until you get a call telling you that your table is ready. It ends up being a very productive morning capped off by a meal that is absolutely delicious!   The options are a plenty here.  My personal favorites:   1) Stuffed French Toast 2) Spinach-Artichoke Omelet 3) Brisket & Gravy 4) Bread Pudding Pancakes and/or the Cupcake Pancakes (I prefer to get a ""taste""  of each which is another thing I love about this place). 5) The Hash    Also, they need a Police Officer out there to arrest anyone who doesn't walkout with a cupcake or two to go. These Cupcakes are amongst the best in the City. If you go for brunch, definitely get a couple boxed up to go to have for dessert after dinner later on that evening.  Trust me.   I could go on and on about the food, the service is great and my hat goes off to management for hiring a competent and warm staff.     For those of you that have never been, I want to give you a heads up it is ""cozy"" in there.  Just today I found out that the young lady at the table to my right was pregnant and didn't want to tell her fiancee until after Christmas.  The middle-aged gentlemen to my left just got promoted to Vice President of Sales for his company he's been working at for 15 years.     I could go on and on about the stories I've overheard in my visits here, but a lot of them are too cutting edge to print on this site! Point being?  The seating is super tight. Just enjoy it and start your day off at this wonderful gem on Southport. If you live in 60657 and haven't been there yet, you need to make this place a priority. Just don't go the same day I do because I don't want to wait more than an hour ;-) & oh yeah, if you're hungover, get a bloody mary.  They would be number 6 on my list.",0.9936,0.834,0.144,0.023,0.5361424394319132

I could have easily eaten an entire order, especially when it is smothered in that cinnamon butter...yum!

2009-08-11,1.0,"I've had random things from here; all of them passable but way too overpriced, but that's not the reason for a 1 star review. That's totally because of the staff.  Arrogant asses who are too busy to be bothered to do their job. I just went in for takeout & asked a staffer who was standing around doing nothing if I could see a menu. He vaguely gestured to the stand; ""they're over there"". Really? You won't walk the 5 feet and hand it to me? You know, act like you're happy to help a customer?  I've gone in at breakfast time and gotten similar treatment. I was the only one there & I'm standing at the register while 4 employees gossip about their night before. I didn't get any service until I opened my mouth to ask if maybe someone wanted to take my order. Sorry it was a measly pastry thing and that's not important enough for you. Oh, and the pastry was dry. I'm never going back; which is just as well because the food isn't that great. I'd be wonderful at half the price. But it's not, so it's just not worth it.  When options of places to eat in the neighborhood come up I'll veto SG straight away, and proceed to retell these stories to my friends. Hey Southport Grocery owners; if you read this, why don't you take the time to encourage your staff to be friendly, helpful, and actually perform their job tasks? Or do you not care as long as you keep getting people to pay for your $15 omelets? Ugh. Why couldn't you go out of business instead of Winston's?",0.968,0.772,0.139,0.088,0.546969696969697

It's basically a french toast, ham and cheese combo...Who thought of this? Amazing.  I took a risk and tried The Cupcake Pancakes another morning, and they were good, but sooooo rich and sweet I could only have a few bites. It really is like eating a cupcake with syrup on it. But I'm glad I tried it. It's interesting, like most of their menu.  When I go there for lunch, I usually get the chop salad. Yes, it's just a salad, but a very good one. I recommend it.

They only sell vanilla/vaniila and chocolate/vanilla...and thats fine with me. The buttercream is PERFECT and the cake is moist and tasty. I would come here just for the cupcake. However....today I met some lovely ladies for lunch at Southport (this was not a cupcake only trip). We were 4 ladies with 3 babies and Southport accommodated us with a smile. We had a nice large table big enough for a couple strollers and a few highchairs.  I noticed a few people have complained about the service or the wait for food. We did not experience any of that. Our server was fast and always around to refill out coffee (which was fabulous) or water.  The menu is definitely drool worthy (umm...hello....stuffed french toast, bread pudding pancakes...etc etc). Knowing that I was going to get some cupcakes later on I decided on the savory end of the menu and ordered up a chorizo omelet with spinach and goat cheese. It was definetly tasty (but REALLY greasy - which I guess you get when you order something with chorizo). My fellow diners ordered up the hash (yum) and some salads.

The cupcake was just a side-effect. The service was delightful, friendly, full of suggestions and totally in disbelief of the fact that I'm from LA... random. Brett D. loved her tea and my latte was perfect. We decided to split a cupcake since Southport is constantly put up against our beloved Sweet Mandy B's by you Chicago folks and settled on vanilla (strike one in the overall battle royale when you only offer 2 flavors - vanilla and chocolate). The cake was light and moist but I found the frosting to be a little too sugary.  The market itself was super cute with tons of fun gourmet things I wish I had had the time to try and their cafe menu looked to be full of scrumptious things for brunch and beyond.

People that can hold it together in crowds and be polite, pleasant, and not get the order wrong deserve many thanks in addition to great tips. The other cool thing is that many of the servers were male. You can make of that whatever you want, and its not a big thing, just a nice change. Open kitchens always make me feel better. So there's that. But the most brilliant thing is the Pancake Taste. Tasting portions on the breakfast menu. Because some people, if they eat pancakes for breakfast, will just crawl back in bed to sleep. Yet pancakes sound good. So one could get a sandwich or salad or whatever plus a 4 dollar pancake taste. I didn't do the pancake taste because a few of us ladies split the adult pop tart. It was good but the peanuts were too chunky and slipped off the fork. Plus the menu said there would be ""house roasted vanilla walnuts"" in there, not peanuts. Oh well. I got the beet salad, its great, but its always great when someone chops beets in a kitchen that isn't mine. Nice fresh goat cheese. My companions ate bruschetta, steak and eggs, stuffed french toast, and brie sandwich. There wasn't much food left on anyones' plate. They have clear hot sauce which is a novelty. Oh! I almost forgot about that $3 citrus (not just OJ) mimosa. In a fairly large glass, not a champagne glass.  The grocery store has some interesting items for gifts or for yourself.

First, the wait system is terrible.  Although in theory it sounds convenient to have the option of giving the hostess your phone number, so you can leave and have the hostess can call you when your table is ready, it leaves the other restaurant patrons with a false hope that the 45 minute estimated wait time will be much less.  In fact, as people continued to just pour in and immediately be seated, I became increasingly more impatient despite the fact that I clearly knew they were there before me.  I guess its just the principle of the thing - seems like the hard work of waiting out the weekend brunch crowd should be rewarded instead of having hoards of people breeze by you when their cell phone rings down the street.   Once we finally scored a table, we waited an exorbitant amount of time for our waiter to even approach us with menus.  30 minutes elapsed before we got a coffee, of which he plopped down without a spoon, forcing me to add the contents of my milk concoction with a knife (no chance of flagging him down!).  Nice attention to detail... But the ordering is what really pushed me over the edge....going out for brunch is usually do-able in some sort of healthy manner by making your own omelette, ordering fruit, etc.  However, the menu at Southport Grocery clearly reads that no custom omelettes will be made!  I was appalled.  When I tried to order the ""healthiest"" thing on the menu without the cream cheese, the waiter told me it was not possible.   Bottom line: if you are trying to go the healthy route for brunch, this is NOT the place for you based on their limited menu selection and refusal to customize their plates.  Definite thumbs down",0.9658,0.797,0.13,0.073,0.5681795634920634

They were ill prepared for the labor day holiday crowd.  The hostess was clearing tables, seating people and running around trying to keep her cool.  She was a little bit of a mess, not really knowing which tables were opening up, not sure who was there first, etc. but it was not a big deal. As we waited for our table I wandered over to the ""grocery"" are and looked at the offerings.  I cannot imagine that they sell much of this stuff.  I kept asking myself, ""i wonder if they've actually considered how much money they make per square foot with the grocery items vs. seating"".  There were many very high priced items in the ""grocery"" area that I cannot imagine many people buy and they have to spend money to stock these items.  But, I am not here to help them re-write their business plan so I purchased some freeze dried peaches and went to wait with my friends. When I looked at the menu, several things struck my eye as being ""good"" but I never order until I ge the professional's opinion, the server.  She came over and I asked which of the savory items were best?  She suggested the HASH so I took her opinion.  Bad choice.  I also ordered the bread pudding pancakes, just in case, and we shared them at the table.   My Hash was gross.  They use the cheap, frozen hashed browns that Denny's uses and they pile it into a bowl.  Under the hasbrowns were some soggy, super greasy red onions, mushrooms and red peppers.  On top was scrambled eggs with some sour cream.  I ate the eggs, picked at the hash browns and didn't even know I had veggies down there until I was full.   The bread pudding pancakes were SUPER YUMMY but very rich.  You only get 2, which is more than enough unless you want to go into a sugar coma.   Overall, I would say - ambiance is super cute, I'd give it 4 stars for the ambiance.  I liked the concept too, even though I don't know if it makes sense, it is a cute concept.  My Hash gets 1 star and my pancakes get 3.5 stars.",0.9954,0.788,0.164,0.049,0.47742176870748304
2008-09-01,3.0,"Southport Grocery combines several of the key ingredients that I love: a little bit of pretension, close proximity to several bars, outdoor seating, solid breakfast fare and cupcakes. But it also includes something that I hate: children. Or maybe not so much children, but irresponsible, entitled parents. This place is brimming with them! But unfortunately I can't review them... Yesterday we stopped by SG for brunch around 11:30. We actually only had to wait about 15 minutes for an outdoor table (yay!) and were seated right next to the sidewalk. Our deliciously awkward hipster waiter was nice, albeit a little slow. But that's okay--it was brunch on a Sunday, we were in no hurry. To start, we ordered the fruit plate, drenched in a delicious lemony vanilla light syrup. The fruit was good and the syrup was just icing on the proverbial fruit cake. For my entree I had the grown-up pop tart. It was really good, though a little too crusty for me. The mascarpone was a nice balance and the glazed walnuts were wonderful! My friend had the bread pudding pancakes with that delicious vanilla sauce. The pancakes are meh, but that sauce is amazing! Honestly, based solely on the food I would give this place five stars. But minus one for their wait-list system that allows people to wander off down Southport, get a phone call when their table is ready, and wander back while the rest of us stand there waiting for them to get back. All the while, a precious table upon which I could be served delicious brunch remains empty.  The other hit SG gets is for the chairs in their outdoor patio. They are shaped in such a way that you can really only lounge back to a point of nearly lying down, or sit on the edge of the chair in order to be able to reach the table. They are really quite awkward! Overall, I don't think this is a place where I would enjoy eating inside, but with an outdoor table and a little bit of patience, you can get some delicious, unique breakfast items.",0.9959,0.743,0.193,0.065,0.5773644179894178

Going into a popular brunch spot at 10 a.m. on a Sunday, I fully expect to wait for the privilege of a seat. I was not prepared, however, for the completely disorganized wait list ""system"" in place, and the rude bunch of jerks who also frequented this place. First, we went inside and attempted to put our name on the wait list. The person running the wait list told us to wait a minute, and that he'd be back. When he finally returned, he started taking the names of other people who arrived later than us, and basically flat out ignored our repeated requests to get on the list. When my husband nearly blew up, he finally complied. We spent the rest of our 45 minute wait watching people who arrived after us get seated first, and finally agreed to sit at the larger, community table because the food going by us looked great and we were starving. Once we sat down, it was a full 20 minutes until we could get a drink of water. Another 10 to get our drink order in. At this point, we normally would have gotten up and walked out of any other place, but we'd committed enough time to this endeavor that we stuck around. I finally ordered a bloody mary, which was actually good. It was the only good part of our trip there. I actually would have liked to have a second one, but we saw our waiter twice the whole time we were there so I couldn't get the order in. I ordered steak and eggs and my husband ordered french toast. It was another 55 minutes before our food arrived -- we were definitely clock-watching by this point. My steak and eggs was just totally one of the most disgusting, poorly mis-seasoned things I've ever put in my mouth. I wouldn't have fed the steak on the plate to my dog. My husband's french toast was good, but nothing at all special. It took us another 15 minute wait in line to pay the check so that we could get out of there, with the person working the register socializing with multiple people instead of allowing us to pay and just leave. Suffice it to say that added insult to injury at the end of the meal. Maybe we just went on an off day, but you couldn't pay me to return to this place.

By the time our food arrived, we were so hungry that anything would have tasted good.  But despite our appetites, we did not enjoy our food.  My hash was cold and greasy.  My husband's tater tots were rock hard.  My friend's artichoke omelet had no artichoke in it.

I believe it to be a secretive conspiracy that uses the red-light runner traffic cameras, zip codes and school information, metal filling dental info and other stuff, but I received a letter from DCFS when I was about 7 months pregnant informing me of the Cupcake Act of 2004 and mandating me to visit Southport at least four times a year (specifically once per season).

I've had pretty much everything here - even their $10 hot dog is really good! - but my favorites are the hamburger with sour cream and blue cheese, the hash, the cupcake pancakes (eat these - legally counts as two of your mandated visits!)   They also have amazing soups - best one ever had a wonderful chicken broth, greens and a ton of chicken, and I think about it still all the time.  Cons? I had a bacon blue cheese scone here once that, well...made me REALLY ready to be in babymaking mode, if you know what I mean, but they stopped making them and just never brought them back. Also, they have a lot of trouble with providing a reliable starchy side - the tater tots were always kind of stale and the mash they do now is often kind of cold and flavorless. My solution - do a kettle chip! It would solve all of your probs in that area and would be fricking awesome to use to scoop up eggs and whatnot.

I ordered the BLT, which was one of the best I have ever eaten.  Nice, crisp bacon.  Thick, buttery, eggy challah.  Mild and smooth mashed avocado.  Big, juicy tomatoes and lettuce.  Just the right amount of mayo.  And, the best part, the sweet, but not overpowering apricot compote.  Wowsa!  It was really, really nice.  I knew that I was headed in the right direction when the waiter, who had not been too excited with my friend's order of chicken salad, offered an ""EXCELLENT!"" when I ordered the BLT.  It was served with a nice broccoli salad with a light dressing and sunflower seeds and cashews.  Who doesn't like some cashews in their salad? I made my way to the register perusing the cool, but a little overpriced, ""groceries"".  I wasn't looking for a sugar injection, so I went with a small sugar cookie, and by-passed the cupcakes.  A travesty, I know.  Next time, I will get one, I promise.  I'd also like to try these bread pudding pancakes that everyone raves about.  I'll just have to make sure I hit the place up during the week again.",0.9847,0.818,0.151,0.031,0.5898489503328213

2007-10-19,5.0,"I LOVE this place. I'm a total sucker for their cupcakes, but all the other food I've had there has been fantastic, as well. It's a perfect brunch spot, and the first few times I went, I got breakfast (the hash, cupcake pancakes, sausage omelet, and grilled coffee cake--all delicious), so the last time I decided to try lunch and ordered a burger. It was one of the best I've ever had, no joke. It's a unique menu, but not outlandishly weird. In addition to the great cupcakes, they have a bunch of other bakery items, but I always forget to try them when the cupcakes are tempting me. The coffee's good, the restaurant itself is cute and chic, the patio's great in the summer, and I've always had good service. All in all, don't miss it. (P.S. It's currently a little harder to get to because the Brown Line Southport stop is closed, but my husband and I always take the Red Line to Addison and then walk the remaining 6 or so blocks. Not bad for summer, but could be a bummer in the winter. Also, it can be a long wait if you're going around brunch time, but in my opinion, it's totally worth it.

For lunch, I had the grilled brie sandwich, which was a bit disappointing.  My entire sandwich was dripping with oil.  The bread that was toasted was rather hard and actually benefited (and I don't think this was intentional) from the oil softening it up a little.     But because I liked the ambiance and experience otherwise, I would definitely try this place (and something different on their menu) again.",0.9884,0.776,0.165,0.058,0.5388888888888889

They even brought more tortillas for her eggs. The tea selection is fantastic, but most contain peppermint, so if that's a problem go with the basics. Their chicken sausage was a nice healthy alternative to the rgular junk they serve at buffets. At least it appeared to be healthier.

2007-08-27,2.0,"The wife and I decided to give this place a second chance before the Cubs game a few weekends ago. We decided on this place simply because we had a gift certificate and it is only a few blocks from Wrigley.  We had eaten here once prior, with the result being decidedly mediocre (I felt like starting a 'overrated' chant in the middle of the restaurant), but since this time would essentially be free, we were willing to give it another shot. As our fearless leader once said, ""Fool me once...(awkward pause)...shame on...shame on you. (Pause) If you fool me, you can't get fooled again."" Point being, this place wasn't good the second time either. Case in point, the only side dish offered with the meals is mashed potatoes.(What happened to the tater tots?) That's fine. I love mashed potatoes. BUT, we see our waiter tell the table next to us right before he brings their meal out that they are out of mashed potatoes (or as they're labeled on the menu, 'potato mash') and would they like to substitute? He then tells us that same thing right before our meal comes out and later we hear him tell another table right the same thing? Uh, why didn't you just tell us that when you took our order since you've obviously been out for a while now? And the replacement choices? Mixed greens or fruit. I ask him without sarcasm, ""Don't you have anything a bit more unhealthy?"" He thinks I'm kidding.  I'm not. Who wants mixed greens with a greasy omelet? And how do you run out of potatoes anyway? There is a Jewel-Osco right across the street. Go buy some bags of Idaho's finest. How hard is that? Furthermore (wagging my finger violently), this place is known for their cupcakes. It has been written about in many a trendy magazine how good these damn things are. And since I just ate a plate of friggin mixed greens I feel I owe it to myself to indulge in a cupcake. But guess what? They're all out. At 1PM on a Saturday. Unacceptable.

2007-04-03,5.0,"Not to nitpick as to other reviewers, but I will make two observations at the outset: 1) Good things come to those who wait (and you will often wait at Southport Grocery) and 2) During prime brunching hours, you have to wait everywhere.  Even IHOP.  That's just how the cupcake crumbles. Back to my objective commentary.  If I could marry a restaurant, it would be Southport Grocery.  One of the saddest parts of Chicago's long and frigid winter is that it deterred me from trekking the odd mile and or so in the cold to enjoy breakfast at Southport.   I love me some good breakfast.  I'm not a snob, either -- I like everything from Waffle House and McDonalds up the ladder to fancy-shmancy expensive brunch joints.  This place takes the (cup) cake.  The Sweet and Savory French Toast (with Gruyere and ham) is simple in concept and absolutely divine in execution.  Bread Pudding Pancakes are similarly unbelievable.  Their assortment of egg dishes are creative without being too experimental.  Even the homemade granola looks good, although I wouldn't know because I couldn't bring myself to pass up all the other wonderful options in favor of something so... healthy. Moving beyond my personal favorites, they have good coffee (Intelligentsia), a nice chai latte, good fresh-squeezed juices, excellent breakfast sides (thick-cut bacon, sausage, etc.) and reasonable prices on it all.  Practically every ingredient on the menu is broken down by its 'lineage'  and most of it comes from local sources.  Normally, I could care less about where my cheese or sausage came from, but in the case of Southport Grocery, it sort of adds to the fun of the experience.  Especially since you can go buy most of the ingredients in the wonderful little grocery section ... and, of course, the wonderful cupcakes and pastries.  They carry a nice little selection of wines and a variety of gourmet pastas, sauces, mixers, salsas, and so on.  One could drop a lot of dough in one trip. For my money Southport is the best brunch in Chicago and one of the best I've had anywhere.  (Much better than Bongo Room, Ann Sather, Nookies, Kitsch'n -- which are all places I like a lot.)  As to other meals, I'll have to disclose that I've really only had lunch/dinner there twice.  Last time I checked, they close way too early for me to eat dinner there most nights.  I had a very good burger on one occasion and a similarly satisfying salad on another.   Very minor complaints: Their tater tots suck, in my experience (how do you screw this up when every fratboy bar on the street nails tots?).   The service can be both spotty and a little confusing.  (You need to take your number up the register at the end and pay there.  Don't forget to leave the tip on the table -- in cash, because I do not believe they will let you do it on your plastic.)   There can be a wait during peak hours, although they have a nice patio setup in the summer which alleviates that to some degree.  They have one big table and can push some tables together but it really isn't geared toward big groups as it is a very small restaurant.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure they do catering too.    Sometimes there are lots of children running around.  This may be due to all the family-oriented boutiques along the Corridor (and also the family-oriented nature of the 'hood).   In short, I am Ga-Ga for the Grocery and you should be too.",0.999,0.756,0.203,0.041,0.539064454064454

All the food I've eaten here has been quite good.  The ingredients are always fresh and the food is inventive while remaining simple enough to please even picky eaters.  The cupcakes are really where it's at though.  They are sweet but not too sweet and covered in a good solid inch of delicious icing.  My roommate, boyfriend, and I have adopted these little delights as a sort of currency.....If you do this for me, I'll give you a cupcake...that sort of thing.

The rest of our food was just ok.   I had a friend go there for lunch and the veggie's on his veggie sandwich were rotten.   I don't know if the place is too busy for the owner to handle, but she needs to train her staff and oversee the kitchen better.  We haven't been back since we took our friends there in May.  Every other breakfast experience there has been good, so I hope the next time we go we're not disappointed again.",0.9849,0.794,0.177,0.029,0.44460784313725493

2006-04-18,2.0,"I have to edit my review after a painstakingly tiring experience here yesterday: the bf and I were jonesing for some food, so I suggested Southport Grocery, since he had never been. We just wanted to get in and out, so we ordered our food to go and paid upfront. Then we waited...and waited...and waited some more, for an entire half hour before we were told that our order never made it 'to the line.' The girl was apologetic, so we waived off the mistake and remained standing in the obscenely cramped space that they are calling a cafe. It's more like a walk-in closet, now that I think again of the space constraints. Meanwhile, I had to ask for a water because I was so parched, and he was itching to get out due to increasing claustrophobia. 10 minutes later, we were told that the food had indeed been made, but the girl who was helping us was new and didn't see it. We got a couple comp cupcakes (delish!) and two 15% off coupons for our next order, and we were on our merry way.    The food was still warm when we left, which was a good sign, but everything was OVERLY greasy. Our omelette's eggs were still runny like a river and had absolutely no taste. And the grilled turkey I had been obsessing over since my friend had ordered last time was missing the pesto that made it taste so good before! They also forgot the oj we had ordered. :(  I honestly doubt I'll be back, even to use the coupons, which is a bummer, because I loved this place the first time around.  Guess poor service can really bite you in the ass.   4/18/06: This place isn't really worth going for the groceries, unless you're a chef de cuisine and need something very particular and pricey.  However, the Cafe has some of the most delectable food I've had in a long time.  I went two weekends ago with a friend for brunch/lunch, and couldn't resist ordering the Stuffed French Toast, which was as yummy as it sounds.  Only good manners kept me from licking the plate clean.    My friend got the grilled turkey, and after trying a bite, I wished I had ordered that as well.  If only I had a bigger stomach!   It wasn't warm enough to enjoy the outdoor seating when we were there, but the Southport scenery (i.e., people-watching) is worth a trip when the temperature rises.",0.992,0.768,0.157,0.075,0.4501262626262626

Each lunch possibility comes with the option of a wine pairing to go with it. The service is a bit slow, but think of it as a subtle way of encouraging you to simply relax and enjoy your meal.
