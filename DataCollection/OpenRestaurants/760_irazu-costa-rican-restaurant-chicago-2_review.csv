2017-09-01,5.0,We catered our daughter's third birthday party from Irazu today... Moana (Hawaiian) theme party and Henry (the owner) and his chefs knocked out a special Chicken and Veggies with grilled pineapple and glaze to accommodate our special order! Henry literally went above and beyond and personally went out to buy pineapples to make the meal outstanding. The food was incredible and service was second to none. Cannot say enough about this guy and his operation. Thanks again Henry.,0.9516,0.798,0.202,0.0,0.4516233766233766

The empanadas were incredible-- it seemed as if they were gone as soon as the foil was lifted off the tray. The folks who staffed the event, Jiovanni and Alicia, far exceeded my expectations in every way. They were friendly, punctual, and energetic, and they even made numerous trips to the 7Eleven down the street for more ice without me needing to ask.

Service- Fantastic service! Our fold arrived promptly and our waiters were attentive to all our needs. Since the spot is BYOB they have a small fridge and nice glasses for drinks. Food- Their menu is amazing. I went for the chicken casado and it was absolutely delicious- a combination of many flavors, generously portioned. Also we did a Yelp check in and all got free oatmeal shakes which were so so good- I am lactose intolerant and it was great that they gave you the option of getting soymilk or water.

Granted we were with a group of 9 and it was a Saturday night at 8 but still it took 2 hours and us bugging the guy we checked in with to get seated finally. Cash only (ATM inside) and BYOB.  Also another place great to do family style type of meal sharing dishes so you can maximize your time and try as many things as possible. I can't recall every dish we ordered because it was so much and so many people. But plentyyyy of food! You will not leave hungry.

2017-08-08,1.0,"I have eaten at this restaurant at least 10 times and have never had such an unfortunate experience as I did today. The food has always been great , but the service has always been mediocre at best. My problem with Irazu in the past has been that no matter how seemingly slow or busy  the restaurant appears, service is always slow. By slow service I mean you might find yourself waiting for the server for 20 minutes to bring your check. However, today's experience  left me thinking I'll never be back, because no food tastes good enough for me to desire to face demeaning comments just to pay for my order. I ordered for pick up about 15-20 minutes prior to my arrival at the restaurant. When I got there, I waited a few minutes as it was not ready yet. I thought this was completely understandable because they are extremely busy around lunchtime. However, what is not understandable is as I started walking away after I got my order, the man who took  my payment and handed me my food stated ""enjoy your yoga class sweetie."" Judging by the fact that I was not carrying a yoga mat nor did I mention I was going to yoga, his comment was simply racist. He made this statement based on the fact that I was caucasian and was wearing leggings. I'm not sure who this person was, but this comment was simply unnecessary and rude. I can also attest to the fact that I was nothing short of polite and cordial to this man. I'm sad to say that this experience changed my view of Irazu.

The food was delicious - two meat dishes, rice and beans, veggies, super tasty guacamole with chips, plus oatmeal shake shots for dessert. Our guests raved about the food and had a wonderful time. We had just under 60 people for our rehearsal dinner, and I wasn't sure where we'd find a place that would accommodate our large party without busting the budget. Irazu had the most reasonable prices around, plus they let us BYOB which helped too. They also let us bring in a cake for our flower girl who was having her birthday that night, and our party attendant Alicia (who was awesome and took care of anything and everything so quickly) cut and served it for our guests. Irazu made the whole dinner stress free which was just what we needed the night before our wedding.

We didn't have to wait long for a Saturday night-- maybe about 20 minutes or so. Long enough to go and pick up some alcohol and make it back, so no problem there. The interior of the place is SO GREAT. all of the windows open up and the place is just super airy and it's like you're outside but you're not. There's a clear view into the kitchen from the end that we were sitting on, which was also pretty cool.  We weren't waited on very quickly, but it's understandable because the place was packed. Our waitress was fine-- nice enough and quick enough. It's the food that was really the demise! We all ordered and were just SO EXCITED for what we ordered and EVERYONE thought their food was a little lackluster.... for how great the ingredients sounded, the flavor just wasn't there. Two burritos, steak, chicken, and the big pepper was ordered. I'd say the pepper stuffed with cheese was probably the best.

2017-07-06,1.0,"I came here last year; the food was great as was the service. I came back to Chicago this week and wanted to eat here again. We called to get takeout. When the man answering the phone picked up, his tone was immediately rude & short. It was incredibly noisy in the background to the point where he couldn't hear me & I couldn't hear him. Mind you, it is 3pm on a Wed afternoon, so the restaurant isn't busy, swarming w/ rowdy patrons. They just have the music blaring for no reason. The guy seems frustrated he can't hear me, although I'm practically screaming, and hangs up. I call back again; he still seems mad and screams ""hello"" repeatedly and I do it in return. I try to place my order and ask him to change one of the dishes, which is how I got it last time so I figured it wouldn't be a problem. He acts like he doesn't understand what I am saying and we go back & forth. Then, he tells me that he will do it, but I am making his life difficult! I reply back that this has been very frustrating as it has proven difficult to get my order thru, but I am fan of the restaurant and would like to give them my money. When I asks if he wants my business or not, he says ""I'm not going to get into that now."" Well, sounds like you already started, so please finish...  1. Why have the music so loud for no reason? or why have the phone by the loud music so you can't even take orders from customers? (BTW, when we drove by the place, there are maybe 5 people inside, some of whom may have been staff. There weren't busy at all & probably could've have used some customers like my friend and me.) 2. If you are going to have music blasting in an empty restaurant, why would you get mad at people and hang up on them because of your bad set up? YOU can do something about it.  3. If you don't make substitutions, just put that on the menu. Don't berate a good potential customer for asking for something they've had before! 4. If changing an order is making your life difficult, then clearly you are not in the right place. We were so put off by their phone manner that we ended up going to Small Cheval down the street. My advice: spend your money elsewhere. It's not that good that it's worth being disrespected.

The Lizano sauce puts the sandwich to a whole different level and I'm not sure how they managed to put so many flavors into one sandwich! My friend got the Costa Rican sandwich and it tasted almost exactly like a Cuban sandwich.  For dessert we had the oatmeal shake and bread pudding. The bread pudding had way too much cinnamon on top where we felt like we were doing a mini cinnamon challenge.

I even checked in and got an oatmeal smoothie which isn't something I normally would have gotten, but it was delicious and it went well with the meal.

After I read some great reviews I was anxious to witness this place myself. Well this evening I got a chance and it was amazing. It was a bit busy but the wait was well worth it. Me & My Bestie made plans after a wine event to come dine here. The menu had so many selections to chose from and it was hard to decide. We both just ordered chicken burritos with a side of yellow rice. P.S The waiter brings you a basket of nachos chips with the green salsa. It took the waiter awhile to come to our table so that we can place our order. But when he finally made it over to us. He politely apologize and stated that he would bring us out a piece of Rum Cake on him. So Sweet The music is very relaxing and the food is so yummy. Everytime the waiter came by with a plate. We kept turning around because every plate that came out looked amazing and yummy. Just a few FYI's.... 1. Pls make sure you bring Cash for your meal. They don't accept debit or credit cards 2. It's BYOB... Yessssss. You can bring any beverage that you may like with your meal. Also, make sure to check-in and get your Free Oatmeal Shake. Which is also a delicious treat.

2017-05-30,4.0,"Went here for a group dinner. When checking out the previous yelp review, I was excited to go here. The best part about this place: BYOB. Honestly in Chicago and in a cool neighborhood like Wicker Park, that's a rare find. Also, a major plus: if you check in on yelp you get their famous Oatmeal Shake on the house (only 1/table). I'll warn you that even though it's called an oatmeal shake this is NOT healthy. I'm fairly certain they used ice cream to make this, it tasted like it was loaded up. This is not the ""overnight oats"" concoction you may have been expecting. As far as the food, I ordered the Pepito Sandwich w/ chicken. It was great. I think next time I will try one of their platters, just to get more food. I'm cutting out on bread so I just ate the meat and it really wasn't enough to fill up on. They also have this super-spicy green sauce they bring out upon request. I love spicy stuff so it was good, but its SOOO spicy so beware. The ambiance is fun, lots of bright colors and fun tropical type of atmosphere. Our waiter was nice, especially since we had a big group. Heads up: CASH PAY ONLY! Don't be surprised by this, show up prepared. They also didn't split our check between our group so we all just paid $20. Another great thing is they have un-metered street parking in the neighborhood about 2-3 blocks away. Also a score since I didn't have to uber here (saving that $10 round trip yo). Overall, I would come back here again. The free parking, BYOB, and yelp check-in specials make it a winner.",0.9928,0.781,0.179,0.039,0.5910884353741496

2017-05-24,4.0,"What a fun BYOB atmosphere. I absolutely love Spanish-culture and loved that this Costa Rican restaurant was different than the typical mexican cuisine that is offered everywhere else. We came in right at 5 pm on a Saturday, and it was pretty busy already! The chips were delicious, and the fresh fruit shakes are an amazing concept. We had brought a tequila bottle so we mixed that with a pitcher of mango and pineapple fruit shake. Best drink ever. My friend and I split the small Chifrijo for an appetizer. Fresh, flavorful, and hearty- who even knew there was such a combination? The fried pork shanks are tasty- probably all fat, but that's what made it so delicious! Our friends were all eyeing our plate and trying to take some pieces to eat with their chips. I got the palmito salad with shrimp as my entree, and I'm glad I didn't get a heartier dish. This and the appetizer was more than enough to leave me with a very very full belly. The shrimp was excellent, and the salad was great. I also tried the empanadas, though we couldn't tell which was which, and they were all delicious. The quesadillas were great too, though the cheese wasn't quite melted thoroughly. To finish off the amazing and filling dinner, we had a bread pudding slice- complements of the restaurant for a birthday- and the oatmeal shake. The bread pudding (or maybe it was flan?) was scrumptious, warm, and melt-in-your-mouth tasty. The oatmeal shake was like a very sweet horchata-like milkshake. So basically, even though we were overwhelmingly full, we couldn't resist on the desserts that this awesome place had to offer.  Service was to the point and accommodating. Not the quickest, but got the job done. Thanks for a fun time Irazu!!",0.9982,0.714,0.262,0.024,0.618051948051948

For the breakfast options the Huevos con Chorizo are a staple. The combination is superb and their chorizo is not overly seasoned like many places. Both the ceviche and shrimp avocado appetizers are both light and fresh options to start a full meal. I especially love the lime kick of the ceviche. These portions serve a table of 3-4 well. When it comes to main dishes a combination of empanadas and a sandwich is a sure bet. Beef/potato and spinach/cheese are a couple of the go-to options for empanadas, but I've never been disappointed in any of them. My favorite sandwich is the Milanessa. The steak comes out crispy but the meat itself is not dried out. The highlight might be the smoky Lizano sauce. The traditional side of fried plantains will tie it all together.

For those that wish to hear all the details, read on.  My then fiancé and I always loved Irazu and we've been going there for years. We were in heavy duty wedding planning mode and decided to pick up burritos at Irazu.  We noticed their sign that said venue space.  We looked at the two spaces: one that accommodates smaller parties and one for larger parties.  We looked at the space, loved it and put down the deposit (just a small amount compared to other venue space). Everything we wanted was at Irazu: delicious food, great prices, BYOB and something low maintenance.  The food package was perfect and delicious. It was great because my final count wasn't due until just 2 or so days before the event.  This was helpful because it allowed for last minute changes.  We had enough food for everyone.  The food was delicious, authentic and a big wow! We loved that it was BYOB, particularly because we were going all out with full bar for our 7 hour wedding the next day.  We also added one of Irazu's greats mixers to make fantastic drinks.  Oh and there was no corkage fee!  Irazu has two spaces.  The bigger space is what worked for me better since I had about 75 people.  The space was a dance studio across the street.  I liked it because it was a big space and just simple.  The colorful dishes from Irazu was the perfect touch to make the space come alive.   The other space is smaller and more festively decorated.   It was so great to work with Henry.  From the very beginning, he showered us with genuine care.  That's what made us make our mind up so quickly (and that Irazu is one of our favorite restaurants).  He answered my questions back quickly and was accommodating to my needs.   My entire family/friends were raving about how amazing the rehearsal dinner was.  This includes people that never even had Costa Rican food before.  When we talk about our wedding, now over a year later, people still bring up Irazu!  And our friends that live in Chicago go there all the time now.  The funny thing is that we booked our rehearsal dinner before we figured out where we were going for our honeymoon.  We ended up going to Costa Rica- so it was even more perfect that part of our wedding celebration took place at Irazu.

I've never had anyone walk away with a review less than stellar. Lines out the door and around the corner on weekends so be prepared. This place is no secret spot and seating is fairly limited.

2017-01-24,5.0,"I used Irazu for my birthday dinner at the beginning of January. The entire process from beginning to end was pretty seamless. I contacted Henry and he sent over the details- booking a party room includes a 3 course prix-fixe dinner and requires a deposit beforehand. You also have a private room that comes with your own personal server/bartender for the evening.  I paid the deposit in late December and I just had to verify the final amount of attendees 24 hours ahead of time. I loved having a set price for the meal (included tax + menu + space, not gratuity) because I could tell my friends what the price would be beforehand. Everyone hates at the end of dinner having to figure out who had what and what each person owed. Also, it was BYOB with no corkage fee (Irazu also provided the mixers (juice, soda, and ice).  Jio was our server and extremely attentive. I showed up about 15 minutes ahead of time and he was already at the venue getting things set up. Once people came in we started with chips + Guac, and eventually after a round or so of drinks, everyone served their own food buffet style. I was really worried that we would run out of food, but we had plenty to go around and even could take some home. The chicken + veggies were delicious and the oatmeal shake shot was a hit.

Booking was easy, with great communication before our event.  On the night of our dinner, the restaurant got very busy but service was great.  We never felt rushed and always had what we needed.   The price was reasonable and having the BYOB option really helped keep things on budget.  I also really loved that they could easily accommodate the various dietary needs of everyone in the group.  We had vegetarians, vegans, gluten free folks, folks with allergies and folks who can eat anything.  All were happy and I got to enjoy my guests without any stress - 5 stars!",0.9944,0.743,0.243,0.014,0.6800550964187329

The first upsetting piece of information was the fact that it was a cash only joint.  Should I have know beforehand?  Sure, but I didn't check because we're in the 21st century and any restaurant that brings in substantial business should accept credit cards.  I could care less about how ""cash is king"", especially when we're in as big of a city as Chicago.  I won't even get into to discussing the plight I had in finding an ATM so as to get money to finance this little (mis)adventure. Despite being a little heated (literally and physically from all thst running around) after my search for the ATM, I wanted to give Irazu the benefit of the doubt, but this was becoming increasingly more difficult with every second there. Since we didn't want to eat outside we were walked in through the kitchen to the dining room in the back of the restaurant.  I can forgive bad layouts (sometimes) but this was ridiculous - having to walk through the kitchen was just stupid.  There's no other word...it was stupid.   Before I get to the food, there's some other factors that make this restaurant less than par.  The service was awful and it lacked any ounce of professionalism.  Our waiter was slow as molasses, chose to employ selective listening when taking our order and apparently thought it was decent and okay to slap his co-worker's ass while making crude jokes right in front of the customers.  It wasn't just that our waiter was rude and unclassy, but that he was inattentive.  All things combined, I'm even surprised we received our food at all. Speaking food, I ended up getting the Guy Fieri special which included the pepito sandwich, small chifrijo and small oatmeal shake.  This special equated to $17 which was a little less than if you had ordered them separately.  I also got a side order of fried plantains (which the waiter had forgotten, or should I say neglected).  The fried plantains were actually my favorite part of the meal, oddly enough.  It's not to say that the other food wasn't good, but it wasn't the best Costa Rican food I've had.   The famed chifrijo was undoubtedly flavorful, but it's not something I would to write home about.  The Pico de Gallo and avocado in this appetizer were great, and all the pork had fantastic flavor it was hard to chew.  I felt like I needed to go to the dentist after eating the pork just to ensure my teeth weren't broken.  Thankfully I had the oatmeal horchata shake, but even that wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It was very unique and good, but too grainy for my taste; it didn't quench my thirst - in fact, it made my thirst worse.  Lastly, the pepito sandwich: juicy at parts, and gamey at others.  Again, the flavor of the sandwich was on point, but it wasn't nearly as good as it should have been.   Ultimately the cost of our meal was satisfactory, but I would have been much happier if everything had been satisfactory.  I'm just going to stick to my Costa Rican favorites here in the burbs.  I love Costa Rican food so again I'm sad that this didn't work out the way I'd have wanted it to.",0.9779,0.745,0.143,0.112,0.5422591867797348

I'd been wanting to try this restaurant for months, so when a work event led me to Chicago, I had to make a stop. I felt uneasy as soon as the server placed chips and spicy green salsa on the table. Costa Rican cuisine is never spicy! The server noticed my skepticism after trying the salsa and reassured me that the staff at Irazu realized that this was inauthentic. Apparently, the restaurant's owner tells the waitstaff not to serve the hot salsa to Costa Rican patrons. However, apparently, non-Costa Rican patrons repeatedly requested chips and salsa, so there it was. People must confuse this place with a Mexican restaurant--many fellow Yelpers on here have. Guess what, people? Not all countries in Central America are just like Mexico! Believe it or not, there are cultural differences within the region, even when it comes to food! It bugs me that Irazu caved to narrow-minded expectations, but I didn't let that ruin my experience. Okay, stepping off the soap box! Now for the positives... Craving real Costa Rican food--and lots of it--my date and I ordered several appetizers, entrees, and fancy non-alcoholic drinks. The empanadas and yucca fries were delicious! I loved the spinach and cheese empanadas. I do wish that the yucca fries had come with ketchup (that's how they served them when I was in Costa Rica, usually with mayo too), but they were tasty with the garlic dip. I ordered the shrimp and vegetable entree with gallo pinto, and my date ordered the casado with fish. Both entrees were great--generously sauteed with Salsa Lizano, which is a staple of Costa Rican cooking. The caramelized sweet plantains were just like my host family used to make--delicious!! It tasted like I was back in Costa Rica and I really really enjoyed it!! To drink, my date had coffee with horchata and I tried the oatmeal shake--both were amazing!! My host families in Costa Rica used to serve me oatmeal-based drinks all the time, so turning that concept into a shake is really creative, not to mention delicious! It might sound weird but you've got to try it! Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Irazu. The food was great, the service was friendly, the patio was nice, and it really took me back to my days in beautiful Costa Rica.",0.9977,0.796,0.181,0.023,0.5080645161290323

They were accommodating and still saved our table because I had called in to tell them we wouldn't be on time. Great service to begin with!  They start off your meal with standard chips and salsa, which I always crave. We also ordered the large Yuca fries for the four of us to share. The portion was smaller than I was expecting, but because we had chips too, we just waited for our meal, and drank our avena shake. (By the way, it's sinful. Don't leave Irazu without ordering it.) I had the Chicken Sandwich and added avocado, which I've ordered here before and loved, but this time it was so incredibly salty. I had my boyfriend check to be sure it wasn't just me, but he confirmed it. I think it was probably just a small mishap because it certainly wasn't like that last time. However, it killed my tastebuds and I couldn't eat more than half.  My friends ordered the Pepito, the Milanesa, and the Steak Burrito. The Pepito is a staple and had no complaints; it had tons of meat and was cooked perfectly. The Milanesa was super delicious, but very messy. Because it's a tougher piece of meat, it was slipping and sliding all over the sandwich whenever you took a bite. My friend suggested maybe putting in a toothpick to hold it together: again, a simple fix. The last thing we ordered was the Steak Burrito, which was tasty, but we asked for (and paid for) sour cream, and yet we couldn't see it or taste it.  Overall, there were just one or two small critiques we had about everything we ate. The 3 star rating is mostly due to inconsistency.

The waiter was great about coming to our table frequently for drink and appetizer orders as remaining members of our party trickled in. We sat under a chalkboard with ""Irazu's top 10 places to visit in Costa Rica"" (picture attached). I thought this was cute. Other signs about the various appetizer options and about the restaurant being cash only (pay at the front) and BYOB (no corkage fee) also adorn the walls. Great ambiance with super chill music. Ok, enough about that, on to the food. My maracuya (passion fruit) shake was delicious. Friends had great things to say about the iced Costa Rican coffee with horchata. For an appetizer, get the chifrijo!! We filled up on that and chips/guac, so for my meal, I got three empanadas, and in order of tastiness they were: 1) chicken, 2) spinach and cheese, and 3) chorizo and potato. Chicken was by far the most flavorful. The empanadas come with a little thing of pico de gallo. Friends had leftovers of their enormous burritos. To sum it up, excellent place for a midday meal.

To eat, we had the patacones with garlic oil as a starter, steak casado, and the chicharron. Our server was great, and the food was quick and delicious. We definitely had another meal's worth of leftovers.

We weren't drinking this evening, but there is a fridge in the dining room where staff will store the rest of your six-packs to stay cold while you eat. They also offered pitchers of fruit-flavored mixers if you bring in your alcohol of choice, which I think we'll take advantage of next time.

The taste of the Lizano sauce takes me back to my visits of the tiny extremely beautiful central american country. The oatmeal shake is very good on occasion, but typically my choice to pair up with my sandwich is an icy cold maracuya (passion fruit) batido. I'm just surprised that they don't emphasize the superior coffee from Costa Rica which is my choice of preference every single morning.

It's more a pregame joint, all hail the BYOB, where you can have some real good appetizers. Bring your poison and order a large chifrijo and large guacamole and you can't go wrong.  I've cruised the entree list and it just lacks a bold flavor. The most popular sandwich, the Pepito, is pretty good but it lacks a fresh crunch. Go for it though before you hit either the Wicker or Logan strip since Irazu serves as a fine middle ground. Location is definitely something that makes it work. The restaurant itself is tiny but the fairly year round proof patio is a savior. I credit the staff for being pretty live and upbeat and will also note that I've never had a bad experience here. Maybe I just missed the memo that Costa Rican food isn't that flavorful or maybe I'm still harboring the cash only resentment. But for a few minutes when I have a chifrijo I mind less that is until the server asks for my entree order and I ask for the check. It's a cool spot though environmentally.

2016-05-01,3.0,"Cash only, love that it's BYOB, would be back for the oatmeal shake, empanadas were good, but main dishes were bland.  Ambiance: It felt very similar to that of 90 miles Cuban. Patio seating when you first walk in and indoor seating in the back. Latino music playing the background, loud enough where you can hear it and somewhat too loud that I couldn't hear what my friend was saying half the time.  Food:  HIGHLIGHTS:  Main dishes averaged about $15 a plate, apps $8 and dessert $5 App: Beef and potato, chorizo and potato and spinach and cheese empanada  Side: Yuca fries.  Dessert: Oatmeal shake DETAIL: BYOB no corkage fee. You get chips and green sauce to start. I thought the chips were fresh seeing as they had oil on them and looked like they were just fried. But after seeing them bring a big bucket of them to the front I am guessing they just reheated them in the deep fryer. We ordered empanadas to start and while they are nothing amazing, they were still pretty good and I personally like to try empanadas where ever they are offered. Each one is big enough to share and you have the option to get them in 3, 5, 7 or 9. As for the main dish I got the Casado and my friend got El Tico both with beef which are essentially the same dish. The only difference is that the Casado has a fried egg with no bell peppers and El Tico has bell peppers and no fried egg. The fried egg was too cooked for my liking, I was hoping it would be a runny sunny side up egg, but it was almost like a hard boiled sunny side up egg. Both dishes were both bland, no flavor, or anything. I had to add a little bit of green sauce to make it taste like anything.My friend got the yuca fries as a side and they were pretty good. Nice and crispy and came with an oil based garlic sauce. As for dessert I got the oatmeal shake and it was delicious. It was like a rice pudding, horchata milk shake. I would definitely be back to get it. Overall, I can't say I have a desire to go back and try their other dishes.  Service: It was quick and our server was super helpful. They were able to tell us the exact differences between certain dishes and knew which ones tailored to what you may be craving. We made a reservation for 6:15 on a Saturday night, but it wasn't needed, it wasn't too busy or crowded. However the weather was rainy and cold, so not sure if it effected it at all. Around 8pm it started to get crowded and busy so I'd recommend making a reservation if you plan on going around that time and if they allow it. Great for groups.

On top of that, they served ice water before asking what we wanted to drink. I would have asked for water without ice, but I didn't want to trouble them after they already served ice water.  One of my pet peeves in Chicago is when restaurants leave the indoor temperature of their restaurant uncomfortably cold. It was a very simple problem to fix by turning the heat lamps on. I didn't appreciate wearing my wool coat during the entire dinner and shivering the whole time. Needless to say, I don't plan to go back. If Irazu wants to appeal to people not native to Chicago (i.e. can't stand cold weather), they should keep their seating area at room temperature and not let the outside temperature have an effect. I'm sure they can afford to turn their heat lamps on.

We were seated quickly and the service was ok. The server came over rather quickly to take our orders and we started out with the ceviche - very good. As the server brought over our appetizer she asked if we were ready to order and we did although it felt a bit rushed even though the place wasn't packed. She never asked us if we wanted anything to drink? Didn't recommend the shakes or anything. I ordered the Casado with steak minus the fried egg and it was Ok. The cabbage salad that came with my meal was completely dry - no type of dressing and flavorless. My husband ordered the chicken mixed with rice which also came with the cabbage salad and he wasn't crazy about it either. The chicken had a funny smell - like cooked chicken that wasn't freshly prepared same day or even the day before. But he doesn't ever like to complain or comment for fear of what might be done behind the scenes to his food - so he just didn't eat it and left the restaurant hungry. The table behind us ordered the burritos and those looked pretty good. I should have gone with the steak sandwich as originally intended as I think it would have been better.

We started with the Nachiticos, which was experimental for me because I normally do not like radishes.  Now, I cannot tell you what they did to those radishes, but they were as tasty as everything else in that bowl and disappeared just as rapidly.  Later, when ordering the empanadas, the waiter suggested the spinach and cheese version, conveying with certainty that they were the best.  So, I ordered them.  Dead on.  They were incredible, as well as the chicken empanadas.  I would order both again.   I'll return for the vegetarian paella and, of course, that oatmeal shake.",0.5138,0.797,0.108,0.095,0.5922619047619049

2016-02-29,5.0,"Irazu Is a Costa Rican casual dining experience which is sure to satisfy anyone's tastes. Restaurant is very popular with the locals and tourists and the evening and weekend crowds keep this place hoppin. They are a cash only establishment with a conveniently placed atm on the side. Fare is competitively priced, delicious and affordable. Modern and contemporary Latin music along with top English hits plays in the background. They have indoor and outdoor seating decorated in colorful paints with traditional artwork hanging all over the walls. Their outdoor patio is covered during the winter months and have heat lamps to keep you warm and toasty from the drafts which is nice. The covered patio extension is much needed as the interior resto is rather small and could accommodate at max 20 people.  How's the food? To sum it all up in one word...""Amazing."" Usually when I go to a restaurant and try a dish that turns out to be a winner, 95% of the time I stick with the dish and never try anything else for fear of disappointment. And the dishes I found to be top notch were the Casados which is a plate of marinated steak chopped thin and grilled laid on top of a bed of seasoned yellow rice (I like to order the upgrade and get mine spicy) topped with a runny fried egg, and a side of beets and a salad. Both my husband and I enjoy this dish very much and we order them with the Patacones (Tostones) app with ground black beans with garlic and oil sauce. One bite and OMG, the combination of these dishes were so tasty and addicting!!! I'm already looking forward to a future trip there! The oatmeal flavored shakes are worth a try too. They taste very similar to your standard horchata.  Side Tip: The summer months get pretty busy here and the wait times can challenge the most patient of people.

It is important to note that Irazu is BYOB and cash only, so be sure to have some cash on hand but there is an ATM if you forget cash. I loved the authentic ambiance and especially the restaurant's top 10 sights to see in Costa Rica.  I can't recommend the Oatmeal Shake highly enough - our waiter told us that it is not made with ice cream so it's much more liquidy - and you have the choice of soy and regular milk as the base. The shake costs $4 but you can add two flavors for $5. This made it a much more unique ""milkshake"" of sorts, and the cinnamon dashed on top of the oatmeal (I went for the single classic flavor, oatmeal) makes it so delicious. I wish I could have ordered another one! As well, if you take a picture of yourself with a wooden cutout at the entrance and post it to your choice of social media you get half off your shake, making it a great deal!  I ordered a burrito because I always love starting off at a new Latin American restaurant with this, my favorite dish. It provides a great benchmark for comparison, and Irazu does not dissapoint. For $7 you get your choice of meat and I added avocado for only $0.50 (a literal bargain compared to the likes of Chipotle and other restaurants).

When we arrived at the party room, we were greeted by a sign with our names on it and a small, waiting area filled with wooden chairs. As we walked through the doorway, we saw that the room was set up like a tiny restaurant filled with wooden tables and benches. There was colorful artwork on the walls and the food smelled incredible as always. I found it all very comforting and homey. Our party host, Jovani set up our event with help from some of Irazu's staff. Our guests found him both pleasant and professional. He helped us set up our music, put out all of the food, presented the menu to our guests, cut our cake, and served wine. He was the quintessential party host and I really couldn't have asked for much more. Our guests had a great time, loved the food, and the privacy.     I started planning this party a month prior to the event and finalized the details of our menu with Henry two days before the party. I found him helpful every step of the way. He gave us several options when it came to our menu, but we added in a few extra items. We also had a separate menu for the children. The food was served family-style and there was so much of it left over that our guests were able to take home extra. I also found the per person cost more than fair.  There were times when our host would have to run to Irazu's or call for extra supplies. To combat this, Irazu should stock the entire party room with extra plates, napkins, utensils, glasses, straws, take-out boxes, etc. This way, the host can focus strictly on taking care of the party and the guests.

2015-09-01,4.0,"Irazu became known to me through its gradually increasing recognition as makers of one of the best burritos in America, but I daresay that's the least worthy of the list of things they could be so awarded. First off, Irazu started as a no-reservations joint in a small space, making it ill-conducive for planning ahead parties. They moved locations and started taking reservations, and that's when I visited. Good choices, both. The BYOB policy makes the end of night bill mind-bogglingly wallet-friendly, even if you (as you should) order a fruit shake pitcher to go along with your spirit of choice (generally tequila or rum, if you're still confused). On the shakes, the oatmeal shake is also something that rightfully gets lots of love as well. On the menu, Irazu's chifrijo is tasty and delicious, and can somehow be made vegetarian and still taste pretty good. Of course, yucca chips should be mandatory, and Irazu's delicious mojo (roasted garlic) sauce should be outlawed for being so good. Irazu's burrito includes half of the ""rice + beans"" equation prevalent in Latin American cuisine, and it is good. I liked it better than other Chicago area luminaries like La Pasadita or L'Patron, but they're still not as good as the San Francisco counterparts. In retrospect, I wish I had ordered the signature casado platter instead. A simple dinner, with sweet plantains. Alas.",0.9969,0.698,0.267,0.035,0.6032857142857143

This restaurant is a perfect fit for the neighborhood serving Latin American food including their famous oatmeal shake. The layout is mainly a large open patio with the kitchen inside the building. This is probably wonderful on a nice evening, but may be a bit intense when the weather is less than perfect. Irazu is BYOB and cash only, so hit the ATM and wine cellar before heading over. We started with chips and a side of pico. The house sauce was very nice, but having the pico de gallo was a great alternative. I ordered the Steak El Tico which was a large platter of grilled steak with rice, beans, and plantains. The flavors were very wonderful and explosive which was refreshing after eating boring food for several days. Dessert was forsaken due to my nearly falling asleep into the plate. I would absolutely come back here, even with some of the challenges. My friend knew the staff, but they seemed good and helpful.

Make sure to bring cash but if you forget like we did, don't fret because they have an ATM on site.  We took the CTA blue line here from downtown and from the Western stop it was only a 5 minute walk. Once we sat down and were brought freshly made chips and a green salsa, it took us right back to all the places we love eating at in Mexico. I know it's a Costa Rican restaurant but it truly has an authentic feel is what I'm getting at.  I was extremely impressed with how many vegetarian choices they have. We ordered fried yucca with garlic mojo to share as an appetizer and to say I was obsessed with it was an understatement. If you've never had yucca it's a lot like a potato but with a more unique taste. The garlic mojo was the perfect companion as was the green salsa they already had for us on the table.  If you come here solely to try what you saw on the show, they have the Guy Fieri special for just that and it's $17. It comes with the pepito sandwich, a small chifrijo, and a 16oz oatmeal shake. For the shake you can choose any milk you want such as soy, regular, vanilla, or even chocolate and they dust the top with cinnamon before serving.  My husband went for it feeling adventurous. They first brought out the shake and the small chifrijo which is fried pork, rice, black beans, fresh pico, avocado, and a traditional Costa Rican sauce. Both were perfection and by the time his sandwich and my vegetarian plate came out, we were already pretty full.  The veggie plate comes with their vegetable of the day (it was spinach and peppers that day), yellow rice, beans, sweet plantains, and a cabbage salad. I couldn't eat more than a few bites of each item, but we loved it all.  My husband fought through being stuffed for the pepito sandwich because he said it was too good to go to waste. It had rib eye steak, cheese, beans, sautéed onions, Costa Rican sauce, and bread that is delivered fresh to them each morning. He added peppers to it for an additional $0.50.

We started with some empanadas: steak, chicken, chorizo and mushroom.  My favorites were the mushroom and chorizo.  A good ratio of filings that were tasty and seasoned well.  This and the BYOB gets Irazu the three stars in my book. For the entrees, we both got the popular and recommended Casado with ribeye steak upgraded with the pinto gallo.  It was okay. My biggest issue was that the meat was chewy and not seasoned enough. (I also wouldn't have marketed it as a rib eye steak.)  My husband ordered it spicy but found that it was not spicy at all.  The plantains were tasty and were my favorite part of the dish.  The gallo pinto (rice and beans) were good but I'm not exactly sure how this was a $1 upgrade.  Service was average. Our waiter was friendly but inattentive.  We had to ask someone else for the check.  I wanted to love it, but didn't. With so many other options in the area, I'm not itching to go back.",0.98,0.854,0.135,0.01,0.5074444444444445

Guac was obviously made in bulk at least the day before.  It had that brown color that happens when you let avocados oxidize for a while.  $7 for a small amount, I'd prefer it to be made at least same day or fresh.   The food itself was OK, but not good enough in my opinion for what we paid or to go back.",0.2022,0.872,0.067,0.061,0.4029532967032967

2015-07-27,3.0,"I am a frequent diner at Irazu as well as ordering delivery from them often. I felt it was necessary to write this review after my last couple of experiences. I find the front of house staff to be very rude each and every time that I dine there. They are rude on the phone too. A few weeks ago I had a reservation through open table and I needed to adjust it.  I called them because the open table app couldn't make the adjustment that I was needing. I thought the restaurant may be able to help and that it was at least worth asking. If they said they couldn't help I would have just canceled (no big deal). I called and one of the rudest men answered and immediately told me that they can't help me since I booked through open table and that I needed to call open table. I have never had that happen. It was a simple question. Not to mention one that I tried to work out with open table first. The restaurant knows If they have the space to add a person.  I called open table and explained and even they were confused as to why I was told to call them. I called Irazu back and they still wouldn't help me so I canceled. This last time the man working as the host (pretty sure it was the same guy) was very unpleasant. I asked about sitting outside and he told me that ""just because you have a reservation doesn't mean you can sit outside"". I was just asking if it was possible. A simple, ""I'm sorry we don't have the space"" would have been fine. He then sat us and just pointed at a section of the restaurant. I asked ""which one?"".  He replied ""the one with the water"".  Very short and rude. I understand that it's busy but a smile goes a long way. And to top it off. I received an email from open table a couple of days later asking why I hadn't gone to Irazu for my reservation. The restaurant marked us as no shows. I definitely do not no show on reservations. I was there. Open table solved that problem with the restaurant but it still bothered me after my experience. That's the last straw for me I think. Delivery only from now on. What used to be a favorite BYOB, fun and delicious spot has now become pretty unpleasant. The service was fine (no frills but ok) once we sat down and the food was delicious as always.  The servers are generally helpful and great about BYOB things. The atmosphere and food are consistent as well.

2015-07-25,4.0,"Wrote an incorrect review here last week so here is the correct one.  The food here was surprisingly delicious! I never had Costa Rican food before so I didn't know what to expect. My BF lived in CR for a bit so he wanted to show me their cuisine.  The stars are really for the amazing food and our server Maria- because she was awesome. However, one thing is, if you're a cash only restaurant you should always make sure your ATM is working. I had to walk several blocks (a good 20 there and back) to find an ATM... Which is why I took off the star. But other than that everything else was really cool. The decor was also interesting. We had the ceviche which is always good! Lots of protein and flavor! Fresh and zesty~ Also had their Casado which is a traditional meal and it was amazing! We got it with steak and asked for yellow rice instead and it was really good.  Would definitely recommend this place and hopefully they will work on having a working ATM next time I come. :)",0.9928,0.76,0.231,0.009,0.5468434343434343

You HAVE to scroll to the end if you wanna skip the rest.  I made a reservation through Open Table (Yelp says they don't do reservations.)  It's the kind of spot that will make you wait until the whole party is there before seating you... And the staff really isn't very friendly. Because we had a questionable number of people for our table (3 with a potential 4th) we slow-rolled our order.  The chifrijo was really good! Beautiful presentation, but very skimpy on the amount of meat/chicharron and avocado that's in it. A great started to share. 30 minutes after our appetizer, we order our entree.  After 45 minutes, we still didn't get our order! the waiter was not apologetic, and seemed angry when we inquired. We got a, ""Duh! I'm already working on it!"" We ordered a ceviche (You don't even cook that! it's marinated!), a shrimp and avocado salad (6 shrimps, which was 10% of the entire plate. cheap and deceiving! $12 plate over red onions and cabbage.. pff.), and the Pepito Sandwich.   We expressed our concern over a 45 minute wait on 2 appetizers and a sandwich.  The waiter said, ""I'm sorry, there's 4 tickets ahead of you."" Which felt sooo shady because tables seated an hour after us were fed, boxed, and out before we even got our entree. No apologies from the server. We did try the epic oatmeal shake.  Just think horchata with a thicker consistency. Anyhow.  The ambience was great, but the service was horrible.  The waiter was nonexistent.  We arrived at 7 and didn't leave until 9:30.  The food was seasoned and flavored well, but don't expect much protein. They'll nickel and dime you over a pretty presentation.  For a spot that's featured on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives, i expected more.  At least better hospitality.  I'll never come back with how rudely we were treated.

I had limited time in Chicago but knew Irazu had to be one of my stops- so I grabbed a steak Pepito sandwich to go en route to the airport and ate it during my flight! The staff were friendly about packing my order carefully and giving me an ample portion of the lizando sauce. High in the sky, my sandwich was tasty and packed with meat and grilled onions. The lizando was similar to a salsa verde, and added just the right bit of spice to the flavors. Minimal cheese and beans (didn't even notice any, really) kept the focus on the meat. At under $8, this packs a large portion for the price. The cash-only policy is not one I like, but several signs indicate that they are also BYOB with no corkage- which is pretty damn snazzy. I also like how they had signs posted discouraging people from laying around and hogging tables for extended periods of time.

Glad to see lizano(costarican condiment sauce) and glad the food was not spicy, they gave you the option if you wanted it hot nor not.  CHIFRIJO was great, rice, beans and pork Cooked to perfection. I am used to the chifrijo be a lil bit more soupy and with red beans, but everyone has a different version and this was a good one. CEVICHE was good, the fish was very well marinated, not sure about the tomatoes on top, but the fish it self was good. PEPITO SANDWICH my favorite by far.

We chose the outdoor seating area, and even with some sketchy weather in the area we were plenty warm and rain / drip free.  We shared a few dishes around the table.  Started off with the Chifrijo which was chewy and flavorful.  The girls decided to order a bunch of Empanadas and I chose the Casado. I think the girls had 6-7 different flavors...all fried perfectly with a myriad of different fillings: chorizo, chicken, beef, cheese, etc.  They said the flavors were delicious.  My Casado dish was actually way too big for one person, but had a multitude of different and exciting things to sample.  Rice and beans were a great base, and adding a bit of chicken to it was spot on.  Other vegetable were good, and the plantains were a perfect accompaniment.

If you get a pitcher, it's $10 as opposed to $4 a cup. I got the chifrijo and I really enjoyed this dish! I particularly liked it. The rice/beans were really moist. My friend had gotten the Casado with gallo pinto and tilapia. $1 for gallo pinto is a little steep, especially since it's essentially the same thing. I tried some of her dish and I was again, disappointed by the gallo pinto. She had noted it was very dry. It was. It shouldn't be that dry...hmm. The tilapia (which I also tried) was okay but not amazing. :/ They had forgotten to include the sweet plantains to her dish but the waiter promptly brought some. I got to taste these tasty maduros and they were yummy. The service was alright that day. It took a long long time for us to get our order in even though it was just us and one other person there (a bit ridiculous waiting 10+ minutes for service).

There is a pre fixe menu that includes the most popular items from Irazu's menu, and the owner Henry Cerdas was flexible in adjusting the menu to add more vegetarian options.

2015-04-14,2.0,"I regret to say that my experience at Irazu wasn't all that great.  Don't get me wrong -- nothing was bad about the food.  It was quite good.  My problem was with the poor service and many missed opportunities this place had to really shine, but didn't manifest. First, while I always try to support waitstaff, there comes a point where you just have to wonder sometimes HOW and WHY certain people are hired.  While our server was friendly, that just isn't enough.  IMO, a server does well by making suggestions, being informative, and most definitely, displaying enthusiasm about the food and specialties that make the establishment unique.  Our server, while friendly, didn't offer much to us in terms of suggestions or assistance with navigating the menu.  It was a bit sad, because it felt on par with a late night taco spot -- not a place that has garnered considerable media attention. When I asked what the vegetable of the day was, I was told one thing, but received something completely different.  And while it was very good, that's just a bit weird and sad (that no one caught it).  And what is with an up-charge of $.75 to make entrees ""Spicy"" -- ?!?!?  Like adding some heat in a Costa Rican restaurant should cost extra?!  And for that matter, the dish I got, which was $11, really shouldn't have been more than $8 or $9 (max).  I get the sense that Irazu is milking the area and media notoriety more than just a bit.  But I will give them props for keeping some less expensive items on the menu (like a $5 quesadilla).   Another thing that confused me about Irazu was the lack of tasty, zippy or otherwise remarkable sauces, etc.  When we asked if there was anything interesting in the way of dipping sauce we might have with one of our appetizers, we were told that the salsa they served with the chips on the table was basically it.  They had some optional garlic oil (mojo), but that wasn't particularly flavorful as it's just garlic and oil for the most part.  IMO, making a few interesting sauces and condiments available would go a long way.   At the end of the day, things were generally tasty and there was no issue with quality.  Sitting in what amounts to a big enclosed patio and paying relatively premium prices ($15 per person for lunch not including beverages and tip) for lackluster service and missed opportunities for engagement and rapport are another matter.  At the very least, I hope the owners read this and realize that people who are not eating their meat specialties might enjoy some extra pops of flavor -- and paying any up-charge for a ""spicy"" option on dishes over $10 doesn't reflect an appreciation for Irazu's customers.  Charge me a dollar or two for a pair or trio of flavorful specialty sauces on the side, and I'm cool.  Charge me a few quarters to sprinkle some hot pepper in my food and you've kinda lost my respect for your priorities.   I miss the ""old"" feel of Irazu -- before the hype, and when it felt like they were anxious to please customers by trying to meet their needs.  But as it stands right now, I'm afraid the vibe I got this go-around was that it was less about me and more about them.  This extends from the ""Cash Only"" decree from our server after putting down a credit card (which I still fail to understand the rationale for other than profit margins), to the lack of any interest in getting the least bit creative about trying to meet a simple request for something other than the salsa on the table (which we already had with chips) to dip unseasoned yucca in.   Bottom line:  I don't think you'll get a bad meal here, but you there may be some bumps in the road along the way.",0.9957,0.784,0.145,0.071,0.5126856118791602

2015-03-18,5.0,"Absolutely no complaints about Irazu (except maybe that it's cash only, but they're very upfront about that on the menu, so I can deal). Irazu has a fantastic menu of options that kept me very happy the one time I came here. I can't wait to try a lot of the other great options.  I ordered a chicken sandwich (I don't remember what the name was in Spanish). It was great, but my absolute favorite would probably be the empanadas and the oatmeal shake (with no extra ingredients). The best empanada, in my opinion, was the plantains. I officially love sweet empanadas. The crust was perfectly flaky with a bit of a crunch to it without being burnt at all. Definitely don't miss out on the empanadas if you come here! They're also a very affordable $3 a pop. I recommend ordering a few of these to share as an appetizer like we did. Now, let's talk the oatmeal shake. It reminds me a lot of a frozen slushie version of horchata, except with a smoother consistency than a slushie; it wasn't really icy at all except for toward the end where we actually had to add a little bit of water so we could enjoy the rest of it. There's not way in heck I'm going to share the next time I come here because I want to savor one of these babies all on my own! Even though it tasted so good, I am still a little curious if the taste could be improved by additional fruit (like mango). Perhaps I'll find out next time! This will for sure be a regular place to drop by (when I happen to have cash on me) in the future as the weather warms up.",0.9979,0.702,0.258,0.04,0.5383579383579383

When we did get seated it was in a cramp corner and neither of us could move our legs...then it took them about twenty minutes to take our order. We had the pepito sandwich, a taco tico, an empanada, and a pitcher of the oatmeal shake. Over an hour later we had not received our food. The waiter came by exactly two times, to take our order and bring our food. There was one guy there that was really nice but unfortunately I did not get his name. When finally did get the food, it was okay. They were all really small portions but I guess they were somewhat cheap so I guess they've got that going for them. The taco was literally drowned in cabbage, but I will say I liked the mushroom empanada. I was really disappointed because there were several people who came in and ordered after us and they got their food way before us. It was just an upsetting experience overall. The food was okay but it's definitely not worth the way we were treated. Shout out to that one nice guy though.

2015-03-01,5.0,"Any excuse I get to go to Irazu, I take. But I think many people feel this sentiment (just look at all the reviews!), so I'm going to leave my first tip early: I came by with a friend last Saturday night for dinner around 9. We were able to be seated within 60 seconds, maybe less, but the host told us the last group had been waiting for an hour--so timing is key, and I'd recommend just before or just after peak hours to avoid the wait. The alternative to that is order delivery--you'll definitely have a bit of a wait, but nothing too unreasonable. I was in the neighborhood and the food was delivered to my friend's within 45 minutes of placing the order--I just ordered it about an hour before we were planning to eat, so it worked out perfectly. Take heed to this advice and do the same if you're looking for delivery. There is a $15 delivery order minimum, though, so just make sure you're cognizant of that as you're picking and choosing from all the delicious sandwiches, burritos, sides, and such. Next tip? If you're dining in you should know that this place is BYO! If you didn't come prepared, though, no worries. The shakes they've got here really will bring all the boys to the yard. Most flavors are fruity, but they've got a traditional chocolate and vanilla, too. You can order shakes with one flavor or, for a couple bucks more, spice it up and mix two. As for food, its hard to know where to start, because its really all so delicious. Definitely don't fill up on the free chips and salsa before you get your meal--you're going to need plenty of room for all of the delicious menu items. I've split the Chifrijo with friends on a couple occasions and it's delish. The empanadas are also amazing. My favorites are the plantains and beef & potatoes. For the main dish, my go-to is the Vegetarian Burrito with sweet plantains thrown in. I usually can't finish it in one sitting since it's packed with so many good veggies, beans, rice, etc.  In summary: Go. Go eat here now.

2015-02-26,4.0,"Irazu has been on my list for a whole because of the vegetarian-friendly food. We had been putting off coming here for many months because we never seemed to have sufficient amount of cash to cover it. We realized we both had cash on a weekday evening after my boyfriend picked me up from the airport, so we decided to drop by for dinner.  We started with the spinach and cheese empanada and the plantain empanada. Both were good. The spinach filed up half the empanada whole the cheese filled up the other half. This made it difficult for sharing, as we cut them in half. I had never had a sweet empanada and the plantain was a great option. It was $2.95 for each one.  We also ordered the oatmeal shake made with milk based on Yelp reviews and other advice. We were definitely not led astray! I will dream about this shake. It basically tastes like an Horchata milkshake, complete with a sprinkling of cinnamon on too. Just get it, no questions asked. For the cheap price, there's really no excuse. If was mostly oatmeal at the end, so we added a little water so it was possible to sip with the straw.  I got the veggie sandwich on french bread, which had eggplant, avocado, black bean paste, lettuce, and another vegetable. It was only $6 and was pretty filling, which is saying something considering I was hungry from traveling all day.  The only thing keeping this from a five star review is that 1) it's cash only, which is fine if you're prepared (they list that in huge lettering on the menu so you know before you order anything). Also, 2) the ends of my lettuce leaves were seriously wilted/slightly browned. After such an awesome experience otherwise, this was a bit of a damper to see hey hadn't used fresh ingredients. I tried to ignore this because I loved Irazu otherwise. I will DEFINITELY be back.

But everything I had heard about Irazu came true the other night when we found ourselves in the neighborhood for a show at the nearby Gorilla Tango theater.  Armed with a couple of bottle of our favorite wine (Its BYOB) we stepped up to the hostess stand and put our name on the list. Here's a hint, we had stopped in before the show to put our name on the list as the waiting time can be up to 1.5 hours and this really worked to our advantage as we only needed to wait for about 30 minutes for a large table that would fit our party of 8.  I suspect if we had been less people, it would have been a shorter wait. If you order nothing else, order the ceviche.  Delicious, fresh and just the perfect thing to go with the crunchy chips.  We tried a wide range of items from the pork bowl to the empanadas to the burritos.  Our server was excellent and even though it was the end of the night, was pleasant and personable to those at our table. Bring a coat if it is cooler out as the dining room is really more of a patio and the breeze blows through the place.  I also know they do delivery so this may be the best option to enjoy the great food without the wait. The prices are cheap and the BYOB policy make it even cheaper!  It's almost a steal.

Usually we're a group of 4-8. Decided to try Irazu on the recommendation of one in the group, as they were known for good food and a casual atmosphere.  I'm a very reasonable person. And a lot of the negativity directed in the review that follows is because the restaurant doesn't live up to a ""reasonable person"" standard. The story: I arrived very early, 30 min prior to the rest of my party, and was advised by a female hostess that when more than 50% of our party arrived we could be seated. OK, absolutely understood. So I bided my time. Eventually, all of our party except one person arrived. There was turnover at the host stand and a male host now advised us he would not seat us until our entire party was present. Mind you, it was a Friday night and there were open tables. In my opinion, being one person short on a large party when there is no wait is not an unreasonable request to be seated. But the male host refused to budge. Given the inability to accommodate us while we waited for one more person, our group decided to go elsewhere. Upon telling this to the host, he dismissed us and clearly was not bothered that we took out business elsewhere. Bottom line: inflexible seating policy and not good for groups unless the entire party is present. I can't comment on the food because I didn't eat. However, given our poor experience with something as simple as the host stand, I assure you I won't be going back or recommending this establishment to others.",0.9661,0.821,0.127,0.052,0.41632440476190474

Is everything. I somehow failed to mention that I don't really do over easy eggs and someone in the kitchen must have been psychic cause it was just the way I like it...still done with light yolk.  3) The quantity of food given is worth the price.

I wish I could find somewhere to buy it! Their green salsa also has a great spicy kick and is excellent on their fresh tortilla chips.  Only slight downsides are the cramped dining room (we were seated by children... who cried...). I am all for children not being allowed into restaurants.

2014-09-10,2.0,"First experience at Irazu - likely the last.  Party of 4 and I will start by saying that our server, Sonny, was great.  I will also say I thought the empanadas as an appie were very good as well.  We ordered A LOT of appies and then moved onto the entrees. For me, this is where the goodness ended. I ordered the ""Chicago favorite"" pepito sandwich.  I figured I would keep it simple and go with what seemed like a staple on the menu.  What arrived was nothing short of pathetic.  An anemically thin piece of cold chicken with a tiny ""smear"" of black beans hiding under the half melted cheese on stale bread.  I actually had to ask for a menu again to see if I actually ordered this depressed sandwich disaster.  Having cooked pepito sandwiches myself, I was happily validated when the menu showed that it should have had a healthy bit of black beans, sautéed onions, MELTED cheese and sauce on a roll that presumably shouldn't have been stale.   This place gets great reviews so I'm not sure how this sad sammie made it out of the kitchen but one bite was quite enough and I'm certain I'm not to blame for it.  Called over Sonny and showed him, in all its lame close-up detail, a simple sandwich prepared so poorly it was conservatively missing 3 out of 4 key components. Sonny was very apologetic; offered to get me something else which, as any frequent diner knows, sucks because everyone at your table will be long done with their meal by the time your new order arrives.  I appreciated the offer but politely declined.  I was not, of course, charged for this one-bite wonder and was told they would give me a gift certificate which I thought was very appropriate and would make me come back to give this place another try.   What I received was a gift cert. for ""one small appetizer"" with a handwritten note saying ""thanks for your feedback.""   Feedback????  I didn't suggest you get new glassware (which you need, fyi).  Maybe writing ""sorry about your sandwich sucking"" on a gift cert. for ANOTHER SANDWICH, may have been the proper thing to do. Oh please Irazu, I can't wait to run back for a free, small plate of your yuca fries.  I think not. The rest of my party said their entrees were ""good"" not great. So many other places in the city are better and know how to properly handle what was clearly a quality control issue in their kitchen.",0.9947,0.784,0.169,0.047,0.5119156500065591

We frequented Irazu when we lived in the city a few years ago so it was an obvious contender for us, but they really knocked it outta the park.  The food was delicious (duh!), the service was top notch and everyone in attendance had a great time. We reserved the patio for a few hours on a Friday (early dinner) for a big ol party of 57 and can I just say that even getting that reservation on a Friday speaks volumes as to how cool and accommodating the folks at Irazu are. Justin was so wonderful to work with in the months leading up to the dinner and I really appreciated just how genuine and helpful he and the rest of the staff were. The owner Henry also made a point to say hello and check in with us during dinner and really made us feel special. And! They even let our sweet puppy-child Bruce join us at the party when we realized last minute that we didn't have anywhere to put him that day.  Awesome people all around!

2014-09-08,5.0,"I live right by Irazu and am a frequent customer, so I can't believe this is my first time reviewing. Everything about it (except for the long evening waits) is great. Most of the time we call our order in for pick up and the wait for that has never been longer than 30 minutes. There hasn't been anything on the menu we haven't loved. Personal favorites include the casado, pepito sandwich, milanesa sandwich, and chicken burrito (which you should ask for the spicy version). The shakes are really good, especially the mango mixed with BYOB tequila....or do what we do and order 2 shakes that you mix with tequila at home! Service is always friendly and remember that it is cash only! I would also like to review their private party space and services as earlier this year, we were lucky enough to host our rehearsal dinner with Irazu. About half a block away from the restaurant, they have a private party room that fits around 35 people. This is also BYOB, which was fantastic. I believe we had the space for either 2 or 3 hours, but were able to drop off alcohol earlier to put on ice as well as bring in decorations. We were able to plug in an iphone into their speakers, they can set up a coat check area, and have a little bar. There is a single unisex bathroom as well. The service was, again, incredibly friendly--from the initial phone call to inquire about the space until we left that evening, everyone was so accommodating. The price per person was very affordable and they offer a set menu that you can customize. At this point I can't quite remember all of the food we had, but the chifrijo and flan were soooo good. Any leftovers that our relatives didn't want to take home, they donated to a food shelter. I wish we had another party coming up so we could rent the space again!",0.969,0.874,0.097,0.029,0.5197916666666667

2014-09-02,5.0,"Awesome spot in Bucktown featuring Costa Rican food (a rarity in most cities). The Pepito sandwich is basically the Central American/Caribbean version of a cheesesteak and I would argue it's much more flavorful given the fact you can add hot peppers and an avocado on it. Also of note is the chifrijo, which is (and I am paraphrasing) rice and beans, pico de gallo, and chicharron (fried pork). Awesome.  If you want Caribbean meets Central American, come to Irazu. Oh and the oatmeal shake is AMAZING. I wanted to find something like this after moving from Brooklyn and missing the plantain porridge found in a vegan rasta spot in Prospect Heights.  So basically: Get the chifrijo, the rib-eye steak pepito, and an oatmeal shake for dessert. The wait was not bad at all and I would most certainly come back again! One bad: Very loud in here if you choose to sit inside. The speakers blare music so keep that in mind!",0.967,0.8,0.155,0.045,0.5440476190476191

Munster was the right choice for cheese imo. chifrijo. I would imagine this is just ridiculous in person when it's fresh.. but I love it even from home. I am a big fan of Latin beans and rice combos.. and this just takes it to another level with the pico de gallo and avocado. let's not forget the lizano sauce.. it's a just a nice bowl of texture and flavor exploding in your mouth with a nice crisp from their fresh chips.  oatmeal shake. what in the world. didn't know this existed till a few months ago when I discovered irazu.. didn't really know what to expect. so. good. not too thick. not too sweet. I usu get the regular avena shake.. tried it with strawberry once and I felt like it took away from the original flavor of the avena shake. and I always add plantains on the side.

2014-08-14,5.0,"BYOB, cheap, delicious Costa Rican food, big patio, casual & laid back, great service, around the corner from our new condo...5 stars!! Have been here twice already since we started house hunting in the area, and have tried the steak pepito sandwich, ceviche, empanadas & the chicken el tico dish, which was recommended by our waiter. Pepito sandwich and the el tico are both amazing, and we also loved the empanadas. Meat is tender, juicy & flavorful...and if you love spicy food, you can add jalapeño to pretty much everything.  Apparently this was on Diners & Dives, and is a popular joint, so I have noticed it gets very busy and can get lines on the weekends.  For any Los Angelenos, Irazu reminds me a TON of Cha Cha Chicken in Santa Monica, though it is a different type of food & definitely not right off the beach....but the BYOB, cheap & amazing ethnic food, beach hut feel are a throwback to my days living in SoCal!!  Couple tips: Cash only-- but if you forget, they do have an ATM inside. BYOB and liquor store is just a couple blocks away.  Will continue to go back here & I worry about my waistline. Update in January 2015: Have been back a number of times and Irazu is consistently good. The reason for updating my review is that I finally tried the Oatmeal Shake for the first time and it was AMAZING!! It was every bit as good as everyone says it is. The only other thing I'll add is that we used their catering delivery back in the fall and I definitely recommend it. We got couple meat and veggie trays, picked up some tortillas and used them to make tacos. They were on time, the food arrived hot, the portions they recommend for different group sizes are accurate and we got lots of compliments on the food.",0.9906,0.812,0.157,0.031,0.612183140933141

2014-08-09,5.0,"Roses are red,  Margaritas should be blue,  I love, love you,  mi favorito, Irazu! My hunt for amazing Latin food in Chicago has been like a real-life soap opera.  It's been a six month journey that has taken me all over the place except abuelita's house. When Irazu is closed, it makes me sad - they should operate a 1-800 support hotline to get us through those long, dark, closed hours.  I'll be the Irazu junkie sitting outside the front door with the detox shakes going on.  Speaking of shakes, I had one of those too, I'll tell you all about it. Admittedly, after reading all of my fellow Yelper's reviews on Irazu, I was super-duper excited to try them for the first time.  I spent all day stalking their web site.  I was totally checking out food porn (the menu and Yelp pics) at work...I had it down, my selections selected, and ready to be amazed then I realized it was like 9:30am.  So for the next seven hours I went back and forth, what if I made the wrong selections, what if when I get there I throw a wildcard just to screw with myself (love doing that sometimes) and decide to bunk my selections.  How would I handle this upset in planning?  Then I got nervous that I had Irazu so built up in my mind that it would be impossible for them to ever top what I knew they were going to be like.  In that case I'd have to give them like two stars because I totally made up their mission statement, business model and SEC filings; I digress. The owner, Henry Cerdas, seems to be totally connected through technology.  Irazu has Facebook - I do not.  Irazu has Twitter and of course you can review them on Yelp.  As far as I can tell, Henry consistently reads reviews on his restaurant and responds to those reviews.  He digs in to try and find out why a guest had a less than perfect experience.  You can totally tell that he shines when someone has a great experience, too.  All in all, that - to me - is worth five stars because a business owner that cares that much about their guest's experience gets my utmost respect.  I truly believe that nine times out of ten, an engaged business owner, like Henry, will prove to be a great experience because they care. Obviously I didn't have to live with them disappointing by me having them so built up in my mind before I even arrived.  Here's a quick list of what you can expect when you visit Irazu: CASH ONLY BYOB - NO CORKING FEE CASUAL ATMOSPHERE, from shorts and a tee to ascots and a derby Our friends beat us to Irazu.  They didn't seat them because they were an incomplete party - cool with me because I love to make a grand entrance.  As soon as we arrived in our black car, yes, you must take a black car to Irazu, Henry insists it's the coolest way to travel in style to his restaurant...I kid, I kid...biking is the coolest way.  Anyway, as soon as we arrived we were seated immediately.   Our server, Sonny, came over and immediately went to work on showing us his dedication to superior customer service.  We each (party of four) had a bottle of wine - that's how we roll.  Sonny had the corkscrew in hand and was ready to start it flowin.  He was so incredibly good at his job, he even offered to store the whites in the fridge to keep them cool on an otherwise warm evening.  Sonny was amazing from start to finish.  His up-beat demeanor mixed with product knowledge and can-do attitude made me want to get up and work the shift with him!  I'll ask for him every time we come back.   Sonny got our wine glasses, told us our waters, chips and salsa were on their way and he'd be back to take our order.  The chips were nice and crisp and I loved the tomatillo-style salsa.  It arrived at our table in a squirty bottle which is fabulous because you aren't all trying to share out of one or two bowls.  And I don't have to murder my friends for double-dipping. Being vegan here's what I ordered:  VEGGIE BURRITO: I opted to get the sautéed mushrooms and plantains added into my burrito.  DELISH!!!  At the time of this review the basic, so-not-basic veggie burrito is $5.95!!!  Add $1 per additional stuffin' item (mushrooms and plantains for me, please) and you just got your self the most orgasmic veggie burrito for $7.95!  So big and filling I didn't need anything else but I still ordered more. VEGGIE TACO: two corn tortillas because corn tortillas usually break on me so nice touch with having a back up.  SUPER fresh ingredients...mmmm so yummy! OATMEAL SHAKE WITH BANANA: OMG so good.  It sounds really weird but I'm so serious y'all...you HAVE to try it! It's important to note that the level of spice is perfectly balanced.  It's not Tex-Mex folks so it's not out of control. I am giving Irazu five stars because I can't give it 10 but, in a way...I just did!  I will be back to Irazu, I recommend Irazu to everyone reading this and I will recommend it to all of my friends and family.",0.9982,0.838,0.139,0.023,0.5286296296296296

2014-07-20,3.0,"Was excited to come here because we went to Costa Rica a couple of months ago, and we wanted to relive our Pura Vida experience. Came here on a Saturday afternoon, probably around 2pm.  No wait for a table, thank God.  We were seated right away in the patio outside.  It was great weather for al fresco lunch!  We waited for a bit for our waiter, but I soon noticed that he was taking care of most of the tables on this side of the patio.  So I mentally pardoned him for taking so darn long.  Anyway we got our orders in, and the waiter mentioned that they forgot to bring us chips when they gave us water + plates + utensils.  I didn't even know they were supposed to bring us chips, and the waiter said he'd bring them.   I ended up ordering the casado (tilapia), and my boo ordered some empanadas (beef, chicken, and zucchini) and a little taquito-like taco.   Maybe 15 minutes passed since ordering and we still don't have the promised chips.  He was busy.  We had to flag him to ask for the chips. Thank God for BYOB policy, we just kept drinking to pass the time. Haha!  Our orders came at an acceptable time.  Food looked good.  I felt my tilapia was a bit overcooked (it was a little tough to cut) but it still had good flavors.  Loved the over medium egg over the rice.  Liked the cabbage salad but it didn't need that Thousand Island dressing, which, thankfully, was on the side.  Also came w/ black beans -- can't go wrong w/ black beans and rice! The boyfriend thought his empanadas were okay but he's a bit picky.  I liked the zucchini empanada -- maybe it could have used more seasoning for the filling but i liked it.  He didn't care too much about the taquito-taco thing, but I did like the sauce that came w/ it. In the end I made sure I had room for the oatmeal shake.  It was reminiscent of the Mexican drink, Horchata, but you could def taste the oatmeal flavor. Service, this whole time was pretty slow.  I had to flag the waiter for the bill.  I understand he was taking care of all the tables on our side and we had some bigger parties on this side of the patio too, but still.  Maybe someone called in sick. I would return to try more of the stuff on the menu.   4 stars for food, but had to knock it down 1 star for the slow service.",0.9973,0.796,0.179,0.026,0.5464065255731922

The oatmeal shake is delicious, reminded me of horchata but tastier. The green juice they make onsite is ok, but served without ice and was pretty much warm juice-not so pleasant. This would be a great place for a friend's birthday lunch or group get-together because you can be as loud as the traffic! I also loved the latin music they play on the patio.

Our waiter informed my friend and I (also gluten intolerant) of the THREE items on the vast menu that we couldn't eat...only three items besides the sandwiches folks - not so bad. There were so many options, I wouldn't get a sandwich even if I wanted one. Even the tortilla chips were gluten free because they had a dedicated deep fryer.  I had ceviche and the palmito salad-both incredibly fresh and satisfying. They had many more savory dishes on the menu including some standard dishes you can get at many Latin American Restaurants and others that were more Costa Rican specific. There's something there for everyone. Atmosphere: Great rap-around outdoor patio. If you closed your eyes you could easily pretend you were on a beach on vacation somewhere beautiful. The Latin music is upbeat and makes you want to shake what your mama gave you.  Service:  Upon arrival the owner took our name down, poured us a glass of wine to enjoy while we waited, and stored the rest of it for us in the fridge.

I usually enjoy the meals I've had there, it's pretty good comfort food. Nothing amazing, just hearty and satisfying. Usually they get it mostly right, but I have to say that my newest experience here was a little different. I asked the inexperienced waiter what the sauce was on my plate, and he said he didn't know... Ok, maybe do some research and find that out when a customer asks? It seems like much of the waitstaff here is now young and inexperienced, which is slightly different than how things were when it was more of a mom and pop operation.  Secondly, it was very loud in the restaurant. There was a table full of tecate-drinking young ladies that was extra loud, plus, everyone was speaking loudly to be able to hear themselves over them as a result. Compounding this were crashing noises from the back kitchen that were very loud, and the fact that the restaurant has nothing but flat reflective surfaces means that sometimes you just wish things were a little quieter so you could actually have an intimate conversation there. It's not much better outside either - what can you expect when the crowd is so animated...

Which is why it's so tasty.  Anyway, they use MSG, they need to tell their employees this, and a waiter should be certain about food and allergies because it really made for a horrible evening. I started to realize within 5 min of having the appetizer that the waiter misinformed me, so I asked him again and he said no MSG is used. I ended up not eating anything and I brought my entree home to my fiancé. On my walk home, I called the restaurant and asked if they used MSG and they put me on hold to ask the cooks. Not even a minute later they're back and tell me the rice, their homemade sauce and something else has it in it and that they can't guarantee no cross contamination. I said thank you and hung up. That's all it took; a quick run to the kitchen to check with the cooks. Don't mess around food allergies people, and to my waiter, if I ate my steak entree I would've had to go to the hospital because then my reaction is too bad to handle with pepto bismol.

So I've heard that Irazu was featured on ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,"" and even though Guy Fieri is dumber than a box of rocks, my Pepito sandwich (with steak, avocado, spicy Lizano sauce, cheese, all on a crusty French bread) was a hell of a trip to ""flavor town.""  For $6, I got a good portion and added a side of plantains for $2.  The plantains are caramelized, and were just as good as a side as they would be for dessert. I also had one of their much talked about Oatmeal Shakes.  I had the oatmeal with chocolate and soy.  The consistency was more like chocolate milk than a traditional milkshake, but it was very good.  Since I expected something thicker and more dessert-like, I probably wouldn't get one of these again.  It's worth trying once though, because if you go to Irazu and don't try a shake, it's like going to Disney and not shaking hands with Mickey Mouse. Also, it's BYOB with no corkage fee, so take advantage of it! They were definitely busy on a Thursday night, and if you want to sit on the patio definitely make a reservation.  My friend made a reservation here for 11 people at 8:00 p.m.  They have a basic reservation system (names and times written on an order pad) and happened to lose ours.  We were seated pretty quickly though, and management was kind enough to give my friend a gift certificate for her next visit as an apology.",0.9921,0.766,0.196,0.037,0.48710526315789476

WOW!!  He let me know heaters were now installed in the front part of the restaurant for the winter, so guests will now be warm and cozy while eating their tasty meals. He invited me and my boyfriend back for a second visit, so that we can enjoy the meal and have a positive experience. Boy am I glad I took him up on his offer. This was a completely different experience. We went again on a colder rainy day and it was so comfortable inside. We we're seated right away and had excellent service. The owner came to meet me and apologize again in person. I was again very surprised and happy I got to meet him. He takes pride in his restaurant, service and food and wants every customer to leave happy and full.  The food was never an issue. Everything we had was incredible, but I couldn't enjoy it because of the experiences that led up to it. We ordered pretty much the same meals as we had the last time and they were outstanding. Steak was cooked to perfectly and the sauce that comes out with the chips is soooo good. I actually asked if I can purchase some to take home with me.  I would definitely recommend Irazu to everyone that I know and actually have to a few co-workers already.

2014-05-02,4.0,"We've been wanting to try Irazu for many, many years. We finally got around to eating here, and we were not disappointed. La comida tipica en Costa Rica is known as the ""Casado."" What is it? This is a commonly known Costa Rican dish which consists of beans, rice with finely diced red bell peppers and onions, fried plantains (usually platanos maduros), a cabbage salad with tomato and carrot, and your choice of meat (usually pollo, fish, pork, or rib eye steak with grilled onions). La carne (the meat) que viene con el Casado is grilled or sautéed, but never fried. We ordered the Casado with rib eye and it was flavorful and tender. All the sides complemented the rib eye nicely and made for the perfect amalgamation. This dish is worthy of FIVE stars. My husband ordered the grilled steak, and he thought it also deserved FIVE stars. He said the grilled steak was incredibly flavorful, super tender and one of the best cuts of meat he has had in a while. He enjoyed the yellow rice, beans, sweet plantains (also known as platanos maduros or platanos dulce) and small salad. If you have had the pleasure of exploring different Latin American cuisine, such as, Colombian, Cuban, Barbados, Dominican, Peruvian and Puerto Rican, you will be happy that you tried Irazu's cuisine. It definitely offers up tropical Carribean flavors with a zest of unique twists. Latin Caribbean cuisine is a combination of local and imported ingredients and culinary methods that melds cultural traditions and heritage. It is a sensational blend of striking colors, tropical tastes, aromatic herbs and spices and exciting flavors, sure to leave your taste buds craving more. The Chef, Miriam, opened the restaurant in 1990, and it is going stronger than ever. My compliment to Chef Miriam for getting it RIGHT every single time. Todo siempre esta muy delicioso. Irazu has a great following from people of all ages and from all over the city (and in some cases, suburbanites, who are not afraid and open-minded enough to explore authentic Costa Rican cusine in the heart of the City). I have a friend who is ""afraid"" to come to the City, but I know not every suburbanite feels this way about the city. There are many outstanding restaurants in the City, including, Irazu. A very, very long time ago my husband took a trip to Costa Rica. He loved the country, the food, the culture, the beautiful rain forest, and the warmth of the people. He agreed that the food here is as authentic as it gets and it reminded him of all the foods that he ate while in Costa Rica. NOTE: As is usually the case with most ""mom and pop"" Latin restaurants they do not accept any plastic of any kind. Be sure to bring a nice red wine to complement your dinner (especially if you are eating steak or chicken). They have an awesome selection of vegetarian dishes, so vegetarians are bound to find something great here. We would have rated Irazu with five stars, but the wait was crazy long, it is cash only (which is a deal breaker in my book), and the service was super slow. Our server was hospitable, but not overly attentive. Our water glasses were kept filled and we were given extra napkins (without asking) which we appreciated. Did we enjoy the food? Was the price-point reasonable? Was the service hospitable? Was the food authentic in flavor? Si, si, si to all these questions.",0.9992,0.79,0.196,0.015,0.6024682539682539

The cheese empanadas were delicious as well! I was a bit nervous of trying some new flavors and food, but I am glad I did.

2014-04-27,4.0,"Perhaps they are on Latin time. The wait on Saturday night at 8 was quoted as a half hour, and they were kind enough to give us a slip of paper that on on side directed us to a couple bars, and on the other, couple package stores to get BYOB. They took down our numero de telefono to call us when our table came up--I like that style. It was a little more than an hour later when we got the call, but we were happily settled-in at Green Eye Lounge; so the wait wasn't a big deal. But that story is cross-referenced elsewhere. We sat on the covered sidewalk (perhaps an updated, Latin ""Little House on the Prairie"") which, even with the big heater was a bit chilly in the 40 degree, end of April never-ending Chicago winter.  I don't know if chips and salsa are Costa Rican (I don't remember having them there, but it was a while ago), but the green salsa was delicious, as were the fresh chips. We had some tasty guacamole and patacones (smashed, fried green plantains) with pungent smoked garlic sauce--a feast for all senses involved. Highly recommended. I had the ""onioned steak dinner"" which was tasty, though a bit too well-done for my liking, though I asked for a side of Costa Rica's famous Linzano sauce (a bit similar to Worcestershire sauce), which helped it out. Also, I should have noticed that it would come with patacones when we ordered the appetizer, but you can't have too many of them, and I'm counting them as a fruit even though their being fried must turn that positive into a negative. Make sure you spend the extra cents on the gallo pinto (""spotted rooster""), which contains no rooster (though I have to believe that the rooster means it helps wake you up when eaten at breakfast), but is a Costa Rican spotted delight of black beans, rice, some onion, garlic, herbs & spices, and a little of Linzano. Others have remarked on the oatmeal shake taste sensation, and I concur. Nothing oatmealy about it, though it makes a great thickener, and I'm a huge fan of horchata; the two have similar flavors. Of course, we filled-up too much on appetizers, but that gave us an extra meal to take home. Outside of the underestimated wait time, the service was excellent.

I was so darn hungry and when I looked on Yelp for a restaurant nearby, this popped up. My daughter has raved about it so it was an easy decision. Once we get there, we realized it was cash only so we pooled our cash. We had 47.00 between us which had to cover food, drinks, tax and tip. It was an easy enough challenge and very different for us, we normally just order like hungry truck drivers and  throw the meal on a card.  I figured food and drinks couldn't be more than 38.00 or 19.00 apiece. I'm not very good at math but I realized I couldn't get the ceviche, a dinner plate and a shake. What was my trump card? The shake. What else looked fabulous and was cheap? An empanada and a taco. Done. My hubz got a sandwich and some rice and he let me try them. Fabulous! My shake was my splurge and worth every penny. I had oatmeal and blackberry and it was practically a meal unto itself. My beef taco plus cheese, avocado and sour cream was the best taco I have ever eaten anywhere and this chica has eaten a huge pile o tacos in her life. The mushroom empanada was perfection but I was glad I was married as when I bit into it, the hot delicious inside juice squirted across the table. Wouldn't that be a hoot on a first date? (I mention this because I think the table next to us was on a first date and I felt a little awkward just watching them. But I digress.) As we were on a self imposed cash restriction we didn't order apps or dessert but I have to admit, we ate every single chip in that basket. And loved them! My husband paid the bill and left the tip while I was in the washroom. Upon my return I asked him if we had any money left. And we did, 15.00.

The servers are helpful when ordering and attentive during your dining experience. Started with Taco Tica and Empanadas- chicken, plantain and bean- everything was sooooo good! Ordered the Onioned Steak for my entree and as always, it was absolutely delicious! Definitely substitute gallo pinto for white rice and beans. The steak was seasoned perfectly and the sides really complimented the dish.  I always have to order a side of steak fries, because they are so good and always served hot.  Irazu is casual dining with no frills and no fancy fixtures. In the summer they do have outdoor seating. With consistently good food, good service AND BYOB, you will not be disappointed!",0.9944,0.663,0.305,0.032,0.6203703703703703

I waited for almost an hour to be seated while my mouth watered. Haha. We ordered empanadas --Beef and chicken. I wasn't a fan of the beef but the chicken was tasty. Now.. dinner time. Dinner plate: Steak, black beans, yellow rice and cabbage salad. Honestly the only thing I enjoyed was the sweet plantains. Everything else was kinda bland, too many onions and the rice was over cooked. The beans were... alright. I seriously didn't enjoy this place and was mostly upset that it cost $50 bucks. I won't be back here. I also wish that ""yelpers"" had better TASTE in restaurants bc I believed that this place would be awesome. :( And also this place was filled with a bunch of wealthy snobby yuppies or shall I say ""Old Hipsters"".",0.9684,0.688,0.214,0.098,0.6273333333333333

2014-03-18,4.0,"Irazu sounds Japanese and the appearance looks just like 99 Miles but don't be fooled - it's actually Costa Rican cuisine. Prior to Irazu, I had no clue to what Costa Rican cuisine was but after looking over the menu, it seemed like a blend of Latin flavors. It seemed like a combination of Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican cuisines. We ordered the oatmeal shakes, yuca and mojo, and chifrijo. If you love Mexican horchata, then you must get the oatmeal shake. It's a dense milkshake form of horchata and it's awesome. Beware for those who are lactose intolerant because you'll need a lactaid. The chifrijo is chicharron and frijoles combined. If you aren't familiar with those words, imagine a burrito bowl from Chipotle with fried pork fat. It's delicious and made me want to write Chipotle to add chicharron to their menu. The place is loud and gets crowded fast. With most items averaging $10 and BYOB with no cork fee, it's no wonder that Irazu does well.",0.9725,0.78,0.166,0.055,0.425

The oatmeal shake was outstanding; i almost ordered another. My wife had a steak burrito, cuz that's all she ever gets, and i tried it and it was surprisingly good. I wish we had brought some rum so they could make us a drink, but we did bring some wine. The bill was surprisingly small for how full we were and how good the food tasted. Small and intimate atmosphere. 30 min wait but that was to be expected on a Friday night.

I take it from my experience, you don't go for the atmosphere, you go for the food and lots and lots of people do. We got there at 6pm with a party of six adults and two kids. We were seated right away; which was awesome considering they don't take reservations. BYOB, and we did. Please and thank you. Our server was outstanding, making recommendations, being patient, and taking our food allergies into consideration. I had the oatmeal shake everyone raves about and I am hooked. It's been a week and I've tried replicating it at home four times. I'm close, but not quite there so I guess I'll have to go back to Irazu to make sure I'm not missing something.  We had a shared appetizer the chifrijo. It was alright. I wasn't blown away. My entree was the pepito sandwich with hot peppers and it was excellent.

Irazu fit all those criteria. The menu has a wide range of vegetarian options and meat-loaded options, which should satisfy everyone at the table.  I'm new to Costa Rican cuisine, but I liked everything I had here.  More specifically, I got the steak casado and we shared an order of plantains and chips with pico de gallo.  The casado, allegedly a very traditional dish, was a full flavored and hearty meal that was big enough for leftovers to-go.  They cover a lot of food groups on that one plate: fruits, veggies, meat, grains... it all combined to taste like what I imagine Costa Rica would ideally taste like. The restaurant carries itself at a manageable volume so that you can still hold a conversation and the waitstaff was patient with our questions.  Overall a great option for a laid back dinner with friends.",0.9899,0.799,0.194,0.006,0.5577823691460055

His dish was also a little tasteless, but at least the meat in the casado had a little flavor. It didn't come close to the one I had in Costa Rica, but at least there was a little more flavor than in the empanadas.   Their winter setup is also very interesting.

We started with the Chifrijo....order it, it is as good as they say it is!  It even is more of an experience, because it has more ways to eat it than nachos.  We all shared the shrimp and guacamole salad and I think it was the favorite of all 3 of ours.   Next course we shared with empanadas, the steak Casado and the steak pepito. The empanadas and steak casado rocked!  The pepito was properly suggested to us as perhaps best served for a luncheon sandwich.  Recommendation was spot on, we probably wouldn't order again for dinner, but it was good.  We enjoyed our beer and wine, they set us great opening our wine and servicing us with glasses.   Henry, the owner, introduced himself and spoke with us periodically throughout  the night, often sharing advise for our experience, advise we were asking for and in need of.  All of it was spots on!

When she found out about Irazu, right here in Chicago, she decided to invite me to try Costa Rican cuisine, and I was not disappointed. The restaurant is located off Milwaukee in Bucktown. Keep in mind this place is CASH ONLY. The place itself is a little on the small side, so it would be good for smaller groups.  They have a nice patio area that is heated during the wintertime.  So what to order? - CHIFRIJO. They have a small and a large portion. The small is actually enough to share among 2-3 people or can be satisfying as an entree for one. Chifrijo is basically rice, beans, lizano sauce, with pork bits and avocado. This dish is THE reason I keep coming back.  - Ceviche. I'm a fan. It's pretty consistent here. I don't always order ceviche, since I have chifrijo mostly, but would definitely recommend as an appetizer. - The Dinners here are pretty good. i've had the Casado before, which is full-out complete Costa Rican meal. Standard rice, beans, plantains, meat. Good value for the portion size. - Actually, I prefer ordering the empanadas over the dinners. They come in 3, 5, 7, or 9, so they are good to share. The empanadas are crispy with a delicious center and come in a variety of flavors. My go-to empanadas are spinach and cheese or sweet plantain.  - Last but not least, the Oatmeal shake is HIGHLY recommended. You can either make it with milk, water, or soy. I typically go with milk. I'd say the Oatmeal shake is similar in taste to Horchata, but something about the texture that adds to it. Love Love Love the Oatmeal Shake.

2014-01-08,5.0,"It's no secret that Irazu is great.  If it does happen to be a secret to you, you've apparently been living under a rock. And that sounds uncomfortable.  Their patio is positively divine during the Summer, but feel free to pass on eating indoors here during the colder months as the dining room is tiny a bit of an afterthought. Don't let inclement weather keep you from your patacones and plantains though! Irazu has what must be the largest delivery area in all of Chicago.  From Montrose, to 16th, to Pulaski, to Lake Shore Drive, they hit it all. If you don't live in that zone, well, then you're just shit out of luck. So there's that.  Irazu is amazing for their killer burritos, Costa Rican plate dinners (the El Tico with chicken is my fav) and, of course, the muy famoso oatmeal shake. Order all of the above, all at once, and you have a real tasty feast. Don't forget to ask for a side of their yummy, extra garlicky mojo, too. No, not that kind of mojo. Not like ""I think I've lost my mojo."" Pronounced mo-ho, it's an amazing chunky-garlic-oil mixture that tastes like pure heaven on chicken, rice, burritos, EVERYTHING. Just don't plan any makeout sessions post-mojo consumption.  F'real.  So good. So affordable. And the guys here are super friendly. Support local!",0.9928,0.696,0.227,0.078,0.6222661396574439

Ate here with a couple of friends, one of whom is from Costa Rica.  She said the simple seasonings and offerings here are pretty similar to what can be found in Costa Rica. FOOD/DRINK:  * Chifrijo: highly recommended; similar to chips and salsa and with meat and beans * Casado: pretty good, but I would try something else next time; rib eye, onions, rice, beans, plantains, egg, cabbage salad; large portion, but the overload of onions and cabbage salad seemed like filler and not well proportioned * Shake (with some kind of fruit from Costa Rica): highly recommended; delicious; pretty sure they also added oatmeal, which made it extra filling and good SERVICE: good; no complaints AMBIANCE: At first we thought the seating area when walking in was the only option, which were iron tables and chairs, a covered area heated with large heaters, but a little unfriendly... especially in the cold Chicago winter.  We were happy to see the area of indoor seating towards the back.  Cozy, but colorful and warm.

That is why, when Jan 3 approached, I was determined to brave the weather and go eat at Irazu. Unfortunately, that was a poor decision. Basically, when we arrived we were seated on the outside patio area. I am surprised that people were still being seated outside, especially since everyone was eating with their winter coats on. The sources of heat for the night included two heating lamps and my black bean soup I quickly ordered. Other items that were ordered throughout the night included the Chifrijo (the small appetizer is more than sufficient for two people), Pepito sandwich (I chose steak and to add avocado for 50cents extra, very tasty and a big fan of their Lizano sauce), and the El Tico (chose steak as well, with similar contents to the Pepito, but the plantains and cabbage salad make the price well worth it).  I hope to come back sometime in the summer, because I see potential for this place to be great.

2013-12-29,4.0,"So, I definitely understand the appeal of this place.  However, let me explain something: the only reason I'm giving Irazu a 4-star rating is because of their prices and vast vegetarian menu.  The food here is typical and tastes like stuff you can get at other restaurants. However, the food is tasty for some average fare and the prices are so low that you HAVE to eat here.  I couldn't believe the entire bill for two people was less than $20 for an appetizer and two entrees.  Since it's BYOB, you don't have to waste your money on booze - stop across the street, get a six pack or a bottle of wine and enjoy yourself. In the summer and on weekends, be prepared to wait.  There's always a ton of people waiting to sit outside on the patio and this place is always bustling and crammed full of people.  There's also a steady stream of people coming in and out for take-out orders, so prepare to squeeze past them going to your table or the bathroom. I've heard the delivery is awesome, they don't charge a fee and they deliver almost anywhere.  Maybe I'll try that sometime and see if I'm more inclined to enjoy the food.",0.9492,0.873,0.104,0.023,0.47870370370370374

I wouldn't object to going back if a bunch of my friends wanted to eat there, but I would never choose to go back for a date and I would never recommend it.  It was among the most simple and bland Latin meals I've ever eaten.  I have no idea why it would be included on the Eater 38.  Still scratching my head about that one.",0.9152,0.775,0.14,0.085,0.5898979591836736

BF and I ordered a ton since so much sounded good - nothing disappointed and there's enough leftover for lunch today - great!  We ordered a small chifrijo, the pepito sandwich, the el tico dinner plate with chicken (upgraded to the gallo pinto on the side - yum), 2 empanadas (one spinach, one plantain) and finally an oatmeal shake (to go, because at that point we were so stuff, but we HAD to try it). Everything was delicious, and all of it was just $41.  Love that it's BYOB.  Two minor complaints that keep this from being a 5 star review. First, when our empanadas came out, both were just plain cheese. They were delicious, so we just kept them - plus the place was slammed at that time, and we figured it would be more trouble to ask for new ones than it was worth. I guess we'll have to go back and try the ones we actually ordered! Second is that as we were leaving, we noticed they have a ""Guy Fieri special,"" which includes a small chifrijo, a pepito, and an oatmeal shake for $15. This special is not listed in the menu, and our server did not tell us about it. Ultimately, we ordered all three of these things, but we didn't get the special price - each item was charged individually.

2013-09-25,3.0,"My wife and I honeymooned in Costa Rica.  2 out of 3 years, near our Anniversary, we have gone to eat at Irazu in commemoration of the great time (and great food) we had in CR.  Additionally, we have eaten there on at least one other occasion, and gotten take out at least once. I would say that based on my first visit I would have given this place 4 stars based on the food alone.  As far as the service/decor/cost/etc, nothing special, no complaints, no real praises.  However, I feel that each time we go back, I don't like it quite as much.  It is still tasty, and reasonably priced - but nothing special and I will unlikely continue to return unless my wife requests it.  I would probably give it a strong 3/3.5 star on food. The reason I am giving just 3 stars overall (and I thought about giving less) is to reflect their ""no credit card"" policy. Firstly - while this is a small(ish) restaurant - it has been around a while.  It isn't a hole in the wall in some backwoods part of IL, it is on a major thoroughfare in the city of Chicago.  To not accept credit cards in this day and age is really just totally ridiculous.  No one is going to stop eating at your establishment if you raise your prices a few cents to cover the 2-3% credit card transaction fees that you might get charged by your merchant provider!  (Oh...the drink is 1.85 instead of 1.75?  I'm leaving!). Secondly - OK, suppose you convince me of some legitimate reason why you shouldn't accept credit cards (good luck).  Well, don't you think it would be a good idea that you advertised this situation fully? (Partly shame on me here - because I had eaten here at least 2-3 times in the past but did not remember that they were cash-only.  I think I can be forgiven since it is less than once a year).  When we were close to being done my wife noticed a very small placard tucked away in the corner of the dining room that said something like ""cash only"" or ""no credit cards"" (can't remember which).  I mean, this sign was small - maybe the size of a large postcard, and tucked into the corner near the dish rack.  I realized I didn't have the cash on me and verified with the waiter that they only take cash (not even debit!). So - now there are two reasons that I am upset at how they handle their (ridiculous)  cash-only policy. 1) I checked all over the restaurant.  Besides the little sign I mentioned above, there is a small sticker on the cash register that says ""Cash-only"".  Neither of these things were really visible when entering the restaurant and being seated and their policy was not listed on the menus or called out by the wait staff.  And yet, as I surveyed the rest of the signage at the restaurant I was bombarded with info about their BYOB policies.  Don't you think advertising your methods of payment should be as important as your BYOB signage? 2) When I asked the waiter if there was an ATM around, I was pointed to one at the front of the restaurant that wanted to charge me a few dollars fee.  So - not only don't they take your credit cards, but they encourage you to use their ATM, which they certainly get a cut of.  No wonder they don't advertise their cash-only policy! I walked 1/4 mile to the Walgreens at Western and used the ATM there instead. I'll probably forget if we every go back that it is cash-only...it would just be nice if they tell you that before they seat you, so I can go and get cash before my meal instead of running out and ruining my dining experience. EDIT: To respond to the restaurant's comments below (aside: why does Yelp allow businesses to comment, but then not allow a response?).  Perhaps your menus on the site say ""Cash Only"", but the menus that were in the restaurant that  day did not.  Neither my wife nor I could find anything on them, when specifically looking.   Just wanted to add that I checked the historical internet archive for you posted menus.  And it looks like even as recently as June 5th, you had a version of the menu without the front-side ""CASH ONLY"" piece as is displayed on your menu now ( bit.ly/19JuQPd ). My guess is you still have old menus laying around that don't say this.  I appreciate that you are making an effort to state it on the menus now - but your servers should also be pointing this out.",0.9905,0.834,0.106,0.06,0.47657906558849955

2013-07-19,3.0,"I enjoyed Irazu for the most part. I don't think it's great, but considering the rib eye sandwich (Pepito) which was featured on Triple D is only priced at $5.95 ($6.45 w/avocado) it's hard to complain. However, I did find the food to be very salty. The empanadas were ok, nothing to write home about. It's hard to truly critique the Chifrijo, which was their signature appetizer also on Triple D, because we didn't get it with the pork. We got it vegetarian style and it was refreshing, but nothing special. I'm assuming it's better with the pork. My buddies got horchata and I got the oatmeal shake. They said they've had better, but I thought the oatmeal shake was delicious. That alone would make me go back. But be careful, the food is deceptively filling. Between the beans in the chifrijo, the empanadas, the complimentary chips and salsa, and the oatmeal shake I was pretty full before I got my sandwich. After all that I was feeling pretty uncomfortable, and the salt in the food did not help. Almost forgot to mention that it's BYOB and outdoor dining which is a major plus.

Let it be known that I came to Irazu for a change of pace from typical Latin food, not because it was featured on the show. Chifrijo appetizer ($8.50) features delectably crispy fried pork, which blends well with spicy sauce, avocado, and the black bean and rice mixture that it comes with. Easily my highlight of the meal. Pepito sandwich ($5.95) is excellent for the price, although between the cheese, ribeye, beans, and brown Lizano sauce, it is a very rich sandwich. I'd recommend splitting it. Sadly, El Tico entree ($13.50) is a blander take on cuban ropa vieja; the beef is overcooked and too thick, as are the vegetables. This didn't have much going for it. Service is very good, and the closed off patio is very pleasant to dine on when it's nice outside. All in all, Irazu is a welcome departure from the usual Latin fare one finds in Chicago, but it's by no means superlative.

I was like, ""there it goes""! 3) I was volunteering with the red cross and they ordered this for lunch...YESTERDAY! 4) My friend and I needed lunch today, and this popped in my head!

We also ordered 2 of the raved about empanadas. The beef and rice, and the spinach and cheese. Here's where I'm not happy. The stuffing wasn't AMAZING. It was just okay. They were pretty small, for 3.00. However, what is WONDERFUL about those empanadas was the CRUST, the dough, the covering, the protection of the filling. OH MY! There's crack cocaine in that crust!  Our waitress asked us how the empanadas were. I said, they were okay. Pretty unenthusiastically. She said, that doesn't sound convincing. She pushed me, so I was honest. I said, there was something AWESOME about it, and something mediocre about it. She asked, what was mediocre?  I said, the filling. When she brought our bill, she brought me a coupon for 2 free empanadas. I WAS BLOWN!  The food was GREAT The service was GREAT Will I be back?

We demolished it in about 15 seconds. For our main dishes we got the Pepito sandwich and the Tico plate with chicken. The steak on the pepito sandwich was flavorful and the perfect combination withe the onions and avocado. The tico plate was comparable to fajitas. Served with rice beans and plantains, it was delicious. We were so full, but I had heard to much about the oatmeal milkshake that we got it to go.

I am writing this review mostly to brag about the fish and platains.

But their plantains always take me back to ""the country"" in Jamaica (Jamaican know what I'm taking about with that reference). Try the shakes. I LOVE them because they can be made with soy (I'm NOT a milk drinker). So, you can't beat that.  I've never been disappointed by them and once, the delivery guy called me just to tell me that he was on his way ( I thought that was sweet).

2013-03-29,4.0,"Our visit to Irazu could have been a total flop, as three colleagues and myself were visiting Chicago in relation to a project we're working on, and due to someone's scheduling flub we ended up having lunch meetings with two different groups just an hour apart. Unfortunately the second group didn't know this until we were already seated (we thought we were just going for coffee), and we were uniformly bummed out because the menu here was so much more interesting than at the place we had just come from. Had we know we were coming to Irazu, we would have had a much lighter first lunch. Luckily, it all worked out, as most of us ordered one of their (apparently) famous shakes and those who had already eaten shared a variety of tantalizing appetizers such as yucca chips, fried plantains, bread pudding, and of course chips and salsa. This was my first time having Costa Rican food, and I loved how flavorful it was without being too spicy. I do love the hot stuff, but it's great when foods can stand on their own without a ton of chili pepper.  Upon our very friendly server's recommendation, I ordered an oatmeal shake made with soy milk, which turned out to be a great choice. Pretty much everyone at the table ordered something similar, some mixing it up with combinations like oatmeal and chocolate, and everyone was pleased in the end. The only thing I didn't like was that the inside was full up (they accidentally gave our reserved table away to another group who arrived just before us, thinking they were us), so we ended up sitting outside. The 'L' kept roaring by every few minutes, making it difficult to hear one another as we were in a large group. Also, they only take cash.

Whoever came up with the design of the place is a genius!  They made use of the little area they had by creating a dining area in front of the restaurant.  It was covered with wind proof plastic and electric heaters for warmth.  It was pretty comfortable and warm for it being below 20 degrees. My sister and I were excited and wanted to try everything they suggested.  So excuse our fattiness, but we ordered: Appetizers: - Veggie Black Bean Soup: black bean soup with tomatoes.  Only got this dish because my sister wanted some soup, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would.  I enjoyed the difference in the texture from the tomatoes and difference in flavor from the lime. - Empanadas: beef and potatoes, spinach and cheese, and zucchini.  I enjoyed the beef and potatoes the most out of the three.  It had tons of flavor and the beef wasn't dry.  The zucchini empanada was bland and the spinach and cheese had too much cheese.  Enough said.    Drinks: - Oatmeal Milkshake: they offer this with soy, water, or regular milk.  This was hands down one of the best milkshakes I had ever tasted.  The texture of the milkshake was blended to perfection; it wasn't too thick.  It tasted like an oatmeal horchata.  Delicious!! Entrees: - Steak Pepito Sandwich: this sandwich was so yummy.  I appreciated that the french bread it was served on was soft and not hard.  Most french bread sandwiches I have tried are always toasted and way too hard to eat (not my cup of tea.)  I also liked that the steak wasn't overcooked. - Tilapia Casado:  like other people said, you can definitely share this entrée with two people (unless you are super hungry and/or didn't order anything else off the menu.)  It comes with beans, rice, cabbage salad, sweet plantains, and your choice of meat (in our case we got the tilapia.)  I just thought this was ok, the tilapia was too dry for my liking and didn't have much flavor.  Everything else was mediocre, so this dish was nothing to rave about.    Overall, I enjoyed my food and the service here.  Everyone was nice and friendly.  I definitely will be returning just for the oatmeal milkshake.  One tip: bring cash, its cash ONLY.",0.9987,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5190464219875984

We started with the chips, which were good but not great.  Unfortunately, I ate many, many of them anyway.  We also ordered the chifrigo, vegetarian style, and it was good.  I appreciate any time beans are whole and not refried, and the avocado and pico tasted fresh.  I also appreciate any time my husband will acquiesce and order something without pork just for little ol' me. Since I'd had a dream the night before about a fish taco truck, I had those on the brain.  I ordered the tilapia taco platter, which was great, except it arrived with a mountain of onion on top.  It was easy to remove, (I am an anti-onionite) and then what was left was simple and great: tortilla and a decent amount of fish.  The sides were plantains, rice and beans (again, not refried - yay!) and cabbage slaw.  It was a happy plate. Then, in spite of the chilly weather, my hearty companion ordered an oatmeal shake.  He offered me a little and man, was it good.  Really sweet - possibly too sweet - and cinnamony and addictive.  Worth getting cold belly for.  I was surprised to see that some people drink them along with their meal instead of after, but to each his or her own. The other thing to note is that they are cash only.  This is inconvenient for me, as I am from the future and already live in a cashless society, but luckily my husband had some cash.  I believe there is an ATM in the inside-inside if you are in need.

The salsa they serve with the empanadas is good but we ended up using the table salsa and it paired extremely well. The yuca con mojo de ajo sounded good, but the garlic tasted like it was cut up and mixed with oil. I love the flavor of roasted garlic, but raw garlic is pungent and unappetizing. The sandwiches were great and we would probably go back just to order them. We had the milanesa and the pepito. Both were delicious, but you must eat the milanesa once it is served or else it will dry out. The spice mixture used on the milanesa was so good.

I had no idea they even offered this, but for large groups, it is mandatory, and it's terrific.  For $18.50 per person, you get a Chifrijo appetizer (basically pico de gallo with black beans, fried pork and rice) and a salad to start.  The main course is giant bowls of chicken, steak, plantains, gallo pinto and grilled vegetables, which was more than enough for our party of 12.  As if that wasn't enough, dessert is an oatmeal shake for everyone, which tastes an awful lot like horchata and when rum is added, tastes phenomenal.

We ended up with the steak and potato and loved it, everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. For dinner, I had the Pepito Sandwich with hot peppers. NOM. I'm casually obsessed with sandwiches and this one was a dream. How can you go wrong with steak, onions, cheese, that tasty Lizano sauce, and hot peppers?! You can't. You just can't. I can't wait to go back and have this sandwich again. Other members of our party had burritos, the Casado, and other plates of veggies and meat. We all left happy and full. The BYOB component made it a lot of fun, we basically closed down the place (sorry to the waitstaff, thank you for your patience!). Additionally, you can't beat the price point ($20 a person with tip) and no corkage fee. Can't wait to return!",0.981,0.828,0.138,0.033,0.5206349206349207

We figured there would be a wait, so we weren't surprised that we were huddled inside the covered patio. But it was a bit annoying there there were a few empty tables on the patio yet they were not seating anyone there. We waited at least 30 minutes and then were seated inside the restaurant. I couldn't wait to sit down because I was starving, and when I saw the basket of tortilla chips I was psyched. Unfortunately the chips were terrible. They were hard (overcooked I think, not stale) and had no flavor. Because they were in front of me I ate them anyway, but they were not good. Supposedly the chifrijo is their big appetizer so we ordered the large for the 3 of us to split. This was never finished. As a proud member of the clean plate club, it pained me to see unfinished food but it wasn't that great. It's basically a rice salsa with fried pieces of pork. The pork was lost on me because all I tasted was chewy batter and it got stuck in my teeth. For my main I had the steak el tico. It was fine, nothing great. They upsell you on the gallo pinto which was fine but bland. My friend shared her oatmeal shake with the table and it was very tasty and surprisingly sweet, which is not how I would ever describe oatmeal.

We also shared the Chifrijo appetizer, and the pork flavor could have been a bit stronger, though I liked the crunchy texture and it was still plenty tasty and different than any dish I've ever had.  We split an oatmeal shake which was delicious - tasted like oatmeal cookies and milk.

We were seated fairly quickly, considering how packed the place seemed; of course perhaps it wasn't all that quickly but just felt that way since we were enjoying ourselves while waiting!   As a vegetarian, I was amazed at the selection of items I had to choose from.  We ordered the patacones appetizer and tried out a bunch of their empanadas (which included 6 vegetarian ones to choose from).  All very delicious; we didn't even care that we reeked of garlic from the patacones!  I also had the chile relleno entree, which was also delicious and filling.       All the while, we happily enjoyed the craft beers we brought throughout the meal.  It was so much fun, I can't wait to go back and try out more of their menu.  Definitely a good place to go just to chill with friends while enjoying good food.  Just remember, as others have mentioned, that it's CASH ONLY, so come prepared! (I'm only giving them 4 stars for now since I've only been there once.  Once I'm convinced they are consistently a good place to go, I'll revise my rating!)",0.9986,0.659,0.297,0.044,0.6161111111111112

The veggie burrito comes with extra stuff the regular burritos don't, in case you were wondering.  And it's one of the cheapest (if not the cheapest altogether) large plates you can get there. The oatmeal shake with soy is the gf's favorite.  It's kinda like an oatey horchata.  That sounded less strange in my head.  Trust me, it shows up in a lot of reviews bc it's good.

The counter guy explained all of this, apologized profusely, and told us where we could go grab some cash quickly (the McDonald's up the block).

The service:  The waiter knew his stuff.  Was attentive and knowledgeable. 4. THE FOOD:   Appy:  The ceviche was awesome.  It's served with crackers but tasted better with the complementary tortilla chips they give you when you first sit down.   Dinner:  I had the El Tico.  Rib eye steak with red peppers and onions.  The steak was a little on the chewy side but the flavor more than made up for that.  Whatever the heck they cooked the steak and peppers in, I want it in everything.  I believe the Costa RIcan take on rice and beans may be my favorite.  It was light and fluffy and GOOD.

Now to the food.  We tried a variety of items including the Taco Tico's, Casado with Tilapia, Pepito sandwich and Chifrijo.  Every single thing was awesome.  Even the tortilla chips that came with the Chifrijo were great. I am really happy that we had the chance to try their food again and definitely will go back in the future.  The taco tico's were actually our favorite and now we can't get enough of the,  Next time we need to order a couple extra for leftovers.   I now see that my original bad experience was truly just a bad day/moment and not indicative of the typical Irazu experience.  I really have never experienced such great resolution to an issue before and I think the Irazu team should be commended.  I now see why the reviews for this place are so good.  It really is good stuff.  Now I just need to get over to the restaurant to get a fresh shake, cause I still really do want to try one.

2012-07-19,3.0,"Hmm.  Well I wanted to like this place a lot more than I did.  I've driven by it numerous times and when I saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, it was the push I needed to stop in and check it out.  As always, I did my yelp homework before I went in and scoped out some of the most recommended things on the menu.  I went with the soy oatmeal shake, which was, hands down, my favorite thing that we ordered.  My friend had the mango shake, and she liked it a lot.  We shared the chifrijo for an app - also pretty tasty.  The pork was fried crispy and the pico complimented the richness of the pork and the buttery avocado well.   Then things went a bit downhill.  I opted for the potato tacos upon the recommendation of our server. In full disclosure, I don't like mashed potatoes, but I still thought they sounded good, so I went with them.  I don't even think that the mashed potato was the part about the taco I didn't like.  And it's not that I didn't like them.  They were just a little on the bland side (and also pretty heavy).  I went with both the mole and the guac as my sauce.  The mole was decent, if not a little...I don't really know what...I just didn't feel like the spices melded as well as they should in a mole.  The guac was okay though it seemed like my particular portion suffered from a few bad avocados.  My friend's steak (the el tico) was a little on the dry/chewy side.  The flavor was decent but I prefer my steak much more medium rare, so I was glad I didn't get a beef dish.     For $25, our food was fine and I'm glad I tried this place out.  I wouldn't object to returning but I have a lot more eating to do before I'll go out of my way to come back...though I might have to consider it for the oatmeal shake.",0.988,0.794,0.163,0.044,0.6150205761316871

The service on the other hand is terrible.  There was 4 of us sitting together this past Saturday. We were one of the first people in the place, and given the choice we decided to sit out on the patio. We placed our orders and were the only table out on the patio. Soon the patio filled and we noticed that everyone on the full patio was getting their food and we had nothing, the waiter hadn't come over to let us know what was going on for a long time. After about 45 minutes people that were seated after us were done eating and paying their bill, getting up and leaving. Yet, we waited.  When the waiter finally did talk to us he assured us ""only another minute on your food, guys"". About twenty more minutes went by and by this time people that were seated after those that had already paid and left were being fed. The hostess came over and assured us that our food was ""on its way out"". About 10 minutes later our food came and despite not being exactly what we ordered were were nice and too hungry to complain so we just ate what we got.  Our waiter pretty much ignored us as we sat and waited and avoided coming to our table and when our food came he didn't even ask to see how things were until we were nearly done. The hostess then came by and gave us all complimentary half-glasses of lemonade. Too little too late. ""Sorry that your orders took a little bit to come out"". Her understatement and insincere sentiment did not help us.  We arrived at 12:10 pm and left after quickly eating and paying at 1:45.  Food was ok. Not worth that wait.

Again, I stand by my initial sentiment that the veggie burrito isn't 'all that' (or at least no all that it was hyped to be), but I will admit that it's exponentially tastier if you do what I've down on my last few visits with friends and splurge the extra few quarters to add an extra ingredient. Irazu recommends adding plantains (which I generally am not a fan of) and I have to agree. The sweet plantains mixed with the savory everything else... they're really on to something.  Other things you need to make sure you get down on at Irazu: - Famous oatmeal shake, choose chocolate and splurge on the soy, it honestly tastes better than the regular milk.  - BYOB... so cost effective when dining, make sure you take advantage. - That freakin' delicious salad with beets and hearts of palm.

Since I've seen this place packed with a line out the door many times before, I expected service that was used to the Friday night dinner rush, but they just seemed unprepared and chaotic. I came with one other person to meet someone who was already there (I decided to go last minute). Went to go find her ourselves. since the host said they don't seat incomplete parties, but yes, she was sitting in the back waiting at a 2-top (which makes sense since they were originally a party of 2). They said that they couldn't add another chair, so we asked to wait for a table to open up that we could fit at. But they said no, they can't do that (which is kind of weird, right? Even if there is a waiting list!). So, obviously, we decided to go somewhere else.  I stood there while my friend waited to get her check for her drink from her server, but not for long--as I was very rudely asked to not stand by the table (and yes, I understand being busy and stressed out, but no need to be rude to customers).

In a world that forces you to chose between Americaned Mexican food or high end Modern Latin, Irazu offers something different.  It's down home Costa Rican food in a fun atmosphere for very reasonable prices. As others have said, the Oatmeal shake is delicious.  The flavor profile is similar to horchata, so if you like that you'll love the shake.  The empanadas are great, doughy, fried triangles of deliciousness.  They're small and cheap, so try a few as appetizers if you're with a group. We tried the veggie burrito with chorizo (for some reason the staff recommended adding meat to the veggie rather than ordering the meat) and it was great.  The portions are huge, so bring your appetite or a to-go box.  We also tried the Pepito Sandwich, as featured on Diners Drive-ins & Dives.  The flavors infused into the pork were unique and delicious, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great sandwich that's a bit out of the ordinary. My only star deduction was for the fact that the service was a bit slow and distracted.  They were friendly when they came to the table, just kept us waiting a bit too long between trips.  Also, the salsa verde they bring with the chips at the beginning is long on heat and short on savory.  It would be great to add to a sandwich or burrito, but didn't quite fit the bill for chip dipping. Oh--and bring cash and your own beer.  If you're in the mood for a fun, casual meal with some unique flavors, Irazu is a great choice.",0.9855,0.828,0.147,0.025,0.5534876543209877

Thanks guys ------- I was really excited to try Irazu, because I've heard so many great things. The food was good - really good actually, but not excellent - the service wrecked the experience, and unfortunately the meal.  All but one of our meals were cold, as evidently they had been made at different times and brought them out together. That was approximately 45 minutes after we put in a simple order for 4 people. 2 people got the wrong order but were too exhausted and hungry to argue - not that we could get anyone's attention for service. We had to ask for water, ask for our both of our bottles of wine to be opened. Add to that, dirty cups and silverware. SO disappointing. I love casual dining, and the spirit of this place.

2012-05-02,4.0,"Was in Chicago about 2 weeks ago visiting my boyfriend, and on my first night in town, we decided to stop by Irazu for some shakes (some friends insisted we had to try them).  I got the avena (oatmeal) chocolate and my bf got the avena banana.  Believe the hype - both of our shakes were unbelievably delicious, so much that we stopped by again the next day, and again the day after that.  We would have gone the next day too, but they were closed!  If this rating were based only on the avena shake, it would deserve a 5 hands down; i'd give it a 10 if I could.  The customer service is also excellent; the people who work there are so friendly and even recognized us when we stopped by several days in a row.   Since the shakes were so great, we also had dinner here on one of the nights I was in town... the food was good but I'm not dreaming about it or craving it the same way I am with the avena shake :).. I wasn't too impressed with their guacamole, and my burrito was good but not over-the-top good.  Boyfriend got the pepino sandwich, which he loved and I would recommend over the burrito (i had a bite).

A ribeye sandwich with cheese, beans, grilled onions and avocado (extra). It was very good. He bread was chewy. They steak was tender.  The hubs ordered the casado with rib eye. It was a stew like dish with carmelized onions. It was very tender. Served over rice with an over easy egg. Ahhhh. That's the way to my husband's heart. Especially with a take out order to have an egg that had its yolk still runny was a winner. You had him at hello. He broke it over his rice and it complemented his rich casado well. The cabbage slaw was nice and refreshing I break up all the richness.  The Lizano sauce is their green spicy salsa verde. Nice and cool and a bite of spiciness. Delicious with the sandwich.

2012-04-24,5.0,"I'm leaving Chicago and this is the place that I picked to have my going away party at. Not only because my first experience here was so stellar (and it's BYOB), but because Costa Rica, oddly enough, holds a special place in my decision to move out of Chicago so it seemed appropriate to have my goodbye dinner here. I called a couple of weeks in advance to see if they would take a reservation for a large party and thankfully they did. So when we arrived on Saturday night at prime dinner time - there was no wait, yay!! Because we had a party of 11 people, they suggested we go with the prix fixe menu. It wasn't mandatory although they did request either the whole table do it or none of us. We decided to go for it and it was totally worth it. It can be a headache to order when there is a large group and doing a prix fixe made it so easy, so we could get on to the important stuff...talking & drinking!!  For the prix fixe, you start out with a horchata drink. It was good, but most of us didn't really drink much of it because we had wine & rum drinks. The next course is chifrio, which is black beans mixed with pork & veggies. Thankfully they can also make it vegetarian (I don't eat pork). For this black bean lover, it was the perfect appetizer. They also brought out a cabbage salad with beets & cucumber and a really delicious house dressing. Between the salad & the chifrio, it was just enough to wet the appetite while we waited for the main course.  The main course is the casado which is a traditional costa rican family style platter consisting of a protein, veggies, gallo pinto (my all time favorite rice & bean dish EVER) and plantains. We went with the chicken, beef, and vegetarian platters and this is where you get your money's worth - it was so much food! Everything was really good though and we stuffed our faces until our bellies begged us to stop. Finally for desert you can get their famous oatmeal shake or flan. I tried both and had no complaints on either. (Honestly at that point I was stuffed silly and pretty buzzed so I wasn't paying to much attention to desert.) All through dinner, of which I think lasted about 2 hours, our server was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. And when the bill came, it was like $25ish with tax & tip.

2012-04-22,3.0,"OK.  About 15 minutes ago, I was all sorts of ready to write a 2-star review for Irazu. Yes, fans...you heard that right.  2 stars.  And here's why... A dozen of us were looking to check in on the hype surrounding this place, and decided to head on down to Bucktown for Saturday dinner.  Because we're courteous diners, we made a reservation for 7pm.  We were sternly warned;  were we to be late  or not have our entire party present at 7pm on the dot, we would lose our table.   Rules is rules, so we gathered the troops and were there at quarter to 7.   Since we were early, we expected a little bit of a wait.  So we waited....and waited...and waited...and waited... And waited. We waited for nearly an hour.  The hostess told us, oh, about every 20 minutes that our table would be ready soon...she was just waiting for the people there to finish up.  That they had been there for two hours and she expected them to leave any minute.  That she had taken away their plates and water and she expected them to leave any minute...but that, under no circumstances, could she tell them that there was another party that had reserved the table (Heavens!  Imagine turning a table on a busy Saturday night!). Finally...finally...the table cleared.  At this point, totally ravenous with hunger, we sat down.   With the exception of having to ask 3 times for wine glasses (they had run out, apparently) we were served quickly.   The food was delicious!  I had the chicken mixed with rice (spicy) and everything was moist and flavorful.  When the bill arrived, we were slightly surprised that none of the appetizers had be comped as a gesture of goodwill.  It's not the biggest deal, but getting a free guacamole would have cost them nothing and gone a long way towards any one of us wanting to visit Irazu on a weekend again. We all left shaking our heads...""never again"" we vowed.  And I, personally, was composing my Yelp review. Then, just 15 minutes ago, the friend who made the reservation sent me a message.  The manager of Irazu called her personally and apologized for our experience.  He gave her his personal phone number and asked that she call him directly ahead of her next visit. And that's all it took to turn this from a 2 star into a 3 star review.  That's what being in the restaurant business is about.  Restaurant patrons understand that things can get busy and people can get overwhelmed - but when minor inconveniences turn into less minor inconveniences, small courtesies can make all the difference.",0.9651,0.901,0.075,0.025,0.42986915486915495
2012-04-22,3.0,"After I wrote the below review with 1 star, the owner contacted me.    He gave me his personal cell phone number and told me I could call him directly the next time I was going to be at the restaurant.     I won't be trying this restaurant again but I do appreciate the response and have upgraded their rating as customer service was my main complaint. I was EXTREMELY disappointed in my experience at Irazu.     Let's start with the reservation we made for 7pm.    We had a large party of 12 and wanted a reservation at 8pm.    We were told absolutely not for a party that large we needed to be there at 7pm or earlier.   We adjusted our plans to be there at 7pm, then we proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our table.   We weren't seated until 7:45, our original reservation that we wanted at 8pm would have been more appropriate.  Strike 1. When we are finally seated the tables, chairs, & floor around our table were wet, not oh we just wiped the table down so it was clean wet but we dumped a bucket of water on everything and hoped for the best.    We had to use paper napkins to wipe the table down ourselves.   Strike 2. We had a friendly waiter who did a great job trying to service our large party on his own.   He was constantly running around getting us water, wine glasses (which we had to wait for as they were washing some for us to use).   Since when to you have to wait to be served because they are washing dishes?    Foul Ball. Overall, everyone in our party was extremely happy with the food.   We had a variety of food,   Chicken Tico, Skirt Steak, Civi-che, guacamole & chips.   All were very good.  I will say I was disappointed in the Gallo Pinto.   I lived in Costa Rica for 3 months and was excited for some authentic gallo pinto, it was a little dry and not very flavorful.   When it was served it was cold on the top and lukewarm throughout.   The guanabana shake was way too sweet and was most likely made from a syrup.   Overall, the food probably gets 3 stars.    Foul Ball. At the end of the evening when we received our check, we decided to speak with management about our service and long wait time for our table to see if we could get a discount of some sort.    Since we had such a large party we were given an 18% gratuity charge, which the waiter 100% deserved.   Our compensation on a $250 bill was 1 free guacamole & to have the gratuity charge removed.   How is that fair to the waiter?  It wasn't his fault and he did a great job with our table.  Strike 3. The food at the restaurant is good which does explain the long wait times and it being so busy however the service was reprehensible and I would not recommend coming here.      Maybe try take out or delivery but the drive from my neighborhood  isn't worth it.

I would say definitely do delivery or takeout.  It's a very small restaurant, so getting a table takes forever.  And bring cash- no credit cards.

The only reason I bring this up is because, when we walked in here they asked us, ""Are you here because you saw us on Drive-in's, Diners and Dives?""  Now I am starting to understand Johnny T's dislike of Guy!!!  I proudly told them that I had bookmarked them on YELP and today was the day we were cashing in on that note. First thing..bring cash...no credit here...in fact, next time I am going to bring Costa Rican Colon's here to pay...I wonder if they will take it?  If I was paying in Colon's our bill would have been $6,665.09 Colon's...wow that seems expensive and I am going to need a bigger pocket to carry all of that!!!  Maybe I will stick to US dollars...our lunch cost us only 13 bucks and we were stuffed...this place is a great value for the money you pay. Okay on to the food.  I made a huge mistake.  I let the waitress and my wife talk me out of getting a steak burrito.  The waitress said, ""You should get the papito because that is the one that Guy liked!""  And my wife said, ""We can split it and you can have my half of my burrito!""  This all seemed logical until my wife offered me a taste of her burrito and I realized I had made a huge mistake and not ordering the burrito.  Maybe Guy doesn't know what he is talking about.  Also, I never did receive the other half of my wives burrito and I do not blame her for that...I would not share it either.  She did let me take a knife and cut off a sliver. Now do not get me wrong the papito was good but I was expecting a little more.  I also added avocado and hot peppers on there.  I did not feel any burn from my sandwich and noticed there was not a lot of hot peppers on there.  I pointed it out to the waitress and she brought me over a little dish of more.  I dropped those on the sandwich and it definitely fixed what was lacking in my opinion.  My wife also started sneaking a fork into my hot peppers.  Next time we are going to need separate tables.  And if I ever do get this sandwich again I might ask them to cook it medium rare next time.  The waitress never asked how I wanted it cooked and I never thought about telling her until it was too late. My wife got the veggie burrito and are you ready for this...added steak to it.  Is it still considered veggie at that point?  I am not sure but it really tasted good.  One bite and I was hooked and sad at the same time.  I had to go back to my papito...the sandwich not my Dad!  I wish I never had a bite of her burrito.  When I do come back I am getting a whole one all to myself.  I am also going to bring alcohol too.  Yes this place is BYOB with no corkage fee.  Thank you for not ripping off your customers with the stupid corkage fee. Our waitress was also really good too.  Once she had learned that Guy F had not sent us and she had taken our order...I talked about how many reviews on Yelp talked about the Oatmeal Shake...she said that it was crazy because it seems like that is what they are known for.  Minutes later she brought us over a sample of the Oatmeal Shake and said, ""You can not come in here and not try the shake!""  How sweet was that?  I love good service and I also love a business that knows how to make a customer happy.  That type of service and dedication to a customer is what will keep me coming back here again and again!!!  Also the oatmeal shake was really good.  I am not a desert kind of guy but I will order this thing.  You can even get a pitcher of it too.  I wonder what liquor would taste good in here...maybe some rum!  This is where the BYOB comes in handy! I almost forgot about the free chips and tomatillo salsa verde at the start of the meal.  The tomatillo was so yummy and spicy...I started sweating but a good kind of burn.  I also poured this on my papito too.  It was really tasty and one of the better salsas you will find in Chicago!!!  I am going to need a jar of this to take home!!! I really liked the vibe at this place.  The menu was great.  I loved the chalkboard in back with the staffs favorite app and the top ten places to visit in Costa Rica.  I had not idea that there was a little Trip Advisor going on back here. I also must comment on there delivery area.  I think the delivery area here is larger then Costa Rica...no I am not exaggerating this!  They go from Lake Michigan to Pulaski and then from Belmont to 16th Street.  I have not used it but I am crossing my fingers for a huge snowstorm tonight to try it out.  Who am I kidding?  2012 was the warmest winter ever...thanks farmers almanac for getting it wrong!!!

It does not disappoint.  We sat in the surprisingly warm and cozy front patio. Don't let the weather deter you. It was really comfortable. Warm chips and salsa verde were brought out quickly to our table. I love their chips. They have the right thickness. It is hard to find a place that doesn't serve those super thin wimpy chips. These were great. The squeeze bottle of salsa  verde made them even better. In fact, several times I considered just doing salsa shots straight from the bottle. It was that good. They give you little flat plates with the chips. Pouring the salsa onto the plates and attempting to dip in the chips proved difficult. Just pour the salsa right on top of the chip. Much less messy that way. We ordered the Patacones (Double fried green plantains) to start. We opted for the additional black bean puree (an extra $2) and it was totally worth it. It also comes with some garlic oil but it was so overpowering that we didn't use it. The black bean puree is absolutely delicious on top of the patacones. You know, in addition to the salsa verde that I completely doused them with as well.  For the entree I ordered the vegetarian burrito. My boyfriend ordered the chicken burrito. The veggie burrito is delicious though next time I'll ask for extra hot peppers. I had a bite of the chicken from my bf's burrito.

2011-12-01,5.0,"Came here as out-of-towers an on the recommendation of a friend. We asked her for:  simple, unique, cheap and not full of drunk college kids. She and Irazu both delivered.  We were initially hesitant to ride back up from an earlier trip starting the in Loop, but in hindsight it was the best move we made all week.  Irazu is a tiny place. It looks like it could have been a coffee stand at one point except someone figured out they could cover and heat a giant patio out front. It works perfectly but be warned there was a 45 min. wait when we went and, as I'm told, there often is. Once we got there, Irazu's uber-sweet hostess (wanted to be her BFF she was so nice) sent us down a block to the Green Eye, a good little bar. We left our name, traveled down there, noshed some chips and had a brew, then headed back.  We were seated quickly and, despite it being cold and windy, their flame heaters did a fine job of making the enclosed ""patio"" warm. It took us a bit to decide on food, though I knew there was an oatmeal shake in our future no matter what. Honestly, I doubt you could go wrong with anything on the menu. Hell, I'd come back just to try everything on the list. The night we went, my husband opted for a $15 combo that included a sandwich, appetizer and the infamous oatmeal shake. I ordered two tacos. Chips came gratis and we over-indulged in a basket and a half. Our appetizer, Chifrijo, came out first. It was a nice-sized, sharable bowl of hot rice with black beans, diced veggies (think salsa w/o the sauce base), fresh avocado and fried pork pieces layered on top. It also had what I take to be Irazu's special sauce swirled on top. Let it be known I could have eaten JUST this with the chips. God, it was good. Fresh and delicious. The oatmeal shake came out next. This was the only ""wahh?"" part of the meal. The shake rocked but next time I'd ask for it to come last. We wanted to savor it more as a dessert than a drink. It was fantastic though and much like a giant blended rice pudding. No lumps, no whipped cream...nothing weird. Just a bit of allspice and cinnamon swirled in. Entrees: The hubs said a steak sandwich, per his meal deal, was great. I had a bite and while it was a little ""safe"" for me, it was indeed good. I opted for two chicken Taco Ticos. They came rolled (not folded), fried and topped with fresh, shredded cabbage, mayo, a little ketchup and that awesome sauce. Again, maybe it was because we were on vacation, but I've never actually had good cabbage nor have I ever enjoyed mayo-until now. The toppings were a great salty-sweet addition to the tacos though. It worked. Like many here have said, we had leftovers. Lots of leftovers. So, not only is Irazu a place to get fresh food on the cheap, but if you nab an appetizer, chances are you can make a second meal out of it. Sadly, we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room. Since we've gotten back, I've asked to make a four-hour drive to Chicago twice (jokingly, obviously) just to have lunch at Irazu. If it was two hours, we probably would have actually done it, that's how much we liked this place. I've also sent recommendations to two other people in the past month. Give it a shot.

A couple of friends & I were looking for a place to eat for a monthly dinner date.  Since Irazu is relatively close to where one of us works and 2 of us had never been...it was time to check it out.  Being Puerto Rican, I am familiar with Latin Cuisine and am somewhat convinced that it is all fairly similar.  There are definite differences, but the staples are pretty much the same: rice, beans, plantains, and little salads of lettuce & tomatoes.  It is the subtle differences that make me appreciated the different cultures in Latin cuisine...mainly how the proteins are flavored. I had never had Costa Rican food prior to this outing and was very much looking forward to it...not to mention that I was HUNGRY!  I was the 1st to arrive from our party & was promptly greeted & seated as I entered the door.  I was not blown away by the ambiance of the place...a little too hipster trendy for my liking.  Also, you walk right past the open area where the food is being prepped to be seated in the back...I am not a fan of that.  However, the service was prompt & friendly and the complimentary chips were a bonus.  For my entree, I went for the Casado with Chicken...I wanted something authentic.  It really was the way to go.  Good portion, tasty beans & rice, comes with an egg over it; my only complaint would be that the chicken was over salted.  I was not blown away by this place as I was somewhat expecting (it's all the hype!), but I found it was a good place to grab some grub.   Overall, I enjoyed the meal there and will definitely return someday to try more of their food.

For myself, I ordered the casado with steak. The empanadas were gooey and delicious! The tacos were also quite tasty! As was the salsa they brought to the table while we waited- and a bit spicy! The horchata (rice water) was way too sweet for my taste. The casado was huge and very filling. Everything on the plate was done well!

Anyways, we stopped by here after picking up some movies at Odd Obsession and decided to take our night out, in, with a to go order. The place was packed (not unusual for Irazu) but especially busy since the recent renovation with their outdoor patio. We ordered a veggie burrito with a side of gallo pinto, chips and salsa, empanadas and an oatmeal shake to split. Truthfully, the empanadas and the oatmeal shake were the whole reason for coming, we figured we should probably order a real dinner, hence the other stuff, so when we got home and realized our order came sans empanadas, we were a little bummed out. We made a call to explain our empanada-less situation, and the manager let us know that although his delivery drivers had just been sent home from their evening shift, he would see what he could do about sending someone over. A very short time later, the delivery man arrived with our beloved empanadas, AND a bonus order of chips and guac just because. We also received a follow up phone call from the owner/manager checking back to make sure things were right.  We were honestly taken aback by how awesome their customer service is and it's another great reason to keep coming back.

Sadly, I was disappointed.  In a nutshell, it's latin food you can get almost anywhere. The steak sandwich Guy Fieri had on TV is just that - a steak sandwich, nothing out of the ordinary. The food was okay, kinda pricey for the kind of food they serve. There's a much better steak sandwich down the street (Marianao Cafe) and they are way cheaper.  It's a bit confusing because it's supposed to be a Costa Rican restaurant and they serve Mexican tacos, tortas, and bring you mexican chips and salsa when you are seated.  Maybe I just didn't think it was great because I am latin and I am accustomed to this food and theirs is nothing great.

2011-08-17,4.0,"One year later.... I am compelled to write another review for this place. I've been back a few times since I last reviewed Irazu, obviously I like the food a lot, and the milkshake yada yada, same thing as everybody here loves. My experience last Saturday 8/13 was a little different though. There was a block party going on, and the place was packed, I mean slamming! The street was already crowded with youngsters, hipsters, weirdsters, some plastered on the curbside. Irazu was the closest establishment, coupled with the fact that it was BYOB, some people thought it was ok just to park their derrier with a few bottles of wine and drink there all throughout the duration of the party.  My friends and I waited for 2 hours, (we were told about an hour) but we soon realized that the large party tables were not leaving, in fact more of their friends came over, as some left, and they kept on drinking. At that point we decided to split our party to sit at the smaller tables. Which worked out fine. The food was good, and we were glad they were accommodating. I wish we had more time to enjoy our food but they were closing up, and the large obnoxious tables/parties that were there 2 hours before us, were still there drunk and yapping loudly...  Even after the staff turned off a couple of the lights. We got the hint and asked for boxes, proceeded to pay at the front, where we saw the entire staff just waiting right there. I felt bad because I've been in their shoes before, waiting for diners to leave. We thanked them as we paid and left.  Did I mention that the loud obnoxious drunks were still in the dining room? Can u knock off stars for service that is too nice?",0.981,0.791,0.148,0.061,0.45434523809523814

The service was painfully slow.  We had to drink our wine out of giant plastic water glasses.  These giant glasses plus our regular water glasses left no room on our tiny, crowded table.  The spinach and cheese empanadas were mainly just over-fried dough with little filling.  And to re-emphasize....service was slow to non-existent.   The saving grace was my vegetarian burrito which was very, very good, but doesn't quite make up for all the other shortcomings.  We knew it was getting close to closing time, and since getting the attention of any staff there was nearly impossible, we grabbed our waiter midway through our meal to put in an order for the oatmeal shake.  He then informs us that the kitchen is closing and they can't make it.  Seriously??  Is this standard restaurant procedure, because it would have really been nice if our waiter had come by and maybe mentioned the kitchen was closing soon in case we needed anything else-just a thought.  Service really ruined it for me and I can assure you I will not be back.",-0.1446,0.886,0.054,0.06,0.42872377622377617

We sat ourselves on the patio and waited to be waited on, and we waited. After of what seemed like forever, but was only about 15 mins, our order was taken. We waited for our food in the sizzling sun for way longer than expect 25 mins later the food finally came. While eating I went to pick at my boyfriends food, which he had barely touched, and spotted a disgusting hair in it. I was both disgusted and furious. I completely lost my hunger. We again waited for a waiter to make them aware of my dissatisfaction. The waiter noticed me looking around and came over and asked if all was well. I explained to him the situation and took the plate and said he would bring another one. I was so angry and disgusted that after that I wanted nothing but to leave. After the plate was taken and taken off our bill we had 3 different waiters how we liked the food. What was there to like?  What did they mean how do we like our food? We barely got to taste it!

I was so nauseated I didn't know that I could force something into my body. So naturally I did just that.  This place... adorable, Costa Rican, small, cute patio, gets rave reviews, has veggie options and the friendliest staff in Chicago. So we sit down and this tall dude wearing a Pura Vida shirt gives us the run down. His name is Omar btw and he's hands down the friendliest mofo on the planet. He gave me a bunch of suggestions which I promptly rejected in favor of the Gallo Pinto. Then he brought us some of that recommended stuff anyway because he could tell that it was about three minutes past where I should have shuffled off this mortal coil. Justin, our gorgeous server, was super fast, nice, chatty, friendly, happy and I think I mentioned more than mildly attractive about five adjectives ago. Those guys are both dynamite and the food lived up to its rep. The hot crispy chips with green salsa to start, then an oatmeal shake. Not my thing because I'd prefer to avoid those calories in favor of something savory but it's as you would imagine: cold, creamy, cinammon-y and definitely shareable.  The star of the show was the Chifrijto. We didnt even order it -- Omar brought us a bit so that I would know what I was missing. It might have been a subtle ""I told you so"" but I prefer to think it was his way of providing me with enough protein to knock out the hangover. Rich, spicy, chewy, beans, pork-y and in a molcajete.

The only place available to sit was inside, which was actually ok since it was about 88 degrees outside. Here's what was great: I ordered the skirt steak with scallions and my boyfriend ordered the tilapia. The steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection, the fried plantains were perfectly browned, and the coleslaw made a nice tangy addition to the dish. I did not try the tilapia, but my bf enjoyed it very much. Here's what was not so great: As soon as we sat down, a busser asked us if we would like guacamole with some chips. We had not even looked at the menu yet, and we thought it was complementary (like how you get free chips and salsa at some restaurants). Of course it wasn't, and it felt a little like we had been tricked into paying for something we might otherwise not have.

2011-06-08,5.0,"Irazu is #3 on my list of favorite outdoor patio dinner spots in Bucktown (Duchamp is tops closely followed by Big Star). We stopped in for dinner on a Monday night around 8 pm and the place was packed! We were offered a table inside right away, or a 30 min wait for the patio. No worries however, as the host took down our phone number and we strolled over to the Green Eye at Western and Armitage (hiding just below the Armintage blue line station) for a beer on their tiny outdoor patio while we waited.  We got our call in less than 20 min and hurried back to grab our table, making sure to stop by Red & White on the way to grab a chilled bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, since of course Irazu is BYO.  I was in the mood for the chicken burrito, which was delish and you must, must get avocado added to it. I liked how they grilled the burrito after it was rolled making the tortilla toasty! My wife got the tacos, which you must order at least two since they are a bit smaller and served on standard corn tortilla rolls, but at $2 a pop, they might not be as tasty as Big Star, but a great, great value. Irazu is just a fabulous place to have a great, inexpensive meal in Bucktown. Outside patio + BYO + great food. Does it get any better?",0.9912,0.809,0.166,0.025,0.4261599511599512

I've consistently order nothing but tacos from this place, and its been consistent, quality-wise. My verdict is pending other items I need to try, but at least for delivery, they are very good - SeamlessWeb does well, albeit expensive ($-ouch), and direct delivery is greeted by a pleasant lady who took my order, and delivery regardless of ordering method was good too.

When they called us after an hour of waiting, we were being led to an outdoor table, anyway. Thanks? We took our losses & sat down... only to see a large table inside (well, in the tented, heated area anyway) that was empty and was being reserved for a group..despite the ""no reservations"" policy. Awesome. Service: The service was slow, as usual, but usually the waitstaff is pretty cool. The waitress we had was a complete mess and rude. I understand, it's busy and can be hectic for you, but there's no excuse to be rude to a table that doesn't give you attitude. We got chips, but  no salsa. We got the Chijifrito (amazingly delicious, btw) but no individual plates to start eating. We got our main course, but no utensils to eat. And when we requested carryout boxes, the waitress came back, scowled, then smacked my friend with the box to get her attention. Food: A friend of mine disliked the burrito, the Chicharron tastes amazing but is heavy and can probably give you a heart attack on the spot, and the Pepito was said to be pretty good. Cost: Our bill showed we were overcharged on items where we did not order extras. We were tired of sitting in the cold, so we tossed our cash on the table and booked it out of there.

2011-03-25,4.0,"Irazu is especially great during the summer when you can sit in the open-air patio. They don't have a ton of inside seating, so it can get crowded quickly! I used to get the veggie burrito (without cheese or sour cream to make it vegan, plus the optional mushrooms and spinach) cuz I just like it so much. They note on their menu that the veggie taco is great for vegans as well. Lately though, I've been ordering the potato tacos for delivery and in the restaurant. It comes with enough food for a couple meals: three mashed-potato-stuffed crispy tacos, vinegary cabbage salad with beets, radishes and cucumber, yellow rice, refried beans, maduros (ripe plantains) and your choice of guacamole or mole. The mole isn't vegetarian though, so get the guac! I have yet to try the Vegetarian Plate, though it would be another vegan option. FYI, the empanadas on the menu aren't vegan either; they have some egg in the dough. This last time in the restaurant the patacones (tostones, or fried  green plantains) were a bit overdone, so they weren't as tasty as usual. But I must say, the garlic and oil ""mojo"" is so addicting and makes everything taste good. I shamefully admit I haven't ordered a shake in a while, but they are delicious and they do have soy milk as an option. Mango was my preferred flavour. I had one bad experience with a delivery over a year ago - the delivery person said they didn't have change for my $20 so I had to give him a $10 tip! But I haven't had any problems with recent orders through GrubHub. Service was a little unusual at this recent visit. The server would ask us if we needed anything, but then he'd turn around and walk away before we could say anything. In the end, we got everything we needed though!

This time of year we have events a couple times a week, and I am so freaking sick of every single chain caterer we were ordering from. I whined to the person in charge of catering, ""can we PLEASE try something new?"" Her response was: ""Restaurant X has the cheapest catering around. If you find something better and cheaper, then yes."" In the words of the great Barney Stinson... CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. Enter Irazu. I showed her the menu. Showed her the prices. Somehow, I convinced her to try them out for a smaller event. And Irazu passed with flying colors. Everyone loved it. The food was delicious and we had plenty to go around. My boss loved the prices. They delivered on time. Set up was easy. They gave us actual silverware to use for serving (that I am determined to return to them, because, really?). And I think everyone agreed that we love supporting a local business over Corporate Caterers R Us. My coworker told me that the man at Irazu she's been working with has been a dream. After we used them a second time, I happened to be standing at her desk when he called to make sure everything went smoothly for us. Gotta love the follow up.

We had an excellent meal, starting with some chips and hot sauce.  We ordered up some guacamole and chips and it was some of the best I have ever had.   I had the Casado with the rib eye steak and it was amazing.  The steak was seasoned perfectly, the seasoned rice was out of this world, the plantains brought a nice bit of sweetness to accentuate the spiciness of the food.  The over easy egg over the rice was a nice choice, as I agree with Anthony Bourdain that a runny egg makes just about everything better.

Kind of rice-pudding flavor, but oatmeal. Maybe suitable for breakfast, but as a dessert too....oatmealish...and along with a meal, again, too oatmealish.

I had high hopes of milanesas thanks to Cemitas Puebla, but Irazu's was like a squishy steak parmesan (its topped with tomato sauce and Chihuahua cheese, MEH)  Irazu, I'm willing to give you another chance.

2010-12-04,5.0,"Irazu is just is one of the best restaurants in this city. The food is hot, green, fresh, zesty, flawless. Never skimping on the fillings, sides, or sauces where others hold back - whether with the garlic, avocado, peppers, or black beans - the offerings taste as fresh as they are generous in portion. It is easy to leave here in danger of being overfull.      Besides the food, Irazu just kills in the other categories: price, atmosphere, service. Food is more important than all these things, but price is a constraint you cannot tune out like the other two, and Irazu, for the portions, is pretty much as good a deal for great food as you can find outside of Hot Doug's or your favorite place for fried rice. The burritos are just immense, the patacones are plentifully plated, the shakes tall. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that given the quality and quantity that they could double the price on half their items without losing many customers. Especially in Wicker Park. The biggest money saver, however, may be that it is BYOB and located across the street from a high-end boutique of beer, wine and spirits, which is an awesome convenience.  The service is so warm you either wonder how someone can be so exuberant at work or feel ashamed for complaining so much at/about your own job. If they don't remember who you are by face - and I think they do - they do an amazing job pretending, and in sincerely treating returning customers like friends.  If I ever get in a debate as to whether a cheap eat can match fine dining, I bring up Irazu. Most times that I get some delicious $30-plus entrée elsewhere I still say to myself ""Irazu's spinach burrito is as good.""  Sitting outside in the summer is a perfect way to start your night. In the winter, you may opt for their delivery service, which goes from Des Moines to Memphis. Actually, I think Pulaski to the lake and Roosevelt to Montrose. How that's profitable, I have no idea.

It is similar to a potato, here they either fry it in garlic or boil it and either way I can never get enough of it. 3.

My server Chris was really laidback and nice. I also talked to another server named Mandy who was very friendly and sweet. I had been her server the night before at 90 Miles (holla!) and we talked about the similarities and differences of Cuban and Costa Rican food.  Anyway, back to the food...the oatmeal shake was all I hoped it would be and more. It had canela sprinkled on top and the texture and taste were just outstanding. Next came my taco tico, served with a heaping portion of cabbage and traditional salsa lizano. I usually don't dig cabbage, but let me tell you, I gobbled every last bit of it up at Irazu. It complemented the taco really well and was very light and refreshing.  I look forward to my next time at Irazu!",0.945,0.861,0.117,0.022,0.5357936507936508

My boo and I also split a spinach cheese empanada which was a-mazing! The last time I had a empanada was at Tango Sur, where I was highly disappointed. This empanada was 10 x better than Tango Sur. The outside dough was crispy and thin and the spinach and cheese was perfectly melted and oozed out into my mouth with every bite. We also had the chicken sandwich and a breaded steak sandwich, we added hot peppers to both. The bread they used was a hearty french bread (I think).

I would definitely recommend the Casado plate (grilled choice of meat accompanied with various sides) It's a huge portion and a real steal for under $13. It seriously lasted me two meals. I also would definitely recommend the Chicharron plate. It's very comparable to fried lechon. But unlike many variations I had, the meat actually remained moist and succulent and still had a very nice crunch! Gallo Pinto (their rice and beans) are on point. And who doesn't love fried plantains? I've also had the ceviche here, and it's among the better ceviches I've had in the city. Good citrus, but sometimes an additional dash of salt really wakes up the dish. Dining is enjoyable, they have a lot of outdoor seating and indoor. The waitstaff is very friendly. My only problem would be the cash only policy. But that's minor.",0.9895,0.674,0.239,0.087,0.5393488455988454
2010-07-11,5.0,"It took me a long time to finally try Irazu considering several of my friends would rave about it.  I finally went there one day after work to meet a friend and loved it.  A few months ago my mother wanted food and we were driving by when she said ""how about there?"" and I immediately pulled over.  Don't have to ask me twice!   I don't even remember everything I've tried from there, but oh man, the food is so good.  The last time I went I asked one of the guys behind the counter what dishes he might recommend, but more importantly, which empandas he thought were the best.  There are quite a few, and I probably should have written this review a lot sooner than I am, but oh man, those empanadas were delicious.  I believe one of them was spinach and something.  All I can say it, that guy didn't lie!  I believe one of the things he recommended was the veggie burrito, but the best part was ""I'm not gonna lie, the veggie (insert actual food item here) is delicious.  Seriously, for veggies....yeah.""   I really like the sandwiches from here, but the best thing is definitely the Oatmeal shake!  Everyone I know that's been here doesn't have a bad thing to say.   The food is flavorful, quick and attentive service and the patio is perfect for those really nice days.",0.997,0.729,0.256,0.015,0.5653846153846153
2010-07-10,5.0,"This place lives up to the hype. Two of my friends and I came here for some veggie burrito action. We were not disappointed. We also split three empanadas - one black bean, one spinach and cheese, and the last sweet plantains - and they were each very flavorful. I think the spinach and cheese really surprised me, and the sweet plantain empanada was almost like a dessert empanada.  The veggie burrito is huge - I think it was the size of the plate it came on. Packed with rice, lettuce, black beans, avocado, tomato, onions, cheese, and hot peppers, it's a lot of food compared to the price ($4.95 I believe?). Also, the beans here taste so good. I don't know what they do to the beans, but the beans just melt in your mouth.  Of course, we got oatmeal shakes to top it all off. We were drinking beers (this place is BYOB) on top of the shakes so we all left the restaurant in a major food coma. I think we'd all do it again anyway. It just feels so good when you know that the food you are getting is fresh and top quality. It also helped that we went during a crazy 10 minute monsoon/hail period, so everyone was in fun spirits. Our server was a great guy. I really enjoyed the atmosphere here, and the food was excellent.

I did have something called ""Lava Juice"" which was a watermellon/lime juice concoction. It was a really hot day and I could've had a whole pitcher of that. So refreshing and wonderful.  I was a little disappointed with my meal. It was just ""eh"" (shrug shoulders).  My friend (who is costa rican) got something delicious though... it was some sort of dish with green plantains, fried and served with dipping sauces (one was some kind of garlic spread). Those were delish.  My advice: pick a sunny day, grab some sunglasses, sit on the patio, get some lava juice and some of their appetizers and enjoy. The meals are unremarkable.

I found the menu to be slightly overwhelming as everything looked good. I finally made up my mind and went with the veggie burrito. And boy am I glad that I did! This is unlike any burrito I've ever had. They take the veggie part of the name very seriously. It is stuffed to the max with veggies and isn't overpowered by rice and bean fillers. My friend tried a bite and said she couldn't even identify all of the flavors that are in it. I tried a bite of her cheese and spinach empanadas and thought I had tasted a little bit of heaven. Per our waiter's suggestion we finished off our meal with an oatmeal shake. When I first heard about this, I was just as grossed out by it as you probably are right now. Well, let me tell you...it is not gross at all. It is most definitely everything it is cracked up to be. Imagine an oatmeal cookie in milkshake form and then I think you'll get the picture. We got oatmeal banana which I would highly recommend.

2010-07-02,4.0,"On a beautiful Chicago Monday evening, 7 fabulous ladies pulled up some patio to celebrate a birthday. The DJ was crankin' some tunes, the breeze was perfection, and our BYOB beverages were on ice. Now that I've set the scene, let's dive in to the most important part - the food.  For apps we went with the tostones with mojo, guacamole, and an order of the chifrijo. I have never met a tostone that I didn't like and this was no exception. The mojo was divine and I wanted to put the leftovers in my purse but these broads kept asking me for it. Haters. I loved the guacamole here - probably because it was easy on the cilantro (whew!) and had some type of spicy stuff on the side that was similar to nopales. The chifrijo was crazy good! It was pretty much the gallo pinto (white rice, black beans) with sauteed veggies and chicharones. I mean really, you can't go wrong with chicharones in any form. I kind of wish I had ordered a bowl of this for my meal. That good.  Most of us ended up ordering either a sandwich or empanadas for dinner. I did three empanadas; meat and potato, cheese, and spinach and cheese. The cheese only one was a bit bland, but with the help of a little salsa verde, it perked right up. The other two were delish as is. I also got a side of the gallo pinto because, ya know, how do you go to a Costa Rican joint and not get rice and beans? I can't personally vouch for the others grub, but the yum sounds could be heard around the table. Oh, I did sample the sweet plantains and there were great. Super soft, nice and caramelized, perfect.  A couple of the gals tried the famous oatmeal shake and it lived up to the hype. Even the soy based one. Honestly, I couldn't tell the difference between the soy and milk ones. So yummy.  My only gripe about this place was the service. We never got any small plates to divvy up the appetizers with. Our waiter spaced out on drink orders a couple of times. We had to flag him down a few times. Overall though, no biggie. We were there for a leisurely dinner so it was nice that we weren't rushed, even though there was quite the wait building up. Also - he was kind enough to snap some group shots for us on not one, not two, but three different cameras. And he was easy on the eyes so all is forgiven.

2010-04-21,5.0,"For those yelpers that like to skim like me, I'll take out the reading part and just give you the highlights upfront: decent priced food, great patio seating, ceviche made without shellfish, BYOB with a super cute wine/beer store across the street, easy street parking.  Only downfall is that I never have enough room for their infamous oatmeal shakes. For the real review.... Somehow this place gets better every time.  Only draw back is that too many people know about it and there is usually a wait.  But, there is a lot more extra seating in the warm months when they can open their patio.   My mom somehow read about this place and told me to try it a couple years ago.  Went with a couple of friends  year or so back and liked the food.  We were all too full to try the oatmeal shake, so I kept Irazu on the radar to go back.  Time passes, and I actually tried to go twice this winter but the wait was an hour and I was starving, so we had to venture elsewhere. Went last week , and this last experience was pure joy.  Maybe it was the nice weather.  Maybe it was the tasty Costa Rican beer I was drinking.  Or maybe it felt like the perfect way to start a four day weekend.  Regardless, it was great, and I feel like I've told every single person I talked to since last week that they should go there. Walk up and there was a wait, but it was a gorgeous spring evening so it wasn't that bad.  It was sorta a last minute decision for our dinner spot, so we had no liquor, and were directed across the street to Red and White Wines (awesome place, check it out!).  Picked up a six pack of Costa Rican beer and we were able to open them up while we waited. We were seated and had a bit of a hard time reading the menu, as it was pretty dimly lit on the patio.  But I immediately noticed ceviche made with white fish and knew we had to order it (BF is allergic to shellfish so ceviche is usually out for us).  Bus boy came and brought us water and took our appetizer order (yay for quick service!).  Out comes DELICIOUS ceviche with some chopped tomatoes and minced jalapenos on top with saltines.  I'm not a ceviche connoisseur, but this stuff was great.  Service was perfectly timed - the app was removed, we were able to enjoy the rest of our beers, and the entrees came out.  I ordered a vegetarian burrito with grilled zucchini - I can never turn down zucchini and the BF ordered some roasted chicken platter that is new to the menu.  Both were sooo good and we overstuffed ourselves.  I almost wished we hadn't been drinking our tasty beer so my stomach had more room in it. Sadly, I had to leave another time without trying the oatmeal shake.  But I will definitely be back.  Probably with one of the many friends that I've been convincing have to give this place a try. Lastly, street parking is plentiful so even if you don't live close, you can easily get here.  Also right off the blue line western stop for those of you like me who are car-less.",0.9981,0.793,0.171,0.036,0.5109716568671793

Um, esc-a-yusa-me?), I settled upon the egg sandwich. It was a solid choice. It was an egg omelet served on crunchy bread with black beans, avocado, cheese, onions, and lizano sauce (think pepper & cumin but a little sweet). It was wholly satisfying. To drink, I slurped down my own (you know how this story goes by now) oatmeal shake. It came in a big cup and topped with cinnamon.

For having such great customer service, I decided to update my review and give them 2 stars (I originally gave them one). One thing that I think is very important for any business is to have an excellent relationship with your consumer and to listen to them. I think I will try Irazu again.....maybe they were just having an off night. After all, most of their reviews on here are great! Thank you, Irazu! ________________________________________________ We ordered Irazu through Grubhub a couple nights ago and I was very disappointed. I'd have to say the best thing about my meal was the plantains that came with the dinner.  I've been thinking about giving up red meat for weeks now and after having the Bistec Tico, my decision was so much easier. The beef was very chewy and bland. I feel like the meat was probably sitting in their freezer for weeks...was not fresh at all! It made me feel nauseas after eating it. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich and they didn't get that right either! He did like the Chifrijo, it really wasn't my thing. I don't think I'd ever order from here again. But maybe it's different dining in.",0.9923,0.808,0.174,0.018,0.5520975056689343

I also noticed that their delivery range is extremely huge when I was there last night.  They apparently deliver all the way from Irving park to Roosevelt, and from the lake to Pulaski.  WOW.    You have no excuse not to eat this food!  Call them! edit: the owner sent me a message to point out that their delivery range extends all the way up to Montrose now.  Luckily I live close enough to get carry-out, but that's impressive!",0.9934,0.693,0.261,0.046,0.5797101449275364

I came here last night to celebrate, and even though the place was small.. we were seated right away, although it was rather crowded for a weeknight when we left. Anyway, back to the food. I've never had Costa Rican food before but to me it seemed like somewhere a mix of mexican, carribean, and peruvian. In other words, aMAzING!  I was really going back and forth b/t the award winning veggie burrito and the casado. And yes I went with the meat.. I can't help myself. The steak casado came with sweet plaintains (ah delicious), flavorful thin rib eye steak pieces topped with grilled onions, and a side chopped cabbage salad with beets, radishes, cucumber etc.  We upgraded to the Costa Rican rice (TOTALLY WORTH IT! only a dollar or so) as opposed to plain white rice. The rice was kinda like a flavored ""dirty rice"" with spices, black beans, and loads of savory zing. And we got  free oatmeal shakes (with soy~)  for the table (apparently its like 1 free oatmeal shake per 25 dollar purchase if you are a yelper). So we just shared 2 among the group. And I was so curious when I read about this famous oatmeal shake on yelp. It has a slightly sweet cinnamon flavor, and basically tasted like a horchata smoothie/milkshake!  It was around 12-15 dollars for an entree, and around like 5 bucks for a burrito. All the entrees are huge portions, so definitely will have leftovers for the next day :) Will have to go back to try the empanadas and veggie burrito!

The steak fries are amazing, crispy but soft and just the perfect amount of flavor, a wonderful companion to any of their dinner options as well as their sandwiches...oohhh the sandwiches! I ordered the pepito sandwich with avocado: ribeye steak, carmelized onions, peppers, beans on white bread -- it was so tasty I didn't even mind it being served on white bread. I also tasted the milanesa, and though it was good, I much prefer the pepito. Everything you order here, even the guacamole with chips -- can be made spicy upon request.

The chips came with 2 kinds of salsa and both were pretty spicy. I loved it. Most places I go, I have had to learn to accept that the salsa is not going to be spicy enough to my liking.

The place is really small on the inside and probably has 4 high boys and maybe 6 tables. There were surprisingly two big groups in there of 8 people in each and they seemed to be seated pretty comfortably. This place is BYOB so we brought wine with us (there is a corkage fee), but next time we go it will definitely be some kind of Mexican beer. Our waitress was great! She is the daughter of the owner and has been working there since the place opened 20 years ago. Since we had never had Costa Rican cuisine, she gave us ideas of what to get. We started off with the guacamole (asked for it spicy) to go along with our chips and salsa. The chips are different than you eat at other restaurants, but they were really good. They give you two types of salsas at the table a red and a verde (very spicy). The guac was great, but it was not chunky like fresh guac. For dinner, I had the Pepeto sandwich, which is steak with peppers, onions, muenster cheese and their terizo sauce. I also asked for avocados on top. The sandwich was really good, but would have been much better if they served it as opened-face with the cheese being the top layer because the bread was too much. My wife got their special that night of spinach and peppers. I have no idea how they cooked it or what else was in it, but I can best describe it to you as cooked, spinach, peppers and tomatoes cooked together in a tasy sauce and served with rice, beans and fried plantains. It was so delicious! We were pretty stuffed by the end, but we knew we had to try the oatmeal shake. We got it with the soy milk and it tasted exactly like rice pudding to me.

I'll start with its one negative - its small and there's little room to wait, which we didn't encounter but could imagine on a busy winter night wouldn't be fun.... that's where the unpleasantness ends. The decor, atmosphere, and food are all a nice slice of Costa Rica - which lives by the code ""Pura Vida"" or pure life. Irazu gets that right by having a fun atmosphere and attentive staff who you can tell like working there and interacting with customers. FOOD: I had the chicken casado. The casado is the typical meal of Costa Rica - marinated meat and veggies, gallo pinto (rice and beans) an egg on top of the rice and gooey fried plaintains. So good all around. I've visited Costa Rica and I loved the American quality of the meat here with the authentic tastes of CR. Top all that off with the famous Oatmeal milkshake. Its as good as advertised - get one yourself and you'll know what I'm talking about. It was several months between my two visits to Irazu - I'm pretty sure it won't be that long before my next visit.",0.9888,0.825,0.164,0.01,0.5163308913308914

2009-12-07,5.0,"Howwww have I not reviewed this place yet?!? I'll get to the point, since I'm sure others have said it all: - GREAT veggie burritos and tacos. Half a burrito or two tacos are more than enough food for one person. I always ask for my hot peppers on the side, though, as they can overpower the taste of the whole thing. I'm usually a huge fan of hot peppers, but theirs are different than what I'm used to. They're kinda growing on me, though. - The oatmeal shakes are a must in the summer. A must. I like mine just plain, but the oatmeal-banana one is also great. My boyfriend had a non-oatmeal mango smoothie once that was also really good. They are HUGE (if you get them in the take out container) and very filling (duh, it's oatmeal) so I would reccomend splitting one with another person. - I was kinda drunk when I had my first actual dinner here (love that no corking fee), but I do remember being astounded by how much colorful, flavorful food was piled onto my plate. I loved the cabbage salad that the tilapia tacos came with. It was a little tart and super refreshing. I'd always get it as a side if I could! *hint hint, guys?*  - Very attentive, hospitable and unpretentious wait staff that makes you feel like your business is truly appreciated. I come here alot. I always leave happy. Also, despite the fact that the wait can be long, they have a HUGE bench out front that you can hang out and pregame on while waiting to be seated.

2009-12-06,4.0,"Scientists recently uncovered a find for the ages. The First Mate's log of the final voyage of the S.S. Veggie Supper Club from October 14 (or 20, who's counting) 09. Here are some of the excerpts that would be interesting to modern audiences:  ---  DAY ONE: Travelling deep into the heart of ""Costa Rica"" we have come to the village of Irazu. It might seem close to home to many of the crew, just off the Western Blue Line port on Milwaukee Avenue, but it is a different world. The natives are friendly, accommodating our motley, rain drenched, crew of about a dozen at a table near the back of the village for their traditional meal - I believe it is called ""dinner.""  DAY TWO: There are so many interesting variations of other Panamerican cuisine here in this village, I have had a tough time deciding what to eat. The menu contains such familiar things as tacos and burritos, but all with a Central American twist. Thankfully we have a local guide, Omar, who is genial (also somewhat funny and very informative) and willing to explain to us the complex local flavors. We have decided to sample the ""empanadas"" (of which they will serve in increment's of three, five, or seven - the last one perfect for sharing, though expensive at $12) to begin with and I have found them a range from delightful (cheese) to ""interesting"" (plantain - could have been sweeter).  There are many varieties of these local treasures ranging from sweets to meats. DAY THREE: If I didn't know better, I would swear that the natives are in cahoots with Omar to fatten us up and put us on the menu (maybe that's just the b.y.o.b. talking). They are shoveling complementary chips and local salsa and pico de gallo like substances at us. There is nothing especially spicy but they will make these as mild or hot as you want.  DAY FOUR: I feel like I've been hit with a tranquilizer dart after trying to eat the main course. The potato taco is a herbivore's delight (flavorful and filling - which by this point is a given) - though they also specialize in many fish dishes and sandwiches. It comes with huge sides of rice, beans, and a cabbage salad. Some of the natives have ""messed up"" some of our orders but Omar has corrected these mistakes quickly and perfectly (and with minimal whipping of his villagemates).  DAY FIVE: We have begged our leave of Omar. He offers us another full sized meal called ""desert"" but I feel as though I may not be able to leave the village if I consume this. Perhaps I will come back again or have them deliver. They will send a food-bearing vessel to pretty much anywhere on the north side of Chicago - including downtown.  ---  Legend has it that on that final rain soaked night, the crew of the S.S. Veggie Supper Club left the port of Irazu and was never seen again due to being ""drunk"" on happiness, food, and conversation. Or there may have been a mutiny (though after Irazu it definitely wasn't due to cannibalism, that's for sure). This final fate, unfortunately or not, was lost to time.",0.9968,0.83,0.137,0.033,0.5016754850088184

Sorry friends Shrimp, rice and veggie dish from the ""special menu""- there's a reason they call it special...it was darn good Chicken Tico- eh. The only thing I didn't like. It took 5 billion years to come and I think the reason may be that they ran out real fast to buy a chicken. My friends commented that they've loved this in the past, but were not fans this time. Fortunately, we were pretty full from the rest of the meal and didn't need the chicken Lucky yelpers these days can score a free oatmeal shake for the table by just mentioning Yelp. Yay! My friends and I split the best shake EVER (seriously) and I found myself wanting a big one for myself even though I was full enough to feel like I had just devoured Thanksgiving dinner.   It had been a few years since my last visit to Irazu, but I'm going to be knocking on their door daily for one of those oatmeal shakes.

After living in the midwest for over three years, I have finally found a Latin American restaurant that comes close to the authentic food I grew up eating.  A friend of mine and I asked someone we met at the Bucktown Art Festival where we should eat our next meal in Chicago, and she suggested Irazu.  ""Really good, quick, and authentic"" is what she said. And boy was she right. We walked into the incredibly busy restaurant on a Saturday night, starved and ready for some deliciousness. I ordered the special of tilapia tacos, which came loaded with rice, beans and plantains.  We also ordered chips and salsa, and chicken ticos.  The beans were just like my mother makes them -- cooked down for hours, and flavored with plenty of onions and salt.  My tilapia tacos were messy and simply flavored with grilled onions and cilantro.  The tilapia was fresh and cooked to perfection.  I have to say I was surprised, too, since they were so jammed with to-go orders and in-house diners.  Service was funny and friendly despite the craziness inside. The guys behind the counter let us try their special drinks on the house, which were sweet and surprisingly tasty (I'm not a sweet drink fan traditionally).  Next time, I will definitely order one.   If I lived in Chicago, Irazu would be a staple.  As it is, I will be convincing my Chicago friends that we'll need to visit this hole-in-the-wall next time we're visiting.  Everytime ""Chicago"" is mentioned in our house, ""Irazu"" shortly follows, and my husband is on the verge of making a special trip out to Chicago just to try this place.

I've also tried the delicious potato tacos and the incredible yuca with mojo (garlic oil). Yum. My girlfriend has ordered the veggie burrito with mushrooms both times and loved them and my roommate has enjoyed steak burritos and meat-filled empanadas.  The only thing we haven't loved was a blackberry shake, but I think that's a personal thing. My only other complaint is that pricing is a little strange. Some things are super inexpensive (7 empanadas for $12? That's 2 meals! Burritos as big a house for $5? Sweet!) while others are above average for the city ($10 for 3 potato tacos).

To start, we noshed on chips and salsas and complimentary black beans with pico de gallo. I also had some empanadas - black bean, plantain, and spinach and cheese; the spinach was by far the best of the three, but they were all tasty.  I had planned to order Tuna Mixed with Rice, reminiscent of a dish I got in Costa Rica. Unfortunately, per Omar, our fabulous server, it wasn't made with seared, fresh tuna as I had hoped, but canned tuna so I passed and got the veggie burrito instead. When three veggie burritos, three different ways came to the table confusedly Omar was quick to take them back to the kitchen and sort out which one was which. My burrito was good, but not exceptional or award winning as the menu states. I wouldn't come back for that specifically, but I would come back to try some other menu items. My pre-dinner snacking only allowed me to finish half of the huge burrito, but the rest made a nice lunch the next day.  This place is BYOB and cash only, but they have an ATM in front. There are also a few liquor stores close by on Milwaukee in case you need to get something on the fly. The place is small, it will be hit or miss if you're dining in parties of more than 4.  Bottom line: I'd give the food 3.5 stars, but the enthusiastic, attentive and friendly service from Omar kicks it up to 4.

Your kitchen did wonders with the mix of black beans, rice, avocado, cheese, mushrooms & hot peppers.  I only managed to make it through half my burrito. Perhaps it was the abundance of chips and salsa on the table, or the bean dip that Omar had us sample. Or more likely, it was the large creamy oatmeal shake that I greedily downed with my meal.

Despite the fact that I was probably full enough at that point, I still had a veggie burrito on the way. Stuffed with extra mushrooms and zucchini, it was one of the best burritos I've ever tasted.

2009-09-29,4.0,"I've eaten at Irazu twice now, once outside on the patio and once for take out.  My man took me on a date to Irazu at the end of the summer when we could still sit outside. The patio was packed and we waited for a table for about 15 minutes and then once we were seated, waited another 15 for a server to speak to us. Normally I would have had a hissy fit and demanded free food but the atmosphere at this place was chill and instead I enjoyed the weather and our bottle of BYOB two buck chuck. Also, when the server finally greeted us, I could tell he felt really bad and actually really cared about our service so I let it slide. We ordered a bean/pork dip (or something like that) with chips for an appetizer. I usually don't like pork but let me tell you, this was phenomenal. I had to stop myself from ruining my appetite for my main meal. Next I ordered the garlic shrimp with vegetables. The shrimp, although small, were very tasty, the veggies were great, and the beans, rice and plantain sides were a perfect combination to complete the dish. Lots of food for not a lot of money. So other than the really slow service, this place was great and a must-visit if you are in Chicago and want some authentic Costa Rican food and flare.  My second visit was for take out. I ordered a salad with cabbage, beets, avocado, some other veggies, and chicken and my bf ordered a steak burrito. Again, the wait was ridiculous and we waited in the tiny waiting space for almost a half hour. I left the restaurant really annoyed with the place but once I ate my salad, I forgave Irazu. The salad was HUGE and was plenty for dinner and lunch the next day. It was really really tasty too, the beets were a must. I also tried the steak burrito and although it was also really good, it didn't beat the steak burrito at La Pasadita down the street.  So all in all, I give this place 3 1/2 stars but rounded up because of the great atmosphere, nice people, low prices, BYOB option, and really tasty food. I took away a star for the long wait, period. Best bet is to order ahead for pick up and if you eat in, bring lots of wine to get you through the wait.",0.9937,0.805,0.147,0.048,0.47452574525745256

For my entree I ordered the steak tica, which came with steak, onions, peppers, tomatos, plantains, rice and beans and cabbage salad.

The rest of the crew arrived and we pondered the menu. Two of my friends did their study abroad in Costa Rica so they were loving the experience and couldn't wait to have a culinary trip down memory lane. I just wanted to make sure I ordered something that would be tasty. After asking our server for suggestions, since two of my friends ordered the Casado, I opted for the grilled steak and a side of the gallo pinto. Boy was it good. The steak was *slightly* oversalted, but overall magically delicious and perfectly cooked. It was served with two stalks of chargrilled green onions, and the side of what seemed to be a mixture of black beans and white rice, sweet fried plantains and a cabbage salad. The whole plate reminded me of other caribbean food (like Jamaican and Trini) but with a decidedly latin slant. With generous portions, BYOB and tasty food, I'll definitely be back.

I had the arroz con pollo (chicken with rice) and I thought it was great, just like it was in Costa Rica.  There is a spicy version with jalapenos which I did not get because Costa Rican food is not spicy and they do not use jalapenos, so this is just wrong to me.  But I understand that Irazu is just trying to keep customers happy. My plantains were dry and hard, but some on the table looked perfect.  I wish mine had been the perfect ones, but I still ate them and enjoyed them.   I got to try the gallo pinto and it was great.  I have to come back for breakfast so I can have it properly.  I will definitely ask for my egg runny though!  The rice mixture soaks up the yolk of the egg and makes a delicious combination.  I know rice and beans doesn't sound like a normal breakfast dish, but trust me, it's delicious!

The outdoor seating was what my ladyfriend and I were after, so we put our name in and geared up for a 20-30 minute wait.  There were a pretty impressive number of folks there for a Monday night, but the weather was pretty badass so it made more sense.  Oh yeah, the food was also badass so that may be a more viable reason for the crowd.   We sat by the sidewalk and watched the friendly server open our bottle of two buck chuck and pour it into a pair of plastic cups.  I admired this safety precaution considering my flip flops and slippery fingers.  Server man mentioned that waters, chips and salsa would be coming up right behind him.  Unfortunately, that ended up being a lie.  I had to ask the host to hook us up with the goods.   Our Costa Rican looking server made up for the misstep with a profuse and heartfelt apology.  We ordered a black bean, fried pork bit and avocado dip called ""chifrijo"" to accompany our chips.  Both of us loved it and especially liked that it was an unknown flavor to us.  We ate too much of it, but still managed to maintain enough appetite for an entree apiece.  I ordered the onioned steak and she went with the garlic shrimp special. My plate consisted of fried green plaintains, cabbage, radish, yellow rice, thin cheap steak and onions.  They made that cheap, stringy, shitty cut of meat into a masterpiece.  I loved the flavor and felt like it had been pummeled for a while that day to increase tenderness.  The fried green plaintains were too raw, I'd go with the sweet version if I were you.  I like to arrange the perfect bite on every forkful and the variety on the plate allowed some extra experimentation. On the downside, our quadruple eyed, portly, affable, Costa Rican server said there would be 7 Texas sized shrimp on ladyfriend's plate.  The plate only had 5 and they looked like they were from Rhode Island.  Wait, that's not accurate, they were more South Carolina sized.  The taste made up for it along with a couple trips from her fork over to my plate.   Overall, it was a great experience.  The semi-slow service didn't bother us and shouldn't bother you; providing you bring enough wine.  Definitely will be back to try the oatmeal shake.  Peace out.",0.9981,0.75,0.206,0.044,0.6130572679353167

My mouth was on fire. I loved it. - 3 empanadas: beef and potato (YUM!), spinach cheese, zucchini. - Patacones: double fried green plantains with roasted garlic oil. But they lie to you. The roasted garlic oil is more like a chunky garlic oil paste that I wish they sold in jars because I would eat that stuff on everything and breathe ferocious garlic dragon breath to keep annoying people away. - Pepito sandwich: Hubby got this and loved it. I had one bite and loved it, though rice dishes always trump sandwiches in my eye (what? I'm Chinese). - Tinted squid mixed with rice: I got it spicy. It was so beautiful. A mound of rice mixed with squid pieces. Yes, it was a strange gray color, but it is tinted squid rice...what do you expect? Squid ink pasta looks weird but is delicious. I will dream of this rice all month. The dish comes with fried plantains and a cabbage salad. Complete comfort on a plate and I'm not even close to being Costa Rican. - And of course, the oatmeal shake. I got mine plain with soy. Nom nom nom. It tastes like a thick chunky horchata almost. Oatmeal banana is an excellent combo too. I have no clue how many trips I'll be making to try everything on the menu... chifrijo?! chicharron?! ceviche?! liver?! and the veggie stuff even sounds good! The places was completely empty when we arrived (on a cold rainy Friday at around 3pm) and we parked right in from of the restaurant (metered). Another table came in while we were eating and did the unforgivable deed of not ordering an oatmeal shake (and they didn't know what empanadas were....really?) but I've erased them from my memory (get the shake!) It is also cash only but if you forget, there's in ATM inside.  Nice helpful servers, terrific food, outdoor patio space. I can see this place getting insanely busy on sunny weekends, so go early and do yourself a favor and order take-out food after your meal. I am kicking myself in the face for not doing that right now. I should be eating deep fried pork chunks but am going to munch on a stuffed pizza pretzel instead. Sadface!

We ordered the guac (yummy, but not the typical mexican guac that i LOVE) and then an empanada appetizer platter.  I would recommend picking which ones you think you'd love vs. a sample platter.  Some were definitely better than others.  We also ended up sharing 3 meals instead of 4.  But probably would have been fine with 2. We got the Bistec Tico which was delicious.  Highly recommended so much that my friend who recommended this restaurant is having her wedding catered with it. Second entree was the Chicken Casado.  I really liked the flavoring of the veggies and the mixed rice was delicious.  However, the chicken was REALLY dry.  I would try that with steak next time. Third we got the Milanesa.  I thought that was just ok. For dessert we got the homemade bread pudding (i don't love baked goods but the girls liked) and an oatmeal chocolate shake which was, DELICIOUS.  tasted like a potbelly cookie.

2009-07-27,5.0,"I've loved Irazu since I started going in the late 90's. Hard to believe they've been around for as long as they have. So glad they're doing very well and since their son took over the business, the restaurant has some great added features - expansion of the outdoor patio, more items on the menu.  Over the years, I've stuck to a few of my favorites. The vegetarian plate is one of them, (loads of food), consisting of rice, beans, sweet plantains, cabbage salad and the veggie of the day. The highlight for me on this plate is the frijoles negros (black beans) and the amazing cabbage salad!! The salad is citrusy and refreshing with some great flavors. The veggie tacos are also very good and filling, with black beans, yellow rice, tomato, lettuce, avocado and if you want, hot peppers. Perfect for an inexpensive, quick meal.  Stopped in the other day and wanted something refreshing for the hot day. I ordered the ceviche which is raw fish marinated in lime juice, with avocado and some chopped tomatoes on top. The bowl that it comes in is deceiving. It appears to be small, but as I ate, it began to seem like the never ending bowl of ceviche. I hate wasting food, so I ate as much as I could stuff into my belly!! It was delicioso!! Empanada's are a semi-new edition to the growing menu. And since I'm a lover of empanada's, I had to try them out. Hand made fresh in the back kitchen by Mama Irazu herself, her empanada's are made with a corn dough. I love corn and these were very good. Can't wait to try the other veg flavors! A newer item on the menu is the hor-cafe. 1/2 horchata and 1/2 coffee. An interesting combination and it was very pleasing. You can't go to Irazu without trying one of their shakes. My favorite is the avena (oatmeal), which has a great flavor and grainy texture. Exceptionally tasty!! I didn't know it but you can combine 2 different shake flavors, so next time it's avena y chocolate!! Can't get enough of Irazu's!!!!",0.9954,0.776,0.184,0.04,0.5824358974358975

The only bad meal I have had here was when I ordered the potato tacos (after reading many good reviews on them).  I was disappointed though, I didn't expect them to be fried and rolled up like those taquitos at 7-11.  It was too much tortilla, too oily, and it was bland!  I had to salt the hell out of it, and I never have to salt my food.  That was a big disappointment.

Since I'd been spending the week at my cousin Melissa F's house (which is why all of my recent reviews mention the common foodie experiences), we were doing a culinary world tour and Irazu was a place we knew we'd want to stop from the beginning. She'd spent part of last summer in Panama, and since there's seemingly no Panamanian restaurant in the city, this was the closest we could get. We approached the restaurant at 8:30 on a Tuesday and were dismayed to see patrons waiting all over the place in front of the restaurant. Fearing a ridiculous wait, we went to put our names into the line as soon as possible and found that it was just the line for patio tables. Seeing as it was still 90 degrees and humid, we selected an inside table and were seated immediately. Our waitress came promptly and quickly took our drink orders and got us the guacamole (again with the guac, I know...it's not costa rican but it was good) we asked for in a minute or two. We decided on getting some empanadas and then we both settled on some steaks (she got cubed tri-tip and I got a skirt steak. The empanadas arrived hot and fresh and although I was not a huge fan of the plantain one (just don't like plantains I guess), the chicken and beef and potato ones were delicious. The steaks came soon after we finished the empanadas and they were great. I ordered mine with the special Costa Rican rice and I was not disappointed. The steak was brilliantly seasoned, the rice and beans (and whatever else was in there) were really nice and zesty and i gave my cousin my plantains, which she said were really good as fried plantains go.

No. I'm not terribly familiar with this neighborhood.  And by ""not terribly familiar"" I mean I have no friggin clue where I am going.  So the streets getting here drove me nuts (Aside from traffic really being sucky).  However, once there, I was able to easily find parking on a side street so that was a bonus- I really had no idea if parking was going to be a hassle.  I am thankful, because I took someone here who whined about everything, and if I gave said person another thing to whine about, I would have gone ape-shit.  :)  I will add my endorsement to the oatmeal shake.  I don't know if I'd ever find myself craving it, but it was definitely different, and I find it harder and harder to give that label to anything.  I liked it for sure.  I also really liked their chips and salsa. Honestly, I have surprisingly not found too many places where that is true!  And the potato tacos were really good- I thought it was a bizarre thing to see and had to try them.  I know others have commented that they are a bit boring, and perhaps that's true, but I look at is as ""potatos- good. taco shell- good guacomole- good. rice- good"" it was all just plain good, even if not a terribly exciting dish (and it was plenty of food for the price too).  Based on this one attempt, I would love to have a reason to come back and try more of the menu.  I have no idea what my lunch partner ordered as all I remember is being irritated with him for being so ridiculously unimpressed (but that is a whole different story) The outdoor seating area was nothing all that exciting- but I went in April on one of the very early nice days of the year, so I am guessing it gets spruced up a bit as the summer approaches.  Maybe my limited experience with this place is screwing with me- is there more seating somewhere else? This was a little patio with about 10 smallish tables right?  I think I'd like to try it at night some time, as I was there on a Saturday afternoon and there wasn't much atmosphere to speak of.  But I also appreciate outdoor seating in any form so I wouldn't hold it against them if I returned and had the same experience.

2009-06-17,3.0,"With the prevalence of Mexican cuisine in the Chicago area, it is natural, for an outsider like me, who has very little experience with Costa Rican food, to come to Irazu with the notion that they are somehow similar to one another. Yes, I know they are different but the question is, how are they different? That, in fact, was my mission for the day. Their tortilla chips were served with a warm black bean dip and the fried yuca was perfectly cooked and fluffy on the inside. In fact, I would prefer that over potatoes anytime. The beef casado with grilled onions was surprisingly huge; tons of meat to satisfy a true carnivore. It tasted like homemade with just salt and pepper, nothing fancy, just pure goodness. If that doesn't fill you up, check out their flan. It's was super creamy and rich but it might be slightly on the sweet side. The downside was the plain rice, which was pretty good except that it was slightly undercooked. Nothing ruins the meal like crunchy rice. So I have nothing to complement the meat other than the salad and egg. I should have asked for the gallo pinto, which was amazing. Another dish that was disappointing was their ceviche. I was looking for fresh ingredients that bring out the flavor and freshness of the fish but all I have was tomatoes and probably some peppers. It was quite bland to say the least.

I actually really enjoyed this place for its homemade taste.  Even though I'm not part Costa Rican by any means (though sometimes when I'm in a bar I pretend to be at times), the food reminded me of a homecooked meal.   The restaurant was small so you're sitting very close to other tables, but isn't family about touching those around you and listening in to their conversations...hmmm... I did try their oatmeal shake, but with soy...darn it, what was wrong with me?? It completely changed the taste.  Next time, it's original milk for me baby! The flan was not the best flan I've had and neither was the bread pudding, but they were good enough...good enough that I forced my stomach to keep accepting each new bite. Oh, oh, and the prices were very decent (no indecency allowed)...

The purported prophylaxis: Pepito with peppers.* Described by some as God's gift to Chicago, the best way I can describe the pepito is as a Costa Rican version of an Italian beef, and if you throw on the peppers I dare you to tell me it doesn't taste exactly like an Italian beef with giardiniera. You won't do it. You CAN'T do it. The sandwich is top tier with warm French break and juicy steak. The fish taco that Anders had was hot stuff as well. Irazu was packed like...umm...Janice Dickinson at Plato's Retreat. My advice to you: If you don't mind staying mobile, get your food to go. Anders and I took this tack and we had our food within five to ten minutes. Otherwise you would be wise to get to Irazu early.

It doesn't taste like restaurant food. I can't tell the difference between their dishes and those that my mom and my sisters prepare back home. And I think that's enough to say about Irazu.

I did not personally order this, but a friend of mine did and I was able to try it, not bad! I ordered the steak and onion with yellow rice and tostones. This is a huge portion and should be shared with another person unless you are a big eater. The steak was flavorful and rice was amazing. Since we came on a nice warm night, wait to sit outside was 30-40 minutes! No thanks, we enjoyed a nice table inside and had a hilarious server.

Good lord! We should have had that amount of food for at least 3 people, 'cause we spent the next 4 hours or so walking around, trying to get over feeling so dang full! It was worth it, though, and I'm glad she suggested this place.  Sure, as some people have mentioned, it's small.  However, even when they got busier (mostly outside 'cause of the nice weather), we had great service -- plenty of water and a server who was super attentive despite admitting he had Zyrtec/allergy head. I'd love to go back and would do so for the empanadas alone -- the exterior is the perfect crispy/flaky texture hiding the flavor inside... I'd recommend the spinach w/cheese, plantain, and even (yes) the zuchinni).

Yeah, you can probably pretty well imagine them without buying the entree. Ah well.) The mole sauce did kick things up a bit and the fried plantains were delish.

2009-04-23,4.0,"Hi, my name is Krystyna and I am a casado freak.  I admit it.  It's an addiction.   After coming back from Costa Rica in January, I make sure to stop by Irazu at few times a month so that I don't completely miss the flavors of Costa Rica.  Plus, it reminds me that I only have to wait T-29 days before I head back.  If only my favorite soda hadn't burned down in the interim.  I'm on a search now for a new favorite to replace my Costa Rican soda obsession! Irazu, though, is the perfect thing to tide me over.  This is a neighborhood joint and it is almost always packed in the evenings.  A mom-and-pop-owned BYO with a homey feel. You might be seated at bar-height tables or a picnic bench.  The decor is slightly cluttered but spotlessly clean and reminiscent of Costa Rican sodas.  Make sure to arrive with you entire party, otherwise you won't be seated...    You might as well make friends with other Irazu lovers while you wait.  Often, you're holding a conversation with a person pressed up against you while waiting for an empty table. It's almost....it's almost... like that slightly-creepy dude who presses up against you on the bus during your daily morning commute.  You just have to learn to embrace it because the reward is so great. The shakes, sandwiches, and casados are yummy; so, too, are its sides.  The pepito sandwich with avocado is delicious and big enough that you can eat half and save the rest for later.  Plus, at $4.95 a pop, it's too good a deal to pass up.  Order a side of platanos.  Depending on their ripeness, you might end up with firm, french-fry textured pieces of sweet banana or something smoother, more caramelly and infinitely sweeter. Like Dan D. said in his review, the must-try dish is the ""Casado."" It is the staple of true Costa Rican cuisine. Prepare yourself for a feast  for your taste buds, your eyes, and a sigh of relief from your wallet.   When you order casado, you get the smorgasboard: rice and beans, an over-easy egg, some sort of  cabbage salad, platanos (a slightly denser, more sweet variety of banana) and a choice of meat or fish.  I usually get the fish and I couldn't be happier with my selection.  The fish is flaky, tender, and never over-cooked. No matter which dinner place you get, make sure to try the Lizano salsa from the sides menu.  This is a condiment that is served with almost every meal and it truly complements most flavors in the Costa Rican kitchen. If you stop by on the weekend, be sure to try the red snapper special.  To quote Rachel Zoe (not that I often do, but....) ""I DIE"" it's so delicious. If you want to miss the crowd and feel up to a heavier, savory breakfast or brunch, stop by and try the Gallo Pinto.  For $5.50, it's a brunch steal!",0.9979,0.751,0.198,0.05,0.5273272797663042

Without question, the Irazu Vegetarian Burrito is a 5-star burrito.  Wrapped in a lightly grilled, thick tortilla, the standard vegetarian burrito comes packed with delicious yellow rice (not found in the regular burritos), black beans (clearly the bomb-diggity of all burrito beans), and veggies galore (I recommend throwing in some zucchini for $1 extra).  Finally, I topped off this bowling ball-sized monsterrito with a little chicken.  After all, who wouldn't want a Vegetarian Burrito w/ Chicken (oxymorons be damned)?   I'd love to give Irazu itself a 5-star review, but the apps and overly-hyped shake weren't quite as perfect as the almighty burrito.  Nonetheless, thank you, Irazu.  My burrito journey is finally over.  I can die happy.  Which just might happen tonight if my stomach doesn't eventually decompress.",-0.2156,0.825,0.08,0.095,0.4515084452584451

Omar suggested for me the chicken tico, and my boyfriend got the bistec casado.  Bistec casado was delicious, mine was horrible.  The chicken tasted like chicken in water with mushy overcooked veggies.  It was super bland.  Something must have gone wrong in the kitchen.  Omar not only apologized for this, but brought out 2 more entrees - grilled steak and pollo casado, and gave us a gift certificate for 2 smoothies.  The grilled steak and pollo casado were delicious!  So so good, I could not put my fork down.  We ate until we were in pain!

2009-02-15,5.0,"On an unfrequented and bleak strip of Milwaukee Avenue, you might not give a passing glance to the tiny green hut on the corner. Look again, my friend, for there resides Irazu, one of Chicago's only Costa Rican restaurants that boasts fare so exotic that the first half of the menu is definitions. Now, don't let the language intimidate you--Avena is just a fancy name for the eatery's signature drink, an oatmeal milkshake. Yes, you read that correctly--an oatmeal shake strongly reminiscent of the Mexican rice drink, Horchata, but delicious nonetheless. And that cinnamon-topped specialty isn't all--other shake flavors include corn meal, blackberry, and exotic Central American fruits such as the tamarindo and mamey, a mild apricot-raspberry flavor that will give you cavities on the spot. Yuca is another menu favorite, a potato-like root vegetable that can be served boiled or fried. We chose the fried option, which was topped with garlic oil and deep-brown bits of roasted garlic. It tasted amazing at first, but proved a little too greasy for my taste. Just make sure you don't fill up on this or the salty-greasy tortilla chips--both are out of this world, but a little heavy. I was looking forward to the gallo pinto, a Costa Rican breakfast of white rice and black beans served with fried plantains or eggs. This was served every morning when I visited Costa Rica, and it was hard to overcome that craving when I returned to the regular American pancake breakfast. Irazu's take on this authentic dish featured the rice and beans molded into a delectable dome and served with steaming aromatic corn tortillas. I chose the fried plantains, which were another oily-yet-extraordinary menu item--they could create a new genre of food with their collection of fried, heavy treats! A dining accomplice of mine chose the gallo pinto with scrambled eggs, which featured diced onions for a surprise twist of flavor. We were served promptly by an adorably authentic old man who spoke minimal english and seemed a little aloof. You won't have to wait long for any menu item--the vegetarian burrito, steak tostada, two gallo pintos, and order of fried yuca took under 15 minutes. There is ample outdoor and indoor seating, although the food must speak for itself in this minimalistic environment. The slightly drab interior might be more seductive if you visit at night, but I would eat Irazu's unique and consistent cuisine from a street vendor if that was what it took. Very affordable, most entrees under $8.",0.9869,0.9,0.086,0.014,0.4903656528656529

Last January, I went to Costa Rica, and being the food enthusiast that I am, was a bit disappointed that CR is not exactly a culinary mecca. Everywhere we went, we ate the traditional Costa Rican meal: casado (some meat, beans, rice, egg, plantains, and a wimpy salad). So naturally, when my friend found out about the sole Costa Rican restaurant, we HAD to eat there during my visit, and I HAD to have the casado. My friend had the tilapia casado, which was perfect - light, lemony, and fresh tasting. I opted for the beef asado - AWESOME. You could tell the beef had been marinated in citrus and spice for a long time because the flavor was in your face and the meat super tender. Not to mention this was a HUGE portion, easily feeding two with everything on the plate. Our plantains were perfectly crisped, the traditional rice fluffy and well-seasoned. Another friend had the potato tacos, which came out totally unlike what we expected - more like rolled up taquitos than what tacos bring to mind. But she thought they were also good and very filling. For old times' sake, my fellow travel companion and I got the guanabana shake with mango and papaya (respectively)...refreshing with plenty to share (or not!). On the whole, the meal was much better than some of the casados we had in CR! My friend has been there several times and says that there is some inconsistency (like the tilapia was not so fresh, the plantains more soggy the last time she went), but on the whole that Irazu is pretty darn good.

We went a little after lunch time & it was still PACKED. I mean so packed I had to crawl over and almost fall mind you!) a bench to get to the little table available.  We were immediately served their delicious homemade chips & super spicy salsa. Not a fan of the two salsas being served in plastic ketchup & mustard-like bottles, but I got over that real quick. After eating some cheese empanadas (in my opinion, pass on these & focus on the meal ahead of you), I decided on the steak burrito with added sour cream & avocado. I got the hot peppers on the side & am so glad I did. The burrito was so tasty that I think the hot peppers would have taken away from the complete & utter euphoria I was in. I mean seriously on the cold, windy day I felt as if I was sitting on a beach in Costa Rica enjoying a delicious, mom & pop made burrito. Yowzers! I didn't try my dining mates dish, but he finished it all & was totally sweating-shhh, don't tell him I told you. It was spicy, but the addicting kind of spicy. The food is inexpensive, but there is so much flavor. I can't wait until it gets warm again & will frequent Irazu just to try all the dishes on the menu.  Word to the wise: Don't go in big groups. It was just the two of us & we were able to skip ahead of all the families & groups of friends (sorry, sorry!) since there was a table for two in back open.",0.9902,0.856,0.132,0.012,0.5745370370370371
2009-01-03,4.0,"I guess with the utter lack of time and patience spent in the general Wicker Park and Ukranian Village neighborhoods, it's no wonder I never had the luxury of having a meal at Irazu.  There was so much talk of this place over the years, I finally found out what it was all about. My girlfriend and myself stopped by after she raved about the delicious Costa Rican food.  Upon entering, I immediately felt at ease with the smell of fried plantains and tortillas.  Our server sat us and I spent the next ten minutes pouring over the menu.  So many exotic and delicious options not seen at your neighborhood taqueria.  I chose the Gallo Pinto breakfast special with eggs overeasy and plantains.  My girlfriend had the notorious veggie burrito.  The Gallo Pinto was pretty much no frills, but exactly what I wanted for breakfast on a cold winters day.  The amalgumation of eggs, beans, rice and plantains are something truly special that I feel I could eat every day.  I can see why so many Latin American cultures have subsided on such dishes for the last thousands of years; it just tastes so good and fills you up.  I wasn't blown away, but really loved it nonethless.  The veggie burrito I tried was also excellent and a really nice balance of flavors.  I finished it off with a dark and strong cup of Costa Rican coffee...black.  It was divine.  Overall, a great spot, with homely service, excellent prices and very solid food.  I'd definitiely check it out the next time i'm in the neighborhood.",0.9956,0.767,0.205,0.028,0.5294805194805194

And there are even veggie options hiding among the other sections. You know that they've got meat options as well.

Really, who understands that? You know about the cheap sandwiches and tacos - You could fill your tummy for under 5 bucks if you so desire. And, finally, you know about that oatmeal shake.

2008-11-04,4.0,"My friend Leon and I had a late lunch today at Irazu. Thanks to the beautiful election day weather, we were able to sit outdoors in the patio. While it's very nice to be outdoors, I wasn't crazy about this patio. Not because of anything the restaurant did, but because the Blue Line El tracks are across the street. When a train passes, it's so loud, you really can't hear the other person talk. And when there are two trains, you can forget conversation entirely. So, while I really appreciate the 70 degree weather and the nice breeze, this is a very noisy patio, and I would probably avoid it in the future. We were the only people at the patio, and we got service very quickly. I don't think we'd been sitting for 60 seconds before we got water, chips, and two kinds of salsa. ButI've been jonesing for guacamole something fierce, and I starved myself in preparation for this lunch, I ordered guacamole. You can get regular or spicy, so I went for the spicy. Spicy means there are chopped chilies at the side of the mound of guac, which comes with tomatoes. I thought the guac was kind of thin, almost watery, and didn't have much flavor. Adding the chilis definitely perked it up, but it still seemed kind of thin. Leon and I are both vegetarians. I ordered the vegetarian burritos, and did not get the extras added (mushrooms, zucchini,or something else), which cost extra. I thought the veggie burrito was outstanding, very tasty, warm, and fresh. I did add some of the red salsa, but just because I like a kick of extra flavor. Leon ordered the veggie sandwich, and he loved it. It had black beans, lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and I don't know what else. I might try that next time. Leon also ordered a shake, which is made in the Costa Rican style. It was oatmeal with mango, the special of the day. I took a spoonful, and boy was it good. I never imagined you could make a shake with oatmeal. I could definitely taste it, and I liked it. That was the only taste I got - I think Leon would have slapped my hand, if I'd tried to take more. I finished with a cup of regular coffee. It took about two minutes to get it after I asked for it. The prices here are very reasonable, and the food was very good.

It's filling and pretty good but it's NOTHING to wait ages over as we did. This isn't the Bongo Room. But if you don't mind wiling away the hours here - at least you'll go home with a second meal. But first it'll take you another 10 minutes to track down a to-go box. I thought I was being smart when I flagged down our server (stopping by the table?! Pah!) and said ""Could we please have two to-go boxes and the check?"" The check arrives with one to-go box. I asked for another. Nothing came and I watched him bring boxes to another table. I had to get up and walk over to the bus station and get it myself. They should just make this place counter service for fuck's sake. I wasn't surprised when the cashier didn't ask how everything was. So our plans to take an evening bike ride were killed by Irazu's total inefficiency. We were left crabby and overly full on fried food.",0.9763,0.867,0.098,0.035,0.5242898913951546
2008-06-25,5.0,"Why the 5 stars? well there was one other costa rican restaurant I heard about in Chicago, but I'm not sure if it's still around. As far as I know this is the only one and it is the best. Outdoor seating makes it even better. BYOB to top it all off. As if there aren't enough yelp reviews of Irazu already, here's my take. Awesome everything. I've had almost everything on the menu and have never been dissappointed. I have even tried some of their weekend specials that they have from time to time. Their shakes are the best, especially on a hot day. I recommend a 2 flavor of either oatmeal mango or oatmeal banana or even just simply oatmeal.  Now for food, For starters, I recommend their guac with freshly minced jalepenos on the side; Simple, fresh, and always delicious.  Now on to the main deal, Everyone says they have some of the best vegetarian selections around and I completely agree. I'm not a vegetarian, but I am a foodie. And when I'm in the mood, i will go meatless. Veggie Burrito with mushrooms and avocado or the veggie sandwich are my picks.They are jam packed with fresh veggies and are very well balanced and satisfying. As far as the meat selections, everything is good and I would base it on how hungry you happen to be when you visit. The Steak sandwich is by far my favorite and it was recommended to me by ""Mom"" who is one of the owners. Now if you are really hungry, I would order the Bistec Tico or the Casado dinner. Both come with a delicious portion of thin rib eye steak cooked in the very famous Lizano sauce (they're available by the bottle there if you want to take some home) The sauce is boss and has a tangyness with a little bit of a kick. You also get a fresh array of sauteed veggies and of course some rice and beans and a side of fried plantains with the dinners. I only get the Casado if I feel like having a fried egg with my meal....mmhmmmmm. The servers are friendly and courteous and they make you feel right at home. Its family run, but still professional, and you can experience that through their awesome staff. I've been going there for years and I'm probably there at least once a week. I can never get enough of those steak sandwiches or their oatmeal banana shakes. So try it at your own risk, you may become as addicted to it as I have.",0.9984,0.79,0.2,0.011,0.6499368686868687

2008-05-18,4.0,"The food at Irazu is superb and the staff is very friendly.  It is relative inexpensive, especially considering the plates are piled high with food.  One of the things that impressed me the most was their ""milkshake,"" which in Costa Rica is basically a blend of milk, ice, and a fruit of your choice.  Having been to Costa Rica and having had multiple milkshakes their everyday, I've tried to make my favorite type - pineapple - here in Chicago and have always failed.  It always has tasted quite strange when I've made it.  When I ordered it at Irazu, the waitress suggested that she make the pineapple milkshake with Soy make rather than regular milk, since the regular milk would apparently curdle... The result was pure deliciousness and I now know how to successfully make one of these myself!  Finally, be sure to get their fried plantains!  Now for the reason I did not give this place 5 stars - Authenticity.  A few things struck me as odd.  Although costa rican food varies widely, it is usually considered to be ""bland"" compared to the food of neighboring countries.  Irazu definitely spices up their food and makes the dishes much more elaborate than you would find in the country.  In Costa Rica, in order to make their food tastier people usually put Lizano Salsa on their meals.  I was quite surprised when I tasted their rather spicy ""Lizano salsa.""  In Costa Rica, this salsa is not spicy at all and is actually usually compared to a Worcester sauce!  When I got home from Irazu I actually cracked open a bottle of my own Lizano Salsa just to confirm that it was completely different from what they were marketing!  Finally, the last non-traditional Costa Rican item were the tortilla chips on the table. All in all, the food is great and you get a lot for the price, but its authenticity is a bit in question. Addition - I went back and specifically asked for Lizano Salsa - they gave me a little plastic cup with ~1 tablespoon of the salsa and charged me $1 ;(",0.8913,0.912,0.062,0.026,0.5116955416955417

At about 6:30, we were quickly seated, but had we showed up 10 minutes later we would have been waiting in line. This is a teeny tiny restaurant -- really just 10 or so tables tossed in to a back room. I heart places like that, so I immediately felt comfortable at Irazu. Loved the atmosphere.  My bf and I ordered the guacamole -- good, especially if you're a purist,  I'm talking straight up smashed avocados. I had the vegetarian burrito, which is amazing. Just to be safe, I had them put the hot peppers on the side, but next time I will have them put on the burrito. Boyfriend got some meat dish -- he loved it and I ate his plantains, which were sweet and lovely. We ate every last bit of food they gave us it was so damn good. Unfortunately, I was totally looking forward to trying the oatmeal shake but we were way too full. Next time -- and oh yes, there will be a next time. Hopefully it will be like... tomorrow.  Also worth mentioning, this place has a good amount of vegetarian, and dare I say, vegan options. And just for the record, my rating is really like 4.75.

The very helpful person who took our order recommended we add chocolate to the oatmeal shake and banana to the cornmeal one. When all was said and done, I liked the cornmeal one better. They were both really good, but I think my expectations for the oatmeal shake were just too high. I enjoyed the ""gritty"" texture of both of them, but the oatmeal one was too... icy, or something. Hard to put a finger on exactly what it was. I'd give the oatmeal shake 4 stars and the cornmeal shake 5. I had the potato tacos, and they were also really good. They weren't quite as ""involved"" as I thought they'd be -- literally just mashed potatoes in a taquito-like setting -- but simplicity is the way to go when it comes to these things, as far as I'm concerned. All in all? I'd definitely go back again. A bunch of us ate there that night and all the food looked (and SMELLED) really good, and everyone gave it a thumbs up.",0.9907,0.791,0.167,0.042,0.5294202898550724

Another thing that I love about Irazu is the BYOB policy.  In the summer it's great to grab an outdoor table, enjoy a burrito (or anything off their menu) and crack open one of your favorite beers or wines.  Plus, no corkage fee.   The prices are really reasonable too, so Irazu is great for cheap eats.   I think that the Check Please effect is still in effect, meaning that sometimes there is a wait.  Also, parking can be tough.  But it's always worth the trip.",0.9939,0.751,0.217,0.032,0.5752740469407135

The lines grew, as did the waiting time for a Formica-topped table, on weekends, giving new meaning to Latin time.

2007-04-22,3.0,"I live less than a block from Irazu, so I've been there aplenty. Irazu inspires mixed emotions within me. On the one hand, the food is relatively inexpensive and tasty. On the other hand, the service leaves much to be desired. I really wanted to give this restaurant four stars, but the simple truth is that the service could easily be remedied, yet it hasn't. The good: All of the sandwiches I've had are fresh, delicious, and cheap. I'm talking $4.50, and while they aren't monstrous, nor are they dinky. The shakes are awesome, the burritos are huge and yummy (the veggie is especially good), and the freshly fried tortilla chips are just that--freshly fried. And, of course, the plantains. Mmm...plantains.  The bad: Ugh! I can't recall a time when I've been in and out of this place in under an hour. First of all, it's not terribly spacious, which isn't necessarily a big deal, until you realize they aren't using all available space. Yo, dig this mutha fuggin example: I just ate at Irazu this past Friday. It was very pleasant outside, and as usual, many people were waiting for tables. The patio was locked with a sign that read, ""We hope to have the patio opened by Memorial Day."" Huh? The tables and chairs are already out. Why not open the patio now? Serve more people. Make more money. Easy. The other issue with the service is that once you're seated, your server probably won't take your order for at least 15 minutes. After you've ordered your food, it'll likely be at least 30 minutes before it arrives. After you've eaten your food, it will likely be another 15 minutes before your server brings your check. The servers at Irazu certainly aren't unfriendly, but the problem is that I've only ever seen one server working at any given time, even when the lines are well out the door. This seems a bit ridiculous to me. Business is clearly doing well. Add a server to the Friday and Saturday night shifts. The sum total: If you don't mind the wait, go to Irazu. If you're not fond of long waits, but still want some good food, just phone your order about a half an hour to 45 minutes before you'd like to pick it up.  Be in the know: Irazu does not deliver and they are cash only. Also, if they run out of potatoes or plantains, don't go all native and try the yuca. Just eat your sock, it would taste about the same.

I went there on a Monday night with a party of 4 total. Don't plan to be seated quickly as this place ROCKS any day of the week (if our Monday outing was any indication). They have VERY few tables. We ended up at one of the high ""bar tables"" near the windows. They really aren't for more than 3 people, but we squeezed in. It was worth the wait! We had a GREAT time! The food was WONDERFUL. The service was prompt (with a minor glitch--they forgot to take a drink order with the meal order and as busy as it was, it took us a few minutes to point this out to them). I had the chile relleno dinner which was very nice. Milder than I'd like, but I'm a SPICE FANATIC! One of our group had Yuca con ajo (I think--Yuca roasted with garlic)--it was YUMMY! I also had a side of a couple of their Costa Rican Tacos. They were interesting. I'd never have expected them to be basically like Mexican taquitos (rolled & deep fried) with meat inside & lettuce & ketchup & mayo on top--YES, YOU READ RIGHT, Ketchup & Mayo)! They were actually quite tasty. One of our group had the steak with grilled onions--WOW, what a PILE of onions! The plantains were scrumptious also. I'll definitely return.

It's a tiny building, and when you walk in, you are in a small take out area. Don't worry, this is the place. The dining area is ""cozy."" Which is to say, it's about the size of my living room (okay, maybe living room and dining room), with seating for maybe 30 people. Tops. It's nothing special, but you don't come here for the atmosphere, you come for the food. Which is delicious. At the urging of everyone on Yelp -- and the invisible hand of Molly McButter - I had the oatmeal shake. It is exactly what it sounds like, yet somehow more. Very tasty, with a touch of cinnamon and sugar but not too much. The menu offers a range of choices, from sandwiches for less than 5 bucks to full dinners in the $10-12 range. Very affordable, and worth every penny. I had the Onioned Steak, which is thin slices of rib eye (think ""minute steak"") smothered in onions and served with a side of rice and beans, tostones (fried plantains), and cabbage salad, which is similar to a vinegar-based cole slaw. Our server was pushing the Gallo Pinto, which is a Costa Rican version of black beans and rice, and it was great. Definitely order it in place of the standard yellow rice and pinto beans. My meal was delicious and very filling, and a bargain at $12.50.  And it was one of the most expensive things on the menu. If this is your first visit, I'd suggest the Casado dinner: it's a little bit of everything. But everything I saw come out of the kitchen looked great. When we went, the service was a little indifferent. Not enough to put me off to the place, but a bit questionable. If you're going out for dinner, get there early, 'cause they close at 9pm.

2006-03-30,5.0,"Now here's a taste of a Chicago hole-in-the-wall that can't be beat simply because there's only one of it's kind.  Irazu (accent on the zu) should not be mistaken for a Mexican restaurant.  As mentioned in prior reviews, it does have a hispanic background, but it is NOT Mexican...it is Costa Rican, and thus the foods of Costa Rica are very different from that of Mexico.  Hence, the lack of spice.  Costa Rican food is not about spice, it is about basic, simple good food.  It's the kind of food that mothers make for their families, relatives and friends.    Irazu is owned and run by Miriam and Gerardo Cerdas with the assistance of their children, Henry and Donna.  While most of the staff is family, the others may just as well be family because of the length of time they've been with the Cerdas family.  Gerardo shops, Miriam cooks and supervises in the kitchen, and Henry and Donna do everything they can to help make things run smooth.  Upon entering the restaurant, it would be easy to mistake this awesome restaurant for another burrito joint, and while they have it on their menu, a burrito joint it is not.  In the back is the actual sitting area and it is very small, but it is clean, quaint and simple.  The sitting area can accommodate at most approximately 30 people.  And since they don't take reservations, waiting is almost a sure thing, even up until 15 minutes to closing time.  But don't let that discourage you or you will miss out on some of the best ethnic food in Chicago.  Enough about the restaurant, let's talk about the food.  As I mentioned before, Miriam is the cook and she cooks like there's no tomorrow.  It's home cooking like you've never had.  The Hub and I ordered the ceviche, and while we ordered it spicy, it wasn't, but that did not deter from the flavorful goodness of this ceviche.  It was light, it was fresh, it was delish!!  Both of us ordered the signature meal, the Casado, a traditional Costa Rican dish.  The meal comes with either thin rib eye steak or chicken breast and caramelized with onions.  It can be served with white rice, black beans or the gallo pinto ( a staple of Costa Rican food which is a mixture of beans and rice and is truly tasty) with an over easy egg, sweet plantains and a salad.  Both were fantastic.  The steak was so tender and flavorful, and the chicken was juicy and just as tasty.  The plantains are sweet, but not over-sweet.  A must try is the oatmeal shake.  There is nothing like it.  It is really delicious.  I know, oatmeal isn't really a fundamental for shakes, but they've managed to create a really original flavor that works.  They have other unique flavors, some of which are not native to the US (guanabana, mamey and pinolillo) and I can't wait to try them.  For the cost of the meal, there was so much food.  I wanted to finish my plate, but I just couldn't find the room.  I was excited, though, at the thought of having it again the next day.  I would just fry another egg and add it to my leftovers!!  We were full, but we had to order the flan.  And what can I say...it was superb.  Just the right texture and flavor of custard to caramel.  All in all, really a great meal.  Now, I have to tell you, we got to the restaurant at 8:45 p.m. and they close at 9 p.m.  We didn't get seated until a little after 9 p.m. because there were 3 couples before us.  We didn't have an issue with the timing of the food.  It came at the right time, but then again, we ordered while we were waiting.  Our appetizer arrived as we were seated, and our food came shortly after we completed our appetizer, piping hot.  While we had no issues with our meal or the service, we were told by Henry that he and Donna were the only waitstaff, and they were assisted by a busperson, thus the service may be a little slow.  The kitchen is small and all the cooking is made to order, so the food comes out slow when it is really busy.  While there are no immediate plans to expand, they do plan to work on their kitchen efficiency, but they ask that everyone try to be patient and understand that everything is cooked with the love and attention as every other meal that is served out of their kitchen.  They only have one mom, and for her, everything has to be perfect before it's served to the customer.  It's the quality of the food that counts at this place.  The hours are limited (M-Sat, 11 a.m. - 9 p.m., closed Sundays), the wait may be long, and they only take cash.  But believe me when I say the food is definitely worth it.  I would say an average meal is about $15/person.  Oh, and there is no alcohol, but it is BYOB.  I would suggest a bold red for the wine drinkers.  And I wouldn't recommend a big group for this restaurant, especially since they don't take reservations.  They're also open for lunch, and if you are in a hurry, they recommend you call ahead.  As Miriam says, her food isn't fast food, so give the kitchen a break.  Kick back and relax...the wait will be worth it.",0.999,0.83,0.141,0.029,0.5377140768588136

2006-01-21,3.0,"This place is great.  I always get the food carry-out becuase of the tiny seating area on the interior.  They do have a very small patio in the front of the restaurant...but there isn't much scenery on that portion of Milwaukee.  Much of the food is deep fried...so keep that in mind.  For some reason, I always have the need to take a nap after I eat this food...yet, I keep coming back!",0.6588,0.938,0.062,0.0,0.3671428571428571

2005-10-12,4.0,"Great Costa Rican food in the neighborhood. The restaurant doesn't look too appealing from the outside but the food definitely makes up for it. What I love most about Irazu is there milkshakes. Try the mamey one! Its fantastic! The salsa isnt great, lacks flavor..and the plantains are too greasy and thick..but other than that, everything else makes up for it.",0.9318,0.716,0.226,0.058,0.5472222222222222
2005-09-25,5.0,"Irazu is one my most favorite places in Chicago.  It's so good that I could probably eat there every day.  It's priced well and the food is amazing, especially the potato tacos and sweet plantains. You'll never leave Irazu hungry 'cause the portions are huge.  Try the oatmeal shake!",0.9515,0.652,0.321,0.028,0.7928571428571429
2005-09-15,5.0,"Irazu is one of those ""gems"" in the Bucktown area. It is Costa Rican food, which I find very flavorful yet lighter than Mexican or Cuban food. I have been there a few times, and have never been disappointed. There are only about 15 tables or so, so be prepared to wait for a table if you are dining-in during the late dinner rush. You have to walk in knowing what to expect. It is just a little bit above the typical ""hole in the wall"" feeling. However, the atmosphere is comforting and warm, being a very family-friendly place.  Many of my friends who enjoy Irazu love their fruit shakes. Since I am not a shake fan, I have never tried them. But they seem to be pretty popular, with many different flavors including some exotic fruits--and they can be made with either water or milk.",0.9754,0.801,0.187,0.013,0.5447368421052632
2005-09-09,4.0,"The food here makes up for the lack of atmosphere.  Try the the plantains and the empanadas.  They've got some great vegetarian options but for meatlovers like me, they also have the Costa Rican steak dinner.  Try one of their shakes - they've got some funky flavors but keep in mind that they run on the sweet side (I request mine minus sugar) but the more interesting ones include guanabana, papaya, passion fruit, and tamarind",0.948,0.761,0.202,0.037,0.5
2005-09-02,4.0,I love this place too. But the food is super good and way less greasy than Mexican food. But be forewarned: the inside is super small and they keep really weird hours. This ain't no place to grab a taco at 4AM.,0.9413,0.644,0.318,0.038,0.5

Always good vegetarian options (usually Spinach Plate or Potato Tacos...go with the tacos). The salsa is disappointing, but nothing else is.",0.7351,0.743,0.177,0.08,0.65
