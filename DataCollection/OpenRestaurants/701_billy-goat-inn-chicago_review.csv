Good condiments can help save a mediocre burger. Here, the pickles are very good. But your choices are pickles, onion, relish... and that's it!

I have always heard that the Billy Goat Tavern is a MUST try whenever coming into the city of Chicago. I know the legend behind the chain and the pop culture references but this restaurant was something completely different. I came in here midday and the place the completely dead. It was a clear warning of the dining experience that was to follow. Before I review my food I think there is something to be said about the menu. Whenever I go into a diner and I see the words ""ALL SODA REFILLS $1.00"" plastered smack-dab in the middle of the menu I know the owners are going to be cutting corners in every way possible to make their ends meet. Now I am not against running a profitable business, however, when it comes to the food industry your restaurant should be getting enough traffic in on a daily basis to give away refills. If you are not turning enough profit to do so you probably have bigger problems with your products. I ordered a double cheese burger and a french fries. The best part of the double was bun. The meat was super thin and over cooked and then there was only a single slice of american cheese on the DOUBLE cheese burger. The burger comes naked and you have to dress it with all your own pickles or relish, chopped onions or whole, ketchup and mustard. The toppings all seemed pretty fresh but they were just sitting out underneath a sneeze guard without any means of keeping them cool. The fries were very mediocre and not worth the cost.

We laughed at his expense, but I digress. I ordered the salami and egg sandwich because I really couldn't pass up such a combo. I'm pretty sure the bf had a ham and egg sandwich. The sandwiches were good, greasy, runny egg yolk yum. I will say the bread is totally wrong though. Way too thick, like kind of a brioche bun? Its just way too much bread and not toasted or warm.

An undersized, flavorless, mystery patty is served without a plate (classy), on an open bun (better to let it get cold faster) w/ nothing more than some tasteless yellow stuff that vaguely resembled cheese (you gotta get your own raw onions, chopped raw onions, relish, pickles, mustard, or ketchup with forks that may never have been washed) - $3 (20090121).  Spare injury to the great myth and DO NOT EAT here -- reality will disappoint your imagination. It should be said, I don't drink booze so maybe getting sloshed beforehand 1st is the secret to appreciating this bland crap.  I wonder why would anybody support this rude, overpriced, flavorless ""institution"" that actually put a 'curse' on the Cubbies?!!! Seems to me anybody who eats here could easily be thought of as patently anti-Chicagoan. Ugh, so where's a good arsonist when you need one...",-0.6406,0.789,0.097,0.114,0.5770232371794873
2008-10-15,2.0,"I was there yesterday for the opener of the Blackhawks. I've been there couple of times for regular season games but this was the first time for an opener. Usually I would just have a couple of drinks, but this time I went all out and tried the burgers. First of all, the place was packed (cuz maybe its the  1st game of the season - HELLO :) Had a cheeseburger with fries. Didn't know how BIG it will be.... I wasn't that impressed with it. Maybe it's just me but the burger itself was REALLY thin (no wonder why I saw so many people or double cheeseburgers) and the the bun was a ""French Roll"" that was just two much for a thin patty. Even McD's burgers are bigger!!! I think I better just stick with drinks only!!!  ohhhh yeah and they were so busy the cooks just use their bare fingers/hand and served the burgers with just paper and said ""what you have""....  Hum....????",0.8872,0.903,0.077,0.02,0.4365047233468287

The fiance and I often go there when we have our car since it is one of the few places in the city with a free parking lot that isn't constantly full.  I like the neighborhood bar feeling and did I mention the parking? Here is the breakdown:    * Wait staff: Gruff, but endearing.     * Drink Menu: Full bar and even a signature drink ""Horny Goat"".    * Menu: Greasy spoon standards at least this location has a breakfast menu.    * Parking: They have their own lot... beautiful free parking.    * Dress: Casual",0.9724,0.754,0.204,0.043,0.6782051282051282
2008-04-08,3.0,"I think it was the review of Portillo's where I proclaimed that ""just b/c a certain establishment is a Chicago institution doesn't necessarily make it *good* "" and then went on to say that Portillo's, was in fact, very good. Well, Billy Goat is a case (for me, at least) where that aforementioned quote is turned on its head.  For whatever reason, I find myself going there from time to time, ""just because"" and furthermore just b/c its unapologetically Chicago.  Funnily enough, I don't necessarily even think their burgers are that great, but I just go there and immerse myself in that mad, bad Billy Goat nostalgia. This particular location is about as non-descript and lacking in character as any restaurant on the planet, but again, it just works. Double, w cheese, fries, not chips (yea, yea, it's the other way around but i like me some fries, sue me) and a coke.  Done, Did, Out.",0.0092,0.86,0.083,0.057,0.5697448979591837
2008-04-08,3.0,"I realize it's a Chicago institution, but I really wasn't impressed.  I think they are using the ""institution"" status to stay in business, personally... My burger wasn't cooked in the middle, the bartender was beyond rude, and the conversation that I overheard was primarily racist & homophobic, which irritated me more than anything else.  The guy I was with says I have to go back when it's not a United Center event night (we stopped in before a hockey game), and I might consider it, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go, nor would I recommend it to others...   I've been to plenty of Chicago institutions that I loved & would rather frequent.",-0.9502,0.734,0.067,0.199,0.4054945054945055

2007-07-02,4.0,"I like the Billy Goat... the burgers are okay, and if you get a single you have to really be in the mood to eat your bread, because the burgers are little and the rolls are big, so if you're hungry for meat I recommend getting a double.  I've brought my kids in here before stuff at the United Center and the kids were good with the polish sausage, it's greasey... but then, when isn't it?  My favorite part of eating at the Billy Goat is that I get to put my own condiments on and they've got very tasty pickles!  I usually get a mound of them to eat with my burger... and they are always yummy!  (but then, if you haven't figured out from my review of Hero's... I LOVE a good pickle!) Okay, everything said, I think this particular location is a great one to hit before an event at the UC... but just be sure to bring cash because they don't take cards.",0.9847,0.79,0.192,0.018,0.46869488536155196

I was in the one downtown by sears tower once time and it had a note up from the health department notifying people about health code violations. Anyways, this is a review about the billy goat on madison. The only thing that I like about this place is that you can drink here in the middle of the day, and its not horribly over priced. Ive come here for lunch a couple of times and drank way to much. The food is way over priced for what you are getting, its not that bad..but its not good either.",-0.4738,0.876,0.048,0.076,0.56
