I expected a very long wait but was actually seated right away and outside! FYI they have blankets in case you get chilly. Atmosphere- Lively and bustling, it's also in a really great area to shop and just walk around. Service- Our food was at our table less than 10 mins after we ordered, I was surprised at how quickly everything was out. Very friendly waitress and quick delivery. Food- so why the 3 stars? Perhaps my expectations were too high or I shouldn't have ordered the Tanaki sandwich. I need to come back for a second take! Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was good... the peanut butter gave it a nice taste but it didn't have the 5 star taste. My friend got the chickpea dish and she thought the same. The dishes tasted too much like something we had tried before. I will be returning to try their most popular dishes!",0.992,0.786,0.214,0.0,0.5057242063492063

The chef here is highly skilled and service is good, but I've always found the whole experience boring. While I've never had a bad meal at Lula, I've never had one that I remembered the next day. Lula is in the same general category as Avec and Giant, but I leave those places immediately wanting to return. I left Lula wondering why I didn't eat at Avec or Giant. There's a lot of unnecessary ""unusual for the sake of unusual"" ingredients on the menu. Clearly, I'm in the minority as everyone LOVES this place. I just don't (although I also don't dislike it).

We ordered one for the table and I definitely had more than my allocated amount. Gotta keep that vision sharp.  Everything else was bursting with flavor and really showcased Chef Hammel's innovation and his commitment to local purveyors.The local farm to table movement is strong at Lula and you can even research where ingredients are from prior to your dining experience as the restaurant website has an entire section devoted to this.

A culinary mecca.  We went for lunch this afternoon and it was absolutely tasty-- the waitstaff (and the host) were just awesome - attentive, funny, etc.  The outdoor space is just a gift on a Chicago summer afternoon.   The menu is definitely eclectic- a bit too eclectic for my taste- weekday lunch is actually brunch and you can choose either breakfast foods or lunch foods. I went for the turkey sandwich which was, really, a turkey sandwich. The chicken and egg sandwich is far more distinctive (and also super rich -- this isn't a light sandwich).  Perhaps we just didn't order the dazzling things, so I certainly plan to give Lula another try.  But so far, I can say it's solid and lovely though I would-- and I whisper this since it might be controversial-- that I prefer Same Day.",0.9836,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.6392316017316015

There is patio seating, their front room which looks more modern and their back room which is had a small stand up piano, and some more window seating. The hostess seated me and I sat for a little waiting for my friend and realized the AC was hitting right at our table, I asked to be reseated and they did so right away with a smile on their face! We ordered the Classic Lula Breakfast Burrito and Lula '99 Turkey Sandwich. I enjoyed the burrito more than the sandwich. The egg in the burrito was nice and fluffy and the mesh of the avocado, potatoes, and tomatoes was great! The sandwich and burrito actually had similar ingredients inside - avocado, tomato, and onion. However, the bread was a bit too hard and I wasn't a fan of the sprouts. The reason I knocked down a tad is because nothing on the menu was really appealing aside from the two items that we ordered, and nothing really stuck out to me or was super special, as I feel like you can get these two items elsewhere.

The biscuits were flaky with just the right touch of salt, the eggs poached to perfection, and the chicken moist with a crunchy, umami fried coating. Topping off the omelet was ample black truffle shavings, which I appreciated. However, the egg batter was airy with a smooth consistency.

My sister treated both my husband and I (and herself) to their six-course vegetarian tasting menu plus wine pairing as an early birthday gift to both of us. Lula Cafe is located in Logan Square, which is a pretty big neighborhood now and is booming with millennials and people old like us too haha.  Our experience here was nothing short was fantastic! The place is really cute, dimly lit, intimate and is actually bigger than you think from the outside! And despite the interior, it's a very casual place so you don't need to be super dressed up. Their entire menu sounded good, but we were there for the vegetarian tasting menu plus wine pairing. I couldn't tell you the wines we drank because I forgot, but I do remember the course we ate: * Their take on a Caesar-type salad with radishes, ricotta salata, Parmesan, black quinoa and a dressing. I twas absolutely delicious! Radishes are seriously one of my new favorite things now. * A lemon mousse of sorts, but savory: it was topped with fried onions, greens and other things. It wasn't our favorite, but the flavors were really good. * Sugar snap peas, braised radishes in a lemony dressing - so good! The greens were so crisp and the flavors really bold * Fried rice-ish dish * Cheese course * Deconstructed strawberry short cake with brown butter crumble, strawberries, basil mint ice cream and omg so good Overall, our experience was great. The wines were so delicious with each course. The first and last course is what blew us away and something we'll remember for a really long time. The staff was so friendly and attentive to us with each course, explaining the dishes and the wines as well.  The only thing I can state is that it's a little expensive. It's $60/person and then add another $30 if you include wine. This seems expensive but I did a similar vegan tasting menu in Michigan which was $60/person (it was $45 plus $15 for wine) and the portion sizes were smaller and we only got 4-5 courses. This was totally worth it for almost $100/person: you get full size portions, six courses and wines. Make sure you also make a reservation if you can. We got there early but our reservation was for 9pm! so this place must really be happening. I really don't have a bad thing to say about this place!

Went there for brunch with a friend at 10:30 am on a Saturday, and we didn't even have to wait for a table. (For groups of 3 or more, I believe there is usually a wait). I have tried a lot of brunch places, but none have had a menu as natural and innovative as Lula's. The interior of the restaurant is also distinctive and airy, with high ceilings and old-fashioned embossing. We ordered the hand-brewed coffee, which was extremely bold and delicious. At $10, it appears overpriced on the menu but is actually enough coffee for 6 cups, so it was perfect for 2 people to share. I had the Rye Dutch Pancake, which was unlike anything I've had before.  It was served in a skillet with an eggy pancake at the bottom and a poached egg, bacon pieces, hazelnuts, parmesan cheese, and asparagus on top. Truly one-of-a-kind. I also had the buckwheat rhubarb scone, which was equally adorable and delicious. The friend I visited is a native of New York City (aka, a tough customer) and he was extremely impressed. The only sort-of negative I'd give this restaurant is that the service was a bit slow and there were times when we needed things but had to ask someone else because our server didn't come back for a while. Either way, the staff was polite and we understood that it was peak hours for them. Overall, this place offers an amazing dining experience, with the food, decor, and music to boot. Highly recommend.",0.9958,0.773,0.206,0.021,0.6293818181818183

I cannot say enough good things about nearly everything I have had here for their dinner service. I always look forward to trying new things here. I have also tried the vegetarian Monday farm dinner and that was also lovely from start to finish. Would recommend for vegetarians trying to find something good to eat for dinner.

When they say they are known for fresh ingredients, they aren't kidding.  Our summer menu was chalk full of fresh rhubarb. Rhubarb bellini. Rhubarb and strawberry yogurt with chamomile granola.

Ambiance: It's a bit loud and snug inside. A lot of natural light gets in through the windows which makes it great for a sunny afternoon and makes the place look bigger. Food: Chicken and biscuits, baked french feta, house pastries and coffee brioche french toast Chicken and biscuits: Definitely a more ""refreshing"" chicken and biscuits than I'm accustomed to. I finished all of it and didn't feel disgustingly full. The chicken to biscuits ratio was a bit small, but the poached egg on top definitely made up for it. The black peppered gravy was really good and not too heavy. It was either the peanuts or the bacon that added a little crunch to the dish. Loved the kale and the candied yams that were super soft. All around great dish and highly reccomend.  Baked French Feta: Great starter! The jalepeno flavor in the oil is very subtle as is the basil. The bread was presoaked with some oil, but still crispy. But that cheese though MMMMMM. So good, but don't take my word for it, just get it.  Coffee Brioche French Toast: I think I overheard this was recently added to the menu. Everything from the whipped topping, to the coffee sauce wow. The french toast was bursting with flavor, soft, but not drenched and the frosted pecans added a contrasting texture. It didn't stand a chance with our forks! House pastries: We got all four because well why not? What's $4 more?! The boston brown bread was a mix of sweet and salty with chunks of something sweet, maybe raisins? The sourdough cinnamon roll was really good, nice and soft, probably my fav of the four. The spelt cake was like a crumbly coffee cake, not a fsvorite with everyone, but I liked it. And the Tuscan sweet bun was good as well.

They had a delicious cake with a tart jam on top and a cinnamon-like roll. They were all very good. Then I ordered the chickpea tagine and shared the rutabaga soup. Now, don't get my wrong, the chick pea was delicious, but this soup was incredible. I have dreams about this soup. I have mocked up 4 recipes of how I think this soup was made and have made a test kitchen out of my house. But I digress. I also tried the turkey sandwich and the french toast special.

Savory paired with the sweet of the week: daily French toast or pancake option for shared dessert and you'll understand why there's a line.

I appreciate that they offer so many unique, seasonal options for vegetarians. Thanks to our waiter for suggesting a great bottle of wine to accompany the meal! The meal started with a small portion of the BBQ spaghetti squash, which happened to be my favorite dish of the night. Next was a soup course, braised cabbage, and dumplings. The dumplings might have been my favorite, but a bit too salty--especially after three heavily-seasoned, savory courses. Next was a tasty cheese course. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the dessert, butterscotch pudding--not a pudding fan, but seems like a weird way to end a tasting menu. Give me a light sorbet or give me a decadent cake/mouse, but the pudding was just kind of blah...Am I crazy? Pudding is boring, right? My only other gripe was the pacing of the meal.

Our server - Tim - was *terrific* (at the risk of embarrassing him if he ever reads this review, let me say that he was very sweet-natured) and he was also very attentive.  I complimented the manager afterwards (Jade) and she was very friendly.  Everyone else seemed real friendly, also. The restaurant has been there for seventeen years and the interior is lovely - including the ceilings - and it has a romantic ambiance.  Apparently reservations are a good idea, but fortunately we arrived at a rather early hour and therefore we were able to get a table without waiting.

This is what every all day cafes should live up to.  Many years ago I had tomato marmalade with eggs and arugula for breakfast.  Back then that was inventive and they are still doing real food.  Farm to table food without needed to talk about it.  Their farm dinners are amazing and so are their collaborations.  The chefs and owners here seem to care about the industry.  Forever fan!,0.8622,0.879,0.121,0.0,0.5333333333333333

When all the ingredients work together, Lula can be amazingly good, but last night, it was again just a meh..... again, I kept going back because I appreciate the fact they do care about food but as far as the menu, I really have to cross figures and hope its worth to spend the money this time...

We live nearby and it is so fantastic to have a great place we can order in from with fresh, innovative, delicious food. We have only tried a handful of items as the takeout menu is abbreviated.  Beet bruschetta is a must.  We typically order the BB, the Asian noodle dish, the soup of the day, and an additional option based on what is available. Everything is fresh and flavorful and really just great. The soups revolve around seasonal ingredients, and I have not had one that I have not loved (well except the corn chowder, it was really good but I am weird about corn). I am currently in denial about the seasonal change, however their tomato soup with the fantastic bread on a cold rainy evening reminded me that good things are still to come.

2016-08-23,4.0,"KenScale: 8.5/10 What are some of the most iconic restaurants in Chicago, which on a per-square mile basis can stand on its own against any other heavy hitting restaurant cities in the world? There are a number of trailblazing restaurants that have shaped the culinary history of the Windy City. Logan Square has been one of the centers of gravity in Chicago dining in recent years, and much of that can be traced back to the opening of Lula Café more than 16 years ago. In the center of American Midwest, the commitment to locally sourced, farm-to-table cuisine was not something that occupied the culinary sensibility of people historically and yet Lula Café is considered one of the pioneers that achieved this tremendous feat. Whenever I visited Chicago, Lula Café was always on my list of restaurants I've been meaning to check out, but oftentimes other restaurants went higher up my list. On this weekend trip to the Windy City, I was determined to make it to this iconic restaurant for brunch. It was definitely one of the better brunches I've had in recent memory. Anyone who has followed my restaurant reviews will know how much I personally avoid brunch. Does Lula Café, which is still considered one of the best brunch places in the city, live up to its hype? Absolutely! What the restaurant does very well is attention to details and doing little things right for a delightful meal. The moment I saw the beautiful assortment of house pastries, I knew that the kitchen wasn't playing safe. My favorite was the plum caramel coffee cake that was delicious yet not overly sweet, but the blackberry peach kolache and zuccihini chocolate walnut muffin were not far behind. The ""It"" brunch dish at Lula Café seems to be the beautiful pile of cornbread French toast that is accompanied by peaches, butterscotch, brown sugar pecans and lemon yogurt. I really liked the fact that, despite its appearance, the French toast was not overly sweet and the combination of ingredients worked together in harmony. My girlfriend, who is partial to anything that tastes sweet, couldn't stop digging it. The best dish of our meal, however, was the simple-looking ""The Royale,"" a breakfast sandwich of heirloom tomato, speck ham, fontina, sunny side egg and lettuce on house made focaccia. You don't truly appreciate this dish until you take your first bite. The freshness of the ingredients and the marvelous way they come together inside the focaccia bread was truly magnificent that I had to figure out what kind of magic the kitchen worked up its sleeve. Definitely one of the best brunch dishes I've had all year! Lula Café doesn't take reservations during weekend brunch times and it is still one of the hottest tickets during those times; a friend of mine who lives in Chicago warned me that a 2-hour long wait is not uncommon. Fortunately, the weather was not quite nice that day and we had no problem getting seated immediately at the counter area next to the bar. There are also outdoor options during the summer season. I absolutely enjoyed the laid back vibe of summer weekend in Chicago where a lot of young, handsome crowds in jeans, yoga pants and summer dresses came out to have a good time, complementing their brunch with libations in the brunch cocktail and beer sections. I'm really glad I made a visit to Lula Café; for all its hype, it does deliver the good with thoughtful execution based on simple yet wonderful combination of fresh ingredients.",0.9984,0.765,0.179,0.056,0.5327380952380951

It wasn't particularly special but it was fresh and perfect for brunch My buddy was more daring and ordered the cornbread french toast. Since rhubarb was in season it was served with a rhubarb syrup. He has some nostalgia about rhubarb and interestingly some of the restaurants we enjoyed the three days we were in Chicago had some variant of a cocktail or meal that used rhubarb so he was pleasantly surprised.  I definitely think he ordered the best of the two meals.  From the drink menu I enjoyed the Bait and Switch which was quite refreshing and my buddy ordered the waking up the willemsted I believe.

2016-07-15,5.0,"There's not much to say that hasn't been said: Lula's is THE best brunch in Chicago. Excellent food, service, and ambiance. Having recently moved away from Chicago, I already miss it dearly. I usually drive there and can usually find parking, even though the farmer's market is right around the corner. Depending on your party size, wait time is usually 45 minutes or so during peak Sunday brunch. There's a bookstore a few doors down that's perfect for killing time, or the farmer's market is right there. Now the food: Even if you're more of a savory breakfast fan, I recommend trying one (or all three) of their bakery trio options. My boyfriend almost always gets the Royale (a constantly changing breakfast sandwich) while I opt for whatever vegetarian special they have. Their weekly special menus always have at least one out-of-this-world vegetarian option, so this place is great for vegetarians and carnivores alike! My favorite thing I ever got was a tamale topped with a poached egg and lots of seasonal local veggies. Most recently I got the cornbread french toast, and weeks later my mouth is still watering just thinking about it. I've only ordered off their regular menu once, but wasn't too impressed by the breakfast burrito-- it had a little too much potato and not enough variety for my liking. That being said, it was still good, just not as good as I'm used to from Lula's...they've set the bar pretty darn high!

2016-07-05,5.0,"Very solid all-around experience. The wait for a table was surprisingly short considering we went during the Sunday brunch rush while the Logan Square Farmers' Market was happening just a few blocks away. It probably helped that we were only 2 people, but still - kudos to the quick turnover of tables. The specialty tea was delicious and plentiful. My wife ordered the mint green, and I ordered the blood orange green. Both are great choices. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her cornbread french toast. She said the cornbread added a good savory flavor to keep the berries and syrup from being overly sweet. Overall, she said it was a great combination of flavors. I had the breakfast burrito which was just as enjoyable. The eggs in it were very fresh and fluffy, and the various other ingredients were equally fresh and tasty (avocado, potatoes, peppers, cheese). Both orders were large enough to be filling without making you feel stuffed to the point of sickness. Granted, you might have more self control than me and can simply put the fork down when you're full, so you might not have this problem.  To top it off - service was top notch. Our waitress was very friendly. She kept our drinks full and tended to us without hovering or being annoying. We will definitely be coming back.",0.9952,0.731,0.234,0.034,0.47798866213151936

Some of the items include uncommon ingredients but they never make you feel dumb for asking questions. They also never rush you so take your time with your dinner, special occasion celebration, etc.  We have started with the BAKED FRENCH FETA (jalapeno-basil oil, marinated olives, cucumber, grilled bread) both times. It is SO GOOD. The combination of spicy jalapeno, crisp cucumber, warm feta and baked bread, lemon juice and parsley. Highly recommend it. We also had the beets which were delicious, served with dill.  I had the QUESADILLA (spiced winter squash, ricotta, guajillo chile, queso fresco) and a side of the kale as my meal. it was beautifully presented and very tasty.

2016-04-18,5.0,"After going to Lula many times for brunches, lunches and dinners, I do declare it one of my favorite restaurants in the city. It's a little pricey and the wait can get crazy during weekend brunch, but the food is always incredibly fresh and downright delicious, as well as the service always being respectable. Lula Cafe is known for it's brunch but I tend to think their dinner is where they shine. Their brunch is great, don't get me wrong. You just will end up waiting - sometimes a very long time. For example, on Sunday my friends and I were quoted a 20-25 minute wait and ended up waiting a full hour. As someone who used to host, I can't imagine being so far off in my estimate of the wait as there is usually a good system to figure out the estimates to give customers.  Either way, the brunch menu is by no means expansive but you'll surely find several things that suit your fancy. I've only had good dishes for brunch but for dinner - I've only had beyond delicious meals. Plus, you usually don't have a wait in the evening. I'd love to give you some recommendations but because Lula uses seasonal ingredients and constantly is updating their menu, whatever I told you was fabulous this past weekend, you probably won't find on their menu next week.  I do have to say that their pasta dishes are always phenomenal! Any dish that features vegetables as the main attraction is also always on point. You really can't go wrong with anything if you go to Lula's so get something that has ingredients you love and I'm sure you'll be pleased. Because all their veggie dishes are so great, this carnivore always shocks herself by ordering a couple on each visit to share with the table. They are just TOO GOOD to pass up! Aside from the fabulous food, service is usually stupendous at Lula. The staff is all very well versed in the menu - even with it constantly changing. They can easily give you recommendations and educate you on ingredients you aren't familiar with. Every time I've gone to Lula, I've learned about some fun new food elements I've never heard of prior!  Lula Cafe is good for brunch if you'd like to wait quite awhile and don't mind that there is no patio. But I highly recommend you hit them up for dinner and try as much as you possibly can! It's a good date spot though it can get a bit loud and good with smaller sized groups of 6 and under.

A friend and I sat down for breakfast, in hopes of catching up. Once our food was delivered, our server made a point of stopping by every 10 minutes to reach across the table, pick up the water carafe sitting next to us, and refill our water glasses with 1/2 inch of water.  Besides interrupting the conversation with my friend, this sort of defeats the purpose of having a carafe on the table for self service.  Our meals were 25% finished and I had a full drink. Our server stopped by the table and rudely interrupted to say ""Are you done with that or do you want a box?"" My friend requested the box and minutes later the check appeared on our table. I looked at my watch. It had been 40 minutes since we sat down and maybe 20 since our food had arrived.

For dessert, we split the gingerbread pudding cake - which was good.  Not my favorite dessert out there, but still quite good.

Décor: It's a cool little spot that has a bunch of tables and, while unassuming from the outside, is actually quite large inside. The lighting is set low, to set a very relaxed and chill mood, and the ambiance reflects the same. It certainly has a bit of a hipster vibe (not a bad thing), which I tend to like a lot. Bathroom: clean and well kept Staff: Keeping with the hipster vibe is the staff (again, not a bad thing). Everyone was very nice and our waitress was super laid-back and helpful with any questions we had about the menu. Drinks/Food: We started with a few cocktails, names of which I cannot recall - but they were all house-made and very tasty, and then moved onto some apps. We had the Steak Tartar (I have always been nervous to try this but it was fantastic!) and the Roasted Cauliflower (so so SO GOOD!) and then moved onto dinner. Again, I can't remember exactly what we all had but I had the trout (which was decent, flavoring was a bit odd), someone had pasta (which they very much enjoyed), the stuffed cabbage (tasty), and... something else. Anyway, the food was overall tasty but I think everyone enjoyed the apps more than the entrees. We did not end up getting dessert.

A friend and I split the breakfast burrito which is hands down the best one I have ever had. You can tell the ingredients are all freshly prepared and made to order. The ingredients in the burrito, especially the farm sausage are immaculate and topped with an amazing salsa verde and optional sour cream. We also split pancakes with oreos crushed on top which I believe was a daily special and they were absolutely delicious.

He loved the pancakes and loved the attention a duo of grandmas were giving him (not going to brag but my son is a real charmer)  I opted for the pistachio crusted brioche french toast (with Klug farm raspberries and white chocolate creme anglaise).  This was amazing.  It's 4 triangle slices of perfectly cooked french toast.  A bit nutty and a bit sweet.  I would have loved more raspberries, but that's just me, I love fresh raspberries.  I also got a side of house breakfast sausage to split with my son and I am not exaggerating when I say it was the best breakfast sausage I have ever had. Locally sourced, made to order, super flavorful and well-cooked.   If my son wants the last piece of anything, I will always give it to him without a second thought. But this was the first time my heart sank when he asked for more and more of the breakfast sausage until it was down to the last bite. It was soooooo good. The iced coffee was perfection, the service was wonderful.  The space on the patio is close quarters but I'd still recommend it while the Chicago weather cooperates.",0.9983,0.771,0.226,0.003,0.5195868945868947

2015-07-12,3.0,"It was really hard to decide on a 2 or 3 star rating which is so sad bc we had HIGH expectations for our first visit here. We waited an hour to be sat which we understood given it was prime brunch time on a summer Sunday.  We got seated and were greeted quickly by our waitress. We always like to ask for recommendations and actually ended up ordering both that she suggested. Luckily we ordered the new quesadilla on the menu because we were unhappy with both of our entree choices. I will say the menu said ricotta for the quesadilla and I swear it was more of a cotija/quest fresco.  My boyfriend got the bean and short rib dish and the meat was just not good and the menu should have specified this was a cubed short rib. It was like cubed meat in a can soup. He definitely expected a more savory egg and whole piece of short rib. I ordered the 'finally summer' which although good and I ate it all I was excited about some of the ingredients that didn't really come through (ie chestnut butter and the sorel of sorel cream. Overall the menu items and concept looks amazing I just don't think it came through in the dishes.

Try the Bunny Slope cocktail if you'd like a savory drink but not necessarily a Bloody Mary. Good coffee, and BF enjoyed the strawberry kolache. I also liked the atmosphere, which is relaxed and almost diner-like--it's very cute! Service was also good.   Bads: The main dishes(womp). Here's the breakdown: -Nearly Summer: More like nearly warm. The dish seemed lukewarm when it got to my mouth. The cheese on top of the biscuits was starting to congeal after being melted. Loved the pickled rhubarb, but there were only a few pieces on the dish. The biscuits seemed tough to me--not stale, but just not soft or crumbly. I didn't like that. The soft boiled egg, though, was cooked to perfection.  -Breakfast Burrito: BF had this. Honestly, it wasn't cooked badly, it was just super-bland. The last thing the BF and I want from a burrito is blandness. It was also on the lukewarm side.  Lula--gotta step up your act on those mains. Although the cocktails and service and atmosphere were great, if you can't make good food, I'm not going to be back.

2015-04-14,4.0,"When you go out to eat with your boo and said 'boo' gets unreasonably angry with you for ordering more food than one person can possibly consume, even when you're the one paying for it (and it's widely known that you're a lover of left-overs). Deal-breaker.  Not only a deal-breaker, but also a common trait of all 3 of the dudes I've ever dated. I don't understand why it's so upsetting when I order multiple entrees and apps for myself or when we leave from having dinner at one restaurant and I immediately want to go have dinner at another restaurant even when I'm paying for my and their meals, but for some reason it is. It really, really is.  This is an important part of the story because on the night I came to Lula Cafe with my boo we'd already just had dinner at another nearby establishment and the intention was just to get a drink and maybe a small plate and/or dessert, but the plan changed, at least in my mind, when I saw that Lula Cafe proudly offers a hearty 6-course vegetarian tasting menu for a pretty nominal, all things considered, $48.  I was pretty pumped to get this item but I had a feeling my so called boo would be non-plussed with my second stomach's new desire right after our first dinner elsewhere so when he asked me what I was getting, I named off two appetizers and casually said, ""and maybe something else; it'll be a game-time decision.""... meaning that I was still going to order those two appetizers I'd mentioned but then I'd also tack the 6-course tasting menu on the end only when the server came so that ""my person"" wouldn't throw a conniption fit at me beforehand because I know said person is better behaved when put on the spot in front of strangers. So I was a little shady about how I was going to order it, but honestly, it's crazy that I should even have to do that when I want food and I'm paying for it all. I mean, b*tches gots to eat and all things considered, I ask for very little in a relationship beyond companionship, being able to Netflix marathon 6 nights a week, and just letting me order whatever the f*ck I want, so I feel like it's not much to hope the person I'm sitting across from will just STFU and let me revel in my food piles like the true midwestern woman that I am.     So anyway, after I placed the order the vibe at our table was about as no chill as it could possibly get. I was definitely dealing with the adult version of a total meltdown from my dining partner who had face-melting levels of rage visibly sweeping through his body... all over a f*cking vegetarian tasting menu order, of all things. I think our server sensed the tension and made it a point to give our gauntlet, er, I mean table some space, though I'm sure it was hard since there were 8 different dishes that needed to be brought to the table now.  The general mood for sure put a damper on the dining experience, though to no fault of Lula's, and to be honest, it was hard to really think back on what dishes were memorable over the downward tone of the evening but each dish was beautifully plated, colorful, and while none were really stand-outs, for $48 it was a steal.  I know that if I make my way back I'll be tempted to do the tasting again only because I'm such a fan of having lots of different dishes of food come to my table, but I think that if you want the exceptional Lula experience that I'd heard so much about that coming for brunch and/or getting individual entrees are where you'll find the most stand-out dishes.  There's often a wait but if you can nab a spot at their beautiful bar you'll be in business until your table is ready and just be sure to go with someone who loves you for the glutton you are so you don't end up the loneliest person to ever have 8-plates of food in front of them.",0.9916,0.82,0.118,0.062,0.5935876623376625

We met a friend for brunch and I got the Chestnut Polenta: celery root, celery, swiss chard, parmesan, lime, topped with a soft boiled egg. I figured I would love it or hate it. I LOVED it. So tasty without any one ingredient overpowering the others (was kind of worried about the parmesan cheese which can be strong). The staff and servers were friendly and helpful. They heard it was my birthday and brought out a large slice of their delicious apple cream cheese coffee cake with a lighted candle on the plate. So sweet!! I'm glad my son lives in the neighborhood.

2015-03-15,5.0,"This place was truly exceptional. Brunch is the most important meal to me, and I eat at a lot of brunch places, and can honestly say this is the best I've had in a long time. I almost want to say I didn't really remember what I was missing until Lula Cafe reminded me. They don't take reservations, but the wait for a table was only 30 minutes and the bar area is first come first serve. The bartenders are attentive to waiting customers, and make sure you get a drink for while you stand waiting if you want one. We chose to grab spots at the bar, and had great service. The bartender was quick, gave solid/detailed recommendations, and even let me try a cocktail I thought sounded good (without my even asking - he just used a straw to take a sample from a shaker he had just made a drink in and put it in a glass for me to try). It was a tequila/lime/chartreuse cocktail which I got with mezcal instead. Very smoky and VERY delicious. The bloody mary was ok - tasty mix - but separated a lot, so you have to continuously stir or you feel like you're just drinking vodka.  For the food: i got the Royale breakfast sandwich: short rib, watercress, cheddar, cumin aioli, poached egg and orange jam. I was skeptical about the orange jam but it all worked together superbly. One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had in a long time. My boyfriend got the frijoles charros, even though I tried to talk him out of it (because he always gets Mexican brunch dishes and this place didn't seem Mexicuisine focused), but I'm glad he did! The chips were a great texture complement to the beans, and the sweet potato (which i wouldn't have expected) worked really well.  All around a really great experience. My only regret is that we didn't try this place sooner!u",0.9944,0.781,0.181,0.038,0.594107744107744

2015-03-08,5.0,"It's been almost 10 years since I lived in Chicago. (Wow, now acutely aware of the passage of time and all that jazz.) And during my recent visit to Chicago, a friend, who now lives there, asked if there is a restaurant that I remember from my time there that I would like to go back to.  One dish stuck out in my mind: this awesome feta and cinnamon pasta dish. I remembered that I got it at a restaurant that was named after a woman and on the northwest side of town. I had only been there once before I moved out of Chicago. I think I went within a couple weeks of my move.  (If only I had been a Yelper back then, and then I would have been able to just go to my Yelp page and look it up. File that under ""Things I Wish I Had Known."") Anyway, a few minutes Yelp sleuthing later, we figured out that I was talking about Lula Cafe in Logan Square, and the dish is Pasta Yiayia, which contains bucatini, cinnamon, feta, garlic and brown butter. And it was delicious, inventive, as great as I had remembered. The fact that this dish stood out after moves to two different states, a few jobs and countless other great meals later really says a lot. And the memories were definitely merited.  The cinnamon plays off the creaminess of the feta, and yet, this dish still has a savoriness to it. I haven't seen these mix of ingredients elsewhere.  And on top of a great meal, Lula's atmosphere was spot on. It is cozy and great for taking a friend for catching up. It would also be a great date spot.  Lula's Cafe has also expanded since I lived in the area, which was great to see.  My friend and I also shared the chai custard tart -- again, such a creative pairing of flavors that worked so well together that it made me wonder why more restaurants don't do this.  Lula's Cafe is just steps from the Logan Square stop on the Blue Line. Really, you don't have any excuses not to check this place out if you're in Chicago.  Now that I know the name of the restaurant from my memories, I'll be sure to go back on my next trip.",0.9962,0.824,0.165,0.01,0.5226726726726727
2015-03-08,4.0,"Lula has a quaint, friendly, most-definitely-hipster feel. 3.5 stars, rounding up for our very friendly, attentive server. We had: Pecan crusted brioche french toast ($12): Extra thick cut brioche with candied pecans, warm pear, and ginger mascarpone creme anglaise. Just sweet enough and the ginger mascarpone was delicious, I wish there had been more of it. Green pozole ($14): I wasn't sure exactly what I was expecting when I ordered the pozole, but I really enjoyed it. The hominy was light but very flavorful, the pork shoulder was tender and the pickled onions and radishes made for a nice bite. The fried tortilla round was the perfect addition, I could definitely eat this for breakfast/brunch regularly. If anything, I wish it was a little spicier and saltier. The Royale ($16): A breakfast sandwich with sliced leg of lamb and provolone and french dip. I had a few bites, and it was a solid choice, the lamb was good but the pickled ramps and melted provolone were the highlight. I don't know what they did to the fingerling potatoes served on the side, but they were incredible plain and had a flavor I couldn't quite place. Yes, I think brunch at Lula is overhyped, but it was still much more creative than your typical Wildberry/Yolk. It's also one of the few places where I think the flavors of farm-to-table philosophy actually come through in the simple preparation of fresh ingredients.

2014-12-15,4.0,"YUM!! And glad we got here at 10:30am on a Sunday since this party of 2 only waited 5 minutes for a table! Score!! So yes, plan your arrival time here carefully for brunch since they don't take reservations during brunch and this place fills up really really fast. As it should, because the food here is great. And their drip coffee I couldn't get enough of either! We started splitting all three of their house pastries: raspberry and pistachio bostock, stollen, and apple cream cheese coffee cake. All were good, but the stollen was my least favorite of the three. But at $4 each or all three for $10 you kind of have to try all three at that point. I ordered the baked cannellonni which was sweeter than I thought it was going to be, but it was baked and stuff with a pureed mixture of celery root, sunflower seeds, sage, squash, and topped with a sunny side egg and some greens and the super tasty and crispy guanciale bites of love. Those little bites of saltiness were the perfect addition to the dish. My friend got the pozole brunch special which was a nice soup with braised pork shoulder, pepitas, avocado crema, egg, radishes, the works. And it had some crispy tortillas served in it too, and had lots of flavor.

For our main dish, I had the burrito which is a good option but I would really recommend the lentil squash dish that my friend ordered.

We have a child that needed high chair and that was handled really fast before we even sat down.   Brunch is best served with company and I thought it was descent for having a conversation yet still very vibrant.   I ordered the pazole and the French toast off their specials menu.  It was definitely good and ideal for cooler weather.  My one minor criticism is that the French toast was served on a metal pan, which left a metallic after taste.   Otherwise it was a flawless brunching adventure.   Parking is fairly easy, either meters or street parking around the blvd.   Worth a check if you're in that brunching kind of mood during the wet, cold misery that is Chicago.",0.9792,0.77,0.194,0.036,0.46802622498274676

2014-11-11,5.0,"I could write songs about my love for Lula. I love Lula. I love it. Some other popular brunch spots in the area only have heavy, heavy (butter! creamy! super decadent!) dishes, and while Lula has their fair share of these things, they also always have lighter, veggie-based options that are equally delicious, even if you're a meat lover like me. Everything they're doing there just kicks it up a notch. The beet bruschetta is beyond, but it's hard to pinpoint exact favorites from the menu - the menu changes regularly based on what's in season (love that), and literally everything I've eaten here, I've enjoyed. Good ambiance, great food, no pretension ... it's a fantastic spot. The ONLY downside to Lula is the incredibly long wait at brunch, and sometimes at dinner, too. They do take reservations, but if you're looking for a quick brunch hit this is not the place (but honestly, such is the case for any worthwhile brunch spot in Logan).

It's like they understand everything that yuppies want (sorry not sorry if you hate the term but you know I'm right), stuff it on their menu, make it taste OUTSTANDING, and at a great price point. Yes! I will definitely go back. I'm all about this place. My friend and I got the fried green tomatoes with polenta, spagghetti squash, and perhaps the best egg I've ever had in my life. It's cooked so perfectly that when you break into that golden yolk, the heavenly goodness oozes out and drenches the rest of the platter. In the best way possible. Every mouthful was bliss. Truly.  But... my favorite part was the bread pudding french toast. Probably 1000 calories per bite and I'll probably see a rim around my midsection that did not exist before, but is it worth it? Hell yes. The bread is soaked in this eggy goodness but what I loved most is the crunchy sweet topping and the poached apples that goes with it.

2014-10-27,5.0,"The food here tastes good. I wouldn't go here again because it's too expensive (after tip, almost $40 a person - I can buy a new copy of the Wii U Video Game, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker for that much and it will last me 15 hours and also demonstrate some new use of 3D space in game design). But that's not a problem exclusive to Lula Cafe. Who is Lula? I got a free meal here after wading through a reasonable, and unexpected Halloween parade, fronted by an obnoxious marching band. The bass drum resonated through the walls of Lula Cafe up until we received free bread. There was a trumpet who saw it fit to play at least a 16-measure solo in some scale that was definitely from a country in Africa or the Middle East. There didn't seem to be many people from those countries, so this felt a bit odd. You get free bread here, and I think you can ask for infinite free bread - come here to stock up for bread. It reminds me of this one game where you got free bread, but only if you used your previous bread. That might apply to Lula Cafe, too.  The game didn't have butter though, Lula Cafe did. Once the butter didn't have honey, then the next time it did. It might have had it the first time and I didn't notice it. Life goes on. I forgot what we ordered. I counted 25 words I didn't know - I learned what semifreddo means. Actually, I forgot. But it's likely a cold dessert. Most stuff here tastes good, but it's so dark that you can't see anything that you are eating - just kidding, except actually we did use a flashlight to see our food a bit before we ate it. the food here is good. so is the dessert. I got the Rye Crepe for dessert. wow, that was a nice crepe. It had goat milk ice cream - goat milk ice cream for the most part is just like sweet cream ice cream except that it tastes like cheese in the end. Brie cheese....maybe. Not sure.  Our waitstaff was super nice. I was cranky initially because of the marching band (it reminded me of aspects of high school.) The sound ambience is really loud. I'm convinced the walls were built with the maximum ability to reflect sound waves - people didn't even seem to be talking that loud and the music wasn't that loud either, but it was this maelstrom of voices, some sort of indie music, dishes and glasses clanking, and for part of the meal, outdoors noise. This is definitely a 'romantic' restaurant. Thanks to the low lighting, your imagination will fill in the finer details of your dining partner's face. My imagination filled in the finer details of my parents' faces and one other person who I see quite often. You will probably need a reservation. We got a reservation for 4 people at 6 PM on a Sunday. There were no open slots around it. It's cozy and dimly lit. There are people drinking wine and looking happy and dressed very well.  You can order a bottle of PBR for $2.50 here. I didn't do this, my dad did. I thought this was sort of funny. I haven't tried it myself but sometimes people build identities partially on drinking it /not drinking it. My dad sad it tasted like a Coors Light. My college roommate said Bud Light tastes like trash, and if Bud Light and Coors Light are like Pepsi and Coke, then by some mathematical principle, I guess that PBR would taste like trash if I agreed with my college roommate's taste preferences.",0.998,0.821,0.157,0.022,0.5447092352092353

I honestly think this place is a little overhyped and that you can get a much better brunch for your money. It gets pretty crowded, too...so don't expect a very quiet meal here. Not that I mind the busy-ness, but I'm just saying. I guess it adds to the brunch experience too right? I just felt like we were there for too long, that's all. I wanted to be different and ordered the spaghetti for brunch. It's made with sweet and spicy chile 'salsa rossa,' bacon, and queso fresco. Quite simple, and simple can be delicious. But I think I was expecting it to be like AMAZEBALLS pasta, like what you get at Eataly or something. But I dunno..it was easily forgettable. I can't even remember what it tasted like. It's only been like a week. My boo ordered the breakfast burrito, which sounded promising. When it came out, we all looked at it like...""That's it???"" It was a sad little excuse for a breakfast burrito. :( I like mine with lots of meat, cheese, eggs...you know. All the trimmings! Maybe they're catering to a different crowd, but for me...I like legit meals with lots of flavor, textures, and complementing combination of ingredients.",0.991,0.755,0.208,0.037,0.6673333333333334
2014-10-01,3.0,"At the recommendation of a local in a coffee shop, and as a consistent purveyor of farm to rable/organic eats when I travel, I came to Lula's door with high hopes. On the culinary side, I was not let down. The menu of both food and drinks was delightful; the food was fresh, tasty, well seasoned and over all quite good.  The service, however, left much to be desired.  My waitress was fine; slightly pretentious, but overall she was just fine.  The remainder of the staff was unimpressive and unprofessional. The hosts/hostesses/bussers, seemed to stand together and gossip like a gaggle of geese. The prime suspects were a hipster looking bunch, two gents and one girl,  who stood gossiping about their boss (Or whomever it is creating their weekly schedule) and other frivolous things about their lives. I sat on the cafe side quite close to the host stand so I understand being in earshot, but perhaps at least have respectful conversation.  They spoke awkwardly of a customer who was still seated, albeit outside, but still. This I found to be very professional.  But the cream of the crop for me was when I was regarded by one of the hosts while I was in the process of breastfeeding my very quiet and peaceful 3 month old daughter while simultaneously enjoying my bruschetta. He said, to one of his fellow cohorts in crime, ""ugh gross, I can't even look"" and then turned and walked away. It was in that moment that I was reminded that I am, undoubtedly, in the Midwest, where the collective mind is about as open as a casket at your dead  grandmother's funeral.   Oh Lula, with your modern and chiq interior, your music that brought me back to Express for Men circa 2002, and your overly pretentious staff (which seemed to number than the number of patrons at your restaurant); your food is so tasty, your location ideal, and your concept is a good one.

I'm vegetarian and my boyfriend is not but there were so many options - we both ordered the veggie options. The woman I spoke to at the restaurant several times was extremely accommodating - I had to change my reservation twice and they made it work. They called when I was late - I was a bad customer - but they made me feel like my reservation was important to them. They were willing to work with adding friends to the table after dinner for drinks - although we didn't end up doing that - they gave me options.

I love the atmosphere of this restaurant.  Very relaxed, but very reverent.   We were greeted by Katie, who was truly gracious and attentive.  Then, decided to sit at the Bar and were served by Celina. Celina was as pre-eminent as she was interesting.  We ordered two of the craft-cocktails (Secret Garden - my favorite, and Flanders' Spritz) that were amazing.  She clearly celebrates the chef's creations, of which she took us on a relaxed, perfectly timed, guided tour.  We opened with a quesadilla - sounds a little pedestrian, but what an over-achiever - the tortilla's were amazing.  Next we ordered the nest of green beans with chickpea fritters, and sweet and sour chanterelles.  They flavors were really complex - fenugreek in the the chantrelles and the birch syrup and egg in the green beans made them sublime. I had to try the Squid and Sweet Corn - what a great combination, the umami of the grilled squid, combined with the sweet melon and the earthy huitlacoche - a dish that all of your taste buds celebrate. The Red Snapper was the piece di resistance!  A stunning composition of textures and flavors that did not overcome the fish.  Annato seasoning, Spanish chorizo, and bouillabaisse broth really transform this dish into something both sophisticated and swarthy. For desert - the Rye Crepe.  Nutty rye, sweet fruit, and pungent goat milk custard and goat milk ice cream - an astonishing finale.   This was only my second visit to Lula's - an unfortunate detail that I fully intend to remedy.

Great staff, knowledgeable as hell and just as friendly, they helped us parry down the menu to a couple of indecision that we had.  I choose the Red Snapper as an entree, with the bird's nest appetizer and a side of spice cole slaw. Excellent flavors all around.  I think the bird's nest appetizer was actually the table favorite.  The cole slaw was also great, made with spicy sesame or chili oil (or both?), and the red snapper was cooked to perfection (crispy edges, moist center), if a little on the skimpy side. The Mascarpone ice cream cake had a rasberry drizzle and some sunflower crisp granola type clusters that made my head spin - it was that good. The table kind of fought over it.

2014-08-30,1.0,"RIDICULOUS HIPSTER NONSENSE! I came here last night with a group of 5 people.  We had been drinking cocktails at a bar down the street, and were ready for some delicious, filling food.  We thought Lula's would hit the spot. O innocence!  O folly!  WE WERE FOOLS!!! First of all, you walk inside, and the interior of Lula's doesn't feel like a proper restaurant.  It feels like a messy house where some art school students live-- and they are ""playing restaurant"" for the evening.  (This sense of amateurish play will linger for the entire meal. . .until you get the bracingly enormous bill, which will be all too REAL.) Next, the servers:  They are not attired like servers.  They have not even bothered to dress up.  This largely renders them indistinguishable from the patrons.  Want to flag down a waiter?  Your guess is as good as mine, amigo.  That guy with the beard might just run the fixie shop next door....   AND THE AFFECTED MUMBLING!!!  The servers will fail to speak clearly at almost every turn, and also fail to look you in the eyes and smile.  (To be clear, I believe folks with developmental disorders on the linguistic and cognitive spectrum SHOULD be gainfully employed...just not as waiters.) You feel like you just ran over their cat!  What else explains being treated so affectedly and oddly?  Ridiculous! The next offence comes in the form of the menu.  It's written like a not-very-bright high school student's college admission essay, with ""thesaurus words"" unnecessarily thrown in right and left in hopes of appearing impressive.  Yet one can only burnish brass so much... The food, when it arrives, will be uncontaminated by verve or innovation.  There will also not be a lot of it.  If you've, say, had some cocktails and are ready for something yummy and filling for dinner, you may find yourself stopping for an Italian beef on the way home.   Finally, the reckoning:  Five people.  One bottle of wine.  $300 before tip.  Zounds!

Looking over the menu my dining mate and myself just... couldn't.. get... excited.  Over anything. It was weird. Nothing on the menu started the happy slavering that getting brunch usually induces in me.  And I hadn't eaten anything all day and was starving.  Eventually I settled on the New Potato and Summer Squash Hash.  My friend ordered the Breakfast Burrito.  When our food came out, her burrito came out rather unadorned on a plate with a side of sour cream.  It looked a little sad... and small.  She ate maybe three quarters of it and just gave up saying ""I think I could have made this at home... and I don't cook much.""  My meal was actually pretty tasty... but again... not something I would order again.  It was really saucy.. something that I didn't expect from the ""hash"" description.  The flavors were good, the fresh corn in the dish was a nice touch.  But it was almost soupy which I wasn't expecting.  Again, not bad, just not something that I would NEED to eat again.  It also came out a little hotter than lukewarm which wasn't super appealing.

The food tastes fresh and delicious. From the decor to the service to the staff, this quirky small spot has a very laid back bohemian/hipster vibe. I really enjoy the art that is exhibited throughout the restaurant. Just like the changing menu, the small art exhibition changes every season, and every visit I am always looking forward what next art is curated into Lula's space.  My favorite on the usual menu is the CLASSIC LULA BREAKFAST BURRITO ($9 avocado, onion, green chile, tomato, potato, organic eggs, cheddar) which gives you a nice boost for the day. Also Lula offers a breakfast sandwich series called THE ROYALE ($16) which the ingredients changes up every weekend. The sandwich are pretty solid.  I would say my least favorite is their cafe menu during odd hours. I had the PASTA YIAYIA ($12 bucatini, cinnamon, feta, garlic, brown butter) which was a little underwhelming. Plus the pasta seemed a little overcooked. :/ However, I would totally go to Lula for brunch.  I recommend going a little early before 11am to beat the brunch rush. Even arriving 10:45pm makes a huge difference. However, the wait isn't unbearable long. If you don't mind rubbing shoulders with strangers, snag a spot near the bar.

2014-08-07,5.0,"Unexpected perfect experiences deserve their own adjectives. The moment you realize you've accidently stepped into perfection, and you have to adjust your senses to soak it all in... these are experiences that need their own words. Last night, I met a close friend and his 12 year old daughter for dinner. They wanted to explore Logan Square and we basically threw a dart on the map for where we should eat. Lula Cafe was agreed upon with zero research. I plugged our info into open table, and made reservations for an early dinner.  As we approached the front door, it became apparent we were in for something special. The decor and atmosphere was amazing. Such an oddball mix of materials and vintage objects expertly mixed to provide the perfect amount of quirk.  We perused the menu and ordered a round of drinks. Our lovely waitress Giavanna described the ""Flander's Spritz"" as refreshing, and she was correct. It was delightful, with it's interesting mix of different shaped ice cubes and a great tang.  We started with an artisan cheese plate. It wasn't exceptional but was a good sharable way to start our meal. The little bits of fruit were perfect, and it was beautifully plated. Next up was our show stopper entrees. My friend and I both ordered the Halibut collar, and our younger friend ordered Spaghetti Alla Chitarra.  The Halibut is an absolutely 100% perfect dish. The pairing of flavors and textures was such a shock to my tongue, I was instantly in love. The sliced pickled snap peas offered a nice crunch. The brightness of the green coriander offered a high note. The fresh turnips were so delicious. And the lemon curd? I didn't see it coming. The way it was plated, the curd is only on one side, so unless you just stir everything up, the plate offers a variety of notes. It was intensely wonderful. I ordered another cocktail, this time the ""little fun"" which featured whisky, bitters and earl grey tea. Another terrific combination of flavors. I was completely satiated and thought my flavor ride was over. But it wasn't. By a long shot. Our young friend had overdone it with the bread and butter, and had a full plate of Spaghetti to sample. And boy oh boy did we hit it hard. Made with ""burnt"" flour, the combination of porcini, herbs, toasted pine nuts, and sheep's milk feta was out of this world. So tasty with layers upon layers of flavors. The pasta has a delicious bite and springy texture and we all agreed it was literally one of the best pasta dishes we had collectively ever experienced. Unreal. We skipped on dessert due to our overwhelmed palates. I'm sure the dessert is great, but enough is enough already. We walked out of the restaurant with the biggest smiles on our faces.",0.9989,0.762,0.22,0.017,0.6207658033973822
2014-08-06,4.0,"Freaking amazing bread pudding French toast! I had to bite my tongue before I went all Sally at the diner in When Harry Met Sally.  Spoiler alert, I couldn't quite control myself and let a soft moan or two escape while I consumed the most amazing French Toast ever. Yes, my friends.  It is THAT good. I stopped by a few Sundays ago since I was intrigued by their Lemon Bread Pudding French Toast (hereinafter ""LBPFT"").  Unfortunately, they do not take reservations for brunch.  Also, my fiance and I got there during the peak time so we had to wait an hour.  I suppose that isn't bad saying we've waited longer at other brunch places. Thankfully, the Logan Square Farmers Market was just a few minutes away so we hung out there while we waited.  You may (will) be tempted to sample some of the Farmers Market goodies, but resist.  Lula is worth the wait. Now, if you have a sweet tooth (and trust me, mine is probably bigger than yours), you must, must, must get the LBPFT if it's on the menu.  Unfortunately, if you look for it now, you've missed it since they've replaced it with something else.  Your loss. Anyway, the LBPFT was topped with blueberries and a ginger cookie crisp.  Simple ingredients, but it was cooked to perfection and presented in a skillet.  It was also topped with a dollop of crème anglaise.  The slices of bread are thick so you only get two of them.  I ordered that with a side of their thick cut bacon, and I was all set to go.  Though, in retrospect, I wish I would have requested my bacon to be cooked a bit crispier.   I've also tried the Spice Apple Bread Pudding French toast when I visited last fall.  It definitely was the perfect to eat on a crisp, cool Fall day.  Just like the LBPFT, it was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully. Speaking of which, they care about how the food looks like when they put it on the plate.  That's part of what makes them stand out  in the sea of other places you can visit for brunch.  After all, we do eat with our eyes first. Service on both trips was great and our servers were not overbearing.  The only downside is that the music on both trips was a bit too loud for my liking.  It was difficult for me to have a conversation with my fiance.  However, they do have an outdoor patio, which I may try to sit at the next time I visit since it may be a tad quieter. As for me,  I'll be checking out their menu periodically to see what BPFT creations they will offer next.  Right now, it's honey-goat cheese.  I'm sure it's good, but I'm not sure about that one.",0.997,0.779,0.176,0.045,0.5302532123960696

We made a reservation and were seated near the piano in the back room. Service was courteous if a bit delayed due to the patio requirements. As such, we ordered the entire meal at once, but any concerns I had of poorly timed coursing were entirely unfounded. We had the green beans with tomato and fresh egg (her), the gazpacho with scallop and cucumber (me), the poached arctic char (her), and the delectable hangar steak (me). The meal tasted of a farmers' market prepared to perfection. Courses timed exactly, wine recommendations thoughtful and economical, and experience overall superlative. I believe it is only the ""brunch"" reputation of the restaurant that somehow precludes it from the ranks of Michelin and Roses that its neighbors enjoy. The neighborhood welcome of its bar exceeds that of other nearby establishments, which includes some of the greats of the city. We will be back again and again whenever we can enjoy a relaxed seat, and despite it all will still insist on bringing out of town guests to brunch just so they experience a fraction of the lovely experience you have curated here for all of us in logan square.",0.9928,0.798,0.188,0.014,0.5379999999999999

2014-07-24,5.0,"My only regret is that I wish this restaurant was around when I was living in Logan Square during my junior high and high school years. This time I ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad which was complemented with black currant, amaranth, spiced pumpkin seeds and goat cheese vinaigrette. Excellent. I was happy to have amaranth in my salad, because like buckwheat and quinoa, amaranth is an especially high-quality source of plant protein. Amaranth is packed with iron and calcium, and its fiber content is triple that of wheat. I got my fix of protein and fiber from this delectable fresh salad. The sweet and sour taste coalesced into several wonderful flavors. I rate it five stars. Perfection. My friend ordered the Ham and Raclette Panino with fresh farm eggs, black currant mustard and onions on a fresh ciabatta bun. She said it was incredibly delicious and loved the combination of flavors. Her friend ordered the Lula '99 Turkey Sandwich with freshly sliced organic avocado and loaded with chile aioli, sprouts, lettuce, tomato, bacon and onions. It comes with cheddar cheese, but she requested no cheese. The turkey was melt-in-your mouth tender. The crunch of the sprouts and bacon made for the perfect amalgamation. She thought her sandwich was worthy of 5-stars, because it was ""real"" turkey (not the deli kind of turkey that one purchases at the grocery store). We all shared our food (cutting small pieces here and there). I tried the turkey sandwich and the chile aioli kicked it up in the spicy category producing a little bit of heat at the back of my tongue. This was a nice surprise! I increased my rating by one star, so it is now officially a 5-star rating. I rarely give a 5-star rating. There are many factors that I consider when I decide that a place is worthy of 5-stars. In this case, the service was excellent. However, our server  provided some small touches which we appreciated. Sometimes it is the ""small"" things that I notice and appreciate. Our server knew we were planning on sharing our dishes. She brought us extra small plates and placed them in the center of our table. She gave us extra silverware and piled extra napkins on our table. She was incredibly busy, but she made sure that our coffee and water glasses were consistently full. We were impressed by how fast she hustled and how good she was with all of her customers. Thank you! Finally, I have never been here for dinner, but after reading several reviews here regarding ""dinner"" we will definitely try it for dinner. Only next time, I am bringing my husband.

Both my friends got sandwiches and I chose the Pasta Yia Yia ($12) as recommended by fellow Yelpers. It was my first time having bucatini pasta, so I definitely wasn't used to the texture -- that stuff is hard to twirl around a fork! As for the sauce, I can't really say I liked it. Consisting of brown butter, garlic, and feta, the overall taste was overpowered by cinnamon; I'm definitely not used to having cinnamon in my pasta.  Not sure if I'd come back as we happened to find Lula by chance on the train. I'm sure their brunch is fantastic, but their lunch menu just didn't cut it for me.

My girlfriend and I came here on a saturday morning at around 10AM and were seated almost immediately at the front of the restaurant. I've never seen so many babies at brunch before in my life! There were at least 4 or 5 toddlers running around which made for an entertaining wait for our food.  Our server was extremely nice and the patrons next to us recommended we try the specials because Lula is known for em! After much contemplation, we settled on the savory almond crepe and the bread pudding french toast. Both were so unique. The crepe had delicious cheese filling and came topped with carrots and small pieces of lamb. The flavors from all the parts were well balanced and I couldn't get enough. Only part i disliked was that it was a bit on the small side, but still filling. Next came the bread pudding french toast which was like heaven. It looked like a square yellow sponge cake and it had a nice soft texture. I could taste all the elements: the pineapple, brown sugar, and coconut.

Lula's Cafe was at the very top. So, I set out one Saturday morning with my boyfriend, and we got some kick ass Lula brunch. We arrived around 10 am and only waited ~5 minutes for a table. The restaurant is cute and comfortable, and our server was great. She was super friendly and made spot-on recommendations.  At her suggestion, we ordered a savory almond crepe, bread pudding french toast as well as a side of bacon and coffee. With the exception of kind of weird, sour tasting coffee... I was totally blown away by our order! The crepe dish comes with 2 crepes filled with cheese and topped with a sweet potato and lamb pancetta hash. The menu description said this hash is tossed in an anchovy vinaigrette, which I was slightly nervous about, but I didn't detect any fishy flavor at all! I was in total heaven.  As for the bread pudding french toast... what a unique, brilliant creation. Think bread pudding smothered in caramelized pineapple, coconut and some delicious cream sauce.  Our table neighbor made the great suggestion of ordering from the specials menu-- I think he was right.

I love going to their farm dinners to mark seasonal change, or to celebrate the height of a particular growing season. In this case, I thought it would help me regain my Midwest bearings. The starter was soft and luscious poached black cod, served in a steamer basket, over sauteed dark greens, with aioli and black garlic. The entree was braised veal cheek: an ingredient my sister would have been happy to know I'd never eaten. She won't be so happy now. It was falling apart delicious, with aromatic, earthy, crunchy carrots, rich jus and perfectly cooked grains. We added Meyer lemon tart to the farm dinner dessert of olive oil panna cotta. The panna cotta was jiggly and creamy, with cookie crunch and pistachio notes, the perfect end for most, but not this beast. My second dessert of Meyer lemon tart was even better, half frozen, with the tang of goat's milk caramel and candied citrus. We passed the Logan eagle on the way to the train.

I've been on the weekend and had to wait- it's totally worth it, but this visit we went on a weekday.  No wait and we enjoyed a nice relaxing lunch out of chiberia.   Our crew are mimosa connoisseurs and highly approve the cava mimosa.   We all shared our food and I can't get over it, it was perfect!

After the pastry warm up, we usually go with the breakfast burrito or one of the seasonal specials/scrambles. Prices are also reasonable, like your usual Logan Square atmosphere, but also has an upscale edge to it. If only, if only, reservations were an option. I'm not one who cares to wait a long time for the sake of waiting, which is the only reason I can see not taking even a limited amount of reservations.

I was not a frequent visitor to Logan Square and really wasn't too thrilled with going ""so far out"" (from Lincoln Park mind you), especially on a crappy weather night...on the train. SO, needless to say my attitude was already a bit soar. Well...Lula's changed it almost instantly. First, the bartender was incredibly patient with me since I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink. Secondly, the food was outstanding! The Kale salad was to die for and the squid ink appetizer was the most delicious meal I've ever tasted! Great atmosphere! Great service!

2014-02-26,5.0,"After checking out the tallest building in Chicago, Willis Tower, and discovering some beautiful areas of The Windy City, Alex and I decided to get outside the touristy parts and that's how we ended up at a local Brunch hangout called Lula Cafe. Stretching over three store fronts, Lula Cafe is among the hottest restaurants in Logan Square. It's a great place for brunch with five friends or to relax after work with a glass of wine and a book. It's a pretty versatile place and that's why we love it! ""With self taught chefs and a willingness to cook against categorization, the menu at Lula has grown into a kind of humble maturity, risky but grounded, a boheme bistro of the unclassifiable kind."" After receiving the menu, I was instantly intrigued by this sandwich that consisted of shaved roast beef, scrambled eggs, cheese sauce and french fries. I'm kicking myself right now because I cannot remember the name of it but as you can tell by the photo's it was pretty freaking great. Alex went with a more traditional breakfast of eggs, home fries, bacon and toast. Both were fabulous choices to satisfy our taste buds. Lula Cafe is open for every meal of the day from 9:00am to 2:00am except on Tuesday's when they take a much deserved break. The menu is so interesting and combines a plethora of flavors that you might never put together for yourself. From Bread Pudding French Toast to Pan Roasted Indiana Duck, there is something for everyone to fall in love with. Click here to see the full menu. Lula Cafe is located at 2537 North Kedzie Boulevard, Chicago, IL 60647 and dishes range from $8-$45.

For our entrees I went with the tofu and vegetable scramble and my friend went with the sweet potato latke.  Both were fantastic.  The home fries that came with the scramble were like nothing I've ever had before.  Potatoes so dark and crisp on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.  The scramble was excellent - the ginger miso touch had just enough flavor to make this an original and amazing dish without being overpowering in any way.  Despite being totally stuffed halfway through, I cleaned my plate thoroughly because I couldn't stop.  The latke was also excellent.  The red onion jam and the maitake went together nicely to add a perfect finish.  I highly recommend both entrees and for the quality cuisine and culinary care you're getting, their brunch prices are a steal.  I also ordered a side of the soy/veggie sausage and it was not too shabby.  One of the better ones I've had in town and clearly homemade.

I honestly can't remember what I had, but I do remember enjoying it.  What I remember much more clearly is that my sister had the Pasta YiaYia and is STILL talking about it weeks later.  She has even gone so far as to mail order some bucatini to see if she can make her own version.",0.944,0.836,0.164,0.0,0.541025641025641

Slices of thinly sliced radish (I think) to balance out the flavor, a poached egg with a perfect soft center, and little crunchy tortilla strips that added nice texture.

2013-10-27,5.0,"Ok, so I've been anticipating coming to Lula even before it opened (I ate here on day one of the original small store front. I still remember the stink of construction from when I happened to be strolling by as the furniture guy was applying the multiple layers of resin on top of the orange metallic paint to create the tables that have survived in tact albeit a tad wobbly all these years later). Certain things have changed (I really miss the wonderfully crispy quarter chicken and the original BLT w/ the magic special sauce that was on the first menu and the now distant memory of being able to be immediately seated. Alas those days are long gone), but years and countless menu tweaks later, one thing hasn't changed and it is the anticipation of my own selfish gastronomic happiness when I contemplate a visit to Chicago and brunch with the big boys. I won't get into details because anyone that loves brunch needs to come here at least once, but I will offer some minor tips to optimize your visit. Tips: 1. Make sure your whole party is around when you check in or expect a long wait; 2. Avoid the large farm table by the entrance/bar area unless you enjoy getting accidentally jostled by the hungry hordes scrutinizing your every bite. 3. Watch your step as you enter the smaller original dining room, I've seen too many people just eat it face first on that odd step. 4. Get at least one pastry of the day, especially if you see a kolache; 5. Enjoy and tip well. These guys deserve it.

2013-09-19,3.0,"I really try to digest experiences I have at places before I write my opinion of them as to not write out of enmity. But Lula has left a bad taste in my mouth AGAIN.  This review isn't even about the food... I am writing about the service. And honestly every time I have been here the service has always been weird for me. I've lived in the neighborhood less than a block away for about 4 years now and it seems like I have gone every 6 months out of exhausting all the other local options in hopes that my experience will be better. Mind you I am usually going during the weekday late morning to mid afternoon so typically they are not by any means busy enough to slightly justify offering an off vibe.  Here's the deal. My boyfriend and I decide on this rainy day that we want breakfast and since we haven't been in a while decided on Lula. There was only 1 other table when we arrived 30 minutes after they opened. Food was great, came out quick. But our server (whom I've had been bothered by before) was just so awkward. He doesn't introduce himself (shocker) so we will call him Socially Awkward, because he has waited on me before and has offered no sort of connection or personable experience whatsoever. I don't even care about that part.  You have no basic social manners and you work off tips, makes sense you work in a service industry fantastic.  Okay back to it.. ..we finish our food but I am still sipping my full cup of coffee, my boyfriends Iced Coffee had been empty for some time but SOCIALLY AWKWARD hadn't noticed because his presence was more of a ghost than a friendly server. He seems to forget to ask if we needed anything else and instead just brings us our check with his expressionless face and walks away. So when he goes to the table next to us I wave him down and politely say ""Can my boyfriend get another iced coffee, when you get a chance"", he comes over and says to us in a snooty matter of fact tone ""Refills are not free, would you like me to print another check with it on there?"" and being offended that he assumed we were asking for anything free my boyfriend said he was good.. He proceeds to walk away to the coffee bar and talks to the guy barista who both are now staring right at us as if we are heathens off the streets. I'm SORRY but if I am coming into your place of work and I ask for another iced coffee you go ""Sure I'll get that for you"" and be on your way because thats your job. If I'm paying $40 for breakfast for 2 at a higher end cafe I assume I don't get free refills on a $4 Iced Coffee. If I wanted a cheap breakfast and free coffee I'd go to Johnnys Grill where I know all the staff will be kind and inviting.  I may sound a little like I am nitpicking but I just think it is just plan rude to talk to your ""guests"" that way. If I didn't know what it was like to work in this industry and I didn't live in the area I would have not tipped you a dime for your poor attitude and lazy work ethic. I would prefer the chefs or your bussers and food runners got your nice tip I left you because they were more pleasant than anything you have offered the numerous times I have had the misfortune of being waited on by you. I can't fathom why you still have a job.  Next time I want breakfast of this ""caliber"" I will surely be going to Longman & Eagle or Jam because I like to be treated with respect.  And we walked our happy asses to Intelligentsia and paid them directly for their $4 iced coffee and they served it with a smile.",0.9504,0.815,0.101,0.083,0.5327097505668935

I had no idea gnocchi was THAT good.  Our entree was a pork roulade with Chinese broccoli and some other things.  All I could say to that was WOW.  I have no idea how she did it.. but the outer part of the roulade was this crispy layer of pork skin and the inner part was tender and flavorful.  We loved it.  So much.  For dessert.. we had a fruit sorbet (I want to say pomegranate) with an olive oil cake and shortbread crumble, creme fraiche and another fruit puree.  This dish was truly divine and the perfect end to a perfect meal.  I really felt like my taste buds were on a foodie adventure.  I am definitely coming back to try more delicious goodness!!",0.9986,0.699,0.285,0.016,0.6188253968253968

For drinks, we got some pink lemonade.  My friend thought it was too sour and couldn't even finish half of the glass, but to me it had the right amount of tanginess and sweetness.  So if you enjoy sour things, this lemonade is a must try for you.  For food, I ordered the peach bread pudding french toast (cornmeal shortbread topped with blackberries, peach syrup, and whipped sour cream) while my friend got the risotto al forno (laughing bird shrimp, cauliflower, leek, corn, tomato, 60 minute egg, and parmesan cheese.)  My bread pudding french toast was delicious.  The french toast was light, fluffy, and not overly sweet.  The risotto al forno was also pretty good.  It had the right amount of ingredients that didn't overpower each other.  The parmesan cheese also gave it a good creamy texture to the entrée.   The only thing I have to complain about is that the entrees are smaller than most brunch places I have been to.  For the prices Lula charges, I would expect the entrees to be a bit bigger.  I didn't think their food was that unique to charge more for less.  Even though their service is great and food was delicious, I don't know if I would wait in the long lines and pay premium prices.  I can get similar food and service at another brunch spot that will offer a better price for their dishes.",0.9919,0.791,0.163,0.046,0.5204254850088182

2013-08-22,4.0,"Enjoyed a lovely dinner al fresco last week. Entrees are small, artfully prepared, and so fresh.  We ordered Charred Melon Soup, Roasted Trumpet Mushrooms, Pasta Yiayia, Kale and Quesadillas. Churros with Cajeta Custard for dessert! Most unique of all was the cold melon soup ----a beautiful melon colored fusion of pureed melon and herbs poured over citrus marinated shrimp and a foamy lobster broth, presented in a wide herb-dusted bowl.  The quesadillas were made of a supremely light and crispy homemade white (or very pale yellow) corn tortilla, which I totally need to learn how to make. Delicious! Unfortunately, they were a bit misrepresented on the menu description, as the roasted zuchinni seemed nearly non-existent.  The simplicity and freshness of the Pasta Yiayia was amazing. Browned butter such a magical thing --with cinnamon, goat cheese and a light accent of garlic created a remarkably pleasing flavor profile worthy of repeat order! Trumput mushrooms portion, while incredibly delicious, was painfully small. The lemony kale side, on the other hand, quite generous. Loved them both. I highly recommend the churros dessert. It was a free form shaped fried dough, rather than the standard tube shape. The Cajeta custard for dipping was divine --only slightly sweet, and pleasingly rich. Wish the dessert included more than two minis ule crumbles of streusel topping -such a tease that was! Service was good; ambience inviting.

As everybody knows, it seems, Lula has a menu of standards and an ever-changing seasonal menu with lots of lovely surprises.  We started with one of these seasonal picks, a salad of wild greens and edible flowers with a chamomile vinaigrette.  It was a stunningly beautiful salad, and my mom said it was the only way she had ever enjoyed eating radishes.  It was on the bitter side, but that was just the nature of the herbs and wild green leafy things. Our next course was the Prawns a La Plancha, two big ol' prawns that were perfectly cooked (heads still attached) with fried squash blossoms and other goodness.  Third course was the Loup De Mer which was fantastic.  This means ""wolf of the sea"" and it was a delectable fish served with quinoa and fava bean salsa.  This was a really outstanding entree, the fish cooked to flaky perfection. We had dessert too but I can't remember what it was anymore...  all I know is that you really can't go wrong here, especially when you try the seasonal menu.  You know you are getting the freshest, most thoughtfully prepared ingredients.

2013-07-14,4.0,"After touring the downtown area for a few days, I was tired of being in the hustle and bustle and wanted to go somewhere a bit more low key.  Lula Cafe was the perfect stop on my 5th day in Chicago. Located in Logan Park, the restaurant is unassuming and cozy. Although it opened in 1999, the restaurant has an old school feel, even with walls decorated with modern art. The food however, is not old school at all, and can be described as creative and refreshing. I had the omelet which contained beef shortrib, charred cucumber, smoked paprika oil, shitake, chinese brocoli, creme fraiche and brie. Most ""american"" omelets come grossly oversized, but the one at Lula Cafe was a good size. I also tried the blueberry cheesecake bread pudding french toast which was absolutely delicious.

Simple but very decadent.  The soups are also always very good, and I generally get whatever the seasonal special is. The presentation is always fun and the flavors are often unexpected. The desserts are to die for! I still think of a dark chocolate one I had years ago that had some sort of sauce complete with dried apricots and nuts. Every time I eat at Lula, I hope to see it on the menu. While that dessert has not been on the menu since, there is always something new and interesting to try.  The cocktails are also great.

Lula is focused on featuring ingredients from small, independent, local farms, which is a major plus for someone who appreciates supporting local industry/ the slow food movement.  Lula changes their specials menu seasonally, but their cafe menu stays the same, so you can come back for old favorites (chilled peanut satay noodles, anyone?), or try something new (sunchoke agnolotti-- but really I went to Lula about five times this winter and got these every time, they were that good).

However sometimes they will tell you the wait can be up to an hour and thirty minutes, but just give them your cell phone number and they usually call within an hour.

In fact, I didn't really think about that until just now...memories. But, what really put it over the top happened to me the other day. I took myself out to a movie, and just when I was about to get in the car, my brain said ""What are you doing, dummy! It's 10 blocks away! Ride your bike!"" So, I did, and after the movie, rode over to Lula and snuggled into a bar seat. Everyone was on dates all around me, but it wasn't weird at all that I was there alone. Wonderful cocktail, wonderful bite to eat...and when I was done, I looked out the window and it was raining cats and dogs! Holy cow! The bartender asked if I wanted anything else and I expressed that I really should go home, but I'm on my bike and now stuck. And what did he do? What did that sweet, non-mustache having (!) lad say to me? He offered me a garbage bag to wear! It was sweet and thoughtful and OF COURSE I said yes! So, he cut a head hole, and had me put it on and laughed when I acted like I was suffocating (but what if I WAS suffocating? I would have died!). Then he cut some arm holes for me. THEN! On my way out the door, the host asked if I wanted an umbrella! Like, they were just gonna give me an umbrella, and trust that I would bring it back at some point, which of course I wouldn't have because I'm a forgetful person.  Well, I was on my bike, so I didn't take the umbrella, but the garbage bag did keep my torso dry all the way home. If only he'd offered me bags for my feet...what a jerk!

The atmosphere was awesome, everyone was there to have an excellent meal and drinks on a Friday night. I started with a very tasty whiskey drink, the name escapes me, but it's something Plays Checkers. Definitely recommend. We started with the beet bruschetta which was outstanding. So many flavors and textures between the goat cheese, beets, and red onion. It also came in a perfect portion for splitting with four large pieces. We then split the pasta 'yiayia' and the short rib. The pasta comes in these crazy long, thick noodles that are fantastic. The combination of brown sugar, garlic, and what must be magic, makes this dish deeeelicious. I found it to be pretty rich and was happy we were sharing. The short ribs were cooked perfectly and came with cauliflower cooked three ways. All three ways were great, I don't know how they made cauliflower this delicious. Overall, I can't wait to return for brunch and another lovely dinner.

It was absolutely delicious.  Layers of whipped goat cheese, topped with juicy beets, a lightly dressed salad, and more thinly shaved beets.  Are you kidding me?

My boyfriend and I both decided to go with the specials, a Cornbreef Hash Sandwich & bread pudding french toast with white chocolate moose.    The sandwich was to die for.  The bread pudding french toast made me wish I had a sweet tooth because it was so good, but I couldn't get past one slice, it was so sweet and the coffee made it expand in my tummy pretty fast.   I felt bad because I think the waiter thought I hated it and even offered to bring me something else to eat.  It's really appreciated when staff try to make sure you leave the restaurant happy.

2013-01-27,4.0,"I like going to Lula for a couple of reasons.  I've been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner ... not on the same day, though. I enjoy their draft beer selection.  Lula usually has only 6 or so draft beers at one time, but I can usually find 2 or 3 that are really interesting and new to me.  While the vibe can be a bit on the hipster side, the bartenders are typically super nice and have made me very comfortable when tasting the various draft beers to decide what I wanted to drink.  Whoever selects the draft beers is doing a great job!  Recently, I particularly enjoyed a Corsican ale which was lightly yeasty and a bit spicy.  I hope they have it again when I return. Breakfast is fun, again with a bit of a hipster crowd melding with suburbanites coming to check out the City.  We went with our kids, and felt that they were welcome, but definitely not the center of attention.  I would say that Lula is kid friendly, but not a kid destination. I don't have much to add to the other reviewers take on dinner, excpet to chime into say that the food is well worth traveling for.

2013-01-26,5.0,"I've had an unfinished review of Lula Cafe languishing in my Yelp account since 2008--touting it as the best breakfast place in Logan Square.  This remains unchanged even with the development of the neighborhood and influx of competing restaurants.  It's evolved to become a place to go at any time of day, and at any time you're sure to find a meal of impeccable quality with an ever-changing seasonal menu.  In 2008, it was a tiny spot with good food with a similarly tiny patch of outdoor seating, but has since expanded to include a full bar serving craft cocktails (sans-snobbery) and even a bakery. I'd make a food recommendation, but the menu is pretty different each time I visit this spot.  Definitely check this place out if you're in the area, and if you live in the area -- hopefully those folks don't actually show up to increase your wait times.",0.9615,0.87,0.13,0.0,0.5657407407407408

I would still say brunch is my favorite. I recently went back for dinner with a friend and really enjoyed the drinks.  However, the winter dumpling special (vegetarian entree), although very pretty was very bland. I wish that there would be more care and interest put into the vegetarian specials. There was no stand out flavor, in fact, I could barely taste what was inside the dumpling wrapper and the black rice wasn't interesting. For $19 an entree, I was expecting a whole lot more. I guess their vegetarian staples like the tagine are good an all, but I always want to try something different.

2013-01-23,4.0,"We finally drove over to Lula Cafe from Rogers Park today for a quick brunch - well the quick didn't happen as much as the brunch did - but it was enjoyable none the less.  Walking into the cafe this past Sunday around 1:00 PM there were people standing all around the front half of the restaurant - and this is me assuming that there is a back half, as I saw people being taken back there with menus and I figured they weren't just providing them with bathroom reading material.  While I figured it would be busy, I didn't think that there would still be a 45 minute wait, but the place is popular - I get it.  So I put my name down and asked her what the deal with the bar was and she said it was first come first serve -wonderful!  I stood around the bar and some seats opened up immediately, but my partner was still parking the car so I stood back and let another complete party beside me grab the seats instead (I have manners...sometimes).  My partner came in shortly after and we stood there together just staking the bar out, devising plans on where to go.  Who ""devises"" plans when it comes to finding bar seats?  We do - we were hungry.  Then we spotted seats at this high top communal table to the right of the bar and upon asking the host we figured out that everything around the bar was first come first serve as well.  The host said ""go grab them"" and so we did... quickly.  In my opinion, we grabbed the best seats in the house - I love little nooks and the communal table was big enough so that we didn't even feel like it was actually communal.  Plus, we were sitting next to the pastry area and at one point a whiff of chocolate ran under our noses - ah, yum!   For drinks, I ordered a chai latte and my partner ordered a spiked cider.  My chai was unexpectedly very tasty and the spiked cider was strong and flavorful.  For a starter, we ordered the apple and goat cheddar crostata - so good!  They had three different pastries and you can either buy one for four dollars or three for ten dollars.  After the first bite of the crostata I wished that we had chosen the three for ten!  We went back and forth on the different main dishes on the menu for a bit longer than we normally do - we typically pick one savory and one sweet to share, but there weren't as many sweet dishes to choose from as there were savory so we ended up picking two savory instead.  Following the recommendations from our server, we ended up choosing ""The Royale"" (Lula Breakfast Sandwich Series) and the omelet.   ""The Royale"" - tamarind glazed chicken thigh, bread and butter pickles, smoked gouda, caper aioli, sunny side egg on a potato roll.  This was my favorite of the two dishes.  Everything about this sandwich made my stomach smile.  It is difficult to say what my favorite component was, because I genuinely liked everything about it.     Omelet - venison sausage, fennel, winter squash, kale, pumpkin seeds, ricotta.  This was like no other omelet I have ever had.  While it wasn't my favorite, it was my partner's favorite - she thought that it tasted like autumn.  I loved how all of the components tasted together and I agreed that it tasted like autumn, I just personally wouldn't be able to eat the whole omelet if I tried.  Maybe it had something to do with the omelet being savory and sweet, I'm not really sure, but it was definitely a try once and once only type of dish for me.     I really enjoyed our brunch at Lula Cafe and I will definitely be back, but only if I'm in the area - the drive plus the wait isn't something I would choose over the great brunch spots up north where I live.",0.9984,0.825,0.148,0.027,0.47695464852607716

2013-01-21,2.0,"This place is adorable, and the service was great, but I had some serious issues with the food. Not to put on my Top Chef judge-sounding hat, but everything I tried was interesting in concept, but lacking in taste and execution. Everything on the menu sounds good and imaginative and sadly, it just doesn't taste that great.  The app I tried was the pork belly, with cornmeal cakes. The presentation was cute -- like mini breakfast, with little pancake-like cornmeal cakes and pork belly cut to look like little pieces of bacon. It was okay --cornmeal cakes kind of bland -- and the other stuff on the plate seemed there purely for decoration and didn't go with the dish at all. Pickled sweet potato?  Really didn't go. Looked pretty, tasted like it belonged on another dish. I tried the lamb shoulder for an entree. For $27, there was not a lot of meat. The cuts were small and fatty. There was an overpowering salty jus all over the plate, and various incarnations of celery: fried celery root, braised (really just sad and wilted) celery. The menu descrip had mentioned black olives and these were, like the pickled sweet potato on the app, totally not integrated. I had to hunt to find the few pieces of dehydrated olive on the plate and they tasted gross. Not a complementary flavor at all. This dish needed something else in terms of texture and flavor -- a starch, maybe, or even just a puree to tie it all together somehow. Meat and some celery didn't cut it. My boyfriend got the winter dumplings. They were okay. The stuff in the dumplings was tasty -- the dumpling wrappers themselves seemed kind of amateur and were not evenly cooked. Side of kale was too salty. Desserts were an improvement, best part of the meal. The cranberry chestnut tart was delicious. The chocolate pudding cake was decent.  Finally, the wine list was....bizarre. For reds, they had three different pinots, several Rhone blends, but mysteriously, no Cabs, merlots or Bordeaux-style wines. Also, the wine and the wine glass it came in was super cold!  I was drinking red to warm up and while I know it's correct to serve reds slightly below room temp, these were too chilled. The window into the prep line revealed a number of young, hip chefs wearing colorful bandanas. They even looked like Top Chef contestants. But they really should start tasting their food, simplifying their flavor profiles and just honoring their ingredients a little more. No one wants food that's creative in appearance and concept but not tasty.",0.9957,0.758,0.176,0.066,0.5680817610062894

2013-01-20,5.0,"I've come, very slowly but inevitably, to the conclusion that Lula is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. No, I haven't been to every trendy palace of gastronomy in the city, but there's something so endearing about this place. The atmosphere is fashionable yet causal; the prices are confusingly affordable; and the food is so, so very consistent and delightful.  On my first visit, it managed to be dressy enough for a birthday dinner with parents. On my second, it was somehow casual enough for a stopover lunch with a group of college students. I love the versatility of the cafe and dinner menus. How can a fresh, locally-sourced meal be just $10? I pay that much for shitty neighborhood Thai food. It definitely feels like a more expensive experience, even if I'm just getting a sandwich. Actually, the Tineka sandwich fundamentally changed how I though I though about the generally uninteresting food item. How was it so simple, yet so delightfully layered?  I've enjoyed everything I'e order. The beet bruschetta and the spinach salad have always tasted fresh and bright. The satay noodles are obviously not something authentic, but hell, authenticity clearly isn't the intention. And yeah, the pasta yiayia is completely unexpected in it's sweetness, but the rich feta cheese and long, straw-like bucatini noodles are delicious even if you don't have a point of reference. My only regret was once going for the Tineka even though they were still serving bunch, which I've never tried. But I suppose that gives me a reason to head down there on a Sunday morning sometime soon. All of my experiences with the service have been pleasant. I've both made reservations and walked in during peak times and always was treated promptly and politely. If you don't make a reservation, you're going to wait, but uh, isn't that pretty par for the course for any popular restaurant? The servers are always knowledgeable about the menu, and the service has a good cadence for conversation: not too fast, not too slow. Enjoy your meal, take your time, and really savor the efforts in front of you. And yeah, I can totally see how Lula could be written off as pretentiously trying too hard, seeing how it's really quite fun arguing about anything that could be taken as hipster fodder.

Very sweet - so you'll need a sweet tooth to enjoy this. It's just on the verge of being too sweet with both the syrup and the sweet drizzle over it, but is still really well done. The crumbles were fantastic and added a great crunch, the apples added a tiny bit of tartness, and the toast itself was incredibly soft and moist. * 'The Royale' (Lula b'fast sandwich series) - 4 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/4i1N… (pulled pork, creamy slaw, potato chips, a 'classic egg on buttered texas toast. $13) Nice! Trust them when they say the toast is buttered - it's REALLY buttered. But that's probably what makes it so flavorful. It's a little oily but is toasted just enough. The pork is fantastic and tasty. The slaw is really strong as well - so if you're not into that pickled flavor, be careful how much you have in each bite. * Chilaquiles - 5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/4i1N… (salsa roja, refried pinto beans, roasted winter squash, spiced pepitas & peanuts, queso fresco, sunny side egg. $10) I seriously loved this so much and was jealous I didn't order it myself. Good thing my friend was cool about sharing and kept letting me pick off his plate! This was legit spicy, all the flavors worked so well together, the soft egg yolk was a GREAT addition, and the toasted pumpkin seeds & peanuts topped it off really well.

2013-01-02,3.0,"Dropping three stars on Lula Cafe is like spitting into the sea, but I want to make two specific notes, one for the service and one about the food. Most importantly:  Lula does accept reservations.  Their Yelp profile states that they do not, so we didn't make one.  I knew that they are a popular place known for long waits, so I advocated an early dinnertime.  Our group of six showed up at 6pm on the Saturday evening of Christmas weekend and were quoted a two-hour wait.  Two hours!  ""But half of the restaurant is empty.""  ""Well, we have a lot of reservations coming later.""  Wha?  So apparently they do take reservations.  And they take so many that they can't (or won't) accommodate walk-ins even at 6pm.  I told the hostess about the discrepancy with the Yelp listing, and she didn't seem too concerned.  Nor did she apologize or try to soften the blow at all.  A comment like ""Oh, I'm really sorry about that; we're really busy tonight but we would love to have you guys back another time"" would have gone a long way. We were prepared to decamp for a more hospitable local option as soon as our first-arrived friends finished their drinks, when one of my them talked the hostess into seating us in the bar area.  So around 6:30 the six of us gathered around a pair of conjoined two-tops, right by the door,  where half the seating was an angled bench with no back.  Sigh, thanks but no thanks Lula.  Call me cranky and high-maintenance I guess, but either give us a real table or graciously let us go on our way to another establishment.  I did not care for the second-class treatment. However, we had all been excited to try the restaurant, so we settled down and tried to get into the mood to enjoy their wares.  For the record, our waitress and the food runners were wonderful and attentive all night, so I have no complaints about that aspect of the service. The fare was mostly very good:  three of the dishes that I ate were outstanding--the spicy sesame slaw, the chickpea tagine, and the sticky gingerbread dessert.  But my entree of gnocchi with wild boar sausage was a terrible miss. First, they should serve this in a smaller vessel because it looks undersized, barely covering the bottom of the dish.  Or maybe it IS undersized and they should include more.  Second, there were merely three (3) one-inch pieces of wild boar sausage.  Third, and most egregious, there was some kind of bitter green mixed in which was completely wrong.  It didn't complement the other flavors, it didn't lend an interesting accent, it didn't provide counterbalance to other elements--it brutally overwhelmed the dish with bitterness.  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  Gnocchi, sausage, fennel, chicory, and cheese were all well matched.  Those greens were an abomination.  It was so jarring that I couldn't believe that this came out of a professional kitchen; it seemed like a failed experiment.  In a word, those greens ruined the whole entree.",0.9554,0.783,0.125,0.092,0.43955226115603474

What I remember about that visit could fill a very small pocket on a small vest worn by a baby mouse.  Which is to say, I don't remember much.  I knew they did not take reservations, which was confirmed by my husband's survey of the Yelp listing prior to our recent visit, which I do remember.   But wait!  When we arrived and checked in with the hostess, our party was told they couldn't seat us for two hours despite a wide open dining room.  Our friend pointed out the open tables and was told there were reservations lined up for them.  !!!  Apparently, they started taking reservations ""about a year ago.""  Would. Have. Been. Nice. To. Know.  What was nice?  Having a friend who could charm his way into a table...small and by the door.  Not ideal, but we were glad to stay there instead of walking to Plan B in 20 degree weather.   Moving on.    There are two menus - a regular and then a cafe menu.  Not sure what the real difference is, or why they couldn't print everything on one.  I found my item on the cafe menu though, so fingers and toes crossed that they don't take it away.   Our party had a variety of entrees, and one couple had the vegetarian tasting menu.  The servers did a good job timing those items (I believe 5 plus dessert) to coincide with the rest of the table.  The service otherwise was just fine.   My entree, and the reason for the four stars, was the chickpea tagine.  I love chickpeas, so I was partial, and the idea of a tagine was perfect for the aforementioned cold-ass night.  It exceeded my expectations: it was a lot of food, it was four simple elements, and it was so good my husband tried to eat more of it than his sausage gnocchi.  In addition to the chickpeas, there were maitake mushrooms, a few slices of cooked sweet potato, and a two crunchy plain crackers (those came in handy because those chicks had heat).  For $10 (seriously!) I had dinner and lunch, twice.       The other two things I ate were the cole slaw (which is described as ""spicy sesame"" but was not spicy and I missed the sesame) and dessert.  Our dessert was the sticky gingerbread cake with coconut sorbet.  Good, but neither of those things are in my top five favorites, so I was pleased but not over the moon.   There are other goodies to explore on the menu, so I hope to visit again soon.  I will probably need to get the chickpea tagine again but will branch out on the appetizer or dessert front.  And will skip the dreaded wait by making a reservation.  Overall, a 3.5 but am rounding up in chickpea solidarity.",0.9967,0.837,0.144,0.019,0.5034213080366927

I think I have had several things on the menu, all of which were great from the Classic Lula Breakfast Burrito and Ham and Raclette Panino to the Pasta YiaYia and Brioche French Toast, I think I have a mild addiction to the Baked French Feta. I dream of the creamy hot feta, and the hand toasted baguette slices and salty olives. I would eat it every day if I could.  Great beer selection. Cool with asking for picky things like having your bacon extra crispy.",0.9619,0.801,0.16,0.039,0.43796296296296305
2012-12-27,4.0,"I really wanted to come here for brunch, but I settled for dinner instead. However, I was not disappointed. Lula Cafe has a rustic and eclectic ambiance. It has a very farm-to-table feel and apparently has seasonally-changing menus. Though the menus aren't large by any measure, there are, nonetheless, ample quality dishes. The Bay Scallops from George's Bank were a delicious appetizer. As for an entree recommendation, I'm a huge fan of braised meat. I'll have to admit that the Braised Veal Cheeks were the best braised meat dish I have ever had.  FYI, definitely check out the spiked ginger apple cider. It's a warm concoction of cider and gin with a kick of ginger -- surprisingly delicious. This restaurant is usually pretty busy, so I'd recommend making reservations. Do note, however, that reservations are not taken for weekend brunches.",0.9937,0.712,0.288,0.0,0.5868131868131867

2012-11-29,3.0,"Lula Cafe. I've heard so many good things about this Chicago standard, especially those more inclined for vegetarian fare. Ari and Tali had the great idea to check it out and we did during the last week of October and actually managed to sit outside since it was that week where the weather was ridiculously nice. My general take away was that I was disappointing compared to what I had heard. I also know that brunch is one of the famous meals so maybe that's worth going back for. But I will give credit to a great menu that has a lot of variety for those looking to avoid meat and there are plenty of interesting options. The most memorable aspect from the meal was texture. Each dish came out and had some awesome texture with interesting ingredients and playful ways to enjoy the food. The main downside is that we didn't think the flavors were all that special or impressive. Everything was nice and fine but nothing stood out as particularly interesting. We even ordered the three squash medley that was highly recommended and didn't quite understand why. I don't remember being offended by the pricing and our service was high quality. I certainly would return for a good reason or suggest for those who need to meet dietary restrictions but I was not blown away overall.  As you can see we ordered plenty of different things to try. We started with kale ""chips"" and the autumn salad of spaghetti squash slow poached in hazelnut oil, smoked trout roe, celery aioli, asian pear, carob. I really liked the kale (and other root vegatables) actually, again, great texture and fun to eat with an interesting sunchoke dip. The 'salad' was more of mixed bag. The quesadilla's (hen of the woods mushrooms, caramelized winter squash, fromage blanc) were some of our favorite, and I say that as not much of a mushroom fan, but they worked very well wit the squash and cheese and salsas.  My two other favorite dishes were the pastas - chilled peanut satay noodles (marinated tofu and seasonal pickles) and spaghetti (sweet and spicy chile 'salsa rossa,' queso fresco). Though the satay noodles stole the show for sure. The highly recommended squash three ways was a big disappointment because it wasn't that interesting or very tasty. And it was a little hard to understand what was actually going on the plate. I never like dishes that require an instruction manual. I'm certain but I think the last dish was a fish dish that was also very mediocre and hard to figure out. The texture (!) was really cool with the string fried something and a few cauliflowers (maybe?) but overall not sure what was the point of the plate.  I'm not trying to be overly critical as we had a nice time and good meal for respected value. And it feels like it's playing in a unique space (both literal and culinary) that attracts a very specific crowd. The food had ups and downs but nothing consistently amazing. Worth checking out if you need another brunch option in Logan Square or need a vegetarian meal.",0.9979,0.76,0.193,0.047,0.5134810985797827

We finally found a pay lot about a 1/4 mile away, sigh. Parking rigmarole aside, this turned out to be a fine place--even with a 2 year old (my nephew)! At first glance this cool hipsterish joint (moody ambiance, interesting art, hard furniture, filled with aging hipster types) doesn't seem like it'd be very child-friendly, but wait staff was on it with the booster seat and a sippy cup of water. They don't have a child menu, but we were OK with letting the little guy eat our stuff. They had a cafe menu (less expensive, smaller items) and a dinner specials menu. We ordered:  - chip & dip (sunchoke custard, crispy root vegetables, black truffle) - caesar salad - quesadilla (hen of the woods mushrooms, caramelized winter squash, fromage blanc) - baked French feta - pasta 'YIAYIA' (bucatini, cinnamon, feta, garlic, brown butter) - spaghetti (sweet and spicy chile 'salsa rossa,' bacon, queso fresco) - slow-roasted pork shoulder (fried oysters, illinois ginger, brussels sprouts, burnt orange aioli, dark rye) The portions may not look huge, but they were good-sized and it was definitely enough food for 4 adults and 1 child. I thought all the food was good, but probably my least favorite item was the Pasta YiaYia--I didn't care for that particular combination of sweet and savory. The spaghetti was excellent, as was the quesadilla. They had a good craft beer selection as well.

So after a quick bath i walked to the cafe.  The cafe is nothing special to look at from the outside and inside. But it is cozy and comfortable. I was quickly seated at a table close to the window. My server was super nice and patient. He was very accommodating and helped me decide on what to order. I started with a freshly squeezed orange juice. It was nice and refreshing. Not tart at all. I started with  a side portion of the brioche french toast. I had read great reviews of it and really wanted to try without making a meal out of it. So they kindly agreed to give me 1 piece instead of the whole plate. It not only looked delicious but was the best french toast i have ever eaten. Very well cooked and soft from the inside. Not at all eggy. The sweet syrup and the honey butter were perfect complements. Every bit just melted in my mouth and was a burst of flavors. The perfect start to a breakfast. I kept thinking i will save it for later and eat it after my omelet but my hands wouldn't stop. The next i had was an omelet filled with melted onions, summer apple, oyster mushroom, spinach and Gruyere. The presentation was a bit sad with no greens on the plate. Just an omelet folded with  a side of potatoes and fruits. But looks can be deceptive. As soon as i took a bite of the omelet there was an explosion of flavors in my mouth. The onions were perfectly caramelized and were ever so sweet. The small bite size apples gave a nice crunch, the mushrooms were full of flavor and the cheese and spinach a perfect amalgamation. Each bite was savory and light. It was an omelet but prepared as a crepe. Very light and fluffy. The side of potatoes and fruits were nothing to boast about. In fact I took a bite of the potatoes and decided to just concentrate on the eggs. Overall great food and excellent service. The rumors have it that this place gets crowded on the weekend.

I brunched with a group of 5 on a busy busy Sunday, and we told to expect a 30 minutes wait.  After waiting an hour, then an hour and fifteen minutes, a member of our party finally approached the hostess.  I think their initial plan was to get a table that could comfortably seat 5, but due to our extensive wait they ended up squeezing a chair on the corner or a 4-top and placing us there.  Made the extra wait annoying, but the subsequent service and food made up for this initial snafu. The Brunch menu is rather diverse, with both lunch and breakfast items, sweet and savory.   It also has options that would suit those with dietary restrictions: vegetarian, dairy free... Seeing that I do NOT have dietary restrictions, but couldn't decide if I wanted their breakfast or lunch, their sweet or savory, I compromised and had both.  A turkey sandwich with bacon and cheddar, and a smoked pecan sticky bun.   Service up to this point and throughout our meal was excellent: our server was very polite and efficient.   I received the sticky bun first and was not overly impressed with the size or presentation.  The taste was good, definitely a hint of smokiness, but not excellent.  The stickiness was centered towards the top rather than throughout the bun.  Next came my turkey sandwich and side of greens, and this was great.   The sandwich is huge and definitely suitable for more than one meal.  It has a lot going on- sprouts, avocado, multi-grain bread, aioli... but it all blends into one great sandwich.  This was the highlight of my meal that day, and lunch the next day.

After she said yes, the Lula staff welcomed us in (and then back out to an intimate corner of the spacious street-side patio after we proved indecisive) with congratulations and brought us champagne (which was wonderful and dry... really surprisingly good). The server was absolutely fantastic, being both super attentive and respectful of the fact that we were a bit distracted by what had just happened.

Additionally, I often find reviews fail to mention the je ne sais quoi of the rest of the crowd-- I would do a disservice by failing to mention how groovy the rest of the diners were. Lula's stimulating ambience seems driven by a funky diner-demographic and a genuine and warm staff. The food itself was clean, balanced and well executed. The kale has a slow zing of lemon balanced against a light parmesan dusting. The red cabbage slaw is a really great contrast of flavor. The mussels dish was really well balanced, Unlike any other mussels I've had,  it emanated an earthliness from the carrot broth and radish. (I felt like Peter Rabbit eating seafood!) We continued with the beet bruschetta (aggressively rustic and full of flavor) and the baked feta (a baked cheese dish that feels clean and light in the mouth?!).

Let me digress for a moment and tell you how much I hate beets. Simply put, I hate beets. They taste like freshly mowed grass. Even when people say ""you will love these beets; they're different"" or ""beet juice is so much better than plain old beets"" it's never true. Until Lula. I actually almost enjoyed them. So do not be afraid to order beet bruschetta. Word.  The kale was a good, healthy choice and the chickpea tagine was addictive.

However this is where the experience turned negative.  Greeted by Alee our server we started to experience an all around negative vibe.  When we asked what comes with the pancakes, she coldly responded ""ummm,  butter and syrup"". After she rudely took the rest of our order she walked away. Turns out that's really all she did, walk away.  She never sent our order to the kitchen.  We only figured this out when we realized that both tables to our sides that were seated after us, had eaten and were paying their tabs.  We asked Alee about our order and she again coldly responded ""It will be out soon.""

The plate looked amazing when it arrived, really a tower of beauty. I love how the fried ramps fell across the delicate-looking egg. It was difficult figuring out how to go about it, but I got into it with as much gusto as one can have for pork belly. Which is a LOT. The belly was soft and fatty, the runny yolk was creamy, and they were both balanced out well by the tart worcestershire aioli. It was pure bliss.

2012-04-16,4.0,"Just a few excerpts from their press page: ""Hip dining destination in Logan Square"" ""Lula gets creative with organic"", "" The chefs, together, create daily specials featuring seasonal organic  produce from local sources, wild caught fish and naturally raised meats and poultry."" ""Their weekend brunch is a wonder in and of itself too, for those willing to brave the likely wait."" The above says it all, except how exceptionally yummy the food is and it IS.  My first time was yesterday and I was thrilled with my choice.  It was a breakfast sandwich (The Royale) off their changing specials menu.  A soft roll, with a soft boiled egg, red eye duck gravy, Broadbent country ham, duck confit, comte and foie butter.  If you haven't a clue as to the description of it, just think soft roll with some kind of gravy, country ham which is loose and easily pulling apart with each bite.  On the plate was some kind of salad, looked like Kim chi residue, I wasn't crazy about it.  The sandwich had some gravy on the plate mixed with yolk, as something to dip into, it was super tasty.  If work wasn't stopping me, I'd probably go back today or tomorrow for another one.  I enjoyed this sandwich with a cocktail.  Gosling's rum mixed with ginger soda.  Not Canada dry, the real stuff.  The ginger was strong which added a kick to the rum.  With a lime, it was refreshing.   Sunday brunch typically carries a long wait in Chicago.  With good weather, we are talking forty five minutes to an hour, usually.  Lula's requires walk in reservations, no phoning ahead.  This blows.  Our reservation made at 1:15 pm, seated at about 3:30.  WTF right? Exactly.  Imagine you are with a group of ten plus and you stand outside for more than an hour and sometimes longer than that.  The café has many tables for twos and threes.  There are only two areas where it's possible to seat approximately twelve or so.  Wait times are based on people and their attitudes.  Lula's café does its best to serve and they can only manage to do so much when it comes to freeing up space for your party which is understandable. Here's my rant though, you (customer) may have joined a party and dined together and were served in a timely manner.  All enjoyed, paid and left, except a few llamas.  Why do the three of you sit at a huge table, talking for another hour plus?  Not ordering drinks or food, just holding the space.  Why not move to an empty table and free up the space for the next party.  You can see people waiting outside and yet you just linger.  When a restaurant is popular and people are waiting for you to finish, why be rude?  Don't llama or camp out spots, especially on a Sunday for brunch.  Weekdays for breakfast, do what you please, but on weekends, for goodness sakes, MOVE! I'm a little surprised the waiter didn't go above and beyond.  A kind question to these ladies to see if they wouldn't mind moving to a smaller table where they can continue their conversation is not rude.  This is a business right?  Unfortunately because more was not done and we waited two hours for a table, I know that 80% of my table will not return.  Most were intrigued with the offerings, especially the note about organic and locally sourced farmers.  All were thrilled with the food and our server was awesome.   But.",0.9873,0.869,0.101,0.03,0.5357167946209043

2012-03-09,4.0,"After numerous reschedulings, we finally managed to get to Lula Cafe. Logan Square is now home to several well-known, excellent, and eclectic restaurants, including Longman & Eagle, Bonsoiree, and apparently Lula Cafe. And, as Logan Square is still an ""up-and-coming"" neighborhood, you can expect excellent food at less than eye-opening prices. Lula Cafe has two house wines on tap, which are reasonably priced, whether you buy by the glass or the bottle. We were celebrating Aaron's birthday, so we shared a half bottle of the house shiraz. Like other ""New American"" restaurants, the menu featured quality, locally-sourced ingredients in unfamiliar but delightful combinations. We started off with a wood mushroom tempura, and the batter was crunchy with only a hint of mushroom flavor. I'm no stranger to tempura, but the dipping sauce, duck egg yolk, was different and interesting. It gave the crispy mushrooms a creamy flavor.  For mains, I had the veal cheeks. I've never had veal cheeks before, but these tasted like extra-tender short ribs. I didn't need my knife to parse out the strands of delicious, soft meat. This was cooked in a rich sauce, very similar to a typical short rib braise. The flavor and weight is on the heavier side, but this was just perfect for winter. The bacon and black eyed pea mixture that accompanied it was great--the bacon bits were chunkier and meaty, and the peas had a dense bite. Aaron had the Pasta Yiayia, a special type of bucatini--imagine if macaroni and spaghetti had a baby...long strands of thick hollowed-out noodles--cooked in cinnamon, garlic, and brown butter. I wasn't a huge fan of the cinnamon, which I felt made the flavor dessert-like, but the brown butter had a nice and deep, caramel flavor, and I absolutely loved the noodles. Last, we had carrot cake for dessert. If I were to do it again, I would have gotten a second appetizer and skipped dessert. It was good, but it was no duck egg-dipped crispy mushroom.

In the summer they have an amazing farmers market a few blocks away on Sundays. Though it is hard to go to after you are stuffed from Lula because the market has lots of prepared foods too! If you ask Lula what they are known for I don't know what they would say, but they are definitely known for their seasonal sweet breakfast in my book. I got the breakfast burrito when I first went and it was just okay. Though every time I've been back I've been blown away by their inventive griddle cakes or brioche french toast. The sweet options always contain about 10 ingredients most of them fancy sounding like raspberry coulis, but all of them delicious. The options change seasonally which is fun.  They have hand pies that my friend gets every time we go. I always decided against getting one and I always regret that decision since they are delicious. Heed my warning and just get the hand pie to start. As any good Chi-brunch spot there will be a wait as soon as the majority of the neighbor hood is able to wipe the sleep from their eyes so the sooner you get there the better.

Food-wise, though, it was something of a disappointment :( My friend and I came here for brunch on a Monday afternoon, and the place was busy but not too packed. They told us there was a 25 min wait so we chose to sit at the bar. We started with chai lattes and split an apple cheddar pastry. The pastry was just okay. The actual filling was only about 10% of the whole thing, and the pastry part was dry and tasteless. Nothing special, and certainly not worth $4, considering how small it was. I ordered the breakfast burrito with a side of apple sage chicken sausage. My breakfast burrito was incredibly mediocre. It sounded a lot better on paper (egg, potato, avocado, onion, green chile, tomato, cheddar) than it actually tasted. They didn't even make an effort to blend the ingredients together, so one half of my burrito ended up being all avocado and tomato, and the other half was everything else. The sausage was so greasy that I couldn't finish all three links. My friend's omelette wasn't much better. I think it had roast duck, arugula, artichoke, and some other things in it -- it's not the same as the omelette they have listed on their brunch menu. The duck was tough and tasteless, and everything else fell apart as a result of it. Portions are fair -- we were hoping to order french toast afterwards but we were too stuffed.

When I arrived, my three daughters had been waiting over a half hour and there was still another half hour of waiting left.  Sure enough, it was over an hour wait.  Everyone was very cheerful and talkative so don't go here for brunch if you are on a tight schedule. Two of us ordered the special breakfast sandwich with smoked, braised veal and ginger marmalade.  I split it with my daughter, being such a large sandwich.  She had ordered the stratta, so I received half of her stratta.  I did not like the ginger marmalade or the smoked, braised veal.  The combo was terrible.  My other daughter ordered the same thing and did not eat hers. The third daughter was the smart one.  She ordered the challah french toast with sugared pecans and maple.  Totally heaven. I would recommend sticking to basic eggs or pancakes or french toast or a sticky bun. Unless of course, you are a gambler!  The food is interesting, that is for sure.  I read some of the reviews and I want to know:  where were the pear/rosemary scones and potatoes served with eggs?  Maybe we had a different menu.

The breakfast is good any time, but I was about as hungover as David Hasselhof after an all you can eat hamburger competition. To make matters worse, I had to ride my bike here since my friend had to be out the door by 7AM. To top it off, Lula Cafe wasn't even open when I got there. I was impressed to see a line already forming at the door. As the patrons walked in to get seated by the hostess, I did all that the body could allow. Take a seat at da bahhh. Bloody Mary to start. A damn fine Blood Mary as well. For breakfast I, I went straight HAM. Got their seasonal french toast AND their seasonal breakfast sandwich. Both were to die for. I took my sweet time, since it was way more food than 1 person should eat. After about an hour, I got myself a glass of OJ. I read the paper and kept eating, slowly. Some others sat at the bar and we threw around some small talk. I must have seemed like a sicky with my Germany cut off t-shirt, mesh shorts, and a back pack as my companion.

Lula is hands-down the best brunch in the city. And, for being a hot, no reservation restaurant, as a table of 2 we only had to wait about 20 minutes at primetime (noon). The cocktails, as everyone says, are out of control good - especially the bloody mary with horseradish, siracha, oysters, etc. The food was spectacular as well. The pear rosemary scone had the perfect texture, was subtlely flavored, and still had bursts of unique and wonderful flavor with the rosemary. Plus it was hot out of the oven...yum! I got the tofu and vegetable scramble, and although it did not have eggs, was the most delicious scramble I have ever eaten. I even soaked up the Asian sauces with the multigrain bread (the sourdough is really the winner though). The potatoes had the skin on and were delicately seasoned and tasty - especially with the addictive hot sauce. My boyfriend had the omelet with venison, preserved lemon, beets, roasted onion, and feta. He loved it, especially after consistently getting bland omelets at every other brunch place. Frustrating.

The griddle cakes were phenomenal. They had this lemony compote that was excellent and the presentation of the plate was very nice. And the tofu scramble was a decent breakfast dish as well, off of their regular menu. The potatoes were great. I feel like this place does sweet better than savory, as far as brunch goes. And finally, it had been a while since I came to Lula and I understand that they are trying to accommodate their expanding clientele but I really wish they had resolved this with anything but shared seating.... they have added one big long table into the newly renovated room. not.a.fan.",0.9909,0.718,0.264,0.018,0.603661251029672

2011-12-15,2.0,"When I describe Lula Cafe in one word--and I do--it's ""pretentious."" I was torn because I've had great experiences at Lula, and some not so great, but the last one has caused me not to go back.  We went for brunch, arriving pretty much at opening time to avoid a long wait. Party of 2: my husband and me--8 months pregnant. We were told the wait would be 10 minutes--and instead, we ended up waiting over an hour, all the while, the hostess sat parties of 3 or more as soon as they walked in the door. Now, as someone who worked in restaurants for nearly a decade, I understand the need to keep larger tables open for larger parties, but to have a number of parties arrive, eat and leave while you have a preggo, or anyone else for that matter, standing in your face at the host stand for AN HOUR is ridiculous.  When we finally got a table, it was the one that sits in the doorway of the entry room, hovered over by everyone else who has been waiting forever for a table. Again, 8 months pregnant, I naturally could only squeeze myself so close to the table. The hostess, the one who had ignored us while chipping away at her nail polish for an hour, sauntered over and loudly asked it I could scoot my chair in so that the people waiting could have a little more room to wait.  I should say--the only reason we waited and stayed was because my husband had never been to Lula and, after hearing rave reviews, really, really wanted to try it. Aside from the hostess, the service was great. The food this time however was just silly.  I get that you're all ""farm-to-table"" but come on.  I ended up ordering a bland strada with stinging nettles and something called ""werp"" which I think was a typo that was supposed to have meant something which had been sourced from Werp Farms in MI. My husband ordered the pork-belly, which consisted of --no exaggeration--two cubic inches of pork fat surrounding a strip of lean exactly as thin as a postage stamp. It was the most expensive thing on the menu because I guess hipsters just can't get enough lard these days. We live in the neighborhood and go out for brunch in the neighborhood every weekend. We have not been back to Lula since and we will not be going back--not when better options continue to open up around them all the time.",0.9777,0.887,0.085,0.027,0.5764285714285714
2011-12-15,3.0,"Hard to believe I've never written anything about Lula. For a long time, after it first opened, it was my favorite restaurant. So, it's great that it's expanded! We all really appreciate the extra space. I was a little sad to find it's lost a bit of the charm of the ""old lula"" where there were no reservations and everyone was crammed into that tiny bar area, but I got over it quickly. Its still a very solid place to go get a good meal in Logan Square. However - for the past 3 years I've been locked into the habit of getting the goat cheese quesadilla for an entree - it's basically the thing that kept me going to Lula for so many years: craving that quesadilla. and now, to my horror, it's not on the slightly updated menu. I got the new quesadilla which was tasty, but in no way comparable to the goat cheese quesadilla. SO SAD! What this means is that, when I have a craving for Lula I have to pinch myself to take away the pain of realizing I can't fulfill my craving - which is just for that quesadilla, not the place itself. I probably went to Lula 15-20 times per year prior to this change up, and probably won't go with any of the same regularity unless they re-add the goat cheese quesadilla. :( Anyway...we sat at the communal table, and it was fine, intimate and quiet. I felt we were actually less close to our neighbors than I used to feel along the wall in the other room.  Oh, the other thing: I had a brain fade upon arrival and couldn't remember the name of the drink I have recently been consuming in most situations...I gave the bartender the main ingredients and he couldn't tell me that I was thinking of a sazarac. come on! it's a standard classic drink! the most important cocktail in american history, some would say. fortunately I had my phone and could look it up. hopefully he was just having a brain fade too...

The bartender had our wine brought to our table since it wasn't ready versus waiting to settle things up with him. Our server came by at all the right times and with the perfect amount of frequency. Coat check was pleasantly unexpected. Someone came by to refill our waters and check in on how the food was tasting. I will add that while I was enjoying the music (Mmmm...rap/hiphop?), I think my parents tolerated it. It's a very minor ""complaint"".

When we went to go check in with the hostess to find out what was going on with our table, she claimed that she couldn't find us.   Lame excuse, yes definitely.  Then we sit down, they gave us some kind of an apple tart for our extra waiting time.  Thanks but no thanks, it'd be really better if you take a discount off our bill.  Then we ordered an waited another 40ish minutes for food.  Do you get the hint here, they make you wait and wait at Lula cafe.  We get our food, and it's decent but is it worth and 1 hr 40 minute wait, definitely not.  So at the point when we get the bill I was saddened to see that they did not take any discount off for the inconvenience.  When I asked for a discount, which I believe was completely warranted a manager came with the check and proceeded to verbally harass us, claiming that we waited the time they quoted us and taking no ownership whatsoever for the mistake. Obviously leaving a sour taste in the mouth, we left as the manager said ""Come again.""  No, I will not be back and also recommend that you get employees that treat your customers with RESPECT!!

First and foremost, they had some very exciting flavor combinations on the menu, such as cinnamon feta pasta. Sounds horrible, but it was really good in fact! They also freely use uncommon spices like cardoon and fenugreek, both great, though not usually in dishes I get. Unique flavors aside, I felt that the food was a bit off. For my main, I got a tenderloin with fried kale, spatzle and oxtail broth. Everything tasted great, but there were some issues. First, the meat was undercooked (it was rare rather than medium). Second, the spatzle was mush. Finally, the food was barely lukewarm, as it was for most of the table. I closed out with a cheese plate which was nice but really a poor value. I essentially got a 2 small bites of 2 average local cheeses and a few sweet sides for $11. The presentation was very nice though. I'd probably go back again if I had the chance because the menu was pretty exciting. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was a mixed bag.

We sat at the table for about 10 mins before our server came.  We ordered some bloodies because we were ready to rage at 10AM on a Thursday.  About 20 mins later our bloodies actually came out...and they could have taken them right back...they were HORRIBLE.  For being known for breakfast/brunch....you would think that they would have some good bloodies...WRONG!  Also, two people had coffee and when our server came to refill, she was dripping coffee all over.  It actually dripped on me and all over my napkin...there wasnt even a notice from the server?!!  Umm, hello..... Finally server came back over to take our order.  Half of us got lunch, half breakfast.  It seemed like an exceptional amount of time before the food came out....I really am not sure what was going on here.  It was just weird.  I had the burrito.  It was good, it wasnt good enough to come all the way over to logan square for it.  I also tried the turkey sandwich, BLT and apple/cheese french toast.  The apple cheese french toast was pretty damn good, however, I dont tend to order sweets in the AM.  Overall, it was a pretty unlightening experience.  I did have the homemade pork sausage.  It was pretty fantastic as well, but for $4 for two very small patties....meh. We then proceeded to wait about 15 mins to see our server again, asked for boxes...waited for 10 mins, she never brought them.  Another lady asked how many we needed and finally brought them over.   We received the check and thank goodness we all had cash and just left it on the table because we would have probably been there for another 30 mins if she would have had to run a credit card.

By 11:40, the place was packed and the wait time was 15 min+.  I started out with a chai, but honestly, it wasn't anything special. It was hot enough, served in a fantastic cup, but it wasn't spectacular or as good as a typical masala chai should be. If you're not expecting authentic chai, you should be ok with it. I had the special of the day: an omelet. It was really delicious. It was served with perfectly seasoned potatoes, and a slice of rye bread. My only complaint? The omelet was small. I guess maybe it was just me. I was really hungry. And it was only one piece of rye bread served with it, and it was cut in half. Maybe it's the super hungry girl inside of me, but I could have eaten two slices easily. And the omelet could have been fantastic with another egg. I won't complain too much though, as everything was cooked very well and the taste was great!  The decor? It was cute and charming. It felt like a cozy place to sit down and grab a boutique-ish meal.

2011-08-25,4.0,"Thank goodness for second chances, because the first time around tragically sucked.  We gave it another go about a year later and it was a completely different experience. First round:   Between the three of us, we'd ordered leek soup (starter), pasta in a tomato sauce with pancetta, pan-roasted chicken, and linguine al mare.  Leek soup is served cold at Lula, and it was very refreshing. Of the three main dishes, only the first- my dish- was worth writing home about.  Good depth and balance of flavor from the pancetta, and I had some excellent cabernet alongside.  As for the others, the chicken was overcooked and not all that memorable, and the linguine was as rank as they come. THAT was memorable, because how on earth can you forget that smell?!   It smelled a rotting baby whale.  There was no way that the seafood could have been fresh. My aunt asked if I wanted a bite and I declined because she was sitting a couple feet from me across the table and I was under the siege of olfactory assault even from that distance. The smell was so distracting that I finally resorted to begging my aunt to send it back .  That folks, is a big deal.  We Asians do not send food back.  Some shit about respect and sucking it up because someone worked hard to feed you, and never ever in the homeland would anyone turn away food once it's in front of you because to do so is to spit in the face of your host.   Anyway, despite the desperate begging, she put on her game face and struggled to finish her dinner.  She got halfway through before tapping out.  Bad move.  That linguine was talking back to her all day the next day.  And THEN, some guy at the table behind us ordered the same dish and all of a sudden we were engulfed in pungent fishiness. Dude.  Whyyyyy???? My own personal hell.  My only consolation was 3 glasses of wine.  Furthermore, we were so unsatisfied with dinner that we stumbled into the Rocking Horse on the walk back and had poutine for ""dessert.""  And beer, because that's the only thing that fills you up when a mediocre dinner leaves you high and dry. Second round: Much better!  Started with pork belly (TANGENT: You have to order this when they have it...pork belly is the reason for living.  This and wine.  Gaaaahhh yes.) and a cheese platter with delicious fig preserves, onion jam, and some type of concord grape-rosewater jelly (don't quite remember exactly what it was, but it doesn't matter because it was tasty). Between everyone at the table, the dishes ordered were roasted duck, glazed shortrib, the pancetta pasta, sea bass, skirt steak, and cassoulet.  Everything was delicious.  Maybe somewhere along the way, Lula fired a shitty cook and found a different seafood supplier?  Very pleasant turnaround, so we'll be back.",-0.7479,0.868,0.06,0.072,0.5549358974358974

So first of all, what a nice area that this place sits on, overlooking logan square, the farmers' market is right accross the street, there're plenty of street (meter) parking so it's nice. We had to wait a bit, about 30-40 minutes or so, it's understanable, 1pm on a sunny, hot summer Sunday at a brunch place in a hip area, what do you expect? We sat in the outside patio, which is nice and shady, so not too hot. The inside is a bit small but nicely decorated. Now, the food, I ordered the strawberry creamcheese french toast and my husband ordered the strada (a savory bread-pudding, with side salad), both items are from their specialty brunch menu. I'm usually not a big sweet tooth, but the description on the item was so attractive I decided to try the french toast, boy was I glad that I did. 3 big pieces stuffed with strawberry creamcheese, blueberries, some orange curd and caramel, I was in heaven. My hubby really enjoyed his dish, too! All and all, we had a lovely brunch and will definitely go back!",0.9922,0.802,0.18,0.018,0.5608906525573192

They don't have a super extensive menu, but a friend of mine had recommended their fancy peanut butter sandwich, so I've been intrigued ever since I heard of this. Me, loving peanut butter, had to give it a shot. So naturally, this is what I order. And it was delish. It was fancy peanut butter, cucumber, lettuce, tomato and some sweet soy sauce or something. I'm not a huge fan of messy meals, and this one was quite messy. The soy sauce seemed to be pouring out of my sandwich every time I took a bite, but I will forgive because it was just so damn delicious. They had a varied selection of appealing sounding cocktails, but for some reason, I wasn't in the mood for one, so I stuck with my diet coke. My sandwich came with a side, and I chose the potatoes. I loved the seasoning; there was definitely some lemon or lime in there, and it created a somewhat unusual taste, but I really liked it! The service was friendly and fairly efficient. I will definitely come back again someday, and hope that I get as lucky as this last time with our prompt seating arrangement.",0.9924,0.697,0.224,0.079,0.6217391304347828

Whenever I go I take full advantage of drinks, entrees and desserts and never leave disappointed.  I love that I have the option to order from the regular side of the dinner menu and the fancy side. The beet bruschetta is huge and incredible and NINE dollars, and the Pasta Yia Yia causes my friend Deb to drive 1.5 hours out here for that alone--garlicky, cheesy, buttery goodness.

The menu seems to highlight subtle savory dishes: roasted chicken, steamed seafood, baked birds, slivers of beets or rhubarbs or scapes and dollops or drizzles of this and that--that sort of thing. There's very much a ""rustic French"" twist on American cooking going on here. And while I truly admire their French-like use of locally and ethically sourced ingredients, I wish to Christ they'd put a couple of dishes on the menu that weren't so dainty, so quaint, and I'll say it at the risk of offending said friends, so dang waspy--both in portions and in flavor.

I first came here a couple of years ago for one of the Monday night farm dinners, which I remember really liking. My second visit was probably about a year later for brunch, which I thought was phenomenal (I had fish crepes of some sort). The third visit was for a regular dinner and I remember that I had a squash blossom entree that tasted great, but was so tiny that I needed a second dinner afterward at home. My boyfriend was with me at the time and commented on the fact that my entree portion size was about half the size of his even though it was priced about the same. Most recently I was here again for lunch and had the turkey sandwich with grilled potatoes as the side. I thought the sandwich tasted good, but it was so incredibly messy that I felt like I needed a bath after I ate it. Also, the multigrain bread was toasted pretty heavily, which meant that the roof of my mouth was completely abraded after eating it. The potatoes tasted way too lemony, which isn't really a flavor I expect with potatoes. I ended the meal feeling like my annoyance with the mess outweighed any satisfaction I had gained from the taste.

In a moment of desperation (or, as it actually turned out, brilliance), I ran down to Lula to see if they might have some lighters they could spare for about 20 minutes.  The hostess not only said yes, but seemed happy to help out, bringing me two of those long candle lighters still in their packages!  Brand new!

I went because a friend raved about their coleslaw which is more of a Western take on kimchi. Yes, it was delicious, but for that price? I will make my own at home. It's cabbage and carrots with a mayonnaise and red pepper sauce, for pete's sake.  The waitress was exceedingly rude and insanely slow. I was dining alone and it was early on during lunch, not very crowded. When I asked for the bill, she'd acted so put out and took over 15 minutes to produce it. Glad I wasn't in a rush.

Our waiter was efficient and friendly (which seems to be par for the course in the area), although everything on the menu was his favorite.  Asking for an opinion on any one dish was met with ""Oh yeah, that's one my favorites.""  It may just be that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but it wasn't super helpful for navigating the many outstanding options. Their M.O. appears to be inventive takes on breakfast standards. For example, take your basic french toast, then fill it with vanilla cream cheese and top it with rhubarb compote.  Or cornmeal pancakes then top them with anisette, basil and honey sour cream. In the end I settled on the strada (bread pudding with mushrooms, caramelized onion and artichoke) while my wife opted for a custom fritata, both of which were indeed excellent and I can see why they were both favorites of our waiter. My bloody mary was tasty, but unfortunately the ice melted quickly in the 80+ heat and it got pretty watered down so I didn't enjoy it all the way through.  Then, upon spying our neighbor's drink, I ordered a bottle of the Bruce Cost unfiltered ginger ale, and you should too.

Let me preface by saying that I'm a condiment junkie.  I put ketchup and hot sauce and almost everything.  Naturally I asked for these staples at Lula, but 15 minutes later, as I lifted my head from the ecstatic, flavor explosion that was my meal, I noticed that I had used neither.   Everything had its own unique flavor, and added ingredient that added a detail seldom found at other restaurants.  For instance, the house potatoes that came with my tofu and vegetable scramble ($11) have a hint of spice and lemon that I could not imagine bastardizing with a splirt of ketchup.  The scramble had diverse textures and a perfect balance of spices.  Ahh... Okay, I need to wrap this up, but let me tell you this one last thing.  As a condiment junkie, I found fulfillment by the homemade jam (by request).  It was basically just organic blueberries in their own sauce.So simple and natural. So delicious.  They change the jam from day to day but I've had it twice now.  Both times it has been stellar. This is just another example of the attention to detail that this restaurant prides itself in.

The swanky, slightly kitsch atmosphere, complete with old baby grands and button wall art, doesn't detract from the real gem of the restaurant-- its delicious, inventive food. My boyfriend and I went for brunch and were served by a fedora capped bald dude whose name is also a stop on the blue line. The home fries are delicious, and the honey butter for toast is a nice touch. Everything was hot. I had an omelette, and it was slightly greasy, all the way tasty, like Sunday brunch eggs should be. Don't expect traditional fare-- everything is slightly tweaked so your meal goes from good to amazing. Also tried was a shrimp avocado burger, reported to be awesome. It came with carrot slaw, an interesting but not disliked extra.  Vegetarians and vegans are defs welcome at Lula-- they'll customize anything to accomodate your dietary restrictions, plus we were told they always have a vegan soup on hand!  Coffee lovers-- their brew is simple and delicious.   In short, Lula Cafe gets the job done.

I had the hanger steak for dinner which was great. My husband had the goat which he loved. There was also a delicious spaghetti at the table and halibut. Overall everything tasted fresh and seasonal.

2011-04-03,3.0,"3.5 Stars Been wanting to come here for a WHILE but was a bit scared of all the reviews about the long wait.  A girlfriend and I were able to come out here for brunch on a Friday afternoon. They wouldn't seat us until our entire party had arrived, which was just the two of us.  We waited about 5 minutes once we told them that we were ready to be seated.  They took us to this corner round table for  two by the old piano. I felt a little cluster phobic and didn't know how to angle my chair and where to put my legs, but it's not a spacious restaurant so I understand the need to squeeze people in as much as possible. Negatives: 1.Unfortunately, we were seated right by this obnoxiously loud girl and she apparently didn't notice that she was out at a public place... Just felt like everyone can hear each other's conversations because of the close proximity of the tables. 2.Our round table was so small that it became crowded with two glasses of water, a cup of coffee and two plates of food... Since we were splitting our dishes, it would've been nice to have couple of extra plates. 3.Not the most friendliest staff on earth. We didn't even get a thank you or a good bye when we were leaving...  Positives: 1. Cute and unique decor. It almost looks like an old house with high ceilings... it was warm and yet a bit rustic if that makes sense... 2.Great tasting food using locally produced produce!!!! way to go!!! (although I was surprised that they offered the Sriracha sauce when I asked for some Tabasco sauce, because the Sriracha (rooster) sauce contains preservatives) 3. Our stuffed Brioche French Toast and the potatoes were really yummy! 4. They serve Lula Cafe Blend coffee created by Intelligentsia. 5. Although not open yet, they have the outdoor seating. I would like to come back again and try some of the other awesome menu items and perhaps, some mimosas? Wouldn't mind trying out their dinner menu sometime in the future...

Cocktails I started with the ""Winter of '75"" featuring cognac, st. germaine, egg white, and rosemary. It was well balanced but I am a huge rosemary fan and the rosemary didn't permeate the cocktail at all. There was a sprig set on top of the egg-white foam but it was releasing no aromas. Normally an herbal garnish would be spanked over the drink to wake it up and I'm guessing that didn't happen because there was literally no rosemary notes in the whole cocktail.  My husband got Red Riding Hood (I think that's what it was called) which was a whiskey drink with fresh cranberry (and other things I'm not remembering). This drink was just overall lacking. I think it needed more whiskey because there just wasn't a lot of flavor going on. It maybe even tasted slightly watered down. Appetizer We shared the Sunchoke bisque and they were kind enough to give us two bowls so that we could both get the garnish. It was pretty fantastic if a tiny bit salty. I definitely recommend it though! Dinner Both entree's were ordered at the recommendation of our waitress who said they were here two faves on the menu. I got the rabbit which came in two forms, the breast meat wrapped in pancetta (yum!) and other meat pulled, layered on top of bread and covered in a washed-rind melted cheese (eh..) It was definitely the better of the two entrees, it just didn't wow me. My husband got the pork shank. He was really excited, especially after he saw someone at a neighboring table get it and called our waitress over to ask what it was. ""That's what you ordered!"". That will do! Unfortunately it was a big let down. It was a little dry and just didn't have much flavor. We took most of it home (including the bones) to make a pork-spinach pizza and stock with the bone.

2010-12-04,5.0,"I've long been a fan of Lula's brunch, but I stayed away for dinner because as a vegetarian the evening menu seemed too meaty. My bad! Dinner was just as good, if not better, than brunch. If you're vegetarian, don't be fooled by the menu's emphasis on meat-based dishes; the veggie options are creative, made with great ingredients, and always taste awesome. The beet bruschetta, for example, sounds unspectacular but is outta this world (and this coming from someone who isn't particularly wild about beets). They recently also had a delicately spiced Indonesian cabbage soup which I would go back for. I can't remember what else I ate, but it doesn't matter, everything was good! Brunch is a little bit more standard, but they do what they do very well. This is no IHOP. The food is elegant but the portions are filling, and though you'll pay a little bit more here than you would at a greasy spoon, it's well worth it. The staff are also always very friendly and accommodating.

2010-11-22,4.0,"And so it's that time of year again when I'm feverishly trying to use all my $10 A La Cards that will soon be expiring. It means I eat out way too much during the month of December. Cafe Lula was one of the cards I needed to use. While I gave a bunch of the cards away, I had been wanting to try Lula anyway, so the $10 card gave me just the kick in the pants I needed. Thanks to a very naughty kitty, my bf and I woke up crazy early on Sunday morning. Like 7:30 crazy. We sat around drinking coffee waiting for Cafe Lula to open at 9:00. We finally arrived at about 9:30 expecting the place to be near empty, reasoning that all the hipsters would still be sleeping. To our surprise, we got one of the last open tables. It seems we had forgotten all about the hipster parent contingency that also gets up early on Sunday mornings and takes their precious Aiden/Isabella out for breakfast. Almost every single table had at least one toddler. I kind of panicked, but with enough coffee, I had hopes to be able to withstand the potential crying that was likely to ensue. Our server greeted us promptly and gave us menus, and more importantly, coffee was brought out quickly. We decided to share both sweet and savory brunch items and chose a build-your-own frittata with tomatoes, spinach and goat cheese and the stuffed french toast. The food came out fast and looked fantastic. The french toast was brioche (which if you make french toast from, is almost overkill), and stacked high with fruit and stuffed with mascarpone cheese and more fruit. The frittata was cooked perfectly - not too hard and not too soft and the ingredients were just the right amount without any one overpowering the others. On the side of the frittata were sauteed potatoes, which had a unique flavor that I had to keep eating to discern. They tasted a bit citrusy, which was nice and unexpected. I asked the waiter what was in them and he confirmed that they put lemon zest in their potatoes, in addition to parsley and garlic. While they were delicious, I thought they could have been a bit crispier. The french toast was rich, eggy and moist, but too sweet for me to eat more than a couple of bites. If you enjoy sweet breakfast items, then you will enjoy this. The server was really cool to talk to, as well as efficient, and kept the coffee flowing. And somehow he magically made sure the little Aidens and Isabellas were on their best behavior; I hardly even noticed 'em. I liked Cafe Lula much more than I thought I would, so it's now earned a spot on the Logan Square breakfast rotation.",0.9977,0.805,0.171,0.024,0.5992049808429116

What shocked me from the beginning was how nice everyone at the restaurant was! From the hostess to the bus boys, everyone seemed genuinely concerned about our experience and meal. Our waiter was terribly patient as we spent more time talking than making decisions and probably slowed up his turning the table.  Once we finally ordered, that's when the magic really started. A roasted feta appetizer to start was enough to shut us up, but each subsequent course was equally impressive. Simple foods, cooked perfectly with great flavors. Vegetarian accessible, if not exactly ""friendly,"" I found plenty of options; the ones I ended up ordering were spectacular.

You will, however, get more than decolletage and schnitzengruben at Lula Cafe. Fall is here and the word for the season is duck - its all over the new menu, and it fills me with pleasure, as I love duck.  The winter squash bisque is perfection personified - the consistency of this soup is lush silky smoothness, punctuated with circular hunks of oat streusel and thin slices of duck breast.  It is simply the best bisque I have ever had.  Do the full Donald and follow the bisque with the entree of duck breast with prosciutto, cooked rare.  It is a juicy smoky treat that you'll love the morning after as much as the evening before.  The barley crepe which accompanies it is a delicious out of left field complement that exemplifies Lula's creativity over the years. Completing the hat trick of duck is a braised entree with gnocchi, and it is a testament to the perfection of the bisque and seared duck breast that a home run on any other menu seems merely satisfactory here. All of which is to say, that while brunch has been Lula's calling card over the years, dinner at Lula Cafe is really surpassing its already high standards.  Its a time bargain, as well, for with all the new restaurants in Logan Square, the wait for a table on Friday night is now de minimis.  But if you do find your table a mere twenty minutes away, bide your time with a High West manhattan -- who knew that Mormons had a way with Rye?

This was a first visit.  I will have to try the pancakes next time before I make a final decision on the place.  Based on dining companion alone, it was five stars.  Lula Cafe was a great place to catch up with an old college roommate.",0.937,0.895,0.08,0.025,0.5277083333333332

She picked out a great moscato wine for me since i dislike the taste of alcohol. It was delicious.  I had the celery soup with came with a very dramatic presentation and tasted so fresh and light. It surprised me in a good way. My cousin had the fried okra and he was said it was quite tasty. For the entree I had the peanut noodles. Which came out with so many different flavors in it. Though I was not hungry and decided to take it to go. My cousin had the pasta and said it was perfect. The next day I ate my left over and it tasted even better than before. I loved that the menu is always changing. And it was great that the food is so unique. I will love to go back and try the tasting menu.,0.9905,0.765,0.221,0.014,0.6365000000000001
2010-09-29,1.0,"Really? $8 for tea???   My mom, who is a senior, ordered a hot tea, she asked for plain green tea.  The waitress quickly told her there was a menu of different types.  My mom barely glanced down at the menu, just figuring plain green tea.  After the waitress told her two different kinds, my mom said Jasmine.  We were shocked when we got the bill and saw $8 for the tea.  The waitress agreed to change it to $5 after I questioned it, but still even that was ridiculous. This was not the only problem.  I ordered the carrot ginger soup, and it was Extremely over-salted.  I ate half ($4 for the small), but it was pretty bad.  It would have been good, if not for the salt issue. Then I felt bad when my mom got her brunch served.  She ordered what was listed on the menu as a ""fritatta,""  but got a flat round plain-looking omelette.  When you order a fritatta, you think of something with a little thickness to it.  This definitely was not that. I grew up in Logan Square and want to like this place because I'm excited to see good restaurants prospering in the neighborhood.  Unfortunately, I've been to this restaurant three times (it's such a convenient location and I always thought maybe I just ordered badly), and have always been extremely underwhelmed.  This place draws indie/artsy types, and the atmosphere is really cool, but they need to rethink their menu if they really want to be known for their food and quality for the price.  This was definitely my last time going there.",0.9548,0.809,0.127,0.064,0.5503384687208215

2010-09-22,4.0,"Lula cares about its brunching crowds. This warms my heart, because really, the menu could do all the heavy lifting here -- the real reason to visit this Logan Square gem is for the menu above all else, after all. Nevertheless, the hostesses kindly address you and remember your information -- a technique not always employed in Chicago. On top of that, while you're soaking up the sunshine of what might be the last beautiful Sunday in 2010, trays of coffee cake with fruit compote emerge from the front door on the hand of a bespectacled server, and you know that you will never have a better brunch experience in Chicago than this. I ordered the tamale, which cam e without a corn husk -- I'm not sure if it had ever met a corn husk, but that's okay with me because the consistency was divine. The wild mushrooms, poblano sauce, and sweet potato made fine accompaniments. And then there was the fried egg -- the universal topping these days. It worked well here. Daniel ordered the summer scramble, which consisted of some scrambled eggs with okra and other vegetables (admittedly, I only tasted the okra -- that mouth-feel trumps all others) atop two biscuits, which floated in a grey-brown pool of pecan gravy. Have you ever had pecan gravy? No? I hadn't either, but let me tell you -- it's miraculous. The problem is, it overpowered everything else -- even the okra at times! -- and transformed the dish into ""pecan gravy over biscuits with [mumble mumble].""

Within five we were called and seated. Brunch specials were eclectic, local, and seasonal ranging from a gorgeous market scramble with kale, chantrelles, mushroom gravy, and homemade biscuits to a sweet 'n' savory melon salad. My dining companion got the corn griddle cakes, the perfect combination of sweet cornbread and a pancake, topped with the last of the season's blueberries, sweet chunks of nectarines, candied pecans, and cornmeal cookie crumbs. It was as delicious as it sounds, promise.  Off of the regular brunch menu I snagged a breakfast burrito with creamy chunks of avocado, a spicy salsa verde, and just-sharp-enough Colby Jack.

Unfortunately, the good is not so good that it's amazing. but, fortunately the bad so not so bad that it's intolerable.  Goods:  *I loved their plates (the actual plates)!

Sort of on a Greek theme minus the feta cheese but with tons of butter.  *They have outdoor seating.  Not so goods:  *Our waiter didn't smile at/with us once, make small talk, etc. Don't worry, he saved that for the other patrons of the restaurant. Very kind of him to save his energy for making someone else's breakfast more enjoyable.  *I've read that Lula uses fresh, organic, local ingredients. Great. So I sure hope that Fox & Obel can say the same because they were dropping off a boat load (rather a van full) of goodies. So much for that ""fresh from Lula"" thought.  *Their fritatta was more of an overcooked omelet gone bad. Dry.

After walking past Lula's, I saw many a patrons enjoying the Monday farm meal, and thought this was a good deal and the food looked and smelled delicious.  To begin, we were seated right away.  And thought, this is going to be a great experience. Man were we wrong. After we were sat, the water came, and our waitress didn't appear for another 15 minutes! When she did appear, she took our drink order, and gave us time to figure out what we wanted to eat. She came back a little while later with our drinks, and took our order.

It seemed like a good deal-1 appetizer Fried okra, with a 3 minute tomato sauce, with a few pieces of crispy pork) 1-Main Entree Hangar steak with a small salad, and 2 sauces, and 1-Desert, an ice cream sandwich. All sounds yummy right? Well sort of. The appetizers came out quickly and were indeed delicious. Crispy, spicy and nicely seasoned. Then we waited for over a half hour for our entree. During that time we saw our waitress...well not so much. She came back to take my husbands empty glass from the lemonatta, and never offered to get another. Thank god for the endless water. Finally our entree arrived. The hangar steak was lukewarm and chewy. But nicely seasoned. The small salad was the best part of it all. Really could have done without the sauces...not so tasty or needed. As for the waitress, she disappeared yet again. To end the meal we were presented with an ice cream sandwich, with a raspberry sauce, and what seemed like canned peaches in syrup and an overly spiced cookie, and ginger whipped cream. (Wow! was it fully of ginger, not to mention the candied ginger pieces on top)  At the end of the meal, our check appeared, and magically so did our waitress. My husband couldn't help but notice, the amount of waitstaff, cooks and runners that were on tonight. And yet all the food came out slowly, lukewarm, and there was our Houdini waitress.

I was SO happy that the tables were not so crazy scrunched together as I find in most upscale Chicago restaurants. We ordered drinks which were delicious and inventive. The food was just okay.

It was nice to grab a vegan dish that felt like I was eating at an actual restaurant and not just paying a bunch of money for something I could have made at home for much cheaper. What arrived was some combination of cubed tofu, tomatoes, broccoli, finely shredded cabbage, miso, and sesame seeds.

Is it a sense of intimidation that you are so boring, and lack a sense of individualism? TV-sitcom look-a-likes might feel this, no?  Well the reason why the people who eat at Lula's are all so interesting-seeming (at least) is because the menu here is so interesting!  This is my favorite restaurant, and I take all visitors & family here to enjoy. This is probably the one restaurant on earth I have been to this many times. I prefer the brunch, but dinner is also good. I come here when I want a full-on flavor experience. Everything is so delicate, so finely tuned, so tasty, so interesting, so rich, so truly yummy!!!  The only thing that has ever disappointed me about Lula's was when my plate was completely cleared off and I still craved more... I sigh and plan my next visit.  The menu changes constantly, sometimes more vegetarian friendly than other times. It's always delicious. Nice desserts, great mimosas. Come here for the good food!

The food, try everything and anything, it's all good. I had brown trout, some of the finest fish I've ever had. Prepared to perfection, with a nice level of detail.

The waitress was amazing from the time we arrived until we left, even making sure our coffee was refilled long after we had paid our tab.  To start I had a cocktail which included whiskey, pickles, salami, aged cheddar....and god knows what else.  A very very interesting drink and, while very tasty, was something I had to gather the courage up to take a sip each time.  Still very inventive and tasty and if nothing else quite the conversation starter. Not sure if it was because we were so happy to be at Lula's or if we were actually famished, but we ordered a LOT of food.  We started with the cheese plate, beet bruschetta, and polenta.  All were of good portions and simply outstanding.  As someone else noted, I think the beet bruschetta is the best beet dish I've ever had.  If you've got 2-3 people, one of these appetizers will definitely be enough food. For dinner the table had the gunthorp roast chicken and spaghetti.   I'm one of these people that doesn't order chicken at a restaurant because if I'm going out I'd prefer something other than simple chicken.  You can't get much simpler than this roast chicken but I promise you, its the best roast chicken I've ever had; a perfect flavor and juiciness.  This chicken, along with the beet bruschetta, is what made my boss make this trek.  The spaghetti was amazing as well - how can you go wrong with bacon in spaghetti?!  Finally for dessert (because why would we turn down dessert?) we had a banana upside cake with chocolate ice cream which was out of this world.   You can tell that this place is focused on putting-up high quality food serving local ingredients.  You can taste the difference in their food and see the savings on their menu.  The value at this restaurant is amazing and I look forward to visiting again in the near future.",0.9973,0.804,0.17,0.026,0.6360446659283866

The dining room is pretty cool with various art gallery-type works on the walls, a piano along one wall, and an old-school cloistered ceiling. The eclectic dining crowd seemed to go well with the piped-in Talking Heads and Stevie Wonder cuts. The brunch/lunch menu has several mainstays, but we all went with the dinner specials. I ordered a Leffe blonde from their eclectic beer selection (curiously, I have only drank Leffe at restaurants starting with ""L"") and it was delicious out of the appropriate Belgian beer glass. My ""pan-roasted Illinois lamb"" dish was tasty and hearty though not filling, with slices of lamb over a bed of split peas and collard greens. I know these were all locally grown and seasonal ingredients, so the meal tasted good! Even better was the banana upside down cake with ice cream, delicious and beautifully presented. My friends enjoyed their selections (spring onion consommé, carrot soup, charcuterie plate, strozzapreti pasta with yellowfin tuna, treacle tart) and had warm memories of carrot cake from a previous meal here.  The service was very good throughout the meal.

So I opted for a blackberry Bellini which was yummy. While waiting to be seated we ordered the quesedilla app and it was REALLY good.  For dinner we were actually pretty disappointed - one of the reasons we decided to eat here was b/c of what was on the menu online. When we got to the restaurant the hanger steak & pork chop entrees were replaced with suckling pig and roasted lamb - boo. I realize the menu is seasonal, but they should update their menu online.  As a result I ended up getting a tky sandwich - which was really tasty, but the side of potatoes were totally cold - annoying. My husband ordered the suckling pig and thought it was OK. I felt especially bad for him b/c we were out for his birthday and he totally had his heart set on the steak :(  Overall I liked it, would recommend it, but don't think I need to go back.

2010-05-02,3.0,"I remember sometime in 2005 or 2006, it became politically correct to make fun of the people that waited hours in line to eat at Bongo Room. Given that, I suppose it's fortunate for Lula's patrons that I don't live nearby, so I can't bask in my own smugness every weekend and point and laugh as they queue up for a thoroughly unremarkable brunch.  That's not to say it's bad. in fact, the only thing I categorically disliked was the beverage I ordered. The ""pickleback"", which the internet would suggest is the name of an actual cocktail, is an affront to lycopene and a backhanded bitchslap to my tastebuds. I was kind of shocked it made the very limited drink list. Our server graciously replaced it with a pleasantly garnished, but otherwise too-cucumbery bloody mary after he saw me make my ""I'm about to vom"" face.  My breakfast dish, aptly named ""lamb sausage and stinging nettle spanakopita with marinated artichokes and potato, medjool dates, french feta, and a 60 minute egg,"" was very decent, but fell slightly shy of the portion size a dangerously underweight individual like myself might seek when recovering from a night of heavy merrymaking at California Clipper. While none of the components of the dish conflicted with one another, nothing really tied it together either. Disappointingly, despite the length of time they took to poach my egg, there was no discernible difference between it and an egg poached under normal conditions in 1/20th the time.  What I don't understand though, is how they knew to begin poaching my egg before I even ordered. Only about 15 minutes elapsed from the time we put in our order to the time we received our food. Either someone went back in time or Lula employs a clairvoyant for egg-making purposes. The latter would explain the gypsy we saw working at the door. I just wish she warned me about that pickleback.

And nothing represents Midwest pretension like Lula Café.  The Birkenstockers who eat the extremely bland and therefore over priced food use words like ""yummy"" and ""delish"" to describe the free range roving, organic food eating, daily bathed in warm spring well water, hand massaged and sung to sleep (for ritual purification) chickens and cows that sacrifice their lives for all the right people.  I remember ordering a plate of grits (clearly Lula's  attempt to be ""ethnic"")  and upon receiving them asked for its natural accompaniment, hot sauce. I was told that  ""such doesn't exists at Lula's""  But after exclaiming ""what type of restaurant doesn't have hot sauce!!"" I was told that the Chef might be able to ""prepare something of similar taste"". The waiter came back with some sort of cranberry dish.  The staff wisp to and from the tables like supercilious eunuchs ready to judge you from above if you don't fit into the Lula caste NPR mold.  Meanwhile fat pink privileged babies - you will notice an abundance of expensive turbo strollers with double Starbucks cup holders attached- run wild screaming at the top of their lungs unchecked.  To even look at their parents( who request only bottled water for their brats) in disbelief might be grounds for you being asked to leave the premises.

That said, I LOVED the atmosphere. Does that make me a hipster wannabe? Maybe, or maybe I just like interesting, comfortable spaces with cool art and fun menus. I could have done without the greasy hair on our server, but his sunny attitude made me look past the gobs of hair product and his skinny jeans.  The menu was one that pains me with too many tantalizing dishes. Duck crepes? Scrapple? Braised short ribs? Yes! Our table split a cinnamon roll which was the best part of my meal. It was lighter and flakier than most, so if you're looking for ooey, gooey, look elsewhere.  Still, the food was fresh, and inventive, but like so many ""organic"" places, I marveled at the fresh ingredients, but was left wondering where my flavor was. I had the duck crepe as reco'd by our darling server, but while it was good, it seemed a little ""one note"" on the flavors (heavy!). My tummy was still a little empty when it was all gone, too.  Coffee lovers will rejoice at the Intelligentisia being served, but since my poor stomach can't take the hard stuff, I was busy watering it down with creamers.  Overall, I'd like to give Lula another shot, but maybe not at brunch. The crowd is a little out of control, and the pricey food left me satisfied, but not excited to go back.

2009-09-20,3.0,"Full review in blog. Bongo room, M. Henry, Over Easy, Orange, Yolk...and then?  Lula of course.  Perhaps the most highly praised of the Chicago Breakfast/Brunch scene, but also the location with the most variable menu and obscure location, I will admit the small organic sidewalk café had escaped my attention on both previous visits to Chicago.  Turned onto the location by a fellow epicure and hungry after a long morning run following a great night of sleep without plans until late afternoon I figured we should see what they hype was all about.   Driving up to the small (dare I call it dingy?) location and browsing shortly for a parking spot a meter opened up and we made our way up to the restaurant by 9:30 - well before it filled up.  Seated immediately outside at a rickety 2-top (thank goodness, I preferred the unstable table and steel chairs to the 'noise' they called music inside...it was worse than that at Orange and even less necessary) we were handed the day's menu and offered coffee or cocktails.  Opting for a coffee myself (no sweet n' low at Lula) while my sister selected a Chai (frothy and decent) we waited only moments until our drinks arrived and we placed our orders.  With things going well so far we watched myriad morning walkers with any number of unique dogs pass by and commented on how nice the location actually was dining al fresca.  Having finished my first cup of coffee quite quickly I asked a young man for a refill and was told he'd be right back.  Some time passed and no one returned, but after walk to the restroom inside I returned to find our appetizer pastry had been delivered - a buttermilk pecan coffee cake with brown sugar icing and toasted Pecan butter.  Having previously had the best coffee cake ever at Dottie's True Blue back in May my expectations were high and they were met with ease.  Creamy and dense the cake itself was only mildly sweet and tasted ""biscuit-like"" with hints of cinnamon and candied pecans.  The topping, multiple ""lumps"" of buttery brown sugar was absolutely astounding and the addition of the pecan butter only added additional nuance with its smoky yet mild undertones bringing forth the cinnamon notes.  Liking the dish as much as I, my sister thieved most of the dish - though I'm sure she'll deny this. Still awaiting my coffee refill (as two servers stood around chatting across the way) another young lady who I'm almost positive was hung over or stoned walked up to collect the plate - I asked her for a coffee refill and was told ""I'll tell your server.""  Time passed...and passed...and passed...finally the young man from previous arrived and I asked him again about the coffee - he finally flagged down our server who'd not visited us since taking orders and I got another cup.  Without belaboring the issue this theme recurred through the main courses and I only got a third cup poured when I essentially stood up and waved to the young man again and he personally came and filled our cup...lets just say I hope our server didn't get any of my minimal tip. When mains did arrive they were absolutely worth the trip, the price, and even the sub-sub-par service.  For my sister, Gingersnap Pancakes with Poached Pears, Caramel, and Spiced Anglaise was absolutely divine with five thin flapjacks panfried to a perfect golden and topped with wine-poached pears, caramel crumbles, and a spicy sauce featuring high notes of cinnamon and nutmeg over a spicy clove base - a very impressive dish. My selection, the other sweet of the menu, was White Chocolate Custard Stuffed Brioche French Toast with Klug Farm Raspberries and Sugar Cooke Crumbles...it was every bit as good as it sounds.  Thick cut and buttery the brioche could have easily held up toasted on its own.  Instead of doing this, however, the slices of bread were sandwiched artistically around a creamy custard with soft chocolate tones and topped with perfect late-summer raspberries and a raspberry compote.  Adding just a mild bit of contrast, like the crumbles on the pancakes, were truly small chunks of a buttery and sugary cookie.  On par with the French Toast at m.Henry or the Griddle Café in Los Angeles and as such in my top three all time. Receiving our modest bill I must say that all the rumors of the great food at Lula Café are true - it was amongst my top breakfasts of all time and reminded me very much in terms of quality to Canteen in San Francisco - no slight praise.  Given the light customer load throughout the meal, however, I have to note that the service was aloof to the point of not being ""hipster cool"" as the restaurant seems to aspire to be, but rather just cold and inattentive.  While I certainly don't expect 3-Starred Michelin service at a breakfast joint, a smile, a refill, and a ""how ya doin?"" is even par for the course at Denny's.",0.9988,0.825,0.145,0.029,0.5275926437628564

We ordered the following off of their Cafe Menu: 1) pasta yiayia, which is bucatini pasta with moroccan cinnamon, feta, garlic, and browned butter; 2) spaghetti with sweet and spicy chile 'salsa rossa', bacon, virgin olive oil, and queso fresco; 3) Moroccan chickpea sweet potato tagine with arugula, saigon cinnamon, and couscous.  We decided that the best dish was the Moroccan tagine my sister had which blended the flavors masterfully. My spaghetti was far too salty. Since they used bacon liberally in the dish (no opposition here), they should have scaled back the salt they added, or perhaps put less bacon in it. You tasted the potential for the dish to be fab underneath the brininess. Likewise, the pasta yiayia was overpowered by the feta cheese.  Maybe they were having an off day but they have to work a little harder at balancing the very strong flavors they incorporate into these dishes. Having said that, I would definitely return to see if they have achieved culinary equilibrium because they have such unique offerings and in such a cool spot: in the shadow of the Logan Square monument. I would caution you from sitting outside as they don't provide enough shade (i.e. table umbrellas) and you will be in direct sunlight - unless they've since acquired some.

Anyway, after a near-complete recovery (at 4pm), I wanted to get outside and eat something, and not stray too far from home.  After a little walking, I decided to follow up on the good things I've heard about Lula.  The patio and inside decor was tight and slick, but completely inviting and cozy.  It certainly looked casual enough for me to sit down and rub my head for a while as I ate something light. The staff was friendly and prompt the second I walked in.  I was helped by four different staffers over the course of my meal, but never felt like I was being helped too much.  Also, if I can be a creep for a second, they were some of the prettiest ladies and gentlemen that have served me food. The main reason I rated Lula 4 stars is because their food menu seemed a bit short and inaccessible to me.  Maybe it's because my hungover mood had me feeling all simple and direct, but I couldn't get a taste for the entrees by reading them, and I ended up making a choice I was not particularly certain of.  Lula's strength is most likely in its wine list, which I am not exactly qualified to judge. I ordered the pasta yiayia - pasta with brown butter, feta cheese, toasted garlic clove shavings and cinnamon.  I was not in the best shape to fully enjoy the creativity, but it tasted fantastic.  I ended up recommending it to the couple sitting next to me when I overheard the waitress politely and unobtrusively pointing out my table when they asked about it.

It was close by, although I was always disappointed with the amount of food.   I am a vegetarian, who buys local when possible and won't eat bacon or at McDonalds (see Jason P's review). I was usually already annoyed at Lula's, because toast is one of those words which is plural and singular; and Lula takes it to the singular side. I mean come on- where else do you go for eggs that they only give you a piece of toast.  Second, as a local-farm purchasing vegetarian, I knew that they used local products- so that made me feel better. The last time I was there (which is over a year now, because I will not go back) they had local, organic VEAL on the menu. VEAL? Really? Veal is one of the most inhumane items of meat and they are saying it's local and organic. Remember, I am a vegetarian and I actually care about these things. I would think, obviously wrongly, that Lula would also put some thought into something like that. 3rd, my bill came with an invite/advert for their new restaurant in Pilsen. There goes the neighborhood! Those who care, know that Pilsen is fighting some serious gentrification. Lula's  is certainly not going to help the issue.",0.8017,0.877,0.075,0.049,0.39153363997113994

And as for overwhelming, do yourself a flavor favor and order a side of the sausage patties - damn. well done. So, why am I so down on a place that I agree has really good food?  It was mainly things besides the food, some of the intangibles: weak service, a seemingly long wait for food, none of the menu options felt super enticing, prices felt high.  I agree that a lot of these things are difficult to quantify, but I think they can be as equally important.

I was very impressed with the freshness of the ingredients. Everything was well seasoned with some nice twists. Their chilled peanut satay noodles with Tofu had a really nice flavor and a good kick. Now the ""just ok"".....Lula offers a 3-egg Frittata but I just wanted a plain ole omelette. The waiter wasn't sure if he could do that. Really? I was charged a dollar more for less egg and one less ingredient. The omelette was ok as I could have made a better one myself....the toast was served without butter or jelly...or anything to dress it-just a dry piece of slightly toasted wheat bread. And the bad....my party ordered Sangrias. For 8 dollars, I was expecting better. It was ok....nothing special. I can make a better one with 3-Buck-Chuck and Minute Maid Fruit Punch (which is delicious btw). All in all....this place is just ok but it does offer a cute atmosphere and extremely fresh food.

2009-06-03,4.0,"Lula was the site of my most recent book/brunch club meeting. Our May read was Animal, Vegetable, Miracle by Barbara Kingsolver. It's a nonfiction account of understanding what it takes for our food to make it from farm to table and its impact on the environment. It was a fantastic read, one of the few choices everyone in the group was enthused to discuss.  The dominant theme of the book was getting as close to your food sources as possible be it by growing it yourself, obtaining it from local growers or going without. Lula was selected as the place to discuss the book for their integration of seasonal, local and organic produce in their menu.  I was extremely excited to try Lula, it's been on my book/brunch club wishlist for a few months now. It did not disappoint, everyone raved about their meal. I got the buttermilk pancakes served up with the seasonal fruit; since I'm not one for preserves I got it with just bananas. My cakes looked were so yummy I had the other bookclub ladies drooling over them! I also got a side of home fries, which were fantastically well-seasoned new potatoes.  When we arrived there was a bit of a wait, which was to be expected since it was Sunday brunch and one of the first gorgeous Sunday's of the year. If you come with a group they won't seat you until the entire party has arrived so you may want to slip the latecomers an earlier meeting time. The space is small and the plates are big so we had to get creative to keep all the plates on the table.  Bottom line: The food is wonderful! Given that they rely heavily on local food sources the menu changes frequently. I can't wait to come back, maybe next time I'll do dinner.",0.9881,0.885,0.115,0.0,0.4161616161616162

The wait was a little long - so I can definitely see how some people wouldn't want to deal with the wait... but they are nice enough to leave a cooler of water out for you to drink.. and someone came around offering up samples of their lemon poppy seed bread.. and I think you can always go up to the bar and order mimosas or coffee to sip on while you wait for your table.  Its not like its a bad neighborhood to have to sit outside and wait for anyway.  So we got seated about 30 minutes later.. (I guess not terrible for 12:30 on a sunday) and ordered a tasty bloody mary - reasonably priced for the size drink you get - I couldn't finish it (although spicy stuff takes longer for me to eat/drink anyway)  We decided to split the porridge to start... oh my god.  best oatmeal/porridge EVER.  It came with stewed rhubarb, dried tart cherries, whipped cream and chopped pistachios!  So you get the whole combination of chewy, sweet, tart, crunchy, salty, and smooth all in one freaking bite!  I hope I can one day try to recreate such a dish at home!  Geez.   So after that - I ordered the eggs florentine, which were fantastic - two poached eggs on top of spinach, asparagus, morels, & nettles with sourdough crostini, hollandaise, and pickeled radish.  Wow.  My friend had the quiche tart, with duck, fennel, lambs quarters and gruyere.  To finish off - they gave us the cinnamon swirl coffee cake with a creme anglais... (we didn't order it I swear!)  as much as I wanted to eat the whole thing... i was so full I could only get in a few bites.  This place is worth the wait - I'm glad she took me here!",0.9937,0.798,0.163,0.038,0.575277777777778

The soup was poured tableside and had a beautiful green color, perfect spring flavor. Entrees included the grilled pork chop with german potato salad gnochhi, flank steak. The gnochhi had a subtle german potato flavor and was not overpowering. Pork chop was good. My husband raved about the steak. For dessert, although I'm a chocoholic, we had carrot cake. I did not regret it. Moist cake, and the cream cheese frosting was not too sweet. Rhubarb crumble was tempting. Great seasonal menu. Good vegetarian choices, too. Sangria was very good.

I love great coffee, as I take it like a man--strong and black. Their coffee is good. Food--I love how the flavors are so fresh, but not overdone. They let the food shine through.

I've had numerous things on the menu, from the club sandwich to the numerous Brioche French Toast specials...and they are all tasty. Cocktails were good...and actually not too overpriced. They didn't make them too sissily (that's a word, right?) either. I ordered a girly drink, but there was plenty of vodka in it. Why 4 stars? Well, I plan to update as I continue to go.

Our large group of eight was accommodated relatively quickly although we were enjoying monopolizing the bar.  The group ordered from both the specials menu and their regular menu.  Beet bruschetta was a hit, my tagine was flavorful (although they loaded up on the cilantro, I just put it aside) and the duck breast looked and tasted good.  The rigatoni was underwhelming and the Yorkshire pudding was slightly burnt - maybe it's supposed to be??   The carrot and coconut soup was excellent - I think Lula should open a soup only restaurant.  Table side soup service, nothing but bowls in the restaurant and big soup spoons.  Servers walk around with baskets of bread and there's a guy in the corner making butter the old fashioned way with the wooden churn.  Anyways. The dessert was a wee bit disappointing.  Carrot cake was solid, the flan itself was good, but the other thing it came with was meh, and for the walnut fritters, the sum of the parts for the dish was greater than the whole.  But I appreciate the creativity of it. I went the first week of April and the artwork they were displaying was just bold and set a great mood for dinner.  It was definitely an MCA-type mixed media work.  On a related note, all restaurants and cafes should NOT put identifier tags next to the artwork.  It's a major distraction.   Good for Lula for not doing that.

And I always walk away feeling warm and happy, and somehow able to face the freezing streets afterwards. The staff are friendly, the people are friendly. I dine here alone often, and people will start talking to me, but not in a creepy way. I usually am not into random conversations with strangers, but they always seem sincere here. They have soy milk (not as common in Chicago as I would like) and their coffee is no nonsense and good. Their savoury brunch items are insane and delicious. I even dared a sweet once, french toast (not my style), on account of the promise of rhubarb compote, and I was delighted. Hooray for Lula Cafe.",0.9795,0.69,0.235,0.075,0.6073529411764705

Their veggies are fresh, their sandwiches are crispy, their specials will blow you through a wall with awesomeness. (Try the hand-cut pasta with duck sausage, pine-nuts, and gorgonzola.

2009-03-15,3.0,"Acceptable to good food, poor service. My friends and I came here on a Sunday afternoon.  We anticipated there would be a wait and didn't care.  What we did care about was that when we put our name in the hostess said she would check to see how long the wait would be, and then she proceeded to ignore us as we stood around the host stand for the next 15 minutes.  Finally we again asked her how long the wait would be, and she told us it depended on if another party showed up for their reservation (or maybe they had put their names in earlier).  Since it seemed like we might be waiting for awhile, we decided to grab a pre-lunch cocktail at the bar.  I had the sangria which was actually bad (how do you screw up sangria?) and way overpriced at $8 a glass. One member of our party still had not arrived by this point, but we were eventually seated anyway and were told that we could order brunch, but the final member of our party could not (since they were getting ready to put away the brunch stuff in the kitchen).  Okay, kinda weird, but fine.  When we got to our table we were only given lunch menus, I asked to see the brunch menu and was snippily told by our server that they were no longer serving brunch.  Okay....fine.  She then disappeared for a few minutes and reappeared telling us that since we had been waiting since before they ceased serving brunch, we could have brunch menus but that again, the last member of our party couldn't have brunch.  Okay, fine, we get it.  The server maintained this snippy, unfriendly attitude until we paid our bill, at which point we were finally graced with a smile.  I guess we tipped sufficiently. I did ultimately wind up ordering off the hard-won brunch menu and went with the key lime stuffed brioche french toast, as did another member of my party.  We both agreed that that dish was really good.  The two other  member of my party opted for the pasta yiayia ( bucatini with moroccan cinnamon, feta, garlic, and browned butter) which sounded really interesting but which was disappointingly bland and roast turkey sandwich which my friend reported was ""just okay.""

If you order right (at breakfast, lunch or brunch), you can keep your bill for two under $30 - and that includes tip.  I don't normally order any drinks other than tea or coffee.  The breakfast burrito is amazing, it's the one thing I almost always order. The lunches have consistently been great: salads, soups and desserts - many seem so simple but are pretty healthy and the ingredients always seem very fresh.   Once for breakfast I went a few minutes before they were open but it was cold out and the owner saw me out there - he let me in anyway.  The kitchen wasn't ready but they seated me and served coffee.  They win big points with me just for that.  Then I ordered the oatmeal and wasn't expecting anything special.  They made it with dried cherries, cinnamon and bananas.  I loved it.  The presentation was really nice and it was just enough.  I really enjoyed that breakfast, and the service was great. So, stay away for dinner but go for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  The wait can be long.  I do recall that one time, there was a woman passing out samples of their desserts and scones to the crowd in the waiting area, so that was really nice.  I hope they keep that up.  It makes the long waits a little less annoying.",0.9928,0.794,0.169,0.037,0.5844568452380952

Yes, I'm entirely behind the 8-ball having just visited Lula Café for my official Logan Square cherry popping brekkie yesterday, but forgive me, it took awhile to put together proper hipster brunching attire. Armed with a rainbow vest I still own from the early 80's, I made the trek to LSquare for some amazing brunch grub... and my-oh-my, was the wait very much worth it!!  Anticipation can have it merits... and it's downfalls... I had Lula so built up in my head from all the hype I'm almost half-expected it to fail miserably. Lucky for me the only element of fail was the wait... I went really late on a Sunday for brunching hours (at 1:30pm) and there was still an hour wait. Popular, aren't we? Fortunately, I was able to pass the time saddled up to their quaint bar with the company of a delightful bartender and several rounds of signature Lula blackberry cava bellinis. Liquid Loveliness!! The restaurant is small, but cozy... local art and buttons galore adorn the brick red walls - informal, relaxed, comfortable - ideal for Sunday Funday! The menu also is small, but robust in it's choices... I was really impressed with it's diversity and 'foodie' element in brunch options... lamb stew, brioche bread pudding with calvados créme, sweet arborio rice 'porridge' with strawberry broth. Um, in a word, WOW. This ain't diner food... though (narsty) Johnny's next door will be happy to accommodate in that arena.

He pointed me toward their special rushing waters trout eggs 'florentine' with pickled green tomatoes, hollandaise, and poached eggs on sourdough crostini - he called it 'epic' and how can I turn down epicocity even if trout coupled with runny eggs totally scare me?! I dove in feet first and am entirely thankful; it was gorgeous, delicious, perfection. Huzzah exquisite Miss Lula!!

The Custard stuffed brioche french toast was so intensely good it made my nips hard! Everyone else had some variation of eggs and they all smelled and looked great...I'm guessing since our table went silent for a good 20 minutes that everyone was pleased with their order. Try the blackberry bellinis they were sweet and delicious, skip the bloody mary it's way too thick and soupy. The only downside (besides my Campbell's Tomato Soup-Mary) was the evil evil hostess! She scurred me...I was afraid to ask her anything because I saw the pure joy she experienced when talking down to the other patrons, I didn't want to be that person.

2008-09-15,4.0,"Well, I finally went there. And with great trepidation. Fears of long lines on the record rain weekend, fearing lines around the corner, under an umbrella which no longer seemed to stave off the pounding rain, surrounded by leering indie rock slackers all of them with that eat s**t look on their face like so many pics in the Reader Music section. Dismissive and pretentious staff. But Nooooooooooo...it was't like that at all! (Probably because we managed to get there by 9:30 a.m. on a Sunday morning.) The place was pretty full considering the  hour. The staff were gracious, friendly and fun. The interior was somewhat as I'd pictured it, and it had the comfortable old-shoe feel, much like the feeling I've had in so many Pacific Northwest places. In fact, whenever I am in Logan Square, which is infrequently, i feel as if I am in some other town and state. That huge park and rotary, the monster monument there, the apartment buildings which don't seem like Chicago apartment buildings. So it felt more like a trip out of town than just down Kedzie. I ordered the manly quiche, which had basil sausage, and I may have coerced Doug into the Strata, so natch, I could have half. The strata had spinach and Manchego (sp?) cheese, and was a superb, silky creamy, cheesy treat. Thick, too. The quiche was an individual one, which was quite small but absolutely delicious. It was accompanied by a light salad of greens, and very thinly sliced radishes. Perfect tonque shui with those little tubers in there. All during the meal, I envied the Russians at the next table with the ginormous cinnamon roll with fresh berries. But I settled for my low carb (being so used the toast and hash browns Chicago-standard breakfast) choice. And the rich, rich coffee, my baseline for any decent breakfast place. I figure it doesn't hurt once in awhile to eat a moderate Sunday breakfast. Only one teensy-weensy complaint for a place flaunting freshness. I really wanted to eat the grapes on my plate, but they were all ripped and rusty, like the ones that you find under the bags of grapes at ""Da Jewel."" Couldn't really eat them. Kinda nasty. I really enjoyed Lulu's and would probably like to return for dinner sometime. By the way, the ladies room has fantastic lighting. I would love to know where they got it.

Lula brunch is frikin awesome for lack of a better way of putting it.  It's the only place I'd wait as long as I sometimes must.  I often opt for the first-come-first-serve bar to speed things up, but I hate doing that seat vulture move.  Though do it I will.  For Lula.  I'm always so excited to see what the specials of the week are.  Although the regular selections are excellent too... I love the salmon scramble, breakfast burrito, and brioche (note: this one sells out fast every weekend).  As good as the dailies are, it's great to experiment w/ specials b/c you can almost never go wrong.  They know how to combine interesting foods into flavor explosions.  It's one of the only places I (comfortably) order meat b/c it's organic and I know it won't gross me out.  Ok, sometimes the steak is a little grizzly, but that's an exception to the rule.  I used to live a few blocks away and probably went once per week.  I even played hookie once to go there w/o a wait (weekdays are super chill).  I was looking over my shoulder nervously the whole time, and it was still worth it.   The people watching is great, although some of the customers' pretense gets a little old.  But I'm willing to overlook it for the place's excellent aesthetics... w/ its inevitable crowd the place has a wonderful buzz.  And I adore the explosive button art above both the booze and barista bars -- I think it was done by Anders Nilsen, a local artist/writer extraordinaire.  The other art changes every couple months or so and always provides some cool food for thought.   Dinners are also not to be missed, and if you want to drink on the cheap they have $2-3 PBRs.  Another notable item, if you like peanut noodles, is a delicious lunch/dinner item of cool peanut noodles, cabbage, and tofu.  Yum.  Damn, I'm hungry.

One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Not only because the food is fab, but also because the atmosphere is so cozy - think converted loft + original rotating art + chill music selections. Perfect for a date night. Other pros: -One side of the menu stays the same and always affordable! (highly recommend the Pasta YiaYia) = $8. Cinnamon, Feta, garlic, butter...mmm.

And people, yes the specials are a bit pricey, but it's all organic and local... what do you expect? -Many veggie options -Seasoning and spices are always well done -Wine list is tops -plenty of street parking (but hardly any cabs). Blue line is a 3 min walk. Con (and there's only one): -Prepare to wait.

So I broke into a huge smile (especially since I was absolutely starving) when the hostess called my name just after 15 minutes....already a fan of Lula! I enjoyed the funky atmosphere (perhaps I should decorate the walls of my new condo with buttons? :)) and the timely yet unobtrusive service was perfect.  I have a thing for homemade granola these days so I was excited to see it on the menu, which came mixed with some fruit and organic yogurt.  After my intense spinning class this morning I was worried it wouldn't be enough food so I also ordered a side of whole wheat toast.  The toast was unnecessary because the granola and fruit bowl was very large, but of course that didn't keep me from eating it all. Rob's breakfast burrito looked delicious as well. Elizabeth's scrambled eggs didn't look too exciting, but she seemed to enjoy. Brunch for 3 people came to $30- not bad!

They had seating outside, a bar and a few seats inside... shoot was this it? My bruncherinas, (brunch dining companions), said we had a 45 minute wait, good time to hear updates on their weddings, work, life, getting grilled on my dating life.. then before we knew it, our table was ready! Perhaps maybe in 20mins if that. We were taken to the room next door, I guess I was wrong about my earlier thought of cramped space. We were warmly greeted by our server, handed our menus, along with a drink menu. Perhaps if my stomach was up to it I would have ventured for a bellini, but I just went with the straight up freshly squeezed OJ. I went with the breakfast burrito, filled with avocados, eggs, potatoes, peppers, cheese in a flour tortilla and served with tomatillo salsa and sour cream. I also got the sweet maple chicken sausage. I think the only complaint I had about the tortilla was though I appreciate the heating of the burrito and toasting the tortilla, it made the tortilla a little dry and tough to cut through.... or maybe I had a dull knife. Aww but it was still hella good and tasty as were the sausages. Andrea had her granola, yogurt and fruit, certainly a hefty size, I was a little impressed her dainty self polished as much of it as she did. Elizabeth did a little more standard eggs with fruit and toast, though I did think it was very cool that they also had organic eggs available too.

Also, I have to agree with others here: the portions are perfect.

There is nothing more satisfying that being able to enjoy an appetizer, an entree, and dessert without feeling like you are stuffing it all down. I am consistently amazed with how much I can enjoy a meal there. While the standard fare is all excellent, because of the little Lula twists they put on things, the not-so-standard Tineka sandwich is easily one of the most flavor-intensive sandwiches I have ever tried. And I've had a lot of sandwiches, one time I made a sandwich out of cucumbers and butter and salt. It was barely even a sandwich. So keyword with Tineka is: flavorexplosion. That being said, it is a mistake not to run through their special entrees, which are usually around for a month or two or three. I actually don't know, but they do change, I can say that. Another thing that Lula is mindful of, and for which I am eternally grateful, is how desserts pair up with the special entrees. The bads? Only a couple. 1. Whenever you are like, ""hey let's go to lula that will be fun. Oh, I am hungry right now, just a little though"" and then your friend says, ""oh no problem. whatever."" and then you get there and the wait is 4 MILLION YEARS. The infamous brunch is also a hard one to get into, you just have to time it just right. 2.

Also, the counter is fun because you get to watch them work in the kitchen and see what yummy things other people ordered. Things I enjoy: Great soups! I don't think I've ever had a soup here I didn't enjoy. Beet Bruschetta - sooo tasty. It's served with yummy potatoes as well, and is really a generous enough portion to be a meal all on its own. The specials - always something interesting and while some appeal to me personally more than others, I think you can find something for almost any taste. Yummy, yummy desserts - just thinking about them makes my mouth water, as I invariably want one of everything.

Logan Square is two bus rides away, so I don't make it over there very often. But now a couple of friends have bought a house within walking distance of Lula, so I have a good excuse to visit. We went there on a Monday night, which is good for two reasons: 1) it's a little less packed, at least if you get there early (say 6pm), and 2) they offer their Monday Night Farm Dinner, which is three courses for 24 bucks. Excellent. I'm a sucker for duck, and the night I went they were serving duck breast with a spring onion tart and a poached duck egg. Think of it as duck two ways. So yeah, while Lula has plenty of veg offerings, they feed both animals and their young to the carnivores. The appetizer was littleneck clams, of which my only complaint was that I needed more than one crostini for all the sweet sweet juice. I would gladly have partaken of any of the other offerings at out table, which included leek and carrot soup, giant and tender seared scallops, roasted skate, and a pasta in browned butter with feta and cinnamon. One of my fellows had a dessert which included toasted rice ice cream, which was surprisingly wonderful. As should be apparent, Lula ain't for your standard meat and potatoes crowd. The food is thoughtful, organic, and more important, delicious. Some reviews complain about the portion size, and while you won't leave bloated, there's nothing ""precious"" about it. If we weren't so spoiled by restaurant servings that are three to four times as large as they should be (does anyone really need a 12 oz steak?), Lula's offerings wouldn't seem slim. The room is crowded, even if it's not full, so if you're a xenophobe, you might want to consider another eatery. I found service fast and friendly, but it was a Monday night, it was early, and I was with three friends who made the time pass quickly.

Isn't that part of the waiting game, that a few of you aim to arrive early to put your party's name on the list? Then, when I informed her that we were all present, she sighed, ""I honestly don't know; everyone's being so difficult today.""  Again, what?!?  My plate, eggs florentine featuring skate, arugula, and olive tapenade, was elegant and well-balanced; the skate was positively buttery yet crispy on the edges, the arugula was wilted just so.

The food here is seriously delicious.   I love the brunch fritatta, strada, etc.  The wine is great and the dinners are fabulous as well... so why only four stars?  (Note, this review comes from a loyal/frequent Lula-er) 1. I love the fact that they get all their food locally, so the specials are always fresh and amazing.  But if nothing on the specials sings to me (or if I am allergic to the ones that do), the regular menu is kind of stale.  I have been praying for an update. 2. The service is hit or miss.  I have encounterd the kindest of servers, but one of the hostesses could use a lesson in hospitality (read: common sense)- she actually sat me at the tiniest table in an aisle.  I had a giant cast on my leg, and it didn't fit under the table.  A very friendly server finally adjusted our seating to accomodate my handicap.  I was super embarrassed though.  3.

The food actually isn't quite my style, as its flavors aren't as aggressive as I favor.  However, I give them points for their solid execution and committment to quality ingredients at accessible prices, and still somehow love coming here every time.  Don't bring an old-style foodie like my mom, who cares about classical techniques and building flavors.  They are just so-so at those things.  Do bring a contemporary foodie, who will love the the inventive (for Chicago) menus and the special ingredients from boutique name farms and local sources.

The flavors are F'n awesome and the dish is quite filling from the browned butter and cheese.

I had the breakfast burrito (as did about 3/4 of the restaurant) and an almond sticky bun.  For about 10$ for both, this place is a steal! Much more satisfying than any Lincoln Park/Lakeview eatery.

2007-01-21,5.0,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the world. And yes, I mean it. Not just in the United States, or North America. I am talking globally. And I've traveled enough and eaten in enough places to at least say this with some degree of certainty. Few restaurants are able to manage a menu that allows for both gourmet, extravagant meals as well as simple, everyday dinners. While the dinner specials can vary widely in their quality, and I've had mediocre, scrawny duck that was entirely not worth the $25 price tag, I've also tried revelatory lamb carpaccio and a variety of other pastas, soups, and desserts that show the chef-owners' willingness to take chances, even if that means they sometimes fail. Lula's brunch menu is deservedly renowned. I won't even bother going into that topic, but suffice it to say that at one point, I ate brunch there every single weekend for a year (at least if I was in town). It's also worth noting that Lula is open on Monday night, when most finer restaurants are closed. This is their opportunity to offer a ""farm dinner,"" a three course prix fixe meal based solely on what the chefs feel is of the best quality at the moment. For $24 (I believe) you will not find a better deal in the city, since each meal is essentially served only once. I'd also highly recommend the organic roast chicken. At $12 or so for a giant half of a bird, accompanied by roasted potatoes and flavorful sauteed spinach, it's one of the best bargains I've ever found. But honestly, if you can only go once, go for brunch. Be prepared to wait, but once you're seated you'll find truly incredible food that's creative and yet utterly filling and comforting.

Occassionally they have too many hipsters lurking about and thereby tipping the scales of  ""cool"" in the direction of the gag factor. 3. Occassionally the wait staff has been distant and/or inattentive.  However, Lula Cafe is still on my list of great places to go because of the intrigue of ""what will it be this time?"" Call me a sadist, but I find the inconsistency of experience kind of interesting if sometimes annoying.  On a brighter note, the food is quite simply excellent. There is not a better place in the city to spend a Tuesday afternoon sitting on the patio sipping some bourbon and snacking on the some of the best pancakes known to mankind (not the professional wrestler, he only eats the flesh of dead babies).  Anyhow... they serve bourbon so they were going to get five stars, but the inconsistency of service and/or room to accomodate incoming diners (mainly) knocks them down a notch to four stars.  *goes back to sipping bourbon*",0.8052,0.816,0.105,0.079,0.5462962962962964
2006-07-31,3.0,"Only been here once for brunch.  Food was great--can't remember exactly what I ordered though..I was severly hungover to hell.  My date tells me it was a fritatta, I believe...I'll have to see what all the fuss is about.  One thing, this place is PACKED!  Hard to maneuver inside and I hate sitting right next to complete strangers at those stupid two seat tables.  It seems like a great place (which is why it is so crowded) but if it were to be in a larger building, it would lose all it's charm. I think they should redesign the layout in the place better instead of just taking the old 'pack 'em in like sardines' attitude with regards to the crowds. The staff was really nice--I don't mind hipsters as long as they aren't being snotty assholes or trying to play the part too hard. Getting too old for that nonsense when I'm tipping good money. I'll be back to try the other dishes here and maybe try a seat at the bar, although there seemed to be a huge wait for seating of any kind.  ( I met someone here who already got a seat.)Parking can be found on and around the block.",0.9408,0.76,0.148,0.092,0.5092403628117914
2006-05-13,4.0,"Man, Lula pisses me off a little bit. If the head chef is there, you're in for a quality fucking experience. But if he's not there, I think the helper chefs just wank off and serve up whatever fell off the returned plates. They have a really exciting menu that changes weekly-ish, and inventive cocktails like the rhubarb gimlets I downed last weekend. Not last winter, but the winter before, they had this omelette that had shredded winter root vegetables in it and brie, and it was the most amazing thing I've ever had in my mouth. Now, of course, I'm allergic to cheese and eggs, so I'll never be able to experience the magic of their omelettes ever again, but I recommend you head on down and grab you one. I also recommend you skip the brunch business and go for dinner (omlettes aside). Because when it gets busy, the food quality goes down. I may be a little hard on Lula in this review, but I've eaten there like a thousand times now, and I know what they're capable of, so when they slack and send out some crap (which is still better than most places in town), I get a little disappointed.",0.9482,0.812,0.129,0.058,0.5537037037037037

I usually order from the specials menu and have never been disappointed. We mostly cook dinner at home so my measure is if the meal is better than what I can do - Lula's goes way beyond my criteria, inspiring and educating my inner chef.

2006-04-10,5.0,"I'm just adding another flame to the fire that burns for Lula. It would be a driving force, if I were thinking of moving to Logan Square at some point down the line. For right now, it's a short field trip for me, so I've gone there twice for brunch and once for dinner. Again, as many have mentioned, it can be pricey, but it is worth every penny.  This restaurant prepares its' food with expert craftmanship. Each plate comes to the table looking photo ready. Last time I had a peach bellini with an omelette that I literally savored each bite of that was filled with spinach and feta and an ingredient that was pivotal to the dish but has somehow slipped my mind; it was a special. The specials are well thought out and once again, reasonably priced for what they are. Even my vegan friends find deliciousness here. Now I'm thinking that this coming Saturday might be a good day for Lula. The wait is long and I'll bet it will be expectionally long now that spring has sort of sprung in Chicago.

2005-08-01,5.0,"Lula Cafe...offhand, I'd say its one of the best restaurants in Chicago. What is appealing about Lula is that they have a concept that guides everything they do. The food is all organic, locally purchased and exceptionally well prepared. I'm drooling thinking about it right now, because Lula has cuisine for everyone. From the classic BLT to the spaghetti, to the esoteric weekly specials, Lula offers a variety of cuisines to please the palate.  I remember the basic menu fondly; it's nice having food that you can rely on, a la franchise; you know what to expect from a quality and a standards standpoint. However, the creativity seen in the specials truly separates Lula. Eggs Hollandaise with Halibut, cous cous 'porridge' with essence of vanilla and dried cherries...I remember having a meal that was a combination of Mexican flavor and American style: Cornflour pancakes, with a black bean and cream compote. Not quite breakfast or lunch, but an experience all in itself. And even with the more 'experimental' dishes, the flavors and textures are all apparent, balanced or imbalanced in proportion, like the chefs had a plan when they were making it.  Lula's atmosphere is excellent; the ambient indie rock played reflects the dress of the servers who, despite their looks, are as experienced, helpful, and knowledgeable as any that I have found in Chicago. If you don't know what something is, ask. The staff will not descend upon you with truncheons of scorn. They'll tell you what the hell escarole is, what it tastes like, and even where the thing's from. And all this for a very reasonable price. What is most appealing about Lula is that it brings high cuisine into the price range of anyone. With a two person sour-appetizer-entree check averaging between $30 and $50 pre-drinks, a night out is highly afforable; but the potential to go and get coffee and a sandwich for $7 or pan-seared chilean sea bass and a nice pinot for $70 makes Lula the right choice for any occasion.",0.9692,0.867,0.105,0.028,0.489515306122449
