2017-06-29,1.0,Ordered a pizza from Rosati's on postmates and after an hour and a half mix up with the driver and the restaurant we did not receive our order. We decided to try again and order straight from the restaurant's delivery service and were told it would be an hour wait. We didn't mind waiting since it was a deep dish. Two hours later we called and they said it would be just a few minutes because the driver was out to deliver. We gave him our number and told to call because it is difficult to get to our building. No call. No pizza. Had to wait 25 more minutes because we called back and they said the tried to call (wrong number) and would have the driver turn around. Got cold pizza. No refund. Terrible customer service. It was late at night and the people on the phone were rude and did not want to deal with us. Will not be ordering again.,-0.9047,0.885,0.019,0.096,0.5128205128205128

I'm thinking it's meant more for a delivery place then a sit down restaurant but you can always find seating here... I've never had a problem. I come in on Sundays when the area is nice and quiet and the parking lot is empty (too lazy to walk). Girl behind the counter is always stimulating to talk to. If I don't watch the clock I waste our time chatting away. I have only been in on Sundays and it has always been the same girl there, so I couldn't judge their customer service more then to say that she has always been a delight... maybe these other reviews are about night time shifters who are overwhelmed during rush time?  Their food. Their food is delicious. I never went in with insanely high standards... but the pizza here is amazing. I am pleasantly surprised every time.

I asked what time they closed and one girl answered ""2am"". So, why are you rushing me? Not to mention I was the only customer in there. As I was ordering, they kept asking ""is that it, is that it?"". They were EXTREMELY RUDE when I said I'd like a little more time to look at the menu. They made me feel like I was inconvenient, and I was stupid for not knowing what I wanted. What kind of business hires employees who makes customers feel inconvenient? It wasn't like I came in around closing time. This was 5 hours til closing. As far as the pizza goes, it was pretty dry for a sausage pizza.

(Couldn't remember what I exactly ordered)  She didn't know if I was lying or not but she took my word which is refreshing.   When the delivery guy came he asked for $25 and change for the order.  I told him that I already paid online.  He said OK and I told him that I would call the store to make sure he wasn't in trouble for not getting money from me.  Called and I hope they take care of it.

I stopped in today for a quick slice since recently I've been working my booty off at the gym and felt the carbs were, well.. quite alright.  So about my slice of thin crust sausage; it was a slice that was easy to love.  Nice chewy dough which wasn't too thick to eat and big enough to balance into my pie hole using one hand.  The sauce was zesty and ample while the sausage pieces were chunky.  The toppings ratio was a-okay.  One slice with a drink was $3.80 plus tax.  A slice with a drink can be filling for those eating on the go.  One detail about their crust; when it is flipped over you'll see that the crust is knotted.  Which is interesting and maybe a signature of the dough maker.  But, a bit too thick for me.  A couple bites into the crust, I felt a dipping sauce was needed.",0.988,0.854,0.137,0.009,0.4985507246376811

So we ordered salad and pizza.  The salad was gross.  The lettuce was not so fresh, cheap and had very few ingredients beyond lettuce. The pizza was pretty good.  Not exactly how I remembered it as a kid but good sauce, quarter-inch crust, and good cheese.  They cooked it perfectly which always helps!

Plus they seem to have a very rough time cutting pizzas for some reason. My last pizza was a thin crust, and was not cut in squares nor triangles. No my friends, I received diamonds. Quite possibly the strangest thing I've ever seen a pizza cut as. Some pizzas were literally smaller than a cracker, while one piece made up a quarter of the 18"" pizza.

2009-03-20,4.0,"Pizza is my crack, and Rosati's is my latest pusher. I've lived near this Rosati's for years, yet never ordered from them. Perhaps due to my fear of strip malls. Lately I've been trying some new pizza joints, 'cause you can't order from CW Napkin all the time (despite their carrot cake), and Brandon H's review caught my eye. I did not get the double dough he suggested, but I did get the pan pizza. Come to papa. This is not the finest pizza in Chicago, but it's some damn fine pie. Most pizza places, something stands out -- the crust, the sauce, the toppings. None of those were exceptional, but all of them were above average, with the result that this was a really nicely balanced pizza. What did stand out, oddly enough, was the cheese. I don't know if their cheese is special, or if it just wasn't overpowered by the sauce, but that was some damn good cheese mix on that pie. And it held up beautifully to next day eating, both cold and reheated. Rosati's menu trumpets ""Under New Management."" I don't know when this change happened, but the new managers are putting out a fine product. Note: Monday nights, all pizzas are 15% off. How do you lose?",0.8552,0.853,0.092,0.055,0.5155032467532468

I never ordered from them so, I can't tell you how their delivery services are!  One thing I do recommend that they should consider doing is always have a pan of Sausage, Pepperoni and all chesse ready at all times. It always sucks to have to wait for pizza when it isn't done. But believe me... It is always worth the wait!  One last thing, if you do get a slice to go and you order two slices make sure not to place both pizza (in the pizza box) on top of each other. It is a GREAT chance the cardboard from the box can melt onto the pizza! My husband had that happen to him and he was very dissapointed because he ate more cardboard than cheese LOL!!

The very difficult to read menu didn't have any veggie subs (the only vegetarian option was pizza), so C asked if he could just get an Italian sub without any meat. He was informed that they didn't have any meat to put on the sub anyway. Not that we care if they don't have any meat, but that struck us as very odd. So the woman disappeared to the back for a few minutes. About five minutes later, she asked my boyfriend what kind of vegetables he would like on the sub, clearly indicating she hadn't even started it yet. Eventually, she returned with his veggie sub, about 15 minutes after we had initially walked in.  Overall, my boyfriend thought sub was pretty good, but the service and options leave a lot to be desired.
