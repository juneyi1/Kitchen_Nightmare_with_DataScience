2017-08-27,1.0,"As a vegetarian, I have been to many steakhouses, many times, of course, it is because some vendors choose the restaurants (and vegetarians are very much a minority ""without a voice""). However, with that said, many steakhouses in big cities are very accommodating and often have vegetarian dishes on the menu.  In this vender sponsored dinner, there is no vegetarian selection on the menu but it does say that "" vegetarian accommodation can be arranged"". So, when the waitress came to take the order, I said and pointed to the vegetarian accommodation. She said, "" it will be probably pasta. Is that ok?"" She was very courteous and appeared to know that pasta is what most steakhouse would do as an option for vegetarians. However, I waited for a while and when the dish came out, I was surprised to see it was a dish of mashed potato with red tomato sauce/paste on it. It is truly a tasteless dish without much nutritional values. It is one of the worst dish a steakhouse like Gibson's can offer to any customer.  I think the chef or kitchen helps at Gibson's Steakhouse is quite a  bit below expectation of being in a steakhouse in a big city where vegetarianism would have and should have entered their mind plus, it is not that difficult to prepare a pasta dish either!",0.89,0.866,0.09,0.044,0.5162500000000001

I ended up eating it like an open face sandwich trying to avoid the delicious bread as much as I could because I didn't want to go back to work feeling too stuffed. My qualm is that the plate came with the most boring side mashed potatoes and gravy I'd have never expected from a place like Gibson's. the gravy was so brown and tasted like it came from powder instant package.

I'll go talk to the outside hostess.""  He then walked away.   Thank goodness Gibson's has one professional employee, a women named Kathy (short blond hair) saw what happened and arranged a table for us next door at their sister restaurant Hugo's.   I waited tables in high school and throughout college, and I understand the wait can be long when the weather does not cooperate. We did not have a reservation and knew we might have to wait.  My problem is with the attitude of the hostesses and (surprisingly) the male manager. Being from Hawaii, a state with a hospitality driven economy, I know that a good manager's job is to diffuse a situation and make it right with the customer.  Not to snipe at them.  Highly unprofessional.  If Kathy isn't a manager, she should be and the manager we had to deal with should come to Hawaii for a lesson in Aloha.

Excuse me??? Trust me, I'm cool enough... My dinner company's steak came out burned to a crisp, not once, not twice, but 3 times.

Lance was a complete arrogant jerk, made unnecessary underhanded comments, and argued with my dinner company.

The side dishes were also wanting, and the spinach was flat out dissappointing. I could have made a better spinach than this, and it was not really cooked at all. I though they would cook down the spinach at least a little bit. The wine was also not particularly good. I have to say this place is pretty overrated.

You can read all the other reviews for the various food options (briefly, get the double baked potato, the WG cut, and wilted spinach, and save room for the chocolate mousse cake!)

This guy was an absolute riot!!  He playfully poked fun at my friend (who easily gets riled up, but all in good fun). At one point, when my wife had to send a steak back for being over cooked (medium instead of medium rare), he said to my friend, ""I expected a complaint from this table, but I thought it would come from you!"" :) Jokes were flying left and right, and at one point he left one dessert menu (party if 5), and without warning, took the menu away before we ordered. Without warning, he brought a HUGE ASS slice of chocolate mousse cake, exactly what we were planning on ordering! Plus, he continually cracked jokes / ?flirted with my friend, at one point giving us a gift bottle of Gibson's house seasoning (and giving her two!) LOL!!  I'm glad I booked this place for dinner.

2017-05-06,4.0,"I've tried nearly all the independent steakhouses in River North so that you don't have to. This is the one you're looking for. Gibsons is a very old school steakhouse. The classic starters and sides are here, without any pretensions. And Gibson's is all about the meat. Their meat isn't just prime, it is their own designation of Gibsons USDA Prime, the only restaurant in the US to have one. So of course the meat is very flavorful and tender. As you would expect, the sirloins and the sirloin sides of the T-bone and Porterhouse have all the flavor, while the filet sides are very tender but comparatively bland. My steak was beautifully seasoned and seared, but cooked a bit beyond the requested medium rare. Of course, my server would have been delighted to replace it, but I can't stand to waste a perfectly good $52 steak. By the way, I had the T-bone, which is essentially a baby porterhouse. But what about the other dishes? My favorite item was actually the crab and avocado appetizer. The very generous serving of delicious crab was lightly dressed and served with creamy avocado slices. Really nice. I was going to order a half salad, but my waiter suggested I go with the complementary house salad that comes with all the steaks, and it was a great suggestion. Crisp lettuce and tomatoes were topped with an excellent creamy blue cheese dressing. I did have a half order of creamed spinach with my steak. I liked the fact that it emphasized the spinach, with just enough cream to give it a smooth consistency, but allowing the focus to be on the flavor of the spinach. Service was both friendly and professional, a delicate balance. Pricing is fairly reasonable considering the inclusion of a salad, and wine prices aren't unreasonable either. The place is very, very popular and therefore packed at all hours, so be sure to make reservations. Ask to sit in the ""porch"", a side room with windows looking out on the park; it's much quieter than the main dining room or deafening bar.",0.9971,0.817,0.176,0.007,0.5264672364672364

Service is great and amazing, some servers are friendly and some are not so friendly but they all have one thing in common, professional and well mannered, I came to this place many times and every time I get same level professional service. Atmosphere, it's cozy and busy kind of loud, reason being is it's a busy restaurant, but I still like it Staff, by staff I mean the rest of the staff beside the servers, they are usually overwhelmed, not very verb very nice, not very friendly sometimes, however this doesn't affect my 5 stars reason being it's because they are overwhelmed which I can understand, the managers are usually super nice very friendly and amazing, the schedulers are the ones overwhelmed usually, but they help when they can,  with all the other positive things this place has to offer it's ""ameliorated""  The only thing I would wanna change is the idea of having a person in the restroom, I mean why on gods green earth you need a guy in the bathroom, I don't usually carry any cash and I feel embarrass that I don't have anything to tip when I wash my hands, so usually I make a point to try to avoid the washroom there, I thought it was something I alone share, however when I say this to my friends they all have similar response, I see the point to make the restroom always clean, but my input is, they can have him outside and clean afterward of each use instead of having a person inside all the time, again with all the positive things this place has it won't affect my 5 stars rating, To sum up, Great great steaks, great appetizers, great deserts.",0.9985,0.722,0.255,0.023,0.5684472045048968

There is a totally separate and full lunch menu with some sandwiches that are much cheaper than the steaks at dinnertime.  They server brought out an assortment of three fresh baked breads with Gibson's own whipped butter.  Everything tasted house-made and was delicious! We selected a crab and avocado appetizer.  It was good, but the crab meat part of it appeared a little more runny than the last time I remember having it.  Nothing earthshattering and maybe a tad expensive. Now to the entrees.  My mother chose a turkey club with fries.  It came out and was huge with thick cut bacon on the sandwich. The fries portion was also overboard.  They were hand-cut and fried well. My brother and I chose to split a French dip sandwich and fries entrée as well as a large lobster cobb salad.  The French dip sandwich was prime rib and came with au jus and homemade gardinara.  We asked for horseradish dip and they brought that out afterwards. The lobster cobb salad had some choice succulent chilled chunks of lobster that were fabulous!  The drawback was the dressing was put on too sparingly and I could have used some bacon and blue cheese crumbles on the salad. They did not have a problem splitting the two entrees on two plates each and did not charge extra.  T Overall, a pretty awesome lunch worthy of about 4.5 stars.  I've been here for dinner and have had some 5 star meals.  The misses were watery crab appetizer and sparse dressing on the salad.  (Also, no bacon or blue cheese).  The pluses were fresh bread, awesome prime rib, beautiful lobster chunks, and hand-cut fries executed well.  Definitely a place worth checking out!",0.9962,0.797,0.182,0.021,0.5392925170068027

Outfits aside, after living in Chicago for almost 7 years, we finally decided it was time to try this Chicago staple.  We visited Gibsons for lunch. Now given the number of fabulous steak restaurants that have popped up in the area, Gibsons was surprisingly average. We started off with Bloody Mary's. The mix that was used wasn't anything special. Next, we shared a wedge salad. The dressing was nice and creamy and the bacon was delicious.  The entrees were difficult to choose because everything sounded so delicious! We finally settled on the Sandwich King burger and the filet mignon. I ordered my burger medium and my husband ordered his steak medium rare. Neither was cooked to what we wanted. My burger patty was not only overcooked but it was also not in 1 piece. It was like someone cut it while cooking it. Had it been cooked correctly, the burger did hold promise. The steak was undercooked and rare, which I am more ok with vs overcooked. Unfortunately, the meat and accompanying mashed potatoes were underseasoned.

2017-04-05,1.0,Hands down the worse steakhouse in Chicago. I honestly have no idea how this place is always packed. First of all if you are a true steak connoisseur you know the best steaks are aged. This place only has 1 dry aged steak. Which i ordered and was charred to death and over cooked. The sad part was the waitress had no clue when i first asked if the steaks they offer are aged. She simple said they are USDA choice. Sadly i chuckled and knew at this point this place was a sham for people that really don't know good steaks. They did serve a mean baked potato and have great desserts. Great atmosphere though.,0.3464,0.702,0.151,0.148,0.5642951625094481

2017-03-27,3.0,"What started as one of my all-time anticipated meal/restaurant experiences, turned in to a night of sheer disappoint and ultimate sloppiness.Gibson's has long been a staple of the Chicago community, & being a transplant of the city for almost 2 years now, I had long fantasized the day when I would finally get to try it.  Upon seating, I immediately excused myself to sneakily order two of their famous giant desserts in advance to be brought out right after dinner. Thankfully, it was handled flawlessly, but the execution however was not (I will get to that at the end.) The meal started with the delicious fresh raisin bread on the table. TIP: allow the butter they give you to thaw. They present it completely frozen and it is a pain to spread, leaving you feeling embarrassed and chomping on chunks of butter.   Our entrees: For a table of 4, we ordered 3 large steaks to share, a side of mushrooms and a side of brussels sprouts. With each meal comes a choice of a soup or a salad. 3 of us ordered the gumbo, while one individual ordered a salad. Within a few minutes, 4 gumbos come out. When we reminded the waiter of the salad, he carried on and eventually brought out the correct order. The 4th soup however sat in the middle of the table, sad and catching a cold. (RIP to the delicious, wasted and uneaten gumbo) The gumbo was delicious! It had a light and smoky flavoring with chunks of sausage and vegetables. I wish there was a few more seafood pieces in the soup, but either way I was very satisfied. After the soups/ salad, our steaks came out. The restaurant nicely sliced the steaks to make it easier for all of us to share (which I greatly appreciated) however, the sides were mess up #2 & #3. We were presented with mashed potatoes, fries and brussels sprouts. When the server (who was not our waiter) was alerted, he apologized and the mushrooms were quickly brought out and corrected. A few minutes later, another round of fries tried to join our party, but we reminded the staff that we did not invite them to attend our festivities. The brussels sprouts were absolutely delicious and should be a must order for all parties going forward. They were grilled to perfection and the bacon glaze left my tongue crying from pure joy. I even considered throwing a few elbows to steal everyone else's portions. Nevertheless, I was a lady and kept to my portioned amount, and let others enjoy them as well. The mushrooms however tasted as if they were marinated in butter and completely drowned out any piece of mushroom taste they may have tried to survive. If my eyes were closed, I could have guessed anything but mushrooms were in my mouth. While not my personal favorite, the other table members felt they weren't the worst but definitely not worth ever ordering again. As for the meat, it also had mixed reviews overall. I personally felt the meat was extremely salty and wasn't able to enjoy it past 2 slices. The others felt the saltiness was a bit more bearable, but ultimately not as enjoyable as we would have imagined.   While we were enjoying our entrees, we attempted 3 times to order cocktails. After eventually waving down our waiter (imagine one of those auto dealer waving blow up dolls), we were able to place our drink order. As we finished our meal, the waiter began to ask about dessert. In sheer panic that they would order another dessert and forget the 2 I had purchased earlier, I excused myself and ran to alert the hostess. She quickly notified the staff and corrected the birthday desserts. While I appreciated the hostess correcting the issue, the dessert in my opinion should have come out on its own. The family I was with, was in the process of ordering a desert, and for anyone who has dined at Gibson's, one desert is enough to feed the entire Blackhawks team. So 3 total potential desserts for a party of 4 would have been completely unnecessary and wasteful. For desserts, we had the carrot cake and the banana cream pie. The banana cream pie looks like a lunch lady slapped a blob of mush on a plate, but in reality, this blob of mush tastes like the ultimate sweet and creamy banana goodness. The carrot cake is 37 stories of goodness as well. The cake is soft & perfectly paired with the rich cream cheese frosting. We had boxes of leftover dessert that I couldn't wait to dig in to later on that night.  The bill: Once our our dessert plates had been licked clean, & the last sips of wine had been sipped, the bill was presented. To no one's shock, error #5 came when the bill include 2 sides we never ordered. Rather that alerting the staff, we decided we would rather pay the extra $12 & get out.  While we left overall content, it was a huge disappointment that such a prime restaurant to the Chicago area had both so many mistakes & unsatisfactory food quality, especially when we were coming in to celebrate a big birthday.  I am a regular at Hugo's & could not rave about them more, so this review for Gibson's  comes with a heavy heart",0.9981,0.773,0.155,0.071,0.5169084927418263

2017-03-14,3.0,"Gibson's has been an institution as far back as I remember. I honestly haven't dined there very often, but the quality of the meal and experience is simply preeminent. Showing up a few minutes early, my date and I were seated immediately. I regret not spending a little time at what I remember to be a well appointed bar, but I had just come from a wonderful Happy Hour at Hugo's, next door, and could not complain about prompt seating. The hostess also offered to take our coats... and though we declined, it's a very nice touch. The service was stellar, as expected. Our waiter ran down the available list of soups and recommended Merlots and Malbecs as those are our favorite steak pairings. I was a little bummed that the beef barley soup was not available as it was on their website... but it looks as though they try and keep the online menu current by the day, so I can't fault them too much about it. The split pea soup that they were offering did not peak my interest, so we skipped straight to the entree. Porterhouse. A photograph of this formidable cut of meat from a fellow Yelper helped seal the deal on an easy decision. I'm not a huge fan of a la carte service. Of course, you expect it in most every high-end steakhouse, but the price is driven up shamelessly. I had my eye on the NY Strip, which Gibson's righteously offers as table d'hote. Be that as it may, the porterhouse photo had my mouth watering, and the decision was made.  I tore through the top loin side of my carnivorous cut with veracity and satisfaction. It's entirely possible this was accomplished with little regard for my own dignity.  The filet cut of a porterhouse is a delicacy, to be sure... however, the more substantial feel of the top loin is a gratifying part of my best steakhouse experiences. This time was no exception. As I write this review, the orphaned filet waits eagerly in my fridge, prepared for consumption as a sumptuous dinner or bold tasting breakfast. I mentioned earlier, my dispositive attitude toward a la carte service. Not only, however, does Gibson's offer certain cuts of meat as table d'hote, they do not skimp on portion size or quality when it comes to their sides. I can absolutely recommend the blue cheese scalloped potatoes. A terrific flavor on their own, but also paired perfectly with the steak. I recommend frying those up in some eggs if you're lucky enough to depart this venue bearing left-overs. The asparagus were huge and tasted good... but I'm a fan of the vegetable being on the smaller side and cooked to a slight char, or caramelization. I find they tend to be more flavorful that way. So Gibson's has not stopped living up to it's own stellar reputation. Despite other well referenced steakhouses failing to meet my dining expectations, I was not at all surprised that this Gold Coast institution has so excellently maintained it's pedigree. Visit them with an empty stomach, an open wallet and a carnivorous craving.",0.9973,0.743,0.186,0.07,0.5841611932129175

2017-02-11,1.0,"Me and my fiancé came in for our Valentine's Day celebration and after waiting 20 minutes for our seat we were ushered upstairs. We had asked for a seat slightly out of way of an aisle as my fiancé is in a walking boot and it's hard for him to get around and didn't want anyone to bump it walking through. The hostess started to sprint upstairs and we were stuck following as my fiancé had to limp up the two flights of stairs. After we were seated things got better. Our waiter was very nice and personable. However service was slow, but being the weekend prior to Valentine's Day we weren't shocked or upset. We ordered drinks and our wine bottle took about 20 minutes to come out. We ordered salads and continued the wait. I decided to visit the bathroom at this time and the ladies bathroom attendant then told me how my face was swollen and my jaw looked as if I had an abscess. And when I said I did not have anything wrong and was fine she proceeded to tell me I'm wrong and grabbed me to move me to the mirror to tell me again how my right cheek is larger than the left and how 'puffy' I am. I told her it's just my face and walked out finally. I was very upset and my fiancé was livid. We decided to just go and told our waiter we were leaving. He asked what happened and my fiancé told him. He was appalled and told us to tell the manager. The manager came over and he asked me to tell him what happened. Then said he would handle it and to try and enjoy our night. So we continued to sit and drank our wine. Then manager then came back and brought the attendant with him. She then proceeded to say how swollen I am again. At the table - in front of my fiancé and the manager and the whole dining room. The manager walked away with her and as I was in tears we decided to just leave. While I got up the waiter noticed and ran over and asked what happened. We told him she said it again at the table and he recommended telling another manager who then told us she's one of their best employees. I've been to Gibsons multiple times a few years ago and it was much better back then. This was horrible service from all but our waiter. Both managers were rude and unwilling to actually help the situation. They offered to cover our wine we ordered (as that's all we got served in the hour we sat there).

2017-02-05,3.0,"Gibbons is your typical steak house in the heart of Chicago's tourist restaurant strip. The interior is a nice enough space and not as cheesy as some of the old school places; the main dining room is kind of Art Deco. Crowd a mixture of tourists, old people and some families (early in a Friday night). Cocktail list was very unimaginative and looked prepared by a 50 year old guy. The wine list OK with some good stuff to be found. Beer range pretty poor and on par with Ruby Tuesday. For the food I had the Chicago Cut that was good, though not great and a little rare than ordered. My wife had the filet that she liked. We were not offered any sauces. Side of Brussel sprouts were good as was the bread. The desert list was like the cocktail list, old and uninteresting. By the looks of the serves focusing on quantity over quality, so we passed.

I am lucky enough to have been here several times, including during a trip to Chicago this past weekend. You can't beat the service, steak and side dishes here. This last trip I made reservations for a Friday night and we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated upon arriving. We were greeted by our waiter promptly and ordered some drinks. They bring a large bread dish out to start and we ordered calamari (not on the menu, but you can ask for it). I then split the 10oz steak with my mom since this was the smallest one on the menu and it seemed like too much for us on our own. They offered to cut it for us in the kitchen, which was great. We got it peppercrusted, which had a little too much kick for me, but was still very good. The sides are huge and enough to split so we split 3 for 4 people. We ordered the asparagus, brussel sprouts and blue cheese potatoes. I am a new brussel sprout fan, but the maple and bacon combo sounded too good to pass up and I was right! The asparagus was also great with the hollandaise sauce and this disappeared fast at our table. Now, I am not a blue cheese fan at all, but I tried the potatoes and loved them!! There was no blue cheese taste to them. We then got a sorbet and vanilla ice cream to split for dessert. It's safe to say we left the restaurant stuffed!!

Prime Angus Beef Carpaccio: Had a little searing on the edges, so wasn't completely raw.  Sliced super thinly and paired perfectly with greens and light sauce. Crabmeat Avocado: Reminded me of a ceviche since there were some veggies mixed in and the sauce had a nice tang.  Also, tons of crabmeat! Bookbinders Soup: Reminded me of a thick gumbo, but with just fish. Perfectly sized to whet your appetite, but not spoil it. Bone-In Filet Mignon: I like making steak at home and am actually getting pretty good at it, but I can't compete with this place! The real key is the super hot searing of the exterior to produce a brilliant gradient of well-doneness to rareness as you cut a cross section. The meat quality was also top notch, for melt in your mouth steak. The béarnaise sauce was a perfect pairing to add extra fatty richness to otherwise lean cut. Blue Cheese Scallop Potatoes: The real shame here is that I could make an entire meal out of this side, but had to ration my portion so I didn't waste any valuable stomach real estate reserved for steak. Super thin and tender tater slices, creamy sauce, crispy topping and just the right amount of blue cheese zing. Big Banana Banana Cake: HUGE! Loved all the fluffy decadent frosting.

Finally a waiter from another section gave me a menu and promised to find my waiter. It was 30 minutes before I even ordered. The cocktail (Manhattan) was excellent.  The bread was not so great. It was dried out and nothing special. My salad was a typical iceberg concoction circa 1975. I had the bacon brussel sprouts, which were good. The steak was the Chicago ribeye medium rare. It was nicely done and well seasoned, but for a prime steak, it had a lot of big globs of fat instead of being evenly marbled. Truth be told, I've had better. In fact, give me a prime cut and my cast iron skillet and my own seasoning and I can make one as good or better in my own kitchen. Hell, maybe I should open a steakhouse if this is the supposed apex. Desserts were monstrosities much too large for one person, so I skipped it. Is this place good? Yes. Is it the best? Not even close.

2016-12-15,3.0,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about my experience here. I will be turning 40 this week and I wanted to do something really special. I had never tasted a very high end steak before, so I thought I would try it. The waiter comes out with steaks on a tray and explains each one to you to help you decide. My waiter was nice but he spoke really, really fast. It was too hard to follow what he was saying so I just went with the ""Chicago Cut"" Ribeye and a double baked potato. The bread basket was pretty good. The side salad was ok but no tomatoes, croutons, or anything ""fun"" on it. The double baked potato was enough for four hungry people. It was okay but not nearly as good as the description made it sound. The waiter actually took it off my bill when he saw I only ate part of it.  That was unnecessary but nice of him.  The steak was somewhere between ""okay"" and ""good,"" but I have actually had better mail order steaks on a friend's outdoor grill. I asked for mine Medium Well, but it actually looked more Medium (or even possibly Medium Rare) to me. I casually mentioned this to a waitress who had struck up a conversation with me about my meal, and she started to kind of argue with me. She retorted something like, ""That's why the waiter describes it before your order is taken."" Well yes, the waiter DID describe a Medium Well steak to me, as far as I could tell. He was speaking so fast that again, it was hard to follow. But the description sounded basically like Medium Well from what I could catch. Doesn't mean that's what I got. Then again, I am from Fort Wayne and they overcook everything here, so maybe my perception is skewed. Probably is. One funny quirk I have noticed about this place is that the servers keep asking you how you are, but it's like as soon as you start to answer, they look away and move as far away from you as quickly as they can. I would rather be asked less frequently but be asked in a genuine way. The server brought out an enormous complimentary slice of pumpkin pie. Not sure why,  but it was a nice gesture. Too bad I hate pumpkin pie. It would have been a lovely dessert for someone.  From the $15 valet parking, to the tip for the totally unnecessary bathroom attendant, you need to be ready to lay down some real cash at this place. On that end, I was prepared.

Based off of the reactions of several locals regarding my selection, I was confident that I had picked a winner. As a west coast girl, I had to get use to the whole ""coat check"" thing. It's probably a mid-west/east coast thing. As soon as I walked in with my family, we were readily greeted by the hostess who asked to take our coats for us. It was a pleasant surprise to be treated as if I'd just returned home! They have well-trained staff - especially Judith (our server). She was always just a few feet away. I felt like I was dining at a very close friend's home. My biggest pet peeve at restaurants is not getting the check in a timely manner or the server not picking it up promptly, but Judith's timing was impeccable; we never felt rushed. (But it was not like a long dinner in Spain either).  We ordered the following items for lunch:  Sliced strip steak (A) Mashed potatoes (A-) Due to temperature, not a lack of taste  Spinach (B) Needed salt Salmon sandwich (A-) Prime rib sandwich (A-) French fries (B+) Due to temperature, not a lack of taste  Salmon (A+) Although the restaurant was located in the heart of the Gold Coast, it was not pretentious.

2016-11-21,3.0,The restaurant is located across the street from Mariano Park (aka viagra triangle). Great place to sit and people watch. Chicago Cut - 22oz bone-in ribeye. Ordered Medium Rare and got it cooked to perfection. Outside was charred and crispy. The meat was either not seasoned or done so very lightly but better under seasoned than over. A little seasoning salt solved the problem. If you like char on your steaks then this is the place to go. This however didn't quite fit my palate.  Seafood gumbo - this side came with the steak and was very thick and dark. I actually really liked the flavor in this but it was a tad on the salty side for me. Dessert - I really wanted to try their desserts but did not have the stomach for it. The slices are enough to feed at least 6 people. Restrooms are located upstairs by the front check in.,0.8933,0.837,0.114,0.049,0.4951666666666667
2016-11-20,5.0,My husband and I flew into Chicago on our way to South Bend for the weekend. We did some research before arriving because we wanted to have a great lunch on our short visit. Decided on Gibson's after seeing a lot of good reviews. We were so happy with our choice. We can't say enough good things about the food or the service we received from Joe. We both agree that he was the absolute BEST server we have ever had anywhere. Exceptional. He was so knowledgeable about the menu and the history of the restaurant. He sure made these out of towners feel very welcome. Just a very friendly guy. The steaks were out of this world delicious! Everything was wonderful!! Yummmmm!!!!!!!! I'm still thinking about that filet and double baked potato and their blue cheese dressing. We will definitely be back the next time we are in town.

2016-11-08,5.0,"Amazing.  Before heading out to Chicago, I asked a lot of my friends about the must do/see spots. My friends being foodies, all pointed me towards Gibson's. We made reservations, which I highly recommend, as their dining room is consistently packed (but not in an uncomfortable way).  As soon as we sat down, the table next to us had ordered dessert. I read someone else's Yelp review talking about how ""they literally take a cake, cut it in half, stick a knife in it, and serve it to your table"" and they were NOT kidding. We started taking pictures of the ginormous dessert and ended up making friends with their table. After all six of them took cake, they then sent it over to our table. So my friend and I started our dinner having chocolate layer cake and laughing with our new friends. Another new set of awesome people were seated at the table to the other side of us, so naturally we made friends with them and sent the rest of ""our"" giant chocolate cake over to them to share.  We started with house salads and then moved onto meat. They bring you all of their featured meats and lobster, uncooked to the table, for you to preview what you would like. My friend ordered the filet and I went with their recommended special steak of the day. It was a 22 ounce W.R. Chicago Cut and it was cooked to perfection (at medium rare). There was a delicious crust and the meat was PERFECT!! When I'm eating a meal that I love, it's rare I will leave any leftovers, especially when it was as delicious as this, but the serving was HUGE. I tapped out. We shared a half order of sautéed broccoli and spinach, along with the full double baked potato (HIGHLY recommend) sides. This was more than enough food.  For dessert, our newest friends sent half of their cheesecake over to us.

When I'm in my ""diet"" mode for my body building shows, I order either the tuna or swordfish. Both were fantastic.

My husband got a huge strip steak which I also had some of and it was delicious.

I wasn't overwhelmed by anything here food wise, but the wine list is great.  This seems to be a great place for business, although it gets really loud and it's hard to hear people just across the table from you.

At 53 dollars for a 22oz USDA Prime steak (albeit wet aged and not dry aged) it's actually a pretty good deal.   Overall the steak was good, not melt in your mouth but the marbling was decent enough.  It had a really nice char to it which is always welcomed.   I still prefer David Burkes but you won't be disappointed at Gibsons either.",0.9954,0.713,0.274,0.013,0.5300925925925926

The server was very pleasant, even though we felt extremely rushed. We did arrive at 11 pm & the restaurant was packed, still no excuse to rush us. We ordered a tomato cypress salad, jumbo shrimp cocktail, broccoli, mushrooms & mashed potatoes with our steak. When the steaks arrived, my daughters was burnt on the outside & well done & dry in the middle, no warm link at all. Then mine was charbroiled on the outside & RAW on the inside. Yes RAW! We didn't eat u, server came 15 mins AFTER our food arrived & asked if we were done & I showed him our steaks he said I'll take it off the bill. No manager was called over & the server did not even ask if there was anything g he could do for us, brought us the bill & walked away. No apologies, no manager, no other suggestions to make the situation better. We weren't even asked if we wanted dessert. It's a shame that after 20 years of eating at this restaurant that I have eaten my final meal here. I dined at Chicago Cuts Steakhouse the night before & it is now my NEW place to eat while visiting Chicago. We travel from Michigan to Chicago & will never eat here ever again.

2016-09-06,5.0,"I had the pleasure of dining at this Chicago must-go before you die restaurant on Sunday evening. I had been looking forward to this meal for months, so I knew I wasn't going to hold back. Upon arrival greeted by the valet, servers on the patio, hostess, etc. You could feel the warmth from the very beginning. They were fully booked that night, but it never felt overwhelming in there. My boyfriend and I arrived early to grab a cocktail prior to our 8:30pm reservation.  I highly recommend sipping on an Old Fashioned and listening to the pianist in the bar area prior to dining. We were escorted to what I felt was the best seat in the house, but it appeared as if you couldn't have a bad seat with how the restaurant is laid out. Since our reservation was like maybe 2 minutes pass (literally 8:32pm) Scott (1 of three very visual managers) had an appetizer on the way for my main squeeze and I. The Avocado Crab Meat appetizer set the perfect tone for the meal. I had been anticipating a huge steak, so it was nice to have a seafood dish prior. It was a really nice touch with Scott's style of management, fully engaged and elevating the experience as a consumer. Our server, Michael (I believe, so mad I can't say it with 100% certainty) was professional, charming, and set us up for success. For the table the Chicago Cut, Porterhouse, sautéed spinach, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes were ordered...and made sure to hold a strawberry shortcake for dessert. The charred outside of the steak with the perfect medium-rare temp on the inside was to die for. Splitting sides was the way to go. Huge portions. The shortcake could serve 8, but we ate for 6. So flipping good. What a seasonal treat. Other than my mama's Thanksgiving dinner, the best meal I've ever had. I can honestly say I'll think about the Chicago Cut and strawberry shortcake everyday for the rest of my days. There's no question I'll be back.",0.9964,0.743,0.203,0.054,0.4920609318996417

A couple places we thought of going to were Gibson's or the Cheesecake Factory. We settled on Gibson's on Rush St. It was such a nice day, it seemed as if most people were dining outside, so we did the same. I was initially impressed by the professionalism of the host and then our waiter. They both seemed to go the extra mile to make sure we were treated respectfully and promptly seated. Although my seat was somewhat cramped due to a light post behind me, I managed to maneuver well enough to sit and eat. If I was a bigger person, it would not have been a comfortable place to sit. Flowerbeds were located as a barrier between the restaurant patrons and the sidewalk traffic. They looked great, but  they attracted bees to the area while we were eating. For my lunch, I ordered a Reuben sandwich with shoestring fries and a soft drink. The sandwich was layered with corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and dressing on rye bread. It turned out to be too much food for me, so I left many of the fries and part of the sandwich behind.

The Scallops (6) were plumb and juicy and well seasoned with what seemed like thick garlic chips. The buttery sauce they were swimming in was perfect to drag half a scallop through before every bite.  The 24oz Porterhouse was very flavorful. They season it very thoroughly, so if you don't like things on the salty side be sure and let them know. Also, I asked for it medium rare on the rare side and it seemed like it was more on the medium side. Still a very good steak, but just clarify your temperature.

Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable of all the cuts of meat, sizes, and recommended dishes to us based on what we liked. He even advised one of the couples in our party to share a larger cut and get extra sides if needed as it would save us money at the end of the night! Extremely friendly, 5 star service all around.  As for more on the food, I ordered a smaller cut, medium, and it came out perfectly cooked, warm, well-flavored,and still slightly pink on the inside. Couldn't have photoshopped it any better! We ordered the monstrous 2lb (!!) lobster tail as well, and when they say 2lbs they mean 2lbs of lobster meat, not including the shell! I was amazed by how large it was but was even more amazed at how good it tasted! Usually with larger lobster tails the meat will either be not all the way cooked or it will have a rubber-y texture on the outside due to prolonged cook time. Somehow the chefs at Gibson's were able to perfectly and evenly cook all parts of this lobster tail and kept it tasting and textured amazingly!

I didn't even let them finish before my mind was made up. And that decision paid off. I'll start with...this place is pricey. All steak houses are. And while you often hear steak-snobs say ""I can cook a steak at home just the way I like it for a fraction of the price"", I know with full certainty that I can't. So I dropped $200 for two people. Not including the drinks I got before hand. They start you off with bread. As good as it is...and it's really good...try and pace yourself if you plan to get an insane amount of food like I did....or get ready to waddle back to wherever you came from. With my entree I had the choice of a salad or soup. I went with soup - as it was a cream of mushroom. It. was. amazing. I don't usually drink soup - as my homeland hovers around 90 degrees 10 months out of the year - so this was a nice change of pace. Creamy, mushroomy (huh?) and delicious. I went with the Chicago cut which is a Ribeye. I was stuffed half way through, but pushed myself like a runner in a marathon and I am glad to say that I made it across the finish line. I finished the whole thing. It was massive. I'm proud of myself. The steak was perfectly cooked and had a nice crust on the outside of it. Delicious.  We ordered the twice baked potato as a side. This monster of a side is a backed potato...that's been hollowed out....made into masked potato and then neatly stuffed back into the potato skin....with a sheet of cheese on top. This is like my dream bed. I'd love to be that mashed potato, all comfy and tucked into bed. I have no idea what spices/magic they add to the mashed up taters, but they were amazing. We also got a 1/2 order of broccoli. Originally we ordered the full serving, but the waiter looked at us like we were crazy. He then convinced us that a 1/2 portion would be a good idea. Thank goodness he did because the half serving was bigger than ANY veggie serving I've ever seen at a restaurant. Get the 1/2 of whatever else you get - because you WILL get the full potato.  Cocktails were good. I had a mule, and it was refreshing and well done. They had an extensive wine list as well. We skipped dessert, but basically they cut a cake in half and bring that to you. It's like a Flintstones serving size of cake. I wish I had room for it. The service....man the service. If you are paying top dollar you are going to expect impeccable service, and the folks at Gibson's deliver. Super nice, accommodating, explained everything, came through with their fancy scraper to take all the crumbs/spills off the table...it was an overall amazing experience.",0.9986,0.773,0.206,0.021,0.5940476190476192

Anyways, we started with oysters and shrimp cocktail.  Both have a spicy cocktail sauce reminiscent of St Elmo's but lighter on the horseradish.  Both have great flavor and the shrimp are huge!  My steak was the Chicago cut special (the 22 oz bone-in ribeye).  Cooked a perfect medium and had me scarfing down every single morsel of that meat.  I armed it with some asparagus with hollandaise and blue cheese au gratin potatoes; one damn good meal.  Plus paired with Meiomi Pino Noir (ranked in the top 10% globally) along with a classic ol fashion cocktail.  Still saved room for dessert which was peach ice cream and a shot of espresso; I wanted turtle cake but no way could we finish that (they're literally the size of your head).

2016-06-30,1.0,"Overpriced mediocre food. I've eaten at a lot of fine dining establishments over the years, but this one was not worth it at all. My husband and I went there for dinner on a Thursday night. Granted it was 7 pm so the fact that there was a wait wasn't totally unexpected, but the push to wait in the bar to buy expensive drinks was. The restaurant was freezing cold but I guess most of the drunk patrons didn't notice. Then they come around with a tray of uncooked meat, pushing the ""Gibson"" beef was a joke like it's different. We ordered the halibut which was good but I'm sorry but $42 for an 8 ounce piece of fish is ridiculous. The baked potato wasn't baked (maybe microwaved) and was underdone. Two different manager types came around to make sure we had their business cards. Shortly after the second one left, a waiter spilled water down my husbands back. Table so cramped together you couldn't have a private conversation if you wanted to. So, for $120 some odd dollars we were freezing cold, had 2 pieces of fish, an underdone non-baked potato, 1/2 size lukewarm green beans with mushrooms, and two ice teas while practically sitting with 4 drunk business men at the table next to us. Clearly this place preys upon the business traveler with an expense account rather than couples who are looking for a fine dining experience.",0.6261,0.827,0.095,0.078,0.5352182539682541

I think the ambiance can really add to one's dining experience and sadly Gibson's didn't cut it for me. Where is the diversity among the patrons? The customers all looked the same. While I understand Gibsons is a fixture in Gold Coast, I was absolutely shocked by the lack of diversity, including the wait staff. One might ask, is it Gibsons fault for the kind of clientele they attract? Maybe...maybe not, but if you're looking to take your out of town work colleagues to this place, like I did, I actually felt embarassed because the restaurant didn't portray a healthy representation of Chicagoans, but perhaps it did. I devoured the Chilean sea bass. It was delicious. And if you decide to go I think the sea bass is a great alternative to steak, which by the way, they parade around raw steaks on a tray to each table and point out various steak cuts including the Chicago cut. Did I say it is crowded in the place? I mean it was filled to the brim, as they say. Every table was taken, which means everyone, including the wait staff would bump into your chair as they passed. It got pretty annoying after a while so we ate and left.  Noise level was extremely high so we had to shout to talk. As a result other customers were shouting too so you had to overhear conversations that weren't too interesting.

Enjoyed the Caprese  salad and the Gibson's Prime Angus Beef Carpacio. Both were great and good size portions for two. My husband and I were debating between dessert or the angus steak tartare. We decided on the tartare as our server said it was more savory. The Tartare was a disappointment because it was very mustardy in flavor. Not expected with Tartare. I would prefer the Tartare at LuxBar kitty corner to us. Although the best Tartare I have experienced so far is Carnevino in Vegas. Drinks were meh.

Our waiter, Elvis, was phenomenal and attentive throughout the evening. An absolute pleasure, but sadly the best part of dinner. Admittedly they char their steaks and I'm not a fan of that flavor, though they nailed the medium rare 14 oz filet. Added on a lobster tail that was overdone in my opinion. Creamed spinach was decent. Lobster bisque was flavorful enough. Enjoyed the bread basket variety. Heard we needed to get dessert and ordered both a macadamia turtle ice cream pie and the carrot cake. The former was about a foot high and pretty good. The latter was a behemoth cake onto itself, but while the size was hysterically overwhelming it was rather flavorless and bland.

Gibson's has a reputation for being one of the busiest restaurants in the city, which I imagine was only exacerbated by the influx of foodies attending the conference. We waited for our table in the bar, which was packed accordingly. Despite the fact that we could hardly move and were constantly jostled by other patrons moving to and from their destinations no one complained because the atmosphere was lively and the service extremely fast.  The fun really began when we were seated and met our waiter Elvis. Everyone was impressed with his professionalism, sense of humor and ability to juggle not only our large table, but many others just like it with ease. Being that the majority of the people in our group are in the restaurant industry this is no small compliment. The appetizers were phenomenal, especially the crabmeat avocado, which had even people who are not shellfish fans asking for second portions. To the surprise of no one the steaks lived up to their reputation of being cooked to perfection. The filet had a peppercorn crust that was thick, spicy and charred on the outside while still juicy and rare on the inside. Bearnaise was served on the side but the meat was so good that it sadly went uneaten. The double baked potato was an enormous portion of cheesy deliciousness. We topped everything off with three of their ginormous desserts which was enough food in itself to feed a small army.

The scene is classy as are most places on Rush so no faults there. Valet is offered because street parking is going to be near impossible to find. The filet 10z medium well was cooked properly I'll give it that but it does not leave an impression that will stay with you taste buds. It's good not great (that's being generous ). It does come with a side of butter seasoning to give it an extra kick but I'm in the variety that feels a good steak needs no extra additions or seasoning. The mash potatoes (recommended by a reviewer) was ok..nothing special and again will not leave a lasting impression. The side of brown gravy is a must to add some flavor to it and it's a good preparation to bring in some taste(has a bit of alcohol flavor to it which I always welcome ). Even with that though it's not worth ordering and I'd choose something else if there's a next time. Overall, the service and ambiance is upscale and classy .

The booth is a squeeze for four, so hold out for a table. I'm an outta-towner, so I chose a one-off steakhouse as opposed to a chain so I would get, in my mind, a real Chicago experience.  As for the food, the steaks are better than you can imagine.  The W.R. Cut is their Rib-Eye and it was large enough to share.  We loved it.  Cooked to perfection. It came with a choice of sides (hard to pick from, I wanted one of each!) We started with a bowl of gumbo, which was better than I've had in a long time, better even than some in New Orleans.  You could make a meal of the gumbo!  We also had a Shrimp and Avocado Salad that could be a meal for one person not looking for too hardy of a meal.   Good choice for non-carnivores.  Everything in it was fresh and crispy cold. So, there's a general rule... ""never order ribs in a place that's not a rib place!"" Well, this place is the EXCEPTION to the rule.  The ribs are NOT pre-boiled.. they have the actual slow roasted smokey BBQ flavor, firmness on the bone, and moisture to make for them tender and juicy. I could not end without telling you this.  As we ate, we could see the massive desserts passing on their way to other tables.  They were so big that I made up my mind early not to leave bloated due to sweets.  I was outvoted, and we settled on the Banana Cream Pie. I promise you here, you will never have a better, authentic BCP.  Not too sweet, Fresh bananas,  flakey crust, and the filling is unmistakably made right there, in house.  Plus we got half to take home.  YUM!

2016-03-23,3.0,"My recent experience at Gibsons was A-OK, as the 3 stars on this review denotes. The concierge at the hotel recommended Gibson's and another steak house in the area and we chose Gibson's due to the fact we could get a table quicker. Next time I won't make that mistake. Nice mood lighting with very friendly and accommodating waitstaff, amidst an interesting mix of patrons for a Friday night.  Started by ordering a dirty martini but was brought vodka in a martini glass, sans dirty. I asked  about the drink and was met with a response of 'I thought you ordered a martini, not a dirty martini.' She quickly brought the dirty and olives.  I ordered the lobster bisque, which in my opinion was a pretty solid lobster bisque. For my entree I ordered the filet medium rare; I have had steaks with more flavor but this was cooked to the degree that I requested and still pretty good. For sides the Brussels sprouts with bacon and bourbon were ordered along with the roasted cauliflower gruyere. The cauliflower was tasty but unfortunately I did not get a chance to taste the Brussels sprouts. Our waiter again made a mistake and instead brought out the blue cheese scalloped potatoes. Not a bad mix-up as I really enjoyed the blue cheese potatoes. I much preferred the potatoes over the cauliflower, though both were finished by the table.  All in all it was an decent meal; not the best steak dinner I have had in a while but damn, I would get those blue cheese potatoes again if I had the opportunity.",-0.0397,0.772,0.119,0.109,0.5541666666666665

The wall of famous people's pictures were really cool, but otherwise the decor left something to be desired. The waiters were dressed all official. A plate of the meats was brought to us to help us make our selection. To start off with, I got some oysters to be accompanied by a pear martini. Both were very fresh and bright! The dinner salad was unremarkable. For the main course, I got W.R.'s Chicago Cut steak. Big freakin' piece of meat. Pretty good. For sides, I got mushrooms and Bourbon Brussel sprouts with bacon. The mushrooms were bland but firm, and the Brussel sprouts were too hard, bland, but slightly cloyingly sweet. Relatively mediocre. No dessert, we were too full. They looked good. In summary, the pros of my trip: the service, the steak, the oysters, the drinks.

Our bread arrived slightly cold, so I politely asked if this was normal and our waiter was extremely wiling to warm it up for us and it arrived back perfectly. We ordered 10 oz filets and while both came lightly undercooked, within a minute or two, they had cooked to perfection due to the hot plate and were perfect when we began eating. The filets were one of the best filets I have ever had, perfectly tender and enjoyable. The steaks also came with a complimentary salad. The sides were extremely large and shareable between at least three people. We had leftovers between the two of us. The martinis were also fantastic and large.  All in all, I would extremely recommend Gibsons' for the large portions, attentive service and great drinks.

2016-02-26,3.0,"Let me begin by saying this was a take out order. I've been to Gibsons in the past and enjoyed my time. Since then I've dabbled in the other steak houses this city has to offer such as Joes, RPM Steak, Ruth Chris, etc. Gibsons is classic and unique in the way they bring the raw meat to you. However, this to go order was very blah. Nothing about it was outstanding besides dessert.  The bread and butter was okay. They had a slice of raisin bread in there which I took and liked. I then had a cup of lobster bisque which was the best part of the meal. Very good. Order this every time if it's the soup of the day. The wedge was okay. Way too much dressing and not enough tomato, onion, etc. The filet was burnt in some areas so I just to trim them up. Over the phone she said it came in a zip like sauce. No sauce was on it. Which is fine if it had a dry rub of some sort. No flavor. No salt and pepper. But it was cooked perfectly on the inside I will say that. Ordered a side of mushrooms, remember these sides can be shared by a least 3-4. These were good. But once reheated after the drive back they didn't really hold up.  I'm sure a time will come when I eat at Gibsons again but I definitely won't get take out unless it's dessert. Also, they have a giant ice cream cake that lasted my 15-20 min drive home. They packed it on ice and wrapped it well. Bravo! Popped it in the freeze when I got home for later. And omg easily 5-6 people can eat their desserts. And that's all I have to say about that.

2016-02-23,2.0,"I'm really not sure how Gibson's has such a high rating after my recent experience.  Assuming it's because many of the reviewers are from out of town and don't realize how many good steak houses are in a two mile radius of this place.  The service really wasn't on the level of what I'd expect for a place where I'm going to spend upwards of $150 on dinner for two, and lets not get started on the ""interesting"" crowd.  I went for dinner with the hubs earlier this month, we had 7pm reservations and arrived promptly.  When we arrived we were asked to wait for about 10 minutes, which seemed strange since we saw several open tables through the windows.  Sure enough we were seated at one of five open tables for two- the same ones we saw earlier.   Once seated our water glasses were filled promptly, which was a plus until I noticed how filthy the glasses at the tables next to us were (sure enough both tables ended up requesting new glasses AND silver wear for cleanliness issues).  We had the ""meat show"" if you will, but then waited for over 20 minutes (I timed) for our waiter to come back to take our order.  I tried to get his attention after I ordered to make a small change- but rather than coming back to our table, he carried the conversation on across the table next to us- Seriously! Making it worse for that couple- at the end of the night they handed us our check and wrapped leftovers over the table.  I was mortified by the people I ordered a fish dish- which was great (But more of a reflection of Hugo's)but given the hype around this place (and their USDA designation) my husband's filet was underwhelming.  It was incredibly tender and had a nice seer, but was served under cooked and had little flavor.   I'm assuming they wanted the flavor to come from the sauce it was served with- but a good steak shouldn't need a heavy sauce.  I live a block away from this place, but am certain I wont return.  I used to love Hugo's but seeing how dirty the glasses and flatware was, I'm not even certain if i'll go back there!",0.9269,0.884,0.073,0.043,0.4964124635054869

2016-02-20,3.0,"Under intense and somewhat irrational internal pressure to try a traditional Chicago steakhouse, I dragged two of my buddies here for dinner. Together, we ordered 2 WR Chicago cuts,1 filet mignon, side salads with blue cheese, seafood gumbo, twice baked potato, asparagus, and the meaning of life cake. Portions were large, but the food itself was overall okay. The meat quality is very high and the broiled crust is done really well. The sides are just okay, and I can't say the hollandaise was particularly good or that the gumbo was good. The steak is certainly the best thing here. The cake, and desserts in general, is ridiculously large. We maybe consumed 1/5 of it. I would not order again, because the cake is fundamentally not very good and the bananas embedded in it are distracting. Maybe the most notable part of this experience was the service. Very old school and attentive, and also surprisingly sexist. I'm going to go ahead and presume that this is peculiar to the server we had, but I did not appreciate his assumptions around: 1) my drink preferences (he specifically recommended I get a pomegranate martini or lemon drop because that's what women drink, apparently), 2) my doneness (because a woman can't order medium rare), and 3) his blatant assumption that because I was with two men, I did not pay. Conclusion: Gibson's is okay/good. Would probably not come again. I have had better experiences at both David Burke's and Bavette's.",0.9824,0.785,0.157,0.057,0.48277345731191884

Definitely don't think it was worth what I paid. $125 for the small lobster tail & the Chicago cut ribeye alone, no side dishes included, all it came with was a cheap garden salad that seriously looks exactly like bagged salad from a grocery store. The staff really didn't seem all that helpful or interested in how our meal was. You're basically paying to be able to say you ate at gibsons. They have their own certification from the usda, no other restaurants in the country have that, and I don't see why they need it cause although the steak was good, it was nothing special. I've actually had better steak from other places, Bob chinns in wheeling has a filet that puts gibsons to shame. It wasn't a terrible experience, but not as good as I thought it'd be.

2016-01-25,5.0,"#23 When we asked some of the locals, and I mean these are people I have known since high school, what is the best steak in the area, the reply was almost 100% ""Gibson's.""  Well, we asked, now we gotta try it, and try it we did. The setting is super luxurious as you enter the always busy establishment.  We did make reservations a few days ahead of time as we were told, ""You might not even be able to get in while you are here,"" but we had to try, and we were successful.  The tables are large and comfy, low lighting, soft music.  There is even an attendant in the ladies room to assist you with anything you may need or might have forgotten.  Cute. Once you are seated the show begins.  The service professionals bring a massive platter to the table to give you an 'on the fly' steak education.  This platter contains several raw steak, and they walk you through the tenderness, fattiness, area of the cow the steak was butchered from, and tons of accouterment suggestions so that you have the best steak experience possible.  Also, seeing the steaks precooked gives you an idea of exactly what size you are ordering.  My friend always gives me a hard time because he says I eat with my eyes and not with my stomach--yep, he is correct.  An experience like this can easily solve that problem.   What is more interesting is that I, myself, do not eat red meat in any fashion, so this trip was more for my company--I really thought I would be 'taking one for the team' at a steak house; however, I found some delicious salads, fish and more.   We began our adventure with several blue cheese stuffed olive martinis and appetizers.  An easy decision was the oysters and they were absolutely amazing, and I am a HUGE oyster fan and not easily impressed, but tonight I definitely was.  They came with this interesting little sauce along side that I have never had before, and wish I could emulate in my own kitchen at home.  I also shared the shrimp cocktail with the crew.  Really fresh.  Next, I had the lobster bisque which might possibly have been the best bisque I have ever tasted.  SO thick, rich and creamy.   I felt my dress getting tighter as I slurped up spoonful after spoonful--but it was truly worth it.  One of our companions had the gumbo, of which I was impressed by as it was replete with huge chunks of sausage and seafood with a delicious base.   Lauren ordered a filet with mushrooms, accompanied with delicious asparagus.  I sneaked a piece (or two) while she was chopping it up with a friend we met there.  Nick had the prime rib with a loaded twice-baked potato.  Now that looked almost beautiful enough for me to try a bite, but alas, I refuse to partake.  He said it was the moistest (if that is even a word) piece of prime rib he had ever tried.  We chose to complete our meal with espresso and a shared TWO pieces of Gibson's chocolate mousse cake, which was: 1) way too much cake for us to handle, and 2) is almost good enough to die for, yes, almost.    Our experience was above par, to say the least.  Nick said this was his favorite place we stopped at on our whole trip to Chicago--I had to pat myself on the back for asking some old friends where to go--SCORE! The prices are high, but any quality restaurant should be, and we expected this.  I am always willing to pay for excellent service and wonderful food.  The prices are reflective of the service you will receive at Gibson's and totally worth every penny.

The desserts are big enough to feed a small army. Sometimes the waiters pretend that we have never seen raw meat before but since I love meat i sit through the show anyway..

2015-12-20,1.0,"My girlfriend and I had a reservation this past Friday.  I must say we walked away rather disappointed with our first Gibson's experience.  It appeared their company was much more interested with quantity of guests than they were quality of their experience.  I get it, more guests = more money.  When we were taken to our table you could tell right away that where it was placed wasn't where it would normally be.  It was in a very awkward position right up against the table next to us right in the middle of extreme traffic.  So much so that your wait staff was running into one another spilling things on your guests. First, our server spilled hot soup on my hand and wrist.  Didn't feel great.  Five minutes later our server bumped into another server, spilling a full drink on a guest sitting at a table next to ours.  It was a complete war zone.  You could tell the servers were getting frustrated.  I don't blame the servers one bit, though.  They were doing the best they could with the situation management put them in.  Our server did offer up a dessert on the house for spilling hot soup on me.  Guess it was the least he could do.   My girlfriend and I recently ate at one of their competitors (Bavette's) and couldn't help but compare the experiences.  While the steaks were similar, the experiences were not.  When you pay this much for a dinner you just expect a bit more.  If you're in the mood for steak, I would recommend Bavette's over Gibson's any day of the week.  Steaks are just as good and the overall experience is so much better.",0.878,0.884,0.074,0.042,0.43746498599439776
2015-12-16,5.0,"There was something special about my overall experience at Gibson's. A couple friends and I came to enjoy a nice dinner to send off one of us who was moving away, and the three of us were still gushing about the meal hours later.  My reservation was for 8pm, but we didn't get seated till 30 mins later. I honestly expected that I would have to wait, and was not offended or inconvenienced. However, as soon as we were seated, the manager and our waiter approached us to apologize. They also offered a complementary appetizer for us. Such a great example of an established restaurant with amazing reputation and clientele willing to go above and beyond for average joes like us:) Our server, Gregory, was a consummate professional that took care of our every need without being over-bearing.  We had a bottle of Pinot Grigio that paired well with our seafood appetizer and even with our steaks. The appetizer included jumbo shrimp cocktails is worth the eye-popping price. The avocado crab was also a treat, a combination that I have never had, but made so much sense as we took bite after bite. Our beef barley soup wasn't very special, but it was a great balance between the broth, veggies, and beef that you would expect. The assortment of veggies for our sides were crisp and fresh, and included mushrooms, broccoli and string beans. But our WR Chicago Cut Ribeyes were cooked to perfection. Every other review of these steaks are correct so I can't offer anything original. They are bursting with juice, tasty fat, and flavor.  This is the perfect steakhouse.

2015-12-09,5.0,"Gibson's is the quintessential steakhouse of Chicago (and maybe the nation for that matter). Every experience I have had here has been top notch to say the least. It truly is my favorite restaurant in the world (And I'm not exaggerating). Seen in ""The League"" and well known to celebrities both of this day and the past, it is an iconic place. I dined at Gibson's with my family and boyfriend for a Friday dinner recently. Friday's are my favorite at Gibson's because it's lobster bisque day.. I highly recommend going on Friday so you can try the best bisque in Chicago. It's light for the richness of bisque but creamy, with a perfect flavor and notes of Sherry.  We had made a reservation nearly 3 months in advance for a 7:30PM dinner on Black Friday. I would advise making a reservation a bit in advance if you are planning on going to Gibson's. Once you arrive (as you have a reservation), you are seated promptly and welcomed into the luxurious dining room. The staff is very friendly and not stuck up like you get at some steakhouses. We had a booth on Friday, which was comfortable for 6 of us.  We started out with drinks and appetizers-- we decided on some oysters, which were tasty. Then we had our lobster bisque.. YUM! I ordered a filet mignon with char-crust and, as a table, we had a twice baked potato, mushrooms, and asparagus. My steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and only one steak at the table had to be sent back to the kitchen, as it was an odd cut.  We ended our evening with chocolate cake and coffee. Gibson's chocolate mousse cake is to die for-- one slice is size equivalent to half of a small grocery store cake. It is luscious and full of flavor.  I forget the server's name who we had that weekend but he was knowledgeable, friendly, and on top of his game. The ambiance of the restaurant is that of your classic steakhouse-- deep mahogany, burgundy booths, and incandescent lighting that accentuates your experience. It isn't cheap (especially if you order a steak), but it's well worth the money if you want a wonderful meal.",0.9902,0.814,0.146,0.04,0.5548958333333334

Both steaks had more than its share of grissel and not as tasty as expected for a top rated steak house... Got the shrimp cocktail appetizer... Boy the shrimp was a bit rubbery and chewy... Did not expect that either ... Got the asparagus with Hollandaise sauce ... Undercooked in our opinion ...sauce was fine ... Yes I'm a steak snob and I expected way better than was delivered ...

No I didn't complain as both steaks came with a large amount of grissel... So I figured it's their standard quality for the strip steak ... Shrimp cocktail sub par ...

If anything, you can always go next door to Hugo's and sit in the bar area as its first come first serve and you can order off the dinner menu still. The two restaurants share a kitchen so you'll be able to order almost the same things.  The servers are phenomenal here and make the dining experience more enjoyable.

For someone who doesn't enjoy eating too much red meat unless it's well done (I know it's crazy), their marinated skirt steak is delicious!

2015-11-03,5.0,"The highlight meal for me on our trip. I can safely put the Chicago Cut on the top of my list for bone-in ribeyes. Gibsons is a classic steakhouse serving black Angus beef raised from farms in the Midwest. This is it for steak lovers. We arrived five minutes early for our 7 pm reservation and we're seated immediately. If you're expecting a secluded, quiet dinner with that someone special, you'll be disappointed. Tables are in close proximity and you'll probably be engaged in conversation and feel like you're sharing your meal with your neighbors. The restaurant will also be loud especially if it's on a night like we went. On the night of our meal, there was excitement and a buzz in the restaurant as the Cubs made the final out to clinch the NL division series against the rival Cardinals right as we were ordering our meal. We started off with Jameson neat for me, a glass of Moscato for my wife, and a half dozen oysters on the half shell. For entrees, the Chicago Cut, the half order of the spit-roasted chicken, and sautéed spinach with mushrooms as our side. For dessert, the colossal macadamia turtle pie. As for the steak, 22 ounces of succulent, marbled, melt in your mouth black Angus beef. For those of you that are into beef grades, the corn fed and dry aged beef for 40 days has its own USDA Prime Certification that is specific for Gibsons restaurant group only i.e. you're probably not gonna find this kind of beef, that is this good, outside of Gibsons. I savored every bite of my medium rare steak that was seasoned perfectly and needed no other enhancement. Honestly, I could have eaten another 22 ounces. The rest of the food was superb but make sure you have plenty of appetite left if you're going to order the turtle pie, because it is ridiculous huge and not something you can take home with you. Service was impeccable from our team. They were completely professional and knew the menu like the back of their hands. Pricing is as expected, but $54 for the Chicago Cut is more than fair.

2015-11-03,5.0,"So when planning my vacation to Chicago which was solely built around eating and drinking I heard from Thrillest and Eater that Gibsons was considered one of if not the best steakhouse in all of America.  Being from Texas I love a large steak and am immediately skeptical when I hear statements like this.  Upon researching them I find that they are the ONLY steakhouse in America with their own certified prime cuts of meat and they have no dress code.  (I am not a big coat and tie kind of guy).  I proceed to convince my vacationing party that we should splurge and go.  Reluctantly I get everyone on board.  So I make our reservation for a Monday night at 8 pm.  We arrive about 7:45 and I check in with the hostess and then we proceed to the bar where we sit and have a couple of drinks, watch a bit of the football game, and strike up conversation with the gentleman next to us and the bartender.  Quick aside their bartender on this evening was an older gentleman who was sharp as a tack and smooth as silk.  Literally the most professional and on point bartender I have ever seen who was still friendly enough to hold conversation with us.  Anyways at this point I look down and realize it is 8:15 but I am on vacation, they are busy, and I am in no particular rush.  As I walk to the bathroom I hear the hostess tell a guy that there are 3 people ahead of him including our name so I am like cool no biggie.  Go back to the bar and order another drink.  Long story short they call us a little after 8:30. Once seated at our table the manager comes by to offer an apology for the delay to which we explain that we are on vacation and it is no big deal.  The proceed to bring us an appetizer platter and a round of drinks for our trouble.  Nice touch and one of those things that will set the place apart from the crowd. Appetizer consisted of crab stuffed avocado, shrimp cocktail and something else but I do not recall what it was because I was too busy stuffing my face with the avocado.  Let me put it this way the appetizers are as good as a meal.  Also the portion sizes are HUGE!!!  Seriously 1 appetizer can feed 4 people comfortably and same with the side dishes. The men ordered 2 of the Chicago Cut steaks Medium Rare, and the ladies ordered 2 Sirloins Medium Well.  As you can see here 2 of us (the men) ordered their steaks correctly and 2 of us did not.  In fact the 2 offending parties even asked for steak sauce so with that said I will no longer discuss their meal.  The Chicago cut was divine and quite possibly the greatest steak I have ever had.  It was cooked perfectly and tasted so good that I kept eating it long after I did not want any more food because I was hellbent on finishing every last bite (I was successful).   Let me give you a piece of advice when ordering a quality steak:NEVER EVER ORDER IT COOKED ANY FURTHER THAN MEDIUM.  Now if you are grilling a basic grocery store steak then by all means do what you like but don't go to a place like Gibsons that has aged USDA prime steaks and overcook it.  We also ordered Brussels sprouts, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and broccoli.  These were also quite good but quite frankly I ate maybe 4 bites of these.  I came for the steak.  You cannot go wrong with any of these just remember what I said about 1 portion can feed 4.  We ended up giving most of the veggies to a homeless man down the street so they would not go to waste in our hotel.",0.9928,0.825,0.116,0.059,0.5001197963462114
2015-11-01,5.0,"Gibson's is the quintessential American steakhouse of the 1990's, and it has stood the test of time.  I would contend that it is one of the Top 10 steakhouses in the United States.  I have not been to any of their other branches, and why would I after experiencing the electric atmosphere on Rush Street.  If you are looking for a quiet night, or a restaurant that is not filled with celebrities, and sports fanatics then you are in the wrong place.  I love the energy in this place, where everyone makes you feel at home.  The Chicago Cut is my favorite steak here, but you cannot go wrong with any of their prime selections.  I have also had the porterhouse, and filet cuts amongst others.  The sides here are smaller than in most Chicago steakhouses which is wonderful for myself, and any person who wants a side of spinach that will feed less than 27 people!  The baked potatoes are a healthy size, and are cooked to perfection.  I also love the soups here, especially when they serve a gumbo with a little bit of kick.  Canadian bacon is a delight here that rivals Brooklyn's legendary Peter Luger's steakhouse.  The oysters  are some of the best you will find anywhere in the world--BTW if I want a great seafood meal in Chicago the combo of Gibson's and its neighbor Hugo make this little Rush street area in the window of the Drake Hotel & Oak Street beach the place to be.  My brother loves the scallops here, and I think their gargantuan sized Australian lobster tails have to be on the list for my next visit.  I particularly like the home-made sourdough bread at Gibson's that will rival any San Francisco restaurant.  I did not have the appetite for dessert this past week, and I now regret it.  Their cheesecake, and other desserts are of national caliber.   The only negative I could ever find about Gibson's is that during prime dinner hours you can be in for a wait even with a reservation.  However, most locals and regulars have already adjusted that time into their evening plans, and it adds to the restaurant's mystique.  I have always said that a true quality meal is about the food first, and second about being a celebratory event.  Gibson's steakhouse has raised the bar for restaurants to follow.  After returning to Chicago this past week, and attending the Chicago Bulls' home opener, having a great dinner at Gibson's, having a great Asian meal Uptown with some ultra cool Hoya friends, and listening to some Sinatra, Chicago is calling me back.  !",0.9964,0.795,0.165,0.04,0.4966666666666666

The place was packed, mostly an older crowd and some families. The place has a old time feel, its got portraits of so many celebs that have been there. We got our table right away. Our server showed us all the different cuts, which was great.  I got the  WR Chicago cut, which is a ribeye medium rare, with peppercorn. It was perfectly cooked just a little heavy on the peppercorn, and i love peppercorn. Overall the service was great. This isn't a trendy steakhouse, or loungey steakhouse, its simply a classic steakhouse that puts out good food at a great location and great warm atmosphere. Many steakhouse do some of these well, this is one of the few that does it all right. Cant wait to come back.",0.9875,0.787,0.191,0.022,0.548941798941799

This was the worst steak I have ever had..  I would not pay 10% of what I paid for this crappy steak I got.  Dry, under seasoned, luke warm... Ugh.  Ordered asparagus with hollandaise as a side and the asparagus was cooked well, but the hollandaise was very bland.. It tasted like what I would imagine a 'just add water' package of hollandaise would taste like.  Mashed potatoes were bland and not very good.  I was glad that we tried Gibson's using a $100 gift card, so we only had to pay maybe $45 of our own money.  I would never come back here. We were about 15 minutes early for our reservation and the hostess was rude.  We sat in the bar and tried to order drinks, but the bartender was rude also!  We finally got drinks right before we got seated at out table.  It was so loud and cramped... Very disappointing.  The whole time I was eating, I'm looking around thinking, why are there so many people here?  This is crap food..  The only positive things I have to say about this place is that our waiter was very nice and even got me a cup of coffee to go, even though they do not serve coffee to go.  He put it in a to go soup container!  And the woman working in the bathroom was super nice.  I know the name, Gibson's, has a lot of hype surrounding it and everyone where was really fancy and rich, but I thought it was crap and if anyone of those people came and ate steak cooked on the grill at my house, with my asparagus and homemade hollandaise they would laugh in Gibson's face!

He greeted us, took our drink orders, and then started offering his best tips on what to order - He first asked if we had been there before. Even other guests around us where chiming in on his suggestions with rave reviews and their own suggestions! Upon closing the tab to leave for our table, he handed me a martini on the house. A peach, something or other? IT was heaven. HEAVEN. And Im not a martini drinker, by any means. So I walked to my table with my half full glass of wine, and this martini (which the hostess giggled about). It was pretty lush of me, huh? ;) Upon being seated a busboy came to our table, removed the extra place settings, set our table up for two and was on his way. Our waiter made our entire night! We didn't catch his name, but we thought he looked like a Ron, so we called him Ron. He talked fantasy football with my boyfriend, but I didn't care, I ordered another heaven drink, and we all were happy! Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the cuts of steak, and what he was offering us off the menu. He was generous with his personality. He made us laugh the entire meal. WE LOVE YOU RON!

Packed as I remembered and obviously we were not getting a reservation if we hadn't call weeks in advance. We decided to just show up. We were told to check outside since seating in would be over 2 hrs. Plus they pack the tables in and seems hard to move around. Lucky us! The sweet hostess told us 45 min. and the couple behind us 2 hours. She certainly took care of us, big table in the front of all the action. Party busses and great people watching. Plus loved watching the hostess orchestrate who was worthy of dining on her turf. That kept me amused all night.  Oh the food! The gumbo for starters was rich and had good flavor and was filled with sausage and seafood. One of the best filets I had. Both of  our steaks were big and cooked perfectly and melted in our mouths! The desserts are ridiculously big, so better to share with 4 or more. Our pecan pie was not as large but still more than we could eat. Staff super friendly and attentive!

Saturday was far below average - we arrived 5 minutes before our 8pm reservation and were told it would be 10-15 and to have a drink at the bar...I wanted to have a drink at my table so I waited in the cramped hall. At 8:25 they called my name and asked if we would like to be seated outside (with a forecast of rain) - I declined and voiced my frustration. Around 8:30 the Manager came by to ask if we wanted drinks. I again voiced my frustration and asked to be seated. He took care of the first round when we were seated 40 minutes past our reserved time.  Aside from the trouble checking in and getting seated was our server. He must have spent a total of 3 minutes with us throughout the entire meal. I think he made the decision a minute after we sat down that we were not going to spend a lot of money and disregarded us from that moment on...I was planning to order a bottle of wine, but he didn't come with a menu before the food was delivered so I never had the chance (even after I requested the wine list).

Make no doubt about it - this is a high end tourist restaurant where they shuttle you through with sub-par food (on a relative scale).  We were packed in very uncomfortable seating with couples on both side of us that every time someone needed to use he rest room - it would take 2-3 tables being moved for the person to eject from their seat. In short - we never knew who our server was - we had different people checking on us throughout the night which sounds good but they were more fly bys checking on the entire section and not very personal Both of our steaks came out the same temperature even though we ordered them differently - and our lobster tail was dreadfully over cooked. As I mentioned earlier - it's all relative - it's hard to say the food is not good but at $200+ dinner there are dozens of other options where service and the food is outstanding.  Gibsons is a check the box kinda place just to say you've been there.  I recommend hanging out in the bar for a drink and enjoying the people watching but doing dinner elsewhere.,0.9451,0.841,0.109,0.05,0.5460198135198134

My steak was no better than a cut I can grab at my local butcher. Additionally, the mashed potatoes were extraordinarily dry, the gravy was like it was from a can and it was a shock.

The steak was very good.  I knocked off 1 star however b/c we ordered 2 filet mignons, both cooked medium well.  1 came out cooked to perfection, as requested, and the other one came out more medium rare.  My husband doesn't mind rare as much as I do, so we made it work.  Overall though, steak was delicious!  Just a tip for families, it was my husband, me, & our 2 teenage daughters, we ordered 2 of the big filet mignons (14 oz each, I think) & split them between the 4 of us.  It was more than enough food and helped keep the bill reasonable.  And they didn't blink an eye or act all weird when we requested to do this either, which was a plus. We ordered the blue cheese scalloped potatoes as a side dish.  Heaven in a bowl!  I wish I could get those delivered to me like once a week.  So rich & creamy & indulgent- a definite calorie splurge. Since it was my birthday, we sprung for the Meaning of Life cake.  Apparently the meaning of life is a piece of cake that is bigger than my head.  Good gravy that thing was ginormous!  It makes a pretty spectacular showing on the table and be aware that if you order this cake--total strangers may come to your table and ask to take a photo of it.  Even though it looked incredible, honestly, the taste was just ok.  We took it back to the rental and proceeded to chip away on it for the next 3 days but at the end of the trip I still had to throw over half of it away.  I wouldn't ever order it again for that reason, too wasteful.  Overall though, Gibson's is a place you need to visit if you ever get the chance.  Everyone should go there at least once.",0.9791,0.895,0.102,0.004,0.5396052631578945

We started by spending nearly $500 on wine and champagne at their bar. Sadly, even this had a hitch or two but the staff was quick to handle the inconveniences and their genuine concern was much appreciated. Dinner was a disaster. Firstly, we were made to wait 30 minutes for our table on a reservation we made 1 month prior for a Monday night. No concern was shown, no apology was offered. We only received a table after I showed my bar receipt to the hostess. Ordering our meal took a long time, which surprised me given the usual efficient service. Every single person at my table asked for a rare steak. Each and every steak was cooked to medium well or beyond. The waiter changed the steaks. The second round of steaks were better but unevenly cooked and still disappointing. The waiter dismissed our complaints faster than you can discard trash. I was explained that it was the meat, this in a restaurant with its own USDA origin for beef, blame the beef. The grayish beef in front of us was the beef's disposition not overcooking, really? I mentioned this to a manager who could care less. I was handled and discarded like a piece of garbage.  Notwithstanding that, I ran up an $800+ tab that summarily got me ignored. It is self evident that their success means well founded complaints are simply disregarded.

The steaks are served with soup or salad.  The soup option was split pea (gross) so I went with a salad with blue cheese dressing.  It was the best blue cheese dressing ever; thick and creamy with large chunks of blue cheese.  The complimentary bread and butter was kind of sad.  The butter was a slab cut from a stick and was rock hard, and the bread was nothing special.

The steak was flavorful and had a GREAT char to it. I ate the steak alone, and it was awesome. I ate it w/ their house seasoning, and it was awesome. I ate it w/ some horseradish, and it was awesome. This steak is awesome. Get it. -Gibsons Open-Faced Steak Sandwich: my cousin got this, which was topped w/ the ribeye, grilled tomato, baby arugula, and horseradish cream. It was basically the steak we got, but chopped up onto a sandwich. Perfect for those who still want to try the W.R's Chicago Cut, but want something light. We paired our steak w/ a nice bottle of Dona Paula Malbec from Argentina. For sides, we got the Double Baked Potato and Creamed Spinach, which were solid. And, for dessert, we got the famed Macadamia Turtle Pie - a heavenly, monster-sized (our server said it was enough to feed a family of 4-6! See pictures for more) slice of ice cream cake w/ a graham cracker crust (I think?), chocolate and caramel sauce, and tons of macadamia nuts. Already stuffed from our lunch, we questioned whether or not we should order this, but after hearing what it consisted of, we said screw it and ordered it...and then demolished it. I was so stuffed (but happy!) from my meal that I didn't end up eating again until lunch the next day =x The service here is great, too. The servers are so jolly and friendly that it feels as if you're a regular here. Gibsons is definitely a great steakhouse!",0.9981,0.752,0.21,0.037,0.6073200992555832

2015-06-20,3.0,"My first time here, I thought the WR Chicago cut was great.  I thought oysters were small for my liking and the filet mignon was overcooked (we wanted medium rare and it came out medium).  I recommend the Chicago Cut though. Update:  Came back here for Fathers Day and the service was terrible.   I ordered medium rare had to send it back TWICE because it was overcooked.  Yes, they couldn't get it right after two tries.   The third time the steak was basically seared on the outside and raw in the middle (see picture).  At that time, I told them to just put that steak in the oven longer but when it came back to me it was cooked uneven so parts were rare and other parts were medium rare as I like it.   Overall I left paying for a crappy steak and dinner.  This place needs some QC for the food.  For a Chicago steakhouse, Gibsons does a horrible job cooking their steaks the right temperature.",-0.6757,0.849,0.065,0.086,0.41918697244784203
2015-06-20,2.0,"I must be in the minority here, but my experience at Gibson's was certainly not something to write home about.  Steakhouses are expensive, so there's really no point for me to dwell on that as a negative.  What I could not get past is the food itself.  It just was not that great.   My husband and I decided to spend our 10 year anniversary at Gibson's - our first time there.  Our service was really good and I found everyone there very attentive - from the hostess to the waiter to the busboy to the manager.  From an atmosphere standpoint, we were fortunately sat in the covered patio section inside.  I'm not sure what to call the area, but it's off the main dining room.  I'm so glad we were sat there because I found the main dining room very loud and crowded with tons of business people. My husband had the recommended Chicago Cut (22 oz) and I had the 10 oz filet mignon - crusted in black peppercorns.    It came with starter salads which were fine.  I did get the highly recommended blue cheese dressing...and it was blue cheese dressing.  Nothing outstanding over other restaurants or even grocery stores.   The steaks came very quickly, and were both a little bland.  My peppercorns were a little overwhelming, but at least they added a little flavor.  I didn't finish my steak and just ended up throwing out the other half - it was that bland.  The Chicago Cut was similar.  We also ordered a side of Brussel Sprouts - which again were fine, but nothing great. Lastly - we ordered dessert.  All of the desserts are made to serve like four people.  Given that there were only two of us, we got the smaller size cherry pie a la mode.  Typical of our whole meal - it was okay...but certainly not great.  Similar to my steak, we didn't finish it and instead ended up throwing the rest away. I will say that my husband and I are very picky about steak, but when you are paying that much for it, you do expect it to be tasty and good.  Unfortunately, Gibson's did not fit the bill and we will not be back.",0.4334,0.814,0.098,0.088,0.5314302248677248

I ended up calling Nico Osteria that is across the street and they were able to seat us immediately. Given how many good steakhouses there are in Chicago, frankly, I'm quite surprised with the attitude at Gibsons. There is only bad management, nothing to be proud of. Surely there are better ways to plan your operations than just leaving everything to go as it is.  This is the first time I need to wait this long in a respectable establishment.

Let's talk steak... All were cooked to perfection and delicious. The waiter did mess up my order but was quick to apologize and run off to get my correct steak. Unfortunate he was so quick he only heard me say I ordered the filet and didn't hear the rest of my request for Oscar style... It's ok it was still good.

We had a large group so we ordered a lot of food.  My wife and I shared the surf and turf and we pretty much ordered every single side.  The blue cheese scalloped potato was by far everyones favorite.

Ambience: We had prior reservations and had to wait for ~5 mins which was perfect to peek at the walls adorned with autographed pictures of celebrities who have dined here. They also have a full bar + Seating area right next to the hostess table. Live music playing from the piano instantly gave a great vibe to this buzzing establishment. Service: Our server was welcoming , courteous and took great care of our party throughout the evening. The recommendations for Wine , Sides and the detailed presentation of the Steaks you could choose from were on point. Wine Pairings: They have a huge selection of Wines + a Full bar to choose from. We got a bottle of Chianti Wine which was attractively priced at ~45$$ and went great with the steaks we ordered. Steaks: We had   - 10oz Pepper crusted Filet Mignon. - 10oz Filet Mignon. - 16oz  Roasted Prime Rib with au jus and horseradish cream sauce. The recommendation is that you have the steaks Medium ( though I felt it was more Medium_Rare than Medium) and I suggest you abide by it; as we happily discovered each of these steaks were cooked at the right temperature and went perfectly with our wine selection. I had the Roasted Prime Rib ; which I found to be perfectly roasted/charred on the outside but moist-pink and juicy on the inside. The au jus and the horseradish sauce further elevated the taste of this steak for me. Ala-Carte Sides: - Brussel Sprouts with Bacon in Maple bourbon butter and Bacon - Creamed Spinach - Sauteed Spinach and Broccoli These sides are HUGE and are meant for sharing. I liked the Brussel sprouts the most. The creamed spinach could use some seasoning. Included Sides: The steaks come with an option of  house salad / soup of the day (Chicken Noodle). I opted for the House Salad  with Blue cheese dressing which was good ... though I repented for not getting the soup instead because the Chicken noodle soup was a home-run. Desserts: Calling the Desserts HUGE would be an understatement. Each item on the Dessert menu can easily feed ~15 ppl. I know steakhouses are knowing for LARGE dessert portions but I felt they are  just OVERDOING it here with these GARGANTUAN portions.  We skipped Desserts all-together a tad bit disappointed that they do not have smaller portions for Desserts and opted for Cappuccino's instead.  Extras:  They have an awesome selection of Cigars by the Coat check counter where you can also get your hands on some Gibson steak knives +more.

After examining them she told me she couldn't serve me because my ID wasn't horizontal (I'm 25 years old).  I offered multiple forms of ID, but she declined my offer and left.  She came back 10 minutes later and rudely said ""I need another form of ID to serve you.""  After some time she returned to the table and asked what we'd like.  I asked for her opinion on what to have and she gave me just one option without explaining anything about it or what I like.   After the wine was brought back we did not see Rona for 25 minutes.  Eventually a busboy asked if we needed anything, as if he were also surprised that we had been here for that long without ordering.  After some time Rona returned and bluntly asked ""what do you want?"".  We reluctantly continued to give this server/restaurant our service and ordered. After some time the food arrived, brought by another busboy.  Rona never even came by the table to check if everything came out all right.  The side of bleu cheese mashed potatoes was great, but the entrees were very overcooked.  At this point I was overwhelmed with everything we had went through without a payoff.  Once I received the bill I was almost heartbroken.  I'm happy to pay for a incredible meal with great service, really, even decent service, but this was the worst experience I've ever had in a dining establishment.  We paid and left without leaving a tip.  I have NEVER not left a tip in my life, and despite how bad this experience was, I still felt bad.   End review: this was the worst customer service experience I have been through.  I would suggest walking down the road to a decent mildly priced burger joint and saving your money.",0.8783,0.845,0.09,0.065,0.45697450697450687
2015-04-06,3.0,"Came here for a steak on a Monday night. It was pretty busy and I believe I had the fastest service among the like restaurants. My waiter was knowledgeable and I had a good time talking to him. I also liked his wine recommendation of Discena Malbec Mendoza (Argentina).   I ordered a 20 oz medium-rare bone-in rib eye and I can't say I really enjoyed it.  The char bitterness suppressed the meat flavor, the steak wasn't juicy enough to it and to top it off the meat wasn't tender enough to effortlessly chew it. Mashed potatoes was okay, I liked the garlic piquancy to it. But they come without gravy and the texture wasn't runny enough for me. When I finished, I decided to take as much time as it takes for the stuff to see I'm ready for the check. Excellent! It happened in a blink of my eye. Bottom line is I rate the service 4 stars and the product 3 stars. A few weeks back I was at LongHorn and liked their $20 steak a lot more comparing it to that $60 ""high-end"" steak.

When a steakhouse does that weird ritual of bringing bloody steaks to your table to ask you which one you want, they totally lose me.  I don't see the point.

I will tell you from beginning to end it was one of the most phenomenal experiences I have ever had. This, not only from a steak lover, but also someone who has worked in the customer service field for the better part of the last 16 years. One name says it all and that name is Elvis, our server. The man is more than exceptional and not only did he tend to our every need seamlessly he put on what I consider a show! From his guarantee that he would take great care of us to the time he walked out to hail us a cab he was hands down nothing but the best! The food was beyond what was expected and literally the steak provided moisture that wasn't there to our mouths. The flavors were outstanding and the suggestion of the twice baked potato by Elvis was top notch and nothing shy of perfect. I know this seems to be a ramble of words of praise but this visit certainly deserves it. When Elvis asked what brought us there outside of our 2 year anniversary I simply replied that every time we visit Chicago we have made it a point to try a new steak house.

The steak here lacks juice and flavor. I suspect it's the grill they use as opposed to the broiler method at other steakhouses.  It just didn't do it for me.  I had the 10 oz filet (which is ridiculously large but is the smallest filet option) cooked rare and it was as boring as can be.  No flavor whatsoever.  One plus however is that they don't put butter on the steaks here.  Two diners at our party of four had the WR Chicago ribeye- one had his steak terribly overdone and sent it back. Less than two minutes later out comes another steak only this one may have been sitting there under a heat lamp for awhile.  Though it was cooked to temp, there was no juice or anything running out the med-rare ribeye.  Just kind of odd since the severely overdone one had a good amount of greasiness.  Table was never cleared- you just don't get that same high-end steakhouse experience here as you do at other high end steakhouses in town.   My experience dining in the bar was preferable- the bar area is fun and relaxed yet lively vibe. The dining room was an absolute disaster cluster-f.  You had to strategically decide how to exit your table just to use the restroom and good luck getting back to your table.  I was trapped somewhere in the middle for about 3 minutes and it was annoying.  Clearly this is a fire hazard to have this many people packed in here like sardines that you physically can't turn around in the aisles and must back up the way you came.  Ridiculous.

Overall, my suggestion is they should not participate in restaurant week unless they are planning to make a real effort to attract new customers with their menu and service offerings.  And you should definitely not visit them for restaurant week because despite being reviewed as a great restaurant regularly, I've had better meals and service at McDonald's.",0.9858,0.8,0.135,0.065,0.5312847970742707

Celeb autographed images line the walls and the vibe just makes you feel like a true Chicagoan. We were sat upstairs at a round table. The bar up there looked like something you'd see in a Speakeasy complete with a live piano man serenading the room with his music. Love it! We started with drinks as we browsed the menu. I was feeling super fancy so I opted for a cosmo martini and it was delicious. The service was great. Our waiter was super friendly and prompt. The head chef (or butcher?) came to our table with an IMPRESSIVE display of meats. He explained the size and details of each piece and offered up spice suggestions. This (oddly enough) was one of my first experiences at a Steakhouse, so I was a little hesitant on what to order. Everything seemed so manly and filling, but I felt like I'd be a big loser not to order steak, plus it seemed like it would be a waste of an experience.  SO...I ordered the 10 oz. filet with cajun rub. It was very good! I highly suggest the cajun spices. Although that was the smallest size filet you could order, I honestly could barely finish it. It was very filling. Plus, I started with a cup of there gumbo soup (which was just okay) and bread.

I wanted to write this review to commend the staff on their professionalism and amazing customer service.  I attended a private event on NYE at Gibsons and had a wonderful time. The food was fantastic and the wait staff was great. What really impressed me was that I misplaced my purse towards the end of the evening and the staff could not have been better. They helped me look for it and when I was unable to find it took my friend's phone number (since my phone was of course in my purse). We left for the evening and I received a call about 45 minutes later. Gibsons had my purse if I wanted to pick it up. They were able to let me in after they were closed and had my desk at the front desk. There was excellent communication between all staff about the issue and everything was still in my purse. I could not have been more impressed with the team that they have at the restaurant. It would have been very easy for them to call me the next day or week and I truly appreciate their prompt response.

2014-12-31,3.0,"The wall of celebrity autographs certainly indicates that Gibson's is a Chicago institution. It has certainly been an institution in my life. --it was the restaurant of choice during my husband's yrs in biglaw. The place the aging partners would take us to give an albeit weak ""thank you"" for his 90 hr work weeks.   While it's not my favorite steak in Chicago, Gibson's is a place I've enjoyed frequenting once or twice a year when someone else is buying. ;)  It's lively and loud and feels like a party every night of the week. It's not pretentious. The service is never lacking. The food pretty good and the desserts comically large.  I do wish they offered a smaller steak. The 10 oz filet is the smallest and I can't eat more than 5 oz. Yes, I can have the rest wrapped up, but I don't care for leftover meat. The real reason I like to come here though.... It's certainly not to relive the terrible memories of my ""widow life"" in biglaw, nor to read all of the autographs on their wall, nor the need for a gigantic steak. I come solely for the Macadamia Turtle Pie. Some days I wake up and just know that it's been too long since I've eaten that thick cinnamon graham crust with the mountain of ice cream, whole macadamia nuts and chocolate ganache.

I'd recommend not waisting time on appetizers since the meat is why you are here. Order a large side for two people to share. The cauliflower side with melted cheese is to die for. My biggest complaint, and the reason for the 3 stars is a problem that GIbson's continues to have - they have crammed too many tables into the restaurant. My seat was literally 2 inches from the guy behind me, two of the people were out in the ""isle"" where servers were constantly bumping into them, and one person was pressed in the corner so tight the table had to be moved to allow her to enter and exit the seat.

2014-12-13,5.0,"I've always looked up to Clark W. Griswold. He's an ideal American, a patriot. He represents Chicago and the midwest with all of the big, brash American bad-assery that makes this country great. He's also tempered by an imperfect (to say the least) family and a tendency to overshoot his expectations.  For Clark, expectations are larger than life. Wallyworld offers too much fun. Christmas is about towering trees and enough lights to turn night to day. Europe is filled with adventure and exotic women. Unfortunately for Clark, like me, reality often doesn't meet expectations. Which brings us to steak.  At some point in Chicago's history, the city became known for its steaks. America has two other steak cities -- New York and Kansas City. Arguably, New York is an 'everything' city, but we'll stay with the Midwest. Kansas City's definitive prime steakhouse is Plaza III, a traditional, reliable, charming Midwestern steakhouse that offers just about everything that one would expect: nicely charred prime beef and a basic suite of traditional sides (creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, etc). Over 50 years, Plaza III has built a national reputation on behalf of Kansas City, and rightfully so.   Then there's Chicago, a city where the representative steakhouse is much more ambiguous. Chicago offers everything from frighteningly modern steakhouses to equally frightening older ones. There's a large margin for error in identifying the perfect candidate.   In my Chicago steakhouse search, I channeled my inner Clark W. Griswold. I wanted the best. I wanted something larger than life, something so dramatic and uniquely Chicago that it would change my perception of the American steakhouse. And in a rare instance where my and Clark's lives diverged, the reality of Gibson's managed to exceeded expectation. Warm woods, classic framed photographs and a cozy little gift shop greet you at the door, as do several suited-up managers. The dazzling bar room, draped with classic art deco touches and a nod to modern aviation (via a collection of meticulous model airplanes), sees a recurring cast of both usual suspects and wide-eyed out-of-towners like myself. The dining room, too, uses a tested combination of dim candlelight, mahogany and creamy linens to set the stage for a romantic evening.   Then there's the food. Gibson's is the only steakhouse in the country with its own USDA Certification. All of their steaks are Black Angus and raised on Midwestern farms. Gibson's dry-ages the steaks for 40 days and chars them in an 1800 degree broiler before serving, giving them a smokey, milky, funky, buttery quality that can only result from a good decay and a quick, high-degree char.  In terms of apps and sides, I recommend the shrimp cocktail appetizer (amazingly fresh shrimp the size of my fist, shaved horseradish, classic cocktail sauce), the mashed potatoes with roasted/sauteed garlic, and the plump, fragrant steamed asparagus with mild, fresh Hollandaise sauce.  Between the mesmerizing steaks, the array of wonderful side dishes, the classic decor and the warm embrace of several Plymouth Gin martinis, Gibson's has earned its place in my memory as the best steakhouse that Chicago has to offer. It has also become as quintessential to the Midwest for me as Clark W. Griswold, who I'm sure would love it. I can see his eyes lighting up now.",0.9964,0.814,0.144,0.042,0.5208568367659278

Now the bad news......this was my 2nd steak dinner of the week and I had high hopes but was quite disappointed. I got the Porterhouse which is normally a great steak and quite flavorful in my experience. This one had really very little flavor which I think is tragic considering the price of it. I've had better flavor of the beef itself from local grocery stores, honestly. The sides were ok but not in the least exceptional.

2014-12-03,5.0,"Gibsons Bar and Steakhouse is on Rush Street, located  in one of the wealthiest areas in the country,  with  expensive businesses that cater to the neighborhood. Rush Street is known for it's nightlife, which features five star restaurants and entertainment. I have been coming to Gibsons  since they opened around 25 years ago. The food and service have always been consistently superb, five star, but are a little pricey.  When going to Gibsons it is best if you make reservations, or you may be disappointed by not being able to get in.  Even with reservation,  at the busiest times there is a good chance that you will be asked to wait in the bar. We had reservations over Thanksgiving weekend and had to wait  in the bar area, which  was not the most pleasant experience, because the bar was very crowded with a large number of people who were compacted together leaving guests no personal space at all. Along with the people waiting for their reservation, there were people trying to eat in the bar, along with the regulars who go to be seen. The dining room is very large, in addition there is outdoor seating in the summer and a private room on the second floor. When we were seated, our waiter Mike came and asked us for our drink orders, returning quickly he brought with him a large tray showing and explaining the different cuts and sizes of steaks and a gigantic lobster tail. Even though Gibsons is known as a steakhouse they do offer many fish and seafood dishes which are outstanding. All entrées come with a house salad or soup. My son ordered the WR's Chicago Cut 22oz., double baked potato and cream spinach. The portions are so large that you can share the sides. When the steak arrived it was beautifully charred, served at the correct temperature, very tasty,  and extremely tender. I ordered salmon which was on the menu , I asked if they could prepare it a different way? Mike was wonderful, asking me how I wanted the salmon prepared? I asked if the chef could have the salmon in lemon butter sauce with capers, it was delicious!  In addition the potato and creamed spinach added to our meals. Unfortunately we had no room for desert because they are gigantic like everything else. The meal was wonderful and Mike is a superb waiter.  After dinner the bar area had cleared out some and we were able to listen to Lloyd Wilson, who gave a fantastic jazz performance on the piano. Lloyd Wilson performs Wednesdays through Saturdays, 9 pm - 1 am. I would recommend coming to Gibsons just to hear Lloyd Wilson perform, his wonderful music, which really adds a lot to Gibsons. Considering the short wait earlier in the evening to be seated ,   I am giving Gibsons 4.5 stars but will bump up the rating to five stars, because of Mike's fantastic service, and Lloyd Wilson's wonderful performance.",0.9969,0.802,0.158,0.04,0.6297313797313796

The star of the meal was the Gruyere cauliflower and that was because Rebecca noticed it was burnt and missing cheese so she returned it to be done properly.  However, the 26 oz porterhouse we ordered as medium arrived charred all around, not even the bone got away from being burnt to a black! On a side note, the valet service was inattentive- the times I have been here with my newer vehicle the valet crew runs to open my doors for me but this time my car was at the dealer so I drove an older vehicle which resulted in us having to get out of the car for the valet driver who was standing there to acknowledge that we were trying to receive service.

For dessert, our party of three shared the pecan pie, which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The waiter was right in saying that all the desserts on their menu were ""large, huge or humongous"".

2014-11-11,3.0,Have been there before but it was long time ago and don't remember much from that experience. Was in the neighborhood Sunday evening and decided to have dinner there with my family. Quite honestly I was neither pleased nor let down by this place. I ordered the New York sirloin and told the waiter I wanted it well done and no pink. Well they burned it and very dry on the outside but pink and a bit bloody on the inside. Everything else was great but the steak was not what I asked for. Can't have this on a restaurant that is known as one of the top steak restaurants in the city. Great location though.,0.938,0.754,0.173,0.073,0.540959595959596

2014-11-09,5.0,"If I could give Gibson's 10 stars, I would.  I have had steak all over the world, this was my second time here and I knew a few months in advance I had to bring my person here to have an amazing meal. What we didn't expect is not only did we have an amazing meal, but we had amazing service. We had the following: Gumbo (fantastic) Caesar Salad (Tasted like a normal caesar) Meats.. Two 10oz Filet's Twice baked potato Creamed Spinach Amazing Banana Cake/Pie Yes, it sounds like a lot, but when you are going somewhere as good as this, you have to go all the way.  Let me start by saying this was the best steak I've ever had, 4 year ago, last time I was here. I've compared a lot of steaks since then, but came back here and found out no matter how far you travel, Gibson's is still the best steak in the country, and that is an understatement.  The gumbo we started with was pretty darn good, the salad was also fresh and good. But don't fill up with those, or the bread. Wait for your steak, which apparently is imported from heaven. We ordered medium rare plus -- medium rare, more towards the rare side. You know you're in a good steakhouse when they don't even question that order. The steaks were perfect. PERFECT. I can cook a good filet at home, even prime, but I don't think I can cook it like this, without the thousands in salamander or 1800 degree oven equipment they have. Twice baked potato is still the best I've ever had. Don't pass this up -- they'll cut it in half for you and your special someone before they serve it to you.  The creamed spinach isn't quite as good as the same from Ruth's Chris, but still very good.  Last, our server, Zach. We may have spent over $300k in our life in restaurants. We consider ourselves 'foodies'. We both have decided Zach was the best waiter we've had in all of our travels. Although, we don't want to ignore the rest of the staff that also helps out and is available throughout the meal. Zach kept us on our feet and surprised us several times...

We look online about a famous Chicago place and this one was the first on the list, so we made reservations. When we arrived we have to wait about 5 minutes for our table. So we just explored around and look at all the pictures of famous people all over the walls, there was some ambiance music playing, it was like jazz or something very relaxing. I went and talked to the host and told her it was my boyfriend's birthday and ask her if they could sing happy birthday and she asked me for his name and winked at me. The host took us to the table and a very friendly and polite waiter came to take our drink orders. We all asked for margarita sand waters. After he brought the drinks, the chef came with some steaks that I thought were real but they I found out they were fake lol. He explained us the process of their steaks, the differences and gave us his recommendation. My boyfriend ordered the rib eye which I think is under W.R.'s Chicago Cut (22 oz) in the menu, He likes his steak rare; I ordered the New york cook medium; and my friend ordered the filet mignon cook medium well. For sides, we ordered mash potatoes, and two bake potatoes. The food was wonderful!! Best steak I have ever tasted. It has a flavor that I cannot describe. Unfortunately, my boyfriend's steak was not rare enough, so when the manager came to check on us, he told him how dissapoined he was about his steak and immediately they removed it. They came back with a new one and the chef waited to see his reaction. HE LOVED his steak, he said is the best steak he ever had. The bake potatoes where huge. We were glad we did not get any appetizers. After the food all the waiters came and sang happy birthday, they brought the biggest piece of chocolate cake I have ever seen. It was delicious!

Had a wonderful meal and left happy and satisfied.  Went a couple more times after having moved to Chicago and we've never been let down. This place is so cool. It looks like it hasn't changed since it opened its doors, and I mean that in a good way. The tables are set close, so they pack the dining room and the waiters wear butchers coats. Kinda cheesy, but totally awesome too. I feel like I'm rubbing elbows with corrupt Chicago politicians every time I walk in. The food is incredible too.  My wife and I prefer steakhouses, because she can get her lobster fix, while I get a big fat filet mignon. Let me tell you, the larger filet option at Gibsons (at 14oz) is the biggest filet I've ever seen... almost as big as other nice steakhouses' NY strip or something.

Half a ripe creamy avocado stuffed with briny, sweet crab meat drizzled with a light vinaigrette, cracked black pepper and flecks of sea salt... So FUQN DELICIOUS! I love that thing!

The baked potato was buttery, and roasted to perfection with the charred crispy skin on the bottom. Sautéed mushrooms were fresh and not at all watery, like they were roasted first then sautéed. Perfect sides to the perfect chops. I tell you, the cows that have their lives for our meals did not do so in vain.  Then the main event, I ordered the Chicago chop... I tell you, our table was a rambunctious bunch, however when the steaks got to the table, silence then that first bite... Everyone made that sound.

Then Yelped Gibsons and saw all the amazing reviews and figured that this place must be pretty awesome! So I came here with my colleagues for a late night dinner after we finished a work event, around 10:30 PM. They were pretty accommodating in seating our party, even though there was some confusion on if we had 6 or 10 people. So the service isn't bad.... but the food was just... not good.  I ordered the Australian lobster tail, which came with a salad, mixed veggies (steamed cauliflower, carrots and asparagus), and also ordered a side of mashed potatoes. It started out well since the starter salad was huge! Two of my colleagues ordered steak, one was ordered medium well and the other medium. Well... my colleagues' steak were both extremely pink, and the one who wanted it done medium well only ate the meat around the edges because she couldn't stand how red it was on the inside. If that was me, I would have sent that shit back to the kitchen. However.... I was wishing I had that problem with my lobster, because my lobster was obviously overcooked. It was chewy and just was not pleasant to eat. I had about three bites and was done. I paid $73 for overcooked lobster that felt like I was chewing on rubber? I suppose I would have sent this back to the kitchen if I was hungrier, but I was fine with just leaving most of it untouched since I had bites earlier at The Dec. But now that I think about it, I can't remember if the server ever came by to ask how the food was... maybe he did and we just lied and said it was good. Because mine certainly wasn't. At the end of the meal, the waiter brought out a flourless chocolate cake, compliments of the kitchen. It looked delicious, and I was hoping that it would be moist and as good as it looked.

Just that he kept looking at my friends Filet Mignon and Rib Eye. So you come to a steakhouse... please get the steak.

My cousin got the 10oz, and I also got the roared cauliflower. It came with salad or soup and I chose salad. The salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but it was still good. The lettuce was very fresh and crisp.  We finally received out steaks. And it was everything I had heard about an hoped for. It was so tender. It cut through so easily and cooked to perfection. Their dipping sauce was delicious. I wish I had gotten the 10oz because I could not finish and it went to waste. My cousin didn't like hers...but that's because she doesn't know what good steak is. She considers ""outback"" as good steak. Lol  Then after we were done, they came over with ice cream and did the birthday chant, which was nice.  Our waiter ended up being super sweet and awesome. He was super friendly and patient with us. He actually invited us out for drinks after work since we weren't from there and weren't sure of what places to go. but we kindly declined.  Overall, it was amazing. I definitely recommend this place! I would totally go back if I wasn't a vegetarian.",0.9981,0.733,0.227,0.04,0.5924119241192412

They presented an assortment of breads with butter but I didn't get to grab any. Main course was the filet mignon with basically half a head of broccoli and roasted potatoes. Ordered it medium and wow it was amazing. So tender and flavorful I hadn't had anything like that in a long time. Broccoli was pretty standard boiled and scantly seasoned but that's what I expect from places like this. Standard fare. The roasted potatoes definitely made up for the lack of seasoning on the broccoli. Rosemary, thyme and everything you want on roasted potatoes.  Dessert was the macadamia turtle pie which was just amazing. If I didn't have any restraint I would have had the whole chunk they served us.

We placed our orders and about 30 minutes later, we were informed that they were out of the double baked potato. We were disappointed as we went with the intention of enjoying the potato with our steaks, and structured our meal around that side (ordered a light app to accommodate the size of the potato, etc). It was also upsetting as we waited almost 45 mins before we were even able to put in our order (not a problem, I get that they take your order each course at a time and are very leisurely about the dinner experience) but I certainly wondered if there would have been potato available had we put in our order much earlier.  When our meal came out, imagine our surprise when a split portion of their GIANT double baked potato appeared next to our steaks! Our server had actually gone over to Hugo's next door to get the necessary ingredients get make the double baked potato. That was completely above and beyond, and I have never been surprised like that at a meal!  The only reason I am giving this experience 4 stars instead of 5 is the steaks. It was apparent they had been left out waiting for him to return (or perhaps they were waiting for the potato to finish cooking), as they were a little cold. They were also dry as I ordered a filet medium rare, but my plate (even after cutting through to the center) remained dry as a bone, not a drop of juice anywhere. I happen to like my steak hot and juicy, and this was cool and dry. I didn't want to say anything though, since they had already gone so above and beyond for our side item.  Finally, Gibson's was also kind enough to comp us dessert (even though we were stuffed to the gills and it took us 4 days to eat the leftover dessert).

I was nervous that the garlic would overpower the flavor of the meat, but it was just the perfect amount of garlic that ended up complimenting it. It was cooked to perfection - seared on the outside and juice and medium rare as I requested on the inside. I very rarely finish steaks, but I made myself finish this one because it was so perfect.  The steak came with a salad, which was also really good. The dressing was outstanding - it was some kind of vinaigrette. We also ordered several sides to share - baked potatoes, twice baked potatoes, and spinach. All were fantastic, but we couldn't finish them because we were so stuffed!

We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated and there was some confusion as to where we would be seated, not a big deal. We ordered a bottle of wine, Caesar salad, crab cocktail, 2 filets, and mashed potatoes. I wish I had gotten the sauce for the crab cocktail on the side because it was overwhelmingly spicy, but everything else was wonderful. The steaks were perfect, on par with (if not better than) other upscale steakhouses like Morton's and Capital Grille. I thought the mashed potatoes were really good, given that it was simply done and didn't have any additional toppings. Our server (Richard, I believe) was wonderful. He was very friendly and conversational without being intrusive. We mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and recent engagement and he came back with a celebratory dessert for us.

Upon arrival our hostess was very bubbly and friendly, which is always nice but wasn't the case at Ditka's for instance. Give her an A. We did have time to get a drink at the bar and as seemed to happen to us everywhere this trip, the bartender just wasn't very friendly, he was Efficient and quick, which is the top priority I suppose.  Maybe these guys are worked too hard, I don't really get it... B. Our server at Gibson's was spectacular.  The best we had this trip.  He knew the menu in an out and was happy to discuss it with us. He gets an A and about 10+'s!!! Upon his suggestion I had a king crab appetizer and it was very good! It get's an A.  I then had the bone in filet ((med-rare)).   It was charred on the outside, which I like, and was tender - though there were a couple inedible pieces, unusual for a filet, especially a prime filet.  Further, it wasn't extremely flavorful and was cooked a tad over med-rare (maybe that was the loss of flavor).  It was very good and I give it a solid B, but having had the same steak at Kinzie steakhouse two nights before put a lot of pressure on this steak and side by side Kinzie won the comparison hands down. I also had the loaded mashed potatoes which was excellent, another A. My wife had the cedar planked whitefish.  It was flaky and moist and she liked it and ate it all but found it less fulfilling than the perch at Ditka's (it's a stretch to compare these two, I know).  Give it a B.

2014-04-04,5.0,"1 year ago TODAY I had the *W.R.'s Chicago Cut* steak at Gibson's steakhouse. Unfortunately I was half in the bag by the time I ordered the steak. I was there on business and I was alone.  I walked in shortly after 5:00pm and had a drink at the bar. I think Mad Men was on TV and my dumb @$$ wanted to act like Mr. Big Shot and ordered an old fashioned. To hell with that God awful drink! Breakfast that morning was a cup of coffee and lunch was a banana and a granola bar (long story). The point is, my stomach was on empty and after a few mixed drinks and a Hacker-Pschorr Hefe Weisse Naturtrüb beer (you like that?) I was... TOASTED. I went here almost on a dare. The GIBSONS logo is featured prominently on a TV show called The League. I also researched beforehand which steak I was going to get. Check out this marketing plug:  ""We are the only restaurant group in the country to have its own USDA Certification (USDA Gibsons Prime Angus beef). Our beef is breed specific, Black Angus, and raised on sustainable farms in the Upper Midwest. Our beef is corn fed for 120 days and aged for 40 days, providing maximum flavor and tenderness.""

In my inebriated state of mind I recall refusing having something to go with it.  No salad, no taters, no green beans, no asparagus, no need for that rabbit food. This cave man wants 22 ounces of meat! That bad mother came out piping ass hot!  I've never in my life had a hot steak. Usually it's warm almost room temperature but this mother was HOT.  I tore into that thing up like Mike Tyson in the 80's. All I remember is that it was good, damn good, like WHOA MAN good. So good, it was able to penetrate my mental fog and snap me back to reality. I remember a great charred taste and a very robust flavor throughout the cut. It was a long 1 mile walk to the hotel but it was worth it. The moral of the story is don't get drunk before you eat a $50 steak.",0.9619,0.801,0.111,0.088,0.5054166666666666

Service was wonderful. He brought it right back. What was served was three tenderloin medallions on a bed a lettuce. That is not what I call an $18 salad. Gibson's used to be over the top deliciousness. That restaurant is gone. Server talked about the rib-eye sandwich that the prior chef had made famous. He also said that the new chef changed it. No longer is it famous! One of my table mates ordered it and it was a joke. The meat was of low quality and came with blue cheese(which must be an automatic ingredient) and arugula.

I tried it the first time, because I got really great recommendations from a friend who dined there while he was in town for business. And the locals raved about it, so I figure Chicago locals should know best, right? Boy, was I wrong! The restaurant is super crowded; you're pretty much sitting on the next table's lap. I saw a couple sitting next to us on a date, and I have no clue how they could have heard each other over the noise of the restaurant. The food was very disappointing. The steaks came with soup or salad. I tried one of each the both times I dined here. Both items were just mediocre, but its nice that they give you a lil precursor with your meal. The steaks were the worst. I ordered the bone in rib-eye, medium rare... And it came out pretty much burnt! And the second time I ordered the same thing: bone in rib-eye, medium rare, it also came out burnt again!? Who and how are they making the steaks back there in the kitchen!? A little seared is good for flavor, but the steak was burnt and so dry! Our friends also ordered the prime rib (which was better, but its no comparison to 5 Crowns), and the BBQ ribs (also dry). We got creamed spinach and mashed potatoes as the sides, nothing memorable. I've tried a lot of steakhouses: Mastro's, Flemings, CUT, Delmonico, DelFriscos, Capital Grille... And Gibsons by far was the most disappointing. I even tried to give it a second chance when I was back in town!

We arrived for dinner and we were seated immediately. My dining companion had already dined here in the past and knew exactly what she wanted so we skipped having them bring the raw steaks to the table. I guess that's an important part of the dining experience if you're a meat eater but my friend was aware that I don't eat meat so she asked them not to bring it to the table. Lol!! Go Inga! I do however, eat fish and our waiter recommended the Planked Whitefish for me. It is served on a cedar plank but it is not cedar cooked. My fish was really good and really HUGE! my meal was served with a salad. That salad was quite blah! I think it was iceberg lettuce with cucumber and tomato and a dressing that tasted bottled. Inga's steak was thick and medium rare. She said it was perfect (but only after they made it a second time. The first one came out medium well). What topped the night off was the pianist at the bar. After dinner we found a few stools piano side and he played us some Sinatra, a little Luther, some Anita Baker and it literally made my night! Great meal, great drinks, and great music!

2014-02-14,5.0,"Gibsons on Rush Street is one of three steakhouses in the big, greater Chicago areas that I would like to go to on a regular basis.  Three things I like about our Gibsons experience on Wednesday night, the 12th.   One, our waiter presented a tray of raw steak to our table; what a vivid view of steaks we would be eating or choosing from. It also gave us a good sense of how big, different steak cuts actually are. Plus, taking pictures of this tray gives me some bragging on other social network sites of eating steaks at Gibsons where Michael Jordan and Yao Ming like or used to dine.  Two, my big porterhouse steak (26 oz) was cooked to exactly medium rare as I ordered. Lots of other reviews talked a lot about steak being overcooked or under-cooked as a key review factor/criteria.   Three, Gibsons has a wine list that has two hundred wine labels from 30 dollars to 400-500 dollars. I think the wine prices are very reasonable by comparing everyone else's wine lists.  The wine list is on the back of the one-page but large size menu. It looks friendly; a thick wine list or even a wine book on luxurious paper stock would be too intimidating or too serious to most people I would argue. We just wanted good food and good wine.   I bet this place will be totally and insanely packed today, the Valentine's day.  Bring a hot date to a steak dinner at this place, hmmm...

We were seated at a booth and there was good footage between us and the next table, so we didn't feel like we were elbow to elbow and settled in to enjoy our greatly anticipated steak dinner. We didn't willy nilly choose this place. It came with great recommendations and we didn't want a chain. We love Ruth/Capital, but we have those at home. Our choices were Keefers or Gibsons...  About 20 minutes into our dining 10 HUGE, OBNOXIOUSLY, CRUDE guys were seated at a round table - directly next to us. They had to make the table bigger to seat all of them. THere was about an 7 inch space between our table and the back side of a rather large, loud, crude man...This gap was the pathway for all dinners/drinks going to and fro from front to back. I cringed every time someone had to turn sideways to get by...more crotch and ass on my table than I ever care to experience. People actually having to stop directly at our table whenever there was a backup. So we're trying to eat, talk and we have bodies hanging at our table.

Either way, it worked out well for us. While walking around Chicago, we decided to pop in during lunch to try our luck at the bar. Luck was on our side and we planted ourselves at the bar. Sidenote- I LOVE sitting at the bar at most establishments. Good conversation with other patrons and bartender are always a plus! The bartenders name is Paul and was so friendly. Could it be that everyone in this city is friendly? Or maybe because most in LA are unfriendly?? We chose to split the Gibson cut (bone in rib eye) and a couple beers. The staff were kind enough to split the soup we ordered. I loved dipping the bread into the gumbo, it made it all so good. The steak was HUMONGOUS. Splitting this meal was definitely the way to go.

The pianist was switching from classical music to Billy Joel renditions to piano-fied today's top hits. He was fabulous. I had a glass of wine and the bread was good.

I didn't send it back or complain (I hate doing that!) but instead just picked around the edges for the more cooked parts of the meat. I had a salad with my steak which was good-- nothing special. I was served by the Irish kid behind the bar. He was adorable and a great bar tender/server.

2013-09-17,2.0,"I had friends visiting for out of town for my birthday, and they were determined to go to Gibsons Steakhouse as They had heard so many good things about it. I made reservations for 8:00 pm on Saturday, August 31, 2013. We arrived at 7:45 pm and were told that It wold be a few minutes before we were seated because of our arrival time. That was fine. We went into the bar area and enjoyed the music. 8:05 comes and we haven't been seated yet. 8:15 we are finally seated after my friend went to the Hostess for a 3rd time.  Our server was Michael, who was a delight. He was very personable and had great selections. We all order drinks (I ordered a Dragonberry drink) and they were really good.  We all ordered the filet (10oz) with a side of mashed potatoes and a house salad. The salad was underwhelming but I could not contain my excitement about getting a medium filet.  ROUND 1 The filet arrives with our side......The filet is sitting on the plate and is lukewarm. Less than lukewarm actually. The steak was cooked medium but there were no juices flowing..nothing. The mashed potatoes were cold also.  I felt like I could have gone to Outback and had a better steak. My friends steak were presented in the same manner.  After talking to Michael, he took our steaks back to the kitchen.  ROUND 2: Steak comes back. Same steak, it is not hot, but the outside is charred and the steak is no longer medium. Because my friends are hungry, they deal with it and ask for A1 sauce. That was the last straw for me. I refuse to put steak sauce on a filet cooked medium. I told Michael the issue and he agreed. He was a great sport throughout our ordeal. The mashed potatoes are still not up to par either.  ROUND 3: The steak comes out. Before I even take out my knife, I already know this is it. FINALLY. I get kind of emotional because it took 3 tries for a STEAKHOUSE to get my steak order correct. And the steak is delectable. but I can't fully enjoy it because of the presentation of the food before that.  Kathleen is the ONLY Reason I would ever even consider coming back to Gibsons steakhouse and trying it again. After attempting to take to one manager, we were completing dismissed. I explained to him how the food that came to us from the kitchen multiple times was not up to par and the only thing he couldn't muster up an apology. We were offered dessert, but did not want to take a chance of that being a failure also.  Kathleen had walked by our table early and I just loved her aura and the beautiful ring on her hand. Upon talking with Kathleen, she was completely apologetic and took care of our meal and even assisted us with our checks so that we could tip Michael (WHO WAS COMPLETELY AWESOME).  The only reason I may try it again is because of the service of the managing partner Kathleen. I could tell that she truly cared about every guests' experience there and was offended that our first experience at Gibsons was less than extraordinary.

The fare was just average at best. Nothing outstanding about the tastes. The filet mignon was good and cooked well but nothing special about it that made it stick out from other fine steakhouses. The mashed potatoes were bland but the gravy they served with it was delicious. Our spinach and broccoli was very generic, too. Could have been sauteed a bit longer with a bit more garlic, perhaps.  Gibson's was reasonably and competitively priced for a fine steakhouse and for the large portions that they offered. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our server was an older gentleman who was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. We appreciated his honesty with our questions and his thoroughness.  As previously stated, we frequent many fine steakhouses and we honestly very much enjoy Flemings the best because they have offered the most consistency with fare taste, price and service.

2013-08-16,2.0,"I really must have the worst luck ordering at Gibson's because I have been there twice and I swear each time it was not a pleasant meal. First time I ordered the sea scallops - I LOVE scallops - and they were NOT appetizing at all! Wayyyyyy to much oil/butter on them and wayyyyyy to much garlic breadcrumbs on top, sea scallops are so delicate and light and the oil/breadcrumbs COMPLETELY masked the flavor of them. The 2nd time, thought I would try again, and ordered the grouper. Grouper is usually a pretty thick cut of a fish. THIS THING CAME OUT AND WAS ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH THICK!!!!!!!!!! ONE TINY filet of fish and some fricken corn seasoned with way too much cayenne pepper on top. That's it. OKAY if you are going to charge me that much at least make it worth the money. They are just NOT the place to go for seafood and I know they are a ""steakhouse"" and have their ""own grade of steak"" blah blah but really if you are going to charge that much for a seafood entrée then it better be damn good I don't care. Next, we were celebrating a birthday and decided on the carrot cake as our free dessert. Let me just say that BIGGER IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER PEOPLE!!!!!! So at first you are amazed because it is this HUGE piece of carrot cake and WOW it is so big and OMG are we even going to be able to finish it with 4 people? But YUCK it is not good!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE carrot cake and I was disappointed yet again. The best part of carrot cake is the cream cheese frosting and this was the worst cream cheese frosting of my life. You could tell they used about 14 of the amount of cream cheese that they should have because it was an extremely BLAND frosting. The carrot cake had walnuts inside of it and they were all BURNT!!!!!!!!!!! YUCK! Nothing like a huge bite of carrot cake to be ruined by the bitter taste of a burnt walnut. Not to mention the cake was dry but that is almost inevitable with such a large cake (but again, bigger is not always better).  The people I was with seemed to enjoy their food. I may just have bad luck in ordering. Anyways I would rather go to Capital Grille or Keefers in a heartbeat, highly recommend those steakhouses!",0.994,0.741,0.177,0.082,0.5366093474426807

I cannot express my gratitude to the staff for our event yesterday, the beautiful room (with enough extra room to network around the tables), the food, all making the experience the very best.  All of the feed back from our attendees has been stellar.   The A/V prep was exceptional, 2 big screens visible from every corner of the room, an on site sound technician who had all kinds of microphones and the perfect laptop setup made our speakers comfortable.  He also had a sound board and monitored and adjusted the sound throughout the presentation. In addition, they packed up all the left over food for us to take back to the office.  Our staff was happy with an afternoon snack and are still enjoying sandwiches, grilled vegetables and mini burgers for breakfast and lunch today.

2013-03-18,2.0,"My boyfriend and I had decided to go to Gibson's on Mar 17, 2013 (which happens to be the most 'drunken' holiday, St.Patty's day). He had never been to Gibson's before, and although Gibson's is in the 'Viagra Triangle', and there are many other surrounding bars nearby, I was under the assumption that the 'drunks' would be elsewhere besides Gibson's. And BOY, I was WRONG. I loved the fact that we were seated right away, without making any reservations. That was a shocker.  The server was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  The food was immaculate. Well, of course, the Steak. Our starter was a 1/2 size of French Fries (amongst 2 people, I recommend the 1/2 size). I ordered a Filet Mignon, he ordered Sirloin Steak. Our dishes satisfied us 100%.  And then......... Drumroll please.... Ok. I've been to Gibson's in the past. The atmosphere was classy. People were on their best behavior. NOT TODAY. The 'drunken-holiday'. Out of all the tables available in Gibson's, the hostess sat 3 drunken fools next to us. NEXT to us. The 1 drunken broad said to me (while I was enjoying my steak).... ""We promise, we'll be nice"". The 2nd drunken broad said to me (while I continued enjoying my steak)... ""Weren't you at that bar we were at?"" The third drunken bastard spoke extremely loud about his 'sexual prowess"" to the 2 broads.  ARE you fucking kidding Me?  They let these 3 fuckers in, and sat them next to us? Right before they were seated, they were already loud. I thought to myself, ""OH, GREAT"".  I feel totally insulted by Gibson's that they allowed this behavior in their establishment. They did NOTHING to quiet them down. After steak, I wanted to complain right away, and leave Gibson's forever, but both My Boyfriend and I decided to order a Cherry Pie, which was exquisite, and in disbelief that the table next to us continued to be disrespectful. We spoke with management before deciding to pay. My boyfriend complained to the manager, and we were given $25 off of our bill. Then, the manager offered us free drinks at the bar. ""Absolutely NO I stated"". Honestly, I wanted to get the hell out of Gibson's.  After paying, My Boyfriend decided to politely lash out his frustration and anger to the 3 drunken fools. He stated that they were the three rudest, disgusting, grotesque human beings that we have ever had to dine next to. He continued to say 'he didn't give a damn how much money the 3-drunks made.. they should be ashamed of themselves, and their behavior'. Gibson's let NON-CLASSY 3 drunken fucks into their establishment. Sat them next to Us. What the fuck !  Will we visit Gibson's again? Probably NOT. It was a real disappointment.

2013-03-08,3.0,"A nice steakhouse on Rush Street near downtown Chicago ... how you rate it depends on what you were looking for. This place is a raucous and noisy restaurant, jam packed with tables and people. There isn't much room between tables, and you pretty much have to yell across for your table mates to hear you. But if you really came here to have a great steak - you won't be disappointed. Portions are very large, and they know how to cook steaks - red or pink in the middle, you'll get it right. Service is friendly but basic ... with many tables and a busy house, service is often inattentive. They forgot to offer us another round of drinks, probably in their hurry to turn the tables. While this is not a Four-Star dining experience, it is a famous watering hole in Chicago and many people have it on their must see list for entertaining out-of-town guests ... as such it is always busy, so reservations are recommended. This is not a place for kids or even teenagers ... strictly an adult steak joint. It also is not a stop for a quiet, romantic dinner. If you are on your way to a Blackhawks hockey game at the United Center or simply walking over from the Drake Hotel on Michigan Avenue for a change of pace, this is a great place to stop for a big steak and a strong drink before the puck drops or the night sets in. You'll often see some of the Chicago beautiful people hanging around, or sports names in town for a game. The steaks come with a nice big char on the outside and are tender inside.

The din is such that we frequently couldn't hear people on the other side of the table.   When the waiter brought samples of the steaks we might order, we simply couldn't understand him.  Not only was it so noisy, but the waiter spoke so quickly and with so thick of an accent it was a wasted effort.  He also took our drink order without explaining the different types of wine available.  Later on in the meal, my husband ordered another glass of wine.  I declined, but the waiter brought me another glass-not gratis, I might add.   When the salads arrived, my son's salad had the wrong dressing on it.  The busboy was apologetic and quickly replaced it with the correct choice.   The steaks were gargantuan, but good.  It's a shame that they're so huge, as three of our people were women, and didn't come close to eating half of their serving. They need to offer a small portion for those of us who can't eat Flintstone-sized steaks.  The vegetable tray (at over $11) was sparce, and not worth the expense.  One member of our party had to ask twice for his glass of milk. As a dessert choice we ordered the Essie Kup cake, which is about 10"" tall and definitely enough for an entire table.  It had a very mild chocolate taste with chocolate shavings.  To eat the cake, we were given very large, unwieldly tablespoons instead of small teaspoons.  The cake also had several scoops of vanilla ice cream flanking it.  But it didn't come with any spoon to serve the ice cream.   Finally, one of our guests was given her filet wrapped up to go, even though when she was originally asked if she wanted it wrapped, she declined.

I knew this place was a tourist trap from reading the reviews but my friend insisted that she received good recommendations for it so we made reservations. My friends and I got the bone-in ribeye, prime rib, and BBQ ribs. For sides, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The steaks comes with soup or salad, both are just average and nothing too memorable. The rib eye came pretty well seared, and when I say seared I mean close to being burnt. A little char is good for flavor, but black and crusty is another. The prime rib was better than the rib eye. The BBQ ribs were dry and bland. Overall the meats weren't bad, but I've been to Mastros, Ruth's Chris, Flemings and all of those were better than Gibsons.

The place is packed, and the nice girl up front tells us we will have to wait about 15 minutes. 20 minutes later the girl comes back to us and tells it will be another 10 minutes and they want to buy all4 of us a drink for being patient, we say ok, 4 Makers Mark Manhattens (not a cheap drink), no problem the drinks come quick. 10 minutes later we are seated with AA nice window table on Rush St, then the terrific waiter, Elvis,  comes over and apologizes again for our delay, and says they are giving us a complimentary cold Seafood Tower for 4 w Shrimp , crabmeat etc, it was great. Steaks, about 3 sides for the table and a couple of glasses of Cab and Zin later, waiter then tells us Dessert is on the house ! We had some humongous Apple Cobbler a al mode. Check comes and we tell him we have 4 separate credit cards due to our expense accounts, lol, he says no problem. With all that (and they were big 20oz ribeyes), the checks come to about $70 each after tax! We were all appreciative of the great service, freebies, not to mention the awesome meal we left about a 25-30 % tip. Just a great dining experience evening.

We also had the double baked potato and broccoli. I would suggest not adding cheese to the broccoli (my husband ALWAYS does) because it became cold quickly. All of the sides were good. Then for desert, they sang (more like yelled) for him and gave him the BIGGEST slice of macadamia turtle pie! It should be against the law.

After which our server, Paco (probably the best server I have ever had) explained the different cuts of meats to us. From bone-in steaks to lobster.  We finally decided on a pepper-crusted Fillet Mignon and a New York Sirloin with mashed potatoes. I am not a big mashed potatoes fan but they were exquisite. I didn't have the gravy (not a fan) so I cannot comment on that. What I can comment on, however, are the fillet and sirloin... which were prepared to perfection. Juicy and extremely flavorful.

For starters, the experience did not start out great.  Our table was not ready when we arrived for our reservation and we ended up in an overly cramped bar area fighting to get a glass of wine.  It was hardly enjoyable since we kept getting bumped into by old men and women in fur coats, but we kept our eye on the meaty prize.  We were seated 30 minutes after our reservation (on a Wednesday no less!) and placed in an awkwardly inconvenient table in front of a door in the sunroom side (or whatever area they call it).  At least I had a slight buzz. Our waiter came by with complimentary bread and a tray full of their available steaks.  I had already had my heart set on the filet mignon, and we both opted for the 14 ounce instead of the 10 ounce (for $8 more, completely worth it).  Each steak came with a house salad or a soup, and we ordered the twice baked potato to split.  A bottle of red wine was to be split, too.  55/45, though, since I savor mine a lil bit more ;) The salad came out quickly.  It was small, but filling, and had some of the most amazing dressing I have ever had.  It had some kick, too.  Peppers?  Seasonings?  I don't know.  Whatever it was... YUM. The steaks and potato quickly followed.  My steak was deceivingly large and, although I requested medium, came out more on the medium rare side.  I consider it a blessing since it was one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had. So good, in fact, that I ate a 14 ounce filet mignon.  Myself.  As someone who weighs 2,448 ounces, that's approximately .6% of my body weight.  That's a lot, people. And that baked potato?  Well, even when the waiter split it, it was about the size of my thigh and I knew I had to devour it.  Piping hot cheesy potato-y goodness, you were conquered. Don't let the skinny frame fool you, I'm a chubbo at heart. The bill?  Not bad.  Actually, considering what was ordered, Gibsons is less expensive than other competitor restaurants in the area, and I would go as far as saying it is in my top 2 steakhouses overall.   Gibsons.  An institution.  A home of meaty goodness.  You win forever.  I wuv u.",0.9919,0.811,0.138,0.05,0.5085416666666667

They brought out samples of all the meat that they served so you could see the product and see the different sizes that were available. The waiter was also able to answer all the questions we had about the different meats. Very impressive.  Started with a salad and chicken noodle soup. Salad was standard but the soup was super tasty. My bf ate most of it bc he was in heaven. From just a couple spoonfuls I could already tell it was delicious. That's when you know you're in for something good..if they can nail a simple soup like chicken noodle. For my entree I had the porterhouse with the garlic mash and mushrooms w/ spinach. EVERYTHING was on point and met all my expectations. The mash potatoes were absolutely divine. I dream about their buttery goodness. The porterhouse was cooked to perfection. A little char on the outside but juicy and succulent on the inside. It melted in your mouth. And for dessert: ice cream sundae. This was by far the BEST ice cream sundae I've ever had and my bf agreed. We don't know what it was about it but it was absolutely perfect in every way. Just the right amount of vanilla bean, chocolate and crunch. If I could have that everyday I would.  The next time I'm in Chicago I would love to come back to Gibsons.

2012-11-20,4.0,"This place is iconic (even if it is a chain now). I first came here when I was 14 and its charm hasn't faded away in those 8 years. I've never come here without a reservation and I don't advise it either unless you call ahead and check the wait times or want to be acquainted with the bartender over an hour or two. The tables are pretty close together and many of the patrons are dressed to the nine, or at least aren't wearing jeans.  Just about everything here is a la carte and done in courses. To start, go with any salad on the menu and any seafood bisque that they have. Trust me, it'll be awesome just don't think about the calories. I normally get the surf and turf when I come here, the money is already being spent and I might as well spend it right. I always go with a rare steak. Yes, I like it bloody and cool in the center. The servers always look at me funny when I ask for a rare steak but hey, they can keep on looking. The lobster is always tender, just order the regular one. The large Australian ones don't taste as good and they cost a lot more. As far as sides go, any sauteed vegetables are good bets as well as the mashed potatoes. If I'm really going for the gusto, I'll get the baked potato (one is enough to share at least two ways!). For dessert, you can't go wrong with any option at all. I'm partial to anything chocolate so I normally go right in for the kill and order chocolate cake. The drinks here are also quite strong and wonderful. They really know how to take care of a gal here. The service is always attentive and on the spot. Wait times for food can be a little ridiculous but hey, they're perfecting my order.

Round two was more successful, the cocktail that consists of exactly one ingredient was perfectly acceptable.   I asked to settle my tab and wasn't sure if I was heard as there was never any eye contact or other attempt to offer the basics of service, he was more interested in chatting and sharing stories with a group of locals.  After about 10-15 minutes of a continued lack of acknowledgement, I again asked for my tab.   This time, I get a response. Here is the verbatim quote:  ""I heard you the first time, is it okay with you if I finish making these drinks first?"" (marinated with sarcasm).  Wow. This is the worst service experience I've ever encountered in a fine dining restaurant. I don't recall the gentleman's name, grey hair, heavyset, mid to late 50s.

When their food came, it looked and smelled delicious.  As they ate theirs, they moaned and complained about how expensive it was for what they ended up getting and how it didn't compare to any Texas steak.  We were offended by how rude they were, so we ended up ditching them after on beer.  So when we learned of this shared kitchen, my buddy and I were a little worried.   When the server brought over the raw meat selection and the lobster tail to show us, it was a carnivores dream.  It looked so fresh and well marbled.  The lobster tail, which I was informed was on the medium to larger size, but they had much bigger in the past, looked as if they had removed the tail of a dolphin or mermaid.  I even took a picture of it, that it was so ridiculously huge.  We both ordered the WR Chicago cut steak & his relative ordered the lobster (petite size which was what I would call a medium to large sized tail in my experience).  We split fries for the table.  They got the salad and I got the white fish soup/stew (it had a famous name to it because it came from a famous restaurant in Philadelphia (but I cannot remember or find the name online). For dessert we ordered the Macadamia turtle pie to split.   The soup was delicious and their salads looked extremely fresh.  The steaks were amazing, one of the best I have ever had.  Her lobster tail looked so great, she said it was delicious.  The turtle pie was huge, we split it three ways, and it was so good!  I love ice creams cakes and this was basically ice cream, pie crust, Macadamia nuts, & chocolate and caramel sauce.   Gibsons is a must eat spot for anyone visiting near the Magnificent Mile in Chicago.

A great wine list with very reasonable prices for a high end restaurant.  You can also bring your wine, which is what I generally do and a corkage fee of $15.  You can't find that at most high end restaurants.   Speaking of desert - the turtle pie macadamia nut ice cream slice is enough to feed 6 - 8 alone.  WOW is it good!  Just order it regardless of how full you are.  You will end up eating it as once you start you can't put your spoon down!",0.9982,0.758,0.212,0.03,0.6017691798941799

2012-08-17,4.0,"I dined here last night with a friend & her 5 male coworkers. It was my first time getting the full Gibson's experience besides a few networking events & bar visits at their Rosemont location. We had an 8:30 reservation & of course, we weren't seated until closer to 9:30. That's all part of the experience when dining at Gibson's so it didn't bother me. We went in the lounge & had some drinks which is exactly what they want you to do. We were seated at a spacious table in the dining room & ordered a few apps. I'm not a big fan of oysters but I'll try them every single time in hopes of finding that I actually do like them. The oysters last night may have done the trick- they were delicious! The crabmeat avocado was great as well. I didn't try the tomato goat cheese but it looked great! My friend & I split the 10oz filet and with all the sides ordered, the 1/2 portion was more than enough for me. The sides I tried were the hash brown potatoes, mushrooms, and asparagus with hollandaise. Each one was delicious! I'm kind of ashamed to say that this was my second dinner of the evening (after a HORRIBLE meal at Porkchop in the West Loop- see that review for more info, haha) but when you're at Gibson's, you have to eat... especially if someone else is paying =) The service is excellent as well! The staff knows how to customize the experience for each table. We were a rowdy group so the staff had some fun with us but I'd see the same set of servers at a more subdued table & their demeanor was completely different. I think adapting to your customers is the secret of great service! When my friend sitting to my left spilled her red wine in my direction, the staff was quick to respond with fresh napkins. When her coworker sitting to my right spilled an entire glass of water in my direction, again, the staff saved the day & cleaned up the mess. They didn't seem annoyed or put off by these accidents as I'm sure they have to deal with a lot worse on a daily basis.  Gibson's really does cover all the bases & dining there can be enjoyable for just about any type of client (families, businessmen, couples on a first date, sugar daddies, cougars, etc...).

We addressed the issue with our waiter who proceeded to second guess us by asking us to cut the steaks in half and igniting a lighter while asking us to what degree we thought the steaks were over cooked after we had already told them that they were charred.  A manager brought two steaks back that were blue in the middle meaning as rare as a restaurant can legally serve meat without breaking health code. We sent the steaks back once again and upon return received steaks the were charred to an-uneatable crisp with a very cold blue 1/4 inch center.

On my last visit, Gibsons had it all. What a pleasant evening. This old style Chicago steakhouse has yet to disappoint me. Better yet, it has each of the three times I've been there met my expectations -- which, by the way, we're pretty high.  You know ... Chicago ... steaks.  So, yes, my expectations were high. I arrived on time on a Saturday night with my girlfriend and another couple, having made reservations a week earlier.  We were promptly seated, despite there being a fair crowd awaiting tables.  The server couldn't have been more perfect: friendly (but not too friendly), knowledgeable, attentive (but not too attentive) and helpful. Bad wait staff can ruin an otherwise wonderful dining experience. He enhanced it.  But let's get to the food. Before I go into what I had, though, I have to offer a touch of ""USA"" -- unsolicited advice. Go hungry.  The servings are massively large; and if you order and eat everything from soup to, er, creme brûlée, the last thing you'll order is a wheelbarrow so they can wheel you out of there. I really enjoy good bleu cheese, and started with the Loaded Wedge. One really can't screw up a wedge, so I don't have much to say other than what I ate of it was really good.  (Remember, I had to save myself.) Then the waiter brought out the tray that showcased each cut of meat. When in Rome, right? ... I selected W.R.'s Chicago Cut.  Twenty-two ounces of medium rare heaven.  My guests and I ordered three sides to share; the creamed spinach, mushrooms and the not-to-be-missed (really - don't miss it) double baked potato.  My USDA Gibsons Prime Angus Chicago Cut came out perfectly prepared. Really, perfectly. Couldn't have been better. The creamed spinach was very tasty. Not to thick, not too runny. The mushrooms were nicely done. And then there was the double baked potato. The double baked potato was bigger than my size 11 shoe! OMG, a meal in itself.  And it was very, very good. Please, share it with at least two other people or call for the aforementioned wheelbarrow. Dessert is unnecessary at Gibsons only because so much food precedes it. But, at Gibsons, the dessert IS necessary if you get the Macadamia Turtle Pie.  Another OMG experience that you have to share -- this time with three other people because it is so large. We four had good, fun conversation, and the enjoyable company topped off this five-star dining experience.  There are a lot of excellent steakhouses in Chicago. This is one.

2012-05-03,4.0,"I'm slowly scratching major Chicago steakhouses off of my 'to try' list.  Last night we tackled this biggie while celebrating a birthday.  Honestly, it wasn't my fave in the steakhouse category - the original Morton's holds that title - due to a much more calm, classy atmosphere.  [ As soon as we stepped inside, the term 'viagra triangle' kept popping in my head - as many older, well-to-do-looking men were swarming to and fro in packs ]  This place definitely had more of a touristy, bustling vibe.   Not necessarily a good thing, but it did have energy - and a hell of a lot of celebrity photos adorning the walls, if that tells you anything.  BTW, we had our own celebrity sighting too, which was very exciting... (movie director + actor) Reservations were placed well over a month in advance and times at that point were tight, so we got in at 6pm on a weeknight.  We ordered a bottle of red, and enjoyed the comp table bread (3 kinds) while looking at the menu.  The man ordered a big ol' steak and a big ol' baked potato.  I ordered the planked whitefish with mashed potato and tomato/onion.  Entrees also included soup or salad - we both got the beef barley soup (pretty good, but salty).  The food was good - not outstanding.  I enjoyed my fish, but it was on the boring side.  Serving size was huge - for the fish and taters - which I appreciated, but I would have loved an accompanying sauce or more color/flavor.  It did come with a nice dill tartar sauce, but that gets a little heavy...  A solid ""good"" report on the steak and baked potato from the man.   We were too stuffed for dessert - especially here, where their desserts are literally the equivalent of an entire pie or small/medium sized cake.  I saw more than one waiter walking away with a dead dessert that had only a tiny fraction eaten off of it.  What a sad waste.....  The birthday boy did get a surprise group of staff huddled around him for some kind of birthday chant and a martini glass of ice cream with a candle.  Nice and festive. Gibsons was an experience.  Partly because of its big name in Chicago.  Party because of the celebrity aspect (seeing all the pics/history and seeing actual celebrities).  It's one of those places that I've been to, but don't really feel the need to go back to - unless I want to try and pick up a sugar daddy and/or I have a SERIOUS craving for a big ass piece of cake.",0.9843,0.779,0.151,0.07,0.5505265567765568

The 2 who had the new york and filet loved their meat and it was cooked exactly how they asked. My friend who had the Chicago cut asked for medium and it was pretty cooked. The baked potato and steamed broccoli were great.  We also had the shrimp cocktail which was fantastic. Their cocktail sauce has tons of flavor with fresh horseradish. We tried 2 desserts: carrot cake and lemon meringue pie; both atrociously huge. The carrot cake was good but a little dry. The lemon meringue could have been better.

Per the suggestion of you lovely Yelpers, I also ordered the double baked potato. AMAZING. It tasted like a baked potato but with a mashed potato consistency. It was cheesy and perfectly seasoned. I will dream about that potato for the rest of my life. The portion is huge, though- it was able to feed the three of us with a lot left over.

Luckily there was no wait around 12 pm on a Saturday as the crowds trickle in later. The service overall was amazing as the wait staff was lined up at the door greeting guest as they entered. As soon as we were seated, two glasses of water and bread basket appeared. I ordered the ""Prime Rib French Dip"" sandwich and somehow my waiter heard ""The King of All Sandwiches"" USDA Gibsons Prime Angus Ribeye Sandwich. I would be okay with this if it was for dinner, but for lunch this was way too much meat and cost 1.5x more than my original order. I didn't realize this until my order arrived. Unfortunately I didn't want to create a ruckus so I just took on the sandwich. This would be amazing at dinner time with thick slices of prime rib cooked medium rare with sauteed spinach and blue cheese dressing. The shoe string fries I would avoid, super crunchy and over cooked. My wife's lunch was significantly better and lighter with a crab cake with spicy mayo. Giant lumps of crab cake with minimal fillers. Overall food was great, service was good except for the order mess up...

The service was good, but nothing that made me feel warm and fuzzy inside.  The martinis were great and came out quickly.  I would have loved a beer with my steak, but they had nothing on draft!  I know this is more of a wine / cocktail joint, but a couple solid draft beers would be great. Now to the steaks.  For $50, I want something that is 5X better than the $10 steak I can get at Applebee's.  This was a good steak, but it was lacking and flavor and was a bit dry.  My wife got her steak with the peppercorn and you could only taste the peppercorn (they cake it on like crazy).  This was not the amazing, buttery, tender, and flavorful steak I dreamed about the night before (and believe me I'm not a steak snob).   I would consider some of Gibson's competitors first, but this is an A-OK steakhouse if you're in the neighborhood.",0.9864,0.792,0.179,0.029,0.5957407407407408

As soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by the hostess and led to a nice big booth.  The walls leading up to the upstairs area are adorned with all the countless celebs, and athletes that have dined here.  Our waitress was exceptional, as she described the different cuts of steak, and recommended the W.R.'s Chicago for me.   I ordered it medium, with a glass of J Lohr Cab Sauv.  I also ordered garlic mashed potato and she warned me that it was big enough to feed a small village.  I have been to some good steakhouses, and I was eager to compare how the steak here would stack up. The steak finally came and she had me cut it to see if it was to my liking.  It was more on the red side than I usually like, but she promised that it would taste better that way.  She was absolutely correct!!! The steak was OMFG delicious...I think I had a meatgasm.  That was easily one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life, and it was paired with a nice red wine=perfection. The night was on the slow side (it was the Monday after the Superbowl). She comped us our dessert, and we decided on the Hot Fudge Sundae.  The combination of the great service, and exquisite steak equals a 5 star review.

So after a long wait for a reservation, we finally made it to the famed Gibsons.  First let me say the service was first class, and Greg and Jeremy made up for a series of memorable weird food incidents.     The Dwarf Oyster Caper My husband ordered a plate of raw oysters as an appetizer.  It came with a dwarf oyster.  It was so small, it probably wasn't legal to harvest, let alone serve to a diner.  When we pointed it out, Jeremy very quickly proclaimed he would bring us two to make up for the dwarf.  Problem Solved!  But really?  They should have known better.  Bet they wouldn't have served it to Mayor Daley.   Tough Cows and Cold Potatoes So we both ordered filets.  My husband complained (after I left the room) about his. They comped his.  But after we got home, he told me about his filet, and I then told him that mine wasn't that good either. (I only ate half-but didn't complain) On top of this, we shared a cold potato.  It was shivering.  In fact, the butter didn't even melt when placed on it.  (We didn't mention this either).  Its about the Food Stupid So I am thinking Gibson's is losing its shine.  I didn't go there thinking we would have issues with the food.  Its sad-because I really wanted a great experience.  I was on their side!   They blew it.   On a positive note, the service couldn't have been better, more attentive, or helpful when we pointed out errors-but really-there shouldn't have been errors in the first place.",0.7472,0.836,0.086,0.078,0.5835830835830834

With all the glowing compliments of this place, I was truly looking forward to a great piece of meat. Once you're seated, your waiter will come around with a plate of the different cuts of steak. You can see and ask questions as you like and I agree that seeing the different cuts was great. Here's what we ordered: -W.R.'s Chicago cut ($45.75) -Filet, 10 oz ($35.75) -double baked potato ($8.25) -vegetable combination ($11.25) You also get your choice of soup or salad with an entree so we tried the gumbo soup as well as house salad...both alright. I don't know if I had hyped this place too much for myself, but I did not enjoy my filet at all. Don't get me wrong, it was cooked exactly how I specified and the cut was USDA (for goodness sakes!), but I was unimpressed with it and didn't even finish it! The double baked potato was delicious and I would recommend it! The vegetable combination had 4 different veggies and was too large of a portion for us to finish. Service was great and the portions were generous, but I walked away not satisfied at all with my meat or dinner. 3 stars because the inner wasn't horrible...just didn't live up to what I was expecting.",0.9799,0.767,0.165,0.068,0.5298280423280423

2011-12-20,5.0,"I'll just go out and say it; Gibsons is my favorite steakhouse. Period. Don't get me wrong, Gibsons is very much a standard higher-end steakhouse. The menus for these types of places are largely comparable and extremely similar. I wouldn't say that there's all too much that's unique about this place, with the exception of the quality of the meat. But although the menu and ambiance is 100% steakhouse, it's truly a cut above its competitors making it a wholly unique experience. FOOD: USDA Prime Angus beef! Given that I wasn't completely famished, I did something rational and logical; I ordered the smallest cut on the menu, a 10oz filet. Of course, 10oz steaks are nothing to scoff at, but compared to the monster 32oz+ prime rib that one of my friends got, the filet was tiny. I ordered mine rare and a friend ordered hers ""Pittsburgh"" style (rarer than rare), and both were cooked perfectly. We did have a mixup at the table where we received each other's steaks, but a quick switcharoo solved this. Our other friend got the Chicago Cut, which is a 22oz bone-in ribeye, which he only raved about. I normally get the ribeye, but I felt like a filet this time around, but I was able to try the different steaks. I do have to say, the ridiculous prime rib was my favorite and the one I'll have to get next time. Overall, meat was fantastic. Our normally talkative group fell silent as we marveled at how great these steaks really were. Then we began to verbally express our happiness with our perfectly cooked steaks with a nice char. To those that are purists, Gibsons doesn't seem to really season the beef too much; the chefs let the high-quality beef speak for itself. And I thank them for that! For sides, we ordered the gigantic twice-baked potato and spinach with mushrooms. Both were fantastic choices. The potato was creamy and didn't feel dense and the cheddar cheese was definitely higher quality than what you normally see. The spinach was light and cooked quickly to avoid the wilting that often accompanies spinach dishes. Dessert: we were graciously comp'd the Jerry's Cherry Pie and we decided to try the Turtle Macadamia Nut Pie. My favorite of the two was the cherry, with a nice crust and delicious cherry filling. This was served a la mode with an amazing vanilla ice cream. The Turtle Pie was essentially 10+ inches of ice cream, surrounded by a unique crust, chocolate, caramel, and of course macadamias. Our server was explaining the crust and the two(?) types of ice cream, but we were all too busy marveling at the size of the thing. None of us could recall what she told us and we were too busy eating.  To be honest, given everything we ate, I can understand why Chicago remains fairly close to winning the crown for fattest city every year. With places like Gibsons, you just can't stop eating, no matter how many STOP! signals your brain and overstuffed stomach send you.  SERVICE: Excellent. Extremely friendly, and eager to talk about the various cuts and cooking techniques used. The servers weren't afraid to run back into the kitchen to verify the answers to some of our questions, which I truly appreciated. VALUE/OVERALL: At first glance, Gibsons might seem to be a bit on the pricey end. Of course, once you understand that the place has its own beef designation of USDA Prime Angus, you start to realize that not only is it not really too expensive, but it's actually quite the value. Other places might have the same cuts for cheaper, but when you really look at the menu and realize what you're getting, Gibsons stands as one of the best steakhouses for your money.  I used to be a consultant and had the good fortune of both traveling and eating at some of the best restaurants different cities have had to offer. And when it comes to steakhouses, Gibsons really takes the crown. This is my new go-to steakhouse when I really want to throw down, and I recommend everyone to give this place a shot if you're looking for a first-class steak dinner.",0.9993,0.777,0.196,0.026,0.5576360408597253

While such an admission may give you reason to think twice about trusting my restaurant reviews, I needed to come clean so I don't sound anti-sandwich.  As it turns out, one of Gibson's newer menu items, The King Of All Sandwiches, was apparently conceived of by none other than the winner of last season's Next Food Network Star and Sandwich King Of Chicago himself, Jeff Mauro. At $24, this sandwich is a definite no go. Ribeye, sauteed spinach and blue cheese dressing combine to make a fairly lackluster creation. Give me some gruyere or lardons (got a hard on for lardons), or something to give this sandwich some richness that plays well with the toppings. All I got was a bitter aftertaste.  Still gotta give it up for Gibson's. The service is always great, and as long as you order the right thing, you probably won't be let down with your food. In my observation, those things are: 1. The French Dip (less expensive and far far tastier than the aforementioned royalty of handheld meals) 2. The Prime Rib (presentation is potentially terrifying as it looks like they had to kill multiple cows to produce a piece of meat this large, definitely puts the laughter in slaughter) 3. The New England Clam Chowder (the secret ingredient is Tom Brady's tears) 4. The Wedge Salad (so retro, antiquated slang like ""groovy"" and ""daddy-o"" enter my vernacular while consuming) Anyways, I'm sure I could come up with more to say, but you're probably done reading and there's a very special episode of Aarti Party on in like 5 minutes, so I'm gonna boogie.

The service is second to none professional career waitstaff not a kid working on the weekends. They know what you want and need and seem to be there when its needed with out hovering over the table. Our waiter was also funny friendly and knew everything about the food and options. We had a strip steak and a lobster tail our waiter served them cut to serve family style the lobster was in big chunks served in the tail it was great melt in your mouth lobster and the steak is prime aged steak as good a steak you will ever get. We tried to order a vegetable side but our waiter stopped us telling us the lobster comes with a vegetable, this is the kind of service I appreciate where they look out for you so you order what you want and need but not to excess so they can pad their tip. We also split a wedge salad they served that already split but it looked like just 2 regular salads I checked yes we where only charged for one. At the end of the meal I was stuffed they bring a bread basket out at the beginning of the meal and I am a sucker for a good bread basket so I did not have to much room for dessert.  Our waiter asked if we wanted something sweet I told him I was full and would have a Jack and coke for my dessert he would not hear of it and brought us out the biggest slice of cake I have ever seen it could of served 4 or 6 people and not only was it big it was yummy, turtle macadamia nut ice cream cake and what made it more sweet is he gave it to us complimentary. Best steak house in the city, best service and a interesting place to people watch. Lunch was post day of shopping while waiting to drop a family member at the airport. We where one of 3 tables the place was almost empty a stark contrast to the dinner where it was all action every table full but service still was perfect and we sat next to window and watched the show outside. Food was very good I had split pea soup my go to soup when I was a kid I like a little more ham flavor but it was good and served with bread basket so you can get full fast. I also ordered a burger it was tasty standard lettuce tomato onion not real thick but still juicy the fries where crisp and seasoned perfect I ate it all. The only problem was my burger sat in its own juice for a bit and bottom bun got soaked I pointed it out the waitress took care of it no problem. My wife and her brother ordered prime rib sandwich the sandwich came with a pile of fries that almost touched the ceiling and the sandwiches where huge also they both could only finish half even though the meat was juicy and flavorful and had some great toppings. If you want this you might consider splitting the sandwich is massive and its a bit expensive. My wifes brother got the blue cheese sauce for the sandwich on the side  and a note do that and dip your fries in it so good. serves was once again a highlight little things taken care of friendly and fun staff that are helpful but not intrusive.

2011-11-30,3.0,"We (three) arrived at Gibsons at 745 for our 800 reservation on a Tuesday night.  We grabbed a drink at the packed bar and were seated just after 800.  Our table was a small round 4 top jammed in a sea of tables.  It met our needs but was by no means a good table...but that was within my expectations. Our waiter arrived and was a nice fellow.  He took our cocktail orders, returned with drinks and then brought us the cuts to view.  I am a fan of viewing the raw cuts, but others not so much, as they fear food born illness. In any event, our Waiter gave us an overview of the beef and we ordered.  I ordered the porterhouse, medium rare to rare, my comrades ordered the bone in filet medium rare to rare and the WR Chicago Cut medium rare.  Note the waiter specifically asks how do you want the medium rare and going closer to rare is an option provided by the staff without special request.  We also ordered sauteed spinach & brocoli, mashed potatoes, and mushrooms plus a nice bottle of Pinot Noir. This is where it went astray.  Our food came out looking good.  But instead of spinach & brocoli we were served spinach & mushrooms.  This was okay but our waiter proceeded to take it upon himself to individually pick all of the mushrooms out and toss them on his serving platter.  Strange and kind of gross - also - we ordered a separate side of mushrooms, we would have eatten them.  Anyway.  All of the sides were above average, nothing that really stands out.   Onto the steaks.  They were like butter.  We all enjoyed the taste and flavor.  In fact I loved my taste and flavor.  Only problem, my steak came out medium.  And the medium rare WR Chicago Cut came out bloody, and not medium rare.  The filet was cooked to perfection medium rare to rare.  To be fair the waiter offered a new steak, which I declined, as I wanted to eat and to keep my friends from feeling bad.  But for the reputation of Gibsons you expect them to get this aspect of the meal perfectly.  Here they missed. In the end the bill came and they charged us for for the mushrooms and spinach.  We thought this was humorous as the mushrooms and spinach are a bit more than the spinach & brocoli.  Also, if we paid for the mushrooms, we wanted to eat them!  We busted our waiter's chops a bit on this issue over cappuchino's and he comped the spinach. All in, everything was good but not great.  If men are going to throw down for manly steaks, getting 1 out of 3 steak temperatures correct just doesn't cut it.",0.9318,0.774,0.126,0.101,0.6614666986760008

2011-11-26,3.0,"I have to be honest that after eating in a lot of very nice steak restaurants, Gibson's was above average but not as good as The Palm or Gene and Georgetti.  The ambiance was lovely, but there's no such thing as a sublime, peaceful evening here.  This isn't a romantic restaurant in which to pop the question; it's a place for ""men of a certain age"" and their pals to celebrate that certain deal.  It's also a place for mom and dad to take their large extended families during holiday season as judged by the number of big groups squeezed together throughout the main dining room.  This place is a chain, and they try hard to make you believe you're in an old fashioned steakhouse...but you're really not.  Any more cigarettes and cigars for sale at the coat check counter, and you'll swear you're eating in a supper club back in 1970. Once we were seated in a packed room at what must have been the worst table location available, our server got to work by showing us a large platter of raw cow muscle--nevermind that we might have wanted something from their seafood menu.  This place is all about steaks, so just gaze at all that raw muscle and sinew and hope your waiter washes their hands afterward.  A few minutes into our first course, we were fed up with our seating location and asked if we could simply move to one of the nearby empty tables.  Nope--unavailable.  OK, fair enough. My seafood gumbo was good, but my companion's dinner salad was bland and forgettable; a mix of basic lettuce, cherry tomatoes and...well, I forgot the other ingredient.  Probably something like red onion slices.  Places like this still haven't ventured much beyond traditional iceberg lettuce side salads.  They also haven't realized that Coke served in little 6 oz. bottles is not cute...it's cheesy and cheap.  The only other places that serve Coke in a can or bottle are cheap Chinese restaurants with names like, ""Mao's Mongolian"" or ""The Emperor's Wok."" My 14 oz. fillet mignon was hands down the best I've ever had...until I realized halfway through that they hadn't cooked it to my exact specifications--that happens at chains that turn tables fast, and I didn't want to slow my dining companions down by sending it back for another turn in the microwave.  We had our choice to share a large baked potato or twice backed potato.  Trust me: get the twice-baked potato.  It would have been twice better than the baked potato we were served.  You know you are really in Chicago in the 70s if a restaurant can't think of anything more creative than a potato, sour cream and chives to serve as a side.  They have other sides available, but only the potato is served as an included complement with steak dinners. My dinner companion's sourpuss expression and negative comments about our lousy seating location to our server got us, ""How are you doing...can I get you anything?"" from both the Maître D' and a manager.  It also net us a very nice desert treat at the end which was the second best part of the dinner after the incredible steak.  That was really nice.  Our server was nice.  She told us she washed her hands after handling the platter of dead meat.",0.9954,0.787,0.15,0.063,0.4739027715055111

We had a variety of items at our table of four.  Although the bill came to about $100/person, it was worth it.  Sure I didn't pay a dime for this business meal, but would my otherwise very frugal dining sense still feel comfortable dropping a bill per person?  Yes. The Chicago Cut is all that!  The prime rib is the same cut of meat; it's just broiled instead of grilled -- stick to the Chicago Cut.  Drinks are strong.  The side of spinach was bland.  Double baked potato was good and HUGE.  As a matter of fact, everything is huge: portions and the staff -- those are some big dudes serving!  And the desserts perfectly round out the meal.  Our one slice of chocolate cake fed four and the leftover continued to feed me everyday for two weeks! Whether you're a tourist or a local, Gibson's has the true Chicago feel.  As a proud Chicagoan, I'd be happy to recommend this restaurant to anyone.  And according to the rest of my restaurant ratings, that isn't all too common of me.  Save your cash stash and go for a special night out.

Upon my protocol food research before my trip, I liked what I read, and so I firmly bookmarked it on my to do list.  Gibson's has a classic yet casual ambience. A pleasant departure from the sleek modern restaurants you so often find in big cities. It's nice to first start off at the bar and then work your way to the dining area after a drink or two. I had a yummy chocolate martini while waiting to be seated at our table. It's very strong; I reckon it put hair on my chest. It's also sweet, but not too sweet, so it's not necessarily a dessert drink.  For dinner I ordered the 22 oz. W.R.'s Chicago Cut. It was very juicy and cooked perfectly to my specification (medium). For my sides I stuck to starch overload--Baked sweet potato and french fries. Both were very good.  Ordering dessert at Gibson's is a must--even if you're at the limit of fulness in which you cannot fathom having another bite of anything. It's the most fun part of any meal here! All desserts are of behemoth proportions and can probably feed a small Third World country. We went with the classic Macadamia Turtle Pie. It's mostly a big hunk of vanilla ice cream doused in chocolate sauce, a bit of caramel, and macadamia nuts. The five of us barely made a dent in it, but it was still a satisfying fete.

Very juicy, exactly the way I wanted it, and tender...The BEST steak I have ever eaten. My husband got their prime rib, but it was only ok. It was kind of tough and fatty in some areas. Also, it could have been seasoned a little more than it was. Overall, we thought the meat was really good. When it came to the dessert, omg, we were so surprised when we saw how BIG it was. We got the 7 or 8 layer chocolate cake. The one slice was able to feed the four of us and was almost the size of a small cake. We had left overs for almost a week haha. Our waiter was awesome too! If you are able to sit in Paco's area, do it! He was cool and really funny. He also knew everything there was to know about the place. He was able to offer wonderful advice.

The service here is great as well.  They bring the cuts to your table to look at and help make your decision.  They are very attentive and the water was constantly being refilled as well as the other drinks.  I left a big tip for the waiter because of how attentive he was.  All in all I would recommend this place to anyone; whether a native Chicagoan or someone in for a visit.",0.9975,0.793,0.184,0.022,0.5311147186147186

Gibson's along with the other Viagra Triangle area restaurants gets slammed especially for dinner with businessmen during the week and locals and tourists on weekends so make a reservation. Gibsons is the classic Italian steakhouse with live piano in the bar, old school servers in jackets and all the steakhouse menu selections. The walls are lined with autographed pics of celebs and politicians, several Presidents have held dinners there and its got palm trees and ceiling fans going year round. For steaks its the bone-in ribeye hands down for flavor, the filet for tenderness or the pork chops for somthing different. If you want fish either go to Hugo's next door which is by the same owners and actually shares the kitchen or ask if you can order off the Hugo's menu. Side dishes are Flintstones huge such as the baked potato that looks like a football so plan on sharing them. You are not there for the side dishes and the side dishes are not the stars the steaks are and their steaks are some of the best.

Service was fantastic! You honestly couldn't ask for a more friendly and attentive staff. The food was delicious too. There were a few passing hors d'œuvre, but dinner was where the magic happen. We started off with a very light lobster bisque. For our main entree we had a choice of a few things...I decided on the spicy pork chop (medium) and my boyfriend went with the sirloin (medium rare). That way we could share and enjoy both. Both were cooked perfectly. The sides were an incredible spinach (lightly sauteed with a hint of garlic) and a crawfish mac & cheese. We then ended the evening with family style strawberry shortcake and the most enormous turtle ice cream dessert I've ever seen. Loved it all.  Now since we were there for a private party...price did not come into play here. With that being said...I have no idea how much my meal would have cost, but I was very happy with how it tasted.

Nonetheless, Gibson's is not really my kind of place in general as it has a chain vibe and many of the patrons seem like megalomaniacs or gold diggers.  Came here on a Saturday night around 9pm and it was packed, which is to be expected. Unfortunately, many of the people in the bar area were a little too drunk and were basically elbowing everyone and awkwardly hanging over the tables in the area.

I enjoy seeing all the cuts of meat and the giant deserts (which I unfortunately did not get to try). As for actual taste though, for an appetizer we had the crab dip which was delicious -- but our entrees were just so-so. The two people who ordered steak mentioned they found theirs tough to eat despite being cooked medium rare.  I had the broiled salmon which was somewhat typical fare for a steak house. The fish was tender but the flavor was nothing to write home about.

Initial observation was that the scene didn't reflect as many older man/younger trophy combos that I'd read so much about.  This was slightly disappointing as observing socially objectionable behavior is never not enjoyable.  Instead, I witnessed more business and even multiple family dinners (we were there on a Tuesday night.)  Overall it was a pretty comfortable and upbeat vibe which is in contrast to the stuffy and slow steakhouse experiences we've all been accustomed to.   Our waiter was hard working and knew his stuff.  But he had an ""apprentice"" following him around who couldn't seem to get anything right.  Ya fired (virtual hand gesture included.)   I'm not going to spend much time on the steaks because they're darn good, as you would expect.  Let's just say I was more than pleased, as was the steakhouse owner, with our steaks.   If you don't get anything else, you MUST have the baked potato with melted cheese.  Holy momma this thing was worth the price of admission alone.  You could even be ""that guy"" and order the chicken breast sandwich at a steakhouse and totally redeem yourself if you were well-informed enough to get the baked potato w/melted cheese.

The 24 oz. porterhouse I got was on par with the $50 price point.  Succulent, good marbling and a nice char.  However, I had a bite of the Chicago cut prime rib on the bone and I should have went with that instead - tender and juicy.  That seemed to be the marque plate.  Servers were at full attention.

I got the Chicago cut steak (fattier than the filet) that came blackened that was a very good medium rare. Last time I had a blackened steak was in New Orleans at K. Paul's. Both are equally good. The reason why I was impressed, was the price for the size of the steak. The Chicago cut i think was about 20 oz. for about $50 and my friend's 16 oz. filet (blackened and bone in) was $56. Those sizes for that price compared to LA is GREAT! So immediately I was in awe.  The steaks were awesome and the sides were good as well. Double baked potatoes had superb flavor and the garlic sauteed spinach and mushrooms were well done! GREAT WINE LIST. For desert, I had their Macadamia turtle pie ($16). Vanilla ice cream topped with macadamia and chocolate. The best part, other than the size (serves 6), was the crust. The crust was dense, but when you bite into it, it crumbles so easily.

But since when does having pictures of celebrities smackedagainst the walls count as ""good taste""? Walking into this joint, is like walking into a wanna be steakhouse.  It's dressed like a steakhouse, it's got meat juice in the air, baked potatoes on the menu, and bad checkering in areas...but it's not really a steakhouse.   Sortuv like the clientele: a blend of surgeon kissed senior citizens trying way too hard to dress and act younger - -  but they aren't really 40 years old.  The only other clientele this place gets...are trendy young people enjoying the viagra triangle...and cheesy businessmen, that haven't figured out Gibson's is a cliche - -  like their attempt to talk business in the viagra triangle.   Gibson's Steakhouse...is really the ""triangle's"" attempt at ""drawing men who think you can still smoke cigars inside, and girls who know men like meat"". (of all ages). And the wait...well with or without reservations be prepared you might have to wait...if you are young, you could be there until you're old enough to need hip surgery ---- which actually would help you fit in with the older gents: you know the ones who are slicking their hair and looking for the younger bait...so they have a reason to backslap the guy next to them.  And let's not forget, this is infamous for ""sophisticated call girls"" to meet  ""cheesy business men"".

Any good steak place...dry ages their steaks.  Ask.  They don't. I believe at BEST they ""wet age"" - literally soak it in water to hydrate in some flavor.  Not good! I'm a steak snob...so I admit, this might be brutal. The only places currently doing ""dry aged steaks"" in Chicago...David Burkes, and Capital Grille. (and maybe one of the two Morton's) In addition to this, they don't specialize in good quality ingredients, they don't bother to hire quality chefs, and frankly the celebrity black and whites on the wall aren't selling me either.

I just think it offers the best combination of these qualities I look for as a diner.  The portions are absolutely enormous....the double baked potato is seriously the size of a small football and is plenty for 3-4 people to share.  All the beef (I've had the filet/porterhouse/strip) is aged for weeks, cooked to perfection, and just melts in your mouth when you eat it.  There is no way any diner has ever walked out of this restaurant hungry...   Sure there are other steakhouses where I believe the steak is equal in quality, but I've never had a steak anywhere including Peter Luger's that's better than Gibsons.  Personally if I'm going to spend $75-100 on myself for a steak dinner, I want to know that its going to be a great experience and I've never had a bad one here the few times I've gone.  They go out of their way to make sure you happy with your experience and that's the reason I'll continue to go back.",0.9891,0.815,0.173,0.012,0.49177350427350436

As a girl who lives for a juicy, glorious, perfectly medium-rare steak, I know pretty much every spot in our city for where to find the absolute best in meaty, pink, tender perfection. For some reason, while I've never knocked Gibson's, it has always never quite made the short list of winners either... until now.  Came back after a many years long hiatus for one reason and one reason alone: to find older men.  I know what you're thinking, but the manhunt 'twas not for me, no Sir! It was for a special, drop dead gorgeous, single, more mature lady who has oft been wondering aloud where all the sophisticated older gentleman in Chicago are hiding. Well, at Gibson's, duh! If memory serves me right (and it did), this restaurant and its surrounds have always been a playground for those in their prime. Bring on the dudeapalooza!  While the male selection was a bit more of the gold chain variety than the Brosnan/Connery types - wah, wah, wahhhhh - one thing could certainly not go without a huge vote of confidence from both my DC and I... the truly stellar food!  We had:  - Silver Oak '05 Cabernet Sauvignon  - House-cured Salmon Appetizer  - Loaded Wedge Salad with Bacon, Tomato & Blue Cheese  - Bone-In Filet Mignon  - Sautéed Spinach and Mushrooms with Garlic  Wowzers! It was delicious... all of it. Not one misstep, nothing that went unfinished, very respectable wine offerings, and then, of course, the sheer luxury of that beautiful bone-in filet. Big enough to share, but why would you want to? A steak this perfectly cooked and seasoned, tender enough to cut with your fork, charred on the outside but glistening pink on the inside, this is the time to get greedy. And boy did we!

Our server was great, he challenged us with some sport trivia early on (baseball) and we failed miserable which pissed me off.

But there are plenty of good steak houses in Chicago, and if you're not a celeb, you may be disappointed at Gibby's.  Regulars get treated great, but if they don't know you, don't be surprised if you wait 30+ minutes to be seated despite your reservation.  And more than likely you'll be squeezed into a space  where the tables are uncomfortably close together.  I've had great steaks here, but the last few times they were surprisingly overcooked (more like medium than my med rare order).  I say surprisingly because they tend to undercook-- a Gibson's medium rare is like a rare at most places.  The quality of the meat is excellent, but there are only a few top meat purveyors in the city and I'd bet that you can get the same steaks at other places. You can get as good or better food in a much more comfortable setting at Chicago Cut, or David Burke, or The Chop House to name a few.",0.9908,0.751,0.207,0.043,0.597907647907648

Because we were crammed, each time a server filled a glass or placed a glass or plate (and thus retrieved a plate) in front of you, you get a lot of armpit on your shoulder and to escape you must invade the personal space of the people next to you.   5. Water was not refilled in a timely manner. 6. There were three checks at the table and the server was unable to get the checks straight. 7.

2010-09-05,4.0,"One sign that I've been living in the Valley for far too long: I forgot that in a city as vibrant as Chicago, people are still out and about even though it was already close to midnight on a Sunday.   We were on our way to our 9:30PM Sunday dinner reservation at Gibson's and I was fully expecting a restaurant that was either already empty or 'in the process' of emptying out.  To my surprise Gibsons was anything but - the bar area probably was twice as crowded as 99% of restaurants in the Valley at 7PM on a Friday (sad, but it won't be long before we bust out of here), the dining room was a cacophony of clinking glasses / silverwares and hubbub from diners happily tucking into their steaks, and as far as I could see, other places in the immediate locale that were just as crowded.   The downside: we had to wait about 15 minutes for our table to be ready, despite showing up on time for our reservation.  The upside: (1) I had some time to scout the surroundings: walls were covered with a bunch of black-and-white pictures of visiting celebrities (A-list and otherwise) and the restaurant felt like it was something out of the 1920s mob scene; (2) hostess was apologetic; and (3) our table was fantastic - it was on the side of the restaurant, in the covered patio area, perfect for peoplewatching.   Our server, one of the guys dressed in butcher-style shirts, was quick to attend to our table and to show the meat sample.  He pointed out the different cuts: London broil (12oz), small bone-in sirloin (14oz), small NY sirloin (12oz), filet mignon (8oz) and *gulp* W.R Chicago cut (22oz).   We skipped the appetizers and went straight to entree - W.R. Chicago for me and the hub, London Broil and sirloin for our friends.  We also had sides of fries, delicious creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms, plus a bottle of Cab Sauv to wash it down.  The steak was tasty, it wasn't Alexander's Kobe but neither was the price (nor was I expecting it to be).  This awesome meal, that could have cost north of $80 in the Bay, ended up being $50 including tax and tip.",0.9888,0.867,0.107,0.027,0.6665343915343916

2010-09-01,5.0,"I've eaten a few times in Gibsons and think its the best steak house in Chicago. The service has always been great and the servers are very accommodating. While Chicago is packed full of steakhouses, few are in the same league as Gibsons. First off, the bread is better than any other steak house in Chicago. It might seem like a small thing but real quality restaurants look at the little details and bread is something that most places over look. Most people choose the Chicago Cut Rib Eye when they eat in Gibsons however they have a vast variety of steaks on the menu and I always try a different steak every time I go. The last time I went, I ordered the T-bone steak as I remembered it as something my mother would cook. The T-bone was so tasty and I enjoyed every bite. T-bone steak is an interesting cut of meat as it has meat from the Filet and the Sirloin so you have the best of both worlds. The salads that come with the steak look basic but are very fresh and taste better than they look. Much better than the Chop House' s salad. I've tried all the sides and they are all good, the Asparagus is my favourite. Overall a great steak restaurant however I still think Peter Lugers steak house in New York is better.",0.9924,0.794,0.185,0.021,0.4293181818181819

Here are my thoughts: 1.  Atmosphere and Location -- located in a pretty cute area of Chicago.  The night that we went in (Thursday in November), it was packed!  You could not walk through the bar at all.  Thank God, I booked reservations for dinner (highly recommended) 2.  Dining area -- well, to say that it is cramped is an understatement.  There is hardly any room to maneuver around.  I am pretty impressed that the waiter could navigate through the area.  As for the dining area itself, the tables were a bit too close.  If you are expecting a romantic dinner, please stay away from this place.  Literally, your ass is next to the next person in the next table.  You can hear every conversation that is going on... 3.  Entree -- well, before you order your meal, the waiter comes around with a tray of meat.  When I mean tray of meat.. it is raw bonafide meat.  He does a good job of going over what is what... honestly, just the sight of the meat causes you to lose your focus on what the waiter is telling you.  I had to ask him 2xs.... I chose the Porterhouse Steak cooked Med-rare (to this day, I can never understand why anyone orders a steak cooked WELL DONE -- yuck -- why don't they eat burnt wood).... Well, when the steak came out, let's say the steak was the size of my head.  It was that big.  No idea how I managed to finish it.  I should be on Man vs Food.  Anyways, honestly, despite the fact that I ate it all and the fries too, the steak was nothing special.  Like I said, because of the ""massive"" amount of steak, I found myself trying to focus on OINKING and gorging it down instead of appreciating the quality of the meat.  I was too full to consider whether it was a great meal or not.   My wife had some fish.  Apparently, she did not finish it ~ per her, it was a bit too dry and flaky.  Never order fish at a steakhouse...

The atmosphere is very good and the decor is typical steakhouse chic.  The bar is always a good place to get a drink and mingle before starting you Gibsons experience.

Gibsons is very good for steak and is near the very top on my list of Chicago steakhouses.  I can't give the place a 5-star rating because I judge steakhouses against Peter Luger's, and that'll never be trumped.  Expect to pay for what you get.  You can almost always find a Bull or Blackhawk at one of the tables after a home game, so it might be wise to pack a pen for an autograph.  Hasn't let me down yet.",0.9944,0.787,0.206,0.006,0.5108664021164022

Gibson's is keeping it old school (and delicious) with their white table linens, waiters in white jackets, piano bar, and celebrity photo lined hallways. My dad has visited me in Chicago four separate times and each time he insists on going to Gibson's. And you know what? It never disappoints.  The service is outstanding. Our waiter, Paco, was gracious enough to put up with my dad's questions: ""Hey, how can I get my picture up on the wall?"" and was super knowledgeable about the cuts of meat. In fact, one of my favorite parts is the presentation of the different cuts of beef (another dad question: ""What do you guys do with this meat at the end of the night?"").  The food is phenomenal. I went with the WR Chicago cut, which is a little fattier, but it just ups the flavor factor. The side dishes are huge and made for sharing. Whatever you do, please order the double-baked potato. It's as if angels come down from heaven and specially prepare these spudly nugget of creamy mashed deliciousness. They melt a thick layer of cheddar cheese on top to incubate the potato and make sure it stays nice and warm.  Wine list is expansive and while you think every bottle would be priced out of this world, you'd be wrong. They have bottles starting in the low 30s, which for a steakhouse, is a bargain.

It has been awhile but there are still several things that are memorable:  Atomsphere--the interior is very classy and old school. It felt more like a family-style dinning restaurant than a romantic restaurant. Even though it says here the attire is dressy, there were enough people in jeans and t-shirts. Also it could be quite loud so if you are looking for a quiet and romantic dinner, this is not the place for you.  Food--we ordered some appetizer, BUT I don't remember what exactly we had. All I could remember is how BIG my bf's steak was. I think he ordered the smaller of the two porterhouse cuts, yet it's still probably the largest cut I've seen. And my bf said it was very tender and yummy. I had the fillet, medium well (I don't like seeing pink in my food unless it's waygu), it was pretty yummy but I'm not the steak expert to say whether it's the best. We also had asparagus as side, very fresh and enough to share for two.  Dessert--Okay here's the key, their dessert is HUGE! I mean HUGE! I am a dessert person so we've never taken home any dessert, except here. We had the chocolate mousse cake, both of us together probably only finished 1/3. We boxed the remaining and I had it for breakfast and lunch the next day... Anyways, just because the quantity was big doesn't mean they lack the quality. I think their dessert was very very yummy. So if you want go somewhere to satisfy your dessert craving, Gibson's is the place for you.

This keeps white lint from sticking all over the front of my outfit and keeps me crisp and lint free. Thank you kind server! Server was informed and educated on the menu.

I of course had the lobster and Hubby had the bone-in rib eye. Lobster was perfect but Hubby's steak was overcooked. Not enough to pitch a fit about, but enough that it was worth mentioning since it was ordered medium which means slightly pink in the center and there was no pink to be seen. Server had Hubby cut through the whole thing to confirm it was overdone and then whisked it away. After that, it seemed like every person working that night came over to apologize. Seriously? It wasn't that big of a deal. It's just that Gibsons is committed to quality food and service and want to get it right 100% of the time. I think the janitor even apologized. Kidding, but you get what I'm saying. But once that perfectly-cooked steak arrived at the table....OMG. Melt-in-you-mouth-tender. Thank you experienced Chef! Mashed potatoes were ok.

That's a big difference, and the single thing you should get right as a famous steakhouse. Even my Wife's Filet Mignon which she ordered Medium was severely overcooked. Our waitress rudely suggested we had ordered them well done. I've never ordered one well done in my entire life. The managers were kind enough to see the waitresses mistake and have the steaks taken back. The steaks that were cooked correctly were absolutely phenomenal (though we thought my bro-in-law's was still overcooked a little). The sides were average, but, that's not the draw at a steakhouse.

He even autographed the menu and addressed it to my dad for a cool fathers day gift. Anyways, our server looked like a mini version of Kobe Bryant and he was amazing. Provided us with great service and he was super friendly.  I had the bone in ribeye, my girlfriend had a NY strip and we got some asparagus and mushrooms and spinach for sides. Everything was cooked to perfection minus my steak being more on the medium side than medium rare.  Since we just celebrated my B-day Kobe Jr. brought us out a giant slice of pecan pie that was literally 5 inches thick and the size of a third of a pie. It was phenomenal.  Lastly, my girlfriend was excited because Julianna and Bill were sitting next to us (E News and Apprentice winner who now have a reality show) for dessert at the end of the night. Gibsons is a must for any steak lover!",0.9978,0.741,0.248,0.011,0.5336309523809524

2010-06-22,5.0,"We love a good steak, so on our trip out to Chicago for the Angel/Cubbies series from Orange County we had to check it out. First, the service was excellent - I dont know our servers name but he looks-no kidding- exactly like Kobe Bryant. Only about 5 feet shorter.  He was a good sport when we downed our wine and I nicknamed him ""Kobe Slider"". The setting is dark and constantly packed. We sat next to Tori Hunter (from the Angels) and Chicago residents Giuliana and Bill Rancic. Funny that we are from LA and saw more celebrities in Gibsons than anywhere we eat in Southern Cal.  The bread basket has several types of bread- white, french, wheat, olive, etc. They were good and fresh- and like most break baskets, not even necessary (not that it stopped me from eating it). We had a starter salad which comes with each entree. Nothing fancy- iceburg, tomatoes, bleu cheese dressing. I would have expected a fancier salad but the dressing was actually really delicious.  I had the petit New York strip and my boyfriend had the Chicago Style bone in ribeye. For sides we had asparagus (Kobe Slider suggested we get it grilled with lemon and olive oil- amazing), sauteed mushrooms, and spinache sauteed in garlic and olive oil. The sides were perfect. They reccomended the split potato, but we decided since we were already eating our weight to go with the veggies. The mushrooms were sauteed in a wine sauce and had great flavor. They also put in chunks of roasted garlic which made the spinach and mushrooms even more awesome.  The steaks were both HUGE. I had the petit so I cant imagine the size of the regular. I had it medium rare and it was perfectly cooked with a nice seared char- crust on the outside. It was perfect- easily one of the best I have ever had. His ribeye was also perfect, although he did say it was cooked slightly more toward the medium side.  Of course we had dessert. They have cakes and pies that are literally about 7 inches high (thats what she said) and about 1/4 of a huge pie per slice. We were going to get lemon  meringue, but Kobe slider told us he was bringing us something better. Uh, ok. He was right- and brought us a giant slice of pecan pie. It was amazing, and was topped with ice cream. All in all it was an awesome meal, great service, fun people watching, and a cool atmosphere.",0.999,0.757,0.238,0.005,0.6051436563436562

Food: Three of us ordered the bone-in fillet ($50) and the forth ordered fish off the Hugo's menu (they are owned by the same group and our waiter suggested a look at the menu when my friend's wife asked about fish specials).  The bone in came highly recommended as only a few restaurants in the country have access to the cut.  The steaks were very good, but not the best fillet I ever had; especially given the price.  We also split a lobster tail and it was very good.  They pre-cut it into six sections for easier sharing. Dessert: Key Lime pie was enough for 4. Service: Carl and assisted by Paco.  Both were top notch!

This is probably 1 of the most famous steakhouse in the country & I can tell you by they are the top 20 grossing in 2009 of all restos in the country.  I'm not surprised by this. The steak is consistent here, top notch cuts that there is out there, especially the the bone-in rib eye, a classic all around American steakhouse. Their burger is really good here too. Great wines list, efficient service, & I love the outdoor patio for people watching! What i'm not too crazy about this place is the service, hit & miss. They are always too packed, so the servers always seem to rush us out.  Even we had RSVP, still waited for 25 minutes!

Chicago Cut ribeye and Marinated Skirt Steak.  I was actually really impressed with the skirt steak which was juicy, tender, flavorful, and cooked medium.  I have never had skirt steak cooked this perfectly before.  The medium-rare W.R. Chicago Cut ribeye was an excellent piece of meat that was crusty outside and savory juices were flowing out after the first cut.  I recommend trying the steak without steak sauce first since you will find that it's already seasoned perfectly. My only regret is that I did not save room for dessert.  Apparently, Gibson's desserts are renowned. To sum-up my experience, I have this message for Gibsons: Damn you!  You have bastardized every piece of meat I eat in the future.

It's a great spot for a decent filet or sirloin steak.  But now I like to belly up to the bar every once in awhile, as I did on Mother's Day, and have a martini, and perhaps a lite bite. Where the heck else can you end up sitting next to a some steel magnate, who has two Rolls-Royce vehicles and a Bentley (the latter which he has shipped out by train when he is on the west coast,) a bartender who tells you this stuff, and who  can regale you with those long and politically incorrect jokes which go on for days before the punch line?

The service was wonderful.  Our server (Ann, I think) treated us the same as the customers who were ordering $50 steaks, even though our total bill was $32.  She was also not hard on the eyes.  As mentioned, we booked our reservation through Open Table, and I had marked that it was our first visit (well, the first time paying).  I think for that reason, we got a fantastic Hot Fudge sundae to split.  Free.  Definitely worth the white lie.   Sodas were $2.75 each, which is less than most of the other big steakhouses.  Strangely, everyone around us got mini-bottles and glasses with ice.

Service: calling it excellent would be unfair to this place. The servers are better than fantastic. Very attentive but not intrusive and overbearing. Mo is our regular server and he is not only hilarious but extremely educated on all the wines,meats, sides, seafood, and appetizers. Mo always buys dessert(which I'll get to later)and an after dinner drink for my table. The bartenders are always real gentlemen that will buy rounds of drinks for everyone.They are as polite as can be and can offer an opinion on pretty much any topic if asked.  Atmosphere and Decor: This place is a landmark with pictures of every celebrity you could imagine hanging on the walls. You never feel rushed.In face one time we sat for dinner at 9 and we didn't leave until 1AM. Of course the place was packed the whole time and still had a ton of people at the bar when we were leaving. The place is extremely classy without being the least bit pretentious.  Food:The food is expensive but if your going out for a great steak at one of the best steak houses in the world expect to spend $40-60 on steak. And did I mention the steaks are enormous. They can feed you for the next few days.The best part is even though the steak is huge the product is never compromised. They are always cooked perfect to order and are so juicy. I also like how they tell you that you shouldn't eat anything past medium and they won't cook well done because it cheapens the meat.Any steak lover knows the rarer the steak the better the flavor.The sides are enormous and delicious.I've been to many steak houses where the sides are $15 and you get a baseball size baked potato. Not here. The Creamed spinach is my favorite but I've tried all and they are all fantastic.I have had better steaks at other steak houses but the fact that you get a monster steak for a reasonable price,cooked perfect there is no steak house better.The dessert is usually complimentary and 1 piece of cake is the size of human head. It is so big they actually serve it with a steak knife so you can cut through it. I've had roughly 5 different desserts and Even though there is never room in my stomach I always manage to have a piece and they have all been fantastic.  Wine: The wine list is enormous and unlike most other 5 star restaurants all the wines are so fairly priced. They don't attempt to get $100 for a $10 bottle of wine like other places.

2010-03-16,5.0,"On my first visit to the downtown location of Gibsons, probably Chicago's best-known steakhouse for the past 20 years, I can't help but give it 5 stars as it was certainly superlative. But if I could award 1/2 star increments, I think 4-1/2 would be more apt as it was not quite perfect.  When a friend offered me a steak dinner, anywhere in Chicago, to say thanks for connecting him with what became his new job, I certainly had plenty of options. But having never been to Gibsons on Rush (though I've been to the one in Rosemont), it was my easy choice, over places I've been to (Chicago Chophouse, David Burke's, Morton's, Shula's, Ruths Chris) and others that I haven't (N9NE, The Capital Grille, Smith & Wollensky).  Did I make the best choice? Who knows, but I'm certainly not complaining. Having preferred a glass of white wine over red--seemingly the proper pick with steak--I'm certainly no gourmand. But while Gibson's has a reputation as a place for celebrity hobnobbing, predatory encounters and propositional interactions--of both the romantic and dealmaking sort--I was there for the food. Tiger Woods could've been with 3 hookers two tables over and I probably wouldn't have noticed.  So the ambiance was fine, if a bit crowded--even at 6:30 on a Monday--for my true preference. And the service was very good, except for a blunder I'll get to in a moment.  My Pinot Grigio was good. So was the bread, but of three varieties, the raisin bread was the clear keeper. A pair of appetizer oysters were fine, but nothing to write beyond this sentence about. The house salad with bleu cheese was nicely chilled and adequate in size, but more solid than spectacular. Even split in 2, the double-baked potato was huge and tasty. Now for the steak... We both ordered the W.R. Chicago Cut, a 21-ounce bone-in Rib Eye, Medium Rare, with my friend asking for his more on the rare side. Seemingly, that's the one I was served, for it was undercooked to my tastes. Certainly a quality steak, but not spectacular. After eating about half of it, as is, I had it sent back to the grill, and I imagine it was about Medium when I got it back. Much better, delicious and probably a 5-Star Steak if done right initially. But I didn't ever experience the ""this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten"" moment a truly extraordinary steak should give you.  The Chocolate Mousse Pie was huge, large enough likely for a table of 6, and far too much even for two food fanatics. But it was fantastic. Hard to go wrong there.  So all in all a good experience and I'm entirely happy with my selection and very appreciative of my friend's graciousness. But if I have a next occasion to go to a great Chicago steakhouse, I think I will try somewhere else before going back to Gibsons real soon.",0.999,0.734,0.236,0.03,0.5672007015972531

Located in what is apparently called 'Viagra triangle' it is definitely a hot spot and a must try if you are ever in the Gold Coast neighborhood in Downtown. It was conveniently located across the street from my hotel so it was very accessible to visitors and tourists.  We had sidewalk dining which was elegantly displayed with surrounding plants, greens and flowers. Luckily, we were there early enough to avoid any wait as we were seated immediately. Evening dining out on the sidewalk is absolutely entertaining if you love to people watch like I do. I am a tourist to Chi Town so it was interesting to see the nightlife in another city. I did not see a lot of 'cougars' like some posted but I did observe a lot of older distinguished gentlemen conveniently posted outside in the patio tables with their cocktails and cigars scoping out the 'younger than them' crowd. That was entertainment enough for me!  The Small Filet Mignon with asparagus was divine cooked how I like..medium. The portions in anything you order is more than plentiful. I started off with a lobster bisque which I didn't want to stop spooning even after my Filet Mignon arrived. We also shared this ginormous Double Baked Potato which just melted in my mouth. However, my friend was not too impressed with their baked potato saying 'it's just an average potato'....oh no my friend...it is THE baked potato! It had all the fixins and was perfection.  Of course I always try and save room for dessert...even though I clearly did not have the room for it. I could not walk away dessert-less.

Friends and family of mine rave about how it is in their top five steakhouses. I am not a huge red meat craver but decided to try the pepper crusted fillet. It was the spiciest piece of meat I have ever had. They aren't kidding when they say it is hot.  I also ordered mine medium-well. My mother ordered hers medium and my father medium-rare. They all came out with the same amount of pink (it was more of a blood red, really). My big problem with this restaurant is how they jam pack you in like sardines. The last time we went there our table was squeezed in so tightly between two other tables that there was no way I could get up to use the restroom. I had two wait 30 minutes for one of the tables to get up. In the five minutes it took me to use the restroom and come back they had already seated the other table. I couldn't have gotten back to my seat with out having to make three other people get up. So what did I do? I stood by the table while we paid the bill. It took over 15 minutes to settle up and it wasn't even our server who ran our credit card.  ***I used to be a server and am pretty good about knowing when your server is terrible or if he is just in the weeds and a mark of an excellent server is how quickly the check is settled. *** The time before that when we came here, our table was so close to the host stand that people that were waiting for their table were practically sitting in our laps. I don't know how many times I got hit with a coat.  Anyway, back to the most recent time. Our server was friendly but absent minded. He forgot a glass of wine and didn't remember it until we were finished eating. He offered to buy us a dessert, but after all the meat I don't know how anyone could have room. I had a cup of jambalaya that was really good and for the table we ordered a side of the mushrooms and a baked potato (for my brother). The mushrooms were great and the potato a little dry.

2009-09-30,5.0,"Gibson's is one of the classic, premier Chicago steakhouses.  They are usually splendid, and when they do misfire, they'll make it right so long as you bring it to their attention.  The old, dark hardwoods, the lingering of decades of background cigar smoke, and the power diners all around you give you a sense of that true ""old boys club"" ambiance that defined great steakhouses in the mid-20th century. For lunch, drop in and have the filet sliders - delicious, and you can order individually (after the first 3 which come together).  That and a few oysters or shrimp cocktail plus a half salad or small bowl of soup is a huge, decadent, lovely midday self-treat. Note that Hugo's Frog Bar is fully connected with Gibson's, If memory serves, you can get anything from the Gibson's dinner menu at Hugo's for dinner, but there are some things Gibson's won't vend from the Hugo's menu - odd, huh? So if the meat is wonderful, the choices classic and great (if not plentiful), what's the downside?  Answer: cost.  Gibson's is even expensive for a steakhouse.  While I loved dropping in for lunch, what I described earlier would easily set me back $50 or more - not a cheap treat, and that's on the lunch menu.  Dinner hits easily for $80, and that's without being indulgent or getting sides - go to a full shrimp cocktail and either a good-sized, luscious lobster tail or a really big, decadent cut of steak, and you're going higher still. So they priced themselves out of being a daily - or even weekly - event for most people.  Go when you want a rich sensory experience that's every bit as much a pamper as a Vosges chocolate run.  Just be sure to dress up a little before you go so they take you seriously. This earns 4.5 stars without blinking, and when they're on, they're 5 star - a classic Chicago ""king of steak"" steakhouse.",0.9798,0.83,0.125,0.045,0.49775454897406124

2009-09-26,4.0,"When my buddy asked if we were having a ""bigboy"" dinner on my visit to Chicago, it seemed like a no brainer. I said lets go steak since it's the midwest, you guys have no shortage of cattle, and when in Rome.... He booked us a 7pm Fri night rese at Gibson's, which I thought was a tad early, but he assured me even though we had the rese, we might still have to wait and dining here is usually close to a 2 hr affair. He was spot on and after arriving we waited 15 before being sat. The place was packed, which he said is normal 7 days a week. The inside of this space is old-school which I prefer over the new sleek steak spots. It reminded me of some of the places my folks used to take me in Philly and Jersey when I was a kid. Our waiter was awesome, spitting out funny 1 liners he's probably said a thousand times before, but super attentive, snappy, and cool. He brought out the plate to show us the different cuts and the largest flippin lobster tail I have ever seen.  I went with the DW specialty which was a rib-eye and although I ran into a few sinewy moments, it was unbelievably bursting with flavor. For sides we split a 1/2 order of garlic and lemon spinach w/ whole button mushrooms, and 1 twice baked potato. I originally wanted nothing to do with the potato when I saw one at the table near us. Then the waiter described it's preparation: baked once, scooped and pureed with herbs and spices, re-stuffed, doused in cheddar and baked again. It was crazy good, both soft and crunchy, creamy and cheesy,  and I had to stop myself from finishing it so I'd be able to go out after dinner.  When our steaks arrived, which we had both ordered medim-rare,  I cut into mine and felt it both looked and tasted medium. I'm usually not one to send something back, but when you're dropping over $40 on 1 dish, it's gotta be the way you want it. Our waiter didn't even second guess us or make a face, he promised he would take care of it right away and less then 10 mins later, we had 2 brand new steaming steaks in front of us, cooked to perfection. He apologized endlessly and before bringing the check at the end, he comped us an apple pie a la mode. Neither one of us had any room for it whatsoever, but it was a nice gesture.  To top it off my bud picked up the check and treated for my bday, what a badass! Thanks Peeps! I'd def suggest Gibson's to anyone traveling to Chicago or if you haven't made it here yet. One more final note: extra props to Gibson's for not jumping on the 5 different types of sauces to drown your steak in bandwagon seen way too often at upscale steak joints. Do you want to taste steak, or a mayo-ey blend of peppercorn and cheesy bullshit? Keep your sauces and I'll stick with a well seasoned steak.  1 more tip: The restaurant right next door called something Frog, is owned by and shares the same kitchen with Gibson's. If you are dying for a Gibson's steak and can't get a reservation, you can go here and order the steak, same quality, same price. That's a bingo!",0.9887,0.852,0.102,0.046,0.49334541427564693

We were given bread and butter - and it comes with 3 different types of bread - my favorite was the one with all the nuts in it. Yum! The cool thing about this place is that the waiter came out with a whole tray of raw steaks and one lobster tail. Just to show us the steak and explain the cuts to us. Very cool. I ordered the small sirloin, since the regular sized sirloin looked really big. We also decided to share the twice baked potato amongst the three of us. Even my small steak was pretty big - and rare just like I wanted. The waiter did tell us that the meat is normally a bit rarely than what it normally is. So when I ordered rare, he did tell me it'd be pretty rare. I told him to bring it on, the bloodier the better! The steak itself was very juice and tender. Crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. My friends ordered the filet mignon and the classic cut and said that was excellent as well. I was so full from my ""small"" steak that I could barely finish the 1/3 of the twice baked potato!  We were going to order dessert, when we saw that the table next to us ordered a dessert - and it was huge! One dessert could easily feed 4 people! Too stuffed for me.

Not by a long shot. First of all, the food here is average at best. If you don't order steak, expect it to be mediocre, and leave you with a horrible guilty feeling in your stomach to boot, knowing that even if you take home the massive doggie bag they'll give you, some poor starving child or family could've really eaten that food AND you're going to throw it all away in 10 lbs of paper and plastic that they wrap it up in after it languishes in your fridge for days. The one bright side is that for $15, you get the most massive, heart-attack inducing carrot cake invented. I don't care if it's not totally amazing. Your whole table can share it and you don't have to leave pissed off that your boyfriend (who promised only to have ""one bite) ate the whole thing--cause there's going to be enough left over for you to be eating it for 3 days. Don't even get me started on the wine list. Talk about cliched, corporate, grocery store brands that are marked up an insane amount. They pour jug wine as their by the glass house wine and charge $9. Highway robbery! Finally, much to my surprise (or not, given the neighborhood it's in and the clientele this place serves), there were hookers in the bathroom. Hookers! Talking about what kind of night they were having so far, and who they were pulling in from the bar--a bunch of silver fox douchebag types that think they're hot shit because they are with 22-year-old call girls. Come to think of it, maybe that IS why all of Hollywood's Romeos come here... The one shining thing about this place is the service--it's exceptional. I would give it 5 stars--the servers are professional, know the menu and the wines, and are funny and helpful. Whoever trains them does an amazing job.

I ordered the *Frei Brothers Merlot because... I know my wine. It didn't disappoint. Some people seem to think a rare or medium-rare steak shouldn't be charred or crisp at all. This mystifies me.

Mo (I mention him by name because he was just that good) took care of us all night.  He was Johnny on the spot when we needed him, but never intruded on our long, long conversation. The good: The house salad with crumbled blu cheese and balsamic was fantastic.  Really set the palate.  Mo was well versed in the wine list and recommended a great bottle for the table. The Double baked potato.  I need to figure out their recipe because SHAPOW!  Add in some mushrooms and creamed spinach and you have a MEAL my friends. The ehhhh: I had the bone in sirloin Medium Rare.  From Mo's description this was going to trend toward rare.  Instead it trended toward a full medium.  In a normal situation, I wouldn't bat an eye at this because a nice cut of aged beef is pretty awesome when cooked in a 1800 degree oven. However, if I'm dropping the kind of coin that Gibson's is commanding for a steak, it better be right!  Thus, 4*'s and not 5*'s.

2009-01-13,4.0,"There are more Chicago steak houses than you can count on your fingers (and possibly toes) so it's important to find the ones that are truly worth your while.  If you're looking for great steaks, excellent service, and live atmosphere, this should be one of your top choices to visit.  The steaks have a phenomenal char, and the tenderness of the steak really shines when you take each bite.  Medium to medium-rare is the way to go IMHO to truly enjoy the high quality of the meat and the contrast between the flavorful char and the tender meat. Recommendations: W.R. Cut - Excellent Rib Eye, but lots of marbling... so make sure you know what you're getting into before ordering it. Filet Mignon - Lean, and surprisingly flavorful for this particular cut.   Mashed Potatoes - As with any good steak house, enough to share with the table... the wine based gravy to go with was alright, but the potatoes themselves are dense and extremely well flavored.  Delicious naked. Avocado Crabmeat (appetizer) - Sounds simple, but with how fresh the avocado and crabmeat were and the dressing that topped it, this appetizer was an excellent opening for all of us.  Unfortunately, the size isn't really a ""shareable"" appetizer... perhaps more meant for two instead of four. Recommendation for fun: Meaning of Life Cake - Be warned, all their cakes (while slightly pricey) are really 1/4 to 1/5 of a whole cake... and about 7-8 layers tall.  These are meant to feed a village!  This particular chocolate layer cake has layers of bananas, chocolate shavings, and a cherry liquor sauce and then covered with tasty whipped cream with toasted fresh almonds.  Served with vanilla ice cream.  While I've definitely had better cakes, this one is ordered more for the entertainment value of my guests (and to the entertainment value of the tables around us).   Be warned... reservations don't mean you'll have a seat at the same time... We arrived at 7:25, had reservations at 7:30, and were not seated until 7:50... and even then, we were seated about 7 feet behind the hostess area and felt the cold winter breeze at our table regularly.

We had trouble hearing eachother and were bumped a few times by adjacent tables. Still, no big deal.  The service was excellent. I was prepared to be prodded and pushed out since it seemed like a touristy type place that is good, but tries to turn tables quickly. Fortunately, our server let us take as much time as we liked and even suggested letting us sit for awhile with our cocktails (GREAT and big martinis! YUM!). He explained the menu and the cuts of meat really well.  I'm glad they come out with the cuts of meat because I was thinking of getting the regular filet until I saw it. It's huge! I got the small filet and that was more than enough meat for me. We also split the sauteed spinach with mushrooms and garlic among us all. It was great. Just a reminder though it seems to be mentioned in every review, the desserts are HUGE! One ""piece"" of carrot cake is actually 6 big slices.

When the bartender was reminded that is supposed to be dirty he just added olive juice and stirred his glass in front of us. He did NOT even bother to release the glass of previous crap.  When we were finally seated at our table, oysters we ordered never appeared. We had to sit and munch on bread for some decent half hour before our entree was served. When we enquired of whereabouts of our oysters, the server had to reverse our courses. That is, the entrees were taken back to the hidden jungle of their kitchen. So, we finally got hold of oysters. aaa ok. Thought the evening trouble would end there. Not really, the grand finale of Gibson's service fiasco came into conclusion when our previously served steak came out of the kitchen reheated and therefore all dried up.  Uum dessert? No, thank you!

My boyfriend and I had planned to go for my birthday dinner, but I waited too long to make reservations and couldn't get a decent time on a Saturday night. We ended up doing a very early dinner around 4PM. We were greeted by every staff member we came across while being led to our table (same on the way out!). Our drink orders were taken right away and our server explained he would be back in a few minutes to show us all the cuts of meat and explain it all to us. We both had salads - my boyfriend had the house, I had the caesar - neither of us were too impressed. There was something a bit ""off"" about my dressing. We both ordered the filet, and asked for them not to char the steaks on the outside like they usually do. My boyfriend got medium rare, I ordered medium. We opted to split the baked potato. When the steaks arrived, they were both almost well done - we cut them right down the middle and saw NO red on the inside. When our server came back to check on our steaks, he noticed how overcooked they were and was overcome with genuine embarrassment. I told him I would keep my steak, but he insisted on taking both of ours back and getting us new ones. Minutes later, the new steaks appeared, and were absolute perfection. He also brought us fresh potatoes along with our new steaks. Our server said that the staff in the kitchen was more concerned with re-stocking the kitchen rather than cooking the steaks, and he offered us his sincere apologies. He said to be sure to let him know if anything at all isn't to our liking. We were not going to order dessert, since we had seen how huge they were - we were planning on doing some shopping afterwards and didn't want to carry a giant chocolate cake around! But our server surprised us with a HUGE piece of chocolate cake, compliments of the kitchen. It was unlike anything I've ever had - it's two days later, and we're STILL eating leftover cake!

2008-06-29,2.0,"The secondary debate between New York & Chicago (the first being Thin Crust vs. Deep Dish)...  Who has the better steak? From all the reviews on the various online websites and word of mouth from Chicagoans, Gibson's Steakhouse seemed to be the preferred choice. Thus, my venture to Gibson's Steakhouse was conducted and can conclude my experience with a single term... UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Pros:  - Unpretentious dining environment! - Eloquent décor through each dining area! - Helpful and attentive wait staff - Portion sizes, come hungry! - The dessert!  The Chocolate Turtle Pie was Gluttonous Heaven! Cons: - The taste!  This should hardly be considered a steak! - Price! $48.50 for a steak I could've done @ home for a  of the price! The Décor:  The mahogany inspired wooden panel and furniture plays to the subtle and relaxed atmosphere of the restaurant.  This is greatly aided by the off white table clothes used in their dining area to bring out the enchanting lighting of the restaurant.  Strategically placed celebrity autographed pictures (which were by no means few and far between), aided in the bars social scene.  Such separation was well executed by the restaurants heads to disseminate a relaxed bar environment to that of a subtle and quaint restaurant atmosphere. The Food:  ""I Came Here For the Porterhouse!""  Those words echoed wonders as I informed our server of my intentions.  There was no swaying of my decision to taste and consume a cut from the B. Taurus Species of the Bovidae Family in the Animalia Kingdom; the Porterhouse was THE choice, the ONLY choice! Server:  How would you like your steak prepared? Chun: Medium Rare is great; I don't want it overcooked... Server: Would you like the steak bloody? Chun: Most preferred, Thank You! With those words, my steak was off for preparation. The 28oz Porterhouse:  Upon presentation of the illustrious wonder, the 28 oz Porterhouse did not boast the merit or presence for which it's been graced!  The first visually detected contrast was that the preparation of the steak was done on a grill and not that of a broiler, this preparation process alone skewed any lingering respect I might've had for this restaurant!  The taste itself was in essence a contrast, the outside edges of the steak contained the consistency of that a well done texture, with the meatiest portion of the inners having that of a raw texture.  This is evident with a steak is grilled and not broiled.  Another drastic discovery of the steak was detected through consumption.  The first bite of this ""consumable"" (if they can call it that) was bland and rough in nature (signs of overcooking).  What was even more frightening was that the absence of fat in this presentation had me ponder on two fronts... 1) Was this a true USDA Prime Steak? 2) Was this Steak even aged before they decided to throw it on the Grill? Lastly, due to the lack of abundant marbling found in a well selected piece of Porterhouse, the steak lacked the proper taste and texture to that of one that was well executed.  This produced a profound lack of taste, thus requiring me to use their house BBQ sauce.  Sadly, that didn't make much difference. There was one saving grace of this experience... Throughout lunch, I saw the same dessert being carted off to various tables near our seating area.  We politely asked our server for what was later titled ""The Chocolate Turtle Pie"". The Chocolate Turtle Pie:  This dessert was a fully representation of the Chicago mentality of ""Bigger is Better"" with their food applications.  The presentation of the dessert contained a base later of pie crust made from graham crackers, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  The crust was then topped with  gallon of Haagen Daaz Vanilla Ice Cream (I kid you not about the amount of Ice Cream).  The dessert was finished off with strategically placed Macadamia Nuts throughout the side of the mountainous dessert and was topped with a heavy drizzle of milk chocolate.  If there was a more elaborate dessert made available, I would like to see it.  The taste did not disappoint.  All of the ingredients mended together to produce a comforting yet humbled appreciation of such a monstrosity.  Despite the size itself, the buttery smoothness of the ice cream greatly aided the sugary crust thus resembling that of a Molasses Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich.  The addition of the Macadamia Nuts greatly aided in the execution by giving the dessert a crunchy and nutty flavored element.  Needless to say, this is a must have while visiting Gibson's! Despite Chicago's most preferred efforts, the lack luster disappointment that is Gibson's Steak did not boast well for my farewell meal.  If Gibson's is representative of the Steak that's harnessed by Chicago, I'd like to say that New York's version wins hands down.",0.99,0.857,0.095,0.047,0.4994768278859188

I see this establishment is hated as well for its crowds, noise, and hype, more so than the Weber Grill it seems. I must be easy to please, because I just loved my meat today. It too was also charred well on the outside, yet pink on the inside as medium rare should be. It was tender as all get out, and juicy to the max. The Bearnaise sauce on the side was full of buttery goodness. I'm not sure how many years tonight took off my life. The garlic spinach with mushrooms was one nice side dish. I kept eating it until my teeth bristled with that irony texture. Portions were big enough for 5 of us to share. The asparagus with hollandaise sauce was somewhat disappointing. It didn't have much pizazz. The salad that comes with the steak was nothing special, just iceberg lettuce with a ton of dressing. I like the drowning of dressing but I know it's bad for me. The place was crowded as all get out, but noise was fine since we were seated in the glass enclosed outer patio room, and was placed in the corner with a great view of the street life.

We came here on a Friday night for dinner with some out-of-town friends.  We met in the bar, where a piano player was playing (which was lovely).  And it was packed already (at 6pm!)  Thanks to reservations, we were seated shortly. Our server comes over, takes our drink orders then comes back with a HUGE plate of meat.  He's very knowledgeable, and efficient, clearly a veteran of the steak-house serving. I had beef on the brain (a safe bet when coming here).  So I ordered the small filet (which is plenty of beef for this girl).  Unfortunately, my medium was closer to medium-rare, and dare I say rare.  It was very cool in the middle.  Now, I hate to be THAT girl who sends stuff back, but if we're paying $30 for a teeny piece of beef, it better be cooked appropriately.  So we kindly spoke to one of the bus-persons and asked him to take it back. It was brought back in a timely fashion, and the server checked back with me to ensure it was cooked appropriately.  Honestly, it STILL wasn't medium, but it was hot in the middle, which is all I really cared about.  Not much flavor to the steak, and not nearly as tender as a filet should be.  I was sorely disappointed. However, the service is top-notch (the guy with the pepper mill came out of nowhere!), the ambience is fun (old-school) and the place is phenomenal for people-watching.

The twice baked potato tasted like it had been sitting a while and was not that exciting and the broccoli was downright boring since you could taste the water it had been cooked with. The funniest thing had to be the salad which consisted of iceberg lettuce (which I've heard described as the polyester of greens) and a ton of ranch dressing.

2007-08-27,4.0,"Came here for dinner with my parents after hearing a LOT of hype about it. Obviously, it's a very swanky & very famous place to eat, and it was definitely worthy of 4 stars. However, it wasn't the best steakhouse experience I've ever had in my life. There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said a thousand times before -- obviously the steak is great, obviously the food is pricey. They charge you PER SODA, which is a practice I'm considering boycotting restaurants for. Since I don't drink soda, this didn't affect me, but it affected everyone else at my table and it's ANNOYING and GREEDY to boot. But on to more pleasant things -- get the double baked potato and/or the baked sweet potato, they're both to die for. Everything we had was great, but those sides stood out. The atmosphere is fun, but obviously very very crowded. We had to wait even though we had a 9pm reservation. The attitude is definitely, ""If you weren't sitting at this table, someone else would be."" And, to some extent, that's justified because of their fame and the quality of their food, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant. The service was good once we were seated, but for truly great service and a truly great attitude, you should look at the next review that I'm about to write. All in all, definitely a great meal, but there are other steakhouses I'd revisit first.

The seasoning was perfect, the mushrooms were not overcooked, the fresh tomato was not completely raw and everyone at the table absolutely loved this dish.

The Fillet Mignon - medium.  Undercooked badly the first try, and with cold asparagus thank goodness the waitstaff here is great made us cut into the steak to make sure it was to our liking.  Immediately after we noticed the cow still MOOOooing on our plates the waitress took both the steak and the asparagus away and brought back exactly what we wanted.  YEAY!!!

I guess I always thought the place was crawling with puffed-up out-of-towners hoping to catch a glimpse of Michael Jordan or some other famous Chicagoan. And, since it's located in the heart of the Viagra Triangle, I wasn't much looking forward to running into throngs of my fellow females flirting for drinks with the older, married businessmen that permeate State and Division. I needn't have worried.  When we arrived for our 8pm reservation, the bar was so packed I didn't have to fret about rubbing elbows with any of the above. There was a great coatcheck, though, and I gladly paid the $3 to check my umbrella, coat and briefcase (who am I kidding, backpack.) I wish more places had these services, btw. I am forever carting around work and gym clothes and then heading out... We waited maybe 15 minutes before being escorted into a lively corner of the restaurants. Not only was the dining room huge, so were the tables! There were three of us, but we were surrounded by large parties, most notably some sort of bachelorette (surprisingly well-behaved) group of about 12 women. Our waiter was friendly and patient and seemed to enjoy working there. He took his time during the meat presentation where they bring out raw cuts of the different types of steak. He also showed us the large lobster tail that looked amazing, but at $100-plus, was too pricey when I was certain I'd barely have room for an entre. We shared a 4oz. portion of the spicy lobster salad to start and I can tell you right now, I will be ordering some of that to take home in the near future. Delicious sauce and really fresh lobster. For steaks, we all went with the small filet. I got mine plain, but my aunt and uncle opted for the peppered one. The one snag of the meal came when it took 3 attempts to successfully order a bottle of wine. The first two we ordered were out of stock which was frustrating, but the waiter handled it with humor and the cab blend we ended up with went well with the meal. We ordered way too many sides: creamed spinach, asparagus and fries, but they were tasty enough that I didn't feel too guilty. The cocunut creme pie was impressively built, but unremarkable in taste. All in all, this is a great place to go when you're looking for an over-the-top, excellent steak, good people-watching experience. I wouldn't mind eating that lobster salad on a weekly basis, but I'd save eating that much in one sitting for a once-a-year blowout.",0.9973,0.821,0.166,0.013,0.5691949354992832

The way it's prepared is absolutely perfect! I had a big ole piece of meat (too big in fact) with easy pepper corns, easy garlic. It was slighty crispy on the outside, super tender and moist on the inside.... ahhh, perfection! My broiler never cooks a piece of steak like that. My only complaint was that I did bite into one piece of fat (ick!)... I know, fat makes it taste better. But if I am gonna pay that much for a steak, I want every last bite to be enjoyable. You also HAVE to try their twice baked potato... big enough to feed 4 people. All I have to say is that I have had dreams about that steak and potato. The sweet potato was... average Ice cream sunday was great...I was stuffed and even then, I loved the ice cream sunday! If you're in town, try it! You owe it to your taste buds and your stomach.

I rarely go out in New York, preferring appartment parties to bars and my own cooking to most dinners in New York under $50.  I know, I know, sacrilege for a Yelper...excommunicate me.. Anyway, came in here tonight and the place was packed. Frigid night, snow everywhere, Tuesday night, place is hopping. Definitely has the well-heeled, but not at all snoody or trendy crowd down. Overall, very solid steakhouse, but not the best.  The appetizers were pretty weak, though some of the shellfish looked good. Both my buddy and I did the bone-in sirloins, which were very good. Supposidly they cook steaks at about 1800 degrees, which is absolutely insane. Unfortunately, the order's got messed up and my medium came in medium rare (Which is kind of like shanking a 6 iron, only on a shot you should have hit with the 8 iron so it works out) while my buddy's medium rare clocked in at medium well. Fortunately, the waiter agreed that the mistake had been made and got a new steak out to him in a few minutes. Still, this mistake was part of what I considered to be good service, but not top notch. If I want to go to a great steakhouse with so-so service, well, Peter Lugar's is still in business for a reason. The sides were quite good though. The creamed spinich was well, about what it should be (have you ever had creamed spinich that you raved about?) but the twice baked potato stole the show. It was incredible and you definitely should get it if you go here. We did not have desert, though the slices of cake were about the size of Peyton Manning's ego.  The wine selection was both extensive and reasonably priced. You can get a good cab from Napa for $40-$55. 3.5 stars.",0.99,0.761,0.169,0.07,0.6442091972355131

So of course, I had to go there on my first trip to Chicago. After a 4 hour delay at LAX and a re-route to another airport because of thunder storms, we finally landed 6 hours past our orignal time. knowing we weren't going to make our reservaiton for 9:00pm, I called ahead to reschedule. The Maitre D, was very gracious and insured us a table for whenever we arrived.  After a mad rush to pick up our rental car and unexpected traffic, we arrived 10:45. To my amazement, we were seated within minutes! SInce our last meal was at 7:00am PST, we were HUNGRY to say the least. Not knowing the next time I would be in Chicago, I opted for the Surf and Turf featuring a Gibson's cut Rib eye.  Even at 11pm, the place was full and the buzz of many conversations could be heard. The atmosphere was friendly and the people watching was just like LA. I definitely need to make it back, to take in the nightlife here.  Soon our food arrived and the visual was impressive. Portions are defintely not for the light hearted. This was a perfect time to whip out the digital cam and document our first night in Chicago. Upon slicing into my steak, I found it cooked to order; a perfect medium rare. Now for the test... Although it was soft and tender, the taste fell well below my expectations and this is the reason for me giving Gibson's only 3 stars. My lobster tail was tuff and didn't seem fresh, nothing like Lobsterfest at the pier. All in all, our experience was above average. Would I come back? Yes, but more for the ambiance than the food.

They broke out a double-magnum sized bottle of something pretty decent- the novelty alone was enough to please me. We had a bunch of much better appetizers, including oysters and crab salad. Then we had regular green salad, then they brought out those famous platters of uncooked meat where we picked which one we wanted. In addition to a mouth-watering filet, we also had several platters of lobster tails. For desert, there was a carrot cake that was, I kid you not, about a 18"" high and also I think some chocolate thing- I was in such a food coma that I can hardly remember. They also brought out whatever type of after-dinner drinks we wanted, and the guys from Teradata had a blast watching me drink a bunch of port, whisky and cognac.

Keeping your patrons waiting long past their reservation ISN'T part of the charm.  It's annoying and demonstrates utter contempt for your customers. 20 minutes, 30 minutes here or there, sure, I'd understand that, but these wait times are consistent and epic.  Why can't I ever have my table in a remotely timely manner?  Why, Gibson's, why?

This is not a place you come to when you feel like a snack - it is like Thanksgiving day, you ""save"" up your appetite.  You are probably walking into that bar on an empty stomach, so unless you have powers of self control like Gandhi (and if you did, you certainly wouldn't be attempting to dine at Gibson's), you are likely to get drunk before you get to your table.  The drinks are great, but they pack a punch, and with hour plus wait times, go down a wee bit too smoothly.  On a lesser note, but just as annoying, this place is full of would be Don Juans, emboldened by their vast expense accounts and generous amounts of single-malt whiskey who think it's okay to hit on strangers.  Now, I don't blame them - they've probably been waiting for their table for hours as well and are bored and/or drunk, but still.  Being from out of town or closing that huge deal and getting a raise is no reason to be overly fresh with the ladies. FYI for all you would be Lotharios waiting for your table at Gibson's, I'll answer your annoying questions once and for all  - a) Yes, I'm from Chicago, b) No thanks, I really don't want to go back to your hotel and ""party,"" and c) so thoughtful of you to offer me a cigar, but they are a little passe, don't you think?  This is supposed to be a restaurant, not Excalibur with a meat theme, so please save the lines for your wife and go home with some dignity intact.   Once you get to your table, I will happily admit, things are great.  Steaks and sides are good across the board, and the staff is always friendly and helpful despite having to shove platters of raw meat in drunken patron's faces all night, a task that would surely make even the best-natured of us surly.  That being said, for less money and hassle, I could go to Paulina Market, get a fantastic Prime steak, make it myself and get drunk at home without being subjected to unwarranted machismo.   Or I could just go to another steak house.  Hmmm...now there's a thought!",0.9983,0.747,0.195,0.057,0.6424764777705952

Throw the valet an extra $20 to keep your sportscar up front and impress the golddiggers that hang out at the bar, hoping the nice board of trade types will buy them a martini.  If you aren't looking to be seen, or want to get a word in edgewise, this place isn't for you.  If you want to watch some of Chicago's supposed A-list in action, belly up to the bar.  Reservations are essential unless you like long elbow-to-elbow waits in a bar where half the people are dining at bar tables far too tiny for the mammoth foodstuffs.  There are better steakhouses in Chicago, but this one has the best PR company.   Good place to spot Bears (current and former), Bulls, and Cubs, oh, my.  All you NBA groupies, this is a good spot to troll for roundball players. Pro athletes of any type, actually.  Let the games begin.",0.9856,0.774,0.186,0.04,0.45615942028985507
2006-01-21,4.0,"While Gibson's might be the most expensive steakhouse in the city, it's hard to beat.  The service is impecable (every table has two servers), and the quality of the meat cannot be rivaled.  This, for me, is a once per year type of place.  The last time I went to Gibson's, I was wearing a Spiderman suit...but that's a story for another time...",-0.1027,0.976,0.0,0.024,0.45208333333333334
2006-01-21,4.0,"A Chicago insitituion that's becoming a chain.  I know a lot of people who will be upset once there's no more cigar smoking there.  Great food, fun server's.  If you're from out of town and have some money burning a hole in your pocket, go here.",0.5574,0.752,0.15,0.098,0.5750000000000001

2005-12-04,3.0,"This is a good steakhouse in any other city BUT Chicago. Too many great spots to even call Gibsons a top 5 steakhouse in Chicagoland. Enjoy the people watching at the Bar, but save your money as this is more of a business dinner/tourist trap spot.",0.81,0.702,0.24,0.058,0.5321428571428571

2005-10-13,4.0,"This is definitely a once in a while type place, unless you are loaded and a serious carnivore.  The steaks here are incredible and their twice baked potatoes are most worth it.  They have a great bar with excellent service and killer martinis too!",0.8118,0.647,0.247,0.106,0.6309523809523808
2005-09-26,5.0,"One of the best steakhouses I have ever been to.  I make sure to get there every time I am in Chicago.  Old school - but in that classy way.  Hands down the best martini I have ever had in my life - crisp, dry, icy cold.  My friend who doesn't like them, had a sip of mine and promptly ordered one of her own. The portions are HUGE - so be sure to take your midWest appetite.",0.9736,0.69,0.28,0.03,0.5987179487179487

2005-07-28,4.0,ONe of Chicago's best steakhouses - they have the best peppercorn steak around; the atmosphere is always classy but casual; the bar is great with a variety of wines.  For a side - get their twice baked potato and you have to get either their steak of lobster here - or get both!!,0.9391,0.734,0.266,0.0,0.6233333333333333
