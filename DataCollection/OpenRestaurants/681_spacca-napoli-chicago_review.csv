2017-08-14,5.0,"I'm sorry if the soggy crust on the center bothered you to the point of writing a negative review. There's a Lou Malnati's a few blocks away. I love pizza, but to be totally honest, Neapolitan isn't even my favorite style of pizza. It's small and conservative in toppings. I grew up on Jet's eight corners. I yearn for pepperoni grease to cover my hands when I'm done eating, and for an accumulated ball of cheese threatening to tear through the bottom of my stomach. Considering that, it's possible to properly plan on how to dine at one of the finest pizza establishments in the city. Just look up at the specials board posted inside and outside by the entrance. At the top, you may see scribbled ""BURRATA."" Order that when you first meet your waiter/waitress. Pick another appetizer, too. The burrata is easily the best I've had. It's huge, bigger than an onion or grapefruit, and falling apart from the center. Drizzled on top is olive oil and sprinkled with flakes of salt. It sits on top of a few slices of toast. The first time I mistakenly thought there wasn't enough bread. Then you realize that the point is to maximize burrata payloads on the small toast platform. You'll eventually finish both appetizers along with some beer or wine. At this point you'll likely be close to full. Allow me to change tracks for a moment below. A great thing about dining at Spacca is that it carries legitimate authority in the pizza domain. You can go on Facebook and see where famed pizza guy Bonci hung out before opening his first restaurant (here in Chicago, today) outside of Rome: West Loop, and Spacca Napoli. He took photos with the chef, Goldsmith, who trained under a pizza maker that served pies to the Pope, and he took photo in front of Spacca's pizza oven, made by Italian builders. Goldsmith even once had his mozzarella supplier try pizza at Spacca, and upon biting into it the supplier literally cried because it brought back memories of their childhood in Naples. That's a true story. Anyway, you're basically full of gooey cheese and olive oil and maybe clams or octopus, and the bussers come and set down a pizza per person at the table (that's how you order these), and you feel just a little overwhelmed. You cut a slice and start eating anyway, and then you realize that in your preexisting fullness that you're probably going to finish this bad boy anyway. You realize in your bites and chews the expertise and the deliberation that went into making this pie, and you can't help but to keep going. The dessert menu offers tartufo, a marble of mousse encased in a ball of chocolate gelato dusted in cocoa and hazelnut; it's how to close a date. They also have grappa. They also have free mini cannoli.",0.9194,0.85,0.084,0.066,0.4628654970760236

2017-07-23,4.0,"I loved the pizza. We ordered three including the one without sauce (vegetable option for me). Not that I don't like the sauce but I wanted to experience it and I loved it. It was sort of having stuff on soft bread. The ones with sauce was good too. (I prefer eating things with sauce and not dough filled with sauce.) Dough is very important for me and I loved theirs - soft, thin, and sweet.  Besides the pizzas, we ordered a salad and a plate of prosciutto and mozzarella. I don't eat meat so I tasted the mozzarella. It tastes very fresh.  As I keep saying, their food taste really fresh which I appreciate.  If you like fresh tasting, simply (very well) put together yet flavorful food, this is your place.  The reason I don't give 5 stars is there was one very frustrated server (or owner) who told us to step aside in a rude way when we were getting seated and the entrance area is quite small. (He said ""In or out."") I was with a physically handicapped person so I wanted to be somewhere he could see so he doesn't need to wonder around. The host person could navigate people better to maintain clear entrance for both patrons as well as wait staff. Come to think if it, I don't think there is any other door for wait staff to wait tables outside. Maybe something to build in the future if there isn't one as of now.  Having said this, I am going back for more pizza for sure but will think about where to stand to wait for a table next time so I won't be scolded.",0.9904,0.79,0.167,0.043,0.4916696061140506

2017-07-19,5.0,"I am not a deep dish pizza lover, and although Chicago does have a lot of thin crust options they are a little harder to find.  The pizza at Spacca Napoli is amazing!! It's thin crust and very light, which I love.  Also, it is the perfect size (the signature personal pizza fills a large plate, so probably in between a small and medium traditional size pizza).  It's enough so that you feel full, but because it's thin crust and light, and uses very fresh ingredients without hardly any grease, you don't feel bloated or sick like you may with traditional or deep dish pizzas. There are probably about 10 specialty pizzas to choose from, and they tend to be very basic: Margherita, Pepperoni, Sausage, Sausage/mushroom, etc.  And the menu can be a little tricky to understand since the toppings are described in Italian, but the waiter will quickly break it down for you.  They didn't have a huge wine/drink list, but I ordered the house red and it was very good.

We get sat at our table, waited for 10 minutes and not 1 single server cared to take our order, ask if we had been helped or anything. After waiting 5 more minutes we finally get up and leave, the waitress who was supposed to attend to us had stopped by the table next to us at LEAST 4 times to check on them, and she completely ignored us. Literally the table next to us, we could tap elbows if we wanted to, and the ""waitress couldn't see you sitting at your table"" says the host...  Which, there were 3 other servers that avoided our table too, we actually looked at all of them in their eyes (sounds so creepy lol, u know what I mean ) to get their attention because we got bored watching the paint dry.

2017-05-02,3.0,"I came to Spacca Napoli on a weekend night and it wasn't that crowded. They have a very large space and I saw a lot of tables open so we were seated right when we entered. My boyfriend heard a lot of great things about this pizza place and the reviews and pictures looked very promising. We knew we wanted the burrata and the pizza so we were intrigued to see all their pizza options. They're wine list isn't so extensive but I think you could find something to suit you. When the waiter came by he mentioned one of the specials he had which was a pizza with zucchini pieces, and pieces of meat like bacon. It seemed promising so we ordered that along with their burrata and a white wine. The burrata came out looking beautiful! I would definitely order the burrata again. However, the pieces of bread they gave you had a lot of burnt pieces on it. Not the biggest fan of burnt bread but the burrata made it bearable. The portion size is also huge so you could split it between 2-4 people easily. When the pizza came out you have to slice it yourself. I like the idea of this but also I don't because I really don't trust myself to cut the pieces evenly. We ended up just slicing it into fourths because we just wanted to eat it and not mess up our pizza sizings. I was really disappointed by this pizza. It didn't hold it's shape whatsoever, I could not fold it in any way because it was so saggy, and the pizza was just so doughy. It needed a few more minute in the oven before it came to us honestly. Although, the pizza being a bit undercooked it also had burnt marks around it as well. Maybe I came on an off day because the other reviews are glowing and should give this place another try but that pizza did not live up to my expectations.",0.9839,0.849,0.12,0.032,0.5279761904761905

A wonderfully TANGY fresh mozzerella drizzled with olive oil, cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil leaves. Accompanied with a few thin slices of bread drizzled with oil as well. Note: Tangy. It may throw you off. But we thought it was delicious. The margherita pizza - the true way to test how delicious and authentic a napolitano pizzeria is: order a margherita pizza. This one was delicious. Light, cheesy, fresh sauce, just heavenly! The bianca con rucola pizza - again, a bit tangy. My friend preferred this one. Very cheesy and delicious. No sauce on this one, just an olive oil base to let the fresh ingredients shine. The ambiance wasn't anything worth mentioning. We thought it would have a more rustic look or some character. There was no music playing (okay, there was, but it was so quiet we couldn't hear it), and there was minimal art on the walls. Neutral colors throughout. Everything just seemed to blend together. Nothing stood out to mention. Maybe because we were seated in the far back room? I got a glance of a beautiful wood fired oven on my way out! The service was interesting. Our waiter was very thorough with his descriptions. People came by and filled our water glasses - I kid you not - every time we took a sip from them. While it's a nice gesture, it kept interrupting the meal which was kind of obnoxious. Then, as soon as we paid, we wanted to hang around and chat for a bit and there was no water service as we sat there with empty glasses... We decided to skip dessert this time around, but they had adorable and delicious, light, melt-in-your-mouth cannoli at the host stand to grab on your way out. A cute, nice touch. Since we sat chatting for a bit, it would have been a nice option to have the cannoli delivered to the table with the check, a la mints at some establishments. I was curious to know more about Spacca Napoli. Conveniently, they have a ""History"" section on their website while we read in between courses. I just didn't feel much of that history translate into our experience at the restaurant.

The Vera Pizza Napolitana sign was reassuring. We were seated by the window. The decor was simple with Usual Italian pin ups on the wall. We ordered the arancini. Which came plain looking. They were good, but would have liked a sauce. Maybe they don't do that in Italia. Next came our pizzas. The base was soft and very much like a naan. The toppings were cold, clearly they didn't see the oven inside or barely. I was expecting my mozzarella melted with a little bit of char on the tomato sauce and tomatoes. The base was delicious but the topics lacked flavor. Like there was something missing. We got dessert too, we liked the desserts. The service was clean and friendly and not over friendly. We was disappointed in the pizzas that's all, maybe if I had gone with 0 expectations I would have liked it.",0.9894,0.746,0.219,0.034,0.5043047619047619

2016-11-19,5.0,"Went with a friend (Italian native) to whom it had been highly recommended.  I was reticent, not for myself, but knowing that my friend was a tough critic of Italian food made outside of Italy.  I even asked him, if the food isn't up to snuff, are you going to be miserable?  He swore he wouldn't be. The good news is that the food was awesome, and my friend was quite pleased, which pleased me.  He seemed to relax a lot more when he noticed the seals printed in the backs of our menus, indicating that the restaurant was regularly monitored by officials from Italy, presumably for maintaining certain practices, using certain ingredients, etc. We started with arancini, which were delicious, with a smoked mozzarella inside.  I'm normally not a fan of smoked cheeses, as I feel they often taste of fake smoke.  This cheese had a delicate smokiness to it, that, with its creaminess, the slight bite of the rice and the crunch of the exterior, made the bite size goodies just wonderful. We each ordered a pizza and then split them.  My friend chose the Salciccia, and I had the Porcini e Carciofi.  What can I say?  Based on those two, I'd say that any pizza you choose, with whatever toppings you like--you can't go wrong!  Of course, the artichokes were fresh, not jarred or canned; the porcini were in large, lovely slices.  Crusts were thin, with a slight char, crisp and delicate with a nice chew at the center. I would absolutely go there again.  As I travel yearly, at least, to Chicago, this makes me very happy--to have found authentic Neapolitan pizza!  A word also about the service:  stellar.  Friendly and attentive but not intrusive.  A great experience!",0.9943,0.718,0.212,0.071,0.6110969732022363
2016-11-18,4.0,"Everyone in Chicago has an opinion of what pizza is and often I'm told it's the deep dish.  Thankfully there are a few great alternatives in the city and Spacca Napoli is one.  The other personal favourite is Forno Rosso on Randolph.  These two are my personal favourite to find my beloved Neopolitan style pizza where the imported Italian best is left to shine on a perfect soft but highly flavourful crust with lots of leopard spots that is characteristic of the style.   Spacca Napoli is in an awesome neighbourhood that has a lot of easy parking and has a great vibe where you can see the revival.  The restaurant itself is bright and tables are really nicely spaced out.  We were given a window seating and it was great to have the corner to ourselves.  Though we did arrive after lunch, it was still quite busy and at least half full.  Thankfully it was still a good level of noise to make it lively without needing to yell for your life across the table. The menu itself is simple and easy to find some good selections that make your mouth water.  The special menu of the day really pulled us in ... we got the Cozze zuppe (mussel soup) and their Bianca pizza with bacon, ricotta, buffalo mozzarella, and smoked cheese.  Yes... that's right... cheese on cheese on cheese.   We got the soup quickly and found it be flavourful with 5 decently large pieces of mussels.  It was nice to have a cold afternoon.  The pizza came within 10 minutes of ordering and it had the wonderful usual soft centre with a crispy outer crust with a soft crust interior.  The toppings were a good foil to the bread as it added rich fatness of the bacon and creaminess of all the great cheese.  The pizza was an incredible reasonable $15 but the soup was a sticker shock of $12 for mostly broth.  I wish I asked for the price as I was thinking it was less than $10 ... but live and learn. Compared to Forno Rosso, I think Spacca Napoli ranks up there as a great spot but Forno Rosso may have the edge.  In addition to having well executed pizzas, Forno Rosso crust has a better flavour.. maybe its fermented longer?  Plus Forno Rosso has the super amazing tiramisu which often leaves me dreaming of it eating again.  They both excellent and would return to Spacca Napoli if I find myself in the north end again.",0.999,0.754,0.239,0.007,0.5658715184186883

2016-10-08,4.0,"Let's evaluate this Italian pizza restaurant on the scale of ambience, service, food quality and price. Ambience. Fantastic, charming, fancy, authentic.. you name it. It's all there. On the other hand it feels so casual and not pretentious. Perfect spot for a romantic getaway. You just have to check it out for yourself.  Food. As far as I understand, this restaurant specializes in thin crust pizza and just for that it deserves a high praise from me. Specialization is good. It's the basics of any well balanced macro and micro economics.  I ordered the Bufalina pizza. It's a cheese thin-crust pizza based on San-Marzano tomato sauce, topped with Mozarella di Bufala cheese imported from Italy and basil. It had this wet texture to it and amazed me how the cheese and tomato sauce alone can make for a great pizza alone. Magnificent! The dough.. I'm trying to be a pizza lover but the fighter in me says ""I haven't found anything special in the dough"".  Apart from that, I had the Maccherroni for antipasto. It's macaroni baked in cheese. Good stuff. Give it a try. Tartufo for dessert. It's Italian ice-cream and is a no brainer! Just look at the pictures and get it!  And the Cappuccino, which I liked too. Price. $36+ for the aforementioned is great! Service.. There sits an explanation of the missing star. While my server, Spiro, was great and masterfully walked me through the menu, highlighting the items I should try and didn't bothered me with questions seeing how I was indecisive, the service lacked the warmness and slow pace. Specifically.. small talk about the inner works of this restaurant didn't pan out so great because he was kind of rushing. Well.. no surprise.. he was serving all 15-30 people that were in the restaurant. Having said that, he did absolutely great. Bottom line, you should absolutely go!",0.9931,0.765,0.182,0.053,0.6256175595238094

Nothing else compares to Spacca Napoli pizza. If you have room the desserts are incredible!!! I went here for years before trying them (b/c I was always so full) but totally worth it.

We got appetizers to share;, the insalata di mare (calamari and shrimp), the polpo (octopus), burrata, and insalata mista (mixed green salad).  All were excellent, and enough to share with the table so everyone got to try. For dinner, we got a bunch of pizzas to just share as well; the Carnivale and another from the special menu with a name I can't remember, the Capricciosa, the Sei Formaggi, and the Margherita.  All were very good, the Sei Formaggi almost had too much cheese, it was pretty heavy.  The Carnivale had ricotta baked into the crust (think stuffed crust pizza, but better), and the rest were about what you'd expect. Fair warning that this is Neapolitan style, so it's very thin crust and minimal topping (this ain't no Lou Malnati's), so if that's not your thing then you probably won't like this. The one minor downside was that they wouldn't seat our group until everyone was there (even though we had a reservation), but I'm willing to overlook since that's a pretty standard rule at many places in Chicago.  Overall, a great meal!",0.9532,0.82,0.13,0.05,0.5326838546069316

And also, the quantity of the ingredients on my pizza was poor. For $15, I will have more at Mariano's or even Eataly. Dessert : unfortunately, they are not ""home made"". I did try the Panna cotta. What a disappointment. Thick, not fresh, not light. The balsamic vinegar glaze is absolutely horrible, like the pear compote or whatever they call it. Overall, that is a good place.

2016-07-05,4.0,"Spacca Napoli is not about gobs of cheese and loads of sauce with everything on their pizza. Rather it is about the art and craft of pizza making with quality ingredients where the purity and subtlety of the flavors  meld together and intice your taste buds. I have never been to Italy so I cannot vouch for the authenticity of their pizza, but many previous reviews have thusly stated as such and I am inclined to take them on their word. I had the Arugula and Prosciutto pizza and it was delicious yet light, so I didn't feel the heaviness afterwards that I usually do when eating the usual types of pizza that are offered in most pizzerias. Some reviewers have mentioned that the pizzas could use some extra cheese. While I do see the merits of this, I could swing either way on that issue. The other issue mentioned was burnt spots on the pizzas. Normally this would be an issue for me but it did not detract from my enjoyment as they did not impart a discernable burnt or charred taste. My server was informed and excellent. Additionally, with an oven reaching 800° to 1000° my pizza came out freaky fast. Spacca Napoli also offers an exceptional wine list. Highly recommended for just about everyone except those who are still debating the merits of thin crust versus deep dish pizza or Chicago versus New York pizza, as this is not the place to settle those culinary disputes.

Wish we could buy these Italian cheeses somewhere, unfortunately I believe they import their own. Even the baguette was great, also made on premises of course! Only downside, they are sooo busy, so wait times are always an issue you have to work around.

I am not a glutton for salt, but I felt like the sauce could have used a little more salt, because the cheese and mushrooms on my pizza just felt a little flat in taste, because there wasn't much coming from the sauce. Don't get me wrong, the tomato basis for the sauce was had a really bright flavor which I enjoyed, but it was missing a little something to pull it all together. And who knows, maybe the gluten free crust has less salt than their normal pizzas, thus making the overall pizza not as flavorful as I would have wished.",0.9774,0.78,0.191,0.029,0.514484126984127

2016-03-23,4.0,"Spacca Napoli has been on top places to eat in Chicago, and I finally experienced what all the fuss is about. Neapolitan pizza has to be one of my favorites styles of pizza in the world. That wood burning taste is irresistible and the fact that it is thin and light allows me to happily overindulge. I seriously can eat a whole pizza myself.  We started off with the burrata and a couple glasses of wine. The burrata was delicious! I've never had burrata before, and it was really tasty! It didn't come with enough bread though, but it's okay because we needed to save room for the pizza.  We ordered one pizza to share. The Diavola --  cheese, tomatoes, spicy salami, and chili powder. I expected the pizza to be spicier--it was quite mild for my tasting, but really good overall. I loved the dough and the sauce on it; super delicious.  So yeah, the pizza is very, very good, and I will be back for some more in the future. I wouldn't say that it blows any other Neapolitan pizza places out of the water, but it is delicious for sure.  CONS: The chairs are really uncomfortable omg, please change those. They are some wicker chairs and they are awful. The wine menu was hard to navigate around but the waitress was open to helping us choose a good wine. Our waitress was a little pushy when it came to ordering. We were there trying to have a leisurely afternoon full of drinks and good conversation but she kept interrupting us every couple minutes, by the end I wish I had ""We're okay"", tattooed on my forehead. My last complaint is that the burrata was overpriced but whatever.  Overall, I had a lovely time and enjoyed the pizza thoroughly.",0.9966,0.719,0.229,0.052,0.5733475783475784

We had attended a fundraiser earlier in the evening and were coming to Spacca Napoli with arm loads of raffle/silent auction items we had purchased and won. It was nearing close, since we had gone to the fundraiser first, but our host graciously sat us in a corner where we would have space to store our winnings and never hesitated to suggest we sit down and order. Despite being 15 minutes to close, our waiter never rushed us, and gave us plenty of suggestions on what to order. We went with a simple buffalo mozzarella and red sauce with a prosciutto Asiago and rocket pizza. Both were absolutely delicious. I could go on and on about the crust and the sauce---everything was so authentic and fresh it's hard to know where to begin. I think the crust is really what sets it apart though. Before we left, the host explained to us the difference between ""Napoli"" pizza and other kinds of pizza, and that's really where he difference lies--the farther north you go, the more ""crackery"" they become, and the closer to Rome the thicker they get. But in Naples, it's the perfect amount of thin and fluffy, crisp but soft. And the sauce on top of that--perfection.

2016-02-10,3.0,"Let me start by saying that I love pizza, but I love all of the versions of Chicago pizza.  I love stuffed, deep dish, tavern style, or cracker crust.  So my review is for other people who like pizza the Chicago way, and are considering trying something different. If you love Neapolitan style pizza, you should ignore my review. I came here over the weekend for a birthday dinner.  It's hard for me to decide how many stars to give. We had a reservation, but were waiting for a little while for the previous group to leave.  The restaurant was super busy and there were no open tables.  So people waiting for a table were standing in the walk ways.  This was really hard on everyone, because the restaurant isn't large enough to have a ton of people standing around waiting.  But it's not the restaurant's fault. I thought the staff was really fantastic.  They were good at keeping us updated, and at explaining items on the menu, and bringing us anything we needed. I had the Insalata Mista, Marinara pizza, and the tartufo. My husband and I did not like the Insalata mista salad,  I thought the dressing over powered everything else.  I barely ate it.  But other people at the table really liked it.  So this seems like it might just be personal taste. I thought the Marinara pizza was good.  I liked the crust and the sauce a lot.  I cannot believe so many other reviews talk about sharing 1 pizza for 2 people though.  These pizzas are about the size of a jack's frozen pizza (the ingredients and taste are nothing like it, this comparison is purely for size).  I think they are single serving pizzas.  I will stick with variations on the Chicago style pizza, but it was fine to try this! I do like that the pizza comes out whole, and you get a pizza cutter.  I thought this made it more fun, plus the pizzas look prettier when they arrive on the table. I thought the tartufo was boring.  It really just tasted like a ball of chocolate gelato dusted in chocolate.  I wished I had ordered the tiramisu or panna cotta because other people at the table raved about those. We left right at closing, and were not given cannoli.  I forgot to ask about them, maybe they were out at the end of the evening.  Or maybe they don't give them to everyone, or at every meal.  I don't know. Our 1 salad (one of the cheapest), 2 pizzas (both the plainest one, so they  were cheapest on the menu), and 1 desert (on the cheaper end) was $50 with tax and tip for 2 people. However it would be really easy to be twice as expensive as that if you had wine and wanted to try any of the specialty pizzas.   It's not a cheap meal, but you can tell they use good quality ingredients.    In the end it was a fun dinner, Spacca Napoli treated us well, and other people seemed quite pleased with their meals.  I thought the food was all fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place.",0.9986,0.794,0.183,0.023,0.5022515527950311

They make you cut your own pizza, which is not the end of the world, but it's a little awkward when there are already 90 things on the table, and they give you a small little slicer. I get that this is the ""authentic"" way to serve Neapolitan pizza, but it would be cool if they asked if we would like to slice it ourselves or if they can do it for us. The food again, is just OK. The real deterrent of this place is the gestapo style rules they have. Chill the hell out!! We were told ""no"" on several occasions, with really sharp 'that's not how we do it attitude.' They wouldn't let us sit at our table because one of our guests wasn't there yet. Why would you want to have 5 people clogging up your crowded entryway and hall if we could be seated, grab a drink (more money on the tab, better tip for great service). Another example, a friend asked if they had cannolis, the server said ""yes, but we give them as you leave."" My friend asked if it would be possible to have it now with a cup of coffee.

We order the burrata, fritti del Giorno (fried specialty of the day, which i think was potato on the day we went) and octopus for appetizers. The burrata was pleasantly creamy and the octopus was good. Nothing special about the fried ball. We ordered three pizzas, none of which left an impression. The crust was crispy and not too doughy but the middle of the pizza was soggy. I ordered a tiramisu since it was made with ladyfingers (like it should be) and that was also just okay. They had a decent wine selection and they give you a canoli on the way out.

2016-01-31,4.0,"Spacca Napoli receives rave reviews for it's inventive, tasty Neopolitan pies. After hearing about it for years and since I live in the area I decided to check it out.  When I went there there was a wait for about 30 -40 minutes so be prepared to wait if you go at primetime on the weekend. They have seating on the sidewalk in the summer so it's a nice place to eat outside when the weather cooperates.  My wife & I ordered the Burrata appetizer to start since it got such rave reviews. Honestly, I don't know what the hype is about the Burrata. It's tasty and if you've never had burrata before (or similar cheese) it's quite a treat -- but I don't know it warranted the price tag. ($16). I've had better burrata before so I'd skip it and save your appetite for the pizza. For pizza we ordered the Gianfranco. It was not your typical pizza. Instead of a red sauce it was a potato/leek puree, with mozzarella, shrimp, lemon, and mint. Non-red sauce pizza with seafood is risky, but we gambled and it SO paid off. A lot of places can make a pizza with red sauce, cheese, and pepperoni, but to make a delicious pie with with such non-traditional pizza ingredients definitely showed a glimpse of Spacca's inventiveness.  For the Burrata and one pie the total was $36, which is reasonable. Even with just one pizza we had leftovers (the Burrata is that filling). Next time I go to Spacca Napoli w/ another person I would definitely get 2 pizzas, since they are so yummy. You'll probably have leftovers, but isn't that the point of going out to eat sometimes!  I definitely recommend this place but not sure it deserves 5 stars. The pizza was really good, but the burrata was unnecessary and the service wasn't anything memorable.

Then u cant add extra toppings really i rather eat an american pizza that has a pound of meat n cheese on it. Also i dont like the burnt parts: so because of thay not gonna eat this style of pizza anymore but it is really good jus i dont like this type of pizza i didnt know what to rate it so like a 3??? Fried macaroni balls: this was actually the best fried macaroni balls i ever had the texture outside was really good would have liked it more crunchy though the seasoning was good more pop would have been a nice touch though the inside was perfect the macaroni was not over cooked or undercooked perfect!! Then the pancetta was really good added a nice salty flavor to it there was alot of it! I think it would have been better with more cheese in the inside and it needed a dipping sauce like it was great but that would have made it like outstanding  would order again  Minestra (soup) i love soup but it was really bland. U can tell they just put sausage n rapini in water thats it. The sausage needed to be browned cooking sausage in water is a crime it makes me supper bland. Then rapini u have to do something to it or its gonna be really bitter. The broth had no depth of flavor it needed alot of seasoning. Ik that italians dont like their bread grilled but it needs to be grilled! Arancini: perfectly crunchy the texture of the rice is perfect not gummy or hard. Then its stuffed with cheese omg so good!!!! Best rice ball i ever had the sauce was just a simple marinara sauce it was kinda sour so they need to fix that but id order again Pulpo (grilled octopus) omg omg so tender no knife grilled perfectly so not bitter! Really was deliocus needed a lil salt though. The salad was perfect to cut down the richness of the octopus. The arugula wasnt bitter n the tomatoe added a nice sweet acidity. Use the lemon it makes the octopus taste better! Prosciutto and arugula pizza: the arugula was fresh not supper bitter wit that white paper taste to it. The prosciutto was high quality not the cheap kind from the grocery store idk if its the really expensive one though id have to taste it by itself. The cheese on the pizza was really delicious added a much needed creamyness and rich ness the texture of the pizza was really good not to crunchy not to chewy not to thick not to thin pefect balance and thank god not to burned only criticism was it needed more cheese like alot of cheese like there would be slices with nothing on it!! Then there needs to be more meat because the bitterness of the arugula needs it! Like the salty to bitter ratio was off way too bitter so it needed more meat dont be stingy! Tartufo pizza omg omg omg so good!!! Its so rich! I never had guanciale its so good picture a really rich not smokey bacon.omg soooo good!! Added the saltyness every pizza needs. Only problem put more guanciale plz!!! Dont be stingy!. Omg the cheese i love their cheeze so delicous so rich and creamy but plz put more! Then truffle omg if u never tried it buy it so rich makes anything taste better u gotta put more though comeon man plz put more. Pizza doe to topping ratio is off Diavola: everyone agreed that this was the best. Its so good. The salami is to die for adds that really salty and spicy flavor omg so good! Then the tomato sauce omg to die for this pizza was perfect i could eat the whole thing order this!!!!!!!!!! Margarita pizza i never liked these type of pizza so i cant comment on it i need meat on a pizza,0.9996,0.66,0.265,0.074,0.5749041005291007

Since I had gotten there early, I had put our name down while it still wasn't too busy, as they wouldn't seat me until she was there. While I waited the restaurant filled up pretty quickly and there was a ton of people packed into the small entryway. Since I had known I was getting to the restaurant before my friend, I was banking on being able to sit at the bar and have a drink. However, the restaurant doesn't have any bar seating and everyone is crammed into the entryway/hostess stand area. The hostesses will get you a drink from the bar while you're waiting and will put in on your tab once you are seated. It was a nice gesture, but still the whole waiting thing was cramped and chaotic.  Once we were seated, we had great service and great food. We ordered a bottle of wine (just beer and wine here; no cocktails) and had two appetizers and spit a pizza. We had the daily special of stuffed zuchini blossoms, which I wasn't impressed by, The zuchni was greasy and flacid. We also had the salad with tuna in it; again not impressed.

I guess maybe it's just the pizza that I find to be just average.  I mean, nothing overly adventurous... that's fine, cause I am a pretty basic guy.  But nothing has really been fantastic.  My friends have been only slightly impressed by the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the diavola, my usual go-to, is my personal favorite although just a solid 3.  And I can't quite put my finger on why.  I will give them props to how burnt yet soft they can get their outer crust to be.  Definitely not a place to leave the crust behind (SINNER!) and if you have extra burrata, you should spread it all over.  I guess it really all comes back to the burrata though. Service has been all over the place when I've been there - some overly attentive servers, some who hardly ever stop by.  Tonight we sat for 10 minutes (not what seemed like 10 minutes, I mean, literally 10 minutes) before anyone even stopped by to take our drink order.  My friend was annoyed by the situation and as a result we ended up passing on wine and apps.  Argh.  At least their pizza comes out quickly...because, you know, it really only takes about 1-3 minutes to actually cook the pizza. Also, to note, I have never really had any luck getting a reservation here, even with a fair amount of empty tables in the restaurant; however, I have never really had a problem just walking in and snagging a table with minimal to no wait.  Thankfully I live close enough to take that chance.",0.9867,0.813,0.147,0.04,0.5384920634920635

The Buratta appetizer is a must have, and the antipasti platter is a nice compliment as well. I love the wine selection, they always have some unique and off the radar regional wines that I look forward to trying. If I could make one recommendation it would be that they offer a few more lower priced ($30-40) red wine bottles to make the variety a little more accessible, as it seems most of the selection lingers in the $50+ range, but no stars off for that, since I can't really judge a restaurant based on the limitations of my wallet.

2015-06-19,3.0,"The patio is nice and the food was of great quality, the pizza was tasty and light.  The crust was incredibly thin (almost raw/watery in the center) and chewy as other reviews mention.  I enjoyed the atmosphere for a Thursday night dinner on the patio with my hubby. Overall thoughts: -Wine: ordered a bottle of white.  The wine prices here are completely out of line.  $10/glass, $48/bottle, someone please logically explain to me why the bottle is more expensive when glass pours at most establishments are 6oz. and we all know that's 4 glasses approx. per bottle.   -Appetizers: Prosciutto and melon- good, simple, nothing really to this dish. Small serving of prosciutto.  Caprese salad was great, the mozzarella was delicious. -Pizza: Funghi Sicilia- mushrooms, mozz, evoo, and sausage.  This was about 11"" and sharable just fine, though I did see a lot of people ordering a pizza for themselves.  I suppose this would be good for leftovers.  The crust was too thin for my liking.  It was kind of a spongy, mushy mess in the center and I didn't really like that.  Also needed the red pepper flakes for additional flavor. -Dessert: The panna cotta was the star of the meal.  This was perfection with balsamic over the top, outstanding. Overall it was a 3.5 star experience.  I think the wine pricing is out of line and needs a retool as well as a little bit less doughy crust.  If they could crisp this crust up a bit more it would be much more enjoyable.",0.9903,0.816,0.166,0.018,0.47068854568854573
2015-06-18,4.0,"I have never been to Italy, and to be honest, I prefer pan-pizza to thin. But I enjoyed the pizza I got here, and I enjoyed the overall dining experience. I got the Puttanesca, which was enough for 1 hungry person (or 2 people who aren't very hungry). Here's what the pizza was like:  Crust: Very thin, and droopy when you cut a slice. It tastes great, though--not at all like cardboard and not too toasty.  Red Sauce: Not a lot of it, but it looked like it was made with more whole tomatoes than tomato paste, which is a plus.  Cheese: Perfect amount of cheese--not overloaded, but enough to come off in thin, delicious, gloopy strands.  Toppings: Grape tomatoes, anchovy fillets, black olives, and capers. Looking back on the ingredients list, you'd think that this would be over-the-top salty and briny. However, the flavors were well balanced. The slightly roasted sweetness from the grape tomatoes and the mild cheese were good foils to the briny capers and salty anchovies. And the black olives weren't too salty as well. Great toppings! My only beef was that I wish there was more grated parmesan.    The spumoni was ok (nothing to write home about) and the coffee offered afterwards was a plus. The atmosphere reminded me a lot of Italian restaurants on the east coast. Also, the other dishes besides pizza on the menu looked great--I'd love to come back again and try them!  It was really nice to come here, relax, people-watch (lots of dates going on!), eat some well-made pizza, and enjoy a cup of coffee afterwards.

By that time most other restaraunt options in the neighborhood weren't taking diners. The manager (owner?) was hospitable  and handed out quarter slices of pizza and prosecco. That was a nice touch but our Saturday night was already a write off and what we really wanted was an honest estimation of the wait time. P.S.

The wood oven crust, fresh ingredients, and variety of pizzas sets this place apart, though I do wish they would be a little more generous with their basil toppings.

The real treat here though is the BURRATA.  It's pricey - $15 - but flown in from Italy each week, so make sure you go soon after Thursday! It arrives Thursdays for dinner and is usually out by Sunday.  It is creamy heaven for cheese lovers and topped with sea salt and high quality olive oil.

The first time I tried Spacca was years ago on a first date but as a dumb freshman in college, I made no mental note of the name of the restaurant or it's location. I just always thought of it as ""that magical place that sold really good pizza that was completely different than late-night Sarpinos"".  Well then I ended up dating a hardcore Italian for four years, studying abroad in Rome, and getting my ducks in a row about legit Neapolitan pizza. Five years later, I stumbled upon Spacca again while perusing the Ravenswood Artwalk and had a bit of an epiphany that I didn't actually make the whole restaurant up. Now I live 10 minutes away and go all the time.  Spacca's pizza is the closest you'll get to pizza straight from Italy. The crust is always done to perfection and the toppings are fresh and delicious. Make sure you order the burrata cheese as an appetizer when it's a special. I inhale burrata whenever I see it on a menu but their's is the creamiest and best I've had (the second best being Bar Toma downtown).  Service is always great and since it literally takes seconds to cook your pizza in their brick ovens, it's the perfect restaurant if you're in a hurry but still want to sit down with your food.  Forno Rosso on the Northwest side would be my other top choice for Neapolitan pizza in Chicago but Spacca wins with more options of toppings and pizza's that I actually ate in Italy, better sauce (Forno's is a little watery with less flavor) and a larger and more comforting dining area.

Also, we understand this place is not a bar which is why we had also ordered over $70 worth of food. We are professionals in our thirties out for a nice meal and were being very respectful of the restaurant and the other guests. And we enjoy drinking wine. We were very offended by this so we talked to the owner who also made a couple rude comments to us because he had to ""defend his waiter"". All we were looking for was an explanation as to why we were being denied service which was never given to us. Instead of any sort of legitimate explanation we received multiple rude comments.

The prosciutto and arugula pizza was by far my favorite. I don't know what they do to their meats but you can taste the smokey flavor in the prosciutto. Beyond delicious. I loved everything about it. 5 stars because while we waited the chef brought us mini pizza slices.",0.9724,0.813,0.187,0.0,0.6522727272727272

At dessert I sampled both the tiramisu and the tartufo with a cappuccino and all were delicious. Another taste treat was the Italian peach tea!  Two things prevented me giving the place 5 stars: our party of four was seated at a tiny table and there was barely enough room to fit our four individual pizzas plus drinks upon. Additionally, we had to each slice our own pizzas - a daunting task when there isn't enough room (and we are all small people). If you are a foursome (or even a threesome), my advice would be for you to request two tables be joined together, giving you enough elbow room to eat comfortably.",0.9781,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.5911111111111113

When I moved to the States a couple of years ago, a friend took me there and I was shocked at how good the pizza is... being born and raised in Italy, I think this is a genuine compliment! You can see it's a good place by how always full this place is, any day of the week basically. So, if you're going there on a weekend, be sure to make a reservation.  All the pizzas I have tried were great, honestly. There is a standard menu and then there is always a daily specialty which varies from day to day.  I recently tried the Capricciosa and the Puttanesca, which were both great, but also the Bufalina e and the classic Margherita are awesome! And... there is a type of pizza they use to make, which is no longer on the menu but you can try to ask for: BiancoNero, with truffle and fresh tomatoes... I love it!! It's definitely worth trying if you like truffles! Prices are ok, and commesurate to the quality of food. Besides pizza, if you want an appetizer to share, try the mozzarella di bufala (awesome), and the prosciutto.

It reminded me of a sponge covered in sauce -- chewy and soft -- no thanks. I must preface this by stating that the quality of ingredients used on the pizza (from the cheese to the toppings to the sauce) are excellent. Over all, I rate the Pizza at 3 stars. In the end, I ended up ordering a pasta dish, which was fairly decent. Dessert (there are two ""S"" in ""Dessert"") oh dessert -- we ordered the Zabaglione which is a famous Italian custard dessert that is usually served with sliced fresh fruit or berries and Gelato which were both worthy of four stars.

The calzone was a bit undercooked inside but crispy outside. The taste was alright. The pizzas, one Margarita, one Putanesca, both had too much juice on top, So, the crust is a bit soggy. Even the server thought it's wetter that normal. They redid the putanesca pizza. It came out a bit better but it's still wet and  the crust is not crispy. Overall, the flavor of food is just average.

My favorite pizza here is hands down the Bianca Funghi (I believe is the name). It's not always on the menu - as usually it's a special - but ask and you shall most likely receive! It consists of mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, and truffle oil. SO GOOD. Don't forget to try their special olive oil and red pepper blend on your pizza. It's not that spicy and so very very awesome. It really does add to the overall pizza eating experience. Last time we stopped in they had an amazing Calzone special going. Huge fluffy breading, stuffed with ham and cheese goodness. Very tasty! Their hazelnut and chocolate gelato is SO GOOD. I stop in just to get some togo quite often. I think the hazelnut is probably the best I've ever had - and I did a two week trip in Italy sampling gelato everywhere so that's saying something. The chairs are a bit uncomfortable but overall the place is pleasant and interestingly decorated. It really does feel authentic. Great for groups!

2014-04-02,4.0,"I went to Spacca Napoli for my birthday dinner, having wanted to go since last May when I realized it was a 5 minute drive from my apartment. I've been here once about 10 years ago and I remember it being delicious but I didn't remember HOW CRAZY DELICIOUS it was. I hesitate to give 5 stars right away just in case that next time I go everything is terrible and I feel foolish for giving such immediate high praise but Spacca Napoli is probably a 5 star. Definitely a HIGH 4 star.  To start we ordered the Caprese con Bufala. I cannot even begin to tell you how delicious and fresh this was. I have never had such delicious mozzarella in my life (I've never been to Italy though, so I can't compare). Nice thick slices of mozzarella di bufala served with thin slices of bread drizzled with olive oil, fresh tomatoes and basil on the side. Now this is how bruschetta should be done. The bread was not hard or crunchy so that it was impossible to bite through or so that it cuts up the roof of your mouth. Perfect, chewy bread acts as the perfect vehicle for the most delicious mozzarella and fresh tomatoes and basil. So simple but so delicious and fresh.  We decided to split 2 pizzas so we could try more than one type. Certainly more food than we needed but we happily took home leftovers. We ordered 1 red sauce pizza and 1 olive oil pizza, the Funghi e Salsiccia and the Sorrentina. The first was mushroom, Italian sausage, basil, mozzarella, and pecorino with red sauce. The latter of the pizzas was fresh tomatoes, mozzarella and basil with olive oil. They were both incredibly delicious. Their crust is fantastic, soft, chewy, not tough, not crunchy. I know everyone has their own personal opinion on what kind of crust they like but for me this is perfect, the pizza itself is thin but not crunchy, the crust is fluffy, chewy and soft. All of the ingredients were fresh and delicious, there is really nothing I could complain about. My boyfriend liked the Funghi e Salsiccia the best because he usually wants meat on his pizza and I liked the Sorrentina the most because margarita style pizza is pretty much my favorite but we both loved the other pizza too.  To end we had to have dessert (it was my birthday after all) and we tried the Tartufo. I don't know if I'll explain it properly but its a ball of Zabaglione rolled in chocolate gelato mousse rolled in hazelnuts and cocoa powder. I think that's right. IT WAS AMAZING. I'm glad I didn't just go with the usual Tiramisu, although I'm sure that is delicious there too.  Spacca Napoli is truly a great neighborhood pizza joint that is sooo much more than just a ""joint"". It's surprisingly well priced and everything tastes so fresh and delicious and it is dangerously close to my apartment. (BY THE WAY .... They have anise flavored candies at the front counter.

Last but not least, the classic Margherita - this is a MUST.  Such a clean taste with the perfect marriage of sweet and salty.  This is the pie that brings me back to the taste and texture of Naples' pizza. Overall, the texture of Spacca Napoli's pizzas are spot on.  Enough of a chew for enjoyment of the pizza as opposed to so much chew that you leave with your jaw hurting.   Almost forgot, we also ordered the Tartufo - a creamy hazelnut gelato ball of some sort...sorry,  that description sucks, but that's what I can mainly remember.  I'm still dreaming of the pizza, which is obviously the reason to come visit!  I'm already looking forward returning to order more Margherita pizza =)",0.9911,0.784,0.182,0.034,0.48198728354978354

It's a bit of a trek for us since we hail from Logan Square, but it was beyond worth it. The space is open and bright, energetic and bustling, and the service is friendly and attentive. Case in point, someone was passing out fresh foccacia to those poor suckers who didn't make reservations and had to wait. Like us.  We started off with the burrata appetizer (because you don't ever say no to burrata) and oh good lord, it was divine. So creamy and soft, but with a light and delicate flavor. It was perfect with the crunchy, grilled bread, of which they gave us plenty. And because there's no such thing as too much cheese and bread, we ordered 3 pizzas to split between 4 of us:  The Bufalina - simple, classic, and light. Crispy, chewy crust with nice little charred bits. The Porcini e Carciofi - I'm not a huge fan of white pizzas, largely because I think cheese and tomato are like the Italian equivalent of PB & J (they just GO together), but this one was tasty. Especially after a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. The Special - romesco sauce, leeks, Italian sausage. The most robust flavor-wise of the 3 pies, it was the favorite of the table.

If that doesn't sound delicious, there's nothing I can do to help you.  The slight char on the crust from the wood oven balanced the fresh green arugula, and the salami added a fantastic pungency and richness.  Trying to figure out how to eat it took some thought  (unlike you Midwesterners, my first instinct is to eat it with my hands, not a fork and knife). The thin, crispy crust lent itself to folding, but it was almost too delicate to pick up with so much on top.

What's more, their menu screams ""let us take you on a European cheese tour!"" Their pizza is relatively light and all of the ingredients deliver pronounced, fresh, and complementary tastes.  I really like how they craft satisfying pizzas without resorting to a kitchen sink routine.  Instead, they make sure that everything that's on the pizza, while limited in number and sensible in quantity, is selectively chosen and done just right.  Several ingredients were completely foreign to me.  Trying out all the new and unusual cheeses was one of the highlights of our meal.  We got the salsiccia and the quattro formaggi pizzas, and both were excellent.    The Salsiccia drew me in with Italian sausage, with mild spiciness really adding to the overall taste, plus we got to taste pecorino cheese for the first time.  European cheese destination #1: pecorino is from the Sassari area of Sardinia, in Italy.  The quattro formaggi pizza included emmantal cheese, which was also new to us.  European cheese destination #2: Emmantal cheese has geographical tradename significance, as it usually comes from the Emmantal region of Switzerland.  Lastly, the fontina cheese was uncharted territory for me.  European cheese destination #3: fontina originally comes from the Aosta Valley of the Italian Alps.  All of this comes together to deliver delicious eats with the added benefit of being not-so-heavy. Set-up wise, Spacca Napoli is a great place to take out of town guests or visiting family members for a casual meal.  It's clean and spacious inside, kid-friendly, and we found the waitstaff very informed about what's listed on the menu.  The patio is also a comfortable option when it's warm out.  After our meal and on our way out, the hostess was handing out complementary miniature cannolis, topping off an already great eating experience.",0.9929,0.843,0.145,0.012,0.4416752559609704

2014-01-02,4.0,"Loved Spacca Napoli! I made a reservation for 8 girls on a Saturday night around 7pm and they were easily able to accommodate us which was very nice! When we came in only 4 of us were there so we had to wait a little because the hostess told us the whole party had to be there before we could be seated. Here I thought this was a bummer so I sat down on their little wooden bench to admire the place. It was packed, wine was flowing and pizza was coming out for every table. To my surprise the hostess brings each of the 4 girls that were already there some wine and said ""here's something while you wait"" I mean that warrants like 5 stars by itself, that's the kind of service I'd expect but never receive, so Spacca, you're a winner in my book. Once we were seated we ordered some more wine which was about $8 a glass and it was good, but I would have preferred wine glasses rather than just cups, but I can see how these are safer.  We ordered two pizzas with my 3 girlfriends, the Funghi and the Prosciutto. The funghi which was $13 is considered a red pizza with red tomato sauce and lots of mushrooms and mozzarella and basil, it was delicious. Super fresh and loved the doughy bread. It was literally like going to Naples without having to pay for the flight to Italy and I've eaten pizza in Naples so this came exceptionally close. We also got the prosciutto pizza for $16 which was the white pizza with no red sauce and it's more about the bread, the cheese and the prosciutto, also delicious. I can't say which I liked more but next time I would probably just try the simple margharita pizza. I guess when the pizza dough is that good, it doesn't matter what you put on top of it. The atmosphere was super casual, so I had my simple jeans on, had lots of wine with the girls and chatted the night away. I would definitely come back here since I felt like the prices were reasonable and the portions were fair. My friends also got the Tortufo and the Tiramisu for dessert, both of which were tasty (of course I had to take a bite). Oh and the salads my other girls got also looked fresh and tasty. We had a great time, our server was just okay, didn't say he was the best we had, but he did his job and didn't mess anything up. But the best part was when leaving, we each got a mini cannoli to go, this was around 9:30pm so they were running out and my 8th friend didn't get one. She wasn't upset, but I was happy that I got to try it, since it was also super fresh and had just the right amount of sweetness.

2013-12-26,5.0,"What Italian review cannot be concluded with Spacca Napoli? Spacca Napoli is a pretty faithful to Italy style Italian pizza place. This is not your mom and dad's Italian food restaurant consisting of ""pasta"" and ""pizza"" and ""Italian salad"" similar to Dave's in Evanston, this is the real, true to Italy style of Italian food which is far less generic.   From the get-go we have: Burrata. Fresh and delicious burrata imported from Italy - and tasting just as delicious. Do not come here and not get burrata unless you simply cannot eat cheese or don't. It's excellent and sadly most ""traditional american Italian"" restaurants never provide it fresh. Oh, and it's a very plentiful amount of Burrata.  Get it when they have it.  Salad was very faithful to Italy too, with a number of varieties of Italian olives that are not pitted - including those bright green ones. Then we get to the pizza - again, wonderful Italian style - these are the kinds of pizza options we saw in Italy, which also leads to a single tiny downfall that most people won't notice: Italian food is absolutely not even remotely spicy by average american standards. So the diavola pizza which was declared to be spicy? It would fit right in with Italy but anyone expecting a kick to it probably wouldn't notice.  The style of mushroom pizza they have again, is also very faithful - and very delicious. They actually use the types of mushrooms you would see in Italy, not the kind you get on a deep dish pizza in Chicago.  So what you have is not Chicago style, but Italian style - and in that sense, they deliver both literally and in terms of cuisine - extremely well.  There's a reason this place has a reputation for good food, and they clearly work hard and deserve it.

I can't help but get a margherita but recommend trying from their white pizzas which include artichokes, lots of cheeses, mushrooms, etc. Portions can be tricky if there are odd numbers in your party, but I would do one per hungry person if there's no apps.  They have a good wine list, but count on bottles being at least $30 on the cheaper end.  They are a family kind of restaurant so my dinner experience had two children screaming and running around their table within earshot. No one else seemed to care so I went with the flow, but it might not be ideal for a romantic kind of evening.

Spacca Napoli's bufalina pizza was on the list and it did not disappoint. I have been to Naples and what you will notice about the pizza there is how soft and slightly spongy the crust is and it has to do with the flour they use (not the all purpose garbage we have in America) and the water (insert your own US vs Europe water comment here). I arrived on a Friday night around 7pm and the wait was only 10 minutes. I started with an eggplant appetizer that was great and very fresh. There were many options for pizza to choose from but I went with what was tested. Wow. Ask for a cutter to do the honors yourself but it is worth it. The crust was the best part for sure.

(Ok, spelling is a problem for me today, sorry) and one of the daily specials.  That one was a white pizza, with buffalo mozzarella, ricotta, mushrooms.  I think there was also pixie dust and angel kisses, that's how good this pizza was.  The curst was perfect - bubbly and tasty and crisp.  Topping were fresh and plentiful.  Both pizzas were perfect. We were too full for dessert, but promised we'd try them on our return visits. We were then gifted Moscato. The staff was so friendly, knowledgeable, not pushy, but there when you needed something.   Lovely lovely lovely.",0.9917,0.748,0.216,0.036,0.5767857142857142

I had a really big lunch so I was not able to eat my own pizza but I stole a few bites here and there so I can yelp this place. Dedicated, aren't I?  The waiter informed us that their pizza selections with no red sauce were less popular. After trying pizzas with and without red sauce, I thought it did not make a difference. Although, I can assure you that  it was no Little Caesar's. The pizza crust was very different from any kind that I have had before.  It was thin, somewhat fluffy and chewy but it was not delectable. I mean like after taking one bite, you are not like, 'omg! It was so good I need to keep eating!' It was more like, 'well..it tasted alright, I guess I should finish it. I shouldn't waste food.'  Note: I noticed that many people didn't realize that you get a free cannoli when you leave (their equivalence of a fortune cookie; free dessert after a meal) since sometimes the hostesses are too busy to hand them out. Make sure you get one even if you have to wait for it. Trust me, it is so worth it. The shell was crispy, the filling was mildly sweet, and the pistachio gave it a great texture. It was definitely one of the better cannolis I have had in Chicago.",0.995,0.7,0.231,0.068,0.49763409961685834

2013-06-03,5.0,"Some good friends of ours discovered this place, and brought us, because they felt the pizza was too good not to share. They were right. I have dreams about this pizza. So, you might be thinking of the traditional 'Chicago' pizza - BIG, with plenty to share. Order one, and the entire table shares, grabbing those small, square slices, right? Not here. Everyone needs to get their own pizza, and I swear - after eating one, you might be full, but you'll be tempted into ordering a 2nd pie. Yes, it's THAT good.  Before I get back to the pizza, though, I want to tell you about two of my favorite appetizers: the Caprese con Bufala (Caprese Salad) and Proscuitto e Bufala. The first is a basic caprese salad: fresh buffalo mozzarella, roma tomatoes, olive oil, fresh leaves of basil and some balsamic vinegar. I'm a sucker for anything 'caprese', and this is the real deal. As for the proscuitto e bufala - it's a platter of freshly sliced, well, proscuitto, with a HUGE blob of fresh buffalo mozzarella. It's difficult for me to not just snarf up the whole tray - definitely brings out the 'No - get - your - own - platter' beast in me, like nothing else. (As I typed this, I remembered the last time I had this platter, and now my mouth is watering...) But the pizza - everyone needs to order their own pie. There's no problem with sharing slices, but, honestly, trust me on this: everyone needs to order their own pizzas. Usually, I opt for the 'Funghi e Salsiccia', or sausage & mushroom. I think you get an awesome mix of sauce, fresh buffalo mozzarella, mushrooms and italian sausage, all on a crisp crust.Yum. If they have it, try with the peach iced tea - you'll get an adorable, oh-so-European bottle of San Benedetto Peach Ice Tea, and now I'm addicted to that stuff. I haven't tried the desserts, and I don't drink anything alcoholic, so I can't speak to those aspects. The service is always prompt. The food is always fresh, and I can't wait to go back and snarf down a platter of proscuitto e buffala and have my funghi e salsiccia pizza! Manga!",0.9946,0.766,0.182,0.052,0.5399281934996221

My husband had one with the Italian sausage and spinach. It was good too but he liked mine more. The other people I spent dinner with enjoyed theirs. One of them ordered one with porcini mushrooms which look like beef chunks on the pizza. After pizza, we all shared a tiramisu which was very good.

It was served chilled, which made it taste surprisingly delicious. We really loved this wine. My wife ordered the funghi pizza which is mushroom. I had the sausage pizza. Both were outstanding. What is really cool is that they give you your own slicer to cut it however you want.

However, each of my visits to Spacca, they had it available, so I'm guessing it's a semi-permanent appetizer. For our main course, we of course ordered pizza. We decided to do one red (pizze rose) and one white/cream (pizze bianche). They separate the menu based on these two categories.  1. Salciccia - mozerella, basil, italian sausage, and pecorino. This must be their 'heaviest pizza'. The homemade red sauce makes this pizza taste amazing. I like that their crust is a little charred, and I mean a little. It gives a charcoal/wood burnt flavor perfectly pulling all the flavors together. The serving is good for 1-2 people. 1 for a male definitely.   2. Prosciutto e Rucola- provola, prosciutto, arugula, and parmiagano. This pizza blew me away. Mainly because it was very light but very flavorful. I sat there and savored the medley of flavors for a few seconds. It can also be because I really love good prosciutto and arugula. What a combo. This is my go-to pizza when I visit Spacca.  We finished off with the Tiramisu- this was simply okay.  The atmosphere is very family-friendly. It's true, it feels like a suburb but this is North Center, million dollar homes and young families all over.  I would definitely recommend them for anyone who wants to experience a truly authentic Neapolitan pizze! Grazie tanto Spacca Napoli!",0.997,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.4513660714285715

I hit up Spacca Napoli with a friend to check out some of their pizza.  I have been here on a few different occasions and each time, the food was good.  But this time, I was really disappointed and I don't think that I'll be back. We started with the Caprese con Bufala Salad appetizer.  I was expecting a mozzarella / basil / tomato salad with some balsamic drizzle but it was more like pieces of oily toast along with mozzarella, basil and tomato.  The bread was way too oily and I just didn't find the dish particularly flavorful.  I was willing to chalk it up to the season -- being winter and Chicago and all, perhaps the tomatoes and the basil were  just not up to par.  We then split the Salsiccia Pizza and the Prosciutto Pizza (both Neopolitan style).  I liked the Salsiccia Pizza -- the sausage was nice and spicy and flavorful however the taste did not overpower the rest of the ingredients on the pizza.  I was disappointed in the Prosciutto Pizza -- I always love a good white pitta with prosciutto and arugula but the texture of the Prosciutto seemed off and it just wasn't as flavorful as I wanted it to be.  Sizes of the pizzas are good to split if you order a salad or an appetizer.  I don't think that I could have eaten a whole one by myself.   Prices seemed high for what we got, although the wine was a bargain -- $6 glasses of Montepulciano (and large pours at that). Service was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Our waiter didn't offer up the specials -- we had to ask for them -- which always bothers me (although if the food would have been terrific, this probably would not have been as big of a deal).   The space is nice although we were in a rather cramped table up against the window.  It wasn't busy and we had a reservation, so I wish they had put us at a better table, but again, it wouldn't have bothered me as much if I thought the food was spectacular. Overall, I don't think I'll be back -- especially since I have to eat my way through all of the other pizza places in the City.",0.9923,0.849,0.129,0.022,0.507563492063492

The Salsiccia Pizza was my favorite part of our meal (other than the glasses of Multipulciano which only cost $6.50 ).  The sausage was super tasty and the flavors worked.  The Prosciutto e Rucola Pizza was borderline disgusting.  The Proscuitto was too smoky and the wrong texture - it was slimy!!  For less than half the price, you can get an amazing Prosciutto Pizza at Mariano's. Other than the $6.50 bargain on the wine, I think the food is overpriced.  Three glasses of wine, a puny appetizer and two pizzas cost $66.   I have to mention the overly erect chairs - too erect for a chair and so uncomfortable.  And the lighting was too bright - like a suburban diner. Parking is easy.   Service could improve.  We had to ask for the specials and felt a bit rushed.   With all the good pizza options in Chicago, I don' think I'll be returning to Spacca Napoli anytime soon.",0.9883,0.786,0.164,0.049,0.5724489795918367

Anyway, we've developed unreasonably high expectations over the years from a handful of great pizzas here and there, and I've discovered that the chasm between ""good"" and ""great"" pizza is a huge one.   Spacca Napoli tries mightily to make this leap but doesn't quite get there.  As the restaurant's name suggests, this place is about Neopolitan-style thin-crust individualized pizzas baked at super-high temps to achieve those tell-tale black char marks of deliciouness, and served with super-fresh sauce and toppings.  The pizzas pretty much succeeded in every way except that the crust --other than at its outer edges --  was almost soggy, especially in the center.  (And yeah, a Napoletana is supposed to have SOME sog at the center.)  At $11-15, I think they're a worthwhile value for the size; we couldn't finish ours.   I mostly agree with the complaints here about the salad prices, but the simple insalata eoliana--with fingerling potatoes, argulua, tuna, tomatoes, and capers--was terrific and refreshing. I don't really have a problem with the wine served in those glasses old Italian guys use.  It's actually pretty authentic, at least in a non-upscale place, especially when the wines are largely pretty modest.

It's Neopolitan style pizza which you don't see too much of in Chicago. The pizzas look like they might serve two people but they're thin and oh so amazing so be sure to order one per person - you won't want to share. Everyone at my table ordered their own pizza and only one person didn't finish it. I don't mind tomato sauce but I'm not the biggest fan so it was like a dream come true to see that half their pizzas came without tomato sauce. I ordered the Quattro Formaggi. It was some of the best pizza I've ever had. It was hard to decide what to order because in addition to the variety of pizzas on the menu, there were three pizza specials for the day. The waiter was extremely patient and helpful, and the pizzas seemed to take less than 10 minutes so cook so there wasn't much waiting around.

Spacca Napoli Pizzeria takes its pizza seriously by staying true to authentic preparation and fresh ingredients. The restaurant itself has a nice outside patio and the dining rooms (4 separate areas) are airy and bright thanks to the huge windows. Black and white photos and old world portraits decorate the walls with pretty tile throughout. The staff and space are warm and inviting.  The pizza is divided into Pizze Rosse and Pizze Bianche. We went with the special for the day Tre Pomodori and Bufalina, which is on the regular menu. The server let us know that the Tre Pomodori was the way to go as it had fresh yellow and red cherry tomatoes that are season. Along with sundried tomatoes and olives. The olives provided a nice salty balance to the sweetness of the tomatoes. The crust was charred just the right amount from the wood fired oven. The Bufalina has basil, mozzarella di bufala, olive oil with red sauce. Very simple yet I have a feeling it is not easy to make such a good pizza despite the basic ingredients. The beauty with this style of pizza is that you can eat several slices as they are not overloaded with toppings and feel satisfied and not go directly into a food coma. This also means.... dessert. The Zabaglio which was new to all of us at the table. The menu describes it as a creamy custard made with Marsala wine. I did taste a hint of alcohol but could not distinguish it as Marsala wine but it didn't matter, I will be having this dessert again. It was surprisingly light for custard and nice and sweet. Last but not least Spumoni. I remember having this as a child and wanted to see if I remembered the taste. Not sure what took me so long to get this again but I am glad I did.

First off, the space is expansive and inviting; the latter can also describe the staff who, despite the crowds and our lack of reservation, was willing to accommodate our request to hold our table until 6:30 with relative ease. Now for the important stuff: the pizza. All of the pizzas are served on a thin yet impressively soft sourdough crust, roasted to a delectable crisp in an Old World oven. Aside from *maybe* Great Lake, this is the best crust in the city that I have tried. We sampled four pizzas; Funghi e Salsiccia ($14), Broccolette e Salsiccia ($15), Bianco Nero ($16, involving porcini mushrooms, black truffle, and white truffle oil) and a special pizza topped with Guanciale and a fried egg ($16). All of the ingredients are of highest quality; the sausage is spicy and not unpleasantly greasy, the broccoli rabe is bitter but not unpleasantly so, fried egg is cooked to an impressive degree of perfection, and the truffle on the Bianco Nero is easily detectable but not overwhelming. Wine list is long and cheap. What's not to love?! All in all, Spacca Napoli deserves its spot in the pantheon of Chicago pizza joints, largely because it so effectively captures the magic of Neapolitan-style pizza.

2012-08-04,4.0,"Four stars hands down if you know what Neapolitan style pizza entails, but pegging it against the typical pizza that Chicago has to offer, you'll be sorely disappointed. My boyfriend and I decided to go to Spacca around 7pm without a reservation, and we were able to walk up and get a table outside without a wait! Upon being seated our waitress came over to tell us of the specials for the evening (there were several!) and took our drink orders. We both decided to try a traditional Merreti style beer, and this came out promptly after we ordered. After pouring over the menu we picked out an appetizer and a pizza that we wanted for our meal. They were as follows: 1) Prosciutto e Bufala (Prosciutto crudo, mozzarella di bufala, basil): My oh my. This appetizer made me change all of my previous thoughts/ideas about what prosciutto and mozzarella cheese entailed. I was blown away by how fresh and flavorful this dish was. The mozzarella had an almost ricotta like texture to it and was incredibly flavorful. This wasn't your dry and squeaky run of the mill mozzarella cheese, it was so much more and you'll never go back to what your local grocer offers. Hell, I'd go there just to buy a piece of this cheese off of them. As for the prosciutto, it was also very flavorful and had the right amount of salt. This paired with the mozzarella was unreal, and a small bite of the basil with each forkful of meat and cheese was outstanding. I'd come here just to have this appetizer time and time again. One of the best appetizers I've ever had, and as it should be considering it cost a whopping $15. 2) Diavola Pizza (Mozzarella di Bufala, Spicy Salami, Red Pepper Flakes, Basil): Apparently we just couldn't stay away from the Bufala cheese and had to get it on this pizza. This pizza was your typical ""pepperoni"" pizza, but... so much more. The base was incredibly thin, but a large crust was present--and extremely airy and fluffy. The tomato sauce was freshly made and flavorful, and it went well with the scattered cheese and salami, lightly spiced with the red pepper flakes. My only ""gripe"" about this pizza was that you had to cut it yourself, and all of the toppings seemed to come off with the first bite. That aside, it was incredibly fresh and tasty! The service was attentive and spot on, from the busboys to the waitress. Everyone was extremely nice inside and helpful, I can't say anything bad about this aspect of the business. All in all, I had a great experience, but it is pricey for what you get. We walked away still a little hungry, and I think the norm (someone correct me if I'm wrong?) is to get more than one pizza? When we inhaled our pizza, one of the busboys asked if he could clear away our dishes if we weren't planning on getting another pizza.

I ordered the margherita which is my favorite at this type of pizza place. Their pizza is super soggy. The ""toppings"" area is a soggy lake with blackened bottom areas and the outer edge crust, which takes up about 1/3 of the pizza is basically inedible, charred and completely lacking in flavor (unless you count the flavor of burntness) or character; chewy and that's about it. I love a good edge crust so the fact that I only ate the inside and discarded the edges on the plate is sacrilege! The ""basil"" on this model was a token 1/2 a leaf scattered randomly, I had to ask for more basil so the waiter brought me a plate of chopped basil. The mozzarella and the tomato sauce is first-rate, as to be expected. It's probably my fault, I get the idea from other Yelp reviews that you are ""supposed"" to like this pizza as it is authentic, etc. I must compare this to  Antica in Andersonville which is similar but MUCH better.

2012-05-16,4.0,"I'll start by saying, this place has some damn good pizza.  Came here on a Wednesday night with a party of 4 and had a great time. When you walk in, you notice immediately that the space is awesome. I've never been to Italy, but the decor seemed authentic, and traditional without going over the top. Service was prompt and solid. For antipasti, we split the prosciutto and arugula salad. The meat was good, but could have been a bit livelier. Not the best I've had, but good stuff nonetheless. The salad and bread which accompanied the dish was average. I also tried a bit of the Insalata Di Mare which is poached calamari, cuttlefish, shrimp, celery, and olives. The texture of each part of this dish impressed me the most, but the flavor could've stood out more.  On to the star of the show, the pizza. I really enjoyed the Neapolitan style, and am looking forward to going back and getting more. Frankly, I've reached a point of boredom with Pizza in Chicago. When I first moved here, I went nuts over deep dish and then quickly got tired of it, so this style was a much needed chance of pace. I went with the Salsiccia, which has fresh Mozzarella, Basil and Italian Sausage. The freshness of the ingredients was obvious, and the depth of flavor in the crust was awesome.  The only downside to this style, was the thinness of the crust in the middle. It's so thin, that it became very soggy and broke apart easily. Being new to Neapolitan, this may just be an inherent side effect of the style, but it is a slight drawback. Nonetheless it was all delicious. I paired this with a somewhat mediocre red wine, the Cerasulo. Although I was looking for a lighter wine, this must've been too light as I thought it was bland.  Last but certainly not least was the dessert. Being a big tiramisu fan, I was obligated to grab some of their version. Extremely well done stuff, definitely some of the better Tiramisu I've ever had. It was well balanced, and not too soggy or too cakey, nor was it overrun with too much mascarpone. It was all in nice proportion with great richness and sweetness. Went well with a high quality cappuccino.  Overall Verdict: This place gets 4 stars from me for the great pizza, delicious tiramisu, awesome vibe/atmosphere, and quality service. It loses a star because of the overall average nature of the appetizers, and the mediocre wine I had. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great pizza experience.",0.9988,0.712,0.247,0.041,0.5417171717171716
2012-05-12,2.0,"I'm sorry but I'm not a fan of this place.  I do not like the style of pizza that they serve in Naples.  I like more cheese and I don't like my crust to be burnt.  Seriously, when you get your pizza, the bottom of it and the top of the crust is just black and I hate that.  We had the fried zucchini and that was okay but I really did hate my Margherita pizza.  I would have rather went to Pizza Hut over this place because at least they don't burn your crust there.  It seems like a nice place to go and have some wine and appetizers and chat with your friends though.  It is just not my style of pizza that I like to eat.  I'm sure I would like to go again sometime and just try to see if the pizza if any better but I doubt it because my friend's pizza was burnt too.  I guess it just depends on what kind of pizza you like if you would want to go here.  I like more of a thicker crust pizza with more cheese so this is not a good place for me to go if I'm wanting really good filling pizza.  Now if you like really thin crust that is burnt with big air bubbles in the crust sometimes and not a lot of sauce or cheese then this is the place for you to go.  I suspect people from Naples probably think of pizza as more of an appetizer and maybe that is why it is so light.  Pizza was not invented in Italy though, it was invented in New York by Italian Americans, so I think we do it better over here than they do in Europe.  I was shocked though when I watched The Girls Next Door a long time ago and they said they liked the Olive Garden's food more than what they were getting in Italy.  I would like to go over there and see what I think too, but I do know I don't like their pizza.  They do have a nice little selection of desserts though and I maybe would want to try some of their wines sometime but I'm just not sure if I want to have burnt pizza placed in front of me again.  Plus I thought the service that night was pretty slow and it really agitated me because I wanted to leave sooner.",-0.9681,0.761,0.093,0.146,0.5856200897867564

I HIGHLY recommend you ask about the specials. They have never disappointed me. Listen to what your server has to say and trust their recommendations. They know the menu inside and out. The food! Oh, the food! Most recently, my girlfriend and I tried one of their specials. It was a buffalo mozzarella cheese ball, injected with another cheese (possibly ricotta?) and topped with butter. They served it with fresh, toasted bread. Absolutely amazing. My girlfriend got the grilled vegetables, which were also delicious. I'm not a veggie lover, and even I liked these. We elected to get a traditional pizza margherita. It was delicious. It was cooked perfectly. The dough was thin, but had a good substance to it, I didn't feel like I was eating off a cracker.

2012-04-19,5.0,"I basically joined Yelp to rave about this place. I was browsing the low reviews of Spacca Napoli for kicks, and I have to laugh at those who say the pizza is ""soggy"". Oh, you silly Philistines, that is because this is real, fresh cheese, not the processed melted-disc garbage ""cheese"" you get at Domino's.  In Italy, this is how pizza is made. You eat it with a knife and fork (I know, what a slog, when we Americans love to shove things in our faces) to really enjoy and savor your experience. Neapolitan pizzaioli are akin to artists, as they should be, and Spacca Napoli pays perfect tribute to their overseas counterparts. I can tell why this is considered the only true Neapolitan pizza in America-- it's exactly what you would expect in Southern Italy.  I've been coming here for years, now, and every time I think I just want the Margherita, their daily specials always steer me in another direction. The ingredients in the specials are original, ever-changing, and so fresh! I feel like telling them they should call me whenever the fig and gorgonzola is the special because I WILL come in. However, don't think that pizza is all they do well here. Don't forget to ask your waiter or waitress what the daily Fritti is-- I guarantee you will love it no matter what it is, though.  Save room for dessert and try any of their seriously awesome gelatos (especially pistachio with whole pistachios and the banana!) or be adventurous and try the panna cotta, which is the best I've had in the city.

I could see where this could have been really good, the potential was there. I am not trying to be insulting, but had my 16 year old been there - he would have said Pizza Hut is better.

2012-04-04,4.0,"Freshness abounds at this neaopolitan style pizza place. With a custom oven and promises of authentic Italian pizza (and Nutella!), I was excited to try it out. We got a pretty solid variety of pizza, and I think we chose well for our first time. But I'm going to have to go back to try the other variations on the menu... FOOD Insalata di Mare - Seafood Salad:  At $10, this was a pretty good deal. Nothing too special about the bread itself, but the seafood (poached calamari, cuttlefish, and shrimp) was pretty fresh and wasn't ruined by dumping a bunch of batter all over everything and frying the whole lot. I think they can afford to put in a couple more olives, though. Funghi e Salsiccia - Mushroom, Sausage, Basil, and Fresh Mozzarella Pizza:  Our server recommended that we get both a red and a white pizza to give both a try. Done. We opted to go for the mushroom and sausage pizza, and the housemade sausage was AWESOME. The sausage wasn't overseasoned with a salt-mine's worth of sodium, and it wasn't greasy. We were told that the crust is the star at Spacca Napoli (more on that later), but I don't think that's a free pass for a blander-than-expected red sauce. Maybe it's subdued on purpose to let the fresh ingredients shine through more, maybe they don't think it's bland. But it could stand to be more aggressive. I love a flavorful sauce.  I had two problems with the crust; one, it was too salty, both by itself (when eating the crust) and in combination with the toppings. Two, the high moisture content of the fresh mozzarella soaks through the paper thin crust at the center and makes the pizza pretty soggy. For some reason, it still works, albeit it is a little unsettling. This was supposed to have basil on it and I'm sure you can see the pathetic attempt at it...but it was disappointing that they only included what amounted to one basil leaf. More basil = more balance. Oh well. Bianca con Bufala e Rucola - Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Arugula: The second was a white pizza made with buffalo mozzarella and topped with fresh and crispy arugula. Olive oil played the red sauce's normal role here. Buffalo mozz is a lot creamier than regular mozzarella, but retains the same high moisture content, so the same issues with the crust that I mentioned about are the same here. The extra creaminess of the cheese is definitely noticeable for a obviously heavier pizza here. Still, great flavor, and I love all of that arugula on top. But again, where's the basil? The generous heap of other greens helped with the balance issue cited above, but still...more basil please! Spumoni Ice Cream: Pistachio, rum, strawberry and chocolate ice cream with some candied fruits. Very good! I was extremely happy with the spumoni, but I can't really say that it's any better than what you could get at the store or ice cream shops. Nutella Focaccia: THIS WAS INCREDIBLE. They use the same dough that they use for the pizza and bake it til it bubble up. They cut the bubble down the middle and slather on the Nutella goodness, and it was amazing. I loved this dessert, and the salty dough went so well with the sweet and creamy Nutella. This is genius. This is a must have. SERVICE/OVERALL: Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and stopped by frequently enough to get what we wanted, but not so much so that he was overbearing. We went later on a Sunday so there was no wait so I can't speak to how busy the restaurant is at peak times, but I think they're able to get out the pizzas and appetizers pretty quickly based on what we experienced. Overall, Spacca Napoli is a great restaurant that's worth the drive to Ravenswood!

I hold the bar pretty high for pizza because not much can top my precious Sono Wood Fired, but I gave it a shot based on a recommendation. Spacca is right off of the Montrose Brown Line so I was excited to have easy access to traveling north. I don't make it up that way often! My first impression of Spacca was one of awe. The place was super packed on a Saturday night and I was glad I had made a reservation a few days in advance. My second impression was that it's kind of more of a family place than a ""single ladies"" place. Every light seems to be on at its full wattage while groups of families crowd around pizzas and talk animatedly to one another.  My friend and I each got a glass of wine from their simple but decent wine menu and then ordered the Caprese salad and the prosciutto pizza. The salad came out at lightning speed and wasn't really a great portion for sharing. That was our mistake for not asking the server. Fortunately I had chosen a small friend to come with me, so I got plenty! The pizza came out pretty quickly too, and possibly a little too soon. I don't think it was cooked all the way and considering that it's thin crust that seems difficult to do. I wasn't a fan of the prosciutto either, which seemed pretty chewy and more ""hammy"" than it should be. The arugula wasn't very flavorful either. Despite all of this, don't think that stopped me from eating half of the pizza.

2012-02-20,4.0,"I spent some time in Croatia late last summer and one of the things I fell in love with, aside from the gorgeous scenery and amazing people, was the food.  Since Croatia is just across the Adriatic sea from Italy, that Mediterranean food is very present in the Croatian cuisine.  One of the places I especially loved was the Napoleon style, wood-grilled pizzas from Galija in downtown Split.  That really thin, kinda burnt crust topped with a light sauce, easy cheese and fresh toppings was so amazing that I went there twice on the same vacation.  By far one of my favorite meals. Needless to say I was SO happy to find the pizza at Spacca Napoli was pretty comparable to what I had in Croatia.  I wouldn't say it's the real thing, but it's a satisfying substitute.  My order was the Prosciutto e Rucola: Provola, prosciutto di parma, arugula, parmesan, and olive oil, except instead of the olive oil, I got the marinara sauce.  It's basically an arugula salad on top of a pizza and it's GREAT.  I like eating salad with my pizza; I think it cuts through the greasiness of the cheese.  The Prosciutto pizza was perfect for my tastes. The service definitely lost a star for me, though.  Our waitress was fairly absent.  It's a good thing I'm not a high maintenance diner.  Just keep my wine glass full and check in on me within the first minute or two of dropping of my dinner and I'm a pretty happy camper.  But I'm not most people and it's pretty exasperating to feel like you're waiting such a long time to get your drink orders, apps, entrees and then another long period of time for the check to be dropped off and then processed.  Dinner extended several hours.  Good if you're not in a hurry.  Bad if you need to get somewhere quickly.

The owner told us to have a nice day as we departed.  I desperately wish he asked us how our meal was so I could have personally told him my experience rather than post it publically.  I'm quite generous with my good reviews but this was definitely a sore spot in my chicago dining experience.  There are plenty of great brick oven pizzerias  around, this is not one of them.

The owner (I think) brought a lovely amuse-bouche (is it still called that if it's in an Italian restaurant?) of ricotta on a small slice of bread drizzled with olive oil. Very nice. The menu is simple and perfect...very nice antipasti selections, also red and white pizzas. We ordered the white anchovy and arugula salad, and the buffalo mozzarella w/prosciutto, along with the pizza margherita. Service was phenomenal...timing was perfect. Salads were brought out and they were gorgeous...fresh, generous portions, and delicious. I felt like I was back in Italy eating this stuff, especially the buffalo mozzarella. Oh, and the dark-eyed waiter didn't hurt {swoon}.  The pizza came next...piping hot out of the oven. I like that they give you the pizza cutter to portion however you want (while retaining the heat...I like my pizza hot hot hot). Pizza was delicious...the dough so light and thin and chewy, topped by fresh ingredients. Simple and perfect. I ran the cutter through twice and BF and I chowed down our 4 large slices. I knew their gelato was going to be good, but I had no idea how good. We split a pistachio and it was the best damn gelato I've ever had.

We started out by ordering a bottle of wine, a margaherita pizza and one of the night's specials - prosciutto and asparagus with some kind of asparagus and cheese stuffed crust. It was unbelievable how quickly the food came out - quicker than most McDonald's orders. Both pizzas were good. I was slightly disappointed with the portion of cheese and basil on the margharita, but the other one was really delicious and the crust stuffed concoction was outstanding. We decided to order a round two since we weren't exactly full. This time we got a mixed green salad and a pizza that had mushrooms, basil and italian sausage. Oddly enough, I have to say that the salad was really the thing that blew me away. Don't know why - it was simply some mescalin greens with balsamic vinegar but oh my goodness, it was scrumptious!  So for the three pizzas, bottle of wine, and yummy salad - our bill came out to about $90. Not too bad!

I ordered a grilled calamari salad as an app, it was just ok, nothing special.  I picked a red pizza, the white pizzas on the menu looked good... I just have to have red sauce on my pizzas, I always feel like something is missing on a white pizza.  I picked the sausage and mushroom (a pretty standard pizza choice for me).  It was just good.  Since it is a wood-fired style pizza it comes out of the oven charred/burnt on the bottom.  Not sure that I love this style, to me the burnt flavor overpowers the pizza, but the crust had a chewy and crunchy thing going on which I did like.  The pizza was seriously lacking in the topping department, I was there with 6 people and all of our pizzas barely had any toppings.  This was probably the most disappointing part of their pizzas.  NOW, back to the service... It continued to be terrible through the meal, we basically had to yell and wave for the waitress in order to get her over to our table.   I will not return to this place, I would rather try other pizza places in the city.  Or will go to Pizza DOC, which is a similar style pizza but is better.",0.9746,0.801,0.132,0.066,0.4576018876018875

We each ordered a pizza.  My wife the blanca and myself a pizza with sausage and fennel.  Both pizzas came out quickly.  The problem was each pizza had a pool of water (yes, I'm talking about a pocket of water about 3 inches in diameter) in the center.  Look, I've had plenty of 'za with fresh mozz like this joint and I have never, ever seen so much liquid on a pie as I saw here.  The pizzas were inedible.  You could not even pick up a piece because how wet they were.  The consistencey was akin to a wet paper towel in the center of the pizza.  The ends of the pizza were ok because, well, water does run downhill.  A real shame as the crust had some nice flavor...kind of like naan from an Indian place.   It is simply unacceptable to serve pizza this way...and before folks start piling on about this yelper being a homer who only understands the narrow confines of deep dish pizza, please understand that I spent years on the east coast and really do dig that style of thin crust...in fact, I'm not a very big fan of that lovely casserole we call deep dish Chicago pizza...",0.9534,0.842,0.112,0.046,0.5220794590025359

When going here you must realize one big thing: It's NOT Chicago pizza, silly! This is true Naples, Italy style pizza! It's made in a brick oven, so there will be some charred crust areas. Yes, it's very thin and yes the inside can get soggy. My husband and I have been to Naples and can attest that Spacca Napoli truly replicates their pizza (which, by the way, is where pizza is said to originate from). So cut up your pizza in at least 4s, fold the slice in half like you're supposed to, and ENJOY!  I highly recommend trying to catch the burrata cheese as an appetizer. It is A-MA-ZING!! Sadly they don't offer it regularly, since it is shipped in from Italy and runs out quickly when it's there! I've tried burrata at other restaurants and have never found anything that compares to Spacca Napoli's (I think it's the sea-salted crostinis that make it magical!)

2011-07-23,4.0,"...having admittedly never traveled to Naples but a seeker of great Pizzas both in Chicago and in a number of cities around the United States, many of which have been named to any number of ""Best Pizza in the America"" lists, it was with great interest that lunch would lead us to Spacca Napoli - the only Vera Pizza Napoletana certified restaurant in a city overflowing with great pizza.  Owned and operated by Pizzaiuolo Jon Goldsmith and his family and reportedly designed to not only recreate the pizza of Southern Italy, but also their traditions and hospitality Spacca had long been on my list and with mother and aunt in tow after a long afternoon in Oak Park it seemed like the perfect opportunity. Having heard from others that since the expansion Spacca Napoli was vastly more accessible than it once was but waits could still be long due to the single oven our arrival at 2:00pm proved to be quite opportune as free parking proved abundant in the Ravenswood area and lunch service was just winding down as we arrived.  With the air a bit warm and the patio umbrellas shading a few leftover patrons we made our way into the restaurant to the lovely smells of yeast and tomatoes and greeted by our hostess/server/busser Rachelle we were led to a small four-top in the middle of the surprisingly empty dining room. With menus presented and a wine list deferred Rachelle next proceeded to explain the daily specials and after a few quick questions waters were filled and we were left to our decisions eventually settling for two pizzas and two Italian sodas - one Aronciata and one Limonata, both bubbly and subtle without being overly sweet. With the oven belonging only to us it would be a mere ten minutes before our pizzas would arrive and sticking to the ""less is more"" approach both were lightly dressed and invariable delcious.  Beginning first with the ""Funghi"" featuring Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Basil, and Mushrooms the cheese was as mild as one would expect from fresh cow's milk mozzarella while the sauce was lightly sweeted with just touch of acid and spice that complimented the mushroom's earthy finish nicely.  While the toppings were good, however, where this pie really shined was in the crust - a light and supple yet slightly crisp and toasty ring of smoky flavor that remained slightly undercooked in the middle; about as authentic as it gets. Moving next to our second pizza, this one slightly more irregularly shaped with great pockets of air in the yeasty dough, the Bufalina - with Basil, Mozzarella di Bufala, and Olive Oil would prove even better than the Funghi for one simple reason - that ever so subtle funk from the intensely creamy cheese and the manner in which it so nicely blended with a thin pour of grassy olive oil.  As I noted above, I can't claim I've ever been to Italy, but if the Pizza there is better than this I need to start planning my trip. With pizzas mostly consumed and the rest packed up to go Rachelle would next appear with dessert menus and although tempting I had plans to visit Black Dog Gelato next and deferred while the ladies opted to try two selections, the first a rather flavorless but appropriately silky Panna Cotta served with a substantially more tasty pear-balsamic compote and the second a creamy block of house made spumoni complete with pistachio, rum, strawberry and chocolate ice creams plus a whipped cream and candied fruit center that although tasty in parts did not work for me in its entirety due to the subpar chocolate ice cream and overpowering notes of rum. In and out in under an hour I will note that while it may be unfair to judge our service considering the one-to-one server-to-table ratio I found Rachelle to be both friendly and knowledgeable as she manned everything but the pizza oven and although the space admittedly feels a lot more commercial/casual than New York or Philadelphia's most well regarded pizzerias the pies themselves were absolutely genuine and delicious.  As for the desserts - well - most of the ""Best Pizza in America"" locations don't even serve sweets...and besides, the folks who ordered them actually enjoyed their choices.",0.999,0.825,0.158,0.017,0.4617038323433672

It's up to the chef to bring out the sweetness, color, and texture of the dough ingredients (fine italian caputo 00 flour, water, salt, yeast, maybe a little olive oil) through the fermentation and baking process. Neapolitan pizzas are sort of the ""grandfather"" of modern pizza.

2011-06-03,3.0,"I'm having a hard time finding the perfect pizza spot that I can go to without fail. Granted, Spacca Napoli is a neapolitan pizza spot but even in this sub-genre of pizza I'd like to find a place that I can say I'd go back to time and time again. The pizza here is good but it's hard to tell if it's great. We came on a Friday night at 6:30 and were seated in 10 minutes. Not bad. Our server came over right away and said she'd be right with us. Great start. I like that a server that is clearly busy comes over and let's us know that it'll be a few minutes, rather than us wait and search out for our server. After receiving our menus we were pleased with the appetizer choices (about 10) and the 6 or so red and 6 white pizza choices. We choose an antipasi meat and cheese app that had some tasty provolone, salami, cappacola, prosciutto and sopprasetta with two kinds of delicious olives (the green one was very crisp and enjoyable).  I would have liked to see more choices for cheese that I would typically see on a menu for charcuterie, but I can also appreciate some simple but good provolone. When we ordered our app we asked for a class of wine and a beer. I was disappointed to only see four beers on the menu - I know this is a small Italian pizza joint but a bit more variety would have been appreciated.  Anyway, after we placed our drink order it took about 10 mins to see our drink even though our server was running around and should have easily noticed the drinks were ready. The server came back and we were ready to get a funghi pizza when the server explained that they had a burrata pizza. We immediately said yes as this is our favorite cheese. The handmade mozzarella is devine. SN was supposed to have an app with burrata but I didn't see it and never asked.  I'm not sure if it's ever been on the menu or you you have to ask for it special (there is a pic on Yelp of the burrata and it was in Time Out's ""100 Best Things we Ate"" issue) but have no doubt I will inquire next time. We quickly finished our drinks and clearly wanted another one after the long week. We again, didn't see our server for some time after receiving our apps and after she showed up we didn't get our drinks for another 5 minutes. Honestly, I didn't think this was a big deal but my fiancee clearly wasn't having it and wanted another drink. Our pizza did arrive pretty quickly but noticed right away that the fresh cherry tomatoes were just dumped in the middle of the pizza. We had to take the tomatoes and place them around the pizza so we could have a few on each slice.  We soon found out that burrata is not a good cheese to melt for a pizza. Not only did SN put gobs of this cheese on, but it made the pizza a bit soggy and limp.  I will not deny that the pizza had great flavor and I liked the crust. It was crips and chewy and had that great fire oven taste. My fiancee was not as impressed with the crust but we did agree that another more traditional pizza option would have been better and more enjoyable. We skipped desert as I wasn't feeling the options - they weren't bad just not in the mood for gelato, a nutella pannini or tiramisu. I do have to say that this place is noisy with families and parties so I would suggest coming on a week night if you don't want to deal with a loud room. However, I will definitely try SN again and hope to have a better experience next time.",0.9989,0.75,0.195,0.054,0.5243903841729928

2011-04-08,5.0,"I soooo heart Spacca Napoli.  I mean, I don't think I can express in words how happy I was to find this place.  I actually found it relatively immediately upon moving to Chicago but only because I was REALLY looking for it.  Having discovered during my time in NYC that real Neapolitan pizza does actually exist here in the states, I was on a mission to make sure that if it was also in Chicago, I knew about it.  And, YIPEE!  It is!  Needless to say, this was not my first dining experience at Spacca Napoli... just another wonderful one.  I can't decide if I wish it was closer to my apartment so that I could have it all the time, or if that would be a bad thing because I'd never want to eat anywhere else. So here's the scoop:  In case I haven't made it clear, the pizza is wonderful.... amazing.... delicious.... perfect.  The crust has that 1000-degree-oven char where it blisters and burns in just the right way.  Plus, it's still chewy and bouncy from the gluten development in the dough.  And it gets rolled so thin that the center is flimsy and limp (that's a good thing).  Then there's the tomato 'sauce' which is simply San Marzano puree (exactly as it's done in Italy) with no additions.  It's not cooked with garlic or onion or basil or oregano.  Simple and pure.  Just sweet enough, just acidic enough. And the mozzarella.  Imported buffalo milk mozz that's still so milky and juicy you have to slurp it up when you bite because the thin crust can't even absorb it all.  Wonderful!  They have fior di latte mozzarella too, but I just can't bring myself to break away.  Not when there's mozzarella di bufala to be had! There aren't all that many different types of pizza on the menu (only 7 red and 7 white) and most of them are super simple, but that's kinda the point.  When simple is this good, who needs complicated?   Every once in a while I do like a little something extra on a pie, however, so I was very happy when they let me add prosciutto and arugula to the Bufalina pizza. Gawd, it's good. As for the rest, there are some things that I like better than the others.  The soups are always fantastic.  The eggplant, too, is wonderful but only if you're in the mood for a gigantic mound of EVOO-soaked, tomato-braised, deliciousness.  I think it's kinda weird that it's all by itself like that but I'm not going to complain because it's an excellent addition to a pasta sauce the next day.  Mmmmm...  The only thing I wish they had on the menu is some sort of sauteed greens, like broccoli rabe or chicory or something.  I think that's be nice to be able to have along side my pizza.  There are usually a couple of specials, as well, which I occasionally indulge in.  Last night's was a meatball appetizer that was quite tasty.  All beef meatballs with pinenuts and raisins atop a WELL seasoned tomato sauce.  Both parts were nice but I wished the meatballs had been simmered in the sauce.  I think they would have helped each other out, giving the meat a juiciness and the sauce another layer of depth.  Good though.   The atmosphere, too, is an authentic representation of Italy, but with a little extra.  The tables and chairs are straight out of a restaurant there, but the wall decor and presence of music let you know that you are, in fact, still in the states.   And the service is fantastic.  Attentive, quick, unpretentious.  Ask for Angela, she's the best (and pretty funny, too)! The short version (out of 10)... Food:  9.5 Service:  9 Ambiance:  8 Overall impression:  9.8 Would I go back?   A meeeelion times, yes!  In fact, I've made the 30 minute drive on multiple occasions just to sink my teeth into that juicy, charred, heavenly pie.  I recommend you do, too.",0.9992,0.779,0.195,0.026,0.5670812983312984

2011-03-06,5.0,"Egads! Someone making thin crust pizza in the deep-dish capital of the world?? Yes folks, it's true. And this is not just any pizza place- this is Southern Italian style cooking at its best. While I'm not about to pretend to be any sort of expert, I do know what I like in an Italian restaurant, and Spacca Napoli gets an ""A"" in every one of my make-or-break categories. Pizza - Let's be serious, that's what you really want to know about, right? I had the Bufalina because I am a self-professed Buffalo mozzarella fanatic. If you've never tried it, go and get some right now. I'll wait for you to get back. You got it? Good. Now you know that it has all the creaminess of a plain fresh mozzarella, but with the addition of very slightly sweet and smoky undertones that can stand up to the herbaceousnes of the basil and the acidity of the sauce, but still be a part of the whole. My date got one of the specials of the night (which actually changed as the night went on and showed me that when the pizzolos ran out of one ingredient, they didn't shut down their creativity for the night - they improvised and featured something else instead - major kudos), and it was fantastic as well. Pizza crust - Yes, this does get its own section. It's just that important. First off, an explanation of what I look for in a pizza crust, if you don't agree, skip this section. Thin crust pizzas walk a thin line between crispiness and chewiness. Too crispy, and you've got a dry cracker with toppings on it. Too chewy, and you have foccacia. However, mostly crispy with a slight softness is also a recipe for disaster - as soon as that pizza comes out of the oven, the moisture goes to work to make the crispy-seeming crust a soggy mess. My 'Goldylock's Porridge' is 1/4"" thick chewy crust with a crispy bottom. The crispness provides the texture and bit of char flavor, the chewiness gives the pizza a slight bit of structure, more flavor, and most of all, acts as a moisture barrier between the toppings and the crisp crust. Service - My date and I went there on a busy Saturday night. The place was packed, but we didn't have to wait very long and never felt rushed by our server. I especially liked that he was on the casual side, was friendly and personable, and to me it felt like a friend was serving us. Even the busser that cleared our table was friendly and put in our order when we decided we wanted another pizza without referring our server back to us. Plus, the hostess, who had enough to do on a busy Saturday night gave everyone a free mini cannoli as they left, which was a added bonus. Everything else - The decor was nice. Sometimes I feel like Italian restaurants are trying to go with a color scheme to match their marinara, and topping it off with fake vines for basil, and fake stonework for bread. To an extent, Spacca Napoli does this as well, but only to match the idea of their food - light and simple. There are some tastefully used Italian elements, but they work to enhance the experience, not take away from it.

Don't gloss over the appetizers.  The eggplant is simple and delicious.  The mozzarella cheese - out of this world. The service never fails, either.  It's good all around, but you can tell quality service by how they handle it when shit goes south.  Our second time there, the girl clearing our pizza (half-eaten and headed for a box) got viciously stripped by some idiot inexplicably coming out of the bathroom at a full sprint.  Pizza everywhere.  We told her not to worry, she had the kitchen cook us a new pizza.  Lightnin quick too.  Our next time there, the girl knocked her wine over.  They brought her a new glass, on the house.  That's quality.

It did not stop us from eating the rest of the eggplant but the portion of bread did not match the amount of eggplant served. I've had several of the pizzas and the Prosciutto e Rucola would have to be one of my favorites.  On my last trip I had the Bianco Nero... while truffle on anything makes a dish amazing.. this was just ok.  I am not sure I would order it again.  The pizza was still good... just not fantastic.   The staff is very friendly and helpful.... hit this spot for a great pizza.",0.9841,0.78,0.197,0.023,0.5683774250440918
2011-02-14,4.0,"First impressions make all the difference. We were greeted at the door by a friendly brood, which I assumed included the owner. We were seated immediately and ordered wine shortly thereafter. Hubs is an expert at California wines but when it comes to Italian, his taste only goes so far as women (ahem, his spicy Italian wife) :). The waitress gave us a a great recommendation for vino and we were all please. We ordered the Insalata Mista which was plenty for 3 of us to share for a starter. We all ordered our own pizzes from there. I ordered the Bianca Rucola (White Pizza with Arugula), Hubs ordered Salsiccia and Funghi (Sausage and Mushroom) and my FIL ordered the Salsiccia and something else (I liked the wine that much). I'll first start by saying that I don't really like white pizza all that much. It's not that I don't really like it so much as I like the red better. I guess I thought I would try something new, but ended up regretting not getting something with their delicious red sauce. I had some of hubs pizza - The red sauce was homemade with serious love. You could just taste the fresh. The crust was delectable and chey -  I don't love crunchy crispy crusts, so this thin, puffy  style reminded me of being in Italy all over again. Something to note : The atmosphere is family friendly. It's very well lit (which I liked)  and you really get the feel that you are sitting in someone's kitchen (although not too crowded).  Be prepared for it to be loud and a bit raucous earlier in the evening.  What I am saying is, if you are kid-less like we are with a short  patience for other people chitlin's, mentally prepare yourself... :) Lastly, I do have 2 beefs with Spacca: 1. The mushrooms on hubs pizza were out of a can. What?! Freshly homeade tomato sauce and then mushrooms out of a can? It was like bad icing on a delicious cupcake... 2. I asked the waitress if they had cannolli (that's the only dessert I break the diet for) and I never heard back, so I assumed no. As we were walking out the door there was a full plate of mini canolli's at the hostess desk!!! I was so very sad... :(",0.991,0.766,0.159,0.075,0.4968614718614719

Then two of us ordered after-dinner liqueurs which were a favorite of the owner, and they were really unique. Not usually in my repertoire, but I couldn't resist one with citrus, herbs and fennel. Really a nice ending to this meal. The food here is so fresh, the atmosphere inviting, the host so gracious, its just a great spot for brick oven Neopolitan pizza. Don't think you can go wrong.

No longer will Pillsbury crescents satisfy me for croissants and no longer do I go by the ""no pizza is a bad pizza"" motto. You can definitely get more bang for your buck elsewhere, but I think it's worth it here.  We went with the Bianco Nero which has Pecorino with Black Truffle, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Porcini Mushrooms, and White Truffle Oil. It was pretty good, really earthy and mushroomy. If you're into that, you'll dig this one. I found it a little wet especially towards the middle.  For our second pizza we went with one of the specials for the night, The Bismark. As our waitress described this pizza I spaced out during the rest of her spiel imagining how good this must taste. It's a white pizza with their Fior di Latte Mozzarella, speck, with an egg cracked in the middle of it before it goes in the oven. A breakfast pizza done right. If you like eggs even a little and this is on the specials board, do yourself a favor and order it. It was awesome.  Safe to say, I enjoyed our dinner here.

Even though it's slightly out of our neighborhood it is totally worth the drive and a short hunt for parking. We first ventured there as we were trying to burn through some of our unused a la card deck coupons from 2010.  In our first trip, we immediately agreed upon the Bianco Nero (without the mushrooms). We are suckers for truffle oil in about anything. Yeah it is so cliche, I know, but really, truffle oil on pizza, how can it be bad? Obviously, it's great because we have ordered it every time since.  Our first trip there, we also shared the Tartufo for dessert, YUM! We tried to get the Tartufo again on our second trip, but they were out of it. So far, that has been our only disappointment.   Tonight, we went back again with another couple and we all shared the Bianco Nero and the Margherita. Once again, we were quite satisfied. I only wish we weren't so in love with the Bianco Nero so we could test some of the other pizzas as well. Oh well.  As we left they were handing out free cannoli. For years I thought I hated cannoli and I nearly passed up the offer.  Apparently I was wrong because hours later I still want more. (It was so delicious it even took my mind off of the Bianco Nero for a while) I really hope they add this to the menu because they were amazing.  Additionally, we have always had wonderful service there and I love the atmosphere.

Give me a Philly cheesesteak any day--you know I am a lover of all other Chicago foods.)  I am an ardent fan of the pizza at Spacca Napoli, folks, and after 1 1/2 years of living in Chicago, I can say that it has even trumped Santullo's in Wicker Park.  Santullo's has a true-NY style pizza (that's perhaps a bit runnier than what I grew up on), but it's a much pricier pizza and also the ingredients at Santullo's don't seem as fresh as Spacca Napoli's. However, and be cautioned, my East Coast buddies who have relocated:  Spacca Napoli is NOT NY-style pizza.  It's Naples-style pizza.  AND it's much preferred to any pizza I've had in Chicago.  It's so beautifully done--well-balanced, bright sauces, decadent Buffalo mozzarella, fresh herbs, and a great wood-fired crust (the secret is always in the crust, people!).  Wow.  My Chicago friends and fans of the deep-dish and thin-crust might find the crust at Spacca Napoli a bit thinner than preferred, and runnier, but I suspect those who long for NY-style in Chicagoland will eat these pizzas up in a heartbeat.  We're going again to try out other selections, but we were very impressed and immediate fans. I can't wait to bring my husband's cousin from Southern Italy here.

2010-12-05,4.0,"We went to Spacanappoli for the first time a few weeks ago, having wanted to try it out for several months. We arrived just before 7 pm on a Saturday night, but after about 10 minutes wait or so, were seated at a pleasant table by one of the windows. The place was busy, but we were able to have a conversation - likewise, the interior was bright and inviting. The chairs had the stiffest backs I have ever experience though, but after a minute or two, I stopped noticing.  So from what I have heard and read, the establishment are sort of pizza-Nazis...I mean that in a good way. The will not deliver, and they are very hesitant about allowing take away (apart from one's left overs). Ever ingredient used is imported from Italy - being in the industry myself, I find this plausible, and yet VERY difficult to believe...the pricing and logistics of such a thing would be considerable. I understand the fixtures (the wood burning pizza oven hand crafted in Italy), but the flour? Tomato? Cheese? Meat? Everything?  Their ingredient snobbery though, is the diners gain! The food is excellent. For a proper meal, I would suggest one pizza per person - it isn't pizza hut...besides, that allows one to try multiple type of pizza! I do not believe you can customize your pizza - you have to order one from the menu...I am not sure if it is verboten, but I wouldn't feel comfortable asking them to add, remove, or substitute something on my pizza...just order off the menu and don't be annoying!  The pizzas arrive at the table uncut...each comes with its own, heavy pewter and steel pizza cutter. You might think it odd, but when was the last time you had a thin crust pizza arrive at your table belching clouds of steam due to it being literally 8 seconds out of the oven? Once cut, the pizza cools quickly. There are two types of pizza here...red (using various types of tomato sauces), or white...using no sauce, or something other than tomato. We ordered a red pizza with mozzarella, prosciutto and mushroom (I think)...it was very good...  We also ordered a white pizza...upon seeing it, we were very disappointed, it looked like some had taken arugala, prosciutto and pecorino and dumped them (albeit carefully) onto a pizza crust...however, one bite and we bucked our American expectations and the white proved to be better than the red (even though that two was excellent).  As an appetizer, we ordered the ""fried special of the day"" which basically described itself as ""friend Italian street food."" Two large fritter things arrived on a bed of warm tomato chutney...was it eggplant? We couldn't tell...what we discovered was that they were thick slabs of fresh mozzarella, prosciutto and whole leaves of basil...totally amazing, but almost too much food as an appetizer for two people.   Ingredients here are top notch - no shredded Kraft mozzarella or fountain drinks...in fact, I ordered a diet coke and it came in a 6 or 8 ounce glass bottle (no free refills here)...that isn't being pretentious either - in Europe, that is how it's done and they are trying (and succeeding in my estimation) to be as authentic as possible! With such attention to detail, I'll pay the $2.50 for the little coke, no questions asked!  Pizzas are $13 to $17 bucks...but guess what? So is pappa johns and that is crap - it is the difference between a high quality dinner on par with a nice sushi or steak place...versus a huge quantity of cardboard from your local take-away pizza shop...

The waitress was knowledgeable and described each item in detail, which really helped us decide what to order.  I wish we had ordered more antipasti because the ones we had were better than one of the pizzas. I understand the whole brick oven, Neapolitan thing and have had it elsewhere but the Bufalina pizza was dry and quite burned on the bottom. I'm not a stranger to cooking on an open flame, but this was charred.  I preferred the Pizze Bianca ... I can't remember the name of the one we ordered but it was off of the specials menu - it had olives, artichoke and garlic. It was fresh, flavorful and far less burnt that the other pizza.  The vegetarian meatballs (an antipasti special) were delicious as was the Grigliata di Verdure that had lots of garlic and a real bite to it. They even brought me a piece of Tiramisu for my birthday, free of charge, which was one of the best I've had.

My husband and I ate here this past weekend after having wanted to do so for some time.  He is first generation Italian and I have lived and traveled extensively in Italy, so we're pretty tough critics when it comes to Italian food.  This pizza is very similar to what you find in Naples (THE city for pizza).  Extremely thin crust, fresh ingredients, and just the right amount of cheese. I had the margherita (red sauce, fior di latte mozzarella and basil) and added arugula because I LOVE arugula on pizza.  They charged me $1.50 for it, but I guess that's the way it goes.  My husband had the diavola (spicy salami, buffala mozzarella, red sauce and pepperoncino flakes), which was awesome.

The next cheese which blew me away was the buratta.  Served with crusty bread out of the oven and roasted sweet peppers - unreal!  Again, this was a very special cheese which was a bit heavier in style than the buffalo mozerella but every bit as special.

The sausage and mushroom pizza was really good, one of the best I ever tried and looked like everyone enjoyed it. For dessert I had a tartufo and washed it down with some grappa. Tartufo is a ball of chocolate mousse filled with zabaglione gelato and was really good. Grappa was good, but not exceptional, anyway the selection of liquors was pretty extensive so everyone can find something his/her favorite drink.

2010-11-08,3.0,"Pizza, Pizza, Pizza!  I love me some pizza & when I was deciding where to eat for my birthday (woot woot Unitypalooza!)...there was no choice other than Pizza.  Having just read in Chicago Magazine that Spacca Napoli was #15 for the top pizza places in this glorious city...it sort of sealed the deal for birthday dinner choice.  So, I got on the horn to make a reservation (7:15pm), being for Friday night I figured they might be busy.  Plus it is a total neighborhood joint bursting at the seams with Ravenswood & Lincoln Square folks.   Well my birthday evening arrived & since many were going to be running late, I changed the reservation to 7:30pm...all of which seemed perfectly fine with the person I talked to on the phone (I also called at 5pm to make the change).   Upon arrival (it was a madhouse), I was told that they would be a bit late in getting our table ready...now this was not a problem since I have no issues waiting 10-15 mins.  Their waiting area however is super narrow & quite uncomfortable.  Waiting outside was not really an option since it was raining.  Anyhow, they made us wait a full 35 mins before we were seated & that made for an unhappy start to our dinning adventure...the manager was very apologetic, but unfortunately for me that wait soured my impression.  Good thing I do not hold grudges against food.   Once we were seated our server was everything that was attentive & professional.  Our server did not hover over us, but patiently waited while we decided on which pizzas to order & was prompt in making sure we were well cared for....impression improving. Spacca Napoli is an authentic Neapolitan pizza place, wood burning oven, light crisp crust with just right amount of seared marks on it, light on the sauce, minimal toppings, and focus on herbal flavors rather a focus on heavy toppings & loaded sauce.  Since we had a group of 8...we ordered 4 pizzas & 3salads to share.  This was more than enough food for our party. We started with: Caprese con Bufala---Mozzarella di bufala, cherry tomatoes, basil.  Very solid beginning, I mean how can you go wrong with CHEESE! Insalata Mista---Mesculin greens, Castelvetrano olives, cherry tomatoes (we got 2 of these)...basic salad, but still tasty. Our pizza choices: Margherita---Mozzarella, Basil....How can you not order this?!?!?!?  Completely lived up to my expectations on the yummyiness level;  Funghi e Salsiccia---Mozzarella, Basil, Mushrooms, Italian Sausage  Diavola--Mozzarella di Bufala, Spicy Salami, Red Pepper Flakes, Basil Quattro Formaggi--Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Ementhal, Fontina...I am incredibly grateful to my friend who knows I hate gorgonzola cheese...I was about to take a huge bite out it, when she stopped me.  I am sure this pizza tasted great, but it would have been quite awful for me. Food won me over...it was a tasty evening filled with good friend, good food & great conversation.  I perhaps would not wander there on a Friday evening again, but I will be back soon .",0.9965,0.786,0.167,0.047,0.569169906057661

Upon entering we were greeted by Jonathan Goldsmith who put us at a nice table for our party of 10.  The restaurant is very roomy with lots of nice tables and lighting.  The overall landscape of the restaurant was very nice and reflected what it would be like to dine in Southern Italy with wooden tables and private dining areas.  The service was also very friendly and smart.  There was one screw up with a pizza, but the great part about this place is that the oven is so large and so HOT, that it only takes 3-5 minutes from the time you order to the time you are eating. Each pizza is big enough for only 1 person.  The size is large compared to any large pizza you would get anywhere else, but the crust is so thin that sharing would be pointless.  Also, you would not want to take out from Spacca Napoli because the pizza is only good when eaten when it comes out of the oven.  Because of the high moisture content and the fact that the pizza is ready after 5 minutes, you wouldn't want to compromise the taste. I had the Bianca con Bufala e Rucola Pizza which is Mozzarella di Bufala, Arugula, Basil.  The pizza came with a giant pile of green and the crust was very thin and light.  If you have ever had Naan (leavened, oven-baked flatbread), this crust was close to what that taste like!  So good!

Why, hello Spacca Napoli! Chicago's answer to non-Chicago-style pizza. Neapolitan pizza has a crust that I believe they call ""wet"" because it's sort of flimsy in the center. It's a light pizza (in weight, not calories), and I could probably eat a whole one here if I was really hungry. We dug in family-style here, which is definitely the way to go if you want to try multiple kinds of pizza (which I always do).  We had the Salsiccia (mozzarella, basil, ltalian sausage, red sauce), Bianco Nero (Pecorino with black truffle, fior di latte mozzarella, porcini mushrooms, white truffle oil, olive oil), Sorrentina (Pomodorini, mozzarella di bufala, basil, olive oil) and the Prosciutto e Rucola (Provola, prosciutto di parma, arugula, parmesan and olive oil). We also ordered the spinach and four cheese pizza special and the fried goat cheese appetizer... so on second thought, I do still like extra-extra cheese. I enjoyed all of them, but I think Johnny T and I may have the same taste buds, because I was also especially partial to the Prosciutto e Rucola, because I adore prosciutto on everything. They could wrap it around a chocolate chip cookie for all I care. I'd love it. The truffle pizza was a little rich for me, but I also realized recently that I don't like porcini mushrooms much, so it could have been the mushrooms that I didn't like.

I know, I know, normally the words just flow out of the keyboard faster than the water at Buckingham Fountain over here, but what I experienced at Spacca Napoli the other night is not easily translated into prose.   Yes, yes, everything from the interior to the service was top-notch, but of course what you are really there for is to eat and have fabulous food brought to your little salivating mouth.   And oh! What fabulous food it was. First off, the pizza was amazing. I ordered the Bufalina, which is your basic Margharita with buffalo mozzaralla.  However, everything about the way the flavours worked together was a masterpiece. The crust was thin, but doughy and bready, with charred areas giving another dimension of flavour. The sauce was a rich, fresh tomato, and when paired with the cheese and basil was a symphony. Easily the best Neapolitan style pizza I have ever, ever had.   But, and I didnt think this was possible, an item that eclipsed the pizza, and possibly, eclipsed anything I have ever eaten before in my ENTIRE LIFE.  This item is called Burrata.   Burrata is a gift straight from hell. It has to be, because it is SO evil, SO incredibly, horribly decadent, that I would sell my soul, commit heinous crimes, and tattoo the word on my forearm in Comic Sans font just for another taste.   It is basically a pouch. A pouch of soft, fresh (as in MADE THAT DAY fresh) mozzarella cheese. But INSIDE the pouch is more mozzarella, only it is even softer and mixed with cream (!!!). THEN the whole thing is drizzled with olive oil and a few crunchy bits of sea salt.  You put it on an olive oil brushed piece of toast - and then promptly die from sheer bliss. Seriously I think I passed out once or twice.  The only problem is that the Burrata was a special that night, so its not like I can sneak there after work and buy one to scarf down like a Burrata junkie.

Like I stated before, I really don't like Neapolitan Pizza, but this was by far the best one I ever had. The Diavola was topped with Cheese and Salami. It's not Lou Malnati's, but it was pretty damn good.   The Bottom Line on Spacca Napoli is this: If you are going to get stuck going to some Foo Foo, Girly joint, Spacca Napoli is the lesser of all the evils. The food was pretty good and the service was top notch. There were moments where I actually enjoyed myself, just don't tell my wife, she may make me go to more places like this.",0.9904,0.752,0.199,0.049,0.6517195767195766

Everything about this place is PERFECT.   - The service is outstanding (I got there before it opened today and waited on the street benches until it opened and someone came out to bring me water while I waited before the place was even open).  Then once we sat down the waitstaff couldn't have been more helpful and personable.  After finishing our meal, we were sitting and just digesting and relaxing and instead of how most restaurants want to rush you out, the owner came out with two glasses of moscato for us to enjoy while we were sitting! - The food is unbelievable (the crust is uber thin yet deliciously doughy at the same time).  In terms of what to order, the pizzas with red sauce are really good, but the ones without sauce are not to be missed.  Definitely order one with prosciutto and arugula, and the one with sausage and rabini (but we subbed arugula for the rabini) because they are both fantastic.

First off, the ingredients and toppings on all of their pizza's are SUPER fresh and tasty. The crust is crispy and very light. I suppose if you're a fan of NY style pizza, this is the closest thing in Chicago to it, (but way better in my opinion). If you're out to dinner with just one person, I would suggest trying 2 different pizzas because they aren't huge by any means. The pizza went down amazing with their Peach Iced Tea which by the way was very refreshing.  Our server was very friendly and helpful not to mention passionate about what he was explaining to us about the menu. We tried both of the appetizers they had on verbal special. The first one was kind of like mini fried sandwiches with cheese and marinara sauce (full of crunchy goodness). The next one was an arugula salad with prosciutto, the bread we were provided to put everything on was kind of dry and boring but overall very good.

2010-07-18,5.0,"Finally! After almost a year combing Chicago for a truly authentic Neapolitan pizza, I've found it. I was dubious my first time; the long trek out to Montrose, the announced wait time of thirty minutes. But the owner and head chef, Jonathan, makes those thirty minutes slip right by providing a mouth-watering slice of pizza, a nibble of parmagiano, or perhaps a glass of prosecco. Once seated, the service is always extremely friendly with wait-staff usually trained how to pronounce the various italian dishes and ingredients. (That said, I wouldn't expect much in the way of conversational Italian.) The wine is fairly priced, the pizzas a bit on the expensive side but oh so worth it. Jonathan has nailed it; the dough is exquisite--just a delicate hint of saltiness, thin and flash-baked to produce galaxies of miniature charred bubbles along the edges. Ingredients are always very fresh. I highly recommend the buffalina, with its uncanny and consistent ability to let three simple ingredients--cherry tomatoes, basil & buffalo mozzarella--shine. One bite is just the tomato, the next perhaps just a bit of the salty mozzarella with a hint of basil... The diavola is also scrumptiously spicy and particularly enjoyable on a warm summer evening spent on Spacca Napoli's patio. Spacca Napoli's desserts are fairly solid, albeit overpriced; I'll occasionally get the panna cotta drizzled in a balsalmic reduction with a few slices of balsalmic-soaked pear.

I think these two things are things I tend to overlook and take for granted when they are good, but when they are bad, omfg. They are bad.  Our server was pretty much completely disinterested in us.

We heard about the specials (after we ordered our meals) from the table next to us, who he clearly thought was more of a 'high rolling' table than we were. The service for the rest of the meal was lackluster, he checked in on us once or twice but that was it. The ambiance, oh the ambiance. Jesus Christ.

The owner himself spent a few years in Italy, and learned the business.  I just wish I did not live so far away.  Heck even the chairs reminded me of Italy.

Besides being a touch too chewy (a little crunch goes a long way), it really is about as true to the classic Italian style as you can get. The ingredients are amazing fresh and tasty. We sampled the Funghi Salsiccia - a delicious red sauce with wild mushrooms, house-made sausage and creamy mozz - and the sans-sauce Prosciutto e Rucola - a tangy pie with arugula, shaved parmesan and prosciutto. Spacca also nails the second pillar of a great pie - sauce. The red sauce is tangy, fresh and traditional. The 'bianca' pies come equipped with only olive oil and, though flavorful, can be a bit dry. The wine list is strictly Italian, but reasonably priced. The atmosphere is a where Spacca really shines. The outdoor patio along tree-lined streets of Ravenswood almost make you feel as if you were transported to a back street cafe in Napoli. Perfect spot for a hidden little gem. Inside it is clean and modern, with images of old Italia adorning the walls. Overall, great pies and a great atmosphere. A touch on the pricey side, but worth the experience.

All he eats is Pizza Hut, so I decided to give him a nice reality check on how to enjoy quality Italian cuisine in the neighborhood. I'm turning into a North Side rat and exploring every small neighborhood near my apartment. Ravenswood is a lovely, well kept secret of a neighborhood. It's located right next to old factories-turned-lofts and the Metra track. It was a little chilly last night, but Spacca's outdoor patio was too tempting to resist. On this cool Thursday night, the place was hopping. The interior was full and guests were waiting to be seated. I really liked the inside, slick, with expose brick, but I have vowed that if I can sit outside this summer, I'm going to. As I surveyed the other dishes, I realized I was going to skip on any appetizer or salad. The personal pizzas were huge. A lot of the pizzas had different meats and cheeses, two ingredients that don't always make me jump (especially the meat...), so I went with the Marinara pizza. When I ordered the waitress quickly noted ""There's no cheese on it..."" and I simply replied, ""Even better!"" I've grown accustomed to restaurants giving me the ""do you have four heads"" eye when I ask for a pizza with no cheese, so it was nice to have that actually be on the menu somewhere. Pizza was delicious! The bread especially was freshly baked. The pizza had basic, chunk marinara sauce, olive oil, and basil. Wonderful! I can't say that it was vegan, but it was probably the closest thing to it! I'm sure there was butter somewhere in the mix, but I can't confirm because I didn't ask. Whoops! I complimented the pizza with just a glass of red wine. Straight forward, helped the food go down. I would totally come by again. The atmosphere was a major selling point to me. Sitting outside on an early summer evening in the neighborhood is a major seller to this location. I think my only drawback was our waitress, who was really sweet, kinda dragged. I'm not a big fan of the whole wait for you check, drop your card, wait for the server to pick it up, and wait again for them to bring it back.

When we asked about the size we were told that they were individual serving sizes. Given that we each took home a box, it reinforces my belief that they are big enough for two. My other complaint was the price. For single servings (according to them) the price is just too much. I accept that good food generally costs more than cheap food and I am happy to pay for quality food, which this was. Yet based on that standard, I found this to still be pricey for just pizza. And I am not even mentioning how expensive the alcohol turned out to be. I do not consider myself cheap, and in fact my parents picked up the bill so my complaint has nothing to do with what came out of my pocket; but I was really unhappy about the total of our bill. My friend John S. loves this place and I want to love it too. I am sure that I will give it another chance.

2010-05-17,3.0,"I tend to like Italian style pizza over Chicago or any other American pizza and this is the real deal. Sit outside if you can because the chairs inside are the most uncomfortable things I've ever experienced anywhere. They are made of wicker or some type of wood frame and they offer no back support whatsoever and they dig into your thighs if you don't have a lot of natural padding. Also, if you are a smoker, beware! They are very serious about not smoking even outdoors, and they will make you walk down the block to smoke. Now that the negatives are out of the way, I  have mostly good things to say about the delicious fresh food. The pizza with sausage and mushrooms is to die for and the crust is so good you will want to eat every bite(if they don't burn it), Also, the fresh buffalo mozarella with tomato and basil is very good but maybe a little lite on the tomatoes. The house sparkling white wine is great on a nice sunny day or warm evening and the staff and owner are very friendly. It's nice to have a reliably good place like this within walking distance.

I think this place is best in moderation though. Helps to keep it from getting stale. A word about the pizzas: there are two groups to choose from--more traditional-style with sauce and more interesting specialty pizzas without sauce. Both times I've been here, I've gotten the saucy pizza and enjoyed them immensely. Most others that I've been here with seem to go with the specialty pizzas (they can't resist the exotic, apparently), and it is hit or miss. Some love it, some aren't so thrilled. I've found that the best way to do it is to get a traditional pizza and trade with friends for a few slices of the exotic. That way you have the delicious familiarity of great sausage or spicy salami, but also get a taste of the exotic... the best of both worlds! Oh, and finally, this place is pretty pricey. Really, its biggest fault. If you get a drink, an appetizer and a pizza, be prepared to pay up to $30. Also a great reason to come here in moderation only!",0.997,0.716,0.246,0.038,0.5662698412698413

They were doing a very brisk takeout business, so we actually ""had"" to wait about fifteen minutes for our pizzas.  Not a problem.  Later we enjoyed the tartufo dessert.

2010-04-01,1.0,"This could have easily ended up as a 4+ star review.  Unfortunately it does not. Here is why: My friend Chris recommended this establishment after my rave reviews of Nella on Clark. Having a 2nd Pizza within a week is almost too much, but if it is supposedly as good as at Nella then why not. So we went to Spacca Napoli. First impressions were very good, it looked like a proper Pizzeria, nice and airy, we were promptly seated when we arrived, greeted by the boss it looked liked- drinks came fast and orders were placed. Starters arrived, OK , the waitress (unfortunately she did not introduce herself) forgot to leave the olives off the plate as requested, but hey, not a big deal. Pizzas arrived quickly to - and unfortunately they were not as good as expected. Nice and thin (so good first impressions) but quite soggy, spongy, and not as crisp as you think a traditional Neapolitan Pizza should be. Anyway, they were OK , but nothing too special Moving on to dessert- and to really check out if they know what they are doing we ordered the Tiramisu. It arrived within 2 minutes and I asked the waitress if it was homemade as it looked quite good. ""No"" she said, ""but its really good"" - Err, Wait - what ? Not homemade ? But from a Tiramisu  Factory ? Obviously it tasted OK with artificial flavoring in it - but how can you serve a fake, machine made Tiramisu in an otherwise nice Pizzeria ?? So I told the waitress that I thought it was quite a shame that they did not have real Tiramisu but would sell fake food. She apologized, and turned up with the check when I realized she had not charged us for the Tiramisu. Obviously I was happy to pay for it even if I was shocked it was not real - but she refused. Nice gesture, but she was missing the point. Anyway, on the way out we ve had the chance to talk to the (supposedly) owner of the place, and I again commented on the fact that it was quite a shame that he did not serve real Tiramisu in an otherwise decent place.  He said that he actually did not want to sell Tiramisu (""such a cliche""), but would have to have it as his customers would demand it.  He would rather ""focus on the dough and the Pizza"" and leave desserts to others. To my remark ""Making Tiramisu is not  difficult"" he replied if I wanted I could come in and make the Tiramisu for him in the morning. Excuse me ?? First of all, the dough wasn't all that - so where is the focus ? In addition to that - how as a restaurant owner who prides himself as that  "" the food, wine and service at Spacca Napoli are all designed to reflect southern Italy's proud traditions and gracious hospitality"" (website) sell food that is factory made ??   That is just disgusting and a slap in the face of every Italian. Where is the Passion for food ?  Focus on one thing but leave the other stuff to the wholesaler ? What ???   Profit is one thing - but throw your pride for cooking down the drain for it and fill your customers with artificially flavored factory made food ? Err, no. Wrong. Fail.  Shame really.

Now for my few complaints (while carefully censoring what I say since the patron saint of pizza was looking down on me at the restaurant): Prices are a bit extreme.  $16 for a just under 12"" pizza?  Really?!  Yes, I understand that the Mozzarella di Bufala is imported directly from Naples and truffles are pricey, but the price is steep for a personal sized pizza.  We purchased three pizzas and the total was just under $50.  The worst part is that the Margherita pizza had only three leaves of basil, not to mention the cheese is was also sparse.  We fought over those few slices.  Now, whether the owner is trying to go ""green"" or not, no take-out menus is a bit bothersome.  Instead, he recommends you go to the webpage with annoying music and unfriendly mobile interface.

Many edges were naked, but I didn't mind as much because I like the doughier crust. While the toppings didn't always extend to the edges, the toppings were generous on the majority of the pizzas. At Forno, even in the center of the pizzas, the toppings were scattered sparingly. The pizzas with the buffalo mozzarella could have used a couple more minutes in the oven to melt and caramelize.

Well we go there finally last night (not V-day but we went other places that night).  My wife is getting into her hungry more so we need some apps quick.  We get the poached seafood.  It was calamari, cuttlefish, and shrimp drizzled with olive oil and lemon.  It was light and hit the spot.   But they also had something they called the daily fried item.  I don't know about you but when they say that my heart usually skips a beat.  I'm not quite sure if that is excitement or a preemptive warning from my heart of an imminent heart attack.  I'll just assume excitement.  So we order it.  That day it was deep fried sandwiches.  Yup folks it was an Italian Monte Cristo, but fancy.  The bread was a good Italian bread with buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto, and fresh basil leaves.  It was served with a nice chunky tomato sauce.  Holy Sh!t it was amazing.  If I could eat 10 of these I would. A few minutes later and its pizza time.  Here were my first impressions.  The cheese doesn't cover all the pizza and they didn't cut it for us.  Then I notice the crust has little burnt edges from the wood-fired oven.  So with the pizza cutter they provided we cut the pizza.  For being burnt on the edges it sure is soggy in the middle.  Well that aside, the flavors were amazing.  We got the Diavola, which was buffalo mozzarella with spicy salami, basil, and red pepper flakes.  The dough was chewy and delicious. After wards my wife and I treated ourselves to some after dinner liquor.  It helped digest the carb overload that we both enjoyed. The only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars was the price was more expensive than I would anticipate for a small pizza place.",0.9954,0.77,0.176,0.054,0.508015873015873

2010-02-15,5.0,"I have been to Spacca Napoli numerous times and I have enjoyed each experience to the max. There is generally a wait (this place is really popular) and the average wait is a half an hour or more depending on the day. But while waiting you are treated to complimentary Italian cheeses, crusty bread and even a glass of Prosecco. Michael, the owner, is very nice and hospitable and generally serves up these complimentary goodies with a great conversation to boot. Michael has informed me on the many aspects of his restaurant, but one thing that I found most interesting was his hearth pizza oven. He said it was shipped piece by piece from Naples, Italy to his restaurant right here in Chicago. If you see the beautiful oven you will understand the beautiful Italian craftsmanship behind it and why he chose it. Not only was the oven built quite beautifully, the oven produces a pizza that is out-of-this-world. The pizza here is Napoli-style and is nothing like our Chicago-style deep dish pizza. My favorite pizza there is the Margherita. The crust is thin, lightly charred (gives it a nice and subtle smoky taste) and chewy. Then is covered with delicious Italian chunky San Marzano tomato sauce and finally topped with slices of fresh Buffalo Ovolini mozzarella and fresh basil. It's sweet, savory, salty and just plain Delicious! Many people mention the pizza being soggy, but I can understand that the crust may get wet from the fresh mozzarella and the chunky sauce. This isn't cheap shredded dry mozzarella, the good stuff is soft and moist. And the chunky sauce may be juicy, but I just can't get enough of it. Whether not the fresh ingredients cause the crust to get wet, I know I would devour their delicious pizzas regardless.  The ambiance there is great and perfect for a date. They have a great wine selection, wonderful appetizers, the best Napoli-style pizza in Chicago and a great array of fresh desserts too. I will continue being a loyal customer to Michael and his restaurant and maybe I'll see you there next time.",0.9989,0.724,0.27,0.006,0.6147869674185462

There are no reservations, but we were served 2 hors d'ouevres during our 1/2 hour wait for a table.  An aged mozzarella, and also a little fritter with seaweed in it.  As soon as we sat down, the server brought complimentary glasses of prosecco, also much appreciated!

2010-01-24,5.0,"This review veers a little off the 'traditional' review.  Hopefully, it will give a little insight into more than just what most people see when they visit a restaurant. First of all, the cooking and presentation of food is an art form; and like all art, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  You cannot be 'everything to everyone' and it is a fools folly to try.  Just as you may be thoroughly in love with a particular movie or musician, you will find it utterly baffling that your friend can take it or leave it.  That is part of what makes any art form so fascinating - the passion it stirs within individuals.  Pizza is such an art form. In a city such as Chicago, with it's tempting variety of pizza styles, it is not difficult to engage in a heated discussion over what establishment has the 'best pizza' or 'best service' etc.  You will not find any 'perfect' restaurant (or 100% agreement of reviews) in this city.  The Italian culture cherishes art & food - from the dock worker to the fashionista, the Italian people are filled with passion.  This is the feeling of authenticity Spacca Napoli successfully recreates in its restaurant.  From the beautifully decorated mosaic imported Italian brick oven to the pureness of the Italian ingredients, to the family ambience it seeks to create. Unfortunately, some reviewers fail to appreciate the authenticiy of this experience.  Others, don't understand why a small restaurant that is immensely popular will not book a party of 9 at 7:00pm on a Saturday night.  These people have never owned a small restaurant.  It's a business - livlihoods depend on it.  Most parties of this size trickle in over the course of an hour, often not ordering until all are seated.  Often, several do not show.  A small restaurant does not have the luxury of holding tables.  Spacca Napoli is doubling in size with an addition slated to open very soon, which will allow it to book reservations for large parties, which will alleviate some reviewers issues with reservations.  However, they must understand that an owner should treat all guests equally important.   When you have patrons waiting an hour for a table and see 3 tables for a party of  9 sit open while they trickle in either late, or not at all, you alienate more customers that way.  It is the only way to treat customers equitably; unfortunately, some people can't see beyond their own world - they need to.  When the owner is personally handing out food samples and wine tastings to patiently waiting patrons, how can one possibly complain of that?  Of the thousands of restaurants in Chicago, you can't count on one hand the restaurants that treat their customers this respectfully.  (A side note:  I have seen Rick Bayless, sitting on the bench waiting patiently for a table just like everyone else). Obviously, when you have over 300+ reviews as Spacca Napoli does, and the vast majority have glowing reviews, has been recognized as one of the outstanding pizzerias in Chicago, the United States, and the world, by the Italian organizations that recognize outstanding authenticity, excellence and adherence to quality, you must be doing a LOT right. I'll let the other reviewers speak about the food, beverage and ambiance in more detail; it's not too hard to see why this place is so loved and frequented by so many regular customers.  If you haven't visited Spacca Napoli yet, you need to make a point of it.  If you love authentic dining experience, an owner passionate about people and the food he serves, then Spacca Napoli should be high on your list.",0.9983,0.797,0.171,0.032,0.5727423687423687

I remember when it opened a few years ago and everyone was complaining about the prices (as in, they were supposedly too high for the size of pizza). Well, now that the gourmet pizza trend has fully caught on, it seems that everyone else is charging about the same. Which is to say that I think it's perfectly reasonable that they charge ~$15 for a pizza big enough to be finished by one hungry person that is topped with premium ingredients.  I got the white pizza topped with arugula (my absolute favorite!!! not offered as an option in nearly enough places!) and prosciutto. I didn't love the prosciutto on the pizza, though it was good quality. But I'd definitely get the other arugula topped option they had with mushroom, I think).  The other pizza we ordered was the sausage -- far and away the winner of the evening. I love the fennel sausage with a simple tomato sauce. The pizzas are thin crust, but have a fairy sizeable chewy outer crust -- the perfect combination, in my opinion. They cook so quickly (something like 90 seconds) that once you've ordered, you have nearly instant gratification.  Also great selection of inexpensive wines by the glass. Convivial atmosphere.

We were placed next to a table in the corner with two people that were evidently ""VIPs"", and the owner came out and spent a lot of time talking to them. It seemed that the waitstaff stayed out of the way because of it, so our service was initially not very attentive. The server (who turned out to be the daughter of the owner) made up for it later. She was very friendly and helpful. Nice recovery! She made some great recommendations on wine, as well as on italian beer that I was unfamiliar with. Food was ok. I had the ""Zucchine Alla Scapece"" for an appetizer. I didn't expect it to be cold, which was a bit disappointing, but it was very tasty. The pizza was probably below average for a coal/wood fired oven pizza in the city. The toppings were fresh and excellent, but the crust had way too much chew, and there was so much char on the bottom that it was overly bitter. I never went inside, so I can't comment on the cleanliness.  Prices were high for what you get. I likely won't be returning.

I would definitely recommend the bufalina (red sauce, a lovely mozzarella, basil) or pizzas with toppings that won't weigh down the thin crust. The fewer ingredients the better. You'll be able to taste the different components of the pizza better.  I am a little obsessed with the crust on this pizza. The center part with the toppings is delightfully thin but the edges are heavenly puffed up pieces of dough with beautiful charred specks... allowing you to have the best of both worlds: thin crust middle; carbo-loading edges.  Diet Cokes come in cute little glass bottles - no free refills here. They also have some fun Italian sodas in their drink case. My only complaint is that their appetizer menu is in Italian.

There's something about thier crust that makes you coming back for more. I can def. have an entire pizza to myself, but they are good to share with an app and salad if you're both light eaters. Proscuitto and Bufalo to start is amazing, yet so simple! I love this place. By far my favorite regular quant joint in the city.

Who cares what it was, it was delicious and so light I could have eaten 17 servings.  I licked the plate.  Don't judge me.  Then they brought out the Nutella Calzone...basically they take their pizza dough, spread it with the chocolatey hazelnut goodness and fold it in half. Theoretically you could make it yourself with a Boboli pizza crust and some Nutella.  But your version would be a waste of calories so forget about it.  This thing was huge and delicious - I  had to hold myself back from swallowing it whole.  In a completely uncharacteristic show of restraint, I saved a sliver for leftovers the next day.  And I'm happy to report that it was amazing on the re-heat.  So order it even if you are already full from the incredible pizza.  You will thank me.   Did I mention that the desserts were like $5 each or something?  Deal of the century!",0.9876,0.772,0.185,0.043,0.6272727272727274

I chose the Salsiccia e Broccoletti, with Italian sausage, rapini, mozzarella, and olive oil, my date chose the Diavola (itza pepperoni!). So I chose the wrong pizza. I should have had the Diavola, which was delightfully spicy. Mine tasted like the soup I ordered--the special Carozza soup--and while that was fine, it wasn't for me. All the ingredients were delicious and fresh, yet the flavor combo just didn't hit my palate right--maybe I'm a sauce girl? The crust? A little too burnt around the edges for me.

In Spacca Napoli, we can enjoy friendly service, fancy terrace, and non-fatty, authentic pizzas. I liked Mozzerlla di Buffala especially.

As previously reviewed, you go here for traditional, authentic pizza, which is the only thing offered on the menu, besides a few appetizer options and dessert. The pizza was definitely tasty, and it was very refreshing to have this kind of unique dining option in North Chicago. We only ended up waiting about 20 minutes on a weekday night. We enjoyed the bresaola pizza special, but thought the marinated anchovy appetizer was so-so (which is actually a few pieces of anchovy on top of a green salad). However, I was disappointed with the poor, slow service. I am not sure if the place is short staffed or what, but it took a long time for the waiter to visit our table to take our initial order after being seated, a long time for the waiter to come back to take our dessert order after giving us the dessert menu, a long time for us to get the check after we requested it. Food came out very promptly after we ordered, so I don't think the kitchen was backed up, just the service. I'm all for European style, relaxed service, but this was not quite right.

The pizza is definitely the star of the show.  The crust is chewy and charred and unlike any other thin crust I've had in Chicago.  They use buffalo mozzeralla which adds a nice touch, and the tomato sauce is sweet and tangy.  We ordered the mushroom pizza and the mozzeralla with arugula.  Both pizzas were perfectly prepared.  Yes at about 15 dollars per pizza the price is steep, but you have to pay to get quality.

2009-06-01,2.0,"Spacca Napoli offers you a true Italian experience in that their menu is entirely in Italian. Other than that, it's largely an imitation and a fairly expensive one at that. First off the place was pretty crowded. We went in on a Tuesday night and did not have reservations. It was raining so the outdoor seating was not available. We didn't have to wait that long. YMMV on other nights. It sounds like this place gets crowded. Our waitress was great. She answered all our questions including deciphering the cryptic menu for us as it wasn't in English. Maybe that sounds ignorant but every table around us was asking her what was on the menu and she polity obliged us all. Which took quite a bit of time.  I genuinely felt bad for her.  Would it be that much of a conceit to have a menu in English? They use premixed flour for dough for Christ sake.  The menu consisted of appetizers, pizza, and wine. It's not huge and I'd probably avoid bringing kids here. We ordered based on what our waitress recommended after she went through EVERY item and translated it for us. It was obvious she does this for every table. We ended up getting an eggplant appetizer that was served cold and since we were expecting warm it was a pretty big let down.  They  also brought out 5 thin slices of melba round sized bread with about 2 pounds of eggplant. We were not sure just how we were supposed to use all of the eggplant with just five pieces of bread. On it's own the cold eggplant wasn't enjoyable. The bread was very good albeit in short supply. We are not drinkers so I can't tell you how their wine list was. It seemed fairly robust and served in classical Italian wine glasses.  I can tell you that if you order a coke it's $2 and they bring out an 8 ounce capped baby bottle. Drink water or splurge on wine. $2 for 8 ounces of coke is incredibly disproportionate. For the pizza you're going to want to order your own pie. We didn't know and ordered one to split which was not enough for the both of us. We got a Margarita pizza for about $10.  The ingredients where fresh but we were spread extremely thin. One small piece of Spinach on the entire thing. The water sauce ran all over the table. The Cheese was fresh and excellent. The dough seemed prefabricated and as circularly perfect as a pizza from Dominoes. It's edges were burnt as you'd expect a Napoli styled pizza to be but it wasn't that great. It was rather bland with dough that seemed to come from a can. This place is an expensive imitation and not worth the wait.",0.9811,0.867,0.094,0.039,0.5316884531590413

2009-04-21,4.0,"The pizza at Spacca Napoli is nothing short of amazing. It is soft and foldable.  The spices, cheese, and sauces are so great I ate it so fast. The pizza is a delicacy rather than a staple. Uneven dough, slightly charred, perfectly cooked with the ingredients spread artistically.  They run a tight, quick kitchen.  I also had a wonderful arugula salad to start and coffee to finish, but I still think about the pizza which was so unique, tender and beautifully good.  It is worth the wait if you have to wait.  Know that their kitchen will close earlier on weeknights. The only qualm about this place is the wait. They might treat you to a tiny slice while you wait or a little rolled treat when you sit, but it doesn't help move things along.

2009-04-20,4.0,"Very good, fairly authentic Naples-style pizza. I've been to Naples, and although this isn't as good (and really, what is), it's very good. I went on a Tuesday night at about 7, and there were plenty of tables. At about 7:30, the place was full, so make your reservations accordingly. Interior had high ceilings, large windows, brick red and yellow walls. It was definitely very nice inside. The owner came by and gave me and my date a sample of a pastry that had garlic, basil, scallions and anchovies in it. It wasn't my favorite dish (partly because I don't like anchovies), but the fact that he came by to give us a free appetizer was very nice. Don't expect typical wine here -- it's all Italian and served Naples-style (in glass cups rather than wine glasses). Don't worry, they explain each wine, the flavors in it, and in some cases, what its French counterpart would be. The pizza, as stated, was very good, but not knock-your-socks-off amazing. I've actually had better -- Sapore Di Napoli in Lakeview on Belmont had more buffalo mozzarella and a slightly more charred and crispy crust.  I'd still, however, definitely recommend this place if you're in the area!",0.983,0.803,0.164,0.033,0.5295238095238096

The restaurant itself is cozy and inviting, and sitting next to the big windows on a sunny day was great.  We would have sat outside since it was so gorgeous out, but since it's been snowing all spring, they were just getting around to setting up the outdoor seating area today.  (The planters they were planting look like they'll be really pretty when they're all done and set up.) After we ordered, I could not believe how fast the food came out.  We didn't order appetizers, but just went right for the pizza, and within maybe 5-7 minutes (?) our pizza was on the table.  The pizza is not what what I've been used to having in Chicago.  I love pizza in Chicago, and this is something very different... and I loved it.  It reminded me of pizza that I've had in Italian restaurants in Europe.  (It's a little different than pizza I've had in Italy, but similar to what I've had in Italian restaurants in Germany/France/England.)   I don't speak Italian, so I can't tell you what my pizza was called on the menu.  But it was italian sausage, mushrooms, basil, and mozzarella.  While I would like to try more things on their menu, I was really happy with my pizza and don't know if I could keep myself from getting the same thing again... though next time I may try one of their Italian beers instead of just having a Diet Coke in the cute little glass bottle. I would also like to try some of their other desserts.  I had the pistachio gelato, which I quickly scarfed down (yum).   All in all, it was a fab lunch.  The fact that the crust is very thin and the pizzas are individual sized meant that I didn't feel completely stuffed when I left there.  I usually leave pizza places feeling uncomfortably full because pizza is a weakness for me and I will eat it until there's nothing left to eat.  I was able to walk out of this restaurant with my head held high and my gut in check.",0.9964,0.816,0.163,0.021,0.4336150793650793

I thought the interior of this place was very nice and welcoming, and as we ate we watched them setting up the outdoor patio.  Can't wait until that's open! We perused the menu for a while, and since neither of us speak Italian we had some questions for our server, Kristy, on what was what.  She helped us out, gave us the specials, and we were all set. First of all, love that the sodas come in old school glass bottles.  I thought it was a nice touch. Orders placed, my friend and I took turns using the restroom (very clean - always a bonus), and before my friend got back our pizzas were done and on our table.  Hot damn, that was super fast!  Seriously, under 5 minutes. He went with something with mushrooms on it.  I have no idea - it looked good though.  I went with the Quattro Formaggi - basically a four cheese pizza with olive oil instead of red sauce.  It was good, but not the best I'd ever had.  The crust was outstanding (warm, soft, and chewy - just the way I like it), but everything else was just good. Paige W told me to make sure I tried the gelato, and it was a nice warm day, so I figured why not?  I got the chocolate, my friend the pistachio, and he inhaled his pretty quickly.  Mine was so damn delicious, but I couldn't finish it all...  I kept saying, ""no seriously, I'm done, get this away from me"" as I would grab another spoonful.  Finally I had to pour water in it so I would stop myself.  That's when you KNOW it's good, right?  Apparently our server agreed - she admitted she does the same thing, and we all had a good laugh about it. Overall, great little place.  Outstanding service, quick cooking, and good food.  Awesome.  If and when I come back I wouldn't order the same thing, but I would come back and try some other menu items.",0.9975,0.734,0.219,0.046,0.5702640103660512

Anyhow, I guess the cop looked into my car and saw two dorky grad students with seat belts un-amiss and decided we weren't really worth the effort, so we were let go to continue to dinner. The police ordeal? Took more time than dinner itself. Not a great place to have a romantic drawn out date. Much better for kid friendly dinner. The pizza was good. I've had neapolitan style pizza in the US with the VPN (vera pizza napoletana) stamp of approval. This was not the best of them (Punch in St. Paul, MN is.) The crust is perhaps too chewy -- I like mine with a touch of structure. The pizza must also be eaten quickly before the crust gets soggy. I thought the ingredient-to-crust ratio was a bit off, hence the sogginess. I took home a leftover piece and it was better reheated. (More integrity to the slightly drier crust.) A plus: owner and staff are accommodating. The three stars? Great pizza, and certainly better than anything else in Chicago, but not the heights.

2009-03-10,5.0,"Last spring my husband and I traveled to Italy. While in Naples - the birthplace of pizza - we ate at Pizzeria da Michele, one of the most famous pizza places in Naples. Ever since that trip I have been craving that unique taste. It's the combination of the San Marzano tomatoes, the mozzarella di bufala and the high heat of the oven that you can't get just anywhere. Then I read about Spacca Napoli. Two weeks ago on a Saturday night, my husband and I tried Spacca Napoli. It was crowded, though that is expected on a Saturday night. We waited 30-40 minutes for a table, but it was fun watching the open kitchen and seeing just how quickly the pizza is cooked (less than 80 seconds!). The owner was playing host and was friendly, passing out delicious apps to the people waiting. We had a chance to look over the menu while we were waiting, so when we were seated it didn't take us long to order. I only wanted the Bufalina, which is essentially the Margherita I ordered in Naples. Very simple pizza - tomato sauce, buffalo mozz and a touch of basil leaves on a deliciously thin, chewy crust. My husband ordered the Bianca con Bufala, which was essentially the same, minus the tomato sauce. (FYI, the prices, when converted to Euros, was almost exactly the same as in Naples.) Our waitress was very friendly. We ordered lemon sodas, as we had everywhere we went in Italy. Our pizzas came out fast, but not before the owner stopped by our table to offer us a piece of deliciously fried mozzarella. When the waitress set the pizza in front of me, I teared up. It smelled exactly the way the pizza in Naples did. It really took me back to our wonderful trip. More importantly, the pizza TASTED the same. Very authentic. My husband's pizza bianca was also delicious. I also loved how they served it with a knife & fork, just like in Naples. This isn't typical NY pizza. We thanked the owner as we left and told him how wonderful it was to relive a small part of our trip. He was very friendly and seemed genuinely thrilled it measured up to our expectations. He also handed us tiny canolis that were to-die-for! We'll be back when we need a taste of Italy again!",0.9973,0.831,0.163,0.005,0.5125027685492801

2009-01-03,5.0,"my fiance has been on a big pizza-making/-eating kick. and not just any pizza, the real deal, neopolitan-style pizza. he's searched high and low for san marzano tomatoes, bufalo mozzarella and various recipes to achieve his ideal pizza (to the point, that i had to take a full month-long hiatus from eating pizza because i was so sick of it). in this quest, he heard about spacca napoli and was dying to go. spacca napoli didn't disappoint. if you're looking for a neopolitan style pizza in chicago, this is your place. we ordered the bufalina, funghi and bianca con bufala pizzas. all were fantastic, but the bufalina (basically a margherita pizza) was the big winner. it's delicious. the crust was perfectly cooked in the woodfire oven and the ingredients were all very fresh. the only downsides to this place are that the atmosphere is so so and it's slightly pricey for pizza, but well worth the slight up charge for the fresh ingredients and simple, yet great taste. must try: bufalina pizza",0.9894,0.778,0.201,0.021,0.5418809523809524
2009-01-01,2.0,"I was really disappointed by Spacca Napoli.  I guess I had pretty high expectations given all the talk about this place and the supposedly very authentic Naples style pizza - and it's rarely a good thing to have high expectations going into a restaurant. Anyway, the place itself is nice and cozy and the service was great, down to the complimentary little glass of dessert wine after our meal.  However, the pizza was just way off the mark.  While it looked like it would be perfectly done, with the slightly charred crust and bubbly edges, the excitement ended with the first bite. The crust was way too soft and spongy and there was too much cheese and tomato sauce on top of it, making it even more soggy.  How they can turn out such a poor crust with that nice of a wood burning oven in their kitchen is beyond me.  Even the flavors didn't impress, which was surprising considering they used what appeared to be very fresh ingredients on the pizza.  Somehow it still turned out bland. We ordered 4 different pizzas, and all of us were equally disappointed - especially after spending $14-16 per pizza.",0.9477,0.785,0.148,0.067,0.631329365079365

Service is fine, but the owner is great- always checking to make sure everything is ok.  If you get stuck with a wait by the door, the downside is that it's a small narrow area- they could benefit from a vestibule in the winter.  The upside, though, is that the owner often gives out amazing little bites while you're waiting- I got bread with truffle oil- YUM!

2008-11-17,1.0,"This was my fourth and final visit to Spacca Napoli.  Two visits ago, I was dining with a friend at a two-top.  After our plates were cleared, Jonathan Goldsmith (the owner) came up to us and asked if we would mind moving to another table as he was trying to set up for a party of eight.  He offered us each a grappa and apologized for the inconvenience.  We obliged without question.   Last night I was dining with 3 friends at a four-top.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  After completing our meals (including dessert), our waiter offered us the check.  At that time, we had been at our table for a little over an hour.  In the middle of our conversation, Jonathan Goldsmith came to our table and asked if he could settle our bill, to which I replied, ""No, we haven't looked at it yet.""  Shortly there after, we put our credit cards in the jacket. Jonathan Goldsmith collected it and then returned it to us.  Within 2 minutes of signing our credit card receipts, he returned to our table and asked if we would mind moving to the bar (where he would offer us grappa or a drink of our choice) because there were a lot people who were waiting to be seated.  In protest, I told him that this was the second time in a month I had been asked to vacate my table at his restaurant and that I found it in poor taste to be asked to leave the dining room to make room for another party.  Taking issue with my protest, he told me that he was sorry, but that he was ""trying to be nice"" and didn't want to make his other customers wait 1.5 hours to be seated.  Frustrated, we left the restaurant. Sadly, Jonathan Goldsmith's behavior exemplifies what is experienced in American eateries across the country:  namely, it isn't about making the customer feel welcome or encouraged to digest one's meal at the table on which it was served.  It's about turning the tables and making sure that every last available dollar is taken in by the end of the night.  Fortunately, I live in a city where there are a number of fantastic pizzerias and Italian restaurants where the owners and managers encourage you to enjoy your meal (Calos and Pizza D.O.C. being 2 perfect examples) in a relaxed, unhurried setting.",0.9882,0.832,0.124,0.044,0.4838888888888889

2008-11-02,3.0,"Spacca Napoli was a huge disappointment, which is partially my fault because I'd really built it up in my head.  I live a few blocks from Spacca Napoli and I've been meaning to go there for at least a year.  Since it's nowhere near anything else, I tend to forget about it when choosing a restaurant in the neighborhood.  When we were rejected from  Mixteco on Saturday night for lack of reservations, I finally remembered SN and demanded we go there despite the fact that my date had his heart set on Mexican.  After a year of anticipation, I was primed to like this place, I wanted to LOVE this place, I wanted to erase the bitter Mixteco disappointment.  None of these things happened. We were seated almost immediately.  For a Saturday night, that's impressive, though I seem to recall it used to be difficult to get a table here.  It makes me wonder if word has started to get around that SN isn't really all that special.  Our order was taken promptly and our food arrived literally within 5 minutes of ordering.  I realize it doesn't take that long to cook a Neopolitan pizza, but I am not a fan of food coming that quickly.  It really doesn't make for a relaxing dining experience.  If I wanted food lightening fast, I'd go to a drive through.  If I'm paying a premium for sit down service, I want to linger over my dinner.  This may be the first time I ever wished a restaurant had NOT started  my order as soon as the waitress put it in.  It could not have been more than 25 minutes from the time we sat down to the time we were finished eating (and we hemmed and hawed over the menu for a few minutes before ordering). The pizza itself was fine, but unexceptional.  The more interesting options were all offered in white pizza form.  For some reason I was really craving tomatoes, and for red pizzas our options were pretty much limited to cheese, mushroom, or sausage.  I do feel the pizzas are overpriced at anywhere from $12 to $16.  I far prefer the personal sized pizzas at Apart, which are about half the price.   The dining room is very noisy and kid-friendly, but I knew that going in so it didn't bother me.  All of the staff were pleasant enough. Overall, SN isn't bad, it's just a very average restaurant at a higher than average price point.  One bright spot is that we were offered a free taste of what seemed to be a test appetizer by the very personable chef.  Even free food couldn't redeem Spacca Napoli for me, though.  After my year of waiting, I have no plans to return.",0.9719,0.834,0.101,0.065,0.4592791005291006
2008-10-31,3.0,"I am really torn about this place. On one hand- I have always adored their doughy, speckle-char-marked, some spots puffy and airy, other parts thick and chewy crust that makes it a delight in itself.   On the other hand- I have had some toppings some-what ruin the experience altogether.  Charred/Burnt porcetta (I love my pork, preferably without lipstick- you got that Gov. Palin?!?!?) that was so flawed- but could have been so good if exectued properly, overly bitter brocolini, and the aforementioned by many canned mushrooms (as I experienced very recently). The service has varied from very friendly, to a bit cold, to a somewhat-creepy dude who was giving me the eye and made me feel like I needed to hurry up, eat, and get the hell out of Dodge........... Decor- decent dining room size but it gets packed quickly- especially on a weekend evening.  They have a decent outdoor area that during the summer or on warm evenings in the Spring and Fall are coveted (only problem is the trains coming by).  Inside the only thing worth mentioning are the two portraits hanging on the wall of the west-side dining area.  It reminds me of  paintings by someone who became famous for making up paintings for the cover of romance novels. From what I can tell- aps seem like standard-fare, and wine/beer list is pretty basic as well.  I did also notice recently after going very early for dinner that the pizza was ready in an alarmingly quick period of time.  I realize the pizza oven is set at some ungodly high temperature- but 5 minutes brought to our table from the time we ordered?  Maybe it is my flawed background as an ex-pizza maker of a different style of pie. I guess another reason I am torn is because I believe with Neapolitan pizza- the more basic, the better.  There really shouldn't be more than just 2 or 3 toppings on the pizza (and Spacca Napoli follows this formula).  Neapolitan pizza should not be over-loaded with sauce, or even cheese for that matter.  The crust- if done right is what should really shine and should be the main part of the experience.  That is why every time I come here I tend to leave very happy.  Only after looking back on the pizza itself do I realize that I am ultimately just very pleased with how the crust is done.  I am torn though because is it really worth $15 for beautifully cooked dough? Is it too much to ask to have some interesting topping combinations, or at least the classics done with completely fresh and perfectly executed ingredients?  For example- Is it too much to ask to actually get fresh porcini mushrooms instead of the briny canned variety they gave me recently? Last thing to note- this place is recognized by the Associazione Verace Pizze Napoletana, which is basically an organization based out of Naples that verifies whether a particular pizza is done in the Neapolitan style.  I think they do their inspection process with some quality control, but maybe all you need is to follow a check-list of things in order to make it Neapolitan.  Not sure......... Maybe by following this process you are able to get crust that is so golden and delicious.   Maybe that should be all that I need to keep me coming back and be happy......

Spacca Napoli (+) ---------------------------- - It was quite easy to get a last minute reservation for a Thursday night on the patio - Eating al fresco on the verge of Fall among candlelight and neighborhood folk was nice  - Friendly, attentive service and my water was filled every time I took a sip. Love via tap water, nice!  - Melon and Prosciutto special appetizer; insane portion, delicious, perfect combo of sweet and salty - Insalata Mista; somewhat plain with only lettuces, olives, tomato and some balsamic, however, the freshness and simplicity was appreciated. And again with those portions, 1 salad is easily enough for 4 to share.  - Naples-style Pizza. Yum. Yum. Yum. In. My. Tum. Tum. Tum. The margherita (classically done with mozzarella, tomatoes and basil) and funghi e salsiccia (mushrooms, fennel, sausage) pizzas were outstanding!! This is what it's all about, chewy, tangy, fresh and piping hot straight from the oven. - Zabaglione dessert. Served in a juice cup (cute!) it was tasty, creamy and the perfect sweet to accompany after-dinner espresso and good conversation.   Spacca Napoli ( - ) ---------------------------- - While sitting outside is nice, being jarred by the adjacent Montrose brown line is not. I may opt for inside seating next time.  - The pizzas need to be watched extremely carefully as Napoli style pizza cooks lightening fast. Burnt edges become inedible and you're left with crust castoffs. The crust is my favorite part, a 1/4 section ruined by char on one pizza was a bit of a bummer.  - Baked ricotta dessert. Way too dry.

2008-08-20,2.0,"Let me just start by saying that this is my first Yelp Review!!  I am way excited because I always use this website and I finally decided to become a ""yelper"".   On to the review................ So I went to Spacca Napoli last night for dinner with my boyfriend.  The place was cute.  Casual inside, nice and clean, and very nice outdoor seating.  The outside was full (of course) and we opted to wait for a seat rather then eating inside.  We ended up waiting about 10-15 mins which wasn't so bad since there was 2 other groups in front of us.   After we were seated the experience went downhill............. First of all, we sat there for a good 10 minutes before we were even approached by a server.  When she finally came over she was very friendly, and she took our drink order.  We also put in an appetizer order before she left because there was a good chance she would be gone for a while.  We ordered the Caprese con Bufala which consisted of 4 (small) pieces of  fresh mozzarella with 4 cherry tomatoes on top (1 on each piece) and a few basil leaves for the price of $10.00!  Are you serious?  They cannot even give you a full slice of tomato.....so I hope you like cheese if you order this.  I felt like this was definitely not worth $10.00 even though the cheese was good, it was way to small. For the main course, I ordered the Margherita and My boyfriend ordered the Salsiccia.  Essentially this was the exact same pizza except one had Italian Sausage on it.  I should have went with the special which sounded much better......my mistake!  Surprisingly, the pizza came out pretty quickly (by the bus boy of course and not our SLOW waitress).  When the pizza got there it looked good but the taste was a different story.  I would not say it was terrible, I could eat it, put it kind of tasted burnt, like there was charcoal on the crust.  It was not burnt like hard and crispy it was burnt like you could wipe ash off of it.  The pizza was also very soggy.... how can a pizza be burnt and soggy?  I'm so confused!!  To say the least, I did not enjoy it.   After dinner we waited for the waitress to come back with our check.  When she finally decided to come over she asked if we wanted desert and we said no....just the check.  It took her about another 10 mins to bring the check and I was very annoyed.  When she finally took the credit card and walked away from our table her friend was walking up the street.  So instead of going in to take our payment she starts to walk down the street to give her friend a hug.  then she continues to talk to him, taking him over to another table (where another one of her friend's was sitting) and stands there for about 10 mins talking.  As I looked around outside there was a number of people looking over at her with their bills in hand trying to make eye contact with her, but she kept on talking.  Are you serious??  this was soooooo annoying.  Not to mention that she was the only waitress outside with about 10 tables and the inside was cleared out by this time.  there were about 5 or 6 other waiters/waitresses just standing inside doing nothing!! All in all, I would say our experience was definitely not a good one and I do not think I will over go back to Spacca Napoli!  If you are looking for Charcoaley, soggy pizza with really bad service this is your place :)",0.9955,0.822,0.141,0.037,0.5345553036029226

I can't really figure out why... the quality of the tomatoes is excellent, the mozzarella is very good considering it's imported, and they have a 60 second bake. I'm suspicious that they do not use wild, sourdough cultures in their dough. Anybody in Naples will tell you that wild yeast is one of the most important parts of a delicious pizza, and though I don't know for sure, I feel as though they omit that here in favor of the typical cake brewer's yeast. Making a truly authentic pizza is an unbelievably difficult task, so considering how close they come they definitely deserve a lot of credit.

2008-05-27,5.0,"I loved this place.   First, easy parking on a charming little side street.   Second fabulous food in a comfortable, cozy restaurant.  I understand it can be really loud, but it wasn't that crowded when we were there so I didn't experience that.  Here's what we had (there were five of us): Antipasti:  1) Zucchini antipasto.  This is perhaps the best zucchini I've ever had.  According the waiter, they sautee it then marinade in lemon juice overnight.   Then they add the mint.  I think I might search the web for a similar recipe. 2) Caprese salad.  Very nice.  I like that they used small, flavorful tomatoes rather than large ones and the buffalo mozz was nicely tangy. 3) Arugula & prosciutto salad.  Yum. Pizza: 1) I had the artichoke & porcini special pizza.  It was lovely and very earthy. 2) My husband had the sausage & rapini.  That spicy / rich / bitter combination is fabulous.  It reminded me of my favorite pasta at Anteprima. 3) My daughter had the sausage pizza.  Good sausage with lots of fennel seeds. 4) & 5) Our dining partners had the four cheese and the plain tomato sauce one... didn't try them myself, but they seemed pretty happy. Dessert: 1) I had the zabaglione... it was fabulous and we were all fighting over it. 2) My husband had the risotto gelato... it was very interesting and good. 3) The Tuscan Chocolate gelato was good... we liked the hint of spicy and the chocolate pieces, but were less excited about the raspberries as they made it a bit too sweet. 4) The ricotta cake was the least favorite... it was light, but a bit bland and dry.  We did like the raspberries with balsamic sauce that came with. So all in all an absolutely terrific place and I can't wait to go back.",0.9983,0.717,0.264,0.019,0.6624716553287981
2008-05-26,5.0,"I really wish this place weren't so far from where I live.  I could eat here every day!  Last night was only my second time there because of the distance, and now because of $4.39/gallon gas, I probably won't be driving up there just for dinner despite the deliciousness. The pizzas are fantastic.  I love the crispy, chewy, lightly charred, and slightly salty taste and texture of their crust.  They've got wood-fired oven, Neopolitan-style pizza down to perfection.  We had two pizzas: the Marguerita, which is simplicity itself with good quality Italian tomatoes, buffalo mozzerella, and a sprinkling of basil.  Then we had a white pie with arugula.  Also delicious.  The arugula was lightly dressed and sitting of top of the pizza like a little salad.  It did not have the piquancy of the dressed arugula that came with our pizza at Francesca's but that's just fine because the arugula was very fresh and flavorful. Speaking of fresh, the salads are wonderful here.  The insalada mista is a large plate of springy mixed greens, tossed just right with a balsamic based dressing.  The anchovy appetizer was to die for.  Beautiful little white anchovy fillets sitting on a bed of arugula salad.  these are not the super-salty canned or bottle anchovies that you get in the store--absolutely not!  These anchovies are a revelation.  they taste like the sea and the texture is soft and tender, like a piece of sushi.  If you've never had this appetizer before, you're missing out. Anyway, five stars.  The only thing that marred our experience and was not at all the fault of the restaurant was that a car alarm went of across the street while we were dining outside; then a souped up pickup peeled off down the street.  There was also some event nearby that brought a herd of overdressed teens in our direction.  They proceeded to get into their cars and peel off one after another, to our utter irritation.  If we had known about these potential disturbances, we probably would have opted to sit inside...",0.9446,0.82,0.116,0.065,0.5092970521541952
2008-05-25,4.0,"I was really tempted to return to Spacca Napoli tonight, even though I just ate dinner their last night; it's that good. But let's get the ""why this isn't a five-star review"" tidbits out of the way first, though, shall we? It's always much better to end with a bang. First of all, climate control, or lack there of. I know that it was really friggin' cold last night, especially for the end of May, but the restaurant had this arctic draft blowing across it, except for two brief moments when the brick oven's 900 degree heat wave became way too apparent, and the air smelled burnt. Hours later, when I was still relishing the prosciutto, the tiramisu, the crust, my core body temperature was still below normal. Secondly, the waitstaff was brusque; our server did not smile once. I guess I expect at least a little warmth from Italian restaurants.  But, ah, there is so much to love about this place, even if my druthers require a sweater and a smile! Walking into the space is like walking into Naples. I have never even been to Italy, much less Naples, but Spacca Napoli has a downright foreign feeling to it. I have never gotten the ""we're not in the U.S. anymore"" vibe from non-Devon Avenue restaurant before. With a great deal of the menu in Italian , red wine served in juice-like glasses, and four Italian bieres and espresso only, this place smacks of Euro-authenticity. The ""Vero Pizza"" banner  sealed the deal. Apparently, this is the only restaurant in the United States to belong to this exclusive Italian restaurant association, in addition to winning the ""True Pizza"" award at a competition which is held each year in May. And perhaps our server's cool attitude was really one of genuine jejune. After all, who among us has had an enthusiastic server over on the Continent? Pas moi! The service was precise and punctual, which is what really matters anyway.  We began our meal with the buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto platter. When the astronomer Galileo sent his daughter, who was living in a convent, mozzarella cheese, he called it a ""buffalo's egg."" The mozzarella that arrived on our platter was accurately the size of an egg, if buffaloes actually laid them! It was artfully cut into so that a slice of prosciutto bloomed from its center. Two large slices of prosciutto framed the ball of mozzarella, and the whole arrangement was drizzled with olive oil and garnished with pungent basil leaves. It was accompanied by five thin slices of baguette, also drizzled with olive oil. The cheese was so creamy and fresh,  the prosciutto was perfectly salty and smoky...it was heavenly.  Next came our pizza. Spacca Napoli offers about 12 pizzas and 3 special pizzas, all with simple, variation on a theme-type toppings. For the neophytes: 'bianca' pizza does not have any tomatoes. The pizzas that include tomatoes still do not have a true sauce, more like juicy pockets of tomato goodness. My boyfriend and I decided upon the Funghi e Salsicca, mushroom and sausage. I'm guessing that 'fior di latte mozzarella is not made from water buffalo milk, but it was still delicious.  While the toppings were fresh and flavorful, the crust was the real showstopper. ""The charred bits taste like those I would expect from a steak,"" my boyfriend declared.  Next came our dessert, a creamy, appropriately rich, marsala-wined moistened but not too sweet tiramisu. Mmm! Washed down with thimbles full of sharp espresso, and the evening was a success. A bitterly cold one, but still a success. I mean, where in this city can two enjoy wine, antipasti, pizza, dessert, and espresso for $50? As the Carter Family sang, ""Keep on the Sunny Side, always on the Sunny Side.""  When I can enjoy my meal in the warmth of the summer night in their outdoor seating, I will certainly return.",0.999,0.792,0.181,0.027,0.42627961812744425
2008-05-20,4.0,"Spacca Napoli offers a swell interpretation of ""pizza alla napoletana"" (or Napoletan' style-pizza), and might offer one of the best pizzas in Chicago.  What is the real-world significance of the distinction I made about this pizza as an ""interpretation""?  I would say that it simply not the same quality of pizza as in Naples, (or even in New York and the real Italian-American pizza, derivative of Naples).  Spacca Napoli has the concept of Napoletan' pizza down great, but they could not quite execute a terrific napoletan' pizza. I know I know... Damn: I'm a major pizza snob.  Growing up in NJ, with pizzerias on every other corner, with grumpy siciliani and napoletani with gold chains, speaking dialect, flipping pizzas around... this is real Italian-American pizza.  Both types of Chicago ""pizza"" are really pretty lousy - made to appeal to Chicagoans, a necessary business decision because of the relatively low number of Italians in Chicago.  Chicago pizzaiolos found a way to adapt pizza to a more watered-down clientele by greasing it up, adding more cheese, more meat, and buttered crust (yuck!)!  - As American as apple pie perhaps? At the same time, Italian pizza is also very distinct from real Italian-American pizza.  In each city/region in Italy, they make pizza differently.   The genealogy of New York pizza and many New York immigrants (such as my dad's side) brings us back to Napoli where pizza was invented!  I've spent a lot of time in Italy, 6 months or so, and have stayed in Napoli for some of that time where I went on various pizza binges, including one great pizzeria on the actual Spaccanapoli. I would say that Spacca Napoli (Chicago) has the concept down.  Yes, it is Napoli-style pizza.  Yet, the texture of the crust was maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10.  The chewiness wasn't quite as chewy.  The sauce wasn't exactly nailed down.     It was also pretty expensive and way too crowded.  I actually haven't been back there but once.  I was a little disappointed by it in all honesty.  I was inclined to give it 3, but I gave it an extra star for merely existing.   I'm getting kind of hungry... maybe I'll give it another try.",0.8933,0.852,0.089,0.059,0.4174444758140411

2008-04-29,5.0,"Authenticity, extraordinary quality, enthusiasm and sincere appreciation of your patronage--the reasons why Spacca Napoli is among my favorite restaurants in the City of Chicago.  And...a damn fine pizza pie, the likes of which I have experienced only in the shadows of Rome's pantheon. For an authentic taste of true Neapolitan-style pizza and to experience a true original in the city of Chicago -- Spacca came early in the wave of these woodfire pizza joints -- I skip the scores of impostors and take friends to Jonathon Goldsmith's masterpiece of pizzerias. Goldsmith has perfected the art. Crusts are thin, tasty and rich with perfectly semi-charred heals. Ingredients are fresh, the bufala mozzarella so creamy and juicy, the sauces phenomenal and the choice exceptional.  I always recommend going with friends and preparing yourself to share. Order a white pizza, order a red pizza, make sure you get something with the bufala and get a chance to experience their lovely prosciutto di parma.  Appetizers also consistently blow my mind. Something as simple as a grilled marinated vegetable plate comes so full flavor and perfect when set atop their crusty bread and tasty olive oil. I'm losing my mind. After another great experience this last weekend, I know now not to go elsewhere for dessert. I'm a Scooters guy, but the gelati at Spacca is downright evil. Hazelnut is creamy, soft and addicting. They had a chocolate gelato this weekend that had flecks of spicy peppers in it! Unreal, spicy like a chocolate gingersnap, and delicious! Finally, the zabaglioni was truly indulgent, smooth and heavenly.  Beyond it all is a sense that this place prides itself of tradition, excellence and faithfulness to customers and to the art of Neapolitan style pizza. Jonathon wanders the floor, checks in on customers and is always excited to share his insights and learnings. This weekend, while we waited outside for walk-in seating, he stepped outside and greeted guests with samples of a new smoked cheese and friendly conversation. Midway through dinner, he served complimentary bowls of pasta to tables--just to try something new! He seems to do something special like this each time I stop in. His staff share the same friendly demeanor. Peak into the open kitchen and his people welcome you in to view their beautiful imported wood-fire oven (pretty cool!). This kind of business wins customers for life. I would honestly wait an hour and a half to be seated for, what I think, is the best thin pizza I've ever had.

Language barrier, perhaps?  I then asked in Italian, and again, just a little scowl of misery.  We even gave espanol a whirl, still, no answer.  Busy, again, only people in t he place, so nope, not possible.  Wow.  Why have an open kitchen then.  Some sights are better left unseen.

Upon arriving at just past seven, the place was indeed packed and we were told the wait could be up to an hour and fifteen minutes.  We decided to wait it out (turned out to be a little under an hour), and it was decidedly worth it.  The owner came over twice while we stood in line serving appetizers of flat breads and cheeses to the patiently waiting (and hungry) crowd.  And even though they didn't have a sit-down bar, the hostess was more than happy to take all of our drink orders while we waited, uncorking the bottle of Italian wine we purchased right there on the spot... The hostess (who I'm assuming was also the proprietor's wife) told us that while a few other places in the city tried to prepare and cook pizza in the Neapolitan tradition like they did, they just didn't compare.  When asked why, she informed us that not only did Jonathan become accredited by attending school in Naples for three years, but that their oven was imported from Naples as well (and what a beautiful oven it was--completely tiled in mosaics)... We started out with two appetizers made with water buffalo mozzarella, and let me tell you that was some of the best mozarella I've ever tasted!  We followed that up with a couple of delicious pizzas (no leftovers to be found here), and concluded with several of their decadent desserts (I wish I could tell you the names, but I was fairly drunk by this point).  The waitstaff even brought us a round of complimentary dessert wine after dinner, which I thought was a really nice touch... In short, we were impressed by everything about this place, from the decor to the service to the food.  If you don't mind the longer wait on a weekend night (which can be half the fun if you're with the right people and drinking), I think you'll find this place is well worth it.  We'll definitely be going back soon...",0.9951,0.838,0.149,0.013,0.47489177489177486

I went back for another of the same, but also needed a meat pizza for my husband, and the greeter recommended the Prosciutto e Rucola. He absolutely loved it!

The owners were planning to close up shop about an hour after we left; they chatted with numerous repeat customers about their plans to visit Florida for a week or so. We ordered the Funghi e Salsiccia and, after seeing the size of the boxes coming out, decided on a second, the Prosciutto e Rucola. Well, we demolished those. DESTROYED them. The crust on both was lovely -- chewy, subtly flavored so it wouldn't overpower the toppings -- though the middle of the FeS was soggy and overly floppy because of the sauce, cheese and toppings weighing it down. That said, the PeR was a heavenly visit from a round, doughy angel. It was so simple but absolutely perfect.

Still, I was pumped to try Spacca Napoli and to formulate my own opinion.  When we arrived here Wednesday night around 6:30PM, the place was just heating up.  We opted to sit outside on the sidewalk patio.  The hostess was super friendly and totally picked up on the ""don't you dare sit me near those bratty kids"" vibe I was throwing down.  Our waitress was flawless - she knew the menu inside and out (she even had the Italian accent down.  Impressive).  I saw the owner scooting around with free slices and Prosecco samples.  All in all, service was 5 star. As for the food. . . .not as exciting.  The salads we ordered to start were tasty - excellent balsamic dressing!  Loved the bread drizzled in olive oil.  Also loved my $5 glass of Shiraz-ish wine.  However, when it came to the main event, my buzz fizzled.  We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pie and another ""special"" pizza with mozzarella, olives, salami, and red sauce.   Did I love them?  No.  I actually walked away from the meal somewhat unsatisfied.  The ingredients were fresh but the pizza was really chewy and dry.  The arugula pizza had a great flavor combination but the consistency (aka leaves on dry, chewy bread) didn't do it for me.   I guess I am more of a floppy NY Slice girl - red sauce and greasy roni will steal my heart any day of the week.  Spacca Napoli left me a little empty inside.  It's kind of like Medieval Times - definitely a place to try once, but I will not regularly incorporate baby dragon into my diet.",0.9725,0.863,0.105,0.032,0.49752077191101585

I had the Quattro Formaggi, friend had the Salsiccia, I think. After trading bites, we decided I won at pizza. The sausage was good, but the four cheese was OUTSTANDING. There is no fight Gorgonzola can't win.  Add Ementhal and Fontina? Pffffft. No contest.  We also had the insalata mista, tiramisu, and gelati. All very, very good. I wholeheartedly recommend you go, for the Quattro Formaggi alone. Miscellaneous notes:  Friday night wait: an hour plus. It would have been longer, too, since a member of my party was delayed (her nana needed summat) and turned up five minutes after we were called, which earned us stink eye from the hostess and an immediate bumping back to the bottom of the list. I can understand being pushed down, but to the bottom? And the attitude? Yeesh. Lucky for us the owner took pity and demanded we get the next available table, anyway. Being in the owner's good favor is generally a boon in restaurant land, but here it seems to really make a difference. If not for his insistence, I would likely have been made to wait for my table an extra hour out of spite. As others have mentioned, when the place is packed and people are waiting, he's circulating, passing out samples of pizza (black truffle on our visit--incredibly good) and glasses of Prosecco. That sort of attention to customer comfort alone would have earned this place points with me, food quality be damned.

2007-05-08,5.0,"Oh my god! I love this pizza.  I had driven by Spacca Napoli 6 days a week for 8 months before finally trying it.  I have young kids and my husband makes really yummy homemade pizza.  We never go out for pizza. We finally made it when we needed an early Saturday lunch in Ravenswood with 4 adults and 2 kids.  We got there as it opened.  No waiting, and I think that is the secret.  If you can ever make it for lunch..... I have been on weekday and weekend for lunches and found few other people in the place.  I am awed by hot quickly the pizzas are made and cooked.  *Fast is good for a 2 year old and a 4 year old* The staff and restaurant set up are very friendly to kids.  They can watch the pizza in all stages of the making, and at least during the lunch hour it was easy to do.  The crust is a light, thin crust, followed by a whole range of very fresh toppings.  My favorite: a white pizza with buffalo mozzarella; arugula, salt and olive oil are added once it is done.   One warning for those who don't love fresh mozzarella; we ordered a bunch of different pizzas and all had some version of fresh mozz.  Great for me, but not everyone likes its texture or the way it melts.",0.9346,0.862,0.11,0.027,0.5537356321839081

When we were finally seated and ordered the margherita and special pizza.  When the pizzas arrived I found them overly greasy and barely edible...what a disappointment!!!  I don't know if someone new was on the oven or if it was just the pancetta topping on my pizza but the crust turned into the consistency of a soaked paper towel. Nevertheless, this might have just been an off night, so I am going to give them one more shot at some point in the future.  It's hard to do though when I could go to Frasca or Pizza D.O.C and get great wood-fired pizza with a shorter wait and for less money.",0.8539,0.896,0.075,0.029,0.42496151996151993

Each time I brought different friends for some real-life Yelping it forward. Because I love to chew, the Napolitan dough fit my masticulative habits perfectly. Thin yet with enough substance for slow oral savouring, the topping of fresh ingredients was a complement to the crust, rather than an American-style barrage of slathered meats and sloppy cheese. Any of the appetisers is a great way to start the meal and go ahead, get a pizza per person. It's completely possible to polish it off on your own, and if the Italians stay skinny doing just this, so will you. The tiramisu and tartufo are the two desserts we always get, as well as the Moretti La Rossa bierra. Because the pizzas take just 90 seconds to be baked in the oven shipped in from the shores of Naples, carryout is an extremely speedy process (just make sure you're steady enough to clear a glass of prosecco that proprietor Jonathan Goldsmith serves while you wait).

We ordered drinks while we were waiting and never got them and every time we asked, we got ignored.  Finally, we got our crappy table and it took another half hour for anyone to come over to even ask us if we wanted anything to drink (which we still hadn't received)! Suffice it to say, we were already irritated so when our server came over and treated us like we were interrupting something important that he had been doing,,,,,,it was at that moment that we decided to never go back.

I say yes, could you please slice these up for us?  He looked at me like i had just cock punched him and walked away.   Soon our server came back by and ask if we needed anything and was everything okay?  I asked, could we please get our pizzas sliced we have no room on this wobbly table and it's just going to be a mess, could you please have the pizzas sliced for us.  She went into a ER like state looking for O negative but instead of O negative she was frantic for a slicer. within a minute or two arrived at our now fully stocked wobbly table. Here, she said you can use these and slice them.  By this time my Extra special Lady friend and our 2 friend were trying their best to manage the montage of dishes in a mass organizational effort to  slice a pizza.  I on the other hand was just too pissed off at the utter bullshit i was sitting in front of to eat.  WTF.   So, now the owner comes by all sweaty and hairy in his dough and flour stained shirt that he's probably been wearing for days by the looks of it. With his hands clasped together in the prayer gesture of please forgive us he began spouting off bullshit about how they don't cut their pizzas when they come out of the over cause it would take up too much time and lower the quality.  I sat an listened as he went on calmly waiting for my polite moment to air my grievance.  When that time came some 2 minutes later he interrupted me  refusing to let me speak to the point of raising his voice saying sorry we don't slice the pizzas and just walked off.  What a harry fat asshole. So, if you like so so pizza that you must cut yourself while managing table space, and eating while frustrated-- this is the place for you.",-0.9112,0.736,0.136,0.129,0.523981123981124
2006-05-26,4.0,"Spacca Napoli serves delicate thin-crust pizzas that are apparently prepared in a very authentic Neopolitan Style - never having been to Naples or Italy, I can't vouch for the authenticity, but the pizzas I have tried have all been delicious.  The also serve a few simple Italian appetizers and desserts.  If you plan to visit for dinner, make reservations if you can, I've been lucky to getting seated right when they open for dinner at 5:00, but by 6:00 their dining room was already full & there was a line out the door of folks waiting to get seated.",0.8834,0.886,0.114,0.0,0.5546536796536796

2006-03-18,3.0,"This place was packed when I went, but they served free champagne while we were waiting.  The pizza was great -- it's a light thin-crust with delicate cheese, and not too oily.  Service was good, but the night was spoiled at the end when the owner asked if he could ""boot"" us for another table while we were finishing up our coffee after dinner.  We had barely been there an hour and were in and out before any other table that got there at the same time.  UPDATE: The owner happened to read this review and sent a message to apologize -- hopefully nobody else will be rushed like that now.  Also, FYI, this place is close to the Montrose Brown Line stop.",0.9797,0.772,0.209,0.02,0.54375
