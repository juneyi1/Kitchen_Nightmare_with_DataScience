2017-08-30,5.0,"Volo is a hidden treasure in Roscoe Village, and a solid contender for best wine bar in the city. The wines are heavily tilted toward small Old World producers, resulting in rich, earthy wines made to be paired with food.  We had half carafes of Quinta Casal Branco from Portugal, Chateau La Lieue from Provence, a Rioja, and a Zinfandel, and they were all earthy, chewy, and delicious. For food, we started with a cheese plate and charcuterie plate (adding honey and fig jam),  split the beef tenderloin entrée, (two 4 oz medallions with whipped potatoes and haricot vert), and finished with the salted chocolate caramel mousse.  It was all delectable.  The charcuterie plate is loaded with extras - pickled vegetables, Dijon mustard, cornichons and the like - the cheese offerings were good sized and delicious, the tenderloin was seared a perfect rare to order, and the mousse was creamy and eye-rollingly good. To round out the experience, Volo has a gorgeous patio in back which oozes Old World romanticism and rusticity.  On the Tuesday night we visited it was sparsely populated, and by the end of the evening had the entire back patio to ourselves.  It made for a lovely romantic evening but they can't stay open with that level of attendance (or lack thereof).  So come on out to Roscoe Village and enjoy some superb food and wine!",0.9863,0.803,0.176,0.021,0.5163461538461538

2017-08-20,5.0,"This place is known in the Chicago area for its ""hidden patio"" in the back and I have to say it was absolutely breath taking! They have such beautiful lighting back there and cabana seating as well for a romantic and intimate night out. It also has regular table seating for a night out with friends and celebrations and inside seating too along with an inside bar. I definitely recommend trying their different rosés and the duck confit was pretty good as well. The service was great, the waitresses were so friendly and courteous for anything we needed. There are plenty of rooftop bars in Chicago but this patio definitely falls high on the list of places to try!

The waitress didn't appreciate me asking about certain drinks & very rudely said, ""We ARE a wine bar!"" Well, you also have vodka, whiskey, craft beer, flatbread, fried chicken, pork belly, oysters, etc,  so why is it so hard to understand me asking whether or not you serve mojitos? I didn't ask for another thing after that. We also ordered the smashed peas & basil flatbread, which looks absolutely disgusting! It was very tasty after we removed the green gunk off & left the cheese.

We reserved the coach house and even though we booked it a year in advance there was very little planning on our part. They were very accommodating in helping me choose a menu that would please everyone in the party. What I liked most about having it in the coach house was it was an elegant setting, but also casual. The dinner was buffet style and we had a private bartender. It made it very easy for everyone to mingle if they wanted to, let the little kids walk around, and at the same time we had a table big enough that we could all sit to eat at the same time.",0.9362,0.861,0.139,0.0,0.5601190476190476

We each selected a wine flight (rose/pinot noir) and were very happy with the selections.  For dinner we split four different items which really allowed us to sample a lot of the menu. The steak tartare was fantastic and I loved that the crackers served alongside were automatically gluten free. The mussels were also fantastic. We enjoyed the prosciutto and rocket salad but I thought the presentation made it slightly hard to eat as the items are rolled around the asparagus. We also really liked the duck confit but I think the beans were slightly under cooked. The highlight of our meal was definitely the salted caramel mousse which was amazing!

2017-06-17,5.0,"Wow! I sadly hadn't eat at Volo in several (9 or 10??) years and I'm sad I had not returned soon. Next time around I will be sure I return in a more timely fashion! My husband and I sat in a cabana on a hot, summer night and enjoyed the scenery. The back patio is beautiful and there are also several outdoor seats up front. I really appreciated that we were not rushed in eating/drinking when we were sitting outside. Oftentimes, on warm summer nights in the city, I feel like restaurants are trying to turn over tables quickly (I get it, that's how they make the most money) and I don't always get to enjoy the whole experience atmosphere.  The food is great! My favorite dish of the night was the heirloom tomato salad; I'm not sure what all was in the dressing, but it was AMAZING. The tuna nicose salad was also very good and the tuna was seared perfectly. (Hate when restaurants overcook the seared tuna) The flatbread B.M.G was fantastic and the flatbread had a nice crispiness to it. My least favorite dish was the cheeseplate...it was good (because unless a restaurant is serving moldy cheese, how can you go wrong with a cheese plate?), but it didn't have a ""wow"" factor. The wine list is one of the best ""by the glasses"" list in the city; there is a great selection that is well-priced.

2017-03-25,3.0,"More like 2.5 stars but I'll round up. My fiancee and I dined at Volo for the fist time last night. In short, the food and wine were both good, but the service and restaurant itself made it clear why previous reviews have been so mediocre. Some things that stuck out that could easily be fixed: -After we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for our server to arrive. The host did come over and apologize, and explained she had accidentally triple sat our server.  -We put in our wine and food order at the same time, but then our server brought out our first two dishes before we had even received our wine. We waited until our wine arrived before digging in, as pairing the food with water wasn't exactly what we had in mind. -The beet salad is advertised as having feta in it, ours was served with feta and goat cheese, which was not a welcome surprise. -I ordered the Pinot Noir flight, which was good. However it was advertised as $16 on the menu, and was rung up at $18 on our bill. -The flusher on the toilet in their only public bathroom was broken. Again, all of these problems could be easily remedied. Here's hoping Volo gets its act together.",0.6961,0.822,0.101,0.077,0.42763157894736853

Poor service all the way around except when it was check time. We started piling up our empty plates wondering when someone would take them since our server wasn't doing it even when she came to our table.

Overall a great experience and very affordable for a slightly more upscale dinner.  Even if you aren't into the menu, the back patio is perfect for summer drinks.",0.9973,0.754,0.219,0.028,0.5035999999999999

Did not add to the evening  that once we are ""allowed "" to order and pay for food , sitting in the  restaurant , that  we had to listen to the staff complain about customers on the floor  .  Perhaps inappropriate conversations to be held on the restaurant floor , manager ""on  duty"" , Kathleen was no where to be found. She should probably  monitor her floor and staff better.  Also the man during the wine  event was somewhat pompous and really didn't know anything above elementary level knowledge of wines .

The venue was very intimate and we received multiple compliments from our guests. Many wondered how we had found the place.  More than the venue the service at Volo was amazing. From the moment we first emailed, April was very responsive and never took more than 24 hours to respond to our requests. She coordinates all the events at Volo and did a fantastic job making sure all of our details were taken care of. The staff also immediately made us feel at home. It felt like we were a part of the Volo family.  Now, the food. It is something that cannot be ignored. The chef, Steven, has such a passion for blending unique flavors. It is not your traditional wedding food, which was exactly what we wanted. Everything is served buffet style with small plates instead of a large entree type meal. Another big plus is the drink options, we got the beer and wine package and they were great about accommodating our request for local IPA brews at no additional charge.

2015-01-02,1.0,"We've lived in the neighborhood for 5 years and have always wanted to try this place so were very excited to go here for a NYE dinner with another couple.  Unfortunately, after our experience, I don't think any 4 of us will ever go back.  We were seated on their outside patio, which was heated and had a cute ambience.  However, it was so freezing outside that condensation was building up on the tent and dripped on both us and our personal belongings.  However, we were feeling optimistic and excited to celebrate the evening so we overlooked the seating choice.  We both chose to do the prixe-fixe option with two of us choosing the wine pairing and the others ordering drinks a la carte.  We were served our drinks in a timely manner, however it was odd because both of the boys who did the wine pairing then spent 20 minutes waiting for the first course with the wine meant to be paired with it....okay, we were starting to get a bit annoyed and it just went downhill from there.  I won't go into details about the rest of the meal because another member of the group already reviewed in details.    However, to sum it up...the worst part of the evening was the attitude of the staff.  Our waitress essentially ignored us because I'm sure she knew we were starting to get annoyed with the service and just wanted to avoid us.  The food runner dropped our dishes off in a hurry without any explanation.  Looking around, it was obvious the kitchen and staff were overwhelmed as there were a lot of unhappy faces.  However, just a simple acknowlegement from any of the staff, a manager, etc. would have gone a long way.  Instead we got a curt attitude from our waitress and were told ""oh you didn't get your drink yet? well I ordered it"" ""Yeah everything is backed up"" without any empathy or apologies.  If I'm spending over 80$/person on a meal on NYE, I expect better than that.  I'm surprised if there was a manager on site that night, that someone did not take the time to visit all the tables and apologize for the delays or offer a complimentary cocktail, anything to salvage the evening. Very disappointing as the patio looked like it would be amazing in the summer and we all live in the neighborhood, but very confident that we won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",0.8132,0.867,0.08,0.053,0.557391899288451
2015-01-01,1.0,"Had a reservation for an early NYE dinner here with my wife and another couple. Unfortunately it was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. Food and service both were shockingly bad. Details below... Upon arrival for our 8:15 reservation, we were taken by a seemingly flustered hostess to a tent-like enclosed patio. Not exactly what we expected given the sub-zero windchills last night. This proved problematic as the restaurant's attempts to heat the tent caused quite a bit of condensation which, unbeknownst to us at the time, soaked our personal belongings over the course of our meal. We all four ordered a three course prix fixe special NYE offering. Two of us added pairings, while the other two ordered drinks a la carte. We received our first wines without food, which would become a common theme on the night. It was a good 20 minutes until the first course actually arrived, effectively nullifying the idea of pairings since I had already finished my wine by this point. My strangely giant portion of mushroom soup finally arrived, lukewarm at best. Despite the huge serving, the soup was served with a small teaspoon. If I had tried to finish it, I would probably still be eating it. While powering through this course, my second wine showed up with no explanation. We sat for another 30 minutes waiting for the second course to arrive. It eventually did - my pork belly was edible but nothing to write home about. Two people ordered the rack of lamb. One was served barely rare, while the other came out beyond well-done. Around this time the waitress noticed that my wife's second drink, ordered about 20 minutes ago, had not yet been delivered. Rather than apologizing or saying she would check on it, she simply walked off after saying ""Well, it's been ordered."" This was a fairly common theme on the night...I'm not sure if the waitress was embarrassed at the fact that the restaurant was so clearly in the weeds (I didn't see a happy face in the entire place - staff or diner), but she seemed to avoid our table at all costs. Up next was the longest wait of the night as we waited about 40 minutes for dessert. As expected, the dessert wine came about halfway through this wait and I polished it off well before dessert actually showed up. We had been pretty patient all night but finally one of asked if the desserts were on their way. The waitress replied with ""yes, everything is backed up tonight."" No apology at all. Dessert finally showed up, and it was the worst course of the night. My profiteroles tasted like sawdust - I took one bite and was finished. We sat staring at our food for another 15 minutes or so until I got up and asked the waitress to kindly bring us our check. She dropped it off a few minutes later with a simple thank you, and no acknowledgement of the fact that we all knew it had been an absolutely horrible experience. Ironically, when the reservation was made we were told there was a hard 2 hour cap on our reservation and we would be kicked out promptly at 10:15. By no fault of our own we left at 10:45. $350 later we left the restaurant feeling ripped off and still hungry. Honestly if they had made some effort to at least apologize, acknowledge the situation, or thrown us a bone in the form of a free round of drinks or something, I could write this off as a place not prepared to handle a NYE situation and give them another shot. Unfortunately, the entire experience was unbelievably bad across the board and no effort was taken to make us whole for that fact.

We were the first to arrive around 5:45pm and were seated in an enclosed/heated patio area. It was -3F outside and so were little nervous being seated here. Two minutes later, my wife was being ""rained"" upon; as in the condensation from the tent/canapé ceiling was dripping down. Can't blame the venue for this of course and they were happy to seat us at the adjacent table. Sadly, despite being next to the large heat generator, we were still a bit chilly. Our waitress was excellent. She guided us though the wine flights and helped us chose the right wines based on our preferences. Great choices too! However, the food, while tasty was far from generous in portion size. We ordered three different plates (the Salmon, Duck and Pork Belly) and we were still pretty hungry afterwards. We went on to order two different desserts; both of which again were tiny in size.  So here's my advice for this place. If you're looking for a quaint and cozy WINE BAR EXPERIENCE with fancy nibbles, this is the place.

In addition to being a frequent customer as we live in the neighborhood, my husband and I had our wedding here on May 17 of this year.  April, Dano, Stephen, and the entire team were all great to work with.

It was a chilly spring and we had freezing rain the day before.  Therefore the beautiful patio garden got a little battered.  The gardener come in and cut some of the flowers from the side area and placed them in the fountain to add a little bit of color for us. We chose not to have a DJ.  I was planning on having my niece cue up our music groupings (we had a processional song, recessional song, a cocktail hour list, and an after ceremony list).  April offered to do it for us instead.  How nice is that!

Later in the evening we ordered a carafe of the sauvignon and I don't see why anyone would get just a glass when for a few dollars more you end up with approximately 2.5 glasses of wine.  Our server was fantastic: friendly, helpful and when a larger group was seated, he made sure to take our order first so as not to be stuck in the kitchen queue behind them.  We really liked the small plates/tapas style menu. Started off with a cheese plate and then moved on to the lamb tacos, eggplant mozzarella, oysters, and fried chicken. All but the latter were great. Next time we'll definitely get something else instead of the fried chicken.  While I loved the back patio, the inside of Volo was great as well. Very intimate atmosphere--a great date spot. All in all it was a lovely evening and I'm looking forward to returning again!",0.9941,0.759,0.241,0.0,0.5471031746031746
2014-08-26,4.0,"Cabana-ing Got really giddy when I found a groupon for wine and cheese at Volo during barely warm weather last spring. The weather gods were on my side because we were able to sit in one of their cute outdoor cabanas. So cute, it'd make Barry Manilo bust out his tune. We had a choice of one wine flight each and a cheese plate to share. We picked piedmonte and pinot noir flights and a bunch of cheeses that came with jam, candied walnuts and some bread. Perfect little romantic spot for after a light dinner or a small bite if you're both anorexic. For reg folks, it is a great pre or post-dinner idea. Service was good especially since it was a busy night. For me the main draw is the back patio so I'm not sure if I'd go back just to sit inside. Yeah, the wines are great, I just like to sit in a cute setting while sippin. The inside just looks like any other bar.

2014-08-04,4.0,"So I went here Friday night with my BF and another couple. Overall we had a really nice time. We sat out on the back patio and it was very beautiful and romantic with the lamps and candles. We all ordered wine/wine flights and then a bunch of stuff off the menu.  Pros * The food was overall extremely delicious, and we loved nearly everything. The duck confit was spectacular, as well as the bacon, mushroom and goat cheese flatbread (yum!). We tried cheese plates and other items. Fried chicken was very good. Our service was also on point. And the chocolate pot de crème dessert with shortbread cookies was seriously my favorite part. Cons * The patio tables/chairs suck. They just do. This is a nice place. Maybe at least put cushions on the iron chairs? That would be nice. Or better yet, totally replace the table and chairs with comfortable, more roomy items. And we ordered the filet plate and yeah, I have never had to chew a piece of ""filet"" that many times in my life. That was a total letdown. Finally, the biggest issue I had here is the price. It's just too expensive for what you get. The plates are generally quite small with portions, but quite pricey. To actually fill up on food, you drop big. For the 4 of us, it was over $250. That's a lot, esp. for a wine bar/small plates place.  Overall we had a lovely time here, but honestly I don't see us coming back. And the only reason being is it's just too expensive. But if you have plenty of moolah, then check it out. Very yummy/nice.",0.9789,0.853,0.127,0.021,0.5931944444444446
2014-08-04,5.0,"I think this place is incredibly charming!  Came here with a group of 5 for some wine (we didn't order food) and really enjoyed our experience.  We were seated outside in one of the corner sections and loved it.  The atmosphere is really elegant and there is a good diversity of people.   The service was 10/10:  our server was incredibly knowledgeable about wine and was extremely helpful in describing the taste so that we knew exactly what we were getting.  She was even more helpful in my experience than a couple of the winery servers in Sonoma that I had when I was in California.  She came by enough times to make sure that we liked everything but not enough that it felt intrusive. The wine itself was amazing.  They have options to create your own flights with both red and white wine.   For the flights, you get 3 different wines to try with about a half glass portion which is pretty generous.  I also had a glass of red wine by itself which had a great finish.  If you can appreciate a good glass of wine, or just enjoy trying new things this place is a must.   The prices are not too outrageous for the quality experience and wine that you get.   This is great for a date spot or for a group.   Tip:  Sit outside if you can, the inside section isn't nearly as fun.  Also I believe they can rent out the space for an event, this venue is perfect for one.",0.9963,0.754,0.234,0.012,0.5954871293580972
2014-07-30,5.0,"Im in love!  The service is fantastic, the wine is amazing.  We did order food the first time we went.  It was ok, but I would just visit for the wine. Service: Fantastic.  I have had the same server.  A middle aged man with glasses and fun spikey hair.  He is very knowledgeable, helpful and constantly on his toes.  Sit in his section if you can.  He seems to always be there. Atmosphere: Great for a first date, regular date, or time out with the ladies.  Sit in the patio if its nice out.  The atmosphere is so relaxing and makes you want to cozy up and drink glass after glass with your guests.  When I went with my boyfriend we stayed till it closed and sat inside which had a nice warm feeling too.  When I went with a friend of mine we sat outside and enjoyed their covered back patio for two hours.  Its easy to get lost in the time there. Wine: If you can not tell from the five stars its great.  The winner is the fact that you can order  a taste, a half glass, a whole glass, or more.  I appreciate the portion sizes because I like to try several and create my own flight.  Though their menu does have flight options.  I prefer red wine and they have some great options for boldy, juicy, spicy wines with a nice long finish.  They will also sell you the bottle.  We made sure to take one home with us. Food: It was ok.  We had the muscles and one of their spreads.  It was ok. Nothing to rave about. Id go to Hop Leaf for either of those items first.  The wine won me over so much, that it really wasn't a deterrent to the evening. Price: Im a penny pincher and this is cost effective. 4.50 - 8 for a delicious half a glass of wine each.  Yes and Yes.  Sign me up!

For starters, we ordered the seasonal spreads which were quite delicious. We then ordered the duck confit, I LOVE duck and it was quite good. Our last small plate was the BMG flatbread. It had bacon, mushrooms, and goat cheese on it. It was ok, nothing spectacular. The best way to enjoy this place is to come in with a small appetite for food and a huge appetite for wine.

And oh, try their chocolate mousse and sorbets, it's a great way to end the night.

2014-01-19,3.0,"Cozy or cramped, your perception of this tight restaurant will depend on your definition of comfortable personal space and your BMI.  Thin people from large tight-knit families who grew up sharing bedrooms might like the set-up here, but I felt like an elephant in a horse stable.  There's a little more room in the patio than in the front, but then you might encounter condensation problems.  The patio must be nice in warm weather, however in arctic winter weather, it's covered only by a thin tent.  It must take a tremendous amount of energy to keep it heated, there are almost a dozen portable heater units back there blazing away. It's a little hard to ignore the environmental irresponsibility though it partially explains the high menu prices.  Of course they can't keep those heating units on when the restaurant is closed, so in the evening when they warm it back up to customer comfort, rivers of condensation run down the inside of the tent cover and drip on the customers sitting on the wall side away from the cabanas.  The Chief of Staff took a little impromptu shower at our first table.  We got moved to one of the cabanas, which was cute, but not exactly a comfortable way to eat and drink wine (very small, low table, really a coffee table).  Still, the patio is a tad more roomy than the claustrophobic front room, but some might like the long skinny high tables there for a large, skinny group of very close friends having a special occasion party.       Saturday night, we had reservations, but they weren't staffed for the crowd.  Our waiter was friendly and competent, but had too many tables, both in the front and in the back. It often took him a while to get to us in the very last cabana.  I think your best bet is to make a very specific reservation for the cabana table nearest to the kitchen door.       Prices are a tad high, which you might not notice at first, but the portions are tapas sized. You'll want to order a round of appetizers, a round of small entrees (the only size of entree is small), a round of desserts, and a new glass of wine with each course.  So, that will add up.  And, this will explain why I am rating this place at three stars, when I'm pretty sure the other three I was with would give five stars. This place is an excellent choice for wine lovers to sample different wines by the glass, but not as much fun for the designated driver.  I chose as my one glass one of the two house reds, a Portuguese Agricultura (delicious), but the rest of my table had a much better time ordering the (apparently) well selected flights, or recommended pairings.       I'm guessing that the menu here is actually planned to go with the wines, rather than the other way around. It's a limited selection but the cuisine is all food you  want if youre drinking a lot of wine.  I enjoyed my oysters, the  cheese plate combination, the eggplant entree might have been the best eggplant dish I've had, and the fruit torte dessert.  The wine and food came very close to being worth the almost $250 total bill (for four).    All in all, I recommend this place for couples or small groups of people who are very close, don't mind being very physically close, who love wine, and want a leisurely paced dinner.  You'll enjoy yourself more if you take public transportation or a cab, because the key to loving this place is drinking lots of wine.  This would not be a good place for a bad date, or some other awkward combination of people.",0.9985,0.786,0.177,0.037,0.5030204923802484

Starter: I had the ""Ahi shitake"", which I give 5 stars!!! Everything about the seared chilled sliced tuna with shitake tempera batter was PHENOMENAL!  A definitely must try.   Small Entree plates:  I had two small entree plates, as well did my husband.  --My entree small plate #1: ""Duck confit"" - The duck was really good, the red wine reduction sauce was great, just wish they would have added just a tiny bit more, because it tastes just that great with every bite. y entree #2 was the ""black and blue"", which was seared beef, with blue cheese potato, and wow! I never thought to like the blue cheese potato that sits under the beef, as much as I did.  It was just great! Both 5 stars! --My husband also did enjoy his 2 small entree plates.  He had the, ""marrow bones and toast"", which by the way he enjoyed more than expected.  As he mentioned, ""The seasoning in this bone marrow is really good"".  As his second small entree plate, he ordered the ""Swine and Tuna"", which he also mentioned to be very good.   The dishes at Volo are small, but the flavors of the sauces and proteins make up for perhaps the bigger picture one would wish to have.  Again, the flavors in their dishes make up everything and is completely worth it.

2013-11-28,4.0,"Neat place in Roscoe Village. Small plates, wine flights and a full bar for craft cocktails.  Started with a cheese plate with two wine flights. Wife had the red and I had the bubbly. Reds seemed to be Italian in origin so if you don't like dry wines, I'd say avoid the red. Bubbly flight had a nice selection of French and Italian bubbly including one that had a reddish tint as it was flavored with berries. Tasty. I guess the pours were OK but the flights are $16 and the total wine you receive amounts to about one to one and half glasses so a bit on the pricey side. As for the cheese plate, there are 6 cheeses to choose from and we ordered three which were served with walnuts, honey and a nice fig spread along with two kinds of bread.  Definitely perfect for sharing on a date.   We could have stopped there as the cheese plate was a decent size but we decided to get a few small plates to share after. We ordered the mussels ($13) and the duck confit ($12) and both were very good as well. Mussels were served in a nice broth with bread for dunking and the duck was cooked crisp but not dry and served on a bed of shredded Brussels sprouts with a berry glaze drizzle.  Both were nice and together with the cheese plate satisfied our dinnertime food requirements.  In addition to the wines, they also have a nice selection of beers and a menu of craft cocktails including some classics like the Old Fashioned and a French 75. You don't see a lot of French 75's these days... Service was excellent and I mean excellent. Never was my water glass even partially empty and wine glasses and finished plates disappeared immediately as they hit the table. Since it's a cozy place with small tables, I really appreciated that as there was not a lot of room to spare on the table top! This place makes for a great date spot with it's dim lights, food for sharing and extensive wine list.

We ended up ordering a bottle of one of the wines we tasted and when the bill came, it was only $40 for the bottle. Not bad.  * My favorite plates were the pork belly (YUMMMM) and the steak tartar. Everything else was okay.  * Our waitress was happy and friendly.  * It took about 90 minutes from start to finish, which I appreciated.  * Cute ambiance. I'd say romantic, but the close seating (see below) would make romance awkward.  Not So Great Things * The seating is set up so there is one long bench with tables and adjoining chairs across from the bench.  hate being squished into places... when I got up to go to the bathroom, I had to actually apologize to the people next to me as I tried to squeeze out of the table. I could clearly hear the conversations of people next to, which sucked.  * We had reservations at 7pm and when we arrived, there was only two other couples there.  Wouldn't you know it... the place was pretty empty, yet we got sat right next to one of the two couples in the entire place? I just hate that. Sit me somewhere else! However, by the time we left, every table was full.  * The beet salad= like eating grass. Not my favorite at all.

There was an attentive bartender who seemed genuinely happy to help his customers out, and if you want to stop in for a drink before an actual dinner you're fine. That's about all I can say positive about this place... Our service at the table was horrible. Being in the service industry myself, I can only hope our waiter Michael was a part time fill-in because he went out of his way to make a lot of very patient people feel very unwelcome. After about 20 minutes we finally got our first round of drinks and another 10 minutes later he came over to take maybe half of our food orders then walked away. Assuming he just couldn't remember the rest, we waited for him to come back. Finally my wife went to find him and ask if he could possibly take the rest of our orders.  Acting annoyed to be bothered, he finally made it over to take food orders from the rest of the table. Portions were very small which is fine given that we were ordering from a menu indicating as such, but we assumed it would be amazing, and instead the food was bar food average at best.  I'm assuming when the actual chef is in the kitchen things come out fantastically, but this night we were not lucky enough to have the one guy who justifies $10 for what amounts to two mini tacos cooked for us.   Paying the bill was a disaster.  Either our server couldn't add, had no clue how to work his POS system, or was flat out scamming money off the group.  I'd like to assume the best, but what started as an $800 tab (gratuity included) ended up costing us close to a thousand dollars. People would keep giving him money, but the bill never seemed to subtract by the correct amount.   Bottom line - come in with a couple people, sit at the bar, and pay attention to what you order - and you'll probably five star this place.  Come in with any sizable group - be very careful.  Last but not least, if your server says his name is Michael, asked to be relocated to a different area with a different server.",0.9727,0.848,0.104,0.048,0.5335257985257986

Our waiter Dano, talked us through the wine list and made some recommendations when we just couldn't choose. What he brought matched our pallets and set up for a great late meal.  We enjoyed the service and the method of receiving our food. Having small plates, there's was enough to share between the both of us - and they'd come out to our table at a reasonable clip giving us time to enjoy each one without feeling rushed. We had the moist and tasty belly sticks, the seared filet mignon which melted in your mouth, the duck confit (Dano's recommendation for the evening) that put every other Chicago restaurant to shame plus a cheese plate that to this day I can't remember which one it was.

2012-10-24,3.0,"So I ended up here with some girlfriends during Oysterfest. We wanted something to nipple on and to enjoy a glass of wine. So I assume some of the chaos that was Volo was attributed to the larger than normal comings and goings of the general population at large (good thing to know)..  For ambiance, I can definitely see this being a cozy, chill night with the girlies or intimate date. If you want some ruckus, you can have your fixins' at the community table or sit outside when the weather allows. So when we finally got seated, we looked at the menu and had a ton of questions. The server was pretty knowledgeable which is always nice. We opted for calamari, crispy chicken croquettes, marinated beats and goat cheese, and the mussels. I thought of our selection the calamari was my favorite and my friends said the liquid (not the actual mussels) was there favorite. The other items I felt were more bland than I expected, which was unfortunate. If I lived in the area, I would possibly give this a round 2, but since I don't.. it's hard for me to say ""you must go"".",0.8044,0.892,0.086,0.022,0.6471428571428572
2012-09-28,4.0,"Went last night for the 3rd or 4th time now and decided to finally write a review.  I think that Volo has gone through some significant changes in the recent past which has made it much better for diners: 1. New decor. Communal table idea is cool. There's more room to walk around now, which is great. Chalkboard wall is awesome. 2. New menu items. They recently re-did the menu for the fall season and we were able to try a couple things - they're all really good. 3. Service staff. Great staff (we were waited on by Erin - she's awesome. Very attentive and made some great food suggestions) My friend had the red wine on tap and she loved it. We split a couple plates: 1. beau soleil oysters - my first time having raw oysters. really, really good. definitely something i would try again. thanks Erin for the suggestion! 2. ahi tataki - i love me some ahi tuna, and this dish was really good. just perfectly seared and the oil that was drizzled on top was good. 3. roasted lamb tacos - a little too salty for me, but the dish overall was good. 4. black and blue - this is one of my go-to's and i'm glad they didn't take it off the menu. perfectly cooked sirloin and delicious bleu cheese potatos. SO GOOD. 5. duck confit - another new menu item. i'm not usually a big duck fan, but this was delicious. moist, perfectly cooked, well seasoned.  and to top it off, we got to try a cookie platter. pretty good desserts. overall, another great experience at Volo. Definitely worth trying at least once - and they have a great outdoor space in the back that is perfect for that special date :)",0.999,0.662,0.338,0.0,0.562585116033392

2012-08-03,3.0,"Volo was okay.  I'd go back for a drink but probably not for dinner.  One thing is truly exceptional though, the back patio/wine garden.  It is a true asset for this restaurant.  We did not sit there but we wish we had.  It is not to be missed. I will say that our intitial service was slow and this theme continued on throughout the night (with one exception, they guys filling the water were awesome/ninja like refillers, which I love). Wine list was pretty good but not that big for a wine bar.  Please add more.  And I liked the keg wine which I've read about in Food & Wine, etc but never tried.  Fun!   Also of note, the wine pours were wildly inconsistent.  I had 3 glasses of wine, and I'd call them the 3 bears.  Baby bear, 4 ounces, Mama bear 6 ounces and Daddy bear 8 ounces.  Obviously Baby bear made me mad and Daddy bear made me happy, but really we should be getting all pours of at least 6 ounces. Outlined below is what we ate.  Note these are small plates and we kept ordering them tapas style and they came out staggered, which is nice. Shrimp & Corn Fritters: Dry with minimal shrimp.  Skip them. Bone Marrow:  Your standard fare bone marrow.  Either you love it or hate it.  The serving was exceptionally large and they brought us more crackers upon request.  A few of the bones had slightly burned marrow but pretty good.   Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Very light and crisp for a fried item.  Well cooked and had a nice tang but perhaps could have used something to make it a little more sweet & sour.  Good but not great. Bacon, Mushroom, and Goat Cheese Flatbread.  This was just okay.  It was a little dry and the mushrooms dominated a little bit.  It needed some oil or something to soften it.  Black & Blue: The best thing we ate.  Cooked medium rare to perfection.  Tons of flavor.  Blue cheese potato was fun and very good. Our bill came out to $100 plus tip.  For 5 glasses of wine and 5 small plates that may be a bit above average.  In the end, the food is average at best, the service was a bit below average, the wine was good and the ambiance was great.",0.9982,0.716,0.237,0.047,0.5100831443688586
2012-07-30,2.0,"2.5 I was disappointed by Volo.  As my first outing via gDine, my man and I made a Friday night dinner reservation.  We were seated in their back outdoor patio area as requested - that was the high point because from there on out, things seemed to go s l o w l y downhill for the rest of the evening.   Our water glasses were filled promptly after we were seated, but we weren't greeted or acknowledged from the two waitresses for 10 - 15 minutes.  After staring them down repeatedly, finally the two waitresses converged nearby, and after some whispers and pointing to our table, one of them finally came over to greet us with a meek apology for the wait.  Mistakes happen, I understand that - but her apology was lame and she never did anything to make it up to us - like at the very minimum: provide us with good/quick service; or on the other end of the spectrum: comp us a little something?  Our gDine included a three course meal of 1 app, 1 small plate + 1 dessert.  We also opted for the wine flight.   App:  We both ordered the shrimp + corn fritters.  These were good; not great.  Several small fried fritters, with no real shrimp or shrimp flavor.   Small Plates:  - Bacon / mushroom / goat cheese flatbread.  This was loaded with bacon, too light on the cheese, with large mushrooms.  The flatbread was dried out on the edges and throughout as well.  You normally can't go wrong with mushrooms and goat cheese, but this was not that great. - Sweet + Sour Chicken.  Fried mixed pieces of boneless chx, good flavor / sauce.   - Tuna + Pork Belly.  (I didn't order this) Dessert:  The Sundae - ""cake"" aka a hard, overdone-brownie-like disc, topped with chocolate / hazelnut semifreddo, honey choco sauce + fresh whipped cream.  The semifreddo was delicious, but that ""cake"" was not cake, or if it was, it was very old cake.  The restaurant has a sleek look to it, and the outdoor patio is nice, but nothing about our meal makes me want to return - especially given the small (small) plates and highish prices.  Are my feelings due to our lackluster / slow / not that friendly or attentive waitress?  Were we treated as gDine outcasts?  I don't know...  But I was expecting much more from the food and service, and left feeling let down.",0.6962,0.833,0.092,0.075,0.5359397546897546

We brought the mice to the servers attention and she looked at us like we were the ones with the issue. I am not a fan of rodents, especially when concerning my food, so when I brought up the issue to the server I assumed a table switch, or glass of wine for our experience.. instead she basically told us not to freak to scare anyone else. Wierdest and worst experience ever! I'll never go back and would definitely never say it's chicago's best!

The wine choices are rather limited for a wine bar and our selections were meh.  The food ranged from mediocre to downright gross.  Everything we had was fried, breaded, over-sauced, generic, and lacking any freshness, flavor or delicacy of hand.  By the time we got to the cheese plate, we were expecting Kraft singles to come out of the kitchen.  The cheeses were tasty, however as one other reviewer noted, came without anything else on the plate (how about a garnish of dried fruit, a few nuts, a little jam to dress things up?).  For these prices, I really, really expected better.  We paid $100 for this mess and vowed never to return.   It's really a shame, because the space itself is so cute and could be so much more.",0.9431,0.767,0.137,0.096,0.521452380952381

Ask for some bread to get all the sauce. Everything else was either completely tasteless or worse, tasted bad.  The Brussell sprout salad had totally competing flavors and had the mild taste of stinky feet. It had no acid or brightness to speak of, only a thorough black pepper flavor that permeated the entire sad dish.   The Chicken and wild mushroom croquettes were disturbing. Not only were they dark brown and turd-like in both size and color, but they tasted imaginably just as bad.  We sent them back asap - our server was attentive and friendly, and took it off the bill for us. The sweet pea flat bread, which was highlighted on Chicago's Best, was just bland and mushy...the flavors just didn't go together and texturally was odd.  All in all, wasn't a great experience. I'd go back for wine and cheese, but really, what's the point of that?  Our bill for those 4 TEENIE tiny plates and 1 glass of wine was 50 bucks.

Service is where they have had the biggest hit.  There are a few new servers but we've had one in particular who could care less about service much less having a pleasant attitude.  We had to wait forever to order drinks and another round of small plates and each time we interacted with her she seemed downright unimpressed to be there.  We were going to give the server a pass because they were busy when we sat down but when my husband went into the back to use the restroom, he saw that the back patio had pretty much emptied and all of the wait staff were standing around talking.   I will probably give them another shot because the food (minus the oysters) remains a big draw to me but I may have to ask to sit in another section next time.",0.8156,0.863,0.085,0.053,0.317055167055167

The bartender was piss drunk, which was actually quite ridiculous.  He was so wasted that he didn't even greet us with a hello or drink offering.  It was more of a glassy eyed get the hell out of here followed by him running off to the bathroom.  I'm not sure if he was a mute, overly drunk or sick from the disgusting wine, but this behavior was completely unacceptable.   After the drunk wandered off, a waitress actually had to serve us at the bar and she seemed quite frustrated with the events as well.  To make matters worse, she said the kitchen was closed (not her fault) and they did not have oysters or cheese available.  If we showed up at 1AM, I could understand, but it was 10PM!!!  We were not given a reason why it was closed, and to be honest, I'm glad we didn't ask.  I knew we should have just left then, but we proceeded to order a glass of wine each from a very poor selection of reds.  Big mistake as the wine tasted like vinegar and was served warmer than room temperature.  This may be the reason the bartender was unable to speak and likely vomiting in the bathroom.  I'd rather go to Binny's and drink a bottle outside in a brown paper bag before ever setting foot in this joint again.  Shame on me for giving them a second chance.",-0.995,0.695,0.078,0.226,0.48681577681577687

Food wise, we decided to get an assortment of several small plates to share. The entrees ranged everything from mussels, beef tenderloin, roasted beets, marrow bones, ahi tuna, duck confit and many more. All really complimented the wine really well.

Tuesday came and went with no word.  My fiance emailed her a couple of times and no response.  We have both repeatedly called her and left voice mails but she never answers or returns our calls.

As a wine bar, they obviously have a wide selection of wines from which to choose. I typically go with a glass, although I have tried their flights which introduce you a variety a wines from different parts of the world.  The food that I've tried has also been quite good, although I mainly stick to the flatbread goat cheese, mushroom and bacon pizza thing. I'm kind of a finicky eater, and I do not eat many meats, so their menu is not the most tantalizing for me. I've always liked the flatbread, but the rest of the items don't ever seem that appealing to me because they are too meat-centric. There is not a whole lot from which to choose, especially if you have a particular palate, or prefer not to eat meat. The outdoor patio in the back is amazing.

I wanted to enjoy cocktails and dinner with him, so after seeing Volo's reviews on Yelp, I decided we should met there. Volo was such a pleasant surprise! The decor was perfect, and very much my preferred aesthetic. Dark, warm, and extremely comfortable with candlelight on each table and contemporary, but quiet, background music.  Our server was extremely pleasant and attentive, and when I didn't want to detract from my visit with my friend by perusing the wine menu for ten minutes, I asked her to bring me a glass of her favorite cabernet sauvingon. What I received was one of the best California cabs that I have ever tasted, and next time that I am there, I'll be sure to bring a bottle home. I ordered the sirloin which was seasoned and cooked perfectly. As it was one of the best steaks I've had in this city, I cleared my plate entirely, but somehow still had room for dessert. Thanks to our server's suggestion, my date and I shared a cheesecake ice cream sandwich drizzled in fresh strawberry sauce that was remarkable. My dessert beverage was a chocolate martini that was, again, the best I've ever tasted.  We paid our check but stayed for another hour or so, and our server still periodically checked to make sure we weren't in need of anything and kept our water refreshed.

The tartare is a little chewy, as the pieces are a tad large, but its raw beef, and its delicious. And they always have something on their cheese list that I love. However, their other dishes are so-so.

2011-03-06,2.0,"My experience at Volo the other night will, unfortunately, be my last. The service my husband and I experienced was unacceptable and so aggravating that it pretty much ruined the evening. We got to Volo early--about 5 p.m. Even though it was the last night to use a Groupon, we were there early enough to beat the crowd. There were multiple tables open, including several around us--it was not busy at all.  My husband dropped me off and then went to run a quick errand and find parking. The hostess sat me--she was very friendly. It took a while for the waitress to come over, and by the time she did, I knew what glass of wine I wanted to order. She took my order and left. I watched her attend to the other tables--multiple times--and waited. And waited. And waited. About 15 minutes passed by. At this point, I was pretty sure she must have forgotten the order because there weren't many other filled tables. She finally looked in my direction, and I gave her the universal, ""Oh hi, can you come over, please?"" look. She came over, and it was clear to me by her expression and the way she approached me that she had completely forgotten about me. I said, ""Oh, um, I ordered the glass of blah blah?""--I honestly did not say this in a rude or condescending way. I said it in the, just-want-to-remind-you-just-in-case-you-forgot kind of way. She gave me an incredibly flippant, ""Yeah, I know"" and left. She seemed irritated that I had inquired about it. By this time my husband had joined me. We both continued to wait. She finally came back with my wine, quickly put it down and then curtly asked my husband if he wanted something. He put in his drink order and she rushed off. We waited some more and made note of the food we'd order since we knew we'd have to put it in at the same time because of the slow pace of service. During the time we waited, I watched her bring bags of complimentary bread and dipping sauce to other tables. She did not bring any to us. When she finally came back it was the same thing. She dropped the glass off and was about to run off. We asked if we could put in our food order. Each time we said a dish, she said uh-huh, was looking around impatiently and about to run off--we felt completely rushed and as if even a pause to breathe would cause her to take off. She wasn't even looking at us. We finally got our order in and she ran off. About 10 minutes later she came by and said she had forgotten part of the order and asked us to repeat it. We told her again. There were no apologies, just the same impatient, annoyed attitude. When she brought out some of the food, she was literally acting as if we were nothing but a huge inconvenience and pain in the ass to her. She dropped off the plate and rushed off, not even giving us the chance to put in another drink order, even though our glasses were empty. When she came back by a while later, I asked if I could order another glass of wine. She again, stood there impatiently as I told her the name. She then started to run off without even asking my husband if he wanted something. We both sat there the whole night wondering what the hell was going on and why this waitress was so incredibly rude and gruff with us. I seriously wondered if she had us confused with some couple who had done her wrong in the past. It was a completely surreal experience. It's unfortunate--Volo has a pretty good, although slightly overpriced, menu--and a nice wine list.

2011-02-16,3.0,Like previous reviewers stated if you are looking for a great glass of wine and cheese this is a good option.  Cheese was excellent and it's served with awesome hot bread.  And we really enjoyed our wine.  However we thought the food itself wasn't very good.  My husband got a fried chicken dish over rice and thought it was horrible - no spices/seasonings at all.  I got sweet potato fritters which were tasty but expensive ($8 for fried potatos?).  Service was good - no complaints there.  So in summary it was average.  Would've been great if we just had wine and cheese.,0.9403,0.689,0.226,0.086,0.7264444444444444

2011-02-13,3.0,"Knowing I love wine and cheese, my super sweet boyfriend made reservations for us to eat dinner at Volo as our Valentines Day date. A few things factor into my rating of Volo and that is 1. that we rarely go out for a nice dinner so when we do we expect good service and good food and 2. we've both worked in the food industry and know what great service looks like.  Volo fails in both the good food and great service categories. A reservation was made for 9:15 and when we arrived, the hostess told us ""it would be a few minutes."" Two minutes later a couple walks in behind us, walks up to the hostess, and is immediately led and seated at a back, corner table. 10 minutes later, when we're still standing by the door with 3 couples who also had reservations waiting behind us, the hostess comes to us with some BS story about how ""I'm so sorry, someone just snuck into our only free table and stole it, so it's going to be awhile still, we'll get you some free wine."" Right - like we didn't just see you seat the couple at the table they supposedly stole.  Finally, at 9:45, we were seated. The wine flights were great, the cheese plates were great, the main course was so so. We got the pork roll and the lamb pot pie. The pork roll was nothing special while the lamb needed some serious salt.  Our ""free wine"" came in the form of two glasses of port to finish off our meal - a nice gesture to indicate they realized they had screwed us on our reservation.  Bottom line - hostess, if you do not seat people at their reserved time, give them a glass of wine immediately and do not make up some story about customers stealing tables. Be honest with your customers, that goes much further than a lie to cover your ass. Diners - Grab yourself some wine and cheese and move on to another place for your main meal.",0.992,0.796,0.156,0.048,0.6105042016806723

The cons- the service. Last time by boyfriend and I went, we swore our waiter was high. He didn't seem to understand anything we said and he had a full grasp of the English language and he kept forgetting things. He even forgot our to-go bag and left it sitting on the bar. Luckily, I was staring him down and saw him leave it there. The other con is the temperature outside. I looove the look of the patio but it gets stifling back there.

Half way through our bottle of wine and cheese plate, the server told us she didn't mean to seat us at the corner booth (which fits four) and politely asked us to move to a two-person table.  Even though that's bs, I said yes -- and she thanked us and promised a couple glasses of wine on the house.  As soon as I got up I felt like an idiot for saying yes.  We weren't going to be there for three hours...couldn't these people wait...? ...here is where it gets really bad. After 20 minutes, I glance down to the corner booth we vacated -- and low and behold -- there are TWO people sitting there.  They looked as comfortable as we did. So, that's it.  I'm pissed - you don't ask someone to move - especially if you just want to give your friends or whoever a better table. I asked for the check - she brought it - nothing on the house; full price -- but the good news is the two people in our original booth were having a really good time.

One of the best Duck Confits in the city, and the Tuna is outstanding.  Started with oysters and steak tartare, both exceptional.  Criticisms have been that the list is small, but i see this as a benefit. It means the chef is offering fresh seasonal dishes and the wine is changing with it. You couldn't do that with a bigger list. Also, for being a small wine list, it has huge variety, new world-old world; fruity-dry; at least a dozen different regions. Flights were available as well, seasonally or regionally themed. Another complaint i've seen is the slow service.

2010-10-18,3.0,"We had our wedding at Volo in September 2010. The service, ambience and food was great. But I want to caution anyone getting married here that if you plan to use your own iPod playlist as the music, you may encounter problems with the sound system.  We found that the music wasn't loud enough to support a dance party in the barn during the reception. This was a major bummer because I (the bride) love to dance.  I had asked the staff about this prior to the wedding and was told that no one had encountered problems using a playlist other than sometimes the sound levels of songs varied from one to the other but that if you had someone there to adjust the levels, we'd be fine.  That wasn't the case. We had a friend designated to making sure the music was adjusted but when we kept asking for her to turn it up, the message I got back was that a staff member had said ""If she wanted it louder, she should have hired a DJ.""  When we moved the dance party to the front of the restaurant, the sound levels were better, although not ideal. When I wrote to the owner after the wedding to raise the issue, he was apologetic, but said no one else had ever had this problem with a playlist.  I was surprised to hear this, so maybe it was a problem on our end, although my brother, who created the playlist, is very tech savvy and turned on the ""soundcheck"" feature and took other precautions to make sure the music was party-ready. (The playlist sounds great on my iPod!)

2010-08-25,2.0,"I really, really wanted to like this place, oddly enough, reading some of the other reviews now, we should have done our homework before buying the Groupon. Since we had a Groupon to burn (actually 2) and Volo was listed as one of the best Al Fresco dining experiences in TOC, we decided to give this place a try. Upon arriving, it appeared as though the Al Fresco was nothing other than the normal by-the-street-on-the-sidewalk type of seating.  So we chose to bow out on the al-fresco and bow into the al-dentro and headed into the restaurant to get a seat inside.  After a pleasant introduction by Simone, we needed a minute to peruse the wine menu, one minute though, turned into nothing less than ten.  After seeing someone signal their group to the back, the light bulb went on the bf remembered the al-fresco was at the rear of the restaurant.  So after a kind request for seating outside, we left the smell of the grill inside and headed out to one of the best treasures of Chicago.  Since cheese goes well with wine and Pinot Noir was my drink of choice for the evening, we ordered a plate of 3 cheeses, though recognizing they took a little longer than a bit to get them to us, they brought us a plate of 5 cheeses.  Manchego, Wisco bleu cheese, parmigiano reggiano, and a couple of others that still reside on the outer side of my left cheek. The ambiance was perfect, the night was sultry, and the drink was delightful.  The outside dining experience is one of the best we've experienced in the city, with delightful nooks for parties of four or less, lighting that would make even the worst of dates look sexy, and an intimacy that you'd want to have for that ever-so-needed date night with your love interest à-le-moment. I ordered up the halibut entrée, and although a high quality portion of poisson, and very well prepared, it really lacked the pizzazz, the olé, le manifique, or just the overall flavorful experience that makes you say ""wow"" under your breath after each enticing bite.  Just to make sure the vino tinto hadn't otherwise inhibited my taste buds, I asked le bf to try and he arrived at the very same conclusion. Le bf's entrée of popcorn encrusted scallops on a bed of sweet corn with a Tabasco-infused gastrique sounded absolutely inspiring when we were grill-side inside of Volo, but take note of the keyword here fellow yelpers: sounded.  After the arrival of the much anticipated creative dish that was one of the evening specials, we expected fireworks to go off and the popcorn to provide, well, that ""pop"" to this dish.  Let's just say the cliché-y ""pop"" wasn't popping.  I believe that innovative dishes with uncommon elements should ADD to the dish, and it saddens me to say that in this case, it completely detracted from the very-well prepared scallops and delicious gastrique. This will not be our last visit to Volo, namely due to the 2nd Groupon we have waiting to be used, but even if we were sans Groupon, we'd be more than willing to give Volo a second dining ""first impression"".",0.9924,0.876,0.113,0.011,0.48365468409586043
2010-08-23,2.0,"Oh, Volo! I wanted to badly to like you. You have a charming atmosphere and your marketing is sleek and sexy. As a novice wine fan, I was excited to taste a sampling flight. As a tapas fan (and someone who ate a little before dinner--oops!), I was excited for some small plates. But so sad, so disappointing. While the service was great, the restaurant itself was even hotter than it was outside. Two words--climate control. Call me spoiled, but I don't like sweating while I'm eating a nice-ish meal. Now I don't like to count things like service and atmosphere when I'm Yelp-ing something, but I did think it was worth bringing up.  On to the wine list. I started out with a fantastic pinot noir ('06 Brightside) that I enjoyed thoroughly. Unfortunately it was all downhill from there--granted, not a spiraling trip to hell, but more a slow descent into mediocrity.  I started with the special heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella salad that was light on both mozzarella and balsamic. While the tomatoes were nice, they were small and rather tart. Ryan had the other appetizer special, a wonderful gazpacho. Where the Brightside was my Brightside, the gazpacho was Ryan's only enjoyment. Between the two of us, we ordered the split pea flatbread, the BMT flatbread, the shrimp and octopus dish. The flatbreads were so-so, and the shrimp and octopus dish quite good so we netted out at 1-3 on the small plates.  To rewind a little, Ryan started the night off with a French Malbec (is that an oxymoron?), which he liked, but wanted something a little bolder as it was pretty mild. When asking the server for the biggest red on the menu, he responded with ""the Malbec."" Oy. Lastly, with our food I had the Spanish wine flight. I won't go into details, but I will steer anyone that does want to try Volo away from this one and towards the bubbles or the pinot noir.

(Check out the update at bottom)   Hold onto your shorts folks I'll get to the wine and food.  I was in the patio so I don't have scores to talk about on the inside but it looked nice enough.  The patio was nice but the tables are a bit creaky; but not concerningly (it's a word now).  The side tables with couches looked like a great place to sit back with friends and a bottle of wine but uncomfortable to be bending over to eat an actual meal. The service was great!  We had a waitress that really knew the dish preparations and was excited about them.  In addition she knew the wine which is always a good sign that the staff knows the product.  What was standout though is that she wasn't pushy in anyway.  She seemed more interested in our dining experience than her table turn over.  We tipped her about 25%...folks these people are trying to earn a living anything less than 18% unless the service is awful is just bad manners. The wine flights were nice and well priced but nothing to drive in from out of town for; same for the rest of the wine list.  My girlfriend and I just did some small plates as we were popping in and out.  The BMG flat bread was a great medley of flavors that played well with the perfectly cooked flat bread.  The sweetness and saltiness between bacon and goat cheese just makes you want bite after bite.  They do a scallop in a popcorn crust.  The idea is to add texture, a great idea, but a miss for me.  My girlfriend really liked it though.  Aside from the miss on texture for me the scallop was cooked perfectly, it was a beautiful presentation, fantastic sauce, and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Last but not least gets its own paragraph.  How many places can you find bone marrow, and at such a great price.  What a treat to have a beautifully prepared marrow with neat little breads and sea salt.  The rich and tender marrow meets the sea salt on your tongue along with the base and crunch of the bread; oh I'll be getting two this Friday.  Well done, I loved it! Prost, Cheers, Salud, Bon Appetit, and all those great wishes! Update!! I'm upgrading from my 3.5 to a full out 4, maybe even 4.25 when Yelp let's me have quartersies.  After another visit I'm marking this as a favorite!!  The inside was quite comfortable and the service was still great.  In addition to the fantastic marrow I ordered the mussels.  Do yourself a culinary favor and order the mussels and get another bit of bread.  The mussels were good but the broth they are steamed/cooked in is absolutely fantastic.  The garlic and wine come through with olive oil and butter in perfect harmony and is good enough to drink.  It is great for dipping bread into.",0.9997,0.656,0.318,0.026,0.6547413793103447

When we arrived the patio was filled so we gave our name and decided to have drink at the bar.  As we approached the bar, the bar tender gave us a fleeting glance and tried to avoid any eye contact whatsoever.  He appeared to be working in slow motion almost as if he himself were  under the influence of something. In addition, their who process seemed extremely cumbersome. Two people were behind the small bar stacking glasses one by one on the shelves on the wall. I'm not quite sure why the glasses needed to even go there. However the 2 stayed busy stacking glasses  while also avoiding eye contact at all costs. 15 min later we got a glass of wine.  I don't know if my expectations were too high because if the long wait or not- but I can't say much for the wine.   Or the food for that matter.    Yes we were finally seat after a little longer then an hour. Once we were seated, we were informed the patio closed in 40 min and we needed to hurry. We complied, enjoying the patio(the only reason I'm even giving 1 star). About 10 min before the patio closed, the waitress came to the table, informed us the patio was closing, stated ""I will help you move inside"" as she grabbed the plate right out from under me.

Anyways, I have heard great things about this wine bar and was very excited to try it, after purchasing a Groupon deal. My boyfriend and I thought we would go there for some wine, cheese, and dessert. As you can see by the amount of stars I rated it, the experience was horrible. Here it is in a nutshell:  After 15 minutes without a waiter or menu, we approached the hostess and asked for a menu.  20 minutes later and no waitress, we approached the hostess again and asked for a waitress.  A disheveled waitress appeared 15 minutes later, apologized, and quickly took our order for wine flights and one order of cheese.  20 minutes later the wine flights and cheese arrived and we thought it would be best to place a dessert order to be safe.  30 minutes later. No sign of our waitress. No dessert.  I won't prolong this story any longer so as not to waste your time like Volo wasted ours. In the end we spent 1.5 hours total at Volo and we received minimal service (and the service we did receive was when we sought it out).  On Volo's behalf, I do commend them for comping our order after hearing our story, which was nice, but the experience itself left such a bad taste in our mouths I don't think we'll go back.

2010-07-27,4.0,"The boy and I had a Groupon to this place, one last Chicago Groupon to spend before our move out-of-state!  We came here on a beautiful, warm Monday, hoping for a seat on their back patio.  The inside of the restaurant was almost empty, definitely making us wonder ""where is everyone...?  is this place any good?""  When we stepped onto the patio, we learned ""They are outside"" and ""Yes, yes, it is very good!"" Out back, the place is decorated like a garden, with flowers and Japanese lanterns.  There are several ""regular"" tables, and also a few....I guess I'd described them as ""cabanas.""  That's where we sat - on a cushioned bench with pillows, a low table in front of us, and white curtains hanging to the side.  Very romantic! Since we had a Groupon, we couldn't get their 1/2-off bottles of wine special - you can't combine special offers, but I guess I don't blame them for that.  Instead, I got their ""Summer Whites"" wine flight, which was lovely - they did have to make a substitution on one of the whites, but the replacement was lovely as well. We started with their bread and oil - the oil has two fat garlic cloves chilling in it, and their flavor deliciously pervades the flavor.  The bread was a warm mini-baguette served in white paper, like at French bistros.  We began with some oysters, which do come pre-dressed with cocktail sauce.  I did take a bit of it off - I like to really taste the oyster more than anything!  But they were delicious, and well-priced. We also got some cheese - the waitress warned us the portions were small and that we ought to get the ""pick three for $10"" deal, but actually one portion of cheese was enough for us.  We got a blue from Spain called Covadonga, and it was sublime.  We savored it for the rest of the meal, eating it slowly.  The boy didn't even want to eat it with the bread, since he liked the pure flavor of the cheese so much.  And it was a good-sized portion for two people! We also had the steak tartare, which was very good.  It was one of the boy's favorites.  He loved how the meat had been roughly chopped instead of minced (I did too), and it was mixed with wonderful seasonings.  We also enjoyed the roasted beet and goat cheese salad - okay, he enjoyed it, I LOVED it.  It wasn't wildly creative, but I'm just a sucker for roasted beets, cheese, and balsamic drizzle.  nom.  Finally, we had the prosciutto rocket, which is hard to describe.  It's basically arugula salad with gorgonzola and a pine nut dressing, but the salad is wrapped up into a roll of prosciutto.  Hard to eat, but tasty, it wasn't my favorite dish, but it was still very good.   That was plenty of food for us.  Too full for dessert, we rolled ourselves home.  I'm disappointed we're moving, I think this would have been a great restaurant to visit more regularly, and taste the different seasonal offerings.  Make a reservation and come on a weekday, and I bet you can get a seat outside!",0.9976,0.784,0.172,0.045,0.49727838827838833

The patio in the back is one of the best in the city, with little cabanas for you to sit in. The Patio alone gets a 5 stars! The food was nothing to write home about. Good, not great. We ordered the BMG Flatbread, the Cheese plate with Goat, Blue, and Iberico cheese, The Pork Belly, and The Sirloin. The highlight was the cheese....and the fact that despite it being a packed patio and fairly full inside the food came out lighting quick. The wine was good as well, we ordered from the flight suggestions.  Service was meh. Almost apathetic. The hostess needs a stand, too many people kept wandering back to the patio and trying to just take a table because there seemed to be no hostess or acknowledgement from anyone else on their way back.

She had made reservations for inside as we were told they don't reserve the outside area. When we got there tables were open outside so we took our chances with the rain since the patio is so pretty.  But there were reserved tables outside so I am still confused about that. Our server came over after about 10 min and asked if we wanted drinks but we were in the middle of opening gifts so she came back.  Apparently, the night before the oven went down so some of the main items were off the menu. Which was a bummer but no worries, we ordered small plates and 6 cheeses.  Then the rain started and we were able to get a table inside. That is when  things took a turn for the worse. We had to keep asking for bread, as it wasn't enough to make it around the table.  We had empty drink glasses and the place wasn't even that busy.   When our server brought out the cheese platter she plopped it down and walked away. When she came back we asked what the cheeses were and she huffed and spat out the 6 cheeses with no explanation. Then we asked for another bottle of white and this time would we be able to have it on ice since the last botle was left on our table with no ice bucket and it was 90+ outside? No problem.  The 4 dishes we ordered were not great and for having a big party, it being a b-day, and the stove being down you would think they would maybe up the portions but that wasn't the case. After about another 30 minutes we asked where our wine went and she snapped ""you told me to put it on ice so I put it in the fridge."" So we told her we wanted the check and she wanted to know what she was supposed to do with the open bottle. Umm, last time I checked the bar down the street even puts your wine in a bucket at your table.  My friend had to leave at that point she was so upset and our server comes back, throws the bill on the table, tells us she took the bottle off our tab and HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  I have never complained  at a restaurant before but I couldn't let this one go.  It would have gone a long way to have had a discount or an apology that night but that didn't happen. So we headed across the street to The Village Tap, ordered a basket of fab fries, awesome beers, and proceeded to have a far better time.

The roasted  beet salad Peaky Toe Crab, and Marrow Bones were worthy of a repeat ordering on our next visit, and all were excellent.  If you have not sampled marrow bones, I highly encourage you to put your inhibitions aside and be adventurous.  They were truly terrific and very well done. Wines are fairly priced and the service is excellent and filled with personality.   Now, if we can just find a reason to go back soon.....",0.9978,0.685,0.309,0.006,0.6341827000160333

Service well was...slow..the place was packed and there seemed to be only two waitresses there.  We waited for a long time just to put in our wine order and then our waitress ran away before we could order our appetizer.  We had to wait another ten minutes and stop our waitress so we could put in the rest of our order before she could run away from us again. We did get an excellent bottle of wine (a pino from Oregon) which the table next to us had as well (they had two bottles and got a third to go) and we ordered the cheese platter.  The cheese platter was excellent, I hate when you go to places and you can barely see the cheese you get, but they had excellent cheese portions here, plus it came with some raisin bread on the side.  My date and I agreed that it would have been a more impressive cheese platter if they threw in some grapes or nuts.   For entrees we shared the truffle potato ravioli and the duck confit.  I liked the combination of beans and arugula that was covering the ravioli, but I was disappointed by the lack of truffle flavor and found that the ravioli would have been better and perhaps less dry if it wasn't fried.  I liked the potato stuffing but it needed a bit more flavor if it is going to be stuffed into a fried ravioli.  But then again I am from STL where we know our toasted rav.  The duck confit which was good, but not the best duck confit I have had.  It was a bit more dry, kind of tasted like it had been sitting out for a minute or two too long) but it was the better of the two entrees.

The service was also great! Although we were a large group, the waitress was so understanding, even though none of us had made a decision very quickly.

I started the evening by walking to Volo from the Brown Line.  There have been way too many ads for horror movies on the tv of late.  Walking down Damen and Roscoe nearly sent me into fits.  Please don't mock me.  Folks are getting mugged up in this piece!  I made it to Volo and some of my friends were waiting on me.  They were concerned that we were sitting inside, rather than outside but I enjoyed the inside seating.  First of all, it was humid.  Eating food in a muggy setting is not what's up - so saith Johnny.  Also, the tables outside are low to the ground - like, 'have a tea party with a toddler' low to the ground.  Not.what's.up.  I would gladly trade all that for a climate controlled, grown-up table.  A waiter sauntered up to us and I was afraid it was HIM.  It wasn't.  Yes, this guy knew a lot about wine, but he listened to us, contemplated our tastes and helped us choose plates that made sense.  Since I am a World Market gourmand, I already knew what I would be sipping all evening - a New Zealand (Marlborough) white.  It was delicious.  Our waiter was quite helpful all evening - even going so far as to tell us about the wine special they offer on Monday nights.   Also delicious was the food.  We got a ton of small plates.  Being a non-beef, non-raw oyster eater, I didn't have everything but everything I had was great.  My favorites were the fried oyster, the prosciutto plate and the panini (which the waiter cut into six pieces so we could all equally savor the sandwich).  It was incredibly rich and terrible for your waistline...but really REALLY good.  Even after three glasses of wine and a stupid number of plates, our bill was very reasonable.   I have nothing snarky to say.  I have no crazy tales from the evening (well, I do...but that's another establishment).  I enjoyed great food, generous pours, attentive service and a warm environment at Volo.  I look forward to coming back.  Volo, you robbed me of my snark, but for that panini...I forgive you.",0.9956,0.743,0.19,0.067,0.5973836823836823
2009-09-03,4.0,"This place has date night written all over it- or a quiet night among friends.  The outdoor courtyard area has cabana's all along one wall for a bit of a private feel.  The patio also has several regular dining tables for a more traditional seating arrangement.   Upon arriving at Volo, the inside was quite dead  -8pm on a Wednesday night- the courtyard was nearly full but didn't feel crowded at all.  The weather was perfect,  a nice cool fall night - although it is only the first week of September!  Any evening chill was quickly dismissed due to several patio heaters placed throughout.   For a ""wine bar"" Volo is not pretentios at all and people were dressed anywhere between jeans and suits.  The staff was friendly, sommelier was very knowledgable about the available wines and offered helpfull suggestions.  One note is that this may be one of the most affordable wine lists I have seen in the City.  There are many bottles to chose from at less than $50 a bottle, and several available flights for $10-$15 which seemed quite reasonable.  I enjoyed sharing the summer white flight and then had a couple of mixed coctails - all well done.   We ordered a 2 small plates - average to large appetizer portions.  We had the steamed black mussels and the house cured salmon flatbread.  Both were quite good.  The mussels were as expected and prepared well.  I was hesitant about the flatbread at first since cured salmon can overwhelm anything but this is something everyone should try.  Very well balance flavors and the cured salmon was extremely subtle and nearly sushi-esque in both texture and flavor.   It is obvious that these guys know food and wine quite well.  The menu reflects the season and is well thought out.  I am glad I got a chance to check this place out and would go back in a minute.  This is someplace worth checking out. 4 stars instead of 5-2 reasons We had a to wait for refills on drinks-including water.  I think the cabana's make it a bit more difficult for the waitstaff to see if refills are needed.  This only happened once and after that refills were frequent.

Dean and Shad know their stuff.... inside and out.  It is honestly a pleasure to get Shad going on the cultural idiosyncrasies that lead to a particular  barreling technique used in some random village in the foothills of the alps.  And Dean will rattle off 15 wines that would go amazingly with that wad of stinky cheese that you just handpicked.

I came to Volo to have a nice dinner with my wine-loving friend, in the hopes that we'd partake in the wine flights Volo offers. Instead, she ordered a glass of white wine and I opted out of having wine altogether, which may have been necessary to augment the food. The menu was odd: a stained piece of legal-sized cardboard with symbols next to the food items to represent appropriate wine and food pairings. However, the server told us to ignore the symbols because their wine selection had changed and therefore the symbols were irrelevant. Weird. My friend had the Pan Roasted Chicken Breast with root vegetable cipollini onion hash, which she liked. But I was embarrassed for her because it was again, a small portion.

Most of the wines were lackluster, but I fell in love with the L'Ecole 2005 Merlot, and we ended up ordering a bottle to enjoy with our meal.  The meal was a real treat- we chose to do the small plates. The roasted beet salad with goat cheese was our amazing start. These two flavors pair so well, and the vinaigrette and greens served to enhance. Next we had the Peaky Toe Crab Salad. Yum! I might have to come back to Chicago just to get this dish again. Our table neighbors (this is when they started up the conversation) announced food envy just by the sight on our satiated faces. Last small plate was the Prosciutto Rocket. It was also yummy and paired nicely with good Gorgonzola, however, it was a tad salty.

I'd head mostly good things from other friends, and Volo didn't disappoint.   We had a reservation and were seated on time.  Overall the service was good:  attentive but not overbearing, and the waitstaff was helping in giving suggestions based on the size of our good and what she knew the portion sizes to be on menu items.   Volo, as you would expect, has a great wine list with price points for any budget, and a nice selection of flights (red, white, and champange) that were very reasonably priced.   The food, was, well....underwhelming.  We started with 2 cheese plates- each with 5 cheeses- served with sliced pumpernickel and baguette.  Now, I love me some cheese.  I felt like the presentation was entirely too stark.  Come on...gimme a tiny bunch of grapes!  How about some fig, some sort of jam, honey, crackers....anything?  To me, a plate of a few cheese slices and another with slices of bread isn't all the creative or mouthwatering. The other disappointment was the veal sweetbreads. I'm not sure what they were trying to pull, but what I was eating was not sweetbreads.  These did not at all resemble the slightly crisp, tender little treats I've had in other restaurants.  What I was served was crusted in what tasted like burnt breadcrumbs with a tough, almost bitter interior.  Blech.  It was hard to swallow.   On the other hand, there were a few items not to be missed:  Curried Butternut Squash Fritters (so good we ended up getting 3 orders), BMT Flatbread (Applewood Bacon, Mushroom, and Goat Cheese flatbread....delish), and the Rosemary Ice Cream for dessert.   If you aren't drinking, or if you are only have one glass of wine or a flight, you can definitely dine for under $30/person.  Who goes to a wine bar and only gets one glass of wine though?  Not this girl. In the end, I'd go back, but most likely not until summer when I can hit up what looks like a fab outdoor dining area in back (I only spotted it while waiting for the restroom as they were tenting it and setting it up for a wedding ceremony that was to take place the following day).",0.9937,0.807,0.154,0.039,0.5423306233062332
2009-03-17,2.0,"It pains me to write this review.  I really, really, really wanted to like Volo.  It has the makings to be my kind of place.  A wine bar, lots of small plate options, classy vibe inside and the kind of outdoor patio dreams are made of.  However, it just did not come together for me at all. The service?  Lackluster in every way.  Our server could not have looked any more uninterested in serving our table.  He was bored, unenthusiastic, didn't offer any suggestions and basically sulked around for the duration of our meal.  The timing of our food delivery was poor.  We ordered the cheese plate well before any of our main dishes, yet the cheese came out after our meals.  The only explanation we received was, ""Yeah.  The hot side and cold side of the kitchen operates separately.""  That's it?  When he saw that we barely touched our meals, I would have thought that he would ask if we had a problem with the food.  But nope.  Nothing.  Sorry buddy, but the restaurant wasn't even busy, so you couldn't have been too in the weeds to check in. I can forgive bad service if the food is great.  But you know what?  It wasn't.  The menu offered a selection of six cheeses, but Volo has only offered five of the six for quite some time.  UPDATE YOUR MENU!  I ordered the crab salad and the bacon, goat cheese and mushroom flatbread small plates for my meal.  The crab salad was just... gross.  There was a very thick mound of icky avocado paste on top of the crab salad that made the entire dish taste terrible.  I won't even get started on the red, salsa-esque sauce on the plate.  Yucky and ill-advised.  While my flatbread was good, it was so rich that it was nearly impossible to eat more than a few bites.  My dining companions also commented that the duck confit was dry and agreed that the crab salad was... off. Okay, so if the service is bad and the food isn't good, maybe it's a great value right?  I'm by no means cheap, but I thought the food was way overpriced.  The small plates (and they were just that: SMALL!) were about $11 each.  The larger plates were in the $20 range.  And my beloved cheese plate?  For a small selection of five cheeses (with no garnish, flair or anything) was $16.  I don't know... it just seemed to super expensive for dishes that were nothing special. So I paid the bill and with my tummy still rumbling, I asked, ""Can we go to Starfruit?""",0.971,0.805,0.119,0.076,0.6104994824016563

My original review (written prior to our nifty update system) previously stood at 2 stars until the management redeemed by contacting me and pleading their case for an add'l star... oh yeah, and bribing me with free food. Fine, bribery works sometimes in my book, sorry. However, in this case, bribe all you want Volo-ites, my opinion stands... you're sucky!  It's definitely not the worst of the worst, but is consistently disappointing. My waiter last night was so aloof and off-putting at one point I actually had to challenge his blase attitude. No, I'm not just going to sit here and be ok with off service... he continued to force-feed irrational excuses down my throat and it was at that point I resigned any attempts at enjoying my time here.  The dishes are not impressive by any means. Granted, some are ok (the flatbreads and butternut squash fritters), but some are downright bad (the peeky toe crab salad and duck confit)... the $16 cheese board features an anemic serving of incredibly basic cheeses (gouda, grana padano, herbed goat, blue, triple creme) and positively no accompaniments save a few small pieces of dry bread.

Ever since Kirsten F. reviewed Volo as her favorite neighborhood dining spot, I have been wanting to try it.  Don't you know, I showed up on her doorstep, overnight bag in hand, and begged and pleaded to go there.  Well, not really - but I would have! Immediately when you walk in, there is a cool, comfortable vibe.  Even on a weekday night, there were tables of people clearly having a great time, and we were no exception.  The atmosphere is dark with low lighting, rich and inviting, with a friendly staff.    We shared a bottle of Russian Hill pinot (great choice) and to go along with that, we ordered several small plates to share.  I was very impressed with the elegant presentation of the dishes.  To start, we had the steak tartare, which is so good I believe that it could convert a non-red-meat-eater into one.  It almost has an Asian flavor and is very spicy, served with flatbreads - I could have eaten a bowl of it.  Following that we had the fried green tomatoes - very tasty, and not heavy at all with a crunchy cornmeal crust.  Next we had the crab salad which was refreshing and light, mixed with avocado - a beautiful dish and a great presentation.  We ended with the beet salad which was delicious, with nice big portions of red & yellow beets, a perfect round of goat cheese, and lightly dressed greens. Oh, and by ""ended"", I mean that after we polished off that bottle of wine, we thought we would indulge in a cheese plate and a glass of dessert wine.   I had a wonderful time and Volo and would definitely recommend it - for a date, catching up with a friend, or a larger party - it is the definition of your friendly neighborhood bistro.  I'll be back!",0.9987,0.706,0.28,0.014,0.5504084967320262

It was too loud.  The music they were playing was extremely loud and that in combination with the really open floor plan made every other word in our conversations ""What?"" or ""HUH?"" The ceviche wasn't really ceviche...no citrus hint at all.

In one of my favorite neighborhoods, (Roscoe Village), very cool, laid back vibe, featured around one of my favorite drinks, (alcohol... I mean wine), and was joined with phenomenal and lovely company, (Brett D). We started off with a champagne flight, (cava, persecco, champagne for $16). Tasty. We then moved to our tuna salad, Ahi tuna slow cooked in olive oil served on a mix of bitter greens and with eggs, tomatoes, pea pods among other things and this was great. I wish a little more tuna but good none the less. Then it was on to the seared scallops, caviar and a quail egg. Very well done. Then we waited for our flat bread, (goat cheese, mushrooms, onions and bacon), which our server forgot to order. She apologized a few times and it was brought out shortly after. I liked it.  I really did. I thought the tables were a little small and felt a little cramped and service did seem a little slow. I know it was busy, but I just wished our server checked on us a little more often, well that and took the flat bread off of our bill. I'll probably try it again, mainly because of the interesting menu and the very affordable wine flights, I will just put my head on a swivel about the service.

The chefs and servers are what I consider true foodies - people who love food and want to enjoy it creatively without being pretentious or snobby.  The staff seems really excited to help you navigate all of the delicious offerings - and my favorite server always remembered us (and my food allergies).  The atmosphere is casually elegant, very comfortable.  Fantastic spot for a date. The outdoor cabanas are cute for drinks, but I prefer a table for dinner.  Parking in the area can be tough, especially on weekends. All in all, highly recommended.",0.9799,0.749,0.231,0.02,0.7066
2006-12-06,3.0,"For me, this is a ""one and done"" kinda place. It's the type of place that seems intriguing and you hear about - but not the kinda place you repeatedly go to and rely on. The wine is decent, albeit slightly more expensive and the food is not that great for the price you pay. There were 6 of us and we ended up paying $65 per person for a night out which included 1 wine flight, a 2 bottles of wine (shared), and food. If the food was much better, I'd say this was a relatively decent deal - but it wasn't. Here's what we tried - steak tartar, stuffed pork loin, goat-cheese, mussels, italian sausage, calamari, and a couple of flatbread pizzas. So we covered a wide range of options. In general, the food was slightly overcooked and generously oily. Neither of those makes for either good taste or lets you enjoy it without feeling gross later. There is such a thing as too much taste and overseasoning and this place is certainly guilty of it. The best thing ironically was the garlic olive oil and bread - since it didn't overpower your tastebuds like the others did. The service and ambiance were good - it's a smallish place and the location is good so you can head over to the Village Tap for afterhours.",0.9837,0.798,0.156,0.046,0.4547619047619048
2006-12-05,3.0,"A nice little wine bar that very accurately reflects the changing character of the neighborhood. The first few times I went there, the crowd was nice, the food was flavorful and excellent and the wine flights were thoughtfully prepared and nicely presented. Then I went for my birthday with a small group (7) of friends. Not only was the place packed with screaming swarms of social detritus (the type that gets swept out of a frat house the morning after a big party) the waitress added insult to injury by trying to screw us into double tipping. The service wasn't that good in the first place and then the '20% gratuity for parties of six or more' was added to the bill without a label. It wasn't until we had split up the tab (with ANOTHER 20% tip added in) and a couple of people had left that we noticed the big chunk of cash wasn't tax - there was tax on another line! Nobody likes getting screwed (figuratively) and I would highly recommend that you label things like that on bills.",0.9358,0.769,0.154,0.078,0.49483333333333335
2006-11-10,3.0,"I have been wanting to go to this restaurant since it opened last year. They have a GREAT special on Wednesday ($15 for a wine flight and a starter), so I recommend trying it that night. The staff is super friendly and service is great. I was slightly disappointed by their wine list, considering they have been voted to have one of the best in Chicago. They do offer almost all wines by the glass, but I still felt that it was limited. The best thing we ate was the garlic & olive oil with bread. The pizza was not what I was expecting at all. It was almost like a flatbread with a potato on top. The crab cake was really good to, but other than that everything was pretty average. In addition to having a poor wine list, I thought that the prices for the bottles were a little high. I don't think I would go back to this restaurant.",0.979,0.747,0.205,0.048,0.49013784461152876
2006-08-12,5.0,"I am reluctant to write this review -- have you ever gone to the airport, checked at curbside in minutes and then gone inside to see hordes of people exemplifying check-in amateur hour at the counter? Your first instinct is to grab a bullhorn and tell them to go outside -- it's much quicker, but then you realize: why make that line longer? Keep it your secret! Volo -- same thing -- it's a true find in Roscoe Village. Amazingly nice and welcoming owners (one of them owns Kitsch'n across the street), and some of the friendliest servers and staff in town. Out back? Small size Delano Hotel (Miami) style bungalows with votives and pillows! Totally romantic date night, and a menu to support the foodies. We had the small plate style ceviche, cheese plate, mussels and a delicate quartered 'pizza' (think flatbread). We also tried a number of wine flights which come in threes. At one point, we asked each other what spice was in the mussel broth -- it wasn't the norm -- and the busboy had overheard us. He went inside, without us realizing it, and moments later came back and told us every ingredient! What a nice gesture, and another kudo for this wine bar and restaurant. After our romantic evening on the back patio -- feeling like we were in some little beach resort restaurant -- we walked around the always busy, but classy, Roscoe Village, and enjoyed the walk and window shopping. So -- don't tell anyone else about these 'reservationless' bungalows in the back, and try to get there early one night before the end of Fall!",0.9942,0.829,0.166,0.005,0.4033333333333334
2006-05-12,5.0,"Don't be fooled, Volo is a really great wine bar.  If you are looking for somewhere open late and that is outside the craziness of downtown Chicago - Volo may be the answer.  Laid back enough for a night out with friends, but intimate enough that it is a great date spot - candle light, wine, outside seating --- this is what great dates are made of.  The only down side is cabs will show you the Tour of Chicago if you don't have the directions nailed.     Insiders tip: try the asian pears and the Victor!  Both are awesome.",0.9768,0.768,0.216,0.016,0.5024305555555555
