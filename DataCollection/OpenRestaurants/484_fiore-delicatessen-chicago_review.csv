In the case of Fiores this one star is completely deserving.  The owner is the most dry and emotionless person.  He barely looks up from the counter or acknowledges his customers, and when he does it's snappy, and short tempered.  I've had multiple experiences with this guy, but figure maybe he's having a bad day or just doesn't care.  That's cool, I don't expect a song or dance for spending my money, but I also don't like to be made to feel like crap either.  In a day and age with technology and delivery access,  one would think a small deli/grocery business would be eager to provide old school manners to their customers and keep that tradition alive.  *On a positive note, not sure if guy who makes the sandwiches with tattoos still works there, but he was always very kind.*",-0.8503,0.804,0.068,0.128,0.5234006734006734

If the fucking chairs are still wet and tacky why wouldn't you put a sign on them saying so, or even better yet close the patio.

2015-07-10,1.0,"I've been here about 6-7 times. I live nearby and have wanted to love this place each time and forgave a lot of things each time. But, my last visit I realized I am borderline vehemently against this place for the following reasons. Their service: hostile, or not friendly at all. It's almost been like i was bothering them when I've ordered my sub. I've heard them be especially rude to some Eastern European contracting guys, repeating the same thing when they didn't understand, not bothering to slow down or help explain. Then have witnessed totally different attitudes in the same breath to those they know. This has been consistently the case and I think as a business owner, it's shitty. Regardless of how long you've been there. The fact that you sound like a dick or just flat every time I go in, when I'm always polite, is shitty. This has been 2 different guys behind the counter, one of them who seems to be the owner.  Price: more expensive than Bari, vinnie's or any of the other sub shops. Quality: really upset about this, the amount of meat they put in the sandwich is shameful, they crumple the cheese in, and the tomato is maybe a slice and a half that they cut up into tiny pieces. Each and every time. I also can't help but think they would put more in if I was Italian or someone they knew. I once asked for extra meat in a sub and it was really sad and they charged me $1.50 more for it.  I also bought some Parmesan behind the counter once and the guy cut me a piece that was 70% rind, it was so offensive. I didn't discover till I got home and I was honestly intimidated to go back and complain. It wasn't cut like a triangle, or square, it was cut like I ordered rind w some meat on it. They would've never done that to someone they knew or an Italian looking person.  If the service was better, then I could excuse the jack in price and the shitty sub, that I actually enjoy in a guilty pleasure way. But I don't enjoy being treated like a second class citizen, being handed a crappily put together sub and paying more than I should for it.  This attitude in handling business not only upsets me but it's just not how you treat human beings, let alone customers.",-0.9118,0.763,0.101,0.136,0.4064814814814815

2013-11-08,5.0,"Fiore's is one of those neighborhood gems you should drive across town to support.  In a market of chain groceries and delis like Subway, 7-Eleven, Wal-Mart, and Walgreen monopolizing the landscape with their ability to buy processed food at much cheaper prices, the mom and pop grocer / delis are a dying breed.  And don't save this one out of pity!  Support them because they produce good fresh food items at affordable prices!  How do they do it when so many others fail to do so without charging a small fortune?  The other neighborhood gems in nearby Wicker Park and Bucktown would charge double for the same prepared items if they actually made them on premises.   I've been coming here for years and have ordered half their menu.  Their turkey, tuna, and caprese subs are good and I LOVE the Italian Sub.  It's one of the best around.  I like adding  prosciutto to the caprese, and I should probably start asking for extra mozzarella.  Their meatball sandwich is awesome too.  The Italian & meatball are what I crave. I catered a small group outing and everyone loved the food.  A few of the long subs go a long way when cut into 3-4 inch sections, and are a crowd pleaser.  It was all boxed up with all the sides and condiments to serve with it.  The meat and cheese tray is plenty of good eating for a group of men, but I don't think I will order that again.  Especially if you already have subs, it just looks like a big tray of luncheon meats and cheeses that you already have on the sandwiches.  The big olive salad was tasty and a crowd pleaser too. I like getting the individual ravioli and lasagna servings for a quick hot lunch.  I love that they sell them in modest sizes at modest prices so that you don't have to stuff yourself silly just because you are craving some pasta carbs.  Where else can you find a good fresh lasagna fast without being forced to pig out on a huge plate?  And you can also pick up family sizes in the freezer section to easily server dinner to your whole family.  My family was happy when I brought that home, and they like the tomato bread I threw in for good measure that was also a good price.  They have frozen soups too.  I tried the chicken soup.  I thought it tasted just ok, but I still have faith to try the minestrone next time.  Even if the flavors are just ok, its not much more expensive than the canned soup from the store & doesn't have all those nasty chemicals & preservatives, so its still a good purchase.",0.9973,0.782,0.19,0.027,0.4900943396226415

2012-11-05,5.0,I stumbled on this place walking to work from the Western Ave. Metra Stop sometime in late 2010. This was very fortunate. This is an old school Chicago Italian deli. They have extremely high quality ingredients. People come here to buy deli items to take home. The meats and cheeses are a much better deal than you can get at supermarket counters or even prepackaged. They have fantastic prosciutto at about half the price you can find anywhere else. You can get frozen pasta and sauces in the freezer case. You can also buy sandwiches and other ready to eat food at the deli counter. The food is a very good deal. They have some of the best meatballs and Italian sausage. You really need to stop by there for lunch to see the lines of people coming in from across the city to pick up a sandwich. The place is very popular so  call ahead your order and you will not have to wait in line.,0.9585,0.849,0.125,0.026,0.43572916666666667

Chicago was peppered with numerous wonderful corner stores such at Fiore's, where home made sausages, salads, where deli meats were hand sliced to order, imported specialty foods and most likely penny candy back in the day.  Today, we want everything shall I say too suburban, generic, modern and safe. ....And what did we end up with, c r a p!   Here Fiorie's offers the best of that old Chicago style corner store that when you enter really smells like something wonderful is happening inside. It's an exciting fragrance of something really cooking!
