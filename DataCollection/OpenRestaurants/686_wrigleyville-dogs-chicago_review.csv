Although the location was awesome since I was right in Wrigleyville, everything else about my experience was mediocre. The 1 star is because all of the tables were completely filthy. Not messy. Filthy. And oily. I didn't notice when I walked in because I was busy trying to figure out what I wanted off the menu.... and it was way too cold to eat outside with a 5 year old.  Something else that happened is that while I was eating, they were messing around with stuff and the lights went on and off. Seriously? I know this is no 5 star restaurant, but we were having a meal, nonetheless. It would've been nice to do it without the lights being turned on and off. Sure, it was only my daughter and I eating in there at the time, but we are customers and should've been considered prior to doing that. On top of that, no one said anything to me. No apology or anything. They simply didn't consider that we were having a meal.

The food is what you would expect of a hot dog joint in Wrigleyville - nothing spectacular and a little overpriced, but cheaper and higher quality than the stadium eats. We had the shish kebab plate and the gyro sandwich.  The plate was a hefty portion of rice, medium portion of chicken, green peppers and onions, a few lemon potatoes, a simple mixed salad and a side of steaming hot pita.  Probably not the best choice in a fast food joint, but my dad was looking for a healthier option and this was a safe bet.  My gyro sandwich was served piping hot, with a fresh pita and plenty of tzatziki sauce.  The sauce was more sour creamy than garlicky, which is my preference, but it did the trick.  Service is a little so-so. As other yelpers have noted, the woman behind the counter when we visited seemed new and struggled a little bit with language. She forgot to give us our soda cup and also gave us potatoes/pita with the plate though we had asked them to leave those off. We were trying to cut down on wasted food, but alas.

2013-07-07,5.0,"Wrigleyville Dogs is one of those places that you go to after a night of drinking with your friends and need something greasy to soak up all the alcohol you've consumed.  Right across the street from Metro, it gets somewhat busy after about midnight on the weekends. They have the best pizza puffs and chili dogs around, and they sell all of the basic after-bar food, ranging from gyros to burgers, all the way down to the cheese fries (which, by the way, I've heard are the best on the north side). The parking situation can be anywhere from easy to difficult, depending on what's going on at Metro across the street...or if the Cubs are playing (Wrigley Field is right down the street).  They have a lot, however it is a shared lot so if there's a major event going on, let the attendant know you're going to get food BEFORE leaving your car...and be sure to take it with you immediately upon leaving Wrigleyville Dogs - they have no problem towing you.",0.926,0.849,0.112,0.04,0.48434065934065945

There's enough just enough tables inside and outside to chow down with some friends before moving on to your next adventure of the day.

If you are out drinking on Clark St. this place is a goldmine for you because it's open extremely late and has all those foods you crave when you've been drinking. Customer service is great too. Think about it, these guys deal with all the drunk a-holes from the concert venues, baseball games, bar crawls, etc you name it and theyre always in a cheerful mood when I'm in there. They don't let one drunk/rude/idiotic person ruin their mood and then take that out on other customers like myself. There's even been a couple times when I was short a dollar or two and they've told me to just take the food and get them back next time I came in (which I always do, its just good karma). That's good service. It's cash only but theres an ATM right near their door and another Chase ATM next to the convenience store by the restaurant. The only negative thing I can think to say is that if youre going in there right as the bars close, you might be waiting in an epic line and have trouble finding a seat, but is that really their fault? Most of the bad reviews from this place seem to be people not getting what toppings they want on their hotdog or thinking the place is ""low-class"" or something...but I mean, you can ask what toppings come on a burger or hotdog before you get it. You can see the place isn't five star dining, nor do they claim it to be.

I just finished a chicken kebob sandwich that can stack up with a sit-down, white-tablecloth Greek restaurant. Deliciously put together in that there was plenty of chicken and lots of grilled onions and peppers, loaded with sauce. I'd always thought they made a tremendous gyros sandwich, but now I have a second sandwich vying for attention.  Lastly, I am impressed by their service. They're friendly and cordial and always speak in an upbeat way as if they're legitimately happy you came in. This impresses me because that's hard enough to do when that's your sole job, but these guys are also manning fryers, grills, and condiments. No easy task. Kudos to their service.

2007-10-25,2.0,"I think it confounds people that, as a ""victim"" of the much-hyped obesity ""crisis,"" I'm not much one for greasy burger joints. If I'm going to binge, I'd rather do it on something that won't travel up and down my esophagus for the subsequent 12-24 hours post-consumption. But every now and then you're just drunk enough when stumbling out of the Metro or the Gingerman (or one of those--how you say?--sports bars that are all the rage in the area), and you're mesmerized by bright colors and round light bulbs and you hurriedly jaywalk over to this place. You know better, but there you are. It will hit the spot, yes. And then it will hit it again and again and again. If you're luckier than I've been the few times I was the ""you"" in the aforementioned scenario, the burger you'll receive will actually be cooked in the center. Of course, I don't mind a rare burger at a classier joint, but at a place where the person who takes your order wipes his nose with the back of his hand? Not so much. The one thing I do like about this place, however, is the 's' found smack in the middle of 'Wrigley' and 'ville' that no one, Yelp and Yelpers included (edit: correction has since been made!), ever seems to notice in its name. It's unclear whether it was a purposeful choice of the proprietors or it was simply a typo the sign-makers made that the owners were too cheap to do anything about. To me, it hearkens back to a time before Wrigleyville was Wrigleyville. I don't know how long the place has been in business, but I like to picture it having been there at least 60 years and it being the first place to coin the term, only to have it bastardized later.  This is unlikely to be the case, but a gal can dream, can't she? Yes, I know it's a strange dream. But its existence upped my initial review from one to two stars.",0.8896,0.87,0.078,0.052,0.3354953475643131
2007-08-11,3.0,"This is an average hot dog joint on Clark near Wrigley. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but I don't think I've ever had bad food at a Chicago hot dog place. I just thought the place was a little dirty, and there are scary hippie/yuppie types that frequent the place, probably due to Metro being across the street. The guys working in there are friendly and very quick. A regular hot dog is $1.99. A jumbo hot dog is $2.35. They have a decent-sized menu for such a small place: burgers, gyros, ice cream and lots of other stuff. The establishment stays open until 4am and gets crowded once the area bars close down. Apparently, the parking lot surrounding the building is used as row parking during Metro shows, Cubs games, and for the bars at night. One time, I pulled my car in there for a quick dog and the attendants were demanding that I pay them to park there. Most diners seem to come by foot and not by car. Overall, I'd stop here if I was in the neighborhood or coming out of a Cubs game, but it is not my favorite hot dog stop.",-0.9532,0.842,0.038,0.12,0.5597406424992631
