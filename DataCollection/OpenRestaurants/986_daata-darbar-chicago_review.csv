2014-11-08,1.0,"This was the most disappointing meal ever. We have been searching everywhere for a restaurant that serves good egg biryani (ever since trying the dish in Hyderabad at Paradise Restaurant.. yummm). We were so happy to find that this place made egg biryani, and called in the order ahead of time. When we got there, the guy told us to wait 5 minutes (even though it had been more than enough time since we called it in) and finally brought out the food. It smelled good and looked promising, so we were excited. Normally good biryanis are not fully mixed up -- the white rice is still fairly separated from the curry/sauce which is embedded within, and you have to mix it all together when you eat it. That's what this looked like -- the white rice on top, with a few flecks of saffron here and there. But when we actually opened it up when we got home, there was no curry/sauce in the dish whatsoever! The guy literally served us a bowl of basmati rice with a few saffron-colored rice pieces sprinkled in and a couple of unseasoned boiled eggs thrown on top. It was also incredibly greasy, we literally did not even want to feed it to our dog because we thought he would get sick from all the grease (he normally loves rice and eggs as a treat). We took a picture of what the dish looked like after we dumped it into a bowl, to show that it literally is just a bunch of rice.

2013-10-15,1.0,"AVOID THIS PLACE. I'm an Indian myself, so perhaps I do get a little picky when going to Indian restaurants, however, this place is just horrible! My experience was as follows Late Sunday night, 12:40 AM, I got hungry. Everything was closed, and I saw that this place still delivers and it's indian! I had never ordered indian food before, so this was a first. Anyway, I call them and I ask a few questions about the food, and I order the Chicken 65 and Chicken Biryani, along with 3 Chapatis. So that was $6 + $6 + $2.50, the food was $15 bucks and the guy said delivery is $7 for my area. I said, fine. An hour and 15 minutes later, the guy arrives. I was neither angry nor upset at the delivery timing, I had expected this, since the place was about 20 minutes from my home. The total was about $25.xx, I gave the guy $29 and let him have the change. I then open the bag and get all the food out. The food was cold. I don't mean that it was undercooked, or the food lost temperature while the guy was bringing it over here. The Chicken 65 was literally cold. It was as if the food was just taken out of the refrigerator and the guy brought it here. Chicken 65 and Chicken biryani were both this cold. Surprisingly the Chapatis were warm though. I then decided to warm them up in the microwave and have a go at it anyway. Food was DISGUSTING. The chicken didn't taste like meat at all, it was just disgusting. I tried the biryani, disgusting as well. The chicken in the biryani was so disgusting as if the meat had expired months ago.  I was angry that I had spent about ~$30 for crap.  I then called them and told them ""What is this man, this is not even food, everything was cold, etc. etc"" After some discussing he agreed to have the guy come pick the food up again and give me a refund.  The guy shows up an hour later, gave me back $25. I was fine with it. The delivery guy was really nice. After the refund, he even stopped and asked me if this was my first time ordering from Daata Darbar and he'll check with the kitchen staff, etc. Props to him. CONCLUSION: Don't get this food. If you're feeling hungry and came across this on grubhub, IGNORE THIS PLACE.  On top of that, the few bites that I had out of this food, gave me some food poisoning. Took a really painful dump the next day.",-0.974,0.846,0.056,0.098,0.652422480620155
2013-04-21,3.0,"Late night ""hotel"".  In English terms it's a dive or greasy spoon which maintains late night hours.  During those late night hours the place is usually packed with dudes watching Indian or Paki television.  If it was during normal operating times of a day that I was jonesing ""Indian"" this wouldn't come to mind.  Late night however, is a much different story.  Know that there is probably a shit load of microwaving going on late at night.  Reheating of stuff made earlier that day.  Occasionally a regular customer may be able to coerce the cook to make an entree fresh even during those late night hours. I no longer visit for rice or curries.  I've had them and they are okay.  As Arpan S. mentioned in his review, it's about the rolls.  Specifically the Chicken 65 roll or a lamb (mutton) roll.  Wrapped pretty nicely in chapatti.  That's like a tortilla.  Your choice of meat filling with some lettuce.  Served with this gooey white chutney which looks shockingly like another white gooey substance my guy friends and I have shared laughs over.  The cost won't break the bank. Now I've been a couple times for late night eats and on average you could blow 45 minutes plus, to an hour of time waiting on food and then dining.  Ordering items one after the other can extend this time exponentially.  Indo regulars say calling ahead is necessary.   I was here just the other night and couldn't believe what was served on my plate next to my wrap.  The guy served it to the table with this foreign item and didn't think to remove it.  WHAT THE F&#% right?  I'm posting the photo to my Yelp profile, just to be nice to them.  I ordered a mutton roll, however I never said I wanted a hair.  My buddy asked if we should send it back, he spoke Hindi and didn't mind calling the manager out.  It was late and I wasn't willing to wait on another.  With enough booze in my belly and a prayer to the Lord, I could only hope I'd be okay.  WTF.",0.9536,0.875,0.092,0.033,0.547700983227299

It's hard to pinpoint what exactly it was we got, as I can't find a menu online and they didn't have any to give out, but as it's a buffet, there will be things for the casual fan of Indian fare--chicken dishes is creamy tomato sauces--and some more exotic things for people tired of chicken tikka masala. Again: Everything was very tasty, especially the chicken bryiani (one thing I do remember the name of). Not the nicest place inside, but that seemed to add to the authenticity: This is not a place dressed up for tourists or the aforementioned tikka masala crowd, but a place that seems to be a neighborhood favorite--it was pretty crowded.

When I was ready to pay, I approached an employee behind the front counter, then discovered that he was actually preparing food.  He directed me to a counter in the back which was unstaffed.  I waited for a while, but finally sat down again, at a loss.  As guests, we were completely forgotten about, apparently in favor of the news showing on the television.  After a while, a man appeared at the back counter.  When I approached and asked to pay he took my card and asked me to return to my table.  Dumbfounded, I did so, and later a young man came by with my card & receipt for signature.  Overall, this was about as close to a David Lynch experience as I care to get. In the end, I might come back if I'm in the area and forget that I've been here before.  I really enjoyed the food, but the service was just beyond bizarre.",0.797,0.821,0.092,0.087,0.5383445258445259
2007-01-11,5.0,"This is an Indian/Pakistani restaurant that is open 24 hours.  I went here last summer and have to say this food was amazing.  I got the recommendation from a friend, and I am glad I went.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but the food is great.  I tried biryani and the tandoori chicken and both were very good.  It is also very affordable.  Go check it out!",0.9442,0.75,0.228,0.022,0.6464550264550265
