2017-08-23,4.0,"#55 of 2017 Aug 21 Tagging along with our friends we walked into the restaurant with one table occupied.  Behind us came a smaller party from the neighborhood who brought their own hot chillis. I asked the elderly gentleman if this place is good. He said he lived here 30 ywars and this place been here long time serving good food. Nice. Although the staff wasn't into smiling they were on point with everything else.  Menus were delivered.  Waters provided to everyone.   They also served boba teas and smoothies using fresh fruits.  My friends ordered mango and watermelon.  I declined their offer to taste leaving them to their moment of bliss. As soon as I saw soft shell crab that became my selection for this family style dinner.  I thought there wouldn't be enough for our party of 5 but it was totally opposite.  Grateful I could have more than 1 although I did find the taste lacking.  It was still nice to have and would consider it on future visits. I found the sauteed garlic Chinese broccoli delicious.  The broccoli was cooked just right to tenderness but still hold a slight firm crunch.  I ate the most of this enjoying the light bitterness from the vege and the sweetness from the sesame oil.  I can order this with every visit. Mog ordered the crispy pata to our delight.  I was shocked to see this was a large order. About 2 and half  times larger and cost less for what we can get in Hawaii. It was super delucious too but not the bsmest I've had.  Ate it with the,sauce too.  Wished it came with lots more raw onions and tomatoes. BBQ pork fried rice didn't look like much.  Everything was colored the same.  Brown.  Putting it in your mouth was a whole different story.  There wasn't much pork but you could taste it about every other bite.  Small bits of it.    Still a nice alternate to the regular white rice.  A clear vegetable soup was a good way to start off the meal cleansing our palette.  The vegetables were correctly blanched or steamed to retain their colors and taste.  Happy to have anorher bowl as my last to clear the oils lingeeing in my mouth. I couldn't get into the salted smelt.  Maybe it's just an aversion to eating something that salty. High blood pressure, you know, gotta keep it down so I can eat more crispy pata. Another bland looking dish, the chicken vermicelli was nothing but delicious.  What a surprise.  I still wish it was presented with more coloe to be appealing.  I do recommend this as your blind order.   I graciously accepted some hot chillis from gentleman who walked in behind us.  They really were hot enhacing every dish for me especially the crispy pata.  Bring some with you when you come. It's a pan asian fusion menu wirh pages and pages of selections.  The good food coupled with the numerous goodies makes it worth the travel to this part of tbe neighborhood for more.  Come with a large party for ala carte to try many items.  30 should do it..",0.9979,0.782,0.182,0.036,0.49904717015011135

Chewy in exture, sweet, but not overpowering, fresh flavor. I always ask for extra tapioca, it's sooo good. I am not a fan of their food anymore. Some years ago got a shrimp dish that wasn't cleaned properly (yes the black stuff is shrimp poop ). Gave it another try after a long while, same thing happened. Im just put off, and don't eat there since than. When i ate there the food was pretrt good. Be prepared to wait as they get busy. Might be a good idea to call ahead.

I could easily eat this dish every time I come here, but there's pages upon pages of dishes to chose from.  The restaurant itself isn't very large, but eating on a Saturday at lunch time, we were seated immediately and the food came out in 15 min or less.  A big downside I think for asian restaurants is the poor communication between customers and servers and the lack of attention to the customers.

The menu is huge. Like, ""Sorry I need a couple more minutes but actually 10 more minutes please"" huge. Free street parking is ample on nearby side streets. I got the lemongrass chicken wings as an appetizer and honestly, there was nothing memorable about them. My boyfriend got the Korean spicy Chicken sizzling plate and I got the tomato rice with short ribs instead of the beef cubes. Both were solid choices and portions were huge. I would consider us to be big eaters and we barely finished. Service was very prompt and kind. I would also recommend the smoothies. 24 oz for $3.75-$4.00 was worth it. Our bill came out to be $33 before tip, so very reasonable.  The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because the short ribs were very chewy and almost impossible to swallow. Additionally, we were seated and our order taken before another table, but they received their food first. Between ordering and getting our food took 30 minutes.

2017-01-12,5.0,"I absolutely love this place! This is probably one of my favorite restaurants to go to for multiple reasons. The biggest reason I enjoy dining at Jess's Cafe is the food. They have such an extensive menu of pan-Asian dishes. That's very unique because you can come here and have Chinese, Thai, and Korean food all at one place without compromising the quality much like most buffets. I've tried various dishes here including Malaysian string beans, salt and pepper tofu, red chicken curry, Korean BBQ short ribs, and spicy Thai chicken wings. Everything I eat here is phenomenal - the spices, the temperature, the other flavors....ummphhh! I don't think you can possibly go wrong here. The second thing that I love here are the smoothies and halo halos. They are sweet, delicious, and fresh. The halo halo is pretty large here. But I always end up stuffing myself since it's so good. Lastly, the service here is awesome as well. They are very kind individuals who want you to enjoy their food. They are very attentive to their customers as exemplified by their actions (filling up waters, giving clean plates post appetizers, and asking if there is anything else they could do). Overall, I love this restaurant. It's a family-owned business with well-intentioned individuals who make amazing food!",0.9956,0.743,0.245,0.012,0.5514880952380952

No. You should be giving me a free drinks or something! 10% off at least :/  So instead of taking the money from my card she took it out of her employee's tip instead...

Even with all that food ALL OF IT tasted as if it was frozen and reheated. I order late an hour before closing! That's NO EXCUSE to provide crappy pre heated and reheated food!!! In our household we are Asian food fanatics and I can cook better authentic Asian foods than what they served us. NEVER AGAIN‼ I don't believe it deserves ANY stars! I hate paying for over priced food that taste horrible! If they couldn't accommodate and provide fresh food then they shouldn't have taken my order! NOT GOING TO EVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!

2016-06-19,1.0,"Food here is decent. I'd attribute the good reviews more so to the fact that there generally aren't any decent places to eat around the area. Therefore the bar is already set pretty low and anything that's mediocre at best gets decent reviews.  Customer service is HORRIBLE!!! If you like waiting another 30-60 minutes longer than the ETA they provide you for pick up or delivery with no apology (unless you consider a non-chalant shrug an apology) and indifference to the fact that they wasted your time, this is the place to hit up if time has no value to you. Honestly, they need to stop over promising and under delivering. You're much better off ordering somewhere else that serves better food, even if it's farther because that's still probably faster than ordering here.  This used to be my go-to-spot for Asian food but too many poor customer experiences and their indifference has forced me to look elsewhere.",-0.6749,0.768,0.106,0.126,0.5449999999999999

It took about 5-10 minutes before we got seated..they have a LOT of take-out orders and delivery. This place really remind me of Joy  Yee's. In fact two of the employees who work at Jess Cafe are from the Chinatown Joy Yee's. I remember them when I dined there many years ago - looks like they ventured out and opened a place of their own! The menu is big - just like Joy Yee's and they have all sorts of Asian food from Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, etc. It's an Asian Fusion place. They also make the fruit freezes with tapiocas like Joy Yee's. In fact I think it might be the same lady who made them at Joy Yee's who make them at Jess Cafe. My husband and I ordered few dishes - I forgot what they all were, but they were really good. Only thing I would complain is that it took more than 30 minutes before our food was served from the time we ordered.

They even have Durian Smoothies, which smelly like sweaty socks covered in moldy mushrooms but tasty so deliciously soft and succently sweet. You cannot visit without having one of those smoothies. Their service is impeccable. I swear they must of had the army come in and train them. When it's busy they all stand a little spaced out and watch the customers like a hawk. If you take a sip of water they are in your face filling it. If you drop your fork even before you pick it up a new one is already on the table. To be honest it's a little creepy, sometimes I like to not be bothered. But I appreciate the attention to detail. My only quaff is they sometimes fail to show any personality as if they are robots doing what they are trained to do. I gotta laugh at it sometimes.

The restaurant was pretty full but we were seated very quickly. All of the staff were friendly.  I must say that the vast menu kept me pretty occupied in trying to decide what I was feeling like eating. There were so many choices that looked and sounded so appetizing. I just couldn't make up my mind.  My roommate ordered a Thai tea along with a beef kimchi soup noodle while I ordered a taro slush with an order of Thai green curry shrimp fried rice. The drinks came first, I would say that there tea and tapioca were pretty average. Boba was a little on the underdone side and tasted like they hadn't been soaked in sugar. Thai tea was cloyingly sweet but that's Thai tea for you. Taro slush was a little icy and not as smooth as I would have liked.  First came the Korean beef noodle soup and all I can say is YUM! Nice broth with huge kimchi flavor. Only thing I would have changed was the noodles. Didn't really care for those too much. Great dish anyways.  My fried rice took a little longer and wasn't as tasty as I expected. I was hoping for that strong coconut creamy taste that you get from Thai curry but this didn't have it at all. It was just a little spicy, green in color and has some curry flavored. The shrimp were on the smaller side also. Tasty nonetheless.  We both left stuffed and satisfied. Excited to try the other dishes. Don't be shocked if I become a regular here! Haha",0.9966,0.773,0.216,0.012,0.5476648351648352

I always order the passion mango with tapioca.  my go to dish seems to always be the traditional korean beef and vegetables over rice with extra beef. That extra beef does take you a long way.

My general impression on all three is simple: Needs to be WAY HOTTER (temperature wise) and needs to have FLAVOR. That is what each of those three dishes were severely lacking. The good news is that the food does not taste overly MSGy or Salty, as compared to say Dragon Boat right down the street.  The sauce for the General Tso seemed like it would have been tasty, but again, it needed salt or something for the flavor to hit me. The Pad See Ew was also under seasoned and just generic warm temperature. The egg rolls were, well, not that hot nor that well seasoned, again! One of the big problems with this place is that you need to order at least $30 for a pick-up and at least $20 for a delivery.  I live two blocks away and the food took 35-40 minutes. Whatever, I was expecting that, however, given that I live so close it should have been warmer. Well, why didn't I pick it up, you may ask? See above!

When we walked in, it was pretty busy, which I took as a good sign. My family of 3 ordered the red curry shrimp, basil chicken noodles (not the exact name) and the house special sesame chicken.    My parents are really picky, so I was nervous about how the food would be. There have been previous disasters where they were not impressed by the restaurants I chose. But, we were not disappointed at Jess's. All 3 of us loved all 3 of the dishes. We were silent while eating, so you know it must have been good. Everything was really fresh and portions were decent. I knocked out a star because the dining area is kinda dingy looking. They could probably use a makeover, but that doesn't take away from the great food. I also knocked out a star because of the basil chicken noodles-- although it was delicious, the noodles are the very fat and flat Thai kind,  and alot of them were stuck together, leaving 2-3 thick flat noodles stuck together with no sauce or flavoring in between them.  We topped our meal off with some of their specialty drinks. I ordered the coconut milk with tapioca, and my parents shared a mango smoothie. I absolutely loved mine, I downed it pretty fast. Wasn't a fan of the mango smoothie, but i'm not a fan of mango smoothies anymore (I've had too many in my lifetime). If this place wasn't so far from me, I would go back in a heartbeat. But unfortunately it is, and I'm almost never in this area when I'm in the city. But I would recommend it to everyone!",0.9822,0.785,0.149,0.066,0.5567577030812325

So what made the food a 2?  Sub-standard meat. The meat in both my dish (Korean Beef Kimchee Rice Bowl) and my husband's dish (Korean Spicy Pork Hot Plate) was just not up to our expectations. For both dishes, the meat was cut very thin and was unusually chewy. I think there was tendon still attached or something with mine. I know that most of my meat was cut in a way where it was still all stuck together at the very end (so like it was all one big piece of meat and I had to keep pulling it apart to be able to take bites), it was like the chef just didn't take the time or didn't pay attention to actually fully finishing cutting the meat. Add to that the fact that neither dish was spicy (as advertised) and the Sriracha sauce on the table is seriously watered down, and dinner was just disappointing. What made the service a 5?  Incredibly attentive and kind wait staff who genuinely cared about making our experience good. Our server put into the POS system my request that my beef be made spicy and came back to check that the kitchen had made good. I asked him if they had any chili paste in the back that I could have, and he brought some out right away. It saved my meal. I wish there were something we could have done for my husband.  Aside from that, our waiter made sure that our water glasses were always full.

Nothing we ordered was good, only sort of okay.  The shrimp with lobster sauce (which is usually one of my favorite things) was borderline disgusting, as were the crab ragoons.  Everything we ordered was supposed to be spicy - no detectable spice, or flavor for that matter.  The rice was hard and stale.  Ew.   Bottom line: no flavor, everything is SO greasy - one of the only detectable flavors was oil, not worth a wasted meal or money.",-0.6287,0.799,0.082,0.119,0.6346491228070175

It stands out from all the Chinese carryout restaurants one would find anywhere across Chicago. Moreover, Jess Cafe is a Pan-Asian restaurant which means it offers dishes from a variety of asian countries. They had a very extensive menu--a plus. My mom had the Thai pad thai noodles and I had the basil seafood over rice. The dishes were authentically seasoned. My mom has a very discriminating palate and is a very good cook of chinese dishes and she found her pad thai very tasty and comparable to what she has had in Thai restaurants over in the Argyle & Broadway southeast asian neighborhood of Chicago. The squid in my basil seafood was very tender. I've had squid at other restaurants and it can be rubbery when the cooking is not well executed. Jess Cafe also had an extensive fruit smoothie menu made from their fresh fruit bar. I tried the red bean and coconut smoothie instead of the mango smoothie which I normally order no matter where I go. The red beans and coconut flavors blended well together. Overall, I'm very happy to find an authentic asian restaurant without having to trek all the way to Chinatown or Argyle & Broadway southeast asian neighborhood.",0.6964,0.928,0.047,0.026,0.3020289855072464

The egg drop soup is THE best, bar none that I have ever had. They make Korean dishes, Chinese dishes, and I think some Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Their egg rolls are very tasty, and their house sweet and sour is among the best I have had in a long time. Perfectly compliments the egg rolls without overpowering them. The egg rolls are perfectly crispy, not doughy. I order the chop chae with pork, pea pods, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and extra brown sauce. Whatever I want, they will do. The combination chow fun is awesome, and I love the white sauce and baby bok choy in it. They will also alter dishes for you upon request. Don't like onions? They will leave them out, no argument (like I have gotten at other restaurants!). The waitress even suggested a brown sauce for my custom dish, when I had asked for a white sauce. She said the chef had stated that the brown sauce would better compliment the dish. I took her advice and was not disappointed.  The amount of food you get is impressive and the prices are more than reasonable. The place is clean, the food rocks, and everyone is very helpful and friendly.

That would not have bothered me at all had it not been for the case that I was disappointed in the dipping sauce. Instead of serving them with a thai chili sauce, I would have preferred a fish sauce dipping sauce.  - I wish they had a pork option for their Vietnamese Spring Rolls. Someone at Jess Cafe called me after placing an order and sounded a bit annoyed that I did not specify the kind of spring roll I wanted.

We come here every so often JUST for thai iced tea. If you haven't already, check out my pic. It's huge. It's massive. It's delicious, and it's $2.50. My friend and I regularly order 2 thai iced teas each. Yes. We're that crazy. But it's so that much worth it. Anyhow, here's a few updates on some other things I've tried.  - They have almond cookies!! pre-packaged and ready to go. Pretty affordable! You can pick up a little box of 3 or 6.... I think the one for 6 cookies was a little over a dollar. More on the crunchy side (i like mine softer) but i'm sure the microwave can fix that. -vietnamese spring rolls. Wasn't too thrilled. Good flavor, but....the shrimp were spaced out so you get bites in between with nothing but veggies upon veggies =/. and the sauce was a little heavy with fish sauce. not so appetizing. -pad thai. Definitely go for shrimp, although sometimes there's not as much shrimp in it *sigh* and yet i can't resist - bibimbop. OMG THEY HAVE BIBIMBOP!! not the bestest in all the land, but a pretty affordable plate when you want a korean bbq fix. -korean bbq short ribs: also pretty good. Great portions!! (i still prefer going to a sit-down bbq, but these are great when i don't feel like smelling like char to eat out). favorites:  --The red chicken curry on the lunch special. -- orgasmic sauce! perfect amount of peanut. --shrimp wonton soup - i get it nearly every time. massive shrimp wontons. hint of sesame seed oil. delicious broth. --shrimp with lobster sauce -- some of the best i've had. can't think of a better one off the top of my head. -- yummy egg foo young. again, i get shrimp (yes, i do have a pattern going on, it seems ^_^) I can't tell you how many places mess these babies up. I know egg foo young isn't truly traditional chinese, but it's still a favorite for me. These guys rock on their egg foo young. I'm sure I'll update this review. Again and again and again.

I had veggie and shrimp before. Shrimp Shu-Mai- I'm not a fan of fried appetizers but this was pretty good too. Korean fried dumplings- Delicious and my favorite fried appetizer  Fried Fish Tofu- Weird but I enjoyed it. Not sure if I'd try again. Fishy rough tofu. - Beef Brisket Noodle soup- Soup has never made me happier.. this is incredible. Salt n Pepper tofu- This is just a plate of salted deep fried breaded tofu with some tasty vinegar sauce. It was good but it wasn't what I was going for when  I ordered it. I had never had a ""salt and pepper"" dish so now I know. Ma Po Tofu- This can be improved upon. It was a bit watery and I was highly disappointed. Next time i'll ask for extra spicy. I think it was only watery because of all the condensation on the take out lid. prolly better dine'd in. Thai spicy Chicken Hot Plate- This was delicious!!! Loved the ginger! Mongolian beef- Now I'm a HUGE fan of the now closed Chinalite on southport.. this is the closest I've come to that rich and delicious MB. This is very tasty! Beef cubes with tomato sauce rice- WOW this is SOGOOD tho I don't know whats so french about this. The rice is so delicious too its almost like sweet fried rice Malay Style Fish fillet- This was the best fish i'd ever eaten at a chinese restaurant... yummm!! Slightly breaded with a delicious tender-ness and a delicious coating of sauce and very tasty veggies. Steam Fish Fillet- trying to be more healthy. this is also the bomb. Loved it. Chicken Lo-Mein- This Lo-Men is crazy and much tastier than the average lo-mein Chap Chae noodles Chicken/Beef- YUMMY but yo need to cut this stuff because its long and more chewy than normal noodles. ITS SO GOOD THOUGH Fried Rice (veggie and chicken) This is a hearty eggy fried rice. delicious. - IcedMilk Tea and/or Thai Ice Coffee bubble tea: This keeps me up for days when its pure coffee. This keeps me up for a day and a half when its mixed with the Milk tea. The Milk tea alone is delicious. All the bubble tea is delicious.. Tho... I had a run in with Durian for my first time.

The main problem here is service.  It's one of those restaurants were the waitresses never smile and look at you like you are annoying them by being there.  There are plenty of servers and bus boys milling about in a largely empty restaurant, but try getting your check in a timely manner when you are ready to leave.  And god help you if you interrupt a conversation between two waitresses if you need something.

The dumplings are filled with shrimp and the broth is just awesome. The top it with a a chiffonade of lettuce, a handful of green onions, and a sprinkle of cilantro.

2009-12-15,3.0,"Wow, I'm surprised to see all the raving reviews. I guess I'm just not ordering the right things? For years I got excellent Chinese food from the restaurant that was here before Jess Cafe. When the owners decided to sell the place, I was pretty disappointed, but gave Jess Cafe a chance anyway. I tried their Chicken Pad Thai and didn't find it to be that great, so I never returned, opting to get my Pad Thai from places that could make the dish perfectly. A few nights ago, however, I decided to give Jess Cafe another chance. Unfortunately for me, I once again found their food to be lackluster. I ordered the spicy lemongrass chicken rice bowl and found it to be REALLY lacking in flavor. It was not spicy and I could only vaguely taste the lemongrass. Very disappointing. Their spicy Korean dumplings were okay, but mostly tasted like deep fried dough, due to the fact they had barely any filling in them at all. With a menu so ridiculously huge, I think that they are bound to fall short on a lot of dishes, and it definitely shows in all the food I've ordered from there. I realize they're trying to be the epitome of pan-Asian cuisine, but by doing so they're really sacrificing quality for quantity. I think stumbling upon their better dishes is a matter of trial and error, and I haven't been very lucky. Everything is fairly inexpensive, though, so it wouldn't hurt my wallet too much to give them another chance. Smoothies are great, though, and they have about 30 different flavors to choose from (go figure!)",0.9854,0.75,0.177,0.072,0.6216359447004608

Dawn wanted a peach smoothie, which she ordered with tapioca.  I sampled it and have to say that it was delicious.  It wasn't too sweet, and had a good, true peach flavor to it.  The tapioca had a kind of burnt sugar flavor which I liked.  And they sent it in its own bag, packed with ice!  How much better can the service get, I ask you?

Walking in the place is filled with lots of room, but feels very compact- so if you're wanting an quiet lunch/dinner then don't plan on it here. The place is very laid back feeling, but thats probably also because they were severely under-staffed. There was over 30 people in the place and there was seriously only 2 people running the front end of the place. That meant waiting a while for them to actually have a moment to get to you. I don't blame them, I blame whoever decided that 2 people were able to run the place efficiently. Even just having 1 more person would have made things much smoother for them. Anyways- beyond that the food there is excellent with amazing selection. They even have a large selection of teas and smoothies with the option to have large pieces of tapioca in them (which was very new to me.) I ordered the Chicken Fried Rice to stay on the safe side of things- and this always gives me a good idea of the quality of their food.  I asked for some peanut sauce on the side, and the lady responded ""peanut butter?"", so I had to describe what I wanted.. but then she responded with ""peanut butter?"" again... so I figured I guess thats what they call their peanut sauce. ;) My fiance is a very picky eater, and ordered the Pad Thai Beef and immediately when it was brought to here was very turned off by the smell.

The other weird thing about the place was how when we went to pay he told me the credit card machine was down... so they had to take down my credit card info... heres to hoping I don't see thousands of dollars spent online by some mysterious person. ;) In the end, I loved this place even with all of its quirks. The prices are at the right place- especially with how much food you get. And I can see myself coming back many times just to try all of the different dishes they have available.",0.9942,0.835,0.142,0.024,0.5281851617217471
2008-03-07,5.0,"After moving to Portage Park I started searching Yelp for good Asian restaurants that deliver to my new place. Jess Cafe has been on my list of places to try since I moved. My (now ex-)boyfriend and I stopped in there around lunch time on a Friday, it wasn't packed, but it was definitely busy and the clientele was very varied. We ordered fruit smoothies (strawberry lychee-  yum!) and some chicken dishes (both Chinese). I asked for mine extra spicy. While the interior is wood-paneled with some fast-food looking booths, it was sort of homey. It reminded me of the best greasy spoons we have back home in England. The service was super fast and pleasant- all the ladies who served us were really nice.  The food came out quickly and searing hot- the rice was cooked perfectly and didn't taste as if it'd been sitting around for a while like a lot of other places. My dish, while not spicy (to me- my boyfriend thought it was, but I think the sheer amount of kimchi I eat has destroyed any heat-sensing taste buds I possessed) had a delicious smoky flavour that only comes from a well-seasoned wok.  The portion sizes? Huge. I barely finished half my meal- and the leftovers heated up really well (which is a big bonus). Jess Cafe is also cheap- my entree was only $6.50, with more expensive seafood dishes hovering around $8-$9. The smoothies were a mere $2.50 and easily as good as Joy Yee's. Our bill came to just over $25 with a tip. I'll be back, simply because there's too many different dishes that I absolutely need to try.",0.9954,0.793,0.188,0.019,0.5193865345181135
