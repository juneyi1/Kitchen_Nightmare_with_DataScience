The food was really amazing-we did appetizer (arancini & bruschetta) and entrees (chicken vesuvio and spaghetti and meatballs) and honestly we were thrilled with everything. My only slight tip is that the server was great, but she seemed to be doing everything-host, server and bartender and she did well, but we did order cocktails (old fashioneds) and they weren't really right-too much soda and no muddling, and also it seemed like maybe she added grenadine?

For entrees we had chicken saltimbocca and veal marsala, and both entrees were significantly better than we've had at other places.

It was a Wednesday, so maybe weekdays are slow, but even if it took forever on the weekends the food is so good that I would be willing to wait and just plan on being there for quite a while. I got the Truffle Pappardelle which was so delicious. We started our meal with the bruschetta (amazing). We shared a couple of salads one of which I HAVE to mention, was the eggplant caprese (YUM). I tried the risotto dish and loved it. For dessert we got the teramisu and pistacio gelato. They have a great wine selection, as well. Our waitress was shy, but I found it endearing.

The busser took our coffee order because apparently the real waitstaff had gone off shift. The prices are too high for this kind of indifference, especially in a neighborhood with so many good options. Finally, OMG, the music. Whoever put that playlist together found the worst of both American and Italian pop from the 70s and 80s and then cranked the volume to 11.

2012-04-05,4.0,"It has typically been my experience that when you visit a restaurant solely based on its proximity to one's location, it usually doesn't end in a pot of gold.  However... I tried Leonardo's for the first time last night with a few friends and I can say that this place was an exception to the rule. The original purpose of our visit was to have some wine in a relaxed spot and then move on, but after one bottle we decided a few carbs might be a good idea and finally settled on the toasted ravioli.  The dish came with four large squares and was enough to share between us.  The filling was a creamy blend of osso bucco and goat cheese and was served with warm marinara.  The ravioli had the perfect blend of crispness and creamy richness and I'm relatively certain that wasn't just the wine talking. We ordered another bottle and I decided that a pasta dish was in order.  Having already relinquished my menu, I asked the owner what he recommended by way of pasta dishes with seafood.  He replied, ""I will make for you."" Feeling rather adventurous, I didn't bother asking any details and stepped blindly into the unknown world of culinary surprise. After what seemed like only a few minutes, a large bowl of pasta, mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari was placed in front of me.  I will preface this by saying that I typically prefer cream sauces when I order seafood pasta, however, after one bite of the wine sauce with tomatoes, my opinion was changed forever. My friends all tried a bite and I found myself staring at the bottom of a bowl much more quickly than anticipated.  We all descended upon the dish with fury and were in complete agreement that it was by far above and beyond our expectations. We didn't stay for dessert but I find that might not be my only excuse for having to return in the future.",0.9912,0.838,0.148,0.015,0.48900793650793656

I popped inside briefly to be sure it was BYO, and the guy said ""Oh yes, you can bring."" Maybe it was the language barrier, as I believe he was the busboy (mental note: ask the hostess!). We headed inside and found it peculiar that there was a full wine list, as you don't often see that with BYOs. We inquired with the waitress and she said sure we could drink our own wine, but with a $12 corkage fee! $12 to drink my own wine, NO THANKS! After getting over my initial despise for the restaurant, I decided to let it go and enjoy. Afterall, I read about the  BYO in reviews and NOT their website (which I never found, which is also an annoyance). All in all, their food was very tasty. The wine list was nice, and we stumbled upon a delicious bottle that we will try to find again. Service was good, but we were also one of only a few tables on a slow Sunday night.

2010-12-08,4.0,"Two weeks ago I was supposed to meet up with some friends at M Henry for brunch.  Even arriving early didn't help with the wait time and we were told it would be at least one hour.  My friends have kids (2 little ones) and apparently, kids don't have a shelf life that extends to a 1 hour + wait in the cold without food.  So we decided to venture down the block and see where we could eat within a more reasonable amount of time.  We saw someone leaving Leonardo's just as we noticed a brunch menu on the window.  This someone told us they just had brunch there and it  was really delicious.   As we were investigating the Italian brunch menu, a man popped out of the restaurant and welcomed us in for their first weekend offering brunch.  The place was empty.  No one was in there.  Normally this would have been scary, but since it was their first weekend offering brunch, we went inside.   Between the cold, the kids and the stranger's opinion, it sounded like pretty fantastic plan.   We were seated by the manager who was beyond friendly and helpful.  He asked us for our feedback and opinions on the brunch and in exchange we would receive our meal gratis.  We gladly accepted (well this is turning into a really nice morning!) and placed our orders.  Two of us ordered lattes, one coffee, one brewed iced tea and one apple cider for the kidlet.   Nothing remarkable there, but glad to see more than just brewed coffee on the menu.  Speaking of, the menu consisted of various fritatas to choose from, as well as an fried egg-tomato-cannellini bean dish, pancakes (for the kids), toasted itialian breads with jam and fresh salads.  I'm sure I'm missing quite a few offerings since there were only 5 us. The food was really quite good and a little bit different than a typical american brunch menu.  Most of their options were in the 8 dollar range, which is super affordable in my book.  If I could give an extra half star here I would.  The staff was extremely accommodating for the kids and even made a kid-sized portion of pancakes that wasn't on the menu.   I would definitely go back to try some other items on the menu and for the super friendly staff and great service.",0.9977,0.777,0.197,0.026,0.5558574879227054

2009-12-12,1.0,"My wife and I were excited about trying out a new Italian restaurant in our neighborhood, especially one that was so close to our house.  Even though Andersonville is know for it's many good restaurants, we have yet to find a decent Italian restaurant.  But anyway... When we walked in, we noticed the very nice bar and dining area, and were seated right away.  Although, I thought it was kind of strange that after we were seated, we were asked if we had a reservation.  The place was about half full, at 7:00 on a Friday, which doesn't seem like a good sign to begin with, but we thought that it just might be early. We ordered some wine, a Pinot Noir which was pretty disappointing, and proceeded to look at the menu.  I'm a vegetarian, and like at most restaurants, I have a pretty hard time finding things to order without meat.  I did see that  they had a pasta with arrabiata sauce.  I've had this dish many times at restaurants before, and I don't remember it having meat in it.  I also ordered a house salad, and my wife ordered pork chops.  The waitress came back a minute later and informed my wife that there were no more pork chops, but would she like a pork tenderloin instead.  She said yes, being more excited about the port tenderloin than her original order. I was brought my salad pretty quickly, and enjoyed it.  It had a nice light vinegar and oil dressing, with a nice combination of vegetables.  We waited like what seemed like a long time for our entrees to arrive, but we weren't in a hurry, so didn't really mind.  My wife's dinner looked more like the original pork chop that she ordered instead of the port tenderloin she thought she was getting, but it tasted fine.  , My  pasta with arrabiata sauce looked pretty good.  I took a bite of the pasta, and noticed that something tasted kind of funny.  It had bacon in it, which was kind of a surprise, since I didn't think that this kind of sauce would have meat.  It took a while to get the attention of our waitress (even though the place was not very busy), but she did stop by eventually.  I asked her if there was meat in the sauce, and told her that I was a vegetarian, and she proceeded to explain, very rudely, that their sauce did have bacon, and I should have read the menu more closely.  She then informed us that it was not her fault I ordered the meat dish, (even though I never implied it was), and that she won't charge me for it (how gracious of her).  She asked if I wanted anything else, but I didn't really notice anything on the menu without meat, so I declined, and just asked her to take my dish away. OK, I will admit that I should have been more careful when ordering, and should have asked up front if the dish had meat, but I didn't really think that this sauce had meat.  But, every restaurant is different, and I really should have inquired.  However, what was really disappointing was the very rude response of the waitress.  She could have just said, I'm sorry, can I get you something without meat, instead of giving us a lecture about reading the menu closely, and arguing that the recipe calls for meat.  The waitress than proceeded to ignore us for the rest of the meal. There are a lot of restaurants in the area, and I don't think any restaurant should be treating it's customers so rudely, especially when it was only half full on a Friday night.  And, is it really that difficult for a restaurant to put a couple of non-meat items on it's menu.  It seems that pasta and pasta sauce would be pretty easy.",0.9847,0.785,0.126,0.088,0.6122125601671057

It's just far north enough on Clark Street (at Hollywood) that it's off the Andersonville beaten track. As a result, the night I visited (a Thursday) it was deserted. Which is a shame, because this place deserves better. The restaurant is beautiful, and very thoughtfully designed. It's an open, airy space, with a bar and casual dining (cafe tables, stuffed chairs) on one side, and a dining room on the other. The bar is brushed steel, and the shape and texture are echoed in fixtures and accents throughout -- the host stand, the salt and pepper shakers, the bathroom sink. The Leonardo of Leonardo's is da Vinci, and a lot of thought has gone into the design and artwork. The menu is a mixture of traditional favorites (calamari, caprese, baked ziti) and some unusual offerings (18 hour ravioli, stuffed with osso bucco and goat cheese; grilled tiger shrimp with truffle frites). I had the grilled sausage and peppers appetizer, which was large enough to split (and only 7 bucks), followed by the frutti di mare (linguini with seafood in a light fresh tomato sauce). The pasta was satisfying, but not very exciting -- about halfway through, I had lost interest. I didn't save room for dessert, but I had dessert -- bread pudding with ice cream and a homemade plum compote. This was another huge serving, but kind of disappointing. The bread pudding itself needed a little something. Some of it was dry, and none of it was very flavorful. The compote, on the other hand, was terrific. It is a topping in search of a better dessert. Service was mixed. The host and manager both made me feel very welcome, and took care of my needs -- seating me, getting me a glass of wine, checking back with me. My actual server, though, was kind of a ghost. The host took my wine order because the server was not around, and I felt like I saw more of everyone else than I did of my server. The restaurant was pretty dead, and I realize that it's hard to judge service under those conditions. But my server did not feel like a professional. I want Leonardo's to succeed. Its heart is in the right spot, and it's a civilizing force in Edgewater. The prices are certainly right -- most of the the menu is under $20. I would/will go back. But my experience was not ""special"" enough that I would recommend it to my pickier friends.",0.9881,0.788,0.146,0.066,0.5821143671143671
2007-06-30,3.0,"If you're going to go someplace with your aging friends to talk with wonder about the extended adolescence you've found yourself in, Leonardo's isn't a bad choice.  It's north of Bryn Mawr, so you're out of the Andersonville hubbub, but not too far out.  The lights are low enough to make you think no one will notice your own aging features, but not so low that you can't look around and think how old everyone else looks.  And that 40th birthday party at the table behind you, very much like the one you'll be heading to later since your friends are falling like domino's, it lends a certain festivity to the atmosphere. But enough about the conversation, let's talk about the food.  I had a whole boneless chicken.  That's right: whole boneless chicken.  And it was good - darn good.  My fellow aging partiers had fresh pasta which was also very tasty.  We pulled a trifecta on the salads and each ordered a different one.  They were all excellent.  Price per person? $40 (incl tip) for salads, wine, dessert, coffee and mains.  A good choice - in fact a surprisingly good choice. A not so good choice?  Convincing yourself that you're aging more gracefully than your peers and then heading to Clark Street, south of Addison, where one of your stupid friends is having his 40th.  All of your prior convictions - any illusions that you're not pushing 40 yourself - will fly out the window with the first crowd of drunken 25 year olds blocking the sidewalk. The nail in the coffin? When you look at your wife and say, Honey, it's 10:30.  We have to go.",0.9953,0.727,0.218,0.055,0.5739732142857141
2007-06-29,4.0,"We have had dinner at Leonardos several times over the past three months and each experience has been great, the food is consistently good and service is on target. Jake (waiter) is very personable, attentive and helpful with the menu, he does a very good job to make your dining experience comfortable and enjoyable. The food is fresh and presented well. The atmosphere is very nice, linen table cloths, low lighting and great music. We definitely will keep going back to Leonardos. It is just a few blocks north of the hussle and bussle of Andersonville's main drag. I recommend it!  How can I forget.. Great Martini's as well!",0.9887,0.645,0.311,0.043,0.48864035087719304
2007-06-03,3.0,"I stopped by Leonardo's last night with a small group and immediately was impressed by the layout and design in the restaurant.  I think business would be much better if it was located about 3 or 4 blocks south.  At six o'clock there was only one table dining in the restaurant.  We were quickly greeted by our server who did a very nice job throughout the evening.  We started with a bottle of Pino Grigio and a few appetizers (a Sausage dish and Giant Shrimp dish).  Wow!  The giant shrimp were incredible.  We couldn't stop raving about the sauce.  The sausage appetizer was alright, but nothing made me think I couldn't make it at home with a little practice. For dinner we ordered the 18-hour ravioli and two ziti dishes.  The ravioli was stuffed with goat cheese and veal.  Tasty, but really left you still longing for more food.  The ziti dishes were hit or miss.  I had the baked ziti and was left very unsatisfied.  The pasta was rather soggy and the cheese was a little too overpowering.  The other ziti dish was very good though.  Overall a decent experience, but I won't be returning.",0.7638,0.86,0.089,0.051,0.5494696969696969
2007-05-14,4.0,"I'm reluctant to write a good review because I don't want this to become the next Hopleaf or Pizza DOC where it becomes impossible to get a table. That being said, I have nothing but good things to say about this place. First off, their Shrimp Scampi appetizer is probably one of my favorite appetizers in the city. Even people who don't like shrimp love this.  I usually get the pasta with Vodka sauce but I have never met anyone who was disappointed with what they ordered.  I also love the atmosphere; expossed bricks, nice lighting and one of the nicest restrooms in the city. Sometimes there is some cheesy 80s music but that doesn't take away from the good food, great service and reasonable price.",0.895,0.698,0.18,0.122,0.6455555555555555
2007-04-23,4.0,"We hit this place on a Friday night (had reservations... went anyway... heh) and had a lovely evening.  We were a party of four, we arrived right at our reservation time, and were seated right away. Relaxed atmosphere. Exposed brick, dim lights--but not dark--and just enough on the dressy side to feel like a special night out. The server was amicable and helpful; very knowledgeable about the foods, the wines, and pairings. Attentive, but not hovering. It took him a bit from when our table was cleared through the whole check/paying process. However, we were chatting a lot at our table, so it's not like we were being rushed out the door.  As for the food, all very solid Italian. We had two meat dishes and two veggie dishes. Being one of the vegetarians, I can only speak for the latter two, but our carnivores seemed happy. The GF had a rigatoni in a pesto gorgonzola sauce, which was fine. Nothing special, but fine. The waiter was very accomodating on her request to go easy on the gorgonzola, as he was with an olive request on another dish. Now, I had the risotto, which was on special, and it was AMAZING. So creamy, so rich, so flavorful. Chock full o' veggies and portabello mushrooms, and plenty of fresh spinich. But across the board, portions were ample: everyone was full, but not stuffed.  Also, the bread basket was kept full throughout the dinner (along with fresh dipping bowls), and we were never wanting for water. I'd definitely go back, either for a date night, or another small group outing.",0.9958,0.789,0.208,0.004,0.5206568144499181
2007-04-21,4.0,"After consulting the bf, we decided on a solid four stars. We went last night with friends and had an excellent time. The ambiance is fantastic: romantic, nicely lit, but not pretentious. Just nice. Though it's certainly nice inside, I wore jeans and a nice top and didn't feel out of place. We were seated right away, with reservations on a Friday night. Our server was exactly how you want servers to be: patient, friendly, and appropriately slow. He could recommend wines with ease, knew the menu well, and answered all of our questions without making us feel dumb. The food came at good intervals, too. We enjoyed the bread while waiting for appetizers, they came, we ate, waited a bit, and out came the entrees. The general consensus was the food is great. The risotto was by far the winner of the night: so flavorful and good. I had the giant rigatoni (and it didn't disappoint: it was certainly giant pasta!) with grilled veggies in a pesto gorgonzola cream sauce.  Told the waiter I wasn't the biggest fan of gorgonzola cheese, he said no problem, we'll go easy on it. The taste was perfection! All in all, it's a very nice place to go for a relaxing but romantic dinner.",0.9945,0.621,0.287,0.093,0.6828042328042327
