Each time the service has been better than great. Is there a word for that?? One server stood out above the rest. Teandra. She has such a welcoming disposition. When my wife saw her, she whispered our friend is here and we literally only know her from our visits.

The diner is cute and charming but also somehow manages to seem dirty at the same time. We started with the nachos and they were fine, but unremarkable. We split their well-known Radical Reuben sandwich, which was ginormous. We liked it, but there was so much sauerkraut that the bottom piece of bread got extremely soggy.

The service is friendly, the wait time was not too bad, and the options to choose from on the menu was incredible! We ordered the BBQ Wings, Sweet Potato Fries, Country Fried Steak, and the Tofu Scramble Deluxe. The BBQ Wings did not taste or feel like actual chicken, but the BBQ sauce it was covered in was phenomenal! The Ranch dressing accompanying was also just so perfect, the combo of the BBQ sauce with the Ranch made each bite so irresistible! The breading on the ""wings"" was a little too hard and made it difficult to cut, as many of the pieces were quite large and would not fit into the Ranch dressing cup. The Sweet Potato fries were just like any fries elsewhere, good crunch and nice amount for the cost. The Country Fried Steak felt and tasted like pounded and breaded chicken! The portion size was huge! The mashed potatoes were nice and flavorful as well. The gravy was tasty and made each bite juicy and delicious. The breeding here was also a bit tough, but after sometime the gravy softened it. The Tofu Deluxe Scramble is incredibly filling! The Tofu Scramble was flavorful and had the texture of eggs, just a tad bit on the dry side. The quinoa was cooked nicely, but lacked some flavor.

The biscuits and gravy and the milkshake were PHENOMENAL.  One of the best milkshakes I've ever had, including any milkshakes I've had before I went vegan. The rest of the dishes were VERY good with lots of flavor.  Lots of people think that gluten free or vegan means a pile of vegetables and no flavor, but Chicago Diner has broken all stereotypes.  Vegans and gluten free eaters should never go hungry again; Chicago Diner is the best.  I'm waiting for them to open up in Texas. :) The food was SO good that I went back the next day, Sunday, and ordered an insane amount of food to go and ate it all day.  I have to admin though that the milkshake is much better dine-in.  I got it to go, and it was still really good, but just not the same as when you can drink it right away right there with your whipped cream not squished under the to go lid. hehe :)",0.9913,0.795,0.168,0.036,0.578497536945813

So much so that it nearly negates the quality of the food (which On its own I would give 4 stars or a B- for vegan food). We waited 45 min for a table in a mostly empty restaurant. We came in today around 2:15,for lunch. The restaurant was not packed. The host staff (a blond girl and a slender male) were incredibly rude to our group.  The milkshakes, though tasty, took at minimum 10 minutes each to come out. We are confident the girl making them was stoned. (But At least she was friendly! Along with the other guy working the bar!) The host staff & server on the patio exhibited  passive aggressive & completely unprofessional behavior towards their customers.. not accommodating whatsoever. Our server could not remember to bring water, and when she finally did, she forgot to come by and fill it up. I know being a server can be a difficult job, but the patio was not busy today, and it was 90+ degrees out.. a lack of empathy and care of customers hydration needs. A black family with a small child were also made to wait for at least 20-30 minutes for a table even though there were clearly many open tables available.  Server was condescending about vegan products that members of our group asked about. She appeared to not want to be bothered by our simple Requests (again - the restaurant was not busy). 2 of our friends visiting us from out of town wanted to introduce us to a vegan restaurant & we're disappointed that this experience was a negative one. This place seems like it's run by stoned college kids with little/no leadership, zero experience in hospitality, and emanate a rude self righteous/exclusive attitude about veganism. Management needs to address this with employees. In terms of the food, The shakes were phenomenal. My friends gyros wrap was good. The beer list is ok. My cinnamon swirl French toast was dry. I think someone else at my table liked their food (tofu/eggs Benedict?) It's a shame because the staff in the kitchen is clearly working hard to keep their customers happy, but then the front of the house staff ruins it.

But I didn't know it came with whipped ""cream"" on top. The omelette was huge and really good, and the waffle fries too.   My friends, NOT vegetarian or having any food allergies were unexcited, but actually really liked their food.

2017-05-23,4.0,"I didn't expect to like this place as much as I did. I'm one of those people who loves meat, but my friend and I were in a pinch to find a place to grab dinner before heading over to Sidetrack, and DS Tequila had closed their kitchen early. So Chicago Diner it was. I got the Radical Reuben (with dairy swiss, because, look, I'm down with a lot of things. But sometimes a girl just needs her cheese to be cheese) with the waffle fries and the chocolate chip peanut butter shake, and my friend got chips and guac. I will fully admit that I was wary of the idea of corned beef seitan, but I love a good reuben. It's one of my go-to testers of if a place is worth checking out for a second visit.  Folks, my reuben did not disappoint. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that we were sitting at The Chicago Diner, I probably would've been willing to believe that it was a normal, meaty reuben. And then there was the milkshake. One of my favorite things is a good peanut butter milkshake, and this was everything I wanted and more.  As for my friend's chips and guac, that's where a star gets shaved off. Maybe it's because of how plentiful my plate seemed in comparison, but he got a small ramekin of really tasty guac, which seems like of silly if that's what you're going to sell the appetizer as.  On top of all that, our server was wonderful. So do I think I'm willing to give up my meat-eating ways? Nah.

We probably ordered too much food but wanted to get a good sampling of everything. Here's what we ate: Thai Chili Wings - I've had vegetarian/vegan wings before where they use a small wooden dowl to make it look like it's a bone-in drumstick, but eating seitan wings here was very different. It's a bit tough/chewy to give you that satisfaction of it being meat. The wings are coated with a heavy sauce, but I actually liked the other sauce that came with the wings since it sweetens it more.  Chilaquiles - I've had chilaquiles before, so I was hoping this would be a little different. You get a choice of eggs or with tofu. I chose eggs but in retrospect should've tried it with tofu. I usually joke about chilaquiles being just breakfast nachos and this was an overwhelming portion definitely able to feed 2 people.  Country Fried Steak - Just a large piece of seitan, battered and fried. I thought it was ok.  Chocolate Peanut Butter Milkshake - Probably the best thing we had although it's pretty difficult to mess up a milkshake. Tastes just like a regular milkshake as if it had dairy in it.  I don't know if we just had so much good food on this trip already. Or maybe my expectations were heightened, but Chicago Diner's food was just ok.

She checked to make sure everything was good after we had a bite of our food. She got our drinks first thing, of course. She asked us for boxes when she could tell we were slowing down/done eating. She didn't rush our check. It was perfect service.  Someone on yelp mentioned something about the water tasting bad so I was afraid to drink the water. I smelled and tasted it anyway. I'm usually really reluctant to drink restaurant tap water but the water here was fine. :) I think it may even be filtered. I hope it was, at least.  My mushroom lentil loaf wasn't bad. It wasn't off the wall fantastic but it's good for sharing. Sharing always makes things taste better. By itself, I can get tired of eating it real quick, but I ate some of another dish, and some soup, and some wings and went back to it so it was a good mixture of things to enjoy. Wouldn't mind ordering it again. Best thing about it is that it's vegan and gluten free! :) Soup of the day - lentil soup was perfect in flavor. Cup size is good enough if you're going to order an entree and or an appetizer. Soup is only an additional $2 with entree order. I appreciate that! :) Original wings were good.

I was hesitant that they might deliver a skimpy portion of avocado, but there was a whole avocado nicely sliced on top. The ambiance is very casual. In terms of seating and wait time - I've always came with one other person (party of 2) and have never had an issue with getting seated right away. However, the space is limited and I don't think that this is the best place for larger parties.

2017-04-02,4.0,"So, I was actually here a while ago. I've been crazy busy so it's been hard to post my reviews. None the less, here's my review of The Chicago Diner. As you all know by now, my Fiancée is vegan. I don't mind it, it gives me a reason to try new places and new foods and that's one of my favorite things in the world to do. Chicago Diner is one of those places. Menu is very extensive with options from all over the world. There are gyros, buffalo chicken, country fried steak, all available in vegan options! There are so many vegan things on the menu, you'd do better asking what isn't vegan! I had the Country Fried Steak, she had Buffalo Chicken and a Gyro, her mom had a Rueben. It was all vegan, and all absolutely fantastic! Country Fried Steak was nice and crispy and the portion was huge. Buffalo Chicken was most certainly the star here though! Great buffalo flavor, fantastic crisp on the ""meat"" and a side of vegan ranch sauce was the perfect partner in crime to help this dish steal away your need for actual meat. Didn't try the Rueben, but I was told that it was delicious. We had great customer service throughout the visit! Out server was very knowledgeable and patient while we deliberated over all the great looking options. Very attentive, never had an empty glass of water or coffee. Those in house made shakes were the kicker as well. A few options for ""adult"" shakes didn't exactly hurt! All in all, it was really a great experience. The one negative I have is that they do seem to have only the 1 form of vegan meat, and they just do their best to transform it into whatever they're making. Turns out very solid for the most part, but every dish does have a tiny taste of similarity amongst each other. That's not a gripe most people would have, but I figured I'd at least get that bit of info out there. Other than that, I say get your butt down to Chicago Diner, whether you're vegan or not. But what do I know? I'm just a Yelp Elite.",0.9936,0.818,0.151,0.031,0.565385689190037

It was pretty packed when we arrived at 10 PM so we waited about 10 minutes for a table to open up.  I got the Thai Stir Fry spicy w/ tofu and I loved it. The flavoring was on point and I love that there was plenty of veggies and tofu, they definitely are generous with their portions. My party of 3 shared the Thai style lettuce wrap (season special) and I loved it. The sauce that it comes with is super spicy so don't put too much..

Between us, we ordered the poutine (the gravy was gross), the butternut squash (tasted like just fried dough), the truffle meatloaf (fine but not outstanding and without truffle flavor) and the  mascarpone salad (basic). I was especially disappointed with my Portabella Truffle Melt sandwich. There was literally NO truffle flavor at all, pretty much the entire reason why I ordered it. It was just a basic grilled veggie sandwich you could get anywhere. Additionally, I was beyond annoyed that they don't serve Splenda/Equal/Truvia/Sweet n low with your coffee.

Looking at the menu options, everything pops, from the names to the choice of ingredients themselves. The nachos called to me so that's what I ordered for pickup. Unfortunately I left greatly disappointed! The one word that immediately came to mind was BLAND. Everything and I mean everything that made up those nachos were bland. There was no differentiating the 3 sauces that came with it except for the color, the guac was almost another sauce in itself. The chips were so stale, it was unbelievable. The cheese, bean dip, and seitan(which didn't even look like it was in there, neither did I taste it) were all mushed making it a big scoop of goop. I took my order a step further and ordered dessert. Luckily, the Caramel Crunch Torte revived my taste buds a bit. Even though it was very dry, the actual taste was delightful.

My friend and I were placed at a two-seat table right between two other parties of two, which wasn't ideal as I'd prefer a little more privacy, but ultimately it was fine. We both ordered black coffee and the waitstaff attentively stopped by to offer refills the entire time we were there. To start, we ordered the butternut squash fritters with vegan lime yogurt sauce. They came out to the table within 5-10 minutes. A very unique appetizer. The fritters are perfectly crisp on the outside and the tangy yogurt sauce was a great constant to the sweet/spicy fritters. For my meal I ordered the breakfast bowl: fried potato topped with tofu, two biscuits, and seitan sausage gravy. The texture of the tofu was great, very egg-like. The biscuits were delicious and paired well with the gravy. The portion was large though and I hardly even touched the second biscuit. My friend ordered the Karma Burger (sweet potato burger) with a side of Brussels sprouts and she raved about it.  All it all, this is a fantastic spot. The food is what vegan dreams are made of, service is excellent, and the ambiance is casual. A great spot to meet friends or have a date.

And I have to admit that these are my favorite buffalo wings I've had in this city - and I've tried a bunch of buffalo wings. They aren't too salty, the seitan is firm and crunchy, and the buffalo sauce is hot enough to give a little fire. I love them. Their shakes are also amazing. I've had them a few times and you can't go wrong with a shake - just pick your favorite flavor and you'll be happy!  I've tried the nachos and they're amazing. Loaded and the chips are strong enough to hold a heaping amount of toppings. Recently I tried their Titanic BLT Burger and it was amazing (do you see a theme?).

Got the BBQ 'Chicken Wings' to share, then gf got the Buddha karma burger, and while I got the Reuben. Large and interesting menu sifted through, we awaited our food, and were served essentially 5 minutes within ordering. To call them chicken wings is very much a misnomer, even given the vegetarian nature of the establishment. They arrived crispy and coated in sauce, but they were very distinctly wedges or triangles, and no one would mistake them with real wings(which I had the day before). That said, they were still pretty good. A little bit too sauced in my opinion, but they were incredibly crispy throughout the entire meal, the seitan was savory enough to be a satisfying meat substitute, and the dipping sauce provided with the wings was good. I saved some to spread on my reuben. Speaking of which, very impressed with that. Had I not been told it was vegetarian, I would have believed it was just a regular high-quality reuben. While the rye wasn't pressed like I prefer it to be, the sandwich was otherwise very filling when combined with a side of sweet potato fries, and a balanced combination of 'meat' to bread to sauerkraut to dressing. This is their famous sandwich for a reason, and I approve of that. As far as the Buddha Karma burger, I had a bite of it and the combo of pineapple and chimichurri was flavorful. Overall solid food that satisfies vegetarians but even meat-eaters if the quality is consistent throughout. Beyond the food, service was fast and helpful.

2017-02-14,2.0,"I was very excited to try The Chicago Diner. I'm definitely a meat eater, but I do indulge in vegetarian/vegan restaurants once in a while.  The food was delicious. We started off with nachos, which we inhaled because we were starving. The salsa tasted better than some mexican restaurants I've been to. The amount of nachos was perfect, one could even eat the appetizer as an entree. I ordered a hot buttered rum to drink because I was feeling under the weather. That was definitely something I needed on a cold day in the city. It was more like an horchata, but with rum. We ordered the spicy crispy chick'n with seasoned waffle fries and the black bean burger with balsamic Brussel sprouts. The food was great and the portions were decently sized. We could only finish half of our sandwiches. I still love my meat, dairy, and non-organic foods, but this was great. The left overs were demolished when we got home. For dessert, we were planning on splitting a large shake, but the blenderes were recently in flames... so we split the caramel torte a la no mode . So very good. So now. For the 2 star review: The service was unacceptable. When it comes to great or even adequate service, it's all about the little things- Right off the bat I knew I wasn't going to have an attentive server as he approached our table (after two apologetic statements of ""just give me a minute"") with his wallet in hand while stuffing his tip into it. Given the environment and the amount of time NOT being spent checking in on tables, as a common courtesy, when a customer needs something as simple as napkins or a refill on water it should be no tall order. Yet time and time again our server would appear to ""forget"" these requests. It wasn't only our table either, the patrons next to us made the same requests with the same results! They told the server they were ready to order, he said ""give me a minute"", turned his back towards them and proceeded to bus the table directly next to them (with a bus girl on hand). During their meal they asked for extra napkins (which were located a few steps away from their table) and he came back empty handed more than five minutes later..  The bus girl would barrel through the crowd never allowing guests to go before her to get to their table or to the bathroom. As guests, we thanked her every time she lifted anything off our table, (we even stack plates neatly and put garbage on top for easier clean up for the busser) her responses were a.) Nothing at all, or b.) ""Yeah."". No. Not okay. I completely understand if a restaurant is hectic, busy, and understaffed that a server can only afford just enough attention per patron in order to keep his or her entire section content, but this was unacceptable. To top it off, we were never offered a refill on water. Not once. We are never coming back to this location. They seemed to lack basic understanding of courtesy towards the people who are responsible for providing that magical 20-25% ""city tip"", which we are ALWAYS more than happy to provide.

We always have to be careful of what he eats and trust the servers AND be careful of what we eat and is on our plates. The Chicago Diner allowed us to be ""normal"" and he could have everything on the menu! Everything had a vegan option. In the spirit of solidarity, we all stayed vegan for brunch and we were not let down.  I had the Mexican Bowl with tofu and vegan cheese. 18 months ago I would never sign on for that but that was then and this is now. WOW! It was so good and I ate it all up.

We had a party of 4, got to the place around 6ish on a weekday, and NO wait, which was awesome. I really don't know when the place is particularly busy but I swear I bike past the restaurant so many times and I always see big groups waiting outside, so def call in advance and find out for yourself about wait time. I got the Titanic BLT and my husband went with the Cajun black bean burger. I personally thought mine was alright, it wasn't as flavorful as I'd like, but my husband was in love with his! However, I remember enjoying the sweet potato fries very much.  2nd time: Just about a couple days ago. I was craving some tofu, so I recommended this place for me and my gf. I got the thai basil tofu stir fry, and she got the spicy crispy chicken burger. Once again, my food was very meh, sadly. The dish on the menu sounds amazing, but what I got had too much sauce, so it was really salty, to the point I couldn't enjoy the chewy brown rice in it. The portion, though, was big, one can easily make it a dinner and still have leftover to bring home for lunch next day!

I was full but I wanted to try out there shakes which they advertise as award winning.  They are vegan which had me skeptical.  I got the cookie dough shake and it was so dang good.  Absolutely amazing.   If/when I go back I will try something else from the menu and get another shake.  Very awesome place with nothing bad to say at all.,0.996,0.687,0.28,0.033,0.6343358395989975

I had heard many great things about it, but I was still unsure because I had only been to one other vegan restaurant and it was a million times better than I ever could have anticipated, so how was this going to top that experience? Well, the menu, for starters. The menu has such a wide variety of foods. I had many things recommended to me, so choosing was hard. I ended up getting a peanut butter cookie dough vegan milkshake and vegan buffalo wings with vegan ranch.  First of all, the milkshake was the best milkshake I had ever had. I can't drink dairy, so rarely do I enjoy milkshakes, but I think I could maybe live off of these milkshakes and live a happy life. I also tried my friend's chocolate peanut butter milkshake and it was amazing as well. But I think peanut butter cookie dough combo is the way to go. The wings were some of the best wings I had ever had, and they weren't even real chicken. That amazed me. Another way that the Chicago Diner topped my previous vegan restaurant experiences is in the portions. I easily got more than double the amount of wings I had gotten from other vegan restaurants, for the same price. And the vegan ranch is better than most restaurant's ranch dressing. The wings were pretty spicy, but not too spicy. I also have a super high tolerance for spicy.  The place was clean, not too loud, and they played a bunch of early 2000's music that I love. The wait staff were all friendly, attentive, and checked in on us in a reasonable amount of time. I was in at lunch time during the week and it wasn't too packed, either.

I will say their carrot cake shake is pretty damn good though--- they bake/roast their carrot cake until it's crunchy and mix that in with their shake, so there's a good crunch when you're sipping that glass of deliciousness.  Ordered a cake from here and they totally dropped the ball. Waited over ten minutes while they tried to find it, searching in the back and apparently their multiple freezers all over the place. They had to write the message that I requested, and it was a sloppy job. I asked for the message to be written with blue frosting and the outcome was a splotchy blue and white frosting that they didn't mix the food coloring thoroughly enough. The writing was so sloppily done it looked like a 1st grader did it, and I could have done a better job myself. If you're going to make me wait 15 minutes for crap, at least put an effort in.

2016-05-10,4.0,"I am definitely a fan of the all too rare (in my neck of the woods) vegan diner, when I'm up for that stick-to-your-ribs kinda decadent fare... which seems to be when I'm traveling. I figure I wouldn't be so different if I were an omnivore. There's only so much of that kind of stuff you can eat, right? Truth be told, I was in the mood for an overfilled bowl full of veggies, rice and tofu (I'm boring) the night I landed here, but I was easily swayed by the seasonal specials menu. It's hard to review a place based on the specials menu, but I'm just appreciative to have so many options. Also, this place seems like it would be hangover heaven (not that I get hangovers... well, maybe once a year). Now, about those hearts of palm crab cakes... I urge you to order them. They are *that* good! Flakey, savory, cakes of goodness and the dipping sauces are excellent. This appetizer was so irresistable, that I couldn't help but finish both cakes, realizing I wouldn't have enough room for my main course. But that's OK because I really wasn't a fan of my main course. The flautas are flavorless, IMO, even with the ""creamy green"" salsa. I don't even know how this is possible. I added hot sauce, which really didn't help. Uh, even the side of guac didn't help, even though the guac is perfectly respectable and is great over those damn-good refried beans. So, that was my dinner... guac and refried beans. The rice didn't really do it for me either. Still, I am giving Chicago D 4 stars. I mean, you can get Prosecco! ""At the dinah?!"" (said in my best New Yawk accent, the capital of diners). You gotta love *that.* Bubbly with your burger (next time). Also, the crab cakes alone would have made me happy. And the carrot cake, which I took to go, wasn't bad the next day, either. And I like the wait staff. I kinda feel nostalgic for the diner thing, even though I'm not going to be expecting any kind of earth shattering food experience (well, maybe those crab cakes are just that).",0.9977,0.76,0.209,0.031,0.5901646776646776

My go-to dish is the BBQ Chic'kn Ranch Salad, hands down! Get it with BBQ Chic'kn! The Buffalo Chic'ken was good, but doesn't compliment it as well as the BBQ.

The burger was pretty good! Sweet potato patty with a nice sauce on it, sprouts, onions, and pineapples- surprisingly good flavour combination. I did not enjoy the mac n teeze however, as it had a rather plasticy taste to it and the noodles used were what you would find in boxed mac.

Chicago Diner's menu is one of my favorite veg places because it's so robust and they have lots of options you wouldn't think could be made vegetarian friendly. My favorite item here hands down is the Reuben sandwich. Even as a meat eater, I would venture to say this is the best reuben (meat or otherwise) that I've consumed.

My friends talked about Chicago diner for months before I actually made it there to give it a shot- and boy am I glad I finally made it.  - Ever since they first started talking about it, I knew I'd be getting the poutine- I've had veg poutine in the past in Cleveland, but the difference was that the gravy was a chunky gross looking mess. Here- it actually resembles gravy! However, Chicago diner uses a vegan cheese sauce instead of curds- curds would have made it SO much more authentic, in my opinion. That being said- I requested to change it to real cheese, and the waitress pointed out that they only have vegan cheese in that melty form that they use for the poutine, so we opted to take it as is. I've always been hesitant of fake cheese, but honestly, I didn't notice much of a difference!  - The Thai chili wings were delicious! Long strips of seitan (this was my first time trying seitan) in a delicious sauce! I loved the texture of the ""wings"" and absolutely loved the chipotle mayo type sauce they served it with. - the titanic BLT was great! The chipotle fire sauce on it was delicious and the burger itself was good- a tad bit too dry, but still good. The fried onions were a nice touch, although a bit soft and soggy. I opted for chili on the side and it was delicious- extremely flavorful. I couldn't figure out what the falafel looking ball that came in it was, but I enjoyed it!  - I tried my friends side of Brussels sprouts, and yum!

The menu is much more focused on breakfast and brunch foods, but dinner is okay too. I think for a place like this, it should definitely be BYOB. The alcohol is all pricey, when it really should be cheaper-- it's so casual here!

For those wanting a ""healthy vegan meal"" this probably isn't the place for you but that's not why I come here.  I don't really remember the taste of meat so everything to me is right on the money.  Recently I've been all over the spicy chickn sandwich but I've never been outright disappointed by anything here. My newest obsession is their bacon at brunch time. I was a bacon-a-holic in my meat eating days and this is the closest I've ever come to that same flavor! And of course I almost always end my meal with one of their bomb milkshakes. One downfall that keeps this place from a perfect rating? The service. Usually there's long wait times for a table. The servers are fine mostly and I've never had an awful experience however they run very slow and don't check in on you often. They can forget about drinks or to bring a check.

While we had high expectations and hoped to have an amazing experience like many Yelpers, ours were very disappointing for multiple reasons: First, we entered while both servers were taking their time speaking with a UPS delivery guy. My friend and I were patiently waiting to get seated and eventually took it upon ourselves to choose our seat. As the UPS guy left, we asked a server where she would like us to sit. She looked around the empty restaurant and condescendingly asked us if the booth we were standing right in front of would be okay. After taking our order, I asked the server if I can have ice for my water. She never brought it, even when she refilled our cups. I understand servers are very busy and think of so many things at once, but after their nonchalantly condescending attitudes, I did not feel comfortable asking them for ice again and again. Third, my friend's waffle fries were overcooked and really hard. We appreciated their understanding and gave her their Mac and Tease, but she did not think it tasted well. Vegan cheese just tasted like a powder mix with a slight taste of real/ dairy cheese. Nothing can ever replace dairy cheese. Lastly, I ordered their Make Your Own Brunch-- omelette, hash, slice of bread, and it came with a side of sliced cantaloupe and orange. I found a piece of hair on the slice of cantaloupe. Since I already ate the omelette, hash, and slice of bread, it would've been unreasonable for me to demand not to be charged for my food. So, I told the server about the cantaloupe and just asked for a new slice instead. She did not even react to the fact that there was a piece of hair on my plate - not even a ""sorry."" They did give me a new slice of cantaloupe, but I still couldn't take that piece of hair on my food off of my mind. I'm glad I was able to experience this diner, especially because it has been well-known, to say the very least.

This burger was so original and unique in all its components. My side of flashed greens was coated in garlic and I think a touch of vinegar and cooked to perfection! For me, really, a perfect meal. Their desserts are also phenomenal. The first time I was here I had slice of cake that changed my world!

THIS lentil loaf is pure magnificence. It has a deep rich baritone full flavored richness you rarely see in vegan meat substitutes. It is richer and more satisfying than good brisket. The mushroom gravy is also fine and the potatoes addictive. (The green beans are green beans. Al dente. Crunch crunch. Give up on em halfway through) My tofu scramble was like matzo brei from an 80 year old jewish pro. Totally wonderful - dry and firm (which is infinitely better than slimy and squishy. This is tofu we are talking ... okay?) Perfect breakfast fare even at nine at night. The accompanying vegetables and quinoa were very good for me. I did my duty and ate half. Dessert???? Get ready for decadence. Their vegan brownie ice cream sundae is the most romantic sensuous thing two people can eat together. Take the cab back to her place the nanosecond you are done.

When we walked in at about 6:00pm, we were greet by the hostess.  We told her we needed a table for two.  We were then told, ""The kitchen is running behind, so in order for them to catch up, we are not seating anyone.  You can stand at the bar or wait outside.""  There were several open tables and we asked why we couldn't just sit down and wait.  the hostess informed us that the manager told her not to seat anyone until the kitchen caught up. So, we either had to stand at the bar (we don't drink pop or liquor or go outside in the 91 degree heat and wait for the kitchen to catch up.  Neither was a good choice!  That is the silliest thing I ever had a restaurant tell me.  That manager and hostess should both be removed from their duties or be retrained on customer service.  I will never go to the Halsted location again! We did end up eating at the Logan Square location, which was delicious!  That will be reviewed separately.

I had the Thai chili wings for an appetizer, so good! They could have used some heat, but a little sriracha sauce solved that. The sauce that came with them was delish as well. For my entree, I had the avocado tostadas with the seitan chorizo. All I have to say about those is yum! To drink, I ordered a hard lemonade, which was very weak, but when I mentioned that to the waitress she made me one herself and hooked me up with a little more vodka. :) I'm happy with my visit and I'm definitely looking forward to going back!",0.9843,0.809,0.164,0.027,0.5741427432216907

2015-02-23,2.0,"I went here for the first time over the weekend, and was extremely disappointed. For someone who eats vegan/vegetarian food quite often, I was expecting better. It started with walking in the door. My friend and I stood about 2 minutes at the door waiting for a hostess to seat us. When we didn't see anyone approach us, we figured it was a seat yourself kind of thing. So that's what we did. We sat ourselves. We waited about 5 more minutes for someone to bring a menu to us. When they finally did (it ended up being the hostess), she asked us if someone sat us there. When we said no, she said in an extremely rude voice, ""Well next time wait for the hostess."" WOW! I'm a waitress/chef and I would NEVER be that rude to someone.  The environment made me so uncomfortable. The tables were really close together. Even though it is a diner, it was a little too cramped for my taste. The whole time I felt like I wanted to get out of there. My friend and I ordered the guac and chips to start with. They chips were tasty, but they guac was not fresh. It was lacking in flavor. Also, the appetizer came with salsa which was watered down. It could have been more chunky.  For an entree, I got the country fried steak and my friend got the portabello truffle melt. Both were very good. No complaints here. I also got the mint chocolate chip milkshake. Not a fan of this AT ALL! It was like all I was eating were chocolate chips! No mint flavor whatsoever.  I really wanted to like this place. Overall, it was not welcoming, lacked in customer service, and really just mediocre food. I don't think I'll be back to this location ever!",0.7469,0.82,0.098,0.081,0.5109661835748792

I had the Radical Reuben, on the theory that I love reubens, I should not eat the real thing very often, the vegan version would not contribute so much to my future demise, and it would be a good test of how they handle meaty/umami flavors in a vegan format.   WELL.  I am here to tell you, it was a GOOD sandwich.  The seitan fake corned beef was every bit as flavorful and meaty as any other reuben I've had, and was a good deal better than the dry, fatty, slimy crap I've been served by lesser diners in the past.  Served on a really nice marbled rye with sauerkraut and 1000 island (vegan).  A classic reuben done right, but it's vegan!  Whod'a thunk?  I would actually put it in the top 5 list of reubens of any kind.  It's an easy sandwich to screw up, but these guys nailed it. Had the waffle fries as a side - nice and crispy with a little spice on them for good measure.  We also all shared a cinnamon roll, which totally passed for regular while being vegan as well.  If the goal is to eat classic dishes but without the animal bits, mission accomplished in spades!

2015-01-15,4.0,"One of the best vegan diners I've been to in Chicago, the Chicago Diner has a long reputation as a fun yet casual spot. The menu is, as should be expected based on the name, centered on traditional diner fare, burgers, milkshakes, meatloaf, and the like, but with the twist that everything is either vegan or has a vegan option. For example, the nachos come with cheese which can be omitted or substituted for vegan cheese. The dishes mainly substitute meat for seitan, though the menu easily allows someone who's seitan adverse to order dishes that would already be vegetarian. In particular, I'm fond of the nachos (with or without the seitan chorizo), the black bean burger (which is, in my opinion, one of the best black bean burgers offered in the Chicago area), and the perfectly crispy sweet potato fries. The desserts are well worth ordering (if you have room after the relatively large-sized entrees.) The vegan shakes are well done, but I usually find it hard to overlook their refrigerator case that tends to contain several cake options--the cookie dough cake, for example, is fantastic.",0.99,0.778,0.199,0.022,0.45125000000000004

I do not understand why this place is overflowing with patrons!  Perhaps because it's a bit of a legend and one of the few places that really cares about vegan/vegetarian food?  A very noble cause.  However it seems the hiring of staff focuses more on their commitment to the cause rather than their commitment to customer service.   Keep in mind this is all relative.  So it's not like we waited 2 hours to get our meal or anything, it's just relative to other restaurants (and the size of this one and number of staff on hand), it was far too long of a wait (to have our orders taken, to get our food, to get our check, to pay our check, etc). Then there's the food.  I want so much to like the food.  But it's often bland and/or sloppily executed (i.e. the greasy, salty mess of a Reuben I had there once).  And when you add on the rather high price-tag it just rubs salt in the wound.  One bright note however are the Ginger Garlic Flashed Greens.  Those are addictive.  But there's far better vegan food at Native Foods Cafe (with better service; though similar price-tag).

I took two gluten free friends here for dinner this past weekend remembering this place as being great and hoping it would live up to the memory - it certainly did.  Whether your vegan, veg, GF or a meat lover they have an awesome menu (although no actual meat of course). Especially if your dietary needs are limited, their gluten free and vegan menu options are so much more plentiful and unique than most places. Your local bar and grill down the street has a few GF options sure, but not like Chicago Diner. Here you don't have to be stuck with a few average options, you get a whole delicious menu just to yourself.  GF friend #1 ordered their Straight Up Veggie sandwich with waffle fries and inhaled it in several minutes. GF friend #2 ordered their Karma Burger and ate it with such intense relish and delight. My bf and I, who are not veg or GF or anything really love this place. Its a testament to how good their food is that meat lovers don't miss the meat in their meals. BF ordered their Titanic BLT Burger with sweet potato fries. He made all sorts of suggestive sounds while consuming, obviously a happy camper. I tasted a bite and it somehow tastes just like a bacon burger without the meat, grease and fat! I ordered their Radical Reuben which was so excellent and I am so glad I ordered it. I was wondering how their kraut would be, I was a little worried but it was AWESOME. This tastes exactly like any super delicious reuben you would get at any diner or pub. I dont know how they make seitan taste like meat but they do. It's so delicious. I would actually venture to say their reuben is better than most you get at a deli or pub with a fraction of the grease and fat. Absolutely delicious and filling and oh-so wholesome and tasty.

2014-09-08,1.0,"I need to start off this review by saying that this is the very first restaurant I ate at when I moved to Chicago 7+ years ago.  I've loved eating at both locations, but I would NOT recommend using the bakery.  Especially for important events. The head baker I originally booked last year left the company (she was extremely professional - had a portfolio and listened to what we were thinking).  It took several emails to even figure out who I should be contacting about the design of the cake after she left.  I wanted to meet with the new head baker this summer before the wedding, but several emails went unanswered for months.  I was able to get ahold of the general manager via his cell phone, but was not contacted that day by another employee like he had promised.  No one really seemed too concerned with this $500 cake.   I couldn't get anyone involved with the cake to meet with me before, so of course, the cake was not what I had requested.  Yes, it was similar, but not the right cake.  I confirmed the time we wanted the cake cut via email shortly before the wedding (noticed it was wrong in an earlier email they had sent).  Time was not corrected with the employee that was there to cut the cake.  It couldn't sit out on the stand I bought for it during cocktails/dinner because ""the buttercream frosting would melt"".  I had ordered cream cheese frosting.  Not sure which it actually was - I was too upset to deal with the situation during my reception.  It also leaned to one side. I had to find the employee in the kitchen of my venue 3x to ask her to cut the cake.  She acted like she understood what I was requesting, but never started to cut it afterward.  It was my venue, not Chicago Diner, that told me I had leftover cake there after I had already left for my honeymoon. I'm not sure where the issue is - a few unprofessional employees, bad management, cake orders this big don't come through very often?  Either way, it was very disappointing.  Place your bakery order somewhere else to avoid headaches.",-0.9037,0.834,0.07,0.096,0.4425711027323931

2014-08-02,4.0,"I've had my pros and my cons with Chicago Diner, but any restaurant that serves legitimate vegan food needs some stars in my book. Personally my friends and I all love their wings, specifically the BBQ and Buffalo. It's a must with nearly every visit, especially if we have a skeptical and/or non-vegan friend who hasn't tried them yet with us. Burgers here are also very delicious, although I'm not a fan of the ""bacon"". Then again I never liked bacon when I ate meat. You can always find a good breakfast here too. While their shakes are scrumptious and GMO free, I would wish they were not soy based and perhaps instead hemp or almond based. I've also felt that in the past if I get it to-go I end up feeling jipped. I do enjoy their pierogi quesadillas, but I actually prefer letting it cool and eating it cold. If you're a Mac and cheese fan I wouldn't have high hope for theirs. While it's not bad, it's nothing compared to Soul Veg's. While I'm not a cake person, their cheesecake is pretty good and would recommend trying a slice at some point. However ordering a cake from their bakery is a nightmare. I had to call and receive calls back nearly six times over a two week time span for a graduation cake order. All I wanted was a red velvet one layer sheet cake with the frosting and blue decor on top congratulating my brother. They told me originally this was no problem. Over the next couple phone calls I was told they don't make red velvet anymore. Then I was told that they can't do sheet cakes anymore. Since I was not paying for it, I could not convince my mother to try another vegan bakery after this. From an activist stand point that sees this as an opportunity to turn a crowd of nearly 70 people onto a delicious vegan option, I saw this mess up with Chicago Diner as a truly shameful failure and would only wish that whoever is taking special orders has all the correct information for the sake of future customers for I will not be one of them returning to the bakery anytime soon.

2014-06-17,5.0,"I have been eating at the Chicago Diner since 1983. Yes, that's right, 1983. Before you were born. Before the internet. Before Mel Gibson went batshit crazy. The Chicago Diner been the best vegetarian restaurant in Chicago for over thirty years! I live in Los Angeles now, and people often ask me if I miss Chicago? No, not really I tell them. Friends and family, of course, but what I miss most is being able to eat at the Chicago Diner anytime I want. When I visit Chicago every year, I may be there for 6 or 7 days, and I will eat at the Diner at least four or five times. Either Diner is fine, the original location on Halsted street is my personal favorite because it holds so many dear memories for me, but the Logan Square location is just as wonderful. The food is amazing. I can't tell you how happy eating the Reuben sandwich makes me. Or vegan pancakes, vegan cheesecake, or anything on the menu. It's all so good. So fresh and well prepared. As a vegetarian it is so nice to know that my vegetarian food isn't being cooked on a grill next to a hamburger, or other cross contamination issues in ""mixed"" restaurants. I'm glad there are options out there, but non vegetarian restaurants and their workers don't have the same concerns and care that I expect, and that I always get at the Diner. In short, this place is fantastic! If you are a vegetarian and you have never been here, you have to go soon. If you are a meat eater, you will enjoy the experience so much. No one will try to ""turn"" you. You will just have a great meal. In full disclosure, I have to say that I worked at the Diner in 1983. I started as a dishwasher. I was a cook. I was a server. I was a manager. I spent about seven years of my life working at that amazing location at Roscoe and Halsted. For me it's like going home.  The world is a better, and tastier place because of the Chicago Diner. Now if they would only open a place in LA!",0.9982,0.753,0.225,0.021,0.5544642857142857

2014-03-10,3.0,"My 2nd attempt at a restaurant that doesn't serve tasty animals or their yummy animals byproducts.  Being that this place is TINY, there's no room to wait in the diner itself, so parties have to bide their time in a tent out back.  This tent has a bunch of cheap plastic lawn chairs, a single coffee maker, a ceramic duck, and an owl, but no heater or heating element of any kind.  So during the winter months potential diners have to just huddle together for warmth around the duck while waiting to be seated.  Amusing, but uncomfortable.  Not a fan. Anyways, the food: I sampled the Reuben, and for being a vegan entree it was pretty good and superbly messy.  My Jamaican jerk 'burger' was okay.  Probably should have ordered their spicy breaded 'chicken' sandwich instead but oh well.  The curry cauliflower soup I had to start was delicious.  Chicago Diner's lemonade was just about the most uninteresting drink ever, unlike Native Foods that accents theirs with lavender.  The chocolate mousse cake was undeniably rich and decadent. Service was good--friendly and attentive.  I got complemented on my leather jacket; if only they knew it was real cow hide and not faux leather, they'd probably cover me in red paint, bahaha.  Vegan hipsters.  I just don't get it........",0.9823,0.762,0.172,0.066,0.6268707482993198

The waffle cut fries he got were jazzed with paprika; I loved those. As far as my lunch: no going down with the ship here. I really enjoyed the Titanic BLT with the fake B and it came with a wonderful, super hot chipotle sauce on a huge multi grain bun. And my assorted greens? They were seared with garlic and ginger.

Not just the first time, like a normal shake. This one is so creamy, so chocolatey, so flavorful that every sip was amazing. My dairy-free step-mom never expected to have such a delicious milkshake. One tip: I think the best time to come is in the summer. It's a tiny restaurant, but in the summertime they have a patio in back that gives extra seating room, so less wait time! Not to mention summer is a great time to get the best vegan milkshakes ever. Also, if you aren't a fan of faux-meats, their menu is heavy with them, but there are healthier, lighter options too in the form of salads and bowls, and gluten-free options too.

2013-07-30,3.0,"The Chicago Diner is a legendary vegetarian restaurant, perhaps the oldest in Chicago, and arguably one of the best in the midwest.    Specializing mostly in vegetarian menu items similar to meat equivalents (such as their famous sandwiches), and also offering more traditional vegetarian fare, The Chicago Diner has something for practically everyone. This location on Halstead Street is the original.   There is also a newer location in Logan Square.  (Reviewed separately.) PROS:   Delicious food (especially their sandwiches) is always flavorful.   No boring vegetarian blandness here!   Great soups.   Good drinks (alcoholic, non-alcoholic, shakes) and very rich (and surprisingly vegan) deserts.   You wont miss meat eating in this place.   Service is friendly too.  Everything here is four star. CONS:   Why am I giving a four star restaurant three stars?    Unfortunately the Halstead location of the Chicago Diner is the loudest, most cramped, and generally uncomfortable restaurant I have ever visited in the Chicago area.   Unless you are lucky enough to score one of the nice wooden booths elevated above the floor, you are most likely to be seated at a tiny diner table jammed into the small restaurant space.    It gets so loud in there you can't hear yourself think, and the seating is so cramped you may not even have room to lift your fork without elbowing your neighbor.     It's more than I can handle and unfortunately I wont be eating here again.

My one star deduction is for the side dishes.  My sweet potato fries were standard fare, and my friend's mac and teese wasn't very good (in my humble, dairy loving opinion). ** - I hate that term, but I don't know what else to use, so please allow me to define it for myself.  I will try anything twice, I avoid most chain restaurants, and I love to follow the buzz about local chefs and restaurants.  How's that?",0.9468,0.825,0.135,0.04,0.5858095238095239

Ok fine, sunny side up it is.  But when my eggs came out they were cooked to oblivion.  Hard and gross.  I also noticed that there was no hollandaise sauce.  What the heck kind of Eggs Benedict did they serve me?! It was covered in mushy onions and looked very un-apealing.   The other thing I noticed was that there really isn't much of a focus on fresh vegetables.  And, we ordered some orange juice that was definitely made by Minute Made or Tropicana.  Good, $3 for a glass of lower quality orange juice than I have sitting in my fridge right now.   I know that I will be back here because I have quite a few Veg friends.  But todays service was abysmal and I left very disappointed.",0.7888,0.805,0.112,0.083,0.4257326007326008

Honestly, I wasn't a fan and thought it tasted like cardboard. However, I did also try the poutine appetizer, which was amazing, imitation bacon and all! The second time I visited I decided to avoid the fake meat route and tried the vegetable polenta. I loved it! Very fresh, yummy veggies that went very well with the polenta. To drink, I tried their bloody mary (I looooove me some bloody marys), and was thoroughly impressed. I also like the vibe of the restaurant, which takes the traditional old-school diner concept and gives it a kind of fun, hippie vibe.

I mean, I know how much better actual sausage is, so I'm not gonna compare it to the real deal, but the vegetarian 'sausage' reminded me (fondly) of the days when I would eat Ve-G-Meat and all those meat alternatives. The entire bowl just made sense, and I happily devoured it while reminiscing about vegetarian church potlucks.  My favorite part of brunch, however, was the shake. My friend and I, bloated as we were getting, opted to try the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough vegan shake, and it was SO yummy. It had soy milk, which I love, and you can definitely taste that.

The chimichurri was the only thing that had real flavor, and I ended up putting chimi and sriracha on the entire plate. Also, it was $13. It's $1 more if you want to add avocado.

After reading reviews for the last 15 years about this place, I was really looking forward to eating here on a business trip to Chicago a couple of weeks back. I was not disappointed. I had to take 2 buses to get to it, but it was worth the trek. I ate here twice in 2 days :) If you go in there expecting high-end, Food Network fou-fou dining, you WILL be disappointed. The charm of this place IS the fact that it is supposed to remind you of diners from years ago, of local dining places that you could just drop into and get a great meal. The prices were not that outrageous considering 1) its VEGAN and 2) the portions are HUGE! The first time I sat down and right away the waiter asked ""vegetarian or vegan?"" I can honestly say I have never been asked that before in a restaurant and I really appreciated it. The waiter told me what was vegan to start and what could be made vegan. It must have taken me 25 minutes to decide what to order, since I wasn't used to being able to order ANYTHING off the menu!   I decided on the wings appetizer, salisbury steak entree, cheesecake and chocolate chip milkshake. The wings were to die for. Just the right amount of sweet sticky BBQ sauce AND a vegan dilled ranch sauce. I cleaned my plate so well they probably didn't have to wash the dish!  The cheesecake was good but the milkshake was INCREDIBLE - thick, creamy, rich, chocolately... well worth the price.   The 2nd time I had the wings again, the reuben sandwich, another flavor of cheesecake and another milkshake. The reuben sandwich was INCREDIBLE! Tasted just like I remember reubens from delis. If I could place a weekly order of anything off the menu to ship out West, it would have to be the reuben and milkshake. As it was, I took a carryout order of FIVE reubens back to the hotel (oops, only had 4 with me when I got back to the hotel...wonder what happened?

2013-01-31,5.0,"When one says the word ""vegetarian"", the first things that come to my mind are the Chinese vegetarian restaurants back in my hometown in Southern California that serve vegetables cooked and served in various ways. When one says the word ""vegan"", the first thing that comes to my mind is ""nope"", so, of course, I was initially skeptical of this Boystown establishment. I could not have been more wrong to doubt in the Chicago Diner. The diner serves various dishes that are found in the stereotypical American diner like salisbury steak, chili, burgers, etc. as it should (it's a diner, what else would it serve?), except with a vegetarian/vegan twist. There's not a slice of meat or animal product to be found anywhere in the diner, and while that may sound terrible to diehard carnivores like me (on most days), it actually isn't the case at all. When I came here with my friends, I had the Salisbury Staek (deliberately misspelled because it isn't actually steak!), which consisted of a nicely sized ""staek"" made of seitan, which is probably the most convincing meat analogue I have ever had, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and potatoes. The dish blew my mind. Had I not known beforehand that the staek was not actually made of meat, I would not have been able to notice the infinitesimally small tinge of gluten aftertaste. Everything on the plate was alive and well with flavor, which I totally did not expect from a vegetarian restaurant. We also ordered the special recipe wingz, which were also made of seitan, and tasted exactly like a batch of delicious buffalo wings from Claim Jumpers, albeit shaped in odd triangular prisms.  What really revolutionized my opinions of vegetarian food, however, was the Choc Chip Cookie Dough milkshake, which I still insist could not have been vegan. How can anyone make such an amazing milkshake without any cow milk? Aside from the food, my group found the servers to be relatively amicable and helpful. I have no personal complaints about the ambiance. In fact, I found it to follow the stylistic precedent established by the food of attempting to imitate an ordinary diner, whilst adding an interesting twist with the dim lighting and music. My only complaint for the diner would be the fact that the patio at the back of the restaurant emanates a tinge of the smell of old gym socks and rubber, which is certainly not the most palatable smell, but honestly, it's not that bad. So if you're up for a culinary adventure or simply want to respect your dietary restrictions while simultaneously indulging in some incredible vegetarian food, then do yourself a favor and visit the Chicago Diner (and explore Boystown while you're at it)",0.9818,0.866,0.1,0.034,0.4566326530612244

The tostada was kind of OK - I only had a bite just to get a taste.  Same with the wrap - it was pretty meh.  Again, I only had a bite to taste.  The Seitan in the wrap was kind of flavorless.  The good thing about seitan is it absorbs whatever flavor you apply to it.  But anyway.

2012-09-19,5.0,"I have patiently waited for 3 years to review The Chicago Diner waiting for hype to simmer down or my own excitement for veganism to wear out.  The only downside to the Diner or the few omnivores I take here who are a bit underwhelmed, BUT, for vegans this is a craving fixers like no other.   I remember the first few months of being vegan, I got the idea of a Reuben in my head and was on the verge of cheating and wondering if the Diner was powerful enough to stave off that craving.  AND it was! AND I am thankful of the efforts the Chicago Diner to make this an easier than ever transition for people pondering or toying with the idea of veganism.  Of course, it's not fool proof, it's hard to convince someone who loves meat that the Diner is worthy of a 5 star review and, yes, the ""meat"" doesn't always taste like meat, duh, cause it's not.  For someone who's been off meat for months it will satisify and squash that yearning for a certain taste.   There are so many things that are good about this place, for the fact it's been meat free since 83' and wasn't a part of a fad, they are a true pioneer.  When I was doing sales, I did get a chance to speak to Mickey and he was extremely polite and respectful and willing to give me a chance.  Unlike some other snooty places that start with a ""K"".  The staff is usually pretty friendly, although, sometimes it seems a little bit forced.  There over alertness is cause for concern of a backlash for them somewhere.  But in general, I think most of the staff is more likely to be a part of veganism than other restaurant who are just selling out.  I'm glad they are expanding and I'm glad they are expanding to Logan Square, it's a sign of a true local instead of some big-shot realtor finding a ""hot spot"" with lots of ""foot traffic"".  Anyone who knows anything around here, knows that a lot of hipster, hippie, yuppie mixster of vegan-want-a-be's live near Logan Sqaure.   The dessert is sold in Whole Foods and I think that's awesome and makes it convenient.  I think the CHicago Diner is much more than desserts, though, and I definitely go there for the main dishes.  They need to make the ""fish tacos"" a main stay instead of a special!",0.9979,0.752,0.212,0.036,0.5886002886002886
2012-09-18,4.0,"I was in Chicago for a few days so I decided to head over to the The Chicago Diner for lunch.  I first dined here a few years ago. I had arrived incredibly excited to finally have the chance to eat at this super-hyped restaurant only to be disappointed to find that it was just comfort food. There isn't anything wrong with that -- I just thought they had more-gourmet offerings. Now that I can take it for what it is, this time I enjoyed it more. The small diner was pretty crowded for a Wednesday afternoon. There isn't much of a waiting area when you arrive so if you need to wait for a table, you usually do so outside the door to the main dining room. In the summer, they also offer outside seating in the back. The decor is 50's diner style with red diner tables and classic diner chairs. After hemming and hawing over the menu choices, I finally placed my order. I started with an Izze and a small bowl of the macaroni and cheeze. The last time I came here, I didn't care for the macaroni and cheeze, but everyone raves about so I gave it another try. It is basically just noodles with Daiya vegan cheese. I thought it was okay, but certainly not exceptional and nothing special. Nothing really compares with the mac 'n cheese at Soul Vegetarian's Exodus in DC, but that is for another post.  Another patron actually turned around and asked if that was the best mac 'n cheese I'd ever had and I politely told him that it wasn't and told him about Soul Veg. Come to find out that the couple also travels and eats out at vegan restaurants so we engaged in an interesting discussion. I was there by myself so I didn't mind at all. Based upon my waitress' recommendation, I ordered the Titanic BLT Burger. I half knew that this was not going to be a good idea, but I wanted to try it anyway. I also ordered some ginger garlic flashed greens on the side. This burger was humongous. The seitan patty was made with corn, peppers, and onions and it was topped with Uptons Naturals bacon, cheeze, French-fried onions, lettuce, tomato, and vegan BBQ mayo. When I finally put the top on the burger, I couldn't get it into my mouth -- it was that big. I should have taken this as a sign and not have eaten the whole thing, but I did anyway and paid for it dearly. I liked the seitan burger, but it was just way too big. It all went together well -- even the onion rings. The only thing I didn't really care for was the Uptons Naturals bacon. While it is more like bacon than the tempeh bacon I usually eat, I found it to be rubbery and hard. Next time, I'd prefer not to have the bacon. The ginger garlic kale that I had on the side was fantastic. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. As a side note, I am really glad that my waitress asked if I wanted vegan cheese when I requested cheese on my burger. I keep forgetting that they are a vegetarian restaurant and that they serve milk products. When I asked my waitress why they don't just go vegan she said that if it was up to her, they would, but the reason they aren't is because they'd lose a lot of their regular patrons. She said the breakfast is popular and they serve a lot of eggs and cheese. That is a shame. But, oh well. Chicago Diner is a great place to go for lunch, but it is easy to eat too much there. After my meal, I actually went into a full-on food coma from eating that entire burger. I actually had to take a nap and felt almost sick -- not from the food, but from eating too much. All in all, the service was great, the prices were reasonable at only $10 per entree, and the food was good comfort food. Although I didn't order dessert during this meal, they are very well-known for their desserts and if you can make room, I'd recommend you try them.

The pesto chicken sandwich was not as tasty as I had hoped. Not sure what kind of vegan cheese they used on there, but it wasn't good (and I like vegan cheese). The mac and cheese was OK; it tasted like the version of vegan Kraft macaroni 'n' cheese. Also, I had the chocolate chip cookie dough shake (vegan). It was good, but it didn't exactly taste like chocolate chip cookie dough, it tasted like chocolate chip. Where are the cookie dough chunks?

I have to say, this doesn't seem like any vegetarian place I've ever been.  Everything was delicious, it didn't seem like they were trying to make anything too healthy.  In fact, this is basically unhealthy diner food (well, there are a few healthy options).   We had the chiken (spell?) wings which were seitan I think...quite tasty and the ranch dressing - WOW.   I had the sweet potato quesedilla.  It was good, though consistency wise, it was a bit 'mushy'...but that's what you get with sweet potatoes.  Flavor was quite nice.  I could have gone with extra guac...it was a bit small on portion size.

Although I applauded Chicago Diner's effort of making vegetarian food friendly to non-vegetarians, I thought the food lost the point of being a vegetarian - eating healthy. The fact that most food here are deep fried makes it healthier to eat steak than satin.

2012-07-03,4.0,"Ahhhhh - VEGAN HEAVEN!!! The Chicago Diner takes the misconception that vegetarian/vegan food is ""bland & boring"" to rest. Their food is very flavorful & hearty. Definitely yummy veggie comfort food. The Diner has such a vast menu, which is soooo refreshing for me as a vegan, since at most restaurants, I'm lucky if I can find a handful (if even) of food options to eat. If anything, at the Chicago Diner, It's actually hard to select something to eat here - but - that's not a complaint! More like, can I get one of everything please? ;)  And, even meat eaters will not feel left out. I've dined here many times with some of my militant carnivore friends, and even they have wound up loving the food from here - including foods they may not have tried otherwise. I've been going to this restaurant since the late 80's - early 90's & have remained a devoted fan of this place ever since. I cannot express enough what a pleasure it is as a vegan to have so many great choices to choose from on their menu. Although I usually order the same thing every time - my favorite being the ""Tofu Scramble Jubilee"". I have actually overheard strangers on the street talking about how much they love that dish - and I chimed in to agree. It's *that* good. Although since I initially drafted this review - I heard they took that off the menu (* insert Ferris Bueller-esque ""Nooooooooo""... echo*  ;)  But other favorites dishes there of mine are their vegan nachos (and the portions are large enough to share with a friend) veggie chili, various soups... And for desserts - their vegan Chocolate Raspberry cake & Blueberry Muffins are to die for! Dang, I'm getting hungry just writing about it.  Also, they have great drinks. In particular, I love their blueberry margaritas, which are sweet, very fresh & refreshing. But - they are quite strong. They don't skimp out on the alcohol - so that is always a plus as you're getting your money's worth (unlike most tradional bars) But - as a heads up - these margaritas are very potent (well - from what I recall anyway, after stumbling out of there a couple times. lol :)  The actual diner itself is on the small size and tends to be rather busy, especially on the weekends, where it gets even more loud & cramped. I prefer to be seated in the booths - as it is more intimate/private - yet with more room - unlike the tables in the middle where you can wind up dining with complete strangers - or get bumped into all the time. So - I wait til a booth opens up. Or - sit in the back in their patio section - which is nice when the weather permits.  The main con however is the service in general. The wait staff tends to be inattentive. I have felt ignored waiting to be seated and the food can take awhile too. Sometimes even just to get a glass of water before you order your food. However, it's not like that all the time, and the past couple times I've been there, the service was better & friendlier.  Overall, the food is definitely worth it - delicious, filling, healthy comfort food.

Perhaps the 3 star might have said how I feel about this place (It's ok), but if you're curious as for why, and whether or not  you'd like it, read on. First off, I don't eat meat, and I dislike any form of fake meat. My dinning companion, on the other hand, eats meat. But he can't have gluten, dairy products, or eggs, so basically the two of us eating out is semi-impossible. But we've managed in the past, and Chicago Diner has gluten free, vegan and vegetarian menus that would serve both of us well.  I ordered the Bi Bim Bap, and he ordered a grilled cheese with vegan cheese (lame, I know, but his excuse was that he LOVES grilled cheese, and never really makes it himself, so now is one of the few chances). The food took a bit longer to come out, but the place was packed, so I don't blame them. When our waiter finally delivered out food, both were actually quite small in portion. Mine came with a hefty amount of vegetable, but a rather small scoop of brown rice. His sandwich was small too, but came with a side of fries. As for the taste, mine was good, but not out of this world. Truth is, I ordered this so compare it with my own version of Bi Bim Bap, and I think mine is better. In addition, they came with a ""softer"" version of gochujang (korean red pepper paste) that was a bit too sour for my taste and not spicy enough. I was expecting the real deal, or at least something that comes close to it, but the sauce that came with my dish didn't deliver. In fact, it was rather a let down. The fake meat (which is ironically the part I usually hate the most), was my favorite part of the meal, because it at least had some flavor. The grill cheese was good according to my dinning partner. Our waiter was nice, but nothing special. Place was crowded, and you'd feel like you're screaming at the people sitting at the table next to you, while in fact, you were trying to communicate with each other.  So, to sum it up, it was an ok for me. I'm pretty good with cooking vegetable and converting all meals to vegetarian. The Bi Bim Bap definitely wasn't a good choice since I can make a pretty tasty one myself. I should have gone with a sandwich or a wrap. If asked, I would say yes, give it a try. It's somewhat of a Chicago-thing (or maybe Chicago vegetarian thing). But I wouldn't rave about it the way it has been by others.",0.9939,0.796,0.149,0.055,0.5417128091546698

I appreciate places like TCD for providing vegetarian and vegan comfort foods to the veg-head and flexible meat-eating masses.  While mostly simple in design, sometimes a veggie just doesn't feel like cooking.  Or you want to introduce a friend or family member to something different.  Or you're looking for your own ideas to try at home.  I get it.  But what I don't get is faux-meat and faux-cheese parading around in an attempts to be end-all vegetarian cuisine.  Honestly, it's just meatless. Like I said, maybe I didn't order the right thing, my stomach deciding for me with the BBQ ""Bacon"" Cheeseburger with mac-n-""cheese"" for a side.  And deep-fried seitan chunks tossed in Frank's for an appetizer.  And truly, my friend's flash-garlic greens (whatever that means) were the best part of either of our meals (in my opinion).  Why?  Because it was the vegetable.  I face this same hang-up with Denver's sole meatless monopoly (Watercourse Foods and City O' City [same company/owners])--that it's mostly salty, fatty stuff that just happens to have no meat.  And terrible vegan cheese. Perhaps my long-running lacto-ovo status has turned me that far off vegan cheese (because I really only dig cashew ricotta), but the mac-n-cheese was just a little to ""off"" and plastic-y for me.  The burger was quite good; not going to lie it was exciting to be able to order a ""bacon cheeseburger"" without having to ""sub a veggie patty and no bacon"" (because usually at restaurants the bacon cheeseburger comes with some other toppings that I enjoy).  We also ordered a chocolate-chile cupcake for dessert that was divine (vegan baking always having a dear spot in my heart).  But overall TCD just lacked the ""wow"" factor I was hoping for.  And that bums me out. I will add: I am glad to have tried it.  If I visit Chicago again I might try again and go for a more vegetable-centric dish.  I also realize I'm breaking the mold with this review (just like with my stance on Denver's Watercourse) because TCD's less-than-4-star reviews are few and far between.  But I will review and post with integrity and honesty.  And that honesty stands at three stars.  And three stars only.  Lastly, if I were rating just the walnut brownie that I purchased to take back to the Mile High with me, then that would surely receive four stars.  So maybe... come for the baked goods and stay for the meatless mains?",0.9905,0.84,0.119,0.041,0.5438531746031746

It was the final deciding factor in my move to Chicago a few years back.. after visiting a few times, eating at Chicago Diner every time (sometimes multiple times) I thought.. ""I'm moving here..."" lol.  My love affair with Chicago didn't last.. but my passion for the Diner did.  On my latest trip, we stopped here 3 times. The menu had changed a bit since I left town.. but the changes were all good. I got tostadas the first night and a vegan cookies and cream shake. On our next visit I got the grilled cheese and veggies sandwich.. (there's a clever name for it.. but it's just a grilled cheese with fresh veggies on it) and mashed potatoes and gravy.. oh and the caramel torte or whatever it was called.. caramelly, crunchy pie-cake. haha.  And on our third visit... I got another sandwich and mashed potatoes... but this time I ordered the berry cheesecake.. I've had some really good vegan cheesecake in my life, so I had to try it.  The mashed potatoes and gravy just blew everything out of the water. Sweet Jesus that shit is good!  I also really liked that grilled cheese sandwich. make sure to specify that you want daiya on that sucker though.  The cheesecake was so-so. Good enough that I had to TRY not to eat the whole thing to myself.  Anyway.. I love this place. I especially like that it's become more of a vegan establishment and not just vegan friendly.

If I could eat at this place all the time, going vegan wouldn't seem that bad. The key to this place is that whatever meat lovers might miss about the lack of meat, is made up in pure flavor. I got the BLT burger and it was incredibly flavorful, very filling as well. I tried also the Rueben and it was amazing--they even colored the seitan too look like roast beef. It's in the details!

Plus, the mashed potatoes and gravy were also excellent, and this is big for me because I'm a big gravy person and I had yet  to find a vegan restaurant that made gravy that wasn't a bland mess.  Chicago Diner makes it great.  Big points scored there.  We also then tried the caramel torte recommended by our server and it also was delicious.  Thanks, dude.

The margaritas were just right (not too strong, not too weak and with a great taste). I also had a milkshake that had all of my favorites in it (cookie dough, peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream) The service is just as good as the food and everyone is really friendly and knowledgeable.  The big downside is that the place is small and i hesitate bringing large groups because it would take quite a while to get that many seats together.

The dude behind the counter must've noticed this, because he gave the leftovers from a peanut butter chocolate shake... and he made it all pretty, with chocolate syrup and chocolate chips. So nice!

I ordered the Soul Bowl, which was really nice.  And even though I was pretty full, I noticed they had a vanilla gluten-free cupcake on the menu.  So I had that, too.  It was on of the first vegan/gluten-free baked goods I ever had, and it was the first I ever had that didn't have the texture of over-cooked cornbread.  (Some of that stuff is so dry it's sinful.)  I wanted to weep for joy, but, the place is a little small, and I would have made a scene.  It was just so nice to sit there with a cup of good coffee and a fabulous vanilla cupcake and realize that, yes, there is life after celiac disease.

2012-03-25,5.0,"I love this diner! Okay, they do serve a lot of omnivorous imitation stuff, but sometimes that's what I want. I wanted to see why they were so well recommended and compare their imitation to what I know. I recommend this place to everyone, but especially to new vegans as you make the transition from animal based to plant. I also find that omnivores actually prefer more of the veggie vegan foods to the imitation meat vegan foods. If you are an omnivore and are going to order imitation meat stuff, go in with the mindset of trying something new, otherwise you may end up a bit disappointed. Some imitations are great, others are yucky. I totally understand as I'm not into everyday imitation food (but it makes a good treat sometimes). :-) Understand that you could be waiting outside a while. When we arrived we were told to wait 20-25 minutes. When we were entering, newly arrived people were being told 40-45. They have a few benches in front and a patio in back (I didn't check out the patio). When you arrive, go in and stop just inside the restaurant. Someone will take your name, the size of your party, and how long a wait you will have. I ordered the reuben with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy along with a strawberry banana shake. My husband ordered the country ""steak"" which came with pesto veggies and mashed potatoes with gravy. He also ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough shake. Break down: *Reuben: I have got to remember to order my food free of cheese. Vegan cheese, at least to me, has a very powerful flavor which can (and did) dominate the flavor. I couldn't taste the thousand island dressing. I ordered the sauerkraut on the side because I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was pretty bland. Sloppy sandwich, but I still enjoyed it. My husband really liked the bit he tried. *Mashed potatoes with gravy: I almost divorced my husband and was ready to marry any employee there who could replicate them. So. Flipping. Yummy. My husband also loved his. Highly recommended. *Strawberry banana shake: Amazing! It doesn't say strawberry banana shake on the menu, but when I saw strawberry I asked if they could make strawberry banana and she said yes. Even my husband, who usually thinks banana overpowers most foods, thought it had the right strawberry/ banana balance of flavors. Highly recommended. *Country ""steak"": It is made with seitan. My husband loved it, and I loved the piece I tried. Reminded me of mock chicken leg only better then the kind they give you in school for lunch. Highly recommended. *Pesto veggies: meh, plain even with the pesto. *Chocolate chip cookie dough shake: My husband almost divorced me and was ready to marry any employee there who could replicate it. His eyes absolutely lit up when he tried it, he said it was the best chocolate chip cookie dough shake he's ever had. I tried a bit and loved it. I usually can't find a good vegan liquid/ syrup chocolate, but they've figured it out or found it. Highly recommended.",0.9986,0.735,0.208,0.057,0.5505845467663649

With a few exceptions, the food isn't all that memorable anyway. Far too much reliance upon meat substitutes.

The meat was even slightly greasy (probably thanks to the copious amounts of cheese they put on the sandwich, mm). I swear - it was almost identical to a real meat philly cheesesteak.

2012-02-05,4.0,"Food:  4 Service:  4 Atmosphere:  3 Value:  3 My wife generally has more impressive accomplishments than me, but I have to say, in the restaurant visit department, I usually ""rule the roost,"" as my mother would say.  For some reason, however, she tended to frequent Chicago Diner while I had yet to even set foot in it.  Quite a travesty, given my vegan/vegetarian/kosher quest to find the best of the best in this fair city.  Finally, destiny intervened, and my wife and I found ourselves at this vegan wonderland with another couple who also kept kosher on a chilly Tuesday night.  After waiting for 10 minutes in the cold, and 10 more minutes in the semi-cold entry way, we were seated. It was a tough choice between The Radical Reuben (corned beef seitan, grilled onions, peppers, sauerkraut, cheese, thousand island on marble rye) and the Philly Steak (roast beef seitan, sauteed peppers and unions, cheese on toasted hoagie), but after a last minute audible, I listened to my gut and went with the Reuben.  Would I like to add their famous chili for an extra dollar?  Hmmm...  Are those Geico commercials where the guy asks rhetorical questions and the answers are obviously yes funny and creative? The chili came out first and was quite the crowd-pleaser.  Well, it was really just a Neil G.-pleaser because I refused to share it with my compatriots.  Not only was there everything you would expect to find in a good veggie chili--black beans, corn, tomatoes, onions, peppers, there were also huge chunks of beefy seitan included in almost every bite.  The consistency was spot-on, and I really appreciated the heat level, as too many places these days are scared of serving things too spicy.  I say the hotter the better (that goes for most things in life, too). The Reuben took me back to the olden days of non-kosher eating.  Just about every component was perfect.  The seitan was spicy and plentiful.  The peppers and onions added depth, and the sauerkraut added texture and bite.  The gooey cheese helped hold everything together, and the real kicker was the thousand island dressing.  It had just the right amount of kick and rather than overpower the sandwich, it helped accentuate all of its intricate flavors.  My only disappointment was the bread, which was just a little dry.   Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who is adventurous.  If you're usually a carnivore but willing to branch out a little, I would try this place first, as opposed to Mana Food Bar (see my review) or Blind Faith (see my review).  If you're a vegan or vegetarian, it's a no brainer as long as you don't mind paying $12 for a good sandwich.  If you're a wannabe food blogger whose wife has been here more times than you, I definitely recommend going just to try to even the score.    [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]",0.9983,0.779,0.182,0.039,0.5907977558839628

2011-12-20,4.0,"You may not believe it now, fellow plant eaters, but there was a time, lo these many years ago, when a vegetarian had only two choices for a meal - the Chicago Diner, and a grilled cheese sandwich somewhere else. I ate at the Diner many, many times, but with the greater variety of choices in the last several years, my food dollar went elsewhere. Monday's dinner at The Chicago Diner showed that little has changed over the intervening years. Oh sure, they serve alcohol now, and there is no bulletin board or pile of leftie printed publications in the entry, but the place looks just the same. We arrived at 6pm, when the place was only about half full. By the time we left around 7:30pm, there were people waiting on the sidewalk to get in. This is still a small restaurant. I believe there is an outdoor seating area, but that doesn't appeal much in December. I ordered a Portugese red wine and my friend had a pinot noir. Both were vegan and chemical free, each glass cost $7.00, and each was delicious. There was one other red wine we could have tried, a couple of whites, several beers, and a few mixed drinks. If we had gone through that list, I would be in no shape to write this review today. My friend ordered the Bi Bam Bop entree, featuring a lot of Asian-style vegetables and seitan. I tried the Chipotle firehouse wrap, and added a small cup of guacamole for $2.00. We both really enjoyed our entrees. Hardly one speck of food was left. These were filling enough that we did not want dessert.  Service was professional and friendly. That's an improvement on the Olden Days, when the staff were nice vegans who didn't understand much about getting food and drinks out in a timely manner. Parking is mostly street. One thing I remembered, driving over there, is that the Diner used to have some free off-street parking places, and that turned out to still be true. Just north of the diner building, there are diagonal spaces where you can park after 6:00pm weekdays. I don't remember what the rules for the weekend are. You can call the restaurant to find out. All in all, a good experience.

2011-11-29,4.0,"Gori S. was about to rollerskate her way from Elmhurst if necessary to get to Chicago Diner on our trip, yet I'm the one who went twice (nyah nyah Gori). Chicago Diner is a crowded little place that does have a diner feel, but if you walk through the kitchen, you can also be seated at an enclosed, heated outdoor patio, which is painted a cheerful shade of yellow.  I ate in both the front and back, and I preferred the patio: it's quieter and has more space, and even though we weren't in the main restaurant, I didn't feel like our server forgot about us (service was very good in both parts of the restaurant). First visit, I got lunch: the Buddha's Karma Burger with fries.  The burger patty itself was unusual and good, and I liked the Karma Realignment Sauce, although I wasn't crazy over it.  I'm also unsure if my karma was better aligned after eating it, but my flight on Sunday didn't crash, so it couldn't have gotten worse.  The sweet potato fries were good.  It was chilly out and I ordered a hot cocoa, which was one of the best soy cocoas I've ever had, and it even had whipped cream! Second visit, I was in the mood for breakfast and got the French toast combo...with a cookie dough milkshake on the side.  You know, a breakfast beverage.  This was Gori's insistence, and good call, ref: whatta milkshake!  I could have had that alone for breakfast; my only suggestion would be to blend it less so it's a bit thicker, but it was delicious.  The combo was too big for me.  The French toast was interesting, because it didn't have the regular egg coating, but was still in the French toast vein and was nice and cinnamonny.  I was disappointed with both the tofu scramble (lacked flavor) and the hash browns (same, plus should have been crispier).  I didn't try the sausage patty. Was it worth Gori's foaming at the mouth?  Personally, no; I've eaten at vegan restaurants I liked better (including Native Foods, which can also be found in Chicago).  I'd normally award three stars, but due to the milkshake and good service, I'm bumping it to four.",0.997,0.777,0.188,0.034,0.5046404002501563

The perfect rectangles of veggie bacon look a bit odd but did taste something like bacon.  If it were the burger alone I'd probably have given this 3/5.

Upon reflection I wish we had gotten breakfast instead of sandwiches but everything was tasty so . . . Had Vegan Reuben.  Good sandwich and the ""Corned Beef"" had good flavor and texture.  I would have preferred the sandwich to be grilled on a flattop which would have added some texture and kept the sandwich from quickly turning to mush.  It still worked though. My wife got the Steak sandwich.  Added mushrooms which really helped kick up the beefy flavor. For sides, the flash ""seared"" kale was delicious and gingery if not a little undercooked and tepid.  Also the sweet potato fries were definitely crispy but for me indistiguishable from most other sweet potato fries that come out fo the freezer and into the fryer.  I personally don't get all the fuss. The staff was wonderful and friendly.  The other patrons were an eclectic bunch though most tables when we were in there looked like they had just taken their lunch break from an Occupy Wall Street protest.  Also quite an interesting neighborhood as the many shopping options include Gaymart and other shops for sex toys and smoking utensils.

The food here is fantastic.  Between my various guests and I we have ordered quite a range of things on the menu and there hasn't been one miss.  Among my favorites are the Seitan Wings, the Nachos (pretty sure the sauce was vegan although I got dairy sour cream, but it was still gooey and fantastic), the radical reuben, the burgers...I could go on and on and am sure I have left some of my favorites out of the mix. What I love about the food is that it is well executed and perfectly craveable.  I'm not a vegetarian, but an open-minded omni and find this place to be even better than the real deal.  What I love about it is it easily satisfies vegetarians, vegans and even omnis so it's a great place to go with a mixed crowd.  The menu is a bit heavy on the fake meats (though I think they do them so well, among the best in chicago), but even if this isn't your thing there are many fake meat free options. The restaurant does have parking but keep in mind that like the dining room itself, it fills up quickly.  In fact, even at 8:30 on a Wednesday it isn't unusual to find a crowd waiting outside so factor that into your time.  However, it's generally worth the wait and keep in mind the takeout is also fantastic and prompt.  My food generally takes between 20-30 minutes which seems standard and fair.",0.9968,0.738,0.237,0.025,0.5945781342840166

On to the appetizers.  Had the buffalo wings, which were chewy and delicious. Moving on to desserts, had the pineapple cake and the cookies and cream cake, respectively.  I have to say that after having such amazing food, the desserts, although tasty, were not on par with the rest of the meal.  Both items, ordered on separate days, were somewhat dry and did not have the moistness I expected from a good vegan dessert. Finally, the coffee was excellent.  On both of my visits, I had the hazelnut syrup infused coffee with vegan whipped cream. Really excellent! In summary, a wonderful five star experience, despite  the somewhat disappointing desserts.  My only regret is that I live over 3,000 miles away from Chicago, and there is really nothing like it around LA, apart from Veggie Grill.

Out of the dozens of places I miss terribly, Chicago Diner is on the top of my list for lunch when I'm back in town. It's SO nice to have vegetarian food that does not focus too heavily on eggs & cheese, and a place that features vegan food with consistently excellent quality. The service ranges from great to semi-terrible, but the restaurant still merits max stars because the food is always spot on, fairly priced, and pretty much everything can be made vegan.

It's seriously not to be missed, if you like that kind of thing, I'd make a trip just for that sammitch. The atmosphere is kitsch diner cutey without being overly goofball or pretentious, casual but not so much that it seems to be  catering to drunks, people afraid of food, trendy college dorks, or newly-veg hipster pests. They've been doing a brisk business in this location for fricking ever, because they do one basic thing, veg-based diner food, but do it just right.

He said the flavor was great but was perplexed that two pieces of French toast amounted to one slice of bread cut in half. Although they have gluten free bread there is no gf French toast option and no offer to accommodate by request.  Every vegan restaurant in Toronto and many other major cites makes a gf pancake, they do not- which I find strange since they have gone to the effort of offering a separate gluten free menu.  They were out of several dishes/ingredients including quinoa and corn cakes which most of the gf options were based on if one avoids soy, this was at noon on a Saturday.  I ordered the only option left, a grilled cheese on gf bread with daiya cheese, deliciously done but with totally superfluous lettuce, tomato, cucumber added, a chewed up pickle on the side and a tiny portion of the side order of kale salad which was oily kale with shredded carrot, no other dressing not even salt.  Overall it didn't feel like much effort is made here, with no almond or rice milk available for coffee as well, it felt like I was getting as many 'no""s' as a vegan does in any other resto.   Service was cavalier as well.",0.6706,0.816,0.093,0.091,0.4376530612244898

Everything was really good except the mac and cheese that came with the sandwich didn't really do it for me. Often when I've been there I've had these hipster male servers that just seem really annoyed all the time. Last night though we had this amazing server that seemed to be made out of lesbian pixie dynamite. I'm not sure if she's actually a lesbian but there are some kind of superpowers going on inside that girl and in a perfect world, she'd be cloned so she could be everybody's server at the Chicago Diner.

He may have licked the little container clean, and definitely didn't balk at the seitan sausage. We both agreed that the herb flaked biscuit was superb. Standard breakfast fare is also abound- the portions are large but not too large, if you get my meaning. Coffee comes in huge cups and they're very generous with refills, a necessity for an establishment with ""diner"" in the title. ""Seitan bacon"" (although it's more fun to use the incorrect spelling) tastes nothing like bacon and everything like smoked tofu, just how I like my fake meats. We also tried the vegan cinnamon roll-- OmniBoyfriend said ""this tastes nothing like vegan food."" I'm pretty sure that means: tasty.

Allow me to explain why: After posting my original review, (good food with decent service most of the time with some issues) I got a Yelp email from one of the servers that  was upset and felt that I insulted their service and said ""this was the strongest team they'd ever had"", also stating there was no way any server would waist time flirting with anyone (see my first review) due to most people's couple relationship status or homosexual orientation. ??????????????????????????????????????????????? But it's cool. I know what my experiences were. I simply let the server know that I meant well and that I loved the place. She thanked me for speaking with her and hoped my service was better next time. NOT! After arriving early and waiting for them to open, my boyfriend and I happily sat down and were ready to order brunch.  The first server that handed us our menus didn't even say as much as 'hello' to us. After another server came by, I ordered the Steak and Eggs (scrambled tofu for me!) and my boyfriend ordered some veggie bacon, potatoes, dairy eggs, and biscuits and gravy off the build a brunch menu. We then proceeded to wait for our food...and wait...and wait... It took us 30 minutes to get our food and we were one of the first four tables to order. Waiting mind you, without so much as a ""we're having a few issues in the kitchen, but your food will be out shortly"" or anything from ANYONE. I've never had to wait that long for an order EVER. FINALLY when I did get my food it was ICE COLD!!! I had to send it back!!! My bf only got half of his order, and we had to request the other half.  I was apologized to for everything, but how does that happen???  I apologized to my bf for bringing him here right before he had to be at work --- I expected the service and food to be much better and much faster. It makes me very sad and actually hurts my feelings to update my review for the Chicago Diner in this manner, especially as a long time customer of three years, but this last time was just absolutely horrid! I expected so much more from here. I don't think I will be back for a while. Maybe things will be better by the time I decide its safe to return. :(  Until then, there are other vegan-friendly establishments with better service. *cry*",0.906,0.835,0.103,0.063,0.4894682539682539

Good food, nice staff and friendly atmosphere. I'll definitely be back every time I visit Chicago.  The sweet potato fries were really good, the lentil cake appetizers were flavorful and zesty, and the mixed vegetables side dish was anything but ordinary. We tried the meatloaf and black bean burger; they were both hearty and tasty.  I was slightly disappointed to find that they didn't offer almond milk as an alternative to soy milk for my coffee. I know that would be totally unreasonable in most places, but in a serious vegan joint, it should be considered.  The menu is a great collection of simple comfort food, but it could be a little more creative. Nonetheless, this restaurant deserves 4.5 stars for being an excellent vegan oasis. I just couldn't go all the way to 5 stars without a little more flair in the selection.  I wish this place could be duplicated and could be found in every major city around the country.

2011-03-31,4.0,"I think Chicago Diner gets a lot of 4- and 5-star reviews because people are just excited that it's specifically vegan/vegetarian. I don't feel like the food is quite as exciting as it used to be. If you're really into comfort food and fake meat (meatloaf, country fried chicken, reubens, etc.), and/or you don't really cook at home, then you'll probably love the food. A note for vegans: everything on the menu can be ordered vegan, with soy dairy (or, for cheese lovers, with the dairy version). I'm not wild about all of that comfort food stuff. You couldn't pay me to eat fake meatloaf; I've never missed the original. So I would give the current menu about 2.5 - 3 stars. The reason I'm giving the place 4 stars is the AMAZING staff. I've been here at least ten times and have never encountered a server or host who was anything less than spectacular. I can't imagine how they find so many wonderfully friendly, attentive people. The menu highlights for me are definitely the milkshakes (the vegan shakes are awesome, even if you're used to dairy) and the wings. We once went twice in one day for wings and shakes; they're that good. There are other items on the menu that are yummy, like sweet potato fries, but I make those at home, so I don't really feel like they're worth going out for. There's a lot I miss about the Chicago Diner of a couple years ago. They had amazing vegetarian pulled pork tacos last year, and those are gone now. They used to have a wider variety of dishes that didn't involve fake meat, but centered around items like polenta, greens, beans...  inventive combinations with amazing flavor. And you could pick anything on the menu, and it would be guaranteed amazing... Not so much anymore. The dishes that aren't centered around fake meat seem to fall flat or have sort of one-dimensional flavors.  So Chicago Diner is no longer at the top of my list for an all-around delicious dinner. It is definitely still on my list for a junk food (wings and shakes) binge. I don't want to spoil it for anyone else, though. If you're a vegan who has been craving gyros, reubens, etc., you'll love it.",0.9872,0.779,0.153,0.068,0.5933333333333333

The Chicago Diner: home of the best $@#%$#'n sandwich I have ever eaten in my LIFE. This is not a comment I make lightly or glibly--this is a savory, perfect $@#%$#'n testament to what being vegetarian is to me and what it can be for so many others, so lets dive in , shall we? I travel quite a bit (formerly for work, now for pleasure) and Chicago is one of the culinary love letters I keep with me and visit whenever I can. That being said, I had never made it over to The Chicago Diner and resolved myself to making the trek and getting the sandwich that brought people to a dreamy-eyed state when I told them I was going. I mean, WTF is the big deal--I've been to a country load of great restaurants and ate damn well in all of them.  Besides, if it wasn't that great I could always get something else or go to another spot--they're not the boss of me! ...well, Niambi reporting to TCD for work sir, because after the first $@#%$#'n bite (and my server as my witness) I softly cursed and began to chew slowly in  wonderment--how.the.hell… .that?!  A REUBEN. I haven't had a Reuben (or a semblance of) since I was like 13 devouring Johnny pastrami and deep-fried everything like it was going out of style (lil' whippersnapper Niambi was gross, what can I say) The perfectly marinated seitan, Reuben Sauce, Sauerkraut, vegan cheese, rye bread.................................................................I was jolted from my vegetative (see what i did there) state by my server who smiled knowingly at me saying, ""First time getting the Reuben,huh? Good wasn't it?"" As the tear developed in my right eye all I could do was slowly nod then shake my head in confusion at what I was eating. I eventually left after licking my plate and getting dessert (can't even remember what, blame the radical one), determined to make it back as soon as I could to Chicago--the place that proves vegetarian cooking is limitless.",0.9759,0.831,0.113,0.055,0.4109537493158183

We could not be happier with our decision.  The atmosphere was inviting, and the service was excellent - prompt, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing. We had no wait at 6:30p on a Thursday evening, but by the time we left a little over an hour later, there was a small crowd huddled outside. The timing of each part of the meal was perfect - we never had to scramble to make room on the table, nor did we have to wait more than a couple of minutes between courses. It's a tiny place, but it was abundantly staffed, and they all worked together to make it an excellent experience. That said, I would have tolerated abysmal service  just to have more of the food! We started with the buffalo ""wings,"" which were absolutely amazing (also, I don't remember ranch ever tasting so nomnom before I went veg*n!). I had the pumpkin raviolis, The Boy had the bacon (vegan-)cheddar burger, and we finished it off with the chocolate mousse cake.

I've been here a good number of times, and typically I get the Reuben or the Dagwood sandwich, although I've also had the Half-Pipe and the Titanic Burger. I'm also a big fan of the buffalo wings, and the chocolate peanut butter shake is to die for (the shakes cost nearly double what you might expect a typical shake to cost, but are well worth it, especially if you can't/don't eat dairy). As for sides, I usually get the sweet potato fries, the mac and cheeze, or the kale - very different options, but each delightful. I've also been for brunch once: what I remember most was the biscuit and gravy, which was delicious. As far as I can tell, it's less busy during the week than it is on weekends (natch), and you probably wouldn't want to come with a large group regardless (although I've never eaten on their patio, so it may be a bit more spacious). The food's a little on the pricey side - I don't think I've seen an entree for under $7.99 - but well worth it, and comes up faster than you may expect, even when it's busy. Why not a perfect 5/5? The food's a little inconsistent. Sometimes the mac and cheeze is dynamite, sometimes it's bland. Sometimes the buffalo wings are cooked to perfection, sometimes they're a little on the tough/dry side. I've never had a problem with the Reuben or Dagwood, but the crispy onion straws on the Titanic Burger were cold when I ordered it.

I got the ""chicken"" c-zar sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. The first bite of my sandwich was pretty good. The sauce was a little on the salty side. I assume that's because the ""chicken"" patty didn't have much flavor. Halfway through my sandwich, I didn't enjoy the taste as much. The salty c-zar sauce was getting to be too much, and the gravy from the mashed potatoes was getting to me too. I ended up eating about three spoonfuls of the mashed potatoes and half my sandwich, and I usually finish my meals.

Turns out, not so much.  The ""wait"" staff was actually very chill.  Very very chill.  Skinny jeans/earings/a lotta black/stoned look etc. Think 1990s punk. They have a look like they're really crushed by some injustice.  Like maybe some fascist corporation raised prices on mug root beer 2 liter bottles for no fcking reason except to rape people.

Completing the first 3 weeks of my vegan-ism i was having some serious cravings... eggs, cheese, milk, cheese, burgers, cheese, CHEESE. We arrived around 6:30 on Saturday so i knew there was going to be a wait. The hostess was super nice and cute. Told us about 45 minutes and directed us to the heated back waiting area. Luckily, there were some menus out so we were able to look over it before actually getting seated. They bring you to your table through the back door, which goes right through the kitchen. At first i thought it was weird, but after thinking about it, i liked that i was able to see the kitchen. The kitchen (and the cooks!) were clean and i was pleasantly surprised. :) When we were seated we got primo seating... table along the wall, right by the front window. We decided that we were going to split everything we ordered, so we could try as many things as possible. We ordered the ""cheeze"" sticks with homemade marinara and they were delicious! They looked like a shorter version of fried asparagus. The marinara was fantastic!!!!!  Hugo ordered the ""Barbecue Bacon Burger"" with sweet potato fries and i ordered the ""fried chicken"" sandwich with macaroni and cheeze. I was fully prepared for the sodium filled veggie burger taste but i was pleasantly surprised! The barbecue sauce was thinner than normal sauce, but it was also sweeter. Im not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, so i wasnt to keen on the fries, but Hugo loved them. THE MAC AND CHEEZE WAS SO GOOD.  I tried making homemade vegan mac and cheeze but it was terrible, so i was still craving it from a week earlier. It was so good, i retracted our agreement to share everything because i could not even think about sharing it..  We got the peanut butter cake for desert and it was decent. The cake was semi dry, but the caramel and peanut butter was soft and gooey.  Just a tip- before i came here, i bought a choc chip cookie made by the diner at Whole Foods and it was so good i couldn't believe it! They sell their cookies in packs of 12 (I think) at the diner, and they are much cheaper than at whole foods (and probably fresher!). I am a huge fan.

Order the Reuben or the Dagwood. Don't get a side of mashed potatoes, it's one ice cream scoop of weak potato in a cup. Get sweet potato fries or the kale salad. 2. Don't order a milkshake with your meal, or you will drink it before your food arrives and then you will have a stomachache. Get it for dessert. 3. Don't order coffee if you don't really, really need coffee. It's miraculously bad for a place that should have better stuff. 4. Make EXTRA sure you don't order anything off the specials menu, no matter how good it looks like it might be. It will be under-seasoned and probably cold. 5. Did you order the Reuben or Dagwood? Seriously. Trust me. They are good, made even more delicious by the pitiful state of everything else. To make things even simpler: order the Dagwood and kale salad, split a peanut butter cookie milkshake with your dining companion, make it out alive.

2010-12-31,4.0,"I returned to the Chicago diner when I was craving smoked-tasting fake meat. The food was muuuuch better this time. I ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. AMAZING. It really hit the spot. My husband ordered the philly cheese steak, which was also good, but not as good as my burger. Mmm I am drooling just thinking about it. HOWEVER. The woman who seemed to be the hostess/manager was extremely rude. First she seated us at a table by the door... which I thought was fine because, even though it was cold outside, there are two doors to the outside so there isn't a breeze when people come in. But my dining partners didn't want to sit by the door, so that's fine. When we asked to be moved to, she told us there weren't any other tables opening up. Fine. She then rudely told us once we were ""seated"" we couldn't move. Which I guess means once we got water and stuff we couldn't move to a different table? Ok, whatever, if that's their policy. A booth opened up a minute later, so we were able to move anyway. However, she struck again at the end of the meal, when we were chatting for about 10 minutes after we got our bill. She came over and actually asked us to leave! I mean, really? It's not like we were sitting there for hours reading books. This is a restaurant, not a fast food place. Yes, I understand there is a wait on a Friday night... and we waited for our table as well. But come on... it's just plain rude to ask a customer to leave their table. I waitressed for 10 years through high school and college, and although it's annoying to have your table occupied when there are customers waiting to be seated, you DEAL WITH IT. I have never asked a customer to get up. Just rude. Sure fire way to get someone to never return. By the way, our actual waiter was really nice... but I wonder if he put bitchy hostess up to this so we wouldn't cheap out on his tip.

I have been promised by many, that although a non-vegan I would still enjoy the fare. I can't tell you how false this statement is. The only redeeming quality of CD was their chocolate shake, but that could have simply been attributed to my unhealthy obsession with anything that resembles ice-cream, and well-it was chocolate. My friend and I split a BBQ bacon burger, sweet potato quesadillas, and sweet potato fries. I will say, the burger had amazing flavor, but I would much prefer a burger that wasn't terribly dry. The quesadillas were not impressive, and the sweet potato fries were good, but nothing I would rave about.  Beyond the meh food, the service was terrible. Server was MIA for most of the night. We sat there for the bill for a good 20-30 mins, and then he gave us hell because we wanted to split a shake. If I could allow myself to give a poor tip-I would have.

I didn't have a lot of time on my hands, but I decided to park with my hazards on and run in to check out.  Inside I was greeted with vintage ads and neon lights, what I understood to be the atmosphere that owners Mickey Hornick and partner ""Chef Jo"" Kaucher were going for. They were quoted as saying they wanted to make the restaurant as ""American as mini malls"" Instead of french fries, they serve home fries. They offer vegan milkshakes and ""not dogs"" for kids.  Most importantly...they have dessert.  When I walked up to the busy counter, I looked behind the glassful of cakes and promptly took the suggestion of the woman in front of me to try a piece of their carrot cake ($5.95). I waited about 5 minutes, grabbed my piece, and walked out. When I got in my car, I realized I had minutes to spare before I was to meet the Polish Party Girl. I opened the container and dug in. I was absolutely shocked at what the first bite brought..so I piled more into my mouth. I sat in my car and devoured that monstrous piece of carrot cake in less than 10 minutes, and it was by far the best carrot cake I have had in my life. This had to be a trick. Where was the butter, egg whites, and cream cheese??  No sir. This was vegan cream cheese frosting that was richer than any regular frosting I've ever tasted. These were all natural ingredients and cane sugar. And this was delicious.

As a vegetarian, I acknowledge that I may be a bit biased, but this seriously is a place that people of all diets can enjoy. The worst mistake you can make is to think that the only thing you'll find on the menu is steamed kelp or gluten-free wheat germ tacos with watercrest mole.  The menu fluctuates according to the season, so depending on how often you go, you may never see the same menu twice. And it's not much different from any run-of-the-mill diner menu, except for the taste,and  that you can feed yourself for under ten dollars. I'd say the best meal I've had there was a lentil based meatloaf which could effortlessly beat the hell out of your grandmother's recipe that she learned from the Dione Lucas Cooking Show. Basically, their dishes that are meant to resemble meat actually do taste like the real thing.  Since Chicago Diner makes an effort to go organic on just about everything on the menu, this includes the coffee. I can't think of any other place that serves a more flavorful cup of coffee. They could build an addition to start a coffee bar and run Starbucks right out of Lakeview. It's not some freeze dried Taster's Choice. It's some serious gourmet shit. Feel free to tell your server that in your best Samuel L. Jackson voice. The staff seems very friendly and might get a good chuckle out of it.",0.9192,0.778,0.126,0.095,0.5151927437641723

I came here the other night with my 5 year old niece, brother, and my fiance.  We were told it was a 25 minute wait and my guests agreed to stick it out.  We ended up waiting twice as long as told and outside in the cold and rain no less.  To make matters worse, we were put out back on the patio to eat where the heat was pretty much nonexistent.  Not good when it's in the 40's.  We had to keep our gloves, coats and hats on from start to finish.  It seemed there was only one server that night, so it took forever for our order to be taken.  When we finally got our food, my fiance's order was wrong.  And because it was so cold in their little gazebo deal on the patio, our food was cold within minutes of arrival. This place is overpriced, the food's meh compared to the veggie cuisine I've been making at home, you don't get much either (btw, if your menu says ""gyros"", you're implying there will be at least two gyros... not one), and the wait is absurd. Oh, and I would also like to add that a reuben should NOT have green bell peppers on it.  I'd ordered the reuben several times over the past year and enjoyed it.  The new green pepper addition left me having a difficult time choking the sandwich down even after removing the peppers from the sandwich because their flavor was thoroughly cooked into the thing.  C.D. is quickly becoming that weird mother that wants to add some flair to a classic entre that can't be perfected on.",0.2464,0.835,0.08,0.085,0.49470344470344485

I think the Chicago Diner is definitely a contender with it's Vegan exclusive menu choices.  My first time here, I was very skeptical because I'd never been to a vegan restaurant before but one bite of the 'pot stickers' with their accompanying tangy soy sauce and I was hooked!  I had three different entrees and be warned that EVERYTHING tastes different but in a creative way.   The service is also excellent, every server is jovial and polite and don't even get me started on the Shakes...  I would have NEVER thought a vegan shake would taste better than one from Oberwise but I was way wrong and best of all, I don't spend an hour with stomach cramps after I have one of Chicago diner's shakes. My only quibble is the location,  where the limited parking is off an alley way where your car might get dinged.  Also, If you're having dinner, get here before 5pm, because the dining space is small and get's cramped when busy.   I'm looking forward to trying their brunch at some point, I've heard their breakfast food is good!",0.9712,0.797,0.146,0.056,0.5458994708994709

(Seriously, making a good veggie burger isn't that tough!). This year, my hubby & I (he's a meat eater) found The Chicago Diner by a fluke and we loved it so much we went 3 times during our trip.  It's located in a nice, clean neighborhood. Great service and it's obvious that both the servers & cooks really care about the food.  The food is fantastic & made of high-quality, fresh ingredients. We haven't had one bad thing here. The prices are appropriate for the large portions. Even the beer selection & desserts are great.  I'm vegetarian, not vegan, but I got the vegan cheese and was shocked.  Most soy cheese I've tried is fair but this cheese is truely vegan-and awesome (and I'm a huge cheese lover).  The vegan shakes are good and the peanut butter puck rocks. They use filtered, chilled water (no ice).  I really wish I lived in the area as I would definitely frequent this place. I will be coming in every time I visit Chicago (at least once). My hubby even said that it's some of the best food he's ever had in Chicago and he's eaten some fairly good meat dishes.

But back to the tacos, they had a very generous amount of ""pork"", good mix of lettuce and shredded carrots, and the vegan sour-cream was to die-for. A think slice of avocado in each taco, completed this perfect entree.  I also had a couple bites of my husband's Radical Rueben, which was way better than any real Rueben I've had in the past. It came with the most delicious sweet potato fries, which were crunchy enough, yet still moist and soft on the inside.  We finished with a slice of Strawberry-Coconut pie and vegan whipped cream.

The crust was just hard enough without being touch and crumbled perfectly in my mouth.  The atmosphere, the food, the service are of top quality and I will come back again and again.

The whole thing was pretty yummy especially with a side of sweet potato fries. My friend seemed to enjoy her ""meat"" ball sub as well.   As a non-vegetarian, I suppose I am not really allowed to comment, but I suppose I would have liked to see more dishes incorporating beans and un-disguised tofu as opposed to faux meats.

2010-08-15,4.0,"Nice restaurant for the area.I have been trying to get to this restaurant since i was in Los Angeles.I had been looking at the reviews for the best vegetarian places to eat in Chicago for about a few weeks before i came home to visit my mom in Waukegan,Illinois.  After several failed attempts to get here while in the city a few times ,i figured i should make a special trip to get there.It's not like me to make a 40 mile run for food, but i figured this place was special.All of the reviews spoke kindly of this place..(most anyway).  Well i finally arrived here today after taking the Metra from the suburbs and then i took the C.T.A. #151(Chicago's city buses),and i was on that about an hour and a half due to all of the traffic rerouting from the Air and Water Show at the beach.  I got off on Halsted and something, i cant remember and walked down the street which was about 3 blocks.On the way there i saw a number of gay looking people and an actual couple that were gay.Two men holding hands..It finally dawned on me that the rainbow flags that i had been looking at posted everywhere meant that i was in a gay and Lesbian area of Chicago that i hadn't known anything about.  After acknowledging this i felt better because i knew i would be in a tolerable area where discrimination wouldn't be something that would be celebrated but rather frowned upon.  I walked up to the restaurant and my first impression from around the place was that it probably was going to be filled with a bunch of gay guys and extra crowded(gay guys were outside hanging out).I got in and found out i was wrong from the start.They had every seat filled and it was men and women in there.  I was thinking that i was going to have to get my order to go when the hostess told me their was seating in the back patio area.  I said cool and decided to stay.The back patio area is accessible by going through a portion of the kitchen ,and i felt weird going through it since it didn't look that nice..not so much dirty, just old,small and crowded with a few people in it .It would make you think why would they even bring people this way?,this isn't what you want to see before you sit down and eat!  I sat down and I had two wait staff people.I noticed that it was only arm room only up in there.I was given a glass of water that had cucumber slices in it.This changed the taste of the water dramatically, but no so much for the worst ,just not as delicious as maybe filtered water with a twist of lemon or lime in it.  I decided to order the sandwich combo because i figured that would be easy for me.I got the Gyro with a side of sweet potato fries.Ill just say that they tried their best..I don't think a non-vegetarian would be pleased completly.Since I'm a vegetarian I'll give it 4 stars.This meal would have been given a2 or a 3 by someone that maybe was expecting the comparison to be a little bit closer in taste to a real Gyro.The pita fries weren't the best, but they has a sweet taste and i think they were homemade.  I got a second entree to take home with me and i purchased the Reuben sandwich with a side order of mac and  cheese.my  personal opinions have to be hidden since i think i might not like Reuben sandwiches to begin with.I don't want to hinder anyone from the experience of a great tasting sandwich.  I had them add Daiya cheese and the other stuff that comes with it didn't appeal to my tastebuds..This is not to say that i wont finish my sandwich.I'm just saying i wouldn't be ordering this again.The mac and cheese in the ""to go"" tray was just a dollop and not really that much.I was upset since vegan Mac and cheese is tasty..I enjoyed the little of it that i could.  That's all for now but i want everyone to know that to me this place is a 4 star but for others i could fairly say that today's entrees would have to be a 3..  But it's really funny the loyalty us Vegetarians have to our restaurants.Even though i wasn't the happiest with todays selection, i refuse to give this place a bad review..I see potential, and i wont give a bad review to an establishment that puts together a good presentation at least.  I know i can be weird like that with my reviews.Maybe I'm just an ass-kisser in denial, or a crowd follower that doesn't want to give this place a bad review..Ill let you know next year when i come here again and try a third entree...They do say three times a charm.I wont drop any stars until i know about the third meal..if it's good then ill boost them up a star, if their bad then ill drop them down one!  I'm so confused right now, maybe i should have just given them 3 stars and called it a  night.im  tired already!",-0.4623,0.811,0.092,0.097,0.5387977262977263

2010-08-09,5.0,"Hands down my favorite Chicago restaurant. My home town was not veggie friendly and only famously known for it's BBQ, which I am unable/unwilling to eat. So to move to Chicago and have a restaurant where I can eat just about everything on the menu was very exciting for me. Now after 5 years of Chicago I still find myself extremely drawn to the Diner even after discovering so many other veggie restaurants. I had my birthday here two years ago on a Friday night. They were very accommodating with my sizable group (hardly any wait!) and when I couldn't decide between two different cakes they let me have both! And then the waiter put some vegan cookies in my leftovers bag! The service is generally flawless. Sometimes I miss the previous chef, but the new menu isn't so bad either. Still pretty great, actually. I miss the pan seared tofu, but am enjoying the new green line foods and sandwiches.

2010-08-05,1.0,"If you're a vegetarian that wants ""meat"" dishes this is the place for you. If you're a carnivore looking for an appetizing vegetarian dish, this place blows. To be clear, I don't really like meat substitutes. Since I'm not a vegetarian, when I want the taste of meat, I eat meat. I do however really like vegetarian dishes. A solid mix of veggies or a portobella sub-in for chicken or beef in a pasta dish or burger is kind of my style. Unfortunately the diner has hardly any (I don't remember seeing any, but surely there's a few), dishes that are straight vegetarian without bothering with the meat substitute. I got the avocado tostadas, and they were decent, not amazing. They would have been far better without the quinoa and far better if they actually threw a little salt on the veggies. And the veggies on it (aka bell peppers and onions) were kind of limp and pitiful. I was hoping for something a little more interesting out of the ""grilled veggies.""  Not to mention this is equivalent to a dish I eat a lot in Texas where it rarely runs about $8 unless you're putting fajita meat on it. Try $11 something here. I know vegetarian food can taste a hell of a lot better for cheaper. In fact, I think I can probably steam veggies at home with salt and pepper and be more satiated. So I'll leave this place for the ""meat"" seekers and get my fix elsewhere. I forgot to mention, I tried a bite of my SO's ""pork"" tacos. I'm going to say, I just can't judge them because they were so bad I'm not sure what they were supposed to taste like. Not just the ""pork"" but the taste in general was off. I don't know how else to describe it. They weren't spicy, but they wanted to be spicy. And they weren't flavorful, but they were trying to be. Not even sure what could have made them better (how about veggie taco with grilled portobella, bell peppers, onions, tomato, guacamole? maybe a little squash? eh?).

Chunks of seitan a just barely similar texture to chicken, drizzled with a very flavorful wing sauce, coming with standard sides of dressing and celery sticks. I then had the vegan gyros, which so closely resembled real gyros in appearance, texture, and flavor. Very well done! You definitely get that sort of nuttiness that you always get from fakemeats, but it's easy to ignore with the rest of the gyro flavor present. It's topped with the standard onion and tomato and comes with a very delicious tzatziki sauce. A perfect complement to the gyro were the diner potatoes, so pefectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The large chunks with a little ketchup, washed down with a little Goose, heaven in my stomach. It's places like Chicago Diner that make me wish I still lived in Chicago.

Last night I brought my brother and a friend by to finally have a chance to try it out. We started with the basic hummus and pita bread. Beyond basic, but insanely good. They brought out extra pita bread for 50 cents, no biggie.  For the main course I decided to get the chicken caesar wrap per the server's recommendation. I've gotten their black bean burgers before which were fantastic, so I wanted to try something new. The caesar wrap was amazing. It came with vegan dressing, cheese, seitan chicken, comfortably placed inside a spinach wrap. The seitan chicken was some of the best I've ever had. I think the best thing about being a vegetarian (slanting vegan!) is to be fooled by what you're eating. Awesome taste. For the side I got the always dependable sweet potato fries which are great. My guests both got the gyros which was equally tasty.  Reviews complain about the ""cramped"" space. I think it's exciting that the Diner has retained it's original concept for beginning over 27 years ago. Wonderful food, fantastic service, and well priced. Huge fan.

It started as a place I'd stop and grab some lunch if I got into the city way too early, and was meeting up with some friends in the area. The food was okay, but it was vegetarian, which was hard for me, as a 16 year old suburban kid, to find at anything besides pizza places or various Asian restaurants. I go back 1-5 times every year, and while the menu is constantly changing, it is CONSTANTLY improving. In addition to their amazing burgers, sandwiches, sides (Buffalo ""Chik'n Wings"", etc), they have a pretty awesome selection of Vegan Baked Goods (they get extra capitalization for sheer win), and a whole slew of organic sodas and beers, and I'm pretty sure I've even had a few awesome salads, including a raw tomato salad last summer, which completely blew me the heck away. The constantly evolving menu keeps things interesting, and the best new methods for making faux-meats get incorporated pretty quickly. Plus, almost everything on the menu can be made vegan (even the milk shakes!) I'd recommend this place to any vegetarian, vegan, or omnivore who is open to delicious flavors. One of my best friends got a Philly Cheez Steak, and thought it was just as good as the ones made from real stake he's had before, and he's a pretty harsh judge of vegetarian foods.

But on the whole, I like my meat and did not have high expectations for this place. However. It won me over. I still think it's a little overhyped, and the lines out the door on weeknights are just sort of silly (and for that reason, I don't anticipate going back a lot), but the food and the beer selection were both impressive. I had a sweet potato quesadilla that just got better and better with every bite (it was weird -- like the exact opposite of General Tso's chicken from a subpar Chinese takeout place). My boyfriend had a pretty basic garden salad that looked neither impressive nor disappointing. We both got a very tasty IPA to drink (or two...actually...). Good dinner on the whole. To finish up, after reading the Yelp reviews, we decided to get the vegan peanut butter cookie dough milkshake. And Yelpers, you were NOT wrong. Usually when something gets such rave reviews on here, I end up being disappointed because my expectations were so high, but this milkshake was not one of those things. My very carnivorous boyfriend was super skeptical to try it, but he actually ended up fighting me for the last of it. It was stupid delicious. He's even raved about it to friends of ours, which (trust me) he does not do too often. So. Get the peanut butter cookie dough milkshake. A million Yelpers are not wrong. Bottom line -- two non-vegetarians enjoyed their meals here quite a lot.

I ordered Huevos Rancheros, favorite dish I order most times I have brunch. The first plate came out with burned eggs. I mean burned black on the bottom.

At this point my husband and 4 year old are done eating and I STILL haven't received a palatable meal. The server confesses that they had run out of eggs after a busy Saturday and had to buy cage free eggs at Jewel. Yeah, I could taste the difference. So I order the Chxn Caesar Salad to go, because I can't really expect my family to wait, yet again for a third go round, but I'm starving. I dig into the salad at home to find the seitan is a bunch of big blocks of rock hard seitan- not at ALL what it looked like the last time I ordered it.

While it certainly won't break the bank, I think you get more bang for your buck at Karyn's which is also vegan (and I think better) while capping out at the same dollar amount. Worth checking out (especially if you live in Chicago) however I think there are better vegetarian friendly restaurants that aren't as expensive and also don't require a 20-30 wait for a table in a cramped, loud room. The outdoor seating is lovely when the weather is more favorable. Also check out their cook book and be sure to hit a dessert too. UPDATED 10/29/11 I just ate here a couple of days ago for the first time in about a year and was a little bummed out on the buffalo wings which, for $7, were slim strips of seitan with a light coating of seasoning. Maybe I'm just used to more substantial seitan strips from places like Watercourse in Denver (which SMOKE these in every category).. it was a disappointment. I won't get them again. Six slim strips of under seasoned seitan for $7 sucks. The soul bowl was quite good but a bit pricey. These guys continue to get more expensive however I don't feel the quality has increased. It'll be awhile until I return.",0.8852,0.87,0.089,0.041,0.5500536250536251

2010-01-27,5.0,"I'm a sucker for vegan/vegetarian places that serve comfort food and this didn't disappoint. I went two times during my visit, once for lunch and once for dinner. I arrived in Chicago on a very cold winter day, wearing only a hoodie that would usually suffice in San Francisco weather. Two things came to mind: I need a proper jacket and to eat.  I could have gone to one of the department stores on the Miracle Mile to find appropriate clothes, but I found myself on the Red Line heading to Boystown at lunchtime to get some eats. Somehow eating trumps warmth when you're hungry. While mulling over the extensive menu in one of the booths, I had ordered the soup of the day which warmed me up from the chilly walk to the restaurant. I narrowed it down to two options - the entree Country Fried ""Steak"" or the Dagwood Sandwich. I went with what the waiter suggested, the Dagwood Sandwich - it was a veggie meat smorgasbord (would ""orgy"" have been appropriate?) of seitan, beef and bacon. I also ordered a side of vegan mac and cheese to round out the experience. The sandwich was delicious, and I loved pigging out on the guilt-free meats. The only wish I had was that they used regular lettuce over the shredded lettuce that came on it. Although not as creamy and excessive as it's dairy counterpart, the mac and cheese was a good accompaniment. For dinner a few days later, I came on a Friday night at prime time hours. As expected, it was packed and there were a few parties waiting, but I was seated within fifteen minutes at a table. I immediately knew what I wanted: the Country Fried ""Steak"". I can never pass up anything out of seitan, especially when its fried.  As I cut a slice of seitan dripping with gravy and put it in my mouth, I knew I hit jackpot. This was diner food vegetarian style and it was good. It came with mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables - the potatoes were good and the vegetables were okay. To finish the meal off I had the yummy Chocolate Chip vegan cheesecake. Was it required? No. But did I care? No. It was yummy and a nice way to end the meal. I wandered off to the red line to head back to the hotel, in my proper winter coat I had bought a few days earlier to shield me from the cold Chicago nights, with the thought of this restaurant on my mind...",0.9952,0.839,0.14,0.021,0.5014892514892515

I know you'll be stuffed and many people skip the deserts but the cake slices and vegan shakes are just too. awesome. too. pass. up.

I recommend Chicago Diner's sandwiches. I have had most of them and they have never let me down.  If you go at dinner time or on a weekend you might have to wait 15-20+ minutes. Their waiting area is very small so you might be waiting outside... plan accordingly if the weather is bad. The last time I went it was very cold out so we all hopped over to a near by bar and had a drink while we waited.

Firstly - the wait.  During the week when I've come here for lunch there hasnt been much of a wait.  Weekday evenings have been mixed I've waited for max 12-20 minutes or didnt wait at all, very random. (the place isnt very large) Weekends- now almost every time I've come here on the weekends its been around lunch i'd say 12ish to 4ish, I've waited 0minutes to 25minutes.  Now with that said, there have been times when it has been busy and i've gotten food very quickly and times when its been empty and things took a little longer, not sure why, but the service of the staff is generally consistent= friendly and helpful. Now the food, I will tell you I've tried a lot of different things meat and meatless, and going here, you definitely see how some people can live on a strict vegan diet.  The sandwhiches are my favorite part of the menu, I would say the Reuben is my top choice, but you defintely should not be afraid to get adventurous (whether its a burger meatless wings) the food is great and most things are very tasty and the sauces and dips they are delicious (dont be afraid to ask for more)!

I see how uncomfortable my friends look, the self-consciousness in their eyes and fake smile as they pretend the pasta and probable jar sauce they've just been given are as enjoyable as what the rest of the table is chowing on.  It was this guilt, that lead me to almost give the Chicago Diner 4 stars. But, I couldn't in good conscience when what I really I meant was; this place deserves 4 stars...for a veggie/vegan restaurant, that is. I can't show favoritism just because there aren't many eateries that are explicitly for the non-meat /non-dairy lovers.  Breakdown: 1. There are no fries. It is not a diner if there are no fries and sweet potato fries absolutely do not count.  2. Avocado tostada- this just wasn't a good idea. I mean, there were flavors... did they intrigue my palate? did they meld? Not really. Are there more delicious veggie/vegan friendly things you can put on a tostada besides quinoa? Absolutely. It didn't add anything to the dish besides grainy texture. And! Tostadas are already messy, try eating on with tiny grains piled on em! Plus, the tortilla was meh. 3. Nachos- were tasty, but my (dairy) cheese was burned in the middle...conveniently the burned spot was localized under the guac and sour cream so I didn't realize it until I was half way through the plate.  4.

So we all agree on the Chicago Diner.  It's a cute little place, looks very clean and everyone that works in Chicago Diner is extremely friendly! We start out our meal with a few appetizers. We ordered the Hummus, the Potstickers and the Taquitos. The Hummus was excellent, I just love Hummus. It was almost as good as the Hummus I had at Semiramis (read an earlier review of mine), which is probably the best Hummus around. The Potstickers, our daughter recommended, she has been here before. She just loved the flavor and taste of the Potstickers. I would have to agree with her, they were very flavorful and tasty. We all thought they were very good. I was the only one who tried the Taquitos and I thought they were very good too. I thought nice and crispy and tasty. The dipping sauces added a little extra punch and flavor to the Taquitos too.  For our main courses our daughter ordered the Caesar Wrap, Maria ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak. We all sampled each others dishes. We all agreed my Philly Cheese Steak was the best. The faux steak was good, you could not tell it wasn't real meat. Our daughter's Caesar Wrap was good. Again I could not tell that it was a vegetarian dish. We all thought Maria's Mushroom Ravioli dish was just ok. It was the only true average dish of the whole meal.  We all ordered drinks too. I ordered a Banana and Blueberry smoothie, I love smoothies. It was very good! It was a dark blue color, from the blueberries and a strong banana flavor. Maria and our daughter both order tea for their drinks.  So overall we highly recommend Chicago Diner. Our total bill came to roughly $65 dollars for drinks, three appetizers and three main courses. A lot of food we thought for the price. It is a tough call though because Maria thought for a vegetarian place this was five stars but only four stars for an overall restaurant.

This is not to say that every item is incredible but at least I know how it is prepared. Also, for those who do not like the 'fake' meat type of items then this place is not for you. After 20 years of being a vegetarian, I don't really mind because it does offer some creativity (because I am hardly craving meat). Some of those examples should be done away with such as the Buffalo Hot Wings which look and taste like wheat gluten sticks (so, why call them Hot Wings?).  Prices are moderate, not cheap but not recession reminders either. Space is at a premium so I have yet to actually dine-in but have settled on carry-out. Wait staff, whether they are yours or not are friendly and helpful without coming off contrived.

This Thanksgiving, I am sure I will miss my great grandmothers gizzard gravy that I have eaten every year for the last  #*^%* years... but, more than any of those things I miss corned beef. Corned beef is delicious -- it's fatty, fleshy, pickled meaty goodness -- and I love it... errr.... loved it. I thought I would never eat corned beef again, and then we found The Chicago Diner. Now, we did go at about 3 in the afternoon, so we had no trouble getting a seat or parking, but that part of town is usually a bitch to park in or around, and I can see how if the Diner got even a little rush, it could be incredibly uncomfortable to wait for seating there. I ordered the Reuben, my hubby had the Polenta Lasagna. My Reuben was as good as any real meat reuben I have ever had-- maybe even better than many. As a side, I ordered tortilla soup: FANTASTIC flavor! The portions were tremendous. I was SO SO happy. The Lasagna, on the other hand, was really just a huge chunk of polenta (a peasant food that, for some reason restaurants charge an assload for -- here it was 12.99, kind of ridiculous) with herbed butter, on a bed of greens, topped with squash, zucchini, and purple onions...*yawn*. He ate it because he was really hungry but I probably wouldn't have. For desert we spilt  a piece of AMAZING chocolate pumpkin cheesecake -- so good it made me want to stand up on the table and sing.

After VegNews named this place the best diner of 09, I was beside myself to try it.  I made the long trip out from Bridgeport and squealed all the way down Halsted to the front door.  It was crowded, but it was Sunday morning in a diner, what do you want? We sat and were given coffee in paper cups, since the mugs were all taken. Not a huge deal, but my guest wasn't amused.  After perusing the menu very seriously, we decided - he'd have the sausage and biscuits with gravy, I'd have a pancake with scrambly tofu, taters, and seitan sausage.  You're right - it DOES sound amazing. My potatoes were too large and underseasoned, the seitan sausage was dry and hard (my guest's was tender, maybe because it was covered in gravy?), and my scrambly tofu was one-note.  I was really upset by this.  I have mad respect for a place that feeds the masses without one fallen animal, but I was heartbroken with the quality of my grub.   I don't know if it was because it was a busy Sunday, or because I built it up too much, but I was just not impressed.  Did I choose badly?  Did the good cook have the day off?  I don't know.  I hope there was a good reason.  Because I want the Chicago Diner to rule my seitan-eating ass, and when I come back to Chicago, I will trek back up to Lincoln Park from wherever I am and I will eat there again.  I need to believe that this place can be everything I need it to be.

That was what happened to me when I went to the Chicago Diner. For years people have been telling me how great it is, and how I just absolutely MUST try it. Sure, I'm not a veggie but I do love me some good vegetarian food. So when my girlfriend asked me to take her here for her birthday, I was happy to comply. The menu appears to change seasonally, which is kind of cool. Lots of items looked really tasty, but I finally settled on the veggie buffalo wings. I've had and made all kinds of veggie buffalo wing flavored foods. I've enjoyed all of them, so I figured it would be a safe bet.

Brown, almost black, lumpy logs drenched in sauce. I was a little nervous, but I decided to give it a go. I felt even worse when I had a hard time cutting one of the little logs with my knife. But the worst was when I put it in my mouth - horrible chewy dense texture with a disgusting spicy sauce. This was not even CLOSE to buffalo wing flavor. Maybe they mixed up and gave me BBQ sauce, but either way it was horrid. I managed to choke down one and then I couldn't eat any more. It has been a LONG time since I ordered something I couldn't eat, but I definitely could not finish this. Thankfully my girlfriend's food was the saving grace. Tostadas layered with a spicy black bean paste, topped with grilled veggies, quinoa, and avocado. It was pretty tasty. The chips and salsa were good too, but how do you mess that up?

Yes yes y'all ... 5. Sweet potato quesadillas. I wish every quesadilla was that awesome.  6. CAKE. They have the best cake. If you're not stuffed by the end of your meal, eat some cake. 7. Great fun to take skeptical carnivores. So far every skeptical carnivore I've taken here has been rather pleasantly surprised at how tasty their meal was. That's right. Become a believer. 8.

NO.  The second time we spoke, I confirmed he'd have the time to pick up food, and she helped me pick out things that would make the trip to Boston.  TWO reubens, a Jerk Chick'n wrap, pulled ""pork"" sandwich and hard-to-transport country friend steak dinner. Laura jumped right on it, separately packing sauces and ""cheezes"" and stuff to faciliate transport.  Everything made it here fine. And the important part is that what we've eaten so far even after 8 hours of travel was absolutely the best vegan sandwich I've EVER had.  The Reuben totally killed, how do they DO it?  And it's huge, who can complain about the size or price of this thing, $10?  Laura threw in a piece of birthday cheezecake for me, and a fabulously delicious if crumbly chocolate nut cookie bar. (I heated it for 10 seconds, awesome!) The one thing my husband really misses eating is pork BBQ, and that sandwich really impressed him.

It served me in good stead, however, when I was trapped at RTC Great Lakes (for three months longer than I should have been) and befriended a vegan shipmate who'd gone vegetarian out of necessity, and couldn't stand another day subsisting on corn and apples. I told her about the Chicago Diner, and on our first free Saturday after that we hopped on the Metra and were on our way. I'm still an omni myself, but incredibly picky in regards to meat and in many cases will choose tofu because I know it won't taste ""funny"". On the diner's menu, however, the thing that piqued my interest most was the portobello caesar wrap. Stuffed with big slabs o' mushroom, veggies, your choice of soy or dairy cheese, and creamy caesar dressing. OMGSOGOOD. I actually ended up ordering this the next three times we visited--and now I'm sad, because the last time I checked the online menu, it was gone. I'm determined to approximate this at home. Their shakes are indeed delicious--special nod to the choco-peanut-butter--but they disappear way too quickly for costing $6.50! Their seasonal desserts are also great, in particular the margarita cupcakes that I enjoyed at the height of last summer. My friend brought back a slice of raw berry ""cheesecake"" that didn't hold its shape too well on the train ride back, but still tasted great.

2009-08-26,3.0,"To a windy city vegetarian, Chicago Diner might as well be McDonald's.  I believe it took all of three days of living in the city before I made it here based on reputation alone a decade ago.  Back in those days, it was pretty much the be-all, end-all of vegetarian restaurants - a meat free oasis.  It was the only place in Chicago where I could eat anything on the menu (not that this was necessarily a good thing as part of the reason I'm a vegetarian is I have a hard time with food decisions). Now with veggie friendly restaurants a dime a dozen (well maybe a dime a half dozen), Chicago Diner is not the only choice.  But there's a reason it's still among the first few herbivorian restaurants on anyone's lips - and it's not just location.  Despite being the grande dame of Chicago's greens scene, it still holds up to a point. We put off Chicago Diner until mid-year for Veggie Supper Club because it was sort of predictable; but for the August offering, we could no longer hold out.  One thing had changed since I last went here.  Arriving early on what seems like it might have been the last warm day of summer, we went to the back patio.  It's far from scenic - it's almost claustrophobic - but it is still a nice way to commiserate and it made the wait nil on a Monday night.  According to our server, however, the waits are still huge on weekends. The service was surprisingly friendly considering the crowds with our server sitting down and explaining everything.  And the menu is surprisingly complex.  Far more than I remember with some of the items bordering on gourmet.  They have begun to explore the raw food movement (to mixed results) and have a juice bar. Each item on the menu's that not vegan can be made that way, but hopefully the Diner sticks to being a vegetarian restaurant.  Vegans seem to be ruining every other veggie restaurant in Chicago but the diner still proudly and thankfully serves milk and egg products. I was actually limited in what I could eat to soft food (making me pickier than a vegan) which was a shame since the Chicago Diner makes fake meat better than most restaurants through years of experience.  Of what I could have on the menu, the mashed potatoes were excellent and the polenta was good (though oddly it came as solid chunks that broke down into a more liquidy consistency in the mouth).  I did risk stomach issues to try a bit of Andre W.'s gyro.  And it was every bit as mind numbing a meat substitute as I remember from having it multiple times at the Taste of Chicago. Stick to the fake meat at this place and everything will be alright, I guess. I guess only because the prices have never been great but are now bordering on nuts.  Even the sides are around $5.  It's Mana Food Bar prices (next stop Green Zebra) but hasn't quite reached its quality.  Which is a shame because it's had years of a head start to do it. But since Chicago Diner will probably be around for another 30 years, I'm sure, maybe one day it will.",0.9463,0.808,0.11,0.082,0.5177767810420872
2009-08-25,4.0,"Chicago Diner is one of those places I'm always trying to get my friends to go to. It's got healthy, whole food options (one of the few places in Chicago with quinoa on the menu), but it also has veg junk food like fake seitan ""meats"" and soy milkshakes.  I love the outside patio in the summer months. They are good about accommodating food allergies (have a gluten free menu, offer the option of dairy or soy cheese for almost all dishes) and in the past year or so have started offering a couple of raw entrees and desserts, including a very good raw cheesecake.  Last night I made the mistake of over-snacking beforehand so I came already full (lamentably...since Chicago Diner is one of a handful of places in Chicago I feel like I can really chow down) but thought the French Onion Soup sounded divine. Unfortunately they were out of it, and all soups in fact. :^(.  So, I decided to just stick with juice, of the fresh squeezed, vegetable variety. It was good but *ludicrously* expensive ($9.00 for a 12 ounce green juice, with carrot swapped out for broccoli and ginger added.) I was disappointed that I couldn't taste the ginger so I brought it back up front to get some more added. The juice gal pleasantly accommodated this but I saw that she poured in some pre-juiced ginger that must either be diluted or not at peak freshness because even with the additional shot I couldn't taste it. Considering how costly the juices are, I really think they should juice the ginger fresh each time.    (SIDENOTE: Chicago really needs some vegetable juice bars!). Our server was friendly and overall I had a fun time. Really last night was more of a 3-star experience but I've been happy at Chicago Diner enough that I feel it deserves 4.",0.9936,0.777,0.177,0.046,0.44699905033238363
2009-08-25,4.0,"My last visit to The Diner was an enjoyable one.  The patio was open, it was a nice, summer day, and our server was friendly and mostly attentive. Our menu: The Reuben Sandwich (a Diner classique) - consistency varies from visit to visit with this one, but rarely does it disappoint.  The 'corned beef' has a great texture and flavor and the portion size isn't something to joke about either. Country Fried Steak - I think I ordered this because, honestly, of the word 'gravy'...I love gravy.  This gravy was grand; perfectly creamy and rich flavored, a touch of made-at-home spice: oh yeah, this gravy was what I wanted.  And it covered the country fried chicken/steak (whatever it was), which reminded me of an earthy Salisbury flavor.  Um, let's throw back to the days of school lunch with Country Fried Steak, or Chicken, or some such thing...The Chicago Diner gives me this and more: the seasonal vegetables in pesto were perfectly prepared.  A heaping portion of beautiful, bright, green broccoli florets, cauliflower, and vibrant squashes made my Country Delight a stage for a garden girl's dream ballet - I would eat those vegetables alone for the rest of my life and be happy.  And the gravy business?  Agony.  I had to eat as much as I could, it was that satisfying. There was an a la carte pancake ordered, which did *not* meet our expectations or needs, but the blueberry compote with which it was served was really fabulous - not too tart, just sweet enough, and bright flavor and color. There was a dessert ordered: the black forest cake.  We peeped one go by earlier in the meal and made a mental note, 'for later.' At first bite, I wasn't impressed.  The carob/cocoa action was flat.  The second bite, however, re-convinced me, as I let the creamy texture melt in my mouth, the chocolaty flavor wash over my tongue, the little bit of crust crunch lightly between my teeth -- I could have done with a lot more cherries.  And not just the gelled ones on top - fresh cherries and more cherry flavor would have made this cake sing, rather than just hum.  I did, however, find the strength to eat it all with my counterpart.  So...it wasn't all that flat in the end.",0.9984,0.744,0.229,0.027,0.5781481481481481

The food is for the most part good, sometimes really good, but is overpriced. I've been here a few times and always like the food, but the prices (and frequently the wait times for a table) are almost always sure to keep me away for the next year or so, sending me to Veggie Bite when I want a vegetarian version of a fast food sandwich.  Because this is a vegetarian restaurant, they have real eggs, cheese and other dairy in some of the items, which is awesome. Especially when that cheese is all over fake chorizo nachos. Mmmm....seitanrizo....The sweet potato fries are delicious. I had a spicy cocoa cupcake with cinnamon frosting and a margarita flavored cake with lime frosting - both were delicious and would happify anyone, but I dislike that the cakes were served cold instead of being brought to room temperature first, cause cold frosting sucks.  Portions of what I got were tiny, but I saw some massive platters of food going to other people, so I'd have to say that portions are somewhat inconsistent.

My veg inclined friends are always telling me how much money I could save by not eating meat - they must not eat here all the time. Vegetarian food - especially sandwiches - should not cost more than meat versions, unless truffles are involved. Good truffles, too. Or maybe unless vegetables from other parts of the world that had to be imported are involved. Maybe.  10 chips, a dollop of salsa and a little glop of guacamole? Like $9 with one refill of chips. They have a children's menu (yea!) but charged me $4 for an tiny apple juice for a 2-year-old (boooo!). Veggie enchiladas for $11? I could see the $5 for the (yummy) sweet potato fries, if only the portion was not like as if it was a part of the kids' menu - you should never be able to count the fries on your plate. I want that number un-fricking-countable. The bill for four people was almost $100 - and two of us only shared veggie nachos, fries and cake... That is not what I'm talking about for diner food - that's my freaking grocery bill.  I guess I want more than diner ambiance for those kind of prices.

Which brings me to:  our waiter.  What an un-delightful person.  Since when does Chicago Diner hire someone with no personality that can't even drop by to refill our water (and where was the ice?  It was 90 degrees today!

Yes. I *chose* to mess with O'Hare, a car rental, AND Chicago traffic, all for a Vegetarian Diner. That is an illness, lads. No, seriously. It *was* an illness: I was one tunnel of light short of dying the day before leaving Dublin, but not wanting to change everyone's plans, I stupidly flew anyway. I was so grateful when we landed in Chi-Town; I thought that some relief would be near. No such luck, but since I was apparently about to meet St. Peter anyway, I figured that I ought to go ahead and get some food for the walk up to the pearly gates.  We completed the pilgrimage to the Diner, and out of mortal defiance, I ordered the Dagwood. I then hid in the adorably claustrophobic wee toilet -splashing water on my face to keep from passing out- until the food arrived.  I had one bite. -And it might have been the best sandwich of my life, but it is hard to accurately judge with one foot in the grave. Our sweet waiter gave me a free sweet to take on the plane -should I survive the journey, and he routed us around Downtown and Lake Michigan to see all of the sights.  We returned to O'Hare. And if nothing else, I could then die with one more check on my list, and one more taste of the good life on my tongue.  Happily, I lived to tell the tale, and dream of the day when I can return to the Chicago Diner. Like I said, it might have been the best sandwich of my life.

As an appetizer, I had an order of the seitan hot wings, which came with celery and ranch dressing.  The sauce was dead on exactly what you would get on hot wings. the seitan came in sticks (not pressed into any wng shape or anything) and were very tasty.  As my main course, I got the ""bacon cheeseburger"" and a side of sweet potato fries.  Very, very satisfying, all of it.  Sometimes even a vegetarian craves a bacon cheeseburger.  The one I had here came pretty close, thought he bacon was not as crispy as it could have been.  Nonetheless, the Kaiser roll, sprouts, grated carrots, onions and lettuce that came on the burger were just terrific.   This place is terrific.  I can't wait to return and eat my way through the menu!",0.9919,0.807,0.153,0.041,0.6160199175824176

I suggested the Chicago diner so she would have alot of options to choose from (I am not a vegan but vegan friendly). We called prior to see if it was BYOB seeing as we'd never been there before.

After a fifteen minute wait we were seated only to discover on the menu that they do sell wine and beer (which the waitress didnt feel necessary to mention) and that in order to drink our own wine we had to pay ten dollars (not a big issue at all but it would of been considerate for her to mention this when I had called). Regardless we forked over the ten dollars and setteled for our own wine.  We had both ordered the portabello wrap - mine with spicey black beans and hers with vegan mac and cheez. The wrap was AMAZING, The spicy beans were just what they said--- quite spicy. she wasnt horribly impressed with her mac and cheez especially since a friend had told her it was her favorite dish.  The waitress was rather whiney but nice and quite attentive. The food (minus the mac and cheeze) was very very good.

We waited for 15 mins for outdoor seating and they even came to get us when our table was ready. The outdoor seating, hidden by the kitchen, is absolutely charming. It was beautiful and quiet and had such lovely lighting. We all really enjoyed the outside experience. Our waiter was patient with all of my omni friends who were quiet overwhelmed and I so excited I didnt know what to get.  We ended up getting a seasonal appetizer, which I believe was artichoke dip with pita chips. It was really delicious, but the portion was barely enough for a bite each for the 4 of us. More so, the price didn't fit the portion. Now we ordered the Reuben, the Chikn Ranch, and Portabella Caesar Wrap. The Reuben and the Chikn Ranch was by far all of our favorites. We ate every bite, even when our stomach were saying no. The Portabella wrap was a little bland and completely fell apart. Their reuben is absolutely amazing. I never liked Reuben's when I was an omni, but this one was amazing. They make their own sauerkraut, which was a bit crispy making it taste so nice and fresh. And the seitan! Even my omni friends could not believe that it was vegan. The Chikn Ranch sandwich was also so good.  We all decided to get cake. Deciding on Cookies n' Cream and Lemon Raspberry. But as a vegan who dies to bake...eh, it doesnt live up to the price tag or the description. Cookies n' Cream was dry and not as flavorful as it could have been. Lemon Raspberry was quite delicious, but again the flavors were a bit dull and the cake still somewhat dry. If you do decide to get desert, I would get their cheesecake, milkshake, or if you really want cake, to get one that is more fruit centered as they appear to be more moist.  I went back a few months later and got a Reuben with the mac and cheese. The Reuben was great, aside from the bread having soaked a bit of the juices from the plate, so it wasn't as crisp and toasty as I would have liked. But the mac and cheese. Any vegan who missed GOOD and almost real mac and cheese...order a plateful. I was so taken aback. I had to ask my waiter to make sure that it was the vegan version as it tasted so real. Didn't have any nooch aftertaste that most homemade recipes have. Seriously brilliant. My table then all decided to split a huge peanut butter chocolate milk shake.

She asked me how I was, and I looked pathetically up at her, and asked if I could have a cup of tea. With an expression like she'd found a lost kitten, she said they had a ton of types, and listed a few. I chose the yerba mate.

In that time I'd had the leisure to open the menu, see that there were many wonderful things, but the only thing that mattered was the first on the list: Soup of the day, ask your waiter.

They did bring out Sriracha hot sauce, so I gotta give them props for that.

I will say that customer service was king here though - the servers were pleasant and when my friend and I spent a long time chatting after we had finished our food and the table was cleared, they didn't try to rush us out the door.

I also like the vegan buffalo ""wings,"" chicken parmesan sandwich, and the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. (I admit, having grown up in Indiana I like faux meat.) And if it's on the menu, the vegan maki is excellent.  The two main failings of Chicago Diner are the desserts and the hit-or-miss service. First off, Chicago Diner prides itself on its vegan desserts, but in my experience they are just awful. The cakes are very dense and very dry. The vegan cheesecake is unpalatable, and the cookies are gritty and crumbly. The saving grace here is the milkshake made with Cookie Dough Temptation, but I give more credit to Chicago Soy Dairy for that. And, unfortunately, the service is really inconsistent. I've had some great service here from some really great servers, but sometimes it seems there are servers who are just aloof, inattentive, and generally unfriendly.

Granted, they are health conscious meat eaters, one a former vegetarian, but their overall approval is telling. Chicago Diner isn't ""weird"". I was highly impressed with the variety of the menu. There are lots of fresh vegetables on hand, as well as meat substitutes, used to create ethnic or American traditional dishes. Sandwiches come with the side order of your choice (12 choices!). Some will cost you a dollar extra, but judging from my dollar side salad, it is worth it. Fresh sprouts galore. Things like vegan potato salad, macaroni and cheeze, sweet potato fries, are no extra cost with your sandwich. This is a great place to visit if one is craving junk food but doesn't want to feel like crap after eating it. I ordered the blackened tofish sandwich (with advocanaisse?) with side salad. My two companions ordered a gyro with Spanish rice and the roasted vegetable lasagna. I must admit, my tofish sandwich was weird. It looked like a blackened, perfectly rectangular slab of tofu, but tasted like Cajun blackened fish (did not have the texture). How did they make the tofu taste like fish? I have no idea, but I would order it again. The multi-grain bun that makes up the sandwich is delicious and very filling. We were all excited to try each others' food. The gyro was great, except a little too salty. The vegan tzatziki sauce will knock your socks off...its different from dairy, but in many ways better. The gyro-eater wanted me to try the Spanish rice ""for my review"". He thought it was ""okay"". I thought it was great since he had already poured a bunch of tzatziki sauce on it. The roasted vegetable lasagna was fresh tasting, and the companion was impressed that it filled him up. I know they have beer and wine, I'm not sure about full bar so check on that. When a waitstaff messed up the drink order they appropriately offered to fix it but the companion decided to have the ""surprise"" drink. It's a pleasant place.

Our most recent meal was the dinner special of faux duck with orange sauce sided with some sort of wild rice pilaf.  I can't remember if the meat was tempeh or seitan, but whatever they did to it, they did it well.  We also got the Rawchos, which we first tried a long time ago and have ordered consistently ever since the first time.  I must warn you, though, that the first time we ordered Rawchos they came on a huge platter with a lot of chips for all the fancy raw fixins.  Now they are a high-end appetizer with very few chips involved.  In fact, this has been our only complaint at Chicago Diner.  Ever.  But our waiter completely accomodated us by giving us extra chips for dirt cheap.  Anyway, Rawchos are amazing and still worth checking out.  Just be prepared to need extra chips.   Don't sleep on the desserts here either.  We took a slice of Raspberry Espresso Cheesecake home for breakfast the next morning and it rocked the house.  They have raw desserts too, but I didn't like the raw carrot cake we tried way back when, and was really sad to have wasted dessert on it.  Conclusion:  raw entree good, raw dessert bad.  Anyway, they doo cakes too!  A couple months ago, I drove in to pick up a Cookies N Cream cake for my birthday, which my Wisconsinite meat-and-dairy-loving family absolutely loved.  (I loved it too.)   They also have great Bloodies in the morning and an outdoor patio in the back and darn friendly waitstaff.  If you've never been, you've never lived.  So go be born.",0.9755,0.81,0.123,0.067,0.4404663629053872

I tried a friend's spinach soup, and even though I'm not a fan of spinach, it was amazing.

2008-06-15,5.0,"A return to Chicago is not complete for me without a stop at Chicago Diner for their philly cheeze ""STEAK"" sandwich. The thinnest layers of sliced seitan cozied up with sauteed onions & peppers and melted cheese all atop a multi-grain baguette. This is my favorite sandwich of all time and seriously holds a piece of my heart.  It had been over a year since my last philly cheeze steak experience, but I revisited Chicago Diner last weekend and was so not disappointed. OH. MY. GOODNESS. I always try and save a half for leftovers but can never do it. I washed it all down with a pitcher of their classic margarita and could not say no to a slice of vegan lemon raspberry cake which our awesome server brought out with a bonus scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream for my two friends and I to enjoy. Both of whom I might add said they were just not down with vegan cake and would likely not be sharing any with me. Ha. We all ate up every last bite of it and agreed it was truly some serious yummyness.  If you haven't tried one of their vegan cakes, please do yourself a favor and try one! They're dense but delicious, the cookies & cream cake being my particular favorite. And the best part, they can be enjoyed practically guilt free. The atmosphere is warm, friendly and inviting. Situated in a small house in the heart of boys town, I prefer the booths, but the back patio's awfully nice as well, especially in the spring. The servers are usually super friendly and eager to make recommendations. The music is equally cool and only adds to a great background to hang with your buds and enjoy amazingly freshly prepared veggie eats. Afterwards, I suggest moving across the street to the Town Hall Pub for more drinks. My friends bartend there and are some of the nicest girls around. Request some homemade watermelon vodka in your soda and munch on some veggie jerky and you will not be disappointed.  I wish we had a Chicago Diner in the bay area but I guess that would make it less special and one less reason for me to visit Chicago.

Recently, my boyfriend ordered the panko crusted tofu and it was so yummy I couldn't believe we were at Chicago Diner and they've really stepped up their vegan dessert game. There's even a daily raw special!  But honestly, what I really love about Chicago Diner is that they have a few different options with tempeh. My naturopath (a holistic doctor) told me I should lay off of so much tofu, because all the estrogen in the soybean curd may be throwing off my hormones and such. However, fermented forms of tofu, tempeh and miso, don't have as many hormones and are actually considered better for you. So I love that I can get both tempeh strips, a tempeh sandwich or miso soup here.

Maybe my standards for vegan/vegetarian fare was set too high by places that use salt and creative menu choices. Maybe it's the fact that the menu resembles the Morning Star line of products in the freezer a little too closely to justify paying premium for it.

The only problems i encounter are that i can never decide what i want to eat.  Being vegan for the past year and having other various eating restrictions for the past several years before, i'm used to having 1-3 options on any given menu. The decision is usually salad, french fries or pasta.  But here, i can eat almost anything and it is overwhelming every time.  also, the hot cider is perfect. oh, wait, once i had this stir-fry over noodle thing... it was awful.  don;t get that.",-0.8191,0.839,0.054,0.107,0.5718269230769231

I had the eggs with potato-tempeh hash, and biscuits, also served with a seitan sausage patty. I was a little weary of eating anything that was made to taste like anything else. The sausage patty I did not like in the least. There was no flavor, and for a meat eater maybe its because I believe it so so hard to honestly duplicate the taste. It seemed a little dry. Now for the eggs, to me an egg is an egg, cage free, free range whatever they all taste the same. The potato-tempeh hash was very delicious. It had red pepper, green peppers, and cubed potatoes and tempeh. I must say though the best was the biscuits. They were awesome very fluffy and so yummy. I am not sure what the sauce was that was served on them since it lacked flavor. The coffee was very strong (no complaints here.) My sister ordered the miso corn chowder which she said was pretty good, a large fresh orange juice, and ordered a cobb salad to go which looked huge with seitan meat strips. Our bill was $34. The waitress we had was super friendly and was great reccommending things for a non-vegan to try. It is a pretty small place maybe 15 tables.

The given was that I had to have something with the ice cream because it's a local brand and it is rated as a top yummy by veggie-heads like myself. Significant other unit and I started with a blue moon beer (he) and a chocolate milkshake (me) and an order of the bufalo wings to start us off.  The buffalo wings were more like ribs and bbq sauce, but I really, really liked them -- it was my first faux meat dish (besides the tofurky hot dogs and cold cuts I've been getting at Trader Joe's). The ranch dressing was a little liquidy but tasted great and was a fab accompaniment to the veggies (grated cabbage, good sized sliced carrots and teeny celery stalks). I then had the black beans and rice platter that came out huuuge and delectable. I couldn't get over how delicious the rice was, how nicely spiced the beans were, and how fresh the sauerkraut. He had the cowboy chili and loved it! I was really sorry that I had to leave the two pickle spears and kale leaves, but I could eat no more! I was too stuffed for dessert, which is a shame, but I know I can always go to Whole Foods and get a CD cake slice or other baked good. So it wasn't that major of a loss.

They have a very extensive menu, and perhaps I talk myself into believing that I will order something that is anything better than ""meh!"". I usually leave asking why I went again. First off, I should mention the Chicago Diner is going to move directly across the street soon. Hopefully this will solve some of the seating problems. The restaurant is pretty small and at peak times, the wait can be long for a table. When the weather is nice, the outdoor seating helps out a lot, but if you go during the cold weather season, be prepared to wait out on Halsted.  My problem with the Diner is this, it's supposed to be the incredibly well known vegetarian restaurant. Visitors know of it and flock to it, but it just isn't that good! Many of the faux meat items I have had tried are either rubbery (most recently, the chicken style seitan in the stir fry) or overly greasy (chicken parmesan sandwich). I just think that the reputation this place has, coupled with it's long history should lead to much tastier food. They do a few things well, the vegan mac and cheese is pretty tasty, but overall I find this place inconsistent. The only thing that I have  ever ordered more than once is the biscuits and gravy, which are good... but can't touch the Handlebar's. One good thing about the Chicago Diner (and the thing that got them three stars instead of two) is that the desserts are excellent. They have great vegan cakes and cheesecakes. They also have great vegan milkshakes, they aren't cheap (6 bucks!) but, they are pretty damn good. If you have to go, get a coffee and dessert, that way you won't be disappointed. I almost feel bad, as a long time vegan, giving this place a less than glowing review. I am glad it's there, but I just wish they would work to make it better. When I travel to places like New York, I get a taste of what can be done with vegan food (Red Bamboo, S'nice, ad infinitum) and the Diner isn't in the same league, not even close.

There was a ""half-hour"" wait to get inside the restaurant so we waited outside in the cold with a bunch of fellow patrons also waiting to get inside. Oh, and, by the way, these ""regulars"" of the Chicago Diner all reeked of musty hippi stank and patchouli and made the cold air even more unbearable.

In fact, I think it's quite fun! It brings back warm childhood nostalgia of sipping milkshakes and blowing papers of straws at the passing people.

Well, the vegetarian gyros probably wasn't all that bad except that I couldn't really tell what it tasted like since I had to chew through a pound of burnt char. Is char a word? I don't know if it is, but it should be one solely to describe this vegetarian gyros. As for the rueben, I think I saw tears well up in my bf's eyes as he tried to choke the sucker down. Poor little guy. I felt bad for him so I rubbed his little tummy and treated him to a coldstone creamery concoction with TWO mix-ins after din-din.

I had the seitan ceasar wrap with mashed potatoes. The wrap was good, but the seitan was quite burnt on some pieces and the gravy on the mashed potatoes had  way to much seasoning; it tasted like something from a frozen dinner. He had the dagwood, which had fake bacon and such on it. I thought the ceasar wrap was tastier. Our server never once came to ask how anything was. Even if I was eminating a bitch vibe, I feel a server should still check in. I may go back...we'll see.",-0.7003,0.908,0.036,0.056,0.5104166666666667

We ordered the Fiesta Calzones for appetizers, I got the Chiken Parmesan Sandwich with the French Onion Soup and he got some Asian inspired noodles something.  FORTY minutes later (no exaggeration), during which we seriously contemplated just getting up and leaving because our waiter did not approach us ONCE for anything- forget telling us something was wrong or that the food was coming, or even to refill our water - our main course comes out. When we ask the waiter what happened to the calzones, he shrugs, and smiles like he couldn't give a damn. I - very politely- ask him if he would go check on it and he flounces off to go figure it out. We contemplate whether to start eating, and finally, because we're so hungry by this time, we do, and the French Onion soup is awful- it tasted like the broth itself was ""off"". The Chiken Parmesan Sandwich was quite good, and I was midway into it when our server (finally! he didn't return once before this to tell us what had happened to the calzone!!) returned with A calzone on a plate.  (It said calzone(s)-plural-on the menu!). Being as small, chaotic, cluttered and claustrophobic as the place is, the table was even smaller and there was very little place to put the calzone as well our our main courses. We managed somehow, and the calzone itself was pretty damn good.

There is no greater feeling for a vegetarian then to look at the whole menu and be able to order ANYTHING and EVERYTHING off of it! It's so liberating! :0) And let me tell you, everything on the Chicago Diner menu is wonderful! I prefer to eat there around their brunch hours, because you get the best of both worlds, the yummy breakfast stuff and lunch options as well.  I always try different dishes every time I go and I often drag non veggies with me, and we are always pleased with what we get! For the non veggies out there, let me explain something. The Chicago Diner uses tofu, seitan, and tempeh to give the vegetarian meals some bulk and make it more filling and more interesting. They use these soy products to have ""fake"" bacon, Reuben sandwiches, fillet sandwich, gyros, etc. The list could go on and on! It is amazing what they do with soy! Truly! But don't worry not all things have a soy product in them! They use real eggs, and they have stir fries and other things without the ""fancy veggie soy products"". Some things we have tried and loved: For an App. we all loved the nachos with seitan chorizo. For meals: Cowboy Chili, Black Bean Burger, Radical Reuben, Green Eggs & ""Ham"", the home style potatoes, and pretty much all of the desserts are fantastic! If I had to pick I would say Cookies and Cream cake is my favorite! The atmosphere is very much old time diner, it's pretty small but in a cozy way. The staff is always very friendly and it's always busy, but you never really have to wait that long. But if it is right in the middle of a prime time to eat out, plan on waiting, maybe even outside. So dress warm! But it is completely and totally worth the wait. In the summer, they have a great back patio and they also have parking which is free during the evening and I believe on weekends as well.  If you don't like something, if it's not cooked right, just send it back or tell them, they are always happy to please. I got a complimentary dessert when I thought my seitan was a little tough.  The Diner is always updating their menu by adding great new dishes, which makes it fun for regulars like me!  Check out their website, it's really fantastic...has pretty much the whole menu with prices etc I just can't say enough great things about the Diner, my husband and I love it so much that he took me there the night he proposed!
