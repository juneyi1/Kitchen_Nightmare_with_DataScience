Their default is pork, it might be better if you went with that. I also tried the goat cabrito, which had basically no flavor at all. With so many better options not too far away on Division, I'd skip this place, regardless of what the New York Times travel section has to say.",-0.5848,0.815,0.066,0.12,0.5887445887445887

2017-06-11,5.0,"One of the best Puerto Rican foods I had in years. Today I went to the north side with my whole family and we decided to go eat Puerto Rican food  I had the arroz con gandules y lechón, Omg the portions are big. The pork is tender and very flavorful and the rice the same. My parents had the pinchos with morcilla the flavor were amazing on both. The morcilla a bit spicy but very delicious. My brother had arroz con gandules with roasted chicken, he couldn't finished it cause the portions are big. He enjoyed it very much though. Just a heads up it's self served, you get your food and then sit and eat. I suggest you take it to go, but you get free bread with butter if you eat in the restaurant.

He talked about how delicious and inexpensive the food was and honestly I couldn't wait to eat here. My LO is now 6 months but my first craving to try this place was when I was very pregnant.. I'm glad I didn't go when I was pregnant because sadly it feel extremely short of my expectations. I didn't expect a big fancy restaurant so that made no difference in this review. This is purely based on food and customer service. We started off with appetizers-bacalaito, morcilla, and sorullo... all old. Tasted old--like they all had been sitting there from the night prior. I, myself, was extremely excited about ordering verdura with bacalao... that alone was a plate  there was no smaller portion so you could order a side like rice. I ordered my daughter arroz con gandules and lechón. My husband ordered bistec encebollado with arroz blanco y habichuelas. And two pops. $50 at check out plus the girl that worked the register was rude and unapproachable. We asked several employees about guineos en escabeche and two didn't know what I was talking about and the girl at the register said ""what?!?!"" (Stank face) THATS SPECIAL ORDER ONLY!!  Oh. Ok. Sorry for asking.  My daughters lechón was the only thing we enjoyed. Everything else was mediocre. The bacalao on the verdura was dry and just whack. Not worth $50. So disappointing.

My mom grew up in poor neighborhoods and I have family still residing in poor areas but this area is just ew. Dirty, dingy, eerily empty streets and the restaurants connecting apartment (I'm assuming is part of the restaurant) had wood/cardboard covering broken windows. The place is ok. It really is Puerto Rican in the sense that it looks like one of those little dingy shacks where they sell food for cheap in Puerto Rico. The food is decent, not the best. The alcapurrias tasted like they were mixed with flour or something to make them look bigger and the meat in them wasn't that good. The only good thing here is the Sorrullos. They are Delicious!  The service is horrible. The young cashier girl and the dark skinned older woman in the kitchen were really nice people but the owner is so mean and treats the staff badly.

Let me start by saying I'm Puerto Rican and have tried plenty of prican food around this area.  I have to say that I was so disappointed, I had been looking forward to going to this place all week.  I went on a Saturday afternoon, was not crowded.  when I walked in I literally said to myself ""what the fu@$"" its so small inside hardly room to walk.  We got a table quick were greeted nicely.  I went to the bathroom and right away I knew the place was going to suck.  No it wasn't dirty, it was ghetto!!! The toilet paper just sitting on a ledge where literally everyone is touching the whole roll! Sick!!! The paper towels are located outside the bathroom (wtf).  Oh and forgot to mention I was with 3 other ppl.  2 of us ordered the jibarito with arroz con gandules and habichuelas. The other person ordered a pork chop w/rice and beans. Ok so the food wasn't the worst I've had but not the best and the quantity SUCKS!! My jibarito was so small, but I'm also use to the big ones that were served @ boriquen.  Anyhow while I'm eating some (gangbanger type of looking dude) walks in with his gf and kid sit at the table next to us and literally I lost my appetite after listening to him talk very loudly saying and I quote ""I was raised by nig$ers so I don't speak Spanish"" omg I was ready to just stand up and leave but unfortunately my friends were still eating! This place is just so poorly ran.  I think it gets all the hype bc of the style of how they present the food and all of the options.  That doesn't mean its good though.  Why would u want to eat pork chops or anything else fried sitting under a lamp? I believe this dump was even announced on TV for great prican food. This place is an embarrassment to prican food. I would never return.  I also noticed a lot of the customers are usuals that live close by (listening on the convos).  Oh and by the way one of the other biggest disappointments, I was really looking forward to eating the rum cake.....its literally yellow cake out of a box with rum on it $3 a slice.  Seriously can't even make the cake from scratch.

You can also order ""Jibarito"" Sandwiches (meat with fried plantains instead of bread.  I had the beef stew with white rice and my husband had the lechón (pork), both were delicious and flavorful. I asked for an order of fried plantains (tostones) and they were made to order (fresh, not frozen). I had a piece of vanilla flan which was ok.

The arroz con gandules was so flavorful and  soft without having an over powering taste. It was the perfect accompaniment to the chicarrones.

I've had better! I can only assume that the people who wrote the reviews either have no clue what Puerto Rican food is supposed to taste like or they know the owners. Walking in there's no clear direction as to where to go to order your food, aside from that there's no way to know how much you will be paying for the food you select so basically they can charge me whatever they feel like charging me and I wouldn't even know. The majority of the food they have under the heat lamp is dried up. Why would they sell that to their customers. When I pointed that out to the woman who I assumed was the owner or manager she said I know but it will take 20min for me to make you a fresh one (talking about the blood sausage). I bought some anyway because my daughter was insisting she wanted some and as I suspected it was dry and hard to eat. They don't seem to remove the nerves or fat from the steak so even though the flavor was tasty it was ruined by me having to pull that grossness out of my mouth. Why doesn't the woman at the steam table speak English!?!? C'mon now! It's 2014 people. Even speaking Spanish didn't help me communicate with this woman so I finally just pointed at stuff and nodded.

2013-12-23,1.0,"We had a profound and unresolved sense of being wronged, so I thought to post this review and let readers decide for themselves. $16 for a plate of food that normally costs $9-$10!?!  We entered La Palma to discover the traditional buffet-style service sitting behind the display case. Being Puerto Ricans from New York who currently live in Detroit, we have travelled extensively and eaten Puerto Rican food at many places. Never have I been charged $16 for ""mixing"" offerings from the buffet. The plate we received was also the traditional 50-75% rice, so it wasn't as if we received the ""extra meat"" on our plate we were charged for. Despite raising the issue with the cashier and making an accounting that recognized the amount we were being charged, she assured us that her numbers were correct. I didn't want to make my husband uncomfortable and spoil our meal by insisting that we had been overcharged. I wish I had... I wish we had left. We also ordered the jibarito, which paled in comparison to the glowing reviews here. Like the rest of the meal, the flavors were not bland but were unremarkable. The place caters to a diverse palate, which translates into erring on the side of reducing the ""garlicky"" flavor that characterizes Puerto Rican food. I found the jibarito tasteless, but took half of my unconsumed meal home for the dog...even he didn't want it. We were further disappointed to learn that the order for the jibarito wasn't communicated the chef, even though I had placed it over three times with the overstaffed locale that had servers, cooks and cashiers tripping over themselves. The mix-up was resolved as I waited and as my husband finished his meal, which made for a long meal with one or the other of us waiting as the other ate. My toddler didn't much appreciate the extensive wait either. In sum, we paid $26 for inadequate service, one plate of food, one jibarito, and one bottled soft drink. This price is comparable to a much more upscale restaurant, which was not appropriate for the relatively bland favors, unremarkable location, and backyard-style décor we found here.

This place vows that you will not leave hungry. Well, it was so delicious that we tested that theory by each ordering another round, this time pork.

2012-05-20,5.0,"After living on the West Coast for several years, I come to Chicago with fellow Yelper Fia R looking to get reacquainted with Puerto Rican cuisine--one of my favorites in the world. We found this fast food hole in the wall sitting in this quiet residential neighborhood. They have several parking spaces right across the street, and the place looked charming and warm as if we had just stepped into my friend Rene's kitchen.  We were quickly greeted upon entering. Once inside, there was a glass case stacked with all kinds of goodies ranging from fried fish, plantains, and mouthwatering roast pork. The cuisine doesn't just stop there. The steam table was filled with colorful dishes from sopas to stews, yuca, tamales, and more. In spite of the humble decor, the tables were decorated with colorful tablecloths, and from top to bottom there were touches of Easter to make us feel at home. The servers were extremely nice to us, especially when they learned that this was our first visit to their restaurant. There was no better place to be on that Sunday afternoon.  We started off with the Mondongo ($6), also known as the Tripe Soup. This soup is their weekend special and came with a rich combination of tripe, pigs feet, and vegetables such as onions, carrots, cabbage, celery, tomatoes, cilantro and spices. The taste of the soup had a lot of depth, enriched by the tripe, pigs feet, and naturally sweetened by the fresh cut vegetables. It came with a bowl of steamed rice, and it was so good that we left no soup behind. Next, we had the Bistec Jibarito ($5.95). This is their version of Beef Sandwich that came with well-seasoned, tender slices of beef stacked with cabbage, cheese, garlic, and mayo in between perfectly fried plantains. The flattened plantains were not noticeably greasy, which made the jibarito easy to handle. The bistec was nicely seasoned to allow the natural flavors to take center stage with a finesse hint of garlic here and there in the background. This dish also came with a sizable portion of Spanish rice that was delicious and well executed. Most reviewers had raved about their jibarito and I too, believe this is a must get.  From the glass case we got a piece of Alcapurria ($1) that was made of plantains and unripen banana filled with ground beef. We also shared a piece of Platano Maduro ($1.95) where the ripe plantain was sweet, buttery, and sinfully delicious.

Taking a bite out of that jibarito steak sandwich felt like something out of a time machine that we weren't allowed to build but hacked into anyway.  It might be second-nature to Puerto Ricans in Chicago, but this Bronx-born Puerto Rican was enamored and mesmerized by the ingenuity of using tostones instead of bread for a steak sandwich. Then the rice and beans...beyond belief how La Palma made me realize how much my birthplace of the Bronx has sold out and gave up on good Puerto Rican food.  I haven't had good Puerto Rican food like this since I was a shorty, no question.

La Palma's is the kind of place you envision in a crowded marketplace in Puerto Rico: complete indifference to comfort and design (meals are served cafeteria-style), offset by a rich variety of some of the best-loved Boricuan comfort food.  A quick glance around the restaurant will show that a lot of people go for the arroz con gandules, lechon and pasteles. Knowing how labor-intensive it is to cook pasteles (I used to help my grandmother make them for special occasions back home in Hawai'i), I immediately seized upon the last two pieces, as if rationing for supplies during a hurricane. These were full-bodied pasteles, seasoned perfectly with achiote and stuffed with tender strips of pork.  Though not a big fan of bacon, I tried a serving of carne frita, which was well proportioned with meat and fat, minimally spiced, and succulent with moisture. I finished my meal with some papas rellenos, or meat-filled potato dumplings, which were slightly overdone on the inside (though I would've probably loved it if I hadn't first experimented with the carne frita).   Alas, my feast had to come to an end.
