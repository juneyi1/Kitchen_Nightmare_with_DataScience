We were seated immediately, and got our pizza ridiculously fast after ordering it! The reason the pizzas can come out so fast is that they are baked in a coal fire oven. The thin dough get charred and delicious in just a few short minutes. Their differentiator is the dollops of whipped ricotta that they put on top of the pizza once it's out of the oven. This pizza is really delicious and the ricotta adds a nice creaminess and interesting texture combo to the top. We both really liked the pepperoni and whipped ricotta pizza we ordered and would definitely come back. This pizza isn't piled high with toppings and cheese like some other pizza places, but the charred dough, thick cut pepperoni, and whipped ricotta make this a strong contender in Chicago's super competitive pizza scene.",0.9731,0.758,0.192,0.05,0.6161904761904761

My only complaint is that there was a bunch of oil on the table under the condiments. blech. I wish they had apps on their menu (I only saw salad, which IMO just doesn't qualify). We went straight for the pizza: the White, which was my favorite in NYC. It was pretty good: I loved the fresh basil leaves. There were HUGE dollops of ricotta.. maybe too huge? You really have to eat the white while it's piping hot, or else the taste and texture are kind of ""meh."" I don't think we'd get the White again in the future, but am glad we tried it anyway.

2017-02-15,5.0,"It can be hard to predict on any given day if there will be a wait here, but don't be surprised if there's a wait on weekends and at night, especially for parties of more than 4 people. The drink menu contains a good variety of beers, especially for a pizzeria (pizza pubs don't count!). The house salad is standard, but I would recommend getting the Caesar salad which goes along with the pizza better. The salads are priced around $9 +/-, while the pies range from $17 to $20. The pizzas are very tasty and are LOADED with whatever toppings you order. They come out of an 800° oven, so of course they're too hot to touch right away but the pies cool down quickly thanks to the thinness of the crust. The thin crust also helps the cheese, sauce, and toppings to really shine. Just know that depending on the toppings, you may find some of the pizzas to be a bit salty - in my case it was the sausage stracciatella. This put me on the fence on whether or not to subtract one star from the rating, but on second thought I do appreciate the place being generous with their toppings, especially considering that the pies are on the pricier side. Thus I am giving Coalfire 4.5 out of 5 stars, which rounds up to 5 stars. Note that according to the menu, one pie is recommended to feed two people, but I believe that this recommendation was made based on the assumption that you will also order some salad and dessert.

2016-11-28,5.0,I take my thin crust pizza pretty seriously. I was beginning to think a good slice of thin crust was beginning to be a myth in Chicago. Until my boyfriend suggested going to Coalfire. I read a few reviews and saw some pictures and it totally won me over. I cam in with high expectations.  They have a selection of a few wine bottles for a great price and they repurpose their tomato cans into wine chillers and pie holders (very adorable). We ordered the lasagna pizza because reading the reviews I saw we had to order something with the whipped ricotta. Believe me you NEED to order a pizza with the whipped ricotta or at least have it as an add on it's unbelievable! It definitely elevates the pizza. The pie was cooked perfectly as well. I'm usually not the type to eat meat on my pizza but my boyfriend and I loved it so much. We can't wait to go back to get another kind of pie! The prices for their bottles of wine are also exceptional. This won't break the bank. I came in a little late on a Friday but it wasn't crazy busy at all there were still a few seats. The waiters are super nice as well! This place will probably be my go to pizza in Chicago!,0.9859,0.837,0.157,0.006,0.6186904761904762

Very light and crispy homemade croutons on the salad.  Pizza was very ""clean""--simple and you could savor all the ingredients!  The down side...no iced tea for hubby, so he had to get root beer.  They put the dressing on top of the caesar salad, so a lot of the lettuce below doesn't get enough dressing, and it is heaping in the bowl, so it is impossible to toss it.  If they tossed the dressing with the lettuce before serving, and then topped it with the cheese and croutons, it would be perfecto.  Lastly, parking was a bear.  Even on a Friday off-peak for lunch, we drove around a bunch of times to find a parking spot.  Next time we will shoot for arriving around opening time for lunch and maybe we will have better luck getting a parking space on the street.",0.893,0.857,0.102,0.041,0.5860582010582011

You won't fine that here.  If you're looking for a bargain, hit up your local chained pizza restaurant. Ain't nothing wrong with that....I love me some Pizza Hut every now and then--most likely when I'm starving at Target or need a quick pizza delivery during desperate times. Coalfire is different.  It's supreme quality ingredients that also comes at a price, but well worth it in my opinion.  Due to the nature of its paper thin crust, it doesn't take them that long to make.  I wish I could say that I've tried all of their pizzas--it's still on my short list of things to do, but it's hard when you have a favorite and you can expect them to nail it to perfection every time.  I strongly recommend the only ones that I've tried which are the Honey & Salami as well as the Stracciatella & Sausage.  Both of these pies master the sweet and savory balance that is hard to achieve, and they picked just the right ingredients for it. By the way, Stracciatella is a cheese--it's soft, sweet, and velvetty.  If Burrata and Ricotta married each other, it would give you stracciatella.  It's awesome.  But yeah, I thought it was some kind of meat....ignorant me. While you're at it, if you feel bad about your decision, which you definitely shouldn't because their pizzas are thin and healthier than your usual, I recommend the Caprese Salad. Once again, the Stracciatella cheese is an ingredient.  Imagine dipping your fresh tomatoes in that cheese drizzled with sweet balsamic vinegar.  I don't even like tomatoes and I can devour an entire order.",0.9942,0.754,0.196,0.051,0.6043436293436293

The location is slightly off the main attractions of the West Loop. The interior is extremely dimly lit, as if only the romantic couples are welcomed. However the staffs were extremely welcoming and you don't feel alienated.  The Center of attraction is the Oven, fueled by coal. Open concept kitchen ensures that you get a glimpse on what is going on with your pizza.  We ordered a vodka meatball pizza and a caprese salad. Oh my good, it is the the best caprese that I ever had. They used ricotta and mozzarella blend topped with balsamic vinaigrette instead of the regular fresh mozzarella. That made the huge difference.  The pizza, well it was good. The crust was on point, with enough crustiness to give that loud bite, yet doughy enough to have a longer chew. And of course it has charred bits as with any wood fired oven made pizzas. However, it failed the lift test. When you lift the pizza from the crusty end, the pizza should fold just enough to keep the cheese and sauce intact. This crust was too thin to do that.  The sauce was good, but it lacked  some salt. May be I should have gone for a regular tomato sauce instead of the vodka sauce. The cheese was good as it morphed into cheese strings at the end of the bite. The meat ball was slightly dry and lacked some salt. Overall the pizza was good.

Amazing in their simplicity, these thin crust pizzas have it all: great thin crust pizza, tangy tomato sauce, fresh and perfectly paired toppings. No classic American pizzas here, these are more traditional Italian pizzas, where the simple white pizza and Margherita steal the show. You must have the whipped ricotta. It is simply divine.

The party was all the way in Lincoln Park, so Coalfire isn't a frequent destination for my friend, it's not that typical Chicago deep dish that you normally think of bringing (thank god), and really, what is the chance of two people bringing a pizza from the same place? Apparently, greater than I thought since I wasn't the only one who brought a Coalfire pizza. But both the pizzas were so good that I'm glad we had two from such an awesome place. The pizzas here are amazing and so reasonably priced. I've both dined in and taken out, and the pizzas are stellar regardless which option you choose.

The Stracciatella & Sausage pizza packs in a lot of heat and spice so WARNING for you faint of the heart. But the combination of that sausage and chile is so delicious. It's my absolute favorite.

So I walked in on a Saturday afternoon A's the restaurant was maybe half full. I was seated promptly and promptly got a glass of ice water. However, they also told me there was no iced tea. That's a major disappointment for me. Even though I didn't plan on drinking, I knew I wasn't having dogs, so I asked for a beer suggestion. The waitress came back with a bottle of rogue dead guy ale from Oregon. It was a nice medium bodied, golden color beer. Definitely a good recommendation. I ordered the sausage and straciella, which had Berkshire sausage, red onion, Calabrian chiles, fresh basil, two kinds of mozzarella, and a little tomato sauce. For $19, it was about sixteen inches in diameter. I like my pizzas with a good sauce flavor, but I don't like them soggy and wet on the bottom. That's a fine line to walk. The crust was definitely crispy all the way through, a definite plus. When I bit into it, the crust had that smoky flavor that I love in my pizzas. The sausage was an incredible quality, great spice and flavor in it. But I could've used just a little more sauce especially with the extra cheese and the peppers. That would probably be my only criticism.  The total was $27 for a large pizza, beer, and tax. Not too bad for Chicago.

My boyfriend and I always split one pizza for dinner and usually end up with 1 or two extra slices. My absolute favorite pizza is their White Pizza ($16) with mozzarella, whipped ricotta, oregano, garlic, etc. The Lasagna Pizza ($18) is also pretty great. It's topped with fresh mozzarella, sauce, sausage, whipped ricotta, etc.  I didn't particularly care for the 'Nduja & Béchamel ($19) pizza, made with béchamel, 'nduja (a sausage of sorts), and mozzarella, but it certainly wasn't bad. We once tried a calzone and would definitely stick to the pizzas from now on.  Overall, very solid pizza choice.

2015-08-20,4.0,"I've been wanting to try Coalfire for a really long time so I was pumped to finally go -- photos of the gorgeous ricotta/ pepperoni pizza pop up all over social media and I had to try it myself. We arrived at coalfire around 8/830 on a Wednesday and it was busy but we got a table immediately. It's definitely a small restaurant and I can see how it'd be busier during the dinner rush.  The restaurant itself is dark but not unwelcoming. The beer selection is pretty decent - they have a solid variety of beers.  I ordered a Leffe and my friend ordered a Fixed Gear Red Ale, and our waitress brought out pint glasses.  Both beers were good and definitely went well with pizza.  For dinner, we ordered the pepperoni ricotta pizza to split.  Here's my honest opinion: on its own, the pizza is not truly very special.  That isn't to say that it's not good -- it's hard to find a truly crispy thin crust pizza around here and coalfire definitely succeeds in that aspect.  The pizza is charred (as it should be) and thin and crunchy.  However, I found the cheese and sauce on it to be so boring -- I barely noticed them.  They lacked flavor and they weren't very present on the pizza.  If not for the excellent toppings of pep and ricotta, I probably would have liked the pizza a lot less.  the pepperoni is thick and small and packed on to the pizza- they're definitely not stingy with it.  It's also flavorful and spicy and very delicious.  The whipped ricotta is so excellent - not only is it pretty, but it's infused with flavor and super mouthwateringly delicious.  We spread it across our pizza and enjoyed every bite of the creamy ricotta (cold, but still good). The service was good and quick - maybe a little too quick, really.  I felt the whole time like our waitress was rushing though the meal, giving us very little time to sit and chill.  However, she was super nice and we enjoyed our time at Coalfire.",0.9978,0.708,0.238,0.055,0.6028571428571429

Our server was nice compared to the frazzled hostess who was all over the place. There is no place to wait except outside, and there is no bar to grab a drink during the wait, which I have to admit the wait wasn't as bad as it looked when we first arrived.  There are ""rules"" on the menu like....no substitutions, no halves (which I'm not sure if that was only for the specialty pizzas?), only one credit card per table.... Thought that was weird...? I mean if we were splitting the tab down the middle with two cards, that should be okay I think. I've been a server and that doesn't take much time at all. I could see if a table gave you 8 cards and wanted only certain items on each card, NOW that is obnoxious haha!

I may be the only person on the face of the earth who's not really a fan of the whipped ricotta so I asked to remove it and they refused citing that ""the chef is really particular about his pizzas"" which I can appreciate except that it CLEARLY says at the top of the menu ""No Halves or Substitutions, Deletions only"". So I really don't see what the big deal was. The pizza itself was great (I wound up scraping the ricotta off -___- ).",0.9018,0.846,0.101,0.052,0.4486484848484848

The restaurant was not even crowded and we kept getting pressured to order. The pizza comes out in 3 min due to the temp on the over. The waitstaff will clear up plates the second your last bite is gone. They don't wait for everyone to finish eating either. I was even presented with the bill before I was finished with the last slice. We were going to order another round of drinks but felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant.

The meat calzone was overcooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside. Maybe the oven is too hot for the calzone to cook fully.  We returned the calzone and got a plain cheese and pepperoni pizza. It was OK. My preference with pizza is to have pepperoni and sauce underneath the cheese. When pepperoni is on the very top, the edges become overcrisp. There was almost no sauce on the pizza. I think I have to chalk it up to this style of pizza just not being my thing. The apple and endive salad was really good. It had walnuts, bleu cheese and something that looked like faro. We ended with the s'mores cupcake and turtle cupcake.

However, what really impressed me about this place is the service. The waiter and waitress we have had made good conversation at the table without being overbearing, were very knowledgable, and made great recommendations.  The first time we went to Coalfire was in February, and they were pretty busy so we had to wait outside. They have big heatlamps, so it wasn't too bad to stand outside, and they made sure to get us inside as soon as possible. The first table they had available was in front of the door, so they asked if that was okay before seating us there. We said it was fine, and the manager and servers made sure to swiftly close the door every single time someone opened it so that we would stay warm. They did a great job and were very conscious of it throughout the night. We stayed warm and comfortable for our whole meal. The manager felt bad for seating us by the door (even though we really didn't think it was a big deal), so he gave us a free cupcake to take home with us. We didn't expect it at all, so it was a really nice gesture. I pay a lot of attention to the service whenever I go somewhere, and this is some of the best service I have had. Way to go, Coalfire!

I've been meaning to go back but never got the umph to go until this week. Given I did move in about 3 doors down from Coalfire...I saw it as a prime opportunity to give it a shot. Got the IGed Pepperoni pie with whipped ricotta....and that's all she wrote......  I dunno what they changed but Coalfire is churning out some top notch pies....the crust is nice and thin with the outer crust being charred and chewy...my favorite. The pepperonis are nice and thick with some bite/spice to them which reminds me of pepperoni in NY that actually has some meat to it vs. a razor thin slice. The whipped ricotta is another layer of flavor that adds to their excellent pie.  Moving in 3 doors down was a baaaaaad choice.....for my health.,0.9867,0.82,0.18,0.0,0.6021923783287421

When you have a hankering for a slice, you don't want a pie. You want a pizza. But alas, I digress. Coalfire was a bit of a trek for me from where I live, but it was absolutely worth it. I got the Cremini Pizza which was pretty good. My only criticism would be to cut the mushrooms a little smaller than quarters so it provides better weight distribution across the very thin crust. The taste was great with the arugula, garlic oil, and cheese, but the mushrooms were not small enough in my opinion.

2015-03-05,5.0,Okay so I feel like I've neglected coal fire  :( it's soooo close to me and I've been only like two times. I've had their pizza so many more times but I should order from them.  But I kinda feel like they should deliver.. Anyways no excuse AMAZING  Pizza is AMAZING. And it should be worth the pick up. Don't mind my laziness.  They're pizza ais not your typical doughy type. It's a reall thin crust baked TO A perfect crisp. They're sauces are so good too.  I really love the one with arugula and goat cheese I think that is what it was ... I haven't had a combination I haven't liked.  The service is Friendly! Always willing to explain the menu. And the owner is awesome! oooo they've also linked up with chicago cupcakes..  You've got to try the red velvet one...  All being said I can't wait to dine it again.. Or at least redeem myself as a local and order and pick up to dine at home.,0.9935,0.692,0.256,0.051,0.5848484848484848

2015-03-03,3.0,"I've been wanting to try Coalfire for a while now as it's been on my bookmarked list since I've seen some of my food bloggers instagram the holey moley of this pizza place so I knew I had to try it. We got here around 7:30pm on a Saturday night and there was a huge line out the door, so I'm thinking okay, this is expected since it's so popular so they took our name and number and sent us to the bar next door and quoted us about 30-40 minute wait. The bar was fun, drinks were super tasty and it wasn't as hectic or loud so I got some convos in with our friends. They called us about a half an hour later and we walked back to the place. We got sat in the middle of the restaurant and it was so freaking loud. I mean, I eat out a lot and have tried many places that are on the loud side in Chicago, but I literally had to scream over the table to get a word in and could barely hear my friends. So at this point, the atmosphere just doesn't do it for me.  Now onto the pizzas, they look phenomenal. We ordered the pepperoni with the ricotta as well as the white pizza without all the sauce which also came with the ricotta. I took a bite and the ricotta was super cold. I was like oh no they didn't. If I'm going to bite into a hot crispy pizza, why does the ricotta have to be cold. That just ruined it for me as I was hoping it would be warm but if people like that, who is to argue with taste, well okay, I'll argue with taste. Ricotta cheese should be hot and gooey on top of hot pizza, not cold. The pepperoni however, was super spicy and had a lot of flavor and the pizza itself was yummy. I would only order take out if I'm in the area because I didn't like the service as they basically rush you out the door to get more people in. I guess that's how their business works but I'm not a fan of that. We ate our food, they cleared our plates while there was still pizza on the table. Maybe, just maybe we weren't finished yet. So overall, the pizza minus the cold ricotta was good, but the super loud atmosphere and the rushed service didn't do it for me.

We had a Ceasar Salad - it came out lightening fast... for real.  Nothing special - but it was shareable and a nice Parmesan to lettuce ratio and the dressing was good We tried a white pie, a sausage, ricotta and basil pie and for dessert the meat pie.  they were all very good- the sausage was delish - the ricotta so fluffy! and Salami on the meat pie - I've never had but it was cooked nice and crispy that it had a great flavor and made me a fan Being from Connecticut and from the womb raised on Pepe's Pizza (coal oven) I put the pizza to the test... cut like a pie - check, fold ability - check, good cheese to crust ratio - checkety check; crust cooked so there is enough bend but not too crisp - yes on 2 not on the first - but hey that's the nature of cooking over coal.  Overall really good - $17 for a pie was a bit pricey but I went with 8 very hungry people (6 big eating guys and two women) and the 3 pies and 1 salad was enough and cost us $17.50 a person  DRAT that I didnt get a cupcake! Service was friendly and efficient - we did not feel rushed but were prepared to eat and leave if they were busy -  they weren't in need of our table so we lingered a bit.

It's a sweet and savory dish with savory salami. 3) Sausage and onion- so good! I'm not a fan of purple onion but it works so well in this pizza.

The desert cupcakes are amazing! They are brought in from a local cupcake shop and are so good. I've tried them all and can say they are all delicious. If you love peanut butter try the peanut butter cup cupcake; it has an entire peanut butter cup backed inside. The service is pleasant and friendly.

He got back to me to say that it was the first time he had a pizza in Chicago that tasted like the same crust he'd eaten in Italy. Their pizzas come to your table pretty quickly, bubbly hot.

For our second pizza we built our own. We ordered goat cheese, red onions and spinach but accidentally got whipped ricotta instead of goat cheese. This mistake was a great discovery instead. Coal fire pizza known for their fresh whipped ricotta could not have had it any other way I suppose.

2014-11-23,5.0,"My friends and I decided to begin our highly anticipated meal with the house salad. Like most house salads, the salad featured romaine lettuce with tomatoes, mushrooms and onions with a house oil and vinegar dressing. We requested dressing and onions on the side. Our salad arrived promptly and I was pleasantly surprised with how good such a simple salad could taste. All the ingredients were bursting with freshness and had just the proper crunch. The dressing was tangy, light, and simplistic; it complemented the freshness from the local and organic romaine lettuce superbly.            We finally decided on the white pizza (adding on italian sausage) and the 'Nduja.The white pizza arrived first and wastruly looked just as good as it tasted. It was speckled with small but many pieces of Italian sausage, with large basil leaves and a dollop of ricotta cheese on each individual slice. As soon as the pizza arrived my friends and I, like savages, ripped our slices apart from the pizza and took that highly anticipated first bite. The white pizza was truly the perfect combination of the rich ricotta, slightly sweet mozzarella, the robust aromatic flavor of the basil, and the meatiness of the sausage. The small bits of sausage had just enough meatiness to balance the delicate flavors of the minimal ingredients in the pizza. Unlike some thin crust experiences I've had in the past, the crust had the perfect texture in between soggy and way too crunchy. Along with this chewiness yet crispiness in the bottom of the pizza, the garlic olive oil was mild yet complimented the existing flavors immensely by tying the richness of the pizza all together. The pizza curst it self was bubbly, slightly charred and just a little crunchy. Needless to say we were in pizza bliss.          Just as we finished our first slice, the infamous 'Nduja had arrived. The reviews online made this sound like it was the end all be all of thin crust pizzas, so I was excited and had extremely high expectations for it. Unlike the white pizza, this 'Nduja wasn't as appealing/interesting to the eye, in fact it really just looked like a plain thin crust pepperoni pizza with sliced basil thrown on top. However, after I took my first bite I can say that this pizza had changed any judgment I had passed at first glance. The Calabrian salami was fatty and slightly puffed on top of the pizza making it far superior to any piece of pepperoni. The red sauce itself was tangy and sweet yet rich clearly illustrating the careful and artistic blend of flavors. The Calabrian salami was spicy with a hint of sweetness that brought out the similar tones of sweetness in the sauce. The basil's sweet and strong notes cut the potential heaviness from the salami and mozzarella but also accented the existing flavors. Again, the crust was superb and was the only crust that could do either of these pizzas justice. Usually in a thin crust pizza, the sauce and toppings are main focus and the crust itself comes secondary, but at Coalfire the crust is what helps make the pizza the quality it is.       As we left, the owner opened the door for us and waved us goodbye as he told us to come back soon. Coalfire is a bright addition to the up and coming environment of West Town, and I can't wait to come back.",0.9989,0.796,0.193,0.011,0.520563909774436

The calzone comes with a ton of ricotta, mozzarella, red onions, and thinly sliced red peppers. It is served with a smokey roasted tomato sauce. I thought this sauce was really interesting as I don't have a ton of roasted tomato sauce (unless it's in a salsa). The calzone is HUGE. We only ate 1/3 of it because it was so large. The pizza was absolutely delicious but the crusts were a little burned. The sausage is more crumbled versus large chunks. I didn't really notice the onion or garlic on the pizza to be honest. I wish they put more of each into the pizza so it didn't feel like it was all sausage and cheese. My fiance thought the sausage was a bit stringy/fatty, but I thoroughly enjoyed the sausage/fennel combination. We had a lot of leftovers since the pizza comes in one size and it is quite large for two people.  I added more red onions and jalapenos to the leftovers, just to give it more of a crunch and some heat, which I thought was more delicious than the first round.

2014-09-15,5.0,"This. This, is the authentic pizza place that all others aspire to be. First off though, I have to come clean and say that when I looked it up on Yelp, and checked out their website, I was a bit turned off by the militant feel of it all. ""No more than three toppings!"", ""Only one vegetable!"", and ""You may be asked to leave your table when you are done!"" all evoked memories of sitcom soup Nazis.  This was further reinforced when we got there and the friendly ""sit anywhere"", turned in to a gruff ""except there"", as I pulled out a chair at a larger table. My first impressions were so totally off base though that I started to feel guilty for thinking of this place as anything but the most wonderfully warm and inviting establishment that it is! The wait staff was phenomenal. Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and the entire crew made our lunch time an awesome experience. I also need to give a special shout out to Dave. Dave is one of the owners and took a little bit of prideful offense that the friend I was with ordered the whipped Ricotta, ""on the side"". You see, my friend is not only smart, pretty, and Italian, but she knows her Neapolitan pizza and was a bit leary of ""whipped Ricotta"". Dave came over to our table to coach us on the proper way to apply the Ricotta to our pizza as to maximize the flavor potential of the combination. Obviously the perfectionsist in him could not stand us bastardizing his craft, so, the next thing we know, Dave is bringing us an entire SECOND PIZZA just so we can experience it the correct way!  After we gorged ourselves on this wonderous meal, we happened to catch Dave outside and had some awesome pizza conversation while we waited to hail a cab!

2014-08-29,2.0,"This will probably not go over well over here on Yelp, but I've got to call it the way I see it from the perspective of a Chicagoan.  I'm not going to just sit here and  randomly put out there that Chicago style thin crust pizza, cut into squares with homemade Italian sausage is better than thin crust pizzas from out East (i.e. NYC and New Haven)  for no reason.  I'm more than happy to explain my reasoning, and the following paragraphs will accomplish just that.   If you're looking for good coalfired oven pizza in the heritage of the coalfire classics in NYC and New Haven, then you will not be disappointed.  Coalfire makes very good plain cheese pizza, especially if you upgrade to the fresh mozzarella for the extra money.  The crust is slightly charred and bubbly, which is a result of Coalfire's clean burning coal oven which cooks at 800 degrees.  And if you like Nduja (pronounced ""N-Do-Ya""),  which is a spicy and spreadable Calabrian salami, then you'll like this pizza as well.  It's very good.  With these positive points, I can see why many East Coast transplants from NYC and New Haven seek out Coalfire on a regular basis.  I told Coalfire's owner that his pizza reminded me of Totonno's in NYC, and he very much agreed.    But that's where it ends.  As a Chicagoan, I've NEVER had even mediocre sausage, let alone good, or even great sausage, on a thin crust pizza from NYC or New Haven.  For whatever reason, East Coast pizza styles ALWAYS fail when it comes to sausage pizza.  And Coalfire's version of sausage pizza is no different- it's bad.  I'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.  If you're like me, and you're use to eating excellent sausage pizzas from Chicagoland legends (both deep dish and thin crust)  like the original Pizzeria Uno/Due, Lou Malnati's, Pizano's, Pat's on Lincoln Ave., Vito and Nick's, Aurelio's, Armand's, Q's in Hillside, Louisa's in Crestwood, and Villa Nova in Stickney, then you know what great pizza sausage is, and you can immediately call out bad pizza sausage when you see it.  When you grow up with these Chicago sausage gold standards, you will judge all other sausage pizzas by these standards.  It's unavoidable.   And Coalfire's sausage is pretty darn bad.  It's crumbled into these little chunks, and it's very bland- VERY BLAND.  It's bland to the point where there seems to be no garlic what-so-ever, or even any recognizable black pepper.  There's so fennel, but even their fennel is not very good.  For the life of me, I just can't understand why East Coast pizzas are so lacking in good quality Italian sausage for their pizza recipes.  It was just bad.  I wish I could say otherwise, but I just can't.  Endgame.   As for Coalfire's crust, yes it's slightly charred and bubbly, but it was still pretty foldable, and quite soggy in the middle.  The sogginess in the middle of the crust doesn't bother me that much, because Chicago style pizzas, both thin crust and deep dish, also often get soggy in the middle due to the weight of the toppings here in Chicago.  But what does bother me is the actual taste of Coalfire's crust.  I know food critics/snobs of all kinds love Coalfire's charred outer crust but, to me, that same crust that all the snooty food critics love simply tastes burnt to me.  But what the hell do I know- I'm just a normal, blue collar guy who has very simple tastes.  But what I do know is that I'll gladly eat a very tasty buttercrust thin crust or deep dish pizza from Lou Malnati's or Pizano's any day of the week over the charred, burnt end crust at Coalfire and every other coalfired oven pizzas from out East.  The buttercrust from either Lou Malnati's or Pizano's is far better on every imaginable taste level.  Or I'll take a simple cracker thin crust, cut into squares, with some simple corn meal on the bottom from Q's in Hillside, too.  In the end, all these snooty food writers in the media can go on and on about the ""charred goodness""  of coalfired oven pizzas, but anyone who grew up here in Chicago knows that both our deep dish and thin crust pizzas from all of the above mentioned Chicago classics offer far superior pizzs crusts in terms of simple taste.  And taste is all that should matter.   I know East Coast people will always deny this, but these are the very obvious reasons why Chicago style pizza, both thin crust and deep dish, will always be the best pizza in the world.  Nothing compares to Chicago style pizza, both thin crust and deep dish, when it comes to sausage pizza, and NOTHING ever will.  Similarly, our crusts are better, and far more tasty, too.  Just because our pizzas here in Chicago are not made in coalfire ovens, doesn't make them any less better in terms of quality.  Our pizza crusts STILL taste better at all of the above mentioned Chicagoland generational legends.   However,  if you're looking for a taste of home from NYC or New Haven and good service, then head to Coalfire right now.",0.9987,0.786,0.155,0.059,0.5362566439970285

My idea of a great pizza is a thin, slightly charred crust, with flavorful toppings spread thinly enough that they don't make the crust soggy. That's exactly what you'll find here. Normally I tend to order vegetarian pizzas, but the way to go at coal fire is with the pepperoni and whipped ricotta pizza. The pepperoni is thick cut, so it has tons of flavor, and the fluffy cheese adds a great creamy finish.

2014-07-27,3.0,"I really like Neopolitan-style pizza. My partner has a serious jones for it. Surprisingly, we had not been to Coalfire before now, but we happily rectified that oversight. We agreed that the staff was uniformly congenial and helpful. We were split in our opinions about the pizza (I give it a 4, she maybe a 3), but were on the same page regarding ambiance & convenience: meh... First, the food. The menu is minimalist: salad, pizza, calzone, cupcakes, beer, wine, soft drinks. Focused and easy to deal with. We liked a huge Caesar salad: it was fresh and perky. A margherita pizza drew a split decision: I thought it had good flavor, she was unimpressed. (Note: standard basil dose on the margherita is 5 leaves, but they will give you more if you ask.) The pizza is saucier than other Neopolitan or Roman style pizzas we've sampled, and it had more mozzarella -- attention must be paid to avoid ooze & splatter if you eat the slices like a native, folded. Cupcakes do not delight us, so we passed. There are nice compact selections of wine & beer at fair prices, a plus. So golly, what's this about ambiance & convenience? Well, the ambiance doesn't do it for either of us because it's VERY LOUD! We could not converse. And convenience refers to the no-reservations policy. I suppose some people like to stand around on the sidewalk waiting for a table (even on a weeknight), but I'd rather reserve, thanks. The waiting is a minor point; the noise is a deal-breaker. By comparison, Spacca Napoli, our fave Neopolitan pizzeria, does take reservations, and though it is noisier than we prefer, still allows rudimentary conversation without shouting. And we like Spacca's pizza better: more choices, more nuanced flavors -- and they have a selection of Neopolitan appetizers, too. Maybe it's a generational things: Spacca is Boomer, Coalfire is Millennial? Whatever. We'll be at Spacca Napoli for our Neopolitan fix whenever possible...",0.9955,0.782,0.187,0.031,0.5593333333333333

I was at Coalfire Pizza last night for a birthday party--and everything from the friendly accommodations and easy-going attitude to absolutely delish and tasty thin crust is above and beyond what I would expect.

2014-04-08,4.0,"I've been coming to Coalfire for a few years for a reason - the food and service is top notch. However, I have to say I was a little disappointed by what happened the last time I was there.  Our server was awesome, as they usually are - friendly, thoughtful, etc. On this particular night, there was a group of cops who wanted to eat. I could tell the host was getting a little frazzled because it was a full house and not a spare table in sight, especially for 8 people. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing but the most absolute respect for cops, firefighters, military, etc. which is the reason why I can understand this host's frazzled demeanor  to get them seated pronto.  I saw him ask a table that was just about to ask for their pizza to be wrapped up if they would please move to one of the newly empty tables. Since they were getting ready to go, they didn't seem to mind and got up to wait for their check at another table. The host pushed together a few other tables and the cops were seated. My server was just about to ask us if we needed anything else and as my boyfriend started to ask about their cupcakes (which get the peanut butter one!), this host came and poked her in the back as in, stop serving these guys and get a move on to the cop table. She disregarded it since she was in the middle of a conversation with us, but once again, the host walked by and poked her again. She smiled at us and said, sorry, then moved on to the table of cops. ""What just happened?"" my boyfriend asked, so I explained. Again, I am ALL FOR first class service for those who serve us, but I did find the host's behavior a little rude for interrupting our server trying to serve us in the middle of a conversation - and not just once, but twice. The funny thing is, my boyfriend is in the military. I had to wonder if he was in uniform, would our service have been different. I wanted so badly to tell that host my boyfriend was in the military but didn't want any special treatment, especially if it was interrupting service from another paying customer. Luckily our super sweet server came by and apologized profusely for what had happened and gave us a free cupcake to make up for it.

It definitely wasn't on the same level as Grimaldi's in NYC but it was decent. Unfortunately, the pizzas didn't have much flavor. The white pie was pretty boring and the only thing that saved the 'Nduja pie was the spicy salami.  On a side note, we also tried their cupcakes (courtesy of Chicago Cupcake).

We had just came from lunch a few hours ago, but my brother and buddy  have bottomless pits and I've been wanting to try this place so since we were close by we stopped in. Our waiter Jeff was very friendly and informative. I had an idea of what we were going to order, but he gave us the rundown on their most popular pizzas and their special. We ultimately decided on the Margherita and the Pepperoni and Ricotta. First came the Pepperoni and Ricotta, I have to say I am not a big pepperoni person, but this pizza would be the one to convert me. I loved the flavor and crispness of the pepperoni and the soft, creaminess of the ricotta. Definitely a 5/5. Next came the Margherita and I have to say I was impressed, it wasn't as excited as the pepperoni, but I definitely wanted to give a try of the ""base experience"" and to our waiter's recommendation I stole some of the ricotta from the pepperoni one to put on a slice of the Margherita and I loved it. To my surprise the pizzas were vanishing before my eyes and my girlfriend, who is normally a light eater and had mentioned still being full before coming in, had her fair share of the pepperoni. So I think it is safe to say we'll be back again when we can. My one criticism is that, while the crust on both pizzas was pretty well cooked and had a nice bit of crunch AND chewiness to it, I would have preferred a more ""well done"" crust, but that is just my personal preference. Anyways, can't wait to come back! I hope next time they have a bacon special as one of the other reviewers mentioned trying one. edit: Came back a second time and got to meet the owner, what a nice guy!

Our pick was first, and we chose Coalfire Pizza for the first official club meeting after seeing it on Check Please! Chicago. Coalfire, as mentioned in the other reviews is a Neapolitan style pizza, so don't come here if you are looking for a deep dish, one piece is a meal kinda pizza. We were a group of 8.5 (we have an official baby mascot of the CPC), and they were more than accommodating to get us set up pretty quickly. We ordered a few of the pizzas off the menu, and were delighted with each one. Our token pregnant member of the pizza club was very happy with the speed of which the pizzas are cooked, as she was starving and the first pizza came out within minutes of ordering.

2014-02-24,5.0,"After hearing so many friends praise Coalfire Pizza I finally made it in this past weekend. Coalfire is the real deal; this was definitely some of the better pizza I have consumed - and I certainly have devoured my share.  Coalfire features Neapolitan style pizza, nicely charred and cooked to perfection in their coal fueled ovens. Very high quality ingredients are sourced and this shows. Such a wonderful combination of textures and flavors coating your taste buds. The menu features several different combinations ranging from $15 to $20 or you can choose your own toppings (these people really know what you are doing so I would encourage you to resist creating your own pie and trust what is already on the menu). I found the prices quite reasonable for the quality; definitely a few bucks more than the pizza chains but the quality is light years ahead. There are also calzones, salads and cupcakes (sourced from Chicago Cupcake) as well as a nice selection of beers, some wines and n/a beverages - but Coalfire is definitely about the pizza. The pies come in one size; eight largish thin crust slices. I agree with the menu's advice of ordering one pie per two in your party. Since the crust is thin, the pizzas come out fairly quickly. This is the kind of pizza that is best enjoyed fresh from the oven, so if all possible dine in or at least consume your pie ASAP.  The ambiance is very casual/no thrills but is comfortable and our server was prompt, attentive and efficient. Coalfire does not take reservations, so you might have a bit of a wait if you do not arrive early, but it is well worth the wait. Fortunately Coalfire is safely a few miles from my abode or else I would be shopping for larger clothes in the near future.",0.997,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.5670348432055747

We don't linger, but nor do we want our meal to be over in less than 30 minutes. I understand their restaurant was small and they need to turn tables, but this was nuts!  After we got a table, the waitress came by twice within a few minutes to take our order, so we quickly picked a salad (Caesar) and pizza (N'duja). The salad showed up a couple minutes later and the pizza showed up less than 10 minutes after that. The waitress asked us if we wanted to box up our leftovers whenever we took even the shortest pause from eating. So much for enjoying a glass of wine and conversation! We felt incredibly rushed. The pizza was pretty good and I would order it again, but, based on our experience, I think this is definitely a better option for week night dining or take-out and not weekend.  The Caesar salad was below par, chopped lettuce (not Romaine, looked like iceburg) swimming in italian dressing rather than Caesar and doused with cheese.

In order to truly appreciate what is going on here is to appreciate what pizza should be.  It should (in my opinion) be imperfect, cooked to the verge of burning in an oven of coal or wood. It should be cooked quickly, it should be thin and the crust must hold the toppings.  All these things come together in an atmosphere of friendly service, caring management and efficiency. These things all remind me of pizza in this place called Naples. (not Florida) I have worked my way completely through the menu over the past 9 months. The Nduja is the piece de resistance! A soft spreadable spicy fatty sausage of Calabrian origins, when this comes spread it out over your pie.  I have found this technique the best way to eat this pizza. Proscuitto is great, The mortadella is mind blowing, one of my favorite pizza's of all time. Sausage is great, although I do prefer a bigger bite of meat. The Caesar salad is as good as anywhere.  Decent selection of beer.

2013-10-25,4.0,"Walked in at 6:40 on a Thursday night with no reservations.  Insane idea right?  Well my parents have never had Neapolitan style pizza, so we decided to take them on a ""tour"" of a few pizzas in the city starting with Coalfire. Coalfire markets itself as the American spin on Neapolitan pizza, and rightly so.  Their toppings are more locally based (sausage and onions, etc) and not what you would traditionally see in Naples.  Their crust, heated by large piles of coal, are also a bit different in a crispness that you don't typically see with true Neapolitan style pies.  But I digress... The place was PACKED, we waited about 20 minutes, and eventually got a tight seat in the back of the house (fine by us, as the wind was pretty cold).   Our server was spectacular.  Super friendly, fully understood that we were just starting our evening food tour, and even recommended that we should do the Chicago Pizza Tour sometime as well!  We got two pies and a root beer to start the evening. White Pie:  Ricotta, mozz, and garlic.  A bit light on the garilc and lots of ricotta, the flavor was definitely subtle/light on this pie.  If you're into white pies, start with this one as all the other pies on the menu will likely overpower the flavors of this one.  If you started here, it's a pretty good pie.  If you didn't, it may come off as a bit bland. Fiorentine:  Soppressata, roasted red peppers, red pie.  My parents complained that the sopp was too salty, but overall the pie had a nice balance of saltiness with the sweetness of the roasted red peppers and pomorodi tomatoes.   Pie's overall:  Perhaps it was the rush of the evening, but most of the pies were coming out a bit burnt on the sides.  It's one thing to have blistering spots, it's entirely another to have char all around the edges.  The bottoms of the pie also had no color at all, but still had a nice crispness to it... I haven't been to Coalfire enough to say if this is the standard, or whether the floor of their oven needed to be hotter? Verdict:  Tasty pies, excellent customer service, I'd come back for more pizza.",0.9802,0.881,0.098,0.021,0.45621118012422357

They don't have a wet bar so I went with the second best option, bottled beer because canned/bottled soda in a restaurant is just all kinds of wrong.  We split a house salad.  Looking back one it, that was so not worth it as it was as boring as plain lettuce.  There were a fair amount of onions, mushrooms and tomato on the lettuce-y salad.  But there was a complete lack of flare, even the dressing was boring.   The pizza was similar to Neapolitan style, one size about the size of a big plate and it had a good charred crust from the coal fired bake.  We went with their sausage pizza and boy was there a ton of garlic on it too.  I love garlic but I'm really glad he already put a ring on it, because there was enough garlic to make Dracula faint. Good pizza, nice atmosphere, sad salad and limited bar/beverage options IMHO.  Plus, it's overpriced for the quantity/quality...like much of Chicago *sigh*.",0.9416,0.789,0.141,0.07,0.5710803571428573

Our group of six came in last night and ordered three pies: margherita, pesto, and sausage.  It's rare that I think this, but the plain margherita was the best of the three by a large margin; a little spicy, light but not limp, tasty thin crust.  The sausage was strangely light on meat; it was basically a margherita with onions and one piece of italian sausage per slice.  The pesto was the best-looking girl at the party but when you talked to her, she asked about your job and said nothing interesting...the pesto was met with oohs and aahs when it arrived at the table, but the mozzarella/ricotta cheeses were surprisingly bland.  Also, I made a mistake...for the first time in my 38 years on Earth, I tried Rolling Rock, and now I know why no one serves Rolling Rock at parties. However, the server we had last night was excellent, the food was served crazy fast, the manager/owner (the guy that appeared to be in charge) was very accommodating and smiled at our table both times I was looking for our server, and the server really sold us on our best part of the meal: the cupcakes.  Which brings up an interesting point: the cupcakes are provided by Chicago Cupcake, so maybe next time, I just order pizza somewhere else and buy the 'cakes at CC instead??  We had the red velvet and the chocolate chip cookie dough...both were incredible, if a little expensive at $4/pop.  (I'm used to spending less for better at Georgetown Cupcake back in DC, but I digress.) I would probably go back to Coalfire with friends if someone else was meeting there, or if I lived closer.  As is, it's tough to have average pizza in Pizzatown, USA.",0.9906,0.835,0.134,0.031,0.4241402116402116

The service was fantastic, not annoying but very attentive.  Our server was very personal and laid back, answering all of our questions...the owner even stopped by and spoke with us.  And not just the obligatory, ""How's Everything?"", he actually introduced himself and asked our honest opinion about the pizza, explained how they make the pizzas, and even where they purchase their ingredients!

In a bit of a hard style to describe they call it an ""American spin on a Neapolitan"" and I felt that as a Neapolitan pie is crust-centric. Coalfire's is appropriately cooked up in a coal-fired oven, one of the only in Chicago, ramped up to 800 degrees. They make their crust a little thinner than a typical Neapolitan and the coal oven puts a nice char on it. The result is a crust that is less spongy than is true to Neapolitan style and a little more crisp (although definitely not a cracker crust). I liked the crust, as it had great flavor but wish that the flavor was a little easier to grasp by sticking truer to a thicker, spongier crust. The standout topping was the oven roasted garlic (delish) but I found the sauce and cheese underwhelming for a pie that demands great sauce and cheese.

Sometimes, though, if you order something with basil on it, they just put big leaves of basil on there, which makes it hard to eat and very difficult to experience the flavor in each bite. I've started just asking for ""the ___ pizza with chopped basil,"" just to be sure. SERVICE: Like I said, they're super fast.

While I can't say I agree, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience here.  Caesar salad ($7.50) is slightly small for a shareable salad, and is frankly fairly average, as it doesn't have the assertive anchovy flavor I like from Caesar salads, but the croutons are good and it's not overdressed for dinner. As far as the main event, Fiorentino pizza ($16.5), topped with mozzarella, calabrese salami, and sweet peppers, is pretty delicious and a perfect size for two people to share. The crust is very thin, but manages to be chewy rather than crackery like other super-thin pizzas. I can't say I've had crust like this before, and while it did not blow me away on first bite, the flavor and texture definitely grew on me as I kept eating it. Apart from the calabrese salami, which is deliciously salty and just greasy enough, the toppings and sauce are slightly above average.  Pricing is fair, and on this visit, our waitress was appropriately attentive, and was awkward but in an endearing way. I like this kind of service, because she acted like some people that I know (namely, myself).

2012-12-08,5.0,"First my credentials: I am a pizza connoisseur(one who understands the details, technique, or principles of an art and is competent to act as a critical judge). Pizza making is an art, I believe that. I have forever been in search of the perfect pie. I read books, I literally travel the world, and I EAT - all to get closer to what I consider perfection. Coalfire stands out of the crowd. They deliver excellent, excellent crust. That is what is important here. The perfect combination of a chewy, crisp, satisfying crust. Along with cheeses and toppings that compliment and combine textures oh so well. In today's pizza society, you need to be inventive with your toppings or risk being average. I'm a sucker for Margherita, but toppings like ricotta cheese are what continue to impress. The staff was excellent, I was personally greeted and welcomed a man who seemed to be the owner, either J. Spillane or Bill Carroll I would guess. Even more impressive, is the fact that they saw me with my DSLR camera and invited me to step into the cooking area to get the pizzaiola at work! SCORE! So at any rate, I've got a few shots from inside the kitchen are to accompany this review.  Overall great experience, I would stop at this Napoletana pizza joint any day over the Chicago-Style-Deep-Dish joints that everyone has heard of.

We were visiting Chicago for a few days and wanted to hit up all the ""top"" pizza spots and this was definitely the best place by far (we visited Giordano's, Lou Malnati, PIquots, etc), and this is definitely by far the best. The manager there was a very very nice gentleman (I regret not getting his name). He gave me a quick tour of the back explaining why coal fire was great for the thin crust bread, and superior to regular fire ovens. He also helped us choose the right beers/pizzas/desserts.

2012-12-07,5.0,"I would give Coalfire 6 stars if possible! This is the first restaurant where I have been overly satisfied in every single aspect of this meal. Chicago is known for its deep-dish pizzas, yet after trying so many places, I was sorely disappointed, so I decided to try a thin-crust pizza at Coalfire. Coalfire is exactly how their pizzas are cooked - in an oven with coal, not gas. Apparently, temperatures could reach up to 1,200 degrees with coal, compared to only 800 degrees with propane.  Sadly, the flavor of the coals was not transferred to our pizza, but that did not change how amazing the pizza tasted. My friend and I shared a Sausage pizza. WOW. It was the BEST thin-crust pizza I have EVER tasted, and I am not exaggerating. The cheese was oozing and gooey, the sausage chunks were thick and flavorful, the red onions were sharp and the crust was crunchy. *droooool* For dessert, we had their Red Velvet and Motherlode cupcakes. The Red Velvet was soft and not too sweet and the crust on the bottom was delicious. The Motherlode cupcake was also great. The cupcakes are actually from a food truck called Chicago's Cupcakes. Service was spectacular. Everyone was so nice, generous and helpful. The owner of the establishment knows exactly how to run a great restaurant. 6 stars for the pizza, dessert and everyone who works there. Thank you for making this Chicago trip memorable. We will come back to visit!",0.9948,0.755,0.206,0.039,0.5714696223316914

Since they cook their pizzas in a blazing hot coal fire oven, it's a matter of minutes before an order is ready.  I love their thin crust - crisp with a right amount of chewyness - just like it should be. The Nduja pizza is pretty new on their menu, as I didn't see it listed on their website or take-out menus.  It's basically a margherita pizza, with the addition of some spicy calabrian pork sausage from Publican Quality Meats.  The soft slices of sausage oozes red chili oil, which packs tons of flavor with every bite.  We also tried the White pizza, which was good, but paled in comparison. Great service and tasty pizza.  Looking forward to trying their other toppings next time.",0.9863,0.787,0.186,0.027,0.530885384456813

It was attentive without being overbearing. The waitress was friendly, helpful, prompt, pleasant, and even tolerated my joking around. She brought our beers right away (extra points!) and was a masterful server. Just like bad service can ruin an experience, good service leaves such an ""I wanna go back"" feeling. This is such a place. But let's talk about the food. I've wanted to try coal fired pizza for some time now so I was delighted to go along with this recommendation. Great Yelp reviews added to my excitement. I was NOT disappointed! This pizza is remarkable. I love thin crust pizza and the coal fired oven cooks them in just a couple of minutes at a very high temperature. The result is amazing. We ordered two pizzas for the four of us - the Nduja pizza with the superb sausage was a giant hit. Thin, crispy (not burnt), great sauce, was a pure delight. We also went the ""build your own"" option and it was loaded with red onions, spinach and sausage. Man, it was to die for! While this isn't a big place, it's comfortable enough. And the pizza?

I've mentioned in my reviews before how I've eaten in Rome, and it's true, and the pizza here is the closest I've found to the pizza in the brick-oven lunch place down the block from the Hotel San Marco. The ingredients are fresh, the dough has a great texture, the meats are high quality and the red sauce is the right balance of sweet and tangy.  I've been twice and tried four different pizzas, each of them as good as the next.  The space is neat, open and well managed and you can see the entire operation, including and perhaps especially the oven, which is neat.  The service, well, that's another thing altogether. If it's possible, the service is as good, or perhaps even better than the food.  The owner is quick with a handshake and very welcoming. The waitstaff are well versed in the menu and pleasantly quirky and sweet.  This place is the perfect combination of downtown quality food and neighborhood service.  While it's not your typical Chicago pizza joint, it doesn't need to be. It's doing well enough being a quick trip to Rome, sans the jet lag. Mangia! p.s.

Enter Coalfire. This place reminds me of Brooklyn's Grimaldi's.  Brick-oven style, nice char with yummy tangy sauce and just the right amount of toppings.  The crust is thin but not cracker-thin; it has some chew and is bendable (read: doesn't break when it's folded).  Toppings are fresh, and sit atop a lovely sauce and cheese combo that pairs well with both veggies and meat. Friendly service, pretty good beer selection and eclectic decor (empty cans of tomato sauce to hold the piping hot pizzas is a stroke of utilitarian brilliance) all provide a lovely dining experience.

In any case, this is definitely a pizza place to check out.  The toppings are fresh, the sauce minimalist but tasty, and the food doesn't sit in your stomach like lead. A few negatives: 1. We arrived just after the restaurant opened for the day.  I didn't particularly like the brand of cleaner they use...odd smell. 2.

Coalfire on the near west side is a gem of a spot that does the thin pie right. This place is small, crowded, and discreet. Just the way I like my pizza joints. They don't take reservations, and there is a very small waiting area that is literally in the doorway, but the great service makes up for the lack of space. Plus we got a great view of all the different pizza options while waiting to be seated. I have to say, this is exactly the kind of place that becomes a neighborhood fave, not only based on the great pies, but the fact that the service here is stellar. Really feels like the owners are super hands on, opening doors, hosting, waiting tables, running food, everything down to the last detail. Really has that great customer service that makes you want to go back to a place. Immediately, when you walk in, you get a whiff of yeasty doughy goodness hitting an 800 degree oven and the aroma that results makes it all the more difficult to wait for a seat while watching your fellow patrons scarfing down hot pies peppered with fresh basil, fresh moz, and other ooey-gooey yummies. The menu is not large. Which is the way it should be. Right? I have a theory that the quality, preparation, and deliciousness of the food at any spot is inversely proportional to the number of dishes on their menu. I don't know if this theory holds up, but in this case it does. They do pies and salads. And they are great at both. The classic margherita is definitely worth its weight in gold. There are other classic combos that you can select from or build your own. We stuck to the classic combos because we figured the pizzaiolo knows what he's doing back there. They serve the pizzas on top of huge empty tomato tins which is hipster and rustic, but more importantly it leaves some table space open since the tables are tiny. Now I'm not a New Yorker, who conveniently have a self-appointed monopoly on handing down verdicts on what an authentic thin crust pie should be, but let's be honest - Unless you're from Naples or some other true pizza originating Italian city, we all have the authority to decide what's authentic and good enough to stuff down our own pie hole. Let's get to it then. The crust - By far the most crucial component of a good thin crust pizza. This one is chewy, light, airy, but substantial enough to hold up to the moisture of the sauce without becoming soggy or weighed down.....I guess Lake Michigan water is just as good as New York water, hah. The sauce - Sauce is good, simple, the way it should be. A far cry from the overly sweet, thick, pasty stuff that most pizza chains pass off as pizza sauce. The cheese - Varies depending on the type of pizza you get, but even the ricotta is super fresh. The fresh mozzarella is great, but it would've been nice to see it sliced a bit thicker to maintain some of its textural integrity when heated, but I'm guessing there may be some structurally issues with doing so on a thin crust pizza. Nonetheless great cheese. Definitely hit this place up when you're craving thin crust pie, be prepared to possibly wait, but the service and food are definitely worth the wait. Eat it New Yorkers!",0.9992,0.773,0.203,0.024,0.5490645316451769
2012-06-06,4.0,I must follow up on my previous review of Coalfire. I found out that the reason my pizza crust was soggy was not really Coalfires fault. The oven they used does produce a crispier crust if eaten in house. If you have veggies on your pizza and take the pie out..it will get soggy. I must say the owners of this establishment are very customer friendly. They contacted me with genuine concern over the soggy crust pizzas and explained. I will try them again but eat in house as the atmosphere and Customer service was outstanding!,0.8678,0.9,0.1,0.0,0.42361111111111116
2012-05-31,5.0,"Now I usually don't write reviews, however after my experience tonight, I feel as though I am obligated. Here's what happened: After a previous visit to Coalfire, my girlfriend and I decided that we needed some more.  I unintelligently placed an order for pick-up (they don't deliver) around 5:15ish (middle of rush hour). To make a long story short, it took us a good 45 minutes to get to Coalfire. Once I arrived, I went inside to pick up my pie (Meat Pizza - sausage, pepperoni, and sopressata). The manager (Nikolai - quite possibly once of the nicest individuals currently working in the service industry) told me that my pizza was ready an hour ago, and that it was cold.  He then INSISTED that he make us another free of charge; his reason, he couldn't bear serving us a pie that wasn't perfect.  Best of all, he let us keep the original cold pizza (my lunch/dinner for tomorrow) AND gave me a free beer while I wait for my new fresh pizza, hot out of the the beautiful coal-fired oven. It is safe to say that after this experience, Coalfire Pizza has gain a lifelong loyal customer in me.  I will never order another thin-crust pizza from anywhere else.  It also helps that everything that they serve is absolutely delicious and made from fresh ingredients.  The service industry as a whole should take a note from Nikolai and the rest of the crew at Coalfire.  This is the way it should be done.",0.9868,0.818,0.158,0.024,0.6198051948051947

The ingredients are always fresh as can be, the pies are consistent and tasty. I really love the Margherita, Napoli (with an anchovy on each slice!), and the sausage (I usually have them add fresh basil on top, after the pie is cooked). The drink selection is small but solid, and the staff is friendly. I am afraid I don't know the owner's name, but he always greets me at the door or stops by my table with a smile and a ""it's great to see you again."" He couldn't be a nicer guy.

I give him a really hard time about pizza in Chicago (I'm a NYer, come on), but I had to admit that this place dishes out some truly awesome brickoven pies. My bar is pretty high too, I am a fan of Lucali (the place in Brooklyn where the owner got stabbed in front, NBD), where the cheese is freshly made in house and they tear the basil onto the pizza to order. So it is with no grain of salt that I say - Coalfire knows what's up. Sausage, basil, ricotta and garlic pie. Yes, please. PERFECTLY charred crust. Ugh, delicious.  Only thing I will say (I hate to do it... but I owe it to Yelp) is that I'm not so sure about the stock mozz that they use. It might be (gasp) part-skim. The texture was weird.

I instantly had a mouth-watering urge to eat all the pizza.  We sat down and were immediately greeted by a waitress who took our drink order. PRO-TIP: Half-price wine bottles on Tuesdays. We ordered a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for about $15 and it was delicious. We decided on a half sausage/half prosciutto pizza and it was on our table in no time (Seriously, it took less than 10 minutes to get the pizza).  The pizza looked almost as good as it tasted. The crust was incredibly cripsy without being the slightest bit burnt. The sauce was not overbearing but still flavorful. Needless to say the pizza was completely destroyed in a matter of moments.

The caprese salad was incredible--served on a huge plate and made with totally premium ingredients. The tomato and basil were so fresh, we could've sworn they have their own greenhouse on the roof where they're growing them. And the mozzarella was incredibly tasty too. The white pizza was awesome (and I'm usually not a fan of white pizza), super tasty and made with really quality ingredients. Their dough is delectable! We did wait a bit for our food, but it was understandably busy for a Friday night. Our waitress was super friendly and efficient, though, so it was no big deal to wait.

They do kind of heap the prosciutto on, which really was too much. I would rather see a better grade of ham and less of it....more of a *flavor* than such a big part of the pie. I actually picked a lot of it off because the saltiness was too much. Other than that, I loved the pizza, and this place....and I really don't hold the fact they give ""too much"" of something against them, it's just something BF and I both commented on.  We also split a Caesar salad which was really great. It was a big portion and perfectly coated with the homemade dressing. The menu is simple and there aren't a whole lot of choices, which is respectable...they do a few things really well. There was cheesecake available for dessert, but no other choices. It would be kinda nice to see some gelato on the menu, too...they could have sold us some last night! The people here are SO nice and the service is great.

One day, my friend suggests this specific spot and I am pretty excited to find someone to finally go with. It's right by my work so we decide to go on my lunch break. My experience there was a bit of a let down. The pizza had about the same amount of quality as a frozen pizza from Jewel. The entire time I ate this near $20 pizza, all I could think about is how I could have a slightly better slice of pizza, beer, and shot for $7 at boiler room. Lots of end crust, not enough cheese.  The only plus was the wait staff was friendly and eager to help.  I will not be going back to this place.

Friends of mine all raved about it, and I have to say I was happy with the wonderful friendly staff and nice simple atmosphere, but I thought the pizza was solid, but didn't blow me away.  We ordered the 4 cheese which seemed sparsely topped and while the paper thin crust was near perfect, there was not much about this pizza that made it feel like it was worth the $15 we spent on it.  Everyone here was so friendly, and if you want that super thin Neapolitan style and you know you are going to get a pizza with just a dash of toppings here and there, then go and be happy. I was hoping for something between the over sauced, over cheesed pizzas of most places in Chicago and the sparse pizza we were served at Coalfire. The flavor, texture, and crust were nice. Don't get me wrong.   Perhaps I am not a fan of Neapolitan pizza? Who knows? Oh, and for the fancy pants out there who think that people actually order pasta in Italy ""al dente"" (they never do!), I have had pizza in Roma, Mantua, Firenze, and as far north as Bolzano, and so I know what pizza is here, and what pizza is in Italia, but alas I have never been to Napoli or had pizza in the south, so, again, who knows?  I have seen photos of the other pizzas with nice selections of cheese and meat so I am going to go back here and try something a bit more hearty and see what I think.  The people here were nice folks in a cozy little place. It was pretty cool to watch the little coal fire oven baking away.  They have a 50% off selected wine special Tuesday and that seems like a great deal.

When we first got there, we thought the place was closed because it was very dark inside. Thankfully, it wasn't. We ordered the Margherita, White pizza and this red pie with anchovies. First of all, all of the pies looked very good, which I really liked and think is very important. We went to 'Piece Pizza' a couple days later and their pizza reminded me of zebra crap which certainly was unappetizing. The Margherita was ok. The crust was delicious but we thought the sauce was a little weak. But overall, it was definitely one of the best pizzas we've had in a while. White pizza was definitely better than the Margherita. The crust was delicious of course, and it was nicely seasoned, although I thought it could use a little bit of sea salt. The cheeses were a little heavy, but it still worked out to be fine.  Anchovy pizza was our favorite. It was SO good! The saltiness of the anchovies worked perfectly with the cheese and the crust. It was simply delicious. 2 people, 3 pies. It was easy.

The second visit was more substantial: our group sampled several pizzas and each was great.  My favorite was still the humble Margherita, but I appreciate the taste of the other offerings.   The inevitable question is how Coalfire ranks alongside Chicago's other thin-crust spots.  I think it does well.  I prefer it to Spacca Napoli: better pizza and a nicer staff.  At Coalfire, the owner/manager came over to our table to ask how everything was and whether we needed anything else.  Nice touch.

My favorite pizza is probably the four-cheese (the ricotta makes it different from a lot of four-cheese pizzas), but all of the ones I've had have been good. Plus, they cut the pizza in triangles, which is a welcome relief from the square pieces that seem to be the norm (why, I have never figured out). The only thing that is preventing me from giving 5 stars is the salads. I ordered a salad here once and will never do so again. It was literally a pile of untossed salad fixings on a plate and there was no room to toss it yourself. The dressing was also pretty terrible. That's a small matter, though.

2011-08-17,2.0,"I was very disappointed with Coalfire pizza. They advertise that they serve ""neopolitan style"" pizza, but really their pizza is a characature. Firstly, true neopolitan pizza is baked in a wood oven, but I do realize their whole ""take"" relies on coal fire, hence the name. However, the oven seems to cook the pizza too quickly. It  does not allow for slower rising that gives neopolitan pizza its characteristic bubbles and texture. Coalfire also advertises ""fresh mozzarella"" when it is very obvious, even by looking at the pictures, that this isn't the case. While their cheese may be ""fresh"" in the sense that it isn't old or rotten, by its very nature, true fresh mozzarella cannot be finely shredded. You can even see it in the photos that they use finely shredded cheese which cannot be true fresh mozzarella. Fresh mozz is moist and generally needs to be cut into slices or rounds and is too soft and moist to be shredded. Their sauce was unique, but not particularly flavorful.  I also wanted to point out that their crust was too thin and cooked too quickly- more of a chicago-italian-style thin crust but definitely not neopolitan. It did not taste bad, but it wasn't  particularly special and what they claim to be serving they are not. This was very difficult to swallow when you're paying $16 for a very thin 14"" pizza which does not have fresh mozzarella, very skimpy on ingredients and very thin flavorless crust. I have paid far less for much more outstanding italian pizza. Sorry, but this was a big disappointment. I do want to mention that their waitstaff is impeccable.

The char on the crust is nice and crisp while the interior is light, yet chewy.    I had a pie with prosciutto and fresh basil; other than the outstanding crust, their sauce is fantastic, slightly tart yet savory, and the cheese has good flavor, it's amazing how bland some mozzarella can be, and there was a pile of prosciutto.  Now this was high quality prosciutto, warmed slightly from the piping hot pie.  I literally ate the whole thing, and this was a nice sized pizza.  Now, I worked in a pizza shop for about 6 years and became partial to wood fired pizza, but this place has shown me the flavor only a coal fired oven can bring.  Oh, and a little tip, it's probably good for delivery, I honestly don't know, but nothing beats a pie fresh out of the oven, NOTHING.

But to me, a hungry girl looking for excellent flavors with quality ingredients, Coal Fire is pizza heaven. Soft crust, thin pizza, sweet tomato sauce, not overly cheesy, with a unique selection of flavor combos: that's Coal Fire pizza.

It was like we had 3 servers for one table. Once the food arrived to our table we smashed our pizzas in, what seemed, a matter of seconds. The fine-grained flour has provided the amazing chewy crust. It is a true definition of American-Neapolitan style pizza. Joe is a great pizzaolo and his delicious pizza will soon be in many more magazines. So make sure you take the time out while you are in Chicago to stop by this pizza place.  It was nice to enter a famous pizza place where the staff is not stuck-up.

I wouldn't compare this to Spacca Napoli.  It is a different animal.  Spacca is certified throughout with the types of ingredients (00 flour, dop, etc.), ovens (imported), pizzaiolo (also imported!), etc.  Coalfire is about a guy living his dream.  The owner is passionate about pizza and trying to produce a quality product with great effort.  Good guy.  His coal fired oven is probably running around 800 degrees and churning out pies in about 2 to 3 minutes. On the plus side:  like I mentioned before good char on the upskirt and end crust, fresh ingredients/taste, nice and thin. Things that need work:  crust needs more flavor and a bit more chew.  Sauce is mild but I think most people will like this...I'm just used to a spicy sauce.  Basil....I rather see this hand torn and cooked into the pie rather than placed on top as a whole leaf...too much basil. Making a perfect Napoli pie is not easy.  It is a craft that is honed over time.  Overall....this is a quality pie if you are tired of Chicago style pizza.",0.9815,0.738,0.177,0.085,0.6231884057971014

Open for 3 years, the location of this restaurant is a little understated as I have driven by here many times but have not noticed it. What I should have noticed is some great thin crust Neapolitan style pizza baked in an 800 degree coal fire. A great way to have pizza as the crust is the not event- merely the carrier to all the great toppings that they have.  We got there a little before they closed and had the place pretty much to ourselves. Our server, Lyra, was great. She steered us toward her favorite pizza (salami and red peppers- sounds odd but it was great!) The salami tasted a bit like pepperoni without all the grease and the peppers were sliced thin which made not only a delicious pizza but one that was pretty to look at as well..  We also had a caprese salad to start which was fresh and wonderful. Beer and wine is also on the menu and wine is half priced on Tuesdays.   Parking is pretty easy in this area and if you pay by cash- you will get a 10% discount applied to your bill.

We both found it odd that you could order your pizza with ""Fresh Mozzarella."" Oh yeah?! As opposed to ""Not Fresh Mozzarella?"" Save the dollar and go with regular, you won't know the difference after it's cooked. Or stop in your local Jewell and pick up some cheese to add to it because there wasn't much on ours.  Comparing pizza and prices against other places, I don't think we got our bang for the buck. A good bang for the buck is CiCi's or Little Caesars, which I gave higher ratings yet they are not as good as Coalfire. They are both cheap and you know you are getting a $5 pizza or buffet.     The point is, it's not bad, but surely didn't knock my socks off.  I'd go back if others requested, but wouldn't rush right back.  The girlfriend wasn't impressed at all.",0.7723,0.852,0.102,0.046,0.4642965457481586

The first was on a Friday evening so it was packed with no where to wait. Most people were inside, since it was cold out.  The tables are small and the space seemed cramped. It became loud as well, so probably not the place for a date, or large groups. The second time was around 6 on a Thursday, it seemed much better equipped to handle the crowd that day. There was no wait and the staff was very attentive.  Now if we are just talking pizza, I say it offers a delicious thin crust. It is more old style and has a real Italian authenticity. The ingredients are fresh and the wait isn't so bad once you take a bite. As a couple we shared a caprese salad and that too was fresh and delicious. For dessert they offer only one selection, so if you're looking for more, then you may have to go elsewhere for dessert.

The crust was nice with a good chew to crisp ratio. The ingredients let us down a bit. The cheese was a bit too salty and the sauce had a store bought quality to it.

And if you look at my rating distribution you will see I am typically very forgiving. Not this time. A brief anecdote may assist in understanding the problem: about a year ago, I was reheating some Indian food in the microwave, and I had a little Greek yogurt on the side of the dish (to cut the spices). I put  the dish in the microwave without thinking. The yogurt kind of drained and hardened into a white, porous, chewy little ball. I tasted it; I know the flavor and consistency. This is the flavor and consistency of Coalfire's ""fresh mozzarella"". I kid you not, just try it at home. Microwave some Fage or Oikos yogurt (I think it was even the 0% fat kind), drain the water off of it, and take a bite. This is Coalfire pizza cheese. I was shocked when I was mentally transported back to my microwave mistake upon my first taste of the pizza. And this ""cheese"" is on top of a chewy, soggy crust. Expect to chew a lot at Coalfire. I won't mention that they forgot to put basil on the pizza. Yeah... As if bad pizza (what?!?) isn't shocking enough; this experience had to happen on my special someone's birthday. The man does not ask for much and is so easy-going and didn't complain, and pizza is like, his favorite thing in the entire world. I was so disappointed and saddened this was his birthday pizza. He makes better pizza at home with stuff he buys at Jewel! Anyway, having to give a 1 star review is especially irritating if you were the dumbass that suggested that we go to Coalfire rather than Spacca Napoli.

2010-02-27,4.0,"""Yay! I'm a fan."" That pretty much sums it up. I love coal-fired pizza. I can't understand why there is, like, ONE place in Chicago that does it. I suppose wood-fired is the more traditional route for Neapolitan pizza, but there is a definite difference in the taste of the crust and the overall flavor of the pizza.  Anyway, all the more reason to yay! over Coalfire. They have the usual specialty toppings (margherita, hot salami, four cheese), or you can make your own. Making your own is the pricier way to go, as they charge a few bucks per topping. I opted for the four cheese, at the behest of my significant other, even though I wanted margherita. He loathes coal-fired pizza, preferring heartier Pizza Hut-style pies. Since I practically had to drag him in here, I compromised and got the four cheese. I worried it would be too cheesy and drowned out the flavor of the tomato sauce. Not so. The cheese-to-sauce ratio was about 50/50. And the ricotta added a nice flavor to the pizza.  The 14"" inch came out to $15, plus $1.50 to add fresh basil leaves. I would skip this; it didn't add much to the taste unless you ate an entire leaf in one bite. The two us got four slices each, which filled me up but left Rick still hungry. There wasn't much we could do about that, since there are no appetizers or desserts on the menu. We could have ordered another pie (fine by me!) or gotten a salad, which is more of a before-entree kind of thing, but instead we decided to pick up a sandwich for him on the way home. Aside from adding a few more options to the menu, my only gripe is that the last two slices I ate were a bit cold. I never had this problem at the other coal-fired place I've eaten at, so I wonder if they just need to get better pans that stay hotter longer to keep the pizza warm throughout the meal. Even with these small issues, I still loved pizza and would happily return (sullen husband in tow).",0.9504,0.841,0.103,0.056,0.5471153846153846

The Margherita was solid, complete with nice, tangy tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella (although I could have use a touch more cheese and a dab more sauce on this pie).

The restaurant itself was very nice.  I enjoyed the fact that it felt more like a small restaurant dining area than a pizzeria.  There were no obnoxious signage boasting delivery or take-out options.  Instead the walls are painted in contemporary warm tones and there is authentic artwork adorning the walls.  From my understanding, they don't deliver but do have guests that order take-out.  If that is true, I didn't see a single to-go order fumble past our table.  So either that business is pretty limited or they did a stellar job at making it unknown to other diners.

I started the meal with a nice caprese salad.  They do not skimp on the basil here--each leaf completely covered the mozarella slice--but for some sad reason it lacked pungency.  Feeble crop of winter basil?  Too bad, but in general it was a nice offering.  Tip:  This thing is meant to be shared.  You get seven little tomato/mozzarella/basil towers, and I was starting to feel full even before my calzone arrived. I tried my friend's white pizza and found it bland, but when I dressed it up with some of my marinara and meat from the calzone and sprinkled it with oregano, it was a damn good slice of pizza!  The crust is their particular strength, it seems. Plentiful parking nearby; reasonable prices; prompt and friendly, if often oddly entertaining, service; and of course a solid calzone...no reason that I wouldn't be happy to return.  Here's to deleting my second-oldest Yelp bookmark, and it was worth the wait.",0.9854,0.771,0.159,0.07,0.581891891891892

My friend ordered the Margherita and I had the Pesto with red onions added. SOOO freakin good! The ingredients are all great quality and the oven they have makes the crust crispy and chewy all at once! Tonight I came back with two friends, Patti K. and David R.  and they both enjoyed their entrees. The White pizza and a calzone respectively. I didnt try the calzone but the White pizza with the cheeses and herbs was good and not overly cheesey which I liked. My Pesto pizza was awesome as usual!  I also had the house salad which had a pile of thinly sliced red onions on top. I think a lot of people would have been put off by that  I was excited and ate every last one!  Patti had the caesar salad which was great and the dressing was seriously good. I ended up finishing her salad at the end of our meal while we sat and talked.

It's decorated simply, with exposed brick walls, dim lights, and empty tomato cans on the tables (to balance the pizzas on).  Pizza is a very thin crust style, cooked quickly in an extremely hot oven. The crust around the edges is much cracklier than that at Spacca Napoli, which I've often heard Coalfire compared with. There aren't many topping options, so we went with the margherita and the sausage. Both were very good, I liked the sausage better personally, but I'd order either again. Pizzas say they serve two, but honestly if you go with a hungry guy, they'll easily finish off a whole one themselves. Half of one was plenty for me, but I wasn't even that hungry.  Dessert options are fairly limited, but the cookie towers (or whatever they call them - basically two butter cookies with a cream cheese filling separating them and a dollop on top -- are the perfect size for an after-dinner sweet.

I'm a big fan of thin crust pizza with quality toppings and this place definitely seemed to follow that idealogy. The Meat pizza was definitely a meat overload. I'd never complain about it but to some, it might be just a little too much meat. It included hot calabrese salami, Italian sausage and pepperoni. Honestly, I think ALL the cheese was covered. Delicious! The Magherita pizza was your classic cheese pizza with basil leaves on (almost) each slice. Very plain, yet refreshing... especially if a break was needed from the meatfest pizza.

Pesto Pizza-I would guess that this dough is the VPN approved recipe (Vera Pizza Napoletana?) with just water, flour, yeast, and salt.  It was good no doubt, but did not knock me out for either texture or taste.  Pesto was barely noticeable in flavor, and was largely drowned out by LOTS of kalamata olives, which were not up to snuff, clearly canned.  I wish I had been able to sample something red, but these pies are big and I did end up pleasantly stuffed.   For the effort to find this place and all the hype, I was clearly a bit disappointed.  The pizza was good, but I was hoping for greatness, and that did not happen.",0.9896,0.759,0.184,0.057,0.4823333333333333

Slightly chewy, slightly crunchy, but oh so good. The consistency of the crust is what got me, it was just so good. Just chewy enough. The red sauce? Slightly sweet, slightly tart, just balanced, just right. The pesto pizza, slightly salty, had a kick to it and made me rest assure that no vampires were going to visiting me this night. I wish the prosciutto was just a little more crunchy but really minor mood point. Its not like it stopped me from eating a good chunk of each pizza.

2009-08-10,4.0,"I'm a big fan of the ""fired crust"" pizza thanks to a lovely month spent in Roma...it's pretty much all I ate, and once I found the best place in my 'hood, I had thighs of steel due to the walking up and down the hill to get there and back (however, the cheesy belly epidemic from the amounts of cheese and gelato I consumed made for an interesting physique post-Europe study abroad summer.) Clearly, my favorite (and cheapest) place was Pizza Art Cafe...it truly was like the Monte Mario place, minus the boisterous Italian atmosphere.  However, new neighborhood means new 'za joints, and Coalfire came highly recommended. So we started with the caprese, a safe bet, and a good judge for anything claiming to be Italian.  Here, it was fabu...perfect chunks of mozzarella drizzled flavorful olive oil atop tomatoes (which were OK, but I've just come off a stock pile of home-grown tomatoes and those are hard to top.)  All tomato snobbery aside, the caprese was a great start, and plentiful for two hungry peeps. We tried the sausage pizza, which was very lovely.  I loved the sauce, it was zesty and not-too-sweet, which I feel can be the trouble with a lot of pizzas.  Good crust, perfectly not-perfect shaped, and heavenly aromas. Friendly service, which is hilarious because we got seated shortly after a party of 30 and only saw our server once...thankfully, there was some SERIOUS team work going on and we were very well attended to.  Bravo. One caprese, one pizza, two Peronis = about $35 (before tip).  Not bad at all.  I noticed that Tuesdays are half-priced wine nights.  Gotta love a recession-friendly special.

2009-07-31,2.0,My first experience at Coalfire left me disappointed. As such I will probably not return. This is a different type of pizza joint for Chicago. The pizza is thin crust...very thin! This is fine if you want to try something new but at $14-$15 dollars a pizza you aren't getting much for your money. The pizza is just not that good and not even close to worth what they charge. The pizzas are not big enough to fulfill an adult male appetite both in thickness and circumference (they only have one size). Therefore you have to order your own and maybe a salad if you are really hungry. If you have a beverage its easily a $20 dinner. For a sub par pizza? No thanks. On the up side the service was great and we were even thanked by the manager for coming in. The pizzas cook fast so they come out very quick.

Coalfire is the bomb diggity, from start to finish. Despite the cavernous, stereophonic crazy ass loud acoustics, everything abut Coaly is crazy cool. We'd just finished a lengthy walk with Leo and Kindle at the Mutt Hutt. Bitches wore us out (tru, tru), and so we needed some food. Butterfly Sushi? Sure, but we hadn't planned ahead and a bottle of white would have been mighty fine there. Zutalo, Coalfire! I let the hubs work his magic on the toppings while I handled the vino. And developed a small girl crush on Tonya (pron. Tone-yah, like Tone Loc. Get it done, girl!). Her bleach blond bobbed self thought we might be virgins and escorted us as such, with TLC. We ordered a prosciutto pie and went ahead and ordered a bottle of the suggested white. I know, right? A white? With pizza? At first we tried for the red, but it got all coy on us and disappeared. Tonya instead suggested we try their replacement for that fine bottle by pouring us a rather hefty complimentary glass. All from Perman's down the way on Washington. Big ups for supporting the locals, Coalfire. Good woman. Damn fine woman. And so it went. Sure, our pie went to another table, but then Tone-Loc brought us a complimentary caeser salad. Fit for two, it wasn't shrouded in mayo, rather a light, lemony dressing that made the homemade croutons simply glide as opposed to float. It was bright and perfect.  Pizza came without too much delay and, ravenous or not, we were moaning with delight. It's such a treat to find a place (even after 140 odd reviews) that gets your neck hair standing on end. The sauce is killer. Absolutely tomatoey, parmesany, righteous killer. And the big black bubbles on the crust, yes please! Even the cheese had flavor. Each little bite was topographical and detailed and ripe and gooey. All of this for $35. Buzzed and blissed out, we stumbled onto Grand with smiles and giddiness.

Bad Points  1) Nothing special about their crust. After reading about the coal oven running at 800 degrees ...well just expected something different.

My tastes run towards the pizza's with only small amounts of tomato sauce and cheese accentuated by some strong herbs. There sausage pizza just came out a oily mess with the Margherita slightly better  3)High prices. Each of these pizzas which you could definitely eat on your own, costs about 15 bucks at minimum.

Several years back I was introduced to Pizza D.O.C, just north of Lincoln Square. For years, that has been the gold standard to me. That place reminds me of a typical place in Rome.  Coal Fire was written up as the best Neapolitan pizza in the area in Timeout Chicago magazine's November 8th, 2007 issue. Since then I made a mental note to try it out, which I actually didn't act on until recently. I'm sorry I waited so long. Pizza D.O.C has a serious contender! What makes this place different is that, as the name implies, they use coals instead of wood in their ovens. It makes their crust have a unique smoky flavor. Their crust has just the right amount of doughy-chewiness that I love. Their pizzas are out of this world! More about the place itself: they're located in an old, narrow, tin ceiling storefront close to The Matchbox (the ultimate dive bar) near Grand and Ogden. The atmosphere is very low key, relaxing and neighborhoody (if that's a word). They don't have home delivery....yet. Luckily for me I live close enough to pick up a pie quick when I'm so inspired.

There are a lot of misinformed comments about Chicago-style pizza in these reviews.  Most native Chicagoans would enjoy this place, because most native Chicagoans grew up eating thin-crust pizza and only occasionally eating deep dish.  The cooking method adds extra flavor to a general style of pizza that Chicagoans have enjoyed for decades, notwithstanding common but baseless assertions to the contrary.

All this adds up to very expensive pizza ($14 - $16), especially considering that one really isn't enough to feed two. I just didn't see any reason to charge so much for the pizza. Service: Really, really bad. The BYOB thing is an issue, and apparently they are ""phasing out"" BYOB. They said that there would be a $10 corkage fee for bringing in wine bottles, but when we arrived they said it would be a $20 fee. So, charging even more to uncork a bottle of wine than for their small, average-tasting pizzas. Further, the manager was extremely rude about it and would not apologize for raising the price of corkage on the spot. Servers kept on alluding to the BYOB era and how people had ""taken advantage"" of the policy in the past. Okay? So people brought in their own alcohol when you had the policy? What exactly happened that was so bad that the manager had to be extremely rude to us about it? Who knows.  There are plenty of great places to eat in the city that are either cheap or offer some quality and ingenuity if charging high prices. And some even manage a modicum of good service as well!

The service was efficient and amicable, and the smells of cooking were most appetising. Then came the pizza. OK, to be fair, the chewy blistered crust was very nice, as were the tasty toppings. But the sauce was a real downer. There was a dark, tinny undertone to it that just sapped the life out of the pie. Mind you, it wasn't bad in the way that much of Chicago pizza is bad, but it was a definite letdown. We also got a white pie, which was significantly better.

Now, the wild west BYOB has disappeared (replaced by a steep $10 corkage fee) and the prices have gone up. A can of soda used to be $1.25, now it's $2.00. Pizza prices have increased by about $1.50. I have an old menu in front of me so I'm not making this up. It could be a fluke, but the night I went it also seemed that the crowds had disappeared.

The location is a little out of the way for me, but there is plenty of parking around.  We had to wait about 5-10 minutes to get seated (waiting on tables to be cleaned off) on a Saturday evening at 7:30.  Good for us, not so good for Coalfire. The pizza was decently tasty.  Came out quick, and it was piping hot.   I don't mind paying $15 for a pizza, but I just have an issue with the menu.  Their one-size-fits-all pizzas are not big enough for 2 people and too big for 1 person.  And I just can't see this good for leftovers.  So we got 1 pizza and left wanting another slice or 2.  I think 2 pizzas for 3 people would be perfect.  To cater to those dining in pairs, I think Coalfire should add additional sizes of pizza to their menu.  Just a thought.

The first time we dined in, they screwed up our order.  They brought out the ""bad"" pizza, left it on the table for us, and explained the situation.  They let us try it while we were waiting for the pizza we ordered.  A bit strange, but a nice gesture nonetheless.  Not only that, but they cut the price of our pizza on the bill.  The ""bad"" pizza was delicious and it whetted my appetite for the our actual pizza.  The ingredients are all very fresh and the pizza comes out of the oven with that perfect blend of crunch and chewy. The servers are on top of it with wine glasses, or a tub of ice, for your beers. I will say that you MUST eat at the restaurant to get the full impact of the pizza.  It simply does not fair well as take out, or delivery.  And, it is not that great the next day.

We ordered the house salad, which was simple, but cold, crisp, and refreshing.  My dining partner commented that the dressing reminded him of his nonna's oil and vinegar.  It was a tiny bit on the puckery-tart side, but that wasn't an issue really.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not think the lack of dressing options was a big deal.  They have a simple, streamlined menu where they do a few things but do them well. Next up was the calzone.  We got red pepper and onion.  The dough was crisp, chewy and delicious.  The filling was an unusual combination for calzones but it worked really well.  Unlike the typical calzone, this one was not stuffed full with oozing cheese.  Instead, you had a nice amount of vegetable filling, which stayed slightly crisp inside the bread and was melded together with a dallop of ricotta cheese.   On the side, there was a nice 6 oz cup of tomato dipping sauce.  We gobbled the thing up in a flash. For our pizza we chose the anchovy pie.  Very tasty, especially if you like anchovies.  Each slice had an anchovy slice in the middle of it, so that when the pizza came, it looked like it had spokes.  The crust was perfect, the sauce was flavorful.  We ate the whole thing! (it was only 14 inches after all, which is the only size pizza they make).  Like I said, I like their simplicity and the fact that what they choose to do, they do very well.

The place was almost empty at 5:30-ish on a Saturday, though by 7:00 most tables were filled.  The waiter came by promptly to take our orders (I guess you are no longer required to walk to the counter to place your order?) and the pizzas were ready in just a matter of minutes. The pizzas have a thin crust which is somewhat delicate, yet just strong enough to let you pick up a slice and roll it up NY-style, if that's the way you prefer to consume your pizza.  They have several varieties of pie that generally each contain just a simple variety of ingredients.  You can also ""make your own"" pizza with your choice of toppings, though I'd advise against going overboard & trying to build a super-supreme with loads of stuff. Each pizza is about 14 inches in diameter, but they are light enough that one very hungry person could almost consume an entire pie by themselves.  It's a nice place to visit if you are with a small to moderate size group, then you can order several pies to share. I'm surprised to read reviews that gush about the pizzas here being the ""best in Chicago"", ""best in America"", ""best in the known universe"", etc, etc.  They are very very good, but Spacca Napoli's pies are still the standard against which I judge all thin crust pizza.  It also seems that they don't have anything to offer in terms of desserts, we were done dining in less than half the time we had budgeted for dinner, and it would have been nice to linger for a while over espresso & tiramisu or something similar. In summary - I'd probably not plan to go too far out of my way to dine again at Coal Fire, but if you happen to be in the area or passing through, it would be a very fine choice for a simple BYOB dinner.",0.9911,0.846,0.123,0.031,0.5099554781262099

We attempted to visit Coalfire again two weeks ago.  Like the first time, we were treated horribly by the staff, and ended up leaving in a rage... my boyfriend actually yelled a graphic, yet hysterical, obscenity at who appeared to be a manager or owner.  (If you have been there you can imagine how that well that went in the tiny, yet packed, restuarnt.  Hee!) I am completely disappointed by my experiences with this restaurant and hope, for their sake, that they invest in some serious customer service training.  Obviously, I intend to never return and would never, ever, recommend Coalfire to anyone. **Updated 1/29/08, reduced stars from 3 to 1** I wanted to like Coal Fire so bad. Upon hearing of it's opening,  I emailed my boyfriend pictures of the pizza I found online and reviews.  I was marketing it hard.   I was all, ""This place is going to be awesome.""   For the first time, the boy and I visited Coalfire this evening.  (I know, 4 months later.  We are very, very busy and important, you know.)  We found the environment to be modern, comfortable, and very clean.  We found the hostess to be very nice and genuine while some of the other staff to be harsh, unhelpful, and unfriendly.  There was a mistake with our pizza, which was corrected, and we were very grateful to get what we actually wanted.  We ordered a salad that was nothing short of awful.  Wet Romaine lettuce, 4 tomato slices, and mushroom slices drenched in a vinegar-laden dressing of the houses choice.  Perhaps the bad salad was our own fault, we realize after-all, we were at a pizza place not a salad-shop.   When we received our correct pizza, I have to say it  was pretty damn good.  We mowed through it rather quickly but still experienced pangs of hunger as we looked longingly at the empty pan... so, of course, we ordered another one.... Because, well, we were still freaking hungry. In the end I am not sure if I will return to Coalfire.  While not bad, it was definitely not awesome, either.  I felt the pizza was pretty pricey (2 pizzas and a salad $39... BYOB!) and a couple people on staff could use some etiquette training.  The decoration and design was great, but the ""place your own order, we bring your water"" arrangement made me anxious... just give me a server, man.

On the topic of the food, however, I'll first say I'm an aficionado of pizzas and cook many kinds in my own kitchen, ranging from richly olive-oily southern Italian focaccias to crisp, hand-thrown, rustic pizzas, to even (dare I say it) New York-style pizzas (disclosure: I am a native of Chicago, but also appreciate what goes on elsewhere). I had high hopes for the new pizzeria opening literally a few doors down from my apartment, and was disappointed. The freshness of the ingredients was good, and the texture of the crust very good.  I know the crust is expected to get a little charred in spots because of the intense heat of the coal-burning oven, but found it to be a bit too charred, bittering the flavor.  The crust itself I thought was essentially flavorless--something as simple as adding salt, a little sugar, and a little olive oil to the dough would correct that.  The calzones come with what seemed to be simply pureed tomatoes straight out of a refrigerator (cold, cold, cold). While not bad, I found it to overall be bland and disappointing, and the inexplicable enthusiasm of the upwardly-mobile crowd to be a little laughable in its naivete. Edited -- I've given them another shot a couple more times, and my review overall hasn't changed.  The food wasn't saltless this time (and while I had one with anchovies which guarantees salty). My two biggest annoyances, aside from all the illegally-parked BMWs and shiny SUVs that now make it impossible for me to unload stuff on the occasion I have a ZIPcar, are really with the service. Their phone message indicates that if they don't answer it's too busy and food is on a first-come first-served basis.  Considering that I'm a neighbor and am only privy to their food by going in and waiting in-store, I feel like their perspective is that it's a privilege to have their pizza and that I should have to work for it--either that or they simply did not plan the business well enough to handle the demand in an area that's deprived of artisan pizza. Secondly, when I did go in, the woman at the counter seemed irritated that I was placing an order and walked up to the counter, and had to think a second about what pizza I wanted.  Apparently the least I could do was memorize their menu? The food is improved, but I just don't like the awkward service situation or the condescending nature, nor do I like the fact that it's so see-and-be-seen.  It's not a well-kept secret, it's not exclusive.  It's a decent pizzeria with an upturned nose is all--Time Out Chicago cooing over it or not.",0.9657,0.844,0.098,0.058,0.5218838242367654

Our 'main' server seemed to be a bit stressed out and was slightly less than polite at times - but that's ok, she was running her a$$ off.  Our pizza came out in a relatively timely manner, which I wasn't expecting after I saw that the oven really wansn't that big (Maybe 4-5 pizzas at a time?).  The pizzas were crispy, hot, and just as described on the menu.  It was a bit expensive, I think.  Around $15 for a 12 (or was it 14) inch pizza.  But they didn't skimp on the toppings, and it was great!  I'd go back, though there's another new pizza place up in Ravenswood that I like just a little better.   Those who visited in the first few weeks - it's worth another try.",0.95,0.872,0.094,0.033,0.40840698653198654
2007-07-07,5.0,"BYOB. Awesome art on the walls. No nonsense, delicious-ass pizza. The pizza was brought out quickly, and tasted excellent. You can't get ""White Pizza"" in many places in Chicago -- that's an asset. I am marking it as cheap, because you can get one $14 dollar pizza and split it between two peeps.",0.7506,0.756,0.166,0.079,0.6166666666666667
2007-07-06,1.0,"I liked coal fire.  Seems like they've worked out the kinks in the service for the most part: you come in, they seat you, you look at the menu, you go to the counter to order, they bring your pizza out (quickly) and then you settle up at the counter when you're done.  My pizza (sausage) was delicious.  I love the chewy and tiny-bit-charred crust and the sauce, cheese and sausage were all flavorful and delicious.  My boyfriend and I went for a nice weeknight dinner, and we didn't mind that it was a little noisy.  We could definitely hear each other fine.  I'm looking forward to going with friends and taking advantage of the BYOB. UPDATE 8/27/07:  I've noticed the last few times I've been there that they go a little too light on the cheese.  From now on I'm ordering extra cheese! UPDATE 11/28/07:  So they're going light on the cheese, and the owner is getting more surly by the day. We've stopped going here.  And I used to love it so much! UPDATE 10/24/08:  They're going WAY light on the cheese, the owner is surly and unfriendly, and now the prices have gone WAY up.  This place has really gone downhill.  NOT RECOMMENDED.",0.9825,0.803,0.161,0.036,0.5291666666666665
2007-07-01,5.0,"This is quite possibly the best pizza I've had in Chicago. The bf and I went last night (a Saturday) at about 8pm and ordered the Margherita.  Not only did it arrive super speedy, but it was incredible as well.  The best crust in Chicago - yeasty, chewy and crispy on the outside, with just a few blackened bubbles that added to the taste.  Fresh cheese was great, and not too much sauce.  The one pizza was the perfect size for us to split.  Our bill, with two cokes, totaled less than $20.  I'm telling all my friends and coming back as often as I can, or until I get sick of pizza.",0.9824,0.732,0.235,0.033,0.4848214285714285

2007-06-18,4.0,"We've had 'za from here twice now, and have been fairly pleased.  Once was carry out, and the pies made it home intact and perfectly delectable (the sausage more memorable than the white, but both very tasty).  A few days ago, stopped in around 7-8 for dinner..  no wait for a table, and the pizzas came relatively quickly, and were even more delicious right out of the oven, as one would expect.  It was a bit odd that they had waitstaff but still required that you order at the counter and open your own wine (they gave us a corkscrew and glasses, but it was up to us from there..), and I certainly didn't feel like the pizza was any sort of a bargain, but still, pretty damn good for what it is.",0.9115,0.733,0.174,0.093,0.6092436974789917
2007-06-12,4.0,"My husband and I declared June ""Pizza Appreciation Month"" I mean, there has to be a reason you eat pizza 4 times in one week! Perfect excuse. Anyway...next on our ""Chicago thin crust, east coast inspired pizza tour"" -- Coal Fire Pizza! I found the service to be good, great actually ... It seems the quirks they might have had in the beginning have been worked out.  - You walk in  - They show you a seat  - You look at the menu  - Go up to the counter  - Order  - Pay  - They bring the pizza in under 10 minutes (2 pizzas..)  - We ate and enjoyed!  - They brought us a carryout box for extras. I am new to this style pizza, and the east coast raised husband has been teaching me the ropes.  According to those standards, Coal Fire is a winner!   I personally just know it was delicious...simple toppings, not over done, just right, crust was chewy in the middle and crusty on the outside. Don't forget BYOB though. The inside decor could use some work...and yes, it is kind of noisy.",0.9748,0.797,0.161,0.042,0.4984114100185529

2007-05-17,3.0,"Not overwhelmingly impressed. Unlike the other reviews before me, we were able to find a table, albeit the last one. However, I noticed the tables were turning over pretty well. On the service end, seems like they're working things out. They only had one official waitperson. However, when necessary one of the guys from the kitchen area would run out and bus a table and drop off the pizza's as they came out. We were also asked if we needed anything else and how are food was more than once.  We ordered a house salad, that was 7.50, they only have it with the house dressing, a vinegar & oil type. It was so lightly applied that the salad tasted dry.  For the pizza we got the four cheese, and had them put basil on it. This was also, just okay. Minimal sauce, one little half inch basil piece per slice of pizza. So if you like basil, maybe they put more on the pizza's that have it listed as an ingredient. I would hope so. I agree with the one review that said it could of used a little more time in the oven. Was a bit soggy. I guess because they were busy, they were pushing them out quicker. I would of gladly waited. As for the coal fired part of this, if you like to eat your pizza with your hands, watch out. I rubbed my face and ended up looking like a coal miner. Dust all over my face, you will see it on your hands also. We'll give it another try, maybe when they're not as busy, perhaps with a crisper crust it will taste better Lastly, the noise level is intense. They need to add some elements of design to absorb the noise. We barley spoke, since the noise was drowning us out.",0.9714,0.874,0.104,0.023,0.5958333333333333
2007-05-14,3.0,"5 days in and the situation is barely better. We ordered 4 pies on Sunday and ended up with half a our left-overs given to the owners of Matchbox because Jay ran out of dough after serving 46 pies at 8:30pm. No joke. The restaurant was to remain open until 11pm but by 9 customers there were no customers. chaulk it up to the first freaky Sunday in Coalfire's nascent life. no worries tho, we chowed. we chowed and we saw. we saw randomly recognizable foodies, we saw Juicy's owner, we saw serious local wine buyers. we saw mediocre pizza being churned out by a kitchen that's understaffed. the margherita and the fiorenze (spicy capicola? or was it salami?) were both very underwhelming. both pies came out lukewarm (same prob as Lindley's to-go pie?) with the center of the pie undercooked and still doughy. the fiorenze pie at $15ish was a complete rip with scarcely a trace of meat toppings. the third and fourth pies were big improvements with the ""Meat"" pie being the best of the nite and the ""White"" pie (4 cheese) following close second. The White pie had the crustiest crust, but was a bit try, needing an extra shot of olive oil. Restaraunt was indeed packed the whole time, but with proper staggering of pie ordering, we did not go hungry for (with a help of 2 bottles of barbarescos i normally cannot afford on my own). This restaurant was 2 years in the making but within 2 hours, I knew I would never come back. Coalfire (according to owner, an amalgam of NYC and Neapolitan style), Spaca N, Sapore Napoli and the likes are great efforts in diverting this City's retarded obsession with deep dish pizza and for that I applaud them. But otherwise, a pie at Noli's is still the closest thing to a NY slice for me in this city.",0.8335,0.841,0.088,0.071,0.31178160919540227
2007-05-10,3.0,"Woe to the person who goes to Coal Fire during their first week of operation. For that person will spend a good part of their night waiting, waiting, waiting, whilst the owner and his staff try to work out the kinks. And there are a lot of kinks...from checks out of sequence, to lost orders, to a system that isn't quite...right. Here's the scene: walk up and place an order for your pizza at the counter with the friendly counter guy. If you come during meal times, you will get in line and wait and wait.  After placing your order, find a table. If it is a good night, you will find a clean table. If it is a bad night, not only will there not be a table, but you will notice that the other diners are not yet eating - their orders have been lost in the queue.  Bring yourself a beer or a bottle of wine. Coal Fire is BYOB. You'll need it to kill time. They do have a corkscrew, but the night I was there two staff members searched the dining room until they located it at a table. Oops.  If the kitchen hasn't planned well, you will notice that they are slicing cheese instead of filling orders. This causes the orders to back up. If things get really bad, the owner will abandon his post at the oven and jump on the pizza prep station. This slows down baking. If you get lucky, somehow your pizza will jump the line and be ready almost the moment you sit down. Other diners, waiting for far longer than you, will glare. I saw this happen.  If you order takeout, you are taking your life into your own hands. I ordered my pizza to go (a margherita, priced 13.16 with tax, I think...or was it 14.16 with tax...well, the menu price is $12.99). They never called my name when my pizza was ready, but I suspected the abandoned box on the counter was mine. I was right. More glares all around, especially from the other woman waiting with me, who had been there nearly an hour, waiting for two pizzas. A few diners glared at me as well. Hey, I can help what the kitchen does. The pizza itself was good, although it could have used at least another 30 seconds in the oven, which happens to be heated with wood - I didn't see the coal when I was there, but I'll admit that I wasn't looking. The dough could have used the tiniest increase in salt - so tiny, it would be hardly detectable...so it was pretty close to excellent. Chewy, not too yeasty, simple. The sauce was tasty, but the cheese wasn't impressive at all -- tasted like typical pizza restaurant low moisture mozz. It was very salty (Pizza mozz, minus water = saltier flavor). It did contrast with the less salty crust. On the margherita, the basil is added just after the pizza comes ouot of the oven. So it tastes like...basil.  The pizza reminded me of what I used to have at Pizzaria Regina in Boston's North End. I recommend waiting before you try Coal Fire. There are a lot of kinks to work out. And you don't want to let down your friends.",0.5223,0.83,0.086,0.084,0.5287593984962407
