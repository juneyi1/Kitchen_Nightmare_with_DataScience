2017-08-20,1.0,"Food is great. Drinks are good. But the late night servers on the live entertainment side on this past Saturday were terrible. I understand being patient when a place is busy, but having to wait 30 minutes just for a drink is pretty ridiculous. After the waitress took my order she never came back around to our table but continued to take orders and serve food to others. Since I wasn't able to get her attention I decided to just go to the other side and order and pay for my drink at the bar. Later in the night I ordered my second drink with the other server, to which he returned with my order right away. For my third glass I decided to go with the second server being that he was more efficient when I ordered with him before, he placed the order but then the original waitress was the one who brought it to me. When I was ready to close my tab I saw that I was charged 3 drinks, when I brought it to the attention of the second waiter, he went to go check on it for me, thats when the original waitress came back aggressively insisting that I ordered three. I told her that the first drink I never received, and this was even confirmed by the entertainment mgr ( whose table I was sitting with ). She thought that the drink she bought over to my table was my first round that I ordered with her since arriving 2 hours ago, I explained to her that my first drink I purchased  at the bar myself and she continues to argue with me. I felt as though she wasn't trying to listen to what I was saying and I just figured it wasn't worth arguing over $8 so I just closed my tab and still tipped, the reason being was because the second waiter did a great job to me.",0.9698,0.84,0.109,0.051,0.416991341991342

2017-08-03,2.0,"The best way to describe Fireside is an exercise in wasted potential. They have a fantastic location and fantastic ambiance, but the food and service are only blah.  I have usually been there for brunch, which seems to be their busiest time. However, the thing is the servers always seem to be moving around at a quick pace but not really doing anything and the food always takes FOREVER. Last time we went there it was the worst. I've grown accustomed to Fireside's long wait times for brunch but at least keep me occupied with invites for more cocktails or refills on soda and water. This last time our waitress only checked on us when it was time to deliver the food and each time she did she didn't offer refills or second drinks, she'd just walk away after she left the food. There was maybe 5-6 groups on the patio-- but there was at least 2 waitresses and a couple of other servers and yet nobody seemed to ever check on us. My food ended up being extremely late (later than even Fireside usually is). She apologized every time she brought someone else's meal but never checked in.  We had to flag down a server whose only job seemed to be refilling water glasses to get more water. Really? The food is fine but definitely not worth the wait I had to endure to get it.  I've only been for dinner once. It was stuffy, outdated, and mediocre and would never go back.

Even the Cajun deviled eggs were awful.  Everyone around me at other tables were filling their plates & going back for seconds.  But I will never go back to this restaurant.  I was embarrassed that I brought out of town guests here.  It was also priced too high at $24.95.  Service areas in the back rooms need serious cleaning.",-0.7964,0.809,0.077,0.113,0.5388405797101449

The food was forgettable and my Bloody Mary tasted like water. I wasn't too mad. I was like maybe it's better as a take out place. Fast forward to last month.... We ordered delivery via grubhub for a movie night (just me and my man). We each ordered a burger as well as some wings. We were watching a horror movie (JeruZialem), horrible movie. Anyway, we had the lights out to try to make the film a bit better. My boyfriend thought his burger tastes a bit strange but mine was delicious. He told me his stomach hurt so we turned on the light so I could get him so Tums. He looked at his burger and it was raw... I ate rare and this wasn't even close to rare.  He threw out his burger and we continued watching the film, vowing to not order there again. Two hours later, I was in the bathroom (going number two) when suddenly he knocks on the door which isn't like him. He said he had to use the bathroom and I said I'd try to hurry up.  Anyway, I got out of the bathroom and there he was in the kitchen. I found the poor guy trying to clean vomit off the walls, floor and sink. I had him go back to bed and spent half an hour hand scooping vomit out of the sink. They get two stars because I thought the onion rings were nice. But ...

In fact, I would say that's a flat out lie. It was the nastiest calamari I'd ever eaten, chewy isn't even the word for it--they were almost hard they were so tough.

The dining room decor is moderate - very casual.  The room was not very loud so you can hold a conversation without raising your voice.     The washrooms are located in the bar area.  Again, you can tell this is a neighbor spot.  The bar area is a very laid back.  Very relaxing and very casual.  There is also a covered patio with several tables.

So, the food.  My son's french toast was MASSIVE.  Came with 2 huge slices cut in half, and strawberries.  This was the kid's portion mind you.  We could've probably split it and potatoes and gotten our fill, just my wife and me.  For $3.95.  So, be warned!  You'll have leftovers.  Apparently adults order from the kid's menu because of that, sometimes.  My wife's quiche seemed to be cooked in a deep pan and sliced out in a square.  Way too much cheese in it and on top, honestly.  Almost like scrambled eggs in a slice - not much crust, if any.  Potatoes were unseasoned, though cooked well (same for mine) - needed salt and pepper at least.  My benedict was great tasting, and I would get it again. All in all, we spent $31 before tip on three people and got full.  Slow service but average to decent food.  We'd go back again but we would order different things.  Maybe try a skillet, or just go for dinner to check it out.",0.9882,0.862,0.113,0.025,0.5009432302115229

The waiter even offered to do separate checks for each of us which was awesome! He did seem to get overwhelmed when bringing out the checks though. Somethings were mixed up on the bills when he brought them out which is totally understandable since it was such a big party, one thing that turned me off though is that he kept mentioning how it wasn't his fault because everybody moved seats from when he took the original orders, (it was only two people), I do understand that this may have been frustrating for him and would not have mind if he mentioned it once or twice but he mentioned it about 10 times or so which got old. Aside from that he was very efficient, friendly and professional so no biggie and he did take a lit of items of the bills that came late so that was a plus . The food was great, I ordered the blackened chicken pasta and it was amazing! I wasn't even hungry because I had a rather large lunch later in the day, so I was planning on taking most of it home, but it tasted so good I almost ate the whole thing. The drinks are a bit expensive but worth it cause you get a very generous serving compared to other places and they don't cheap out on the alcohol. My friend ordered some type of cucumber drink and she shared with me cause she did not think she could finish the whole glass.

The appetizers were mediocre at best and the entrées are absolutely horrible. Service is also slow and inattentive. We have tried the bronzed shrimp and chicken wings for appetizers. The sauces were nothing to write home about but good enough to eat. The shrimp and the wings were over done and the meat consistency was tough and drier than desired. We had burger with bacon (asked to cook temp to medium rare), catfish, and meatloaf for entrées. Everything was so overcooked and underseasoned. We sent back the burger after showing it's super well done when we requested medium rare  The 2nd attempt's burger was medium well and super dry. Pouring bbq sauce couldn't save it. Meatloaf tasted like cardboard and super dry topped with canned crushed tomato sauce. The sides were super over cooked to a point where it had a greyish tint. Only tastier sides were french fries and sweet potato tots. Waitress didn't check up with us on how our 2nd burger was. She didn't refill our empty water glasses, didn't ask if we wanted another beer/drink, and didn't ask if we wanted dessert. She just handed the bill to us after the second burger came.

We went on a weekday night and sat in the dining room near the fireplace. They were able to accommodate a group of us comfortably, no problem. Our waitress was wonderful! She was nice, thorough, patient, and attentive from the very start. Our food and drinks came out in no time at all.  The food was a mixed lot, and the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Let me be clear: we probably ordered half of their menu between all of us (exaggerating) and we're talking about the difference between ""not bad"" and ""outstanding"", nothing worse than that at all. On one hand, I found their homemade fish and potato chips to be one of the best I've ever had...and I've partaken in my fair share of Friday night fish fries a la Wisconsin and Chicago in general. Their tartar sauce was wonderful. Hubby would have divorced me and married their chicken tenders right there on the spot if he could have. On the other, hubby's turkey club was lackluster and my sister's fries were soggy. The shrimp appetizer left a lot to be desired. The veggie side tasted like it came from a can...you get the idea. So, I would absolutely be back, and I'd absolutely recommend you try it out; I would just be selective about what try. Best bets: fish and chips, rueben, roasted chicken, chicken tenders, and desserts!  Pro tip: wear your elastic pants.

I'll chalk it up to it being in the wee hours of the night and they had a few too many, but these guys are regulars and I'd rather not run into them again :)  On the second occasion, I went to the restaurant side during the day. It was quiet, cozy and the food was good and fairly priced. The table settings were great! The center pieces were little flower pots they were growing their herbs out of.

He said let me see what I can do. He  turned around left never to return. After standing in a narrow hallway watching happy family after family get their seats a waitress came out and said we have one tall table, but it's not for the family that reserved via Yelp. She took the family standing next to us because they called in their reservation and Fireside misplaced their name.  I said enjoy your brunch, and sadly turned around and told my wife, 2 year old and in-laws and said we should probably leave.

I knew it had a large menu, an inviting dining room with a fireplace, and its own parking lot adjacent to the restaurant. Although its menu is heavy on meat and I am a vegetarian, I knew I could find something to eat. Since the occasion was a celebration of my birthday, I also wanted to have a couple drinks with dinner, and I  knew that Fireside had a full bar. It all seemed reasonable, and the Broccoli Queen was enthusiastic. She knew from past visits that she could get broccoli.  The parking lot is really convenient. If the lot is full, you'll find plenty of free, nearby parking on Ravenswood. The dining room was very pleasant. It was a cold night, of course. We arrived shortly before 6pm, when there weren't a lot of other customers. We asked to sit near the fireplace, and we got a good table nearby. The waitress gave me a drink special menu, and among all the specialty drinks, I saw that they had glugg. Perfect! That's what I ordered. Oops! The waitress told me that they didn't have glugg anymore. In fact, the restaurant hadn't actually carried glugg for a couple months, along with another specialty drink. OK, I don't get my fancy drink -- first world problem, right? Still, why pass out a menu that's incorrect, and has been for a couple months? And why didn't the waitress tell me as she gave me the drink menu, we're out of these two? That's a big bad on the restaurant, and a little bad on the waitress. I ended up with some kind of hot cider drink. It was pretty good, but not good enough to get a second one. I went with a red wine which turned out to be only okay. My friend ordered a pizza with broccoli. She was deliriously happy. I saw that there was a whole section on the menu for macaroni and cheese. You could get it plan, or you could get it with all sorts of additions. I ordered it with peas. I did get what I ordered, which is good. The taste, though . . . what a big nothing. I've seen lots of Yelpers say things like, this food tasted like it came out of a box, and I've thought, oh, they're exaggerating. When I tell you that this macaroni and cheese tasted like Kraft out of the box, I am not exaggerating. Big, big disappointment.

I've seen more and more of that but Fireside does it really well. There's a cozy dining room that's almost like a lodge atmosphere with a fireplace (hence the name); the other side of the building has a long bar with pub tables and multiple TVs. Again, the patio is the most impressive, with its expansive area of several tiers of tables, many tucked behind the half-walls. Great atmosphere for all three, depending on what you're in for. The food is also surprisingly good if you consider how late they're open. This is not normal bar food. There are clearly chefs working in the kitchen.  Sometimes they mess up an order or let something sit too long, but their recipes are for the most part slightly above ""above-average"" American food while keeping a reasonable price point. Special orders are welcome. They ""blacken"" their fish extremely well, considering they're not even close to a fish-house. Well, they're not a steakhouse, either or a pizzeria, but they can cook those foods just fine too. Plenty of variety. Also often serving larger tables (8-12 people) and the waitstaff is usually very accommodating. Clearly I must also thank the restaurant (not merely the bar) for being open late. It's comforting to know that, at 11 pm or later, if no other restaurant can be decided upon, Fireside is open and serving great food... not merely warmed over stuff from earlier in the evening, and not just burgers and fries.

But it's decent for the most part, and for having a 4am/5am liquor license, it isn't a dump like certain 4am bars can be(*cough* Carol's). Like others have said, there's a dining room on the left as you enter that's open till 10pm or midnight depending on the day you visit(and have ironically still never been on that half, lol for various reasons), and a bar half on the right, with a patio in the rear. Unfortunately, that heated patio section isn't always open sadly, as I learned on a recent visit a few weeks back. When it is open though during the summer months(and late spring + early fall, and on whatever days they want to open it up with the heaters on), I greatly, greatly appreciate that it has almost no birds and pigeons, unlike the patio at Moody's Pub unfortunately. They recently removed their cigarette vending machine(can't blame them, with the ever escalating city and county obscene cigarette tax hikes), so be advised(if you must get a pack in a worst case emergency) the closest places to now purchase cigarettes is at the Citgo gas station on Peterson west of Ravenswood, J&H Liquors at Hollywood and Clark, and Jewel just south of Clark and Bryn Mawr, if it is unofficially true from some reports that Marathon at Bryn Mawr/Ashland doesn't. Most of the time when I've come here was only for a beer, but a few times in the past I've tried their food. My friend got the chicken quesadillas on a past visit which weren't bad, and not the best or worst quesadillas I've had. I got a po-boy sandwich, which was surprisingly decent, considering that I didn't suspect any restaurants north of New Orleans could serve a decent one. But they did, so cheers to Fireside. And the service isn't the best, but it isn't so terrible you'd never return again. I think it really depends on whoever is working, when you come here. The nighttime bartenders I've encountered here were friendly for the most part, if not always as quick as I'd prefer. But it is a nice plan B, if I'm feeling like going to a bar away from the usual Andersonville bar crowds, and is usually not too bad crowdwise before the late night bargoers arrive from elsewhere. Selection doesn't have some of the unique beers you can find at Edgewater Lounge, Jerry's, Hopleaf, etc., but at least there's always something that works, and it isn't too bad pricewise for late night bar beer pricing standards. There's a parking lot(and owned by a place where they actually spell Allan the same way as my name's rare spelling, yay!) that's free all night just immediately south of here, though I forget after what time you can park there for free(think it's around 7 or 8pm). Also be warned that Chicago Police often hide to bust drivers not doing a full stop at the Ravenswood and Rosehill Dr. stop sign, so you can't say you haven't been warned about that. Wouldn't be surprised if they sat there to bust drunk drivers, as well. It's only about 2 blocks away from the Damen, Clark(runs 24/7), and Peterson buses. Be advised that both the southbound Damen and eastbound Peterson buses end just before 10pm each night, and the last westbound Peterson bus runs a few minutes later. I'd advise getting a bus tracker phone app, to always be 100% sure of the exact bus arrival times.",0.9796,0.813,0.114,0.073,0.5373220477698091

2015-01-04,4.0,"I recently dined at Fireside Restaurant on North Ravenswood.  It sort of feels like two establishments in one.  If you walk in the front entrance, there is a doorway on the right towards the ""bar"" area, with music and also a few tables for a slightly more casual dining experience.  The doorway on the left leads to the main dining area, with a warm fireplace prominently featured on the side wall.  If you sit near the fireplace (such as our party of three), you will definitely feel warm and toasty.  There are interesting artworks on every wall for added visual appeal, so you feel like you're in a cross between a ski lodge and art gallery. The food menu is rather extensive, but the drinks menu seemed even more robust.  I had previously visited Fireside's bar during a beer trolley tour, and after having inspected the beer list thoroughly I know why Fireside was included in that tour.  I must have perused longingly at the beer listings for ten minutes before selecting the Ommegang on tap.  There is no complimentary bread basket here, and the menu states NO SPLITTING PLEASE.   We each ordered ribs for dinner, as that is one of the featured (and pricier) menu items.  I ordered a full slab, with an enormous baked potato (comes with butter and a cup of sour cream) and mixed vegetables.  The ribs were splashed with a slather of barbecue sauce across the slab.  The ribs tasted fine, the meat was tender, though I admit the ribs are no comparison to the ribs I like at Smoque.  I did have about four of the ribs to take home, and enjoyed them reheated the following evening.  Should I pop by Fireside again, I'd like to try something else on the menu. The service level was efficient during our meal.  There is a small but free customer parking lot adjacent to the south wall of the restaurant.",0.9869,0.827,0.145,0.028,0.4161904761904763

2014-11-30,1.0,"Where do I begin? Here are 4 reasons I will never return to Fireside Bar and Restuant.  Reason 1- After coming to this bar 6 times in the past month, maybe remembering your loyal patrons is too much to ask.  I personally got offended when the bartender pretended that he had never met me before and tried to make an excuse for it.  Reason 2- After standing for 15 mins one of the ladies in my party, (party of 4) wanted to sit. So we saw a table that was open and we sat down with our drinks that we had paid for at the bar. Dispite the fact that we were sitting at the waitress's table, she fail to ask us if we needed anything. She completely failed to acknowledge us.  15 mins went past and after my girlfriend finally got the waitress's attention, she told us ""Ill be right back"". 20 mins passed before she came back to tell us, ""I know that you have been waiting but there are other tables that have priority over you. Once I'm done, then Ill come back and take care of you."" WHAT. ..that was so RUDE. I then simply grabbed drinks from the bar. And ordered food from the bar. Since we clearly were thirsty and hungry at this point.  Reason 3 After ordering a Chicken quesadilla and two Cajon fries, our food came out wrong. The fries had no Cajon seasoning on THEM at all. We never said anything at all.  Never complained about a single item.  Then a third order of fries came to our table, that we NEVER ordered. The waitress finally came back to inform us that my bar tab was transferred to her and that she will be talking care of us. We never cared were taking care of us and long as SOME ONE did. Which she fail to do.  Reason 4- We watched a women walk towards our table and vomit on the floor right by our table. Almost getting her fluid on my girlfriend's friend. (who had never been to Fireside before) IT then took the bartender 10mins to respond and clean up the mess. Fu$#ing Disgusting.   My girlfriend and I were so embarrassed by the service,  or lack there of. We brought her friends there because we THOUGHT this would be a good spot for food and drinks.  I guess we were wrong.  I will never return....",-0.9614,0.796,0.082,0.122,0.44590304590304586

By chance we looked out our window to see him standing at our front door.

Example 2: Pizza that was botched was taken care of with a replacement equally awfully rushed job which had crude cheese in the center of it unmelted. Example 3: The kids spaghetti meal came with the pasta stuck together and cold - did they forget to boil it? All times that this happened is usually during busy hours, which it's always busy and that's a good thing for them, but poor on the customers for quality of kitchen servings.  The wait staff is congenial, the bar is great, and watching a game here is great.

Here are my justifications for these two statements.  On my first trip to this restaurant our meal lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Because they are understaffed it took forever to progress through our meal.  The restaurant was not that busy but 8 tables for one waitress is not good.  This second trip to the restaurant was no better.  While the meal time was less it still progressed slowly which is not good when you are eating dinner with a 2 year old.  They get bored quickly and things get ugly.  There were no less than 2 management looking girls in dresses walking around checking on guests but did not lend a hand to the busy waitstaff.  I would have expected these women to pitch in and help bring checks to the tables or help deliver food but no, they just meandered around the restaurant.   The food came out and my wife and I were very underwhelmed.  We ordered stuffed shells in parmesan cream sauce.  The stuffed shells looked and tasted like they came out of the frozen food isle at jewell down the street and were microwaved minutes before the food was plated.  The 'parmesan cream sauce' was bland and looked like it was emptied out of a jar. My wife and talked about this place on our way home and both agreed this place needs the likes of Gordon Ramsey or Brad Long to come in here and make this place what it should be.  As I was eating my food I could hear GR's voice in my head yelling at the owner ""What is this, is this out of a can?""",0.957,0.817,0.114,0.069,0.4245169082125605

We walked in and turned to the left for the dining room. It features a cozy fireplace befitting its name. A nice, warm feature (all gas-fired, so no fumes) on this stormy night.  Drinks of all kinds, mixed, bottled/canned, or straight up, are no problem when there is a full service lounge in the next room. They had  a few ciders I was not familiar with and so gravitated to a Washington state one made with the addition of hops, making for a drier taste. The menu is nicely organized into categories that were helpful in deciding based on tastes and pocketbook. At the top of the $ list would be their selection of ribs and steaks, followed by their specialties and pasta plates. Recommended choices were highlighted with a string of Chicago-flag stars before and after the name of that dish. Our newbies especially like the chicken quesadillas, saying they topped ones they had elsewhere. There were a list of tempting appetizers, salads, and sides (next time, maybe something besides the calamari, which had too-crispy breading). As alternates to the dinner type dishes, you could also choose pizzas of various sizes (and prices) or what Fireside is an attraction for, the burgers and sandwiches. The latter are all under $10, which includes your choice of a side dish, like fries, tater tots, chips, broccoli, etc. The room ambience was relatively quiet, so normal conversation amongst five people was easily possible. Add to this, a friendly and helpful waitress, and our evening was a very pleasant one despite the rain outside. Hopefully, next time, no rain, so we can scope out their patio.",0.9912,0.793,0.16,0.047,0.46320707070707073

I called to make a reservation at 7 for 3 people, the woman asked if I wanted to be the patio, I said sure. When we arrived we stood in the waiting area for someone to acknowledge my party. After waiting a few minutes we went to the lounge thinking we could find someone there, nope. We went back to the dining area when someone finally came to help us. We were told they were very busy, but when I said we had a reservation in the patio, the server took us back to the area. There we found the entire patio was booked for a party. The server told us that there ""may""' be a table in the dining area. That table was in the corner and obviously for 2 people. I then asked if I should go somewhere else to eat. They promptly cleaned off another table for us to sit. Things continued to go down hill from there. It took our server quite awhile to come back and take our drink orders, then even longer to take our food order. An hour later, we got the salad, but our appetizer was nowhere to be found - I told my husband that we weren't going to be getting an appetizer.  I was close to being right, it came with the meal. None of the food was good, the calamari tasted like the flour the batter was made with, the spicy shrimp pasta was dry with  barely any seasoning and the steak was also dry, even though it was quite red in the center. The country fried steak was tasty, but the mashed potatoes were chunky to the point I wasn't sure they were chunks of potatoes in there.  Throughout the experience our server kept apologizing. I realize it wasn't her fault for the problems. There were at least 3 large parties in the dining area plus the party, so I'm sure the kitchen was slammed.   A manager needed to be on duty to help the situation.

I've ordered a couple of times just because the food was great and I was hopeful I'd just been unlucky, but delivery seems to be consistently bad. It takes much longer than estimated (through Grubhub) (closer to two hours than the initially estimated one, even though it is eventually updated, but what good is that to me when it's already been an hour?) The packaging is really not great at all. The drivers have trouble finding my apartment and then have trouble finding my unit. Last time my order got mixed up so a driver arrived having given part of my food to someone else (and my order had someone else's address written on it) and had to return to the restaurant, taking an extra hour to get me everything I'd asked for.

There was another group seated in the area we were to sit in that we were told had been there for over 3 hours. After an hour of waiting, we couldn't contain the kids anymore and had to leave and make do at home, since Mother's Day is near impossible to get a reservation for last minute, especially for a group as large as ours.

Felt a little ripped off as a first time customer. (I was tempted to remove 3 stars but Eat24 was great and gave me a coupon for the difference.).  -1/2 Star: Food arrived about 20-30 minutes late and warm, not hot, not cold, just warm. -1/2 Star: Garlic bread wasn't very good and they don't know how to cut a pizza correctly (pie cut requested). Slices were cut in all different sizes, each piece ranged from 2 inches wide at the crust to 6ish inches wide at the crust. It was like they cut each slice separately to the center for each slice rather than the standard 4 cuts across the whole pizza for 8 even slices. Pros: - They included Crushed Red Pepper, Oregano, and Parmesan packets with the pizza! -Open and delivers late (but we didn't order late) - Pizza has a nice thin crunchy crust with a nice balance of crust to sauce to cheese ratio with just the right amount of grease. As an East Coast transplant I prefer a NY foldable type crust but this was good. (Would have been better hot rather than warm.) -Fries were decent, not overly salted or soggy, but still warm.

Crickets, the irregular passing of Metra trains, neighbourhood folks walking their dogs, highly satisfying pub food and craft beers and half-priced bottles of wine have led to some of our best, most restful evenings in Chicago. G.-the-dog appreciates its dog-friendly patio. Fireside's owner has a big dog living upstairs when he's around and sometimes drops off a biscuit for little G. He's a good man, that owner guy. Five woofs for him. There's a huge garden room in the back covered with tarpaulin ceiling which is totally unique to my experience. The Fireside has four dining areas, so a space to suit all tastes. Food is very good, sometimes great, usually right about above average in most respects. Their Jack Daniels infused barbecue sauce . . . ahhh, the Jacked Up burger with onion straws . . . big steakhouse fries . . . and S. swears by their steak sandwich with freshly sliced avocado and raw onion.

The chicken fried steak was good solid home cooking and the gravy was perfect.  My quiche was more like quiche/French toast, but it was tasty and had an interesting dipping sauce (with a bit of red pepper, for bite). The 'military' group was representing the history of servicemen in America and had performed at the cemetery (we heard cannons when we parked - awesome) and they all trooped in, along with a hoop-skirted woman.  We got to see all the different menu items they ordered and, from breakfasts to dinners, they all looked fantastic and smelled divine as they passed our table. (They were nice to us and told us a lot about military history and let us take photos with them. They said they go to Fireside every year after the ceremony and they seemed to be pretty familiar with the menu, the way they talked.)

It's sad that such great food is being masked by such inappropriate behavior. We had finished our burgers and now the place was getting pretty busy. Hence it was about 2AM and everyone was coming in from their night. It took us about 30 minutes to get the waitresses attention yet again to get our check.

2013-04-21,3.0,"its really disconcerting reading all these negative reviews that start with ""i've been 700 times and this review is for this one bad time that i had so here's one star for my one bad experience out of 700"" seems very unfair. but thats neither here nor there this was my first time here, and i swear i felt like gordon ramsey or even robert irvine. i felt i was on a freaking hidden camera show.  we got there around midnight/12:30 am. the service, man was the service not fast. we walked straight through the bar to get to the patio where a sign stated a hostess would seat us. no such thing happened and tiresome of standing there looking slow, i found my own seat. a server or busboy finally came to us and asked how many to get the glasses of water, but we instead moved to the bar area. you cant have crayons in the bar area because people slip on them, so there goes that. might i add, i was already annoyed, and i am a pretty easy going person, but it took such a long time for us to be greeted when we got in the bar and an even longer time for our drinks to finally come. the waitress was nice enough tho.  now i looooove to eat, but i am no food snob. i didnt get a steak or a lobster tail, i ordered standard bar food (if you would call fried calamari standard, it is sort of a staple) and got substandard food. when i say no flavor, there was like no freaking flavor calamari- chewy and was not fried hard, the crust came right off. and again, chewy wings- seemed to be cooked all the way and were good and not skinny skimpy wings, but the buffalo sauce tasted like buffalo barbecue sauce. too sweet and too thick. fish and chips- the fries were delicious, the fish was salty and good enough, tasted like huge fish sticks. mostly flavorless. also came with vegetables. please read and believe, I LOVE VEGETABLES, but these were almost unidentifiable. they were cold after a few minutes, and the potatoes felt like squash (i was eating with my hands) but tasted basically unidentifiable. i cant even say for sure they were potatoes. i could not finish my vegetables, and unless they are peas, i always finish my vegetables in order of flavor: wings, fish, calamari.  one friend who is a bit of a food snob didnt seem to like her food too much. and she was annoyed with the leaf garnish they gave her which was funny. she ordered the half slab of ribs which came with mashed potatoes. another friend, while i did taste his food (he got the eggplant parm) it was underwhelming.  eggplant parm is one of those foods i always hear ordered, but never had. i dont think i've even had eggplant before. basically, underwhelming. again, no flavor. i didnt see the big deal, but i wont let this restaurant be the standard for eggplant parmesan if i ever order it because there is nothing else on the menu i would get. the eggplant is fried, but the crust was sooo soggy and again, no flavor. lol.  it reminded me of the episode of restaurant impossible where the cook didnt even add salt and pepper to his chicken and said ""people love my chicken"" no. no they dont. basic spices thats all you need fireside. this was just ridiculous i was eating everything on the table, not out of hunger, but out of a want for taste. something good enough that i could pick on that only. i finally settled to eat all my fish and fries. so sorry veggies on the bright side, our server (who both friends thought might've been drunk) called us a cab and made sure we got in it. that was nice of her, even for slow service, so they get one extra star for her. plus, the bathrooms were stocked (well one stall did run out of tissue) and they had paper towels so no waving my hands frantically as i walk out the bathroom, even tho i'll settle for an air dryer the music was crazily loud. although they turned it down eventually. we werent at a club or a concert yet we were yelling to hear each other. will i go back again? yeah. it was fun enough. wish they had a pool table. will i go when im starving? no. maybe i'll get the fish and chips again. maybe i'll get the wings again (oh yeah, about 6-7 wings for $8, smh) but anything else i'll leave to the pros oh yeah, i dont want to leave anything out COCONUT MOJITO IS DELICIOUS",0.9967,0.757,0.154,0.089,0.613843537414966

Since we were going to be here for a while I decided to order the turkey sandwich. OMG....best turkey sandwich EVER! It was like my perfect sandwich I dream of...huge  tender slices of turkey piled high on multi grain with mayo, jack, mounds of spinach and avocado and a side of waffle fries (insert drool.) Forget the deli meat turkey, this was slabs of real roasted turkey breast! After taking that first bite it was like everything in the world was good again and bad night poof! gone due to this great sandwich. The waffle fries were amazing too and seasoned perfectly! So the next day I was asking where did we go...where was this great sandwich that I must eat again???

2013-02-19,1.0,I'd like to preface this review by saying that I have eaten here many many times and this was my first negative experience. This time I chose delivery and what a terrible mistake. The food was COLD! This food just doesn't travel well.  Now lets get to the food. We ordered the crab cake appetizer and when they say crab cake they mean crab cake. There was just one burger patty sized cake that was largely flavorless and drenched in tartar sauce. The huge quantity of sauce should have been a giveaway. I also ordered a smothered burger which was again flavorless and a huge disappointment. The Swiss must have been bargain bin cause it added nothing whatsoever to the flavor. The burger had the right amount of mushrooms and onions though again they lacked any flavor perhaps due to either low quality ingredients or products past their prime. The burger itself could be improved by adding some seasoning though there was a pleasant hint of char.  The delivery came with one set of plastic cutlery for 2 people (wife ordered her own entree) and zero condiments. This place is on the downslide. Corner cutting has taken this place from a previous favorite to an also ran. I may give them another shot but it will only be because I either don't have other options or I am too drunk to remember how bad it was.,-0.8555,0.856,0.053,0.092,0.6493799603174604

Maybe the food will save them....NOPE.  The following is a direct paste from their weekly specials ""Spicy Bacon Wrapped Scallops. Succulent sea scallops wrapped in crispy bacon then dredged in our special blend of Cajun spices."" Hey, we love scallops.  So after 20 minutes of waiting we order our scallop appetizer and entrees Cajun Meatloaf for me, Spinach and Mushroom Ravioli (Another weekly special) for my wife.  The scallops finally come out.  Holy crap!  These things came out on a plate of shredded lettuce and pico de gallo!  These weren't just scallops wrapped in crispy bacon, they were pieces of warm ham stuffed with a micro scallop.  Did they steam these?  Nothing crispy, no spice, except for the wonderful cup of spicy mayo or some garbage like that.   I'm still being patient at this point, and just laughing it off while the table wobbles, maybe dinner will be ok.  Well after another 20 or so minutes our dinner comes out.  Direct paste from their menu: ""Two slices of our moist and hearty meatloaf generously laced with smoked Andouille sausage direct from New Orleans. Served with marinara au jus.""   Its easy to make a moist meatloaf when you cover it with a can of crushed tomatoes, I was unaware it was supposed to be served room temp.  Maybe it was a red wine?  No sign of sausage.  I opted for the side of mashed potatoes with this.  You ask yourself, can they screw that up?  YES they can!  I found a half of an uncooked potato in mine and just as warm as my meatloaf.  My wife on the other hand was blessed with what may have been Trader Joe's ravioli thawed out and doused in oil (maybe olive?).   While considering placing my dinner near the fireplace to warm up, servers bumped our already unstable table a dozen or so more times.   I'm so glad our server did not stop by to ask how we were through dinner.  It was just a nice touch at the end.  I'm glad we didn't have a far drive home so I can poop this out.  Oh, yes I already had to poop.  I've lived in this city my entire life and my wife moved here 3 years ago and she said ""This is truly the only bad meal I've had since moving here.""    I understand where she's coming from.  Thank you.",0.9975,0.753,0.191,0.055,0.5973000683526999

Listed on the ""specials,"" Thanksgiving dinner was $18.95. So very reasonable. That included the entree offerings of Roast Turkey, dark and light meat, mashed and sweet potatoes and dressing. (It occurred to me that the president should really pardon a couple of carbs as well as turkeys, since millions of carbs are sacrificed every year, too.) Nothing green was offered. Had to add on a dinner salad for an additional buck. But no Brussel Sprouts, Green Beans or any veggies at all, which I found a bit unusual. Yet the turkey was moist, the stuffing flavorful, and the piles of sweet and mashed potatoes bigger than my head. The gravies were served in those tiny plastic coleslaw-type containers, and were of the cornstarchy, gloppy variety. I did only eat half, and I accompanied it with a pretty bad martini and then a nice glass of wine. No dessert is included just like the regular menu. No pie for YOU! I think given the choice again of a not-at-home Thanksgiving dinner, I would repeat what I did last year, and just hit the hot table and salad bar at Whole Foods and cart it home. While I did take home half of my Fireside meal, I did miss the greenery, and I think if one is going out to a restaurant for Thanksgiving, it's more fun to save your pennies and do something special like The Drake or The Pump Room.

The sandwich was plain, but thank goodness I was able to dip it in the gravy which made it more appetizing. the mash was good due to the fact that it still had the potato skins in there. That's always a good sign that it didn't come from a box. You definitely need the gravy for these though, it's not good standing alone.  A girlfriend of mine order the meatloaf sandwich which is interesting to say the least. She didn't care for the meatloaf as it was 'watered down'. Another girlfriend had the broccoli with shells in a Parmesan cheese sauce and it was a huge portion. She said it was good and was not able to finish the whole thing as it was too big of a dish.  Our waitress was able to split the bill 5 ways which was very nice of her. Many places don't allow that since your party is considered too big.

When ordering my second beer, they found they were out of the one I had ordered earlier.

As much as the order was messed up, I would have given the Fireside a passing grade if the food was worth the wait and aggravation.  The food was not good, you get a better meal at Costco.  My wife's Tortilla Encrusted Tilapia was below Long John Silver standards.  My burger was bland and tasteless.  After I returned the burger for the Cheese and Bacon which the waiter initially forgot, it was delivered to me back with a cold piece of cheese casually placed on top.

2011-11-07,2.0,"My receipt from here tells me to support local business.  I am all for supporting local business - unless it's (at best) mediocre food and bipolar service.  I've been here many times since my girlfriend introduced it to me.  Three years' worth of visits.  It's tucked away by the graveyard, where I'm sure they sourced my latest waitress.  This last experience has finally spurred me to review this place from the sheer disbelief at the inconsistent service and unpredictable food.   Note: Mediocre food and above average service has consistently been observed during regular hours.  Terrible food and equally terrible service typically occurs late at night.  They have a full menu until they close in the wee hours of two or three.  Maybe they shouldn't try to do a full menu that late.  What they do not have is a decent wait staff later at night, as I only observed a single frazzled woman hell bent on maintaining her composure so as not to resort to stabbing her table guests in the eyes.  ""We all have bad days'"" I figured - I want calamari, let's be polite.  So in we go into what I will be my last venture here.  First, let me state that my waitress glared at us approaching the exterior patio and didn't verbally acknowledge my girlfriend nor myself as we walked towards the outside deck.  We passed her by, due to the need to get out of her way as she entered the kitchen.  Polite eye contact was met with the ""I am upset with being the only waitress for the outside area"" look.  Fair enough.  We get seated.  I asked a question about the menu.  She must have remembered the Seinfeld episode wherein George gets the middle finger from his waitress delivered through a supposedly innocuous facial scratch.  Lady, I'm onto you - but the look in your eyes tells me you already knew that.  What the hell is the matter with you? I would've forgiven this remarkable display of continued hostility, even when she later loudly slammed a baby seat atop a precariously stacked tower located directly adjacent to and above our table, were it not for the food.  I was mildly amused by her antics actually, as I knew I'd reference it here.  But the food was unforgivable.  I will tolerate shitty, stupid service for food of quality I cannot be bothered to prep or possibly create with my level of skill.  But I could've prepared the meal I paid for by deliberately failing in every basic cooking principle.  I paid for fucked up food, and that pisses me off. My rice was loaded with diced tomatoes and it was chewy.  Throw diced tomatoes on it! That'll doctor up overcooked rice.  I tried to ignore the rice with my vegetables that looked freshly picked from the cemetery nearby.  They were tough, cold, and soggy.  Freezer burned, or cooked in the microwave.  Probably both.  Strange mix of soggy zucchini and tough green beans that looked lifeless.  Brilliant way to tie in their location I guess.  The crowning jewel was the protein: a chicken that was feared to be a zombie evidenced by being cooked twice through.  Dry, flavorless, and sad.  The hamburger the SO had was also bland, dry (overcooked), and somehow managed to soak the bottom bun, which was evidently toasted.  How the hell that was accomplished I don't know.  The calamari was the only positive.  And it was forgettable. My girlfriend says the ambiance is nice, but she's been there since she was in the sixth grade.  So I guess memory flavors her palate - it doesn't mine.  Still, she concedes the quality here has steadily declined.  And from this most recent experience, the decline is accelerating to a plummet.  At least as far as the restaurant portion is concerned - so if you decide to go here, do so for drinks.  The people in the bar were having a great time.  I was jealous.  The music in there was good too.  In general, the drinks here are great or just way too strong on the alcohol.  Neither of which is a problem given the issues of some establishments banking on the placebo effect.   The $30 per person price tag you get for the whole restaurant experience (with drinks) is not OK.  I had better deals for similar, if not cheaper, cost near the loop at The Scout and Sable.  Jaded with this experience, I went to these places afterwards with the thought that it would be more expensive but have a higher standard.  I was half right.  l got better value/treatment for my money in River North and SoLo than Fireside; and I somehow spent less.",-0.9669,0.81,0.084,0.106,0.5171361387150861

2011-10-03,1.0,"This is my first and only negative review as I tend to give places the benefit of the doubt and feel that usually restaurants are actually looking to improve the quality of service for the customers, but I felt that Fireside is the rare exception to this, they don't care about customer experience and I felt like I needed to share this. My first experience in the dining room was mediocre. The service was a bit slow but I was catching up with an old friend and didn't mind so much. I order the chicken fingers because it came with a side and while the salad was fine, the chicken fingers were literally disgusting. I've never in my life had to send a meal back to the kitchen but these chicken fingers were inedible. They were burnt so bad, it looked like they had used oil that was bad and fried these suckers for days. I cannot believe the kitchen staff and then server both looked at that plate and actually put that on my table. I just explained to the waitress that I would not be eating that at all and would prefer chicken wings instead. She agreed with me and said it looked like they over fried the chicken fingers (well...why did you serve it to me if you knew it was disgusting?) and they came back with some much much better buffalo wings.  That experience I'll give a B-, the food was inedible but they fixed the problem in a timely manner and the server apologized. My second time was even worse. My family was in town and we decided to stop here for brunch one day. There was only one server for the entire dining room section of the restaurant (it was a bit slow when we arrived but picked up significantly and although they had food runners the server couldn't keep up and frankly looked like she either was hungover or just hated her  job). Two guests at my party ordered the mac & cheese with bacon but their dishes came out completely differently.  One macaroni came out with the consistency of soup and the other was fine. The one that was gross and runny was very unappetizing. He had to ask for extra plates to strain the macaroni himself. He asked the server for extra plates and while he didn't complain about the dish, he certainly made it apparent that he needed the extra plates to strain his own food. Now, I was a server for years and I feel that a server needs to be aware of problems in the dining room. Something like, ""Oh I'm so sorry about that, is there something I can do?"" .. or ANYTHING would have helped. She just got the extra plates and threw them down on the table. Normally my friend would have not complained (I've never seen him complain at a restaurant) but the dish was basically like pasta cheese soup and the server was being quite unpleasant at that point so he asked for the manager. The manager came over and said something like ""ohh I see. Yes that's not now it should be"" and ""Can I get you something else?"" At this point my friend didn't want anything else but he just wanted to make the manager aware that his kitchen was sending out less than adequate food and the server was impolite. The manager said that he was surprised that the server came across that way because she was one of the best he had and I mentioned to him that he might consider hiring better servers in the future. I do not think he took kindly to that hint but at that point, the whole experience was quite terrible and I was getting pretty annoyed. I've worked at many restaurants and the least the manager should have done was apologize (obviously), offer another dish as a replacement and if the customer declines, offer a free dessert or beverage (as it was brunch, maybe even a fruit plate)... however this guy did none of this and it definitely rubbed me the wrong way. His intention was not to get free food by any means when he asked for the manager, but when he didn't apologize even.. so unfortunate. I will not go back here because of the food (although my french toast was perfectly fine at brunch) but most importantly the staff that clearly doesn't care about the customers or customer experience at all. post review: Was the customer angry? No. Irritated and disappointed? Absolutely. My review was a carefully completed accurate description of my experiences there and please do not try to excuse the shortcomings of the restaurant by trying to negate my credibility. Should I have been more thorough in an explanation to you during the visit? Yes, I apologize, I was a bit put off and surprised by the lack of accountability you seemed to have. But you're aware of the entire situation now and this is how you choose to respond? Again, so unfortunate. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. We paid the entire bill, tipped 10%, as a former server I would NEVER leave a bill unpaid and never not tip because I know the server needs to tip out the bussers, no matter how horrible the service. How dare you say something so untrue and try to label me a liar when it's your business practices, professionalism, and clearly, people skills, that need serious help",0.9763,0.738,0.145,0.117,0.559041073474063

We ordered about 7:35ish (Eggplant Parmesan, three Salmons), and at 8:45 the food was still not at the table. Our server (Laura, who was awesome, by the way) apologized, and told us she was yelling at the kitchen. Finally, three of the four of our dishes came out, an we had to wait five more minutes for the last one. When I tasted my food (blackened salmon), i was immediately dissatisfied. It was very dry and overdone. I tasted my mom's (who ordered the same thing), and it was also dry, though she said it was ""fine"". (as an aside, the mashed potatoes were excellent, and the veggies were bland and cold.) Our waitress (again, awesome) brought me a menu, as I wasn't ready to give the salmon another chance, so I ordered quesadillas, which were just ok. As I was inspecting the quesadillas, a man came over, and introduced himself as Rich, the owner. He personally apologized for the wait on our food. He let us know that our meal would be taken care of (no charge) and apologized again. He said that he hoped we would give them another chance in the future. I was almost in shock. That is just amazing. To comp the whole meal? Wow. We tipped our waitress on what the food would have cost, as, again, she was really awesome (and it turns out, she brought the situation to Rich's attention to let him know, and, we found out later, also stood in the kitchen telling them she was not going to leave until she had our food.)

Last night I had a business dinner and was looking for a casual place with a good beer list, outdoor seating and potential low volume so we could talk. Enter Fireside on a Wednesday night, 8pm; after arriving and being greeted by colleges whom had already been waiting for ten minutes without so much as a hello or a glass of water, two servers with seven tables of people (I do think one was working inside as well) both ignored us and when we wen to the bar for drinks we were told our server would be right with us... we watched them have a mini chat off at their station for another five minutes until I got up to directly ask them for some service and was told that it'll be 'just a minute', she must have had to finish her story!? We picked up our belongings and went inside to the dining room that was 1/3 full with guests and every table that was large enough for 4 was covered with dirty plates and a mess, now we had to wait for someone to clean a table and could tell they were frightened by the sign of yet another party wanting dinner. We left for the bar area thinking we could at least have a beer and make plan b, same story we were ignored by everyone and when we finally did get someone to take our drink order she laughed at the name of the beer I requested and said there is no such thing ( a 400lb monkey by Left Hand brewing) and that I was funny. At this point she is lucky there were no bottles on our table, I held composure and showed her the beer listed on the menu and returned to business chat under the 50"" plasma with Justin the Bever blaring out of the sound system and kids playing video games next to out table.... I held on for a beer and was suckered in to sticking around because we were so hungry and appetizers were half off on Wednesday nights. Bonus. their signature crabcake had potential but was cold in the center and the fried calamari was a plate of mushy crap, but hey the beer was cold and the cubbies were loosing... status quo. Against better judgement we decided to stay for a sandwich and I tried the ribs again since last time I needed power tools to remove the charred meat from the bones, this time they were better, but still dry and over cooked and smothered with sauce to cover this up. The other sandwiches were good according to them... a chicken sandwich is hard to screw up. The final joke on us was that she gave us each separate checks and divided the appetizers into 1/4 shares, less the half off etc. None of us asked for separate checks, had we been transported in a timewarp bubble to FL. and having dinner with our grandparents and their friends at 5pm?

I have also had the mac and cheese which was very delicious.  The last time I went I tried the buffalo chicken salad which I was not a huge fan of.  I have a huge pet peeve when restaurants give you a salad with humongous pieces of lettuce that are overflowing the plate. It makes it so hard to try to cut it up and eat it.  You spend less time enjoying your food and more time preparing it.  I have taken my parents here for brunch also and they enjoyed it thoroughly. I would have to say one of my favorite things is the patio out back that is open all year.  Even during the winter.  It makes you feel like you are outside and makes me very happy on cold winter days!  I would definitely recommend this place because the food is consistently good and the staff is always so friendly and helpful!  They also have something on the menu for everyone.,0.986,0.746,0.183,0.072,0.6502873563218391

Getting to a table was quick and our order was taken very fast.  That's where the positives end.  One of the big selling features of the Fireside is the Sunday Bloody Mary Bar.  After paying for two Bloody Marys and receiving our Grey Goose over rocks, we visited the Bloody Mary bar to make our own libations--which normally is a real treat.  However, the Bloody Mary bar was a disaster and out of many of the ingredients that are typical to a Bloody Mary, like olives, pickles and a variety of other ingredients. We returned to our table and waited for our food while enjoying our drinks and conversation. Finally, after 30 minutes and no return visits to our table from our server, our food was brought over by another server.  We were pretty disappointed as we had been out of water, ice tea and Bloody Mary's for about 15 minutes at least (okay, we drink fast).  When the food was dropped off, we asked to see the manager. We ate our food, which was good and consumed our refilled waters and ice teas and sat in front of dirty dishes for about 15 minutes after eating.  Still not having seen the manager. Our server asks us if we have received our check, to which I replied no and not sure how she would have expected us to receive a check since she would have been the one to present it.  So, we waited about another 10 minutes for the check and still no manager.  She finally returns for the check and takes our money, at which time I inform her that we have been waiting to speak to a manager since our meals were served (still have our dirty dishes in front of us).   The manager finally makes it to our table and we share our disappointment regarding our service and how we may never return as a result.  He did comp our lunch and asked the server to return our money.  When returning the money, she told us that she hoped our day got better but did not apologize for us having such a terrible experience.

2011-02-04,2.0,"Immediately upon walking in we were welcomed with a cold shoulder. I have to get menus for ourselves. Then after we walk in, walks in some friends of the bartender. Needless to say 8-10 minutes later after chatting with her friends the bar tender comes and takes our drink order. Just over all disappointing service and felt like it was because my friend and I were not regulars or friends of the bar tender.  The food was subpar as well. Ordered a special on the menu... fried ""chicken"" BLT with fries. My buddy ordered the same thing because it sounded so good on the menu except he got mashed potatoes. Food comes out I get fries and so does my buddy. Hey..... I guess thats what happens when you DON'T WRITE ANYTHING DOWN. Maybe that was her showing two ""ratty"" looking construction workers (Construction Business Owners) how much better she was than us. On top of that the ""chicken"" was more like a chicken cutlet about a quarter inch thick if you figure the batter on it as well. The batter was as dark as a Guinness beer and tasted almost like a hushpuppy batter. Not what fried chicken is supposed to be like. The disappointment lasted well over an hour... not good for a couple of diet cokes and friend sandwiches at lunch time.  The only reason they got two stars was due to the huge beer selection and the neat atmosphere in the bar area. It reminded me of being in Ireland or England... two places where I have spent a lot of time in bars. I would give this place one more shot for the brunch that everyone talks about.

2010-11-26,5.0,"Fireside is probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago. However, I should preface this by saying I always order the same three items every time, so I can't speak to the caliber of probably 96 percent of the menu. But I figure when you've found the perfect combination of appetizers and pizza, you really shouldn't mess with it. For an appetizer, I like to start off with the Roasted Red Pepper Hummus. It's creamy, flavorful and not too spicy. It's served with toasted pita bread wedges (be sure to ask for extra pita; there always seems to be more hummus than bread). Occasionally, if I'm with three or four people, we'll order a second appetizer. I recommend the Calamari, which is served with cocktail and tartar sauces, as well as lemon wedges. Fireside recently redid its calamari recipe, and it is definitely an improvement. When I first started going there, the calamari was flaky and had too many access shards of fried stuff and not enough meat. The new and improved calamari uses a different batter that seems to coat the meat better and is less flaky.  For the entree, I always order the Shrimp Pesto Pizza and share it with the other people in my party. It's always a big hit. I seriously have dreams about this pizza! It's considered a ""white"" pizza since it doesn't have any tomato sauce and uses Pesto sauce instead. It has a thin crust that is topped with shrimp and mozzarella cheese. I always like to order a larger (14- or 16-inch) pizza, so we will have some slices to take home with us. The pizza is delicious cold or heated up in the microwave.  When I eat at Fireside, I also like to order drinks. They usually have a menu with seasonal cocktails, but I wouldn't recommend trying any of these. The seasonal cocktails are a little hit or miss. The drinks that come in the large goblets are usually pretty good, but the martinis can be too strong and oftentimes taste downright weird. I usually just order a Ketel and Cranberry, or I'll split a pitcher of their Red Sangria.  Besides the Shrimp Pesto Pizza, my favorite thing about Fireside is its back patio. It's a chilled atmosphere that's perfect to just kick back, relax and enjoy some cocktails and food. There are Christmas lights strung from railings and well-kept plants in containers on the wooden deck. It's a great place to hang out in the summer, but you can also dine on the deck comfortably once it gets cold outside because the patio area is tented and warmed with heat lamps.  There's a small parking lot next to Fireside, or there is ample street parking. I've never had trouble parking there.  I definitely recommend Fireside, even though I've only tried a small fraction of what its menu has to offer. Their Shrimp Pesto Pizza and chilled patio atmosphere are what keep me coming back, and I definitely suggest giving it a try.",0.9976,0.808,0.175,0.017,0.45767283221828664

2010-10-09,2.0,"Last night was not the first time I had been to this old west Edgewater neighborhood institution. It has a nice tucked away location with truly great outdoor seating, whether it be the seating out front along Ravenswood, or in their very nice back patio. Contrary to some restaurants who seem to think al fresco dining can happen anywhere - just toss a few tables and chairs out on a busy pedestrian street as the now defunct Charlie's Ale House did on Clark Street in Andersonville - Fireside really does this right. Fireside is a comfy classic Chicago styled sports bar - and promises to deliver good food from that type of institution. But I'd have to say INCONSISTENCY is what best seems to describe this place. I remember having some decent meals in the past, and I remember having some forgetful ones. Never anything horrible, but sometimes just okay. Last night was one such occasion - okay. And so Yelps 2 stars best describes this place for me. I am not running to come back. One thing they do really well - at times - are their burgers. Indeed a group of us had already decided to forgo our nearly cooked diner at home and run out for some great Fireside burgers. We arrived, sat in their great back patio, and knowing what we all wanted, we ordered immediately when our waiter came around for drinks. One of the great things here are the burgers that have the ""blackened"" treatment. I do wish I knew what they used to season the meat when they choose to blacken it.  So a friend ordered the Black and Blue Burger and I ordered a Louisiana take on a burger - both of which promised this treatment. Then we waited and waited and waited. After about 45 minutes our meal came. I had opted for fruit instead of fries (trying to be good). But they gave me fries. The plate presentation was a bit messy. My fruit did eventually come on the side when a server realized the error. The burgers were fine, but mine was on the very rare side of medium-rare, and neither of our burgers were blackened at all, kinda the reason we had come in the first place. I asked for a menu to reread what was promised, and brought it to our server's attention. He was very gracious, and offered free deserts for the kitchen screw up. A nice gesture, though I always wonder, why offer something we don't necessarily want - and we didn't in this case. Remember I was going for fruit in place of fries. In the end he docked two drinks from our bill, but the three of us left bummed. If you promise something, deliver what you promise. That is it. No one expects a sports bar to be like a 5 star French gourmet restaurant, but if you say something in the menu, if you promise one experience, and then you deliver another - your customers feel cheated. The burgers were okay - but nothing extraordinary and nothing that is going to drive me to come back anytime soon. Sort out your kitchen!",0.9968,0.809,0.155,0.037,0.4467908902691512

The beer selection was pretty generous, although most of their better beers are only in bottles. I have a thing about drinking bottled beer when I'm out. Why spend five dollars on a beer when I can go to Binny's and get a six pack for twice as much? I know, I know. It's all about ""the atmosphere"" but unless there are animated pirates on the walls or the place has a medieval decor wherein the wait staff speaks in ""thee""s and ""thou""s and refers to your girlfriend as ""m'lady"", I'm not too drawn by a place's atmosphere. But while their draft selection was dwarfed by their bottle menu, it was still pretty good.  Since I didn't feel like shelling out my own money for food, I decided to sneakily nibble off my coworker's plates while they went to the bathroom. You'd think this would be a garden variety pub grub place, but the food menu looked very generous and the value wasn't bad at all. And with their spacious outdoor patio, you could easily take a date there and tell her it's a restaurant. Besides, after enough pints of their Goose Island Green Line you could probably tell her it's Dorsia and she'll believe you.

2010-04-05,3.0,"Went here for Easter Brunch and overall the experience was okay. We had a large party, 20 people. We had made the reservation about a week before Easter and the manager assured us, it wouldn't  be a problem. We get there and we are in a section in the back, the tented area. It was nice that it was semi private, however we were short 2 chairs and it was pretty cramped. Some people had a hard time getting in and out to get to the buffet. What ended up happening was two people in our party had to sit in a separate section.  Food, eh...it was okay. It was Easter brunch, so they had a buffet going. Some of the things I liked was the antipasta salad, the popcorn shrimp, fried chicken and the bacon was really good. Super crispy. Things I tried and didn't like - eggs benedict with crab meat. The crab meat wasn't good at all. It had a funny taste to it and I'm not sure if that was actual crab meat, tasted more fishy to me. It was also annoying that for the cocktail sauce, they didn't have small bowls or anything to put your sauce in. Fried chicken, it was mostly thighs and breasts, huge pieces. Would have been nice to throw some smaller pieces in there. Didn't care for breakfast potatoes at all. Selection was okay. They didn't have much in terms of dessert. Brownies seemed stale, the cheesecake bites were good, but it wasn't homemade or anything like that. They were just those bites you could get at Costco. Service was pretty good. We did have a large party, but she kept checking on us, made sure we had drinks all the time and picking up our dirty dishes. It did take awhile for them to figure out our seating arrangement since there was so many of us and after 15 minutes of them trying to get chairs and fit everyone in, my little cousins grabbed a table in another section. Overall, it was an okay experience, I've had brunch/buffet with better food for the same amount of money. It ended up being roughly 28 a person for buffet, drink, tax and tip. I only ate like 4 items out of the selection they had so I didn't feel it was worth it. Had a fun time though because I was with family. The atmosphere is pretty nice though, parking is easy and the place is huge. Maybe it's better to go there for a drink or something, not a meal.",0.9944,0.793,0.165,0.042,0.5858154372860255

Once you ender the back room, you're in a much more open yet intimate barn like room decorated with high ceilings and frosty white christmas writing.

I received a menu of theirs in the mail a while back.  While having a movie night at my place I was trying to think of somewhere I could both get pizza and BBQ ribs from in the area.  Fireside happened to pop in my head (the advertisement mass mailing was successful). It's a plus that you can get $2 off an order of $15+ by either making your order over the phone or online (coupon name: Be Nice!; coupon code: FRS-$2-OFF).  However, it's a problem if their online Order Network website doesn't function and freezes on every other page... When we called up to place our order, the employee was friendly, but our orders were wayyy off: lots of BBQ sauce on the ribs instead of light sauce as asked for, no side of sauce for the ribs, the french fries were greasy and cold; not to mention that the website says lots of fries and I could count them all on three hands, and instead of having the pizza cooked well it was soggy and lukewarm.  Blame it on the cook, delivery time, or restaurant as a whole, I'm not pointing fingers just giving everyone else a heads up from my experience. In case you dare to see for yourself, delivery costs $3 and you must ask for plasticware and napkins to receive them (not a bad idea to stop waste and be more green, I must say).",-0.9338,0.898,0.028,0.074,0.47598039215686283

The bread was sublime, really. A simple loaf of white country bread, but it was just warm and included chunks of fresh mellow garlic in it. Very nice. The wine selection was sufficient and there were many other kinds of drinks, including many varieties of beers and unusual mixed concoctions. We were intrigued by the special appetizer of fried pickles, but weren't feeling adventurous enough, but we overheard another diner say they were surprisingly good. I ordered the turkey dinner which included 3 very thick flavorful slices of turkey breast, along with generous portions of yummy mashed potatoes and corn bread stuffing, covered with a tasty gravy. (Just realized they forgot the cranberry chutney.) Delicious and generous portions. My good dining mate Paul had the special Mardi Gras pasta,  shrimp and craw fish in a spicy white sauce over penne, was reported to be very good (and again, plenty of leftovers.) Desserts looked great but no room! Decor was a bit drabby/shabby before they turned down the lights.

It's a little on the expensive side, but at least after 2am, there aren't any other quality bars open north of Irving Park. I finally figured out what I don't like about the Fireside. It's the regulars. At first, the people who are there seem like quite a diverse bunch, but they have one thing in common- they're rowdy and loud, and some are quick to start fights. Not the crowd you'd expect at a place that isn't a dive. The Fireside just isn't comfortable, I'm on edge the whole time I'm there with an uneasy feeling.

The meatloaf sandwich I ordered arrived quickly, delivered by a waitress who was paying me more attention than the bartender.  She asked me if I needed anything and offered to refill my beer.  It was a little dry, but overall pretty tasty.

2008-07-31,3.0,"I was trying to think of how many times I've been to this restaurant, throughout the past couple of years, and there was one constant amongst every visit: One of my closest friends, Lisa, who loves it here. That said, I don't think I'd ever go here without her.  I remember when Lisa first came across Fireside, after seeing their menus scattered about the neighborhood's sidewalks throughout the seasons ...The biggest draw was their outdoor seating (like any plus within the city). It's true, their back patio is quite nice, covered (think: circus tarp) in case of rain (or sleet, it's Chicago), well-lit and the seating is somewhat comfy (think: metal/padded chairs). I've never dined inside + I don't think I ever would, it seems sort of cramped. The inside has those framed French ad posters that everyone calls ""vintage"".  I do like the location, though, somewhat secluded + unassuming.  Their food, the times I've gone, has always been somewhat consistent ...Considering there's really only two things I can order: the stir-fry + the portabella sandwich, both standard vegan fair + mediocre. Nothing truly memorable either good or bad. Their menu seems to cater to those with the run of the mill palates. It's like the lil TGIFridays that could w/ inconsistent prices. I do like that their stir-fry is light + served on a pile of fresh leafed spinach. They ""suggest"" ordering the side of ""seasoned"" rice, which I usually decline but ends up on my plate (like my visit, last night w/ Lisa + her husband Paul, in tow), regardless. It can be a bit bland, I asked for a side of balsamic, it never arrived ...Ah well, not everyone's a pepper.  The wait staff is nice but not as attentive given how busy this place can get ...Halfway through our meal, last night, our waitress magically appeared with a tray of desserts or as she put it ""the grand finale"" (standard: cheesecakes, chocolate cake, something with Kahlua) ...Lisa was still gnawing on her ribs, Paul's mashed potatoes had yet to be touched + I had given up all hope for any balsamic so was dousing my meal with pepper ...Dessert was the last on our mind. We declined, still on the main course.  They make an ok martini, though their prices on gin are a little off opposed to other places + the olives are the most standard of olives w/ pimentos. I will give them credit for really trying on their beer menu (I've had wines off of their wine menu, in the past, it's not bad ...Surprisingly somewhat well rounded + larger than you'd think. Equal reds/whites ratio) ...They do offer a mix of drafts, domestics throughout the world but there are a few beers that show someone who knows about beer (or secretly wants to be the Hopleaf) is behind such a list.  They were out of my first choice (Two Brothers Ebel Weiss) but had North Coasts' PranQster on special (A very drinkable Belgium, though I've always hated the name + the capitalized Q). My PranQster came in a Delirium Tremens glass which I found amusing.  I'll probably eat here again because well, Lisa is one of my best friends + I support her. That said, my birthday is coming up + if Lisa suggests Fireside, it's just not me (It's bad enough my birthday falls on Labor Day, this year).",0.9838,0.858,0.101,0.041,0.47666217430368385

I don't know, I guess I hit up the Fireside at the wrong time, late on a random weeknight. It appeared to be more of a bar than a restaurant. There were haggard looking people just sitting around drinking. When we walked in, the first thing to hit me was the extremely LOUD sound system just blasting the hell out of the Black Eyed Peas. No one greeted us, so I walked over to the bar and asked if we were supposed to seat ourselves or what? She couldn't hear me. Gee, do you think it's too loud in here? I asked again. Yelling it this time. She handed me a couple of menus and said something, but now I could not hear her. My girlfriend and I looked at each other and she said something to me, but I couldn't make it out. It was just too damned loud. Fergie and the Black Eyed Peas just blasting louder than ever! Well, we stepped back outside to talk about possibly leaving because of how loud it was. My ears were ringing like crazy at this point. We discussed going someplace else, but it was late, so I decided to just go in and order take out. So, I went back in and back up to the bar to order some food to go. I was holding my ears while looking at the menu and the bartender just kind of laughed. I tried ordering but she could not hear me clearly, so I just began pointing at things on the menu. She said a few things back to me that I couldn't really make out. I handed her my debit card not really knowing how much it was because I couldn't hear her. I didn't care, I just wanted some food to take home. Suddenly, a break in the music for about 5 seconds. I heard the bartender tell me that it'd be about a 15 minute wait. Then Q-tip or whoever it is that sings that annoying song from the Miller Light commercials starts blasting, ""there's a party over here, there's a party over here.........."" LOUD AS HELL!!!!  I waited the 15 minutes outside where it was quiet and gave my ears a rest. I went back in and grabbed the food and took it home.

2008-05-06,2.0,"My fiance, a friend, and I had dinner at Fireside last week. it had been recommended by numerous people, and I had heard about the place for years without stopping by. We'd been looking forward to it.  The place was huge. They have a large dining room, a large bar, and a large outdoor tented patio area. They weren't very busy so we got seated right away, and got a pretty good choice of where to sit. The beer selection is grand. There are a lot of microbrews and little known beers. They have all the regular massbrews too. The only problem was that the server was reasonably new and hadn't familiarized himself with a lot of the selection. This was easily forgiven as he was able to get the info we needed from the bartender quickly.  The girl ordered ribs. They were okay.  Our friend ordered beer. Just beer. It was fine.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich. In the darkness of the patio, it looked okay. I wasn't sure, but thought it may be a little off. Indeed it was undercooked (still pink in the middle). I knew it for sure after one bite. The texture was off and the inside was barely warm. I removed the bite I had taken from my mouth and returned it to the plate. When the server returned to our table about five minutes later, I told him of the problem. After he asked me a few questions on how I knew it was not cooked fully and confirmed that I did not want it replaced, he took the plate back to the kitchen with his apologies.  I called the restaurant later that evening, and talked to man who apologized, took my information, and told me the owner would be calling me back the next day. That day came and went without a call. I called the next day and talked to a manager who told me matter-of-factly that in sixteen years of working there she had never heard of anyone getting undercooked chicken from their kitchen. This struck me as slightly odd since another friend of mine, who orders delivery from Fireside on a regular basis, was vomiting and had diarrhea for a week after he recently ate one of their Cajun Chicken Sandwiches, and had called in previously as well speaking to a gentleman who didn't seem to care but told him that the information would be told to the manager.   The manager apologized, took my information, and said that she would pass it on to the owner who would then call me back.

The food has been phenomenal, but I have had the occasional overcooked dish. By occasional I mean probably 5 times in the 7 years I've been going there. The soups are to die for. Great salads too. A little history - the place used to be a boarding house for mourners. Rosehill Cemetary is across the street and those attending funerals would stay at what is now the Fireside if their journey home was a long one. If you go, notice how everything above the first floor is divided into two buildings - one was for women and one was for men. There was to be no fornicating while grieving!",0.8488,0.785,0.126,0.089,0.5525793650793651
2008-01-28,5.0,"My experience here was very positive comparing to others'. We went to Fireside on Saturday evening and wanted to sit in the restaurant section, and didn't even have to wait that long, maybe it was just our luck that some people were leaving right when we walked in. I have to say they probably make some of the best pasta around! I had the blackened chicken and pasta, and I don't know which I fell in love with more, the chicken or the cajun sauce for the pasta?! The portions are pretty huge though, so it might be a good idea to skip the appetizers, or if you are super hungry order a salad or something along those lines. Of course getting it to go is always an option. Parking can be little bit of a problem even though they have parking right next door, street parking isn't that difficult. The prices are, I think, pretty reasonable considering how much food you get. I really enjoyed dining at this place and will definitely go back for more!",0.9896,0.785,0.203,0.012,0.597599370326643

The two times I've been to Fireside have just been an all around dismal experience. First off there is rarely anyone manning the door even though there's a sign saying ""Please Wait To Be Seated"". So you stand there....and stand there and yep...stand there so more until...hey...someone finally walks by and sees customers standing there. Either hire a host or just make it a ""Seat Yourself"" type restaurant because nothing gets me pissier than having to wait in a restaurant that doesn't even have  a line!  Menu as I said looks great. They have all these tasty options that you just can't wait to try but when you do boy are you disappointed. Been there twice and none of the entrees that I've ordered or the people that have gone with me have ordered were memorable or even good for that matter.

As a native Michigander, I enjoy this street because it has a country-town feel in the middle of the city and the Fireside Lounge seems right out of a Michigan-summer-lakeside town. Everything felt familiar to me, from the dark woodwork to the local art crowding the walls.  I'm only giving them 4 stars because I stopped there spontaneously on a Sunday afternoon while on a bike ride with a friend. We only had a beer and an appetizer. They seemed a little apprehensive about letting us sit on the back patio since we were only ordering drinks, basically. But then they did because they weren't very busy. I didn't take it too personally because there was a sign about proper attire and I WAS wearing my biking clothes with grease smeared all over my shirt..... not exactly the nicest outfit. Like I said it was spontaneous. So anyway, I had a Blue Moon with an orange in it and the goat cheese marinara appetizer. Everything was fine! The servers did seem a little busier though, even though the tables were less than half full. They might have been a little aggravated that we didn't order more, but we were fast and easy.

2007-03-13,3.0,"Oh Fireside, why do you disappoint me so?  If I could give a separate review for brunch I would, because while there are many things to enjoy about Fireside, brunch is not one of them. What's great about Fireside are their pastas, sandwiches, thin crust pizzas (andouille, onions and jalapenos for me), cajun crawfish, beer selection, bartenders, delivery, and the fact that they are open every day of the year.  They also have a ""frequent diner"" sort of deal where you can earn points towards free stuff on a future visit. However.  I've made my third and last attempt at brunch.  Most recently I went with friends and was happy to see that they weren't overly crowded.  I should have guessed why.  While we were seated immediately and were brought coffee, our brunch order was held up in the kitchen for a long long looooooong time.  We were eventually told (4 refills of coffee later) that the kitchen was backed up.   When the order arrived it was clear that the Cream Cheese Apple Walnut-Stuffed French Toast that a companion and I ordered had been sitting for that long long looooooong time, and what was brought to me was a plate of cold french toast with a slab of cold cream cheese in the middle  Erm...no thanks.  I almost never send anything back but I decided I'd been waiting long enough that I did want to actually enjoy what I ate, and when it returned it was fresh and melty and perfectly acceptable.  Other brunch entrees were perfectly fine, neither good nor bad, just late. This is unfortunately not the first stumble in service or food quality I've experienced during brunch there.  Brunch seems to be an afterthought and not a focus at Fireside.  It's really not what they do best.  Stick to lunchtime and evening visits or delivery (they will also bring you beer), and show up on any day of the year.",0.9865,0.832,0.135,0.032,0.44761904761904764
2007-02-26,3.0,"Well, I've been coming to Fireside since way back when, and it is still my first bar of choice when my friends need to dine and drink. As a long time patron yes, I have seen staff come and go, and the different crowds have come and gone. But the food is still good and despite a few changes, the ambience is still the same. There are three parts to Fireside. A separate, smoke-free dining area, a bar, and an enclosed patio area. The dining area is perfect for relaxed dining or for those who want to enjoy food without smoke. The bar is great if it's not too crowded, and the patio excels at combining a little bit of both. On colder days, heaters scattered throughout the patio keep the place warm, though the person sitting closest to them will get broiled. Everyone should sit in the patio at least once during the fall or winter season. The blackened chicken with pasta is my personal favorite, along with the cajun spiced calarmi, which I think is a must as an appetizer regardless of where you sit. Steaks are hit or miss. If you must, go for the peppercorn fillet and avoid the NY strip. The fish is good. The sandwich selection mirrors the entree menu and should be considered if you don't feel like a whole meal. Avoid the pizza. It's not that great and I don't recommend spending money on it. Once we ordered a pizza and asked for extra cheese. The pizza came with 4 or 5 slices of half-melted American cheese ontop of the pizza. Not sure where our order got lost in translation, but the end result wasn't very appetizing. Drinks are reasonably priced, though depending on how busy it is, sometimes the waitstaff disappears just as you need them. At other times though, you barely put an empty bottle or glass down before a replacement drink is slid infront of you. Like any other place, your night will vary. The clientel ranges from the ""just turned 21 group"" to the ""I'm visiting from Rosehill"" group. For the most part, everyone keeps to themselves- and makes the bar perfect if you want to stick out the night with friends. Between the street and their lot, parking in the area is easy to find. Later in the night, there is usually a cab or two that linger around for fares to take home. All in all, Fireside is a solid place to goto. Pros: Laidback atmosphere, appetizers are good, drinks are reasonably priced, decent menu selection. Separate bar-dining area. Parking easy to find. No smoking in dining area. Smoking allowed in bar and patio. Cons: Service and food can be hit or miss. Avoid steaks and pizza. No smoking in dining area. Smoking allowed in bar and patio.

The atmosphere The food is so damn tasty (recommended: their chicken tenders cure cancer and the cream of mushroom soup was made by a descendant of Jesus- true story) the smoking  the back patio darts Awesome beer selection The bad: The people can get a wee bit scary Drinks are a little pricey (tip your bartenders ;) parking the juke box is always SUPER LOUD  The servers are SLOW. It can take a really, really long time to get your food or even someone to greet you My family has been going to this place for 20+ years. It is an established neighborhood place.

2007-01-17,4.0,"I LOVE this place!  It is so conveniently located to my house that I can walk there, so that may have something to do with my adoration, but there is definitely more to it than that.  I love the atmosphere of this place.  I have eaten/had drinks in all three sections of the restaurant and all of them have their own charm.   My favorite location in the Fireside is the patio.  It is such a cozy, lovely spot that I am always drawn to it first.  The patio's downside (or upside, if you're a smoker), however, is that there is some smoking allowed there, but it's not so overwhelming.  Worse than this, the service can be painfully slow at times on the patio.  You see, the service is Fireside's greatest weakpoint.  But, I'll get to that.   My second favorite place to eat there is in the bar, because I like the atmosphere there, but it DEFINITELY gets too smokey for me sometimes, so it's pretty iffy.  The last place I'll go is the regular dining area.  It is quaint and completely smoke-free, which is great.  It also feels a little more family-oriented, though, so sometimes it's not what I want -- especially if there are kids there (I don't like eating with kids that are maniacs). The service is best in the dining room, then the bar when it's empty, then the patio.  Or, reverse the patio and the bar if the bar is full.  The service from the waitstaff is not overly warm a lot of the time, but I haven't found it offensive.  It gets the job done usually, but at times the service on the patio is awful to the point that you might find yourself getting up to find someone to take care of things at your table.  In fact, that is why I do not give this place a full 5 stars.  I get the feeling that the Fireside is not terribly well managed.  The bartenders, unlike the waitstaff, are usually really, really nice.   The food is good enough and it is served until 3 AM -- hooray!  If you want to save a couple of dollars, get the pizza and split it.  It's pretty good (not awesome).  I think the prices are a little higher (on their non-pizza food) than I'd like, but you do get a ton of food when you order, so I think it's well worth it. In sum, the Fireside rocks my world, but this is primarily the result of the ambience.  It's a fun place, with nice bartenders and functional waitstaff.  Be prepared to use your patience if you go at a busy time (Friday or Saturday night).  DO check out the patio.  I think this is a place that everyone should see once.",0.9988,0.731,0.228,0.041,0.6083760683760685

2006-10-31,3.0,"I've been going to Fireside for YEARS now - and there are times where it is hit or miss.  We love going to the bar side at nights - the clientele are always nice and  definitely live it up.  When we have our daughter with us, we like the quiet dinner room instead.  I was there on Sunday for brunch and while it was moderately busy the they seemed to be too lightly staffed.  Not to the fault of our waitress who was juggling multiple tables, but I think the staffing could have been handled better.   Once again - it's hit or miss - I have been there where I couldn't get our server to stop checking in on us, and I have been there when we couldn't find our server cause they were just worn thin.  Food - Like the service - the food can be hit or miss sometimes, especially the steaks.  I've been there when they make it just perfect, and I've been there when it's just over cooked, or just doesn't have any flavor.  A couple of things that ALWAYS remains constant - the black chicken over pasta (personal favorite) and the calamari (always get that when we're sitting at the bar).  Drinks - While the food is good - the drinks are better.  They have a good selection on tap, and a very diverse selection on bottle.  Their mix drinks are still the best (both in price and potency).  Overall - I love this place - even for all their faults because of the memories attached to this place.  I would normally give this place a higher rating, but the problem is their lack in consistency in service and food.",0.9756,0.784,0.141,0.075,0.554
2006-09-15,3.0,"Fireside really deserves a 2.5, but I rounded up because I think I may just have had a series of subpar experiences and I know this place used to be great.  Neither their food nor their service is consistent.  And lately, its been on the not-so-good side.   They've got a nice bar area, a separate dining area with a fireplace, and a year-round outdoor dining area.   Their menu is pretty big, with a little something for everyone.  My favorite items?  The baked brie appetizer and the Sportsman Surprise pizza (blue cheese, pesto, spinach, broccoli & onions).   They offer a bunch of coupons, including a $2 off (order $12 or more) if you are nice.  Great way to reinforce good behavior.  They also give you the option to order online from their website and will give you 10% off your order for doing so.   I'll try 'em again, but if it keeps getting worse, there's no point in going back.. unless maybe its 2am and I really want beer & pizza.",0.9841,0.772,0.191,0.037,0.5382352941176469
