Service isn't super friendly as well.. either stern or emotionless.  The 1st visit I got the chicken salad sandwich and open up to see a fruit fly having a grand time in the lettuce. The 2nd visit was bc a friend stopped by and wanted something simple. He got the soup of the day and one of their bread pastries, ok! The most recent visit... I got the basics of all, grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup.  Grilled cheese was nothing special. 2 piece bread and layer of melted cheddar cheese, okay. Can't go wrong with that. A couple bites into my chicken noodle soup I find an egg shell. An. Egg. Shell. Why the heck would there be an egg shell?! Clearly it's either by the disposable or they're just careless when making their sandwiches and soups. Ugh.  Would I return? I tried. Never again.",0.6329,0.811,0.106,0.083,0.6308441558441559

I was sitting on the side watching fruit flies inside their pastry cabinet just hanging out with their bakery items... Fire the burger is inside a pita, which actually makes it easier to eat in my opinion. Well it had a strange smell... I took a small bite to play t safe and out it went!! I got a feeling these were frozen burgers from Walmart! It was disgusting! It's far from fresh! Makes me question all their food.  At this point I'm starving! I attempt the fries which are actually great! Perfectly crispy! I dip into the ranch I paid 59 cents for to realize it's expired ranch. Disgusting.  I will never ever return again.

2017-03-05,3.0,"We're visiting Chicago on a combo work/pleasure trip this weekend. Our hosts took us to Brett's for breakfast because it was close to the office.  First item of importance was coffee! Unfortunately, we were disappointed. The simple ""cup of coffee"" was good although I'm always disappointed when a sit-down cafe serves coffee in paper cups. The disappointment came when my spouse asked for a decaf... ""we don't brew decaf on the weekend"" was the response. How about a decaf espresso drink, then? ""We don't have decaf espresso."" Kind of a bummer... The selection of baked goods was nice. Several types of breads - both sweet and savory - and various pastries. The banana bread was moist and had a nice flavor.  I ordered the special -  Huevos rancheros. Interestingly I was given the option of tortillas or cornmeal waffles. I decided to try the waffles. I was initially surprised at the simplicity of the dish when it was served. Eggs on waffles with a tablespoon of black beans, Pico de Gallo,  and guacamole. While the dish had a nice flavor, it was somewhat dry. The waffles needed something to add some moisture to the dish... not sure what, I'm not a chef!, but something.  Would I go back? Yeah, probably. Give it a try - it was busy so I imagine that their food is probably pretty good overall.",0.9518,0.835,0.124,0.041,0.6013650793650794

I like that they offer sweet potato fries and regular fries. I don't go to deli's too often, but I usually see chips as a side and no fries. I love fries so I was super happy. They have a good sized menu of burgers, sandwiches, soups and sides. They do breakfast, too. It's a good place to go because they have a big enough menu to cater to what food you feel like eating. I got the tuna melt. It was a tall sandwich! There was a very good amount of tuna on it, but I wanted more cheese. It didn't exactly melt over the tuna since it was one slice over a mountain of tuna.

However, my experience today further underscored why I don't go often.  For those new to the area, this is a diner-like atmosphere. With a grill and two to three people working the grill.   When considering cost, quality and service - there is much to be desired. Service has been consistently poor. They have a ticket process.  When you place and pay for an order, you are given a number that is included in a ticket. The order feeds to a ticket machine that the cooks (they are by NO stretch of any imagination - chefs) pull to begin preparing your meal. Naturally, 11:00 a.m. -1:00 p.m. is part of the lunch hour and the busiest. I came in AFTER the lunch crowd. Placed and paid for an order and then began to wait. Waited some more. Waited more. While another customer's spouse ate half a sandwich and THEN realized it was chicken and not tuna as she had ordered -__-  They prepared her another sandwich, this one with tuna.  And again, I waited. And after 40 minutes got part of my order while they waited on fries. Really. 40 minutes for a simple sandwich. And the cook acted like he was irritated with me for having a different ticket number than the order he prepared for someone else who - obviously gave up waiting.  This is not the first time they've either ignored my ticket that came through the machine or pretended that there was a mix up with the register.  No. The mix up is with the cooks behind the counter.  I can go into any number of reasons why this occurred but will leap to solutions. 1. Improve the back end process of how orders are received by the cooks. Either have a crew chief who directs what orders are handled by who OR 2. Set up an electronic system that projects the next order on a display screen. But I guess I'd have to walk the green mile to McDonalds for that.",0.351,0.917,0.047,0.036,0.37388969055635735

When he asked for his money, he quoted $7.50, which I paid. I turned to leave and it suddenly occurred to me that wasn't the price listed on their site. I returned to the counter, politely pointed that out, and he motioned to the overhead blackboard and said $7.50 was the price listed there.

I ordered the tuna salad sandwich and their Soup of the Day, Chicken Tortilla. The food was ready within 2 minutes, but the chef decided to make an omelet, warm up some biscuits before placing my sandwich and soup into a bag for me. There wasn't a line, it wasn't during the lunch hour, so there was no reason for the 10 minute delay. I brought the food back to work and dove into the soup. The small soup costs about $4.50, which is pretty pricey in my eyes, and the size was pretty standard, about fist high and palm wide. The soup wasn't bad, although the chicken was flavorless and incredibly dry tasting. The tortillas were pre-added to the batch, so they were already soggy, not the texture I expected. As for the sandwich...it was terrible. The piece of lettuce was all dried up and and on the verge of spoiled. The tuna salad was some of the driest I've had, and completely lacked flavor. To through more insult to injury, the tuna didn't even cover the surface of the bread, almost 1/3 of the bread top to bottom was missing tuna salad...and they gave me two (2) quarter sized tomatoes', 1/4"" thick, stacked on top of each other right in the middle. It's not difficult, especially for a deli, to make decent tuna salad, spread it across the entire bread, have some fresh lettuce, and two normal sized 2"" tomato slices spread across the area of the sandwich. This wasn't just bad, it was lazy...and it all cost me $12.50. What a ripoff!

I ordered a grilled portabella on a pita and  the hummus was oozing out of it and not all of the ingredients were even in the pita.  On another time, I ordered a grilled turkey sandwich and it wasn't grilled all of the way and the turkey was very dry.  Just a miserable experience for the price.   what is worse is that you leave with a smell that stays on you for a long while! I work nearby and my coworkers can always tell by the scent when someone has been to brette's.  we will not recommend guests to the place and I will only go again if I am desperate.

2011-08-06,5.0,"A quick update on Brett's, which has become my number one lunch location in River North. Here are some insider tips from a regular: The daily special is always rotating, and the only thing that is set in stone is Thursday, which is always Sloppy Joe day - the best day of the whole week! I go every Thursday, and I love it so much I even created a little song and dance that I sing when I order ""It's Sloppy Joe Day Mother Truckas."" The staff humors me with this, and even asked for their picture with me, when I came in wearing the ""It's Sloppy Joe Day Mother Trucka"" t-shirt my co-workers had custom made for my birthday.  I usually get my Joe with the fries, but occasionally will get it with the coleslaw, and just dump the slaw right on the sandwich, adding a cool, crispy crunch.  I also have been known to top my Joe with cheddar cheese and a bag of Fritos I snag at Walgreens next door. If I get the urge for Brett's on a non-Thursday, I usually opt for ""the Dago."" This non-menu item is the specialty of the line cook Dago (pronounced Dah-go, and hopefully spelled right. I know that this spelling is also how you spell the ethnic slur, which is absolutely NOT what I am going for.)  it is basically a Mexican chicken sandwich, with a twist. You can also order his breakfast sandwich, which is pretty good too. Their 1/2 pound cheese burger is currently my favorite hamburger in town (next to Kuma's, which to be fair shouldn't really be compared to a regular burger anyway since it usually has so many unconventional ingredients piled on top!).  It is just a delicious, no frills, mouth-watering, delicious burger. My boss and I get these about once a month, eat it so fast it's like swallowing it whole, and then go into a beef coma for the rest of the day. Also, I want to confirm the other reviews - the Banana bread is shockingly good. Very moist and delicious! Well worth it. The only downside to Brett's is that their close time of 4PM is a bit deceptive. There have been a number of times I've stopped by or called in an order around 3:30 and they've told me their grill is shut down for the day.",0.9951,0.803,0.166,0.031,0.5050125996934508

The reuben was good, not the best one in the city or even the loop but a good one.  Personally I think Eppy's or Paramount Room has a better reuben for just as good of a price. If I'm over near Brett's again I'll give it a try. They had a great menu, at a good price and friendly service.

Don't go around noon though, hold out for an off-hour eating time... because it'll be far too packed otherwise. I cannot stand being crowded and confused by the seething masses of sammitch-seekers. Another gripe of mine about Brett's is their traffic flow, which is completely related to my distaste with crowds. The way the line is set up, you order from the beginning of the sammitch counter then proceed backward toward the drinks. The problem with this is that when it is crowded... it gets difficult for the employees to tell who's who and who's been waited on. I often have the problem where someone who came in well after me gets waited on before me because of this traffic flow issue. This is a problem that needs fixing. People should order sammitches at a particular point toward the back of the restaurant. Then they proceed forward and progress toward the cash register, rather than proceeding backward into the restaurant and then having to loop back around to continue onward toward the cash register.
