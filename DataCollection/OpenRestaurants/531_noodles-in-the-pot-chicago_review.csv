2017-05-27,4.0,"Since I live close by, I ordered takeout from here and found it tasty, packed neatly, and swiftly made. The Thai rolls are bundled tightly in rice paper and stuffed with shrimp, chicken, crabmeat and mint leaves. The dipping sauce is a light mixture of peanut and sweet/sour sauce that enhanced the fragrance of the rolls instead of masking them with a thick paste. The Larb Salad was a favorite of mine due to the acidity of the lime juice mixed with minced chicken, onion, hot peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes.  The lime juice kept the chicken fresh and bright. For my spicy entree I had the Chicken Supreme, filled with chicken, carrots, baby corn, napa cabbage, straw mushrooms and hot chili paste. I love chicken, baby corn, and hot chili paste, so this dish was just what I was looking for! The Dumpling Noodles is served with clear broth and I really appreciated how the restaurant packaged it; the broth was separated from the other components so I was able to add as much or as little as I wanted. The stuffed shrimp dumplings and BBQ pork were much larger pieces than I expected and the broccoli, bean sprouts and thin egg noodles were crisp and fresh. I chose sautéed shrimp for my Rama Special, to change it up, and mixed with peanut sauce and steamed broccoli, it was so refreshing! I generally go for light creamy sauces, but I'm diggin' the darker sauce here. Overall, the proteins here are served in large portions, the sauces are savory, and the prices are fair.

It's a mediocre Thai restaurant- the kind of place where you order your food, and three minutes later, it arrives.  If Thai food has become deeply standardized and dull, Noodles in the Pot is a cut below your average Thai place with soggy pad thai and frozen shumai. Everything tastes the same, which is of nothing, and all of the dishes are filed with cheap filler veggies (big chunks of carrots for no apparent reason, for example). The only plus is that it's cheap (and I think for most of the patrons, the real plus is that it's BYOB.)  The added plus is that if you're going to a show at Victory Gardens, Noodles in the Pot's speed will ensure you are there on time.

We stood in the doorway for a while; so, we sat ourselves...and again waited. Still no acknowledgment. Finally I caught the attending of a waitress asked for a menu but then the waitress proceeded to scold me about how I was not to sit myself. She beraided me! I was astonished! Anyway, the outdoor space had a great feel and the BYOB is a great plus to keep things on the cheap end. When we inquired with that same waitress about gluten-free food for my girl friend, she said ""I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING."" Seriously? That's Insane!!! Who says that?!!? We got a soup and a salad which were gluten free. The pork soup was great, beef salad was gross! I had pot stickers, which were delicious. Then our entrees then arrived (beef salad and stir-fry). They did not clear the old plates out of the way, just slammed down the entrees and slid them across the table pushing the old plates out of the way as we ate from them. REALLY!?!? I offered the completed plates to the server WHO WALKED AWAY FROM ME. I was appalled. As for the ginger chicken stir-fry, it was bland. Very boring and cookie-cutter. I've had much better. As for my bubble tea, it never arrived! BOTTOM LINE: This is a no-other-option take out place, or the BYOB place where you just don't care about food or service because your deep into your B.",0.9697,0.749,0.149,0.101,0.6259259259259259

(I see some reviewers liking it... I'm assuming they've never had a real spring/summer roll.)We couldn't finish them. They put cream cheese in it, didn't use the usual rice paper to roll the roll, and it had a gravy-like sauce (tamarind sauce, a really sweet tangy fruit) which I think is supposed to be their spin on the usual peanut sauce that goes on spring rolls. It's an interesting take on spring rolls, but it was just a bunch of fun flavors and ingredients I normally like, but better suited in other dishes. For sure it was made with great, fresh ingredients... It just did NOT flow together. (Tamarind and cream cheese?! Cream cheese in a spring roll?!)

This is also very delicious and comes with broccoli, white rice, meat of choice (I always get chicken), and a great peanut sauce of perfect consistency. I like to leave enough sauce, after I eat the chicken, to pour on my rice.  As for service, I've never really had a bad encounter here that I can recall (I've been coming here for at least 15 years). The staff is attentive but not annoyingly so, and are always ready to refill your water when you start to get low. The food comes out pretty fast, so if you are in a hurry for lunch or dinner, this might be a decent option for you. The prices are very reasonable as well, especially on weekdays at lunch time (which ends at 3pm).  With the lunch specials, the prices are much cheaper and you get a small appetizer of your choice that comes with your entree.

2015-09-01,3.0,"Was looking for another Thai option near my house and heard a couple people mention Noodles in the Pot as a good option. Although Noodles in the Pot has a great outdoor seating area with nice lighting, I don't think I'll be headed back. The highlight of the meal was the chicken satay appetizer. I know, it's so standard, and yes it's standard chicken satay, BUT the amount of chicken you get is huge and they serve you a small plate full of great peanut sauce. $8 for a chicken satay appetizer may seem like a lot, but when you're getting that much food, it suddenly seems great value. I love spicy foods and found their curry options to be lacking. They really only have panang curry and green curry. I've been on a massamun curry lately even though panang or yellow curry are my favorites. Needless to say, I got the Panang curry which they serve in the form of Panang Noodles. I expected the crispy noodles and they were fine, but what i didn't expect was that the noodles came on a plate! Of all my years of eating asian foods, I've never seen curries like that come on plates. The whole point of panang noodles is that the crispy noodles get softer as they soak up the curry sauce. Instead Noodle's crispy noodles just sit on a plate over a thin veneer of sauce. The sauce itself was good, the dish could've used a bit more chicken and a bit less noodle I think but it needed to come in a bowl.  The service was also very poor, they just looked understaffed. They had two people serving the entire outdoor area and some of the indoor tables it looked like. Twice the servers tried bringing us the wrong food which we almost wanted to take given how long it took to actually get our food.  Overall it's just 3 stars but I don't expect to return.

So when she learne we were coming to town, she said we had to have dinner. So we did. She and her daughter (Hi Kadyn!) are vegetarians, and my family is quite ferociously carnivorous. So, we had to find something we could both eat. Her solution was this really neat little Thai restaurant. My family likes Indian and Chinese, but we had never had Thai food. But we are up for it, and away we go. One quick little train ride and a couple of blocks of walking, and bam! Noodles in the Pot. I was dull, and had the Pad Thai with Chicken. Yummy! Now that I write this, I don't recall what my wife had, but it was a bowl of noodles and broth and it was really good, too. The boys both went for pad thai as well. Service was good, and pretty quick considering the place was packed and had several large parties (we were six, and there were three larger groups than ours).  Anyway, my youngest son is now a pad thai fiend. In the last month we have had Thai food three times. And that's what I have to say about Noodles in the Pot. It got at least one Texas teenager hooked on Thai. We all enjoyed it, and the restaurant was clean, the service quick and friendly, and the prices not bad (for Chicago, y'all... I want to say we got out for all six of us at about $100, with no alcohol).",0.9937,0.806,0.161,0.032,0.43384311091207634

2014-09-19,3.0,"Chicago -- of all the wonderful things you have, Thai food is not your strong suit, but yet there's so much of it to offer. I took a Pad See Ew to-go -- almost $11 -- and rushed home on the Blue Line so I could eat it in the comfort of my home. I dumped everything out of the white paper bag and thought there must be some hidden compartment, some magic trick to the bag, because certainly there was more than this small container of noodles. ""Alright. That's cool. Stay positive. 600+ reviews. Stay positive."" I didn't stay positive for long. I consider Noodles in the Pot to be riddled with what I call Yelper's Bias. Yelper's Bias is a fascinating idea. It's when a place gets lots of good reviews due to a combination of factors, such as being in the right location (thus getting the most Yelper traffic), not having terrible food (removes the risk of getting 1-2 stars), and/or being reviewed by innocent Yelpers who just might not know any better (Midwest folk reviewing Asian food). Well, I'm here to spit the truth, Chicago. There's gotta be better Thai food than Noodles in the Pot, there must be. In my month of moving up here from Houston, I've been to 3-4 Thai places. None of them have been above average, and I'd say Noodles in the Pot is below it. I'll let you know when I find good Thai in Chicago.",0.9851,0.768,0.165,0.067,0.5063852813852814

She called the night before to confirm her reservation and was told we were good to go for 7:30pm. However, they then called her back (they actually called the wrong number) the day of the party and weren't able to get a hold of her. So we lost our reservation and ended up waiting 45mins in the tiny entranceway. Of course making our way through tons of alcohol in the process.  When we actually sat down, the server Lex was awesome. She was great about bringing out extra cups, napkins, etc. She even threw in a complimentary appetizer when 2 were accidentally brought out.   Let's talk about the food. Delicious. We had the shrimp spring roll appetizer and the super sampler appetizer. Everything was fresh and delicious. The main courses at our table were pad thai, cashew chicken and green curry. Was I blown away by the pad thai, no. I personally like thai bowls pad thai better. But this was decent pad thai. The green curry wasn't spicy at all (which I had hoped) and was a bit bland. The cashew chicken was flavorful and well done.

2013-02-01,5.0,"One of my girlfriends has been raving about this place forever. I finally made my way over there last Friday after work. It's an easy walk from the red line and street parking looked plentiful for a Friday night. It's BYOB but I went during my ""I'm not drinking"" time of the year so I missed out on that joy. LOL. Our server (never got his name) was adorable. He probably wouldn't want to be called adorable but he was so sweet and patient. My friends were joking me because I liked him so much! But hey... good service wins me over. So my friend who dies for this place recommended a bunch of dishes but again, during my ""I'm not drinking"" phase, I also wasn't eating certain yummy foods like anything fried, red or pork related. Nevertheless, the other options were great. For appetizers, my friends ordered the chicken satay and steamed shu mai. I tasted both and they were good. Not spectacular, but decent. I also don't eat peanut sauce so I'm not the best person to say whether their chicken satay was on par or not. For dinner I ordered the green curry with shrimp, one friend had either the pad see eiw or pad khee mao with beef, and my other friend had the bamee noodles. Literally, no food was left on anyone's plate! I didn't taste the pad noodles but my friend obviously loved it. I tried the bamee noodles and I was soooo surprised at how tasty they were... and they didn't have a sauce or anything on it but it had a sweet kind of flavor that was delicious. The rest of the dish had fried wontons and pork in it, so I didn't taste any more but again, my friend devoured it all on her own! The next time I go back I'll probably order that... just off the taste of the plain noodles, the rest of the dish has to be good. I absolutely loved my green curry too. They definitely didn't skimp out on the portion size or the amount of shrimp. I can't stand when places do that... give me like 4 shrimp... ridic... but not this place, I had so many left over. I thought twice about saving some as leftovers but it was too good not to finish right then and there! So... I have to give it to my girlfriend for recommending Noodles in the Pot. We're going back SOON. And I'm going to bring a bottle of wine and eat all the pork and fried wontons my little heart can handle. =)",0.999,0.716,0.249,0.035,0.5381448412698413

I had just driven from Detroit to Chicago and was feeling like eating something light after sitting in the car for about 4.5 hours. My friend and I searched Yelp to find this place, and the stellar reviews proved to be true. Every other Tom Kha soup I've had was more of a mildly flavored broth with a minuscule amount of vegetables, it was a good meal starter, but not very exciting or satisfying. The Tom Kha from Noodles In the Pot is excellent, and if you add the shrimp, it can be a full meal on it's own, a sweet, savory, and spicy full meal. There is a good amount of perfectly steamed fresh vegetables including tomatoes, mushrooms, baby corn added to a most delicious coconut broth with a touch of lime. I couldn't get over how delicious this soup was, and what I had been missing out on all of these years.  We were both so impressed by the meal, and I was craving the soup, so we returned the next day for another tasty go of it. The pricing is great, considering the soup is only either $4.50 or $5.50 with shrimp, and it's BYOB. All of the other noodle and curry dishes are under $10, and each entree is way more food than one person can eat.

2012-04-05,4.0,"My sister raved about this place, saying she's dreamed about eating the food!  Of course, we had to go there for dinner when we came for a visit! We started with appetizers of Spring Rolls and Crab Rangoon to share. The Spring Rolls were excellent, but it was a bit strange to have them cold with warm sauce. However, the tamarind sauce was fantastic, so it made it worth it. The only thing I would modify is that there were a bit too many sprouts.  The flavor of the Crab Rangoon was good, but I still prefer my hometown Chinese restaurant's version a bit better. I appreciated the amount of crab meat in them, but I was not a fan of the added chicken. However, the sweet & sour sauce was so wonderful. Luckily my mom was smart enough to save it, as it helped to add flavor to her meal later. Overall, I would recommend both appetizers, but if you have to pick one, go with the Spring Rolls. For my entree, I went with one of my sister's recommendations, the Pad See Ew, substituting the thin rice noodles for the wide ones. I cannot say anything bad about the dish. It used the same sweet & sour sauce that was given with the crab rangoon, which was a-ok with me. 100% recommendation on this. My sister had the dish of her dreams, the Chicken Coconut Curry. I personally hate the taste of curry, so for me, this dish was doomed, but I did try it, and either the curry flavor was very mild or the coconut softened it up enough (or both), and I didn't completely hate it. If you like curry, I would definitely go for it as my sister doesn't dream about food very often. It also came with cucumber salad, which had a very light, but yummy marinade.  My mom was not very hungry, so she decided just to get a side of Steamed Vegetables. There was no sauce added, so they were a little bland to me, and I didn't like the mushrooms at all, but my mom added her saved sweet & sour sauce and that helped a lot.  I tried the Gingerale for drink, and it was very light and tasty, but not quite as satisfying as your standard gingerale.

There was basically one guy working and we were the first to get seated before it started to get busy. Our server was just very cold and impatient when we were asking questions about a couple of the menu items...  At one point, he actually cut me off from asking my question because he assumed that he knew what I was going to ask...  Overall, he was a bit short... Food: Pad See Yu : it was a little TOO sweet Pad Kee Mao: a little bit on the saltier side Thai fried rice with chicken: Very delicious! Just perfectly seasoned. Panang Noodles: I got it with steamed noodles instead of fried noodles. The noodles were cooked perfectly, not too over done.  The sauce could have used a bit more curry and could have been a bit more spicy. Thai Iced teas were way too thin and seemed a bit flat in flavor. I think it wasn't  that fresh, which may explain the lack in flavor? Also, they pre-sweetened the tea with sugar and then add milk to it when serving... which explains the super sweetness and the thin texture... I think the norm at other Thai places is that they pre brew the thai iced tea and then add sweet condensed milk when serving. I think the sweet condensed milk adds that rich texture to the iced tea which you won't get by using just regular milk.  I'll probably be back and just address the specific adjustments for each dish to my liking... and just expect to get a rude service... nonetheless, will probably be back when I'm craving thai food and I'm in the area.",0.9789,0.845,0.112,0.042,0.5071978021978022

For me, I can usually tell how much I'm gonna like a thai place just on how well they do noodles. And yea, the noodles were very good.

Both of the appetizers were good as well. The shrimp dumplings were pretty good, but this was one of the better chicken satay's that I've had.

2011-05-23,1.0,"For the past 4 years, Noodles in the Pot has been my FAVORITE thai place in Chicago. Their beef pad see eiw, spicy basil chicken, and green and panang curries are incredibly addictive. Since I moved to Chicago 4 years ago, I've frequented Noodles in the Pot on a weekly basis, sometimes 3 or more times a week...sometimes even twice a day! I've brought countless friends and family members to eat there and have gotten them hooked as well. I am without a doubt one of their most loyal customers.  HOWEVER... While I love their food, their customer service is apalling and offensive. Since I am a regular customer, they know my usual orders and recognize me when I come in. I should also add that I am nothing but friendly, polite, and I tip them generously. Most businesses (especially small ones) treat their ""regulars"" very well...because those are the type of people that keep their business thriving. Well, not Noodles in the Pot.  I always order my dishes ""extra, extra spicy"", and my request is typically ignored. So, I've started asking for a side of dried chili flakes so that I can adjust the heat myself. Pretty reasonable request, I would say. Half of the time they put them with my order without me asking, half of the time they don't. So on multiple occasions I have had to request them (and I am SUPER nice about it!) when I come to pick up my food, and I am always treated disrespectfully. Usually, they roll their eyes and me and their demeanor changes drastically (as if I've asked them for something really ridiculous!) and they rudely toss them to me and walk away. However today, the manager came out and chewed me out in front of the entire restaurant for asking for a side of hot peppers...telling me that next time they would charge me. SERIOUSLY??? For a tablespoon of pepper flakes that should have been added to my dish like I had originally asked them to?? #1, it was really embarassing. #2, I asked the guy who was ringing me up if I could have them very nicely...and he comes out with the manager! #3 IT'S YOUR JOB AS A SERVER AT A RESTAURANT TO PROVIDE REASONABLE SERVICE WITHOUT MAKING YOUR CUSTOMERS FEEL GUILTY.  Additionally, they have recently started to noticably skimp on portions (filling the container of food less than halfway), leave out ingredients, and have been rude to me about asking for extra utensils. And I have never once complained.  Today was the last straw. Get real Noodles in the Pot. I'm incredibly disappointed as I have been a faithful and loyal customer.

2011-05-07,4.0,"First things first: Let's talk about the BALLS in the pot, not the noodles. I quenched a craving for bubble tea the other day (yes, they deliver!) and have to note that I've never come across such small balls of tapioca. Verdict? I'm into it. The bubble tea smoothie itself is considerably more Americanized than others I've had... the mango flavor is super creamy, with almost an ice cream consistency. That may deter you, but I'll be honest: I found it really good. On to more Americanized Thai fare... the Pad Thai. It's a decent take on one of my favorite Thai dishes, with just enough peanut and plenty of egg. It's also a huge portion, and made for two meals and counting. Number three is at-the-ready in my fridge, should I decide to go the Bang-cago route for lunch today (again, this is American Thai fare, people). I'm a fan of the crab rangoon as well... they're daintier than most versions, but instill a huge dose of slightly smoky, sweet flavor. What's in them? Doesn't really matter when they're gone this quickly.

2011-04-21,4.0,"I'll be honest, I don't know jack about Thai food.  My extreme hatred of most things egg kept me from exploring Thai cuisine. It wasn't until a bizarre craving for glass noodles, did I think of ordering Thai sans egg or looking at the egg-free dishes. After scouting out my nearby options, I went with NitP.  I'm really glad I chose NitP for my first Thai experience; they have a nice website, which spells out the ingredients in the various dishes. Their website also allows you to order online and customize your order via a series of drop down options.  One Friday I ordered the NP Shrimp Pad Thai and an order of crab rangoon for delivery. I loved their crab rangoon, despite being on the small side. These gnocchi-sized rangoons were delicious and the sweet and sour sauce with red pepper flakes gave it a small kick that was very addictive. The pad thai was good, although I don't really have anything to compare it to. The noodles weren't what I was expecting and I sort of wished I had ordered the regular Pad That, not the NP version. Instead of a linguine thickness, they were more akin to vermicelli and stuck together terribly. For the most part, the portion was generous; the noodles, sprouts and other stuff were plentiful (enough for a second meal), but I found the shrimp to be lacking in quantity and taste.  On Sunday I was still craving Asian; truth be told, I was tempted most be the crab rangoon. This time I decided to pick up my order and check out the space. The restaurant is pretty casual, simple and most importantly BYOB. It wasn't open yet, but they also have a great patio space on the side of the building.  This time I went with the traditional pad thai (with rice noodles) and crab rangoon. Again, I received a heaping portion of food. I think I will stick to the traditional preparation, minus eggs of course, going forward because this was quite good and I didn't end up with a giant block of tangled noodles.  Service for pick up and delivery was friendly and prompt. Oddly, both times the website quoted me a higher amount than I actually paid. They were only slight differences and in my favor, so I'm not complaining. I love that they package items well, entrees come in plastic containers to avoid spills and facilitate reheating.  Is NitP authentic? Is it better or worse than other Thai options? I don't know and frankly I don't care; all I know is that I enjoyed it. Reasonable prices + tasty food + BYOB + great patio = a great neighborhood find TIP: They have some great weekday lunch specials.

I also like that when I order a spicy dish, they'll serve it just like how I like it.  I would recommend any of their noodle dishes. Not a huge fan of the Panang Curry here, even though it's a more popular Thai dish. It struck me as funny that they serve their curries over noodles. I'm used to it being served with rice, but I wouldn't mind giving their other curries a try.  It's pretty cheap here too! You can BYOB, and enjoy a nice meal for 2 for under $25. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.",0.9945,0.677,0.297,0.026,0.676111111111111
2010-08-15,2.0,"NITP gets a mediocre ""meh"" from me. I had high hopes for this noodle joint based on the reviews, but I can't say I was impressed.  A Friday dinner with friends began nicely around 7:30 with prompt service from our waiter. Starving, we ordered the thai rolls to start. Good minty flavor but on the dry side. I could have done without the faux crabmeat. Entrees consisting of steaming noodles piled 2 portions high also arrived promptly. Out of our three choices -- pad khee mao w/ chix, prik pao noodles w/ beef, and pad see ew  -- the beef dish was definitely the winner. Sadly the ""spicy"" dishes didn't have much kick until I pilled on the chirashi sauce. Also I found that my chicken dish was a bit overcooked with a slight burnt flavor.   Meanwhile the restaurant filled up and our waiter was no where to be found. A good 15 minutes after we finished eating we were finally able to flag someone down to get the check and order a green tea bubble tea to go. Again, another meh for dessert. Good green tea flavor, but beware, their version of bubble tea is more like a frozen milkshake (not the liquid tea and milk kind) with tasteless tapioca on the bottom.  All in all, not a bad meal for the price, but I'll explore other options in LP before running back.",0.9768,0.795,0.147,0.058,0.602088888888889

The Phuket noodles were okay, I've never had it before, never seeing it before on any thai menus. It was green and seemed pan fried and I got it with chicken....Uh, it was okay something I wouldn't order again. The noodles were a little dry, and the flavor was hard to identify but not something I'd like again. I was however, impressed with the Chicken Coconut Curry. The curry was a standout, delicious.

2009-12-03,1.0,"My boyfriend and I just finished our takeout from Noodles in the Pot, and I was compelled to create a Yelp account simply so I could post my comments about the food we just experienced. It should be noted that Noodles has incredibly fast service and a convenient internet ordering system--they were able to process our order 20 minutes before their closing time. They also gave us two spring rolls on the house. So I really don't relish spilling Haterade all over this restaurant, but the food that we got this evening really does deserve a one-star rating and you, dear Yelper, deserve to be saved from their awful soup.  My Pad Khee Mao was full of withered basil leaves that tasted past their prime. My boyfriend's fried tofu was rubbery. The only good thing about his Phuket Noodles was that it's kind of fun to say their name if you're fairly immature; once that's over, you're left with something that resembles and smells like stale ramen noodles. Last but not least, the Tom Yum soup should be entered in some sort of inedible foods competition. Its broth lacked the sourness and heat I expect in my Tom Yum--it had a bizarre and totally unappetizing sweetness to it--and the tofu's texture was gummy and tough. Worst of all was the unidentifiable, leafy herb that overpowered every spoonful with weedy flavor. Whatever this greenish-brown stuff was, it certainly wasn't fresh. Less than half a bowl of this soup left such a foul aftertaste that I gave up on it in favor of consuming a large piece of apple strudel and half a bottle of India Pale Ale in a vain attempt to erase the experience from my mouth. So to make a long story short, if you want a really quick meal that's loaded with flaccid, once-green vegetation, Noodles In The Pot is an excellent choice.",0.9534,0.825,0.114,0.06,0.4989183673469388

And of course, nothing is ever spicy enough.  They never, and I mean never, make their food nearly as hot as it should be. I always ask for it ""really hot, Thai hot, extra spicy"" and other obnoxious ways to get my point across, and I can never detect a bit of heat in any of their dishes.

When I crave Noodles in the Pot, I find myself thinking about the crab rangoon first. You typically get three pieces, all crispy and delicious with their sauce. The spicy chili noodle, which I usually get with tofu (because NITP has great tofu) is a blast of heat and rice noodle on a bed of lettuce.

The Pot Stickers themselves are nothing spectacular; however, the sesame sauce that comes with them is strangely addicting.  I'm tempted to just order the sauce, but dipping my fingers or a spoon is way less exotic.  Which is why we all eat Thai food, right? As for the Crazy Noodles and Pad Thai, both are excellent noodle dishes on par with some of the better Thai restaurants I've been to in both flavor and quantity.  All the ingredients are fresh, the chicken is really, really tender, and the noodles are cooked just right.  As I said before, they certainly live up to their name with these particular dishes. The real highlight for me has been their Tom Yum Soup.  The broth is a delicious coalescing of flavors--ranging from the spiciness of the chili to the sweetness and sour of the lemongrass/citrus leaves/lime juice, with undertones of oysters/fish.  Top it off with tomatoes, straw mushrooms, and tofu and you've got yourself one decent-sized bowl of awesome.",0.9878,0.81,0.163,0.026,0.5970899470899472

2007-08-25,3.0,this place was actually pretty good - as far as chicago thai standards. probably the best i've had so far. got the pad-se-eew (sp?) ordered in on a stormy night. had the pad thai also. i liked that the sauce wasn't overwhelming - that often times ruins the noodles for me. i will probably make this my order-in-thai place from now on.,0.8807,0.765,0.193,0.043,0.7375

Really inexpensive, but they still always have coupons in the bulk junk mailer packs (so don't immediately throw those away! you never know what you'll find...) 5. Avocado in the spring rolls! Yeahhh! 6. Same menu as Joy's on Broadway, so you can mix it up if you like a change of scenery :) My favorite main dishes are the Crazy Noodles and Chicken Coconut Curry.

2006-10-05,2.0,This is a pretty average Thai restaurant which is convenient and has a good patio for people watching but not much else.  Most of the food is bland and their Pad Thai tastes just a little off.  I've ate here multiple times with friends and it always underwhelms both in flavor and in heat (even when I've asked for food to be extra spicy)!  If you go I recommend something basic but hard to mess up --chicken fried rice.,0.784,0.806,0.137,0.057,0.45576923076923076

Once the pad thai was mixed it tasted normal. The chicken satay and peanut sauce were delish. My food order was $15- not bad!
