The venue also requires very little décor which helps with cost (but don't get me wrong it's still pricey). We had our ceremony on the south loggia, cocktail hour on the north loggia, and reception in the great hall and everything was perfect. We did have one small hiccup with our main contact leaving and not sending notice during the planning process, but Christine with Tigerlily (who we chose for our caterer) quickly jumped in and made us feel at ease. The food with Tigerlily was tasty and we got a ton of compliments from guests saying it was the best wedding food they've ever tasted!

Staff just walked about as if they were working in an empty restaurant rather than a busy and buzzing one. Finally, we were about to leave, but the manager Rene came over to our table, apologized and immediately remedied the situation. Everything went well from there. At some point there was no host at the front for outdoor seating. A long line was forming and Rene immediately attended to that too.

We decided to stop at Cafe Brauer June 10th after a long and hot walk around Lincoln Park, which we have done many many times every summer for several years. When we approached the outdoor dining area we see many tables open (aprox. 6-8 tables) - most with 3-4 chairs. The girl at the hostess stand took our name and stated that a for a party of 2 it would be a 45 minute wait. Hmm, ok. We were quite put off by this...why wouldn't they let us sit at one of the tables with 3 chairs? The restaurant did not look busy at all. We proceeded to take a stroll around the pond to kill some time and then waited by the ice cream shop for our phone to get the text notifying us a table would be ready. True to her word, the hostess contacts us exactly 45 minutes later that we can now be seated. Amazingly, ALL of the 6-8 tables that were open when we arrived were STILL open. But now we are allowed to be seated??  What a joke. This practice is a quick way to lose customers REAL fast. Once we are finally seated, our waitress seemed to keep forgetting us. My husband and I ordered a turkey sandwich to split and it took 45 minutes for our sandwich to come out. Again, restaurant is hardly busy. What does it take 45 minutes to slap 2 pieces of bread together and throw on some turkey? We observed several waiters standing around/ wandering aimlessly and our waitress was no where to be seen. I have no idea who is running this ship, but it has gone down hill since I was here last summer.

The price is actually good, but my sweet potato fries were flavorless and I switched to regular fries, but enjoyed my mac and eggplant entrée.  The kicker was my friend's burger.  She ordered a medium-rare burger and it came well-done. The waitress agreed it was over cooked, but later returned to say the chef refused to re-cook the burger. In all my dining experience in the US and abroad, when red meat is over cooked it is replaced, but not here. My friend who lives in LP and frequents this establishment for brunch was quite offended at the refusal given the big difference between medium-rare and well-done.  Instead of complaining, we paid and left and I do not have plans to visit again.

It ended up being smaller than the website gave off, but at Cafe Brauer they had local artists, a very small farmer's market that consisted of a few boxes of kale for sale, and a magnificent jazz trio. We had a drink and listened to the music and then ordered food.  They have a good selection of beers and I ordered the mushroom pizza. It was a little salty, but delicious. The fries were also amazing. They tasted more like baked fries than greasy and oily french fries. The weather wasn't terrific, it started raining in the middle of dinner.

There was never any question that this was where my wife and I would hold our reception. The rental on the venue is very reasonable for one of the premier locations in the city, but make sure you book your dates early--we were looking over a year ahead of time, and still ended up booking a Friday because all the Saturdays were taken. Carrie Woods, the manager, is incredibly helpful at guiding you through all the ins and outs of using the venue.  There is, unfortunately, a limited vendor list, but Carrie was happy to work with us on all of our needs and give us recommendations for our budget and plans. If you're considering Café Brauer, I can't recommend it more.  And if you want an idea of what a reception there can be like, just take a look at this, a timelapse we did of the day there: youtube.com/watch?v=Mc2I…",0.9374,0.853,0.102,0.045,0.7413558201058201

We had our ceremony inside the Great Hall, cocktails in the North Loggia, and then the reception the Great Hall again- although they have other configurations for ceremonies and receptions.

Very nice staff and patient around screeching children aka my grand-nieces. Inside location is best for these awkward moments so that those outside don't have to have their zen broken up. Of course we did take them out and walk them at the front of the building which was a perfect place for them to calm down. Food is fine to good. Location is wonderful. Location, Location, Location and Price I would not go here for the food, though it's fine. The location is hard to beat if all the weather and time of day come together (shade/no shade depending what you like). Stopped in for Sunday breakfast. Hubby's omelet was ""OK"" and the marble rye toast was toasted perfectly. The bread pudding rates a ""B-"" which is quite satisfying to fellow carbo-holics. My knock down from 4 stars is that the service was slow but very friendly and my Chilaquiles was less than satisfying but they did poach the eggs for me. They were prepared traditionally so they corn chips were softened but there was barely any cheese and no beans. Basically, a plate of chips with thin salsa splashed on it and two eggs on top. While I'm a bit of a wimp around spicy hot food, I'm not that bad. Hubby who is more aggressive with all sorts of spicy food tasted and agreed that it was a bit too spicy for breakfast especially with no beans and little cheese as counter points.  GO here! Have a good time. The food is reasonably priced. Don't be in a rush. Have a good weather day. We will try stopping by for dinner but I don't recall any salad on the menu.

You will be bound by a variety of rules and restrictions at this venue, because the building is old, but also because as an in-demand Lincoln Park venue they can be rigid and get away with it.  The alcohol here is outrageous, and you will end up paying much more than you would at other venues, or if you were able to provide your own alcohol.  We had to buy an entire extra case of champagne because they would not sell to us by the bottle for our toast.  The bathrooms here are indeed ancient and not handicapped-friendly at all.  They can be dressed up by your florist, but it's still like a restroom in a high school gym.  Brides be aware that you will not have a real space in which to wait, freshen up.  They allow you up into a balcony area, but you have to slump down in a chair to avoid being seen by guests entering on the main level.  There are few parking options, other than paying a ton for valet. Bottom line, if you have a big budget and value ambiance, this is a great space for ceremony, reception, and amazing photos.  But pay close attention to all the policies, and be very persistent in getting clarification if you plan to work with this venue.  It was beautiful, but given the costs I would not book this venue if I planned the wedding over again.",0.9749,0.883,0.077,0.04,0.4640162421557771

It does not interfere during conversations and it is nice when the conversation has died down. The drinks here are awesome. They can make margaritas, various flavored mojitos, vodka lemonades, and martinis. They are all tremendously good. YUM! So go enjoy a day at the zoo and follow it up with a visit to this Cafe.

So, there's my feedback.  Not for us!  Facilities were so not worth the price, despite the truly gorgeous main room.  Furthermore, if we're getting an attitude-y vibe form the coordinators when they're supposed to be selling us on the space, I'm afraid what would happen when a problem arises 8 months down the line.  We're going with The Ivy Room.",0.9547,0.783,0.141,0.076,0.5871256038647344

2011-09-25,3.0,"Cafe Brauer is stunning. If you have an event there, it will be beautiful and will have a magical air about. However, there's something major to keep in mind if you're planning to book an event there.  Make sure to review the liquor prices and packages, which are NOT detailed in the contract. This sounds like a no brainer, but we stupidly assumed the prices would be comparable to other high-end and pricey venues in the city, which we'd investigated -- think 5-star Michigan Avenue hotels, museums, and galleries -- only to find alcohol 20%-40% more expensive. Because Cafe Brauer charges per person, by the hour -- not by the drink -- this can result in thousands of dollars difference in what you're budgeting. They admit the prices are equivalent to restaurant prices b/c of the nonprofit status; it's how they make money. We discovered this after the contract was signed and felt that it should have been spelled out. We found out that they were indeed supposed to review pricing with us prior to signing the contact and that it was an oversight. After a discussion -- we were actually considering losing our deposit and going somewhere else -- we did get to adjust the bar package closer to our liking in terms of type of alcohol, as a concession. It wasn't perfect but it made us feel better so we could continue with wedding plans.  One other note: they have a comparably extensive list of approved vendors, but they are all in the upper price bracket, so just be prepared to work in that range. We were, so it was OK, but I can imagine it could be frustrating for some people. We loved having our wedding there but regretted the alcohol pricing situation.

2008-11-13,5.0,"I went to the most fantabulous wedding here a few weeks ago!  If you want to drop loads of money and spruce it up a bit with fancy table linens, beautiful flower arrangements, etc...go fer it!  But, It might not even be necessary.  The vaulted ceilings complete with ornate steel trusses and glass skylights were absolutely stunning.  The bride had about a million little glass votives hanging from the trusses and created such a magical environment! I did not notice anything bad about the acoustics, the smell, or the bathrooms, as mentioned in the other reviews.  Perhaps, they fixed em up since then.  My only complaint is with the upstairs corridors which look down into the main space...did those horny bastards really think no one would see them going at it up there?!  ewww!",0.5159,0.827,0.098,0.075,0.5449346405228759
2008-03-03,4.0,"So Cafe Brauer is in fact not a ""Cafe"" at all... what a misleading and uninspired title. I guess in the warm months they do have a patio cafeteria-style dining area where you can eat pond and park-side while you visit the Zoo, but with that aside, Cafe Brauer is for all intents and purposes an event and venue hall. And a lovely one at that!!  I attended an event there this past Friday evening and was astonished when I saw a gorgeous and ornate reception room and not a restaurant like I'd been expecting. The second floor is the event space and it was large and open with amazing woodwork, I was truly impressed... vaulted ceilings, wood domes, beautiful artisan handwork and 3 outdoor patios... in a word, it was gorgeous!!  I have to concur that the acoustics were terrible... anytime someone got on the mic is was completely unintelligible and the dj music sounded a bit echoey. I'm not sure what could remedy the problem aside from some carpeting, but I know that totally defeats the purpose of the rustic wood vibe. Either way, Cafe Brauer is really an impressive alternative setting to Chicago hotel ballrooms for weddings, parties, corporate events, etc.  Now only if we could do something about that name.... I think 'Lincoln Park Zoo Fabulous Event Spot' has a much nicer ring to it ; )",0.993,0.743,0.204,0.053,0.7030663780663781
2007-06-11,4.0,"Cafe Brauer is an event space located in Lincoln Park near the Zoo.  It is a very nice building and you can rent it out for weddings, parties and events.  I haven't been to an event here but I have checked it out when it was completely empty and I can see how it would be gorgeous once you get the tables and flowers etc inside.  It has very high ceilings and two outdoor spaces where you can have cocktails or just enjoy the views of the pond and the park.  The only problems I see with it are that the bathrooms are not the cleanest, and there is an odd smell to the place.  Not a bad smell but it smells very old- which it is so I really can't hold that against it.",-0.0498,0.813,0.093,0.094,0.5798787878787879
2006-06-09,5.0,"I went to Cafe Brauer last night for a company event.  Wow, what a gorgeous building!!  The reception space was very open with a huge skylight.  I could have spend hours just looking at the details in the brick and windows.  It does get a little loud, though, because it is a decent sized open space...but a quick step out onto the patio quiets things down and the views of the park are beautiful. This is a perfect location for a wedding reception or party.",0.9692,0.765,0.235,0.0,0.6747863247863248

2005-09-06,3.0,"With it's almost storybook-like location between the duck pond by the Children's Petting Zoo and the Lincoln Park Zoo, this cafe is a fine place to hang out and enjoy an ice cream cone or a hot dog, if you can eat such things. However, it rarely seems to be open.",0.6124,0.904,0.096,0.0,0.625

It's open in warm months to the public and serves dogs, pizza, snacks and even beer. Definetly a nice relaxing spot to enjoy the geese as they fly by and watch the paddleboats on the pond.",0.8779,0.821,0.179,0.0,0.5127976190476191
