2017-09-02,5.0,"I recently had a friend tell me Chicago Deep Dish isn't pizza, it's lasagna. My response? ""Dude, whatever you wanna call it, it's amazing."" He's wrong, of course, but he's from Salt Lake City, so what does he know? Reasons you go to Lou's: -Because you're a living, breathing human being who enjoys, at least periodically, incredible cuisine -To have fun and socialize at a place where there's enough time before your food comes out to connect and not be interrupted (put your phone away) -Because you've been betrayed by another, lesser pizza place -You want to try the best pizza in the city -You already know it's the best pizza in the city and are back for your 482nd time What you may not know about Lou's: -While they are known for their deep dish pies, they also have incredible thin crust...similar flavor in a smaller package -The best thing on the menu isn't the pizza (although it's my very favorite), it's the Malnati salad, but you must get it with the sweet vinaigrette (that's how it's supposed to come)...also, the regular salad will be just fine for 3-4 people, the family size is just massive, so unless you're a group of 5 or more, don't feel like you need that much I love this location because when there's a wait to be seated, they'll often put out some thin crust pizza for folks to munch on before they're seated. The staff is super attentive, and they have a few TVs so you don't miss whatever Chicago game's on. My most frequent pizza order is a large pepperoni and garlic. The sauce is sweet and garlicky already, but I'm a FIEND for garlic. The sausage patty is great if you like sausage on your pizza, but it's a lot to eat, so be prepared. I'll also get the spinach mix on a pie every once in a while to get my vegetables in :) If you do get a lot of veggies or spinach, I recommend getting it well-done, so the bottom doesn't get soggy. DON'T SKIP THE BUTTERCRUST!!! To be honest, order whatever...Lou's won't do you wrong.",0.9963,0.77,0.186,0.043,0.5597937150568729
2017-09-01,5.0,"I'm a huge fan of Lou's! You must try their cheese bread. After seeing several other tables order this appetizer, we knew we had to get one too. It's sooo good! We stopped by on a weekday during lunch and they offer amazing lunch specials. For ~$8.50/person, you get either a soup/salad and a personal pizza (cheese, sausage or pepperoni). It also includes a drink! We loved the salad because of their croutons. So good! What I love about their pizza is that the sides are slightly crunchy. I'm personally not a huge fan of dense deep-dish pizza so I loved Lou's since the crust wasn't too heavy. Between the sausage and pepperoni personal pizza options, we enjoyed the sausage pizza more.

We were only going to eat deep dish once, so we did a lot of research as to where to go, and we definitely chose wisely with Lou Malnati's.  There was a 45 minute wait, but they have you put in your pizza order early so it'll be close-to-ready by the time that you get seated. Instead of hanging around in the crowded foyer, we went across the street to the taco place and got some drinks (LM's will text you when the table is ready). We got the family house salad, which was a nice start the meal, and a ton of salad for the price. For pizza, we shared the vegetarian 'Lou' and we also got the 'Chicago Classic', deep-dish style, natch. Both were unbelievably cheesy, saucy, and packed with toppings. SO GOOD, SO FULL.

2017-07-20,3.0,"This was my first experience with Lou Malnati's and the food was overwhelmingly average. I ordered a personal-sized deep dish pizza with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, and garlic. I liked that they did not skimp on the cheddar cheese, or the garlic. The flavor of the pizza was delicious and I was starving at the time, so it hit the spot. Again, nothing overly special, but it was a pizza and it delivered what one would expect from that. The ""butter crust,"" one of their hallmarks, is what I was most looking forward to trying. While the flavor of the crust was pretty good, and it didn't fall apart in the face of the deep dish, it was nothing special (you should be noticing a theme by now). The crust was firm to the point of being tough, and I would have liked it to be a bit flakier and richer, as those are the qualities that come to mind when I think of a ""butter crust."" Again, it is a pizza, and it does the job. Nothing too polarizing here, I would probably get it again if I were really in the mood for some deep dish and didn't feel like going farther than down the street to get it.",0.9121,0.849,0.095,0.056,0.5587301587301587

2017-07-11,2.0,"I've been to other Lou Malnati's locations, and don't get me wrong-- Lou Malnati's deep dish is great. When I'm with a group, we always get the Lou and the Malnati classic, whose flavors complement each other perfectly. Delicious!  I felt the need to write this review because of an experience I had at this location when I came with a friend a few months ago. I got in a little earlier than her and asked if I could put my name down for a table. As there weren't too many people at the time (it was pretty early), the hostess told me we didn't need to put our names down, and that I could just be seated when my friend arrived. Unfortunately, people started to trickle in, and before I knew it, there was a bit of a wait. That was understandable-- I waited until my friend arrived, and we put our name down together. We also pre-ordered our pizza when we put our names down. We waited for about 30 minutes before we were seated-- again, totally understandable.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the last of our wait. After being seated, we sat at our small table in the corner for over an hour before we received our pizza. Maybe it was because we were sitting in the corner, but over the course of that hour, our waiter stopped by our table --maybe** once-- the entire time. We ordered 1 small pizza between the two of us because we weren't too hungry, and it took over an hour (combined with the 30 minutes in which we had pre-ordered our pizza?). I've never had to wait that long for deep dish.  The pizza tasted like every other Lou's location I've been to, but the service here was disappointing to say the least.

2017-07-08,2.0,"Ordered from this location today by mistake for the first time in 6 months (been using the North Center location during the past 6 months). The food was delivered, consistency was poor and the cheese was like chewing an old tire. Dough was very damp despite it being uncut, my guess is that it was undercooked. I ordered a small classic Lou and a small gluten free, both were edible but not up to the level of quality of neighbouring Lou's stores. Both the dough was soggy, cheese was rubbery (guessing either undercooked or oven wasn't warm enough)  Only thing good this time was the order arrived on time as promised and the delivery driver was a nice guy (their drivers are always polite and courteous). That said there is still a ton of room for improvement considering the amount of competition and the fact that other Lou's stores deliver to our building. I'll be going back to the north Center store as the quality is always on point.  Hopefully the managers take a look at what they are not doing compared to the other Lou Malnatis stores when it comes to food prep and cooking as they are missing something by a mile.

Back in the Second City and we Funksters are pizza jonesing bad.  Lou's at the corner of Wrightwood and Sheffield answered the call with the Malnati's Chicago Classic. The downside was the wait...1.5 hrs to prepare the thing and wait for a seat, but we knew that going in. So we hoofed around the DePaul campus just a couple blocks south, sat and watched the local hipsters a little, then got the electronic heads up that a table was ready and the deep dish not far off. These folks have service down pat. While stations are clearly identified, everyone pitches in. Efficient and simple.  None better in the pizza game. To our drink orders we added a Malnati Salad - Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits, gorgonzola cheese bits with a fantastic light house-made red wine vinaigrette and romano cheese. A Family serving for $13.55. The three of us managed to lick the bowl dry! Table manners be damned! Finally at exactly 1.5 hrs from the time we walked in the front door the medium Classic came steaming to the table - Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on the famous Buttercrust $18.75.  For the uninitiated, Buttercrust is a cross between a traditional pizza crust and a pot pie crust.  More pastry crust like, yet not flakey, but as it's name implies buttery smooth in taste.  We each had a slice... more like a slab really and all split a slab. And that left two slabs for breakfast in the AM. Would we return? In a Popa Chubby Nobody Loves me Like I Love Myself blues minute!

Their pizza was everything we hoped a Chicago deep dish pizza would be...and more! Their sauce is EXTREMELY fresh! You can just taste chunks of juicy tomatoes. Their buttery crust is so flavorful and perfectly crisp. Their sausages are no joke. They are more than generous with their toppings. I can't stand anchovy, but my husband LOVES it. I absolutely love seafood, so I gave their anchovy a try. I assumed it would be stinky and slimy like all the other anchovy pizzas I've tried. It was not. Their anchovy was so freshly prepared that it tasted much like crab meat! You could feel the anchovy melting in your mouth. It was superb. I did not expect that at all! Spinach is the way to go on their pizza. With the bold flavors of the sauce, the spinach really adds to it. Absolutely delicious. And speaking of delicious, their cookie a la mode and their tiramisu are divine! Pretty sure we got a taste of heaven. My gosh! It was very delicious and not over powering on the sweetness.

Rated it a 4 as I had to send the cutlery back twice before I received a clean set, which isn't too encouraging but I'm willing to chalk it up to an honest mistake given the quality of the pizza.",0.9663,0.789,0.169,0.042,0.48213888888888895

I ask again about my pizza .. same response ... another 5 minutes out comes my pizza... cold... I get home and open it up... no heart shape and if 15 pieces of sausage is double sausage that's pretty scary ... very poor meal ... very poor service ...

You can't compare apples and oranges.  I don't care if you're a ""New Yorker at heart""... do you like the pizza and service here or do you not??  So, this is my review of Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza.  NOT a comparison of Chicago Deep Dish to umm Maryland pizza?? Still confused by that reviewer.   We went on a Wednesday afternoon and got right in.  We ordered the trio of chips and dip to start because Lord knows a small Chicago deep dish for two isn't enough... we inhaled the pizza chips, topped with fresh tomatoes and cheese!! The three dips were spinach, roasted garlic and I think a garlicky hummus with peppers and jalapeños?  The roasted garlic dip is the bomb.  Definitely will try to duplicate that at home. We got the Lou's Classic and it comes topped with a continuous layer of Italian sausage.  Nothing to hate about that. There was a thick layer of cheese like you'd expect and a buttery crust.     All in all, excellent service and the food was good.   Now here's why I compare.  Personal preference goes to Giordanos.  I think because I tried it on family vacation, I'm a bit nostalgic and partial to it.  I also think Giordanos has more sauce, which I prefer and in my minimal experience, considering I've only been twice... there pizza comes out hotter and cheese meltier.  But I don't think you could go to wrong with either one.  Try them both and see which you like better.",0.9546,0.865,0.096,0.039,0.5735730319063653

The cooking staff here needs to head on over to the original location and investigate why their pizza is not as good. The sausage on the pizza, should not have been because it tasted substandard. The original location has excellent sausage. The sausage should taste as great as the one on Salerno's pizza to the south on Grand Avenue. There is not excuse for putting substandard sausage on pizza in Chicago. By the looks of the line here on a Saturday night you would think that the pizza is great.

Then almost exactly 30 minutes after ordering the pizza arrived and out waiter served us each a piece.  We had to eat it with a fork and knife but I must say it was very delicious and just one slice was enough to fill us both right up. The cheese to sauce ratio was exactly what I'd expect in a pizza.

2015-06-20,3.0,"Whenever I come to Chicago to visit my friend, we order pizza from Lou Malnati's. I gotta get that Chicago Style Deep Dish while I'm there. So we order the deep dish style, and a side of garlic bread to be delivered. When we called, they said it would be about 45 minutes to an hour. So we decided to go down to the corner CVS and get some pop to go with the pizza. It took about an hour exactly for the pizza to arrive and when it got to her place the box was so hot I could barely hold it! They literally must have JUST pulled it from the oven. So we go back upstairs to her place and open the box and the heat and steam from the pizza was as if we just opened the oven door, lol. So we let it sit for a minute and cool down a bit.  We ordered a deep dish, easy on the sauce, and pepperoni. It looked amazing when we opened the box. Of course you can't just eat that type of pizza with your hands like normal pizza (at least without looking like a neanderthal!) So we each took a piece and cut into it. I went to put it in my mouth and the pizza was still piping hot! So we must have let it sit a good 5-10 minutes before actually eating it. Guess that's a great sign it's fresh, eh?  The sauce and crust are very sweet. Not like your typical buttery, salty crust. It's very sweet, as if sugar is definitely an ingredient. The sauce appears homemade with chunks of tomato and other ingredients in it. The garlic bread, was the same bread/dough as the pizza and between the sweet flavor and the garlic, I wasn't really a fan. In fact, it was all kind of bland, to be honest.

2015-06-02,3.0,"I am not crazy about it. It was ok.  I ordered the classic ""buttercrust"" pizza with extra cheese and lean sausage because I was told by my server this is the classic, and most popular option. Popular means it must be good right? I mean, pizza as a whole is fairly popular and it's pretty darn good. Even bad pizza is still pretty good (I don't think I've met a pizza I've fully written off).   I admit I was hesitant about trying deep dish and adding a deep dish place to my itinerary. I am all about the crust. The crust makes or breaks a pizza. the major distinguishing point in a deep dish is how the crust is made (recipe) and how its formed, altering flavors, textures, etc. But I wanted to give deep dish the chance and researched the heck out deep dish. I automatically knocked off the really popular national chains like Uno's. I read the differences between places and knocked out places that do the two layer stuff. I love buttery rich crusts and Lou's gets pretty rave reviews, so I picked this location to pop my deep dish cherry.  I have to say, I did not like how crunchy and dry this crust was. I was imagining something more tender but still crisp like a detroit style pizza. Instead, it was like comparable to the crust of a quiche.   What really killed it for me was how bland the sauce was. I was looking forward to some intense tomato notes, bright, zingy, maybe a bit peppery, and mine just tasted like just canned tomatoes plopped on top. The cheese- eh, the sausage, bland. No little caramelized bits on the cheese with textural contrast, just molten mozz. I think it was part skim too because it wasn't as creamy as whole milk mozz.  I do prefer this over the abomination that is new york pizza (floppy, sloppy, bland crust and minimal cheese and sauce, kill it with fire!) but I'll rather be eating at Costco. Better yet, why is no one talking about Detroit Pizza? It seriously is my favorite pizza. Skip deep dish, skip new york, risk getting jumped to have pizza worth getting jumped for! PS: garden salad is pretty good to say the least! Love the dressing, I'd tell them to put it on the side though because mine was drowning in dressing that I accidentally flicked vinegar into my eye chowing down on a very wet salad!",0.9778,0.765,0.158,0.077,0.5831760848278706

2015-05-15,4.0,"Growing up I was surrounded by Lou Malnati's, yet Giordano's was my favorite for deep dish and thin crust (Chi-town's thin crust is vastly underrated). I still love my Gio's and have even transported some back to Austin, but I have to say in recent years it's Lou's that I crave more when I'm back in town. This location is just footsteps away from my old stomping grounds at DePaul and it's one of their best. You may notice a difference in consistency between locations. My dad and I came in for a pie and while they were busy inside, we got seated right away. Sometimes they'll have a thin crust pizza at the front desk that you can grab a square or triangle of while you wait for a seat. On my most recent visit this was not the case unfortunately. I went with the Goose Island Matilda which is a Belgian style pale ale. It was pretty good. We got an order of wings which were great. We did a mix of both the buffalo and honey bbq sauces. I prefer the buffalo, but felt like getting a variety. There is a good amount of meat on them which is always appreciated. We sat outside for our pizza. I could go into detail about it, but instead, I think the pictures speak for themselves. *Chicago Native Tip: Whatever you do, do not order the personal pizzas.

While we were waiting we grabbed a couple drinks next door..Since their bar obviously had no seats.  When the table was ready they actually called me when the table was ready and we ran over!   I really dont think i need to get into any details about the pizza because its a Chicago style deep dish..

I have always had the Lou Malnati salad, but thought I would try something new.

Now let's talk pizza.  This is one of my favorites in Chicago.  The large is enough for four people.  Each slice was made with love, and the butter crust remained crispy after being served and still after the meal was over.  A filling meal, made with just the right sweetness in the sauce.  I will be back!",0.9884,0.817,0.159,0.024,0.5159613375130616

Didn't feel too heavy and greasy as some fried foods can feel when fried wrong.  Finally... the pizza comes. Golden bubbly perfection. The butter crust is simply AMAZING. Sauce was nice and hearty with just the right amount of spices. The only complaint that I could possibly have about the pizza was that the cheese did not seem to have melted enough.

It takes approximately 30 to 45 mins for the pizza come out and you have an option of various sizes. The menu is deceiving because it says a large will feed 4 people, but there are 8 slices. In my party of 8, we ordered 2 pies and had a ton of leftovers. I would definitely recommend the Lou if you're a veggie lover because it's packed with spinach and tomatoes.

He ordered the Buffa-Lou (ha!) wings - 9 wings (equally distributed between drumettes and wingettes - LOVE!), with a sauce that makes your lips tingle, but with plenty of flavor to offset that heat.  Their ranch dressing was pretty damn decent too.  I tried the cheesy gorganzola they offer as well, but the ranch was the ticket. I ordered the three cheese bread - its a French baguette that's been sliced lengthwise, smothered in garlic butter and topped with melted, stringy, ooey, gooey Parmasean, Cheddar and Mozzarella and served with a full cup of their homemade marinara.  The thing was as long as my arm!  So. Good. (tip - if you like the ranch that comes with the wings, dip the cheese bread in it.  Heaven!)

I have to say I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza and I like my sauces under the cheese and without huge lumps of tomatoes (its a texture thing for me).  Unfortunately this is the way Lou does their deep dish.  However, the buttercrust - their signature - is PHENOMENAL.  My husband loves deep dish and said this was off the hook.   Because its deep dish, it takes 30 mins to cook.  That's just how it is.  Get an app and cool your jets b/c its totally worth waiting for.

2012-12-17,4.0,"Our last night in Chicago, my baby sister and I made it a point to fill our bellies with some authentic pizza. Wandering around Lincoln Park, I found Lou Malnati's thanks to my handy Yelp app. Though I was Google-mappin' it, I did get some friendly help from the counter guy of Wells Street Popcorn. We got in and were semi-surprised at how un-divey the pizza joint was. It was quite a nice and cozy setting to enjoy a pie, so once we got settled in, we decided to order a small Malnati Chicago Classic for the two of us. The wait was somewhat lengthy, but since we were chatting about our Windy City adventures, the time flew by quickly and before we knew it, a deep dish appeared before our very eyes. Our server kindly cut out a wedge for each of us and we dived in. Really good pizza! Okay, so I'm not the biggest pizza aficionado that ever walked the Earth, but I can appreciate a good one when my mouth meets one. The crust was buttery and crispy on the edges and soft in the inside. The sauce was really well-seasoned and the sausage was the proverbial cherry on top. We were extremely stuffed, even after walking over 20,000 steps that day (yes, we are pedometer girls), and walking to the CTA station was a big of a drag with such lethargy. We slept happily that night. Go and you too shall enjoy a wonderful slumber after your body processes the carbs and calories.",0.9915,0.792,0.179,0.029,0.527932098765432
2012-12-05,4.0,"Lou Malnati's.  If you say it fast enough it sounds like ""luminatis"", which is totally cultish after you've heard it long enough. EVERY single Chicago local tell me that Lou's is king when it comes to deep dish in Chicago, as if it is some conspiratorial cult, so I just had to try it out.  Our rookie mistake was picking this Lincoln Park location on a Saturday night! Even for a party of 2, the wait was long during dinner. Luckily the staff at Lou Malnati's is smart, and served a few thin crusts to keep the hungry mob at bay.  We ended up getting in just over an hour after our name went in. Usually I storm out if I have to wait 30 minutes, but with patience as a virtue, the pizza pie was totally worth it! Tip: If you foresee a long wait, order the pizza ~20 minutes ahead of time for it to be served right as you settle in. There is plenty of street parking and bars in the area, so don't wait inside like a sucker. Grab a pre-drink instead.  The Malnati salad was a great appetite starter, and enough to feed at least 4 adults. We went with the Malnati Chicago Classic with sausage and the buttercrust just blows you away. For those with an appetite, the 9"" is perfect for a party of 2. We could barely eat half!  What I loved about Luminatis (my new name for it) was that all the ingredients were fresh. Tomatoes were chunky and firm, cheese was chewy and the dough tasted like it just came off mom's hands.

2012-10-18,5.0,"Lou Malnati's IS Chicago style, deep dish, pan pizza. The classic. The bell-weather. The standard-bearer.  Dining-in gets you a fresher pie, so make the trip if you can. Gotta try the sausage (a unique, only-in-Chicago homage to meat that's basically a single, giant layer of sausage, spread over the entire surface of the pizza) and always ask for buttercrust.  The outside is golden & crunchy on the edges, the inside is moist and delicious because it sucks up all the great flavors of the rest of the pizza. The cheese is stretchy, rich and flavorful. And the sauce, with it's big chunks of tomato and perfect tanginess, is so aromatic and flavorful, you'll be craving it long after the pie is gone. Enjoy with some oregano, parmesan and red pepper and you'll be in heaven. Quintessential.  If you think you'll want dessert, order the deep dish chocolate chip cookie when you order your food. They cook it up in the oven and it takes a while. And if you love the taste of Chicago pan pizza, but want something a little less filling, Lou's thin crust is a nice alternative (pepperoni and green peppers make a great combo.) Take-out/delivery can sometimes get a little watery/runny, so order it uncut and ""well-done"" to evaporate some of the moisture (it won't be burnt). By the time it reaches your home, it'll be perfect. True story. As far as locations, all of them are good; the Wrightwood one is closest to my hood. The atmosphere is pretty basic, the pizza is the star. The one downtown near the Merchandise Mart (one Wells) is my favorite, for no rational reason, and they opened a new one in river north that's probably the space of them all. I've heard that the one in Lincolnwood might be their first location, and it's worth the trip if you're anywhere near there. A mecca for pan pizza lovers. EDITORIAL NOTE: if you're from New York or the East Coast, and you wanna whine/posture/mouth-off that NY pizza is better than Chicago Style, please shut your pie hole. Seriously. You really want  to make an argument that one style of pizza is better than another? That's like saying that Pele is better than Michael Jordan. You can't cross the streams like that. It's really bad to cross the streams.  The truth? ALL styles of pizza can be great. And all can suck. Depends on the place. Resist the temptation to compare across categories. It's what the pizza illiterate do. There may be a ""best NY slice"" (i love NY pizza, too) a ""best Chicago 'pan' pizza"" and a ""best Connecticut style"", but there is not and never will be a ""best overall pizza"" It's like comparing apples to iPhones; doesn't compute. Plus, we have such a rich pizza landscape in this town, you shouldn't even lump all ""Chicago-style"" pizza together. Ain't fair. Ain't right.  There are at least 3 different types of Chicago pizza, which should only be compared/judged within their own category. (Again, don't cross the streams.) - Deep dish ""pan"" pizza (Lou Malnati's, Pizano's, Uno's, Due's, etc.) - Deep dish ""stuffed"" pizza (Giordano's, Art of Pizza, Eduardo's, Chicago's Pizza, etc.) - Thin ""party-cut"" pizza (Aurelio's, Pat's, Vito & Nick's, etc.) You can also find square-cut slices (like from Pompei) which seem to be a Chicago-only tradition, but a category of one. Home Run Inn and Connie's are equally tough to categorize, in their own ways. Outliers. You can also find plenty of traditional neapolitan, brick-oven style pizza places around town (Frasca, Pizza D.O.C, etc.), Connecticut-style places (Piece, etc.) and a few decent NY-style places, too (Apart Pizza, 5 Burroughs, etc.) All I'm saying is, don't be a pizza hillbilly. ALL types of pizza can be transcendent and deliver you to a better place. You just gotta open your mind when you open your mouth. And when it comes to Chicago style, deep dish ""pan"" pizza, Lou Malnati's (and nephew Rudy Malnati's ""Pizano's"") take the cake.",0.9988,0.797,0.172,0.031,0.5270661157024794

You literally cannot go wrong with a Lou Malnati's pizza, deep dish or thin. My personal favorite is sausage, green pepper, onion, mushroom deep dish. Lou's has a delicious buttery crust, chunky tomato sauce, and thick layer of cheese that cannot be beat. To start, I really like their Malnati's salad, the vinaigrette is awesome.  For this specific location, I would suggest picking up during peak hours. The actual dining room doesn't have a ton of space and you could easily wait an hour for your table. If you choose to wait, definitely pre-order your pizza. This is extremely helpful when it comes to having your meal almost ready by the time your table is.

We arrived at 6:15pm on a Wednesday and it was still a 30-40 minute wait for a party of 2. Lou's is worth the wait though. There is actually a bar right around the corner (SE) that you can grab a drink at. We started with the Malnati salad. The mix of ingredients (olives, salami, gorganzola, etc.) makes for a perfect combination. They do a great job of pre-mixing the salad dressing as well so it's just the right amount. The tomatoes are super fresh and elevate the flavor profile of the dish.  Unless you haven't eaten for a week the medium size is perfectly sufficient. You would actually think it's a large when they bring it out. It will provide two people two big bowls of salad each. The pizza was obviously to die for. It takes about 30 minutes for them to cook it from the time you order. When we were waiting for our table they actually gave us the option to ""pre-order"" our pizza so it could be prepared faster. If you are super hungry or have children this may be a good option for you to consider. We chose the Malnati classic. The buttercrust, cheese, lean sausage and tomatoes are phenomenal together. The Malanati family hand selects the tomatoes and they get their cheese from a local dairy that has been supplying them for 40 years. Combine this with years and years of crust perfecting and you have the makings of a stellar pizza. The next time we visit we really want to try the 'Lou' which has spinach and mushrooms. Word to the wise, if you are ""creating"" your own pizza from scratch keep in mind that they charge you the full price for each topping even if you elect to only put it on half of the pizza. This wasn't an issue since we selected the classic but you can rack up costs quickly if you think your bill is 1/2 of what they will actually charge you.",0.9682,0.904,0.089,0.007,0.4515151515151515

2012-05-11,3.0,"Every now and again, I get a hankering for a real Chicago deep dish pizza. I hadn't been back to Chicago for 4 years, so I was already plotting out where I was going to get my pizza. I've been to Gino's and Giordano's (touristy, yes -- but delicious and satisfying)  My friend took me to Lou Malnati's. It definitely had a local vibe going on and didn't seem too touristy.  The inside made me think I had been transported 20-30 years in time and into someone's living room. There were couches, a TV, and wooden tables scattered around. It was a little odd, but I wasn't there for the ambiance. I decided to get a salad to start - something healthy to balance out the heavy pizza I was about to consume. I settled on the Chicken Club Salad. If you're looking for a healthy salad, stay away from this. It tasted fine, but they were heavy handed with the dressing (which was pretty rich). The salad had romaine lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella and cheddar cheese, bacon, and tortilla chips. The small was enough to feed 3 people. It was not really the ""light and refreshing"" salad I was looking for. I'd suggest getting the dressing on the side and asking for less cheese if you're looking for something relatively healthy. We got the ""Malnati Chicago Classic"". The 9"" Small was definitely enough for 2 people. This has sausage, extra cheese, tomato sauce and the famous Buttercrust.  Maybe I should've gone with the spinach one, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the pizza. It was really heavy (I knew this coming in - it is deep dish pizza after all, not a Lean Cuisine), and there was excessive amounts of cheese that was salty. The crust was extra buttery but seemed unnecessary since I like my crust a little more dough-like and not butter pie-like.  It was decent, but not the best I'd ever had.

The crumbled Volpi salami was a little too hard and crunchy for my taste, but the mushrooms and tomatos were very fresh and the dressing was flavorful, but not overpowering. I would recommend the salad, but if you have sensitive teeth, skip the salami.  We ordered the pepperoni deep dish pizza and added mushrooms and sliced tomatos. I loved the sauce and thought the extra tomatos were a welcome and flavorful addition, but my mom wished she woudn't have ordered them since the sauce was pretty chunky already. Again, the mushrooms were great, but it could have used more pepperoni as it was hard to find any on many slices.

We got some chicken wings which was good but it wasn't even spicy when I even asked our waitress to burn my mouth. The pie arrive and we just all dig in and it was DELICIOUS. The topping were ok but the crust of it was sooooo frankly. I try everyone pie expect for the veggie one but I like deep dish alot more then thin crust.

I'm from Cincinnati, and our pizza...is...eh. We really should stick to putting thin chili on top of spaghetti. Therefore, words cannot explain my excitement over trying a legitmate deep-dish Chicago style pizza. My family arrived there shortly after they opened, and it was already packed. That's always a good sign. I can't say I'm a big fan of the seating area; there's a big screen TV and couch in the middle to make it feel more homey, but instead all the tables are crouched and I felt like I was sharing more with my neighbors than they needed to know.  We ordered a bruschetta first, and it was so-so, typical tomatoes on bread. We just wanted our pizza, really, but we were so hungry we needed something to hold us over. When it finally came, OH BOY, pure excitement. This is what a pizza should look like. The oversauced, undercheesed, not-sure-if-it's-thin-or-thick stuff I get in my city couldn't hold a candle to this. It was beautiful. And the first bite...absolutely wonderful. There was plenty of cheese and a nice amount of sausage. I loved that it wasn't sauce heavy; I'm not a sauce person. My one complaint? I actually disliked the crust. I understand why people like it (other people at my table did), but it wasn't working for me. At least this pizza knew what it was though. So many times I've expierenced pizza that was a huge contrast between 2 different styles. This pizza was Chicago deep dish, and it knew it. I'm going back to Chicago in a few months, and I plan on trying more of the city's culinary delights, from the pizza to the hot dogs. For now, however, I have to sit at home eating chili spaghetti, sadly craving Mr. Lou Malanti's deep dish. :(",0.9847,0.803,0.143,0.054,0.5081349206349207

Weren't they on the Travel Channel or Food Network or something? I dunno, maybe it was Fieri ranting about the whole layer of  MEATY sausage on the pizza that intrigued me and made me convince my friends to go. I mean come on, ""Malnati's"" just sounds awesome!  I think what I am most disappointed by about this place-this particular location-is the experience; specifically the ambiance. Granted! A restaurant should be judged on its food firstly, but this place is so spectacularly horrible that it must be discussed!  Malnati's dining room has the feel of a living room that was set up by someone with a lot of money, but really really cheap taste...in the early 90's. FOR EXAMPLE: big couches in front of a big screen TV, A LOT of maple wood treatments with white walls, wretched green, orange and black carpet, too many mirrors and wall to wall faded, cheaply framed Michael Jordan Sports Illustrated covers. Now that I think of it, this probably would have been my dream bedroom when I was 8 years old...in the early 90's. They also had early 90's soft ballads on the piped in music-seriously. I guess I'll give them points for continuity? Maybe in 10 more years this place will catch the retro cycle and be cool. But now, its more like they are painfully out of style.  We ordered beers just for the sake of boredom really. No draft, just a few high priced bottles with diner style glasses that were chilled (no need to chill glasses with good beer actually). OK I get it, this isn't a beer bar. Thanks for having Sam Adams and 312? We ordered an app, because, well, we didn't know any better I suppose. We got the stuffed spinach bread and after the first bite we were pleased. The third bite was terribly cold in the middle and seemed to fit perfectly on top of heavy, sad, vinyl table cloths. Thawed to order, yes! Also, the plates were plastic. Fucking plastic. Really?! A few looked like they came from Wal-Mart and a few looked like they had been yanked from a school lunch room. Ahhh early 90's memories...Thanks Malnati's!  Our sausage and pepperoni deep dish came out eventually and looked nice. That butter crust is pretty buttery and therefore tasty. But after one slice, the dryness and toughness of the crust sets in and it does not make it that enjoyable. The sausage was very nice, and yes Guy, there was tons of it. Nice reporting. The pepperoni was average. Overall, the pizza was hearty and just barely good enough to make the trip worth it...I think. But it does not hold a place in my heart! No sir. I've had better deep dish at Uno's and even in Branson, MO for Jordan's sake (granted the owner is from Chicago and used to work at Uno's)!  I got the feeling that the locals treat this place like we treat Branson, MO around here: you only go when your lame aunt and uncle or grandparents show up and demand you go. So there you go. I just made the tenuous comparison to Branson, look what you've made me do Malnalti's. Next time I'm making the 45 minute journey out to Burt's Place.",0.9966,0.766,0.168,0.066,0.49130376344086024

And I think that is the ultimate compliment I can pay. I had tried deep dish at Giordano's and was completely turned off to the idea of deep dish. It was just heavy, crackery and felt like a meat pie. I figured in order to give deep dish a fair shake I should try it again at a better place. I'm glad I did. I could discuss how awesome the Malnati Chicago Classic was, and how a few days later we stopped in at a different Lou Malnati's and ordered another one. But anyone that knows about Lou's knows the deal. And anyone who hasn't experienced deep dish, and has found their way to this review, has an pretty good idea. I can say that I officially now get the appeal of deep dish. From the butter crust, to the sausage disc, to the 15lbs of cheese, to the tangy, chunky tomato sauce. The total is far superior to the summation of its parts.  The only thing that still confuses me about Chicago and pizza is that there are so many places that also sell NY style thin crust pizza. Why?

My only other experience with Chicago deep dish has been Uno's, so that's my baseline.  The Malnati salad was great -- yay for bacon and great dressing -- and we ordered the Lou pizza.  It was a little runny on top, probably due to the tomatoes, but it was very good overall.  The crust was crisp and not soggy and sweaty, huge plus.  It was a bit over-cheesy, but for some reason didn't taste as greasy as some of the Uno's I've had in the past.  We each ate about two slices (more or less) and afterwards we all felt fat and comatose.  Not in a bad way, just in a ""oooohhh I shouldn't eat anything else all day"" kind of way. Service was alright.  The place was overly air-conditioned (brrr! bring a sweater) but I like the sports memorabilia (not sure about the roomwide homage to Michael Jordan) though it's a little weird to have a couch area (like in a family room) sitting in front of the TV.  I wonder if anyone actually sits there?",0.9501,0.839,0.129,0.033,0.5458523119392684

The menu also offers pasta, salads, sandwiches and other varieties of pizza but they're really known for their deep dish and that's what we chose along with a garlic bread appetizer.  Both individual pizza's arrived after about 15 minutes and I was shocked at how dang good they were.  The crust was a pie shell of perfectly cooked, light pizza dough that contained the high quality ingredients like a baby's bottom in diapers.  Balance and the terrific ingredients and masterful cooking made these both really fine dining and I'd go back in a heart beat.  Service was pleasant and professional, not much ambience, prices are amazingly reasonable, the restaurant is clean and cheerful.  The fact that we had to wait to be seated on a weekday afternoon after 1:00 PM tells me people really like this place and I'm so glad we went.

We got two buttercrust, deep dish pizzas, one with fresh tomatoes/mushrooms, the other with sausage/pepperoni. Both were absolutely amazing.   The next morning, there was a mad rush for the refrigerator to fight over the leftovers.  Observations: (1) Buttercrust is...exactly what it sounds like. AMAZING.  (2) The ingredients are very high quality. The sausage was incredible and the freshness of the tomatoes really popped.  (3) It's not greasy for deep dish pizza, which I love. Sometimes deep dish is just too oily for me. Delivery service gets 5 stars. It took less than 45 mins to get the pizza, and extra points for the sweetheart delivery guy.  He called when he got close to our place.

Lets just put it out there, I loved deep dish pizza. If given a choice, I would get deep dish over NY style pizza anytime (sorry NYC). However, my experience with deep dish has been limited to the national chain of UNO's. Lou Malnati's makes Uno's (the chain not the Chicago restaurant) look like an amateur in a pro boxing match. Not only is Malnati's a good pizza restaurant, based on their bruschetta (which I use to judge all Italian places), it's also a pretty decent Italian restaurant.  The pizza itself was pretty big. My mom and I managed to put away a 12"" medium sized pizza. For all those people who say 2 slices will fill you up for sure... well I;m sorry your wrong. My 5 foot tall mom could put away 2 slices easy (and that was after getting a big italian dip sandwich earlier) so if you can only put away 2 slices.... well you need to man up. We got the regular, which I think is sausage, peppers, onions and mushrooms. The ingredients were plentiful, like everyone says, because of the way they make the pizza, you get sausage in almost every bite. YUM   Anyway, for the price, I thought the pizza was pretty big. it was bought out to us as soon as it was out the oven, with the cheese still sizzling. In fact, I would have preferred them to keep it in for a bit longer cuz I thought the center was a bit soggy. But just a bit. We got the   Massive serving sizes, great pizza, good bruschetta (big portion too), good prices. And the best part for me? The crust. crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside with a great buttery flavor (I didn't even get the butter crust). It was like having a great breadstick built into your pizza. The bruschetta was huge and served fresh as evidenced by the crunchiness of the bread after we received it. Usually there are 6 slices of bruschetta for around 6 dollars, Lou Malnati's gives you 8 slices. WIN.The topping was chopped tomatoes with onions and a little bit of basil and Romano and Parmesan cheese. The tomatoes could have been more fresh, but they weren't overly soft. The dessert was a little bit disappointing. I got the individual sized ice cream pizza thing. the ice cream totally overwhelmed the pizza crust, and because the bowl is heated, that melted the ice cream as well. Sometimes, simpler is better.   Overall, a pretty good deal. We ended up paying around 20 dollars for app, pizza, and dessert. The pizza and appetizer were great, but they were let down by the dessert.

How thoughtful! And then she offered to bring us something to drink while we waited. Doubly thoughtful! The dining room has a certain charm to it, with Sports Illustrated covers pertaining to Michael Jordon framed and hung on the walls. I question some of the choices, because if you are idolizing Michael Jordon would you really want to hang up covers that trashed him? Regardless it made me chuckle.

2008-07-24,5.0,"This was a recently discovery and I am extremely disappointed at myself for not going there sooner. For meat lovers, nothing beats a Lou Malnati's deep dish pie.  I wouldn't call myself the pizza devotee, however I will make sure that I stop by Lou Malnati's every time I am in the Windy City, and do so for as long as I live.  Their sausage pie has more meat than any other pizza I've ever had, plenty of meat, but not overbearing.  I believe every bite should have an equal portion of dough, cheese, sauce, and meat.  The ratio shouldn't favorite one ingredient over another. Ingredients: Sauce: not your typical thick tomato sauce/paste spread on a piece of dough.  It's a lighter sauce, almost ""diced-tomatoes"", if you will.  If you're not big on the heavy dose of tomato sauce, this will do the trick. Oh and that crust, that buttery crust; crunchy outside, soft inside, is made to perfection. Cheese: I was told that all-natur'al Wisconsin Mozzarella is used in every pie.  Whatever that is.. I love it.  For that reason only, I wish California was next to Wisconsin. Paradise, right? Not done.  Save room for their Chocolate chip dough pie, filled with 4-5 scoops of vanilla ice cream, topped with whip cream and a cherry.  Chocolate chip dough baked into a pizza crust-like base.

If you've just arrived to this town and no one shoved a fat slice of deep dish pizza down your throat as you stepped off the plane, you've now been warned.

I usually opt for their exclusive sausage recipe (crumbled, no slab of sausage for me, thanks!) green pepper and onion.  Finished off with fresh cheese and their unique blend of crushed tomatoes that make up their version of a pizza sauce and you're pretty much set w a Chicago all time classic.

I do, however, enjoy their cookie pizza. It comes out baked fresh with ice cream and whipped cream on top. Yum. Save room for dessert.",0.8519,0.737,0.199,0.064,0.5114285714285713
