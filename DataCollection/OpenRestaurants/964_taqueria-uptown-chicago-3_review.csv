The crunchy item was probably the best tasting - I think it was a taco that was grilled or fried, not bad. The other tacos were so so, a little runny and pretty forgettable for the most part. The nachos had meat, cheese, pico de gallo (I think this was the substitute for the guac which they were out of), sour cream, and chips. The chips were on top of the toppings - which I did not realize at first and thought they had just given me chips. Kind of an unusual way of serving nachos but ah well.  If you're craving a Mexican diner experience El Norte across the street is slightly better.",0.9793,0.852,0.148,0.0,0.46208333333333335
2009-08-24,2.0,"I popped in longing for a burrito. You know those dreams you have when you're curled up on the bed eating an awesome burrito? Okay, maybe that's just me but, Mexican food makes my dreams come true. I ordered a chicken burrito for take-out and I get home and found myself disappointed. It was mainly just chicken and water/grease combo inside the burrito. They also make their beans with lard...but it didn't matter since I couldn't taste the beans anyway. I'm not a fan of meat heavy burritos so this disappointed me. Although, I have to say the lady who took my order was very sweet and nice.",0.8668,0.718,0.177,0.105,0.6856944444444443
2009-07-06,4.0,"Hmm. I'm kind of surprised by all of the really bad reviews of this place. I've only stopped in once, and ordered my food for take out, so perhaps I haven't had a chance to experience the poor service and disgusting food yet, but I really enjoyed this place!  Taqueria Uptown is not a fancy restaurant at all, but that's what I was expecting when I walked in.  The woman who took my order was helpful and the service was pretty quick.  I enjoyed browsing through the jukebox while waiting for my food and would have been tempted to play some songs if I was eating in.  When I got home and unwrapped my steak tacos, I was very satisfied.  I thought they were great, especially for the price!  I live very close, so I'm certain I'll be back often, and I hope that I continue to have success with the food and the restaurant.",0.9912,0.698,0.249,0.053,0.6715608465608466
2009-02-17,1.0,"Terrible food.  I went with my ex-boyfriend who has gotten a lot more health-conscious, but at the time he would eat pretty much ANYTHING.  We had just moved here from Texas, and he was craving Tex-Mex, so I caved and agreed to go with him.  This was way worse than anything he used to drag me to back home (which is saying quite a lot). I think I had an enchilada, or maybe a burrito, but I can't remeber for certain.  I do remember it being only lukewarm and kind of soggy though.  The beans couldn't possibly have been fresh, and the rice was pretty flavorless.  Even my ex didn't finish his food or want to take the leftovers home (a definite first).   To top it off, we were the only table in the entire restaurant, and our server completely disappeared while we were eating, so I couldn't even get a refill on my drink. It wasn't expensive, but whatever we ended up paying for it was still too much.",0.8092,0.81,0.115,0.075,0.6000283446712018

They still make their sopes and gorditas the same (after 15 years, they still taste the same!). Of course these are not like regular gorditas or sopes from Mexico, but the unfortunate (still tasty, but in a different way) Americanized version of gorditas. Come to this taqueria for a quick, cheap meal. Do not have high expectations for the service or ambiance. Be warned that they do NOT take credit cards!",-0.6897,0.86,0.035,0.105,0.4455811965811966

2008-09-14,4.0,"Taqueria Uptown is as the name states, a Mexican Taqueria located in Uptown.  This storefront restaurant features authentic home style mexican cuisine at great prices.  As I looked through the reviews I thought it would be good of me to warn that this is not Frontera Grill, or Adobo. This restaurant serves fresh good home cookin at a great price.  The atmosphere is like a very minimal diner, it features a juke box loaded with spanish language pop & tajano music, bar seating and a few tables.  I must say that despite the  decor, the restaurant is always quite well kept and clean by taqueria standards.   We usually order tacos to go, we can usually get about 5 tacos for less than $8. The chicken tacos are well seasoned with moist and tender meat. The veggie tacos feature fresh ingredients and are always a treat.   The red and green salsa are quite good and have a great ""spicy bite"" to them.  All meals are made to order and there is always a special of the day... usually listed in spanish. The waitress is friendly and the cook is always fast. The food is hot and fresh.   This is a cash only establishment so bring some dough.  Again, it's not like dining at the Ritz but it is good food at a great price.",0.9865,0.811,0.183,0.005,0.47087797619047617

I visited Taqueria Uptown for the first time yesterday afternoon.  I had seen the write-up for their tacos al pastor in Chicago magazine and wanted to give them a try, since they are so close.   Am I glad I did.  The Al Pastor was not over cooked.  Also, I love when you can substitute cilantro and onion for lettuce and tomato.  A splash of fresh lime juice, som salsa verde and you've got yourself a meal for under $4.00.  Yes the decor is lackluster and based on other reviews I didn't need to check out the bathroom.  But the homecooked food, warm chips, and fresh salsa made up for it.  The beans are very good here as well.  Didn't try the rice, going to have to go back.",0.9604,0.857,0.13,0.013,0.5534848484848486
