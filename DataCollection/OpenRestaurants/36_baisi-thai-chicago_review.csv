She came twice in 5 minutes to ask if we wanted to order, even if we were clearly still reading the menu. She then brought the appetizers and entrees all at once. While we were eating, she came at least 10 times to ask how we were, and then asked if we wanted to wrap our food while we were still eating. She also included the gratuity in the total, which I didn't appreciate. She didn't give me a copy of the receipt. Super bad service. The food was good though, and arrived quickly. We got thai soup, mongolian beef and basil beef.  Because of the poor service, I would only recommend it as carry out.",0.7526,0.787,0.123,0.089,0.5728205128205128

2017-08-19,1.0,"Everything about this place is horrible be it the service or the food or the owner himself. Owner is a cheap a** and a miser. Groupon buyers beware !!!!!!!!! When you go there with a groupon they charge you 18% gratuity automatically on your total food bill to cover the restaurant costs towards the groupon. The reason the owner gave me for this is "" the servers need to cover their parking costs as well as living costs with this gratuity."" It seems like the owner does not pay his server salary. Thats why they resort to such cheap gimmick. So basically your groupon value is nullified because of this. Also they add a seperate gratuity section to your final bill so if you are not aware you pay the tip twice. These guys are shameless and try to demean and insult you when you try to confront them over the 18% groupon gratuity. No where in the groupon it is written that you are required to pay 18% gratuity when you use it. When you try to use the groupon they disrespect and insult the customer as if the customer is begging for food and to dine in this shitty restaurant.

2017-08-06,5.0,"Baisi Thai is SUPER underrated. In addition to having a wide variety of Asian cuisines (Thai, Chinese, Japanese), it's situated on the sixth floor of the huge shopping center at 900 N Michigan. The views of the city are pretty righteous (my girlfriend and I could see Lake Michigan and parts of the skyline from our table). We came in with a $25 groupon voucher that only cost us $11. With the voucher, we ended up only having to pay $10 (including a 25% tip) for our meal of crab Rangoon, fried shrimp egg rolls, and a chicken teriyaki bento box (which came with miso soup, seaweed salad, vegetable tempura, and a small assortment of sushi rolls). The food was spectacular and filled us to the brim--we almost didn't finish it all. The bento boxes are excellent if you're looking for something to split between two people, though I would recommend getting an appetizer or two with it. Some reviews indicate poor service, but my experience with the staff was very pleasant. They were friendly and accommodating--multiple people stopped by to fill our waters and check on us.

The shrimp fried rice we had to send back. It was all one shade of brown and completely soaked in a brown salty sauce. It smelled and tasted awful, and I don't say that lightly because despite my aversion to dirty restaurants, I really like food and especially rice.  The other two dishes were okay and more resembled mall food court dishes than Michigan avenue dining. What put it over the top was how long we had to wait in various stages of service. The check actually took so long to arrive that it got there only one of us was still waiting at the table to pay it.

The pot stickers were ok. A few were barely warm and seemed cold in the center. A spicy tuna maki roll was decent. What I liked most was the shrimp cashew dish. Pineapple, carrot, in a well done broth with sticky rice.

I get it, you have bills to pay as well and I am all about that. But. Provide a service then, be knowledgeable about the menu and friendly.

My parents have been going to this restaurant for a couple of years now, and always raved about the food.  I was excited to finally be in Chicago and get to try it for myself!  My parents, boyfriend, and I went to the restaurant on a Friday for lunch.  The place is pretty large and not all that busy.  We quickly were approached as we entered; we asked if we could have a table by a window, which was accommodated. We were quickly given waters for the whole table and the waitress came out and greeted us and asked for a drink order. The restaurant has a great menu with many items that I was wanting to try.  What shocked me the most though were the prices--these are not prices that you would think you would find at a nice restaurant in downtown Chicago!  Most entrees were $9-12, which is awesome!  Between the four of us, we ordered three entrees to eat family style and one of us had the won ton soup. For the entrees we had: Chicken Pad Thai, Cashew chicken, and Thai pepper steak; the last two entrees both came with a large side of rice in a bowl.  All three entrees were delicious!!  I also felt that all were very large portion sizes.  The Thai pepper steak was probably my favorite; the steak was cooked perfectly and so tender.  The two chicken dishes were also delicious! Service was also great; our waitress didn't speak a lot of English as she did not fully understand our request for lemons with our water, but truly she was great about checking on us and making sure our drinks were filled.   Great place and I would highly recommend this to anyone in downtown Chicago!",0.9985,0.754,0.235,0.011,0.7114960317460317

My boyfriend and I sat in a great seat by a window (view of Mag Mile, Louis Vuitton, you get the gist). Good start. We weren't immediately ready to order, but ended up choosing the shrimp egg rolls, thai pepper steak, and was split between the pad lard nar and bami pad lard nar.

What do you want."" We were kind of taken back by the hostile tone she exhibited but brushed it off and began to order. We put in the egg rolls and the thai pepper steak, and asked her ""we're torn between the pad lard nar and bami pad lard nar...can you advise what the differences are?""

""Uh, yeah."" ...more awkward looks between me and my boyfriend. ""Okay, I guess I'll just do the pad lard nar."" ..then she just walked away. Well we got our food. The shrimp rolls were surprisingly good and the thai pepper steak was just OK. The pad lard nar though? Imagine that one relative you have, or that one friend's parent, who just can't cook to save their life, and you have to eat it or else you'd be rude? That's a mild version of how the pad lard nar was. So bland, I barely saw noodles, and just bad overall. Look at my other reviews and you'll see I never ever characterize food as just ""bad."" But really, oh my god. If the service wasn't bad enough, this certainly made me never wnat to go back. Anyhow, we were done with our meal, and looked around for about 5 minutes and still couldn't find a waitress, so we flag down the mean waitress (in case anyone's wondering, black glasses), and she waves her hand dismissively toward us (I'm talking, the manner you have when you flick someone off). jesus.

I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box ($19) and wasn't disappointed. It comes with a good portion of Chicken Teriyaki, white miso soup, rice, shrimp and vegetable tempura, California maki, and spicy tuna maki. For the price, it's a good amount of food that's pretty tasty. The chicken was well cooked and the sauce had good flavor. It was the star of the box, as it should be I think. The miso soup was okay, but it just tasted like salt for the most part. I ate it because it came with the box, but I wouldn't order it again on its own. The tempura was a little bland, but had nice color and crunch to it. Tempura is a surefire way to ensure that I eat my vegetables, that's for sure. The tempura shrimp were delicious, and I wish there had been more of them. The sushi was pretty good too, but again, nothing special. It has really cool decor. It looks like a pretty chic place. But when we went, it was kind of awkward and uncomfortable because we were one of two tables in the entire restaurant. So there was a lot of workers looking at us, making sure we were okay, and hovering. It also made the place really, really quiet. Next time, I'd be sure to go at dinner instead of lunch to see if the place livens up a bit. All in all, this is a good spot to come to if you're shopping around on Michigan Avenue.

Michigan"" shopping mall (where Bloomingdales is at).  The restaurant has a spectacular lakeshore view, but we didn't get to sit by the windows.   The Groupon deal allowed us to order $20 worth of food and beverages.  We ordered the Gang Kiew Wan Gai (spicy green spicy with chicken), Pad Thai with beef, and Thai-style spring rolls.  These three (3) items added up to be close to $25.   The spring rolls were decent.  However, for $3.95, two (2) pieces of spring rolls seemed to be slightly skimpy.   The spicy green dish also came with rice.  The spicy level was moderate and nothing screamed ""extraordinary.""  On the other hand, the Pad Thai entree was salty.  I felt like I needed a large cup of iced coffee to offset the amount of sodium intake from this dish alone.   Many patrons were here for the lunch buffet deal, which was excluded from the Groupon deal.  By the way, be sure to take a look at your bill when using the Groupon: a 18% gratuity was automatically added to our post-Groupon cost!  It didn't really turn me off, but it was indeed a tricky move, just FYI.   I was just so glad I cleared this Groupon off my queue.  Baisi Thai was really a forgettable one...",0.9709,0.872,0.103,0.026,0.5329365079365079

Servings are smaller than other thai places. Service was very slow. By the time we got to dessert, we asked how much the bill was because we had to get a minimum of $30.00. The server told us we needed to order one more dish because we weren't at our minimum, so we added the pad see ew. After we ordered the pad see we she said we still were not at our minimum of $40 and pressured us into ordering more. WE then explained to her twice the minimum is $30 and she finally dropped it. When we received the check, our bill was higher than we expected because the server added 18% gratuity to the bill. I asked her why she did that and she said that it was policy to add in gratuity if you use that coupon and that the coupon stated such. I've used hundred of these coupons and I know for a fact that it never explicitly states gratuity will be included in the final bill if you use the coupon. We disputed the bill with her and rudely said she would have the manager explain it to us. The manager didn't come over for 15 minutes.

In addition to that, she made a mistake on my friend's order and didn't even bother to tell her. It wasn't until 10 minutes after everyone else's food arrived that my friend flagged down our waitress to ask where her food was, only to be told that the kitchen ""put in the wrong order"" aka ""our waitress messed up"". We would not have minded, but she didn't even apologize or anything. Then to boot, and this is the real clincher, she dropped off a chicken satay appetizer that no one ordered without saying anything. We thought it was complimentary, so everyone but myself ate it. Even though I do not eat chicken and ate none of the appetizer, it somehow ended up on my bill. When I kindly requested it please be removed, the waitress exclaimed that it couldn't because we ate it, but had we left any little piece of chicken on the plate she could have returned it to the kitchen and taken it off of our bill. Makes sense--NOT! Anyway, me and my friend pressed for a manager, who just happened to have mysteriously stepped out at that point, and so after much insistence she got her supervisor. The supervisor said the same thing, but we weren't buying it. I said that's fine, I'll pay the measly $4 (I am a very justice-seeking person, hah) but that will come out of the waitress' tip, meaning that she would get none. The ""supervisor"" conferred with some other employees in the corner and then said that she would take off the appetizer as the waitress will pay for it out of her paycheck. I said okay even though that is a ridiculous policy as she was just trying to make us feel bad for their waitstaff. If you care that little about them and treat them like shit, their customers will too.  Long story aside, I know that I will certainly not be returning. I understand that they will still be a successful business operation without my patronage, but it is just a shame that they had to drive away a potential loyal customer. They are conveniently located to me and I have ordered takeout from them before as their food is very good. But, I am a stickler for customer service and I could not believe how they handled such a simple situation, causing us to make it into a much bigger deal than it needed to be. I have been plenty of places who have comped various portions of my meal due to a myriad of reasons (e.g. long waits, goofs, etc.) without my prompting, so when they could not handle a $4 mistake that the waitress made entirely on her own, I was beside myself.

2013-05-10,4.0,"I wouldn't have known about this place if it weren't for the yelpers on my friends list. Yeah, I actually read reviews of people on my ""friends"" list. Some are so helpful! I'm excited to find another acceptable asian option in the neighborhood and this one is even easier to get to from home. Fuck Panang Thai on Chicago and Clark. That place is garbage. But Baisi Thai can now be included in the mix with Silver Spoon and Big Bowl when I'm too lazy to trek up north for Ben's. Yeah, obviously we are really hurting for some decent asian food around here so I work with what I can. I love that it's in the more pleasant mall on Michigan ave. that nobody really goes to because more expensive retailers reside here. Easy access to J.Crew and Max Mara around the corner outside.. I like it. A Lot.   The owner of Baisi took my order and is so charming. Not all asians are charming cuz we're more known to be a bunch of bitches to strangers so I found this to be super pleasant. Prices are reasonable- about average, definitely a little cheaper than Big Bowl nearby which is nice. It's on the very top floor- I didn't even think of ever eating in this mall but now I know. I've had the pad see ewe with shrimp here and it is very good. They put a lot of vegetables in their rendition and I really enjoyed that as a pescatarian. There were chinese broccoli and regular broccoli in it among some other veggies. It was a pretty flavorful dish and I spotted some nice wok marks. Pile on some hot sauce and you're golden. I would absolutely order this again. I also had the pad lad nar and that was a gamble because most of it in this city is an atrocity. The one here is acceptable and the sauce was not gloppy!! Praise the Lord because I really hate gloppy sauces that are almost setting into gelatin. Barf. I had mine with no protein, only vegetables and it was filled with lots of vegetables. Not bad. I might get it again. Another big draw is that they have a lunch buffet 6 days a week! Shut the fuck up. GASP!! Buffet soulmate! You have to come back from Africa or wherever you are, soon so we can do this!!! Everybody is on a damn diet around here! I'm excited to try it.

2013-04-29,3.0,"Big, giant flags go up any time I see fortune cookies being handed out with the checks at a ""Thai"" restaurant. For the love of Pete, fortune cookies are for Chinese restaurants, people. The fortune inside even has Chinese vocabulary tips. And so it was at Baisi Thai. Not only do they give you fortune cookies after your meal, their ""thai"" buffet consists entirely of Chinese dishes. The entire staff was Chinese...except for the Mexicans. Even the Asian customers--and there were several--were Chinese. All of them. So, now I find myself writing a review of Chinese food served at a Thai restaurant. It's a terrible cross to bear, but I shall venture on: Today's buffet offerings--there are about 6 hot dishes and a cold fruit section--included twice-cooked pork (Chinese) and Kung Pao Chicken (also Chinese). The soups of the day were egg drop (Chinese. Again.) and miso (THAT'S Japanese, for cryin' out loud! Is there ANY Thai food in this place?). There was no steamed rice at the buffet, only fried rice. The twice-cooked pork was very sweet and managed to have an overwhelming pineapple flavor without managing to have a single piece of pineapple in the entire dish. Remarkable. I will say that the Kung Pao Chicken was delicious. Very spicy, with a rather light sauce in contrast to the thick and syrupy sauces that drown this dish in most places. In keeping with the weirdness of Baisi Thai, though, there was not a single peanut in the entire tray of Kung Pao Chicken. Not one. That's fine, I guess, but it's not Kung Pao Chicken. And finally, there was the Taste of Paradise noodles...or was it Taste of Happiness Noodles...no, uh...Stairway To Heaven Noodles? Hmm.  I forget. I just remember that the buffet sign said the dish was made with a 2,000 year old recipe. I believe that because my portion tasted like it may have been made in the original batch. Criminy. If you've ever yearned for something that tastes like noodles fried in yak liver and charcoal, this dish is a must have!",0.9855,0.834,0.12,0.046,0.5160374149659864
2013-04-24,3.0,"So I visited the Michigan Ave location, naturally, since I love the restaurant in Oak Brook. I have to say I was disappointed in several ways. 1) The dishes stayed on tables long after guests left. This made the dining room seem messy and it took away from the nice view of Michagan Ave. 2) Bathrooms need to be tended to as well  3) My usual dish (red curry with chicken) was considerably smaller and bit different 4) The soup (which seems easiest) we ordered as appetizer. came after our main dishes were served.  The restaurant does have a nice dining room and a view, but I don't think I would re-visit even if shopping on Michigan Ave. There are other Thai restaurants in the area that are less expensive, and have better quality food.

We had a birthday cake and asked the server to bring it out.  She put the cake in front of the wrong person. Did i mention she didn't bring enough plates? After 10 minutes the lights were turned off. I get it it's 10:30 you guys close at 10 but you had 4 other tables of people at the restaurant eating. We asked for a box to go for the cake the server brought us boxes as her personal purse hung on her shoulder. She did not ask if we needed anything else and left.  When I went to the front to speak with the manager. He asked if it was the chubby server. (I assume she received complaints before) I said yes and he proceeded to text her.

The view cannot be beat, especially when eating $8.00 thai food.

2012-07-12,4.0,"Could this be my new favorite (inexpensive) Thai place?!   I am all about trying new places, and Baisi was my friend's suggested for a quick lunch with good friends.  To be honest, I was a little apprehensive when I read the reviews on Yelp.  Lesson here:  don't judge a book by it's cover.   For a restaurant in this location I was expecting it to be much more pricey, but was surprised to see the average appetizer is $5-$6 and most of the entrees are under $10.  I know what you're thinking:  with prices THAT low, the portions must be tiny.  Right?  Right??!!?!!  WRONG.  I will go out on a limb and say my orange chicken entree was the absolute largest amount of food I have ever received at any Asian restaurant.  Size matters (no matter what anyone says), but the quality is just as important.  Baisi did not disappoint.  The chunks of white meat chicken were large, tender and not overly breaded or deep-fried.  The orange sauce was so good I could have drank an entire bottle, then showered in it, and then eaten it off of myself.  And let others lick it off me.  I was having a fat kid moment and it looked like I had barely eaten anything by the time I got my to-go box.  I had two full meals worth of leftovers the next day.  And it was just as good heated up.  Insane.  My co-workers were jealous, especially because I didn't share. And the restaurant itself?  This place has it going ON.  A trendy interior with ample seating for any size party.  Spacious, so you can actually dine at a respectable distance away from the other tables.  Oh, and did I mention the 6th floor location with tall, bright windows and unobstructed views of parts of Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan?  A $30 lunch view for under $15?!  I'll take it! That's right.  $15 or less, tax and tip.  Ya know, unless you choose to booze during your lunch hour or load up on appetizers, you'll walk out with a barely bruised wallet.   One pain point?  Semi-slow service.  It was a literal hour from the time we were seated until the time we received our check, and for someone who works a bit off Michigan Ave., I definitely went over the typical hour lunch break.  Not that anyone was monitoring, though.  I just meant from an ethical perspective.  They do offer delivery, though, and you should take advantage of it, because even those who are chained to their desks need to get their mouths nomming on this delicious food. Overall, this place is a winner in my book, and I will do all I can to convert the masses into Baisi Believers.  Oooh I am so creative.  Can I trademark that phrase?!",0.9927,0.814,0.141,0.045,0.5491624317711274

I should have kept walking or hopped on the red line and headed south to somewhere with more selection! I was not that impressed with the menu--some of the Thai standards like rama noodles were missing, and it wasn't at all clear what was vegetarian and what was not. The waitress seemed confused about it as well. Although her service was very good, prompt, and efficient, I think the menu knowledge could be better. While I waited for my food, I went to the bathroom. Wow. (Not in a good way.) There are three stalls, and two were empty but locked. The third was open and its door had a broken lock, so I had to hold it shut. The toilet seat was loose and slid around, the lights were dim like in a parking garage from a horror film, and the toilet paper was really low. I didn't run out, but there didn't seem to be a backup roll, and there wasn't really enough left for the next person. My pad thai arrived, and it was basically the right kind of noodle but with the wrong sauce and a peanut garnish. It tasted like they stir-fried it in soy sauce and that was it. The carrots were not cooked all the way and seemed almost raw, but the noodles were slightly overcooked and a little mushy. This is also the first time I have seen zucchini in pad thai--I like zucchini, but I'd rather have had a sauce with flavor. This was pretty bland. The dessert selections are also missing some thai favorites, like mango and sticky rice. They pretty much just have ice cream. If coerced, I might come back again and try the sushi menu, because I saw some tasty-looking avocado rolls on their way to another table.

The food is okay, not bad or spectacular. The goal is to keep your expectations low. The view is spectacular from the window seats and the staff is friendly.

I have been going here regularly for quite a while -- at one point almost to the point where some of the servers knew us by face (as well as the owner). But on with the review.  The restaurant has been through quite a few make-overs over the years and the current rendition is nice. I also like to mention that ever since the indoor smoking ban went into effect, this place is SO much better now. Overall, if you're looking for a quick lunch - then the $9.95 buffet is your ticket. It comes with soup, but soda is extra (no cans of soda here -- real glasses!). The service was friendly, but again, it makes me wonder just how much English the servers understand (I always seem to get a lot of smiling and nodding...LOL). The buffet, however, doesn't seem to change very often. So in one case, as nice as the place is and the price is right, in some circumstances, this is a one-trick pony.  I'm not a big fan of Thai (spices give me issues), but I can always find something to eat here.

I was a little bit skeptical at first but in the end, this definitely turned into a 4 star place for me.  From the outside, and because of the small buffet setting, I thought it would be average if we were lucky.  The decor is kind of eh and the buffet is kind of small - we didn't try it so not sure how it actually is.  Plus, in a big office building/ mall, it was pretty empty so I was worried. That said, I didn't go the Thai route and neither did either of my dining companions.   I ordered the orange chicken and it was pretty darn good.  Lots of nice, citrusy sauce with, for me, the right amount of spice.  One of the folks I was with said it was too hot for her - on my personal scale, I'd put it at maybe a 3 out of 10, with one being most mild.  Not too bad.  My dining companions both had the Mongolian beef and they both enjoyed their food quite well. Service was pretty good.  We all stuck with water and our server was very quick to refill our glasses.  When it came time to get the check, it came and was brought back once the card was run very quickly.   It may not look like much but it's worth giving it a try.",0.9818,0.75,0.17,0.08,0.5619981325863678

I asked if they can make Yum Woon Sen with chicken dish for me (silver noodle salad with chicken, squid or shrimp, your choice). The gracious waitress told me she would ask, then they made that dish for me off the menu (+ 1 star). - Yum Woon Sen with chicken - nice & light, the portion is too generous. - Basil chicken - good dish with rice, but again the portion is big enough for 3 people. - Tom Yum soup with shrimp - was OK, a bit too sweet for me.

Some of the Chinese and Thai dishes are edible, but most are simply bulk. The waitstaff is friendly and accommodating, but they really don't have much to do since you're getting your own food.  Baisi Thai doesn't do anything wrong or insulting, hence it's not rated one-star. But there's really no culinary reason to go.",0.1097,0.795,0.097,0.108,0.5486029122392758
2008-12-27,4.0,I came here during the lunch buffet. Lots of choices.  The sushi goes fast so make sure you stock up on it when its available. Everything else had pretty good flavor.,0.8261,0.757,0.243,0.0,0.6977777777777778
2008-11-17,4.0,"I give Baisi Thai: a star for tasty food, a star for attentive service, a star for being very un-mall-like in a mall location, and a final star for not being mobbed by tourists despite being on Michigan Avenue. Why no final star?  I like Silver Spoon on Rush a tad better. Tip for a cold day: they serve tea in attractive ceramic tea cups that are perfect for cradling with both hands.",0.8689,0.806,0.164,0.03,0.8375
2008-10-23,3.0,"Went here for a friends b-day dinner last week. The location is great, although parking can be rough in the area if you do not plan on taking some sort of public transportation. I had no idea that this place even existed, as much as i go into this building for shopping... The layout was nice, great view, and very friendly staff....not to mention AFFORDABLE prices. I just knew that I would be digging deep into my pocketbook once I found out that the restaurant was at 900 N. Michigan. I had the red chicken curry, which was about $10, crab rangoon, $4 and a soda...dinner for me and my bf came to abt $30, including tip and liqour...can't beat that. Although I've had better red curry, it was not bad for the price.  I'll go back for sure.",0.9734,0.814,0.171,0.015,0.4555555555555556

2008-04-10,4.0,"Well - 3 1/2 stars Never order the spring rolls - such a strange combination of textures and flavors (like pepperoni but it had plum sauce and an unidentifiable brown mass)...just bad. But everything else was great. The Garlic Chicken was good, lots of it, but nothing extraordinary.  The chicken satay was perfect and slightly sweet with a side of my beloved cucumber salad. But the stand out was the Mongolian Beef - just wonderful.  It was enough for me to eat for lunch and dinner. I highly recommend it. For two appetizers and two entrees it came to $28.   We will go back, especially for there cheap lunch buffet (even cheaper if you print out a coupon on their website!) everyday but Sunday, but please, stay clear of the spring roll...uck",0.9885,0.71,0.251,0.039,0.6810526315789474
2007-12-25,1.0,"Well, if you want to go to the ""Ronald McDonald's"" of Thai Restaurants, then this is the place for you:   - Sub Standard Food   - Crappy Service   - Poorly Ran Thank God 900 North is adding additional restaurants, so if you get hungry you don't have to go to this place.  And another plus is the upcoming smoking law; not that I mind smokers, but you shouldn't walk into a cloud of smoke when you are going into a restaurant.  Well, if this is not enough to deter you from this restaurant, then you really must love the ""Ronald McDonald's"" of Thai restaurants.",0.8902,0.84,0.139,0.021,0.38
2007-06-28,4.0,"I am very enthusiastic when it comes to the Baisi Thai in Oakbrook Shopping Center, so I was relieved when my significant other and I had a wonderful valentine's day dinner here as a plan B.  We had been at the Hancock building observatory and then attempted to eat at the WAY overcrowded and overhyped Cheesecake Factory (four hour wait and no reservations: are you kidding me?!). Baisi Thai offers very tasty thai that is freshly prepared alongside with accomodating service.  Good trustworthy spot if you ask me.",0.9569,0.754,0.224,0.022,0.5277777777777778
2006-02-08,3.0,"Located in the 900 N Michigan shops, I enjoyed eating at this Thai restaurant.  I thought the service was a bit on the slow side but we didn't mind since we were taking a break from some hectic shopping.  The pad thai with chicken was great, and the spring rolls were decent.   The waitresses were very friendly and I did enjoy the meal, however there are much better Thai restaurants in the city to eat at.",0.9709,0.759,0.241,0.0,0.6395833333333333
2005-12-05,2.0,"Have eaten here on three occasions. First time was during dinner - decent food albeit small portions (their pad thai is not very authentic, none of the necessary condiments ie: sprouts, peanuts, etc). Second time we tried the lunch buffet which is $10.95 avail M - Sa.  On that occasion notable buffet items included three mushroom salad and spicy stir-fried shrimp.  Their buffet line is somewhat small compared to many local Chinese buffets, and when busy, they do a poor job of keeping the buffet stocked. On our third visit we came after  a medical conference on Sat to partake of the buffet lunch.  They seemed very busy, however that was not a proper excuse for the poor service we received.  Friends who ordered entrees had their food arrive extremely slowly.  Our beverages were not filled unless asked.  Nobody came to clear away buffet dishes which left an unsightly mass of used dishes in the middle of our table.  Finally, the waitress and other ""senior"" wait staff insisted that our check could not be split due to their ""computer being down,"" which was certainly bogus b/c they could issue our bill and ultimately were able to do it when we walked up to pay at the register.  Initially, the waitress had declined because it would be extra work for her she told us.  Having described the horrible service, the food itself was fairly good.  Dishes during this most recent visit included Teriyaki chicken, tempura vegetables, spicy tofu, panang catfish curry, chicken pad woon sen and various ""chinese"" style stir-fries.  Three salads were available.  Two types of maki: california roll & spicy ""something-or-other"" (tako I think).  On a final note, I did experience some gastrointestinal upset (to avoid being crude), directly after my meal (which I hoped to attribute to something I ate the night before), h/w this might have been the proverbial ""straw that broke the camel's back"" if they indeed gave me food poisoning.  Thai Classic may have to be the new Thai buffet of choice, h/w I've yet to visit P.S.
