2017-09-02,3.0,"Athena was my first Greek food experience. The food was really good and they had an impressive wine collection The service was decent our food arrived soon enough and the order was just as intended. The only advice I would give to patrons who are planning on visiting the restaurant is this - If possible, try to sit in the outdoor patio, it's much more quieter and looks great and has an artificial water-fall in the wall. We were seated in the main dining area which was unfortunate because there seemed to be lots of seats available outside, this part of the restaurant was kind of loud and there was a lot of foot traffic where we sat so it was not easy to make good conversation with my friend. Overall a decent experience, but could have been better.",0.879,0.873,0.102,0.025,0.6106060606060607

2017-07-11,1.0,"A terrible evening with TERRIBLE SERVICE  - and acute inattention to a single diner made the entire experience 100% disappointing.  The food was decent - not great as had been described to me and not the best Greek food I have ever had for sure. Service was soooo slow and just not on their game.  It took me 15 minutes after I was seated to get some attention and it went downhill from there.  The kitchen was SLOW and my stuffed chicken breast was overcooked.  It took another 20 minutes before I had to get up and get someone to find my waiter to get my check.  No offer of dessert, coffee  - just plain being ignored.  The check was wrong - they tried to charge me for a bottle of wine when I only had a glass.  I complained to two managers, they listened and made it seem like no big deal and they picked up the check ( and acted as though they were doing me a favor) which I didn't want them to do.  To many other great Greek places  in Chicago - bypass this one and keep moving!",-0.9805,0.805,0.024,0.171,0.5573743386243386

We asked the manager who seated us if we could sit outside since it was nice out and just have some drinks and he said sure. He gave us the best seat in the house. But this is the second time in a row I had the same server and he was rude. Wasn't impressed with the food last time so we only got drinks. Server seemed irritated and had an attitude with every interaction we had with him. He didn't bring us an ice bucket for our white wine and gave me a dirty glass with lipstick on it. We didn't complain because we wanted to leave asap and luckily I had another glass to pour my wine into but it was awful. I think the server was mad that we didn't spend a ton of money because he made a rude comment about the bottle of wine we chose. When the bill came, he gave us our bill as well as someone else's. Also  we thought the price of our bottle was wrong so instead of getting a menu he said we don't carry bottles that cheap ($2 difference no big deal but the principle). I asked to see the menu but he first ran my boyfriend's credit card and then came back with it. Instead of saying the price is actually correct he just pointed at it like we were stupid. We complained to a manger when the server glared at us as we were leaving and it really didn't do much good. He offered to buy us drinks next time. No thanks.

We picked the bar in which the gentleman there didn't seem friendly at all either. I just overall got a weird vibe that I was not wanted there or I was an inconvenience. From that we just decided to eat at the bar. A new women jumped in to assist us that gave out a lot better experience.  We started with Calamari, spanakopitakia and a salad. The Spanakopitakia was the only one of the first dishes that I really liked. For our main course we got the braised lamb which was recommended to me here. Great choice for that!

It's got arguably the best outdoor seating (indoor with amazing natural lighting too) out of any restaurant, giving you a great excuse to take someone out on a date here. As for the food, it was definitely good, but certainly not as great as its competitors nearby (I'm talking about you Greek Islands... yum!) But for an overall experience, you can't go wrong with this spot. The moment you walk in is when you are greeted with friendly service and a beautiful dining space. We started off with the grilled octopus and fish roe since we were craving seafood. The octopus was definitely the best part of the meal- smoky and tender, and sliced into bite-sized pieces. The roe is not as good as other spots in Greektown but they certainly provide a lot more than what I am used to! For our main course, we split a plate of greens and a few meat options including lamb. The different meat combos are worth it because you get to sample a lot of items without overly committing to just one. The dinner platter also comes with your choice of carbs which includes potatoes and rice. For me, it was all about the tender meat that was on our plate.

I don't like big formal restaurants in the first place, they're always overpriced, food is mediocre to bad, and their prices are waaaay to high. Today we just needed some food, my boyfriend suggested Athena.    When we arrived the restaurant was empty, a couple of dinners were sitting in the huge patio area. The interior looked very nice, seemed it has been  renovated recently.  We ordered Greek salad, meat mousaka, pastitsio, chicken vermicelli soup, egg lemon soup, gyros appetizer, and saganaki.    Saganaki came first with brendy and ""opa!"", was ok, soups were very good, warm and lemons fresh.    Gyros appetizer was mediocre at the best, meat tasted bland to me, tsatsiki sauce was too thick, lots of sliced onion and tomatoes. I have had gyros before, some joints have much better tasted gyros, wouldn't recommend this place for gyros.    The salad was very skimpy, I found 2 slices of tomatoes, 2 cucumber slices, 2  olives( really?!) , and a small piece of feta cheese on a top. The rest was lettuce and LOTS of dressing. The presentation was very bad, looked like the restaurant doesn't care how food looks.    The worst was our main course, it came looking identical, two big cubes of something covered in sauce and sprinkled with some cheese. The waiter wasn't sure which was mousaka or pastitsio, but pasta was sticking out from pastitsio, so the problem was solved.  From the first bite I knew it's not mousaka, I tested no eggplant, no potato, no bechamel sauce, beef was so under seasoned, tasted like rubbers. The whole thing was covered in salty red liquid, I can't call it sauce, because it's not. The taste of mousaka was so bland,  it seems like it was defrosted (some layers were colder then the others), what was supposed to be a bechamel sauce, was a disgusting layer of some paste like substance.  I had a couple bites and refused to eat it. The waiter was polite  and offered another meal but I was not sure if would try anything on their menu. My bf had Greek pasta bake with meat, he seemed liking it, I had a bite but didn't like it either.   It's not like I have never had a Greek food before, i had made mousaka myself before.  What I didn't see in Athena is authenticity of Greek food, if I am going to the restaurant I would like to taste food like it is , not like it was pre- made long ago, frozen, defrosted, and served.  I gave two stars for their service , soups , and interior.  Way too OVERPRICED for a bad food. Hope,  I won't get any food poisoning.",-0.9825,0.802,0.07,0.128,0.4959722222222222

A huge portion of fresh greek olives in oil, that were not too young and were very flavorful. Great way to start.  We also ordered Saganaki. I've ordered this quite often and their version was huge, soft and flavorful.  Usually it can be hard and taste old. Not here. A definite must try. I ordered the Mediterranean Sea Bass on special, whole fish, boned table side. It was cooked perfectly, very moist and sooooo flavorful. Usually the fish could be over cooked, or simply bland. Athena know's how to do their fish. My friend wanted the Gyro plate. He said it was really good and tasted so fresh.  Finish up with a couple of Greek deserts and coffee and it's a perfect evening.  Our server didn't rush us and made sure we had a great evening. I will definitely be back.",0.9951,0.735,0.259,0.006,0.4823536706349207

Months before we booked their private room for a pre-wedding ""rehearsal dinner,"" the manager told us - unequivocally - we would have the exclusive use of the room.  This arrangement was reconfirmed - with crystal clarity - when we returned to pick the menu and discussed where speakers would stand, etc.     Then, the night of the event, we were stunned and dismayed to arrive and see that they crowded three other small parties into the same room. We begged them to reconsider, or at least put up a partition to reduce the extreme noise, to no avail.  They knew that at that point there was absolutely nothing we could do, and they could care less about how that impacted our event. Throughout the night, the noise was so loud no one could hear any of the speeches - in fact, I couldn't even hear a conversation across the table.   When a family member tried to give a speech about the bride and groom, another group, by that time well into their drinks, started to loudly sing ""happy birthday"" in an effort to drown out the speech.  We also had prepared a small religious ceremony, which no one could hear or meaningfully feel part of.   The entire experience was just awful, and we can never recover the lost memories of speeches and conversation among our far-flung family and friends.  To make matters worse, the owner/manager couldn't have been more rude, dismissive or unhelpful. At one point he claimed we had a ""contract"" allowing additional parties in the room; the claim was completely false, and he has yet to produce a copy of a signed ""contract"" to that effect.  As noted above, he could care less.

I had been to Greek Islands, 9 Muses, and Spectrum a few times, so I wanted to try something different. I chose Athena because it seemed like they had a very nice patio space and its summer. I called a few days in advance and made a reservation for 11 people. I was told that outside seating cannot be guaranteed even with a reservation because it depends on how busy it is.They said they would write my preference down and try to accommodate me when I got there. I called a few times the day of and even offered to give them my card so they could charge me if I did not show up in order to reserve some patio tables but the guy said no. When I got there a good 10 mns in advance, the patio was not full. There were 5 4 people table all aligned next to each other that were empty so my group and I got excited. The guy who received us told us that they had reserved a table for us inside. We told him that we wanted to sit outside as we said on the phone. He said we had a table inside reserved already, he reminded us outside seating was not guaranteed. We pointed to all the empty tables outside next to each other and asked him if we could use those instead, but he would not have it. He kept telling us to just sit inside. He then ignored us and sat two people who were behind us on a table in the middle of the aligned tables we asked him for. We tried to complain to someone else but apparently he may be a manager or something so no one did anything. So we left and took our money to Greek Islands, where the food was delicious and the customer service was wonderful as usual. I intended to take my coworkers a few more time so I guess Greek Islands it will be! I am not sure what was going on with this place, maybe he had his regulars and was saving the seats for them, or maybe he did not like that some of us were minorities. One of my black friends had been there before and they didn't let her and her friend sit outside even after they asked. She thought it was because she didn't reserve in advance but that is obviously not why. I will never eat there, and recommend Greek Islands to everyone looking for amazing Greek food in Chicago and excellent customer service!

It wasn't too loud while we were there, just enjoyable with others having quiet/average dinners. Bathroom: It is nice and yet just a typical bathroom, nothing special but it is clean and well lit Staff: Our waiter was very nice, he even gave a great wine recommendation, and our food was prepared and delivered rather rapidly. Drinks/Food: We started out with beers and wine and moved to a couple hot apps. We had: Kalamari (very tasty with delicious sauce) and Saganaki (opa! So delicious!). For dinner we had: Mousakas (very good), Braised Lamb (tasty) and Gyros (of course... they were very good). Everything came to the table together and was nice and hot - like I've already said, we toughly enjoyed everything. Value: This is a nicer place but the prices are not out of the range you'd expect.

2015-10-13,3.0,"Not quite as godly as the name would have you believe. Being a fancier of Mediterranean cuisine, I hold all Greek restaurants to a high standard and find myself rarely disappointed.  Athena, sadly, was the exception to this rule. First off, this isn't your grand-daddy's Greek joint.  It's tailored to a much younger, hipper crowd and the decor reflects that.  The dining area is wide open and adorned with modern lighting fixtures, so it should come as no surprise that Athena is the new kid on the block.  Even the drinks on their cocktail list had cool names like 'Poseidon Punch', 'Zeus White Lightning', 'Hermes Highball', etc.  Fortunately the menu items are in the more traditional vein, like lamb kabobs, Grecian chicken, and stuffed grape leaves. The saganaki was made with kefalograviera cheese and was flambéed tableside, although the obligatory ""OPA!"" was considerably subdued.  Sad Eric.  What followed was a cup of avgolemono (egg-lemon) soup that passed muster, and an odd pairing of skordalia with beet salad.  The loukaniko (Greek pork sausage with lemon) was almost inedible: being extremely coarse-ground made for a lumpy, unpleasant time that doesn't bear repeating.  Had leftovers, didn't eat em.  The pastitsio (Greek lasagna) was the highlight of the meal, and it was agreed to be very good.  I didn't bother with dessert, although at this point their 3* fate was pretty much sealed regardless of a little baklava. Bread = 3 Circuses = 2.5 I found the service to be pretty lacking.  Our guy Stavros was curt and not the least bit engaging.  To make matters worse, my companion and I noticed that our plates (and drinks) were getting repeatedly slammed down on the table, to the point where she even commented on it.  When 75% of our meal came out at once, the servers played a hectic game of musical plates, which made me a teensy bit anxious to see my half-eaten soup make its way from directly in front of me to the other side of the table, with my companion's item now (incorrectly) placed under my nose. Also--and this is more of an afterthought--Athena does away with the traditional complimentary bread/olive oil/cheese and opts for the simple bread+butter.  So that's kind of a let down, to be honest. I MIGHT visit again during a summer day when the shutters are open, but I was far from wowed on this visit.  To reiterate, it wasn't an awful experience, but with an abundance of terrific Greek places to choose from--literally right next door--I can't see myself recommending Athena.",0.9746,0.869,0.101,0.03,0.5161040322361076

I will start with the pros, the place itself has an impressive layout, beautiful to be fair. The food was good but not good enough to justify the mediocre service.  I had the stuffed chicken breast and the prep time was fine, the chicken was juicy and tender, flavor was good. My girlfriend can't say the same for her Mousaka, though unless you like 'mush'. She only had one bite and left it all. Our server was not very courteous, welcoming, or friendly.  No follow up asking us how our food was or even attempted to make eye contact despite seeing that we were done eating and just waiting for 20+ minutes for him. It was not a full house and he clearly had plenty if time to ask his other tables around us how everything was and even take them all soda refills. So,  while I don't like to be unfair and judge a place based on ONE server, I decided to get up and ask for a manager which in turn was also a waste of time, not a single apology or even an attempt to fix the situation.  With that being said, I am extremely dissatisfied and will never return. What a waste of $38, I would have gotten better service at McDonalds.

After this kind of attitude no normal customer will sit in a restaurant so we asked for the check right after appetizers.   In all honesty the blame does not go much to our server, but rather the management itself.   The poor communication from the time we were seated and the time we even received service was the sole issue.  The manager should have taken a more of an initiative in the customer service we should have received once we addressed our concern to them.

After seeing the amazing looking outdoor patio when passing by on Halsted I wanted to give it a try. To be fair the patio is very impressive. Open air on a beautiful night with an ivy covered wall and views of the buildings in Greektown is definitely an experience. Unfortunately that's the highlight.

My party agreed we would have ordered at least another round of drinks if we had the opportunity. At least there were authentic Greek beers available. They tasted similar to polish and other European beers that many Chicagoans might be familiar with.  The food was standard Greek fare. Saganaki was a must, just a warning if you're eating outside it doesn't get flamed at your table to avoid embarrassing situations in which your hair might catch fire. The calamari was ok, here you get the large rings but no tentacles if that's your thing. My party agreed the best dish was the lamb loin chops that were on special. They gave three nice sized chops grilled well. Everything else seemed kind of blah. The combo plate was just stuffed with food. I don't think any of it was particularly great but it was a lot. My wife got the moussaka and it just seemed like there was a big tray of it in a warmer and a square just gets plopped onto the plate. The only thing I'd have to recommend is the saganaki. It was rich and lemony and amazing.  Athena was a bit of a let down for me. You get a great atmosphere but really average food.

2015-07-28,3.0,"One of the mega restaurants in Greek Town that handles tourists with huge portions, quick service and good (not great) food.  I went here with family because it was near their hotel.  I've had better Greek food in the city but still glad we tried this joint since it is pretty well known.  The outdoor patio area is amazing.  The Greek Combo was hit or miss but I did really like the dolmades.  If I come back I will order that.  The saganaki was the best part of the meal.  They don't bring pita bread unless you order an appetizer with it and what they brought was minimal and slightly burned on the bottom.  Their regular bread that they bring looks like some pepperidge farm bread - nothing special.  The Greek salad was good but unfortunately after two bites they brought the dinner.  Zero spacing with courses.  Felt like they want you out as quickly as possible to turn the table over.  Beer list was also lacking.  It had just one Greek beer on it and almost everything else were domestic macro brews like Miller Lite.  This is Chicago, there are ton of great local craft beers.  I understand importing Greek beer might be expensive but that was annoying.",0.9934,0.728,0.226,0.046,0.4505006105006105

2015-07-03,3.0,"Six of us made 7:30pm reservations for Friday night. We promptly arrived but only to wait 40 minutes for our table. The host was apologetic whenever I asked how much longer it would take. To my frustration, he could not give an exact answer. First, he said our table will be ready once it is cleaned. But when I asked a second time, he stated there were four tables ahead of us. I was not pleased. The point in making a reservation is to skip a long wait. If they cannot handle the capacity, they should regulate the number of reservations to accept.  We were eventually seated and we had no time to waste. For appetizers, we shared the saganaki and char-broiled octopus with lemon and olive oil. The octopus was light with a generous portion. Each piece was tender and succulent. The saganaki is the flaming cheese so do expect it to be a bit oily. It goes well with the complimentary bread or by itself. For us, one order was enough to go around. I think our waiter should have given us a heads up when it was brought out. Nobody in their right mind would want a flaming surprise within a few feet of their head full of hair.  For entrees, we ordered six entrees: dolmades, mousakas, loukaniko, paidakia, vegetarian mousaka, and veggie kabob. The paidakia was the highlight of the meal. A plate came with five thin slabs of butterfly lamb chops. It was perfectly grilled with a heavy usage of Rosemary but it did not overpower the lamb's natural flavors. The meat was particularly tender and juicy. Along with the lamb chops were a side of rice and potatoes.  The rest of the meal was average. The dolmades are rice and ground beef wrapped in grape vine leaves and drenched in an egg-lemon sauce. It comes with a side of green peas. If you are unfamiliar with the cuisine, the grape vine leaves are edible. We had the mousakas in two versions and their appearance is similar to lasagna. The ground beef mousaka came with eggplant, zucchini, potato, cheese, and bechamel sauce. The vegetarian version is the same but without the ground beef. Both came with a side of rice. The loukaniko is homemade Greek sausage served with a rice and potatoes. It has a slice spice and is great for sharing. The veggie kabob can be skipped. One plate came with two skewers of tomato, onion, eggplant, green pepper, and zucchini. The items were drenched in olive oil and flavors were extremely light.  To end the meal, we shared three desserts. The baklava and galaktobouriko were delightful. The latter is a light vanilla flavored custard in honey dipped filo dough. Both were served in square pieces so it was rather easy to cut and divide among ourselves. The Greek yogurt was served with dried fruits and honey. It was highly recommended by our waiter but it fell short of our liking. The yogurt was very creamy and the fruits were exceptionally sour.  For approximately $30 per person, we had more than enough food and we brought four boxes of leftovers home. It is a good deal for that price and the grilled lamb chops deserve a return. But I do not see us returning in the near future. We would not mind taking our exploratory cravings elsewhere with better management.",0.9956,0.851,0.122,0.027,0.44946031746031756
2015-07-03,2.0,"We went here because we liked the look of the atrium.  It's nice sitting in the atrium since then you get to enjoy the daylight, but they need curtains or rugs or something to dampen the noise--it sounds like a cafeteria.  We've been there twice now and don't plan to go back.  The first time the food was fine but nothing special (although I really do like the meatless dolmades).  Yesterday when we went the food just wasn't all that good.  I got the Shrimp Athena which says its shrimp and vegetables cooked with vegetables and tomato sauce over rice.  There aren't any vegetables, though, just Ragu type sauce, 5 shrimp, and white rice.  It tasted OK but wasn't worth $19.  My husband got a burger which was supposed to be medium but there wasn't a twinge of pink anywhere in it.  The fries were mushy.  He thought about sending it back, but it took well over 30 minutes to get our food when it wasn't busy in the first place and the volume of the restaurant was getting to be too much for me to bear, so we just ate and got out.  Both times the servers have rotated in and out constantly; you never know who your server is and there's always a million different waiters and busboys stopping by your table.

There were three other parties seated at the time, lots of open tables, and enough waiters to fill a football team. We were brought bread and water shortly after being seated. No words, no eye contact, and no one ever came back. We stacked our menus and started looking around. No one took our drink order, no one looked at us.  After 15 minutes we got up and approached a group of three waiters standing around. We asked them if someone could come by and take our order.

Ordered Greek salad. Bit disappointed as I ordered no dressing and olives. Came with both but the sever quickly changed it. Tasted plain can't say it's my favorite Greek salad because that's at Cheesecake Factory. Ordered rose wine. Bit bitter would only recommend it with snacks and not main course. I also ordered a Hillas beer. Quite refreshing with nice malts and hops comparable to blue moon meets a coors light.For dinner I ordered a gyros appetizer and my colleague what looked like a Greek version of lasagna.

I felt like everyone there wanted a quiet boring dinner. It's just not what I'm used to.  The food wasn't good enough to make up for it. The grilled octopus the waiter recommended was chewy. The saganaki was good (hard to mess that up).  My chicken kabob was overpriced and bland. It was a very tiny portion for the price. They didn't even put enough peppers and tomatoes on it!

2014-09-10,4.0,"I was looking for a place for lunch on a beautiful Sunday and this place caught my eye because of their amazing open patio complete with waterfalls and ocean blue umbrellas. I stepped into the restaurant feeling like I was on vacation in paradise. It was a perfect day and a perfect place to enjoy a nice sunny Sunday afternoon.  The complimentary bread with the sesame was tasty. I tried the fried calamari appetizer which had gigantic pieces of calamari rings. While the portion and size were generous, the batter didn't cling to the calamari well and I wish they were smaller so it could be bite size. I felt like it was too big of a mouthful eating one whole piece but cutting it up meant the outter batter fell apart :( The entrees are also gigantic portion. I tried the combo plate and the beef kebab. The combo plate was a nice way to try a lot of their classic greek dishes. My favorite was the mousakas (layers of eggplant, zucchini, potato, ground beef and cheese, topped with bechamel sauce). The pastistos (like mac'n'cheese with ground beef) was interesting but probably not something I would get again, haha. I haven't had a ton of Greek food so this was a good option for me. The beef kebab was like the godzilla of kebabs! I don't think I got through more than 1/4 of it before calling it a day but the meat was tender and the veggies grilled well. The beef didn't seem like it was marinated; it was a pretty basic salt and pepper preparation so I wasn't overly impressed. Our experience was ruined a bit by all the bees that came around our table towards the  end of our meal. Not sure why but it was enough to make me want to dine and dash despite loving the actual seating area.

The management needs to investigate the performance of this waiter (I noticed a complaint about an unfriendly water a couple days ago from a Laura B.; one could perhaps safely deduce it is the same person), and if they are truly favoring those who order cocktails, be warned that this policy could be viewed as a form of price gouging and also encourages unsafe behavior.",0.9493,0.821,0.122,0.057,0.43888888888888894

2014-07-07,2.0,"We went out to Athena yesterday night (Sunday). They were hosting a wedding on the lower part of their outdoor patio. That was fun to see. We met up with our uncle and aunt who live downtown and our cousins who were in town from New Jersey. They promptly had our table ready after checking in for our 530 reservation and they were able to get us a seat on the patio which was probably the highlight of my experience. It was beautiful. We ordered a round of drinks for the 12 of us and they were delivered in a reasonable time. The only problem is that was the only time our drinks were refiled within a reasonable time. My husband and I both had pepsi's and you bet we guzzled them down after the hour+ car ride on the way over. We waited 25 minutes for refills. NO JOKE. We timed it. In our 3.5 hours we spent at Athena my husband and I needed 4 refills after our initial drink. We waited about half hour between each one. There was water on the table, but I am paying for soda and I would like to drink that. I debated going to the bar to refill my own glass a few times but for the sake of our guests I did not want to complain or seem rude or ungrateful so I patiently waited. Our appetizers were actually phenomenal. We got the Gyros (Most refreshing tzatziki sauce I've ever had) the combo plate and extra hummus. The hummus was absolutely delicious. Dont be confused with it being anything more than hummus though; it was hummus well done but nothing more. Our meals took 30 minutes or so which was expected since someone at our table ordered the 25 minute Athena Chicken entree. Unfortunately neither my husband or myself enjoyed our meals. I know the rest of the table except one other enjoyed their meals so out of 12 guests only 9 were happy. I got their pasta dish with noodles, olive oil, garlic, cheese, artichoke hearts and carrots. Since I don't typically eat Greek food I stuck with this because I know I like all these items. I chose to add a chicken breast to my meal. I anticipated my chicken breast coming atop my pasta maybe cut into strips or maybe left whole so I could cut it up. It came chunky and tossed in my pasta. It was also skinless chicken that looked like it was boiled as a cooking method and it was dry, chewy, and I ended up picking it out. My artichokes came odd in the dish too. Maybe its my inexperience with Greek food however the artichokes tasted like they had been sitting in olive juice? I've had canned artichoke hearts before and fresh and Ive never eaten an artichoke that tasted this way. It was a huge turn off for me and I barely touched my food, though the sauce, noodles and broccoli that I didn't know was in the pasta was delicious. My husbands sword fish came out hard as a rock. We exchanged it for another Gyro.  Lets talk about our waiter. He was playful and entertained my Grandfather when he would ask questions (my grandpa is 75, can't hear anything, and we love him to bits!) so when people take the time to talk to my grandfather when we are out to eat it sure goes a long way. He remembered our whole table of 12's order without writing anything down and only one side dish came out wrong. Which is actually pretty impressive for anyone who's been in the industry. He also had our party, another party of 10 next to us, a couple of 4 tops, 6 tops, needless to say he was SUPER busy. Just wish it didn't take so long for our drinks to be replaced, but I understand he was busy.   I have always been a suburban girl. I love to visit the city and have fun then come home. I was truly disappointed this time, I expected more because you are in Chicago. I'd be willing to try this place again, but it would have to be under the same circumstances (someone else is hosting and chose the restaurant).

It was overcooked but was at least freshly fried. For dinner we ordered Combination Plate and Stuffed Chicken. When I got the Combo the pasta was cold on the inside, the meat had too much salt on the outside, the had to put some salt with a saltshaker, rice was just cooked rice with some sauce on top. Over all my combo plate was terrible and I asked the server to take it back. When i brought it to his attention, his response was - ""It must be your first time here"". I guess I should have been ready for the less than satisfactory food. My wife's stuffed chicken was better then mine but had some fat parts left on the chicken breast and we left 2/3 of that dish on the table. The worst part was the bad food but the servers and managers reactions were equally disappointing. I spoke to Jimmy (manager) and he told me that it must have been cheese on the meat not the salt and promised to personally take care of us when we come back. We are not going back and would not recommend to go back if you are looking for good food and good service.

My roommates, both non-fans of tzaziki thought it was delicious! The bread, though, the complimentary LOAVES of bread (two kinds) were, maybe, my favorite part. We even asked for a second basket. The freshest, best bread I've had all my (American) life and I'm German. That means a lot.  Did I mention the decor? GORGEOUS. Huge. Seating everywhere and impeccable.

The last time, on Easter Sunday, we were parked for free and seated outside immediately, followed right away by a polite busboy who handed us nice Greek bread and butter. The patio area is very pretty and romantic despite the otherwise congested neighborhood.  I requested olive oil for my bread and got it promptly.  Our waiter, Dionysius, was equally polite and solicitous, unlike some rude ones we'd gotten used to long ago at The Parthenon, nearby.  Many large, Greek families celebrating Easter at large tables were there, but we anticipated that and reserved for 6:00PM. I can't attempt to describe all the menu offerings as I've had many of them, here and elsewhere, but we skipped salad this time, split the fried calamari appetizer, wife (on Weight-Watchers) had a nice fish dish and I had the combination plate (incl. baked Easter lamb, of course) and everything, as usual, was great and served at the right time, consistency and temperature.  Given the bread, the wine and then the calamari, we had some remaining entrees to take home and freeze, but tourists can skip that for obvious reasons.

I love taramosalata, but this one wasn't as flavorful as I wanted. The tzatziki was good though, and everyone loved the tirokafteri. One weird thing: one of the veggies on the platter was a baby carrot that looked like it was dug out of the garbage. Like...really ugly. Truly the Clint Howard of baby carrots. Obviously, no one ate it, but why would you even put that on the plate? Blech. I ordered the combo plate, which came with moussaka, pastitsio, dolmades, and Greek potatoes. I liked the dolmades and the potatoes best, followed by the moussaka (which I liked even though it was different from the moussaka I'm used to), with the pastitsio coming in dead last (too much cinnamon for me). At $10.25, it wasn't a bad deal. Our server was friendly, although he did mess up a couple things: one coworker explicitly ordered saganaki and a side salad as her entree, and these were both brought out to her with our appetizer. (She was a good sport about it.) And he brought out the wrong meal for another one of my coworkers, but this mistake was quickly fixed. If it's a nice day and you're feeling like a pleasant al fresco experience, Athena isn't a bad bet. However, there's too many great restaurants in Greektown for this ever to be my first choice.",0.9942,0.719,0.207,0.075,0.6261904761904761

It was a nice evening so we sat out on the terrace/patio which was absolutely gorgeous.  We were greeted promptly and the staff was friendly.   I can honestly say that the food was wonderful.   The thing I appreciate most about Greek food is how they nail the seasonings.  The flavors are clean and uncomplicated, but every dish seems to have one dominant seasoning that just sings in a way that tells you this would be hard to duplicate without a lot of kitchen expertise.  We had a bit of confusion with one of our party members' food not being right, but it was taken care of promptly.    I had ordered the grilled pork chops, one of my friends ordered a combo plate and the other ordered a special lamb wrapped in filo dough.  We did a little trading back and forth and all the dishes were amazing, though the lamb wrapped in filo dough was probably the best.   The service was quite slow and as exhausted as we were I wish it'd have been a little bit quicker, but other than that, I think this is a solid choice.  Food was comparable to other favorites like the Pegasus though the prices were higher, but service could use a step up.",0.9942,0.75,0.222,0.028,0.5064373897707232

The braised lamb in tomato sauce was very tender and the sauce tasted like spaghettiO's sauce. If you're iffy about lamb this may be a good first lamb dish. The sauce is sweeter and less herby than braised lamb I have had elsewhere.  3 hours + $400 dollars later everyone was happily full.

2013-02-20,3.0,"I need to start off by saying that I am a great fan of Greek food -- street food, high end, Greek Church festival food, the whole ball of wax.  Although I have had good and bad Greek food, I really have never left a Greek restaurant hungry. My first trip to Athena was this week and I was with a group of friends that I really enjoy.  Over all our evening was great, and a considerable part of that was the location.  This restaurant is a step above the over-crowded elbow to elbow environment that can happen in the neighborhood, and their glass walled atrium/patio is a wonderful feature.  The server was efficient, if a little askance at some of my friends' questions, ie., Q: Do you have a cabernet?  A: You will like the Greek wine - it is just the same; Q: Are there any pasta side dishes? A: Everyone gets rice with a potato;  Q: Can I have the broiled lamb chops medium to rare? A:  They are better medium . . . you get the idea. The thing that surprised me about the food, though, was that the specials of the day were very tasty but most of the traditional Greek dishes (which we shared as appetizers) left a lot to be desired.  We had a selection of dips and spreads, and to my surprise the taramosalata, tzatziki. hummus and the skordalia all tasted very much the same!  The dolmades were hard and dry and vaguely sour tasting and the saganaki was hard and somehow dry -- how can flamed cheese not be at least a little soft? But the fried zucchini was outstanding, and the Kalamari was good.  The entrees really saved the day -- juicy broiled loin pork chops, baked fish, chicken riganati, kebobs -- every plate was empty.  And, as I said, overall a good time was had by all. Would I go there for traditional Greek comfort food . . . maybe not, but I think I will be drawn back to that beautiful patio in good weather.",0.9949,0.799,0.179,0.021,0.4171666666666667

The taste, the texture, the portions were amazing. All of our guests loved the food and were satisfied to the fullest. One of our guests did not like the amount of oil on her entree (we all thought was normal) so she sent it back. The server did not ask a single question, with a smile picked up her plate and took it away while offering other choices. I mean, how many restaurants do that? She was picky with her food which is her personal choice, but the fact that the server did not even make any face or ask any question or put up an argument was what really showed me the quality of this restaurant.

The reason I mention that is because they also have a patio behind this one that consists of lower quality tables and chairs. I had planned on eating elsewhere today but decided to go back here because of the pleasant experience I had the first time and plus I wanted a healthier option for lunch. When we arrived, we were led to the further back patio (the front one was not that packed mind you) where no one else was sitting, I was instantly put off.  But...I really wanted to wait it out and see what would happen.  More customers started arriving and they were all lead to the back patio.  I understand they get busy at lunch time and were just trying to even things out but it definitely felt like we were being banished to a deserted island!  It did make me feel better that they were seating people back there with us, though. Anyhoo, the food.  We started with the fried calamari which is fresh, delicious and plentiful!  Highly recommend if you dig calamari.  I also ordered the Chicken Village Salad.  It consisted of grilled chicken, green and red peppers, black olives, feta cheese and cucumbers.  It was fresh and came with a great Greek salad dressing.  The service was great but I really wish we would have been sat in the front area and not sent to the back.",0.9939,0.819,0.167,0.015,0.4158708708708708

I will say that this is A LOT of food.  You definitely get your money's worth as long as you take it home.  Our server told us that no diner has ever finished the family style meal, so make sure you're extra hungry or can eat leftovers if you plan on ordering this.  But honestly, none of the dishes really stood out to me except for the mousakas and dolmades.  While the saganaki, gyros, and lemon soup were okay, the same dishes at Parthenon (a rival restaurant at Greektown) are far superior. The leg of lamb was very dry and the salad was something out of a plastic bag from the grocery.  Luckily, they saved the best for last... dessert and coffee! For dessert, we all decided on the galaktobouriko, which is a light lemon flavored custard in honey dipped filo dough. That was probably one of the best I've tasted in Greek town, and I'd definitely order the dessert again!

2012-05-28,3.0,"As a Greek,  I have found the food in Greek Town ok nothing extraordinary. However I have actually  avoided it the past couple of years because of my discovery of Mythos Greek Taverna on the North Side (it is worth the drive out ).  So Sunday a few of us wanted to go eat Greek and of course our favorite was closed because of the holiday. So I recommended we go to Athenas since this was always my favorite restaurant in Greek Town.  We arrive with no reservations and were greeted immediately by the friendly host. We were seated in the recently renovated patio which has a retractable roof.  I must say this was a nice touch up they did. Although it was 97 degrees outside the patio had a nice breeze to it.  Our server did greet us and took our drink order and appetizer order. For Appetizers we ordered the Loukaniko very tasty, the Grilled Octopus also very tasty and the Saganaki (which I must say they do not flame outside any longer). So far so good! So our food comes out, this is where things turned bad. My friend ordered the Chicken Reganate, very dry not at all flavorful.  My other friend ordered the Stuffed Chicken with Spinach and cheese.  This was also a very bland dish which looked very dry.  I had the combination platter, the waiter was nice enough to substitute the mousaka with another slice of pastichio (Greek Lasagna). My dish was bad, the lamb was cold, the pastichio was dried out you could not even decipher if there was bechamel sauce on the top layer of the lasagna. My friend had the lamb with artichokes and cream sauce which turned out to be the only good dish of all. The portions have also gotten smaller than in the past.  So what they do is server the entrees on smaller dishes to make it look as if you are getting more (however being a past dinner here I can tell you, this is not so).  I think the most embarrassing part of the whole evening was at the end.  One of the servers from a nearby table took a plate off histable and placed it on the tray which was on a stand from another neighboring waiter.  So the other waiter not paying attention grabs the tray and the plate fell and broke right in front of our table. So no big deal right? Wrong the other servers came by and looked at us if we threw it and asked us what happened?  You tell me what happened. Of course the owner or manager came by making a comment as if we were having too much fun eluding as if we broke it.  No one ever apologized and still were thinking we threw it.  Athenas you used to be my favorite, however whenever I have a taste for Greek Food, I do not think I will be coming back to you or Greek Town Mythos Greek Taverna it will be (and the sad thing is you are 5 minutes from my house) .",0.9798,0.836,0.108,0.056,0.47482936507936496

Lamb with artichoke hearts in egg-lemon sauce is a special which seems to turn up most days.  It is great and they are really generous with the artichoke hearts.  If you like okra, the side dish of okra in tomato sauce is good too.   I have to admit that the wait staff can be a little eccentric (as in trying to persuade us to remain seated outside as it started to pour with rain) and some verge on rudeness but weighing this against the chicken or lamb, I can put up with that.",0.9273,0.868,0.114,0.018,0.5060714285714286

First, they brought us bread to the table, but no olive oil.  What greek restaurant has no olive oil at the table!? That being said, when I asked for some oil, they did bring out a bottle and it was good oil...but probably the only good thing I ate that night. So I ordered olives, hummus & dolmades.  Very simple, very basic.  The hummus comes and although it wasn't horrible, it was definitely not good.  Tasted like the kind of hummus you'd get from a health food store deli (kinda like some white hippy mom made it for the first time)....too thick & pasty (lack of olive oil)....it came in scoops probably dug out of some large pre-made bucket made who-knows-when, and once again, without any olive oil.  It wasn't the worst I've had...I even ate half of it, but not GOOD restaurant quality hummus be any measure.  Are these people even Greek? Next comes the stuffed grape leaves.... I bit into one and immediately tasted the all too familiar taste and texture... THEY WERE FROM A CAN!   What restaurant serves canned dolmades???  It's not only offensive, it's gross.  There wasn't rice inside, just a soft mushy rice paste, and yeah, you can taste the metal from these things that have been soaking in this can for who knows how long.  If any of you have had canned dolmades, you know exactly what I mean.  Not acceptable from a restaurant...they are not hard to make, and they are also cheap to make.  It's like giving your customers the middle finger....good dolmades are really good, and that's what I was expecting....I'm sure that many people order these as an appetizer...why not just make some you dill-holes? olives were olives, but again, no oil, no herbs (despite what the menu said).... After our meal here it all seemed pretty obvious....they lure you in with the large open patio, then serve you turds because they know they will get away with it.  If you blatantly skimp on the most basic element of Greek cooking (olive oil) and serve canned versions of greek staples (dolmades...and according to other reviews this is not the only case of canned & frozen ingredients), along with screwing up something as simple and essential as hummus, then it really shows how little they care about the food they serve and the people paying to eat there. I've eaten better food at hole in the wall joints for half the price.  They should be ashamed serving that wack ass sh!t.  SKIP ATHENA AND GO SOMEPLACE ELSE....",0.9692,0.804,0.117,0.079,0.4427716727716727

I don't often dine outdoors considering most restaurants believe outdoor seating is a mini stretch of 4 tables along a car exhaust filled road. But Athena was everything but...fountains with flowers, plenty of room away from the road, and a huge outdoor space to accommodate at least a hundred diners. This place was made for Chicago summers.  If you are a fan of tzatziki, Athena is your place. Combined with the pita bread, I could have made a meal on that and hummus alone. The yogurt sauce seemed to be very light on cucumber and heavy on lemon which was a pleasant change. They were both outstanding. The saganaki was very lemon forward and summery. Sharing one order among 4 people wasn't easy.  For dinner I went with the gyro plate. I was disappointed to learn they don't make the gyros in house. But I loved getting additional servings of tzatziki and pita bread for my entree. The gyros were served with plenty of onions as well and the portion sizes here are generous.  Athena is a tremendous value. I've really gotten into Greek food lately and this place hit the spot. And on a warm summer day there's really no place I'd rather be than eating lunch on their patio.

Ok, so now I have to pick my third option for dinner?  Whatever. What this means now is that a good chunk of our dinners are being made about 15 minutes after the rest of the group. 1 of 2 outcomes: 1. everyone gets their meal and then feels forced to wait until the rest of the group is served or 2. The servers keep the food back and serve all at once, inevitably making some dishes overdone or cold. Finally, the food comes.  It is not great at all.  The lamb, of course, was good but that is a matter of lamb being delicious and not of the skill of the chef.

Everything was pretty good but not great. My lamb shank was very tender and served on a bed of rice, and the meat was not as blood-red as my neighbor's serving.  Even though we were basically sponges at this dinner function, we were treated very pleasantly by the staff. When they light up about twelve plates of saganaki simultaneously, it does look like a re-enactment of the Olympic flame!

2010-10-19,3.0,"Much like we still do today, the Greeks used to honor their deities by naming things after them (though we do this with secular ""gods"" like politicians and sports figures). This was in hopes of giving the thing or person who shared the name the attributes of said higher being. Athena was the Greek goddess of war, civilization, wisdom, strength, strategy, crafts, justice, and skill. What any of these attributes have to do with this restaurant though, I'm not sure. So I think it might be misnamed. Being a helpful guy, I have a couple of suggestions for renaming it.  For example, I think a far more appropriate name for this place would be Hermes.  Hermes was the Greek god of speed. And this place is fast. Of all the places up-and-down the Greektown strip that I've been, this was by far the quickest service I've ever received. It was almost as if the waiter was telepathic (or perhaps assisted by the gods or subliminal thoughts from my boss). Only a few minutes after the order left my lips, the vegetarian moussaka was in front of me. This place actually understands the time crunch of a business lunch.  Or maybe I would call this place Hades. The prices would definitely have pleased Hades (the Greek god of, ironically, both money and the underworld). And, therefore, they pleased me. In contrast to the places around it, most dishes here are under $10.00. And they have a large, vegetarian friendly, lunch special menu.  Unfortunately, one thing I would not re-moniker this place to is Dionysus (the Greek god of food and wine). While the food was pretty good, it would by no means live up the exacting standards of the gods - at least the moussaka. It was sort of rich, but not the sort of taste sensation I'm used to from the dish. It seemed to rely on the mushrooms (ick) rather than the eggplant (or when I find myself lucky, potato). And if there's one thing you don't want to do, because legend says they're pretty liberal and vicious with the lightning bolts and all, it's piss off a Greek god with anything less than the best in their name.   Though mentioning all those names, I guess Athena is one of the easiest on the tongue and the modern ear of the Greek gods.

The pastitsio was well seasoned, however, the pasta was overcooked before it was even baked, so although the flavor was well developed, the texture was that of the spaghetti at the old country buffet. The gyros plate consisted of the meat in the usual preparation, sliced onion and tomatoes, but only only one, small pita cut into four pieces, overcharred on the bottom and edges. The meat could have used a touch more seasoning, as well as the tzatziki, which is something that just needs to be right. The saganaki was nicely cooked, albeit being overly salty and the absence of the ""opah,"" was a little bit of a let down.  All in all, the food was wasn't great, but much better than most fly by night restaurants who try to pass of what they are serving as Greek food. And among the friendly service, the price is also fair for dining out in Chicago.  Tip: wait to be seated outside. Somehow, it just makes this place.

2010-08-09,4.0,"I don't know much about Greek food, nor did I ever think I'd find myself dining in a Greek restaurant since they aren't the most vegetarian friendly places, but I was more than surprised by Athena. I found myself there for a late lunch one afternoon with a friend who was visiting the neighborhood.  We wanted something that was low-key, outdoor, and not far from the condo.  After a half hour of walking around, we found ourselves at the beautiful outdoor patio at Athena.  It was well past the lunch crowd so we had the place basically to ourselves and cozied down in the back near the shaded trees.  I looked at the menu and was concered about what I would get to eat until I saw I could order the Cold Combo appetizer plate.  I switched out the fish appetizer for hummus and they were very accomodating about it.  Like I said earlier, I don't know much about Greek food, but the hummus and the tzatziki with the grilled pita, feta cheese, and pepperoncini pepper definitely hit the spot.  I ended up going again there for dinner when my fiances parents came down to meet us.  They loved it too.  My fiances dad eats chicken and ordered a chicken dish and was very happy with it as well. We have ordered out from Athena several times since and have never been disappointed.  The owners and the staff are super friendly and I love the ambience of the patio.  Even though it's always busy, it's still always a good time.  I wouldn't recommend going if you are in a rush to get somewhere else, but it's a great place to chill and relax with friends and family for lunch or dinner.",0.9971,0.753,0.225,0.022,0.4988562091503268

I liked Costa's a lot and was saddened by its closing. I am a big fan of Greek food and Keri H was in the mood for it last Thursday. We also wanted to eat outside and have full bellies before heading to the CYBG event. There's not too many places in G-town that offer up outdoor seating. I like Pegasus better, but they only serve appetizers on their rooftop patio, so Athena became our destination merely by default. It was a sweltering summer's eve, but we can take a lot of heat so sitting outside was no issue for us. The patio was nearly full, so obviously many people aren't bothered by the heat. We sat down, and in the interest of saving our alcohol consumption for strawberry-basil lemonade at Pour, we nixed drinking at Athena. I have to say, it was unnerving to see mojitos and margaritas on a drink menu at a Greek restaurant. Keri isn't too familiar with Greek food, so she let me take the reins once again. Since no meal in Greektown is complete without an order of saganaki, we ordered that, and added a Greek salad and fried zucchini to start. I chuckled to myself as I heard the table next to us order ""Nagasaki"" as I wasn't aware that a city in Japan could be served on a menu in a Greek restaurant. I digress. The saganaki arrived, but sadly, there were no exclamations of ""Opaa"" nor any flaming of the cheese. What was up with that? After tasting the cheese, it was apparent that no such flaming would have helped. It was salty and not good. I warned Keri that it was a strong cheese, but her tastebuds weren't sufficiently prepared. It was like eating a salt lick. The salad was your basic Greek salad. Moving along... Fried zucchini is good, especially with a generous squeeze of lemon, but there's not much one can fry and have it not taste good. We were still hungry so we ordered some gyros and a chicken kabob. Pretty safe things, or so I thought, until they arrived. The gyros were decent, but really, one can get better. Keri took one look and sniff at the kebob and proclaimed that it smelled like garbage. One bite and she said it tasted like vomit. Um....check please. We choked down a few more bites and got the heck outta dodge.  Sigh. I miss Costa's. Side note: if you come here and sit outside, DO NOT sit next to one of trees on the patio.

This is exactly how I felt after dinner Saturday night.  My family and I always enjoy going here for our Greek fix, but I was a little disappointed with my most recent experience.  Let it be known they don't take reservations for their AMAZING outdoor area. A shame, but understandable. I had made a reservation for 5 at 8 pm Saturday the week prior.  When we stepped in the door we were greeted; I gave my name, reservation time, group number, etc.  I was told it would be just a minute as he walked away for what I thought would be to arrange our table.  Five minutes later, the guy had still not returned.  A girl walked up later and we had to give the same information. We were then seated at a table that had been available the entire time we waited- not a huge deal but kind of a wtf moment. To start, we ordered the fried calamari, saganaki, and a greek salad to share.  YUM. The calamari is always tender and delicious. Saganaki was very good, and the feta on the salad was soooo good.  For dinner I ordered the shrimp athena.  I have ordered it before and really enjoyed it.  Everyone's came out together except mine which should have set off an alarm. Some of my party ordered lamb, beef, etc. and I ordered a shrimp meal that's supposed to consist of shrimp, rice, tomato sauce, and veggies (timing seems off, right?).  I didn't mind that mine came a little later, but what I did mind was that it was not done properly AT ALL.  It's supposed to be baked in a tomato sauce- there was absolute none.  And the veggies were uncooked- almost raw (even the baby carrots).  I'm assuming my dish was forgotten or someone just didn't know what they were doing.  I'll go with the former since it came out later than everyone else's. I wish they would have told me the issue, and then prepared my dish properly.  If they had, I would have been more forgiving in my review.  The other's in my group enjoyed their meals. My sister had an amazing lamb special with artichoke that was almost like a stew- so good. We had the ek met for dessert which was also very good.  The bill came out to about 65 bucks a person (including tip) for apps, drinks, 2 bottles of wine, main course, dessert, and coffee.... not too bad.",0.9953,0.784,0.166,0.05,0.45862637362637365

I caught this fine gentleman literally making fun of more than a few of us under his breath after taking our order, bossing us around, interrupting frequently and performing alarming eyebrow-waggling.  I really had high hopes for this place, squeezed snugly in between Roditys and the Parthenon (totally should have gone with the tried & true, sorry, Parthenon!), on Halsted in the heart of Greektown. I had done appetizers & drinks at Athena a few months ago and absolutely fell in love with the ambiance, the warmth of the room (everything was glowy and toasty yellow inside), and the cute little working fireplaces scattered throughout the dining area. I'd never tried taramosalata before and holy fajoley, it's dollops of heaven served in tiny white bowls. Whipped potato and fish eggs never tasted so good, served on warm lightly browned pita triangles. I plan on bathing in the stuff (you can order by the jar from Amazon, of course) and perhaps that will wash away the memories of my birthday dinner there on Friday.  There were 19 in our party total and considering the place remained partially 3/4 full the rest of the night, I think our waiter really could have at least pretended to be pleased we were there- we would certainly be his biggest check the entire evening and at a little over $500, (not that high considering but still)- including entrees and multiple cocktails, when my friends were able to order & receive them in a timely manner, that is. We might as well have only ordered water with no ice and a plate of lemon, please for the quality of service we received. After being seated, Mr. Cockroach decided to show his shining brown face and flex his shapely legs before our water glasses had even been filled, in the middle of the table. My friend screamed, threw a plate over it, nobody paid us any mind, Mr. C the Waiter eventually sauntered over with a wadded up napkin in hand and a vaguely questioning/threatening look on his face. We point at the upended saucer. We really don't feel we should have to explain anything further. Mr. C peeks under the plate...hesitates. Finally puts his wadded up napkin to good use and then...saunters away! Not a single word or utterance of an apology passes his lips or even a blanch of mortification or consternation crosses this guy's face. We have to call after him and send a busboy to convince the waiter, that yes, we really do think the whole tablecloth ought to be changed, don't you? No apologies. No explanations. No managers.

Another friend of mine figured out that the bartender was very accommodating and willing to share a complimentary glass of wine with her since apparently, Mr. C the Waiter seemed kinda pissed because she couldn't make up her mind fast enough for him or something. So the bartender...he was cool.  At the end of the evening, after subpar food (appetizers: still fantastic; most of us couldn't finish our entrees. My chicken breast lemonati was pretty underwhelming), again, my friends had to both ask to speak to the manager to discuss the cockroach situation and the charming 'service'. We got a whopping $35 off the bill in recompense. Boooo, hiss. The waiter got suuuper nice to us once he saw us talking to the Big Boss, funnily enough.

2010-01-07,1.0,"I used to think that all restaurants in Greek town were pretty much the same thing.  Well, I guess I found the dud in the bunch.  I went to Athena on a Tuesday night with one friend.  Yes, they did have free valet parking, but pretty much all the restaurants do.  We walked in and they still had full on Christmas decorations (this was on 1/5, so slightly late).  The restaurant was pretty empty, which should have been our first sign that we had made a mistake. I love all of the traditional Greek dishes (I studied abroad there for a semester) so I got a vegetarian platter than came with pastichio, dolmades, moussaka, vegetables, and potatoes.  It sounded like the perfect dish, because I hate to have to choose.  My friend ordered the gyros.  Our food came out within about 5 minutes.  It was clear that it had been around for a few hours (or days) and they just heated it up.  And they didn't even do a good job heating it, as my dish was still cold.   The moussaka looked burnt and was missing some of the key ingredients like the belchamal (sp?) sauce that is usually the best part on top.  The pastichio was like a spanakopita with weird noodles baked in.  Maybe I am just a Greek food snob since I lived there, but the rest of the restaurants in Greektown seem to know what's up.  My friend's gyros were also pretty bad.  The meat seemed really dried out an old too.  There was also a fly flying around our table for the whole meal which was pretty unappetizing as well.  So, not all restaurants in Greektown are created equal...stay away from Athena.  Greek Islands always is good in my opinion, as are most of the others I have been to (Santorini, Venus, Pegasus, a few others I think)",0.9888,0.725,0.187,0.088,0.5427083333333333

Greek Islands had been recommended to us but the wait there was something like an hour, so we went down the street to Athena Restaurant. In comparison, this restaurant was maybe half-full. I learned my lesson that night: if there is an hour wait at a similar restaurant down the street, don't go to the half-empty joint. The service was strange. Initially, our waiter basically ignored us/acted totally abrupt. He'd bring menus, hand them to us without making eye contact and nearly run away before one of us could request water, or a drink. With this abrupt service, it took us about a half hour to get drinks and waaaaaaaaay too long to finally order. Then, as the meal progressed, he became much more attentive and... nice? Concerned? It was like having Hyde and then Jekyll wait on us. Or as though, halfway through our meal, he realized his tip just might be based upon the actual service. Like, we already hated you dude. No chance of redemption.  The food was okay. Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of Greek food, so maybe the sample platter type thing I ordered was a bad idea. I did enjoy a few of the items, but everything on the plate kind of tasted the same. I was not wowed. So that's part one of my Greektown experience.

2009-10-04,5.0,"I don't understand how this place only has three stars. Maybe the other reviewers are too sensitive? The only bad thing I could say about this place is that the waiters are quite abrupt - but even that isn't enough for me to deduct a star from my rating. So far, I've been here twice, and both times I was seated outside (at my party's request). I haven't been inside yet, but the outside is gorgeous. Weather permitting (and we know it doesn't usually permit), I would recommend anyone sit outside. If you want to see your saganaki on fire, though, you should try sitting inside because typically they don't light the saganaki outside due to the wind. Both times I've been here, there was no wait. Both times the service was abrupt but fast. The abruptness honestly didn't bother me, because I've encountered that at Greek restaurants both here in Chicago and back home. I prefer my waiters to be speedy rather than friendly - but I guess that's just a personal preference. I'm a vegetarian, but I love Greek food, so typically I just wind up getting appetizers. Both times I've been to the Athena Restaurant, I've ordered two or three appetizers and shared them with whoever I was with. So far, I've had the skordalia, the saganaki (of course), the kolokithitakia, and the feta cheese (I'm a BIG fan of feta cheese, so I'll just eat it by itself sometimes). I would suggest any of these appetizers, but if you're going to get the skordalia by itself (the kolokithitakia comes with skordalia), I would suggest getting something to dip in it.

The interior is nice- fireplace, white linen topped tables, and a bar with the obligatory grape vines circling overhead.  We ordered a range of food as I had my nephews with me who had never been to a Greek restaurant before and I wanted them to taste a range of flavors.  The winners? The gyro plate, calamari, saganaki, and the pork cutlet special of the day served over spaghetti.  The losers? The pastitsio which I love- was a little dry and lacked the bechamel sauce that usually makes it great. And the peas that were served with it were mushy and had an odd flavor.  Service was spotty. Our server was missing through most of the meal and we had a hard time getting refills on the drinks or even on the water (which we desperately needed given the heat!)

I'm a huge fan of the Bird's Eye veggies that you simply pop in the microwave and is ready in minutes. It was all coming together. Lol. My pasta was basically a few noodles with tons of frozen veggies that were tossed in the microwave. BLAH!!!!! I was so upset I didn't finish it and just took the rest home.  I don't think I'll be returning. I really think I can make better pasta at home with the Bird's Eye veggies!",0.9812,0.777,0.144,0.079,0.45011904761904764

I know it seems like the last thing you'd associate with a Greek restaurant, but here's why:  My old company came here for a celebration dinner a few years back. My old boss is a joker and all-around troublemaker; he challenged a co-worker to chug a bottle of Tabasco AND not get sick for 30 minutes afterward. So, we all watched in anticipation and horror as she sprinkled a 2/3 full bottle of Tabasco into her mouth, neighboring tables even began to cheer her on. She finished the bottle, but her downfall was the second half, the time portion, of the challenge. Win or lose, she's a champ in my book. That empty bottle now has a place of honor in old boss' office.  I returned tonight for a quick bite with friends before catching a production of the Vagina Monologues. We started off with Saganaki, we're suckers for flaming cheese. It's good, but I don't really thing flaming cheese can be bad. Our table got: vegetable Moussaka, stuffed chicken breast, and Mediterranean pasta for me.  I heard no complaints so I'll assume my friend's dishes were good. Mine was just OK, not stellar. The menu said the dish came with a light cream sauce, but I didn't really taste any cream sauce it actually was a bit on the dry side. The veggies were tasty, but I wished they used smaller carrots, they were full baby carrots and a bit undercooked making them hard to stab with my fork.

My entree was something new to me -- sauteed pork filets served with pasta and vegetables -- and was very good.

2007-11-18,1.0,"Bleh. I was here last night with a group of 5 people, and here's what I remember from the experience: 1) FRUIT FLIES. We were all constantly shooing away fruit flies to keep them from landing on our food. This happened with every course they brought out. It makes me wonder what the hell is going on in the back, and if the flies had their way with my tomato before it made it to my plate. Then I tried not to think about that. 2) VERY LOUD. It was so loud, I'm still typing in caps the next day. I think it's cuz they have no accoustic dampening materials on the walls, so if the place gets full on a Saturday night and you're sitting in a corner, it's like sitting in a giant echo chamber and you have to shout at each other.

The triangle pastry things (spankopita?) were pretty good. Everything was *extremely* salty. Therefore this is a good place to go if you're PMS'ing. 4) The bathrooms were pretty clean, and they say that's a good way to tell if they're clean in the kitchen, right? Except for the fruit fly thing. *shudder* 5) The service was ok. The waiter seemed really busy and so we would go loooong stretches of time without seeing him, but he was a nice guy. And they were pretty good at re-filling water glasses, almost too good. Like they watch you drinking from your glass and stand there and wait for you to finish drinking so that they can refill that 2 inches of water you just depleted.

It was too hot and muggy to try the patio - otherwise I might have given another star just for the patio. I had the calamari as an entree- and I probably could have gotten by (at least in any other restarurant.....) with calamari as an appetizer- but the waiter more or less ""encouraged"" the entree portion- When we left, John characterized the cold appetizer portion as ""skimpy"" and thought the waiter was ""pushy"".  At the end, I ordered the baklava-now maybe it was because  there were three of us- and only one order- but the piece of baklava was both very good and more than big enough.

The best thing I've had here was one of the greek salads- it has feta, dill, kalamata olives, a great dressing and veggies. Its delicious. The dill gives it an added unique flavor. They also carry very good greek wines that will not break the bank. Ask your server for a recommedation. The yogurt dessert is a little odd, but its something interesting to try.
