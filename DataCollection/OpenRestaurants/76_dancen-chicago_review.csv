2017-07-21,4.0,"A couple of our friends suggested Dancen for a dinner date. I have to admit that the moment I walked into this restaurant I immediately wanted to step out. If you are looking for something fancy or upscale this is not your place! However, don't judge a book by its cover! This restaurant is dark, and honestly it does not even look like a restaurant but more like a ""sports bar"" (maybe?). Anyways, since our friends brought us here we decided to give it a shot! Wow, was I in for a surprise! The food here is absolutely phenomenal!  We had the spicy, crispy pork skin and cheese smothered chicken (P.S very unhealthy) and the food was beyond my expectations! I could not wait to come back another day for more! The service is not great, since usually only 2 or 3 people are visible (1 of them is cooking near you). So just imagine 2 people trying to serve more than 25 people.  The restaurant is not very big and if you want a spot you should get there right at 6 P.M. A downfall is that they do not open until 6 and if you get there around 7:30-8 you might have to wait! Plenty of parking though!",0.8425,0.853,0.095,0.052,0.5889148351648352

2017-05-21,4.0,"This place is great for late night eating.  I would say it's the top places to get good comfort Korean food.  It is small with limited seating (up to 25-30 people).  They cook most of their food over the grill and sometimes with huge flames and fire that looks kind of hazardous depending on what dish you order.  It is also dark and dim so make sure you have your flash on if you want to take pictures inside.   My friends and I ordered the crispy pork skin, sweet and spicy chicken, pork ribs, and the fire chicken with cheese.  If you are more of a texture eating kind person, you will like the crispy pork skin.  Everything is edible so you don't have to spit out the bone part.  You will need to chew a lot and your jaw will get a good workout.  It is a little spicy too.   The sweet and spicy chicken is really good and it comes with cheese and ddukbokki (stir-fried rice cakes).  It's very tasty and oily.  It's a good go-to dish if you want to please everyone's taste buds.  It only comes with 5-6 small ddukbokki so I only had one because I was with a large group.  I wish they put more In it because they fry it just right so you have that crispy texture on the outside and the chewiness In the inside.  So good.  The pork ribs were okay and it had more of the grill taste and flavor to it.  Lastly, the fire chicken is supposed to be the spiciest dish on the menu.  If you dare to try it, go for it.  You will pay for it when you go use the bathroom the next day.  If you order it with cheese, then it will help subdue the spiciness of the chicken.  It comes with chicken drumsticks but when we ordered ours, it was more charred and kind of burnt on the outside.  They use a HUGE flame of fire to cook the fire chicken hence the name of it.",0.9508,0.85,0.111,0.039,0.6191710758377423

The food is super spicy, but not in an overpowering or overwhelming way because it's all still very flavorful. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place if you can't handle heat. A great way to cool down is by drinking their soju yogurt cocktail pitcher. It has a smoothie consistency and if you have enough, you can leave with a little buzz.

If you're looking for the grill your own meat at the table option, you won't find that here, but what you will find is the best food for the best price. As many others have mentioned- get the fire chicken. My other favorite dishes include the crispy fried pork skin and the DIY season rice balls (they give you food prep gloves so you can make your own). The cheesy fire chicken is good but I think it takes away from the flavor of the chicken so I recommend sticking with the original. And how can you go wrong with a cauldron pot of warm sake? Trust me..order exactly what I just mentioned and you will have plenty of food for two and be nice and tipsy by the time you leave.  Yes- the place looks a little sketchy from the outside, especially with it's tinted windows and the area has a strange feel to it..but get over that, go inside and enjoy the amazing food and drink specials.

A friend and I met for dinner on a cold, blustering night without a wait; we'd heard the restaurant gets packed outside of hibernation season. Since we're not familiar with Korean food, the waiter helped us navigate the menu.  Of course we ordered the ""fire chicken,"" marinated in chile, gochuchang, soy, and rice syrup, charred on the grill, and smothered in melted cheese to cut the heat. (We didn't find the dish too spicy, but our American palettes did wish for some rice to accompany it.) In any case, we liked pairing the chicken with the Thousand Island-topped cabbage that comes on the side. We also tried the seafood pancake, addictive with its dipping sauce. I wasn't as obsessed with the spicy rice cake, which--to our surprise--came stewed with assorted seafood and hard-boiled eggs. Maybe if I'd had the right expectations?

Anyways, it's a cool place to hang out with friends and enjoy some grilled meats and some drinks.  I would come back if I was in the area.",0.81,0.849,0.097,0.054,0.5563311688311688

Kimchi pancake might have been my favorite thing.  We ordered some kabobs but nothing else from the grill.  That was a mistake.  We also got a soup that could feed 6 and a dish that was cooked on our table.   All great.  Looking forward to going back on a cold winter day.",0.9791,0.773,0.184,0.043,0.5458994708994709

Sampled some food and after living a year in china and eating tons of korean food there, gave my nod of approval. The soju (which I wish I drank more of) that they ordered was mixed with my favorite yogurt drink (which sounds gross but think of the small little plastic yogurt drinks that come in a pack of 8 and have red foil tops) which is...amazing. You can hardly taste the alcohol but there's definitely soju in that thing.

If the rice makes you too full just get the pork cartilage dish without the rice -- tasty and not as spicy as the fire chicken. last but not least, quench the fire with a bowl of traditional korean rice wine (makgeolli) which is slightly sweet and bubbly. the one thing i dislike is it can get SUPER crowded at night and the place is small with limited seating so you might get stuck sitting at the bar where it's a little hard to breathe.

The pork skin comes with this interesting powder ""sauce"" that you dip it in, but it totally works. The fire chicken with cheese is also very delicious but VERY SPICY.... They both come in these little cast iron plates. I would say it's a decent size to fill you up, but definitely not worth the price you pay for it. 2. Service: There was only one guy taking all the orders, grilling the food, etc., so it took FOREVER for the food to come out. It was about 30-40 minutes after we received the first dish that we got the second, which is unacceptable. They definitely need to get a better system. 3. Environment: The place is small - not many tables and probably good for 4-5 people max. I went during a weekday so it wasn't too bad, but I heard it gets super packed during the weekends. It's darker inside and Korean music playing in the background, which I can't complain too much about. It's unfortunate that I can only give this place with such amazing food only 3 stars, but honestly, the service is what brings it down.

The staff to start off with was some kind of nothing(not one person was helpful). We had to keep asking the guy on the grill for water while we were waiting for him to finish our food.

The chicken was cooked really well, however I don't know what this white sauce/fat substance was on the bottom of the plate it looked like lard or something.

On Tuesday May 10, I and my husband went there to have dinner around 10 pm. We came in to the restaurant but not nice greeting much from a server. His name is Parker. So we ordered our food as usual, but one thing we couldn't eat was beef large intestine. It was very chewy, we had only one piece. So I asked a server that can we change to something else because we even couldn't chew. But the answer that I got from server was, it's already made ... You ate it and you have to pay for it and he seems very angry. That's not the point that we have to pay, we can pay for it but we were just curious if we could change it to something else. If not, a server could have a better answer without attitude. So I said, but few places could change if your food wasn't satisfied. Or is it your restaurant policy that we couldn't cancel or make any change? And the bad answer ever that I have heard from a server was, you can go to another place then! I paused for 3 sec. to think about his answer, it wasn't RIGHT at all when I and my husband heard. As a server, he shouldn't say that to any customers at all !  Then he took a beef intestine from my table and dumped it in trash right away, and put a plate down very loud ... It's very rude for me. So I asked for a manger, he said he is a manger which I think he is not. If he is a real manger, he should have a better way to talk to customers and shouldn't done anything bad in front of customers.

Other favorites include the Fire Squid, Clam Soup, Pork Cutlets, Webfoot Octopus and Pork, and reheated Tteokbokki leftovers. I'd eat anything on this menu. I love spicy food!

There was nothing strange about this place at all -so just be aware that many other reviews play up the differences of the place. We walked in - and none of us are Korean - and everyone was nice. It was not like some of the places in LA. Our server was super friendly and had some suggestions for us right away and off we went.  The service was excellent. When we wanted napkins, water, or more booze, we just asked. No problems.  We had the strawberry frozen drink - two pitchers and loved them both!  We had the kimchee and tofu, followed by the seafood pancake, fire chicken, and mixed kabob. Everything was amazing.  Next time I would skip the mixed kabob and just go for the steak and chicken - there were some odd pieces of meat (I am saying this as a non-Korean) that we did not like so much.  The fire chicken comes with these big chicken bones which were a trip. We just chewed on the meaty edges and joked about fighting over them like cavemen and cave-women.  Lots of younger Korean couples out on dinner dates and having a nice time. A very welcoming place with wonderful food.  We took a cab, but I think there is parking in the back alley.

I'm a huge fan of dduk bokki and Dancen delivered on their version.  The fire chicken was well flavored and had a great smokiness to it (the bartender was grilling it right at the bar).  Not to mention that the prices are really reasonable (both dishes were $10 each).  We went on a Thursday night and they were open til 2 AM so another plus. I was debating between 4 and 5 stars for this place as the service isn't the best but  their delicious well-priced food won me over.  I will be back Dancen!,0.9358,0.782,0.162,0.056,0.6569430569430568

I found this place searching for a place that serves dukbokki in Chicago, having become obsessed with it as comfort food while living in China.  (No, that doesn't really make sense, but just roll with it.  Korea is closer to China than it is to Chicago, anyway, so it sort of works.) At any rate, Dancen is the sketchiest-looking restaurant/bar I've ever walked into.  To the point where my boyfriend and I almost turned around and walked right back out.

2011-08-17,4.0,"I know Dancen seriously looks like a vampire layer from the outside - its windows are blocked and there are usually Korean guys smoking on the sidewalk who will side-eye you as you go in. And to be honest it kind of looks like a vampire layer on the inside too. It's small and dark, with little ""decorative"" multi-colored lights around the restaurant. It's a strange vibe. To people who have never been to Korea - no, Korea is not like this. Mostly.  The servers look like emo kids that started drinking soju and smoking cigarettes at 13, and they're not the friendliest bunch, but they took our order and brought us our food, which was enough for me. The cook that I saw that day looked so much like a legit Korean mom that I almost took off my shoes so I wouldn't get yelled at. But the food. Oh, the food. Seafood pancakes and kimchi jigae just like my mom makes it! Everything was perfect. The fire chicken was perfection. If you're not familiar with Korean food, I would say the fire chicken is a safe bet, just be warned that it's pretty spicy.  They have some TVs that were playing Sports Center when we went in for dinner, which is a negative for date night. Note to the boyfriend, eyes on ME, and not the TV behind me!

2011-04-29,2.0,"1. Their food is perfect, and delicious. Wonderful!! I crave it often. 2. Their service is TERRIBLE. I've been here over a dozen times, with numerous little stories to tell, but the one that happened recently has made me pretty much stop going back to the place. Setting: Packed Friday night. It also happened to be my birthday! We walk in, and they tell us they have no tables at the moment and do not give us a waiting time, implying that we should just leave. We ask if we can get it to-go, and we walked up to order. He told us it'd be a 45-minute wait! Long, but like I mentioned earlier, their food is great.  We asked him if it would be possible get a table if in the time before we get our food a table opens up. He said yes, but we saw THREE tables leave in the course of waiting and we asked each time if we could sit down there, but he REFUSED, giving us an excuse that some people outside smoking had come before us. BULLCRAP. There was no one! And I saw him invite other people who entered AFTER us those seats!  It was just blatant complete rudeness. I guess I never thought any restaurant would exercise their ""right to refuse service to anyone"" on me! We waited for an hour, completely baffled at what just happened.",0.8765,0.791,0.12,0.089,0.5318001443001446
2011-04-22,5.0,"OMG. I think I found a new favorite.  It's dark and not very attractive-looking on the inside. The tables are also mounted on some kind of (wooden? I forgot) block. I had no leg room. There were at least three TV screens playing hockey (The Blackhawks beat the Vancouver team on the night we went, by the way. Yay!). As Mike K. noted, the people who come here are serious about drinking and eating, and so were we! We first ordered makegeolli (Korean rice wine) and soju. The makegeolli is milky white in color and it's served in a big bowl, where you can then use a ladle to serve it among yourselves in smaller bowls.  It's a very sweet wine. You can barely taste the alcohol. It was my first time trying this, and I loved it. Soju, do I have to explain that? Chances are, if you're reading this review, you're probably looking for a Korean bar/restaurant and you probably know what soju is. One of my friends describe it like the Korean version of vodka. That's probably more or less correct. The other woman in my party was also a big fan of soju, and I'm glad because otherwise I wouldn't have had anyone to drink with me (the guys were a little less enthusiastic about it). The best part about this place? The food here is soooooo good! Seriously, who knew a dark and almost scary-looking bar could serve such delicious food! I was amazed. Now, I don't know the name of the food items my friends ordered though so I'll try to be as descriptive as possible. I really love their plate of boiled tofu wedges served cold topped with stir-fry pork slices and kimchi. I'm a big fan of tofu, and I'm also a big fan of pork and kimchi, so when you put the two together, I'm a very happy person. I also really like kimchi when it's cooked, so that's another plus. There was a chicken dish that I didn't like as much, but it was still very good. The chicken pieces were grilled and there was shredded cabbage on the side. What I didn't really like was the amount of sesame seeds on the chicken. My friends loved this dish though.  Then my absolute favorite item of the night was the fish cod soup... or at least I think that's what it was called. I had a glance at the menu (they have English!), so I think this is it but I don't understand a word of Korean so I don't know for sure what my friends had ordered. The funny thing is that I went with a new group of friends, and so they were worried that I would not be able to take the spice. Bring it on! The soup was VERY spicy. In fact, it's red in color. I loved it. Then they told me that there were fish intestines in the soup. Hey, I'm Chinese, we eat almost everything. The tofu in the soup helped a lot with the spice.  I had actually ate some food before I came here with my new friends, and I initially thought that I wouldn't be able to eat, but I ate and ate and ate...

2008-03-03,4.0,"I don't know what it is about Korean bars but they sure like to keep things understated and vague.  Take Dancen, for example.  I've passed this place a zillion times and never paid any mind.  When my friends wanted to come here I insisted no Korean bars were around this location and thought they all went insane. I was wrong. Dancen is very real and very Korean.  They've been doing a better job of catering to non-Koreans lately as evidenced by me seeing the very first non-Korean in the place a few weeks ago and they hiring a server that speaks very good English (but then again maybe the original servers spoke excellent English, too - I wouldn't know to compare as I only spoke to them in Korean - sorry!). The interior is pretty dark and sparse.  This is a place for serious drinking and eating.  This being said, this place tends to attract an older crowd.  There's no scenery to admire here.  You have one big screen projection TV in the front and a smaller TV in the back showing the game of the day but outside of that, it's tables, chairs and a bar.  You ready to get down, or what? Just like any other Korean bar, they have the liquor ready.  You want it, they'll make it happen.  If you're looking for beer specials, you're probably better off hitting up Hourglass but other than that, the alcohol is status quo here.   The specialty of the house is their ""bul-ddak"" which translates into ""fire chicken"".  As you can already piece together, it's a pretty damn spicy chicken.  It's very good and hot.  They have a spicy pork but I personally think the chicken is the piece de resistance (French + Korean Bar review = serious pwnage). Our usual set up is the ""bul-ddak"", ""bu-dae jigae"" (army stew), ""ddukbokki"" (their ddukbokki [spicy rice cake] has thicker dduk [rice cake] than most places and comes w/ myun [crystal noodles] as you'd find in ""naeng-myun"") and countless bottles of Bek Se Ju until they kick us out.
