2017-09-04,3.0,"Max's Take Out is a hole in the wall located two blocks from Millennium Park. Typically when I think of hole in the wall, I think of exceptionally tasty food for a great price. However I can't say the same for Max's. My friend and I wanted to try out a Chicago dog from the great city itself from another place, however due to the weird hours of the other establishment we stumbled upon this place based on the excellent Yelp reviews.  We each opted for two of their hot dogs and a drink running in close to $10. The hot dog itself comes with the traditional toppings found in a Chicago dog, such as tomatoes, slice of pickle, and hot peppers. The hot dog itself was average and honestly tasted worst then a hot dog place I go to back at home in VA that specializes in Chicago dogs. The beef and bread itself were pretty lackluster in my opinion which led me to that conclusion. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with my experience here. This place is probably excellent when you get the munchies, however it just didn't satisfy my Chicago dog craving.",0.9511,0.804,0.133,0.063,0.6969999999999998

There are, I want to say, 10 seats along the left when you walk in. There are napkins and hand sanitizer on the right.

I work near Monroe and Wells and I walk a couple of city blocks just to eat this delicious hot dog because it's just that good! It is always packed during lunch time so I recommend going after 1:00 pm when things have died down. They are freakishly fast so expect your meal to be done rather quickly.

I personally appreciate that you can see how the food is made since they have an open kitchen. They do take credit card and cash. They don't have an actually area where you can sit and eat, it's more of a place where you stand and eat. I usually walk to the Gardens of the Art Museum and enjoy lunch there!  Ps.

I was recommended by a friend to go to Super Dawg's but never made it up that way so Max's would have to do.  Chicago style hot dog vs. New York style hot dog. The only difference in my opinion was the additional toppings. The hot dog itself was a normal size loaded up with mustard, relish, onions, a giant pickle, tomatoes, and hot peppers (I think I got them all). I'll admit once I had bitten into it the aroma of all of those ingredients combined gives off a nice taste. A little bit of sour and sweetness. However once I was half way into the dog itself I was kind of over the entire taste. I guess I was expecting more out of the bun itself or the hot dog itself instead it tasted like a NY style dog you would get from a stand filled up with whatever toppings you want.  On a lighter and positive note the fries were delicious and I got a good laugh out of the no ketchup rule unless you're under the age of 17. Of course they do have a bottle there for you if you would like and also throw in a few packets in the take out bag.

2015-02-05,3.0,"A visit to Chicago is said never to be complete without eating some steaming franks on hot dog rolls. That much I was certain about. But the question was, in a town known for processed meats, where do the working-class locals go to get their hot dog fix? To that end, I asked a Chi-town doorman for the best place to eat Chicago-style hot dogs. He in turn conferred with the rest of his uniformed coworkers, all of whom stood stiffly in front of a ritzy hotel off Michigan Ave, where I certainly could not afford to room.  ""Magsses!"" Replied a middle-aged, heavy-set African American doorman, without missing a beat.  Afraid I wouldn't find the place, unsure of what the man actually said, I carefully listened for directions. Directions which I promptly followed, being hesitant having to ask anyone else for directions, someone who may have a thicker accent still.   So Max's it was. A nondescript hole in the wall tucked among much fancier establishments. A few people stood in the lobby, waiting for their orders to be called as the kitchen crew toiled busily behind the counter and a balding gent stared as I approached the register.  Having never been there, I summoned all my non-existent Chi-cool and assuredly ordered hot dogs, whatever sounded best at the time. The order was promptly filled by a crew who doubtlessly has lost track of just how many hot dogs they must prepare daily.  As I put condiments of my hot dogs, the place, which had been filling up as I waited for my food, was by then full of hungry patrons, mostly white and appearing either like a motley cross section of downtown denizens or second-rate tourists, that is, just like me. The lobby, previously lined up with mostly empty stools, became almost impossible to navigate. Somehow, though, I found an empty spot and proceeded to chow. The first dog, the one with pickles and tomato, was . . . mediocre. Just. Meh. Luckily, I had possession of a second dog, on which my expectations now heavily fell. The second dog, a chilli dog, fared much better. But it simply was a pedestrian experience at best. Much like walking in at a DQ in Anywhere USA, where forgettable hot dogs are served to casual eaters, most of which couldn't care less about Chicago-style hot dogs, let alone Max's. But the second dog was the best of the two and boy, was I glad to have ordered it. The number of star on this review would have been lower, and my palate would also have been much sadder. Leaving the place, however, I felt a subtle pang of disappointment. And so I learned to never trust Chicago doormen on where to eat again.",0.9731,0.833,0.109,0.058,0.47393939393939394

2014-11-20,3.0,"It's a little hole in the wall. If you didn't find this on Yelp, you probably wouldn't think for a moment to try this place out. Bums stroll around outside, the place looks rundown, it just has no curb appeal whatsoever. But if you've decided to take a step in, along the way to the cashier, you'll notice several Chicago Dog posters from the past few decades. Chairs with a high bar table are situated along the left-hand side of the establishment. And then in the back is the overhead menu with cashier, and kitchen right behind. The two usual orders here are the Italian Beef Sandwich or Chicago Dog. I chose a Polish Chicago Dog ($3.89) which is a little thicker in texture and has a snappier skin. As I waited for my dog, I watched the chef carry several hot dogs from a refrigerated bin to put in a steam tray, where he proceeded to put water in the 2nd bed pan below. They were somewhat manhandled, hot doings going every which way in his two hands like the pick-up sticks game, with all hot dogs about to drop out of his hands at any moment. It all looked a bit disconcerting. If you can get over questionable preparation methods, read on. On top of the Chicago Dog is mustard, relish, onions, tomatoes, pickles, sports peppers, and celery salt. This almost classifies it a Chicago Dog except for one thing, Max's opted to use plain buns rather than a poppy seed bun. Thumbs down!! Now, if you can get over that slight oversight, then on to the hot dog. All the ingredients are standard-fare, evenly distributed along the length of the hot dog. But what are these huge quarter slices of tomato thrown on top? Large and obnoxious, dwarfing the size of the hot dog, I found myself taking a bite of it first to make the hot dog a little more appealing. Flavors are well-balanced, making for a fairly good hot dog, with the sports peppers adding some ample but tolerant heat.

A standing room counter adorns most of the store's perimeter, but I can not remember if there were any stools. I ordered the pastrami dog and a soda. $6.12. Not outrageous, but hardly the best value in town(although maybe the best value in this part of town). The guy seems a little miffed that I wasn't doing fries for another two bucks, but wasn't outwardly rude. The pastrami was delicious and moist, the Dijon sauce was delectable, the bun was steamed as I prefer, and the 1/8 lb. hotdog's casing had a snap to it that reminded me more of a Nathan's sausage than a Vienna beef product -- despite the endless Chicago hotdog regalia that litters the walls.

One thing about Chicago: they have a strong opinion against the use of ketchup on hot dogs and because of that, I thought that I would love it. It was just good despite the fact that Chicago hot dogs use mustard and pickles on their hot dogs (which, by the way, are two of my favorites that my family and friends here in California think I'm such a weirdo for refusing to eat my hot dogs with ketchup and using mustard instead like Chicagoans).

2012-04-07,3.0,"Okay, take this review with a grain of salt. We came to this place because we wanted to get cheddar fries after having wanted to find a great cheddar fries place for months. When I say cheddar fries, I mean Wisconsin cheddar, real-cheddar-melted-on-piping-hot-fries-fries. We read on one of the reviews that this place has the best cheese fries, because they use some sort of non-nacho cheese. But... when we got there, the cheese, sure was nacho cheese. It reminded me of the type of cheese fries I had in high school, except the fries admittedly were better fried and tasted fresher. But the cheese was definitely a HUGE disappointment. If you think you're coming here to eat some quality cheddar cheese fries, don't get your hopes up. Other than that though I would have given this place four stars. The burgers were delish. My friend had the gyro burger and I had the Italian beef burger. They were both really good and they were big for the price. They really do not skimp on the meat when they build your burger. Granted I could really taste the burger itself from the marinara sauce they lathered onto my burger but I could for sure taste the mozzarella cheese, the Italian meat, and the sweet peppers I got on them. I'll probably be back but it'll have to be for the burger and fries combo, don't think I'll be needing any yellow cheese any time soon. As another Yelper says, this place is tiny. They have about 5-10 barstools and that's about it. So when it gets busy don't expect to sit down for a meal.

That being said, it was important for me to find a place that offered it the way it should be. Although it's the only dog I had while out here, my take on it was it's the goodness of a true Chicago dog w/out all the fluff and stuff. No radioactive green relish. No overbearing huge hot dog. No poppyseed bun. Just your good ol' vienna beef dog, pickle, sport peppers, tomato, onion, mustard and celery salt. The hot dog had a great snap with each bite and the blend of flavors from all the toppings mesh together perfectly with a nice tang. Seriously, no ketchup is needed because that sweetness would destroy that savory and tangy flavor. A tiny gripe is that the buns are steamed so they do fall flat after holding your dog for a while and make things a little messy. The hot dog itself may look small, but trust me, it is just right.

We stumbled across Max's and America's Dog (across the street) as we walked to the CTA. America's Dog had that fast food chain feel, as Max's seemed to be the better choice; a hole-in-the-wall, which most tasty food comes from anyway. They didn't have the radioactive green relish we asked for, though the guy told us it was just ""color."" Got our hot dogs and had piping hot fries in a tiny paper bag. The vienna had a nice crunch! Not rubbery and disgusting like other hot dogs. The dog paired with the sport peppers, tomatoes, relish, celery (opted out of the pickle) was an awesome combination!

At first it was the hotdogs. I was on a mission to find the best hotdog in the loop. As we all know, it's kind of hard to mess that up. Perhaps it was the fries that kept me coming back though. It wasn't until I tried their cheeseburger special that I knew something great was going on here. It's difficult to describe. I mean, the place is kind of a hole in the wall, but the burger's are just fantastic. The kaiser roll is fresh and soft, they don't really put anything unique on it. I think that things like this only occur when something has been done the same way for a long time. I asked the cook one time what it was that made their burgers so good and he just told me ""we use good meat."" I guess that must be it.

2009-08-14,5.0,I have been in Chicago since January and understood what all the hype was about Chicago Dogs. Then i have been on a mission to find the best dog in town. Well so far I would have to say this this is up there. If you are not looking for Max's you may miss it. It is a little ducked in shop right off the street. But those are usually the places that serve the best! For me... Max's is right around the corner from work. And you can get a delicious hot dog in about 2 seconds. i will reserve my judgement to see if it is the best in town because I am still new here. But if there are dogs better than these... Im going to need to give other places more than 5 Stars! Anyone have any suggestions on other dog shops... message me! I'll investigate!,0.9715,0.847,0.143,0.01,0.5183982683982683

2009-04-16,3.0,"Despite working within spitting distance of Max's for 3+ years, I've never been here before. The look of the place scared me away. But after reading good reviews on here, I decided it was a good choice for the second stop of my April Fresh tour. So I gave it a shot! I like being able to order online, and Max's allows you to do so. The web site was responsive and easy to use. I completed my order in minimal time, and saved 10% since this was my first online order. I also earned 6 loyalty points. And only $6 for a meal...so far, so good! But when I arrived at the restaurant a bit under 10 minutes later, not only was my order not ready*, they hadn't even noticed it yet. They didn't look it up on their screen until I got there and said I was there for an Internet order. Oh well, they started on it right away and I settled in to wait. Luckily I didn't have to wait too long. They were fairly quick. I got my food and drink and left. I got back and hungrily freed the food from its brown paper confines. Hmm, what's this? I ordered cheddar cheese. Either they got my order wrong and gave me American or their ""cheddar cheese"" is processed into oblivion just like American. Either way, not a fan. But I dug in anyway. At least there was no mayo... that would have been a deal breaker. The fries were pretty good, but I recommend eating them fast. They lose their luster quickly when they cool down. Cheese problem aside, the cheeseburger itself was all right. It really wasn't anything to write home about. The people working there were nice, but the place is a real dive inside. I don't care that much about the look of a place if the food and service is good... but all in all Max's did not live up to my expectations. This place is so close, I'll probably give them another chance. Everyone is allowed an off day every now and then. It will probably be awhile before I get back there however, as I don't eat that kind of food very often. *Amendment: Lest I be thought of as unreasonable, I'd like to clarify that I didn't expect the order to necessarily be ready when I arrived, but I thought that they'd at least be aware of it.
