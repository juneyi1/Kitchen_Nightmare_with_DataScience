2017-08-22,2.0,"Looking for a margarita, I figured De Cero had to be the place to give me the fixing I needed. They had a good amount of different flavors of margarita, so I tried their Citrus one. 20 minutes later, I get a very watered down poor man's version of a margarita. Not much of an tequila taste to it and hardly any citrus taste to it. I was a little disappointed. I would've understood if the restaurant was a little more packed and that they forgot my drink, but that was not the case. It already took 10 minutes for the server to take my order. A waste of time, this place was. And for $10.75, the little mason jar of watered down cocktails is not worth it at all.",-0.7804,0.905,0.016,0.079,0.3918402777777778
2017-08-20,5.0,"We didn't have much time to stop and eat in Chicago before an afternoon in South Bend.  My boyfriend told us about Randolph Street and the great restaurant scene so we decided to check it out.  We went around 1-2 PM on a Friday. Upon walking in, the place looks very home-y and shabby-chic.  We went during the day, but I think in the evening, it could be a romantic place for a date. At De Cero, we were seated quickly.  I ordered an mint lemonade because I was driving, and my two friends ordered alcoholic drinks.  As a table we shared the mango ceviche.  I don't typically like ceviche, but my friends had me out numbered.  Right away though, we were all impressed.  The taste of the ceviche was so bright and flavorful.  The mango and pomegranate seeds were such a pleasant compliment to the fish.  I even ended up being the one who took the last bite! AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE CEVICHE! Now for the main course.  We each had different tacos, but they were all delicious. I had the Al Pastor and the portobello tacos.  My boyfriend is from San Antonio and knows his tacos, and even he was impressed with his trio of Al Pastor tacos (his favorite).   I thought De Cero was great, especially since we didn't have a long wait to be seated.",0.9953,0.772,0.212,0.016,0.6286848072562359

This is Mexican food that you won't be worried if you're going to have food poisoning after or not. This is safe Mexican food. Ok rant over. My husband has been telling me about this place for months. We finally came here and brought our friends from out of town. It was a HOT day. I'm talking 100 with humidity and we walked all the way from Navy Pier. We were immediately given waters and asked if we wanted margaritas. We all got the house margarita which can be risky, BUT the house margarita was excellent. It was not super sweet it was just right! It really helped cook us off. We ordered chips and salsa. The salsas were EXCELLENT they tasted very fresh. We had the pineapple habanero salsa, tomatillo line and pico de gallo.  We decided to do the taco share platter you get 8 tacos but you order in pairs. This is the one thing I forgot to take a picture of which I'm sad about because they were excellent l. We had 4 Al Pastor tacos, carnitas and steak. The Al Pastor and Steak tacos were a big hit. The carnitas were good but the others were better. We were so full, but there were so many other things that sounded excellent as well.  Our waitress found out we were walking back to Navy Pier and made sure we had water to go, which I thought was super nice and kind as it was very very hot.  Can't wait to go back!

Like De Cero should be embarrassed to serve such tiny cocktails for the price they charge. I was terribly disappointed in the Mexican Koolaid - not the taste because it was delicious but it was so small, I only had 3-4 sips of it and it was gone.

I was told by the event coordinator to order a certain amount of platters to feed that many people, but on initial thought I believed that was too much food. However, the event coordinator told me that this was the perfect amount. On the date of the event though, we had SO many leftover platters- it was disgusting. I felt like I was wasting so much food and that we were unfairly misled to order (and pay) for so much more food than we needed. The event coordinator simply ignored my concerns, however, and was never to be heard from again... As for the actual food, it was decent, but with my terrible experience- the flavor was lost in the memory. We tried the steak, chicken, pork, raja peppers, and mushroom tacos. all the meat tacos were better than the vegetarian ones. Two-Three tacos is definitely enough to feed one.

Next, the cost:value ratio is way off. You pay a lot either for not enough or bad quality. Example of the former, you pay $8 for maybe two spoonfuls of guacamole. $8!!! For that much I should be getting two tacos for free. Example of the latter, their tacos were made by some idiot who thought he had a sense for flavors. I don't want a Ruby Tuesday meal converted into a taco.  Salmon asparagus taco? The salmon was heavily peppered and salted to the point where you couldn't make out any other ingredients. Their shrimp taco is basically overly breaded popcorn shrimp with a huge slice of avocado. Where is the thoughtfulness in that? That taco alone dehydrated my salivary glands to the point where I couldn't even taste the next taco. Don't get me started on the vegetarian tacos.  All around the tacos had mismatched textures, uncoordinated flavor pallets, uncreative ingredient combinations, and to top it all off they cost way more than they were even worth.

I started with the strawberry mojito which was delicious but strong enough that you can taste the alcohol. We ordered 2 guacamoles, the verde salsa, and the warm chipotle salsa. The guacamole is the best I've ever had. Verde salsa was also great. Skip the chipotle - it tasted like pasta sauce to me.  All of the tacos were great with a surprising kick of spice. I ordered the steak, whitefish, and cheese. Do not sleep on the cheese taco - it was my favorite of the night. Yes, it's technically a quesadilla, but it's delicious and I could have eaten 10 of them! Dessert was just a bite - which was perfect - but the menu should reflect that.

2017-02-03,1.0,"So let me start by saying that the restaurant itself is wonderful and the food is fantastic. This one-star rating is actually with regards to their catering company - The Happy Point. DO NOT EVER WORK WITH THEM! Angela Lee, the catering manager, was horrible to work with. My fiance and I were trying to set up a rehearsal dinner at de cero, and were working through Angela. She was consistently rude and condescending. We had explained from the very beginning that we wanted to do tacos at de cero and that because this was a rehearsal dinner, we wanted some privacy to do toasts and speeches. She suggested we rent a private room above Grange Hall, that we could do tacos there and we'd have the privacy we needed. After a ton of back and forth and finally deciding to move forward with everything, Angela told us the saloon was no longer available because we couldn't do tacos there and we should use de cero instead. When we explained that we had wanted privacy and this was the reason the saloon had been an option, she told us it was either de cero with no privacy or the saloon with no tacos. She made it seem as though we were super demanding about everything, when in fact it was she who offered this up as an option to begin with! So we decided to take our business elsewhere. But what a terrible experience. If anyone wants to use de cero for cartering purposes, I recommend either calling the restaurant manager directly or going elsewhere.",0.4374,0.872,0.062,0.066,0.5588541666666667

We ordered the spicy goat cheese open face tamale, Alambres burrito, the tres queso taco and black bean.  All were delicious and seasoned well. One last thing:  you must have the margaritas!!

The mahi ceviche was absolutely terrible- it's just basically weird shreds of fish soaked in lemon juice with some garnish. The taquitos were no better than frozen ones you'd buy at the store and pop in the oven. The soup tasted like water with lemon juice and chicken. And the slider was just mediocre and came out cold. I think at one point the cheese on the slider was supposed to be melted- but instead it was just hard and cold.  I also ordered the special clementine margarita and that basically just tasted like tequila with lime juice and some brown sugar on the rim of the cup.

They have always been gluten friendly and had plenty of GF options for those of us with autoimmune conditions, since someone in the owner's family reportedly has Celiac. Always raved about this place for years to everyone, but after not coming for a couple months, they've made some changes to the menu items with no disclosure. We always order a platter of tacos, which ALWAYS came on corn tortilla, unless someone asked for flour. All of our varieties of tacos between the four of us, (two platters full), were on corn, except for the chorizo. They were on flour, and between the awful lighting in the evening, and my tastebuds being distracted by the yummy spices of the al pastor and others, I didn't notice the shell was different nor could I taste a difference. My boyfriend noticed I just ate a bite of it before I did. Within a half hour, my stomach started turning and I had to ""mind over matter"" it for the rest of the night until we returned to our hotel. Not fun with an autoimmune condition!!! The menu noted no changes or specified per individual option of taco choices that any of them automatically came on flour! Even after years of trusting their GF excellence, it just shows you have to be thorough every time, because you can get contaminated and very sick over one slip. I get sick to my stomach and am uneasy for days after, as well as my body sending out an inflammatory response which triggers my immune system to attack for weeks or months.

2016-03-21,1.0,"It is so unfortunate that I have to give De Cero only a 1-star rating.  The food is more along 4-stars, however the service received from the manager/host, Carlos, warrants this low rating.  Upon 20 minutes early arrival for my reservation, my designated table was pointed out and we were assured by the host Carlos that since the party currently sat at that table had finished their meal and only had drinks left it would be 15-25 minutes for us. That's fine. The 7 of us were designated to be stuffed in the corner of the bar area where we were essentially hovering over two other tables that were trying to enjoy their meals. 30 minutes pass and I check in with Carlos. It's now 8:15 and I'm trying to get a read on our situation. He kind of blows me off and says it shouldn't be long. Another 10, 15, 20 minutes go by and we are starting to get very unnerved. I get it that sometimes tables sit for an unexpectedly long time after finishing their meal. That's fine. It then becomes the responsibility of the restaurant to determine how to overcome the unexpected hiccup and figure out what plan B is for the waiting reservations.  Carlos had no plan B.  What's worse is that we were called to be seated twice on false alarms. We all gathered our drinks and belongs and filed out of the bar area only to find out that the tables weren't in fact ready.  I kept being told by Carlos that we would be ""taken care of"" in a very condescending manner.  About an hour and 25 minutes after our reservation time, we were finally sat. There were two orders of chips, salsa and guacamole waiting for us at the table. We guessed that's how Carlos determined he would ""take care"" of us.  The waitress from the bar was patient and kind enough to split everyone's tab however she informed one of the girls in our group had her drinks already paid for. My friend insisted that must be a mistake, but the waitress said she didn't owe any money so we proceeded to order from our waiter at the table, Sam.  Sam was great. Sam was apologetic and speedy to get us our food and drinks since he knew we had been waiting. Half way into the meal the same waitress from the bar comes back to the table during the meal and tells my friend that her drinks in fact were not paid for and that she needed to close out that tab NOW during the meal. The waitress stood there with her hand out until my friend dug out her credit card. The whole experience was just rude and embarrassing for my friend. She paid. We come to the end of the meal and are absolutely flabbergasted to see that the appetizers that were waiting for us - ones that we did not order - are charged on the bill. We ask to speak to Carlos and are essentially told that he doesn't want to come over to speak with us. At this point we have been there so long that we have seen a 20 top table sit down, eat, and leave before us. It's been a long night and we just want to get out of there so we are prepared to just pay and leave.  After another 15 minutes of waiting at the table Carlos finally comes over and tries to make excuses for everything, all the while not being the slightest apologetic for our inconvenienced evening. In the end he took $30 off the $200 bill. Not really worth it. The ambience is adorable, the enchiladas were some of the best I've had in a while, and our waiter Samuel was great, but the service from management is what will prevent me from returning!",0.9935,0.861,0.1,0.039,0.5234567901234567

2016-03-09,3.0,"I've now been here twice - and ""A-OK"" describes it perfectly. The first time we came here, it was nearly closing time on a Saturday night. Long story short - we had a hard time hailing a cab (it was right at the start of the Uber days and we hadn't quite figured it out yet!), so we showed up super late. It was several years ago, but what I do remember was that the server rushed us a bit (not surprisingly) and we had a very limited menu to choose from.  That said - a review on my most recent experience is where I'll put forth the effort. I was there for business, with two other people. It was a very warm day in March, so we decided to eat outside. Thankfully it was beautiful, because the service was so slow and sparse, that we had LOTS of time to enjoy the scenery! I have to wonder if we gave off some type of vibe...because there was another table that sat, ordered, paid and left well before we even received our check. Food: Guacamole! Venture out and try something different. Guac with basil has never been a pairing I'd dreamt about, but it was FANTASTIC. Salsas are great and you get served a large portion. I also ordered the goat cheese tamale (SO good), and two tacos - shrimp (ok) and ground beef (not worth taking a second bite). Our sides of rice and beans were nothing special at all. Drink: We didn't have any booze, but the cucumber lemonade is worth me telling you to ORDER IT! But only if you can't have booze. If you can have booze, you should definitely be ordering that. Service: So horrible. Enough so that I don't know if I'd return. We had to ask multiple times to get more chips and water (things, in my opinion, that should be refilled immediately - not requested) - and we waited for ever. For three small meals, it took us well over 90 minutes to dine and leave.  It's a cute place and clearly a good location, but I'd steer clear for lunch if you're on a tight timeline.",0.9941,0.812,0.155,0.034,0.4770748299319727

We ordered the 8 taco platter to share amongst three people and chips/guac. I don't remember exactly which guac we ordered, but, evidently, I didn't find it noteworthy. We had the shrimp, catfish, chicken chipotle, and cheese tacos. The platter comes with two of each.  I really enjoyed the shrimp and cheese, and my friends said the catfish was great as well. None of us were crazy about the chicken. I also liked the tortillas they use, and I believe it said on the menu that they make them in house. The only reason I'm not giving this place 4 stars is because the prices are a little steep! It's fairly economical if you do the platter, but $5 for one fish taco seems like a lot...

2016-01-16,3.0,"Can someone save us from yet another mediocre Tex-Mex restaurant in Chicago?  With 20 options under the ""Hello Tacos"" section on the menu, it might be safe to say that De Cero  wants to think of itself as an upscale ""taqueria"".   The tortillas are freshly made. However, after living in Mexico, how often is a taco with 3-4 ounces of filling served on only one tortilla?   Typically, tacos are composed of two thin tortillas so that the filling & juices don't soak through.   We sampled  duck confit, battered catfish, sage fried chicken, and skirt steak tacos.   While I know better than to order duck confit in a Tex-Mex restaurant, it was a cold winter night, enough said?   What came (on a single tortilla) was about 3 ounces of flavorless pulled & chopped duck.  It didn't have even the slightest twinge of cloves, nutmeg, ginger  or cinnamon usually found in most  confit.   The potion was ample enough, but it soaked through the thin tortilla it was packed on, and ended up on my jeans!   The skirt steak taco had decent flavor, but was almost impossible to chew.  Had it been sliced on the bias and chopped finer, perhaps it would have been OK.  Instead, it was stringy and difficult to enjoy.  Sage fried chicken had nice sage flavor, but the breast tender was overcooked and dry.  The catfish taco was the best of the 4 we tried.  It was tender, and the accompanying slaw was crispy.  I also tried the Chicken Barbacoa.  Even though chicken is not typically cooked ""barbacoa"" style , in the Yucatan, they prepare ""pollo pibil"" (chicken wrapped in banana leaves with spices.  I was kind of hoping  the dish would be like that.  Instead, it tasted like it was only lightly rubbed with some spices , and steamed/brasied.  At least there were 2 legs and a thigh, so I pretended it was steamed chicken, garnished it with onions & cilantro & rolled it in a tortillas.  The two best food items we tried at DeCero were the ""Bacon Pinto Beans ( also called charro beans in Tex-Mex cuisine) and the open faced Chicken Mole Tamale.

We started with the pico de gallo and the warm chipotle salsas. They give you a ton of chips so I recommend this as a starter for 2-4 people. They had lots of other good sounding starters too, including nachos and sliders. I ordered a spicy jalapeno pineapple margarita which was quite good. I'm not sure how much I tasted either flavor in particular but it definitely had some zing to it. For dinner my friend and I got the taco platter, where you can order 4 sets of 2 tacos and save a couple bucks compared to ordering them all individually. We did the skirt steak, sage fried chicken, chorizo and tres queso. All of them were really good! Quality-wise I put them on par with Taco Joint and Big Star. They are $4 a pop instead of $3 though.

The pastor meat was just OK but the red onion was chopped so coarsely that it was overwhelming. The Duck Confit tacos were absolutely flavorless.

This was the perfect place for a stop in, and I am sure it would be great for an entire dinner as well. It is loud and thumping in the space and I can understand why. The margaritas are strong and DELICIOUS! I had them make me an off the menu margarita with coconut and it was exactly what I had in mind, could have had six of them. However an apple cider margarita caught my eye. Who knew they could work such spicy autumn magic with tequila, but it was delicious and sweet and strong and it absolutely worked. All of my friends enjoyed their drinks as well.  For food we ordered a trio of salsas and a few tacos. I can't speak for my friends with their tacos but I really liked my Al Pastor, not the best I had ever had but hit the spot for mexican. The taco choices are far and wide with a lot of great flavors, I wish I could have had 3 (or 7) different options. The salsa trumped the tacos though, the flavors were AWESOME. We did a warm chipotle, a mango habanero, and a salsa verde. The warm chipotle was a nice option but we were all digging hard into that mango habanera, it was sooo spicy we were all blowing our noses but still going in for more because the flavor was so spot on. The verde too was extremely fresh and when I would dig in I felt like I was outside in a garden eating straight off the plant or something, absolutely delicious.

Everyone was raving over the duck nachos so we got two orders for the table. This is so over-priced. Literally 4 chips per order, that's $2.50 per tortilla chip. With all the toppings that put on it, I thought it was pretty bland. I can make way better nachos at home, I don't recommend this dish. All the couples got a platter of 8 tacos to share between each other. Four tacos per person was a little bit too much, but the price wasn't bad. Most people couldn't finish their fourth taco.

Service seemed a bit slow at first because the table next to us was pitching a fit.  Our service ended up great though.   Guacamole is definitely recommended.  I am usually not a fan of mango salsa but this is an exception.  We also had the mango habanero margaritas and they were fantastic.  Taco wise I'd recommend the sautéed shrimp and the steak.  I will go back for sure!,0.9734,0.758,0.229,0.013,0.47420634920634924

The best part of this restaurant is the chips and salsa (for a small cost of course), which is not saying much.  The guacamole was solid but for the cost we were expecting there to be twice the amount served, so overall it was below average due to the cost. The most frustrating part of this restaurant is that they charge different prices then what is listed on the menu then blame this on the cost to plate or box (if getting to-go) the food.  Be careful when ordering a $3.75 taco they are actually charging $4.00, the same goes for sides and other dishes.  They mention a $0.25 surcharge per item for delivery orders but also seem to charge that if picking up or even eating in. In the end, I would rather go to a place that is honest about what they are charging and somewhere where what they are charging is actually worth it.  We will not return here and suggest you avoid it as well.",0.8823,0.854,0.092,0.054,0.4231481481481481

2014-10-19,2.0,"Do you want expensive Mexican street food in a trendy neighborhood? De Cero Taqueria is your answer. We spent $40 (before tip) there and this is what we got: - One teeny tiny Skirt Steak taco (see picture) that wasn't that good. There was only one tortilla layer and the chipotle mayo sauce overpowered everything. I didn't like it and was confused why the server claimed that it was the best taco on the menu. - Chips with two kinds of salsa and guacamole. The two kinds of salsa (supposedly one mild and one spicy) were both spicy and also had hints of fruit that kept us dipping again and again. We would have liked it if the server explained that we had to pay for each of the salsas. - One Mango con Chile margarita that was yummy. The mango flavor was strong and fresh. It wasn't spicy at all. - One beans and rice. The beans were whole and mixed with bacon bits. The rice was white. (See picture). - One horchata to go (probably about 8 oz). It was creamy, sweet, and had noticeable cinnamon. It hit the spot on our drive home. I was especially irritated that we paid so much for so little. Most Mexican restaurants will GIVE you chips and salsa. They will also GIVE you rice and beans on the side of any meal. I understand that this is a convenient and casual restaurant in a high-rent neighborhood. I suppose it would have been less irritating if the server hadn't OFFERED us chips and salsa and then surprised us by charging us for them.",0.8684,0.864,0.085,0.051,0.517948717948718

I am not much of a drinker, but I needed to unwind from a stressful day.  Plus I was sitting at the bar, so I decided to have a Cucumber with Chile Salt Margarita.   It was very flavorful, and the chili salt brought out  a unique favor from the drink. They certainly didn't skim on the alcohol either, so one was more than enough to relax me.   I should add that service from the two bartenders on duty was prompt and friendly.  de cero is a taqueria (taco shop) and specializes in gourmet tacos.  I wasn't in a taco mood,  so I ordered the Enchiladas Tres Queso or three cheese enchiladas entrée.    The enchiladas were delicious and arrived in a timely fashion.  The chicken was tasty and tender.  The cheeses were rich.  The  black beans side perfectly complimented the enchiladas.  I also enjoyed the atmosphere at de cero.  The modern Latino music playing was cool and quite different from the music that is typical in the Mexican restaurants I have been in. I also liked that is wasn't blasting.   I could talk without yelling.   The slideshow on the screen behind the bar also had an interesting array of images.  Additionally, the lighting was warm and welcoming.  It was neither too bright or dark like in some restaurants.  Last but not least, my tab for dinner and drinks was reasonable for the area.

Server was quick to come over and take our drink and appetizer orders.  Interesting selection of margaritas, but unfortunately they were very weak. I tried the pineapple jalepeño and the cucumber ones. Both good, just wanted something stronger after the long week at work though. Margaritas were $9.75 for any flavor and could be upgraded with better tequila for a small additional cost.  We got a trio of salsas and two guacamoles for the table. The tomatillo verde salsa was my favorite, closely followed by the warm chipotle.  Then I split a taco platter of the bourbon braised beef, citrus carnitas, al pastor, and duck confit tacos.

Carnivores: -The most delicious taco you'll ever consume is the steak taco, and a close second is the battered shrimp taco.  Your face will melt after the mouth orgasm you'll immediately convulse into the moment this dish hits yo' tongue, honey!   Vegans/vegetarians: -The black bean tacos are cruelty free, and so delicious that you don't miss the meat and cheese dishes for a second!  You can go with your meat eating friends and your eco friends alike...and everyone leaves fat & happy!  : Carnivores and Vegans:  -For an appetizer, make sure to get the black beans and rice, coupled with the lime verde sauce on the size.  A tortilla chip with a mound of black beans, rice, then drizzled verde sauce on the top: OH HOLY LORD!!  Healthy and delicious! -The guac is always fresh, and so good! -DO NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE without getting one of their made-by-God's-own-hands COCONUT MOJITOS!   Great service, love the laid back (yet classy) atmosphere, and love the personalized service I've gotten there since I moved to this beautiful city.   Thanks, Sam -- you always treat my guests and I like kings and queens.  See you next week...as uuuuuusual!  :)",0.9975,0.741,0.221,0.038,0.53274231678487

There has been the typical slow service day and a waiter forgetting an item but these things happen from time to time anywhere you go.  The food is excellent. We have tried just about every taco on the menu and they are delicious. I don't really have a favorite, I like to mix and match. Duck confit, tres queso, Al Pastor, skirt steak, you pretty much can't go wrong.  We have also tried both the Chicken enchilada and cheese enchilada. We both highly recommend the cheese without question. So much more flavorful, I think the chicken brings it down (still good though) but if you want flavor, go with the cheese enchilada.  Staff - has been excellent. Very attentive minus the one time but it happens no matter where you go. And for the West Loop good service is impossible to find. Most places at least around the presidential towers area has given us bad service numerous times even when they are dead.  Definitely check this place out, especially if you live in the neighborhood. Also my wife loves micheladas and this place makes her favorite out of all the places in Chicago we have been. Important: the Al Pastor taco is their hot item.

The dishes were also never cleared at the end of the meal and we stayed for an extra round of cocktails so we had dirty plates sitting in front of us for a good half hour. The food itself was mediocre at best. The meat inside the tacos was not of very good quality and it was noticeable by both the flavor and consistency. Everyone at the table was disappointed with their taco order. I've had better at pretty much every other place I've been that serves tacos. The drinks were at least good. I guess its a good sign our glasses were empty but it took a long time to get anyone's attention in between drinks. Sorry De Cero.

I was so excited to try it.  I ordered a cucumber margarita with chili salt to start with.  It was really really good! Not too much sweet, which I HATE about most margaritas, and you could tell that it was all very fresh (probably not using big tubs of sugar water to make them).  Then it was time to order food.  I ordered both of the strictly vegan tacos which were the avocado and the black bean.  The black bean taco was so good, I could eat that every day, multiple times a day.  The avocado taco was also good, but would have liked the black beans on it... or taking the jalapeno from the avocado and put it on the black bean, but I appreciate that they try to mix it up with multiple options for veggies like me.  Usually my eyes are bigger than my stomach, but this time we ordered small so we didn't get to try everything.  My date also had tacos and he liked the pork with pineapple I remember his saying.  I definitely want to go back, and try the guac and more RITAS!!  I will say though, this place would really benefit in hiring a better server.  I think his name was miguel or marco.  He was pretty rude and we saw him for about 30 seconds.  If someone can convey rude in that short amount of time it is pretty telling.  I read other's reviews and it seems like there is a lot of complaints about the service.

2013-10-23,1.0,"De Cero had become our go-to Mexican spot in the West Loop.  Typically, we would go in for dinner on a semi-frequent basis (once a month).  The food was consistently solid and we really enjoy the taco platter and the variety of tacos they offer even if it is a bit expensive.  The service was inconsistent and sometimes extremely slow or even bad.  Occasionally, the service issues would be enough for us to take a ""break.""  This time the break-up is for real.  We tried their lunch service on the weekends twice now.  It was dreadful.  The first time we went in August it was very hot in the restaurant and there was a wait for no reason.  It was about 15 minutes before anyone came by to take care of us and even took care of a couple seated after us first.  We were very close to walking out when we were helped.  We explained that we would come in for dinner, order the taco platter with the salsas and wanted to do the same for lunch.  The waitress assured us that was no problem. Tacos came out and were tasty as usual.  However, the salsas that came with it were not the small sides that normally accompany the dinner, but the size of the appetizer version.  We were slightly puzzled by the appetizer-sized version of salsas that accompanied the tacos instead of the small sides that comes with the platter meal. Puzzled became angry and annoyed when we got the bill.  We were charged for three full salsas with our meal.  Our waitress never mentioned anything about a charge, etc.   Although annoyed, it wasn't a write-off situation yet.  We decided to give lunch service another try this past weekend thinking that perhaps it was just an off day.  However, our experience this past weekend was the same.  The dining room was about half full.  We were seated promptly albeit the host was not very friendly.  We waited. And waited.  And waited some more.  At ten minutes, no one had come by to greet us or take our order.  Learning from our past lunch experience, we got up and left.  Our experience with their track record of mediocre service reminds me of the adage: ""Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.""  We're done being fooled De Cero.",-0.9905,0.848,0.029,0.123,0.42711894586894594

2013-08-14,2.0,"Placed an order for workplace lunch through  seamless.com  at 10:30 am, scheduled at noon. Never received a confirmation so I called at 11:30 to make sure it went through. I was told it wasn't received, and they offered to take the order, but it was pretty large and I knew it wouldn't get there by noon, so I said no. As soon as I hung up, I got the confirmation email (to be fair, this might have been troubles with Seamless, not de cero). So I called back again to double double check whether it was received or not, and was told the order HAD been received, and would definitely be there at noon. Well, it arrived at 12:15 and was missing a tamale and an iced tea. I called again and was told they forgot a bag, and could bring it but it would take a few minutes to get there. The place is like 2 or 3 blocks from my work, and it took an hour to get here. To their credit, I assume they figured out that it hadn't been the most stellar experience for us, so they sent over 2 tamales, 2 iced teas, a big bag of chips, guac, and 3 different kinds of salsa. So I can forgive a few operational troubles.  Most importantly, the food was good. I had the spicy aplewood bacon chorizo taco which was AMAZING, the duck confit which I personally felt was a little dry, and the goat cheese tamale, which was really good but I didn't get much goat cheese flavor. The chips were also good, and several of us commented that we don't really like salsa verde but theirs was tasty. All in all I've had better tacos, but I've also definitely had worse.  Oh I almost forgot, the order was for 6 people who had 3 tacos each, and they did a great job of packaging them separately and writing our names on them according to our request. BUT it's complete BS that they charge .25 PER TACO for a delivery container fee. As if they weren't expensive enough. 9/6/13 update: I just...I just can't bring myself to really like this place. After ordering here a second time I'm dropping down a star.  Same deal, ordered a work lunch through  seamless.com  40 minutes go by so I called them to confirm whether it was received, and after being on hold for too long they tell me they just received it and sent out the confirmation email. Yeah right you just received it; they apparently just don't check online orders. Because I was proactive this time, the order did arrive on time. But they forgot someone's quesedilla, and got one of the tortas wrong. Sooooo we called back, and about 45 minutes later they sent over the food with some dessert thrown in. I mean I guess that's cool, but I would rather they just get the order right. Also this time they did NOT label the food, even though on every single item I asked them to put someone's name. I know that must be a pain for them to label each item, but hey, it's their job. Anyway, just...come on guys.",0.9933,0.815,0.134,0.051,0.4153992549400711

We started with the guacamole and it was very tasty.  It was just a small bowl of it though...so we ordered another.  Really good.  We had 3 margaritas, that were all very good but small and lot of ice.  First one went down very fast.

2013-08-08,3.0,"De Cero! You were on my bookmark list for quite some time and I'm happy I finally ventured out to the Randolph street foodie area to try you out. Were you the best Mexican I've ever had? Not by any means. But were you tasty and pretty average? I would say so. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again but I figured if someone was having a birthday or something, I would come back. The place isn't as big as I thought it would be, it has these unique Mexican culture images on the walls which are kind of neat, but we sat outside (in their little patio) since nothing is better than some margaritas and summertime in the Chi. Our server was okay, nothing special, but everything came out on time and no issues. But we did have to remind her to refill our water and bring us napkins and stuff, but it was pretty busy outside so I won't hold it against her too much.  Now onto the important stuff, the food. We didn't want to get the guacamole because it seemed pretty average and nothing unique. I like more flavor in my guacamole and some special ingredients. So we got the tomatillo verde salsa which was green and delicious. The bottomless chips, like everyone mentions, really are delicious. I could eat a whole box of those by myself. Now, the tacos for lunch are $3.50 a piece which isn't too expensive and three were enough to full me up. I ordered the Pastor Taco (pork shoulder, pineapple, cilantro, onion, a little on the spicy side, but my favorite taco that they had here). I should have just ordered all Pastor Tacos I liked it that much as the other ones just lacked the heat and spice that I like in my tacos. Then I got the duck confit, with corn salsa, kinda bland, nothing memorable. Lastly, I tried the shrimp taco which was battered with avocado and some kind of green cream. Can't compare to some of the other shrimp tacos I had in this city. So overall, De Cero, you're worth a try but I'm not dying to come back anytime soon.",0.9789,0.834,0.113,0.053,0.5090379008746355

I have the option of eating 3 other types.  I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food.. so I would probably wouldn't rate this more than a 3... just because I wasn't too fond of all their different types of salsa's.. and some of their tacos weren't that great.

Thier tacos are their speciality--all, it seems like 900 of them--and I haven't had anything on the menu that didn't bring me home to Southern California--but the carnitas taco stands atop the pyramid. It is a perfect thing. Cheap, too. When's the last time you've been offered a beet Margarita? That's what I thought. Well, I was offered one by De Cero's owner and it's life-changing. The earthy, sweet beet is perfect with any of the tequilas they stock. It's only one of the many--all great--Margaritas that they serve. I think their guacamole is the best in Chicago. Just the right amount of heat and acid. Chunky enough and perfect on their house-made chips. The Day of the Dead masks on the walls are very, very cool.

Rajas - I loved this one.  Great flavor. 3 cheese - This was all literally all cheese, but had a great flavor.

The guacamole was also good, although the small bowl that you get for $8 was weak.  I'd say this place is quite pricey overall, but the food was still really good.  One thing which I found strange was they served diet coke in can - usually you'll see that at taquerias.

When we arrived only about half of our party was there and at first the hostess, a young woman, told us that we could not be seated until the others arrived. A few more people came moments later and she seated us.  We enjoyed dinner and spent over $300 and tipped well. We cashed out the dinner bill and some of us decided to have a shot of Patron, which our server was happy to bring us. As we waited for our shots, the hostess from earlier came over to me and said she needed our table. By this time it was about 9 PM and there was NO ONE waiting for a table. The restaurant was no where near as crowded as I have seen it in previous times. Since a few people from our party had left, I thought she was asking that we condense to one end of the table they had put together to free up the others. NOPE!!! She said, 'NO! YOU HAVE TO LEAVE!!' What???? Seriously??? She said we were late for our reservation anyway and it was time for us to go. I told her we were waiting on our shots and she stood there and looked at me stone-faced. At that moment the server came out with our drinks and I said never mind we were leaving. He was so confused and the hostess just sent him back. I have NEVER EVER been so &*&%$^* insulted in my life.  We spent a lot of money, we were not disruptive and the place was not packed. That is no way to treat customers at all. Even if another party was coming in, she could have even asked if we would have liked to enjoy our drinks in the bar area instead.  Never again De Cero.",0.9425,0.815,0.108,0.076,0.43333333333333324

Once again I find myself stuck between stars but until Yelp puts in a half star option, I'm forced to round one way or the other.  This time I'm rounding up, mostly because of the passion fruit margarita.",0.9978,0.737,0.234,0.03,0.5087591947348044

Our meals came out an hour after arriving, and the food was very meh.  When I asked to speak with a manager to complain about the lack of service, the hostess informed me that she was the manager, and she acknowledged that the service was awful.  She started to pitch in here and there (i.e., ran credit cards so people didn't have to wait half an hour to settle their bills) but offered no consolation.   I'd take Mercadito or a neighborhood Mexican joint any day over De Cero. *** The manager contacted me after this review and provided a gift certificate, acknowledging that De Cero was very short-staffed due to the concert at the United Center that night.  I look forward to going again and hopefully adding a few stars to this review.",0.7937,0.872,0.075,0.053,0.39062499999999994

I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious everything was. Sure it was a little bit pricer than our usual neighborhood taco joint that we love but we wanted to try something different and this was a great option.  Chips and salsa are not complimentary. I know, I know...I, too, have come to just expect free chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants and when I don't get it I'm usually a little sad. But then I always eat way more chips than I should and get filled up before my meal comes. It's a gluttonous expectation that I'm glad isn't an option at De Cero. It makes me think about what I'm ordering before I just stuff my face. However, since this was our first time here we had to try their homemade chips and salsa. We ordered the charred habanero salsa and it was oh-so-spicy good. The mango in it made it refreshing enough so that it wasn't too spicy. Our waitress did bring us a second bowl of chips, not sure if that's the usual.  We split the Ensalada Campo Verde. If I could I would have ate nothing but the cilantro jalapeno viniagrette. It was amazing! We each got one taco (I got the Chicken Mole taco and my husband got the Tilapia taco). Both were very fresh and flavorful. The mole was smokey and the fish was crispy. Then we split the goat cheese tamale. This was the only item we ordered that I probably wouldn't order again. It sounded amazing and I love goat cheese, but I think the goat cheese looses some of its tangy flavor when it's cooked inside a tamale. All in all it was a great experience and I will definitely go back. Next time I want to try some of their cocktails!",0.9947,0.8,0.17,0.031,0.5968024227234753

It was delicious, but be warned it has a bite to it and should be eaten conservatively. We started  the trio of tamales, which consisted of the pulled pork, goat cheese and corn.  They came with a trio of condiments: crema fresca, pico de gallo and a green salsa that had the perfect amount of heat.  I absolutely loved the goat cheese and corn tamales.  They did not disappoint and the girls who tried them couldn't agree more.  From what I hear, the pulled pork was also delicious. For our main course, we ordered 2 platters of the tacos, for a total of 16 and an additional 4 since we were a large party.  These are definitely small and the average person probably needs to eat 4 tacos each.  The nice thing is that you can always order them a la carte if you want to order more or less at about $3.75 each. Our selection included the battered shrimp tacos (avocado, crema, cilantro and red onion), battered catfish (Mexican slaw and chipotle mayo), skirt steak (potato, onion, cilantro and chipotle mayo),  and avocado tacos (white onion, jalapeno, garlic, radish, cilantro).  This was the only taco that was a total snooze fest.  I had to jazz it up with the spicy green salsa that accompanied the tamales.  The restaurant started to get busy towards the end of our dinner but we appreciated not being rushed out.  Our waitress was really wonderful and she let us take all the time we needed both before and after our meal.  It's that type of service that really completes the dining experience.

Friends and I got to sample quite a few tacos, such as pulled pork, veggie, duck taco etc. ALL of them did not let me down!!

2012-03-31,1.0,"Oh my... Where to start? Well, let's start with the lack of a hostess, which left me and my girlfriend scanning the restaurant haplessly for several minutes until someone finally decided to seat us. I observed during our meal that this same phenomenon led to several groups of people walking in, hanging out for a few minutes, then finally giving up and leaving. As it turns out, they were the lucky ones.  Now on to the food. We settled on the 30 buck sampler of 8 tacos. My girlfriend played it safe, going with the tres queso and fried tilapia selections. I decided to mix it up. I looked over the menu and, wait... Duck confit? The classic French dish? Mixed with corn salsa and rolled in a corn tortilla? Oh, I had to give this train wreck a shot. To top off our four selections, I picked the chefs special, a braised beef taco with pickled red onions.  The tres queso tacos were as expected. Hard to screw up three cheeses in a tortilla, after all. The braised beef was bland and dry. Without the pickled red onion it would not have had enough moisture or flavor to be considered palatable. The tilapia ended up being the highlight of the meal... or at least the only item I might consider ordering again if someone forced me to eat here at gunpoint.  Oh, right, the duck confit! Of course! Whoever came up with this should be beaten to death by respectable chefs. Who the hell would put duck confit in a taco? Duck confit is meant to be a succulent, rich, culinary delight. But this abomination fell flat. And it gets worse - I ended up finding a rather large duck(?) bone in the taco. Which on one hand, was sort of relieving, because I knew they weren't serving me canned chicken and just calling it duck confit. When I asked the waitress if the duck confit tacos were traditionally served ""on the bone"", she laughed it off and apologized halfheartedly. She didn't comp a single thing on our bill, either, which would have been a nice gesture.  Let me give you some advice. If you're planning to go here - run. Run far away, and preferably southward, until you get to Pilsen where a place that markets itself as a ""modern-day taqueria"" would be laughed out of business. Duck f'ing confit?

2012-03-05,1.0,"De Cero should have been named De Zero. Talk about disappointing. 1. We had initially planned this as one of our Restaurant Week stops and even after noting it in the reservation, we weren't given a RW prix fixe menu. Not a big deal - why not just ask for one, right? Well, after reviewing the ""regular"" menu, the RW deal was almost more expensive than ordering a la carte. 2. Horchata - not a fan. I guess it was more ""authentic"" than what we have been grown accustomed to since you could taste and feel the grainy rice and didn't have the sweet syrup, but it was just not good. Stick to some other drinks on the menu or just order water. 3. Guacamole - probably the blandest guacamole I've ever tasted. On the menu it said it had jalapeno, garlic and onion among other ingredients but all I could taste was the avocado. The chips were excellent though. 4. Eats - I ordered a pulled pork tamal and two tacos - chorizo sausage & carne molida. The masa of the tamal was good, but the pork was pretty dry and bland. I was hoping the tomatillo salsa it was served with would help its case, but that tasted like raw tomatillos - bitter, with no spice or flavor at all. The tacos were a little better - the chorizo sausage taco was a tad too cold and greasy for my liking. My favorite was the carne molida taco - good portion of ground beef with some tasty chipotle seasoning. The side of white rice was huge. 5. For dessert, I ordered the pastel de chocolate - flourless cake with vanilla whipped cream. It is difficult for me to find something wrong with dessert but this was a tiny portion and extremely soggy. It tasted like I was eating warm chocolate pudding. Overall, underwhelmed with this place. After seeing a lot of positive reviews, I wonder if we caught them on an off day? I don't know. I do like the concept of offering unique tacos other than your standard carne asada, but the execution was off.  The one star is for the really great server we had that was very attentive and friendly, as well as for the neat atmosphere that made it seem like we were inside a cozy log cabin in the Market District.",0.9929,0.772,0.16,0.068,0.5921454561698464

We had a reservation.  Two of us arrived early and sat at the bar because they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived.  While we waited, we made a dent in our first pitcher of rita, we went with the Pineapple Jalapeno.  When that pitcher was nearing empty we order round two, Mango Chile.  Both rita's were really awesome, the Pineapple Jalapeno was a little more traditional and the Mango Chile was a little sweeter and thicker.  Tasted like it was made with mango nectar.  The Mango Chile was my personal favorite. Taco's are served ala carte, and the four of us were all thinking tacos so we went with the taco platter.  It's 8 tacos ordered in twos, so you end up with 4 different tacos.  We ordered the Big Eye Tuna, Battered Catfish, Duck Confit and Carne Molida.  I had the Tuna and Catfish.  The tuna was served with a mango & habanero salsa and wasn't as good as I had hoped.  All the flavor was packed into the salsa and the tuna itself was pretty plain.  However, the catfish taco was awesome.  Crispy battered fish topped with Mexican slaw and a spicy chipotle mayo, wowza...I could have eaten a platter of those.  Flavor was everywhere in that little taco. I'm usually not one to order dessert, but I'll eat it if it's there.  The Mexican cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake were ordered for the table.  The cheesecake was a serious king-sized slab of cake, enough for 4.  Of course I'm digging into both, the first bite of each was beyond good.  The flourless chocolate cake was smooth, rich and light, like a chocolate mousse.  While the cheesecake had a thin pie crust base, a thick layer of cheesecake that was more like a firm custard and it was topped with a flaky layer of pastry with cinnamon and topped with apples.  Hot damn, I'm drooling just thinking about it.  It was probably my favorites dessert.",0.963,0.886,0.085,0.03,0.5273809523809524

It was at that time that we realized that you could get the same stuff for cheaper a la carte. Seems like the Restaurant Week menu was a bit of a rip off? So we went ahead and ordered our stuff a la carte. The horchata was...not good. It tasted bland and grainy. The guacamole didn't taste BAD, but it was pretty much tasteless. My wife and I both agreed that it was among the worst guacamole we've tasted in Chicago. For my entree, I went with the chicken enchiladas. What arrived at my table looked like something straight out of TGI Fridays. It tasted alright, but I was wishing I had gotten the tacos instead. But my wife confirmed that the tacos weren't very good either, so I guess we were screwed either way. We ordered a desert too, but I can't even remember what it was.

So overall the food was good, but not great.  I did thoroughly enjoy the margaritas though. They are big and while pricey - you do get about two margaritas out of it. The deserts were also really tasty - especially the coconut gelato. Yum! The service was also really great, no complaints there.

Though, early reservation means it was still early enough for family dining--just a few feet away was large table filled with loud, small children and inattentive parents, just mentioning it if that's an issue for you. The duck confit nachos were excellent. Thin crispy chips with fresh melted cheese, duck, fresh pico and just a little bit creme fraiche made each portion the perfect couple of bites. The taco platter is also an excellent choice if you want to try a little bit of everything, but beware since they are all served at once, portions can become cold in the chilly dining room (the door was opening every few minutes letting in cold winter air, we were near the door) pretty quickly. I think the chicken mole taco I sampled suffered because it had cooled by the time I got to it. The cold mole was still tasty, but yeah--cold. Next time we'll just order the tacos a la carte, more tapas style, so the dishes come out in a couple of batches so we can enjoy the meal without having to beat the clock for temperature. We sampled the skirt steak, shrimp, chorizo, and chicken mole tacos. Each were excellent, fresh ingredients, the sauces and seasonings were excellent. I do not eat read meat regularly but the skirt steak was by far my favorite of them all. And while all the fresh ingredients in all the salsas make them excellent, the tamatillo verde salsa is crazy-good. Like, I want to find a lid and steal the rest in my purse kind of good. But of course I didn't, because that would be crazy. The service was excellent, attentive without hovering. Water glasses were always full. Valet parking is available, also metered street parking.

After reviewing the menu for about week before my birthday, we had already decided on the taco platter, but ultimately were underwhelmed by the final product.   Here's a rundown of what we had: - Battered Shrimp Tacos - biggest complaint here was that the tacos were drowning in the avocado crema, which overpowered the entire taco.  Battered shrimp is pretty much always yummy though.  Also, way too much cilantro.  Cilantro is such a potent flavor that, in my opinion, should be used sparingly.  Easy to put more on the side if people want that additional flavor, but ruins a meal to me when there's too much. - Bigeye Ahi Tuna Tacos - holy spicey!  i know it said there were habanero peppers in there, but this taco should have been served with a glass of milk.  It was so spicey that you couldn't even taste the fish. - Tres Quesos Tacos - these were the best of the bunch and while they were good, there was nothing great about them.  Solid choice, but frankly, it's hard to go wrong when it's just a bunch of delicious cheese in a corn tortilla. - Battered Catfish Tacos - again, way too heavy on the mayo and the slaw wasn't very good.  I tried to pick some of the mayo and slaw off and just eat the fish, which was decent. The margaritas were really good, so that was one bonus for De Cero.  Overall, just an average meal.  Probably won't come back - for the prices you can definitely find better Mexican elsewhere in the city.",0.9922,0.781,0.165,0.054,0.49337962962962956

I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to ""authenticity"" of Mexican food in America but I think it can be seen as a good thing for those yelpers who would want an honest opinion. Now on to the comida! I've only been to this spot a couple of times and it was always during lunch time, so I can't comment on entrees or other details that revolve around dinner. I have always come here with my coworkers and the food here never fails in the taste department. We always get a few taco platters along with tamales as well as the assortment of sauces they offer to be paired with chips. I'm not a salsa guy, but it was a general consensus that the sauces tasted great and that the spiciness was reminiscent of the sauces you (those of Mexican descent at least) would find at home. I do likes me some guacamole though *(please don't ever call it ""gwack,"" that makes you sound like a modern-age version of Valley girls/Spicoli). The avocado is nice and creamy, perfect for chips and good enough to eat along with your main food!  *Sauces = 3.75 stars Drinks-wise, we've always kept it lunch-appropriate. The horchata tasted really well and they have a wide variety of Jarritos sodas. The guava flavored pop goes excellent with tacos!... Like I said before, we always get the taco platters! The tacos can be a bit extravagant, with a palate that goes beyond simple taco choices like chorizo, chicken, or carne asada and instead tries to expand on an already tried and proven delicious list of options. The typical options are all there, but cooked with a different touch. My favorite are the tacos de carne al pastor (pork al pastor). The meat hints at spicy but stays subtle and it's served with onions and big chunks of pineapple! It's quite awesome. GET THIS! I also get the chipotle chicken tacos, but I would advise you to ask for it without beans. bacon-mashed pinto beans #SoundsBetterThanItIs. The beans overtake the great flavor that the chicken brings to the plate, plus it makes your tortilla soggy and then you've got yourself a mess! I'm not a mole fun, but oddly, I recognize the standard to which ""good mole"" is held so I can sincerely suggest the chicken mole tacos.  *Food/Drinks = 3.75 stars Service? Well, here they do kind of suck. One of the times, the girl was left dumbfounded after being told the breakdown of the taco platters. Another time one of the waitresses that was serving us seriously came to our table twice, the first time was to take our orders and the second to drop off the check.  *Service = 3 stars Overall, the food has always been good but the service sure could use a tune-up.

It's a Friday night and we wanted to enjoy it.  Instead we were rushed out of there in under an hour.  We literally didn't know what had happened.   Looking back, we're both glad that we got out of there so quickly because unfortunately we'll never get those 50 minutes of our lives back and we're thankful that De Dumpo didn't waste any more of our time.

We started with the spicy guacamole, which is the regular guacamole with a diced jalapeno on the top. Kind of bland, but the chips were really good. We then moved on to the duck nachos, and I they were a bit fussy as far as the presentation was concerned. Hard to eat without a fork and knife. Come on folks, they're nachos. There's no need to get fancy. Then came the tacos.  I ordered a chicken mole, battered catfish and skirt steak. The flavors were all a little dull, which wasn't helped by the fact that all of the fillings were room temperature.  $4 does not even get you a warm taco here. I did enjoy the mojitos, and my date enjoyed her margaritas. The space is cool, and service is excellent.

This was definitely prepared well- the meat itself was like a melt in your mouth cube of perfectly marinaded happiness. A good balance between buttery + chewy. The rajas was a little iffy...it was good but there was something about it that reminded me of vomit. It was acidic and creamy, maybe that's why.

I highly recommend almost everything we ate: spicy guac, shrimp & scallop ceviche, duck confit nachos (OMG, can't say enough about these!), tacos (we chose queso, poblano peppers, skirt steak and tilapia) and coconut gelato (soooooo good, had toasted coconut on top, and caramel).

Guacamole- overpriced and small serving tilapia taco- tasteless and greasy enchiladas- overpriced , didn't even get the chicken in them that we ordered so we paid for basically cheese and tortillas...which i couldve made at home.  Overall i think this place is mostly hype, people are treated like dollar signs rather than customers. i wont be going back. ..............................................................................................................

2011-02-17,3.0,"So, this review should be taken with a grain of salt because we went there on a Saturday night without a reservation. Not so smart, eh? We traipse in and realize that there is no hope of a table. We made our way to the back bar where I snagged one lonely little seat. We were hovering trying to find a pair so that we could just eat at the bar and no one was moving. The bartenders were extremely helpful; they even told us to run for some vacated (finally!) seats at the end of the bar and even held back the masses to save them for us. Too sweet; maybe it's because we looked desperately hungry. Who knows? We ordered the platter of tacos and got the black bean, tilapia, skirt steak and pork. The skirt steak and the pork were especially hot that night. The black bean was meh and the tilapia cooled down our mouths a bit. The cheladas were excellent to wash all of the down with. Then we get the bill. Eek. Man, this place is expensive. Tacos should never be this expensive!",0.9105,0.846,0.101,0.053,0.6080765639589168
2011-02-12,2.0,"Reviewing based on a recent delivery, which I most definitely don't recommend.  Their menu sounds great. I went for the Tamale Combo. They were ok. They come with 3 tiny (like 1 Tablespoon tiny) cups of sauces, one being just ordinary Pico de Gallo. Not sure which was supposed to go with which tamale. The pretty, green, opaque sauce (whatever it was) was a good idea, but it was way too watery. The bacon mashed pintos are tasty. I'm told the Carne Asada was ok, but a small portion. The Chorizo taco was good, but VERY spicy!  I splurged and spent the $7.25 for the Pastel de Chocolate dessert. The presentation was dreadful. While it's delivery and I don't expect perfection, this was an ugly brown mass jammed into a short Styrofoam cup. Came with another tiny cup of what I think was supposed to be whipped cream. It was way over-beaten and was nearly butter. The ""cake"" was dense and hard as a rock...more like fudge quite literally...yet it turned out to be quite tasty. Appeared to be made with good quality chocolate. I would like to have seen what it was ""supposed"" to look like, and it would have been nice with a slightly larger portion of properly whipped cream.  So the worst part of this experience was the delivery. It was 30 minutes later than the estimated time. That's WAY late. I called when it was 15 minutes late, and they told me he left 15 minutes earlier. Well if that's the case, we knew we were in trouble because we're not even 15 minutes from the restaurant. He called when he got here, but I saw no car outside. So either he walked, or delivered on a bicycle, which I think should be banned in winter with exception of cold food deliveries. All of the food was completely cold and needed to be heated up.  The second worst part were the prices vs. the portions. The portions were what I call ""human"" size. They were perfect. But everything is WAY WAY overpriced. The guacamole for example is $9! Insane.  Another 60-some-dollar meal delivery for two...that didn't even come close to delivering.  Such a waste of that much money. Needless to say, I don't recommend delivery from De Cero. Al least not in the winter, maybe.   I'd like to think they offer a better experience eating at the restaurant, but I'm not sure I even want to go there.  Not that great..",-0.431,0.778,0.115,0.107,0.5395969498910675

2011-01-24,2.0,"Went this past Saturday night.  Had an 8:15 reservation, got seated around 8:30, not bad.  There were 5 of us and we were seated at a 4 top with one person at the head of the table.  Our table was pretty tight, but didn't matter to us much.  If any of us had been big people, it could've been a problem. Our server was very non-existent for the most part.  We waited for her for a while to place an order, had our drinks empty several times and were hardly ever checked in on.  She was very impersonal and not very attentive. The food was ok.  My first complaint, and I knew about this going in, is that they charge for chips and salsa.  C'mon, you're a Mexican restaurant!  That should be standard.  For appetizer we had the Duck Nachos.  This consisted of 6 chips stacked with some duck meat, loads of cheese, some pico de gallo and maybe some onions.  They were good, but don't think that these are your typical nachos where you'll be digging away at them til your food comes.  Literally, it was six chips, almost like a Mexican Duck Bruschetta.   For our entree, we ordered 16 tacos among 5 of us.  None of them blew any of us away.  Also, the sides of salsa they bring out made us all chuckle... they are literally the size of a ketchup cup you would get from a fast food restaurant.  Are you serious?!?  I love salsa and this made me feel like I had to ration it for each taco.   The Chorizo was very spicy, and it literally consisted of a corn tortilla and about a half pound of chorizo meat.  There was nothing else to it.  The Chicken Mole was not great.  Tilapia was pretty fishy.  I liked the ground beef one.  And the people who had the Cheese Taco were pleasantly surprised.  Tuna taco was nothing to write home about. Overall, we all agreed we were very under-impressed.  I had been before and remembered it being a great place.  I'd say the food definitely took a step back, the service was not great and the margaritas were way too sweet.   Finally, one thing that we all noticed was the lack of music (you could barely hear it) in the restaurant. Also the lights were fairly bright.  The place lacked the warm feeling I remembered it having.   While I was very much looking forward to going back to De Cero, this trip underwhelmed us all and unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back.  My wife recommended we try Mercadito next time.",0.973,0.806,0.122,0.071,0.4461046245421246

This is not your typical Mexican fare, although they pay respectful homage to the street taco's that you find served from carts in Mexico---smaller than their American counterparts, but filled with flavor. The service was completely spectacular and warm-----much went into trying to make a grumpy (and finnicky) 12 year old happy and they went the distance in tweaking our order and in making sure she was happy. For an appetizer, we highly recommend the guacamole.  Although you can get guacamole anywhere, it seems fewer and fewer places make it to be memorable.  Theirs is (in a good way). With a HUGE selection of gourmet tacos on the menu, we especially enjoyed the platter option which allows you 8 tacos for $30.00 (they can be a little pricey considering they are small ""street sized"" tacos and are over $4.00 each if ordered individually.  We chose two of the following and were loving each selection:  steak (tender), chicken (moist), shrimp (tender), and tilapia (fresh), and each had their own sauce and they were great:  chipotle, crema, pico de gallo, salsa, and habanero.

I wish they'd have a regular red mild salsa on their menu- it would be such a nice complement to their amazing guac. Another thing that puzzles me-- the atmosphere. Very bare, plain, stark walls and atmosphere with tables lined up cafeteria style so you're almost touching your neighbor. So don't go there and expect a quiet romantic evening with your significant other or a first date--you may find yourself shouting to the person across the table.  However, after one or two of their delicious margaritas, I guess you barely notice. :) Their best tacos in my opinion: the tuna taco, duck confit, al pastor, and steak.

Duck nachos.  Good.  When the plate was brought out the man said ""where's the chips?""  Literally 6 chips piled high.  So ask for more chips.  The man and I split the 8 tacos.  Skirt steak, duck, shrimp and tilapia.  Shrimp and skirt steak were excellent.   Steak a little too spicy for my unspicy tongue.  Disappointed with the duck.  Not a fan of the corn salsa deal.  Little girl had enchiladas which she ate half of.  The beans and rice were honestly the plainest things on the table and a bit of a low note of the table.  Usually that is my fave part of the meal!

2010-11-14,2.0,"""Meh,"" is really all I have to say.  It was good but not mind-blowing by any stretch.  Overpriced for what it was. How are you not going to give people free chips and salsa? And, if you aren't you had better amaze me. But you didn't. Boo. Best thing ordered = MARGARITAS.  They deserve 5 stars. Get original, on the rocks, + salt, - inhibitions ----- that can make the 2 star food turn into a 3.5 star experience.  Do not skip on these. Order by the pitcher.   Disappointment of the night = goat cheese tamale. :( So sad! The mere mention of goat cheese in ANYTHING immediately sets off a Pavlov's dog response in me. I get excited... I need a napkin. I heart tamales; I triple-heart goat cheeses. BUT the chef did not deliver!!!! Bastard! It was dry! How, I don't know. Don't you steam those puppies? Anyway, def a huge disappointment to me and my vegetarian friend. Maybe it needed sauce of some sort. If you pour the green sauce that comes w/ the taco platter over it + some pico, it can be salvaged. But a good tamale can stand alone. Other uninteresting but alright things tasted were the tacos of all sorts. We ordered two of the 8 taco platters. You have to order 2 of one kind at a time. I will list them in descending greatness of the ones I sampled:  Rajas, steak, shrimp. I really wanted to try a fish taco b/c I heart them almost as much as goat cheese but my fellow diners were not down with the fish.  The guacamole is also bland; salt/lemon/lime/spice it up, please.  Did not get to try any of the salsas but the chips are good. Really crispy, crunchy w/ those great air bubbles that explode salty goodness. Too bad about the guac.   Anyway, the place has potential. It's in a nice spot, other places to explore around it. Minimalist decor in a nice way. (Except for the weird table legs people kept hitting when getting up from the table--- they are really narrow.) They just NEED SPICE in terms of food and waitstaff.

My friend and I agreed to go to De Cero after work and could not have been more disappointed.  We orderd chips and gauc and a drink each.  We were celebrating surviving another week teaching elementary school and my upcoming birthday.  We finished the appetizer and each ordered a second drink.  Almost two hours after we walked through the door, my friend ordered her third and final drink.  The waiter took her order and asked us for probably the fifth time if we wanted to order food.  I explained that we were waiting for my husband to meet us to eat and that we would be ordering soon.   The next thing I know, a waitress, who I can only assume is a manager, approaches us and begins to explain that she was refusing to serve us another drink.  I was so shocked I didn't know what to say.  I mentioned that even thought the restaurant was only half full, we would be happy to move to the bar and wait if she wanted.... Instead I asked for the bill and we left, never to go back again.  De Cero is the most pretentious place I've eaten in all of Chicago.  I will not go back and will no longer recommend it to friends.  You would be better off going somewhere with just as good of food that is more welcoming and less expensive.  And doesn't babysit diners.",0.9666,0.844,0.112,0.044,0.4955555555555555

The guacamole, my latest food obsession, was most excellent. I kind of wish that I held back a bit on it, less because other grubwithus people probably thought I was a pig from how much I ate and more because there was so much more deliciousness on its way. We had some sort of black bean cake stuff, which sounds boring and meh but was damn tasty, especially with their different salsas on the side. We then had steak chilaquiles, which I never had before and honestly it sounded like overrated nachos on the description, but ohmygod whatever they do to the chips, get them that right kind of crunchy and soft and have all these different cheeses on it, oh man... I took those bad boys home. We had a chorizo and egg skillet with fresh tortillas, which I think were the most ordinary of the meal but that's not much of a diss given how yum things were. Finally, the piece de la resistance... Horchata. French. Toast. My god I should have eaten nothing until these came so I had more room!! I am not actually huge on horchata, so I wasn't too excited but this was honestly one of the best french toast dishes I ever had. They used baguette slices I think, the sweet, cinnamony horchata based egg batter was all the way through the bread (take notes, Yolk!), and between the touch of caramelization and the walnuts it had just the right amount of crunch. Delicious. The service was really top notch. The only reason I docked a star were the drinks. While the coffee was sublime and bottomless the sangria was only ok but it was really expensive... $10 for a glass and $40 for a pitcher. One member of our table even gave his white wine sangria back, he said it was much too acidic. If they work on making the alcoholic drinks worth the price or making them cheaper, I'd be happier.

And if cocktails aren't your thing, no worries! De Cero does have a solid list of beers, wine, tequila, and other non-alcoholic beverages. Now, considering that the name isn't De Cero Margarita-ria but Taqueria, I believe it is time I addressed the food: Superb. Truly spectacular. Given that in the past year I have been on a margarita kick that I just can't seem to get rid of, I have tried and tasted many a Mexican fare and haven't always been as excited about what I was eating as I am when at De Cero. If I can say anything about your possible dining experience at this place is, please, please, please don't miss the Big Eye Tuna Tacos! Complete with a delicious mango salsa, this is one of the more delicious fish tacos I've tasted. Other mention-worthy dishes in my book are the goat cheese empanadas, the roasted pork belly tostadas, the guacamole, the duck nachos, and yes, even the rice and black beans were great. And if you're not too full, don't forget about dessert. I doubt you'll regret it.  So, go ahead. Give De Cero a try. With its simple and streamlined rustic decor, there will be nothing to distract you from your food, the people you're with, and the great time you'll be having.",0.9985,0.7,0.273,0.027,0.5453643578643579

2010-07-19,2.0,"Two words that should never have to be in the same sentence 'disappointing' and 'tacos.' Unfortunately this is what I have to say about De Cero, the tacos were disappointing. I love tacos of all kinds; however, you should never go to a taco joint and not be able to get a simple pork, chicken or steak taco.  I had the pork taco and the catfish taco, both were flavorless. The catfish taco tasted only like catfish, not like the delicious details that were listed on the menu. The mexican cole slaw that was supposedly in this taco was just pieces of slaw, there was no mexican flavor to accompany it. The sauce tasted like mayo but it was orange. I disliked it so much I made my husband eat it. The pork taco was a bore, everything sounds so delicious on the menu and I could barely choke it down. Let's talk tamales now.  The idea of a tamale stuffed with goat cheese, yes please. Actually eating it, sucked. It was dry and only the back half had cheese in it. The salsa that came along with it was fine, but nothing to shake a stick at. Next item up for debate, guacamole. The guacamole was actually very tasty; however, when we ordered spicy I didnt know it would just be a bunch of pieces of jalapeno on the top, I would have thought it was made to order. This appeared to be hand made, but scooped from a bucket and topped with jalapeno. Not what I was hoping for. The restaurant itself is fine, the crowd was not really my flavor, granted it was hipster city that day because Pitchfork was going on. Service was fine, we weren't neglected and the food came rather quickly. Don't bother to go in there and pay $4.00 a taco, we spent $50 on just lunch and I walked out unhappy and hungry. Authentic Mexican food is the way to go, not  these so called modern tacos. Save your cash and go to Perez across the street, at least its authentic.",0.948,0.784,0.135,0.081,0.46791076791076786

Last night was an office outing and we were looking for a place to grab margaritas after work. Somebody recommended that we try De Cero. I looked it up, reviews were iffy, but it was on Randolph St. and in the West Loop, so it had to be awesome, right? Well not exactly. We started with the chips, guacamole, pico de gallo, salsa verde, and regular. I have to say, the chips were awesome. The pico de gallo especially was full of flavor with the cilantro, spices, and onions. This was a great start! For margaritas, we started with the basic de cero Lime Margarita, a pitcher. 6 pitchers, at $40 bucks a pop, I barely had a buzz going. We split the pitchers between five people. I'm a major stickler for weak margaritas. I think there's absolutely no excuse to drink straight up lime juice. Margaritas were a disappointment, even the Skinny Organic Margarita.  For dinner, I went with the pick three tacos. Again, I looked at reviews and people were unhappy with the price. I gave the order the benefit of the doubt until my plate came out. I went with two black bean tacos and the rajas taco. That's literally all that was on my plate. Three small corn tortillas, with barely any filling. I can't even say that they were exceptionally good! This was extremely confusing to me because tacos/Mexican is so competitive in Chicago that to have such mediocre tacos in a hoppin' area was just strange to me.  Overall, a disapointment. Normally I can look past the price, but at $40 a pitcher for weak margaritas and over $15 dollars on three ""meh"" tacos, I just can't give De Cero a recommendation.

I went with two friends who had just finished taking level 2 of the CFA and needed to be gently re-released into society. On the order? Good food & strong drinks. We were counting on De Cero to deliver. The place was pretty packed, but it's a small place to begin with. First strike? You can't order their margaritas frozen. Doesn't it just take a blender and ice? The drinks were strong, and maybe a little too strong because the heavy tequila taste drown out the other flavors (I went with raspberry basil).  When we ordered our drinks, we also put in an order for guacamole and the duck nachos to start off with. About 20 minutes passed and we had ordered our entree (the taco platter) and still no apps and apparently no free salsa and chips? I was about to say something to our waitress but one of the waitstaff came by and dropped off the tacos. Entree before apps? Methinks something has gone awry.

We ordered it for a reason. Please bring it to us and make it snappy. The food. It was a busy Saturday night and I can forgive a mistake like that as long as the food redeems itself. Redemption was not the name of the game. The tacos were bland and lacking in flavor. Not to mention they were extremely messy and spewed out the contents anytime you bit into it. The chicken was dry, the salmon had an overly fishy taste, and the black bean & avocado tacos were too mushy. Finally the nachos and guacamole arrived. The nachos had to be eaten with a fork and the chips were already starting to get soggy. Guacamole had no flavoring whatsoever and most of it ended up uneaten. The final straw? The bill came and after their mishap, I would've thought that the nachos or guacamole would be comped and another apology issued. Neither happened.

To the rest of De Cero: Bite me losers! I know this sounds a bit harsh but wait! I have a list of the grievous errors!  1) If I make reservations I do not expect to be punished for it by receiving a high top table in the bar! That is for people who didn't make a reservation and don't want to wait for a real table.  2) I am 5'1, I CANNOT sit suspended in midair for over and hour on wooden chairs with no relief. I wanted to hop down like a damn 5yr old and ask if I could be excused.  3) There was some kind of problem (like I give a goddamn what the hell it was) and so our food was delayed. Too bad no one told us this. We just waited and waited. Nothing was offered to us while we waiting. If we had been told, maybe we would have even ordered something like nachos for our wait. Who knows? Our waitress gets points for being cute and little but those get zeroed out for avoiding us like the plague. Also, we had a Groupon, and I won't even go in the debacle that was our attempt to pay.  4) I waited over an hour for 2 $4 Tacos! I say it again 2 tacos at $4 each! Then when they arrived they had Corn Tortillas! Grossness! Never ever serve corn tortillas without giant warning letters EVERYWHERE! I saw some pictures of the food before and I swear they were flour. Why the unfortunate change???? Ugh.  5) The aforementioned overpriced tacos arrived in child size.

Anyway, that's not what you care about.  You care about food and drink.  Well, I had the mango-chile margarita.  It was delicious, and stronger than it tastes, which are both excellent qualities in a drink.  The ""chile"" part is in the spicy salt around the rim, so if you drink it through a straw, then it's just a mango margarita.  but a tasty one!

Last night, I came here for a friend's birthday party at 8:30p.m. De Cero already had mucked the reservation, so that's why our dinner began so late. I should have known then what I was in for. My husband and I arrived there on time to meet our friends. When I entered the restaurant, no one was at the hostess station. Waitresses kept on saying that we would be helped or at least directed to where our friends are. Instead, we ventured through the back of the dining room to find them. Seriously, I didn't realize that being a restaurant patron equaled being a pariah. We drank at the bar with our friends awaiting our reserved tables. We waited an hour to an hour and half. The nearly $10 margaritas were good, but no means sizeable enough to justify the price. The hostess offered my friends half of a table early, but was rejected because what's the point of a birthday dinner when only half of your friends are eating while the others are still waiting. Once we got our table around 9:30-10:00p.m. (the 8:30p.m. reserved tables mind you!), all of us were starving. De Cero realized some error in service and hospitality with some comped chips and guacamole. The chips and guac were nothing special, if not just average.  With our large party, a bunch of us ordered taco platters. The platters were served by adjacent staff who kept on giving the wrong platters to the wrong group of people. It's so much fun at dinner when you're sorting out what types of tacos each of the groups had (sarcasm). Our tacos nearly got eaten by other friends. Thanks De Cero! Our taco dinner was alright. They were definitely going the ""creative"" take on tacos and tacquerias. I liked the battered shrimp and tuna tacos. Our chorizo tacos weren't dressed correctly according to the description. We mentioned it and the addition of potatoes and cream made them better. Why couldn't they dress them correctly the first time? Also, these tacos didn't merit the $30 for 8 price. As I ate them, I kept on thinking that we're paying for their Randolph Street lease not quality of ingredients.  Overall, I had a horrible dining experience here.

I'm probably the wrong person for De Cero to start with, as I'm all about the ""quick-and-dirty"" taquerias that are so readily available for tasty and CHEAP Mexican food, and De Cero... isn't. Yes, the decor is rustic and appealing. Yes, they offer a selection of fancy tacos a la carte. Yes, they serve great agave margaritas. However, I can only take so much posturing when I'm out for a meal, particularly when I'm out for Mexican. And I'm sorry, but trying to pass off a ""corn tamale"" as something special just makes me laugh. Ummm, hello--masa is ALREADY made of corn, most people order tamales for what's INSIDE the corn, not because they want a bunch of whole corn kernels mixed into it! And just because you serve it rolled up in a little ball instead of a normal cylindrical tamale shape does NOT make it any more special. I know you think it does, but... no. It doesn't, De Cero. Get over yourself. The final cut was when I ordered a Diet Coke, and it was brought to me in a tiny, 10-oz. bottle. That costs $3.25. Do I really need to go on with this sentiment? Boo. No, I DON'T want another one, thanks. At the end of the meal, the taste that lingered in my mouth was more Chipotle than El Norte, and in my book that's a bad thing. This place is great if you live in the neighborhood, or need to take someone out for Mexican food who you think would be afraid to go to a genuinely authentic place.

(03) Ok....time for the downer portion of the review.  No matter how many times I ask (even asked the owner who knows me by name) they will NOT reserve an outside seat during the summer.  So show up earlier and plant yourself at the bar and wait. (04)  Servers are usually really sweet and helpful, but I have been there on more than one occasion where I have had to check someone on their attitude.  I'm not the type to feel special or like I deserve more, but if the server is having a bad day it's not my fault.  I had to go ""Jersey"" one day just to get water.  Just a warning......

It was a pretty cold day but I hardly felt any warmer inside where my friend and I sat in the very back of the restaurant behind the DJ booth. The restaurant was quiet and I think there might have been three people - max, on staff.  The brunch menu is simple and on the pricey side.

She got the black bean cakes and huevos and I got a combination of the pozole verde (chicken soup w/ hominy and radishes) and the breakfast papas. The soup was good and the hominy (which I've never had before but was told was like a south american corn) basically tasted like bits of potato. It warmed me up a little more.

Usually used to eating a very large chile relleno for an entire meal, this little bit size relleno apps went nicely quantity-wise with the already fat boy ceviche. Our custom tacos included tenderloin, duck, al pastor, chipotle chicken, and ahi tuna.  While the Al Pastor tacos would have been banned if served in Mexico due to blandness, the tenderloin trumped all!  Along with an ozzy of margaritas at the bar, De Cero did the trick for this Fri night.  The De Cero sauce was a nice mild gringo surprise when you think youre going into it with flaming lips and a bucket of water. It ain't brain surgery, but De Cero does what it does well, tacos & margaritas!  Yes De Cero little tacos are expensive, but so is the West Loop, and not many people are wandering around the West Loop looking to duck into a taco restaurant.  So keeping these two memos in mind helps one to go in De Cero with an open-attitude.  Once my buzz was flowing and the brain translated this great mexican food into late night eats, it was on.  Will definitely come back to get my taco and sexy time going at De Cero again...oh yeah and it got me laid too!",0.9937,0.833,0.153,0.013,0.6045119047619048

The mini tacos here are, uh, modern and good.  I have a very unrefined palate, so I could find only four I could eat.  The chorizo and tomatillo pork tacos were very tasty.  The skirt steak taco was just a bit too chewy for my taste, although the chipotle mayo was very good.   The salsa that they bring out to you with chips is plenty spicy but not so hot, and it will cost you an extra two bucks (I couldn't do the mild green salsa - picky).  Everything is a bit exorbitant at De Cero.   Service here was pretty good and friendly.  Sometimes I feel servers in general can be overly fake, but the girl who took care of us on this night was sweet, genuine and did a good job.  The bus staff also was very attentive.

At the end of the meal we annoyingly split the check, I hate doing this but we made it as easy as possible with writing down exactly how much to put on each card/cash...yet she still messed it up and we almost tipped her 40% before one of my more sober friends caught the mistake. Also, the busboy was the one that came and gave us our food in four separate shifts (doing it in roll-call style shouting out each entree and we had to claim them) which made some people sit there for 5 minutes with their food in front of them unable to touch it until all 8 of us had been served.  A few thoughts:  * The guacamole was SO yummy, very fresh and good serving size  * The tortilla chips were perfection. Clearly they are made onsite because they come out greasy (in a very good way) and taste delicious.  * The duck taco was awesome, please order it.  * Margaritas are pricey, too pricey in my opinion. They are delicious and a bit strong, but they are quite small for their $9 price tag.  * I was told the avocado tacos are a must, however they just tasted like cut up avocado with sour cream on a tortilla...as in nothing to write home about. My friends claimed that they had changed them or they were off, because they definitely used to be better.",0.9971,0.753,0.199,0.048,0.5565582655826559

2009-10-21,1.0,"Meh is right.  Not that expected more, but, if promoted as an upscale, urban-meets-rustic Mexican taqueria, at least get the taqueria part right.  Right?  Granted, this is not a taqueria in Pilsen, so my expectations were a little less than average.   What I liked:  Many different taco options (15 to be exact).  Tamales.  Guacamole.  Chips and salsa.  Pretty good variety of the basics.  And, a good variety of other entrees, none of which I tried.  Great ambiance.  Nice layout.   Good location.  Servers and host were extremely pleasant. What I didn't like:  Soggy, store bought tortillas -- both of the tacos I tried used a single, flimsy corn tortilla.  Authentic?  I'm inclined to say no.  They complete ruined a perfectly good skirt steak taco by slathering some mayo-like sauce that tasted of plastic all over the inside of that taco.  The al pastor was tasty, IF I WAS ABLE TO TASTE IT -- there are no salt/pepper shakers on the table for a reason...because apparently there is no salt or pepper used in the dishes. The plate of duck nachos had exactly 5 chips on it, buried under a mound of porky-tasting (I thought it was duck....oh yeah, the rendered duck fat oozing out of the pile reminded me it was) shredded duck and some white cheese looking melted substance -- not so bad, HAD IT BEEN SEASONED.  Throw a little salt on that bad boy.    Service was doggedly slow -- the table next to us, who was seated AFTER we ordered received their food first, AND left before we were done eating.    The side of re-fried beans I ordered, touted as ""bacon mashed pinto beans"" tasted IDENTICAL to La Preferida's version, and the low-fat version at that!  You don't have to be a CSI investigator to tell the beans were from a can.  And, ""bacon mashed""?  Puh-leese.  I didn't taste a hint of the porky, fatty goodness of bacon in those beans.  Bacon.  What bacon? But, to add insult to injury, tacos average $4 each -- OVER-PRICED.  And it only gets worse -- a two-tablespoon serving of salsa (in this case, pico de gallo) is $1!  Holy guacamole!   Our server was nice enough to give us three macaroons gratis due to the slow service.  But, if I'm paying about $9 for two flimsy taco-wannabes, I expected a little more, like, TAKE THE $3 OFF OUR BILL FOR THE 6 TABLESPOONS OF SALSA YOU GAVE US. I really wanted to like De Cero.  Really.  I did.  But, think twice before you spend the last of your dimes (after you pay your 2009 property taxes) on De Cero.  Authentic Mexican taqueria?  Go to Pilsen.  Rapido.",0.9927,0.775,0.15,0.074,0.46690917107583757

Okay, sounds good. Upon our arrival, we were told that the wait for a patio table would be 45 minutes. It looked like a couple of tables were near finished, so I thought we would likely be seated more quickly. My friend and I took a seat at the bar and ordered margaritas. I asked for a mango on the rocks and she asked for a papaya on the rocks. We were informed by the bartender that those can only be served blended. Really? We asked him to give it a shot anyway and the margaritas were fair enough. Not particularly flavorful, but the bartender was heavy handed with the tequila so naturally, I was satisfied. I thought about ordering a Pacifico as drink #2, but a Pacifico was $6. Marg = way more bang for my drunken buck. An hour later we were seated at a table outside. Unfortunately, the table was on an uneven part of the sidewalk so my friend's chair was nearly three inches off the ground on one side. But after our strong margaritas we were amused and didn't mind rearranging. We ordered the chips & guacamole to start. The guac was awesome, though the serving was arguably the smallest portion I've ever seen. We then moved on to the platter of eight tacos. I selected the battered shrimp (amazing), chicken mole (mediocre), beef tenderloin (tasted like one of my Mom's dry pot roasts) and skirt steak (bland and tough). We also ordered a side of black beans & rice (average), as well as the Mexican slaw (interesting).

Thankfully only one charge (the correct charge) eventually cleared, but the other three charges totaled $150, which was a sizable chunk of my checking account suddenly rendered unavailable for the weekend. I guess that's a risk I assumed by not rolling with enough cash, but really, THREE extra charges? Excessive, de cero, and enough to discourage me from giving you another shot. Three stars because the drinks were good and the food was fine, but I can find fine food and good drinks in plenty of other places.",-0.5449,0.757,0.126,0.118,0.5621558441558442

My boyfriend threw a birthday dinner for me here and they were fairly accommodating I think (I've been here plenty of other times too) - have a nice little room up front with french doors/windows, etc. I've never been disappointed with my experience here - I always get the $30 taco platter and split it with my other half thinking it will be the perfect size as he's a big eater, but it's without fail too much every time - that being said it's a good deal, just include another eater. The chips and salsa are great, but they're not complimentary ($6 or $7). It's definitely not as cheap as some of the other Mexican places around - the drinks can add up clearly - , however, it's a pleasant environment, good ambiance, great for a casual/nicer dinner, good for groups and fresh fare.

2009-07-22,3.0,"I have had several people tell me this place is incredible so I was dying to try it. I bought a Groupon a few months back and was ready to put it to use. So when my birthday came around (it was Monday) my best friend and I headed straight there.  It was a cozy little place. We tried to sit outside but the wait was 30 minutes so we settled for a table that was about 1 foot away from the tables on either side of us (did I mention it was cozy?). Fortunately it livened up in there so the neighbors next to us were straining to listen to our fantasticically fun, hilarious conversation (poor couple--I felt for them in their complete silence. but i digress..) We began with a modified classic margarita. I was dissapointed to find out that their margaritas were made with classic sours mix. I really was expecting freshly squeezed lime juice with my margarita, with a place that was supposed to be that fabulous. Per my request, they made us a margarita that was supposedly freshly squeezed (I decided to play the role of the high maintenance guest--sorry Maria) but I'm pretty certain it was not fresh. Needless to say, I got a second one. I think it was my low tolerance that made that decision. I have had better but then again we may be to blame for modifying it in the first place. I guess I didn't give them a shot. For our second round my friend had the hibiscus margarita. That was very good. Unique, at the least.  Both wanting something different we started with the duck nachos. They were good--not absolutely amazing but tasty, yes.  Myself always wanting a little bit of everything--and again in agreement with my friend--we decided to get the taco combination platter. I tried the avacado (can you go wrong with avacado? never),  al pastor (pineapple goes good with everything), battered shrimp (+ avacado and cilantro--very nice) and then the ahi tuna (meh). The mango salsa they served with the tacos was incredible. The green sauce (was it tomatillo? not sure) was good--but only good. We left the red sauce alone. It looked boring.    Dessert time. And here is where it gets exciting. For my birthday they brought out flan. It was perfection. Heavenly. Lick-the-plate worthy. I would come back solely for the flan. The texture was perfect. The flavor was light and delicate. I was only dissappointed when I saw the check. They made us (really my friend since she was treating me for my birthday) pay for my birthday flan. El cheapo (that's mexican for, what cheap jerks they are that they can't spare a flan for a birthday). Overall, I would say that De Cero is good but I think that I only thought it was amazing at the time because of the two margaritas flowing through my system. I probably won't go back. There are better Mexican places out there. Maybe, though, I need to try some other items on the menu.

2009-07-21,2.0,"First, the drinks. My Corona was warm. This is ok in Mexico when I'm on a beach. This is not ok in Chicago when I'm paying $6 for it. I agree with the previous reviewer's complaint about the house margarita. A $9 margarita needs to have more tequila than simply having been shown a bottle of Patron. Second, the service. We had a moderately sized group of 9. We had reservations. We still had to wait half an hour for a table, when there was another one open which would have seated us comfortably. Instead, we had one person sitting at the end of a two person table. After being seated, we waited another half an hour to order appetizers, another half an hour to order food, and then another 45 minutes to actually recieve the food. Of course, by this point we had all loaded up on the passable chips and weren't that hungry. Third, the food. Starting with appetizers, we ordered the ceviche, some guacamole, and the duck nachos. The ceviche was very, very bland, and the pieces of aquatic life that it contained were far too large for a tortilla chip. No cilantro, no red onion (though it seemed to actually have pieces of it in there), no lime. Just blah. The guacamole was ok. I prefer mine a bit less creamy, but again, very lacking in anything other than avocado flavor. The duck nachos were quite good, however. Finally, the entrees. I ordered a salmon taco, an ahi tuna taco, and a braised duck taco. The ahi tuna taco was quite good, with a good amount of tuna, an acceptable level of spice (though lacking in the mango department), but a disappointing corn tortilla. The salmon taco needed more...what's the word....oh right. Flavor. It needed some of that. Finally, the duck taco was supposed to be served with a corn salsa. Now, I realize Chipotle isn't the best salsa in the word, but they've got a decent corn salsa. De Cero....not so much. Skip it. Fourth, the price. $47 of frustration and shattered hopes and dreams. Enough said. The verdict: De Cero seems to think that by having nuevo Mexican cuisine and a trendy Randolph St. location justifies high prices. You need to actually have the food quality and service to back it up however. I won't be returning.",0.8184,0.856,0.084,0.06,0.4061309523809523

Vegetarian black bean:  B-, kind of boring and no texture Tomatillo pork:  B Battered shrimp:  B+, nice big chunks of shrimp, maybe a little too much crema Braised duck:  A-, excellent!  A lot of meat and the sweet corn is perfect Battered catfish:  D-, blech.  One bite of this thing and I nearly spit it out; it tasted like a dirty fish tank, which makes sense, I guess.  I've had catfish before, but this stuff was awful; a bad misstep that I'll do my best to overlook. Beef tips:  B+, yum for mushrooms! Tres queso:  A, seriously, it was just cheese and roasted poblano, but this taco was amazing.  I don't know what kind of cheese (probably one was chihuahua) or what they did to it, but it was so damn good.  Eat this one first before it gets cold and the cheese congeals. 8 tacos of your choice for $30.50 is a great option for two people. We also ordered the tres salsas, but those were a disappointment.  The green tomatillo was nice and cool but a bit bland; the hot red stuff was mostly flavorless except for the HEAT; the pickled jalapenos and other vegetables were the best, but there's only so much masochism that I can muster for eating pickled jalapenos.  However, I loved the fresh pico de gallo that they brought with the tacos.  I wolfed down all of it with the leftover chips after the tacos were gone. One other thing about De Cero:  I really like the 98% wood interior.  It's rustic and unexpected for a ""taqueria"" and the aesthetic created is much different than, say, a British/Irish-style pub done in all wood.",0.9974,0.728,0.205,0.068,0.5897401433691758

For Mexican in this area, I usually stop by La Perez but tonight we thought we'd check out the competition. We're definitely glad we stopped in. The menu is pretty extensive and the descriptions of the dishes made my mouth water! We ordered guacamole, carne asada, chorizo taco, and braised duck taco.  For dessert we had the white chocolate brownie with chocolate chip ice cream. Everything tasted really delicious and great.  Except for maybe the braised duck. Maybe my expectations for it were too high? But all the yelpers said to get it. So I got it! It tasted rather bland and dry. I had to smoother it with guacamole to juice it up a bit and still couldnt finish it.  The wait staff was extremely friendly. They constantly monitored whether we needed a refill in our drinks (the horchata is delicious!) or chips (they refilled it even though we had 1/4 of a basket left!). And they took away our plates quickly after we had finished.  Overall we had a great experience.

2009-05-14,4.0,"""Andrea H. and the Case of the Disappearing Salsa"" The scene:  Wednesday night, 7pm.  Andrea H. and Adam W. at the bar waiting for a table.  They order chips & salsa.  The bartender delivers plates, napkins and a bottle of De Cero branded salsa. Adam W.:  ""Is this it?""  as he points to the bottle Andrea H.:  ""I don't know, but it's a really cute idea."" 2 minutes pass.  The bartender delivers the chips and salsa in a bowl. Andrea H:  ""Oh, I guess the stuff in the bottle is just extra sauce.""   Host:  ""Your table is ready."" Adam W.:  ""OK, let's bring our chips and salsa.""   He takes the chips, walks to the table and walks back.  Andrea H. gets her purse. Adam W.:  ""Where did the salsa go?"" Andrea H.:  ""I don't know.  I didn't see anything.  Hopefully they'll bring another."" 3 minutes pass.  Another bowl of salsa arrives at the table along with another bottle of De Cero branded salsa. To be continued... Our time at the bar gave us the opportunity to explore the menu.  I'll start with the drinks.  I was happy to see that Palomas and Cheladas were part of the drink menu, but I was disappointed to see that all of the margs are made with sour mix.  Sour mix is ok for pitchers at a divey place, but I feel like expensive margs should be top shelf.  I ordered the Paloma and it was good, but pretty sour.  For my second drink, I was happy to order a Michelada and have the server know what that was, first of all, and second, to have it with Negra Modelo.  It was made perfectly.  Tangy, a bit spicy, and all kinds of delicious.  Yum. We decided to go with the taco sampler.  So many tasty looking options.  Some were hits and some were misses.  Here we go. The Hits! * Ahi Tuna with Mango & Habanero Salsa:  Interesting - shredded ahi but not much more than a hint of the sweet/spicy salsa.  Good, though. * Chipotle Chicken:  The mashed bacon pinto beans totally make this one.  Smoky and so so good!  OMG.   * Rajas:  Very flavorful grilled peppers and cheese. * Battered shrimp:  The batter is light and delicious and doesn't overwhelm the taste of the shrimp. * Braised duck:  The duck in combination with the sweet corn salsa was very complimentary. * Al Pastor:  Very flavorful pork - very smoky.  The pineapple was a good, subtle accompaniment. The Misses * Chicken Mole:  Very dry.  The flavor of the mole was overshadowed by the fact that I needed several sips of my drink to get it down. * Skirt Steak:  Way overcooked and ridiculously chewy.  Toothpick please! The tacos were good portions of meat and I was very happy that they were not smothered in sauce.  The sauces were just enough to compliment the meat.  Perfect.  I also liked the three salsa that came with them.  The hot is definitely my fav, spicy, but not crazy. ...continuation... The scene:  Dinner is finished.  The busser comes to clear the dishes.  Andrea H. and Adam W. reflect on being happily stuffed. Adam W.:  ""Hey, where did that bottle of salsa go?"" Andrea H.:  ""I have no idea, I never saw him take it.  Guess they don't want you stashing it in your purse on the way out.""

Your goat cheese tamale set my mouth on fire with the hot of the salsa calmed by the cool of the cheese.  Your chips and guac cooled my angry head from driving in some crazy traffic just to get to you.  So what went wrong, you ask? Simple. The service. The bartender could not be gotten no matter what we did. Yes it was busy- but there were three of you back there and no one could wait on us? Really? And then when we finally did get a drink we ordered the next one right away for fear we would never see you again.  Once seated- our server was better- attentive and helpful - and she made some great suggestions from the menu,  Know if you go it is NOISY in the place- lots of solid surfaces with little to cut down the noise so my suggestion would be to grab one of the bistro tables out front where it was definitely easier to hear your friends.  Valet parking is $10 or on a weeknight you will probably be able to find parking on one of the side streets.  My advice?

De Cero took great care of a rowdy table of 10 celebrating a bachelorette party this past weekend. I loved that it's more ala carte style - which is great for groups - as everyone can eat at their own pace.  We started with a few orders of guacamole which was good (not overwhelmingly great) and got the margaritas going. Everyone got different tacos (I loved the chicken chipotle taco!) or entrees.

I don't understand the reviews that call the food bland, although the pulled pork tamale could have had more spice cooked into the pork (easily fixed with the hot sauce on the table). The goat cheese tamale was delicious, as was the shrimp taco. Neither was bland.  The atmosphere is typical of a trendy West Loop restaurant. It's nice, but a lot of hard surfaces make it loud. The service was a little slow for a Wednesday night, but that was forgivable. What I found troubling was redeeming my $35 Groupon. The bill came out to $29 plus tax and tip. I gave the server my Groupon and my credit card for the tax and tip, but for some reason she simply could *not* redeem the Groupon, since the bill was less than $35. She said she could not give change for the Groupon, to which I replied that I didn't want or need change. Nowhere does it say I have to spend at least $35. She asked if she could bring something else, and I refused.  Eventually she brought two margarita shots, which we did not ask for, and which she added to the bill.

2009-05-06,2.0,"Came here with a friend for cinco de mayo dinner. I never really understood the concept of expensive Mexican food.. as a Californian, my idea of good Mexican is something served at hole-in-the-wall type establishments. Just because you put diced mangoes and cilantros in the taco does not make it gourmet, or worth $4/taco instead of 4 tacos/$1. I was hoping de cero would change my mind--it didn't.  I enjoyed the lively atmosphere, but we had to yell to hear each other across the table. The service was good, and the margaritas were excellent. I wanted something frozen and blended, and our server recommended the mango margarita with toasted coconut garnish (yummy! my favorite part of the meal!) and my friend had the de cero house margarita, which he enjoyed as well. They really don't skimp on the ingredients and you can taste the tequila.  The food on the other hand, was less than impressive. We shared 3 tamales (goat cheese and pulled pork, the goat cheese was much better). The tacos were kind of a disappointment. I was really excited by all the variety offered, but none blew my mind. We got the 8 taco combo which seemed to be a popular choice, and sampled the ahi tuna, chicken mole, skirt steak and braised duck. I will echo the other yelpers in saying that they were dry, bland, and generally mediocre.

I'll start with the highlights: the Passionfruit and Hibiscus margaritas were terrific, and the duck nachos were great. The duck was cooked to perfection and the cheese was melted just right. Now for the rest of the meal. We waited for at least 20 minutes staring at four open tables for the hostess to finally come over and seat us at our table, after an initial 30 minute wait at the bar. By the time we were seated it was almost forty minutes after our reservation time.  Our other appetizer (besides duck nachos), the mushroom quesadilla, was just that - plain mushroom quesadilla. It was something I could've made at my apartment without very much effort. Don't get me wrong, it tasted fine, but it was absolutely nothing special. For our entrees my girlfriend had the three tamales combo and I had four tacos: guacamole, chorizo, chipotle chicken and steak. The guacamole taco was incredibly bland, it tasted like avacado chunks inside a tortilla, almost no flavor whatsoever. The remaining three tacos were almost indistinguishable, and if it were not for stealing my girlfriend's sour cream and salsa verde from the tamales my tacos would have been tasteless as well. Speaking of the tamales, again, bland. We were able to tell which of the three was the pulled pork tamale but couldn't figure out which was which of the remaining two. Needless to say, we will not be returning to De Cero any time soon. I guess if you live in the neighborhood and need some overpriced Mexican this place would do the trick.

2009-02-22,4.0,"I was informed that my roomate was competing in a speed eating contest.  Naturally I assumed that we would be going to a local burrito joint when I found out that the means of competition was tacos, I was mistaken. I found myself a part of a group of 20 for dinner at de cero.  This is a nice taqueria in the west loop.  We started with a pitcher of margaritas, which were amazing (smooth, crisp, refreshing-I felt like it was summer for a moment).  After all of the spectators had arrived we were sat at a nice big table by a front window.  I was very impressed with the soft lighting and laid back atmosphere.  We all continued to drink and enjoy the excellent guacomole and chips and salsa.  Meanwhile, my roomate (who is a girl) and her competition (her friend Abe) took pre-fight photos and talked smack to each other in anticipation of the upcoming battle.  Side bets were beginning to be made, and the tension in the room was mounting. The waitress took the large order with relative ease and expertise, most of us ordered some variation of tacos (they have about 15 different types to choose from).  My friend and I chose to order the combo platter which is 8 tacos of your choosing.  We chose a variety so that we could better asses this new found taqueria. Just as it began to snow outside, our food began arriving.  The competitors were prepped and ready for war (I know that my roomate had not eaten all day, and I heard that Abe had been ""training"" all week).  We all rose to watch as the countdown to scarfing began, I noticed that nearby patrons became interested and even some guys from the other side of the bar came over to watch. Ready! Set! Go!  The race is off. I was worried for a minute because my roomate started off slow ( I obviously bet a shot of tequila on her) but it wasn't long before she started pulling ahead.  By taco number two, she had almost a half taco lead.  It was soon clear that she would be triumphant.  Victory is hers!  Abe still had a full taco left.  (In the interests of full disclosure, my roomate ate 3 vegitarian tacos while abe ordered 3 with meat, details details). After the customary lining up and shaking hands, Team Abe and Team Lauren resumed dinner as normal.  After the completion the competitors spoke to the crowd. ""Now I know what it's like to be in the olympics"" Lauren said ""He had his eyes on you the whole time and you had your eyes on your tacos the whole time."" said one Tara Havenga from the crowd. Abe had no comment as he went over the match in his head. As far as the review of the actual food, here it is.  I loved the margaritas, and the guacamole was very good (about the same as other nicer mexican places around the city).  I sampled 7 different tacos, and here is the breakdown: The 3 cheese was my favorite (I am usually a meat lover), The steak was very good, the shrimp was good, the duck was good, the tenderloin tip was good, the chipotle chicken was far too smokey-fail, and the ahi tuna tasted like a can of tuna in a tortilla-fail.  So the final verdict was that the food was OK, slightly above average.  Luckily the atmosphere, excellent service and of course the great company made my experience an enjoyable one. I would have to honestly say 3.5 stars, but in a pinch I say 4 over 3, so thats what Im giving here.  Hail Lauren, queen of speed eating: tacos.",0.9985,0.804,0.173,0.023,0.531340594888982

So it was surprisingly busy at De Cero this time, but the wait was only about 10-15 min. Not a big deal. I've only ever had tacos when I came here, but that is because they have an amazing list of taco choices a la carte for about $3-4 each. I haven't had a bad one yet. Among some of my favorites are the Chipotle Chicken, Al Pastor, and the Catfish taco. But they also have shrimp, salmon, chorizo, etc.. 3-4 tacos will do the job, but I could just keep eating them if they kept bringing them out. The chips and salsa and guac are also quite good.

2009-02-11,5.0,"I fell in love with this place the minute I walked in the door. A date took me here and we found this cozy little corner at the end of the bar. It was a Thursday night, so the crowd was pretty calm. It seemed as if everyone else was on a date that night. The name of the restaurant intrigued me, the translation means ""from scratch"" and that's just how everything tasted. The menu has an amazing selection of unique options. You'll find it interesting to know that the concept was created by the co-owners of Sushi Wabi.  The interior is very charming with a rustic, relaxing feel. It wasn't too loud and people seemed to take their time eating and chatting. I instantly felt calm. The music softly crooned in the background and I couldn't help but feel instantly sexy. My date and I tried the Taco Combination Plate which offers 8 different tacos with 3 salsa choices for $29. They have a wide variety of choices to choose from, not just beef and chicken that's for sure! We tried the Ahi Tuna which was (amazing!!), Chipotle Chicken, Chicken Mole, Battered Shrimp, Braised Duck, Al Pastor,Avocado, and the Sauteed Salmon. My moto is, you should try everything once so I went out of the box with these taco choices. My favorite? The Braised Duck!! Seems that I'm not alone in feeling this way as fellow Yelpers LOVE IT. I'm really picky about my guacamole, and half the time it's just too much avocado, not enough seasonings. I could have licked the bowl clean it was so good.  I'm also really picky about my margaritas and De Cero's Passion Fruit Margarita is something to tell your friends about. Oh my gosh. The Hibiscus Margarita is also something fresh and new, they actually put hibiscus flowers in the pitcher to garnish it. Our bartender was awesome and everything he recommended we got and love it. He was hilarious and kept us entertained! I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who wants to switch up their same old places.

The food is very fresh tasting and serves up some great flavor combinations. The best way to experience the flavors in general is to try the taco platter. You can try eight different types, all of which are tasty. I would skip the margaritas all together - way too pricey for a splash of tequila and not really that flavorful. Taste too much like your basic mix. But, everyone has their own taste pallets for margaritas. Both times I have been, the service was less than stellar. We had a large party (11) and our table was only set for 10. Larger parties do require a bit more attention but the wait to get another beer was too long. Never were we asked if our food was ok or if we needed anything else - not even if we wanted more booze! We all sort of had the feeling that we were a bother to the staff. Maybe it was an off night for them but I had basically this same experience the first time I went there and we were only a party of four.  I would go back again but not with the expectation that I would walk away with an outstanding experience due to the service experience.

I really wanted to try a tamale, but the tacos were more than enough. The guacamole was really good too. The margaritas are strong and the traditional margarita was a real margarita - not syrup with tequila like a lot of Mexican places will serve you.

That is, not a big fancy dinner, but a casual night out with friends for really good, authentic mexican food. I've been twice and the food really is fantastic. It's unlike most Mexican in the U.S., or at least in Chicago, in that the menu and the tastes are what you'd get when you're actually in Mexico. I really really loved the Rajas taco and the others are yummy. When I went for dinner, no complaints except that you will be STUFFED if you order more than three tacos, don't fall for the platter! You get way too much for two people. The drinks are great and the chips are decadent.  I think that they are actually quite overpriced, but given that I haven't had Mexican this good in Chicago, I guess it's ok. But it really is essentially a casual, hip atmosphere with prices that exceed those boundaries. Other quick complaint is that when I went there for lunch, all the tacos were lukewarm. This wasn't a problem at dinner so maybe because it was a late lunch (around 1:30) the fillings had been premade and sitting out for a while. Also we kind of got conned into the pretty expensive guac/salsa app. The waitress asked if we wanted chips and guac, we said no, and then i said well maybe just chips and salsa.

Thankfully the goat cheese stuffed hot chili masa tamale was fantastic and quite the tamale trio saving grace!

2008-10-22,4.0,"Boy am I glad that I'm (barely) a marginally decent darts player or I may not have had the very enjoyable pleasure of experiencing a solid take on a modern day taqueria. Winning my 'fancy' lunch by managing to eek out a sloppy win against my bff of 15 yrs, Hilary P., proved though to actually be a win for both of us. Great company, stylish surroundings and downright addictive food? That is win, win, win, my friends.  Sliding in on a Tuesday afternoon right before the lunch cutoff was key for our celebratory lunch. The dining room is small and decorated with interesting wood (check out the paneled ceiling!) and metal accents... sleek floors and seating are equally modern and stylish but provide positively no absorption for noise. A half-empty de cero was fully loud. I can only imagine dinner dining here... bring your outside voices!! The play up on decor is an adequate match for the upscale Mexican menu. At de cero you'll find an interesting balance of traditional Mexican flavors with au currant ingredients perfect for highlighting a more sophisticated taste than refried pintos and whiz nachos. We went all out in full yelper style to try half the menu (of course) and found everything to be inventive, fresh and tasty. I think I might even be in love... let's see, if de cero was a new, hot beau of mine I might expect our first encounters to go something like this...  First Base: Guacamole. Safe, predictable. While full of robust, garlicky flavor and the perfect hint of onion a nice little spicy kick leaves you hungry, teased and excited for more.  Second Base: Combo Tamales. Heading into questionable territory now... the fresh corn and crema tamale was sweet, luscious and delectable while the pulled pork and verde salsa tamale tasted oddly like dog meat. What kind of date is this?? I didn't ask for no donkey show... glad we're back on track with the phenomenal and creamy goat cheese and hot chili masa tamale, I was starting to think I might have to kick you to the curb.  Rounding Third... A la carte Tacos. A little bit of this and a little bit of that. I'm a girl that loves variety - missionary tacos? Not so much. You pick three ways? Or four ways? Or five? Now you're talking... My tacos, plain and simple, were the bees knees that made me weak in the knees. The sign of a good date indeed... I loved the hell out of the battered shrimp taco (+ a side of cheese... hush now, I know it's not authentic but I dig on my dairy). The braised duck taco with sweet corn salsa and homemade tortilla was savory and sweet and amazing. AMAZING. Four more of those next time. The skirt steak taco with potato, lime and chipotle mayo was good, but I'm not much of a chipotle girl... the smokiness ain't my bag. Drowning it in cheese though? Made it orgasmic.  Coming into Home: Three cheese, red chipotle salsa, chicken enchiladas. Mmmmmmm. Mmmmmmmm. I know that I said I'm not a chipotle girl, but the cheese clearly masked all that noise. I was s.a.t.i.s.f.i.e.d. - It was crunchy, cheesy, smothery, tasty... perfect. Oooooooooh Ahhhhhhhhh... all cylinders firing...... almost there....

2008-10-14,5.0,"Did somebody say passion fruit Margarita's? Yes please. De Cero is an old idea taken from years of know how and brought to the 21st century. Other restaurants want to be De Cero. The concept of a modern day taqueria is a winner. Taking classic Mexican dishes and infusing them with relevant quality ingredients like duck, goat cheese, tenderloin tips and my favorite, house made drink mixes is key to De Ceros success. Went with an old friend of mine to catch up on a months worth of missed gossip, chit chat, and other musings and had a blast. We opted for a dinner of appetizers including chips and guacamole, duck nachos (be aware the pico de galo {sp?} is hot for some,) beef tenderloin skewers in a smokey salsa, and the tamale trio which includes pulled pork, goat cheese, and sweet corn. The sweet corn was blah but it's sweet corn what do you expect. Food was great but I will totally go back there for the passion fruit and guava margarita's any day! Service = Phee-Nom! Justin brought us everything we needed and the manager (I think his name was Ozzy) made an effort to check in with us which is always really professional. Atmosphere = Modern Mex. We sat in the bar area and although there are some things they noticeably DIY'ed the place wins out in ambiance. The lighted ceiling in the dining room is great design and really sets a mood.

So, I asked the staff and he told me 4 years, where have I been? When I arrived I was a bit confused because they told me I could wait in the bar. Well, when you walk in you do not see the bar, it is in a room adjacent to the main dining room! The staff was very nice and when my party arrived, the host actually remembered my name and used it when addressing me. I thought it was a nice touch. They did sit us at this very strange table for 2 in the middle of the dining room and it felt like we were on stage or something. We did ask to move and they were accommodating.  I am a huge fan of Mexican food, just love it (which is another reason why this is so crazy that I didn't know about this place in my neighborhood). At first I wasn't sure if I should get the enchiladas or tacos. Since I always order enchiladas I went for the tacos and what a list to choose from! I finally decided on skirt steak, battered shrimp and beef tenderloin tips. My favorite was probably the skirt steak because the chipotle mayo was delicious. The battered shrimp was just as good with the avocado crema! I should also mention they made me a delicious mojito to go with my tacos!

2008-07-04,2.0,"A taco joint from the owners of Sushi Wabi?  You had me at taco, and after reading the positive reviews I was definitely geeked to check out De Cero for a friend's birthday. Overall I would say I found this place to be underwhelming.  The guacamole, which some on Yelp have raved about, was average at best.  But hey, with such an extensive taco menu maybe it's best to eschew the chips and just concentrate on the main event. The taco menu is pretty sizable so I ended up choosing the tacos that seemed the most unusual.  My first choice was the ahi tuna taco.  While the tuna was cooked perfectly, as a taco it wasn't working.  After I ate the taco I couldn't shake the feeling that the tuna would've been better as is, and that the tortilla actually took away from the dish's efficacy.   Next up was the duck taco.  I love duck and this duck just wasn't up to snuff.  It actually looked like shredded pork, and was woefully under-seasoned.  Duck is a fatty bird, and that's the part that tastes the best.  The taco would've been far better if they had left the skin on the bird, and seasoned the dish appropriately. The next two tacos saved this place from getting a one star review.  The chorizo taco was the first taco I tried with flavor, and the sauce that accompanied it complimented it well.  The skirt steak taco was hands down the best.  I'm not so sure about sticking potatoes in a taco, but the meat is so well prepared and seasoned that this taco is the stand out best. As for drinks, the place was alright.  The margaritas didn't taste of too much tequila or salt.  Although I don't always drink beer, when I do I prefer Dos XX's which was available as well.   The service ended up being pretty decent.  I was initially leery of our waiter, who sported a skullet and had the tendency to roll his eyes at us, but by evening's end he had done an admirable job of putting up with us. At the end of the day I'd give this place 2.5 stars.  It was just good enough that I would give it one more shot to shine, but not good enough that I can say I'd recommend it.",0.9957,0.821,0.167,0.011,0.433098426121682

The tacos are a little pricey - 3 to 5 bucks a piece but they were obviously made with top notch ingredients.  Get the battered catfish taco; it was my favorite and the fish went really well with the chipotle mayo!  The chorizo taco and the skirt steak taco were high quality as well. I got the sorbet for dessert which was pretty standard.  None of the desserts looked spectacular but that's hardly a big deal at a taco joint.  The restaurant looks nice with wooden benches and tables.  It was pretty quiet and fairly empty around noon when we showed up.  Bottom line - De Cero is a great taco joint if you want something a little classier (and pricier).,0.9963,0.717,0.273,0.01,0.639111111111111

Some might seem a bit off-putting but try them. My favorites were the braised duck with sweet corn salsa and the chicken mole. Both were very tasty. The combination of the sweet corn with some of the salsa was excellent. We also had the ahi tuna and chorizo tacos. The chorizo were better than tuna but both were on the dry side. We ordered the ceviche appetizer. It was a  big bowl of some really great scallop and shrimp ceviche with a huge bowl of chips. Much bigger portion that I imagined Highly recommended.

2008-04-15,5.0,"This restaurant is pretty solid in all aspects of dining. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated with a lot of iron work and worn wood. The colors are bright but subtle and make for a pleasant dining experience.  The food is fresh and very good. The taco list alone is full of options that include fish and mango, skirt steak with avocado, veggie black bean, shrimp, and a couple chicken options. I think there are at least 10 different taco choices. You can order an entree like chicken breast with veggies or other standard Mexican fare, but their taco menu seems to be what they push. You can mix and match your tacos and get as many or as few as you would like. I shared a chicken burrito and 3 tacos with a friend and we were both unable to finish our own halves. One thing to note: the seafood at this restaurant is fresh and tastes great. None of that ""fishy"" taste that some restaurants can't seem to avoid when serving seafood.  They also have an excellent drink selection. You can try one of their many specialty margaritas (most around $10 a glass), or you can opt for a pitcher of their house margarita (for only $35), which serves about 6 glasses. Our first pitcher didn't seem to have a lot of tequila in it, and when we mentioned this to our waiter, he made our second one extra strong :) The service is pretty good here. The waiters have a lot going on, but they want their customers to have a good dining experience and they're willing to answer any questions and fix anything that you may be unhappy about. Unlike other Randolph St. restaurants, this restaurant is not fancy; you can definitely get away with jeans and a nice top. The food is actually decently priced, but you can expect to spend a lot on alcohol. Our tab for 5 people was $220, but about $150 of that was for our drinks.

First of all, there were tons of open tables but we got seated next to a table of about 20 rowdy people. People kept joining the party and people's asses were getting closer and closer to our food as they scooted by our table. One woman obliviously checked her cell phone for a couple of minutes literally while her ass was in our guacamole-truly astounding... At one point, we even saw a guy throw a plate on the ground to clear room for other food/people. What the hell is this....Chi Chi's?  Not all of this is the restaurants fault but failing to deal with the situation is-which is exactly what happened. The worst part of this whole thing is that the manager came over and when he asked how things were, I told him that these hillbillys next to us were throwing plates on the ground and being generally annoying. He didn't do anything about it...just let the plates sit there and said he was sorry about the situation. Didn't move us to one of the many open tables, nothing...Unreal. Another thing within the restaurants control, the food, is also nothing to write home about for what you pay for. Bottom line is that I could have gone to Taco Bell, spent $5, and been much happier than after this ""fine dining experience""...and I hate Taco Bell.

2008-01-19,4.0,"For those confused about being lured in by the promise of modern, upscale mexican might be disapointed.  I think it's pretty clear from their signage and website, however, as a tacqueria that they are not attempting to be something that they are not. I didn't mind the dim lighting of the restaurant--for me, it made the environment kind of fun and like a special occassion. I wouldn't enjoy dim lighting all the time but since the food is simple and the menu is straightforward, I didn't mind it. We made reservations the same day for two and were seated immediately. We even lucked out with a metered spot on halsted nearby... what are the odds? The seating and tables were pretty ulitarian, but if it's a modern taqueria, I get what they are going for.  Plus, if seats were plush and larger, it would probably mean a longer wait because there would be less seating, so I didn't mind.  On this particular night it was extremely cold and the one door of the place had no interior vestibule so everytime the door opened my nasal hair froze.  Since the space is so small, it was hard NOT to be near the door, if you know what I mean. I am not a big fan of mexican, but my date was and he always goes where I want to so I treated him to the dinner out.  The margaritas were great. I tried the mango first and the original second. Both were great--perfect balance of booze and mixers and the perfect compliment to the sometimes spicey fair. I think it would be silly to come here and not order the taco platter--I mean, it's what they are known for and it's the perfect mix and amount of food for two guys or a guy and a girl with some leftovers.  We started with some chips and guac--mind you I don't like guac, but again, I am keeping an open mind and trying to eat more food I don't like.  and it was GREAT.  Not alot of extra stuff in it that probably is the reason I don't like guacomole.  Like it actually tasted like seasoned avacodo instead of something mayonaised out of existence. Back to the taco platter, we got two fried shrimp tacos (by far my favorite) tuna tacos, skirt steak something or rather... and I loved the opportunity to be able to try a little of everything and not like you're ""just ordering the tacos"" and therefore jipping the server out of a great tip, etc. The tuna wasn't that great BUT, I am kind of quirky when it comes to how fish is served, so that might just be me. What I loved the most about the restaurant was how the server was expeditious but didn't make us feel rushed at all. With how busy it was and how many people were waiting, they could've easily rushed us between courses and dropped the check on the table with the whole, ""I'll take this whenever you are ready."" After we were done with our meal, my date was still picking at the crumbs of the chips and our server brought a whole new basket of chips-- after we signed the check and were finishing drinks.  It was a nice breath of fresh air to not just feel like you're taking up someone's seat. I am sure the person after us would've liked us to leave, but I think they'd change their tune when it was their turn to enjoy chips after signing the check! Overall, great if you are not a huge fan of the overally sauced mexican that I am used to. This seemed fresh and probably falsely healthy but didn't leave me feeling overstuffed and gross. It is pricey when compared to maybe a corner or chain mexican place, but I think you are paying for better ingredients, service, and locale.  I wouldn't go once a week, but it was something fun and festive for a special night out.",0.999,0.769,0.191,0.039,0.5265922209104027

2007-09-28,3.0,"When I saw De Cero advertised as ""Nuevo Latino"", I was expecting a menu filled with semi-elegant latin entrees ala Salpicon, but really it would be more accurately described as an upscale taqueria, offering interesting variations on basic, familiar Mexican dishes. The atmosphere of their dining space was dark & noisy, which I guess is pretty much ""standard"" for any restaurant that wants to be considered hip & upscale on this stretch of Randolph St.  I wasn't crazy about the table setup we had, we were given two smallish 2-person tables pushed together, each table was supported by legs at each of the four corners, which resulted in a rather confining, uncomfortable feeling in terms of legroom. Tables with a single middle support would have offered more stretching room. On to the food - a must-try appetizer is the duck nachos.  The dish isn't very large for the price, but it was one of the yummiest things I've tasted in recent memory.  They have a small handful of big-plate entrees, but the star item of their menu is definitely the soft-shell tacos, they offer about 15 varieties and you can order them ala cart or as part of a combo (8 for $29 I believe).  I sampled the catfish, chicken mole, and chorizo tacos, all were good but each was very heavily spiced, not a bad taste but the spice tended to overwhelm the basic flavor of the underlying meat or fish.  I was surprised to see other reviewers raving abot the guacamole, it was definitely among the least flavorful guacamole I've had in recent memory, and seemed downright bland compared to all the other dishes we tried. For dessert we tried the flan, it was very dense & not terribly sweet, a bit different from the flans to which I've become accustomed.  Also tried the white chocolate brownie, which was very good but served with a scoop of chocolate chip ice cream which was so gigantic vs. the size of the brownie that it seemed to overpower the taste of the brownie.  More brownie & less ice cream would have made this dish just about perfect. Service was a mixed bag, our server was definitely very nice & attentive & helpful.  While we were waiting we witnessed the manager asking a couple who had already settled in their table to move so their place could be used to accomodate a larger party.  I consider that to be unacceptable & would have been pretty pissed if that had happened to our party. In summary, there are a few things that De Cero could improve upon in terms of flavor & atmosphere, but I might come back again soon to fill up on some more of them delicious duck nachos.",0.997,0.785,0.174,0.04,0.49902857142857143

Tres Queso (like yummy grilled cheese in a tortilla) Salmon (refreshing with tomatoes) Catfish (served with slaw) Veg black bean (bean/avocado/creamy goodness) What I love about their tacos is that they are gourmet and not at all traditional.  Each combination is very thoughtful and flavorful, but not overwhelming (think about just three ingredients that harmonize very well together). Definitely order a side of the Mexican slaw (not creamy); it has lots of carrots, some jalapeno, jicama (I think), and just a little bit of sweetness - perhaps honey?  It makes a nice palette cleanser in between tacos.  And ordering margaritas is a given.  Oh, I almost forgot about the chips/salsa/guac: woot!     Also, I happen to love the ambiance... its very industrial chic.  Expect blank walls painted in vibrant colors, and a ceiling exposing beautiful rafters.  While I wouldn't exactly call the seating comfortable, it is quite rustic and fits in perfectly with the decor.",0.9983,0.667,0.324,0.009,0.5344827586206897

The food is a creative take on how else you can prepare a taco.  You can order a plate of 8 for $28 where you can mix and match from a choice of about 20.   My table had no favorites amongst the group we ordered, and there where no duds to speak of either.  Word of warning though, be prepared for a little spice with some choices. I don't now what they did differently, but the biggest hit was the guacamole, which is a staple of every Mexican restaurant.  I don't know what was done to it differently, but it was good.  Try it. As for the service, I can't get over making reservations and then showing up on time to wait an additional 20 minutes to get a table.  I don't get why you make them if you can't get seated at that time especially on a Thursday night.  A 5 minute wait is tolerable, but it's unacceptable at 20 minutes.  In fact, that's enough to makes me not go back as there because there are nearly 20,000 other restaurants to choose from that can do this simple task.

But in general if ""creative"" is what they're going for I think they probably miss that mark.

We shared guacamole, which was the tastiest I've had in quite a while.  Usually ordering tacos at a Mexican restaurant is my stand-by, but De Cero's menu makes tacos the center of attention. Although they recommend ordering 3 to 4 tacos per person, I couldn't finish any of them - they were filled to the top of the tortilla. I made sure to try at least a few bites of each for yelping purposes :) I had (in order from so-so to best) chorizo, skirt steak, al pastor and ahi tuna with mango jabanero salsa-YUM!  Ambiance is important to me...I digest better if my surroundings are appealing. De Cero serves some of the best Mexican I've had in Chicago. BUT, the food provides the only interesting color in the dirt brown dining room. Without the colorful dishes there would be nothing interesting about the place. It almost feels like a converted fast food joint - just a bunch of tables in front of a counter with a window looking into the kitchen. For that reason, I give 4 stars.
