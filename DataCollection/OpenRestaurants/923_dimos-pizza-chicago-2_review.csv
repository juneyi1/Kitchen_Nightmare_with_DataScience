2017-08-21,2.0,"I was looking forward to trying this place out after watching a video on social media on their chicken and waffle pizza. My boyfriend and I went here before the Backstreet Boys/Florida Georgia Line concert at Wrigley so we wanted to check out the pizza while we were in the area. We went here on a Friday afternoon and it was crowded. There's limited seating so keep an eye out for a seat or take it to-go. There's like window seating, one giant table in the middle where you sit with other people and like two booths. Luckily, my boyfriend snagged us a booth otherwise we would've been sitting on the floor. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and Chicken Parmesan Pizza (breaded chicken, penne, mozzarella, parmesan, asiago, and parsley). My boyfriend ordered the Breakfast of Champions (scrambled eggs, chorizo, green onions, and spicy mayo) and the Margherita. For $4.50 a slice, the pizza better be good. The Chicken Parmesan Pizza was the best one out of all the pizzas that we ordered but the overall the pizza just fell flat. Literally. The crust was so thin that the toppings fell off and it was messy. Overall, the pizza was average and way too overhyped. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again when there's so many great pizza places in Chicago.",0.9289,0.891,0.088,0.02,0.4974025974025974

I understand management isn't always able to predict events .. such as market days and a huge concert at Wrigley that have been scheduled for months. What I get upset about is I called 2 hours earlier to put in a to go order. When a mac n cheese pizza was taken out of the oven I was told it was a to go order. Weird I tried to do this two hours earlier?? As a former citizen of Chicago and someone who was in from California I am disgusted at whoever is managing this pizzeria now. In addition to all of this the employees try to pick a fight. Wow great customer service. I will no longer recommend this place to all my customers who frequent Chicago.

I recently watched What The Health, which has freaked me out into at least attempting to eat more plant based. Enter the first week of my attempt and I'm jonesing for some pizza. After some quick googling, I learn dimos, whose wrigleyville location is not more than 10 minutes walk from me, carries a vegan cheesy bread in addition to several vegan pizzas. I placed an online pickup order and their organized email updates made it easy to see when it was ready (it was ready earlier than they expected, which was also awesome). Picking up was easy- I ended up adding 2 slices to go for my boyfriend and the guy who helped me was very nice- he even suggested the (free) vegan ranch to compliment!

So that brings us to Dimo's.  Do you like Hawaiian?  You will die for theirs - pulled pork and fresh pineapple.  Amazing.  But they really shine with some of the more unique gourmet pizzas.  Seafood, duck, mac 'n cheese and a bunch of others.  Dino's has some great stuff.

2016-04-09,5.0,"Are you in the city right now? Will you become hungry in the next hour? And you've never tried Dimo's? ""Yes"", ""yes"", and ""yes""? Then you should stop reading immediately and order yourself a 12"".  But while you are waiting, perhaps you would like to read this pizza epic that I have written while procrastinating studying for the MCAT: I moved to Chicago 4 years ago.  Like many, I assumed the stuffed and deep dish pizzas were what every pie fiend like myself flocked to this city for.  I spent the first three years trying to figure out why.  Out of town guest after guest had me shipping out to Gino's, to Malnati's, to Giordano's, etc. to sample what they'd been instructed was the ""true"" Chicago pie, only to find ourselves slinking into our chairs into a cheesy coma that lingered throughout the afternoon. Oh, life before Dimo's. When my husband and I moved to the North Side earlier this year after so many years in Hyde Park, we ended up spending an evening over at Guthrie's Tavern in Wrigleyville.  Not long into our beers and boardgame, we found ourselves digging through Guthrie's menu can and out popped a name we'd never heard of: Dimo's.  A quick check on Yelp! and it seemed too good to be true.  ""We must try this Mac & Cheese pizza,"" we said, and we did. And it was amazing.  Ooey, gooey, and filled to the brim with various cheeses and noodles to boot.  I learned my First Lesson of Dimo's then which was: One Does Not Skimp on Toppings.  I also learned the Second Lesson which is: One Always Pairs with Good Craft Beer. (Pssst, seriously though, get yourself a Hop Slam and settle in.). One thing people frequently remark about Dimo's is that the wait time is _real_.  To be fair, every delivery person I've seen has been on bike.  If you're ordering delivery, don't expect it to be there before the hour is up.  Most of the time it slides into home juuuuust about exactly around the time they say it will.  Once, though, it took nearly 2 hours, and our 12"" arrived cool to the touch.  Disappointed, I called Dimo's and an employee was quick to apologize, acknowledge their mistake, and said they would add a note to our account that our next pizza would be on them.  The next week, we ordered again, and our complimentary 20""-incher arrived in no less than it could possibly take to make a pizza and deliver it over a mile away.  (This is a city in which your pizza establishment can literally see you from their shop window and won't make it to you in less than 45 minutes.)  The delivery person said, as he handed over the pie, ""I believe this is all taken care of"" and was surprised when we insisted on a tip.  The fact that we spoke up and were heard made a real impression.  This is the stuff of 5-stars. The Third (and, for now, Last) Lesson of Dimo's: One Makes Up for One's Mistakes. The only thing left to do in this review is to mention all the pizzas we've tried, since when I order Dimo's, the only question is: which one? We tried a slice of the S'mores pizza as an add-on dessert the first time around, you know, with The Mac. And it was good! But I've never been tempted to order it again, despite my weird childish love of s'mores. I say get it once then see if you want it again.  I will say one thing: it is decadent. I've only tried one of their monthly pizzas, and that was just last night.  The 2016 April pizza: the Desi Arnaz.  Yep, a cuban sandwich pizza. If you love cubans, you will love this pizza. White base, cheese upon cheese, generous chunks of lechon asado, ham, pickles, and mustard.  I feel like if I had to levy one critique that I would say that there was too much mustard. So if you're reading this and it's April, and you like cubans, consider ordering the Desi...maybe ask them to go light on the mustard.  For me, the Desi takes 4th place at Dimo's yet still is better than any other pizza in Chicago. So far, it's my husband's favorite.  So there's that.   Third Place so far goes to that glorious ""The Mac"". No other words.  This was the gateway drug.  Go, go now, go order yourself a Mac, even if you are vegan, because they've got a special one for you, too.   Second Place: Chicken n' Waffles. I love fried chicken. I love waffles.  I love chicken & waffles. I love pizza.  If this sounds like you, let's get you a CNW stat. Now, it is sweet, so if you're going to order a pizza and be disappointed that it isn't savory, save this for another time. Maybe brunch? First Place will always and forever, I think, go to: The Buff Chick.  The most visually impressive so far and stunningly explosive taste-wise, this takes the Dimo's cake.  That is to say: this is the best pizza I have ever tasted.  You know how I said somewhere above how impressively generous they were with mac and cheese?  I can't even tell you how many chunks of fried chicken there were on this monster (aside: monster is an appropriate characterization of a 20"" pizza). I subbed more ranch for the blue. To quote Coldplay, ""I saw sparks.""",0.9982,0.853,0.121,0.025,0.5390315676832533

The pros: I will say that the wide variety of choices and creative concoctions give them an extra star. From tomato feta, to Bbq chicken, to Mac and frickin' cheese!  The line also moves pretty fast and there's a decent sized sitting area, opposed to many other pizza places. The cons: the dough is thicker than I like, and the pizza itself isn't the best of the best. Like I said above, the topping options are what equals it out.  It also can get pretty wild at night because of all the drunk college kids leaving the bars.

We got the 20 in pepperoni pizza with a side of crushed peppers; it arrived in the time window GrubHub alotted. It was delivered by bike, so it wasn't hot, but the delivery driver was extremely kind so it wasn't seen as too much of a negative..until my friend and I tried it.  While massively joyous on the size and mass of the pizza, we were just as equally massively disappointed with the taste. The flavor was akin to some weird chemical taste (I coined it as Pinesol, my friend said it was topsoil). Thinking it might've been made with a pan still wet with sanitizer (a place with that high of reviews, it had to be a fluke), we called in about the order. The very kind woman on the phone apologized and offered us a refund or a new pizza - we went with new pizza, because mistakes happen even at 5 star places, right? She said our order is going to the front, and it'd be there in 20 minutes. Awesome!..or so we thought. An hour passes, and we call again to ask for a straight out refund. A different person answers the call, says the pizza is arriving in five minutes, and we concede to waiting. It does arrive in the five minutes, with the same delivery guy as before - even in the frigid and snowing cold, he was extremely apologetic and kind (Dwayne 'NotTheRock' Johnson, you da man).  We eat the new pizza..same chemical taste. We call back immediately; the girl who picked up the first time we called answers. We explain how pumped we were to try the five star pizza, but we were just not pleased with how it tastes. She gave us a refund with profuse apologies, no hassle. They also gave us two free brownies in the box with the new pizza - they were bloody *amazing*. I would order just the brownies from this place. The customer service is why I'm giving this place three stars.

They have crazy huge slices of pizza and mostly wild flavors. We got chicken penne pizza, buffalo chicken ranch, and chicken and waffle. They were all amazing. They rotate flavors through so find something you think sounds good and get one. One slice alone was probably not quite enough for me, but the two of us split three, which was the perfect amount. If you're in the area, I highly recommend stopping by. On top of being delicious, it's surprisingly cheap.

I was told it would be 10-12 minutes. After 15, I inquired. The pizza was being pulled from the oven, so I thought I was all set, except that my other slices hadn't even been warmed up yet.

Because of: 1.  Some of the best pizza around.  Consistently top-notch, every single time.  Outstanding crust, quality toppings, and excellent balance between all four elements. 2.  Variety of toppings.  Yes, I have ridiculed the concept of macaroni and cheese pizza.  But I have also devoured many a Philly steak slice.  The beauty of Dimo's is that you can always rely on the simple slices (e.g. pepperoni & mushroom or mushroom, spinach, & red pepper) but yet be intrigued by the fancy ones.  Sometimes the fancy ones are a home run, sometimes they are not for me, but in any case I appreciate their creativity.  For example, recently I tried a slice with red onions, kale, fennel, parmesan, and lemon vinaigrette...delicious.  But the weekly special--figs, bacon, arugula, honey, and bleu cheese--sounds too sweet to me.  Either way there is always a delightful element of surprise to every visit. Tamale pizza?  Chicago-style hot dog pizza?  Irish breakfast pizza?  Brilliant. 3.  Awesome people.  All the staff are very friendly, always.  Genuine enthusiasm. 4.  The loyalty/rewards card.  This concept goes a long way with me.  Buy ten and get one free!  A superb incentive for return business.  ""The Dimo's punch card--don't leave home without it.""

The topping combos range from the basics like pepperoni and mushroom all the way up to the outrageous like fried chicken and waffle (which by the way is so good I wept openly first time I ate it). To go with you pie are also some nice salad options and at $7 for the large (feeds 2-3) are quite reasonable. Of course you may not want to eat salads as the large pie is big enough for 4 people.  I think it's like 0 inches big or something.

He swept up the pieces and offered a credit. Thank you and no worries, everyone has an off night... or in this case a REALLY off night: 2) Pizza time! Womp, both sides of ranch and marinara(or so I thought, see #3) that I ordered were busted open and spilling into the boxes. Ok, that happens, they deliver on bicycles, disappointing but still edible. 3) Ordered a side of marinara and got Frank's red hot sauce. Didn't figure the switch until I took a big bite of it. Quite the awful surprise, especially for a person who doesn't like anything spicy. (Starting to heat up and not because of the hot sauce...) 4) Called GrubHub to complain, they then called and I was notified that I was only going to receive a credit for the Leninade and that I needed to personally speak with someone at Dimo's. Ok, will do. 5) Called Dimo's. Hold music for 10 minutes. UGH. Someone FINALLY answers and informs me that there isn't a manager there that I can speak with. Umm, what? I work in the food industry, how do you not have someone in charge that I can speak with?

Dimo's is kind of a dumpy looking place, but I think that's the ambiance they want to portray. Their menu is really fantastic - lots of variety in pizzas. But, we went on a Sunday, and they don't make vegan slices on Sundays. But, you may order a pizza to order, so I did. My daughter selected it (she is the decider) and picked the Dimo Florentine. Their oven must be very hot because I want to say it was ready in about 10 minutes. First the good - the crust was really fantastic. And, the marinara sauce they use was alsio very tasty, But I have to say that, honestly I was a little disappointed in the pizza itself. Oh, the toppings were good. But I was expecting to have it be more like a real pizza. The ""cheese"" they use was kind of tasteless and they didn't put very much on the pizza. I meant to ask what brand of vegan cheese they use but forgot to before I left. A couple of other good things to say. (1) The service is really good. The people who work there are friendly and kind. They want to help and are good at explaining the items on the menu. (2) They have a very interesting selection of soft drinks. I stuck with water, but my son got something called ""Leninade"". Leninade is a pink lemonade in an old soviet looking bottle. Kind of fun. Other than that, the experience was a good one. Vegan cheese is one of those things. Some are okay and others are bad. I've never really had a good one. But, it is nice that Dimo's offers it as an option for those of us who either prefer vegan or don't do milk/cheese.

But almost as importantly, they also have competent and helpful service -- which is crucial when you're hungry and trying to use modern technology to get people to cook and deliver you a pizza.  They were out of an ingredient, and tried at least five times in 30 minutes to reach me by telephone, leaving several voicemails explaining that they were making a substitution that they hoped I'd like, but encouraging me to call them back in case that wasn't what I wanted.  And while I did call them back, they'd made the right decisions in my absence.  How often can you say of a pizza place that you were impressed with their judgment and professionalism?

2014-05-01,4.0,"I have a theory: food you steal from other people always tastes better than your own. In fact, it's probably true that other peoples' food always smells better than whatever you decided to eat anyway. Thank goodness for that because I would've never tried Dimo's unless I was stealing bites from my roommates.  I've never ordered a slice from here, true, but I've been here more than once and have tried a couple of flavors, both savory and sweet. Luckily, my drunk roommates always over order and sometimes there is more than a slice left waiting for me.  The flavor combinations here are really inventive and sometimes borderline off putting (they squeezed how much of that white mystery sauce all over the pizza?), but I've liked every single one I've tried. I've had the Mac option, a s'mores option, a BBQ option, and an enchilada option. This is one of the few times when I will go against my Italian nature and say simpler isn't better here. In fact, if you go in and order the most trashed up slice of pizza you can find, it'll probably be the best one.  This is drunk college student paradise, however. It loses a star only because at a certain time (that time being about 8-1 on any given night) there are a lot of drunk people you need to wait behind, so patience is key. However, the staff here are super friendly and chat with everyone. I've never seen them try to pull a fast one on a drunkie, either, which is comforting.  I think next time I stop in I might actually order a slice of pizza. Hope it tastes as good as all the stolen bites I've taken. Probably not.",0.9911,0.739,0.189,0.072,0.518639455782313

We really enjoyed the unique flavor experience. This time the crust was much softer. It definitely must have been burnt/overcooked last time. What truly shines to me is their customer service. They were extremely friendly and apologetic about the whole situation. And even after reimbursing us for our original purchase, and giving us a credit, they gave us another two coupons for a free slice. They truly care about their customers, and that goes a long way with me. I will definitely be ordering from them again. Thank you, Dimo's! UPDATE: Dimo's actually contacted me via yelp to apologize for the bad pizza. They reimbursed us, and offered to give us another order on the house if we'd like to try them again. I am shocked and extremely pleased at the amazing customer service. So I added a star for that. I will update my review again once we re-try their pizza. Thank you, Dimo's! A group of my friends and I just ordered two huge pizzas from here, and there is literally almost a whole pizza left. We each had a piece and couldn't even finish it. The crust honestly tastes like cardboard, and there is barely any cheese or sauce on it. I've included a photo of our leftovers that no one will touch.

2013-09-06,4.0,"I ordered a delivery pizza from Dimo's on Saturday night and now -- a week later -- the roof of my mouth is still healing from the sear of their ultra hot pizza cheese.  I realize that burnt mouths from hot pizza are no new feat, BUT burnt mouths from a delivery pizza? That's kind of a big deal. Obvi, fresh and clearly they raced through traffic to get it to me likety split, so it was the perfect, piping hot temperature to melt my uvula off at first bite.   Some friends and I were actually at Headquarters Barcade saying our farewells to my best friend who's moving to California and were in dire need of pizza. I wanted to buy for the group, but also not burn my wallet and Dimo's was perfect! I got two giant 20"" cheese pizzas for $35+tip. The delivery arrived at exactly the time they said it would and the driver was super nice... I think because I was already waiting outside so he wouldn't have to fight through the crowd at the extremely crowded barcade.  Dimo's wasn't actually my first choice, and I had many options as Jet's was originally suggested by the bar but to be honest, the pizza this other table nearby ordered from Jet's looked pretty nurst, though they did give us some coupons. I opted to forgo the Jet's coupons the barcade gave actually handed me their house iPad to look through their GrubHub account for delivery options, but to be honest, I kind of really dislike GrubHub and don't understand why people use it to order instead of just calling the business directly since GrubHub takes a cut of the businesses profits when you order through them or use the phone number listed for that business on the GrubHub site, so I opted to chance it on my phone and hope that whereever I called would deliver to my area... also, I had no idea how to work the iPad they gave me to even cruise the GrubHub site, so that may have also played a role in my decision.  I'd originally decided on Pequod's, which is pretty much always spectacular... only the delivery time for them was over 2 hours and it was already late and I've been sick, and  I was hungry since yesterday, so no. Just nothing working in my favor with that one. But then I came across Dimo's on Yelp, they had great reviews and delivered to the bar I was at, hereby fitting all my criteria. Done!  Dimo's was super friendly on the phone, it was easy to hear them clearly, and turns out, their pizza is super cheap. So I got those two 20"" cheese pizzas for $35+tip and they came in those giant ass triangle slices so it's not the greatest to share with a lot of people, but we didn't have an enormous group, so it was fine for us. So apparently the big triangle shape + crust + greasiness is New York style, or so I was told. I didn't think the pizza was greasy at all, but my boo is kind of crazy about eating healthy so of course pizza causes his stomach to have a bit of a conniption, but he lived and this pizza was my saving grace as far as sustenance goes. It was definitely really salty, but hit the spot. I guess Dimo's is know for kind of cray pizza concoctions, but i didn't know that and I was on a budget so I just got cheese, but it might be tastier if you get actual toppings or combos.  I don't often find myself in this area with having not already eaten, but if I'm ever in the same predicament again, I'll definitely give Dimo's a ring-a-ding-ding.",0.9976,0.795,0.158,0.047,0.6077887166596843

2013-08-08,5.0,"Hands down in the top 3 for best pizza I've ever had. Probably top on the list for best pizza I've ever eaten after drinking too much. You know, the kind of pizza you want when you've had a few too many beers and it's still early enough that you don't have to go to taco bell. When you really just want a piece of pizza topped with mac and cheese, philly cheese steak, or chicken fingers. Or when that sweet tooth just won't leave you alone and you're just tipsy enough to eat a slice covered in marshmallows, chocolate chips, and teddy grahams. This is where you go to get all of the above. I prefer a good slice of thin crust pizza to any other style of crust, and they do it perfect here. It's ordered by the slice from a pre-made pizza, which can be a risk at some places, but after they put it in the oven for a few minutes, the toppings are hot, the cheese is melted, and the crust is crispy like it just came out freshly made. The choices I listed above are just a small sampling of the crazy combinations that they have available. I got a chicken penne alfredo pizza and it was delicious. I was a little unsure about pasta on top of pizza, but mine was great, my friends tortellini pizza was excellent, and their mac and cheese with homemade crème fraiche appeared to be one of their most popular. I also got to try the s'mores pizza, which had enough sugar to give an elephant diabetes, but if sweet is your thing; this one is definitely worth trying. I would give this place at minimum 4 stars for their food alone, but what put it over the top are the fantastic people working there. I don't think I could work in a pizza place serving drunk people all day and night and even pretend to provide good customer service. These people do it and genuinely have a blast, which just spreads through the whole place. They are really nice and were more than happy to explain everything that was on each of their odd creations. We even got to see some singing and dancing while enjoying our pizza (although I'd recommend sticking to your day jobs :). The service is fast, the food is delicious, and the staff is awesome.

We had two employees come up to us who were just about to start their shift. One who mentioned that the Greek Spanikopita style pizza was delicious and the other seeing our hesitance, offered a free slice to us. I did not think she actually meant this - was just a way to get us to come in. We decided to anyway and low and behold, we only paid for one slice.

2013-05-22,3.0,"I have come to realize the Mid West doesn't know what good pizza really is. I have tried many pizza shops and it's very very hard to find high quality pizza.  Thought I would try this place since I read it was similar to NYC type pizza (which is based off of pizza from Naples Italy). No. It's not. I would categorize this type of pizza as American pizza. It is similar in texture to the fast food chains like Papa John's and Sarpino's.  I would say it is a grade above the fast food pizza but not like the high quality Naples style pizza from the wood fired brick ovens. It reminds me of Papa Ray's pizza which has a couple shops in Chicago. It is heavy and will leave you feeling very stuffed whereas Naples style is very light and fresh with distinct flavorful ingredients like basil. You can eat half the pie and not feel heavy or like you just clogged your arteries.  Service...well I ordered delivery and after 70 minutes I called to ask where was my pizza. They said another 30. I didn't believe it so I took a $20 cab ride round trip to get it. I had to wait another 10 minutes while I was there. There was a game on so the place was busy. The staff was very friendly and gave me free slice coupons for my trouble. They were very busy and I can relate. I just wish they told me it was going to be a 2 hour wait so I would have ordered on a day that was less busy. Taking a cab to pick up a pizza is expensive. The whole ordeal cost me $50 I ordered their large pie and it was huge. The taste was ok. But not what I was expecting. If you want something similar to Papa John's or Papa Ray's but a step above, then Dimo's is great. If you want NYC style pizza then this is not it.",0.9836,0.833,0.125,0.042,0.4336776061776062

I never heard of Dimo's until the CM Punk Best in the World premiere when CM Punk ordered Dimo's pizza for hundreds of fans waiting to see the premiere of his dvd. It was delicious and I knew I had to go back for more. I've had Dimos since then on two separate occasions, only because going to Wrigleyville can sometimes be a pain. I love Dimos, for 5 bucks you get a huge (not Bacci's huge, but still big) slice with a pop and it's a gourmet pizza. You can take it to go, or sit in and talk to your friends about how delicious it is without anyone bothering you. The only set back is that there's no cards or menu telling you what is what and what is on what and I'll be disappointed when a slice looks delicious but it has something I'm allergic to on it so it would be nice if there were some ingredients listed, but that's just me I guess. Plus, I feel bad asking when I'm sure the employees probably repeat it time and time again. Anyways, I love it and according to their FB they are opening a new location in Spring down in Wicker Park, much closer to me so I will be there raving about how delicious they are, so much more.

2012-10-01,4.0,"Attention Chicago. This is what a thin crust pizza is supposed to look like and taste like! As a native New Yorker, few things annoy me more than a ""thin crust"" pizza where the crust is thinner than a cracker, the toppings are buried under the cheese, and the pie is cut into 16 little tiny squares. It's a sacrilege. So I definitely appreciate Dimo's with their large, filling slices and creative toppings.  My first selection was a slice of spinach/roasted peppers/tomatoes. The proportions were pretty balanced, with a good amount of veggies and cheese to crust. The veggies tasted very fresh, not overdone, and I liked the crunch of the crust. I do wish the outer crust had been a little thicker, just so I could chew it a little bit more. Also, I tend to like a saucier pizza, but there was just enough where it didn't taste like just a flatbread.  My second choice was a slice chicken parmesan pizza. This was tremendous. It had bits of seasoned fried chicken along with a little parsley and parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. I would order this one again. I got a large glass bottle of Coke and I only paid $10. That's pretty much a steal for downtown. Not only that, but the guys behind the counter are very approachable. They explained some of the different slices I had questions about and were even open to hearing my feedback about some different topping ideas like adding an olive oil base option. Definitely a place to check out in Wrigleyville. And I hear I should check out a slice of mac and cheese...",0.9693,0.834,0.131,0.035,0.6064479380268853

We ordered 4 different slices so that we could try the various styles. They have more than four, but we are, after all, only two people. The macaroni-n-cheese slice was surprisingly good. I wasn't sure how I would feel about this particular carb-fest, but I'm a fan. The bottom of the pizza stayed nice and crispy, and the top was covered in a sauce, possibly bechamel, and elbow macaroni with at least two types of cheese. We both liked this one. The mushroom-penne-Alfredo slice was comparable. The mushrooms were abundant, the Alfredo sauce was good, and the penne, though fewer than the macaroni on the prior slice, was still sufficient. They have a pizza that is like mashed potatoes or small potatoes or something smothered with cheese. It is fantastic! Just to compare we also ordered a plain cheese and a pepperoni. Both were good. They were greasier than the other two, so the bottom of the pizza was not as crispy. So to eat this one you had to do the New York thing and fold the slice in half. Greasy equals soggier bottom but still tasty. Real plus is here is that Dimo's is BYOB! Also, they deliver in the neighborhood.

Don't come here looking for deep dish or Chicago style pizza. This is where you get the most bad-ass pizza around. Of course my favorite (like everyone's) is the Mac'n'Cheese, but there are so many unique kinds you just have to try them all.  Last wknd I was fortunate enough to run into some drunk guys who bought my girl friend and I 1 slice of every kind of pizza there was (resulting in close to 15 slices). Needless to say, i was not disappointed with a single slice! Yes, there will be downfalls (like the pesto tortellini), but just getting to try the ever changing rotation makes up for it. Regardless if you like pizza or not, you have to try this place AT LEAST 3 times to get the real sense of why this place is so awesome.

2012-02-05,4.0,"Ian's pizza: good when you're sober, best thing you've ever eaten EVER when you're drunk. Once the bars have closed, you can definitely expect a long line at Ian's, but that's also how you know it's good.  When you place your order, they throw the slices in to be heated up pretty quickly, so the wait is manageable.  They're so used to having a ton of people stampede the place at 2:02am that the people working are never completely flustered.  Of all the pizzas I've eaten here, the mac and cheese pizza is the winner hands down.  And they have sauces in which to dip your pizza if you ask, because if you're like me you just want ranch on everything when you're drunk. One night, I found myself drunk and alone in Wrigleyville at 1am on a Wednesday.  Clearly it was a weird night.  On my way to the el, I stopped by Ian's which was nearly empty.  Looking at the pizzas behind the case, the pizza with steak, barbecue sauce and fries caught my eye.  I point at it and say, ""I want that one.""  Guy behind the counter: ""How many slices?""  Me: ""The whole thing."" So he throws it in the oven.  When it's ready he pulls out each slice and places each on an individual plate in a humongous box .  Why?! But I was too drunk to protest.  When I got home, I ran upstairs to see my roommate. I tried to walk into her room, and the box literally was wider than the door.  It just made zero sense, but I still love Ian's. There is such a thing as Ian's Customer of the Year.  I only know of this because a friend's boss's roommate was given this prestigious title in the past.  I'm sure you have to go to Ian's almost everyday if you want to be a serious contender.  Good luck.",0.9842,0.767,0.157,0.076,0.5961805555555557

2012-01-17,1.0,"I never knew that pizza could make you angry... until I ate at Ian's. While this flavorless, dried out pizza did not rouse my taste buds, it did stir my viscera with rage and make me see red. Why so angry? This was the worst pizza I've ever tasted, and I'd just dumped $24 + a generous tip on it. I'm no stranger to bad pizza. I grew up in southwest Ohio, where the pizza scene of the 80's and 90's was a very bleak thing indeed. I've tasted some crappy, chewy, dry, undercooked, overcooked, uninspired, unappealing, disgusting bad pizza, so allow me to reiterate: The Ian's Pizza I had last night was the worst pizza I've ever tasted. The guys working were very sweet, very friendly, and helpful when I had questions placing my order. However, perhaps they should have encouraged me to order one of their specialty pizzas because maybe that's all that Ian's really does well, or even just moderately well. Instead, I ordered for take-out a large soy mozzarella pizza with portobello mushrooms, onion and bell pepper. Let's cover the pizza from top to bottom: PEPPERS AND ONION: Usually, when I order these toppings, the peppers and onion soften ever so slightly in the oven, arriving in a fresh and palatably less sharp and crunchy taste and texture. On Ian's Pizza, the onions and peppers were completely raw, so much so I might have thought they were added *after* the pizza went in the oven. SOY CHEESE: Where's the cheese?! While it's true soy cheese doesn't melt well, it helps the dairy free customer's cause when you use more than a tiny child-sized handful of cheese to sprinkle over the pizza. The amount of cheese on the pizza was abysmal. Our cheese looked skimpy compared to what I saw searching online for images of Ian's pizza. (See the photo I posted of ours.) It was flavorless soy cheese too, and as Cristene mentioned, Daiya might be a better option. I guess we'd have to order extra-extra-extra cheese to at least cover more of the pizza, or it also might have been more palatable if we had more: TOMATO SAUCE: Again, so little to speak of and flavorless. Absolutely flavorless! Parts of the pizza had none, all of it was dried out.  If my options are less flavorless sauce and more dried out pizza or more flavorless sauce and less dried out pizza, I am in a quandary of questionable dining... though I would probably opt for more sauce in the end. Since the pizza was both so dry and so flavorless, we gave up after eating one slice, went back to the box and added olive oil and spices to the pizza before tossing it in the oven in hopes of resuscitating it. It was slightly better. The MUSHROOMS were fine. I don't know, y'all. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe it was an off-night. Maybe you have to order one of those specialty pizzas. Maybe you have to be wasted after a Cubs game. Maybe you have to order a non-vegan pizza. In the light of day, anger fades and I am left totally baffled. I had been looking forward to trying Ian's for so long and surprising my dairy-free boyfriend with a great pizza and movie night at home. Instead, he wound up upset that I had spent money on this terrible excuse for pizza. In fact, he asked me to go to you Yelpers directly. ""You have to warn them,"" he said. I promised I would, so here we are. Skip Ian's. Go somewhere--anywhere--else.",0.6981,0.817,0.1,0.083,0.5138734854888699

So, why isn't this a pizza place? What you order looks like pizza. It comes in pizza slice shapes. It has a pizza crust. It's made much like a pizza. You may even see a guy spinning dough on his hands just like a pizza would be. However, the creations here are more different foods served on pizza backing, and I'm in love with the heart and soul it all. The dough and the crust are absolutely fantastic.

Yes there will be line when you go but it moves fast and there is more than enough entertainment from the drunk people to make the wait go by quickly.

I'd had Ian's at various functions many times, but I hadn't had the opportunity to go to the storefront. It's a bit intimidating. You walk in. There's a bunch of people milling about. There are a bunch of folks working behind the counter. There are a LOT of pizzas sitting atop the counter. There's no menu. If you can't discern what's what, you have to ask someone behind the counter about each and every one of the pizzas. I can't imagine that's fun for either the employee or the customer. I know pizzas change and spontaneity is a virtue of the business model. But, after the fourth or so, ""Wait. What was that? Repeat, please.,"" I bet a menu board with descriptions starts to sound really good. So, awkwardness of the ordering process out of the way, where else in the city can you get a large slice of buffalo chicken and black bean (I may be making that up) pizza at 2 in the morning? Ian's fills a large hole in the city and I'm glad it exists. The flavors are unusual and even when it doesn't work well (just say 'no' to lasagna pizza), I appreciate the innovation and risk-taking. It's pretty easy to get overwhelmed by all the available choices, so I'd recommend coming in with an idea of the flavor profile you'd most want to try and a variation off a standard choice. This way, you'll be sure to get something you like (a pepperoni variant, for example) and you'll know when to stop when the menu recitation gets to be too long. A plan, people. Always have a plan.

Yes, it helps to prevent hangovers in the morning but to me, it's the fourth meal of the day that I have been looking forward to all night.  I don't even remember what bar we were in but I found myself walking across the street to Ian's Eatery.

My friends know that there are few things in this world that come between me and food.  I walked in and saw a wide variety of different pizzas with unique toppings; macaroni and cheese, rigatoni pasta, buffalo chicken, and etc. It clicked, Ian's Eatery specializes in specialty pizzas with not your ordinary toppings. I've had my share of creative pizzas from philly cheese steaks to Hawaiian BBQ but I was done with the gimmicks. I settled on a vegetable and goat cheese combination. After taking one bite, I nodded my head to my friends letting them know that I approved. The toppings were fresh and the crust was thin and chewy but still had the crisp from the hot oven. There was the right amount of sauce and cheese ratio for thin crust pizza. I was tempted to get another slice but my friends were already annoyed to sit and watch me eat the first one. Next time, I'll try one of the more creative pizzas.  Yes, any food tastes good after drinking but Ian's Eatery offers something that actually tastes quite good.

It was like two pieces in one.  The pizzas warmed up to need-to-wait-a-minute hotness, which was fine because truth be told, it took me a minute to cut through it with the cornware.  (Cornware is what I call the biodegradable disposable utensils made from corn.  If I am infringing on copyright, I apologize and plead ignorance.)  The pizza definitely had body, the spinach was generous, and the crust was actually pretty great - crunchy, in fact.     In addition to the above-average selection and quality of the pizza, they also carry Gale Gand's root beer.  If you are like me and require a root beer or Dr. Pepper with your pizza, you are in luck.  The bottle has a cute little story of how she created the recipe, and it was a fine root beer to boot.   All told, three slices and two drinks cost about $14, which feels about right.  The seating is nothing to write Yelp about but there are clever little posters around and you can even buy a ""Pizza Slut"" t-shirt if you are so inclined.  I was not inclined but if there ever were a place that would tempt my monogamous loyalty to deep dish, it would be Ian's.  We'll be back.",0.9959,0.784,0.186,0.03,0.4690085377585377

Ian's didn't seem to have this simple formula down when I tried it.  Their macaroni and cheese pizza appears to have the good stuff on top of it, but one bite reveals that it's imposter mac!  It's the kind of macaroni that comes not even in a Kraft box, but in a Kraft single serving stir and eat.  And even then it's the kind that occurs when too much water and it becomes a sticky mess.  If you can't picture that, you're probably a good cook.  But, rest assured, it's a horror show.  They could cover the tasteless, mushy mess up with high quality cheddar cheese, but they lack even that dignity saving measure. Their lasagna pizza came up a little better because the thin layers actually hold up (though the top was burned).  But the tomato sauce just isn't there on this one either.  The rest of the creations seemed equally unique, but I'm not sure if the results were any better. If they were just mad scientist chefs experimenting with cheap pizza slices, their food gone wrong would be excusable.  But they're charging almost $4.00 for a small slice.  So the experiment might as well be a psychological study in disappointment rather than in pizza. And I am definitely a case study in this waiting almost a year to try it.  About the only thing that saved my time here from being a rock bottom experience was that they were playing some skacore overhead.  And no place that does that can be truly abominable.",0.955,0.751,0.159,0.091,0.5322398589065256

The mac 'n' cheese may sound bizarre, but it's a really solid tasty pizza.  TRY IT!  The crust was perfectly crunchy throughout the body of the pizza and the carb-on-carb dynamic of the slice worked surprisingly well.  However, I can't give this pizza five stars bc I couldn't help but think the pizza had an overall undeveloped flavor.  It might be A+ worthy w/ some spice or a more complex cheesy topping (gorgonzola?).   The portobello slice further reduced Ian's rating; soggy body crust topped w/ cheaper tasting ingredients.  Still good and extra points for the feta, but by no means gourmet tasting.   Overall, I would say Ian's is what it is, and it is delicious - it's well priced and offers unusual pizza combinations in a low key atmosphere - but derives much of its yummy-ness from a heavy hand.

I heard down the grapevine that Ian's Pizza in Wrigleyville (of all places!) began serving vegan pizza with local vegan company Chicago Soy Dairy. What was taking me so long to make a stop and try it? Well, most of my friends moan that it's ""probably going to taste weird"" and it wasn't usually served by the slice. Saturday, January 29 changed that. I finally made the decision to stop in and grab a full pizza. We called ahead of time to place our order and picked it up at about 8PM. Of course, the restaurant was slammed with bar crawlers devouring the popular macaroni n' cheese pizza. I was going cruelty free today! We picked up our pizza for a little over $10. It was a tempeh sausage pizza. Wow. I have to say that I was absolutely stunned by the pizza. It was wonderful. Vegan cheese can be an odd ingredient. Chicago Soy Dairy is the best option opposed to Daiya. The ""sausage"" was spicy and almost brought a tear to my as I was blasted my nostalgia of what sausage tasted like. I honestly am counting down the days to when I return. A major surprise and probably the best vegan pizza place to hit in the city. Well done!",0.9765,0.78,0.153,0.067,0.5432151182151184

If you continue reading I'll give a little insight into the cool stuff that you normally don't see, either because you were partying too hard or that you were too focused on all the cool slices. This place is bomb because the people who work there genuinely enjoy going to work.  The staff is part hipster, somewhat up to date on sports happenings, and at night times they are grooving to salsa and merengue.  Despite such a wide variety of interests among the staff, they all participate in making the end experience the best for their customers and community.  At any given time this place is hosting a meetup for the Vegan Chicago community, participating in a food donation at a local shelter, or passing out Pizza Slut/Pimp stickers for Halsted days. I will talk more about the staff and the experience soon, but I want to review the food.  Hands down the best pizza in the Chi.  My top 5 favorites slice are listed in this order: 1) Philly Cheesesteak 2) Spicy Chicken Taco 3) Spinach Feta Pesto 4) Buffalo Chicken Bleu Cheese 5) El Mexicano The staff goes a really good job of monitoring the slices.  If one starts looking anything less than fresh, you can be sure that they are going to make sure it is thrown out.  Not only is the pizza fresh, but it gets to you fast.  The staff is instinctually ready for big crowds to come in at any time, and they have to move quick.  Good for you and I, because that means we are getting our pizza faster.  Don't worry if you are slightly too messed up to remember what you ordered or who you ordered from.  They know exactly who you are and what you ordered, and they will get your attention. I like that they will make you any pizza at anytime, even if you only want a single slice.  If they don't have something you want, just ask, and it will be ready in less than 10 minutes.  Not bad timing considering the pizza has to be made, cooked, cut and served.  However, if it is bar time, this might be a little more difficult.  They most likely have plenty of good options instead and you can ask them for a recommendation. The food is good, the staff is the best, and the prices are pretty damn good.  We should all be grateful for Ian's because it is the only unique food experience in Wrigleyville, and best of all you can get it as late in the night as you want.  Honestly, you're other options are late night T-bell, McD's, or even worse Bacci.  Please don't go there unless you are an inch away from dying of starvation.  Honestly, you will thank me later for that recommendation.   Much love to the Yelpers who give this place the rating it deserves.",0.9981,0.761,0.196,0.043,0.5476997578692495

First up was the El Mexicano (Carne asada, pico de gallo, chips, tomatillo salsa, cheddar).  OMG, I tore through this thing in about a minute and a half but if felt like 30 seconds.  This thing was awesome and I'll definitely be ordering a full pizza of it in the future. Second came the Papa Bandit (BBQ sauce, potato, bacon2, ranch).  Really good but I think the potatos were sliced too thick.  I may have liked the pizza more if maybe the potatos were mashed first.  Still, overall the taste was pretty good.  I only ate about 1/3 of it because I wanted to try the other pizzas. Third was the Spicy Chicken Taco.  Also a very good slice, slightly spicy and good taste.  Ate about 1/3 of it as well and then started getting full.  Since I wanted to save space for that delicious looking brownie I passed up any of the meatlovers pizza but it also looked just as scrumptious.  I'm sure it will taste great when I heat up with the rest of the leftovers tomorrow.  If you're now wondering why I only gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 it's for the simple fact of the outer crust.  It was a bit too chewy/dry for my liking.  I'm a huge crust lover and there ya have it.  I could have used some more sauce closer to the crust.  Or maybe make the outer crust a little butterier.  Who knows.  Otherwise overall the pizzas were great and like I said earlier, I'm definitely ordering the El Mexicano again.

All trips since this realization have been much more pleasant. The last time I went there was incredible. They were giving out samples of three amazing vegan pizzas in preparation for Mercy for Animal's vegan week at the end of October. My boyfriend and I tried all of them and all they asked for was feedback. After samples of three pizzas, I wasn't even hungry for the HUGE ASS pie we'd ordered!

This review is after my second visit.  I ordered a slice of the classic mac & cheese and a slice of the special, the Oktoberfest (fried pork, egg noodles, and mushroom gravy).  Note: two slices are just right for a meal.  Both were great in their own ways and with all the other specialty slices, it's definitely an incentive to return again and again to try everything else.

My husband got the sausage and penne pizza which was really weird and he didn't like it at all, he ended up switching it out for the BBQ steak and fries which as I said before is actually good.  I got the Chicken Parmesan which was terrible.  The chicken was totally dried out and it was just yucky.  When we were waiting for our pizza to get reheated I said to my husband ""Wow! This is taking a lot longer than normal.""  When we got the pizza is was rather overcooked and both of the tops of our mouths were burnt. Lastly, for dessert we got what we came for the peach cobbler pizza.  The flavor was flat and didn't really have any cinnamony or sweet notes it was just blah.  The homemade biscuits that were promised I certainly didn't even noticed and the problem that I had with the last dessert pizza which was only the bottom half of the pizza (aka probably about 1/3 of the actual slice since it's a triangle) is pizza the top is just cooked dough.  The worst part however is there was actual cheese on the pizza.  WTF, this was the most disgusting thing I've ever tried, wow in the world would you put cooked cheese on a dessert?   In summary, go and try the mac & Cheese or BBQ steak and fries but do not under ANY circumstances try any of the odd flavors.",-0.7187,0.876,0.052,0.071,0.49229691876750686

The crab rangoon slice was better in that it had flavor, too bad that flavor was limited to the sweet and sour soaked won ton strips on top.

On 6/29, with family in town and four decent Cubs tickets gifted to me by a company I do business with, I searched Yelp for a place near Wrigley for a quick bite before the game.  Fantastic!  I found Ian's, with more than 230 reviews, and a 4.5 star average.  I knew it wasn't on Chicago Magazine's recent list of Chicagoland's 25 best pizzas, but hey, that writer must have just missed this place. So, our party of 4 got there.  We even had our own 4 top.  Now, full disclosure here - I love very crispy, very thin crust pizzas.  My favorite crusts have their own personalities, and I like plenty of cheese and quality ingredients.  My own favorites list, some of which were also chosen by Chicago Magazine, include Pizano's on State, Lou Malnati's thin, Pizzeria Via Stato, and Candlelite.   And, in fairness to Ian's, I did read many of the reviews describing their crust as ""limp"", could be ""folded"", and ""soft"".  So, I was warned,  I just couldn't imagine that with a 4.5 average on Yelp, I wasn't going to enjoy this soft crust experience.  Wrong! No problem with the atmosphere, which I actually liked.  No problem with the staff, all of whom were extremely helpful and friendly.  But, in the end, it just wasn't my kind of pizza.  I have to say, I thought it was awful. Not just with a limp crust, but a completely flavorless crust, not unlike wet shirt cardboard (and yes, of course I am only imagining what wet shirt cardboard would taste like).  I tasted a companion's mac and cheese, and didn't even think it was tasty mac and cheese as a stand alone dish.  We ordered our own small bacon and green pepper pizza on which all of the ingredients, including the cheese, were microscopic in quantity.  I tasted a pepperoni slice, and I thought the pepperoni lacked even a hint of flavor.

So, yes, I approve.  If I lived around here I'd stop by often just to see what insane thing they chose to throw on top of pizza dough that day.  It certainly doesn't hurt that this may have been the best pizza dough I've ever tasted: light, crisp, crackly, yet stood up gamely to the onslaught of alien ingredients.",0.9754,0.741,0.177,0.082,0.5084738756613757

One not-so-pleasant difference between this location and the Madison one is the music. They prefer to play loud, weird stuff. Not the best when you're trying to yell your order to a worker with lots of people around. They have some cool regional varieties of pizza that Madison doesn't have, my favorite being S'mores pizza. When I went with my friend Felicia, we both got two slices, which we agreed was more than filling. I grabbed a slice of a chicken parmesan and a piece of S'mores pizza to add a dessert. The chicken parmesan featured rigatoni noodles with chicken and delicious cheese. It was cooked to perfection and tasted awesome. They made the S'mores pizza while I waited (it only took about 14 minutes), so I got it when it was nice and fresh. With toasted marshmallow, bits of graham cracker, chunks of hershey chocolate bars and a nice drizzle of chocolate syrup, it was amazing. The end of the crust was a little overcooked, but that was a small worry, as the rest of the pizza was freckin' sweet. Overall, I am pleased that there is an Ian's branch to serve my homesickness when it gets really bad. Nothing is the same as the one in downtown Madison, but this is a nice alternative!

This joint wants to roll the dice on an old favorite in an attempt hit the jackpot.  Ian's looks like a shooter but ends up bouncing the rocks over the side of the table. Everyone simply stares at them with eyes that say ""you have rolled before, right?"" I would like to taste more flavors that make me want to order up a whole pie, but there is not one slice on the menu i would want 2-4 more of to fill out a meal.  Kick up the flavors a couple of notches and then we can talk about getting Ian's comp'ed.  For a town with so many Za options you won't be seeing them at a final table anytime soon.

2009-10-14,4.0,"Thank you, Ian's for bucking the Chicago tradition and serving up a pizza with a REAL crust. Now, I realize its not New York or New Haven style, but any crust that has a bit of a flop to it and is chewy rather than crackery is aces in my book.  It's a little strange though, for some reason your pizza is only good hot from the oven? We took some home and I tried a piece cold (which is my favourite way to eat pizza btw) and it just wasn't good. Flavours were off, crust was heavy and too dense - how odd! Not since an unfortunate encounter with a day old D'Giorno have I been this taken aback and displeased.  I do like your fancy ingredient options, I will definitely be back for pizza.

Ian's pizza was pretty hopping after the Cubs v. Phillies game at Wrigley Field.  Located in Wrigleyville, the writing on the walls at Ian's boasts a friendly atmosphere--encouraging patrons to be nice or leave.  You order at the counter--a line which wrapped around nearly the whole restaurant.  They had some pretty sweet looking pizzas (however, only one vegetarian variety was available when I was up to order which kind of sucked, but I got it--feta tomato pizza--and it was good).  Just after I ordered, a macaroni and cheese pizza was up on the counter so we ordered a slice of that too.  It definitely had a nice novelty to it. I specifically checked the take-away menu for a list of other locations.  I want to see if this reasonable post-game hang out was unique to Wrigleyville or present other places as well.  No other locations were listed and judging by the large one panel comic interpretations of ""Ian's World"" up on the wall--all including references to the Cubs/Wrigley Field--I figured that this must be a one-of-a-kind Wrigleyville place.   The pizza wasn't amazing, but it was good and there were lots of sauces that you could add to top it.  It also seems you can BYOB (a group at a table had brought in some 12 packs).  It was definitely a cool place to go after the game as it was swarming with fans. It isn't unique to Wrigleyville--there's at least one other location in Madison, Wisconsin.  Oh well, that fact doesn't completely burst my Ian's Pizza bubble.  It was a good place to go after the game, as I said, filled with fans, and a solid place to tell someone to meet you after the game before hitting the bar scene.

Good, foldable slices - they do the standard pizzeria by the slice thing of having several pizzas prepped and sitting out on the counter, and then when you order, they grab a slice and send it back into the oven to reheat. This does have the advantage of making the crust crisper (most of the time). We got several different slices - a mac & cheese slice, a chicken taco slice, a standard sausage and 'roni slice, and a slice of what they were calling ""General Fukudome's Chicken"" in a nod to the linchpin business of the neighborhood. Honestly, the mac & cheese pizza was my least favorite - it's just a carb overload. I love mac & cheese, and I love pizza, but this combo just didn't do it for me. The chicken taco slice was actually pretty good, as was the ""General Fukudome's Chicken"" which was not even really a General Tso's knockoff, but rather more a teriyaki chicken and broccoli pizza.

Being even more a pizza purist than I, he was definitely freaked out by his own order. I will say that I liked the bbq sauce--it was tangy and sweet and not too overwhelming, but the french fries were weird and soggy. The mac 'n cheese pizza was, well, mac 'n cheese on bread. Cool concept, but not the best in actual execution--kind of bland, actually. I may or may not feel differently if I was 4 or 5 beers in...but not this time.

I thought this place was good, but not ""holy god damn"" amazing like Katja L.  I too, was a little disappointed with the Mac and Cheese Pizza. It was bland. I could taste a little of the cheese, but it wasn't the knock-out awesomeness like everyone said it was. It was literally like how you think Mac and Cheese on a pizza would taste. Meh. I also had a slice of the BBQ Steak and Fries, which was OK as well. The steak didn't have much taste at all, and the fries tasted a little weird on the pizza because they were kind of dried out. So essentially, I was eating cheese pizza with a drizzling of BBQ sauce -- it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting or craving.  Crust was very good though. Crispy on the outside, chewy and flavorful on the inside. I did find the size of the slices adequate, but not HUGE like others have said.  Two slices did it for me, and if you factor in a can of pop, it set me back about $8 -- not the best deal in the world. I might go back here after a late night of drinking on Clark because it's decent pizza and better than Pizza Ria and some of the other options nearby, but will I seek out this place just for their pizza on a sober basis?

I was extremely disappointed in the mac & cheese pizza, especially since everyone on Yelp raves about it!  It tasted like plain pasta and dough (the pizza crust).  Saw the cheese but didn't taste any of it.  I was expecting gooeyness but got what looked like if you threw a bowl of cooked elbows and shredded cheese together in a microwave - dry and plastic-y.   However, the spinach and feta pizza had really good flavor, and the feta was actually soft and crumbled easily.  The other combinations (i.e., black bean burrito, sausage, pepperoni, etc) looked like winners too.  I just wouldn't recommend the mac & cheese one. They sell pizza by the slice at the counter, and you can take it on a paper plate to a table to eat.  Yes, the people behind the counter are nice, but who cares about service at a place that you spend 10 minutes to eat at?  Not really worth a trip here unless you're in the area.",0.9893,0.784,0.182,0.034,0.5842731829573934

I will also admit that being from Boston, I have never quite taken to the little squares of pizza that the Chicagoans are into. I like a big, triangular slice, so I can hold onto the crust and dig in to the good stuff.

Did I just hear someone ordering MAC N CHEESE pizza? I asked for a menu and instead was given the 5-star tour of the warming tray. Steak and fries, penne pasta, lasagne, guacamole burrito...my heart was fluttering.  I ordered a slice of veggie taco. The first bite of the flavorful crust with black beans, cheese, and perfectly cooked bell peppers brought a tear to my eye. I inhaled the slice in about 1 minute flat, and then regretted that it was gone.  I went back within a week and requested the guacamole burrito. They didn't have any but they offered to make one for me if I'd wait...so of course I waited.

I'd recommend Ian's to anyone at anytime!",0.9934,0.679,0.302,0.019,0.5970238095238096
2008-09-16,5.0,"DISCLAIMER: I WAS DRUNK WHEN I ATE HERE So I reserve the right to edit this review after eating here sober.  But I'm pretty confident that my taste buds, even when inebriated, know a good pizza from a bad one.  Hence I feel good in declaring that Ian's pizza is FANTASTIC.   I have to admit that like many Chicagoans I am very over the whole deep dish thing.  So much so that I cringe when visitors come to town, knowing that they'll inevitably want to ingest this artery-clogging, afternoon-killing meal.  Truth be told I much prefer a nice NY-style or thin crust pizza for a light lunch, snack, 4th meal, whatever.  Enter Ian's.   I got a slice of the BBQ chicken pizza and the chicken parmasean pizza and both were wonderful.  The crust was perfect, the sauces were perfect, and there were just the right amount of toppings.   I'll definitely be back!  Hell, I might even go sober.",0.98,0.706,0.231,0.063,0.6489417989417988
2008-09-11,4.0,"Some friends took us to Ian's Pizza last night, and it was delicious.  I was starving and ordered 3 pieces of pizza.  I had something with buffalo chicken, black beans, and other stuff, which was tasty.  I had one that was like a loaded baked potato (with potato slices on it), which was great.  I tried the mac and cheese.... hello delicious.  And I tried the smores pizza, which is the perfect ending to the meal.  Why only four stars?  I'm a tough grader.  :) I also had a can of soda, but there was no recycling bin.  So, I asked about it.  The guys seemed like they are really working to get a recycle bin, and agreed to take my can home to their personal recycle bin.  This could have been a line to get me to leave, but I appreciated the effort.  The guys working there were also really attentive to us, making sure we were enjoying our pizza.   The atmosphere was ok.  It's got big tables, which was good for our semi-large group, but I imagine there is a lot of table-sharing when it gets busy.  The music was a little loud, but I appreciated the old school music.  Think Michael Jackson, circa late 80's.  Fun.  Overall, it was great food, good price, fun atmosphere.  Recycle boys, recycle!!",0.9956,0.718,0.253,0.029,0.5434587813620071
2008-09-08,5.0,"Late saturday night just after leaving Mullen's, my friends and I were headed down Clark with the idea that we would trek all the way out to The Weiner Circle when I had to do a double take at the cornucopia of Pizza that passed me by on my left. I had to look up the name of Ian's this morning because that night all I could think was, ""Need!"" The ordering process was simple enough, I stared open mouthed at such a wide variety that I eventually had to point and mumble ""pineapple and whatever"" and they shuffled me along to pay. It turned out to be pineapple and chicken and i was absolutely satisfied. My girlfriend didn't finish her Mac N Cheese and I was more than happy to oblige, waste not friends. Overall, for $3.75 you can have almost anything your little heart desires and the spot is what it will hit when you inhale your slice in record time.

Mac and cheese on pizza.  I thought it was a great idea to begin with and was happy to see it exceeded my expectations!  The flavors and textures all worked well together and OH MY GOD that crust!   And the people there are ridiculously nice and funny.  Looks like they really enjoy working there (always a sign of a good company with great management/ownership).  Made the experience even nicer! I think someone said this pizza is like crack, and I back that.  I can't wait until my next slice...

The cheddar cheese, the curly noodles, the pizza crust......together they are absolutely divine and instantly you understand why this is their number one pizza.  I also got the Chicken Penne Alfredo, definitely not as good but still delicious. My only complaint on this one was the actual chicken was oddly fried and didn't taste fresh. I think I'd try something else the next time around.",0.8004,0.765,0.164,0.071,0.6243589743589744
2008-08-25,3.0,"Unusual concoctions. Fries, BBQ sauce and steak? Mac and cheese? Sliced potatoes and ranch? Whatever was on that pizza, it was good. It was almost like topping my pizza with a side, be it potato salad or the mac & cheese. This would be great for that person who likes to smear their sectioned plate together until all the food is a big plate of mush salad.  $3.75 for a decent slice. If your not that adventorus, Bacci's offers a bigger slice for $5 and change.  The service was quick, as the pizza was sitting under the heat lamps waiting to be ordered. A quick pop in the oven by the cashier was all it took. The boys behind the counter reminded me of characters you would find in Pinneapple Express. They were down to earth guys who welcomed back the local customer. Kudos for that.",0.9408,0.865,0.119,0.016,0.4311965811965812
2008-08-21,4.0,"Went after the Yelp ComedySportz event on the way to Goose Island afterparty.  I was meaning to try Ian's ever since Robin C. mentioned it.  I have to say it has to be the best late nite pizza I have had and they have some drunken pizza toppings.   I bet Ian gets drunk and has eureka moments with his pizza creations.  ian, I've got some suggestions that will prob never make the cut.  How about duck nachos pizza, breaded ravioli pizza, longanisa/portuguese sausage with rice pizza, jelly bean and popcorn pizza, Rocky Mountain oyster pizza, kim chi/ natto pizza,  mango/lychee/tapioca balls pizza?  No?  Okay fine, I'll leave the crazy toppings to you.   I ordered the BBQ steak and fries, while Amish ordered the spinach, portabello mushroom, roasted red pepper pizza which totaled to about $7.  The pizza was thin and each bite had a light crisp.    I give it four stars for the unique toppings, price, and impressive taste for pizza by the slice that's been sitting awhile.  Next time I'll see if I can get one that's fresh out of the oven.",0.8771,0.861,0.096,0.043,0.5904761904761905

My top two recommendations right now.  BBQ Chicken Bacon Ranch and the Pesto Portabella.  The slices are huge and the crust is the perfect compliment to the jazzed up toppings.

2008-08-13,5.0,"Roaming in Wrigleyville, there are only a few spots to grab a quick slice of good pizza and most times its just decent.  Ian's is the top spot to find a unique and mesmerizing slice of za.  If you're a first time like I was take a moment to peer through the glass and examine the lovely artwork on each of their unique pizzas.  They have the usual pepperoni, sausage and cheese for $2.75.  Or try one of their more uniquely created for $3.75; like BBQ Steak and fries, Chicken burrito, Penne pasta marinara or Spicy chicken quesadilla.  I had the latter, while sober and let me tell you, I was thrilled.   With red onions, an assortment of colored peppers, tomatoes, two cheeses and chicken.  The veggies are diced and still have a crunch to them, the slice is more of a thin crust and the sauce had a tinge of sweetness.  It reminded me of this pizza once offered by Red Baron or Tony's, something like the ""fiesta"" pizza.   It was just enough, I was left with a feeling of satisfaction, still wondering if I should have more.  Ian's offers a few more non typical toppings like, French fries, pasta noodles (penne, lasagna, mac), blue cheese, Asiago, black beans and don't forget sauce..  Creme fraiche, Alfredo, balsamic, it goes on and on.    The sign on this place is not catchy, I've walked past many times and never looked in or wondered.  Reading these reviews, I think thats a great thing, I would hate to wait in a long ass line for a slice.  But, it's a truly awesome pizza.   If you go with friends, share a 2 liter, it costs $2.50 which is the price of two cans of pop or have water, they've supplied a free water pump stocked with cups with the condiments.   They also sell uncooked dough, 12"" for $2 or 20"" for $3.  That's a deal! It's like standing in a candy store and when they ask what you would like to have, you need more time!  The toppings are vivid and the pizzas gasp for your attention.",0.9928,0.823,0.158,0.019,0.5129629629629628

Ian's recently opened in Wrigleyville with a bang by giving out free pizza the night before its official opening.  Ian's Pizza is delicious New York style pizza, straight from Madison, WI. It was always packed before and after Kohl center events, and at bar time. This Ian's is for sure going to be packed before and after Cubs game.  The most popular slice was the Mac n Cheese, which is really good. My personal favorites are Tomato Pesto, Mushroom Pesto and the Chicken Burrito.
