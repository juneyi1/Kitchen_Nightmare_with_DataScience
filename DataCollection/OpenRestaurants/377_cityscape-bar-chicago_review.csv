2016-03-08,5.0,"There are very few places in Chicago like Cityscape, so here's what you should expect:  Pros:  - Best views in the city with floor to ceiling windows and a near 180' view of Chicago's skyline - Comfortable seating  - Modern decor  - Mood lighting - very romantic  - Drinks - Rarely will I ever say a drink was strong, but these drinks were Mr. Universe kind of strong. I usually guzzle a drink down in an unattractive manner, because there's no such thing as a strong drink when you are a woman over 25 in a big city.... hmmmm this place proves that all wrong! These drinks will have even the most seasoned drinker sipping slowly.  - Professional waitstaff - they are well groomed, well spoken, and polite. These are people who know what good service is.  - Very easy to get a cab in this area or a train.  - People pretty much stay to themselves. This isn't a mingle bar, but if you go with a date, or friends you are sure to have a good time.  - The seats are spaced for privacy, but if you want to sit by some strangers the bar is lined with seats.  Cons:  - They changed their menu and it's pretty much all fried food. I don't get dressed up all pretty to eat a plate of fries and a greasy sandwich. I could have worn yoga pants for that food.  - Parking is expensive so don't think of driving your car.  - You need to walk through the lobby to take an elevator in the back to get to the place, which is confusing. They don't have signs up or anything to help you figure it out on your own so if you go in the wrong door and no one is around you might find yourself walking around this building at night confused and dare I say it a bit scared. The Merchandise mart is nearly vacant at night, so walking through there trying to find the right elevator is a daunting task for a woman who's alone.",0.9835,0.748,0.167,0.085,0.5565808665808664

2015-08-23,4.0,"While everyone is running to Trump Tower, The Wit, Hancock or Sears Tower for a view over Chicago I chose the CityScapeBar during my latest Chicago visit. One reason was that I had to organize a corporate reception and all other venues do not except semi private parties below a minimum of $5000 in the city recently! Imagine how much you would have to consume with just 50 people! Anyways, this might be no reason for Chicago travelers to not check out the other venues but if you like to escape crowds and are looking for a new perspective over the city's skyline the CityScapeBar is a good alternative. From the 15th floor the bar opens views over Chicago River towards Willis Tower and The Loop. You can have conversations without too loud music and as said there are not too many people around, so that you can either hang out at the bar or in one of those cozy chairs at the tables.

The views are incredible, and the decor is really sleek and classy looking.  When we ordered from room service, we received food that is served here as well. The Honey Roasted Turkey Sandwich ($12) is really good, and it comes topped with lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon, and mayo. It had more meat than I was expecting, which is never really a bad thing. We also ordered the American Eggs-Plosion Burger ($14) which is a beef patty topped with a thick slice of ham, a fried egg, cheese, greens, onion, and tomato on a pretzel roll. This burger was amazing. It was well-cooked and perfectly seasoned. It says ""sliced ham"" so I was expecting a few piddly slices of packaged deli ham, but that is not even close to what I got. It was a big chunk of REAL ham, easily a half an inch thick. I would order this again, in a heartbeat.  I'd definitely frequent this bar more often.

I would recommend that you find some street parking after 9pm just to save yourself the hassle and the rude remarks. I also had to knock a star because one of the servers insisted my boyfriend's father pay for his bill first instead of getting a tab; this leads me to believe that they might profile.

When I was there last a few months ago they had a special on a specific Romanian dessert wine for $7. It hit the spot. A good place to start or end an evening. A mixture of single professionals who come here after work from the Mart which is next door.  The hamburger is good. I have tried it a few times. Ask them to grill the onions. if this place ever got a outdoor patio, it would be extra special. A fine upscale choice at some good prices.

It is right by the Merchandise Mart where the river splits, so the night time (or day time) view is phenomenal. You are in the heart of the city and close to all the major things in River North and the Loop. I would recommend this place before heading to the theatre. They have a pretty solid drink menu, for a hotel bar. The martinis were tasty and unique, for only $8. I had a pumpkin pie martini...while I didn't really love the graham cracker rim, the drink was creamy, smooth and tasted like pumpkin pie!   We came here on a Wednesday for the first time, before going to see the Book of Mormon. They had BOGO half off appetizers. I did not get it, but I would recommend the ceviche. I was drooling over my friend's plate of ceviche...it was fresh and HUGE, great to share between friends or gorge on by yourself. We all also got our own plate of sliders...you get three little greasy (but flavorful) sliders, one with feta cheese, one with blue cheese, and one with cheddar. They were all really good, despite their size, but I would not get this to share. It would be perfect for a meal. It came with parmesan truffle fries...they were really skinny, like Steak 'n' Shake fries, but don't underestimate. My husband and I were licking the plate clean after the sliders and fries.  We also ate the asian wings (just ok, a little cold) and the ahi tuna (not very plentiful). They both did not leave an impression on me.  If you are looking for a full plate, ask for the restaurant's menu. They didn't offer this to us until we were asking for the bill...had we known that there were full dinner plates available, we probably would've ordered from that. I don't regret getting the sliders/fries because they were perfect, but still!  Also...the attitude of the servers could be tweaked a bit. Our server seemed unamused by our happy little group. There were 6 of us (note: this place is NOT good for groups, even a size of 6), and while she didn't seem overwhelmed, she didn't expand on any specials, offer any favorites, or talk in general. She basically just wanted to take our order with little to no talking. It didn't ruin our experience, but I like happy service! If you are looking for a bar with a good view, go here!

I feel it is a good mix as to not be too pretentious. I had the margarita which used top shelf liqour and was $10. It was loaded up with alcohol in a good way and tasted like perfection! Service for our 2nd drink was a little slow but it was liekly due to  They advertised specials during the week for $4 champagne on Tuesdays and $5 Martinis on Thursdays.

Second, I had just gotten off of work after 12 hours and was tired and hungry...but I'll try to be objective. It's right across the river from my place. Could throw a stone and hit it. But I don't have a boat and it's too cold to swim so around the block I go to get there. Up to the 15th floor of the Sun-Times/Holiday Inn building and I enter into a severely under-construction Holiday Inn Lobby. I was surprised there was an atrium in the building, which made it cool. But as others noted, the Cityscape Bar has been renovated and you can definitely tell it was the first one to get treatment. Very modern, minimalistic, and a lot of texture. Both times (9pm and 5pm, respectively) I too have sat in the ""best"" corner table and are able to see the Handcock Building all the way out to airplanes landing at Midway. Tell me where you can see more variety from the 15th floor and I'll buy you a drink there. First time our service staff was great. Aaron was extremely friendly and made our post-Valentine's day dinner a sweet one with discounted Champagne bottles and a huge bowl of strawberries. Indeed the white textured walls do spoil some of the view at night, but if you can focus past it's one of the best views in the city. We had a great time that night. Second time our service staff left something to be desired. Dawn was very nice, but we were the only folks in the place at 5 pm on a Monday and I was hoping for a greeting a little more than ""Hi, what I can get you?"" In honor of Mardi Gras they had two ""martini specials"" for $7 - why not? My drink was an interesting concoction that was delivered to my girlfriend. Neat glass, but it really was only half-full. I watched the bartender take 5 minutes to make the drink and he was using a jigger and I'm sure there were proper ratios but look - a martini glass should be half-full after I drank half of it, not before. I went up and tried to talk to our server but luckily the bartender, bar back, and bar manager were all there too, shooting me evil looks and offering to ""add more juice"" to make it more full. Ehh, not what I was looking for. Good thing I didn't pay full price. The other drink was served in a champagne glass and had muddled strawberries. It was good. Dawn checked on us a few times, but I was done. We watched the sunset reflect off of a dozen buildings and watched the shadows grow down the river and then left. So, if you want a great place no one knows about, go here. Make sure you cover their eyes through the lobby, bring some sunglasses at night for the reflection, and know that while the drinks are okay and the view is great, you are still at a Holiday Inn.",0.9978,0.792,0.182,0.026,0.5013160173160175
