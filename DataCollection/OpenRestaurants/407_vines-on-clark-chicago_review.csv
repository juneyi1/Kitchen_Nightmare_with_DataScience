2017-09-02,1.0,"1 star is too good for this place.  Please read the negative reviews, of which there are many, before even considering going in here. This place has gone downhill from what was only a mediocre bar / restaurant to begin with.  Now it's as if they feel they have so much tourist business from unsuspecting suckers that they gave up trying all together. The food is horrible, drinks are watered down and overpriced, and the service is downright disgusting. From the rude idiotic bouncers at the door to the surly wait-staff and indifferent bartenders. There is nothing about this place that has any redeeming value whatsoever, as even the proximity to Wrigley Field makes it a haven for rube tourists who apparently expect to be treated like dirt anyway.  There are still enough restaurants in the area that value their customers and reputations, so patronize them and forget about this place.",-0.9337,0.773,0.073,0.155,0.638148148148148

Tried to step outside for a quick cigarette, no re entry under any circumstances, even thought the patio was empty.  Tried to go up to the roof for a view, nope she closed that too.  On top of the manager's no-fun attitude: the TVs color settings were different, there was a pink stripe running from the bottom to the top of the screen on several TVs, and there weren't any screens out on the patio.  Got several complaints from her own staff about how ridiculous her rules and management style are.  Ended up chain smoking on the back patio under her ""no smoking sign"", just to spite her.

2015-09-19,2.0,"My visit was on 9/12/2015 I went here for a late dinner and drinks. It was a Saturday at 9pm and the place wasn't busy at all. I sat at a table with 10 others and we all had a combination of dinner and/or drinks. We sat in the back room (fairly large sized room) and the only other people in the room was another couple. So it was nice to have the place to ourselves (almost).  Food I had ordered the chicken strips with fries. Chicken strips were tasty and the fries were delicious! The fries had a nice texture, crispy, seasoned well. I would literally just order a plate of fries if I ever went back. Service Oy vey. Our waitress was an idiot. A few others and myself had ordered Corona's. She said the lights were out, but the regular 16 oz cans were only $5. They were running a $5 special on domestics, so I thought that was weird. I had a few and when it was time, I had asked for the table and told her who was with who. She dropped off one bill for the table and told us they don't separate the bills at Vines. Okay? Well the Corona's were actually $7. Talked to the waitress and she said she never said $5 when clearly we all heard the same thing. Whatever we shrug it off. Everyone pays in cash, my friend and I pay with cards. we write our names next to our itemize order so she can charge the two cards and pay the rest with cash. Well when she came back she used the cash and only charged me two drinks. I forgot what happened to my friends tab, but I have no idea how this girl got her job. Between the slow service, miscommunication, and tab, I really didn't want to leave her more than 10%, but I wasn't going to short everyone else's tip, so I had to over tip.

Surprisingly!  Because I thought it was going to be just bar food...We went here on a Tuesday before the Cubs game for drinks.  I was starving and so was the Husband.  We ordered the crispy popcorn shrimp as an appetizer...When the shrimp came out they weren't just sad tiny popcorn shrimp, they were good sized, medium I'd say, perfectly golden fried shrimp!?!  They're so damn good...Served with homemade cocktail sauce and lemon wedges of course. We also shared a thin crust small pepperoni pizza.  That was also  bomb.com  and I was surprised at how full I got.  I left extremely satisfied and was able to have fun at the game and not stand in any of those ridiculous food lines in the stadium. The following Sunday we went to another Cubs game and I told my Husband, the only way I'm going to sit through this cold and dreary game is if you feed me first...and I want to go back to Vines :)  So we returned to Vines and they remembered us and our drink orders from last time! :)  Food wise this time, I ordered the vegetable chili and the popcorn shrimp.  The chili was fantastic!  Served with cheese and red onions on top.  It was hot, tasted fresh, and was the perfect touch to a cold and windy Chicago day.  Shrimp were on point just like before.  My Husband ordered the chicken tenders and fries and he ate every morsel on his plate. lol. The fries have that curly fry batter on them, but they're not curly.  The other thing I want to point out is that everything tasted fresh to order...I could tell that the chili hadn't been recycled everyday for a week and the fried foods came out crispy and hot, not like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp.   I can't speak on other Wrigley bars and restaurants, but this is definitely a few leaps and bounds over typical bar food.  Thanks Vines!",0.9844,0.833,0.135,0.031,0.5613782051282051

I ordered the hummus as a meal which comes with pita and assorted veges, including cucumber. I asked our server for more cucumbers as was trying to avoid the bread. We were brought out a plate of about a quarter of a cucumber. Our server never mentioned an upcharge. When we received our bill, we were charged $4 for cucumbers. That's more than half the cost of a drink!  Not to mention you could buy a whole cucumber for around $0.60 at a grocery store. Surrounding diners noticed my concern, agreeing that this charge was outrageous. If the charge was more reasonable, somewhere around $1-$2, I wouldn't be so upset.

We sat on the patio which was nice. It wasn't crowded at all-probably because it wasn't game day.  We were attracted by the special $5 for personal pizzas. We didn't want to eat a lot so we ordered two. One ""spicy"" and one artichoke and goat cheese. They came in slices of eight. The spicy pizza tasted like they used sriracha for the base but whatever it was, it was good. It can be a lot for some that are not used to spicy food. The other pizza was pretty good as well - my boy friend who didn't like goat cheese enjoyed it as well. My boyfriend also, being difficult, had to ask the waitress for garlic powder because that's the ""brooklyn"" way to do it because he's from new york. The waitress was very accomodating. So if you don't mind asking for it I suggest you acquire that magic dust. Also my boyfriend and I normally don't eat the crust of pizzas but we ate everything.

I've been here a few times, and everything is pretty decent, especially the appetizers. I would not, however, want to pay full price for them. Go on the nights that they have specials. -The specials! Monday nights are half off all food and wine--this is great deal, in case you didn't realize it. Tuesday nights are half off apps and $1 Miller Lites. Check out their website for more. Definitely worth going on the nights there are specials. BE WARNED: there are no specials when the Cubs have a home game.  The bad: The service here really sucks. I can only recall having one server that I actually wanted to tip. I normally go here in large groups, and they always seem to have trouble bringing everything to the table in a timely fashion with everything correct and splitting the check. Everything is so slow, even when coming with just a small party. The waitress does not bring the food to the table herself, which adds to the confusion. It usually takes about 3 trips from the food-bringing man (there's a technical term for him) to get everything right. While I have not had an extremely unpleasant waitress, I have heard multiple complaints from friends who have. Too bad, because if the service was better and it didn't take so long to get your food and then get the check, this would be a prime place to go. Well, it's a Wrigleyville bar with good specials. Guess you can't have everything in life.

Once time is forgivable, but a second time? Seriously? Who is ordering the supplies for their menu? We also joined the all-too-eager-for-brunch crowd the day after St. Patty's to kick off our Sunday Funday. HUGE mistake.  Our table of 10 or so all wanted brunch and Vines was the chosen place for their $5 bunch items menu, with the beer garden to boot. Upon arrival, we were informed that there was no brunch that day. Glad we chose to go there specifically for what they DIDN'T have... Not only did they not have brunch, but we waited a solid 1.5 hours for our food to be brought out to us. ONE and a HALF HOURS. Here's a suggestion: plan for the drinking holidays and warm weather. You're a Clark St. bar in Chicago. How do you NOT prepare for nice weather and hungover workers?  Needless to say, we gave the servers a huge round of applause when our food was brought out...Enough to make most of the entire restaurant look around to see what we were applauding.

2012-03-19,1.0,"I'll say this.  My visit to Vines on Clark was not one that would make me want to return even on a regular visit.   Granted my first and only experience with Vines on Clark was during this last St. Patrick's Day BUT, that does not excuse the behaviour I received from Matt, one of the 5 bartenders that afternoon. While making my way through the throng of people I found a spot at the very corner of the bar near some online gambling device and the wall.  To make sure that I could get noticed when others who were waiting had been served I stood on the foot rests of two adjoining bar stools.  (Again this was done so that I could be seen over the aforementioned gaming device).  After patiently waiting for about 2 minutes the bartender, Matt I was later to find out, says, ""You can stand there as like as you want...""  in a  manner that was clearly indicating to me that he would have finished this comment with, ""but I'm not going to serve you any faster.""  Fine, I replied with a smile stating, ""I know I'm just patiently waiting my turn like everyone else, no rush."" which was ignored.  After several minutes passed I noticed that one of the folks that was with my party had made his was to the bar just around the curve so I let him know that I would place his beer order.  So the bartender finally asks what I want, I give him my order and asked my friend what he wanted which was met with an audible sigh and eye rolling from said bartender.  I said, ""thanks for accommodating I thought I would save you a step"" and the bartender just gave me a disdainful stare.  While he's putting the order into the computer I ask his name and get it, ""thanks Matt I appreciate it.""  Keep in mind now that the place is crawling with people including some who were soused and no longer needed or should have been served anymore alcohol as well as yelling and elbowing their way towards the bar. Still I patiently waited for my drinks, retrieve them and make my way back to my party.  So ends exchange one.  Some time has passed and I decide to make my way to the bar once more for one last round (just two drinks mind) and get to around the same spot.  I get to the bar front without shoving, pushing or yelling and again, patiently wait.  35 minutes go by along with plenty of other people who deem holding their hands out and shaking them at Matt while saying, ""hey, HEY!"" is the best way to get their drinks first.  Apparently it was because despite my patience and staying in the same spot this entire time, these obnoxious individuals get served first.  Matt finally comes to get my order.  ""I'd like a Guiness and a Highball please."",  ""What the f***s a Higball man?!""  he responds with another eye-roll.  ""Whiskey and 7-Up"", and then the comment that tipped the edge, ""Is that it this time?"", ""Yes that will do, thanks Matt much appreciated again.""  Nothing.  So ends second and last exchange. Hmm.  I could be one of those folks that here says, ""Really!?""  or ""Wow, someone's an a**hole.""  But instead I'll say this, was it very busy in VoC? Yes.  Are their a lot of rude demands for attention from the bartenders on a day like St. Patrick's Day? Yes.  Was I a paying customer that was far from rude and waited despite the circumstances?  Absolutely.  Will I ever be a patron of VoC again?  I'd rather punch myself in the face.  And it did take me slightly a-back that a bartender doesn't know what a standard order like a Highball is and gives me guff about it.  Oh well never again. 2 stars only because it was St. Patrick's Day and so I guess I can understand the staff being stressed  but even that I feel is being overly gracious.  When it's busy that's when the service has got to keep their cool the most not treat your patron's like an inconvenience. --UPDATE-- I changed this review to 1 star cos it's far past this experience and I still get a little sour thinking about it.",0.9964,0.827,0.129,0.044,0.3871162393162393

Admittedly, our party was ""less than ideal"" for a server.  (as I've worked in the industry.)  We had guests from out of town, three children and we went simply for lunch (no drinks) several hours before the Sox-Cubs game. After splittling our group into two tables (within the server's same section) we sat and waited simply for menus.  Knowing that the 6 yr old, 4 yr old and 20-month old would not last much longer without food, we decided to take matters into our own hands and also try and assist our server, Kelly, who not only seemed busy, but later justified her attitude and terseness to our group with that same fact of being too busy. Children's menus were eventually SLAPPED onto our ""clean"" tables with a promise that Kelly would try and find us crayons...a promise that went unfulfilled.  Drink orders were taken and served to us with a sprinklilng of ice cubes the size of skittles.  (it was 95 degrees out) Kelly, we understand you were busy, but the conversations we clearly saw you having with your other tables, prompted us to try and initiate our order quickly.  Your lecture and attitude that resulted from our desire to feed our kids; was unnecessary, rude, unprofessional and childish. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time and the quality was okay-ish. We ate our meals with a collective sense of, ""what the heck is going on here?"" and hoped that nothing else would go wrong with our order for fear that we asked our server for something else to put her out. Overall, a pretty awful experience was highlighted by our bill.  19% gratuity was added onto the bill NINETEEN PERCENT!!!! One more time...19%!!!! She felt it necessary to include our three kids in our count for ""groups of more than 7"" that would be the catalyst for the included gratuity. Kelly simply didn't care.  She knew she'd get her nearly-$15 tip and gave us an effort equivalent to  what I could do as a customer, outside of punching in the order in their computer systems.

The patio doors were open allowing some fresh air to blow thru and the skylights provided the prefect amount of light.  We were cheerfully greeted, seated, and brought a drink.

We ordered appetizers and dinner, along with drinks, so she should have been pretty satisfied with the business. She entered my order wrong and then didn't bring my order out for at least 30 minutes; everyone else had finished eating by the time I got my order. She then was bold enough to include the charge for that order on the bill (only $7, but still). When I questioned her and said I wouldn't pay for the incorrect and very delayed order, she gave me attitude, snatched our empty beer cans, and stormed off. Her manager returned to the table about 15 minutes later, which was a long wait to get any feedback or bill, and she also gave us alot of attitude. The manager questioned why she shouldn't charge me for a pizza I ate, even though I explained the situation. She stormed off, came back 10 minutes later and slammed the new bill on the table (minus my $7 order).  Both the waitress and the manager seemed young;, maybe 21-23.

Afterwards, my friend went home and I met up with the girl (you know, The Girl) and her friend.  It was about 6 p.m. and they had been ""shots, shots, shots, shots"" since 11 a.m.  At this point drunkenness has become their normal state of mind.  You know, when they state that they're sobering up, though they are really just becoming acclimated to their brains operating at quarter capacity.  Not hatin', we've all done it...! We decide to head to Vines On Clark.  I had NEVER been here before.  My sole attraction to this bar was the lack of line out front.  The drinks were standard price-$6.00 for a modest pour of vodka.  The night (and this review) could have ended here because this was a very forgettable and lackluster bar. However, two things happened: 1) I saw some hipsters.  In Wrigleyville.  I know.  No, no, no, it's NOT that common.  These were the hardcore type of hipster.  They were dressed in typical faux-nerd fashion.  I immediately thought ""20/20 vision, just a pair of empty frames.  Dressing like a nerd, although he never got the grades.""  This guy's legs may have been painted ""denim"" his jeans were so tight.  I don't know what attracted these hipsters to Vines.  The music was too mainstream.  Hmmm, I don't hate hipsters as a species.  I just don't have to like them either.  (Though two of my besties are hipsters.  That negates the hate, right?) 2) Us three were the only ones seated at the bar.  That is, until John arrived.  Oh, John.  The late-middle-age black guy rockin the Illini hoodie.  He sat next to me.  I turned to him, with a slight vodka-induced grin, and uttered "" 'Allo.""  John took this to be a sign that we were long lost blood brothers.  His vocal cords erupted with chatter of his hoe and how she told him she wanted to date other people, and how he in turn told her that he was fine with dating other people.  That he would find him so p..... until she came back to him.  He would laugh sporadically over what I can only assume were youthful memories relating to encounters of said p..... John bought us three and himself (four in total, stay with me here) each a shot of Jameson.  I returned the favor.  We all danced.  For hours.  Four hours?

I started with an $11.00 cocktail, the My Little Pony.  They happily accommodated my request to substitute the pineapple juice for orange juice, and garnished the drink with an orange to boot!  We shared the spinach artichoke dip, which was a standout example of the dish; the dip was covered in extra cheese and it was served with warm pita slices.  Delicious.  I chose the beef stew for my dinner, and while it was a solid dish that satisfied me, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.   Vines was recommended to me by fans who asserted that the prices were great; I'm not often in Wrigleyville, so it's possible that the prices are good compared to similar places nearby, but $11.00 for cocktails and entrees starting at $9.00 are not exactly bargain prices.  The area is kind of a ""local"" tourist trap, if there is such a thing...Cubs fans from all over the city congregate in this area, so I suppose that prices at the area establishments are inflated to reflect the naivete of the patrons.   Vines on Clark is a perfectly decent example of a bar/restaurant that exists to serve people around the baseball schedule.  It is not, however, a destination place...unless, of course, you're craving some delicious spinach artichoke dip and are willing to brave obnoxious baseball fans in pursuit of it.  2 stars for the quality and uniqueness of the food/drinks, 1 extra star for our great server",0.9897,0.815,0.153,0.032,0.6039426523297491

2008-08-17,3.0,"My plans for staying in this weekend were foiled when my friend called me up wanting to go out, though to be honest it didn't take much convincing on her part.  We had intended to go to another bar, but that was closed for a special event so we made a few calls and met up with some friends who were having dinner at Vines on Clark.  When my friend said the name of the place I did an internal groan, because really?  Saturday night in Wrigleyville?  I didn't want to deal with that scene, but just decided to go with the flow and keep an open mind since I had never been there. Our friends had a table inside, which had a million TVs tuned to the Olympics, the cubs game, and the bears game.  I was pleasantly surprised by the mixed crowd there - it wasn't your typical Wrigleyville crowd at all, and this made me happy.  Everyone genuinely seemed to be enjoying their company, the food, the games, and it just had a good vibe to it. We went up to the bar to get drinks, which took a while.  They must have been down a bartender or something because one guy was desperately trying to help everyone, while another girl was...  well, I'm not sure what purpose she served back there, other than looking bitchy and not serving drinks.  But the bartender finally came around to us and served up our drinks quickly. We wandered back over to our friend's table, when I noticed a table on the patio getting up so we quickly snagged that.  It was a gorgeous night outside, and our patio table was perfectly situated to where we could still see all the TVs.  The patio itself here is really nice - there are plenty of tables to sit at as well as a huge ledge-like thing to sit on, and I was surprised it wasn't more crowded since it was such a nice night out. Our server was great - she made sure we were okay on drinks, but the drinks were taking forever to come out.  She recognized this and apologized for it each time, which I thought was nice.  My drinks were pretty weak and barely had any vodka in them - boo.  When our friends finished dinner and joined us, they had mixed reviews on the food.  (Too much seasoning seemed to be the main complaint - a few hours later I had a square of a friend's leftover pizza and DAMN that was spicy!) We were enjoying our drinks and the night, when everyone in the bar went nuts watching Michael Phelps win #8.  It was really cool to see everyone in the place get so excited and cheer him on, and even though I haven't been interested in the Olympics it was hard not to get caught up in the excitement.  It was a cool moment. My one complaint about this place, aside from the weak and slow drinks, is that they should look into burning some citronella candles or something out on the patio.  Don't get me wrong - it's a gorgeous space and we had a lovely evening out there, but there were bugs galore because of all the lights and it took a while to lose that feeling that something is crawling on me.  Not exactly a sexy feeling on a Saturday night. Overall, this place was a pleasant surprise and I will mentally tuck it away to give it another try sometime.  I think it could easily earn another star.",0.999,0.711,0.226,0.063,0.5551226551226551

The goat cheese and grape salad my girlfriend ordered came out substantially better.  She seemed happy with the amount of goat cheese, commenting that there wasn't an over-abundance of it.  The grilled chicken she had added to the salad was a bit dry, but actually tasted like chicken.  Overall, the salad was a vast improvement on my Roast Chicken (Pork) Fettuccini.

The service was really friendly and staff was accommodating.  This is definitely one of the nicer options in Wrigleyville to check out.",0.9744,0.764,0.223,0.013,0.6357142857142858
2007-04-18,4.0,"If you are seeking refuge in Wrigleyville....this may be your place.  Nice, clean setting. Big bar area, ample seating, nice rooftop and outside decks in the summer. Fresh menu. Well prepared. Friendly service.  Wrigleyville is what it is. And it is a drunken, old frat boy party during games...and yes, a few will drift in to be obnoxious during game days...but overall this place is a calm in the storm, a gentle place to rest your feet and experience excellent salads/flat breads and good drinks :) Do not try to park in Wrigleyville March-November.

2007-01-19,5.0,"One of my favorite spots on Clark. In the summer, nothing beats the rooftop, and on a cooler night, the interior rooms with the fireplace is nice.  The service is friendly, the food is delicious and very reasonably priced, and the $3 Svedka martinis on Thursdays can't be beat.  The Willy Wonka is the best drink ever.  This place has a bit more upscale vibe, but it's very casual and a great place to chill for a little bit.",0.9561,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.733
2006-12-11,4.0,"This spot has turned over so many times, but I think Vines will survive.  I like that it has a more upscale feel, yet very casual.  The room with the fireplace kind of reminds me of The Northside on Damen.  I've never had a bad meal or bad service here.  They always have drink and food specials.  The last time we were there my boyfriend ordered a spicy flatbread that was so spicy he couldn't eat it (which is not like him at all) we told the waitress and she replaced it and didn't charge us for the original.  I love that they have outdoor space too.",0.9786,0.787,0.213,0.0,0.6277777777777778
2006-08-21,5.0,"Oh, the rooftop patio.  The fireplace.  The Christmas tree during the holidays... such good things.  But OH--the friendly service, the towering caprese salad, the martini list featuring a drink called ""Willy Wonka!"" I love this place. Even though yesterday our server brought my vodka gimlet along and said, ""Tell me if that tastes nasty.""  Um...  Okay, actually, I love Vines even more because of that encounter. Vines is an awesome alternative to the ongoing frat parties all along Clark, complete with great food and drinks and an all-season, comfy ambiance:  cozy in the winter, sun-filled during fair-weather months.  Love.  It.  And the vodka gimlet was just fine.",0.9868,0.737,0.263,0.0,0.6285714285714287

2006-07-03,4.0,"Good place to go for food in Wrigleyville.   Front patio usually has a fun, young crowd.   It was 15-20 tables that gets sunshine until 5pm.  Great flat bread pizza, salmon and grilled chicken sandwich.  Very reasonable prices- $12 for the salmon, $9 for the pizza.  The Chicago entertainment book has a coupon for buy one entree get one free (this coupon alone is worth $12- the entire book is just $30).",0.9612,0.722,0.254,0.024,0.5072727272727273

2006-05-08,4.0,This is a very cute place to go and grab a drink on a date or with friends.  It has a great outdoor patio that I'm looking forward to for the summer when it gets warmer outside.  The inside is very nice and even though we didn't order food- they have a pretty decent menu from what I saw.  Would be a great date place or a good  happy hour spot.,0.9829,0.645,0.355,0.0,0.7574074074074074
2005-11-12,4.0,This place seems a bit out of place on the Clark strip - which is a good thing. It's a bit more classy than the sports bars surrounding it. They always have great drink specials and the rooftop is awesome.,0.9359,0.691,0.309,0.0,0.75
