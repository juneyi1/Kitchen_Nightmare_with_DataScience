So much better than just butter! Our table also tried the veal ravioli, linguine with white clam sauce, and the Italian sausage.  Everything was tasty -white sauce in clam dish had a nice kick too it - not too spicy. Parking can be a challenge in this area, but well worth the visit.",0.8997,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.4128968253968253

2017-08-03,4.0,Came here after a few recommendations and were not disappointed! The staff was nice and attentive. We came on a Thursday for the prefix menu- my husband did the prefix and I got an entree.  We started with a bottle of chianti that for under $30 was good! Got the bruschetta as a starter which was nice and acidic. Their warm bread with the garlic paste was addictive.  For entrees I got veal ravioli and he got rigatoni. Both were flavored well and not overcooked. However I'd say mine lacked a little of acidity and his salt.  A cannoli at the end was gone in seconds. Very good! Overall we'd definitely come back here for more meals. Great neighborhood spot.,0.9748,0.799,0.201,0.0,0.592

I felt my portion size was much bigger than his, as he received 2 large pieces of broccoli, a chicken breast and a pile of mashed potatoes.

I have dinner by myself quiet often and this is my go to place to unwind, have a glass of wine and top notch food. One main reason i also enjoy this place is because the noise level is very low!

The almond breaded eggplant was a undercooked, leaving it bit too firm. I think it would have been a solid dish if cooked through.

I appreciate that my server was not at the table every 15 minutes inquiring as to whether everything was okay.

2016-08-20,5.0,"Love, LOVE, love this family owned neighborhood spot.  We've been coming here since they opened their doors... must be close to 15 years by now (shame on me for not reviewing sooner!).  One of my most favorite starters on the planet is their Carpaccio de Barbabietola salad.  If you love beets...oh yeah, and a crispy, warm pillow of goat cheese, this is a must have.  I order it every. single. time!  Their regular menu has stayed consistent over the years (and being a creature of habit, this makes me happy).  It's always accented by a list of fabulous specials.   First, I'm in love with the garlic paste they bring out with the warm loaves of bread.  I can slather this stuff on just about anything, but definitely the bread. And sometimes my chicken.   My favorite pasta is probably one of the most simple dishes on the menu - the Capellini d'Angelo al Natural.  The tomato basil sauce is super fresh and feels like my husbands Italian grandma made it.  I'm also partial to their eggplant dish.  The Melanzana alla Emilia Romagna is three generous, thick slices of eggplant crusted with almonds and topped with a delicious mixture of caramelized onions and that fabulous tomato basil sauce.  Fresh & delish.  When I'm in the mood for meat, I usually order their grilled chicken dish, Paillard di Pollo alla Griglia.  Again, very fresh and I like the arugula touch.   My husband usually hits the special menu and the seafood options have been fabulous.  Did I mention the octopus salad?  When I'm not hitting the beet carpaccio and the octapus salad is on special, it's another favorite. I digress.  Aside from the specials, my hubby's go-to items are the Costoletta di Maiale all Toscana (grilled pork chops) or the NY Strip, Bistecca alla Crosta di Parmigiano.  If you like pork, you're going to fall in love with the Costoletta Toscana.  I know, because I always as for a bite.  These are thick, juicy and the most tender t-bone pork chops...I should probably mention there are two?!?!  Honestly, there's enough for two meals, for sure. Unless your wife keeps steeling bites. Not that we usually have room for dessert, BUT on Thursdays they offer a Prix-Fixe dinner.  For $25, you get an appetizer, an entree and dessert.  What a steal!  Sometimes we take the dessert to go and sometimes we go for it.  They have a nice selection of gelato, but I'm partial to the tiramisu. Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention their bar.  Seriously, it's like Cheers in there.  I'm not kidding! If the owner and chef, Chepe, isn't behind the bar often you'll find his equally charming wife, Eileen.   A lot of regulars hang, and often eat, at their bar.  It's a great place to grab a cocktail while you wait for your table or to enjoy an after dinner digesif.  Perhaps a little grappa or amaro anyone?   In addition to the warm & inviting service of the owners, they have a really great staff.  We've had some of their waiters taking care of us for YEARS and they know our choice of beverages by heart.  Let's face it, if the staff stay that long, you just know this place is special!",0.9993,0.752,0.235,0.012,0.5944712207870102

I would just come for the bread and garlic paste. I think it's made from sweet roasted garlic, olive oil, pepper and some other spices. I had to control myself or I would've eaten that till I was full!  Anitpasti- Fried Calamari Al Tre Modo: The baby squid was tender and crisp. I felt like that amount we were given was kind of small. It was probably 6 or 7 small pieces in total. The spicy tomato sauce that came with it just tasted like thickened shrimp cocktail sauce. It wasn't spicy either.  I ordered the Paperdelle bolognese. Paperdelle is one of my favorite types of pasta and you usually can't go wrong with classic bolognese sauce. The portion size was nice but I found the noodles to be overcooked and the sauce disappointing. I honestly felt like and said that I was eating Chef Boyardee sauce from a can.  My friend ordered the Spaghetti Al Gamberetti. Once again, overcooked noodles. The pasta came in a bowl of soup basically. I was hoping to find that thick rich tomato based seafood sauce. It was also under seasoned.. my friend emptied he whole bowl of garlic paste for the bread into her pasta. It actually made it taste better.  Finished off our meal with Tiramisu for dessert. Nothing special about the Tiramisu.  I honestly don't see what all the hype is about.",0.9966,0.785,0.188,0.027,0.5083638583638584

Everything here tasted outrageously fresh.  The basil in my pasta literally crunched between my teeth.  They must have a basil plant in the kitchen or something.  That freshness really made a difference. Once you order, you get a basket of hot bread, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  It comes with this *heavenly* spread made of garlic, olive oil and parmesan.  You could eat that all night and walk away happy. * Pennine al'Arabiata ($14.95) - Pennine pasta tossed with fresh herbs, garlic and a touch of spicy tomato sauce.  Very, very good.  I loved the spicy kick.  Spicier, I think, than other arabiata sauces I've had.  That ultra-fresh basil was key.  Slices of fresh garlic take it up a notch.  This is heaven on a plate. * Pollo Al Afumicatto ($18.95) - Sauteed chicken breast with smoked mozzarella, in a smoked tomato and bacon sauce served with pesto mashed potatoes.  Quite good, though I preferred my pasta.  The pesto mashed potatoes were delicious.  The smoked tomato/bacon sauce was an interesting flavor combo.  I'm not sure it worked 100% with the chicken and mozzarella, but I enjoyed it. I drank a glass of the house pinot noir.  Not super impressed. I wish I could give Buona Terra five stars, but the atmosphere is really way too casual for food this good.  If you're looking for a romantic night out, this isn't the place.  The paper tablecloths, the flat screen TV and the very loud sounds from the bar really put a damper on the mood.  We also felt kinda rushed as plates were removed before we were asked if we were finished.  This food is so good, it deserves to be savored.  I wish the place were quieter, dimmer and cozier.

NEVER. We went to eat again last night and not only there is only one server who knows we are locals, the owner clearly doesn't care.

So we got home with a paid meal with half of it gone and no attempt from the server neither the owner to take care of it since number 1,we are customers who paid,2 we have been locals for so long?  What can I say...if it wasn't for the food I personally would not go back. I could cook Italian dishes every day for myself if I want to and choose to go out to eat different kinds of food elsewhere.

Almost Mac n cheese like.. But better.  We also ordered the Pollo Afumicatto, chicken with mozzarella in a bacon sauce (also flavored with something else). That also was delicious and the chicken melted in our mouths too. At the end we combined the gnocchi and the sauce for the chicken and it was also a great winning combination.

2015-01-11,4.0,"For all the time spent in Chicago, I'm surprised I never visited.  Buona Terra, despite winning a couple of ""new restaurant"" awards (which is how I stumbled upon it in the first place...) isn't actually new, and is located right on the outskirts of Logan Square. It feels like a family-run, family-oriented, very cozy Italian restaurant. It has a pretty traditionally Italian menu, but has a focus on fresh ingredients and cooking with love. My boyfriend came and I came here with my Yelp wife, Alessandra S., and we tried the food. The atmosphere is more family-friendly, but I would come here on a date. The tables are very close to one another, but there weren't a lot of people when we went (perhaps because it was very late?)  I remember getting two specials, one being an appetiser that had burrata and proscuitto (though I'm not sure what the dish was called,) and gnocchi.  All of it was great. Burrata wasn't as good as the type I can get at Eataly or Pazzia in SF, but it was still delicious. My boyfriend got the breaded eggplant dish and really liked it, and my friend also got the gnocchi. When it came out, we both thought it wouldn't be enough, but it definitely was. And it was delicious. The servings, otherwise, are MORE than enough and you can definitely take it all home in a doggy bag. :) The other thing is the DELICIOUS garlic spread that they serve with the bread. YUM! Ask for extras. :)  All in all, we really liked Buona Terra.

2014-12-17,5.0,"Three friends took me to this Logan Square's gem for a birthday dinner on a Thursday night.  I wasn't familiar with this restaurant at all but they just raved about.  Cool - let's check it out. We had arrived early on Thursday and we were seated right away in the dining room.  The restaurant is like two conjoined stores - the first part is the bar area with open seating and then the dining room is in the second store.   The dining room has the original wooden floors, exposed brick walls, wall of windows facing the street.  The atmosphere is formal but relaxed with the linen table clothes and napkins.  We were seated next to the window, which can be a little breezy but nothing to complain about.    On Thursday nights, you can opt to have the prix fixe menu for $22.00 which is a great deal. I had ordered the Caesar Salad, Parmesan Crusted New York Strip and the Cream Puffs.  Sorry, that I don't remember what my companions ordered, but the mussels were a huge hit. From the time we sat down to the time we departed, the service was impeccable.  One of my friends dropped her fork and by the time she picked it up, the waiter had a new fork for her.   The food put all of us in a food coma.  The food was presented to us in the appropriate amount of time.  Well seasoned.  Just right.  Kudos to the kitchen staff!! My friends have been here several times, and stated, the food is always consistent. On our departure, we met one of the owners, who was very gracious.  I would highly recommend the restaurant to everyone.",0.9945,0.822,0.168,0.009,0.4247208347208348

For starters, the service was slow.  It took over 5 minutes for the waiter to come by and greet us and take our drink orders.  It was also only until we asked for bread that it was served.  You receive a dish of garlic puree to enjoy with your bread, but here's an insider tip: ask for the jalapeno olive oil.  The combo is so tasty!  The kitchen must have been behind, but it took a good while before our prosciutto wrapped cheese and beef carpaccio arrived, both of which don't seem to take that long to prep.  When my veal cerafino (with wine sauce and CANNED mushrooms, roasted potatoes, and bland broccoli) arrived, there was a folded light colored hair on my plate.  My bald waiter's joke about it probably not being his did not make the situation better.  My entree was taken away and a new plate prepared, but overall, this capped off a disappointing experience and meal.",0.8908,0.891,0.087,0.022,0.4614141414141414

On the menu, they described Salsiccia Con Escarole E Fagioli as this Italian ""homemade"" sausage served with some lettuce and beans. No, I didnt think it was ""homemade."" It was overcooked, and a bit rock solid hard. The lettuce and beans side was a joke. It looked like it has been sitting out for the whole day and microwaved hot. I could eat that at all.  Rotini Di La Nona, it's this screw pasta with mushroom and green pea. Um, is it suppose to have this plastic looking gloss on the pasta? Are you sure you didn't microwaved this?    Unless I am being invited/dragged by someone, I am not planning to come here again. Sorry.",0.9848,0.802,0.144,0.054,0.4939339981006648

2014-04-05,4.0,"Like most people, I tried Buona Terra on a Thursday night to take advantage of the fantastic prix fixe menu where for $22.95, you can choose ANY appetizer, entree, and dessert from the regular menu. I don't know of any other place that makes such a generous offer so they should get a star just for that. My three choices were: mussels, penne arrabiatta, and the chocolate pecan tort. The mussels and pasta were delicious. If it's true that it's all about the sauce, then Buona Terra clinches it. The spicy tomato sauce that the mussels were nestled in had good kick and wonderful flavor, as did the arrabiatta sauce. But I think it's as much about the pasta and mine was perfectly al dente.  As an aside, my dining partner had minestrone soup and was impressed that the veggies were crisp (even the zucchini!) and not overcooked as tends to happen with minestrone. The chocolate pecan tort was a little too milk chocolate sweet for my palate. It almost tasted like fudge with nuts in it. If you like fudge, you'll like this dessert. Next time, I'll pick something else. My only complaint would be our server didn't add to our experience. On the contrary, he seemed to be going through the motions (maybe a bad night?). He wasn't quick on his feet from a service perspective. To illustrate: my partner ordered an entree that was $23.95 while I ordered the penne that was $12.95. I asked if chicken could be added and he said no, that'd be extra. If I were him, I'd have quickly obliged and made my customer happy given that the base price of my entree was only $12.95, so even if they add chicken, they're still ahead. Unfortunately, that interaction set the tone. All in all, I'd definitely return because the food is good and the price is right.",0.9895,0.815,0.148,0.037,0.6409990547087321

Ambiance: This place is perfect for a group of friends that want to eat and laugh and make some noise. I always end up going to Italian restaurants that are so quiet you can hear a pin drop. I have a loud voice, I need a restaurant that can handle that.  Service: This was topnotch. Our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable, and seemed interested in what we had to say which is always good. He also recommended some delicious Italian fare, which wins him many points in my book. Food:It was nothing to write home about but it's solid  food. I got spaghetti in a tomato sauce with rock shrimp. It was only okay. The rock shrimp was good but the sauce was runny and tasted a bit bland. My friend got some sort of pasta in a cream sauce....now that was delicious! The cream sauce was flavorful and thick and magically delicious.  Overall, good Italian food at an okay price.

As for the atmosphere, it is good but not excellent.  It's a bit dark for my liking.  Also the last time we were there, they sat us between the bar and a huge party.  The huge party was drunk and loud, and we were so close to the bar that we could hear every word of this woman's conversation to a stranger about her drug habits... so that was uncomfortable.  But another time we sat in the back room, which was much quieter and warmer.  So I guess the moral of the story is, try to sit in the back room.",0.988,0.726,0.194,0.08,0.5398809523809524

The manager came over at our request and told us she gets charged too much per swipe and would not make an exception because we did not see the small print in the menu. I have never been to a restaurant with that rule -you either take them or you do not. And if that is your rule, you have signs all over the place explaining it.

On a recent visit, my mother-in-law had a special of fresh housemade linguine with seared scallops in a light tomato-roasted garlic cream sauce that was so good.  Maybe that can become a regular offering?",0.9822,0.754,0.231,0.015,0.5516677440206851

2012-12-17,4.0,"What a nice little place!  Started off with the Insalata Caprese, and everything about it was fresh and delicious! There's not much more to say about 4 uncooked ingredients except that it was fresh, well portioned, and well put together. This was a delicious pair along with the fresh (warm) bread and tapenade that is brought complimentary.  I ordered the California Zinfandel and my date had the Washington Merlot. Both were exceptionally dark, deep, and fruity.  The capellini looked like it was fresh, cooked well, and came served with a basic tomato and basil gravy. My date seemed to love it.  My Ravioli with veal in a cream sauce was incredible, if a bit heavy. I was actually very shocked to see how large the portions were, I was expecting a smaller dish, but as I finish up my leftovers now, I'm glad it was sizable! I'm actually inclined to say it was even better the next day (just warmed up in a dry pan for a few minutes. definitely do this).  Dessert was the main reason we came here, as my date was craving cheesecake. It was homemade, very creamy, a little more sour than your typical ""Eli's"" cheesecake, had an amazing raspberry sauce (chocolate is also available) drizzled over it, and I want more of it right now. It was delicious.  I opted for the tiramisu, and that was unfortunately the only part of the meal I was disappointed with. The portion was huge, but the flavor just wasn't there, it was rather bland.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because service was pretty slow (10-15 minutes before we even saw a waiter when we first sat down, restaurant was more than half empty), and because any good Italian restaurant should NAIL the tiramisu, in my opinion.  I will definitely go back, and would recommend this place to anyone for a nice comfortable yet slightly classy Sunday dinner with a date.

2012-07-17,5.0,"if I could give more stars I would! My boyfriend and I went there one evening, for no special reason, we just wanted to go somewhere different. After clicking around on yelp and a couple of other dining websites I randomly chose Buona Terra as our restaurant for the evening. Might I say WE LOVED IT! Typically when my boyfriend and I go into a restaurant we play a game of sorts, we are in no financial position to do this, but we say, 'if we were to open a restaurant is there anything we would replicate?' My boyfriend said it perfectly, 'they do it so well, I'd just lease the space and tell them to run the restaurant'... The staff could not have been more attentive, perhaps because they weren't too busy? I don't know. We sat in the front room right next to the bar with a view into the kitchen but never felt like we were being crowded out. There is a second room, but I never got that far. Now for the food, I was immediately won over by the warm bread and garlic/ olive oil spread, I will say, we finished the basket in minutes. Then came our appetizer, and it came out REALLY fast. We tried the prosciutto wrapped around mozzarella, it was really frickin' good. At this point I was already won over. Then our pasta dishes came out... HOLY SMOKES was it good! My boyfriend had the veal stuffed ravioli served in a brandy sauce. I stole a couple, they were amazing. I had the rigatoni, not as good as his, but still REALLY good. Our desserts (Tiramisu and the special Panna cotta) were both really good. The tiramisu was clearly home made, or at least incredibly fresh, the lady fingers didn't seem doused in espresso to hide the flavor, rather they seemed fresh and flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the Panna Cotta (he only let me have a small spoonful so I can't comment much on his :-) ), but the speed at which he devoured it, it must have been amazing. Our bill ended up being $62 for an appetizer, two pasta dishes, two desserts, and two beers... And we tacked on $15 for tip because our server was amazing A little background about us- I will say that we are two people who eat out almost every meal, we have both traveled extensively.

2012-04-15,1.0,"Went to Chicago for a very special occasion, and decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal at a highly-rated eatery. I'm regretful it was this one. Food was OK. Got the bill and it was $55 (pre-tip) for two people. I saw they had charged me twice for my Coke. I asked the waiter why that was, and he said I'd asked for a refill, and they don't give free refills. So first off-- what? No free refills? On a $2.50 soda that cost you mere pennies on the dollar? Where are we, North Korea?  Secondly, couldn't you have stated that on the menu? Like, put the fountain drinks under a ""For Suckas Only"" section. OR... if that's too much trouble, perhaps you could just clarify that policy of insanity when I'd asked for a refill? You know, just a quick ""we don't give complimentary refills, though I would gladly bring you another if you'd like!"" So, no big deal... I should be able to clarify the situation with the manager and have this little misunderstanding addressed. Our waiter wasn't clear-- the menu didn't communicate this ridiculousness, so seeing as we spent a decent amount on dinner they should be able to accommodate the prompt removal of said charge, right? Wrong. I was greeted with a terse, disinterested and ultimately insulting explanation by the owner/manager that she'd NEVER had anyone have any issues with the policy, and this is the first complaint EVER. She then proceeded to attempt a dig on my apparently slum-ridden dining experiences, in pointing out that this isn't ""THAT KIND OF PLACE"" as to give free refills on fountain drinks. As if every restaurant in the western world from McDonald's to Morton's doesn't do this given the obvious crazy-high margins enjoyed on such a product. Perhaps it is just me though and this was just some very, very special soda thus resulting in their policy, though m'thinks that it should have been appropriately labeled on the menu just the same. I suggest you save yourself from the faux-quaint air of superiority that will choke you as you try to enjoy your $2.50 soda. Just be sure not to ask for a refill. ---- EDIT & NOTE TO OWNER: I've removed the section of my review regarding the owner/manager saying she'd ""take it out of the tips"" to refund my money. The business owner responded to this review and claimed she didn't say it--she has clarified she said ""take it out of the till"", which apparently means ""cash register"". So that was my mistake as I mis-heard her. I want to be fair, so I've redacted that portion of the review. Unfortunately, there was no further misunderstanding here; just an unpleasant experience centered around soft drinks. Also, note to Eileen (owner): Perceived value is not something you define for your customers; it's the other way around. This review focused on the lack of clarity of your policy and the lengths I had to go through to right the wrong. If you have the opportunity to turn a bad customer experience into a good one and all it takes is a few cents worth of sugar water, I believe it's an inexpensive win for you and your business and you should jump on that opportunity. Finally, a little upfront clarity about your policy could have completely preempted this negative review.",-0.837,0.783,0.103,0.114,0.5440623162845385

You can get very traditional Italian food here, so if you have a craving for some fresh, homemade pasta or some veal marsala, this is the place to go.  The prices are very reasonable, as most of the pasta entrees come in at $10-15 a plate (enough to split), and their meat/seafood entrees come in around $15-25.  You can also get an appetizer and walk out of here spending about $50-60 on food alone.  Burrata special was very good, but I've had better pasta and veal elsewhere.   Service was fine, as everything was brought out in timely fashion.  Probably wouldn't come back here, but could see the appeal to people who live in the neighborhood!",0.8569,0.899,0.089,0.011,0.4697252747252747
2012-03-31,2.0,"Dined at Buona Terra on a very busy Saturday night. Had a 5:30 reservation which was absolutely a must for a Saturday. The next available seating was at 8:30! Five of us enjoyed our meals. The eggplant with goat cheese was excellent as were the pork dishes and veal ravioli. Steak was disappointing; didn t seem to be a full 14 ozs. Service was good but overall, we were given quite the bums rush as we neared the end of our stay. We were not offered seconds on coffee and as we were celebrating a birthday, we may have wanted to linger for another piece of cake. We were out of luck however as our server came by and quickly scooped up our serving pieces and dishes. Within a few minutes, the hostess came by and said, "" We can offer you a free drink at the bar, if you are willing to leave the table. We really need this table.""  Well, that was a deal breaker for me. We had already felt rushed and now we were literally being asked to leave! The joke was on us however, as the bar area was completely mobbed, with nowhere to stand let alone order a drink. We left rather annoyed. My husband returned briefly to ask for a possible gift certificate for a future visit. He was refused by the owner who said, we don t do that. Clearly. It s too bad because the food overall was quite good but we soured on the service and hospitality.",0.9686,0.801,0.134,0.065,0.46147435897435896

2012-03-23,5.0,"We had a lovely dinner at Buona Terra on a Thursday evening.  I started with the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella; my boyfriend had the mussels. Both portions were very small. However, we also had bread on the table with a wonderful spread - not sure what was in it, but it was delicious.  For entrees, he had the ravioli and I had the gnocchi. I would have preferred the sauce from the ravioli on the gnocchi, but both were delicious. We both preferred the ravioli, but not by much.  For dessert, he had gelato and I had cheesecake. Again, both were delicious. No complaints.  We have hesitated to go out much lately, preferring to order in, because when we're at a restaurant we often feel like we are being held hostage while we wait for the check. So we asked for the check when we ordered dessert and were able to avoid waiting around to pay.  Service was also excellent.

The selection of wines were unique and they had a few micro-brew options which always makes me happy.

This is not a large restaurant which makes a cozy and homey feeling. We started with the beet salad and the mozzarella and prosciutto salad - both were great. For the main course, my dad had the steak which for $20, he said was great! My mom had the Rigatoni with sun dried tomato sauce which was delicious and I had a Farfelle with cream sauce which was good, not outstanding though.

2012-02-24,2.0,"I notice the many terrific reviews here and I hope that means that Buona Terra has its good nights and its bad nights. Guess I just got there on a bad one. But as for me, I'll not be back. Restaurants are selling three things: food, service, and atmosphere.  FOOD: Buona does OK with this, although I've certainly had better (and lots worse!!!). They currently are serving a pre fixe dinner offering for $22 which is quite a good bargain.  For that price, customers get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The menu is great, with lots of pasta and an abundant selection of vegetarian  entrees. How was my food? More about this below--see SERVICE. SERVICE: It's service that really ruined my meal last night. I was with a big group: there were nine of us, and I know serving a group that size isn't easy. (But servers do make sure they get compensated for their efforts with a group that size, right? You know, the almost universal practice of automatically including a service charge?) Order taking went great, and there was no problem with busboy service at any time during our meal.  The thing is, when I go to a restaurant, I think that waiters, who talk with customers and take their orders in writing on a little pad, should, when the meals are served, have at least the tiniest clue who ordered what. They shouldn't stand at the side of the table and yell over the din asking who had what. When waiters do that, some people (say, in a group of nine, with me) might forget what they ordered and say ""me!"" when the waiter is standing there tossing out plates. And they might say ""me!"" even if they had ordered something else. And then they might really tuck into the thing, and even give portions to some of their dinning companions, while  the rest of us wait several minutes for our meals. And then, say, if I were the last one being served, I might get an entree put down in front of me that was NOT what I ordered.  By the time we realize what has happened and I speak up, our waiter pretends like he's lost his hearing (and maybe he has) and skedaddles away. Being of somewhat a good nature, I don't want to make a big deal out of this and I eat what I've been given and am reminded why I didn't order it to begin with.  Of course, this problem could have been prevented if my dining companions could remember what the hell they ordered in the first place, but it would have also been prevented if the waiter knew who ordered what--and HE is being paid to do that, right? Add to this, that when waiters add up the check at the end of the night, they shouldn't inflate their tips by including the sales tax as the base for their mandatory 20% (yes, that's 20%, not 18% which is what one more often sees). Because, see, that makes the mandatory tip in the range of 22% instead. Please understand: I am delighted to pay even more for great service. I often pay 25% when I eat out, because I know service people work hard and they are sometimes stiffed by cheap customers. But I don't like mandatory 22% service charges for lousy service.  Check this out too: the mandatory tip was hidden in the middle of the check, among the food items, and labeled as a ""Gft Certf."" How about telling customers that you've included a service charge? Is it supposed to be a secret? Maybe so the customer doesn't notice it and adds even more?!? ATMOSPHERE: The place is pleasantly decorated, with some nice art work and exposed brick walls. But tables are way too close together and the noise level borders on the insane.  (Go to ORD. Stand as close to the runway as you can. The noise level from the 747 on takeoff roll is similar to what you will experience at Buona.) The restaurant is located on a very difficult to park section of California Avenue, but they have valet service, of course. So here's my recommendation for Buona Terra. Give it a try, maybe you will like it more than I did. But if you go with a group, don't let them get away with the mandatory 22% service charge.",0.9669,0.859,0.085,0.056,0.5254046062869592
2012-02-22,3.0,"It has been exactly one year since we last dined at Buona Terra and went back to enjoy the experience.  The unfortunate part, it wasn't the same experience we had a year earlier.  We dined on February 17th at 7:00pm and were escorted immediately to an available table for two.  The restaurant was not busy and had several open tables.  We were seated at a table for two in the second room next two other two-top tables.  I was staring directly at a brick wall so there was nothing to look at the entire meal including the waiter who had to stand behind me.  Then the restaurant started to fill-up and two people were seated on both sides of us which made it extremely cramped.  The other tables mentioned the lack of space and that we knew we could all over hear each others conversations (uncomfortable).  First we ordered two cocktails while we looked at the menu.  Then we ordered two appetisers which arrived to the table in under 10 minutes which was really fast.  We then ordered our meals which arrived in less than 10 minutes....as we were eating we are starting to notice other people who arrived after us already done with their meals and leaving.  One of us ordered the Gnocchi Verde al Quattro Formaggi with Chicken (potato spinach dumplings in a four cheese sauce).  The chicken arrived separately two minutes after the meal was delivered on a separate plate that the waiter just placed on top of the dish with no explanation which was very odd.  I had ordered the Veal in a citrus white wine sauce with mushrooms and fontina cheese added which was prettty good and a decent portion.  We were in and out of the restaurant in under 50 minutes from cocktail to appetiser to meal and felt VERY rushed and crowded at our table.  A year earlier, we were seated at a 4-top with a view of the window and were able to savor our meal and have great conversation which this time we were not.  It was though they were getting ready for the 8PM rush and wanted us out which was unwelcoming.  Overall, I am not sure I would run back.  We wanted to enjoy our Valentines Day that we moved to celebrate on Friday instead of Tuesday.  We may come back for the Thursday pre-fix to see if the experience is different, but overall -- 3 stars with a warning that you might get rushed.",0.3448,0.935,0.034,0.031,0.414709595959596

We had a crab cake appetizer which was very tasty.   It was the best thing we ate all night.  It was served with a side of greens.  We shared the Mista salad which was fine and pretty much as expected.  Had I known the crab cake came with a side of greens I might have just ordered another appetizer vs. a salad.  My dinner also came with a salad (Palio chicken).  It was kind of salad overkill.  The chicken had a too-charred taste to it that I found unappealing.   By the time our waiter came around with dessert menus I was ready to leave.  Considering all the other options out there, I will probably not return.",0.9843,0.826,0.153,0.02,0.5625514403292181

He then insisted we don't leave and that our table would be ready. I appreciate the attention and the quick response, however his reaction was actually very rude.

I have never even written a Yelp review (although I read them often) but I felt compelled to do so after two great meals at Buona Terra. So far I've tried the gnocchi, linguini alla vongole, rigatoni, balsamic grilled chicken, and the mussels. And ohhhh the tiramisu. I would order each and every one of those again if I didn't want to try the whole menu! My only complaint is that the space is a bit crowded and noisy.

Buzzing with so much activity that its exciting, the kitchen is near the front entrance so you can get a quick peek of their use of fresh ingredients that they hold as their motto. Friendly and attentive staff that checked on us a couple of times. I don't like it when some places do it so often that it feels like an overkill. All this is good but most importantly you'll remember Buona Terra for its food. I particularly enjoyed the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash in a butter and sage sauce.

2011-11-07,4.0,"Jumping Jesus this place is good!  It's been a very long time since I've had Italian of this caliber.   The garlic paste that comes with the bread is amazing.  My linguine with clams was amazing.  My husband's eggplant parmesan (crusted in almonds, sigh) and my friend's rigatoni with vodka cream sauce, peas, and scallops was--you guessed it--amazing.  Those accustomed to a heavier eggplant parm may be disappointed with the dish at Buona Terra-- it is light enough to be recommended to a dieter (there is no pasta involved in this dish, and the over all portion is small.)  For $36, the Valpolicella is outstanding.  Nice and light.   Only complaint-- our custom is to leave the tip in cash, not on the credit card, mostly for the convenience of the waiter, having spent 8 years in the service industry myself.  The waiter took the signed receipt before we left (a MAJOR no-no, very rude, and we had only just signed it a minute before and like any table of people who have just eaten their weight in pasta and spent quite a chunk of change on it, we were without haste but without lingering wrapping up our stay.)  Seeing that there was nothing on the ""tips"" line, he made a big stink in the back of the room, pointing to our table and talking to another waiter about it.  It made us feel very uncomfortable.   It was not a very nice way to end a meal, considering we were tipping him 25 percent in cash for it.",-0.7346,0.873,0.054,0.073,0.5557692307692307

The first positive point to this place is that I called Saturday early evening to get a reservation for that night & they were full for 8 o'clock spots, but the hostess still took my name down.  When we arrived, we only had a 5 minute wait before we were sat.  BONUS.  There is a bar to wait at but not a lot of standing room so this was much appreciated. Second, GREAT wait staff.  Knowledgeable, came around enough to be attentive but not an obnoxious lurker.  Drinks came very quickly and food timing was staged perfectly. Third, AMAZING food.  We started with the grilled prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella appetizer (not my fave, the grilling gave it a different flavor), and a caprese salad.  I tried everyone's food and it was all incredible!  Veal medallions, Potato Gnochhi, Veal Ravioli & Pork Chops.  Sweet Lord, it was all delicious!! Meats cooked just to the right temperature, lots of raviolis & gnochhis.  The bread and garlic spread they give you is awesome as well. Cocktails mixed just right.

The bartender (maybe the owner?) was very friendly and the place just had a welcoming ambiance. We were then seated in the back dining room which is a little less crazy. The wait staff immediately brought us warm crusty bread with a roasted garlic paste that was delicious. We ordered the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella which was so good! The smokiness and saltiness of the meat with the creamy blandness of the cheese on top on a tart vinaigrette dressed salad was wonderful! I ordered a chicken dish that was a pounded chicken breast served with a caprese like salad. It was melt in your mouth soft, well seasoned and nicely complimented by the lightness of the salad. The man ordered a spaghetti dish with rock shrimp that was also very tasty. A good tomato base with plenty of flavor.

We've always gone on Thursdays for their ""famous"" prix fixe menu deal - and I always assumed THAT was the reason they could never get their sh1t together. Because they were offering a good deal and were too busy to properly handle things. Nope. It turns out that they pretty much NEVER have their sh1t together. The hosts are rude. They give tons of attitude when you show up for your reservation and you're waiting for your last person to arrive. They shove you out the door and basically tell you to beat it until you're a complete party. Tonight is my 6th anniversary so my wife and I made 730pm reservations. We show up at 7:32pm according to my phone, and we're told it's going to be a 30 minute wait because they're ""a bit backed up"" and because ""there's a large wedding party"" there this evening. All of which has nothing to do with me or my wife. They took the 730pm reso for two, and failed to honor it. We stood around outside for 20 minutes sweating in the 90+ degree heat/humidity because the ""bar"" was packed. By the way, the bar area is tiny and only seats 3 people comfortably. We took our business elsewhere - luckily the night was salvaged. The drink selection here is poor, the food is mediocre, the staff is rude, and the atmosphere is bland.

Starting at about 1pm one day, my boyfriend began sending me texts and gchats about once every 10 minutes about how bad he wanted some pasta.  I want pasta!  I need some pasta!  I might die without some pasta!  WHERE DO WE GET THE PASTA??  So we settled on meeting at Buona Terra immediately after work because it was in the 'hood and we could get there quick.  We didn't know anything about it other than that, and at that point, my only aim was to fill the pasta-shaped hole in his stomach so he'd be able to cool the fuck out.  Little did I know how much I, too, was suffering from a carbohydrate deficiency. That green garlic stuff they put out with the bread is unbefuckinglievable.  I mean, if you eat it, you can never talk to anyone again.  It's like the Bog of Eternal Stench in the movie Labyrinth.  Touch it, and you will be forever shunned.  After that, we started with the beet salad...arugula atop a blooming spread of beets sliced so thin you could see through them.  Beet art!  It made me think of that one part in Goodfellas where Paulie's slicing up the garlic in jail with a razor blade, ""Paulie used a razor and sliced it so thin it would liquefy in the pan""!!!  I really hope they cut up the beets with a razor blade in jail because that would be BAD ASS. I ordered the title track, the Rigatoni Buona Terra.  Okay, get this shit: it's in tomato cream sauce with walnuts and goat cheese.  I KNOW RIGHT?  I wasn't even hungry for all of it but I ate all of it.  If my mom had been there to give me a speech about ""knowing when to stop"" or ""problem areas"" or something, I would have screamed LAY OFF ME I'M STARVING and heaved fiery tomato cream sauce all over the place.  Unchecked by guilt trips, I waddled home with my pasta baby poking out in front and spent the rest of the evening drooling on the couch. We've visited again since then, and wouldn't you know it, I replicated our order from the first visit to the letter.  I think this is going to be one of those places where I just keep doing that because it's SO GOOD.  This time, however, I set a bit of Rigatoni Buona Terra aside because I wanted to see what it would be like around breakfast time.  Ahhhh sweet sticky tomato cream and melty goat cheese.  They need to start making omelets with that stuff inside. Anyway, you should go.  It's soooo good.  It's so good it could have been made in jail.  And next time I go I'm definitely getting the fruit sorbet because I saw a lady eating the lemon sorbet and it came in a tiny lemon, I want to get the coconut because if it comes in a tiny coconut husk I will seriously shit a brick, you guys.",-0.9009,0.847,0.065,0.089,0.478481240981241

And yes that translates to their business (or should i say an extension of home). Stepping into BT feels more like coming home rather than going out to a business establishment.

He still shops for his ingredients one step at a time and still creates w/ his staff after lunch w/ the kids. Seriously, someone needs to make a movie here. True heartwarming story of how they live life and keeping business from getting in the way. What a romantic story! ok let's get to the food! first off the garlic / dash of heaven for the bread is worth a fed ex shipment - the look on my wife's face was like if you plan on living to the entree don't you dare touch my garlic/heaven tapenade!

I didn't feel wanted and seemed like he was pushing us out. There were 4 of us, dressed nicely, all eating and drinking-so he was going to make good money. Chill out! The valet was cheaper than most places ($6) but for a good reason. We were a little weary of the guy parking the car.

I look forward to a return trip to Buona Terra, and hopefully will have a much more positive review afterward. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I live around the corner from this place, and have heard a lot of great things about it. So for today, the day before Valentine's Day, my wife and I went to see how awesome Buona Terra was. Our night sucked. Well, I'm sad, honestly. Our waiter pretty much ignored us for the entire time we were there. After he took our order he didn't stop by the table, not once, to check in.  I put my empty wine glass, empty water glass, and empty bread basket on the corner of the table (which was on an aisle, so he was almost brushing into our table every two minutes). The empty glasses and basket just sat there. He walked past us ten times, not making eye contact once, not asking us anything.  Eventually I waved him down so I could have a second glass of wine.  Then, again, nothing for the rest of the meal. The food was good, but when your service is non-existent that stops mattering. I can count the times I've tipped less than 20%, because I've honestly never done it until tonight.  I'm cool with overworked wait staff, with hangover-ridden wait staff, with slightly rude wait staff. I'm  not cool with being ignored. i wrote a note on the check explaining my small tip, so the waiter would know why he got a shitty tip. I didn't complain to the owner, because I didn't want to get him in trouble. But I don't know if she would've cared ---- she was bartending and not really watching the rest of the house. The regulars at the bar got plenty of bread and service, though. Anyhow, it's too bad. I would've been a repeat customer (seriously I eat out way too much and it was pretty tasty) but the service was completely shitty. Maybe it was just a bad night from our waiter, but the owner/manager should be on the lookout for that too. Out of the maybe 30 restaurants in the Logan Square area, I've never had bad service until Buona Terra.",-0.5581,0.784,0.107,0.109,0.5388169191919192

Any time my friends are in town, this is where we go to meetup. We were originally attracted here by the prix fixe menu, which became a weekly tradition that has lasted a number of years.

It's something else ... warm, comforting, delicious and original. Whenever I'm feeling down, I stop into the joint for a bite of the butter-sage ravioli. It helps me feel whole again. Drinks: The drinks are also great. When Chepe (the owner) is behind the bar, you can expect a great mix, ask for his homemade margaritas sometime. He also has a great eye for wine, nabbing some fantastic grapes for THE most reasonable price in town. Dessert: As to the dessert ... it often keeps me at the table longer than the meal. I could read you the entire dessert menu by memory (hint: I still think their cannolis are the best in town). Plus, the staff makes a mean espresso. Atmosphere: I'm also not sure how Eileen does it, but the entire place has a remarkable feel. It's always the right amount of crowded and closeness, making it feel more like a community and less like a restaurant. It helps that this is the place that locals go for dinner, too.

I had some pasta dish that I don't recall, but it was also delicious and a generous serving.  Most importantly, it wasn't super greasy and drenched in the sauce like a lot of Italian restaurants seem to be fond of doing.  Then, the piece de resistance...the tiramisu for dessert.  Let me tell you, this was hands down the best tiramisu I've ever had.  I've had tiramisu in Italy and it was better than that!  I'm going back to this place again and again.  It's crowded for a reason.

The specials always sound so delicious so that's usually what I get and I've been happy every time. The fish is always very fresh. My boyfriend always gets pasta and it is always great! I tried a bow tie pasta w/goat cheese and asparagus last weekend and it is now one of my favorite dishes! Excellent dessert and cappuccino /espresso also!  I highly recommend Buona Terra!

2010-10-04,3.0,"I live in the neighborhood and have been going since it opened. The food has for the most part been consistently good except for my last visit there. I ordered the daily fish special and had a bad piece of fish. The appearance, texture and flavor were just off. The bread & garlic spread brought to the tables to start are excellent. I have also enjoyed a few different pastas that satisfied with fresh ingredients and are cooked perfectly. If you do order pasta the portions are generous so you may have some for tomorrow's lunch.  The bad fish wouldn't be enough to stop me from going back because I understand even the best restaurant can err. Read on....  My main gripe with this place is that I have introduced many friends and clients to Buona Terra. The last TWO times I have been on weekends we were practically kicked out! Well that's a fine thank you? .. We had a 7:30 reservation and they ASKED us to ""give up"" our table at 8:30. This was very disappointing because one of my friends was  in from overseas and I hadn't seen her in a year. We were looking forward to a relaxed evening of catching up over cocktails, appetizer, dinner, coffee. The appetizer arrived before we had two sips & the entree came after two bites of the appetizer. There wasn't room on the table. The waiter constantly interrupted our conversation - it was just unpleasant. We were looking at each other with (WTF?) faces..  The last insult came at the end when the owner asked us to give up our  table because they were so busy & overbooked. She offered to buy us a drink at the bar but there were no bar stools or even a space to stand comfortably & enjoy a drink without getting really personal w/ somebody you didn't come with. We went next door to Hachi's Kitchen for our cocktail where the staff were accommodating & we didn't feel unwanted/rushed.  Another thing that's changed for the worse is the value aspect. For example; the price fix menu on Thursday not long ago was $16.95 and now it's $21.95 for appetizer, entree and dessert. I did the math and if you order the lowest price of each you don't even save $1.00 assuming the dessert isn't more than $6.  This used be be such a treasure before it became popular. A quaint neighborhood spot that didn't try to rape your wallet.  If there IS a next time and the next time is a strike I will probably have to find somewhere else for Italian. Seems the focus is on turning tables and raising prices instead of good food, community and service. I really like(d) this place in the beginning so I hope they see this and do something about it.",0.9845,0.817,0.124,0.059,0.465265780730897
2010-10-02,3.0,"I had a friend come in for a visit, and I wanted to take her to a nicer restaurant for her last night.  Buona Terra had been in my bookmarks for a while, so I thought it would be a good choice.  Good food, almost good service, almost good atmosphere.  I started with the Prosciutto e Mozzarella alla Ferri, which was basically bacon wrapped mozzarella.   For the $9 I spent, I wish I had made another selection.  It was just meh.  For my entree, I had the chicken special for the night... Pollo Caprese I believe. It was served with veggies and mashed potatoes.  It was just A-OK as well.   My friend had the gnocchi verdi and I sampled a bite. I hate gnocchi and Buona Terra's was not good enough to change my mind.  And now, for the main event.......DESSERT!  We had the profiteroles and the cheesecake.  Both were amazing.  The chocolate and raspberry sauce on the profiteroles was perfect and gelato inside was smooth and creamy.   Unfortunately, after dessert was when our service went down hill.  Everything was perfect through our meal.  Pretty quick service and our water glasses never reached the bottom.  However, at the end of our meal, our waiter brought us the wrong check, which he took at least 30 mins to fix.  It was another 15 to get us the right check, and yet another 15 to get him to pick up the payment (I don't like to just leave the bill on the table).   I was ready to leave Buona Terra long before they were ready to let me go.  Unfortunately, they kept me just long enough for me to enjoy walking back to my car in the rain.  The atmosphere looks calm and relaxing from the outside, but it was pretty loud the night we were there (a Tuesday  I believe).  The place was packed out.  I'm not going to say Buona Terra could not have wowed me, because there were so many things on their menu I could try....however, this was not the best experience. Maybe a more positive update in the future.",0.9746,0.799,0.141,0.06,0.5704121572871574

Both are paramount menu items.   The Thursday night prix-fixe is one of the best deals in the city.  Appetizer, entree, and dessert for $21.95.  I recommend watching the wine you order, that's when you walk out wondering how you spent so much money when you thought it was going to be a cheap(ish) authentic Italian meal. They hold wine dinners about four times a year and I was lucky enough to get in on one.  The dinner included wine from a small family-owned winery in Italy. A woman from the family was there to explain the wine and the history of their winery (their winery was converted from a 1700's abbey!).

2010-08-12,4.0,"I used to eat here quite a bit when I lived in Logan Square.  My husband & I were big fans of the Thursday Prix Fix menu.  The food was always very nice, and it has a great, cozy neighborhood atmosphere--a low roar of conversation & enjoyment.  We've brought lots of friends here as well, and we've all enjoyed everything we've tried.  While the food isn't mind-blowing, it's genuinely good, there's plenty of it, and you leave feeling satisfied.  The farfalle & rigatoni are both very, very good, as is the tri-colore salad. My one complaint is that after a hiatus of a year or so (I moved to a new neighborhood), I thought this would be a great place to hhost a birthday dinner for a friend.  There would be 10-12 of us, so I called to make a reservation for a Thursday.  They said that 7 or 8 (the time I requested) was their busy time, but they could seat us at 9.  They didn't want a big group taking up their dining room during the prix fixe rush!  Why have a gauranteed group when you can have the potential for higher turnover?!  They had the possibility of turning 9-11 people that I KNOW have not been there into returning customers, but they turned it down & another restaurant got that oppourtunity (as well as the opportunity for an astronomical bill for drinks).  I didn't find that attitude very appreciative of their customers, although it didn't turn me off enough to keep me from returning as a customer.

Normally, my favorite part of a meal involves some sort of fat and/or salt....the fact that the dessert was the highlight says a lot for how great this gelato was.  My only tiff was with the service...it was on the slow/disorganized side. I was in fabulous company (the lovely Melanie S. and the debonair David S.) so I didn't mind waiting..however, I was very conscious of the fact that we were, indeed, waiting longer than we should have. I am told that usually the service is better..so I am giving 3.5 on the side of 4 instead of 3.

2010-07-27,4.0,"All neighborhoods in Chicago aspire for that cozy Italian restaurant, and Buona Terra launches Logan Square into the ""haves"", as far as this category is concerned. With its two room, exposed brick, linen tablecloth decor, Buona Terra places itself firmly in bistro territory, and it wears that look well.  The menu packs more flavor and satisfaction than you would expect for the price.  I was particularly impressed with the extensive veal selection - last time I was here I agonized over three dishes before finally selecting the vitella monte carlo, and I was not disappointed - veal wrapped in prosciutto covered with frontera cheese.  It was unbelievable, and complemented with crisp and flaky roast potatoes and crunchy broccoli. Kelly was equally impressed, both with a special consisting of grilled chicken breasts soaked in a mushroom sauce and asparagus, and the standard menu chicken - chicken breasts grilled in herbs with fresh tomato, mozz and arugula.  In both cases the chicken breasts were pounded yet deliciously juicy and tender. Many others have detailed the prix fixe deal, and I concur with their accolades.  In addition to that special, BT has daily dish specials, and this summer has been providing a delicious full bodied Italian Rose for a mere $26 a bottle, that more than stands up to the aforementioned hearty veal dish. But the deliciousness does not end at the main course.  For dessert, you would be committing criminal self-deprivation by passing up the profiteroles.  The gelato is richer than most ice cream in French restaurant versions, the chocolate balances between dark and milk varieties, and the raspberry coulis is rich and tangy. In short, Buona Terra provides a Northwest neighborhood Italian experience that competes with Rose Angeli's and Sabatino's on value and gastronomic delight.",0.9896,0.818,0.157,0.025,0.5656794425087106

2010-07-23,5.0,"Love, love, love Buona Terra!  The always-glowing Beth R. and I had a friend date last night. My friend dates naturally always seem to revolve around food.  We had tossed around a few places but it was the ever-resourceful Beth who came up with Buona Terra after doing a Yelp search for Thursday Night Specials (I just wasn't down with the vegan Korean buffet. Another time, Beth. I promise.).  I had heard of Buona Terra but didn't know much about it and since I'm a loyal gal, I always seem to stick with my tried-and-true faves for Italian: La Gondola and A Tavola. That will teach me to not be so close-minded.  Anyway, when she mentioned the $21.95 prix-fixe, I went to BT's website to look at the menu before I committed to going there. Usually prix-fixe menus are quite limited, so I wanted to be sure there'd be something I liked. I hate being limited to a choice of three appetizers and three entrees, but come to find out that Buona Terra has no such restrictions on their prix-fixe deal. And bonus points to them for using the word 'truncated' on the website.  Suffice it to say that I had the opposite problem at BT. There were, in fact, too many options to choose from.  Luckily, we made a reservation as this place was happenin'. We got seated immediately and started looking over the menu. Such lofty decisions to make. Asparagus soup, caprese salad, or carpaccio to start? Since it was too hot for soup and I just had carpaccio the day before, I went with the caprese and Beth went with the mixed greens salad.  We were brought fresh, warm bread and the yummiest garlic spread I've ever tasted. I'm fairly certain I ate half a loaf and would have eaten more if given a chance. How Beth only ate one piece still confounds me. The salads were great and generously sized. My caprese was first rate and nothing makes me happier in summer than a well-executed caprese salad. With only minimal ingredients, a caprese salad should use the best tomatoes, mozzarella, fruity olive oil and fresh basil, and this one certainly did.  For entrees, Beth chose the Fettuccini Primavera but I went all out and ordered the NY strip, which, priced at $21 a la carte, made the prix-fixe deal even sweeter.  We were both very happy with our choices. My steak was huge and covered in crusty parmesan and served with roasted potatoes and vegetables. It had great flavor and was cooked as I ordered.  Beth's pasta was full of vegetables and it was such a big portion that it seemed as if she was eating it for hours and barely made a dent in it. Again, I appreciate their portions sizes, especially on a prix-fixe menu.  We kept watching desserts go by us and knew that it would be a difficult task to pick which one to enjoy. I spied a few orange and peach ices served in hollowed-out frozen fruit shells and while I am a sucker for those, I ended up with the profiteroles. I love profiteroles: tiny pastry shells filled with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce. Beth got the chocolate pecan tarte (more of a flourless chocolate cake) and it was covered with fresh berries. That would have been my choice, but sadly, I cannot have pecans. Don't feel too bad for me - the profiteroles were scrumptious.  And the best part was the price. We didn't drink, so with tax and tip, our bill was only $32/pp; that is a fantastic deal any way you slice it.  And I love that they offer this not on a Monday or Tuesday, but on a hot and happening Thursday. I'm much more inclined to go out on a Thursday than almost any other night of the week, so they get extra points for that.  4.5 stars.",0.9983,0.782,0.173,0.045,0.5433547493071303

I'm a prix fixe lady, as many people know.  I love a good deal... ok I'm cheap.  I said it.  Luckily most of my pals are as well.  Thursday is the night for that, here.   After devouring an entire basket of warm bread, I started with the calamari and my gal pal had the caprese.  I'd already had a caprese sandwich for lunch.  The little squidlets were light and crisp and flavorful.  This app is perfect for one person for the deal, but I think if I were sharing, I'd be left a little unsatisfied.  The caprese looked good and didn't skimp on the mozzarella.   For the entrees we had the NY strip and the eggplant dish.  I hate eggplant, but my date cleaned her plate (ba dump bump..I'll be here all night).  My steak was a little overdone.  I'd ordered medium rare and it came out more like a slightly overdone medium.  I ate it anyway b/c I was dying of starvation, and it was still juicy, and the parmesan crust added a lot of flavor.  Next time I'd order rare.   We both finished the meal with a very nice tiramisu.   Our server was friendly, not overbearing, and the service was quick but not rushed.  I am definitely all about bringing my boyfriend back to try one of their many veggie options and some of the specials.   Also, I am a piglet and ate my whole dinner.  Yikes.",0.9557,0.83,0.122,0.048,0.5378348214285713

First time was Valentine's day and now for our 5th Anniversary.  Both times we were seated in the back room, which is better than in the main room (where it can get crowded with peeps waiting for their table). Like our last visit, the food was great. Can't remember what we had last time but here's what we had on 5/8/10: Mista Salad (for 2) - more than enough salad for 2 people. They even served it to us on separate plates so we didn't have to scoop salad onto each other's plates like Neanderthals. Nice! Farfalle alla Dominic - Very good. Creamy but not too creamy according to Mrs. Citizen who had this dish. I didn't try it because I was too enthralled with my dish.  Pollo Afumicatto - Chicken? Check. Mozzerella? Check. Bacon?!? Check.  Pesto? Check. Potatoes? Check.  This dish had it all. At first I was taken aback by how it tasted more like tomatoey-bacon than chicken. My lil' taste buds were all confused but then fell quickly in love with the sauce that covered the chicken. The more I had, the better it tasted. The pesto mashed potatoes were tasty too. Nice touch. My scavenger vegetarian wife nabbed some of the potatoes and really like them too. Lucky for her I'm in love with her, or there would've been a fork stuck in that hand that came across the table. Seriously, you guys, there would've been. I'm not even joking.  Anyhoo, Dessert consisted of Cannoli and a piece of cheesecake slathered in chocolate-raspberry sauce. So good. Again, the wife's hand came across the table at the cheesecake and I held back my animal instinct to stab the intruding hand. ""Hold back"", I said to myself,  ""You love this one and that's why you're here today.""  After that, my heart rate returned to 60 and we sat back and finished off the meal with some coffee. Here's to 5 years of enjoying great food in Chicago with my wife. Thanks Buona Terra for another joyful dinner.  All in all we got outta there for $63 including everything listed above, a glass of wine and a Limonada. Good value for your dollar.

However, they were fresh, tasted great, and the texture was wonderful.  For the main course, I ordered the veal medallions in a citrusy sauce.  The veal was perfectly cooked, and tasty, but I think that their other sauce might better accompany veal.  For desert, I ordered profiteroles.  THESE ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER EATEN.  My friend got some kind of fruit tart, and asked me for a taste of my profiteroles.  They were so good, I refused to give him a taste (hehehe).   I highly, highly recommend Buona Terra!  There are many less expensive Italian restaurants in the area, but - in my opinion - Buona Terra has the most unique offerings (no chicken parm here).  Buona Terra truly is a boon to Logan Square's rapidly expanding list of restaurants.",0.9949,0.721,0.251,0.027,0.5099333333333332

A perfect dress to slip on when your future husband comes knocking. 3. A consistent restaurant that you can get seated at with no notice. Buona Terra is my go-to restaurant for number 3.  My husband and I have been eating there for 5 years now, and it was the first restaurant we ate at in Chicago.  We've watched the place grow from having a few tables full on Fridays and Saturdays to a restaurant with a loyal local following that is always packed.  Since we do a lot of business with them, they are always gracious about seating us.  There are nights that we arrive with 10 people in tow, and are only able to call 20 minutes in advance.  They accommodate my food allergies, and when my favorite meal was taken off the menu, they made it for me anyway every time I came in.  Their stellar service and friendly owners keep me returning. If you need a little nibble while you wait for the main course, the mussels and calamari are my husband's favorite, but I always get the prosciutto wrapped around mozzarella and pan fried until the cheese is gooey.  It is served with vinaigrette on a bed of mixed greens.  They also provide a complimentary bread basket with warm crusty Italian bread and garlic puree. The food at Buona Terra is American-inspired Italian.  For dinner, I adore the Veal Monte-Carol, thin pounded veal fillets topped with prosciutto and cheese, simmered in white wine.  It comes with broccoli and roasted potatoes.  Heaven!  My husband gets the steak topped with a browned parmesan crust almost every time we go.  For an idea of their price point, the veal is around $18 and the steak is around $20.   They also do pasta dishes, and the favorite among our friends is the butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter and sage sauce.  Once in awhile they have pear stuffed ravioli in mascarpone cream as the special, and it nice and tangy, not too sweet.  The Capellini de Angelo is my comfort food - thin angel hair pasta served with a warm hearty tomato sauce.",0.9922,0.851,0.132,0.017,0.5294372294372295

If I didn't have to wear a bridesmaid dress the next day, I could have polished off a whole loaf of bread for dinner. Can I buy it in bulk or have the recipe?? Moving on, we had the Panzanella Toscana - vine ripe tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and basil in a gorgonzola vinegrette. It was good, not great. Next was the fried calamari. That was polished off pretty quickly.  Next was the Pennine al'Arabiata - It was perfectly cooked with just enough spice. I don't like pasta too much, and I thought it was delicious. For the main course, we had Paillard di Pollo al Palio - a pounded chicken breast in an herb sauce. It was very good and perfectly portioned. For dessert, we had a platter of pastries and cakes. Definitely try the tiramisu and cheesecake. I hear the cannolis are also very good too. Service was stellar! I will be back for sure... even if it's just for the garlic spread.",0.9915,0.791,0.173,0.035,0.526986531986532
2009-10-10,4.0,This is a nice little neighborhood Italian restaurant close by. I was pretty impressed with the menu overall and it is definitely one of the more authentic Italian restaurants that I've been to here in Chicago. The atmosphere is very quaint and there is a little patio area that is nice during the summer. The wine list is a little bit lack luster but the pasta is very good. Last time I had fettuccine with scallops which was excellent.  I was also pleasantly surprised that they had grapa.. yum.,0.9691,0.736,0.249,0.015,0.572037037037037

2009-09-15,5.0,"I had a wonderful experience dining at Buona Terra. The laid-back atmosphere with both intimate indoor and outdoor seating is a great addition to Logan Square.  We shared 2 salads for our appetizers: The caprese, which had thickly cut tomatoes and fresh mozzarella with just the right amount of basil and olive oil, and a squid dish that was served pan seared with herbs over a bed of greens. Both dishes were perfect and there was plenty to go around for 3 diners. For dinner we stuck to pasta dishes: The gnocchi verde (spinach gnocchi) served with a creamy four-cheese sauce, the veal ravioli in a red cream sauce topped with fresh mozzarella, and the rotini di la nona, which had mushrooms, peas and proscuitto in a parmesan cream sauce. We all shared and still went home with plenty of leftovers.  Finally, we also had dessert (cannolis and tiramisu) and the entire experience led me to believe you couldn't go wrong with the food at Buona Terra. Blindly put your finger down anywhere on the menu and you are likely to be satisfied. The service was great, the prices were more than appropriate for the quality of food, and there was plenty of street parking available.

Went for the first time with my wife and another couple.  The food was simply outstanding.  Not a plate was put in front of us that wasn't absolutely loved.  The menu is extremely diverse and clearly well thought out on all aspects.  This includes a very nice wine list too.  Not extremely long but still many good choices to choose from including many by the glass.  Being my first time I can't exactly say what a normal night will be like but I urge you to go for the Thursday prix fixe menu.  Now this is where it gets crazy. Most prix fixe menus are 3 or 4 courses with 3 options per a course.  Not so here.  3 courses ( app, entree, desert) ALL MENU ITEMS AS OPTIONS!!!!!!  Amazingly enough this included the night's specials too.  All for $21.95.  Grant it by the time the wife and I had a couple glasses of wine and a night cap on the way out we dropped an even 100 but it was weeeeeeeeel worth every cent. The 3 out of 4 of us orderd the steak special (out of this world) and all were cooked perfectly. Service was top notch as well.  Our server was very helpful on helping our friends on there choice of wines, giving us plenty of time to order and making sure we had all we needed.  A big thing to me as well now,  our water glasses never got under half full and finished dishes were gone no more then 2 min after they were done.   Everything was great.  Can't wait to go back again and try some of the pastas.",0.9944,0.776,0.197,0.026,0.5339994331065759

2009-08-17,5.0,"I tell you, Buona Terra was a wonderful experience. I went on a nice August Thursday afternoon with my special someone for our weekly date night. I was interested in trying the acclaimed Prix Fixe Menu which includes the standard three courses (appetizer, Entrée, desert) for a meager $21.95. What differentiates this Prix fixe special from others is you can order anything off of the menu - there is no special restrictive menu.  The food, mind you, is wonderful - for appetizers I had a calamari salad and my date had Bruschetta, for our entrée's we had the asparagus pasta along with prime rib which was accompanied by a wonderful pepper and potatoes combination and cooked to perfection. For desert there was Tiramisu and Cheesecake with raspberry topping (mix the two together for the most delectable indulgence of the taste buds you can fathom).   All of this along with two glasses of wine (I did not finish my glass of wine; since I am a whiskey man and do not particularly like the taste of vinegar passing my glass after one sip to my date) totalled the bill with tip right around $70, which is a steal for the quality of food you are receiving.  This is a great restaurant for family, first date, or old lovers (there was an old lady behind me talking about how she did not need a pillow to sleep next her husband of substantiated years). I thought the food was extraordinarily well prepared and the service was adequate but a little lax, which is fine and fits in well with the Italian tradition of not rushing through a meal. If you take a date, be sure to pair up your two orders so as to share - after all it is an Italian restaurant - it would be rude to not eat one another's entrées.",0.9754,0.839,0.131,0.03,0.5403292181069959

The salad  we had was amazing The veal was blah Steak was terriffic Both desserts were pretty good. I would give it a 4 just on the food, we were both happy and were able to try many things... so that was good. Where it failed was service and atmosphere... We probably got the worst seat in the house. We sat there for 10 minutes or more before we even had bread. Near the end of the meal they quit filling water glasses.

2009-08-08,1.0,"I've eaten here a good number of times over the last couple years, and have always been delighted. This visit was no exception except for one big problem, which I'll get to in a minute. My companion ordered the carpaccio, which was okay, but so overdressed with toppings (piles of capers, raw mushrooms and and parmagiano) that the meltingly tender raw beef was all but lost. I refrained from starters, but enjoyed the Melanzana alla Emilia Romana (eggplant) immensely.  My companion said the Farfalle alla Dominic was okay--mild, not very inspiring, but at least satisfying.  Over all, the food was fine, and the service was great.  We were not unhappy up to this point. Thenl the fellow who brought out the after-dinner espresso spilled the hot beverage all over my companion.  And I mean quite literally, all over him.  On his shirt, on his pants--it was a mess, and his clothes were stained rather visibly. The fellow who spilled the coffee was extremely apologetic and helped to clean things up.  But our main server showed no interest whatsoever in what had happened--never even stopping to see if we were okay.  Management never appeared to apologize for the gaffe either. When the check came, we were sure that at the very least, the espresso wouldn't be on the bill--but yep, they charged us for it. Because we felt compassionate towards the young man who'd spilled the coffee on my friend, we didn't voice a complaint.  But where the hell was our server, and why didn't he offer SOMETHING to ameliorate what is pretty much the worst thing that can happen to you in a restaurant--to have food or beverages dumped all over your clothes? Unbelievable. All of this makes me suspicious that management is vindictive and harsh here and the staff are afraid to let them know when something goes wrong, for fear of being fired.   If that's true, it's a shame--management should understand, like we did, that mistakes happen (we still paid the full bill and tipped properly), and learn how to make things right with customers AND have compassion for their staff. I'll might go back, because I've had great food here, and it's close to home.  But I might think twice before I do.",0.9399,0.705,0.164,0.13,0.6012669453054068

2009-06-17,5.0,"Ate here last week. After some debate on which neighborhood place to go to for dinner, my boyfriend and i read a Yelp review about the prix-fix deal for Thursday nights and, being Thursday,  we decided to check it out. This wasn't our first visit to Buona Terra, but it had been about two years since we last ate there, and for roughly $22, the prix fix price sounded perfect. We called at 5:30 and were able to make a reservation for 7:30 that evening. When we arrived, the host took our names and was able to seat us within about 15 minutes. That might sound like a long wait to some people since we had reservations, but I generally expect to wait up to 15 minutes with a reservation if it's on a busy night (fridays, saturdays or promo nights) and with the obvious popularity of the prix fix arrangement and at prime dinner time hours, it seemed fair enough.  The prix fix meal give you an option of soup, salad or appetizer as a first course, then your entree, followed by dessert...all for $22. Really one of the best deals in the city. My bf and I each ordered a glass of wine and I chose the grilled calamari, while he ordered the baby octopus. Both were nice app-size portions for 1-2 servings and both were grilled to perfection. I had a grilled salmon entree, served with capers and white wine sauce, potatoes and broccoli (this was one of the daily specials). The salmon was the perfect temperature, and while the potatoes could have used a little extra seasoning, this dish tasted great.  The best part? Dessert. I ordered a chocolate pecan tart topped with fresh berries and my boyfriend had the pistachio ice cream. So, so good.

It is that fricken delicious. So let me tell you why ... First, you are in trendy Logan Square, which that alone gets you some points. There is decent street parking. They make reservations which is awesome, because it is a smaller restaurant. As everyone has said, you have the Thursday price-fixed menu, which rocks. Now, on to the food ... Ok, when you sit down you get fresh bread with this garlic parmesean dipping sauce. The bread is always warm, with a crunchy exterior and soft middle, perfection! However, bring extra shorts, because you will mess the first pair when you try this dipping sauce. As I said, it is a combo of garlic, parm, olive oil and just plain goodness. I found myself dipping everything into it. I was hard pressed not to ruin my appetite on that bread. YUM. Ugh I want it now. Do they deliver dipping sauce? So next, we ordered the wrapped mozzarella with prosciutto grilled and served over mixed greens and balsamic vinegar. I mean, if you can find something wrong with this, you dont deserve to eat. It is salty, sweet, crunchy, smooth, WONDERFUL. Ugh, I need that dipping sauce. I have had the Rigatoni Buona Terra, which is rigatoni pasta tossed in a sundried tomato cream topped with roasted walnuts and goat cheese. If you  will need a quadruple bypass surgery anyways, eat this and just enjoy it. It is seriously one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. I have been back since and I want to try something new but I keep going back too it. It is very rich, as a heads up! I usually take half of it home. Warning: The sauce will congeal which is mildly revolting, but heat it up, and its oily, but still wonderful. I have also had the Pollo Afumicatto, which is sauteed chicken breast with smoked mozzarella in a tomato and smoked bacon sauce served with pesto mashed potatoes. The chicken was average, but the pesto mashed potatoes were divine. My partner kept grabbing them off my plate. I was willing to leave single for those potatoes. I am still dreaming about that dipping sauce, ps. Finally for dessert, the canoli is great, and a wonderful way to end the meal. It is your traditional canoli - no surprises here. I have also had the gelato and it was refreshing. Sometimes I just eat more bread for dessert, because I have no self control.  This is a great spot for a date, a meal with mom, or just casual with some friends. I promise you will love it. Yelp's honor! Only drawback - No real room to wait for your table, and there is usually a wait.

2009-06-08,4.0,"Amanda and I were in the mood for some traditional italian food so we went out to dinner here on Saturday night. And it was exactly what we wanted. The setting is nice exposed brick big windows. The art is a little odd but not that big of a deal. There were some people dressed up and some in t-shirts and both seemed fine in the atmosphere. The staff was very italian. The gentlemen at the door didn't seem to speak a ton of english. The bus boy was wearing a white t-shirt and apron and reminded me of Adam Sandler in the ""Fresh a da pepper"" skit from old school SNL. (I think of all of this as a good sign for an Italian place) Our waiter was very attentive and courteous. He had some good suggestions etc. All of the food arrived as I wanted it to arrive and the glass of Italian red i had was smooth and delicious.  We started with the black muscles in a spicy tomato sauce. It was fantastic. The sauce was spicy bit not overly so. I definitely soaked up the sauce with the crisp pieces of bread that came in the dish. The muscles were large and plump. There were a good amount for a perfect appateizer. I then had the special soup. Gorgonzolla Cheese and Cauliflower soup with Walnuts. It was mildly flavored but incredibly delicious and creamy.  Amanda had the Minestrone Soup which had uge chunks of soft vegetables and a tasty broth. Maybe a little short on salt but I don't mind adding a dab. I then had the Chicken with Bacon and Cheese in a tomato sauce(sorry can't remember the dishes name but its on the regular menu not the special) It came with Pesto mashed potatoes and broccoli. It was fantastic. The mashed potatos were great. Creamy and just enough pesto. The chicken was perfectly prepared and the bacon flavor was just right. Amanda got Farfalle pasta with Spinach, Asparagus and tomatos in a cream sauce. And wow, it was even better than mine. Really a great combination of flavors. The thinly sliced asparagus was perfect with the farfalle pasta (sorry if I butchered the spelling twice). It was a big serving and she took some home. Probably eating it tonight. For dessert we had the Tiramisu which as good but not great. We probably could have done with out it. The interesting thing was there were meat dishes and there were pasta dishes and for the most part the pasta dishes didn't have meat in them. Perhaps this is normal and I'm just ignorant to italian culture.  But over all a great experience. I would definitely go back and I want to try a ton of the things on the menu. Most dishes are pretty traditoinal but some of the specials seemed a little experimental and probably make it worth going back just to see what specials they have.

For my entree, I had the veal ravioli with a tomato cream sauce and fresh mozzarella, this was pretty delicious and a hearty portion. I was disappointed to see that there were NO other pasta dishes with meat, except for one with shrimp. Other then that, it seemed to be all vegetables!?

2009-05-22,5.0,"Being Italian, I tend to think my palette for Italian cuisine is quite particular. I have always had my favorites, Rosebud, Spaiggia, Francesca's, and of course...Tuscany. I was so pleased to find an amazing Italian restaurant within walking distance to my house. Buona Terra is charming, cozy, and reasonably priced. The head chef was a chef at Tuscany so you know the quality is going to be top notch. I have ordered just about everything on the menu. My favorites include: Antipasti - Calamari al Tre Modo, Caprese, &  Prosciutto e Mozzarella alla Ferri Pasta - Rigatoni Buona Terra, Gnocchi Verde al Quattro Formaggi, & Ravioli con Vittelo (my personal favorite). Secondi Piatt i- Bistecca alla Crosta di Parmigiano. Dessert - They are all really good, but I recommend the Chocolate Pecan Tart.  With the recession, any deal helps. Buona Terra has the perfect solution to a tight wallet. On Thursdays, they have a 3 course prix fixe for $21.95.  That includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert, and there are no restrictions. You can even order the $20.95 steak. Now that is a deal considering you are getting an appetizer and dessert for free. This place is diffidently worth a trip.

The restaurant is what you would expect from your neighborhood restaurants, warm colors and cozy atmosphere. We ordered the carpaccio, proscuitto wrapped  mozzarella, mussels, and calamari. Everything was yummy. For my entree, I had the butternut squash ravioli and the second time I went, I tried the gnocchi. I liked it but the gnocchi and the sauce it camed it was muchomucho creamy and filling.

We were 7 hungry volleyball ladies celebrating the end of a season and sending off one of our teammates to nuptial bliss and her move to Wisconsin. We knew that despite a reservation for 7:30 that there would still be a wait to get seated.  Unfortunately they will only seat you if your whole crew is there and one of my girls was 30mins late.  So, we didn't get seated until 8:30 but the food was well worth it! There are so many lovely items to choose from on the menu and since we had a large group - I was able to see all the variety and taste different things.  I ordered the beef carpaccio and in my opinion, this is one of the only restaurants that pound their beef paper thin. I love it!  My only complaint about this dish was that the parmesean cheese, though plentiful, was rubbery.  They also serve this straight out of the fridge which in my opinion, is not the right way to do it.  Meat and cheese should always be served just a little above room temperature so that the flavors are more robust.  Anywho - still 5 stars because my the mussels were awesome. Entrees - I couldn't have been happier with my selection - I ordered their seafood linguine and it was superb!  Fantastically large chunks of white fish, scallops, shrimp!  Served PIPING hot and the sauce was light and seafood-y. Soooo good.  I almost ate the whole thing and it was huge! I don't recommend that you order the chicken. My friend ordered it and it was no bigger than the palm of her hand.  Everyone else's dish though, was generous in size.  The veal medallions were tasty and the steaks were good too. Desserts...oh my - get the tiramisu.  Yum, light, fluffy, espresso-doused yumm-iness all in one bite.

Secondly, the appetizers.  The grilled prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella is so insanely incredible that I nearly devoured the entire plate and then attempted to steal what was left on my dining companions' plates.  I mean, I didn't but I wanted to.  The calamari was also good as were a few other items that I can't remember, but if I had to choose, it would be the prosciutto hands down. You really can't go wrong with the pastas.  I've tried a few, and all of them were nothing short of delicious.  Portions aren't completely oversized but you definitely get enough.  In a race between my top 3 Chicago Italian spots - La Scarola, Rose Angelis and Buona Terra, I'd have to give this one a tie with Rose Angelis.  Sorry La Scarola, I love you and all of your old school, gangster charm, but Buona Terra has grilled prosciutto wrapped mozzarella!!",0.9789,0.816,0.146,0.038,0.5260850694444444

They don't mention the Prefix deal to you so you need to make sure when you order that you specify. Otherwise they just might sell you a special or something. What's Tasty: A lot of people have been raving about the bread, so when I tried it I expected it to sparkle and pop into my belly but unless you put the spread on it, it's just bread. However! That spread is also good on... Appetizers: Caprese: (Sliced tomato with fresh mozzarella and basil). It's ultra basic but really good. And as I was saying, put a little bit of the crazy spread on your tomato with cheese and basil and enjoy. Makes the dish even better if you want a more complicated flavor. Carpaccio: (Sliced tenderloin of beef drizzled with truffle oil and topped with portabello mushrooms, capers and shaved parmesan.) This is also really good. I'm pretty sure that the crazy meat is raw, but its so thinly sliced that it didn't matter. Entrees: Ravioli con Vittelo: (Ravioli pasta stuffed with veal in a brandy cream sauce topped with fresh mozzarella). This wasn't what I ordered but I totally should have. It was ULTRA awesome, and the sauce was great for dipping bread in as well, as it was plentiful. Pollo Afumicatto: (Sauteed chicken breast with smoked mozzarella in a tomato and smoked bacon sauce served with pesto mashed potatoes). I ordered this, and it was actually just about as good as the Ravioli, however I just wasn't entirely in the mood for it. The portions especially for this meal were absolutely awesome. The mashed potatoes were probably my favorite part of the meal, they're not too loaded with pesto but you can definitely taste it in there. We wanted to get the Profiteroles, because our friend had told us that they were like her favorite thing in the entire universe but YOU HAVE TO GO EARLY, we found out :( They sell out quick apparently.

2008-04-22,4.0,"I have a love hate relationship with going out for Italian.  Every time I go out for Italian food, it's sooo good to me, but then I think I can make this at home....I'm just too lazy. (Oh, and by me I mean my boyfriend).  Every now and then, I end up going out for Italian, usually b/c I have a taste for it and am too lazy to get the ingredients I need to make it at home. So, that is how I ended up at Buona Terra.  A friend suggested it and said that it was solid Italian food.  We made reservations, got there a little early and got seated after a little wait.  After I ate a loaf of bread with that amazing garlic/cheese/oil dip, we started with the bruschetta (very ok, nothing spectacular) and a Caesar salad.  The dressing was a little odd, and the croutons tasted like they were from a box.  Next, we split the veal medallions with mozzarella and roasted red pepper. That was GOOD. Very, very tasty.  If you don't like the super thin meat, then you won't like this, but it was great to me!  For our pasta, we had the pasta Buona Terra.  It had walnuts and goat cheese in a tomato cream sauce.  Then, we ended the meal with the profiteroles. Yum! Everything was really good and moderately priced. It is great to go with someone and split everything, that way you get a great amount of food and you get to sample a lot of everything.  With a glass of wine and a bottle of San Pelligrino, it ended up being about 62 without tip.  Given the amount of food we had, it wasn't that bad. One thing though, I wouldn't really suggest taking the pasta home with you if you don't finish it.  It was really rich when I was eating it, and I remember thinking....hmmmmm there must be a TON of butter, oil, cream in this thing.  Fast forward the next day  when I take it out, and there is a nice thick layer of fat.....yuck.  Save yourself from the guilt...leave it there, better yet, finish it!",0.9967,0.766,0.195,0.039,0.5098931623931624

The mixture of the creamy sundried tomato sauce with the walnuts and goat cheese was great. We then split the profiteroles for dessert.  Each portion of our meal was delicious.

Maybe it was a total fluke, but this is the only time in my life I have been served food that was bad enough to send back to the kitchen.  I tried to eat it, because I didn't want to be a bitch, but I gagged every time I tried another bite.  I got the fettucine primavera, and it tasted as if the ""light tomato"" sauce was half fermented, or the pan it was cooked in was first soaking in dirty sweat sock juice. Even worse was the way this place reacted to the dry heave situation.  They pretty much pretended that nothing was wrong at all, and I left feeling as if I had been treated very badly.  The waiter asked why I didn't eat the pasta, I told him, then he said he would talk to the owner (who didn't bother him/herself with me at all) and then he came back to quickly slip a check on the table with not another word.  Not even thank you.  Their reaction showed absolutely no pride in their food or establishment.   I am not a person who enjoys being involved in (or observing) dramatic scenes, and because of this Buona Terra took my money and let me leave hungry with a bad taste in my mouth.  I wouldn't go back even if someone paid me a thousand dollars, maybe for a million, but food poisoning isn't THAT bad.....right?  Beware, don't even try it!",-0.9851,0.758,0.068,0.174,0.5282608695652173

2008-03-10,4.0,"I'm sort of conflicted about what kind of review to give Buona Terra. I went here on Saturday night with 2 girlfriends for a birthday celebration (not mine). We had a 7:30 reservation, and due to the fact that I was waiting on the birthday girl before heading out, we were a bit late-though one member of our party was already there.  Parking was pretty easy though, which I certainly appreciate. Anyway we got there at around 7:45, and like everyone else has noted, we still had to wait. This place is tiny! And cramped! But I guess that's part of the charm. . .  We were under the impression that it was BYOB (as per the Yelp listing), so we brought a bottle of wine- a rather sizeable bottle at that.  Upon presenting it to the waiter, he told us he would have to talk to the owner to find out how much to charge us for corkage. Apparently a bigger bottle = a bigger fee? He came back to tell us that the fee would be $20. Whaaaa???? Despite our best efforts to convince him that even though it may have the volume of 2 bottles he would still only have to cork it once, he wouldn't budge.  Rather than pay twice the value of the wine (yeah, it was $11. That's how we roll) we just ordered off of the pretty substantial wine list.  This was off-putting to say the least, but looking back now I'm not sure it's the fault of the restaurant. When I came home I looked at the website to find where it said it was BYOB and couldn't find it anywhere.  I guess we were lead astray by Yelp! Once we got over this snafu, we ate. The food was really quite good. We started with a Caesar salad and a grilled prosciutto app.  The salad was very fresh and crisp, but the prosciutto was reeeaaallly salty. No one else seemed to mind though.  For entrees, I had the grilled chicken with arugula and mozzarella- delicious! Very light and flavorful, great for those of us who may be watching our girlish figures.  My friends had the butternut squash ravioli and the rigatoni with goat cheese- both seemed very pleased with their choices.  Dessert was pretty blah- we shared a cannoli which I'm pretty sure was not made in-house. I could be wrong, but the sorbets are served in fruit cups which always reeks of 'store-bought.'  All in all, it's a nice diamond-in-the-rough kind of place. Word to the wise- don't bring your own wine.",0.9931,0.795,0.154,0.051,0.6980062530062529

Let me start off by saying that ""very garlicy"" is a good thing. I would never say that anything here is too garlicy. One of the best things about this place is the bread and oil you get before you even start eating. It's your typical olive oil and parmesean but with it's own Logan Square flavor; I think they chop up little bits of jalapeno peppers and basil and so with the delicious bread and some wine, it can me a meal on its own. I only get two dishes here because they are both great. Typically I get the Rigatoni with goat cheese, creamy tomato sauce and walnuts. It also travels well and is good as a take out assuming you don't live in Aurora and have to sit in rush hour traffic. The other thing I like is the parmesean crusted steak. I think its a T-Bone or something like that. I don't generally care for plain steak but the parmesean sets it off.

My friend and I shared a beautiful appetizer: thinly sliced beets with arugula (balsamic vinaigrette) and goat cheese. My main course was the farfalle alla Dominick, and holy crap, it was good. Farfalle with ricotta, asparagus and spinach... it was surprisingly light and perfect. I kept thinking to myself, ""Why haven't I thought of this?"" It's simple, but the balance of flavors was somehow revelatory. In the past, I've had the spinach gnocchi in a four cheese sauce and the butternut squash sauteed with butter and sage, but I kind of doubt I'll ever have anything ever again besides the farfalle alla Dominick.",0.991,0.729,0.233,0.038,0.6073412698412698

After the main course, I went across the street and had time to pick out a bottle of wine, chat with the owner, and when I came back there was still no dessert.          This may be an exception as it was a VERY busy thursday night.

I went on a Sunday night instead. Service was very slow, as there were 4 other tables w/ one server and one bus boy. I never saw our waiter really move around with any sort of sense of urgency.  The bread was just how I like Italian bread, with a crunchy hard outside and soft inside. The sauce everyone has raved about with the garlic/Parmesan was just okay. I think I could conjure up something like that at home relatively easily, as it seemed to be garlic, Parmesan, olive oil, and perhaps a little cracked pepper or peppercorn. Very easy, very simple to make, and I do think it's a nice touch to have rather than just the standard bottle of oil sitting out. I had the whitefish w/ green beans and sauteed potatoes. The dish was very good, the fish being extremely fresh and tasty and the veggies being spot on. My issue was with my date's ravioli. She had a veal ravioli topped with chunks of mozzarella cheese. The biggest issue I noticed with her dish was the sauce. It was as thin as water!!!! NOOOOOOOOO!!!! As a guy with an Italian background and a mother who can cook excellent Italian food, watery sauces are big no no's. The words I hear most often associated with Italian cuisine are thick, bold, and robust. This sauce wasn't even close to any of those descriptions.  It was disappointing too b/c I saw other people's dishes (look out for me, as I am always peeking at what other people order) and the sauce looked just right on other dishes.

It was a pretty decent experience, but I wish I had gone on a Thursday night for their prix fixe dinner instead. I would have saved myself a good twenty bucks!  First off, the tiffs: it was a dimly lit restaurant but there were no candles on the tables. I didn't expect such a small detail to bother me, but it did. The way our tables were situated, I kept playing chair war with the woman sitting behind me - so that was kind of uncomfortable.  I also wish they had a slightly more extensive wine list - but at the prices (we got a chianti for $20/bottle) it was pretty solid. And now about the food. The bread comes to you warm and fresh out of the oven (a major plus) and the garlic sauce was exactly as good as previous yelpers raved.  I ordered a mussel appetizer to start, and I kid you not, the mussels were absolutely phenomenal. They were huge, plump, tender, and incredibly fresh. The sauce that they came in was a tomato broth. It was a little spicy, very rich, and garlicky.  I ordered their spaghetti al gamberretti for the main course, and it was decent. There was fresh spinach, tomato, and rock shrimp, but the mound of pasta was too much. They were generous with their shrimp, though. I was too full for dessert, so sadly cannot comment on that part of it.",0.9871,0.744,0.19,0.067,0.59765625

It's not really hidden away, if you know the neighborhood. There are a couple of other restaurants within spitting distance (one Japanese, one Thai), and the beloved Two Way Lounge is just a few blocks away. But getting off the bus at Fullerton and California, I didn't see much more than a gas station and a repair shop. Not auspicious. That said, I'm glad I did find it. The restaurant is very cozy and homey. The first room is very small, with a bar, some seating and some cafe tables. I didn't know how they were going to fit us in, until I realized the main dining room was off to the left. It's larger, but still fairly intimate. Our group of 20 filled nearly half the room. The prix fixe special on Thursdays is a great deal. 20 bucks for an appetizer, entree and dessert, all off the regular menu. Yum. I started with the carpaccio, which was a little fussy: shaved beef, parmesan, portabellas and capers. It was very fresh, well prepared and presented. But a little goes a long way. Next time, I'll probably go with someone else and split the carpaccio and a salad. For my entree, I had the veal Monte Carlo, which is veal medallions with prosciutto and fontina cheese. Excellent. The veal was tender, and the prosciutto and cheese accented the meat without overpowering it. If you've had a veal scallopine or piccata drenched in sauce, you know what I mean. Dessert was the chocolate pecan tart, which is actually chocolate tart in a pecan crust. Very tasty, without being too sweet. Although this is what I had, there were a number of other dishes I coveted. Grilled calamari.  Mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and then grilled. Panzanella salad. Gnocchi in a four cheese sauce. Butternut squash ravioli. Grilled pork chops or parmesan crusted NY strip. And many more possibilities. Service was a little brusque, but professional. Bus service was excellent. our busser was really on top of a fairly difficult table, and kept our water full and our empty plates moving. Since I had a nasty cough, I was grateful for the plentiful water. I probably won't be back to Buona Terra on a ""regular"" (non prix fixe) night.

I would definitely go back, but I'll choose different items from the menu. The one thing that was shining was the asparagus salad special I started with. The asparagus were tender but retained that little crunch that is so great about them. The butternut squash in a sage butter sauce was pretty good, but it was just too heavy. There was nothing there to lighten it up, no spark that really punched it up. Butternut squash is just really heavy and I could only eat so much. This dish did wake me up to the fact that I like sage as a spice and I should seek out recipes to make at home that use sage. I couldn't make up my mind for dessert and I went with the chocolate pecan tart, which did not rock my world. It was a tad dry and very heavy.

I understand that we did have 20 people and it is a large group for this smaller restaurant - crowded but cosy ambiance.  First of all, parking was doable around the area - looped around a couple of times, but it was okay.  We did have to wait a while to get seated but it was also more or less waiting for everyone to arrive. The bread was warm and really yummy - the best part was definitely that garlicky spread/dip.  I ordered the Carpacio: sliced tenderloin of beef drizzled with truffle oil and topped with portabello mushrooms, capers and shaved parmesan as my appetizer and it was good, decent good.  I tried a little of Mr.Slapnuts' fried calamari and it was decent good, too.  (When I say decent good, I mean that it was good, nothing to complain about, basic, but it wasn't like mouth-watering good) and I tried a little of Rachel G's Prosciutto e Mozzarella alla Ferri which was also pretty decent. For my entree - I got the Bistecca alla Crosta di Parmigiano: grilled 14oz. N.Y. strip steak with a parmesan crust and served with roasted potatoes and natural jus, when I was debating with the porkchops and the other ribeye that was on special.  I kinda regret it and wish that I had gone with the porkchops or the ribeye.  My meat was a bit tough and when I ordered a medium, I felt like I had received a medium well.  Rachel G pointed out that maybe Leang has received my medium instead.  For dessert - I got mine to go for Mr.Slapnuts to enjoy at a latter time but everyone looked like they were enjoying their dessert - Mr.Slapnuts said that his pecan tart with fruit on top was the best part of the meal and Rachel G & Leang said that their cheesecake with raspberries was amazing. Overall, service was pretty friendly and accommodating for our big group.  Their Thursday prix fixe dinner (only $19.99) was definitely a good deal and I was in GREAT yelp company =)  And the best part of yelp company?  Everyone paid what they should paid and we weren't struggling at the end to toss in more money - great thanks to BoA (Bank of Andrea W) and her helper Vanessa in collecting!",0.9991,0.69,0.28,0.03,0.5341145833333334

I'm a pasta lover, but in an attempt to be healthy (bathing suit season is coming up...ahhhh) I went the fish route tonight.  I started with the grilled calamari (delish!), the tilapia special (it was so good that I couldn't help but eat the entire dish), and then for dessert the chocolate pecan tart.  Ok, so maybe the pecan tart wasn't so healthy, but 2 out of 3 isn't bad!

2007-02-20,4.0,"I've been through Buona Terra three times now.  The first couple times, just to meet friends in time for sweets, and I must say, it was this most recent full-dining visit that has me SOLD and craving more. Outside of the unbelievable draw of Thursday's $19.95 -fix special: 3 courses- ANYTHING from the menu-SPECIALS included, our server was outstanding! He was so attentive without being verbally intrusive, quite adorable and generous.  (His backwaiter was also completely on top of it.  Kudos.  What a team!) I'm not a big bread service freak at all, but the garlic-pesto(?) spread presented alongside a sliced loaf, upon being seated, is FREAKING addictive! The wine list here is short and kind of sweet, but I do wish they'd have a broader Italian wine selection.  My guest and I opted for white wines by the glass in best order to try a few. My roommate and I started with the grilled octopus salad and their sauteed calamari.  I was so ridiculously impressed by my calamari that I barely forked the octopus.  Roomy ordered the filet mignon MR, and I banked on our server's favorite pasta recommendation: veal-stuffed ravioli in a brandy-cream sauce.  I swear I saw this dish on every table in the house, and rightfully so!  (It has honestly been -vividly- three years since I've had an Italian feast so delectable!  Then: LaDonna in Andersonville, Feb.2004.) We capped off the early evening with the signature tiramisu- give it a gold star * and also shared my favorite dessert choice: the decadent and dangerous chocolate ganache pecan tart.  Rich. We checked out at about $60 and hit the door with huge wine-induced smiles, happy stomachs and hefty left-overs only to hurriedly gobble them mere hours later at 2 a.m. I'd go back any day of the week and especially on Thursdays but next time with more friends!   More.  More.  More! I'd also advice making a reservation.  Buona Terra fills up quickly, and I'd really hate to get stuck at one the those [high-traffic-area] high-top bar tables! WEAK LINK: One hostess is stupid-shy on hospitality and etiquette.  Bad attitudes at the door tend to soil my 'moment' and make me HELLA cranky.  It's just too bad that an unassuming server may be the next to absorb my evil-eye deathrays after being passed off to ""Enjoy"" what could have been an incredible OVERALL experience.  (A server should NEVER have to compensate for a unnecessary hardly-two-minute awkward frontdoor exchange.)  Easily influenced, YES, but I'm sensitive to feeling welcome and/or properly acknowledged.  It is what it is, and lame for one OFF personality to taint the making of a smooth evening.  No?",0.9932,0.729,0.181,0.091,0.5745238095238094

Hmm, it is hard for me to give this three stars but two is probably too low.  2.5.  Had reservations, but I was still at the bar for a while, where I was told a beer was similar to Bass then i got a big mouth full of wheaty beer.  Ok.  The bread was good, the olive oil was fantastic when it was on the bread.  Less good when it is on the floor on the way to the restroom.  I slipped (but did not fall in it) twice, both times the staff saw me.  This was not taken care of; that has nothing to do with the food, though.  I love, love, love Gnocci; this is one of my favorite foods.  When I saw they had Spinach Gnocci in quatrofromaggi (my spell check really wants to change this to electromagnets. Haha) sauce I was excited!  I got my food; I was disappointed.  The Gnocci was horribly undercooked.  I should have sent it back, but I was REALLY hungry; I did not want to do so after I consumed half the portion.  It was not only undercooked, but did not have much...  well, flavor.  I know it is pasta, but the reason I love Gnocci is because it HAS flavor when compared to other pastas.  The Sauce was horrible: no body at all.  Extremely thin sauce, with no distinctive cheese flavor!  I could not taste any gorgonzola!  That's a strong cheese! It tasted like salty cream, and did not thicken at all through the meal. Overall just dissapointing.  I was sooo looking forward to this place.  Nice atmosphere.   REally dissapointing food after reading all the glowing reviews.  May give it another chance and revise...  OH!  The waiter asked if he could take my plate about five times.  I was starting to feel rushed out of there.",0.9897,0.751,0.167,0.082,0.4965686274509803

We started the night right off with a nice bottle of wine.  That went quite well with the nice and crusty bread (with a chewy center) served with some heroin laced garlic spread.  I don't know what was in that spread but they kept that coming and I kept on eating!  The calamari was by far some of the tastiest and most tender that I've ever had.  The prosciutto was savory and delicious. The main events were plates of perfectly prepared fork-tender pig chops (HUGE portion) and scrumptious filet of moo cow.  By the time dessert was coming up, we were already rubbing our ever expanding (and very happy) bellies.  Dessert's somewhat of a blur as the bottle of wine finally started to set in - suffice it to say it was damn good. Buona Terra is... how can I describe it... FREAKING AWESOME.  We had such great service and the recommended grub never disappointed.  I was pleasantly entertained by a couple near us - the woman was wolfing ... no inhaling her meal while the man was nibbling like a little girly-mahn.

The chicken breast itself had incredible amounts of flavor. there was the fresh tomatoes & the smokey from the bacon & the mozzarella on top of a tender chicken breast. The potatoes were a little too thin for my taste, but they were full of pesto. The wife had grilled pork chops with roasted potatoes. The pork chops were nice, but a little dry & underwhelming.

2006-10-18,5.0,"I typically don't rave about my favorite finds much, as it sucks to see a hidden treasure get discovered, and then get so crowded you can't get seated anymore. Well, it looks like that's happened already, so here goes:  The owners of Buona Terra (Eileen at the bar, Chef Chepe in the kitchen) are true pioneers, setting up shop on what was then a pretty rough patch on California Ave., just south of Logan Blvd. And that was exactly why I was curious to check 'em out when I first heard about them via some Internet listing I stumbled across.  Chef Chepe is Mexican (not Italian), and while he's one of my fave culinary artists in Chicago, let's just say that - at that time, at least - he had a much better command of cooking skills than the English language. So when he picked up my first phone call there, it wasn't the easiest conversation I've ever had getting info on a new place; regardless, there was something about what he said & how he said it that got us in the door that first time. And here's one thing that helps make them probably my favorite restaurant in the city: Incredible consistency, beginning with that first visit a few years back until now. Don't you hate a restaurant that's so loud & bouncy  you have to yell? Not here. Don't you hate a restaurant that can't figure out how to light a room so everyone can REALLY loosen up? Not here. Makes things easier to focus on the real star - the food.  I'm admittedly not a normal diner; It's fairly easy to flash out with the entrees or desserts; I look for the smaller touches that reveal a true kitchen master. In the case of Buona Terra, it's three things: 1. Their steamed broccoli is perfect EVERY time; 2. Their pesto mashed potatoes are wickedly ingenious (I've never seen or heard of them anywhere else, Chepe claims they're his creation); 3. Their heavy pureed garlic/oil bread dipping sauce is just too damn good to describe.  ONE LAST THING. The bar, baby. I always try sitting/eating there, which holds a grand total of six people. It feels like you're on some sort of TV show, with the bar curving around where everyone can see & talk with everyone else sitting there. Killer killer vibe, great way to meet folks.  CHEPE'S FANS. Turns out Chef Chepe instills rabid loyalty in some very heavy-duty fans. There's one customer I met named Barry who apparently owns food flavoring factories all over the world. He has a HUGE glass saying ""Barry"" on it, which stays at the restaurant, and from which he drinks HUGE amounts of hugely expensive vodka -on the rocks. But Barry told me that he wouldn't consider eating there until Chepe gave him a tour of the kitchen; apparently, it was clean enough to pass Barry's particular bill of health, allowing him to subsequently eat there. Did I say he was rich as hell? If you're still reading this, YOU MUST BE BORED OUT OF YOUR MIND! But do save me a seat at Buona Terra's bar - and make sure it's Chepe pouring drinks (Eileen is great, but when a great chef is pouring, it's something special in my book).
