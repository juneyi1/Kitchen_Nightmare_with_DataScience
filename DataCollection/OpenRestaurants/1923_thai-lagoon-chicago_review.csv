I got the Pad Thai with Chicken, a simple classic that is easy to compare across different Thai places. The flavor was good, noodles soft, but not mushy, veggies were fresh, and chicken cooked well. It wasn't a massive flavor rush, but a simple pleasant taste that is complimented by the lime nicely.  Also ordered the Chicken Gyoza, which was good too. Nicely crispy and not too hard or soggy. The dipping sauce was salty and a bit sweet, which is good. A lot of places have bland dipping sauces, but this was definitely not one of those. You can always dip less, if it's on the strong side like it is here.  Overall, a solid option when you're looking for something quick, easy, and not too expensive.

I don't think I have ever had a dining a experience quite as bad as this one. This was my first first time visiting Thai Lagoon, and thanks to my waitress it will also be my last. For starters, the entire place smells like the dirty towel my Puerto Rican grandmother insists on using to wipe the kitchen table. But because this restaurant was recommended to my bf and I by a friend, we decided to give this place a try, against our better judgment. We seated ourselves and a waitress came along with menus and water. Given that it was our first time here, I had a bit of trouble deciding what to order. I asked our waitress for help deciding and the only thing she succeeded in doing, was making me feel as though I was being difficult for asking. I decided my safest bet was chicken teriyaki. After placing our order, we did not see our waitress again until it was time to bring out our food. She never once came over to ask how we were doing, let alone fill our empty glasses with water. The food, as previously stated was nothing short of awful. I received diced up pieces of chicken doused in soy sauce with crinkle fries and lettuce. My bf's pad see eu was an overcooked bland mess. We took a few bites of our food and were ready to go. There are few things as upsetting as paying for bad food.

2016-04-11,1.0,"My fiancé and I have lived in the neighborhood on and off for the past 9 years. The other day as we were walking past Thai Lagoon we asked each other why it is that we never eat there anymore (we had dined there a few times years ago when we lived just a block away) and we couldn't remember. We decided to give it a try since we heard that they had a decent amount of vegetarian options which is great for us.  First we dined in on a Monday night. We were the only dine-in customers the whole time we were there. In spite of that, it took about 20 minutes for someone to take our order, and we waited quite a while for our food. I ordered a bowl of vegetable soup. It was OK, however it was barely warm...almost cold when I got it. The broth was a little bland. I would have liked to ask for some of that awesome red thai chili sauce to help spice it up, however our server was nowhere to be found. We also ordered Vegetable egg rolls which were pretty good, and my fiancé ordered a rice dish which he enjoyed. As we were eating our food the phone was ringing quite a lot, delivery drivers were running back and forth and a handful of customers came to pick up food. I thought to myself ""Ok, maybe this is more of a pick up or delivery type place, maybe thats why the service is so sub par"".  Fast forward to our next experience. We ordered delivery on a Sunday night through Grubhub. We ordered the mushroom wontons, a pad thai with tofu and a spicy basil entree with tofu. Our delivery time was estimated to be between 45 min - 1 hr. I hoped that since we lived less than a 5 minute drive away...that maybe we'd luck out and get our food closer to the 45 minute mark. So we waited...and we waited....and we waited. An hour passes...around an hour and 15 minutes later I'm getting annoyed...at an hour and 20 minutes I tell my fiancé he needs to call. He calls and politely asks the status of our order at which point he immediately gets put on hold for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes on hold our doorbell rings and it was the delivery driver. Our food had finally arrived after almost an hour and a half! So as we sat down we said...well...maybe next time we should just pick it up.  I immediately dove in to the mushroom wontons. YUCK! I'm a vegetarian. I like mushrooms. I eat them all the time...but this was just gross. It was literally entire mushrooms wrapped in a wonton and deep fried. Thats it, they weren't diced or seasoned or accompanied by some other vegetable or sauce. Lack of creativity aside, I could tell that it had been sitting for a long time because the only part of the wonton that was still crispy was the very edges. Everything else was just a mushy, slimy mess. No thanks. I then moved on to my Pad Thai. I take off the lid, start to eat and then I realize it's full of CHICKEN. Yup. They messed up my order. Even though it clearly said on the receipt and on my order confirmation from grubhub TOFU, they made it with chicken. I was so hungry at this point and wasn't willing to wait another hour and a half for a re-do so I did my best to pick out the chicken and eat around it. It wasn't even worth it. The noodles were sticking together in big clumps and burnt in some places, the egg was way over cooked and everything had this odd taste to it like it had been left to sit on a stove burner with the gas running and no flame. After the tiny bit that I ate, I wasn't feeling too great.  My fiancé said his tasted OK, but it was really watery. The portion sizes were super small on both entrees for what we paid. FAIL. I'm not a picky eater. I also don't expect a whole lot in the customer service department...but this was just ridiculous. I'm shocked that this place has so many great reviews. Maybe I just had really bad luck, but after two sub par experiences I will not be giving this place another chance. It seems that they are too unorganized and understaffed to run their business properly and there are plenty of other places nearby to get much better food.",0.955,0.875,0.075,0.05,0.4605555555555556

Reason is their Pad Thai - a dish that should be mastered by Thaii restaurants - is too greasy and lacks fresh cilantro and crushed peanuts. No texture and no freshness.. Tonight was the same not so great dish.  I had it with shrimp which are a good size, but were overcooked.  The Tom Kai Soup is good, but the chicken was in irregular pieces and overcooked.  And, they use button mushrooms, not straw mushrooms which will never impel me t give a 4 star review. Surprisingly, the best thing I had was their Crab Rangoon which is larger than a lot of Thai places, and most important, creamy and perfectly fried.  Delivery was fast, but it was early on a Saturday night and again, I live close to them.  I hope they improve and I will be a regular customer.",0.9697,0.725,0.193,0.082,0.5100961538461539

Go ahead and charge me for the TWO shrimp, but i don't want all that veggie tempura, i wont pay for it.""  She said, ok, i will check with my manager.  I was not able to enjoy my meal after this fiasco and the chicken pad thai was nasty anyway, it was clumpy and extremely salty and i think i only saw two pieces of chicken.  lol.  I'm surprised that this restaurant is still around for this long with this service.    ""TWO SHRIMP ONLY!""....Freakin shrimp nazis!  HAHAHAHA.",-0.9083,0.862,0.059,0.079,0.5753086419753086

We went with egg rolls, crab rangoon, pad see-eiw and the panang curry.  All delicious, all served piping hot right around the estimated delivery time.  The delivery guy even easily found my bat cave of apartment without needing to call for directions.  The egg rolls were actually surprisingly yumtastic.  The shell is more of a crispy spring roll shell, which was a nice change of pace and the filling was tasty.  The crab rangoon were just OK - nothing you can't get at every Asian restaurant.  But c'mon.  Crab rangoon is like pizza.  Even if it's bad, it's still pretty good. I really enjoyed my pad see-eiw.  The noodles were perfectly cooked, the chicken was moist, it had just the right amount of egg and the sauce was rich and sweet and flavorful.   All things considered, the bill was pretty inexpensive.  About $40 including tax, tip and delivery fee.  I'd like to try dining in sometime!",0.9916,0.781,0.205,0.015,0.6511806375442739

2011-09-11,4.0,"Mmmm, yellow curry.  I have to admit, the first time we went to Thai Lagoon, we were not so impressed.  The Pad Thai noodles were not cooked softly enough to really blend with the sauce, which I found to be quite bland.  Our next trip, however, got me hooked!  Definitely go with the curries at this place.  The yellow curry's tofu, bamboo shoots, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, basil, spices, and coconut milk (gotta love the coco milk!) mix into a great flavor and give the dish texture!  John's tried quite a few curries, but likes the Panang the best.   I do have to mention that service isn't the greatest, just because most of the times we've eaten in, there's only been one waiter working the whole (I'll be it kinda small) room, so you may have to ask for water refills. Also, while I love the yellow curry, the spice level has been inconsistent.  You have a choice of not spicy, mild, spicy, or extra spicy.  I always go with the mild, though sometimes it's spicier than other times.  One time I asked about this, and the woman I presume to be the owner told me that one of her chefs make things spicier than the others.  Just to warn you.

But somehow, things just haven't been working for me and Thai Lagoon. It used to be my favorite thai place in Chicago. I would order delivery or pick-up once every two weeks or so (which is a lot for me). But over time, the shine has worn off. It's not a bad place to eat, but no longer special.  Some of the dishes aren't as good as they used to be. Take the panang curry, for example. When I first started ordering from Thai Lagoon, the panang curry was nice and spicy when ordered medium, as it should be. Not burn the roof of your mouth, but spicy. The sauce was thick and full of jalapenos and basil and better than any other in the city. Now unfortunately, there isn't much spice, the sauce is watery, and there are typically only three lonely pieces of chicken floating at the top. Shame! And I don't get the sushi on the weekend thing, particularly when you call on a Friday at 6:00 and they ""don't have sushi tonight."" Oh, come back to me Thai Lagoon!

2011-07-09,3.0,"Meh. The reason we love Thai is because it is one of the most flavorful collections of foods out there. Similar to Indian food, you could wear a blindfold and taste test a variety of dishes and know where they were from based on the emergence of screaming taste buds in your mouth. Thai Lagoon failed the taste test, because it lacked in the staples of Thai seasonings and spices. Simply put: it had no umph. Pad thai is decent, but noodles were too al dente and the peanut sauce was liquidy and didn't hold. The Bangkok Saute was pretty flavorful and textured with all the fun stuff: tomatoes, tofu, etc. I threw Thai Lagoon 3 ninja stars. #1 for the cream cheese wontons (which are actually rolls, but let's not get hung up on petty technicalities that only gives transparency that this joint is Not of authentic thai food). You get 7 to an order and the crispy, sweet outside holds a barrel full of warm, soft cheese on the inside. Not bad. Not bad at all. #2 star validates the quirky wicker park/bucktown decor that one comes to expect from the hip-o-licious town. I'm not sure what's happening inside the place actually, now that I'm rambling...there is an evolutionary descendant of an abdominal snowman into a naked fox boy (pictured above), then massive Maneki Neko starring at you while you eat (which is Chinese, not thai, but again...petty details). #3 star......because I left full.  I'm not sure the appeal of the vegan/vegetarian options, because several Thai places do this, and with greater class. Thai Lagoon is good as a novelty, and a great place to hang with friends...it just isn't the place to go for ""the real thing"". Maybe next time.",0.9438,0.825,0.105,0.07,0.48485060690943044

The crab rangoon, which I trusted other Yelp reviewer's positive ratings of, were filled with a hefty squeeze of cream cheese and a couple little strips of fake crab meat. At first i thought it was real crab, but then i looked at it and it definitely had that uniform square and stringy shape of fake crab complete with the red-coloring on one face. My GF liked the egg rolls, but personally i thought they tasted like the frozen ones from Trader Joes, deep fried. GF ordered the pad keemow with crispy noodles, the sauce was not remotely spicy as keemow should be, and had a weird sweetness to it that was also really salty. And even though she ordered  the noodles crispy, they were waaay too crispy (for me) and the beef was overcooked and hard. I ordered the Panang curry and it was simply un-impressive. It too tasted like it came from a store and had very little ingredients.

It's unfortunate that the place can be hit or miss as my first experience with them was extraordinary having just moved to the neighborhood. But, I think the key to this place is finding a dish that you love that they make well and stick to it, and you should be pretty set. My favorite safe dishes: House Somen noodles - very tasty noodles with spinach and a delicious garlic sesame sauce, this is my new standby, try it if it's your first time! Pad See-eiw - standard dish that fares well, not the best I've had but tasty nonetheless. Mussaman curry - The curry itself is fantastic, nice spice and flavour, although the proportion of veggies is a little odd for the dish. I do also happen to like their Crab Rangoon, I find it very delicious and probably my 3rd favourite Crab Rangoon in the city (Indie Cafe on the northside hands down #1). Although a bit pricy, worth it. WORD OF CAUTION!!! They offer many of their dishes cooked either 'Medium' or 'Hot' Spicy. The difference between Medium and Hot is about as wide as a Taco Bell Mild hot sauce and sucking on a habanero. I can hardly detect any spiciness in a Medium dish, however, as much as I love everything super spicy, HOT will burn your mouth off... Maybe I'm just unlucky and they always knock the whole bowl of spicy seasoning into my dishes, but it's a little absurd. They need to offer 'Medium Hot' or something... You've been warned.
