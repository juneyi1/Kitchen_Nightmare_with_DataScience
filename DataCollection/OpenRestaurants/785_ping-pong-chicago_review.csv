2017-08-20,4.0,"Overall a great spot. It has a really wonderful atmosphere. I was seated inside but near the doors that open up fully so it has a great inside/outside feel. I had a cosmo which was delicious and my friend had a glass of rose and received a very generous poor. First we had dumplings and scallion pancakes. The dumplings were perfect. The scallion pancakes were great but they were more doughy than flaky. Next we ordered the bang bang chicken, lettuce cups and peanut noodles. The peanut noodles were spot on. The lettuce cups were very good just a touch over salted. The only miss of the whole night was the bang bang chicken. It was unbelievably dry and did not have any Sichuan flavor even though on the menu it was described as having a Sichuan peppercorn paste. Definitely would go back but next time will skip the bang bang chicken.  My only other reason for not giving this place a five was the service and the prices. At first the service was very quick but it took them forever to come back after we ordered appetizers to get out entree order and there was some confusion over who our actual waiter was. Finally it's just slightly overpriced for what it is. It definitely has an upscale atmosphere with upscale drinks but the food is just small plate Chinese -- tastes good but not overly fancy for what they are charging.",0.9921,0.763,0.184,0.053,0.5429279279279279
2017-08-05,5.0,"Ping Pong was recommended to us by our Airbnb host as her favorite local Thai spot. Since I am a huge Thai food fan, I had to indulge. Upon arriving, I immediately noticed the adorable patio area and large front windows that gave us a sneak peek into the romantics ambiance of the dining area. We didn't know what to expect at 10pm on a Friday when we arrived for dinner but our concerns were quickly calmed by the staff's impeccable service. While we did not partake in any cocktails, I'm told they are delicious. We joined the other couples that filled he restaurant for what appeared to be a late night date night. The service was a perfect medium of attentiveness but not bothersome. We ordered Crab Rangoon, Spring Rolls, Pad Thai (1 chicken, 1 tofu) and ice tea which was all amazing. One thing to note, we were not asked about a Thai spice level so both entrees came our mild but perhaps if you want medium or hot you need to specially request it. The table settings were adorable and I loved all the plateware. The cherry on top were the chocolate-flavored fortune cookies, complete with sprinkles. Our server even boxed up our leftovers.

The food came out promptly, and I enjoyed every bite of it (we got the cucumber salad which was so so, steamed dumplings which I loved, a fried pancake which was yummy and then my meal was the Chap Chae which I highly highly recommend...

2017-07-25,1.0,"I used to go here every week because I loved that they had a healthier brown fried rice. However, they lost a customer this evening. I asked for my usual brown rice and to add broccoli. They repeated my order back to me and said, ""and extra broccoli."" So I said, ""oh does it already come with it?"" And the person on the phone confidently said yes so I said never mind I don't need extra even though I usually ask for it every time. As I expected, there was no broccoli when I picked it up. I asked them to remake it and they did not apologize and ran into the back yelling at the cooks. They threw it in my face and said nothing when I thanked them.  I walked home and opened up my food to find that they not only didn't add the broccoli but also took out the green onions. I called and again was not apologized to and had to say something again because there were crickets on the other line. I was put on hold for 15 minutes to speak with a manager. Once I talked to them, they started saying, ""well I heard you said this."" And BLAMING ME! Even if I was in the wrong, the customer never is. That's the first rule in a restaurant. They did not offer to pay me back and said they will remake it and I said that wasn't an option because I already ate it and just wanted my money back or the next meal comped. They wouldn't do either. Sorry to say but I will not be going back to such a self righteous restaurant.

I ordered the sesame chicken which is $15 for a small serving. The sauce was overly salty and overly sweet - almost as if the cook just poured indiscriminate amounts of sesame oil and soy sauce over some chicken and then sprinkled sesame seeds on top and called it a day. The sauce was really thin and the chicken was not prepared very well - regardless of the sauce. It came with broccoli too but I couldn't eat it because the sauce wasn't good. It reminded me of something I would've made in college - back in the days before you could find 1,000 versions of any recite online and compare many different versions or even seen them prepared in lots of amateur and professional videos. I think they charge $15 for this dish because of the location, and perhaps the ""atmosphere."" But the decor isn't great either. Just a crappy mish mash of pan Asian things that come together in a mediocre or bad way - just like the food itself.

My date suggested hitting up Joy's Noodles (yikes!) so I suggested we go to Ping Pong instead.  The owners have done a great job creating depth and atmosphere (it feels faintly nostalgic and mysterious) out of what is really just a rectangular dining room. The cocktails are good, the free shrimp chips are also a lovely touch.  The menu has a large vegetarian section, which I was happy to see - I'll go veg if there are decent options! I had the Buddhist Enlightenment, which came in a bowl large enough to share and they even provide the option for brown rice (mine was too dry, but appreciated). The dish overall was very peppery but also very filling. My date had the Dan Dan noodles w/ beef and liked his dish too.  Overall, I'm a fan of this place because 1. cute atmosphere 2. the freebies (shrimp chips and the chocolate dipped fortune cookies at the end and extra side of rice with my dish) and 3. price point isn't outrageous, unless you are a big drinker, (my dinner was 18$ with tip).

The rice and quinoa is drenched in soy sauce and it's impossible to taste anything but soy sauce.  I can't stress how BAD this is.  Four bites in and we agreed to toss the rest. 5.  Spicy garlic steak.  Nothing to complain about or compliment here.  One thing to mention is that the menu says it's made with Sichuan chili sauce-- an ingredient I cook with quite a bit at home and I couldn't taste it at all.

It had the right level of spice and had a good mixture of different vegetables too.  Green Curry Chicken - It didn't exactly taste like traditional green curry, but it was a thai curry nonetheless and had pretty good flavor.  Masala Chicken - We had high hopes for this one but were let down. Having traveled to India and eaten at several Indian restaurants, we were expecting a certain flavor. The sauce had a very distinct cinnamon flavor, which wasn't masala at all. It wasn't terrible, but if you order this expect it to taste like cinnamon, not an Indian masala.

I think the chef could revamp the options here, given the place is pretty pricey. Oh yeah, last thing: the price. This place is expensive for the area.

2015-12-29,3.0,"Good...but not great! This is the first time that we had the pleasure to enjoy a meal at Ping Pong on Broadway in the Lakeview area. I love hot and sour soup and I hold Chinese/Japanese restaurants to a high standard based their hot and sour soup. I would say they passed my test. Would it be something that I would get it again and again in subsequent visit? That still remains to be seen, as it could be better.  I had the Mongolian Steak dish, which was good, but again, not great. There was a yellow type vegetable in the dish which was not to my liking, but I ate around it. I have had Mongolian Steak/Beef at other establishments, and as I recognize there is a variation to recipes, from restaurant to restaurant, this is something that I found not to my liking, but it did not kill the dish itself.  My partner had the Beef Pad See Ew, and it was OK. He said that he has had better at other establishments (i.e. Joy's Noodles down the road from Ping Pong). Nothing special here.  The service is good, and they are very inviting. The decor is very green all over, and the lighting is very dark. At the tables, they do put out real candles, but given how small most of the tables are, it is asking for trouble. A delicate wine glass or two at a small four top, surrounding a lit candle spells disaster, that if there is an accident, can get out of hand real fast. Not recommended..... As a nice touch, they do provide diners with a postcard to send to family and friends, which you can fill out and they will send to the recipient of your choice, already stamped.  Great service, so-so food, with a hint of blazing adventure..........be careful of the candles!!!!",0.9852,0.76,0.167,0.073,0.48631488631488634

2015-09-25,4.0,"Definitely a fan of Ping Pong after my first venture for a weekly Ladies Dinner Night. A couple of my friends had been here previously, so we headed down Broadway to Ping Pong. First the bad, but not necessarily bad: 1. there is a corkage fee of $8 per bottle, we brought one bottle and then just ordered another one off the menu. 2. you cannot do BYOB on the outside patio, which I believe is because of a law or some ordinance (I don't know the technical term). 3. it can get a little loud inside if you have multiple large parties (we were a group of 5 and there was another larger group next to us), but the ambiance was very nice. Now on to the good stuff: 1. the food is fantastic! we ordered the wasabi frittes and brussel sprouts to start (yum and yum). I ordered the Pad Thai and split it with my friend who ordered the Everything Fried Rice, both were delicious. My other friends all enjoyed what they ate so I would say our Dinner Night was successful on the food end. 2. the waitstaff was very attentive and I will have to say I know I didn't like the corkage fee, but he at least made us aware there was a fee, so that was a good thing in my book. 3. the atmosphere was great, if you are looking for something quiet and intimate it may not be the place you're looking for, but our group had a great time. Oh and you get these chocolate fortune cookies... so good. Each of us paid roughly less than $35, so another success!

2015-03-29,4.0,"I usually think of ping pong as a game that is played in a basement rec room, complete with bright fluorescent lights and a lot of noise. And me being humiliated by those who grew up with said ping pong table: the haves paddling the have nots. On the first point, Ping Pong is the exact opposite of a rec room. Enter the door from a rag tag stretch of Broadway into a sultry, pleasure den with candles lighting a spacious layout of tables with cloth napkins and non-disposable chopsticks. Four of us shared a table for six, wide enough to seat a mom at one end and a pop at the other, without their place settings encroaching on the others. For drinks, we whet our whistles with both ginger and lychee martinis, each consumed with pleasure. The price point was high, though the pour was commensurate. We then added solid food for our palates, starting with tuna tartare, a thick layer of tuna on a thick layer of avocado: we rated it four tongues up. I like to think of this combination as being classy and tasteful, like a Fred and Ginger dance of flavor. Actually, make that Fred and Audrey, with Ginger and Wasabi on the side. We also had the sweet potato maki, an excellent rendition at that.  For entrees, we shared ginger chicken, coconut curry with shrimp, and Singapore noodles. Each dish was good, but the curry really shined. Three of us had brown rice, and one had quinoa, that came in a surprisingly small portion. While we passed on dessert, chocolate-covered fortune cookies were welcomed, though the fortunes were quite lame. (Mine said, and I paraphrase, ""You will go to a social occasion."" Really? I think it's happening right now!) One miss for the restaurant: it's too loud. It was hard for us to hear each other (granted the table was wider than those in most restaurants), primarily because it is such a ""live"" room, with wooden floors and a tin (?) ceiling and nothing to dampen the ping pong of noise throughout the place. Candlelight and loud mouths don't mix. But the taste of the food made up for it; no bad dishes humiliated our mouths.",0.6556,0.865,0.082,0.053,0.4576769626769627

Still better than the other 2 dishes, but I doubt we'll be back to try anything else, especially with so many other options available in the neighborhood.

In fact, this is almost an exact quote: ""I can't do anything."" Nothing. Nothing at all. A similar recent experience with Mark's delivery in bad weather-- called to inquire about status and was offered a discount on the next order. Unfortunately Ping Pong doesn't think it has to be nice to customers. A recent dine-in experience was similar-- horribly slow service, among the slowest and least-attentive I've ever experienced-- but I'm willing to overlook one bad experience, perhaps even two if the restaurant tries to make it right. This restaurant doesn't care about keeping a long-term customer happy. No problem, hundreds of other restaurants in the area. Also have to let American Express know about this vendor's customer service attitude. Awful, unacceptable, never again.",-0.9828,0.742,0.073,0.185,0.5371252204585538

Turn down the lights a bit and make sure candles on the table stay lit, 2.  Hire servers that can speak conversational english and know how to wait tables.  It took too long trying to order a vodka soda with lime, and a beer.  Our appetizer order never made it out to the table, and when we asked about it, we got the wrong appetizer sent out in a hurry.  Also, before you take someone's food from in front of them, ask if they are done and if you may clear it... just don't grab... I had to rescue my soup a few times from grabby hands.  The food was decent... except I don't know why they serve giant hunks of half steamed broccoli and cauliflower with an entree that would be a lot better if they just sauteed it in with smaller pieces.  Also, the table settings are very busy, too many things on a small table all spread out, just stack everything on the bread plate.",0.9093,0.904,0.081,0.015,0.4757363104731526

2013-09-09,1.0,"Took my boyfriend here for a special dinner, and as such looked past the high prices.  However, we ordered two appetizers, the green beans (VERY GOOD) and the potstickers.  The green beans came out about 10 mins after ordering.  Then nothing. We waited almost 30 before our Potstickers came out.  They were good, but nothing any tastier than a well prepared frozen Trader Joe's Potsticker. But I was determined to have a good night. Then, we waited an additional 40 minutes before our food was served... oh wait, it was someone elses food that was placed before us a s tease for being almost 80 minutes into the dining experience without getting our entree. Another 10 mins and finally our food arrives. JOY! We are starving. I ordered the General's Chicken, which was tasty, but a very small portion (probably about 8-9 medium chunks of chicken.) My boyfriend ordered the Beef Potato Curry, and while tasty, the vegetables (carrots and potatoes) were in huge, extremely undercooked chunks.  Not wanting to wait for a new order, (as we'd already been waiting almost 90 minutes for our entree, he ate the beef and rice and left the big vegetables. The problem was that when it came time to pay the bill, I requested that they remove the Curry from the bill, as it was highly unsatisfactory.  And they first came over and interrogated my boyfriend as to what was wrong, including trying to cut the vegetables with the provided spoon, and when the server saw they were hard as rock, he admitted that they had been having issues with this and they would alert the cooks. However, they would not remove the item, as they could only offer replacements.  At this point, we'd wasted a large chunk of our evening on this place, and so the ""solution"" offered was hardly a solution.  We wanted to leave as by this point it was already 10pm.  So we paid full price and left.

Maybe it just doesn't have as much of the salt/pepper seasoning on it?  The calamari itself also seems different.   Well, the other dishes are usually all right and the cocktails are pretty good (though a lot of them are on the sweet side), plus the service is always friendly.

2013-08-01,3.0,"I have visited Ping Pong a half dozen times over the several years I have resided in Lakeview. Featuring Chinese/Asian Fusion the venue seems to change quite a bit across visits (and has become quite a bit larger than my first visit, swallowing up adjacent storefronts). They seem to have fairly recently undergone some significant renovations and are shooting for a modern, trendy vibe that they almost pulled off, but not everything comes together quite right with some of the furnishing seeming to be out of place. It vaguely reminded me of the decor of Nellcote, but not as elaborate or tasteful. Though Ping Pong clearly aspiring to be an upscale venue, it is certainly not the total package and lacks attention to detail in some areas; for example my linen napkin had seen better days and had a decent sized hole.  There is al fresco seating that can be a nice option on a warm summer night, but be advised the seating is on a busy section of North Broadway, so you will have people passing extremely close. We even were accosted by a panhandler during dinner.  The level of the cuisine is upscale compared to your average Pan-Asian joint, but certainly not near the level of some of the more successful venues that have sprouted during the past couple of years such as Embeya (my personal favorite for Asian in Chicago), Yusho, Kabocha and the like. Nevertheless I would rank Ping Pong and Chens to be the jewels of Lakeview when I am craving Chinese.  The food is best described as good, not great and somewhat hit-or-miss; I have found some of the dishes to be too oily (especially the mu shu pork, which is otherwise a successful dish). I did really enjoy the hot and sour soup that had just the right amount of heat and was chock full of tasty morsels in addition to the nice broth. Probably my least favorite dish here is the crab rangoons; lots of filler, thick deep fried exterior that overpowers the small quantity of crabmeat and a strange tasting dipping sauce. The meal ends with a chocolate flavored and dipped fortune cookie which is a nice departure from the norm.  Entrees are decent sized and generally range from $12 to $15, not inexpensive for Asian food, but a fair value for the quality and ambiance. My biggest complaint price wise would be the cocktails; most run from $12 to $14 - the type of price I expect to find at a Michelin starred venue, an upscale craft cocktail lounge with a notable mixologist or when I am in River North or the Mag Mile vicinity.  Service is as you would expect for a venue of this type; decently attentive, pleasant enough, but rather impersonal and all about business. Overall Ping Pong is not a bad option if you are in the neighborhood and craving Pan-Asian cuisine but is not a venue worth planning in advance for or travelling to from another neighborhood.",0.9976,0.814,0.16,0.026,0.5490929705215419

2013-03-11,1.0,"dined - Saturday 3/9/13 server - Jake This review will focus on 2 things: 1) service and customer satisfaction policy and 2) misleading food description and bad food, specifically the $20 Seafood Pan-seared Egg Noodle dish. We ordered several dishes which were fine, but nothing memorable. When Jake came over to ask how our food was, I responded with a shrug and ""it's ok"". I accept responsibility for not having been very direct and stating what was wrong with the Seafood Pan-seared Egg Noodle dish. However, ultimate responsibility for customer service resets with our server who is, from the customer perspective, essentially the ambassador for the restaurant. Jake didn't gently probe to get at the issue ""is it cold? undercooked?"" or simply say ""let me know what's not working for you"". Jake clearly knew we were not satisfied and instead opted to say ""well let me know if you need anything else"" - and then he NEVER came back to our table until 20 minutes later to clear our plates. If Jake really meat ""well let me know if you need anything else"", he would have at least checked in with us once in 20 minutes! Jake knew we were unhappy and instead chose to IGNORE our table instead of dealing with the problem. Jack's complete lack of sincerity in his statement was reflected by what happened next. When Jake finally returned to our table to clear our plates I politely let him know that the 2 scallops (yes a seafood dish with only 2 scallops) were overcooked and I also asked him to confirm whether the crab was imitation. He confirmed that it was indeed imitation crab meat. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  A $20 dish for imitation crab? I told Jake that we were disappointed as the menu description was misleading and that the dish was underwhelming. He said ""I know"" and then stated that ""unfortunately our policy is that I cannot remove the item from the bill but I can get you something else"". Ok where to begin with the problem on that one? Had Jake not IGNORED our table for over 20 minutes perhaps that'd be a solution to a BAD customer service policy. We were done eating our other editable dishes so we were full and didn't want anything more other than to get out of there so we ended up leaving over  1/2 the  Seafood Pan-seared Egg Noodle dish untouched. Offering to get us another dish at the END OF OUR MEAL is not a solution. Bottom line - if a restaurant cares about good customer service then it finds viable solutions to problems.

2013-02-15,3.0,"So I have been to this restaurant twice. I am always skeptical of ""fusion"" places but since it's steps from my home, I decided to try it out. I am charmed by the hot napkin they give you to clean your hands and the boiled peanuts they serve.  Very reminiscent of nice restaurants in Asia. I wish all restaurants would give you a hot napkin to clean your hands. Only the sanitary thing to do! Their boiled peanuts are a nice touch --- you don't find them around in the US since Americans prefer their peanuts roasted but they are definitely very popular in Asia. I would recommend adding spices while boiling the peanuts to give more flavor. The chocolate fortune cookies at the end of the meal is a nice touch too. The first time I went, I was in love with the place. I had the red snapper while my companion had the tofu pad thai. It was very late on a Saturday evening. We were hungry and seated right away. I think the red snapper was the best fish I had in a restaurant in a while. It reminded me of the steamed fish my mom used to make for me when I was a child in China. The light soy sauce and fresh herbs they put on the fish made for a delicate, beautiful dish. My companion also really enjoyed his big helping of pad thai. It was full of flavor and not too greasy --- I find most pad thai from restaurants (e.g. that of Joy down the street) to be way too greasy and boring in flavor. I went the second time on a snowy weekday. I had the seafood noodle soup while my companion had the pad thai again. We also shared the ginger wings as an appetizer. The ginger wings were overfried and doused in sauce that tasted little like ginger and more like tons of salt. The wings were halfway between a regular wing and a lollipop wing -- I guess the restaurant can't decide which. And the meat itself was tough and overfried. The seafood noodle soup was extremely boring and bland. The broth was so spicy that it masked the seafood flavor -- if there were any to be masked. My companion found his pad thai to be overwhelmingly sweet without the nuances of spices and flavors in traditional pad thai. I also had their lychee royale which was just cheap champagne with a canned lychee plopped in. The drinks and food were very underwhelming. It was also extremely pricey -- about $100 for our meal (which also included a couple of beers) -- just not good food for $100. I left feeling fat but without the jollyness that a full-bellied fat person should feel. I am not sure how to rate this place. I would give it a 5-star from the first experience and a 1-star from the second.",0.9976,0.8,0.169,0.031,0.5894414568882653
2013-02-05,3.0,"We came here on a Saturday night around 6pm and we were the only table there, but by 7pm the place got pretty packed. We got seated in the way back booths by the big window, and boy was it cold from the outside. I get its winter time, but seriously crank up the heat a little bit. The music that was playing was also loud and I felt like it was too much and too much techno for a simple Asian fusion dinner. I just wanted to have a relaxed atmosphere but the music was too loud for my taste. The ambiance was modern with a cool chandelier in the foyer.  The service right from the start was very good, they gave you wet cloths to clean your hands right away and our server was on top of it all night so I really liked that aspect of this place. The food came out very quickly starting with a bunch of appetizers and then the entrees all came out at once, which I like. Now onto the most important part of a restaurant, the food. I thought it was A Okay, nothing outstanding but nothing horrible either and here is what we ordered. Crab Ragoons- crispy, yummy cream cheese, but didn't care for the rasberry dressing, because I'm used to the sweet and sour sauce. Salt & Pepper Calamari-A tad on the spicy side but too chewy for my liking, but you do get a generous portion. Ping Pong roll and a shrimp tempura roll-The fact that they only have two sushi rolls on the menu should tell you to stay away from it since the quality just was not there. Tofu Pad Thai-Very good, probably my favorite thing that night, in an authentic peanut sauce, and a huge portion which I took more than half of home since I was full from the appetizers. Chicken and shrimp kung pao-my family seemed to all enjoy this as it had a nice kick and lots of peanuts.

2013-01-27,1.0,"So I went to PingPong on 01/26/2013 because my boyfriend visited with his friends and raved about their coconut shrimp appetizer. My experience was nothing to rave about. My experience was HORRIBLE!!  First, we had to wait for 40 minutes for a table to sit three people. It's a small restaurant and on a Saturday evening, a wait of over 30 minutes is expected I guess. But it was still a long wait. Second, we finally got sitted but it took another 10 minutes for a waiter to come by our table to ask for our orders. Third, we ordered two  Ginger wonton soups and a lettuce cup as appetizers. The wonton soups were TASTELESS!! They were just a bowl of hot water with some leaves and big blobs of noodles. Then, the filling for the lettuce cup was VERY SALTY. Third, we all ordered from the steak part of the menu and none of us enjoyed what we ordered. I personally ordered the mushroom steak which again was very bland. Finally, to top it all, we had stomach problems when we got home. Nothing leaves a more solid impression than visiting the bathroom after a restaurant experience. So I won't be visiting again!!",-0.547,0.9,0.046,0.054,0.46228070175438596

My guest and I arrived at around 8:30 on a Friday night and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  I was staving so after what seemed like eternity, we were sat and given hot towels.  We started with the calamari and I had the salt and pepper shrimp.  I was a bit worried because both dishes were fried but that wasn't a problem.  Both calamari and shrimp were lightly breaded and sauteed in garlic, salt, and a medley of aromatic peppers and herbs.  The shrimp portion was generous and perfectly plump and juicy.  Each bite was heaven.   The chocolate fortune cookie was a nice unique touch to the meal.  I am not a big fan of Chicago food in general but Ping Pong has me salivating thinking about the next meal.  Only one star taken off for difficulty in getting a table.",0.9698,0.857,0.111,0.032,0.5210699588477365

2012-02-06,2.0,"When one of our friends suggested Ping Pong for our ""catch-up dinner,"" I was open minded....and excited since I love Chinese food. However, I was a bit disappointed with my overall experience. And let me enumerate why:  1)  BYOB???:  My friend brought beer, assuming that BYOB included beer. Yeah, it didn't. The host came out to greet her and told her she would not be able to drink it at the table, because they actually DO serve beer there. So, they took her name and said they would hold onto her beer and keep it chilled in the fridge. (Remember this, because it will be pointed out later.) Shouldn't this, then, be called BYOW - bring your own WINE? 2)  Server Confusion:  We had a couple different servers approach our table, which was confusing. However, I guess this is good in order to ensure that your customers aren't waiting. 3)  Corking Fee:  There is a $7.95 corking fee, which kind of blows.  4)  Dirty Wine Glass #1:  Not only do you pay for corking fees, but you have to worry about dirty wine glasses. One of my friends had food (which I think was a sesame seed) floating in her wine right after the server poured the wine and left the table. We asked for a new wine glass, but it never came. Finally, I had to flag someone down to get our server to come back over. She took the glass to the kitchen, dumped out the wine and returned with another glass, in which the server poured another glass. 5)  Dirty Wine Glass #2:  My friend is now paranoid and checked her glass only to find something stuck to the glass AGAIN! We called the server over again, and she said it might be an imperfection in the glass and took the glass to the kitchen. When she returned, the 2nd glass was empty and the server was holding a 3rd glass. She then told us that it was the glass itself and took a long toothpick to scrape at the glass to show that it was not food crusted on the glass. So my question is...why didn't you leave the glass of wine filled, then, instead of dumping out YET ANOTHER glass of wine out? I mean we ARE paying corking fee, right?!? 6)  Dirty Wine Glass #3:  My other friend, who is now paranoid, checked her glass. There was something stuck to her glass. She took the long toothpick the server had used and began to check to see if it was the glass or food. It was food. So, we called the server over again and showed her that there was something on the glass. (My recommendation - Wash your glasses separately to avoid food getting washed off of plates, tossed onto glasses and then steam dried onto wine glasses!) 7)  Noise Level:  The space is decorated very cutely and I liked the mood lighting; however, I really had a hard time hearing my friends as they were speaking, because noise just seemed to bounce all over the place there. 8)  My friend who had ""checked"" her wine at the bar was a bit tipsy leaving, because there were some bottles of wine everyone enjoyed at dinner, and forgot to grab her beer before she walked outside. But our other friend remembered and ran up to the host to grab it before we all left. My friend just put the beer in her car not even paying attention. Turns out that the Ping Pong staff gave her the wrong beer! They apparently had the name tags switched for the another table that had brought beer.  While there were some frustrating aspects of the dinner, I have to say the food was good, but a bit over-priced for my taste. Also, I had never had a chocolate fortune cookie before. It came out and I was so excited. It was a chocolate fortune cookie, dipped in white chocolate with chocolate sprinkles. And my fortune inside was pretty right on to what is going on in my life.

2012-02-06,3.0,"I came here based on my friend's recommendation.  She told me it was BYOB and that the food was great.  I agree with the food portion, however when I brought a 6 pack of beer, they told me they do not accept it.  Given no reason as to why, apparently it was just one of their rules.  Luckily my two friends had two bottles of wine, however they charge $8.00 corkage fee.  Just to open the bottle, not even bothering to refill our glasses when they were low, we had to spend $8.00 per bottle.  When she opened the bottle and filled (the only time) our wine glasses, my friend and I had food encrusted into them.  We notified the waitress, not even bothering to apologize, she gave us new glasses.  Perfectly good wine was wasted!   Overall the food was a little pricey, but good!  The portions were filling, but don't expect to bring leftovers.  The service was average.  When we left, they gave me the wrong beer and I didn't even notice until I came home.  Thankfully it was Blue Moon, so I wasn't too disappointed.  I don't know if BYOWine is now the new rule, but I do feel like that corkage fee was slightly outrageous.  I am from the burbs, so its hard to sometimes grasp the extra fees Chicago restaurants, bars, parking, driving, maybe even breathing (anything associated with Chicago) likes to charge on people.",0.9627,0.788,0.148,0.064,0.5015495867768595

I love asian cuisine so this place was exactly what I was looking for. I really like the trendy atmosphere and music. It's a bit loud, but I definitely enjoy it. It drowns out others conversations so you don't hear anyone but those at your table. I had the Hot Toddy Pot (Not sure if that was the exact name) to drink. It was definitely a good choice since it was a cold night. I'm always a fan of warm alcoholic beverages. We ordered the Ping Pong Roll for an app. It was pretty good but I must say, the roll was smaller than I expected. For my main, I ordered the Curry Fried Rice. It wasn't anything overly special but it was very delicious. My friend ordered the Bulgogi. One of my favorite korean dishes. Part of me wished I would have ordered that but I did like having a heaping mound of left over curry fried rice to mix in with eggs in the morning. For dessert, the Great Wall Brick. If you want dessert after eating here, this is it! Its so delicious. It reminded me of pecan pie with an asian twist. The green tea ice cream really goes well with this dessert.

2011-09-29,3.0,"I came here on a Monday with the manfriend for dinner.  We'd only ordered delivery and I was craving seared tuna, so we decided to check the place out since they'd done a renovation. Must say that I love the decor! It is kind of a modern take on art deco or vintage regency or whatever you want to call it.  Molded walls are crisp white, the lighting fixtures are a touch ornate, and the black chairs, dark floors and tables remind me of the 30s modern take.  Pair that with fresh flowers on every table that are all different, and in different vases and bottles, and you've got a classy cute date place. Everyone except for one guy in a hoodie was here on a date.  How cute, and it was a little romantical except that I had a stupid cold.  We started the meal off with seared tuna (yum-mo as Sharon M likes to say!) and sashimi tuna dip.  .I got some mint tea and the manfriend got a Sapporo or Kirin.  We each got soup as well- I chose hot and sour soup, he got the ginger broth based soup, and we split the orange chicken as the main. Ping Pong's strength seems to be in its appetizers.  The seared tuna hit the spot, as did the tuna sashimi dip.  The dip has mango, tuna and cucumber in it and it is superyummy!  Only thing I'd change is having more sesame chips to go with it, which the server brought when I asked for it. Manfriend didn't care for his tofu veggie soup, and I tried it, it wasn't anything special.  The hot and sour soup I ordered was the second best around, with veggies and a little lighter than Hong Min's (which is the best, IMO).  Orange chicken was average- nothing special, nothing horrible, nothing worth trying again, just average. Service could use a little polish but overall they were quite attentive; I think our server may have been new and that confidence comes with experience.  Overall I would say come here on a date, and you can watch pretty people on dates in a pretty environment.  I'll try the other entrees eventually but the starters are Ping Pong's strong suit.

2011-09-25,4.0,"We went to Ping Pong last night for dinner. We were 5 people and had to wait approximately 40 minutes for a table as they don't take reservations. It's a small cosy restaurant with minimalist decor and small tables. There are lots of fresh flowers on their bar table that they then use to decorate their cocktails. Their cocktails were good and strong. We had the dry gin martini and the lychee martini, both really good. It is a BYOB restaurant with a corkage fee of $8 which works out well for those wanting to bring along their wine. We were all vegetarian so we ordered the only 3 vegetarian starters: vegetable spring rolls, vegetable dumplings and the sweet potato roll. the first two were OK, but the sweet potato was absolutely delicious!! The mains were absolutely amazing as well. We ordered the vegetarian pad thai that was a little too sweet for my taste, curry fried rice that was amazing, green curry tofu that was delicious and light and my absolute favorite buddhist enlightenment. They were the tastiest noodles I've had in a long time. 4 mains however were a little too much for 5 of us but the server had suggested 3 would be too little - I disagree with her..

2011-09-06,3.0,"Last night I went to Ping Pong with a friend for the first time.  She had ordered takeout before and wanted to get the experience of eating in the restaurant.  I was told to expect 'interesting' ambiance and got a taste of what she meant the minute we walked in the door. Ping Pong has a very modern, club vibe to it.  There was house music playing pretty loudly (at many times it was hard to hear my friend) and very minimalist decor.  Think all white walls, unusual artwork, and sleek black tables.  The bar by the door looked particularly fantastic and with all the fresh fruit set off to the side, it made me think having one of their cocktails would be absolutely fantastic. We arrived on the early side of service (5 pm) on a holiday so we were seated very quickly and the only ones in the restaurant.  We ordered the veggie dumplings to start and then I had the egg drop soup and the orange chicken while my friend had the Buddhist Enlightenment.  I was intrigued by the Pan-Asian menu but worried that such a range of dishes meant that rather than doing one kind of cuisine really well, they might do a range of dishes just okay. Unfortunately, when our dishes came my fears were confirmed.  Nothing was awful, but everything was just solidly average.  The veggie dumplings had a fantastically fresh filling, but the wrapper seemed just a bit too thick and a tad gummy.  My egg drop soup was bland and the ratio of egg to broth was off.  It was like eating a bowl of running scrambled eggs.  My orange chicken, thankfully was better.  However, it was not at all what I was expecting.  The menu indicated it would be spicy, but in actuality I tasted no spice whatsoever.  Not sure if the chef forgot to add peppers to the dish, but it was mostly sweet.  The sauce was mostly pleasant with strong orange and ginger flavor, but I think some heat would have balanced it out better.  Unfortunately, like the soup, the ratio was also off again.  WAY too much sauce, which meant that the crispy chicken lost its crunch quite quickly.  Kind of disappointing because if I am going to have the calories of a fried dish, I want to get the most out of the texture.  I think the best dish was my friend's Buddhist Enlightenment.  I found the sauce pleasant without being too sweet or heavy and the mix of textures was really nice.  I especially liked the lightness of the seitan.  Overall, the food just did not live up to the ambiance for me.  I'm thinking I might have liked it better if we ordered cocktails (many did and they looked and sounded fantastic), but I can only judge the meal based on what we ordered.  I'm not sure if I would go back for a full dinner, but I would definitely be open to going back for a cocktail and perhaps an appetizer.",0.9964,0.767,0.172,0.061,0.6261296296296294

We started off with calamari - which was very delicious. It wasn't the typical deep fried calamari, and it almost tasted healthy. For my entree, I decided on the pan-seared salmon that came with a small side (can't remember if it was veggies or salad at this point... and rice if you wanted it). The salmon was amazing and plenty, so much that I still had a bit of it left at the end of dinner.  I also enjoyed a couple libations (The Hamptons - sweet tea vodka & lemonade) - which was absolutely refreshing and paired well with the app and dinner, I think.  I can see how the ambiance -could- get loud (with the music), but it wasn't that bad when we went. Perhaps that can be attributed to a slow night as well.

Overall, ping bong has good food with a few major standouts. Specifically, the S&P calamari (or is it cuddle fish??) is an excellent starter. We typically end up ordering more than one plate. One our most recent PP outing, the calamari wasn't quite as crispy as usual; however, the hot peppers and salty fried coating are a great combination. The squid is extremely tender - and the saltiness goes well with a cocktail. Speaking, of cocktails. PP has a nice list of well intentioned martinis. They're definitely enjoyable, but not necessarily the best in the city.  The food is Americanized pan-Asian. And they do a good job with it. I feel that it's best to share a few plates with friends, but there are plenty of dishes that are good for single entrees. The food is good for the price and the service is efficient and friendly.  PP is a fun place and there is always a good atmosphere. Although in previous reviews I've negatively comment on the sound level being pumped into a restaurant - somehow it doesn't bother me at PP.

2011-03-07,3.0,"This was my second time at Ping Pong and I'm still debating whether or not I'll go back a third time.   I'll start with the good things.  The food is fantastic.  Both times, everyone in our group has been pleased with all of the appetizers, entrees and desserts that we ordered.  While their cocktails seem to be overpriced, the fact that they are BYOB is a real plus in my book!  Also, our service has been very good.  We had Christopher as our waiter both times and he was very friendly and attentive.  Overall, a nice/fun meal both times. On to the bad.  This past Friday night, I took a group of friends from out of town to Ping Pong.  There were 6 of us and we arrived early enough that there were plenty of tables available.  Since they don't take reservations, I know that the empty tables had not been reserved.  As we waited for them to set our table, I noticed that they were setting a table of 4 for our group of 6.  It looked like we would really be packed in there.  So I said to the host...""That looks like it might be a little tight.  Is there any way you can add another table for us?""  His response was that while they would love to give us another table, it was the weekend so it wouldn't be possible.  Um...ok.  So the six of us packed in.  Our appetizers were nearly impossible to fit on the table.  It was just uncomfortable.  If we had been 3 groups of 2, or a group of 4 and a group of 2, that would have warranted 3 tables.  Why did we get gipped just because we came together??  Also, at the beginning of the meal, they told us that they would not open more wine once our dinner plates had been cleared.  No problem at all.  I totally understand that they don't want people sitting there all night drinking their own wine.  However, when we ordered dessert, we asked for one more bottle of wine to be opened.  They refused saying that they made it clear that no more wine would be opened once our ""dinner plates"" had been taken away.  In my book, dessert is part of dinner!!  I didn't know that they specifically meant our entree plates!  So even though we still had food coming to the table, they would not open more wine for us.  Unreal. One more thing...the first time I was there, they actually charged my friend $2/drink for ice!  It was actually separated on his bill as an ""ice charge"".  I didn't hear the conversation they had, but in my mind that is insane and cannot be justified. So overall, Ping Pong is a fun, cool, stylish and tasty place to have dinner.  But the fact that they are so unaccommodating, stingy, cheap and clearly do not appreciate their customers...I just don't know if I'll go back.  All they have to do is start being reasonable and it would be one of my favorite places to go with friends for dinner!",0.9528,0.865,0.084,0.052,0.5169873663751215

But I could forgive all that if the food was just good.  I'm pretty sure Ping Pong has some agreement with Morton salt where they get paid for putting as much salt in their dishes as possible.  And then add some sort of spice.  I ordered the red snapper which was buried under some salad and I think mushrooms.  Fish was slimy and salty. Even the salad was salty.  I couldn't even eat half of it. In fact, no one else in our party finished theirs. The only saving grace was the seared ahi tuna appetizer which was decent.  They even managed to screw up fortune cookies by drowning them in Pillsbury icing and rainbow sprinkles.

I WAS AMAZED. i cannot rave enough, but i'll try to specifically give some props and 1 critiques: the only critique: went on a saturday night and had a 10-15 minute wait (totally reasonable) but there's not much waiting area (though they do recommend going across the street to wang's bar...but it was really snowy and cold!) my fiance went to pingpong's little bar to get us a couple cocktails while we waited...but that took so long we literally got our drinks as the host seated us anyway. it's a small bar & i think the 1 bartender was service bar as well. but once we got seated - the good times rolled. our server was PHENOMENAL. though i can only speak to that one employee, he was incredible. i wish i remembered his name...i want to say chris? he had an accent and was just lovely. we told him we were hoping to have our cocktails, get some appetizers, then have another drink or 2 and order entrees in a little bit. I know, server's nightmare - the 2 hour table. what he didn't know is that we've both been in the industry for years and would of course treat him well for occupying his table. well, we didn't have to tell him that, he was accommodating, and really knowledgable of the wine, cocktail and food menu - after hearing him describe several items and asking his opinion on wines and food and being so pleased with his recommendations, i ended up just asking him to select a wine for my final glass of the evening! the food was DELICIOUS - i got the ""beijing vegetarian"" - good lord, that was a mouthgasm. smoked tofu that was so truly smokey and had great texture - perfectly cooked veggies and a rich but not heavy sauce. my fiance got the ""steamed red snapper"" and said it was fantastic! I also loved noting that our server knew the snapper they use was sustainable and the menu noted the tofu is produced locally! another kicker - my fiance has an EXTREME dairy allergy - we're talking anaphylaxis. so we told our server and he promptly listed the only menu item that contains butter, said the others only used oil, so baring any creamy dishes we were fine, but he'd of course check on everything we ordered. awesome. what a gesture - turns out they give you chocolate covered fortune cookies with your check (we saw the table next to us get them) and we were thinking we should mention to just not bother bringing them (dairy) but without mention, the check comes and our server had asked a manager to allow him to put some gummy fruit candies on there - knowing the cookies had dairy & my fiance couldn't eat it! that's just above and beyond - that's genuine thoughtfulness.  i could keep going, but you've probably stopped reading by now -  so i'll just reiterate: 5 STARS, GO GO GO!",0.9986,0.817,0.179,0.004,0.6121621621621622

I will agree with several key points made by other reviewers: 1.  Appetizers are their strength. 2.  Sitting on patio will result in major bug swatting/bitching/nobody caring/leaving in a huff still hungry for the un-discounted food the gnats bitchily stole from you.. 3.  People who work at Ping Pong aren't allowed to EAT at Ping Pong or, apparently, anywhere else.  This might be a plus, though, as it will make you rethink the crab rangoon. Takeout appetizers works for me 'n the Pong.  You should only go to eat dinner during normal dinner hours if you need for the restaurants you decide to eat at to say something about Who You Are vs. feeding you really good food (especially at their price point).",0.4698,0.829,0.099,0.072,0.6253496503496503
2010-06-23,3.0,"Ping Pong: a contemporary pan-asian restaurant in the hustle and bustle of Boystown. The prices? A little steep for the quality of food. The drinks are pretty good ($10 avg) I just think they need to get a little more inventive with the garnish... the hibiscus flower is cute, but gets old after the 3rd drink.. I do recommend the pear martini The waitstaff was nice and really attentive, oh and were they fierce? um, yeah. On to the meal.. I ordered fried soft shell crab as an appetizer. I would say this was the most disappointing component of my meal. The crabs weren't nearly as crispy as they should've been. In fact, they were soggy by the time I got them. The sauce I was given to accompany the crabs was lackluster (really thin vinegary sauce with some sugar and ginger). No actual complexity of flavor.. blah. My main course was the Pad See Ewe. Now, this is a dish I've grown up with. So I have to say that my judgment may be harsher than some, but I feel that they could improve it a lot. The portion was good, it was juts the execution and flavor profile that needs tweaking. A little sweeter than I'm used to, and I know they're supposed to use Dark Sweet Soy Sauce, but you also have to counter it with other flavors too! My noodles looked like they weren't stir-fried correctly. They were still really slippery, and didn't get a nice sear. The funny thing I've come to realize with a lot of these noodle dishes is the fact that they're all Pad's which if you translate it, roughly means STIR FRY but there's an overwhelming number of dishes I've gotten from various restaurants where they aren't actually done correctly.. Ping Pong's Pad See Ewe (& Pad Thai from what I've seen) falls under this unfortunate trend. But I've definitely had worse, so Ping Pong didn't completely fail. But be aware, if you ask for sriracha, you're not going to get the bottle, instead a little portion in a little dish is what you'll get. haha odd. Overall, I had an OK dinner.

There are TWO reasons why I gave this place only 3 stars however.  #1 The music.  If I'm going to go out to dinner with a friend, or even a group of friends, I want to do just that- Have Dinner.  I want to be able to have a conversation with my friends, not sit there with music bumping abruptly in the background and looking my friends awkwardly not being able to hear each other.  I don't read lips well.  The club music needs to go or be turned down- I think it's 100% unnecessary.  I'm not there to dance, I'm there to have a meal. #2 The prices are a little high.  I don't think it should be $15 per plate.  Is it good? Yes.  But the portion size is small compared to the price.  It's chinese food, not a gourmet plate or revolutionary food.  It's good, but the price and portion sizes do not coincide with one another. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're going out and want to talk with friends and I especially wouldn't recommend this place for a first date- you won't be able to talk.   I would recommend it if you're upset with the person your with and don't want to talk to them the rest of the night.

2010-06-04,2.0,"I was first introduced to ping pong last fall by some friends and it has quickly become a standby place to bring friends from out of town and a restaurant I frequent to the point that most of the staff recognizes me. Its ambient vibe, incredibly friendly staff, exotic menu and great daily specials at a very reasonable price make it a chic and affordable place to wine and dine [they do have BYOB]. When you sit down you'll be greeted with a warm towel to wipe off your hands and a complimentary appetizer... typically taro chips, although for a brief time they served boiled peanuts. The wait staff will eventually bring you your own carafe of water and will keep your glass full. Their menus is a great mix of classic Thai and Chinese offerings and offers great selections for vegetarians as well as meat eaters.  The hot and sour soup is incredible and a great way to start your meal, which for me usually is the green curry. I realized I hadn't reviewed pingpong and decided to when I visited this past week. Unfortunately it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant to date.  It was nice outside, so we opted for the outdoor seating which we've done many times before. About midway through our appetizers we began to be attacked by a swarm of gnats that were encircling our table.  At first i wasn't so bad but by the time our food arrived it was beyond tolerable.  We spent nearly 3/4 of our time shooing the gnats away and all without any of the wait staff asking if everything was OK. Gnats ended up in our food, water and drinks and our server was nowhere in sight. Another server came to get our dishes and noticed what was happening and even brought it to the attention of other staff members who were more interested in seeing the bugs than the fact that all of our entrees were returned half eaten and that we were miserable. It seemed like the gnats were attracted to the grass or flowers that were in the planter around us and there were no candles or citronella on the tables or the periphery of the outdoor seating space to keep them away. Our server finally made his way outside and asked if we wanted dessert at which point all we wanted was the check.  No effort was made by our server or a manager to apologize for the experience -- meanwhile, while we were waiting for our check, the busboys were making a game of swatting at the gnats with their dishtowels.  And while up until this visit I've been a raving fan, the fact that our server knew we were regulars and didn't make any effort to rectify the situation showed a lack of appreciation for loyal customers, which to me, ruins my entire perception of ping pong. I would have given you 5 Stars before, but sadly, the lack of care or concern we were shown was inexcusable, unprofessional and was service we could have received at a Panda Express.

As we strolled past Ping Pong, music blared and the ambience of the dimly-light restaurant lured us in. We were greeted by a polite server and immediately seated. A cute waiter brought out a appetizer of peanuts that were soaked in something (they looked fancy). He also gave us these nifty warm clothes that you use to clean your hands before eating (extra fancy). I was feeling 5% awkward, as I had never experienced a place that offered such delicacies as marinated peanuts in shell or the luxury of washing your hands outside of the bathroom. They had a few specials- and we decided to sample a maki roll. We also each got a noodle dish. I got glass noodles, Renea got pad thai. The maki was awesome. Made with ingredients that were bursting with freshness, it was just a little spicy and made a perfect app. Our noodle dishes came just a few minutes after, and they were also very fresh and very yummy.

2010-03-12,3.0,"I wish I could award half-stars, because I think Ping Pong is more of a 3.5 than 3 star place, but since the cons are so significant, I don't think that extra half is appropriate. This is definitely one of the better Asian places in Lakeview.  The appetizers, in particular, are phenomenal. The Salt and Pepper Calamari is one of the most spectacular flavor combinations I've ever experienced, and I've really never tasted anything else like it.  Likewise, the Sashimi Tuna Dip is amazing.   The entrees are... fine.  Nothing stands out.  The flavor combinations are adequate, but uninspired.  I often order carryout and just build dinner out of two or three appetizers because the entrees are so lackluster. Also in the adequate/workmanlike column is the service.  It's fine.  The wait staff are efficient, but maybe a little overworked, because it often takes them time to get around to stopping at the table. Now, the real cons.... The place is frequently packed to the gills.  If you're not in the first seating on a weekend night, you could be waiting for nearly an hour for a table. That's not the restaurant's fault, of course, but long waits aren't really my cup of tea.   And speaking of tea, I really wish this place had alternatives to tea (or expensive cocktails).  They have a huge selection of fancy cocktails, but for those who would rather abstain (or who simply prefer not to pay an arm and a leg for a drink), the options are lacking.  Tea is about it unless you want soda. The noise, too, is a problem.  This place is LOUD.  It's hard to have a conversation here, because the acoustics are terrible AND the music is usually very loud AND the other patrons are all yelling over the music to be heard.  If you're looking for a nice, relaxing meal, this is not the place.  This IS the place to see and be seen by Lakeview's trendy gay dinneratti.  If you have a gay friend in from out of town, this is a good place to go for dinner before drinks or dancing at one of Lakeview's other establishments. The last con, and the one that really cost Ping Pong that half-star, is the price.  This place is -expensive- for what you get.  If I get three orders of the Salt and Pepper Calamari (which I've done many times), it runs me about $35 after tax.  Put another way, that's a third of a hundred dollar bill.  For appetizers.  I like Ping Pong.  It's a block from my place, and I admit, I eat here a fair amount, but that's mainly for the great appetizers.  If the appetizers were as humdrum as the entrees, the noise and the cost would easily be enough to keep me away.",0.9961,0.813,0.157,0.03,0.520142857142857

White decor and nicely spaced tables make this a pretty comfortable environment to eat in. The lighting is next to none, which keeps things intimate and keeps the gays looking great. (You know we hate over head lighting.) On a 1-10 scale the food is an 8. Some of their dishes are done consistently well, while others are hit or miss.

Correction,  make that a 3 minute walk in this weather. Anyway, a Friend Zoner suggested this for an early evening dinner before my game started, so I said why not.  Not only was I hesitant to concede a Saturday night block of time to a Friend Zoner, but it is freezing out, so I had no desire to go at all.  I said to myself on the chilly walk over ""This place better knock my socks off or I'm gonna be hot."" The result? It passed the test.  I've been told about this place countless times by neighbors, but I never made it over.  If you are reading this as a Lakeview resident, this place is an absolute MUST. Decor is surprisingly better than I expected. Not overdone but still manages to make a point.  There's a really crisp and hip feel to it the second you walk in.  I like the spacing of the tables and say they got it just right, and that can be a problem in some neighborhood eateries.

I didn't understand why they had to play clubbing music while I was trying to eat my Chinese food. And, they were playing these projectors on the walls with colored striped lines. I realize they are trying to be trendy but it is a small Asian restaurant in Boystown... I went there on a weeknight just walking by. Am I just that old and out-of-date that I didn't enjoy that? But besides the environment, the food itself was just mediocre as well. We ordered the summer rolls, similar to a Vietnamese spring roll but with some different ingredients. The rice paper skin seemed too thick and the noodles inside were too mushy. Otherwise, I liked it b/c I do like my spring rolls! Then we had the penang chicken curry and the hong kong wide noodles. The curry had a nice flavor to it... pretty spicy. It wasn't the best I have had but it was good. The noodles had an okay flavor but the noodles seemed overcooked and the beef had a weird texture. Not a fan, really. I also had a watermelon martini, which tasted like lip balm. Oh, and prices overall were a little high. I mean, $12-14 for regular Thai food? I can go to a ""less trendy"" place and get it for $8.  Oh, yeah... I almost forgot to mention my favorite thing... the only thing that I really enjoyed were the homemade taro chips that came out when we sat down. Those were quite yummy!

Ping Pong was once a cozy little spot with excellent food, a fun atmosphere and decent (well...hit or miss) service that was reasonably friendly.

I remember when the sesame chicken was a full plate of succulent hunks of chicken with substantial amounts of broccoli and a big bowl of rice.

I wish I had gotten the fish tacos or the sashimi dip instead. Oh well, next time.  The chocolate covered fortune cookies are a nice treat to end the night.

2008-09-19,2.0,"Update for more current dining experience: Service on this particular night was very good, a cute young Cuban boy who especially became attentive after inquiring about my dining-mate's Cuban-American heritage. Suddenly, best friends. Anyway, ordered a sushi roll which seemed way too small, and friend dumplings (veggie) which were dense and dry. My review remains at 2 stars. Actually veering more toward 1.5 stars since the place is SO FREAKING LOUD!!! Turn the music down 30% and those who want to enjoy it still could, and maybe those who'd like to hear anything their dining partners say could do the same.  EARLIER REVIEW: This place has gone down hill since it was a tiny little joint. Maybe that's the down side of success and expansion. Specifics: the service is now totally indifferent. Items like the summer rolls which used to be moist and fresh and seemed prepared moments before they arrived, now seem dry like they were prepared en masse early in the morning. Spicy garlic scallops were tough ... maybe the menu has grown too much to give individual dishes and ingredients the attention they used to get? Not sure. And the place seems overly loud these days, which makes people talk louder to be heard above the din, which only adds to the noise level ....",0.9842,0.791,0.17,0.038,0.5110947712418302

I suggested looking for a BYOB place, so we could all get our drink on (she was just turning 18). She picked this place, and while the place itself was kinda cool, the food was less than great. We ordered a bunch of different things as appetizers - as said before, their pot stickers were huge and were really tasty. We also ordered the seafood salad, which was AMAZING - but then again, I love sesame oil, and it was drenched in it. Our main meals, on the other hand - not so hot. I ordered the Orange Chicken, which I admit, isn't the most crazy thing - but it said it was made with fresh orange peel, so I figured it would be delicious. Not so much. The chicken was way overcooked - and it wasn't just mine - others in our party agreed that their chicken was overcooked, also. How this happens in a restaurant, IDK. My boyfriend ordered the Kung Pao, and the sauce tasted pasty and burnt - as if there was too much flour, and they tried to over-compensate by overcooking it or something? Weird. Not to mention, we waited over an hour and a half - this is before it even started getting busy!

Enter Ping Pong: Ping Pong shines with its well-balanced main dishes and really trendy appetizers, with the salt & pepper calamari and tuna tartar topping the list. It's not going to appear in ""Le Guide Michelin"" and for better tuna tartar I'd go to Le Colonial, but for great food that's quite affordable it's become my staple. If you haven't visited Ping Pong in a while, you might want to note that they have done away with a few favorites: 1) They no longer take your cell when you place a reservation. I used to LOVE this feature, since it allowed you to shop on Broadway while waiting to be called to dinner. 2) BYOB is now only allowed inside. I'm not sure if they were ever allowed to serve outside, but for the first two years, nobody seemed to care. Kind of puts a damper on the excitement of brining a great Riesling or Gewurztraminer if you can't eat outside. 3) They no longer will chill your wine in their fridge while you wait.

We signed the checks, with tip, as we were finishing our tea. Some people were also finishing wine, which we paid a corkage fee for.  Suddenly, a person we had not seen all night (who we later learned was the manager) came up to our table and said ""We've got people waiting, can you wrap it up and get going?"". We were astonished at the rude fashion in which he asked us to leave. One girl went to the bathroom, and the rest hurried to finish their tea, talking about how rudely they had been addressed.  I started to write a note on the back of a piece of paper stapled to my credit card receipt about how we had ordered a lot of food, paid a lot of money, etc. and that we found it rude that were asked to leave while finishing our beverages.  The man who had asked us to leave must have been watching me write it, and as I held it to read it back to myself, he was at the table again, snatching the paper out of my hand.  He quickly pulled the credit card receipt off of the paper I was writing on, crumpled up the note in front of my face, then threw it in the candle on our table, starting a small fire in the middle of our table! After taking a moment to absorb what had just happened, I approached him and asked him for the credit card receipts back (meanwhile the note is still burning in our candle, causing a stench in the restaurant), which he refused to give us.  He then claimed that people around us had complained about our noise level, which was ridiculous as it was a noisy, packed restaurant, there was techno music playing (for some reason), and we were a table of 5 ladies making no more noise than anyone else.  Meanwhile, our waitress stood by looking horrified.  The food was not worth the ridiculous music and atrocious treatment we received.",-0.9654,0.853,0.043,0.104,0.4304347826086956

The General's Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Everything Fried Rice are my favorites.  They also have a good selection of drinks if you feel so inclined. Last summer I had some martini that came with a slice of watermelon skewered over the glass. Amazing. I have only two complaints about Ping Pong. The music is always FAR too loud. It is a little obnoxious to have to yell over the music. This seems to be the general trend of any restaurant or bar in Lakeview. Also, sometime around the middle of last summer the portions seemed to shrink noticeably. Like, in half. I'm not saying that it was ever a good idea to eat the entire entree before but I would often split it and take the other half home and make a second meal out of it.  Oh, and one major plus for Ping Pong. A friend of mine had his birthday at Ping Pong last summer and the staff went all out to make sure that it was an incredible experience. They stored the many desserts we brought in their fridge while we ate, attended to our table of 8 guests very well, and when it was time to have the cake they even decorated it with their chocolate fortune cookies and candles and gave the guest of honor a free cocktail, t-shirt, and dessert from their own menu. Added: I almost forgot to mention this. Eating outside at Ping Pong during the warmer months is one of my favorite things.

First, the good- Ping Pong has a great atmosphere. With it's ultra-white interior I always assumed this place would be way too trendy or pretentious. But on trying it, I have no such complaints. A little trendy, sure. But, I've always been made to feel at home. The food is, for the most part, very good. There are a number of unique options (not your token, paint-by-the-numbers Thai menu) and a lengthy list of appetizers. I am constantly trying new things here- where at your standard Thai place I always get the same thing. There's just so many things to try. They have four dollar glasses of house red and white wine. Perhaps you get what you pay for... but, c'mon... how many places are you gona find with four dollar glasses of wine? Particularly places that one might call trendy? In addition, I think, if I am not mistake, that they also offer cocktails, and permit BYOB. Chocolate Fortune Cookies served on a ping pong paddle- very clever. But now the bad- Service is what it is. Servers never seem to be personable (though, I question if its because they don't speak much English). This also allows them to cover more tables, and in my experience have never been left waiting, or without a full glass of water. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps have a sauce that it is really heavy on the peanuts and really light on the CHICKEN. How do you mess up a chicken peanut sauce? The edamame appetizer was literally like maybe twelve pieces... C'mon. As stated above- the serving sizes are very small. Entree rice and noodle dishes could ALMOST be considered small plates. Which makes it essential to order appetizers to supplement your meal. Prices appear cheap - but it starts to rack up when you have to order extra dishes to fill up. We ordered delivery from here recently, and the sesame chicken dish came with literally 4 pieces of broccoli. It was so disappointing... I'm not sure if this was a delivery portion, or if that's what is actually served on site. Dish size seems rather arbitrary, some dishes giving much larger portions than others. But Ping Pong is fun and cool. Totally worth a try. Make sure you order enough, and you should leave happy. Expect to wait for a table at peak-times.

First, I ordered a cup of the hot and sour soup (which I'd heard great things about) and the lettuce wraps. The soup was just WAY to salty to have more than like 3 spoonfuls, even though the waiter brought me a bowl because it took so long to come out. I will say that they are generous with the tofu and the chicken in the soup, so if you can get past the flavor generally - go for it.  The chicken lettuce wraps were basically just peanuts in sauce. It tasted fine but, like the soup, I only wanted like 3 bites. Still starving, I asked the waiter for the menu and his recommendation between the calamari or the spring rolls. He said that the calamari was his favorite thing on the menu. Again, just completely inedible. The calamari ""rings"" come folded so that they look like hash browns. They were completely bland. They're served with this jalapeno and garlic concoction. I tried to stir it up to get some of the flavor into the calamari and just got a huge mouthful of garlic. My fiance wouldn't get near me! The service was nice although pretty over-extended. He seemed pretty apologetic for everything we were served. Drinks were generous and fairly priced.",0.9881,0.808,0.162,0.03,0.6373333333333334

The food is fantastic.  I recommend the edamame for an appetizer.  It's not your usual steamed/boiled and salted edamame, they add sesame seeds and just a touch of oil and salt.  Something different than the usual and a real treat.  For an entree, try the salmon.  It comes with a delicious, if a little thin, teriyaki lemon sauce, mushrooms, and peapods (for which I usually substitute broccoli). They used to be BYOB only, but they've since gotten a liquor license.  Try the ginger gin.  It's ginger-ale, gin, and a couple pieces of fresh ginger cut up like pineapple chunks.  I'm not really a gin-drinker, but I enjoyed it on a warm summer night recently. The service is inconsistent, but not necessarily bad.  Some days you'll get an attentive, fun, and outgoing server; other days you have someone that couldn't care less and just leans on the wall or the counter near the back.  Very hit or miss.   When you get a good server and the music is poppin', this place is a 5.    A bad server drops it to a 2 because, when they are bad, they are really bad.  The food is always good at a fair price, though, and good company can always make up for crappy service.

2007-07-18,3.0,"If you've read the other reviews of Ping Pong don't bother with this one. I'm going to say the same thing with different words.  My wife and I went to Ping Pong Friday night with a mixture of enthusiasm and skepticism. The consensus on Yelp is that the food is pretty good and the service is pretty bad. Fortunately, there was no wait, which was good for 6:30 on a Friday night, though it was a full house within an hour after we arrived. The host seemed friendly enough but sat us uncomfortably between two tables when the entire restaurant was empty leaving me feeling like I was at the barber (do I strike up a conversation or pretend I'm socially inept?).  Sitting a chopstick's length from my fellow diners I came to a few conclusions: 1. This is a voyeuristic haven. If you like watching people watch you this is your kind of place. 2. The service really isn't as bad as it may appear. Sure half of the wait staff screams ""I wasn't hugged enough as a child"" or ""That's right I can afford the Armani summer 2007 collection on your tips"" but they get the food to the tables and keep the glasses full. 3. The music makes up for what the atmosphere is lacking. I didn't find it as loud as some reviews might suggest but do think our waitress needed hearing aids.  The food was pretty good. We started off with crab rangoon and fried potstickers. The rangoons were the highlight of the meal and the potstickers had a nice spicy ""meat"" in them as well. For our entres we had the orange chicken and the kung pao chicken. The orange chicken was good and was a decent sized portion with a side of rice. The kung pao was heavy on the kung, light on the pow but was an even larger portion than the orange chicken. We chased down our meal with some Stellas, bringing the bill to $62. I can't decide if this is a great deal but the Chicago guide book I've been flipping through rates this as a ""great buy."" Maybe not a great buy but I would give it another shot. They do give you chocolate fortune cookies served on, of course, a ping pong paddle.

2007-07-11,5.0,"Ping Pong offers the best people watching experience money can buy.  And the food--if you order the right things--is very good.    One thing I really like about Ping Pong is it's diverseness.  For appetizers I prefer to skip the ""standby"" crab rangoon (which is very good, yet somewhat boring) in favor of wasabi fries or duck tacos.  The fish tacos are also VERY good... Both tacos are a bit pricey--at $7.  For entrees, you can order regular ole General's chicken or something more adventurous and different.  Personally I think their strengths are not in the Americanized Chinese food that's there for those who aren't adventurous.  I like the red snapper--it is sometimes amazing even.  I'm not convinced it's actually red snapper though, a substitute.  The fish is served over a soy sauce broth with vegetables.. Very tasty.  For dessert the green tea ice cream is good, but something more amazing is mochi ice cream  It is basically 3 balls of ice cream that are coated in some rice thing that tasted a bit bubble gummy in texture.  It is totally orgasmic.  Even though they have a bar now, it's still also BYOB in the restaurant itself if you want (you can't BYO sitting at the bar itself or at the sidewalk patio).  Their drink prices are extremely reasonable, and cocktails are good!  The $6 corkage fee is steeper than what it used to be--free (then $3, then 5).. so I guess that's their way of saying don't BYOB anymore, get your drinks from the bar.  They have a full bar, and for that matter the best cocktails in the area. This place has really changed over the years... it used to be a tiny storefront.... now it's 3 stores wide and the decor changes more often.  I'm glad they got over that aweful deer head fascination they had for awhile.   I kind of miss the olden more mellow days of Ping Pong...   If you get a sidewalk or window table, the people watching here is the best money can buy.   You'll likely see several crazy looking straight couples holding on to each hands for life, a transvestite or two (outside of the ping pong employees), people clenching to their kids like they were keeping them away from satan, a semi-midget, and a lot of really cute...dogs.    I once got my picture taken with Vincent Falk outside of Ping Pong, the color suit guy.

They now have a liquor license but still allow BYOB wine. My corkage fee never seems to correlate with how many bottles of wine we consume so I can't say exactly what the fee is (I guess it pays to be gay). One thing obvious is that the portion sizes have noticably descreased in size twice over the past 6 months or so. I think I've eaten off larger plates at various tapas places. I don't mind tapas sized portions but adjust the price accordingly. In summary, the food is decent but getting expensive (considering the reduction in portion size). We all go there for the minimalist decor and background music. The expansion a while back was also a pleasant treat. The trendiness and high foot traffic in the area means that they can probably get away with charging more for less.

Flying solo because my boyfriend was out for the night I picked things based on their yelp mentions, ordered enough for me to eat now, and him to have leftovers later.  Placed the order and decided to walk down to pick it up. I was told 15 minutes, I showed up in 20 and asked the host if it was ready. He said no, I paid and started my wait. 10 minutes later a bag was brought out and left behind the bar. 10 minutes after that I finally got the host to check on my food and he picked that bag up and handed it to me. All told I got my food 25 minutes late. It was beautifully packaged, and I'm sure would have been hot if I wasn't waiting on it for a while. But it was busy, and the host was swamped, so I guess it's to be expected. Then again, they always look swamped, so I'd expect them to handle it better. The hot & sour soup was terrible. 3 bites in and I was done for good.  Since the boyfriend doesn't like it, into the trash it went. Luckily things got better. The crab rangoon were fried well, but not the stuffed, crab filled things I envisioned after reading these reviews. Skimpy on the cream cheese and crab almost non-existant, I'll take the free ones from Yen's every time over these. Sadly they were better than many others I've had in the city though. I got the Sesame Tofu which was also very good. The sauce wasn't thick or syrupy, but it had a very subtle and distinct flavor. The ginger was a great accent to tofu & broccoli that was cooked well. Too bad there wasn't a lot of broccoli though. But light and totally refreshing. A wonderful change to the normal Chinese restaurant version that is usually very syrupy and sweet. I really enjoyed it. The ""sashimi tuna dip"" however, is incredible. Raw tuna, a thin and light spicy mayo, fresh cucumber, black sesame seeds, and cilantro along with lightly fried chips to dip... if this was the only good thing I had I'd go back for it again and again. If you order anything from Ping Pong, get this tar tar dish.  All in all, between the super loud music, the overabundance of trendy wanna-be-seen people, and the amount of times I got elbowed; the wait seemed about 3 times longer than it was. For that reason alone I'll never eat there. But I'll sure as hell be ordering from them again, even if it's just for the tuna tar tar.

It's the satisfied feeling you get as people walk by and see all of the pretty people (you included) sitting at the simple white tables, surrounded by white walls and perhaps random videos flashing. The music is pumping, sometimes forcing you to yell across the table at your mates, making you feel like eating in the middle of a club.

Well, now they have the booze permit, and it is expanded, and I think we've all begun to get used to the fact that Ping Pong, for better or for worse, is here to stay.  Let's look at some highlights of the decor.  Can we say cute waiters?  And the interior is a little too trendy if you ask me, but then again, this is what their shtick is, so who am I to judge?  I suppose if it were less gaudy and more refined, business would probably tumble.  I don't understand why the music must be so loud, or the movies projecting onto the walls, and hopefully come summer when they open the doors the noise level will diffuse to the outside.  Right now the din of the room rises so much that you can't even hear yourself think, let alone talk to your table without screaming.  Yes, it's true the staff is a little on the bitchtastic side, but I think the issue here is that they can't hear you just as much as you can't hear anything.  Now imagine having to deal with every table in such a way, and now imagine that they are waiters and probably would rather not be doing what they're doing for a living either, or at least were doing too much drinking and coke snorting the night before.  I've found that the best way to get your waiter to be polite here, and maybe even get a smile, is to be a little sassy back.  This is Boystown after all. For example, when our waiter brought us our main courses, my friend reminded him that he had ordered brown, not white, rice, and so the waiter turned to me and asked if I too would prefer brown rice, even though he had on his tray two white rice bowls ready.  I asked, ""Would that be a pain in the ass?""  His reply, somewhat snarky: ""Yes.""  Rather than shying away, I remembered to be a little more rude than usual in return, and said, ""In that case, bring me brown rice.""  Instead of getting pissed, the waiter got a big smile on his face as if I had said I was going to make out with him later, and proceeded to go get our brown rice.  So don't go overboard, and certainly have a sense of timing and style, but by all means return some of the ""poor attitude and service"" to the floor staff, and like the Blob they will absorb your negativity and refuel their happy-charge in some sadistic, primordial way. The food is pretty decent.  Don't listen to the guy who says that it tastes like cardboard.  I think that guy probably lost his salivary glands and is pissed at the world.  And what's really cool is that the dishes are very unique.  You won't find regular Chinese dishes here, so be a little experimental.  The Ping Pong chicken with walnuts is good, as is the seafood Noodle Soup, the calamari, and many of the appetizers. It is too loud, and the wait can be a little atrocious.  But isn't that a sign of goodness?  It's a fun place, that's for sure, and not a good place to take your grandparents.  Also, I've seen some kids in here before, but found that very confusing.  There is just something ""adult"" to me about Ping Pong.  Great people watching, I suppose.  And no, do not order delivery.  It isn't as good, from my experience, and I live next door.",0.9918,0.814,0.118,0.068,0.4453496811830146

We have had bad service experiences.  Stopped in tonight  al Valhalla Wine Shop (new sushi store).  Ended up speaking with Owner (Henry).  Left amazed.  Tried to talk with him about bad service at Ping Pong.  He was so very rude.  Staff clearly gets their bad service training from him.   A true owner/leader listens and learns from his clients.  This guy had no interest in hearing our feedback.  Although the food is good, service will be its downfall.     mdean1858@yahoo.com .",-0.9148,0.614,0.138,0.248,0.5637465564738293
2005-10-18,5.0,There are only a few things I eat at asian resturants and they do two of them better than any place else in the city. Their Pad Thai is incredible. It has the perfect combination of peanuts and sweet sauce.  They also have the best crab rangoon. They don't go cheap on the crab meat. They have a summer menu that is fairly inexpensive but is only good in the summer.  In the winter it's better to get their food to go because there are all of 10 seats inside.,0.9393,0.83,0.17,0.0,0.6269230769230769
2005-10-15,3.0,"No, that's not a broom closet in the middle of Broadway - it's actually a restaurant. This tiny Asian fusion location seats only 20 (plus 15 during warm weather with outdoor seating). But the diminutive size is not the only reason you frequently see a crowd of people outside its doors, patiently waiting for a table. The food is consistently solid, the prices are fair, and it's BYOB (corkage fee of $3.95, which is waived if your purchase was made Valhalla, the wine store across the street). I hear the crab rangoon is fantastic, although I've never tried it (not a big fan of cream cheese with my seafood - ick).",0.8176,0.875,0.106,0.02,0.4269230769230769
2005-08-14,3.0,"Everyone I talk to raves about how good Ping Pong is, but I found it rather bland.  Maybe it's because I had take out and the actual dining experience is better, but I just was not impressed.  I've had better Chinese food at Panda Express.  Their redeeming factor was their crab rangoon -- now that was good stuff!",0.8875,0.741,0.209,0.05,0.5148148148148147
2005-08-14,4.0,"Cheekily called ""chopstick cuisine,"" Ping Pong is a quirky little BYOB sushi/Pan-Asian restaurant. It's also probably the smallest restaurant in the neighborhood, with about three tables inside. Luckily there's outdoor seating in the summer. Only open in evenings, its a great place for an intimate date and a creative menu.",0.8834,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.7729166666666667
