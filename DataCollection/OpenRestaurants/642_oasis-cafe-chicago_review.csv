There's a daily special item each day and all days are good! My usual go-to is the mixed combo chicken though. It's 3 pieces of falafel AND chicken shawarma, rice, tomato and cucumber salad, and hummus with pita. It's a ton of food for like under $8!! I usually get two meals out of it.

Topped with 3 generous falafel balls, a heaping side of hummus sprinkled with paprika, and a mound of yellow rice with huge slabs of meat, with salad and pita on the side, this dish definitely could be shared with two people.  The falafels are some of the best I've ever had. They were perfectly fried, crispy...and reminded me of fried cornbread with their hidden sweetness and texture. Their meats were a little on the dry side, but the rice underneath made up for it...plump and soft (not the dry kind of rice that I've had at other mediterranean places). Top your pita bread with hummus, some rice, and a little bit of salad and you are set - the crunchiness and lightness of the cucumbers and tomatoes will give way to the earthy tones of hummus and heaviness of the meat-flavored rice.  Yum! 4 stars because they didn't provide any yogurt sauce (not even when I asked), with it I'm sure it would've been one of the better mediterranean places I've been to (compatible to MedDeli back at UNC!). Also 4 stars because they really need a better sign...i could hardly find this place since that whole section of Wabash is filled with jewelry stores (I also felt bad walking the long trek past the eager jewelry salespeople up front all the way to the back for a $10 meal).

Have I got a place for you! Oasis Cafe is the Loop's hidden little gem (wait, did anyone else use that already?) that really isn't so hidden. Well, you think it's hidden because you're walking through a jewelry store to get to this secret restaurant but then you see the line of people waiting to order some falafel and you realize that Oasis Cafe is no secret.

Try looking for a sign or sample menu in the windows as you get closer to the correct door. Walk down the long aisle, past the glass displays, to a two-level seating area with plenty of larger tables for a group lunch.  Despite the distance from my office in the south end of the Loop, I think Oasis Cafe is the better of the Middle Eastern non-chain lunch joints. Compared to Falafel Island, its portions are still big enough for two meals albeit a little smaller and therefore, cheaper. The meat was tender and well-seasoned, the hummus was fresh and delicious, and the falafel was crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. They also offer a daily special to keep things interesting and my friend has praised their lentil soup. My only critique is that the Shish Kabob combo promised baba ganoush but I was given hummus instead - the hummus was great, but I wanted baba ganoush!",0.9555,0.887,0.113,0.0,0.440515873015873

A great lunch spot with very generous portions. For a sampling of the best of Oasis, go with the kebab combo platter ($9) which is chunks of beef or lamb shish with three falafel, babaganouj, and rice. I always opt for the lamb shish, which is plentiful and pleasantly charred. The falafel are consistently great, crispy (but not oily) on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. Babaganouj is some of the best you can find in the Loop. Chunky, smoky, and creamy, this is eggplant at its best, not the mushy, applesauce-texture stuff that babaganouj sometimes ends up being.  Their hummus is extremely rich and flavorful, heavy on the tahini. I've had the very popular Wabash special, but found that I enjoyed the fluffy falafel, heavy hummus, and earthy foul more than the actual chicken pasilla, which was decent, just not very memorable. The Moroccan chicken was very tender and juicy, but didn't pack the same flavor that I'm used to from Oasis. Kofta are also delicious, but relatively standard.  The one big disappointment is their pita, which is pre-baked, flat, and cold by the time it's served to you in individual plastic wraps. My recommendation: skip the chicken and the pita sandwiches, there are better places in the Loop for that (I'm looking at you, Naf Naf.)

The eggplant pieces fall apart in your mouth and the overall sauce is perfectly balanced with sumac spice, lemon and garlic. I would order it by the bucket to take home if they offered.  We ordered a veggie plate, cup of soup of the day and falafel sandwich. Which ended up being more than necessary for two people because the portion sizes were generous. The falafel was certainly fresh and had a great crispy exterior and moist interior. Overall, the quality was extremely high. Our only disappointment was the pita isn't fresh (as in made throughout the day). The soup of the day, some kind of vegetable, rice and garbanzo bean concoction, was very ""homey"" and simple in a delicious way.  Very good if you are looking for some healthy, home style comfort food.

I was there with 7 adults and 4 children and the food was fantastic. For the prices, you receive a lot of food and out total was about $60 which isn't bad considering the amount of people it fed, and there was a lot left over to take home. It really felt like authentic Mediterranean cuisine and I would definitely recommend the Falafel Platter and the Hummus.  If I come back to Chicago again, I might try this place again.

Spoiler alert: there is no replacing that delicious, greasy mess. However, Oasis has gotten the closest yet. Sure, they're bizarrely located, but it works. The falafel is crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Just the right ratio of veggies, falafel and sauce. The lunch time line will be out the door, but it's not a long wait. And that's when items are usually at the freshest. Whenever I've dropped by later in the day, they either freshly prepare my order or they grab a lukewarm leftover from the lunch rush.

There are plenty of options for both meat eaters and vegetarians, so pretty much everyone can find something to tickle their fancy on the menu. I love the falafel (either the sandwich or the plate), which is always hot and perfectly seasoned with a crispy outside and soft interior. The chicken shawarma is also delicious. But my favorite thing to order is their lentil soup. It is warm and comforting and creamy, and it just tastes amazing. If I get a sandwich, then I always order a side of their hot sauce, as it really helps clear the sinuses. Oasis Cafe is an awesome place to stop in for lunch when in the loop.

Through much of the 80's and 90's I frequented the Oasis Cafe because it was convenient, a great value, and just pleasingly odd in its location in the back end of a long jewelry mall. I suppose a restaurant in a mall is not odd, but winding your way back to this delicious, friendly and bright spot is something like a weird dream.  The set up is really like a fast food joint, and their food is really fast, unless as I discovered in my last visit, if you order hot tea. That turned into kind of an ordeal, and a good ""Big Gulp"" serving of hot tea which practically lasted me all afternoon. But I digress from my love of Oasis.The menu is a wonderful combination of, well, combinations, as in plates of deliciously fresh Middle Eastern treats like falafel plates, shawarma, and couscous. Sandwiches, too. Salads like Greek and Lebanese, and many excellent vegetarian offerings. Over the years, I have sampled most of the menu offerings and I was never disappointed. You could eat here everyday, never spend more than ten smackers, and get enough food for your main meal of the day. I had the Chicken Shawarma ($5.49) today. It was filled with tender chicken, chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and a tasty sauce. Very good tongue shui, I must say.

However, the staff let me replace it with a Snapple iced tea once I told them it tasted bad. The staff was nice, and the sandwich was good, so I will possibly come back here again, but I will try lentil soup and stray away from any juices.",0.7964,0.854,0.113,0.033,0.5823071895424837

I found myself a bit intimidated by all the strange and interesting names on the menu so I decided to play it safe and order a combo plate.  That turned out to be an excellent choice for a first timer! I don't know what all the items on the plate were,but  I can tell you that without exception it was a party for my taste buds. The chicken had a shockingly great flavor and was not dry like white chicken meat can be. Also, the fried rice had a good flavor and it too was not dried out like a lot of restaurants serve.

I could easily eat this for three days. So much food all for less than $8.  Was not sure what to expect from the kefta, but rather than being a ground meat kefta it was juicy steak meat.

The chicken was tender and well-seasoned, the bed of hummus is laid on provided enough flavor, but not so much that it overwhelmed the chicken. I tried their ""hot sauce"" but I emplore you to proceed with caution as it will immediately clear out your sinuses. After trying a bite of someones falafel, the deal was sealed.

The location in the back of Jeweler's Mart makes this place seem like a hidden gem. On my first visit 2 years ago, I felt like I had stumbled upon a hidden secret of Chicago. It still seems very humble in its decor, but it has been packed with people every time that I've visited since. I think an upgrade of tables or decor (new tiles, perhaps?) would help the place, since it lacks the luxury of having windows or an easily accessible entrance. The vegetarian sampler plate is good but small in portion for the price. I wish that I had a picture of it to show the small quantity. I don't actively seek out large portions of food, but I left feeling slightly hungry.

The spinach pie consisted of a piece of pita type bread folded over and filled with cooked spinach and sprinkled with zatyr. It's like zatyr bread with spinach. But I really just wanted a spinach pie. One of my sides was the babaghanoush, which was overpowered with the flavor of smoke and lemon juice. Between the tartness of the zatyr, the lemony babaghanoush, and the pickled beets, I was on acidity overload from this meal. Unfortunately, the only thing to balance it out was falafal that was very dry and bland. The condiment with the meal had the flavor of tahini but the consistency of water. Why do places do this? The consistency of any condiment, sauce, or chutney is as important as it's flavor, and serving these watery substances is just wrong. I don't recall what I've had in previous visits, except once I had Foul, something analogous to hummus but made with fava beans. I'm not sure w  I will certainly give this place another try, because on the surface it seems like a place I should love.

For the meat lovers, point them to the direction of Chicken Shawarma pita sandwiches or, my personal favorite, their Tuesday Special:  Moroccan Chicken!  The shawarma overflows from the pita, perfectly grilled and blend of fat & thin meat, with hummus/ tahini to moisten the meal!    But the Moroccan Chicken is what I dream of every Tuesday... a HUGE meal with plenty of rice, 2 baked potatoes, and typically chicken breast + drumstick.

The place is pretty hot, since it's kinda located in an alcove.   I ordered the chicken schwarma plate over hummus.  Bad idea; I dont' like the hummus touching the chicken.  I personally don't think they go too well together.  The chicken was pretty good as was the hummus.   The best thing in my eyes was the hot sauce.  Y'know that red hot sauce all the Middle Eastern places serve?  This place had the best by far.  Better than Pita Express and Tazas.  It was a rich red color, and very thick comparatively.  Had a nice deep, full flavor.   With a drink, the meal came out to 9 bucks.  A little pricey ~$1-2 more than the average place, I would say. They have free pieces of crisped/burnt pita ends chililng on the counter.  Considering how much hummus they give you, not a bad idea to grab a few pretty tasty. For all you water drinkers, they have small cups next to the pop machine.   *gaaaah* I almost said 'soda,' gotta stop hanging out with east coast people.  In summary: Ambience:  very weird and interesting Food:  Good, but not stellar; hot sauce stands out Value:  a little pricey Overall:  cool place to check out...I mean c'mon...the location!",0.9633,0.796,0.149,0.055,0.5912411347517731

Tasty, quick food and pleasant service. The menu ventures a little further afield than the usual Lebanese with Moroccan chicken, moussaka, and foul. The competition (Haifa on Wells, that place at the State of Illinois bldg) seems cheaper and generally has better vegetarian fare, but nothing beats Sultan's Market. (FWIW, another Middle Eastern place recently opened, hermit crab-like, in its old Jewelers' Mall location.)",0.765,0.901,0.099,0.0,0.4608974358974359
2006-04-18,4.0,"Love this place.  It's a great respite from all the overpriced salad and sandwich emporiums of the Loop.  It's economical and the food, while being your standard Middle Eastern hummus and shwarma, is fresh and tasty.  Service is generally fast and polite.  It's not much in the ambience department and finding a seat at lunchtime can be tricky since there aren't many tables.  If it's a nice day, get your food to go and eat in Millenium Park, which is a block away.",0.872,0.803,0.147,0.05,0.5050000000000001

2005-09-01,3.0,"I've been going to this place for 13 years -- when your lunch choices are limited to crappy fast food chains in east Loop, this is truly an oasis, a diamond in the rough in Jeweler's Row no less, yar. Buried in the back, it's lacking in natural light and atmosphere, but the lunch specials are reasonable for what you get -- tasty if unexceptional Middle Eastern food.",0.0129,0.85,0.075,0.075,0.3232804232804233
2005-07-30,4.0,"This really is an oasis, as you may not find it until you realize it is in the back of the Jewelers Mall. This gem of a lunch spot has tempting Middle Eastern dishes like couscous, falafel, and baklava, a terrific break from burgers and fries.",0.6808,0.882,0.118,0.0,0.3
