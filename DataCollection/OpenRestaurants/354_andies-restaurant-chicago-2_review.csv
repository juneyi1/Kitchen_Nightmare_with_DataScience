2016-03-06,5.0,"Although everyone is entitled to their opinion, I honestly do not understand the negative reviews.  My husband and I have dined here on a few occasions and like it so much that we chose it for a private party for twenty guests, many of whom are critical diners.  If you are looking to host a private party, Gil is wonderful to work with.  He's friendly, accommodating, and professional.  In selecting our menu for the party, he even had a tasting menu prepared for us and delivered to our home.  This was a great chance for us to try items we hadn't tried before.  Typically when I dine out, I always choose a meat dish because I'm not vegetarian; however, the Moroccan eggplant dish that we were able to sample is so outstanding that I wouldn't hesitate to order it as my entree.  Absolutely fantastic flavors and it even won over my carnivore loving husband.  The blackened salmon is also delicious and if I'm not going to order my favorite Mediterranean dishes, gyros, which are delicious here, or chicken or beef kebobs, both the Moroccan eggplant dish and salmon would be high on my list.  Neither my husband nor I have ever had anything that we didn't think was fresh and tasty, from appetizer to dessert.  Speaking of appetizers, you can't go wrong with Baba Ganoush, their dolmas, spinach pies, or saganaki cheese.  All of these are excellent choices to begin your meal, especially the Baba Ganoush which is a great accompaniment to the warm pita bread put on the tables.  A small piece of baklava is a great way to end your meal, too.  All in all, the food is great at Andie's and we've only ever had great, friendly service here, too.  We knew that Andie's would be a crowd pleaser for our guests and everyone really enjoyed the food.  We were told repeatedly how much they enjoyed their dining experience.   Although the restaurant decor could use some updating, it doesn't factor into our decision to eat there or not as it does for other reviewers.  We drive to Lakeview from Logan Square to eat at Andie's because we know we will not be disappointed by the affordable, delicious food and treated with friendly service and these are the things most important to us when we dine out.",0.9986,0.737,0.246,0.017,0.6736046511627906

The food arrived exactly when it said it would.  I'm a vegetarian so Mediterranean food is great for me, and I've eaten from many different restaurants. This, by far, has been the most delicious Mediterranean meal I've had. I ordered the Vegetarian Combo #2 which includes Hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, falafel, feta, olives and cucumber sauce. The hummus and baba ganoush were so good.  They had slices of tomato, cucumber, and peppers in them as well. There was 1 olive in each. The tabouli was the same as I've always had. I wish there were more than 2 falafels, since that's the main reason I got the dish, but they were very good. Nice and crispy. Also the feta came in a stick, which was sort of confusing but still I love feta! When I ordered, there was no indication that the meal came with pita or not,  so I ordered a side of pita just in case (only .65) and I got 3 pieces. They were delicious and a good size, I just wish they were the kind that you could fill vs the flat kind I got, but still delicious.

2014-12-26,2.0,"Waste of money. Let's go point by point here. (1) Walk in and there is no host nor an obvious stopping place to wait for a host. When one comes out of the kitchen, he looks unhappy. Doesn't bother to say hello.  (2) This place is CRAMPED. We sat about 1 foot away from two really annoying women (they literally gossiped, loudly, the entire time). This is how all of the tables are placed. The waitress almost knocked our water over because the tables are too close together for her to move around the room. (3) The lighting is terrible. It's not romantic dark, it's just crappy light dark.  (4) Service is awful, but I don't think this is because of the staff; it's because they are so terribly understaffed that it's impossible for the one waitress who works there to take care of all those tables. For example, I asked for lemons for my water and then had to ask 3 more times before I finally got some 30 minutes later.  (5) Food is meh. It's definitely not worth the prices they charge. Saganaki was pretty good. Baba ghanoush was also pretty good. Pita tasted like it came out of the microwave. The meals were just sad. The salmon & shrimp was bland as were the sides that come with it. I literally could make a much better meal at home for half the price. $65 later...

2014-11-16,4.0,"We've taken the boys to restaurants a lot since they were about three months old. This morning we went to Andies in Andersonville for brunch, and I have to say they're the most kid-friendly restaurant we've been to with them. They brought the boys water in little plastic cups, have a great kids' menu, crayons to draw on the table (covered with paper), and even brought the boys some little stuffed animals to play with. We usually tip a little extra when we eat out with the boys to make up for the extra clean-up, but this place really earned it.  We had their brunch buffet, and they must've had at least a dozen different salads, salmon, short rib, shawarma, gyros, hummus, falafel, soup, two kinds of pasta, chicken, vegetable dishes, half a dozen desserts. It's a really nice spread, and for our whole family to be treated so well on top of that is more than just an added bonus.  I don't write many restaurant reviews, and usually when I feel compelled to write one it's because a place is so egregiously awful that I feel a civic duty to warn my fellow restaurant goers, but sometimes it's nice to so overwhelmed by goodwill for s place to feel the responsibility to praise an establishment that really gets it right (especially when they've been in business for years).",0.9761,0.845,0.13,0.025,0.4962454212454213

Didn't really matter much, it was just a little awkward (not really what you need on a first date). The ambiance was TERRIBLE! I could smell the musty carpet puffing up at me with each step I took. You sit on old, dirty cloth chairs and then, god forbid you have to pee, you end up in the grossest basement bathroom (great, more stairs I can fall down in my ""first-date heels"").

I'm vegetarian, so I appreciated the selection. But that's as far as I can go for complimenting the food. I had the lentil soup, which was too salty. I then had the Moroccan eggplant dish, which was recommended by the waiter. It was described as mildly spicy, but the eggplant was bland and overcooked. It was placed atop tomato sauce that didn't taste homemade. It was a fine meal. Not terrible, just not great. There wasn't much craft behind it. After we ate, we had this uncomfortable pitch to get dessert. I finally caved just so the poor waiter would stop trying to convince us. I mean - it was weird. Like he would get fired if we didn't order dessert or something.  So we share the baklava. It was sweet, but the phyllo dough seemed old and too crusty...

When we were ready to order.... he was no where to be found. There wasn't anyone there to flag to get our waiter.  There we were. Alone in the restaurant. Do we leave? Just as we were about to get up, two ladies entered the restaurant and the waiter magically appeared. Finally after settling them in, he comes to take our order without taking notes. Needless to say, he had to clarified our selections-- twice. As we sat waiting for our food... a rumble came from above. Apparently, they are doing construction on the second floor. Since we were by a vent, I was waiting for a puff of smoke of dust to come billowing out (thank goodness it didn't). The noise certainly was unsettling and not something you expect from a white(ish) table cloth restaurant. We flag the waiter and he mentions he will ask them to stop the construction after our food is up. Then he stood there.  Our food came out about 10 minutes later, and the construction continued. I ordered the beef kefta-- AMAZING, with the potatoes--- the sauce... wow. My friend ordered the choose your own kababs and said it was good.

Crispy pita slices with the subtle yogurt... Mmm. My shawerma was delicious. Thin slices of beef perfectly seasoned and cooked. I chose the dill rice as my side since everyone raves about it on yelp, and yum it was good. I didn't even need the tahini sauce, there was already so much flavor. My bf got the osco bocco. The lamb was very tender and fell right off the bone but lacked bold flavor. It was rather bland. He ended up adding salt. The asparagus side was a small portion. Pita bread was warm, soft, and yummy. We ordered the tiramisu dessert. It was light and looked pretty but not the best we had.

My girlfriend however, had a pretty horrible experience. We went to Andie's because of their large Gluten Free menu. After informing our waitress that she has a Gluten allergy the waitress went over the menu with my girlfriend and showed what was safe and what was not. She ordered the Beef Gyro Platter with the gluten free pita (which is from Rose's Bakery, so we know is safe). The look on my girlfriend's face when having a gyro for the first time in years was priceless and we were excited to have a new date night spot. However, hours later at home she was violently ill. My girlfriend does have Celiac disease, but normally doesn't get more than a stomach ache from cross contamination. I haven't seen her this sick ever!! If you have a Gluten Allergy, don't trust the menu here!!!

2013-11-10,1.0,"Really disappointed after last night's experience (which will be THE last).  Major buzzkill for an anniversary dinner. This used to be my one of my favorite restaurants - ordered from them all the time, went on first date with my now husband here, had my wedding rehearsal dinner here... and now I never want to go back. I've been frequenting them less in the past few years anyway for reasons I'll get to later, but when I saw there was a Groupon I thought this would be a nice nostalgic place to enjoy our first anniversary dinner.  I opted for the ""Dinner for Four, $30 for $60"" choice.  My assumption was that we'd have $60 to spend on whatever, regardless of the number of people in our party - and nowhere in the fine print did it say otherwise. JUST TO BE SURE this wouldn't be a problem, I told the server I had the $60 groupon, so we could get drinks, apps, etc. in addition to entrees, and he said ""great.""  My husband and I each got a glass of wine (which normally we'd never do), having been assured by the server that we could use the $60 for whatever, and two entrees. ***Side gripe - the wine glasses were small, and only half filled.  At average $7-8 a glass, I'd at least expect a full glass.  Since I was presuming these thimblefuls were covered by the groupon, I didn't complain but wish I would have now.*** When done with our entrees, I asked the server (who we thought might have also been the manager, as this location has a small staff and he seemed to be directing things) how much left we had on the groupon, thinking we could have a couple more glasses of wine or a dessert or something.  Now he did a complete reversal, and said to use the groupon we had to get four entrees, AND anything else ordered wouldn't be covered.  He claimed ""the system"" wouldn't accept it, then said the four entree requirement was written on the groupon, which it most assuredly was not.   Since we have no plans on returning, much less bringing other people, to use the groupon, we were forced to order two more entrees to go, then sit and wait a half hour while they were prepared.  The server in the meantime had the audacity to ask if we wanted more drinks or dessert.  AS IF!  To add insult to injury, when we finally got the to go orders, the leftovers from my dinner entree (which I'd asked to be boxed) were missing - he had to go back and get them, but at least they didn't throw them away.   I'll give him the benefit of the doubt about ""the system"" requiring certain things which he didn't realize before he tried to run the groupon, but the restaurant could have at least offered to cover the drinks, or offered us dessert, or SOMETHING.  There wasn't even an apology, just ""you have to order two more entrees now and wait for them or come back another time.""  This situation was terribly mishandled, and we felt cheated and taken advantage of.   As to the actual food, the reason we've been going less in recent years is that while the prices have shot up (from average entree price of $10-12 during the good ol' days, to average $16-$20 now), the quality has remained stagnant, if not decreased slightly.  For example, my husband got a lamb dish and I got a chicken, and they tasted/looked almost identical, and both were a little bland.  At a lower price point, I'd be reasonably satisfied, but at the price I'd expect better.  It seems they are trying to rebrand themselves as ""fine dining"" by just upping the prices, rather than also upping the creativity and flavor of the food.   Also, I was really excited (before actually going) about some the tasty looking seasonal menu items on the website.  It turns out these are only offered at the Andersonville location, not both, so that was lame too. Finally, the ladies' restroom at this location was dirty and rundown - there were visible stains, dirt, rust, etc. on multiple surfaces, neither soap dispenser worked, AND the whole place stank strongly of stale urine.  I mean... COME ON.  I'd expect this at a Taco Bell, not a place serving $20 entrees.",0.4318,0.84,0.081,0.079,0.47223072562358276

2012-12-17,2.0,"So, this is a review of their Thanksgiving dinner. I was in charge of picking the restaurant, and I specifically chose Andies because I thought to myself ""this restaurant will treat us right on thanksgiving"", since they are generally known for their welcoming atmosphere. To my greatest disappointment (and surely the disappointment of many who attended the restaurant that evening), Andies  was a complete and total letdown in terms of both food and service.  Let's start with the service. We all ordered the thanksgiving dinner and all items were a part of that dinner package. I am not criticizing my server, but rather the house which caused the following catastrophes: Server offers us two varieties of soup or salad. Later server comes back with all salads.....Server tells us they are out of soup so we just get salads....Some of us did not want salads...This is the house's fault yet they did not tell us ahead of time before serving the salads and we were not offered a comp of any kind. It's thanksgiving, what the hell kind of shit is this?  But seriously, running out of food on thanksgiving 2 hours before closing is really, really, bad form. On a holiday, a restaurant should have like 2 days worth of food on hand just in case... It's really completely unacceptable for them to be running out of food on thanksgiving. This was 6 p.m. and the restaurant was serving thanksgiving dinner until 8 p.m.  at least. And they were out  of soup....  Then there's the appetizer which still leaves my mind in a state of total confusion. I just don't understand how any semi-competent chef could have produced this appetizer. I really wanted to tell the waiter to have the chef come out to my table and look me in the eye and tell me he was proud of selling this to a customer. The dish was  $7 and listed on the menu as something like ""beets, mango, greens"" .  There was about a half a cup of really sour, solid, flavorless mangos diced thinly. They tasted like watermelon rinds(and not the good kind, I actually sometimes like picked watermelon rinds, anyways...), then there was a pinch of random greens on top(basically, filler, but not even that much of it), and then about a half a cup of thinly sliced beets. $7? A completely flavorless dish which is barely over about 1 cup of total food in volume. Then they serve us the turkey dinner. Mashed potatoes: tasted like they were frozen. Probably were frozen. If they weren't frozen then they were just really, really crappy potatoes. I tried both the regular and sweet potatoes....double fail. The turkey was the one thing that was decent, I'll give them that. But the stuffing....again I was not sure if this was some kind of a practical joke of a dish. Let me explain....the stuffing we were served.... It was like 20% breading and 80% raisins and other crap. The raisins...I mean this stuff was a  raisin dish with a few soggy croutons. This is my best guess as to what happened: I think they probably ran out of bread/croutons just as they ran out of soup, and then tried to scrape the bottom of the barrel so to speak, which was just the shit that fell to the bottom: the overcooked sticky raisins and other diced unrecognizables. How can they seriously serve this to us???  I just don't know what kind of alternate universe I landed in here... Then the pumpkin pie....I kind you not: frozen icy in the middle.  Yup. They used a frozen pie, and didn't even bother to thaw it out properly. Oh yea, pie is actually supposed to be medium to warm, not cold and not filled with ice.  The whole experience gave the impression that they were sleazily trying to pinch the Thanksgiving dinner for a buck, and so they were negligent and stingy, trying to cut corners and ultimately it felt like some sort of scam.....I felt scammed.

I don't really care about all this because if the food is good, that is all that matters. But by the end of dinner I was convinced that the state of disarray going on inside was definitely a reflection of the food.  My friend and I each got a cup of the chicken lemon rice soup, we split spinach pie and the kebob combination platter with filet and chicken.  The chicken lemon rice was thin and a little on the cold side. The pita they had in the bread basket was cold and it felt ""wet"" to the touch. Like, it wasn't just soggy. Now, the spinach pie was soggy. Honestly some of the worst spinach pie I've ever had. Isn't phyllo dough supposed to be crisp and flaky? I don't know how old the stuff was that I got, but come on guys..... you can get a better spinach pie in the refrigerated section of Whole Foods.  The kebob was just ok. A pretty small portion for the price, if you ask me. I ordered the filet prepared medium and it definitely did not come out that way.  Sad to say that the best part of the meal was the tzatziki sauce we got with the spinach pie and the basmati rice we got with our kebob.

It appeared like a fine dining establishment with outdated carpet and cloth linens and you had to go down a staircase, just seemed very strange to me. We got the food home and everything was good. Not the best I've ever had, but good. My big tip is that there wasn't enough pita for the amount of hummus so maybe order extra if you don't want to end up with half a plate of hummus and nothing to eat with it. The prices were fair and the amount of food for three people was perfect. Their website is ridiculous and they really ought to do something about that because if it wasn't for the fact that I was able to look them up on grub hub, I would have opted to forget the whole thing - that's how bad their website navigation was and there also wasn't any explanations to accompany the menu items. I will say that I was shocked and delighted to see that they deliver beer and wine. Always good to know in case of emergency! My other complaint I have is that I emailed them after this experience asking if I could use a coupon that had expired the day before. I wouldn't have minded if they just responded with a simple, ""no - I'm sorry"" but instead they chose to ignore my communication all together.

Every time I find myself with an avagolemo craving, or a Steak and Kefka kabob I decide to give them another shot.  I've given them about 5 tries now; and I will never order there again. They food is mediocre; dry; and often over seasoned. Last time I ordered a meal from them my plain tasted friend ordered a cheese burger. It was literally dripping with mustard. Far too much, even for a mustard lover like me.  Ordering takeout from them is an exercise in chance. 5 times I have ordered delivery and takeout from them; and 5 times they have screwed up my order.  These screw ups are not as simple as missing sides; but entire entrees missing; or completely incorrect orders being delivered.  When they finally do re-deliver the correct order; its very clear it has been sitting out waiting for the correction.  When I call them explaining the mix-ups they are not friendly, and make it seem that they are doing me a huge favor by delivering the correct order. Oftentimes the correction doesn't arrive promptly; taking over 40 minutes. Nothing like a cold dinner 2 hours after you order it.  The quality of the food is mediocre; and the prices are high for the food.

We ordered wraps and a sampler plate, and all of the dishes came splendidly prepared -- they were treats to the eye before they were ever treats on the tongue.

A couple other times he gave us $10 coupons off our next visit. The hospitality feels sincere and led us to ultimately look to Andies for the rehearsal dinner for our wedding. Andy worked with me on the menu until we got something right in my price range. We set up for 50 people downstairs and the night went off without a hitch. The food kept coming in waves, our guests remarking at every bite of something new that they took. Even my 70 year grandfather was all excited about it because he knows the greek/lebanese /Mediterranean fare is good for his heart.

And this brings me back to Andies, a middle eastern restaurant in Uptown on the corner of Montrose and Greenview.  I got introduced to this place mainly because I used to live right down the street from it...and since I LOVE middle eastern cuisine, I had to give it a try.  Thankfully, I did not move TOO far from it! To start with...the falafel at Andies is outrageously good.  Crispy on the outside and yummy on the inside.  Always a good sign of a good middle eastern restaurant. For dinner, I ordered the combo kabobs.  The dish came with dill rice...which was perfectly cooked.  The meat, excellently seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The medium rare steak kabobs were outstanding. Pair your dinner with your favorite red or white wine, and you are set. Another thing about this place...the dining room.  From the outside, you think that this is just like any other restaurant in Chicago.  However, when you walk in, you are seated in a dining room that is on the lower level of the building.  Quite, peaceful...and can be quite romantic with the right company.

First they bring pita bread to the table, hot from the oven, and ohhh, it's the best pita I've ever had. We always get an order of the baba ghanoush  to eat it with, but even with the unlimited pita, we usually can't finish it.

And it was all iceberg lettuce, one pepper, one olive, 3 strands of red onion, one hunk of feta and two awkward pieces of tomato. Not at all what we were hoping for. The hummus was good - the small portion came with plenty of pita. The main dish - the kabob combo was good - but all of the meat was a little dry. Not sure if the delivery zapped out the moisture, but they were not as good as I once remember having them.

2008-04-07,5.0,"I'm in LOOOOOOVE.  My dude and I were looking for a place to stuff our faces silly after a jog at Montrose harbor (thereby cancelling all benefits of jogging, but whatever), and decided to give this place a go because we kept passing it. When we went in with our jogging gear on, the first thought was ""Yipes, this place is way fancier than we're dressed,"" given the candlelit tables, the large windows and warmly classy decor, I was worried we were in over our heads. The staff, however, greeted us no differently than they would have were we dressed to the nines and sat us immediately.   The first sign that love was imminent was the fact that this was half-price-wine-bottle Wednesday. They do this every Wednesday, apparently, and once we realized we could have a bottle of wine for what it would normally cost for two glasses, the boy and I dove into a dry and fruity Chilean red, literally the best red I'd tasted in quite some time.  This came with delicious warm pita bread and some giardinera/feta cheese to top it with. The menu was diverse but had a lot of classic mediterranean food. Beyond saganaki, I couldn't get my eyes off the appetizers, much less decide on a meal.  Luckily for me, they had vegetarian special #2 which featured about half the appetizer menu: hummus, baba ganouj, tabouleh (basically a finely chopped salad -my palate detected tomato, cucubmer, garlic, mint, dill, and olive oil though there may have been more to it), tzatiki sauce, felafel, calamata olives, and feta cheese.  Two words to describe this combo. Best. Ever.  The felafels were crispy and a little spicy, the tzatiki sauce had so much dill it was a little green and enough flavor to hide the sourness of the yogurt (which is rare in tzatikis), and their baba ganouj has an amazing flavor with an undertone of garlic.  Suffice to say, I was considerably wowed.  They brought me more warm pita to scoop all that up with, and it was more than enough for me to eat plus take home for another meal.  I barely had enough room to taste the boyfriend's lamb shank, which was delicious and quite tender, so from that little taste I have little doubt that  they have great meat entrees as well. In ffact, I gotta try the artichoke chicken and the gyros soon. The desserts looked amazing too but I didn't have room. I could not have loved their staff more, either. They'd come to your table and joke around with you a little, the pita bread on the table was CONSTANTLY refreshed, as was the water, and they all were just as nice as can be.   For the bottle of wine, the veggie platter, the lamb, and the saganaki, we paid about $40, not counting tip.  Seriously, I have never had better mediterranean food than this, much less at a place where they treat you this well or you pay so little. Check it out and enjoy, but don't crowd up the Montrose one TOO much on Wednesday nights, because I will need my table back soon.",0.9969,0.777,0.166,0.057,0.5052083333333333

2007-03-31,5.0,"I am so excited about this place.  My friends picked it, and since I'm not huge on Mediterranean food I wasn't expecting much.  I was so pleasantly surprised.   At the risk of sounding a litle over-dramatic I dare say the food was almost orgasmic.  I had the lamb shank, and it was cooked perfectly...moist and tender.  It's a good thing I still had enough room for my entree, as the appetizers (hummus and bab ganoush) were so satisfying that I certainly took more than my fair share.  And I could go through one of those baskets of warm pitas just by myself.   Service was fantastic and friendly, the dining room was comfortable, and every once in a while they turned on a couple minutes of random, Godfather-esque music, which made me laugh.  My two friends and I had multiple appetizers, entrees, two desserts, two bottles of wine, and two pitchers of sangria, and paid about $60 each.  Not bad.  I wished I lived closer to Andie's....I'd  be a regular.",0.9885,0.72,0.239,0.04,0.577106227106227

Sarah D. nailed it with the lunch specials.. enough food (for me) for two meals at $4.95 a pop? Rock on!  I was pleased that the waiter went to ""find"" some lemonade for me - where ever he found it, it was good.. as was the red pepper hummus & the falafel sandwich.  Hooray for the home-made chips too!   I would have eaten here another time had they not been ready to close in 5 minutes.  I appreciated that the staff asked us to come in anyway, but with several bottles in tow, I didn't want to force them to stay for our little drinking party.  Gotta love the BYOB though..",0.9693,0.81,0.161,0.029,0.43636363636363634
