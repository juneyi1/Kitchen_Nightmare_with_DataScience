2017-07-30,4.0,"Lettuce Entertain You always does a good job with their concepts, and Mon Ami Gabi is no exception. Although it is one of the oldest concepts in the portfolio, it is showing no sign of age. This is probably due to its classic French Brasserie theming, which is perfect. As others have mentioned, the French bread served at the start of the meal is 100% authentic. We started by sharing the chilled seafood platter, which was a good deal considering all that it included, and was a perfect starter for a table of three. The artichoke appetizer is served chilled, which isn't my favorite, and I prefer a mayonnaise based sauce, but my companions like it. I liked my mousse pate, and it was even better with the brioche that accompanied the smoked salmon, which was also excellent. The mussels were also good, another classic preparation. Trout was just okay, a bit on the dry side, but my Prime New York strip was a top notch steak. As others have mentioned, the accompanying frites are unusually thin, more like ribbons than traditional pomme frites. We finished with chocolate mousse that was light and fluffy. The wine list is the weak spot of the restaurant. Somewhat logically it is all French. But except for some nice Champagnes there are no great wines on the list. They've obviously made an effort to keep prices below $200, but since the markup is about three times retail, there aren't really any wines on the list that manage a rating above 90 points.

2017-07-11,4.0,"What separates really really good from great? Mon Ami Gabi has been around forever- it was an early Lettuce Entertain You restaurant and it was in Lincoln Park way back in the 80s/early 90s. So how are things 25+ years later? I'd say excellent. The service is excellent- on par with the great Chicago steakhouses- you know, filled with a professional waitstaff that know their shit....that takes eating and wine/food pairing seriously....but isn't pretentious. The tables are tight together and this gives it a....French bistro....type feel. Yup. Imagine that. My only complaint? I like big California wines and France really doesn't offer that. Or....Mon Ami Gabi doesn't offer that. I ordered a 2012 Chateau Louvie St Emilion for $80+ (frustrating because it sells for $25-30 at liquor stores) and it was ok. I think they could probably reconfigure their wine list, still keeping it French, still maintaining good margins, but perhaps bring up the wine quality. The food, the service, the atmosphere?

Honestly, for amount of money, my food tasted okayish and the fries were skinny fries. I even was hungry after my meal. My friend's dish was not bad but nothing exceptional. The baguette they served us complimentary was re-heated in the microwave was chewy and inedible. i believe it is the location and the ambience l we paid for.

Once that group left it was better but because of how busy it was, we all started sweating after awhile. Our waitress I think was overwhelmed because she was running around and not making eye contact with our table often. She was very nice when she did stop but it took a very long time to get our food. She also brought out an ice cream with a candle for my mom but she had finished her dessert before we were ever even brought menus for dessert much less order dessert. We got there at 630pm and left at 930pm. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is that the service was poor this time.

Our waiter (seemed like he was French) was helpful and courteous--totally the opposite of the stereotype. For example, I ordered a beer and he asked if I preferred a glass or to drink from the bottle (which I do). Throughout the meal the service continued to be excellent from the server and back waiters. There were three of us and we all had some type of steak-- au poivre, Bearnaise,and filet with truffle Bearnaise. All delicious. Cooked exactly to our specifications. The aupoivre and Bearnaise came with pommes frites. Some reviews (and my wife) complain about the french fries as being too thin and crispy. Me, I loved them. Definitely different. Not your typical American french fry. For dessert we split a profiteroles. It was delicious and plenty for three. With two drinks and a 20% tip, the meal for three was about $150.

My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out because we had a gift card, and because we've never really eaten French food before (French fries don't count, right?). After our wait, we were led to our table...by the kitchen. Our table was in front of the kitchen door, so servers were always walking in and out. This would not be a problem, but there were plenty of open tables by the windows, where it wasn't so disruptive. However I understand that there is a set up as to where we get seated, so I wasn't entirely upset. It was super busy, so I understand the wait but it did take awhile for a server to take our orders. We were just sitting, starving ducks. Someone dropped off a loaf of their French bread and walked away after 10 minutes of us just sitting there. Another person dropped off butter and jam moments later. It took so long that I didn't even realize that the butter and jam was for the bread.  Anyways, we ordered the poutine, salmon & hash brown benedict, and steak frites. The benedict was really good, but the portions were on the smaller side. What they lacked in size, they made up in flavor. The poutine was alright. It was veeeery salty. My favorite was the steak frites with the green butter.

The service was over the top awesome.  They almost seemed a little understaffed because our waitress was running around like crazy.  There was other staff helping to clear the tables and bring food, but it was busy.  Despite the number of other guests, our waitress went out of her way to make us feel special.  At the end of the meal, we asked the waitress for the check and said we were in a bit of a rush to get going.  When she brought the check back, she said she was going to buy us champagne and dessert because we had waited so long to be seated, but decided to just comp our wine since we were in a bit of a hurry.  SO NICE.

The servers are knowledgeable on the meat and fish sources which makes me confident in dining there. Service is always great. The only minor complaint I have is that during happy hour, 5-6 pm, they don't give you a new glass of wine when you reorder but refill the one you have even if not empty, therefore you drink less wine. Mmm, I want my wine, even though it's happy hour wine! Desserts have consistently been good and they serve a small treat if you celebrate an event there.",0.9889,0.722,0.237,0.04,0.4905901116427432

The decor is a traditional french bistro with light relaxing music playing that created a nice atmosphere for a Sunday brunch.  I wanted to try a brunch cocktail so I inquired about the bloody mary but was informed the mix was not made in house so I opted for a fresh orange juice mimosa instead.   The mimosa was very light on the OJ so I requested a side of orange juice and the waiter was very nice and brought it without hesitation.  Egg White Omelet - egg whites, asparagus, spinach, peas.  I added jarlsberg cheese to it.  This was cooked perfectly, not too oily and the veggies were very fresh, including the peas.  It was delicious.  The hash browns were not that good but I prefer real chunks of potatoes to the stringy lukewarm hash browns that never seem fresh to me.   I asked for ketchup and tabasco for the hash browns as I planned to eat some of them anyway.   They give a baguette and butter to every table, but I told him not to waste it since I am gluten-free.  I ordered a side of gluten-free toast to accompany my omelet which came with a side of butter.  The toast was small but toasted to golden brown perfection and was good.

We received a list full with Restaurant recommendations for this city from a good friend. We browsed through them and found out that not many restaurants were open on a Sunday evening. Anyhow, we decided obviously for Mon Ami Gabi (which means my friend Gabi, if you don't know french :D) . The ""french cuisine"" restaurant has a lot of excellent reviews and we were eager to try it out. The restaurant is located in a beautiful hotel with free coat check (pretty neat if you wear five layers of clothing in this unbelievable cold weather).  We ordered following dishes: - Baked goat cheese as an Hors D'oeuvre - Bordelaise steak as the main -Vegetable tagine, frisee & kale salad (without the bacon), whipped cauliflower and brussels sprouts  We shared all the dishes because we wanted to try out as much as we could. First of all the service is excellent - very friendly and always made sure our glasses were filled up.   The baked goat cheese was swimming on a bed of tomato sauce. The sauce compliments perfectly the smooth & flavorful cheese. It was perfect with the crispy baguette on the side.   Everything was amazing. The creamy whipped cauliflower mash, the roasted brussels sprouts and the frisee and kale salad. I really recommend the vegetable tagine. I never had it before and the seasonal vegetables were perfectly cooked.  The highlight was of course the bordelaise steak, which was swimming in a red wine sauce & topped with caramelized onions. I would recommend to order it medium cooked or even raw because it is very thin. We ordered it medium well and it was more on the dryer side but still delicious!  I highly recommend this place and will definitely come back. OH, one more thing: It was really affordable.

As we didn't have reservations and happened to be an hour early before opening hours, we spoke to the manager and he said we could dine at 5pm as long as we were out by 6:15. No big deal for us  We ordered the escargot and onion soup for appetizers. I was very underwhelmed by the escargot as they come without the shell and were just overly chewy. The onion soup came out Luke warm and we actually needed to ask them to reheat (we are really not that picky so it's a big deal when we ask for them do something like that) also quite surprised it wasn't hot when we were literally the first guests in the restaurant. For main course we decided to have the seafood platter and the hangar steak in Merlot cream. Although we asked to have the seafood be served first, both entrees came out together. The seafood platter was mediocre at best but probably wouldn't order again (oysters were delicious though). The hangar steak was overly cooked and at this point in dining had also cooled so it was burnt outside and Cold inside. Refer to pictures for reference. Dessert was the caramel creme brûlée and found it to also be mediocre.  With the meal at this price point I would have expected more and the server just seemed completely out of it.

Because of this, NONE of us ordered from that menu and saved money by ordering off the regular menu. Despite the sour taste in our mouth from being deceived, the food was good. Not as extraordinary as I had anticipated but fine. We order 3 steaks and 1 salmon, 1 steak was a little dry, but she also ordered it medium well. Salmon was again cooked well, but not perfect. The sauce with the salmon was delicious, also the $5 plan green beans were cooked perfectly (I know, $5 for green beans, but I needed a vegetable). Chocolate mousse for dessert was fantastic, just barely sweet and super rich. Lastly we had profiteroles. The fudge was fantastic, the ice cream was great and the pastry itself was pretty good. Though if I did it again I would ask for a hot fudge sundae and skip the dough! Service was disappointing, not terrible but rather uninspiring for such a large bill. Maybe it was just the end of a long day, but when I pay as much as I did I kind of want to feel a little special, we don't do this every day. Overall it was fine. The dishonest restaurant week menu is enough to make sure I'll never go again, but if you do, you probably won't be disappointed, but not blown away either.",0.9959,0.709,0.235,0.057,0.5665363769022304

It was either bistronomic or Mon Ami Gabi and now I wish I tried the former instead of the latter. I've heard many good things about this restaurant so I was excited to try it. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with both desserts that we ordered. We got the classic profiteroles and the caramel creme brulee. The caramel creme brulee was average at best and didn't really amaze me. The classic profiteroles were hard as rocks and i didn't even get the chance to eat them because I gave up trying too. I'm pretty sure if I managed to I would've broke my tooth. My boyfriend who did try it though compared the vanilla ice cream to baby formula. Oh and when we got the desserts the waiter forgot to give us spoons.  Overall, there are better places for dessert.",0.7974,0.76,0.146,0.094,0.49941520467836265

I'd love to walk off the elevator and straight into this place everyday. The decor is kitschy yet tastefully playful French. It's super cute inside. Service was great and our waiter was very attentive.  For brunch, I was adventurous and got the chickpea cakes eggs benedict. It's exactly what you think, two small delicious and savory cakes made out of chickpeas, topped with poached eggs and a wonderful vert hollandaise sauce. I was a bit skeptical of the cakes, but they were crispy on the outside and had the perfect soft consistency on the inside.  It was filling but didn't leave me with the usual regret of a greasy (yet satisfying) brunch.

Overall a well executed classic steak frites dish!  Prior to being seated we hit the bar for a round of cocktails. I opted for the bourbon symphony which is a concoxion consisting of calvados, vourvon, cointreau, and lemon.

Not just the confined seating that Chicago (and French) restaurants are know for, but smaller as a whole. Because of it's location (in LPC and in a residential building) the clientele was older. It doesn't matter to us, it was just very noticeable.  The menu is the same as other and the other reviews highlight the better items. Our personal favorite is the escargot, muscles, and the Roquefort steak. I know it's terrible to request it, but a little dijon on the side with that and the frites was amazing.

We began our meal with their complimentary warm baguette and butter.  They also served us a weird trapezoid of shredded carrots. The French Onion Soup was good.  I feel like that's a hard dish to screw up. I ordered the 12 oz. NY strip steak and frites.  I appreciate that my server allowed me to sample both the bordelaise and bearnaise sauces on the side.  The steak was good.  The frites were excellent. We passed on dessert, but we did enjoy a bottle of the Louis Latour Bourgogne Gamay wine.  It's a very light red.  I'm normally a pinot noir guy, but my lady wanted something light.  This fit the bill.  At $40, it was one of their cheaper bottles. Our server was excellent. I would happily return to Mon Ami Gabi, though it's very expensive.  It will probably end up on my once-a-year list.",0.9932,0.749,0.22,0.031,0.6504861111111112

Once seated, service was well-paced and friendly. Enjoyed the classic steak frites, mussels, and yummy bread service. Also loved the bottle of 2012 Pinot Noir we had!

It is a bit LOUD and crowded in general.  We were walking around the neighborhood and decided to go depending upon the anticipated wait time.  They said close to 1 hour.  We thought about it and said, OK.  Well, it ended up being almost 90 minutes.  So they could use a little help with their planning and management.   Most of the staff was polite, but they could use to smile just a little bit more.  The place really is just a very well decorated production kitchen and the ""move 'em in, move 'em out"" drudgery likely wears upon the staff, or seems to.  So while it is OK, I would not go out of my way to go here.  Only go if you happen to be near it and it is very convenient, AND if you get the idea that it is not crowded that day.  Again, the food is OK, not great.",0.9877,0.835,0.149,0.016,0.5365196078431371

While the red wine bottles sat outside for single pours they were chilled to ensure they did not pick up the heat of the day.

First of all, they have a huge menu, but they don't offer it during brunch. The brunch menu is really small and there's nothing on it that differentiates it from any other breakfast place in Lincoln Park.  The wait staff was pretty stuck up and they forgot to bring us 3 things we asked for.  As far as the food, it was fine, but just fine. I had the salmon salad which was a piece of salmon on spinach basically, very underwhelming. My boyfriend had the steak and frites which was oily and the frites were awful.

2015-06-15,4.0,"Pure French comfort food that's a bit more elevated than expected. My wife and I have been here a hundred times. It's on our regular restaurant circuit and we always come here for special occasions because they just do it right. Overall, this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It's situated in the Belden-Stratford, across the street from the Lincoln Park Zoo & Conservatory. Going for a stroll through the zoo, then coming here for dinner is my favorite thing to do on a Saturday. During the holidays, Zoo Lights and dinner at Mon Ami Gabi is a tradition, but reserve early - it's also the tradition of many others! My wife and I honeymooned in Paris, and the first time we dined at Gabi's, we were immediately transported back there. There are a few clichéd things about the decor, but it's tastefully done. The bench seats are surprisingly comfortable, and even though it looks like you're going to be cramped, you are never intruded on by other diners and the theatrical touch of pulling out the table for you to sit is always a treat. As for the food, I've tried just about everything on the menu, but they specialize in Steak Frîtes - and have many options to choose from, which is really unique. I do have to recommend the Dijon, Classique and the Bordelaise treatments - mouthwateringly delicious and tender. Now, if you've never had a classic, Parisian bistro steak, you will be in for a surprise. Unlike American steaks, they take a strip and pound it thin. If that sounds weird, don't let it deter you. It's super tender and every bite is exceptionally flavorful. The frîtes are unique, and can take some getting used to (think of large, crispy potato sticks instead of traditional fries), but are a wonderful counterpoint to the tender steak. Other stars on the menu, which is seasonal for all non-steak choices, are the traffic-stopping Beouf Bourguignon and Braised Shortrib during the colder months. I often get the Trout Amandine, which is amazingly delicate and extremely flavorful, but this last time I ordered the Lemon Salmon... it was the best salmon dish I've had this side of Paris and was beautifully presented. Perfectly seasoned and seared with unbelievably tasty thumbelina carrots and a lightly minted pea purée with both peas and pea pods in it. I thought I died and went to heaven. Also, the Country Pâté is a special treat, but if you are a fan of Escargot, as I am, just get it and ask for extra bread - you'll definitely want to dip it into the garlic butter sauce after! They are simply perfect. It's very hard to go wrong here, even their soups are fabulous - their soup specials are invariably extraordinary and you'll love the presentation. For dessert, they have the usuals like an excellent Chocolate Mousse and Crème Brûlée but get the Crêpes Suzette if available. You will not be disappointed. The only thing I feel are a miss are the Mussels Marinìere. I used to live on the Atlantic coast, and really acquired a taste for small, meaty mussels. What they have here are the big, fleshy ones in a white wine sauce that doesn't work with my palette, but I've seen many others enjoy them. They have a very nice wine list, and even have excellent choices by the glass in their wine cart, unlike many other restaurants. Their house Pinot Noir is a solid choice, but I prefer their Côtes du Rhône when not having my usual. Speaking of which, I've racked up quite a martini body count here. Because their bartender makes them so perfectly, it's hard to limit yourself to 2... even though you should! Final thoughts are to come here for a great experience: delicious, upscale, comforting food and impeccable service. Every server superlatively executes their craft, but Amber and Vincent really shine. They are a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, so if you become a regular - and you likely will - pony up the $25 for the frequent diner card and sign up for the text promotion program. It is worth it.",0.9993,0.781,0.197,0.022,0.5607257326007327

When we arrived, we were greeted promptly and courteously by the hostess and seated at our table for two. The restaurant has segmented interior spaces that make the overall feel more intimate. Within moments of arriving at our table, we were brought water, a small plate of thinly sliced asparagus medallions in a light oil infused with lemon and what seemed like a hint of mint. The asparagus was covered with shaved Parmesan cheese and served with an accompanying loaf of hard-crusted artesian French bread in its own paper bag. And butter, of course! :D All wonderful. We both ordered the fuller bodied Pinot from their wine list, which was delightfully smooth and complex. For our appetizer, we both ordered the special heirloom tomato chilled soup, which was simply out of this world!! For our entrees, I ordered the Steak Frites au poivre and my wife ordered the Atlantic Char special. Both were excellent and prepared perfectly. For dessert, we had a miniature trio of offerings, including a chocolate mousse, a creme brûlée, and a profiterole. Divine! Our server Don was informative, attentive and polite throughout our entire dining experience. Price was $125 before tip, which we felt was reasonable for a nice dinner out.

2015-04-04,1.0,"With great excitement, I had made reservation for the promoted Seder Dinner for 7pm.  I even received a confirmation call the day prior.  Since I was recovering from surgery and unable to make the traditional dinner for my family, I thought why not.  We did arrive a bit early and was told our table would be ready a little after 7pm and took the hostess's suggestion to have a drink before hand.  By a quarter after 7pm, it became evident by the number of families that were now waiting in the lobby that it would be longer wait than anticipated.  I sent my daughter to inquire and she was told a few minutes.  Five minutes later, I went to the hostess and asked for an exact time.  She apologized since the tables were not clearing.  Looking at the computer screen, I counted at least seven reservations at 7pm.  For such a small restaurant promoting a holiday dinner, the answer was clear. They were completely overbooked. When pressed, she admitted that 7:45pm or later would be the time to be seated. Now I know why they call them wait staff.  This was unacceptable. I don't know if it was the inexperience of the staff or just incompetence. I cancelled the reservation and went to another restaurant nearby who also had a Seder Dinner.  We were seated immediately. Reflecting on my collective experiences with Lettuce Entertain You restaurants, I see the problem and it truly runs throughout the numerous restaurant variations. So it must be a management prerogative.  This organization really is not a customer-oriented. Reservations are meaningless.  As a frequent dinner at LEY, you have finally lost me.  I will not be returning to Mon Ami Gabi or any other property for as long as I can remember this awful experience.",0.9042,0.823,0.113,0.064,0.4303333333333334

I was even more pumped after dining at the Chicago location, since it's just as excellent as its Vegas counterpart.  -Tip #1: the entrance is located in the lobby of the Belden Stratford building -Tip #2: check out the Lincoln Park Zoo (for free!) across the street afterwards Went here for Sunday brunch. Reservations were easy to get, as we were able to make reservations 1 hr before our desired brunching time. I always get the steak frites or the croque madame whenever I go, both of which are amazing and I highly recommend them for anyone dining here for brunch for the first time. However, today I was feeling adventurous so I decided to try some new things. I ordered: -Creme brulee french toast: A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. The french toast was thick and prepared beautifully. The entire dish had just the right amount of sweetness. It comes w/ a blueberry compote that is just heavenly. This dish was shared, and now I'm really wishing I had just ordered it for myself! -French kiss breakfast sandwich: this was a bit messy to eat, but worth it. I had no shame looking like a 2 year old w/ food all over my hands and mouth! If you like chicken liver, you'll like this sandwich. Plus, there's a fried egg on it - how could you possibly go wrong?

They have amazing appetizers and awesome desserts.  My only problem with this place is that the service was semi annoying. When I called on the phone to double check to see if my reservations were good, the lady acted like I was wasting her time and she rushed our conversation. The waiter we had didn't even introduce himself which I thought was really odd since that's how all restaurants are. Fortunately this did not ruin our night because the goodness delicious!  Wild Boar Ragu was a great dinner choice; the meat would fall all over in your mouth. The appetizer was baked goat cheese with bread and marinara sauce. It's divine! I couldn't stop eating it. Depending on what day you go, double check with what the specials are. For some reason, we weren't told what it was, but there's a board around to show you what they have, but it's not all over their wall so Id recommend just asking the waiter instead. This is the second french restaurant I've been to and one thing I notice is that they love to fill up their space. It looks cramped, but it doesn't feel that way. The interior design has that kind of ambience of how you would want your romantic night to be.  So, not everything can be perfect but Mon Ami Gabi will deliver to your standards. They might not be the most welcoming or friendly (like being on your phone at the front desk), but that won't ruin your night whatsoever.

Mon Ami is a small, intimate French bistro, and the ambiance is definitely part of the experience. It's located across from Lincoln Park Zoo, in the Belden Stratford building. The Belden is now a luxury apartment building; they stopped being a hotel a year or so ago, which was a tragedy. Regardless, Mon Ami Gabi has a a relatively small menu, but each item is carefully crafted. I got the 22oz bone in ribeye, which is pan fried and comes with fries (frites).

Perfection. The steak frites are a HUGE serving, so delicious and such a reasonable price.

I figured we could walk in and get a table for 2 no problem, but that was not the case.  The restaurant was busy and slightly smaller than I imagined. We were given a 45 minute wait, so we grabbed 2 of the six seats at the bar. The bartender was super cool. I tried the gringolandia beer, a Latin-Chicago fusion beer that I hadn't seen anywhere else.  After about 30-35 minutes we were seated.  We tried the butternut squash soup but ended up splitting the onion soup instead, which was a bad decision. The butternut squash was wayyy better. And the french bread they provide is perfect for dipping in the squash soup. We ordered a bottle of dark red wine from the south of France, which went really well with the filet mignon. I was extremely happy with my entreé selection: The filet mignon grilled medium rare, with a side of sauteéd mushrooms subbed for the fries. (Tip: most restaurants will allow you to sub a side for the 'steak frites' or whatever they have, which is basically just a fancy way of saying steak and fries).   Also important to note was that I chose the merlot butter option, not the other filet option. My buddy got the regular and when he tried mine he knew he had muffed that one.

Drank a bottle of Bordeaux, paired nicely with our steaks :) We ordered the Banana Foster Crepe for dessert. I'm still dreaming about it.  Our waiter was great.

Our waiter ended up being very kind, but it didn't quite make up for the bad first impression. The portions were HUGE! I had been eyeing Mon Ami Gabi for years, so naturally I knew exactly what I wanted to try. However, a starter, main course, and dessert were wayy too much. I was full a couple spoonfuls into my French onion soup! But aside from the fact that I was unable to finish anything, the food quality was kind of disappointing. The French onion soup was basically all onions - no soup - and the steak was chewy with tasteless, limp fries. For more than $50 a person, I was expecting the food to be better than what you can get at Olive Garden! Overall, I don't think I'll be back to Mon Ami Gabi. It just wasn't worth it for the money.

A generous pile of thin, crispy fried potatoes are delicious after being tossed in the remainder of the steak juices and whatever bearnaise is left over. As a starter the warm kale, bacon and soft poached egg salad was very nice in addition to the obligatory warm French baguette and butter. Warm chocolate cake with whipped creme fraische was a perfect end to the meal and large enough to split with my choco-holic father. The service style was a little rushed for a Monday evening, but that may be attributed to the special Seder dinner that was being offered. Nonetheless, our server was attentive, kind and brief.

It's a cozy, casual, romantic atmosphere tucked away in a cute boutique hotel. People are seated somewhat close to each other but of the 3 other tables that surrounded ours, everyone was extremely friendly and cordial throughout the night even though there was a degree of bumping eachother between servers and bathroom breaks.

2014-02-02,3.0,"To be honest, I was disappointed with my recent experience during Restaurant Week, mostly due to the service perspective and less due to the food aspect. Two of my girlfriends and I met at Mon Ami Gabi for a dinner reservation this past week at 7:00. We ended up waiting past our reservation time because the hostess offered us a better round table by a window, if we were willing to wait (which we did). It was nice to be at a table that was off of the beaten path of the restaurant, but my complaint about the table itself is that it was round and the white paper on top was square and was jutting out. It was an annoyance for the entire meal, even after I adjusted my seat.  Our waiter just seemed rushed and disinterested in our table the whole night. When we weren't ready to order the first time he came by, at least 15 minutes passed before he came by to check on us again. I asked for a small substitution with my salad, just balsamic vinegar and oil dressing instead of the dressing from the menu. When our food came, the salad wasn't dressed and there was no balsamic vinegar and oil. It was a runner who brought the food and our waiter didn't check back for another 5 minutes after we had already started.  Although we stayed for over two hours, the waiter never once spent more than 30 seconds at our table explaining the menu, asking us how our dishes were, or otherwise checking in on us. I was very disappointed considering the good impression I had of Mon Ami Gabi before this experience...but since my friends' dishes looked good (and I didn't have anything but a salad), I may be back at another time to try it again.",0.2926,0.871,0.068,0.061,0.42758620689655175

The escargots was infused with butter and herbs, which gave it a green tint and it did not look very appetizing, but it tasted pretty good. The skatewing and the trout were excellent and the steak frites were delicious, but the frites were a bit to crunchy. We got a dessert trio, which consisted of a mini crème brulee, a chocolate mousse, and an orange sorbet, all three were YUM-O.

I thought it was on the sweet side but it was still good.  We both ordered the steak and frites. He ordered his steak medium and I ordered mine medium rare.

So everyone made plans, hired babysitters, and got ready for a fun night out when the day finally came last night. I called the restaurant myself to confirm and also let them know my group had shrunk to 10 people. So our 8:00 pm reservation was about to roll around and one additional couple was able to make it. I called the restaurant to let them know and they almost had a heart attack that my group was now 12 vs 10 (remember that for two months it was 14 up until I called myself to confirm). They told me that they couldn't possibly seat 12 on time and that I'd just have to wait. So, we waited, and waited and waited until almost 10 pm!!!!!  No drinks were offered to us, no special accommodations, nothing. Just a very rude and unapologetic hostess. So we all left and ordered pizza. What a waste of a night, a waste of babysitters, etc, etc. Mon Ami Gabi and Lettuce Entertain You restaurants should be ashamed about this service.

That said, I was there as a guest for a birthday party in a private room with limited menu choices.  What I ordered, mushroom soup, salmon, root vegetables were all pretty good.  I know the French like to slather everything in butter and add lots of salt, which helps but not really my thing, but, hot and tasty it was.

2013-10-26,1.0,"So very disappointed. I had such high hopes for Mon Ami Gabi -- we love French food, it's in a beautiful building close to our apt, and it came so highly recommended by our friends. We're new in town, and French food is one of our favorites. Perhaps it was an off night, but neither the food nor the service is something we're looking forward to experiencing again. We had dinner on a Saturday night a few weeks ago (10/12). We ordered cocktails after being seated, and we waited almost 15 minutes for them. They were quite tasty, but the wait was overly long. The appetizers, both pâtés, were very good, nothing to complain about there. The entrees, however, were such a disappointment. My husband ordered the beef bourguignon, and he barely ate half of it, because it was so overwhelmingly salty and bacon-y (two flavors that he prizes above all others, in fact!) that it wasn't really edible. Had they reduced the sauce too much? I don't know. The pasta in the dish was, according to my husband, ""old."" It was chewy, no flavor, and the texture made him think it had been sitting around for a while before someone dumped the sauce on it. I had the steak frites, and the steak had been overly pounded to the point that it literally tasted like hamburger. The au poivre sauce was good, the flavor was where it should be, but I felt like i was dipping flat pieces of hamburger in it, which was not the experience I was looking for. Also, we weren't fans of their fries, but I think that's just a matter of personal taste - they were basically crispy potato peelings, so thin that there was no actual potato flavor. Nor was there anything to dip them into, which would have at least helped. I prefer standard frites, fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. But some people may like these! We did not. Interestingly, our waitress was otherwise occupied and never asked us how we were enjoying our meals. We would have told her. Dessert was fine, we had the bananas foster crepe. It was good, pretty much as advertised. However, we waited 10 minutes for our server to notice that our plates had been cleared before we could order it. And once we were finished, it took our waitress another 15 minutes to stop by and see if we were ready for the check. The entire meal took two hours, which was ridiculously long, considering that at least 45 minutes of that time was spent with neither food nor drinks in front of us. I have heard such great things about the service at Lettuce Entertain You restaurants, and that was not at all what we experienced. I find the service to be consistently better at Wow Bao, another LEY restaurant, and they basically serve fast food there. However, they are friendly, they are on the ball, and they notice when you've been waiting too long. That was not the case with our Mon Ami Gabi visit. We were so hopeful to find a local restaurant similar to Les Halles in New York, where we used to eat frequently, or Petit Louis in Baltimore -- somewhere with great food, reasonably priced, bistro- or brasserie- style atmosphere, excellent service, and never a bad meal. We were disappointed that we found none of those at Mon Ami Gabi.",0.9971,0.794,0.156,0.049,0.4749015151515151

We arrived about 15 mins early for our reservation and was told it was going to be about a 30 minute wait.  That was fine - it was a Saturday night and the place was fairly packed.  We sat up at the bar and ordered glasses of Beaujolais Villages.

He brought us a warm petite baguette with this pickled carrot slaw.  We didn't want to fill up on bread so started to look at the menu. We started with the warm brie accompanied by black pepper honey, hazelnut and croutons.  The brie was creamy and mild and the honey and hazelnut balanced the dish out very nicely. We ordered and split a frisée, kale warm bacon salad and it was heaven!  Wasn't drenched in dressing, right amount of everything and we both had a poached egg on top. For dinner, I had the chicken grandmere with a side of whipped cauliflower. The chicken was SO moist and tender and bursting with flavor.  My friend thought I was being inappropriate with my food with all the noises that I was making...LOL ( she was teasing of course) She had the caramelized sea scallops.  There were 5 huge nice and sweet tender scallops on her plate.  It was SO good.

I'm a total points whore, so I can never pass up an offer like this. Other than a few missteps from our server (he just seemed a bit out of it), it was a near-perfect evening; from starting out with a flawless French 75 (who doesn't love a cocktail named after a firearm?), to ending with one of the best desserts known to mankind. Our appetizers were a half-dozen fresh oysters from Prince Edward Island, served with mignonette, cocktail sauce, and fresh horseradish. We find cocktail sauce a great accompaniment to shrimp, but way too sweet for oysters, so we asked for some hot sauce (when we placed the order). The oysters came without the hot sauce and the horseradish so we had to remind our server, and he brought them out quickly. One of the oysters was ""funky,"" and no one wants to end up sick over a questionable oyster, so that one was left uneaten.  We also enjoyed the soup du jour, which was a chilled asparagus soup. I've never had a cold asparagus soup before, and it was absolutely delicious. It was the embodiment of summer in a bowl. Our mains were steak frites, served with bernaise sauce, and the trout almandine (with the almonds on the side). Again, these were near-perfect. The trout was flaky and delicate, and had a light brown-butter sauce and some haricots verts. I'm not a huge fish lover and I gobbled this up. The steak was cooked perfectly, and it was marbled, so it had tons of flavor; the naughty bernaise sauce only added to it. I'm not a huge fan of their frites; they're too thin and crispy, almost shard-like. I prefer matchstick fries over these. Desserts are another area in which MAG excels. Years ago, they used to have a dessert I so loved called strawberries Briand, which was fresh strawberries in Grand Marnier, and sour cream sorbet, sprinkled with some brown sugar. Then they took it off the menu and I cried, so when I spied it back on the menu last night, I was overjoyed. It was even better than I remembered. Strawberries (from nearby Green City Market) in a pool of luscious juice, nicely offset by a tart, refreshing sorbet. And of course I can't not get profiteroles, and they allow you to just get one, instead of the three that typically come in an order. Prices are surprisingly reasonable as well. My trout was $17.95; I've paid more than that for fish at Dunlay's (which is a neighborhood place), and the steak wasn't priced much more than that. I also adore their patio, which overlooks beautiful Lincoln Park. On a summer evening, it doesn't get much better than sipping a cocktail or glass of wine, eating a delicious dinner, and watching people and dogs strolling by. This isn't quite a five-star review, but it's much closer to five than four. I just love this place; it never disappoints.",0.9968,0.772,0.17,0.057,0.5886692176870748
2013-06-26,4.0,"I have a confession: I'm not a big fan of steak frites! (GASP) Rather than ordering one of the many varieties of their specialty entree, I went with the chicken palliard, a thin chicken breast well seasoned with herbs and lemon-asparagus on the side. And...it was fine. Was it special? No.  However, my appetizer (onion soup) and dessert (chocolate mousse) were both delicious! The onion soup was my absolute favorite part of the meal, other than the wine. ;] As an appetizer it is a fairly large portion, filled with gooey cheese and crusty bread. Flavorful and not too salty. Yum! I'd definitely order this again. The mousse dessert was so rich that it should be shared between two people. If I were to order the mousse again I would request it without the chocolate balls on top. They distracted from the smoothness of the dessert.  Other than the chicken entree being so/so, my only other complain is that the plexiglass barriers lining the outdoor patio sorely need to be replaced. They are covered in scratch marks, and even worse, MOLD between the panels!  A pleasant place to dine, and especially good if you like 1) steak frites (everyone else I was with ordered this and they all cleaned their plates) or 2) great onion soup.

Both have always been outstanding. On our most recent trip to Mon Ami Gabi, we were sat a few minutes after our reservation, and the hosts and server were very gracious and apologized for the wait- they made sure we were taken care of all night! (And keep in mind, we hadn't said anything or complained, they were just very on top of things.) The food is always incredible; fresh, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned. The wine list is great too, and I'm always impressed at their array of wines by the glass and classic cocktails. Our server Eleni was incredible. She was very friendly, extremely knowledgeable about the food and wine menus, and was very attentive. Mon Ami Gabi has that kind of unobtrusive service, where you don't realize your empty glass or plate has been cleared, or that your water has been poured, or that your new glass of wine has arrived (that's my favorite!). It was the perfect balance of friendly, outgoing, and attentive service without being overbearing or annoying (i.e., the server who wants to tell you their life story).

Mon Ami Gabi makes French food approachable without completely Americanizing it. I appreciate that. The service however, definitely not up to the standard I would expect at the restaurant. We had to ask for menus for a couple members of our party who were seated without them. Our waiter took a very long time to take our order for appetizers and entrees. We ordered a bottle of wine which he managed to splash everywhere and then removed from the table when there was still some left. The table next to us had far more people sitting at it than it had capacity to hold which resulted in a very tight experience.  The one benefit of our bad service was the waiter mishearing us order brie and escargot as appetizers and brought us three orders of escargot instead.

The woman at the door isn't super friendly but I think that comes with the job of working the door. The place is small and they try to fit in as many tables as they can, but I didn't feel cramped or inconvenienced by the tables going in and out.  We had Ryan who waited our table- super nice, really friendly and very helpful. He even comped us a creme brulee since we were wondering which dessert to have. Thumbs up to him! We had the steak poivre, the bearnaise, the roquefort and for appetizers, the ratatouille, the asparagus and the escargots. I LOVED the escargots, the sauce was really well made. The paste for the ratatouille was good, but I would give it a miss next time. The asparagus was delicious and was the largest surprise- they had made it with slivers of lemon and were cooked perfectly, just an edge of al dente.  Of the steaks I would recommend the bearnaise- this is the hardest sauce and they made it extremely well. I would also recommend the steaks be prepared medium rare. For dessert, I would recommend the fruit crumble. The brulee was not exactly the souffle-ish texture that is aspirational, but is a good solid option (no pun intended). I would give the profiterolls a miss.  The place itself doesn't really look all that french to me. Lots of wood, it reminds me of the inside of a french house perhaps, your uncle's dining room.

I came here with a party of 4 on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We were seated right away in a crowded booth really close to other tables around us. It didn't bother me too much because I kinda got use to this at other restaurants.  Now for restaurant week, you get to choose from a three course menu (appetizers, main course, and dessert). I started with the Onion Soup Au Gratin, which is French Onion Soup. This was actually very good and I was actually going to get the Frisee, Kale & Warm Bacon Salad based on fellow Yelpers pictures, but I changed my mind when the table next to me order it and it smelled so yummy! My main entree, I went with the Steak Frites, which is just a steak and fries. The steak was okay for the most part. I am not sure if it's the sauce (Bordelaise) I got mine with, but I like the fries more than the steak. Finally, to wrap the night up, they serve you a dessert trio, which includes sherbet chocolate mousse, and creme brulee. The sherbet was amazing and the creme brulee was my second favorite of the three. I didn't like the chocolate mousse, but I am not really a fan of chocolate mousse.

We had some high expectations for Mon Ami Gabi as for weeks now the husband has been calling the day-of for a reservation, always rejected.  He then asks if we could walk in....always told no.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it is a Lettuce place, so expectations weren't too high; high enough because we had trouble getting in and because the menu sounded nice.   Pros:  Food.  All the food was really good.  We had the brie, very nice.  Spilt a Caesar salad (I'm a bit baffled at how they charge $10 for it), tasty and generous with the cheese.  My filet with the merlot sauce, under temp which was eh, forgivable but very tender and good.  I wasn't much for the merlot sauce.  His strip steak, good.  My pinot blanc, very tasty.  His bottle of wine, good he said but he felt he overpaid. Plus and minus:  Frites.  Not what I expected at all.  It's like they take the cottage fries from RJ Grunts and put them through a pasta machine set at fettucini.  They were good, they tasted exactly like the cottage fries, just not what I was expecting.  Profiteroles....good, though they pre-portion it and pop it back in the freezer.  That doesn't do nice things to cream puffs. Weird, not good, or bad:  The service was strange.  Our server stared at me all night.  He was kind of on auto-pilot so anything out of the ordinary seemed to startle him.  He was pleasant though and did a nice job otherwise.  The food was coming too quickly so we asked him to slow it down.  Slow it down he did, to the opposite end of the spectrum of ok, um, we didn't mean stop completely.  We ended up having to ask for our entrees. Further thumbs down:  I understand they're trying to go with that French bistro theme and all but c'mon, do the tables really have to be that close together?  In Lincoln Park of all places?  We got stuck next to this freaky foursome of loud talkers.  ""Oh yeah, that was the best funeral I've ever been to!"" and ""Here's a photo of us at blah blah blah....And here we are at the bris!""  Oh dear.  Really?  Thankfully the couple on the other side of us used their inside voices.

It has become a tradition in my family to go every year before we head back to school and for my mom's birthday for over 7 years. Every year I find myself looking forward to the night. Mon Ami creates a comfortable and special dining environment where they deliver delicious dishes. Our server has always been great- they really help make the evening.  My favorite cocktail is the French 75. Its a crisp and refreshing way to start your delicious (and rich) french meal. Next up I always get the frisee salad. The bacon is always so thick and smokey which perfectly complements the vinegary dressing. I love this salad and crave it all the time. For entrees, the scallops and stakes are always delicious. The scallops are perfectly carmelized and the sides complete the dish well. The steaks are always delicious, generously portioned, and cooked perfectly. Do not get my started on their fries. I am constantly picking them off other peoples plates if I do not order it myself (good thing that there are always PLENTY for sharing). All of the entrees are classic french and they are BIG. Splitting works perfectly well if you aren't very hungry.  If you have room for the dessert, the profiteroles are always delicious. The chocolate sauce is homemade and delicious.  If you are looking for a special evening in a comfortable atmosphere with fantastic food, Mon Ami is the spot for you! Bon apetit!",0.9978,0.721,0.279,0.0,0.6141534391534393

We also had the oysters which were nice and fat not like the 'standard' oysters that you get in most places in Chicago and the mussels which had this sauce that I had to resist just picking up the bowl and drinking. The waiter was very nice and attentive and his suggestion for a wine was awesome. This is a great spot to take a date, it's nicely lit and friendly but intimate.

I ordered the Steak Bordelaise which is a 10oz cut on thin steak marinated in red wine and drowned with sweet caramelized onions served with a large heaping helping of home made frites. DELICIOUS. The onions were a nice compliment with the potatoes so ketchup was unnecessary.The thin cut of the steak made it hard not to devour so take your time eating. It's a very filling meal.

We started with a loaf of warm French bread served with butter and a carrot purée which was good.  For beverage a bottle of Marquis De La Tour Brut. Which was neither too sweet or too dry.  Our hor d'oeuvre was the housemade country pate served with cornichons, whole grain mustard, and warm country bread toasted triangles. Very delicious. The pate was vaguely salami taste and complimented well by the mustard. The olives and pickles with it were nice. He ordered the steak frites classique with maitre d'hôtel butter medium well. Which he liked. I got the steak frites classique with maitre d'hôtel butter medium well with a side of the macaroni gratin too. The steak is large but thin and cooked accordingly. The macaroni gratin is similar to mac and cheese but creamier and baked and bubbly. Almost a casserole. I enjoyed them very much. I did not try my frittes but they looked enticing and are very thin crispy pieces in a big portion. For dessert since it was a special evening and celebration our server brought .... Strawberries braind with sour cream sorbet. And Butterscotch pot de creme with whipped cream And  Profiteroles with pate a choux filled with vanilla ice cream, covered in homemade double chocolate fudge hot sauce and a lit candle for me.

As we were seated, we were given a loaf of warm bread, butter, and a small shredded carrot salad.  Their wine list is also decent, and I had a lovely glass of Cote du Rhone. The french onion soup was absolute perfection.  It wasn't too salty, and there was the right ratio of bread to cheese to soup.  The portion was also giant...I didn't finish it because I was already starting to get full and I was afraid I wouldn't have room in my stomach for my steak frites (that fear was completely warranted, as it turned out). The steak frites...don't you love it when you order a steak medium rare at a restaurant and it actually comes out medium rare?  You'd think that it would be easy to do, but you'd be surprised at the number of restaurants that fail to cook steak to your preferences.  I digress.   Anyway, the slab of meat was GIANT.  The heap of frites was GIANT.  They say size doesn't matter but I sure did appreciate a big ol' plate of meat and potatoes in front of me.   I got my steak with the Bordelaise sauce (red wine and caramelized onions) and my only complaint was that the sauce was a little sweet for my liking, but this was completely my fault...caramelized onions are just naturally sweet.  I think I'd try the peppercorn sauce next time.  The fries were definitely different from what I expected...skinny and crispy.  But I loved them!  Unfortunately, there was absolutely no way I could finish all of my steak, let alone the fries. Dessert was a trio of creme brulee, chocolate mousse, and grapefruit sorbet.  The creme brulee and chocolate mousse were amazing.  The grapefruit sorbet was a little bitter and jarring after you had the other two, but after a while, it was really refreshing.

Saw our waiter very briefly  three times..he was very anxious to take our order, we were not ready, once order taken we had to get attention of other waiters..staff.. 3.   The steak and pomme frittes were delicious, the escargot perfect and the profitolerros, scrumcious...but for some reason, we felt a bit rushed, a bit ignored.. BUTTTTT..this is a french bistro and this may just be the flavour the ambiance that Mon Ami Gabi wishes to exude... 4.

2012-02-03,5.0,"Whenever my family comes to visit we go here. It's one of the only things we can agree on. It's got a nice spot on the lake. I had a birthday dinner here once awhile ago with six people. Somehow they botched the reservation and we ended up waiting an extra 45 minutes waiting for a table. It was fine, but the staff went overboard compensating for it. Free appetizers? Sure. ALL of them. I have now tried all three cheeses - the baked brie with honey drizzle and nuts is a favorite. Good salad. Really wonderful creamy and salty mushroom soup. They also have a very good choice of wines, which is impressive, because the bottles are not overpriced. I always get the same entree here after years, and it is the steak au poivre medium rare. It is always the same: pounded-thin steak with brandy peppercorn sauce. Right amount of heat, super super tender, and sopped up with thin, flat, crispy airy potato curls that really aren't that frite-like. That same botched reservation got us dessert too. The little profiterole with a candle in it always warms me a little bit. The mousse with crispy espresso balls is the single best thing this restaurant serves, and they brought it out special in addition to the rest of the free stuff because I mentioned that I loved it. It was a 2 hour recovery for all of us afterwards, but it was one of the best. I love coming here even when it isn't over the top like that, and I have several times since. I agree with the reviewer who hates that there are kids here, but it's allowed because of who owns this place - Lettuce Entertain You is supposed to be 'family friendly,' which as a snotty and easily annoyed single person in Chicago, I sometimes resent. But LEY must be doing something right, because at all three of their restaurants I like (Osteria via Stato, Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, and here) seem to disguise the fact that they are part of this huge chain really well. Normally there is a lot of chain hostility. Including from me. But not here.",0.998,0.714,0.237,0.05,0.5505912698412698

2012-01-06,3.0,"Mon Ami Gabi, it's good to know that not all French eateries are out to strip our wallets naked.  Mon Ami Gabi is a beautiful restaurant located within the historic Belden Stratford Hotel, making it the more classy. It overlooks Lincoln Park and can be a scenic walk in the winter with the Christmas lighting.  We arrived on a Friday evening late for a reservation but we were seated within minutes. Light is dimmed out and space is very tight. The server had to pull our table out just so I could ease my way through and be seated. (Mind you, I'm 5'2 and well below 110 pounds.)  Here's what we had: 1) escargots de bourgogne (snails) 2) chicken liver mousse  3) all-natural chicken breast paillard 4) roast chicken & frites  The chicken were just regular chicken entrees with nothing overwhelming. Instead, I found the appetizers to be more of a charm and breath-taking. The snails were soaked in a garlic-herb butter. It came in six bite-size pieces and I wish there were more. The chicken liver mousse resembled a 2""x6"" piece of spam. Don't be fooled! The taste was subtle yet irresistible when paired with the burgundy red wine mustard. Had I knew the chicken entree was so bland and simple, I would've easily given it up for another order of chicken liver mousse.",0.976,0.86,0.127,0.014,0.6397096730430063
2012-01-03,5.0,"First of all, Mon Ami Gabi is a beautiful restaurant, overlooking Lincoln Park and for the holiday season, it is bedecked with amazing lighting inside and outside of the historic Belden Stratford hotel, a lovely property.. It was a bustling night and the service was better than impeccable, personable and  professional in every way. The décor resembled a fin de siècle Parisian bistro on the Rive Gauche, everything so well appointed, from the menus to the open bottles of wine that were in various islands of the restaurant for servers to grab. I started the meal with a delicious tranche of country pate, and it was a marvelous display of cornichons, pearl onions and olives, and these triangled slices of pain de mie. The pate had a lot of flavor. But I much preferred taking pieces off my freshly baked individual French loaf of bread that came to my table. The bread was toothsome and wonderful, just like a mini-baguette should taste. One of the real showstoppers came next, as I ordered the warm bacon salad. Utterly genius how they melded all the distinct flavors so nicely, how they mixed the salad ---the vinaigrette into the crisp frisee leaves, and the warm lardons (bacon cubes), and of course, the perfectly poached egg that, when cut, just oozed more yolky richness into the already stellar salad. This is something that is truly authentically French and is not only a mainstay on all French bistro menus, but it's an excellent starter to any substantial meal. I decided to go with one of Mon Ami Gabi's specialties, which are the steaks. Since I couldn't decide which sauce I wanted to accompany my steak, béarnaise or bordelaise, my efficient  server  David suggested that they just bring out both sauces. Both were good, of course, but I was partial to the béarnaise because it was so decadently rich. The caramelized onions in the bordelaise were just a tad sweet for my taste buds at that moment. The steak? Like butter soft. Like a large portion, almost pounded out, but having loads of beefy flavor and I'm glad I ordered it medium. The dish sang so much that it really didn't seem like it was a huge steak slab like those you'll find at other behemoth Chicago steakhouses like Harry Caray's or Ditka's. If it's thick grub that you want, Fred Flintstone-style, then this probably isn't your place. But I guarantee that you'll have an extremely substantial and rich and flavorful steak. I actually didn't mind the fries, but I admit these aren't the shoestring-style, thin ""allumettes"" that you'll find in French restaurants. What they were were almost flattened thin potato crisps, not chips because they did taste like French fries. They were good, so do not misunderstand. I eschewed the ketchup that David offered to bring me, preferring to dip the fries in the béarnaise sauce. It is a testament to the flavor dexterity of the chef that I never once had to add any seasoning to my entire meal. That's how good it was. The dessert was just as marvelous. I ordered the chocolate profiteroles, served as a giant pair, smeared with rich chocolate sauce and with two globes of Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream. Normally I find that when the profiteroles are served this way, they become dense and hard to eat. These were soft and easily sumptuous, a perfect end to the meal. Finally, a glass of the Beaujolais Villages, a crisp red, complemented the meal and left me very happy to say that I had an outstanding French meal in a beautiful part of Chicago",0.9992,0.774,0.218,0.008,0.5564416177429877

I had six fresh oysters and wished I'd ordered 12.  The ""Petite Salad Maison"" was a little too petite for me so I wished I'd ordered the Caesar which is ""grande"".  I eat my salad with my meal or afterwards, a kind of ""digestif"" and fresh counterpoint to the meat and potatoes.  House steak medium rare is to be savoured.  Luckily there is a mound of good frites (thin and crisp fries) to pick over.  Very good.   A meal is an experience in life.

We started our meal with a pretty standard green salad and a delicious and creative cold red pepper soup. Entrees ordered was steak & frittes and scallops with mushrooms and asparagus. I just typed all that out and started drooling. It was all very delicious. The steak may have been tendarized and grilled to perfection. Not normally a fan of sauce, the sauce that accompanied the steak was fabulous. It was a cream sauce seasoned with tarragon. We ended dinner with ice cream over a berry crumble and cappucino.

I simply could not throw couple words together to describe the incredible time I had here - but here it is:  Apetizer: The Escargots - don't be grossed out by snails, definitely DON'T google their image before the meal. they're full of protein (I think??) - and even if they're not, Mon Ami Gabi makes them so good that you mostly taste the garlic sauce, not the snail itself. I could eat this appetizers for dinner, but sadly there were only a few. However, they have complimentary bread that tasted amazing when dipped in this sauce. French Onion soup came in huge portion - unfortunately I didn't get to taste it :( Main dish: of course the steak and fries are fabulous. My two friends both got it, and their plates looked amazingly good. I really like the fries served with it - thinner cut and very crispy.  I personally don't like a big piece of meat - so I ordered a beef bourguignon. It was delicious, perfectly done. The portion was on the bigger size but I finish everything without hesitation.  Desert - perhaps the best part. We got the chocolate mousse, creme brulee and mango sorbet. Need I say more? I tried to eat them as slowly as I could to taste everything and to savor the last moment of an amazing meal. The service was excellent - we did not have  any issues from the beginning to the end.

He takes great care of his loyal patrons and is a downright lovely person to talk to. The rest of the staff, also a delight. Second, or maybe this should have been first, the food is AMAZING. Mussels. merlot butter filet with pomme frites, often a perfectly good oyster of the day, the French onion soup, and so much more, all CONSISTENTLY fantastic.  Say what you will about a couple of single sisters eating too frequently in one place, but understand this: we tried everything and it was always a delight. And we are not super easy to please. Once or twice there were a few tiny bits of shell in the shucked oysters. Dear god - call the food police.

Everything was as good as can be, which is standard with all LEYE restaurants. Food:  We ordered the mussels which were insanely good. They came in a cast-iron pot and had the most flavorful broth in this world. I could eat probably 10 pounds of these beautiful mollusks.  The complimentary baguette was tasty, and if it is served warm, really hard to stop eating.  The one entree that everyone loved was the steak au poivre with frites.  The steak was loaded with flavor and the peppercorn sauce was out of this world good.  Don't mess around with any of the fish or the specials, just get a steak and thank me later.   As for dessert, the apple tart was extremely disappointing and really quite bland.  The profiteroles were great though.  Also on this night, they had a special dessert called the Tour de France, which was two wheel-shaped pastry doughs with sweet cream in between and surrounded by fresh berries.  Really tasty and not the type of dessert that leaves you feeling like you consumed a small baluga whale.

Starters: the French Onion soup which was great! Piping hot, gooey messy cheese and the perfect balance of soup/bread. I really enjoyed it. The apple, goat cheese and beets salad was also a winner. Fresh, crisp and light.  Entrees: with the limited options, we both opted for the Steak Frites. I had the bernaise sauce and my husband the bordelaise (carmelized onions and red wine). Both of these were just so-so. Steak wasnt well seasoned and really did need the sauce to make it better, which should never happen. It should accompany it, but not make the meal. On the plus side, portions were huge.  To finish: we shared the berry cobbler. um um good! Now, i am 6 months pregnant and have been wanting cobblers and crisps for awhile now, but this one was out of this world good.

Our second course was served while we were still enjoying our Brie, which included the endive and Bosc pear salad and jumbo chilled shrimp. Both dishes were great and went well with our Boudreaux.  Our final course was skate,which we were dying to try but was slightly disappointing and bland, and the crab cake, not the best ever but still okay.  We decided to cap off the evening with a glass of champagne, which sounded like a great night cap but turned into a very disappointing dessert.  We ordered two glasses of champagne as we asked for the check. Upon receiving the check we learned that our server Ryan had ordered us the most expensive glass of champagne on the menu without asking us our preference.  The glass of champagne he decided to order for us was $20 per glass (the other two options on the menu were $7 or $8) so obviously we were not pleased by this selection without asking.  At this price point we could have had another bottle of wine, two more entrees or  4 martinis.  We were very disappointed that our cocky server took advantage of us by up charging our bill with two glasses of champagne to increase the tip.

We had a reservation for 12 people for 8pm on a Saturday, and probably waited about 15 minutes.  We were seated in the back room, which was quaint but crowded.  The place was HOT......very, very HOT.  The kitchen must have been right behind my seat.....because it was uncomfortably HOT....even the women were complaining.   Food was OK.  My hanger steak was good, but the 'frites' part of the meal.....terrible.  Really, you can't even get french fries right in a french restaurant?  Overall, a very unremarkeble experience.   One order finally made it out by the time most of us were finished - a steak.  Waiter said he would comp that, but then decided to bring a bunch of deserts to the table, and not comp the steak.  (this after we brought our own cupcakes to be served for desert, as we were celebrating a 40th birthday).  Again, poor communication.   Got the bill, and had to ask if they could add the gratuity for us, since we had a large party and it would be easier when splitting up among 6 credit cards......they said 'sorry, we can't do that'.  What?  You can't add gratuity to table of 12 ?  That's SOP anywhere else. Over the years I've come to expect a great experience at most LEYE restaurants, they really get it right.  Mon ami Gabi on the other hand did not live up to that standard, and we won't be coming back any time soon.

I had walked by Mon Ami Gabi at least 100 times and always said to myself ""I need to try this place"".

He recommended a wine that we ended up ordering a bottle of at our table.  After 10ish minutes we were seated. Our server was good, but I can't say he was gushing with personality. Maybe I'm spoiled by Frankie (Joe's), but I guess the service was what I would expect in France. He was always looking after us to be sure we were OK, but never took the time to truly chat with us.  We ordered a lot of food and it was all wonderful. The starters were escargot and french onion soup, which they split for us at no additional cost. I'm not sure if I have had escargot before, but it was a couple bites of flavorful awesomeness. I went with the Steak Frites (Blue Cheese Edition) and the lady went with the Cod. HOLY FRITES!

Only minor hitch was at one point our main server was out of sight for a while, but another server took our order and the evening progressed just fine.

The snails came out in a baking dish in a garlic butter sauce that looked like a nuclear-green ooze...but it tasted like butter. Yummy green butter. The baked cheese was humongous. It's not just cheese, though. There's a bed of herb-infused tomato sauce and a loaf of garlic-ish bread.

Like awesome-sweet and sweet-tasting. The cheese is baked on top of the cup/bowl and the onions are very soft and, you guessed it, sweet. As far as entrees go, you really can't go wrong with any of the steak frites. The steaks are pounded quite thinly, and the frites are plentiful. With that said, the portions are large, especially if you're getting an hors d'oeuvres or two. As far as non-steak items, I've only had the opportunity to try the Lemon-Thyme Seared Salmon, which is exactly how you think it tastes: lemony, thyme-y, and yummy. I had the opportunity to try a few of the desserts, but to be perfectly honest, nothing stood out. But I don't have a sweet tooth. So you might want to try a little something off the dessert menu.

Excellent prompt friendly service. Had escargot, and onion soup to start with, both were perfect, and exactly what you would expect.  Not the best onion soup ever, but it was very good.  The sauce with the escargot was amazingly garlicky, and I would drink it with a straw, and was perfect for dipping the never ending baguettes. We had the Steak Frites, and Beef Bourguignon.  Wow.  The beef in the bourguignon was some of the tenderest cuts of meat I have ever consumed.  You literally did not need to chew it.  The sauce was perfect, and again, perfect for the baguette as well. The steak for the Steak Frite was just amazing.  It was everything a steak should be, the brandy peppercorn sauce with it was just right.  I really can't think of a better steak I have had.  Every bite was like the first one in my mind.  The frites were frites, tasty, but exactly what you would expect, which in this case was the perfect way to do it. The dessert trio was great.  A profiterole, grapefruit sorbet, and a chocolate mouse.  All 3 were perfect with a cup of coffee. We were the last ones out of the restaurant, but were treated great the whole time, even on the way out with no 'thank god they are finally leaving' feel.

I went during restaurant week and had predicted this would be a pretentious and stuffy restaurant, but it far exceeded my expectations in atmosphere and food. We had a reservation for 7:30 and were seated about 7:40, but it was very easy to wait in the lobby of the Belden-Stratford (not a bad place to have to wait) and someone came to find us when the table was ready.  We had a great server- super friendly, not overly attentive, and had some good jokes. I think his name was Don?   The cocktail menu has a lot of great French options.  I had the French 75, which contrary to another review, I thought was very strong, and I like strong drinks.  The wine cart is cool because you can just order by the glass out of that. We started off with some crispy baguettes with butter and lentil salad.  From the prix fixe menu for restaurant week, I ordered escargots (they make them here with pesto- and the sauce is great for dipping the bread) and Steak Frites with Bernaise sauce.  My friends ordered their steaks cooked differently and all of them were cooked perfectly according to what we asked for. Next time I would ask for a variety of sauces- one of us ordered the Brandy Peppercorn and it was also very good.  I think red meat is the way to go here. One of our group ordered salmon which was good, but clearly not their specialty.  Frites are great and they will bring you ketchup upon request. Onto the desserts: o.m.g. Chocolate mousse, mango sorbet, and creme brulee. The creme brulee had the perfect torched crust on top and it was probably one of the most delicious desserts I have ever had in my life. I would go back to order an entire bowl of this. The restaurant is very cozy with dark colors and the bar in the middle. When a big group left I noticed they play jazz music.  You can easily valet a car and it takes them all of about 2 minutes to retrieve it.  Such a great experience- definitely recommend for restaurant week or anytime.",0.999,0.726,0.264,0.011,0.5729166666666667

Located right across the street from the Lincoln Park Zoo (which we conveniently explored before dinner), Mon Ami Gabi has an extremely authentic French feel. I'd know, I spent a semester in Paris. The restaurant is at the bottom of a fancy hotel, the same hotel that hosts the very famous L2O restaurant.  The food was great. I got the beef bourgogne. The beef was so tender and the red wine sauce had a great flavor. I wasn't a huge fan of the ham in the dish though but overall it was very enjoyable. The scallops we got as an appetizer were incredible! Oh and I almost forgot! The chocolate mousse was some of the best I've ever had. It had the perfect mousse texture and chocolatey flavor and came with these delicious chocolate covered rice crispies on top.  For a very French dining experience in Chicago, check out Mon Ami Gabi.

Overall, I was really disappointed, and probably would've given this a place 2-stars because they really did not meet my expectations; however, with an objective eye, it really is probably a 3-star place.  Ambiance: nice, french- ish, tons of Seniors there... very awkward when you're 20 years younger than everyone else. Not sure about seating arrangements. I felt like i was in a Chinatown restaurant where you had to share tables. You couldn't just turn the table a little to get into the booth, you had to pull the table ALL THE WAY into the aisle to get to your seat. I also just felt incredibly uncomfortable sitting so close to others. Literally only a foot apart on both sides. My dining partner and I had very limited conversations.  Service: Very nice! Our server was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable on food and recos.  Food: so-so.  French 75- decent, but not strong at all.  Sangria- decent, again, not very strong.  French onion soup- cheese was delicious, but there was something wrong with the broth.. it wasn't salty enough? I'm not really sure how soup can be bland, but it was. I'm asian, and I'm fairly sensitive to saltiness, so i extremely dislike rich and salty foods, and even i found this soup to be bland.  Cesar salad- decent, again, something was off again though. not terrific, not terrible.  Lemon chicken with Frites- chicken was good, tender, but nothing ""wow."" I loved the frites because they remind me of the super crispy fries you get at the bottom of a Mcdonald's french fry container. however, i could've gotten these for $1 instead of Mon Ami Gabi.  Steak- some kind of butter, dont' remember the name. really too rich, and very buttery. The steak itself was cooked well.  Mac and cheese- okay. nothing special. weird cheese layer on top.  Trio Desserts- again, everything so so, nothing amazing, nothing terrible.  Price: expensive for so-so food, and decent portions- nothing gigantic nor tiny. Goldilocks style, but expensive.

2011-02-20,4.0,"I headed to Mon Ami Gabi DURING Restaurant Week, but not necessarily FOR Restaurant Week. Any how, the place was packed with prix fixers so I stalked the tiny bar and waited for a seat to open before posting up on a stool for the night. I started with a reasonably priced cotes du rhone and ordered the filet mignon MR with a merlot butter reduction. I requested it served with au gratin potatoes and French cut green beans instead of the ""signature fries"" that came with it. This was the Good Call of the century, however they are a little weird about substitutions because that was the side that was supposed to go with the special of the night (pepper-crusted ribeye), and there were only apparently a set amount allotted. I thought that was strange, but they accommodated me and my cheesy potato needs. Everything came out perfectly, I mean that in regards to both flavor and timing. The steak was a solid medium rare and the sauce on it was delicious, even though I could eat a filet with just a little S&P. The sides were also done without a flaw. You know, last week I ate at the Chicago Cut house and spent 3 times what I did at Mon Ami, yet I liked Mon Ami 3 times better. Go figure.  I finished the meal with a total foodgasm known as the bananas foster crepe. It's a crepe the size of a burrito stuffed with vanilla ice cream, drenched in warm caramel sauce with sliced bananas all over it. I shared it with the stranger sitting next to me so as not to look like a glutton (or waste this masterpiece).

The host in the restaurant was very attentive, and we sat down exactly at our reservation time. The server was very personable and nice.

She was told ""no,"" that they prepare precisely enough to go with the steaks. OK, I guess. The guy at the table next to us, where my sister spied the vegetables, leaned over and jokingly said he would sell me his for ""two bucks."" He couldn't believe the waiter either. The food was fair. The squash and onion soups were bland. The steaks and fish were also OK but not terrific. A lot of stuff comes with fries, which were basically like potato shrapnel. I don't care if you do put them in a stand wrapped in parchment paper - fries should be bigger than 1cm long. The desserts were very good all around. All in all, I would give the food 6/10 and would not necessarily return for it. The biggest disappointment was what happened after we ate.

The beef bourguignon didn't have that melt in your mouth taste you want with the braised beef. The beef was also butchered with too much ligament intact, tasty with Pho not so much with beef bourguignon.  The Ugly: Parking is a nightmare, just valet your car.

I had the chicken liver mousse for a starter. It came with this delicious red wine mustard that really cut through the richness of the mousse. Really a perfect pairing. I loved it. Other appetizers around the table: duck confit with lentils which was well enjoyed, and cream of parsnip soup, which wasn't even around long enough for anyone else to sample. For my main I had the beef bourguignon. I figured it's a specialty of the house, I've never had the classic preparation, I may as well. It was great. The beef fell apart in my mouth and the sauce was incredibly flavorful. As far as beef stew goes, it was a 10.  The course that really wowed me was dessert, and as I went to pastry school and am pretty snobby when it comes to dessert, that's pretty surprising. As a special they had buche de noel in a chocolate-coffee preparation. I don't know how the crap they got that sponge so freaking light and fluffy, but it was incredible. My brother had the apple tarte tatin, which also surprised me. The slices of apple weren't those little thin dried out things you encounter at so many places. They were big and thick and juicy and warm and deeeeelectable. Aces on dessert, guys. For reals. The atmosphere was what I expected. Bistro-y, festive. The place was hopping, but we were very comfortable nestled in our little corner. All in all, an incredibly enjoyable Christmas Eve.

He provided information on the daily specials, and gave us 15 minutes to decide. Normally, I would think that was too long, but we enjoyed our time together after a long day. The couple next to us spoke French to each other, and made away with an extra loaf of the baguette in her big purse. Very smart. The waiter brought a sample of the chestnut soup for us, which was quite nice of him. And it was delicious. Pam ordered that as an appetizer and also had Steak Frite Au Poivre. I ordered the Steak Frite Roquefort. Quite simply, it was the best Steak Frite we've ever had. We were very happy, not too full, and enjoyed our leisurely walk back to the apartment.

It was like being in a real French bistro except that we weren't in France and everyone was speaking english. The bread! A whole baguette delivered to your table, piping hot in a paper bag along with a nice hunk of sweet butter. The amuse bouche was rabbit (!) with diced potatoes. Je ne mange pas cute little bunnies!!!! Actually, it was mostly seasoned diced potato and I think the closest it came to having rabbit in it may have been when one hopped by the restaurant. Delightful specialty cocktails, a sweet waitress (Jen), and excellent service. The French onion soup was chock full of onions in a delicious broth and topped with a generous portion of cheese and crouton. The Escargot was nestled in a garlic herb butter that begged to be mopped up with that wonderful bread. Our entrees were Boeuf Bourguignon with house made noodles and pork tenderloin wrapped in applewood smoked bacon - both excellent and delicious. We were sufficiently buzzed at that point so we shared a glass of Beaujolais Nouveau - I'm not an oenophile but I always enjoy that yearly treat.

I went way classic with the Steak Frites, in its Au Poivre preparation.  The beef was really quite fine (something I might chauvinistically (FRENCH!) suggest we do better in the Midwest than they do in France), grass-fed, lean but still tasty.  The sauce was good, too.  We knocked back two bottles of wine and if I had one ding for the waiter it was that his suggestion for our first bottle was not great (even at a modest price) -- maybe he was getting some sort of spiff.  The one less great note came, sadly, at the end of the meal -- no, not the bill! -- the dessert, a special of the night bread pudding, was really mediocre.

I take back what I said about chains, even though I prefer to support a local, family owned restaurant with my money.  Mon Ami Gabi is a great choice if you're looking for a spot-on good meal (they got it down pat) in a great location being within the gorgeous Belden Stratford Hotel facing the Lincoln Park Zoo & Nature Conservatory.  They also have a fairly lengthy Gluten-Free menu since most of their items are meat.",0.9982,0.741,0.238,0.02,0.5026807760141093

We put in an order for red wine and the baked cheese.  Phenomenal.  I know it's not complicated to whip up some goat cheese but it definitely filled the goat cheese void I've had for quite a while. My date ordered the filet and I, after much consideration, opted for the Steak Au Poivre (I had a peppery craving).  To avoid looking like a jackass and ordering a steak medium-well, I figured I'd let loose and try medium.  The timing was great and half-way through our neighbor's chat about the best locations to purchase homes in Chicago with easy access to the freeway our steaks and mound o' frites came out.  Tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned, delicious, loved it.  The frites were OK - a little thin and crunchy.  Tasty, but would have rather had something a little more potato-y.  Either way, I scarfed down the entire plate.  Thankfully I was able to walk some of it off on the way home! After they cleared our plates the waiter came back out with a chocolate birthday cake and a candle to wish a happy birthday.  It was pretty low-key, thankfully, because we were definitely too full to get a gaggle of staff members drawing attention to us with a loud birthday cheer.  The dessert was irresistable and thankfully we were able to find a little room to gobble it up.

They start you with a warm baguette in a paper bag, whipped butter, and a tiny scoop of some orzo salad (nice touch!).  Their selection of wines by the glass is diverse; the waiter identified a a red and a white that were delicious and complex.  We started with their 3 artisan cheese plate - all tasty in their own way.  The gazpacho was very ok - a little waterier and less multi-vegetabley than I like it (but I think I'm a gazpacho snob...I'm usually disappointed but had a good one recently elsewhere that I hoped could be replicated).  Our two main courses were the roast chicken and the ahi tuna salad.  I was glad my dish was the roast chicken - very juicy and kinda buttery.  It's served with a fine medley of bacon, mushrooms, cooked garlic, and cocktail onions (mmmmmm...cooked cocktail onions).  I recommend this dish.  The ahi tuna looked better than it tasted - it gave the appearance of being raw in the center, but it was pretty well done on the outside and that overpowered the rawness.  The gf said it had too much fennel, but I'm not sure that I would be able to identify fennel in a blind taste test of 3 spices I've never personally cooked with.

The service is attentive, knowledgeable, and extremely polite and well mannered. Last night I stopped by for dinner with a group of four friends.  It was a Friday night and was quite busy but they added us to the waitlist for the outside and told us it would be 30-40 min.  We got a couple martinis at the bar and waited -- The Parisian Martini, a twist on the classic French Martini with Cointreau instead of Chambord, is wonderful.  The bartender pours this concoction into a Martini Glass with a bit of Champagne and an Orange slice and the result is heavenly. So 45 minutes later and two Martinis (I also got a Belvidere Dirty with Blue Cheese Olives) we were on the patio and ready to eat.  The wait was actually good because the temperature outside cooled off quite a bit and it was more comfortable on the patio than it would have been if we were immediately seated. They brought warm french bread and butter which was great to accompany our starting dishes of French Onion soup and Butter Lettuce and Asparagus. All four of us ordered fish: scallops with whipped cauliflower, skate wing (one with chips and one with frittes), and a salmon salad.  The fish was all very delicious and well prepared.  We had a bottle of Sancerre which complemented the flavors perfectly.

2010-05-14,5.0,"I cannot stress enough what an amazing service experience I and my family had at Mon Ami Gabi last night.  I am getting married on Saturday, and this was my family's special meal before the event.  My parents are staying at the Belden Stratford and my dad went down to the restaurant before our reservation to see the tables and general layout of the place.  He requested that we have a table further away from the front, which basically meant 1 table out of the entire restaurant.  I've worked as a hostess, so I know how much these special requests, esp. for large parties (ours was 6), can mess up your plan for seating the evening.  The hostesses were fantastic in dealing with my dad's request, coming over and giving us updates on the status of the table, as we had to wait about an hour for it to clear.  We had drinks in the hotel's lobby while we waited, so we were very comfortable. That would have been enough to give this a high star rating, but then when we were seated, my dad was asked about any allergies in the party, so we assumed we'd be comped something (totally unnecessary in my opinion, since WE had made the special request that delayed our reservation).  They proceeded to bring out basically one of every appetizer (save the pate and mousse, which we ordered).  Everything was delicious, esp. the scallops and escargot.  Most of us had steaks, which were all cooked perfectly.  Two others had fish, the halibut special and the trout, and both were very good as well.  After our table was cleared and the dessert plates set down, we were waiting and waiting, wondering where our waiter had gone.  Out he comes with one of every dessert, also comped.  We could not believe it.  Favorites were the bread pudding, peach parfait, and pound cake.  Our waiter, Don, was a consummate professional and very attentive. While the food was great, really, for special occasions, you just want to make sure that you are treated well.  And I could not have asked for a better experience than the one we had at Mon Ami Gabi, the definition of going above-and-beyond.",0.9954,0.815,0.168,0.017,0.574187675070028

2010-03-24,2.0,"Let me start by saying, I really do not do the yelp review thing.  However sometimes you just need to be heard and vent.  With that being said, I do not understand Lettuce Entertain You restaurants.  The dichotomy within them is hysterical.  Either have amazing food and bad service or wonderful service with less than par food.  Is there a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant out there that meshes the two with synchronicity and ease?  If so let me know, so I can visit.  Let me also say, I am aware that all places and people have their off nights and days, after all we are all human.  My husband and I ate here a week or so ago at one of the beautiful tables along the window, overlooking the park & their patio when in season.  We have eaten here a couple of times.  The moment you walk in you can feel the warmth of the restaurant.  I can't say enough about how delish everything was.  Fantastic classic French fare (For Lettuce Entertain You).     When we sat down our server greeted us promptly.  At first he seemed great, happy to be there, happy that we were there the whole nine yards.  He told us specials, and thus our meal began.  It was after we ordered that he began this real arrogant and aloof attitude.  We could feel the dirty looks coming our way.  Maybe he didn't like what we ordered.  Granted we had a few hors d'oeuvres  and each had a salad and than shared an entree to us that was enough food.  Why would he care, we were drinking and spending money?  Why were we led to feel uncomfortable? Not right at all.  He was very standoffish through our first round of food.  Coming to us only when he absolutely had to.  Our water and wine were empty but that didn't prompt our waiter over no, he was busy being over the top ecstatic to his other customers around us.  Hugging them, kissing them, and laughing with them, all while we were ignored.  PLEASE, don't take this critique the wrong way, at no point were we jealous that we were not being treated this way, and infact, before we ordered our server was extremely nice to us it was the fact that he MADE SURE we noticed him and his actions with his other tables and customers all the while looking at our table and ignoring us.  Needless to say, it was very uncomfortable.  When he did come over to check on us his mood completely switched from this happy person that we saw with everyone else to being extremely short, as if we were putting him off by being there.  It was strange and quite inappropriate.  We felt unwelcome and underserved.  I don't want to barrage this issue to death. You could tell he was trying to get rid of us so when we finished our entrees we asked for the check.  We did not want to be there any longer either.  It was truly not a good experience.  As stated above the food was great and if we hadn't been seated in this particular waiters section maybe our experience would have been better.  However in closing do not sit in this person's section of the restaurant unless you know him or order a lot of food because he will make you feel extremely uncomfortable if you don't.  He hides it very well in the beginning. Thank you for the great food. That should never go unnoticed.  (Waiter-He was middle aged on the husky side with brownish hair and loud.  Sorry we did not get a name we didn't want to)",0.9895,0.778,0.132,0.09,0.570412141464773

For dinner I had the lovely Lemon Chicken Paillard which is considered a house favorite (and I know why!) the sauce is a buttery, lemony, garlicy dreamy creation and I finished every bite.

Chocolate graham cracker crust, coffee sauce (which is YUM), and whipped cream. I consumed the entire thing.  Let's just say, when I walked out of Mon Ami Gabi, my pants were not fitting properly.

There were 12 or 13 of us, yet somehow service was smooth and flawless.  They were great with the wine service, our glasses were never empty!  I began with the escargot, which came out piping hot and bubbling in garlic-butter sauce.  The french onion soup was also fantastic, hot and gooey.  Something about the bowl it was served in made the soup stay hot for 20 minutes!  The butter lettuce/goat cheese/beet salad was all right, but not a standout.  The beets had good flavor, but there were very few of them.  Skimped a bit on the cheese as well, but it was nice and light. For my entree, my boyfriend and I split the ribeye with frites and bearnaise sauce.  The steak was a great size for splitting, and it was a pretty good piece of meat!  Not as good as a true ""steakhouse"" but it was cooked very well, a lovely medium-rare but with a nice crust on the outside.  Honestly, it didn't require the bearnaise sauce.  I've never had steak frites before but I got a kick out of the little crispy things - they weren't like any American style fries I've ever had.  Addictively crunchy, but not terribly flavorful.  Which is maybe how they are supposed to be! Creme brulee was classic, tasted just as it should.  Which is delicious.

Once we saw the cramped banquet seating, the brightly lit room, and the overwhelming number of elderly patrons in the dining room, our spirits plummeted slightly.  That being said, it seemed like nothing a good meal could not take care of, correct?  A few moments later our waiter arrived with a smile-less face and begrudgingly asked what we wanted.  We inquired as to what was good on the menu, and he said he did not know.  WHAT?  Do you even EAT here? Immediately recognizing the uselessness that was our server, we just opted for some French staples.  A dozen oysters to start, followed by an endive, blue cheese, a pear salad.  Before our apps arrived, we were brought a delicious hot baguette in a bag (meant to be torn up by hand and dished out by hand, the old fashion way) and a lentil salad instead of the typical butter.  I was stoked...until the food arrived.   Everything was OK at best.  For the main course, I decided on the seared scallops with whipped cauliflower and sauteed spinach, and my dining companion got the roasted chicken with mushrooms and frites.  Both were 60% fabulous (no love was used in the preparation, thus the 40% strike.  Plus our enthusiasm was already tainted by the bad customer service, the smell of Bengay cream in the room, and the mediocre starters. All in all, the price for the food was not too bad.  French chow will usually put you back a good $150 (if you eat and drink like I do), but we managed to leave only forking over $100 (half on booze).  I know this place has been known as a bit of an establishment in the city of Chicago, and so I still thoroughly believe it is worth a try.  That being said, it still only gets 3 stars in my book.",0.9973,0.752,0.18,0.068,0.5637731481481483

Since I live 1 block away, I was inclined due to the sheer convenience of the location. So, I said yes and that's what prompted this positive review. I ordered fish this time---excellent choice for someone like me who prefers lamb over steak, we sat in the back and had a lot more room, and the company was excellent. We shared their fish special and another fish which was on the menu. The bread they served was nice and warm and once we ate through 1/2 of it, they brought us more... The Beaujolais wine was excellent. My only reason for giving this place a 3 versus a 4 is the space issue. Since its small, you feel a little cramped.

If you're looking for an affordable and lively French restaurant, look no further. Recommended: Jumbo Crab Cake (Amazing), Steak & Frites (Yum), Crème Brûlée, and Café Gabi. Avoid: Mon Ami Gabi Caesar Salad (too plain, lacked any flavor). I've had friends raving to me about Mon Ami Gabi for some time now. So when it was a time to take my boyfriend out for a fun and romantic evening I decided to give it a try.  Mon Ami Gabi is set in the historic Belden-Stratford Hotel Apartments on Lincoln Park. In the summer time there is outdoor seating with beautiful views of the park itself. The atmosphere is intimate, robust, and lively. Its décor is reminiscent of an older French Bistro and it's filled with a mix of small groups and intimate couples. Tables are nestled close to one another and the ambient lighting is low, with an upbeat vibe. Our visit started off rocky. Despite the fact that we had reservations and arrived early we had to wait 30 minutes after our reservation to be seated. I'm glad we hadn't planned anything after dinner or we would have been late or had to rush our meal. The server was prompt and accommodating, especially given the fact it was our first time to Mon Ami Gabi. We had an extended look over the menu and with so many delicious choices we decided a collaborative effort was necessary to try a variety of dishes. We chose several hors d'oeuvres, entrees paired with wine, followed by dessert and after dinner drinks. When the escargot was served I didn't realize it was still in its cast iron baking dish. The server neglected to warn us that it was extremely hot and I ended up scalding my mouth. Not a good way to start off any meal. The rest of the dishes came in a timely manner and were very good. Followed by a wonderful crème brûlée, and an after dinner drink. I was pretty content. Despite some set backs, Mon Ami Gabi managed to serve up a wonderful dining experience.

This place goes against all that true foodies stand for, those of us that search for the shining hidden gem. A bistro in France is a little joint on the corner feeding people who can't make it home to eat, usually a simple menu of half chicken or steak with fries or mussels. The fare is usually cheap, filling and the quality is phenomenal. The chefs know what they do and they do it well, hence the small menu. Here, the chefs have to try to make a monumental menu of items and the food turns out mediocre at best.

Woods and Wildfire because we'd both been there about 100 times and we wanted to try something different. After reading the yelps about the oakbrook location, we decided to go to the Lincoln Park location instead, mostly due to the fact that we felt that going to a restaurant in a mall parking lot isn't the swankiest way to dine. After fighting rush-hour traffic on the Kennedy on Thursday night, we made our reservation about a half-hour early. It was busy, but we were able to be seated immediately, which was pretty nice, especially considering how small this place is. We shared a bowl of french onion soup and some sort of scallop appetizer to start. The onion soup was delicious, but I thought the scallops suffered because it was extremely cheesy. I love scallops, and would have preferred a simpler dish. Still tasty, however. My girlfriend order beef bourginon, which I had a bite of. The beef cheeks were extremely tender and flavorful, and she enjoyed it as well. I got steak frities au pouvir, which was a thin cut of steak topped with whole black peppercorns and (I believe) some sort of brandy sauce. The steak was cooked perfectly, it was jucy and delicious. The frities were a little disappointing (as other yelpers have noted), but they were nice to snack on, and the ones that made their way into the sauce were very tasty once they got soggy.  For dessert, we had the bananas foster crepe, which was very good, although we both agreed we would have liked it infinitely better without the crepe, as it was a little rubbery.  All in all though, this place was great. I never found myself wondering where our server was, and every time he came by he poured some more beer in my glass (I order a 22oz bottle of Goose Island's Sofie, which was delicious btw). The restaurant looks great, and I'd love to come back in the summer when they have the patio open.  It was pretty reasonable, also.

J'ai beaucoup des expectations pour l'ambience, la cuisine et j'ai voir un garcon qui parle le Francais. Mais, je ne les ai rien recevoir! My French is rusty, but the gist is, I expected more from Mon Ami Gabi. It was my first time trying French food in Chicago, and was spoiled by having French food - in France. To me, I see French food as being about rich flavors and sauce, none of which I experienced here. I was also looking forward to dining in a French restaurant where I could perhaps speak to a waiter in French. Nope, the waitstaff and ambiance of the restaurant were very much Chicago steakhouse with its dark woods, dim lighting and definitely English speaking waitstaff (aside from the most awkward moment where one of the waitstaff misinterpreted our request for another plate...instead bringing us two full loaves of bread and extra butter. For five of us we had four full loaves of bread!) I tried escargot for the first time, and it was delicious, though not something I would get on a regular basis. I think people are so enamored with the escargot here because it's doused in butter. For my entree I tried the non-steak option most Yelpers fawned about: Roast Chicken & Frites (grandmere style, mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions). It didn't blow me away. The chicken skin had a nice crispness, and the frites were something different as they coated my entree. I've reached a point where fried potatoes are simply, fried potatoes. I was even more disappointed that they didn't offer ratatouille. I've wanted to try ratatouille for quite some time now. In fact, their menu looked more like a Chicago steakhouse (look at their side vegetable menu. Garlic spinach? Pommes puree a.k.a mashed potatoes? I don't think so).

2010-01-03,4.0,"So in terms of the food, I would actually only give this place three stars.  The service is what gained Mon Ami an extra star.  I see that some other people complained about the service, but we had a stellar waiter, I believe his name was Cal.  He made an excellent wine recommendation, when the hubs ordered a pricey glass of champagne he gave it to us for the price of a less expensive glass, and brought out extra house made hot fudge sauce with dessert with out us even asking.  And yes, the house made hot fudge was so good I had a couple of spoonfuls of it all by itself.   The simple reason that Mon Ami looses a star is because of my entree.  I went for the beef wellington, which while the steak inside the pastry was delicious, the pastry itself was atrocious.  I'm sorry but they shouldn't have served it, I ended up peeling the pastry off of the steak.  At least the entire entree wasn't ruined due to the gummy, undercooked pastry, because the steak was cooked perfectly and was tasty, but I didn't just order steak, I ordered beef wellington.  Anyway, everything else was tasty, probably some of the best french onion soup around.   And I must mention (and this is personal preference) but I did not like the frites, they were more like strips of potato chips instead of a french fry.  They didn't really have a potato taste or texture left, they were more like a chip.  But maybe this is how they're actually served in France?  Which is fine, I just didn't care for them.",0.9819,0.809,0.135,0.057,0.47496031746031747

A friend of mine lives in the Belden-Stratford and planned for several of us to meet here for dinner.  We had an amazing evening.  It started with cocktails at 6 pm.  Because I needed something stiff (please get your mind out of the gutter), I ordered a Ketel One vodka gimlet.  The bartender must be a part-time mind reader because this drink was so stiff it literally put hair on my back.  The bar area is a tad bit small so we took our drinks to the lobby for a nice conversation.  After about 30 minutes of conversation we were ready to make our way to our table.   The restaurant is quaint and cozy.  It really does remind you of a Parisian cafe.  It is dimly lit which sets a romantic tone.  I made a mental note of this in the event that I ever do go on a date. The food was delicious from start to end.  For appetizers a couple of people at the table had salads which looked amazing.  A couple of people had the porcini soup which they raved about.  A couple of people opted for more drinks as their appetizer and I ordered the escargot which I haven't had since the last time I actually was in Paris.  The escargot was good.  It didn't knock me off my chair or make my eyes roll back in my head but it was good.  For our entrees, the majority of the people at the table ordered the special:  lamb chops.  The lamb was UNBELIEVABLE!  It was tender and flavored with the perfect amount of rosemary.  I literally wanted to pick up the bones to get every piece of meat but I heard my mother in my head saying ""I raised you better than that...please don't, Scott...you are in public"".  The lamb chops came with a side of potatoes that were prepared in a sauce that made me clean my plate.  For dessert (that's right, we weren't done yet), I ordered the creme brulee which was decent.  Truthfully, I've had better but it was good.  A friend at the table ordered the bananas foster but was disappointed when the bananas weren't warm or even caramelized.  She did send it back and asked for the white chocolate bread pudding which she said was excellent. I guess it was because she ate every bite.   All in all, Mon Ami Gabi was a wonderful dining experience and I left wondering why I had not been to this restaurant before.  No worries though because I definitely will be returning.",0.9982,0.771,0.201,0.029,0.5141912320483749

Our server, who I don't think even told us his name, seemed nice at first but it seriously became awkward by the time we left. The food itself was fine and somewhat filling (we had the Steak Au Poivre and Steak Roquefort)... but the experience was really off-putting. Our server couldn't pronounce ""worchestershire"" (lol), and he looked at me oddly when I asked if they had some sauces on the side (like bbq, A-1, ketchup or whatever)... and this wasn't for my steak, it was for my frites (because I need dipping sauce for any fries). He offered ketchup.  When it came time for the check, I used a LEYE gift card... he came back, held on to the LEYE gift card (by putting it in his pocket) that still had a balance on it and explained that if i wanted to give a cash tip I could, or if I wanted to put on the gift card I could... I was planning on just putting the tip of the gift card anyway but the fact that he kept it in his pocket caught me off-guard.

I'd say my favorite preparation is the Steak Classique, with the Steak Bearnaise being a close second (clearly, I'm one for putting some butter on my steak).  The steaks are usually served with thinly sliced frites which they pile on the plate - I tip my hat to you if you're able to finish them all! If you find the frites to be overwhelming, you can ask for aside of mashed as a substitute.

The tables are pretty cramped together, regularly moved out to squeeze customers in. Use the bathroom before getting pressed in. The wine selection is strong with a sommelier on hand (or so my hosts told me), but the beer selection is a bit of a weak hodge-podge of whatever they could find at their European beer importer, which I feel higher end restaurants really fall short on. Steak frites are the main strength of the menu, however the frites are more like shoestring fries. They are quite tasty, just not my thing. The steak is fantastic, not quite steakhouse quality but reasonably priced at about 20 bucks. All and all, I wasn't blown away and their were too many things off about the place, the cramped space, weak beer menu, lack of non-steak options for the more finnicky eaters, but it was pretty good and free for me!

Having a ton of LEYE gift cards laying about we decided on Mon Ami Gabi as it was one of the few LEYE restaurants we had yet to try in the City.  We started with escargot. SUPERB!! I wish I had a straw for the garlic herb sauce in which these delicious former snails were swimming!! The complimentary baguette made for a suitable vehicle for said juices. My only complaint was having to share with my wife and the melancholy that swept over me when we slurped up the last remaining drop.  Next, French onion soup. Arguably my wife's and my personal favorite soup. It was hot, well balanced, and a sizable portion. A bit sweeter than most I've had in the past but that didn't stop me from inhaling it like my last breath of fresh air. Unlike what I would have done at a Chinese restaurant, I resisted lifting the bowl to my lips and drinking what little evaded my spoon.  Steak Roquefort. Sublime. Tender. Creamy. The only thing that would have made it better... less pomme frites. Yes; less. Although the fried potatoes were delicious they swarmed the plate and interfered with each attempt to cut into the main attraction, Steak Roquefort. The steak was outstanding but next time I'll go with the mashed potatoes or another vegetable all together.  Dessert is typically a must when creme brulee is on the menu; however, this particular night we planned poorly and reached belly capacity before the last course could be enjoyed. We will definitely save room for the brulee next time. I did see several delivered to other tables and the burnt top looked smooth, caramel-y, and crispy unlike many other places that have spots of black and cream with uneven browning.  It's not a question of will we go back but rather a question of when. Mon Ami Gabi is mon ami!",0.9976,0.746,0.218,0.036,0.42783687943262405

It's cute, interactive, memorable and still relatively unique. We chose right by avoiding salads because the steak frites bernaise my boyfriend got came on the most enormous of dishes! The pile of steak frites was too much for the both of us! Oh goodness, and the bernaise sauce that came with the steak was so yummy (I am a vegetarian but still eat egg product). Delectable with the pile of steak frites! I went with the vegetarian sampling and while everything on my plate was very tasty I felt they could have done more. It was basically a side of mashed cauliflower, asparagus, green beans and lentils. Good, but not what I expected. There are a number of vegetarian side dishes to choose from and if I had known four would be on the plate I would have asked if I could chose.

This is expected I suppose, in a french bistro, but I made out like a bandit in Paris for weeks and have had more options at different spots around Chicago, so I maybe if they felt they had clientele they could do a little more with the menu? Nothing is better than a French restaurant with vegetarian options! I swear it would sell!  Overall, I think I could have ordered better but my boyfriend ate enough food for days! Everything was delicious and I would go back to enjoy lunch outside on the patio, have drinks and appetizers or maybe try and correct my ordering mishaps. Either way, if you like steak frites, give Mon Ami Gabi a try! The meat (according to the bf) is tender and delicious, and the sauces from the dozen styles in which you can order steak frites all sound delicious so I don't think anyone could go wrong!!",0.9988,0.771,0.192,0.037,0.5579579274891774

However, if you have no qualms about ingesting what I imagine is a truly staggering amount of calories, than Mon Ami Gabi is the place to do it.

When my mother and I first entered the intimately sized dining area, we realized that reservations for a Saturday night would have been a good idea.  With less than a two minuet wait, however, we were seated at the bar where we received better service than many of those dining at tables.  The bar tender was quick to take our drink orders and even offer us regular menus, he was attentive, remembered all of the dinner specials without missing a beat, and never once treated us like we were in the way for ordering food at the bar.  The wine selection was good, as was the assortment of appetizers, which is what we were there for.  I had the english pea soup with tomato and leeks and the escargots, and my mother had the butternut squash soup and the salmon salad.  The soups were heavenly.  The pea soup tasted like summer and eating homegrown peas off the vine in my grandmothers backyard.  The escargots was amazing too (although this was my first try).  My moms salad came out with seared tuna instead of salmon, it was very tasty but a bit over salted.  Her meal was on the house due to the mix-up, we didn't even have to ask to complain!  The meal was served with a fresh, warm baguette and garbanzo bean and lemon spread that was delicious.  We also had to try the black currant sorbet, which was sweet, tart, and very refreshing. Overall the experience we had at Mon Ami Gabi was great.  I would definately go again if I make it to Chicago in the future.  We made sure to stop on the way out to commend the manager and thank him for a lovely evening.",0.9967,0.785,0.186,0.028,0.5512367262367263

Essentially put, I found my local French Bistro if only the service would improve.   It was a first time visit for everyone.  We all enjoyed out evening with the exception of our server which is why I'm willing try again with another server.  Essentially, there was no service from this server.  You know it is bad when you have to ask for another glass of wine, the bill, for our food to be taken away, etc. The food was enjoyable.  We all three ordered a steak.  I almost actually finished my entire steak which is very unusual, the frits were mouth watering and reminded of lays chips, just couldn't stop eating them.  We passed on anything more out of frustration with the server.",0.8087,0.828,0.113,0.059,0.49635416666666665
2008-12-22,5.0,"Every month, I ask myself the eternal question - should I tear up my Lettuce Entertain You membership card or not? I have had my card for years - back when the cards were FREE and the company was much more giving and kinder to their members. Over the years, they have picked away at the member perks so much that now I could really give a shit if I use my card or not to get my Frequent Diner points.  Having said that, there are a couple of LEY restaurants that will always be near and dear to my heart and one of them is Mon Ami Gabi. God, I love this restaurant. Love the location; love the service; love the ambiance. Love the little tiny 6 seater bar where you can have a drink while you wait. And last, but certainly not least, I love the food.  On a recent evening, the four of us had a food orgy: - Sea Scallops Gratinées with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, mussel cream (we all ooed and ahhed so much other these & all agreed that if you added a few more scallops, this dish could be an entree) - Butternut Squash soup w/crème fraîche, chive = to DIE for! - Macaroni Gratin - with a white cheese, perhaps Gruyere - fantastic! - Whipped cauliflower - xxoo!! - Steak Bordelaise w/ caramelized onion, red wine sauce served with stupendous pommes frites - Gabi's Fish & Frites w/French tartare sauce; very interesting dish, the 2 pieces of fish resembled hash brown squares in size and were flat and thin with a very thin fried batter - we also had a couple of specials, one being a fish and another being the daily beef special, and both were a thumbs up Desserts - Bananas Foster Crêpe (vanilla ice cream, bananas, foster sauce) - HUGE portion that should be split with 2-4 people. The chocolate mousse (light semi-sweet chocolate) was a let-down for me but that was my fault. I ordered it knowing full well that my preference is a deep dark chocolate mousee. To me, this mousse was so light that I and my comrades could hardly taste the chocolate at all. All in all, I will continue to frequent Mon Ami Gabi - whether I use my Frequent Diner club card or not.  But a note to LEY:  I used to always recommend your restauarants to my long distance manager who would seek my recommendations when she would come into Chgo and take us on big $$$ dinners.  But NO MORE! As she uses her co. Visa, you won't let me use MY member card to get the points. Dudes, if it were not for my recommendation, you wouldn't be getting the G.D. business, right?

The red wine sauce was useful for soaking up the frites that were piled up beside my steak. The meat was respectable for the price. And as always in Chicago, patio seating is where it's at. It just feels more European when you're outside. Our waiter on the patio bashfully admitted that he wasn't quite up on his French as we asked questions about the menu, but at least he was forthcoming with it.

2008-08-15,4.0,"Bonjour, mon petit bureau de change! Just wanted to share my thoughts on a lovely dinner that I recently shared with my family at Mon Ami Gabi. As I tend to do when faced with the prospect of food I don't have to pay for, I went a bit overboard. Started with the onion soup which came in a gigantic crock...I think it weighed about 2 pounds. Really tasty, and was more on the sweet side than on the beefy side. I've had, you know, ""real"" onion soup and I must say that the Gabi version definitely held its own. Side note, if anyone is really into onion soup and likes reading blogs, go to  theonionsoup.com , it's quite...informative. On the complete opposite end of the first course spectrum, my mother had a light and healthy butter lettuce salad with shaved veggies and a citrus dressing. I stole a bite and sort of wished I had gone the salad route instead. At this time in my review-writing, I am also realizing that I left out the part where I ate half a baguette before my soup even hit the table. Time for entrees and I was already completely stuffed. But, it was my mom's birthday and I needed to stay strong. Therefore I devoured a filet mignon like nobody's business. Giant portion, perfectly cooked, though I wasn't crazy about the merlot butter it came with. (Should I really be adding butter to a steak?) The other wine sauce was good though. The pommes frites were thin, crispy and in abundance. Between THREE PEOPLE eating off my plate we were still unable to finish them off. Other family members enjoyed the scallops, roast chicken, pork tenderloin and vegetarian sampler. And don't forget about dessert... a complimentary birthday profiterole for my mother (good), creme brulee (better) and flourless chocolate cake (best). My regrets of the evening were: - not sharing the bowl of onion soup w/ my sister - only eating a single piece of lettuce - only eating 3 green beans I definitely had to sleep that meal off. I'll plan things out a bit healthier next time. Great service though and lovely location inside the Belden-Stratford Hotel. And I think it's better than Marche(?!)

My fiance, his mom, his brother and myself went. The bread at the beginning of the meal (fresh baked french bread) is amazing. I could have just eaten bread the whole time. MMMM.  My fiance got a martini with blue cheese olives and I got a martini with Grey Goose, Champagne and pomegranate juice. Not bad at all! Quite good, actually. I had a nice buzz going all through dinner.  Several members of our party got some Escargot. It was cooked in garlic butter and pesto - they were swooning all through the meal about those sassy snails. I got some white gazpacho, which had cucumber, almonds and granny smith apples. It was garnished with grapes, it was DELICIOUS. It was the most interesting part of the meal for me.  My main course was Sanddab fish with a carrot hollandaise, served on a bed of asparagus. Very good. Sanddab is a very light, flakey fish which I enjoyed very much. Everyone else got an array of meats, which they enjoyed immensely.  For dessert my fiance and I split a lemon tart, while his brother had some chocolate mousse and his mom had a carmel apple tart. Sweet tooth fix found by all! The only downer of the meal was the fact that our waiter acted as though he hated life and that he was doing a favor by telling us what the specials of the day were. Dude, it's your JOB. He would snatch plates out from under us without saying ""Excuse me"" or ""Pardon my reach."" I don't expect ""Pardon Me's"" at McDonald's, but I do at Mon Ami Gabi.

We were finally seated outdoors with a beautiful view of the big lawn area in front of Lincoln Park zoo.  Despite being on a fairly busy street, the plexiglas panels installed in the fence kept us well insulated from the noise. I think the appetizers were the highlights of the evening.  The duck confit ""salad"" (there wasn't much salad there, just duck, which was just fine) and the escargot were phenomenal.  I'd recommend against the oysters though...I've never had oysters in Chicago before, and not unexpectedly they weren't a match for oysters I usually get in SF. We got 3 steaks and a fish dish.  I don't remember which fish it was, some relative of salmon, but it was cooked just right -- barely cooked all the way through.  My ""rare"" filet was also done just right -- still mooing on the inside, and my little sister's blue cheese steak (which I got more than half of) was also delicious, if a bit thin. The Cab Franc we got with the food was a great match as well, even though I picked that out myself...so I can't comment on their sommelier's food-matching skills.  My only real gripe about the food was that the steaks were accompanied by a huge mound of (delicious!) pommes frites...it would have been nice to get some vegetables or have a choice of mashed potatoes or something different. Dessert was also quite good -- chocolate mousse, an apple tart, and creme brulee accompanied by some sort of chocolate cake with a candle in it.  In the end, my dad was happily sauced and very pleased with his birthday dinner.  Good job, Gabi!",0.9933,0.865,0.135,0.0,0.6026695526695528

2008-06-01,4.0,"Mon Ami Gabi is a fantastic place.  Yes it's part of a five restaurant chain (the one in Vegas is a great spot).  But in terms of a fun, reasonably authentic, and actually affordable French bistro experience this is a gem. First, Mon Ami Gabi is situated inside the gorgeous Belden Stratford Hotel, right off Lincoln Park.  One caveat, it's a pretty good hike from the nearest CTA station but taxis are plentiful and they have a valet for your designated drivers.  There's a wonderful outdoor seating area and a small but inviting bar to have a drink or four while waiting for an outside table to open up.  For me it's five stars for ambiance. The wine list is short but packs a punch with solid offerings from all over France and a smattering of domestic labels.  Good range of prices as well, we had a '05 1er Cru Burgundy for just $71.  Several attractive wines at the $40-$50 price point as well. For some reason I'm addicted to their bread which is served hot upon seating. The menu is pretty straightforward, I think their variety of appetizers is the highlight.  The escargot is not to be missed.  My favorite part is dipping the aforementioned bread into the pesto once all the snails are gone! The steamed mussels are an amazing choice and you can't really go wrong with the steaks.  The cuts of beef aren't really that spectacular, but the sauces are out of this world. Hard to decide which one to have. And I don't know how they do their haricots verts and potatoes gratin but both were absolutely 5 star. Service was only average (although the bartender was awesome). Usually one thing you can count on at a good French place is extremely knowledgeable (while often stuffy/pretentious) wait staff.  Maybe we got the newbie, but she was pretty middling in terms of helpfulness, attentiveness and knowledge.   All in all a dependable, beautiful, fun and reasonable place to have a great meal.  Highly recommended.",0.9979,0.752,0.236,0.011,0.5788198757763975

The interior of the restaurant is positively French.   The waiter will start you off with a fresh, warm baguette to nibble on. As a carb professional I would have to give the bread and butter a 5 as well! Mon Ami Gabi is known for having a great selection of wines so ask what they recommend. If you are one to impress this is the place to be a wine snob. They bring around a wine cart to choose from. The food is a little pricy. Whoever invented a la carte is a la stupid! I think it was the French. Regardless, throw your budgets away and go for the steak & frites. All of the steaks are amazing. The soups are thick and creamy. I highly recommend the mashed cauliflower as a side. If mashed cauliflower is healthy this one definitely fooled me.

2007-03-01,4.0,"I was expecting a snooty expensive place. What I got was a charming moderately priced experience. My wife and I had dinner at 7 on a Wednesday. The place was busy but not packed. I could see how it would take a while to get a table on a Fri or Sat night as the place is not very big.  Their wine list has a handful of good French choices, and they have about 10 wines you can get by the glass. They have a daily meat special as well as a fish special which we both had. I had the Wed night veal special, which was pretty good, but not the best I veal I have ever had. It came with a big slice of ""macaroni casserole"" I would call it, but it was probably the best macaroni casserole I had ever had. My wife had the salmon special, which she decided was the best salmon she had ever had.  They have a set of steaks done in different ways, each about $30 or less, which I was surprised to see as the same dishes at a steakhouse would be $40-50 or more.  Our experience was very good.

I really enjoyed the salads we ordered as they were fresh and beautifully plated.  My Dijon-""crusted"" salmon was very disappointing.  There was nothing crusted about it!  What the dish had was a soggy breading with little flavor on top of a piece of fish whose freshness I was having doubts about.  My boyfriend's steak was delicious with Merlot butter, I would definitely order that the next time.  As for the frites, they were nothing special.  I would take the Hopleaf frites over Mon Ami Gabi any day.   I will come back to Mon Ami if I am in the mood for a steak and don't want to pay a fortune.  However, if I happen to have just received my paycheck you can find me at Wildfire!",0.7921,0.806,0.108,0.086,0.5354285714285715

2007-01-14,1.0,"I thought Mon Ami Gabi to be one of the most overrated dining establishments I have ever found.   The Beldon is a pretty place to wander around before the meal, but the dining experience was not satisfying at all.  We had a reservation for 8pm on a Friday night.  We were not seated until 9pm.  I understand things get backed up (especially on a weekend), but what's the point in even making a reservation if you are going to be seated in whatever order you show up in anyways? The menu:  I did not like the bread (it felt and tasted like it had been sitting out for a week), but the butter was great.  The lobster bisque was the most salty and fishy bisque I have ever had.  The bisque was a terrible, terrible way to start off the meal.  I enjoyed the frites.  They were tasty.  Then again, they are french fries.  Sonic and McDonald's can do that.  My steak was cooked correctly, but the flavor left me wondering why someone would ruin a nice piece of meat with that much seasoning.    The Service:  The water service was great.  My water glass rarely got below 1/2 full before being refilled.  The waiter showed up only 10 or 15 minutes after we sat there looking annoyed because we couldn't find him.  Even sending the water fillers to find our server was a chore.  He sucked.  I thought that the menu was overpriced for the quality of food we received. All in all, I would not recommend Mon Ami Gabi to anyone looking for a nice night out.  Maybe it was because it was a weekend, maybe not.  Either way, i don't think there is any excuse for this meal being so all around dissatisfying.  The service was terrible, the food overseasoned, overpriced, and underwhelming.  The quality of the meal left a lot to be desired...",-0.9372,0.8,0.081,0.12,0.6681818181818182
