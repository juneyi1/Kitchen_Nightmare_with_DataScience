2017-09-01,4.0,"We traveled to the North Michigan Avenue in Chicago for hot meal(dinner), and they have jazz with a three combo. We get seat about 7:50 pm for 7:45 reservation, we were a tad last. The spinach dip was very good, and they left the salt shaker in the kitchen.  The lack of salt was great for me. Roc has the trout and she was very thankful. The Seattle-Style BBQ salmon was on point with the pommé purée and broccoli . They service honey for sweeting my cup of tea. The desserts were hit and miss. The miss was the apple walnut cobbler with a side of vanilla ice cream. The apples and nuts were better on the tree. The milk for the ice cream missed it calling as ice cream. Now for the banana cream pie with whipped  cream, caramel sauce, sliced bananas (huge), and shaved dark chocolate was good...... I would get a taffy apple from Old Town Fudge Pot next time . The company for dining was over the top.... Shalom",0.8012,0.867,0.078,0.055,0.44974358974358974
2017-08-31,5.0,"It gets a little tricky to find a good dining spot on Michigan Avenue despite all the great retail going on on this street. Bandera, however, salvages this situation. I came here for lunch and was blown away by the quality of food, the speed, quality and efficiency of service as well as the atmosphere in general. The corn bread is an absolute MUST ORDER item. Please get it and you'll understand why. I was so blown away by how perfect the crust was and the sweetness balanced with savory flavor profiles was amazing, not to mention the soft (almost custard-like) texture... can you tell I'm in love?!  I also ordered the lamb sandwich with coleslaw as side and it was delicious and comes in a huge portion so I ended up taking half a sandwich home.

A girls weekend away in Chicago! Perfect stop for an amazing meal to remember that we gals will remember for awhile. Got started off with the macho salad as an appetizer we all shared and their homemade corn bread. These two alone gave a song to our tastebuds to sing! Macho salad has a great dressing, creamy goat cheese and avocado, just delish! Cornbread like never before, it's out of this world good. A little more moist than usual cornbread and a crunchy top crust that's addictive. My tri tip beef medallion paired with a hearty sized duo sauces enchilada was a great pairing. Only complaint of mine was the beef was a little fatty. The companion ladies ordered the juicy amazing rotisserie chicken & beef BBQ ribs, also just perfectly seasoned with good flavor but not over powering, a great balance of textures and flavor. My aunt ordered the pork fillet that was fabulous but a little dry, very well seasoned. I just had to have the homemade Oreo ice cream sandwich with homemade ice cream! It has an espresso sauce I wanted to roll around in and slurp all day! Just a feast for royalty! I haven't had a meal that left me this smitten in years. Great staff and service!

Every course and every drink was delivered by someone else. Because they don't keep their guests waiting. Live Jazz. Wonderful. Paul Martin Trio on Wednesday and the room was full, with people in line. Volume was perfect, tempo was great and the selections were great. A few Sinatra songs and I was in heaven. The drinks are made beautifully by real, experienced bartenders. I tried both old fashioned's and manhattans. Even their well brands are strong. My friend had a filet that was perfectly prepared. I picked a simple fish, just see how they would do. It was Country Chicken. You can't hide a badly prepared chicken this way, and I was pleased. It was moist, flavorful and I enjoyed it- hell I enjoyed my entire evening. As I'm traveling here at often, I'm looking forward to becoming a regular.  There are fancier places.

Both were very large pieces of fish cooked perfectly. The trout was spicy but not overly. The salmon melted in your mouth. You had your choice of 2 sides with the fish dishes. They also have several options that aren't on the menu for kids; grilled cheese or a hamburger or you can get a smaller portion of an entree from the menu. The wait staff was very attentive.

Bartender was friendly and served us quickly even though she was busy.  Once seated, we started with the guac/queso dip. It was good but small portion for the price. My 16 yr son who usually orders burgers, raved about his cheeseburger...said the bun was really good. Only small complaint was he asked for medium and it was slightly undercooked. My daughter and I shared the caesar salad and bbq ribs. Caesar was good but was too heavy on the dressing. We both liked the flavor of the ribs. My husband ordered the rotisserie chicken/bbq ribs and asked to have fries. The waitress mistakenly said the dish already was served with fries. My husband said he thought ribs were overcooked, chicken was just luke warm/didn't have any flavor, and didn't get his fries until the rest of us were already done with our meals.  Waitress didn't check on us after meals were served, so I had to flag her down and asked for ketchup and complained about the chicken. Another woman that wasn't our waitress (maybe manager) asked how our meals were and offered my husband another rotisserie chicken or more ribs but my husband declined since he didn't enjoy the dish. They took his meal off our bill but my husband left hungry which was disappointing since it was our last night in Chicago.  If up to my husband, he'd give restaurant two stars.

If i could eat a plate of the ribs and the coleslaw that comes with them for the rest of my life, I honestly would. What I've noticed with most of the salads and vegetables there is that they always taste exceptionally clean, light and never overdressed, The service is always great too, sometimes they get pretty busy, but I've never gotten frustrated with how they handle wait times and seating, since they are exceptionally good at making sure you aren't ignored or overlooked, and often seat you before their given wait time.

My nephew got the burger and he loved it too.  Overall excellent experience, a little pricey but worth it. The salad was $20 and the French dip was $22.",0.9954,0.737,0.256,0.007,0.518647342995169

I have been coming here for years and it never disappoints the only reason I knocked off the star is because I feel habitually rushed here- I'm not at the Cheesecake Factory.  Ironically if you eat at the bar they rush you less.  Ambience is romantic with dim lighting and nightly jazz.  The Kale salad is one of my favorites, it's finely chopped with mint in a light buttery dressing that makes me crave salad! So good!  The lamb sandwich is to die for, I seriously have never had a sandwich as good as this - this is a must order if it's your first time in.  Their Margarita is better than their Moscow Mule - and I am a Moscow Mule drinker  If your a tuna fan their ahi poke salad and appetizer are delicious.  I've had their cornbread - I am not a fan, try the spinach artichoke dip instead. For dessert- order their homemade ice cream oreo cookie sandwich. They use a warm chocolate expresso topping which gives it sophistication and a perfect decadent pick me up after a meal.

We then each got the macho salad which was absolutely divine. I seriously think it's one of my favorite salads in Chicago now. Wish there was a bandera in the burbs as I always go to Wildfire for the chopped salad but I think I may have actually liked this one a tad more. We were super full from each having a salad as the portion was pretty large so we could have even shared and gotten a dessert. I really wanted to try their banana cream pie as it looked divine from a table next to us.

Two of us split the prime rib sandwich and fries and couldn't have eaten a whole one!  It was absolutely delicious!  Best I've ever had! Just lots of thick, tender, flavorful, tasty meat on great tasting bread with some mayo and au jus. I'm already craving another even though it's a $19.00 sandwich. Worth every penny!  Wish the fries had been a little hotter and less greasy but they were still very good.  The cheeseburger was huge and cut in three pieces and my granddaughter said it was very good. Definitely worth the extra walking we did to backtrack to Bandera.  Note: 5 days later and the prime rib sandwich at Bandera is the best thing I have eaten on our trip to Chicago and we've eaten every meal out.  Wednesday night around 6:30 we tried to get in again but there was a 45 minute wait.

2017-03-18,3.0,Popped in to take a break from shopping and touristy stuff. The reviews online looked good so I thought I would give it a try. I arrived around 4pm on Saturday and was able to be seated quickly at a table. The bar was full otherwise I would have opted for a bar seat. I came during a shift change so I didn't meet my actual waitress until 15-20 mins after I ordered.  Service - the hostess was friendly and seated me quickly. The waitress that took my drink and food order was friendly and helpful about menu selections. The waitress that ended up being my actual waitress was nice but it was awkward since she came in after the fact (I think she may have been slightly late for her shift). The service was good overall but I felt that I was rushed out of the restaurant. I was trying to finish a glass of wine and ordered an espresso so I could sit a bit longer and finish my wine. The check was brought over with the espresso so I took that as a hint to leave. I moved over to the bar to finish my glass of wine (truth be told I'm a slow drinker).  Food - good. I ordered the French dip and it was tasty. My favorite part was probably the spicy mayo I dipped my fries in. The food was good but not great.  I think if I hadn't felt rushed by the staff so they could turn over the table I would have enjoyed my experience more.,0.9695,0.855,0.115,0.029,0.5329545454545455

However, when we looked at the menu, we were shocked to see only two desserts: the oreo ice cream sandwich and the apple cobbler! Fortunately, the bartender told us that they were featuring the banana cream pie that night, so even though it wasn't on the menu, we could order it. Phew, crisis averted. Now, let's talk about the bcp. Hands down, the best pie I have EVER eaten in my entire life. It was phenomenal. Creamy custard, fluffy homemade whipped cream, crunchy golden brown graham cracker crust, caramel drizzle over everything, and some sliced bananas on the side. Hoo boy. We ate every single crumb on the plate, and damn near licked it clean that pie was so good.  The only thing that caused me to subtract a star was the price: $11 for a piece of pie? That seems kinda greedy, Bandera. And the pie slice couldn't have been more than 1/6 of the full pie. But, service was excellent, and this may just be one of the quality over quantity places. One final plus of the place: they have a live jazz trio! We were seated close by, which made it fun and pain-free to wait for our dessert to come out.

It's quite a bit of cornbread--too much for only two people, but the perfect amount for four. The salad was delicious!! Shredded greens, chopped egg, and an incredibly flavorful vinaigrette. It was a great choice. The prime rib was HUGE. It was a thick cut of meat, and it was bone in. The cod was good, but was overpriced for the small portion. You should definitely consider splurging on a bottle of wine. The wine list isn't very extensive, but they have a selection of great producers and beautiful wines at extremely cheap prices.

Having said that, the upgrades they've made over the years, such as the live jazz music, have been a consistent draw. However, my husband (who as a Fairmont employee has thrown them business for years) and I only come here on special occasions because of the atmosphere (and occasionally delicious prime rib), and although those include our birthdays, as well as our anniversary, they have never once done anything special, even when the information was given in the reservation beforehand. There seems to be a real attitude problem for the most part, as if only the beautiful people should be eating here, which I highly doubt applies to all the tourists on the Magnificent Mile. There is not any sense of caring about customers, let alone the dismissive attitude when you try to engage any of the servers in any kind of conversation (even when it's about the history of their own restaurant). So, for the price, the inconvenience of taking a cab there, and the snobbish attitude, I'll be taking my business elsewhere.",0.9369,0.819,0.124,0.056,0.7088571428571429

I loved the cornbread, but I really wish it came with a side of butter or something gooey to smother it with. Just personal preference.  For food we ordered the filet, veggie burgers, and the BBQ combo. I think the general consensus was the food was okay, but nothing amazing or great.

Ick - again tasty, but extremely heavy. It's a huge serving, so be prepared to have leftovers or share with a big group. For my main meal I ordered the whitefish, which came with french fries and a cucumber salad. I liked the cucumber salad, the white fish was okay but lacked a lot of flavor and seemed a little overcooked, and the fries were lackluster. If you're gonna put fries in your body they better be good, and these just were not. I say it's heavy because everything on the menu just seems heavy and grandiose. Even the platters our food came on were huge and took up half the table. I'm glad I tried Bandera, but wouldn't rush to come back. It's just not the type of food I can stomach on a regular basis.

The drink menu was nice- classic cocktails and a decent wine list. The food menu was pretty simple- one page, with apps, salads, entrees, desserts, and a specialties section that included a couple of sandwich options. My party all chose from the entree list, or one of the entree specials our server told us about. The only thing that was a little off was the cornbread as a starter. It had bitter clumps in it- i think baking soda that hadn't been mixed in. My entree- a NY strip, was fantastic and cooked perfectly. The veggie sides were fresh and well seasoned.

It was packed with people and the live Jazz music was on. It was a classy and elegant restaurant with dim lighting. I ordered mojito, grilled artichokes, Rotisserie chicken with a side of cucumber and a hand made Oreo ice cream sandwich. They did an excellent job on the appetizer. The artichokes were grilled perfectly with light sea salt and amazing dipping sauce. The chicken was juicy and moist and the salad was similar like Mediterranean style.

The food service is quick and efficient, but all you get are one word answers and minimal conversation. I was in town, traveling by myself and I sat at the bar. The veggie burger was incredible, best one around - so much flavor and a huge portion. The coleslaw was good, but not special. I wanted to get a piece of the famous cornbread, but I was told that they no longer serve it by the slice - only the whole skillet. I'm not sure what the rationale is for that?! I was not greeted by a hostess upon arrival - the bar staff was slow to acknowledge and take a drink order - my water glass was kept full, but I was never offered a second drink or dessert. I do not expect long conversations with the bartender, I know they are busy - but some personality would be nice. All of the servers were rushing around with no smiles - they looked super stressed.

Called and made a reservation for moms birthday and decided to go with this restaurant since reviews were amazing, food looked amazing and they had live jazz. They definitely were off their A game this night.  Called and had reservations at 730, told them it was a special tonight as we were celebrating a big birthday. Seated right away which was good, host was not that welcoming, had to reassure them we were celebrating a birthday just to make sure the night went well.  Once seated, things just didn't seem to get better. The waiter was young and didn't look like he liked this job - you're a waiter - smile a little. We ordered drinks that came out sporadically. The cocktails we ordered came out first but what made me upset is when granny ordered orange juice. It came out almost 15 minutes later then when she tried it, it was so sour and full of pulp. We had to order her something else and when we told John, the waiter that never smiles, he said that's how OJ taste then walked away. That makes sense why he's so sour if he thinks orange juice is supposed to taste sour.  Overall the food was amazing. I can't complain with the chef as everyone really did enjoy the food. We had the pork, chicken and ribs, all very flavorful.  When we were about finished with our entree - ""about finished"" - the unhappy waiter came over and prematurely took our plates away without even asking if we were done. I was still munching on my damn fries John.  When my fiancé ASKED for the dessert menu, he didn't give us one, instead told us. Fine. Then we asked to order the apple a la mode, server looked surprised we were ordering dessert. That's when I just had to ask him did he know that we were celebrating moms birthday, hence why we want dessert for her special day.

2016-08-21,4.0,"Bandera surprised me. I thought it would be a touristy, bland menu. And, honestly, the menu didn't impress at first sight. But the space itself did - an intimate, elegant venue with great service that didn't care I was in jeans. The jazz pianist actually played a great variety of live music, which we had a lot of fun listening to. We stated out with the artichoke dip. Honestly, I've never had this sort of thing before and it didn't wow me. It became much improved by adding the provided salsa for a bit of kick, but I'm not sure I would order it again.  The macho salad, on the other hand, completely wowed me. A delicious mix of chicken, goat cheese, corn bread, veggies... I would eat that for lunch every day if I could. And such a big portion I couldn't even finish it!   The lamb sandwich was much improved by the jus. It was good, but not worth coming back for. Overall, a good option for the mid-range downtown dining scene. I'd go back for the salad and music if I was hunting for an option in the area.",0.9889,0.738,0.215,0.047,0.5243055555555555

Upon arrival I didn't expect us to be led by the host to a window view near the Jazz players. Our waitress was the friendly Carolyne who then offered us a bottle of champagne to celebrate the evening.   That's how it began and boy were we about to begin our tastebuds journey with the house-smoked salmon and grilled artichokes to begin our feast.   Both my wife and I ordered the aged and seasoned prime rib that was enriched with chives and parsley mash-potato and pesto broccoli.  The deliciousness was complimented by bringing Spain to us with a bottle of Muga reserva wine.   Carolyne was such a nice waitress who balanced her attentiveness with friendly conversation and deserved the 30% tip we added to the bill.   Coffee and the apple cobbler tastefully ended our meal while the Jazz music continued as we walked out a happy couple.,0.9851,0.834,0.166,0.0,0.5690476190476191

The atmosphere of the restaurant has more of an intimate type of feel to it. I don't remember seeing any children so that kinda implies that this place isn't really kid friendly.  They have live music and I believe they have different musical acts night. The musicians that played (pianist and a guitarist) when I had visited the restaurant played modern pop music (Taylor Swift) and old time favorites like Don't stop believing by -Journey with a jazzy like of twist to their music.  The food was great overall. We both ordered the bbq chicken and prime beef ribs. With mashed potatoes and spinach.  The bbq beef ribs were excellent. Cooked to perfection, crunchy to the first bite but still soft enough to be tender and chewy. The chicken was good as well. It was seasoned fairly well and the bbq sauce was a great touch that gave the chicken it's extra kick.  The mashed potatoes weren't the best. In all honesty the chef could have laid off a little on the chopped onions that were mixed in as well as the the chives.  The spinach was great as well.  Overall my experience at this restaurant was great. Our waiter did a phenomenal job and just about the employees that I could see had a positive countenance.

July is peak tourist season so the restaurants on Michigan Ave were packed with waiting times of at least 45 -60 minutes.  We saw the sign for Bandera which is located on the second floor at 535 N. Michigan Ave and thought let's see what this place is like.  I vaguely remember eating here probably 20 years ago when I lived in Chicago but couldn't recall what the food was like.  I was overwhelmed by the quality of the food and the outstanding service we received.  There was a wait of 30+ minutes so we waited in the bar where Christine was our bartender. The wine list was impressive as they carried some smaller CA vineyards not usually seen on the wine offerings of other mainstream places.  The atmosphere in this restaurant is pleasant and the noise level is such that we could actually have a conversation without shouting at each other.  Once we were seated, our server, Michelle, was top notch. Friendly and professional.  She recommended the corn bread for an appetizer and all I can say is YUM.  Hot, fresh, delicious. Right out of the oven.  For my main course, I had the macho salad which included fresh avocado as well as delicious roasted chicken.  Our experience at Bandera was a solid 5 stars.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",0.995,0.787,0.213,0.0,0.5300285714285714

We were lucky enough to get a seat facing Michigan Ave at night while the Christmas decorations for Chicago were still up. The ambience was absolutely incredible between having the view of Michigan Ave, the dim candlelit dinner, and the jazz musicians who were directly behind us. Even with the musicians being so close, we were still able to have a pleasant conversation without having to yell over the music. Every dish that we ordered was very well-done. We ordered the ""house-smoked salmon"" as an appetizer; the smoked flavor was definitely very rich and when the salmon was put on bread and covered with the spread provided, it melts in your mouth. We also ordered ""today's very fresh fish"" and the ""rotisserie lamb sandwich."" Both entrees were prepared and cooked very well and completed our wonderful experience.

The sandwiches were okay.  I had a Lamb sandwich that came with a weird dipping sauce that tasted like nothing.  The fries that came with it were a complete failure, undercooked and mostly tasteless.  The sandwich itself was fine.  The wife ordered the French dip and had the same problem that I did.  The dipping sauce was tasteless so the sandwich was essentially a pile of steak chunks.

2016-05-30,4.0,"Went here for dinner on a Sunday evening - we had a reservation and were seated right away when we arrived. Both the hostess and our waitress were very friendly. As other Yelpers have noted the restaurant is dark, but I didn't think it was *too* dark. I also didn't find the jazz band to be too loud to carry on a conversation, although we weren't sitting directly next to them. We had the cornbread as an appetizer, and we all highly enjoyed it. As other Yelpers have noted it is served without butter, but it is moist and flavorful enough that butter is not needed. It is a little crumbly but not to the point where it's difficult to eat.  For dinner my friends and I had the bbq beef back ribs, the pork filet, and the fish of the day. Everybody was very happy with their meal. Everything tasted great, portion sizes were generous, and presentation was good too. They were happy to do side substitutions at no extra charge, so I had spinach with my ribs instead of coleslaw. My husband and friend had the Oreo ice cream sandwich for dessert. I'm lactose intolerant so did not partake, but it looked delicious.  My husband and I will definitely go back. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is that my husband said that his $13 old fashioned was very watered down. Disappointing to go to such a nice place and drop that much money on a drink and not get your money's worth. In their defense though he didn't send it back and didn't tell them that he was unhappy with it either. I'm sure they would have been happy to remake it or take it off our ticket.  As an aside, the dress code was not as strict as I had believed. I had wanted to go to Bandera last time I visited Chicago but I only had blue jeans and a blouse to wear and was advised by a friend that jeans would not be appropriate. Now that I've been, it would have been fine. In fact we saw a lot of people in athletic wear when we were there.",0.9954,0.779,0.173,0.047,0.5244778613199665
2016-05-30,3.0,"In  in the chi for the weekend  and wanted to treat a Family friend to a nice dinner. We ended up settling on this place due to another place having an hour-and-a-half wait. I should have known in Chicago it is good to call for reservations on a Saturday night especially a holiday Saturday night. We arrived and the place was packed!  we were told by the hostess that it would be around an hour wait but we could stop by the bar for drinks. The wait turned out not to be an hour, it turned out to be about 25 minutes which was good. Service: The best thing I can say about this restaurant is that their service was impeccable. From the time we stepped into the door, there was a smiling hostess and smiling maitre d. Once we got to our table our waiteress (Michelle I believe) didn't disappoint as well. She was very attentive and took care of all of our needs. She was very nice and open and we really enjoyed the hospitality of the place. The staff worked really well together to take care of each table; sometimes someone else brought us out of refills or someone else brought us our entrees, we really did not have to wait or ask for anything. Ambience The place is beautiful, it's nestled right on Michigan Avenue so very busy busy location.  Inside has a really nice romantic feel, the lights for dinner were dimmed  down low but you can tell that the room was very nicely laid out. One of the things that we really enjoyed was that they had a live piano player who was accompanied by a guitarist.  The pianon guy played beautifully, lots of old songs and new songs of different genres. It was such a nice background to our dinner.  The piano player does accept tips and also accepts request as well and unlike some places where the live musicians get annoyed when people ask for request whenever anyone asked of him he always had a smiling face and let them know that if you would be able to play or not. Food This is the area is where we ended up being disappointed. We ordered an appetizer which was the house-made cornbread. This was very delicious, very plentiful, and one of the highlights of the dinner.  For my entree, I ordered the house special which consisted of baked group with lemon butter sauce, crispy shrimp on top, a side of chive mashed potatoes.  The dish was suppose to come with broccoli, however I was able to sub that for extra mashed  potatoes  at no charge.  The fish was tender but very bland :(  and the lemon butter sauce added no additional  flavor.  I tried putting  pepper on the dish to season it up but that didnt help much.  The mashed potatoes  were mixed in with chive, however, it was over kill and it totally  overpowered the taste of the potatoes.  The dish overall was a disappoint, in addition, it came out Luke warm which is never good. My husband ordered the roasted pork loin that came with the mashed potatoes and red cabbage.  His pork was very delicious (flavorful) and tender.  I think I enjoyed  his dish better than mine lol.  he the cabbage was ok and felt the same about the potatoes  that I did.  Again, his was Luke warm as well.  The pork was the warmest on his plate. Our family friend ordered the French dip sandwich. It tasted ok but again it came out just warm so 5 min into dinner it was cold. Dessert  They had a house made oreo cookie ice cream sandwich.  It came with 2 cookies and was enough  to share.  This was the second  highlight of the meal.  The flavors of the dish blended in very well. Everyone  thought it was very yummy. With 2 glasses of wine, 1 app, 3 entrees, 1 desert; the bill came out to $124 .  Overall, the restaurant  has all the right  qualities to make it a 4 or 5 star, they just need to improve on the food aspect.  We won't  be dinning back due to for the price the food was lackluster and the surplus of restaurant options in Chicago for the same price range.",0.9991,0.75,0.198,0.052,0.536612920091181

Using Yelp recommendations, I called a few places without any success. When I phoned Bandera the hostess was so helpful. She said that she didn't have availability at that time but that she would put us at the top of the wait list. I told her ""Fine"" that we would have cocktails in the bar until a table became available. However, when we arrived they seated us right away. The decor, ambiance & noise level is just right. I hate restaurants were the noise is so much you can't talk without screaming at each other. We started with their signature cornbread appetizer & it was warm & delicious. Three of us ordered the special which was a 16oz New York Strip with fries & a watercress salad. I like a medium rare steak; you know a warm pink center. The steaks were cooked perfectly throughout; from first bite to last.  Everyone was very pleased with their meals. One guy in our party is very needy but the server was never flabbergasted by his demands (although I would have been if I was in her shoes). She was perfect too!

The corn bread appetizer, which everyone seems to rave about, was tasteless, overly dry and a bomb.  I have had good corn bread before, but this was poor by comparison.  All three of us felt the same and would never order it again.  The two ladies had a masch salad which was very good.   I ordered the Classic Cheeseburger medium rare along with an accompanying side of sauteed spinach.  Here was the problem.  The cheeseburger was presented and was between two slices of what appeared to be a very dry baguette.  Even worse it was piled with lettuce, tomato and onion and was, no kidding, about four inches high!  No way one could eat it without disassembing it and eating it with a knife and fork which I did.  Not only was the cheeseburger just ""warm"" -- it was and not medium rare but WELL DONE...and inedible.  I called  the waiter over and he totally agreed and apologized, etc.  He did remove it from the bill and also comped us one glass of wine for the problem which was very much appreciated. Sorry to say that Bandera was unable to properly execute a simple cheeseburger.  Whoever was on the grill should be reprimanded.  Unfortunately I will never go back as this restaurant is absolutely nothing special with so many other wonderful restaurants available in the Michigan Avenue area.  First experience...a dud.",-0.57,0.763,0.111,0.126,0.5870658263305322

The live jazz was perfectly pitched so that people could still talk, but loud enough that a solo person like myself could still enjoy it. I ordered the veggie burger with sautéed spinach on the side. I debated an app and was glad I didn't - the burger was very filling! The burger patty is beet-based so when it arrived it almost looked like a meat patty. Unfortunately the patty itself had very little keeping it together except the gooey cheese on top - my first half of the sandwich went to pieces in my hand. After mopping up with a knife and fork I went to town on the second half. The trick is to leave the little pins holding it together as long as you can, and eat around the edge going for the parts that are in imminent danger of falling apart. The burger overall was good but not life changing. It was missing a certain something...I couldn't truly say what. The buttered burger bun was quite good though. The sautéed spinach on the side was good - not overcooked or soggy, plenty of little garlic bits. Service was great. Attentive and friendly.

Waitress was super friendly and provided honest recommendations while  We got some champagne, split the spinach artichoke dip and then each got macho salads.  Champagne- We wanted rose but there was only one champagne not sold by the bottle. So, that was that. It was good though (and their champagne flutes were adorable) Spinach Artichoke Dip- Came with sour cream & salsa which we didn't touch, probably a bit unnecessary in my opinion. The dip itself however was great. Very heavy on the spinach, which didn't make you feel like you were just eating a ton of cheese. Great consistency and would be perfect for a group of 2-3. Any more than that and you may need a second order. Macho Salad- I find myself to be a bit of a salad snob, coming from LA which was land of plentiful salads, but this one was delicious. I work nearby and would totally order this for takeout if possible on days when I`m craving salad. The roasted chicken on it was perfectly flavored and the goat cheese was not overpowering.

It had really good flavors and tasted as if it was simmering for a very long time. It honestly might be the most memorable dish of the night..

It wasn't the hostesses fault, people just didn't want to leave because the music was so good!  The hostess was so incredibly nice and apologetic about the situation and offered us a free appetizer.  We got the salmon with bread which we all agreed was amazing! Once we were seated we all agreed the food was worth the wait! I got the southwest salad with corn, dates, and goat cheese. We were so stuffed when we were done but we still managed to make room for banana cream pie and Oreo pie dessert.  I highly recommend giving this place a try.",0.9806,0.838,0.151,0.011,0.507536231884058

The staff were friendly, prompt, and professional and had great recommendations for dinner. I ordered the white fish dish and split a bottle of red wine with my friends. For starters, we tried the duo dip which was unfortunately a tad too salty for our taste. When our waiter found out however, he was quick to recommend a replacement (smoked salmon) and got it for us on the house. So very nice of him! It was definitely a much better option and we were happy. Entrees didn't follow too far behind; my friends ordered the prime rib and prime filet and shared some with everyone - delicious! I was wanting their food by the end of the night. One of my friends was new to the city and mentioned this to the waiter, and guess what...he brought her dessert on the house! Overall, fab dinner experience in a great environment. Will have to return for more of the ambience and that prime filet! Mmmmm.",0.996,0.716,0.273,0.01,0.5954545454545455

He raved on and on about the excellent menu choices, a signature dessert, and the thing that swoons me away the most, live jazz.  Main Entrees: Bandera met all those expectations and more. I ordered the daily Fresh Fish with Lemon Butter (the one that comes with crispy rock shrimp, broccoli, and mashed potatoes) and it hit the spot! My favorite part of restaurants and dishes is where there is a variety of tastes and palettes, which this dish definitely had. My boyfriend ordered the tri-tip & butternut white cheddar enchilada (we always taste each other's dishes). Very tasty and the meat was perfectly cooked and the enchilada wasn't too cheesy or filling. Delicious and zesty sauce. I would order this next time!  Dessert: Then the dessert came and of course we made room for the House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches. Never had anything like it and this dessert immediately jumped onto my top 5 of desserts tasted over the years. You could practically hear my boyfriend and I raving over this dessert and how great it tasted. Definitely something to come back for!  Ambiance/Service/Music: The service was excellent. The waiter was friendly to when I realized they forgot to accommodate to an allergy (scallions in the mashed potatoes), and brought out a new side dish right away, scallion-free. The waiters cracked jokes to us and made it a good time. Music came out halfway into our dinner and even though we were sitting right next to the band, I was still able to carry on normal level conversation over a glowing view of North Michigan Ave's bustling streets.  Tip for ambiance, no athletic wear or shirtless sleeves. Since this surprise date included trekking 5 hours prior in Chicago, we dressed for the exercising and were slightly under-dressed. Was still seated but will keep this in mind for next time!  Overall: An excellent experience and date and I seriously applaud my boyfriend for finding this place. Not only was the food delicious, but it was complimented by great service, classy music, and a true ambiance of the city.

Bandera is everything that you would expect from a restaurant on Michigan Ave. Bandera is trendy, busy, pricey, and you are guaranteed to wait an extended period of time no matter the day of the week.  From the moment I walked into Bandera I was in love with the overall vibe and decor of the place. The hostess was very knowledgeable and gave us a little history on all of the artwork in restaurant while we waited for a table. The wait time on the Sunday evening we went was roughly 45 minutes but with the bar packed we just had to awkwardly stand around. I would love to see a place like Bandera have a larger bar area.  Once we got a table everything that followed was fantastic. The pianist had just returned once we got to our table and played beautifully. Our waitress was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be at work. The food is indeed pricey but so delicious. Everyone at my table had great things to say about everything they ordered.  If you decide to visit Bandera you have to try one of the desserts. I had the chance to try the House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich.

I typically eat here for lunch and try to find someone to share the chicken and beef with so I get my 'fix' of both favorites. In regards to the chicken, I think it's a toss up as to whether to have the sandwich or the Macho Salad (w/ chicken)?!  One of the most difficult decision of my life.

The iron skillet cornbread was sumptuous, filled with jalapenos and cheddar and an easy rival for other cornbreads in Texas. The ribs/chicken combo meal with the coleslaw and fries made for an incredible entree. I believe the ribs exceeded the chicken in tenderness and flavor, while the coleslaw was delicious without being overwhelming. To finish off the meal, the home made oreo ice cream sandwich was suitably epic, with delightful chocolate ganache compounded with crispy disks of oreo and cookies-n-cream ice cream.

2015-09-12,5.0,My husband and I had dinner at Banderra last night and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  We had the cornbread which was awesome as well as the French dip sandwiches.  Believe the hype!  Allison P. was our server and we bowed down to her skillz.  I am usually a huge stickler for service and she did a great job.  Everything ran pretty smoothly with service but she got extra points for bringing out a chilled glass for my side car (I didn't have to ask for it) after we had been sitting awhile.  She also  packed some fresh piping hot au jus for the sandwiches we had to get wrapped.  Great job!,0.9625,0.818,0.182,0.0,0.5696581196581196

2015-08-29,4.0,"I love the atmosphere of this place, which is intimate and fairly dark, with spotlights aimed at the tables rather than the diners. The live jazz is just the right volume, giving the place a supper club feel. The menu is similar to Hillstone's and Houston's, which isn't surprising since it's affiliated. A couple of our favorite starters from there appear here. The spinach artichoke dip is creamy, and served with sturdy tortilla chips perfect for dipping. Also included are sour cream and a salsa with just a hint of heat. House smoked salmon is very smokey, delicate and flaky, served with crisp toast and a mayo and dill based spread. Bandera's Caesar salad isn't for purists, as it uses kale, and the croutons are made from a fairly sweet corn bread. Ours were heavily over-dressed, but when the waitress noticed we weren't enjoying them she immediately had them remade with about one fifth the dressing, and they were much better. A house specialty is the enchilada, which is available with steak or a la carte. It's a bit unusual in that it's stuffed with squash, but is quite creamy, cheesy and satisfying. Much of the menu is given over to burgers and other sandwiches, so the price for dinner and a show can be quite reasonable.  Service was super attentive without being intrusive. Waits can be long, so reserve ahead, despite the fact that their reservation system doesn't work as well as opentable. This is definitely a great place for live jazz in a supper club atmosphere.",0.9798,0.847,0.126,0.027,0.5963464696223316

Our server, Eddie, was charming and excellent at his job.  Just the right amount of attention.   He didn't rush us.   We had a delicious bottle of Chapallette 2012 Mountain Cuvee for $42  (retails at $32 so not a bad price for a restaurant).   We shared the Macho Salad to start.  It's so delicious.  Google it too see the perfect combo of ingredients.  It's heaven!  Then we shared the beef ribs, fries and cole slaw.  The fries came with a spicy mayo that was terrific.  The rib meat was fall off the bone tender and the sauce had a terrific kick but not too wicked.   The fries were delicious.   Eddie recommended the homemade Oreo ice cream sandwich dessert so we shared that too.  It was the perfect finish.  Holding back one star since there was no bread and butter to kick off the dinner.  If they have a bread basket, it wasn't offered.   Also, there could have been more fries.  It was a smallish portion for the price.   I would come back again and ask for bread and a generous portion of fries and bask in 5 star food heaven!   (Thanks, Eddie!  Hope to see you again!)",0.9955,0.744,0.246,0.01,0.7294047619047619
2015-08-23,2.0,"Showed up early to our Sunday evening reservation and were seated immediately - nice. View of the jazz duo - even better. The setting is classy and svelte, with a nice view out the front windows into the street. The jazz was light - piano and guitar - and suited the ambiance well. Wait staff was pleasant, but after seating us, they did that thing where they come by almost immediately after seating you to take your order but you haven't had a chance to even read the menu yet. They left us alone again for maybe 90 seconds before coming back  - yeah, *still* reading the menu, are you serious? So then of course they didn't come back by again for nearly 10 min. At least we had drinks already. Hubs and I split our meal - I'm an adventurous water and love trying a little bit of everything. We got the kale starter salad, the tri-tip steak with butternut enchilada and cucumber salad, and the white fish with cole slaw and fries. The salad was the best part of the meal. Wish I'd gotten a salad for dinner instead. Or  gone elsewhere entirely. The steak was cooked unevenly - about 3/4 of it was dry though not tough, while the rest was perfectly juicy and tender. The enchilada was good, but a good portion of the filling was potato, which was disappointing. I wanted butternut, like the menu advertised, not potato. I also ended up running out of sauce for the enchilada since the steak was dry and wasn't served with its own sauce, so I kept dipping it in the enchilada's. The cucumber salad was also disappointing - good ingredients, but weird pairings. Big chunks of cukes, purple onions, corn, avocado, and...kalamata olives?? Nope. Maybe if they'd cut the cuke smaller or marinated the salty olive with the other ingredients so their flavors melded. The cole slaw and fries were good, but the fish, while tender, was super bland. We doused it with hot sauce and salt to make it palatable. We'd never had that kind of whitefish before, so maybe this is normal for it, but it had a really overpowering and unpleasant taste/smell that made us think it wasn't fresh. This perception was furthered by the fact that we both started feeling ill after eating it. Hubs wasn't very affected and feels okay now but I, over four hours later, still feel sick to my stomach. Ugh. I have a sensitive stomach, despite my adventurousness, but this was a really unusual situation for me. Waitress offered us dessert, but since I was feeling so poorly, we weren't interested. Of course, the check took forever to come. I had to excuse myself while hubs paid the check. In retrospect, I wish we'd asked to speak to the manager about the fish and had it removed from our bill. All of this exacerbated by the fact that it was so dark at our table, we couldn't really see our plates. I had to shine a light on it to salt it. So annoying. On the up side, we never had to ask for water refills - they were super on top of that. Others near us seemed to be enjoying their meals.

We sat in a booth near the front of the restaurant overlooking the Mag Mile.  There were lots of large windows letting in a lot of light.  A large mirror behind our booth made it even brighter.  There were no empty tables in our section.  Despite the fact that it was busy, our server didn't rush us through our meal which was great. I wasn't ready for their Iron Skillet Cornbread to be so good!  They brought it out to the table in a mini cast iron skillet.  It was a Tex-Mex style cornbread with corn and jalapenos incorporated into the batter.  I usually don't like anything but plain cornbread but their version was delicious. I ordered the Rotisserie Lamb Sandwich, thinly carved slices of lamb with roasted peppers and arugula stacked on crusty bread.  I had them take it back to the kitchen and cook it longer.  I am not Team Pink Meat.  I like my meat cooked very well even if it is ""overcooked"" by restaurant standards.   When it came back out it was still very tender so I didn't need the cup of au jus at all.  The arugula on the sandwich was coated in a light vinaigrette or lemon juice that added a bright flavor.  The side dish Corn on the Cob was buttery with a nice kick from seasoned salt.

2015-06-27,3.0,"Ah, Bandera. Such promise...but you make the dining experience annoying and sometimes painful without apology. It's like you want US to thank YOU for the dining experience even when the customer service fails so remarkably with a giant thud.  The food is fine here and maybe better than most casual, non-chain places on Michigan. Is it great? No and never has been. I'll still take consistently good even if they are heavy handed on butter/oil/glaze--everything is shiny. They definitely embrace new food concepts like chipotle seasoning and kale and sweet potatoes but those trends seem so outdated now. Perhaps they only feel they need to compete with Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux and that's a low bar. By the way--no breadbasket here but please buy the massive calorie laden jalapeño cornbread at $8.  As for service, they consistently strike a low point. My strong suspicion is that they follow a decentralized service model with pooled tips: a random array of servers take the drink order, deliver drinks, take food order, drop off food, clear plates, etc.  Here is the problem:  no one is actually making sure your order is correct, your food is good and that you get drinks refilled. It was comedic today to count the number of servers who walked past us and noted our empty glasses and plates and offered nothing. Our supposedly designated server seemed upset that we wanted a drink refill when the meal was clearly finished. Maybe I would have ordered dessert if anyone asked...but no.

IT.   I selected Bandera for a luxurious, romantic dinner before seeing a musical in the theatre district.  This evening was an anniversary celebration for my boyfriend and I, in fact.  So we had high expectations.  Those expectations were met and exceeded!   The food was TO DIE FOR.  Service was FLAWLESS.  Ambiance dark, sexy, romantic.  The live music started a bit later than I had hoped (around 7), and we were only able to enjoy a few songs during our dessert.   A bit tricky to find from the street.  Yes, it will appear that you are entering a Men's Warehouse.  But it's up there, tucked away on the second floor.  And you are immediately transported away from the Michigan Avenue chaos and into Bandera's sexy, dark, deliciousness. Too expensive for us to enjoy regularly, but we'll be back again for another splurge meal.  If only for that FOOD.  Because every single bite was truly just WOW.",0.9734,0.802,0.16,0.038,0.5102069597069597

The only issue in terms of food quality I've experienced is the veggie burger--my girlfriend really disliked it and had very little integrity-- it fell apart as she ate it.

My other half (the fiance) and I both love it here, and the prices are fitting for the area and well worth it in our opinion. It feels like a meat-eaters delight when here though with my crew as they all seem to order ribs, prime rib, french dip, lamb and all things meat meaty and meatier. Although there are a few salads on the menu, it lacks a bit for the vegetarian since all the salads are based around meat or fish on them (such as the tuna, roasted chicken, grilled chicken, etc.) It would be nice to have a vegetarian salad that included some vegetarian protein as well such as quinioa or something. The veggie burger has some type of strange sweet flavor and not a fan, but they do have a veggie burger for those interested.  They offer take home roasted chickens (whole) and they do a really good roasted chicken so that's a total plus. And, the banana cream pie has caramel- enough said!

Can't say that I was disappointed in the least, the staff was wonderful and our server was a lot of fun. Loved the fact that they had live music, and yes the musicians take requests! Despite being dark in the restaurant I didn't find it being a problem, it was definitely a lot dimmer than where I work so I thought that was odd but had no problems seeing what so ever.  Regarding the food, definitely would go back for a special occasion. It's a little pricier than I can generally afford but that's not to say I won't be back. The food was good, we started out with the Dip Duo (guacamole and queso). Jonathan (our server) said it had a bit of a kick to it, and he was right. Not at all a bad thing, but I would have liked more guacamole to balance out the heat.

Their Ding's coleslaw is to die for! It has a great, cozy atmosphere. It was perfect for a birthday dinner date.

We had been walking around all day so we stopped in around 8 hoping to get seated early, but it was PACKED and were told the wait would be an hour and a half anyways. The band was playing and it looked lively and fun. We left to grab some coffee at Starbucks to pass the time, but when we came back the band was already done playing --- kind of a bummer, but everything else made up for it. Our server came by and recommended the Vesper when we asked for a cocktail that was not too sweet. It has gin, vodka, and lillet blanc. It had just the right amount of gin in there to not be too overpowering but still had the lovely fragrance of juniper berries. I would totally get this and/or make this on my own! Thank you James Bond for my new favorite cocktail. For food, we had the Ahi Tuna Salad and Spit Roasted Pork Filet. The tuna was perfectly seared and delicious. The honey-lime vinaigrette was light and refreshing and went really well with the mangoes. The pork dish came with mashed potatoes and HOLY MOLY were they a little ball of buttery goodness.

Good call as when we got there it wasn't anywhere near crowded, but a little after 12 and the place was swamped and looked to have a wait at the door.  We were seated instantly and was told they have their grilled artichoke back on the menu for a limited time. My friend loves their artichoke and was hoping that it would be back. The appetizer came with 3 so we had 1 each and split the 3rd....very good and grilled/seasoned to perfection. In terms of the entree I went with the Rotisserie Lamb Burger which was very good as well. It came with roasted peppers and arugula which definitely added to the already delicious flavor. I had the option of fries, coleslaw or tabbouleh...I went with the latter. I'm not the biggest tabbouleh fan, but this was really good...best I ever had actually. I looked around at everyone's plates and everything looked scrumptious!  Our server was really nice as she took very good care of us...very informative and personable.

2015-03-17,5.0,"This review is long overdue. I discovered this hidden gem back in February while I was staying at the International. One evening I was was eagerly searching for a place to have dinner, I tend to be a creature of habit, so I wanted to dine at a restaurant I hadn't yet visited and with good food. To my luck I stumbled upon Bandera here on yelp. Once I looked at the four star rating and reviews, I was sold. While I was looking for this place I was a bit confused because I stroll along the mag mile quite frequently and had never seen this restaurant before, to my surprise, Bandera's entrance is through the Men's Warehouse doors and right up the escalator. Once I arrived, I was expecting to be waiting awhile but I  was graciously greeted and seated promptly. I ordered the Famous French Dip and the Oreo Icecream Sandwich for dessert, everything was delicious! And the ambience is quite delightful along with the soothing live music playing in the background. Fast forward.....the next day after dining at Bandera's I definitely had a sweet tooth for another Oreo Icecream Sandwich. So as soon as I departed my office and before heading to my hotel room I ordered the Oreo Icecream Sandwich to go. As soon as I arrived, the hostess and the manager say ""You're back!"" (I guess they don't forget a face). I was shocked that they remember their customers. Long story short, the manager hands me my order and proceeds to tell me to ""Have a great night!"".... FREE DESSERT! OH YEAH!!!!  Because of their amazing food and superb customer service I spent my birthday at Bandera last week and everything was phenomenal. This time I had the ribs, mashed potatoes, and coleslaw... Amazing. And for dessert I had my usual lol.

2015-03-01,5.0,"Easily one of my most favorite and memorable dining experiences in Chicago thus far! The 1hour+ wait on a Saturday night was expected which lead me to roam around Michigan Ave to kill time. If you'd rather wait inside, go ahead! Soak up the relaxing atmosphere. The ambience was very genuine with the dim warm lighting, constant muffled chatter, all of which was pulled together by the live jazz. Its a pretty busy and happening place no matter where you're seated.  +1 Star Also, the service was phenomenal. I don't know if everyone was just on their game because it was a Saturday night, but each employee I came in contact with was just really friendly and accommodating. Ordering was fast and no more than 5 minutes our appetizer was already out on our table. Then our entrees came out within the following 10 minutes! Right then and there I was sold. I don't remember the last time my food was prepared so quickly.. Maybe I was just lucky. +2 Stars Food review: Appetizer: Went with the Yelp highlights and ordered the cornbread, which was really good. It seemed a bit dry or lacking in butter but the cornbread itself was very wholesome and still flavorful with a touch of jalapeño. It could easily feed 4. My dad and I ended up boxing half of it.  Entree: My dad wanted to change things up and chose the Veggie burger with a side of cole slaw. I tried both and I recommend the combination of the two! The cole slaw was a bit mustardy but very fresh tasting. I got the Rib Eye which came with mashed potatoes. Awesome deal for the price. My steak was cooked medium. Juicy inside and crispy on the edges. Dessert: Oreo Ice cream sandwich. It was our last dinner in Chicago so I had to try their dessert before leaving. I'm a huge fan of Oreo, and this dessert was pretty much perfect. Not one of those desserts overloaded with sweetness but rather a mix of dark chocolate, lightly sweetened whipped cream, oreo cookie and ice cream. Let's just say that I'm going to miss this place.

2015-01-04,5.0,"For years, Bandera's has been my go-to lunch and dinner spot for the Loop. Until the Gage, etc. opened several years ago, there just weren't many reliable, ambient joints in the area. I'm so glad it remains. Reliably tasty/niche food, good prices and ambience are probably not so unusual in a world-class city. What makes a handful of venues exceptional, such as Banderas, is as busy as they typically are, most staff maintain not only a smile but an air of appreciation for patrons. I never mind waiting. With an estimated 45 minute wait for a booth, we had bar stools in 10 minutes. Beverages and bar appetizers were fast. I had three coffees with Bailey's in addition to several glasses of water and appetizers. Not once was I made to feel like I was a bother. Perfect. Once seated, my party enjoyed the signature cornbread (needs no butter or ANYTHING, among the best of ANY Chicago restaurant I've experienced EVER), apricot glazed rotisserie half-chicken and the prime rib. The chicken was delicious as usual. And although the steak was cooked more than requested, my dinner companion refused to return it because it was still moist, tender and tasty. Sides included traditional like sautéed spinach and garlic potatoes as well as a very fresh, tasty tabbouleh salad. Service was provided by three folks during the course of our meal, each one fast, efficient and friendly. Finally, the spot offers love jazz combos on the weekends. Fantastic background for the ambience. If you seek a special spot without astronomical prices in this part of the city, give Bandera's a try.

My guest and I had the option to sit at the bar or to wait 20 minutes for a table. We were both quite hungry so we sat at the bar. I greatly appreciated the upper class atmosphere, they played a great range of lounge appropriate jazz. To my knowledge only two live jazz musicians played about 30 minutes after the time I came in (at around 5:45-6). They chose a few classic pieces (for the live music and the stereo soundtrack) that I greatly appreciated. Our server at the bar was fast and amicable. And the food was excellent. I got the small Caesar salad and the apricot rotisserie chicken and my companion for the veggie burger.  The chicken was moist and tender. It fell off the bone. The accompanying quinoa(I don't remember what it was exactly) salad was tart and complementary. A great combination.  My partner said the veggie burger was ""the best veggie burger I ever had"". I didn't have time to take a picture of it, he demolished it so quickly.  For dessert we ordered the cheesecake. I found the crust to be a little crisper than I'm used to, but it's a thick and substantial filling. Very creamy and not too sweet. I enjoyed it and it paired well with my glass of sauvignon blanc.  The wine was excellent and moderately priced. I'd definitely come here again.",0.9727,0.833,0.141,0.026,0.5393678160919539

We made reservations at 8:30 and it was swamped due to all that were in town for the show, we sitting at the bar delayed about 25-30 minutes. The staff continually checked in apologized for the wait and then we were seated. I ordered a steak sandwich and the tortilla soup both were amazing! When my brother and I got to the end of the meal to pay, the waiter said no bill.....he said the manager wanted to cover our dinner because of the wait. We hadn't complained or even spoken to the manager but the fact that she noticed us in a crowded restaurant and went above and beyond to accommodate will have my return business every time I stop in Chicago.  Service was so good we referred a colleague the next day. He did not make reservations and again the restaurant was swamped. He ended up having to wait over an hour for a table (without reservations it's to be expected). When he told the manager he was going to leave because the wait had been to long she asked him to give her 5 minutes. She apologized sincerely and asked him to please return again and handed him a 100 dollar gift card. Again BLOWN AWAY! You just don't see that kind of service these days.

We had a reservation for the three of us and were seated fairly quickly, at a really nice big table in the corner. it was really great at first, but before we even got a chance to look at our drinks, the manager came over and told us there was a bigger reservation that was supposed to have our table. Now, I worked at a restaurant in college, and once you seat people, it's really bad manners to ask them to move. Like our reservation wasn't as important as the other people the had the table for? ok.. He said one of the new girls made a mistake and grabbed our menus to take us to another table.  Now sitting in a booth, he took our drink orders, said they were on the house and left. We didn't see a server for a few minutes, but when she finally came, she asked us what we'd like to drink, and we said the manager already took them. She was really confused. Later the manager came over apologizing for everything and said our whole dinner was on the house. He kept checking in with us every ten minutes, and it honestly interrupted our nice dinner. I guess it was cool that we got the meal for free, but honestly, I wanted to treat my parents myself, and it just turned out that we were reminded all night that we had to move tables, and couldn't have a private family dinner.

2014-10-13,4.0,Bandera is a fantastic place with a lively atmosphere and a very helpful wait staff. Their cornbread is amazing and it's a must-have. Just melts in your mouth! I ordered their veggie burger with an order of fries. The burger came with a kale salad and peanut dressing. I couldn't decide which was more awesome. The kale salad was probably the best I've had in a long while. The veggie burger was just moist and very well put together.  In hindsight maybe I shouldn't have ordered the fries because I hardly touched them. They were average at best.  The portions are pretty generous and you can get pretty full with the corn bread and an entree.   We didn't have any room for dessert. I heard great things about the dinner salads here. I will be back to try them out.  Excellent restaurant!,0.9934,0.715,0.285,0.0,0.5912037037037038

The food is excellent; their queso dip is to die for (I don't even like queso). The macho salad is delicious. All of their sandwiches are great, especially the burger. It is unique and not something I've seen anywhere else. The service is top notch. We usually eat at the bar, and the bartenders are excellent at what they do. Friendly, fast, and attentive. The drinks are wonderful as well. Best margarita in the city, I am sure of it. This really is a gem of Chicago....",0.9854,0.674,0.282,0.044,0.6907685881370093

2014-10-11,3.0,"I recently tried this place out with a few others.  I think it's just ok. Overall, all of us felt the food was decent but definitely on the salty side and a bit overpriced. Dishes ordered included the pecan trout and ribs. The mashed potatoes (mixed with green beans?) that came with the trout was pretty good, but the main part of the meal (e.g. sauce on the trout, and sauce on the ribs) made all of us drink lots of water (during and after the meal). PSA from me to any restaurant that wants to be rated a 4+: Salt is NOT a substitute for good flavor. a good sauce stands alone....it doesn't need anything else.  Service was average only because no one ever came to fill our water glasses (vital due to comment above). Otherwise, the server was friendly when he/she did drop by  Soooo many better places out there (for less money)...won't be back again.",0.9769,0.803,0.166,0.031,0.40173611111111107

I guess I'd describe the food as a kind of Southern remix.  We had some awesome appetizers of the dip duo and the skillet cornbread.  The cornbread had some peppers in it so there was a definite kick! I opted for the ribs, because the waiter said they would fall off the bone... and he wasn't lying.  Who'd have thought after six years in the South, some of the best ribs I've ever had would be from CHICAGO!  It was seriously amazing.

2014-10-02,5.0,"Dinner plans at other restaurants fell through, but we were so lucky they did, because otherwise we would never have gotten the chance to visit Bandera! SERVICE: Service was superb, from the maitre d to the wait staff --- everyone was attentive, friendly without ever being intrusive.  We had a short wait since we did walk-in, but the maitre d was nice enough to offer my son some french fries, who happily chowed down.  Very thoughtful gesture.  Waiter was also impressive.  One of the few restaurants where we never felt like we had to look for him, since he was already attentive but not overly so.  Always kept an eye on our water glasses, sodas, and check/bill.  We never had to wait long for anything to come around. FOOD: Food was absolutely wonderful.   The Spinach & Artichoke Dip was very addictive.  It was rich but not heavy, perfect level of flavor without being too salty. We also  highly recommend the Snake River Farms Tri-Tip & Buternut White Cheddar Enchilada.  We've had a lot of enchilada before, but this one was hands-down the BEST. Texture was amazing, perfect temperature, enough cheese to not feel like there's too much tortilla, two different sauces to keep it interesting. Wonderful balance all around.   The Seared #1 Grade Ahi Tuna with mixed greens, mango, avocado and honey-lime vinaigrette was also delicious.  Perfectly seared Ahi tuna, the vinaigrette was refreshing. The House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches were amazing!  It comes in a decadent chocolate sauce, and along with a bit of whipped cream, the French vanilla ice cream coupled with the Oreo cookie crumbs ended our night on a high note. Only thing I would not recommend is the Iron Skillet Cornbread.  It was dry, but was much better once you request and spread the butter. AMBIENCE: Some live music, dimmed lights... Average noise level.  We can hold our conversation just fine.  Mostly business / travelers, very few children if any.  However, our toddler had a great time as well! Loved it!

I originally wanted the butternut enchiladas. But it wasn't specified on the menu that there was chicken in it.

Ask for a side of spicy mayo and live the vida loca! On a serious note, Bandera's service could not be better.

(None of that ""you can only order easy crappy food from the deep fryer"" business).  Awesome bartenders!  The grilled artichoke with remoulade was amazing - smokey, charred, smooth. And fun to eat, if you know what you're doing (which I do - mom is 100% Maltese, so I ate a lot of artichokes growing up).  I ordered the veggie burger - which may sound boring, but you'd be very mistaken to overlook this item. Oh. My. God.  I've had horrible veggie burgers that taste like the corn we used to feed our hogs, thinly veiled with a few sad bits of onion and carrot. And I've had some pretty good veggie burgers - hearty, substantial, crispy edges, savory. The kind that doesn't leave you with buyer's/diner's remorse.  But this, this is in a class all by itself.  So, technically it is a veggie burger.  I suspect some sort of sorcery going on. This thing is so damned good.  The patty is delicious. Wearing its sweet soy glaze, it sits regally atop a bed of crisp lettuce, holding court over fresh sliced tomatoes and cold, crisp dill pickle chips. I couldn't figure out the cheese, and was too embarrassed to ask what it was, but I can tell you it was pure goodness. Provolone, I think. Melty and gooey.  And the bun- a beautiful, golden sesame seed bun, sweet and firm. A perfect choice.  All of this is paired with a delicious kale salad with peanut vinegarette. Awesome pairing, as it is light and zesty and perfectly offsets the burger.   A great meal, with live jazz that was neither overpowering nor overpowered by the ambient noise.

2014-05-02,3.0,"For the last five years this has been my go-to restaurant in Chicago.  I probably ate here once a week.  I probably should have written a 5-star review over the past five years, but I never did. Now, unfortunately, I am having to write a 3-star review because over the last six months or so our experience (and I usually go with the same person) has really slipped.  In our minds, the place used to be perfect.  Every dish was so good, and the service was perfect.  When I used to tell other locals about it they would sometimes wrinkle their noses and say ""but it's a chain.""  Yes, yes, I'd say, just go.  And then they'd come back saying they loved it. So what's changed?  Atmosphere and service are the biggest changes.  Food ha also slipped a little, but not a lot.   Atmosphere: The music has gotten louder over the years.  I love the live band as long as I'm not too close and and I can still have a conversation.  All you had to do to make that happen was just not sit too close to the band.  Now, however, they are pumping the music through speakers around the restaurant and it is much more difficult to have a conversation. Also, the training for the waiters was extensive and the service was always 5-star.  I couldn't care less if we had a few bad nights over the past six months, but it's been worse than that.  Now I simply would rate their service 3.5 stars overall. The food is still good.  Years ago they had one of the best dishes in Chicago (the Poke Tuna), but they took it off the menu.  Even after taking it off the menu I would still rate the place 5-star, but now I would rate the food 3.75 star.  I have gone from a big smile over their food to a shoulder shrug. Bandera is always very crowded and noisy.  But I put up with that and called it five star based on the food and service.   The reason I am giving this a 3-star rating is because the items that have to be right to make up for the noise are no longer right, and the food has slipped.  And to top it all off they have turned up the volume on the band so that it is now very difficult to escape the noise. Bring the band volume way down and I'll change my rating to 4-star.  The problem is that I used to go here once a week at least.  Now I'm going once every 8-10 weeks.  If they fix the problems I've mentioned and I can see that for three visits in a row, then I'll write a new review.  But if I have a bad experience in my next visit then I probably won't return for another six months.  And then my next trip would be my last.",0.9803,0.815,0.115,0.07,0.4059381187288164

2014-04-27,5.0,"In 2005, when I was visiting Chicago while still an itinerant technologist for my old employer, I had a free evening for dinner, and ended up at Bandera on Michigan Avenue at the recommendation of the concierge at the hotel. Sense memory is a funny thing, overall, you've got a set of neural pathways that remind you how something tastes, and it's like an instant flashback to that moment.  Like that. Wham. You're down the rabbit hole and out in your memory space. That's Bandera. So we walked in tonight, and I ordered what I always order: the prime rib sandwich. It's a french dip, with horseradish on the side, and fries. The prime rib is perfectly medium rare, cut in slices so thin they meld together into an amazing whole. The bun it's served on is buttery and slick without being greasy or slippery.  That first bite is a bit like heaven. The roll, the steak, the horseradish, the au jus, it all comes together in this nuanced moment where time stops and only your taste buds are taking in sensory data. I'm fairly sure I was blind there for the first 5 seconds. The fries are a light and crisp accompaniment, but neither add to nor detract from the rest of the sandwich. The sandwich is the star here, and the supporting act will not be getting a contract. We began tonight with their duo of dips, a fresh guacamole, and a spicy cheese spread, that were an excellent rejoinder to the Old Fashioned from the bar. While the drink was sweet, the existential nature of the bourbon and the bitters more than held their own with the simple syrup, and the house-made preserved cherry. Our second round of drinks was a Sazerac (for me) and a Manhattan (for Tiff) and they were as good as I've had in all of DC, and would not have been strangers at a place like The Passenger or The Gibson. The Sazerac was particularly well-balanced, using Templeton to set off the absinthe, and the Peychaud's was not overpowering. Dessert we sadly could not stay and savor, as Charlie was beginning to get riled, but we took away their Banana Creme Pie, and it was every bit as good as I remembered, with about a banana and a half in each slice, as well as some excellent chocolate and house-made smoky caramel sauce. The thing about memory is that it can betray you. You may remember something being better than it actually is. I can happily say that no such thing happened tonight at Bandera, where the food was every bit as good (if not better!) than it was a decade ago, and where the drinks have raised their game.  Go.

The bar, IMO, lacked personality in regards to service. Yes, they provided exactly what I requested in terms of food BUT usually when you opt to sit at a bar there is some interaction/conversation with the bartender, in this case it was all transactional.

2013-12-28,5.0,"As restaurant groups/chains go, Hillstone has got to be one of the best. I always have a great experience at their restaurants, and last night at Bandera was no exception.  Normally, when I'm traveling I make it a point to eat at local places that I won't have the chance to try anywhere else, but last night I got into town, checked into my hotel, was starving, and there was Bandera, right next door. Our party of six walked in without a reservation, and were quoted a wait time of about 30 minutes. Turns out it was way longer than that becaue the table we were waiting on lingered for about an hour after paying their check. The hostess was fantastic--kept us updated on their progress while we had drinks at the bar. We were not in a rush, but she ended up comp'ing us two appetizers because of the longer-than-expected wait. Super nice. While we waited, I sipped a Vesper (North Shore gin, Grey Goose vodka, Lillet Blanc, and nothing else). Whew! Not for the faint of heart, but if you like boozy drinks, it was delicious.  Once we finally made it to our table, which was a great location in the corner, near the live jazz music, they brought our appetizers, which were wonderful. The spinach dip wasn't anything fancy, but was really, really good (served with salsa and sour cream), and the smoked salmon with remoulade and brioche toast points was amazing. It was a big piece of salmon (not thinly sliced), and was smoky and salty and really delicious. The remoulade was the perfect counterpoint. Our server was great--helpful, friendly, and there when we needed her. Since we're big on sharing, I was able to munch on a few different entrees. First, the Macho Salad. Once of my very favorite salads ever. It's beautiful, and super flavorful--mixed greens studded with big chunks of avocado, Bandera's famous roasted chicken, and goat cheese, and sprinkled with chopped almonds, corn, and bites of sweet, chewy dates. So. Delicious. House-made Veggie Burger (with sweet soy glaze and jack cheese) was decent, but not amazing. I probably wouldn't order it again. The patty looked like raw meat (beets, I'm guessing?), which is a bit off-putting in a veggie burger, and not particularly delicious or flavorful. It was served with an Emerald Kale Salad, which was really nice--the kale was chopped pretty finely, so wasn't a textural issue. Butternut White Cheddar Enchilada is always good. It's slightly sweet from the squash, but balanced by the enchilada sauce. The Mexico City Rice is great, and I'm not usually into that sort of thing. It's surprisngly spicy. The Escabéche is cucumber, sliced carrot, red onion, and avocado--really crisp and fresh--and is a great complement to the enchilada and rice. I've eaten at Bandera restaurants before, but this was my first time having the Iron Skillet Cornbread. It will not be my last. Sweet and buttery, but savory from the green chiles and cheese. Great texture, wonderful flavor. Maybe I need to start a list of favorite cornbread. This would definitely be at the top. Banana Cream Pie. We ordered one slice to share, and probably could have finished off four. The crust is amazing. I couldn't identify quite what was in it--maybe house-made graham crackers? It's thick and chunky and super flavorful. They top it with pudding (vanilla, I think, not artificially-flavored banana), then whipped cream (not too sweet), big slices of fresh banana, grated dark chocolate, and caramel sauce. It's really the best banana cream pie. I was going to give Bandera four stars, but I just decided to up it to 5 based on the number of times I've called something ""my favorite"" or ""the best [fill in the blank] I've had"" in this review. But the pie. It's this amazing medley of flavors and textures.  Not too sweet, so you feel like you could eat it forever.

Service is exceptional, and if you have a food allergy, they will steer you to safe menu items, which I always appreciate. I decided to order the grilled chicken salad, sans peanut sauce, and it was quite delicious. In fact, it reminded me of a very similar dish I've often eaten at my local Atlanta Houston's restaurant. Which is not so surprising, as both Bandera and Houston's are run by the same parent company, Hillstone Restaurant Group. I normally avoid chain restaurants when traveling, but Bandera did not feel like a corporate chain in the least.

It should be noted that the wait ended up being only a half an hour or so, and this was at around 6:45-7 on a Saturday night. If you want to take your date here, the mood is phenomenal. Live, upbeat jazz combo of piano, bass, and light drums are great for the atmosphere. Each table is candlelit, and that's pretty much the only significant light source near most tables, besides a few very soft wall mounted light fixtures. There is a lot of wood and dark leather, which furthers the cozy, romantic feel, but it's definitely a loud enough place that it won't feel overbearing to your date, but will still have that ""hey, this is a nice place"" feel. Oh, and if it matters, no tablecloths. Dress is pretty much anything goes, but to really match the restaurant, look good. Jackets are not needed, and might be a little too dressy; jeans can be worn with a classy top. I'd recommend no shorts or sandals in warmer months, too. Now, food. My date ordered the rotisserie chicken, and I the salmon (I don't remember the specific menu names, but it's a fairly small menu, so you can figure that out on your own). The food was FANTASTIC. Full of flavor, but not crazy, and large enough portions that won't have you leaving feeling unsatisfied. I haven't tried the rest of the menu yet, but I assume it's just as spectacular. The wait staff and hostesses were very accommodating and friendly, which always helps. My only complaint is the pricing, but a place like this on the Magnificent Mile, I wasn't exactly expecting a cheap meal, anyways. Still, if you come here, bring more than two $20 bills.

Overall, I have no complaints and everything was 'good' or 'great.' You should eat here. Here are my highlights. Bandera's service is excellent. No one does service as well as Hillstone Restaurant group. No one. From the moment you walk in the door, you are treated like a millionaire at a high-end eatery. You will never have to wait for an item or look for the server. The staff know every food item, every preparation method and can help you decide among the menu items, if you'd like. They have live jazz music at night! LIVE! A real, human band! Not canned crappy muzak. I could not believe it. Nothing makes you feel more like a big shot than bringing a client to a place and getting sat next to a band. It's like the 1940s. Granted, I am a jazz lover, but I cannot imagine anyone not loving real, live music in Chicago. This alone is worth the price of the food and is so unusual that I will be returning again and again just for this single feature.

We were seated in a surprisingly comfortable booth and Trey, our server, greeted us right away. We knew what we wanted immediately...we HAD been looking at the menu for an hour. We skipped appetizers, though they were tempting, and went right for entrees (hoping to have room for dessert). I ordered the butternut and white cheddar enchilada with roasted corn on the cob and green rice. My husband ordered the barbecue beef back ribs with mashed potatoes and roasted corn on the cob. The food came out rather quickly and looked and smelled wonderful. The roasted corn on the cob was perfectly charred and lightly coated with a mildly spiced butter...it was excellent.  The green rice was delicious; perfectly prepared, light, fluffy and flavorful. Far too often rice ordered from a restaurant is dried out and tasteless but this rice was seriously good.  My enchilada was really, really flavorful. There was a bit of heat to it that required several extra sips of iced tea, but they were delicious. My husband told me his food was excellent and how glad he was we ended up eating there. We both easily finished our food as the portions were just right and we eagerly ordered their house-made Oreo ice cream sandwiches for dessert. It was amazingly good....order it! Trey was attentive and thoughtful and helped make our dinner that much better. Yes, the restaurant attracts tourists due to the location, but so do dozens of other restaurants. The most important thing is that the food and the service at Bandera are both wonderful and we would absolutely eat there again....as a first choice!",0.9971,0.803,0.189,0.008,0.6346753246753247

We ended the meal sharing the banana cream pie.  The ""pie"" came out more like a pile of graham cracker crust pieces, banana pudding and chunks of banana.  The ""cream"" tasted like a pudding mix and it was not the most aesthetically pleasing dish.   Overall, service was great and we did get a table over looking the Mag Mile, which was definitely a bonus as the rest of the restaurant is rather dark.",0.995,0.762,0.226,0.012,0.6088666666666667

My latest visit has to have been the worst thus far. I've been coming to this place pretty regularly for a couple years. Obviously the menu is going to change. The removal of the Tuna Poke app was a sad day. But I digress.  When we arrived I wasn't expecting a wait but they said 5-10 minutes which wasn't bad. However the table we sat at was set and ready from the time we walked in the door and until the time we were seated. I'm not entirely sure what the wait was for.  My party ordered two prime rib sandwiches which I would normally recommend. Today it was by far off the mark. The prime rib was overcooked and when it arrived the meat was cold but the bread was hot. Something I didn't mind, but it was clearly medium well. One of the other persons in my party had to send theirs back as it was cold and overcooked as well. When it came back out, it seemed as if they just heated up the prime rib in lieu of a fresh sandwich. Mind you this was 2:30 on a Thursday. It was not busy nor was the place packed. In my opinion there's no reason the sandwiches should have been overcooked and cold.  I'm not sure if this is a timing error on the kitchen staff or an error with the expediter. Another note is that the ""special"" soup while its good, doesn't change ever.  The server was the best part of the experience as she made sure to make sure we were accommodated and apologized profusely for the errors.

I was a little unsure at first approach since there's a sign on the door stating that proper attire is required. Mind you, I'm not gonna roll up to a classy joint looking like I just got tossed out of the blender, but you know, I'm a casual dresser (jeans, t-shirt, hoodie, occasional baseball hat) and there was a line in the dress code alerting me that ""hats must be removed in the dining room."" Yeah, I'm wearing a hat. Not a problem, I'll belly up to the bar. I ordered their signature Manhattan - well actually I ordered the Old Fashioned, but got the signature Manhattan instead. It's ok, because it was a fantastic cocktail and has a unique twist that /I will leave up to you to discover. I also have to give a shout out to the Kitchen in the round -- No clowning/yelling/crazy kitchen shenanigans to be had - just professional food prep/creation. After savoring the cocktail, I inquired with the bartender about the rotisserie chicken, which I've heard nothing but rave reviews about and then asked about the rotisserie lamb sandwich (yes, you read right).  The bartender put things in perspective for me, which I find incredibly helpful when at a new place and explained that, while both are very good, the lamb sammie is going to be more of a signature offering. SOLD! The sandwich came out just as the attentive bartender  was bringing me a Bell's Oberon. First off, the lamb was thin-sliced and was accompanied with a cup of au jus (I love au jus). On the sandwich was roasted red peppers and arugula as well as a some kind of possibly horseradish mayo. I took one half, dipped the end in the au jus and enjoyed what was to be the first of many tasty bites. The lamb wasn't the least bit gamy, nor was it chewy. The au jus just enhanced the flavor of the meat and softened the bread so it all just melted in your mouth. There was also an accompaniment of Bandera's legendary peanut/sprout/cilantro slaw. Needless to say, I had one of the finest meals to be had in a while.  I wish the price wasn't quite as steep as it was, but hey, it's the Mag Mile, so what do you expect?

2013-04-19,4.0,"Bandera is not the usual kind of place I go to eat.  Typically I like places that are local, trendy, blah blah blah.  But Bandera is always an enjoyable place to go.  I have been to Houston's a few times, both in TX and when there was one in Chicago.  Bandera is pretty similar in terms of ambience, but perhaps their food leans a little more global in terms of flavors. I think they have an excellent house-made veggie burger, which is pretty much the same as Houston's.  I will say the burger is a bit expensive, especially since it's veggie, but it has a nice, smoky flavor from the wood fire and that's not common for a veggie burger.  I also love the sweet-salty flavor.  I have also tried several of their side dishes and they're all good.  I love the escabeche and the cole slaw especially.  The escabeche is a really flavorful mixture of a ton of veggies, including avocado.  There are so many that I can't really remember exactly what else is in there, but it's crunchy, creamy and fresh.  Yum.  The cole slaw is really crunchy with peanuts and the combination with the cilantro gives a slight nod to southeast Asia.  It is one of my favorite cole slaws ever.  My husband and I will sometimes go and split a main dish, such as the veggie burger or the butternut squash enchiladas (also delicious) and then order a couple of side dishes to share.  It's the perfect amount of food for when we're hungry, but not ravenous. Service is always very nice and professional here.  It's a good, comfortable place to bring a date, your parents, or friends who may not been into the whole trendy dining scene (that's what I have done, and they like it).  Some folks are not that adventurous with food, and the food here is not all that adventurous.  Yes, it's a chain.  And yes, it's kind of suburbany, vaguely global American food.  But it is good, so who cares?  My tastebuds sure don't. Seems like there's always a wait if you don't have a reservation, so book ahead if you don't like lines.  Otherwise you can always try your luck with bar seating.",0.9986,0.723,0.25,0.027,0.5562777777777776

My Old Fashioned cocktail to start was well-mixed and delicious, and our server was attentive but not pushy. The background music was soft and enjoyable, and we definitely did not have to compete with it to enjoy our meal.

The burger was really really good BUT I found a hair in my fries, which really just kills my appetite and I should've just asked for my money back and left, but I didn't. I let the waitress know that a hair was in my fries, she apologized and brought out a new plate of fries. Don't get me wrong, this is an honest mistake, it's completely gross, but it happens.

We did not have reservations, so we were fine waiting an hour before a table opened up for four. My friends enjoyed drinks + a bottle of wine from the bar and we could lean on a sort of window sill (minus the window) protruding from the wall because every seat at the bar was taken. We were seated and enjoyed the corn bread for our appetizer while perusing the menu. This corn bread was delicious and a little more savory than store-bought cornbread I've had. The portion is generous, so we boxed up half of it for leftovers. My mouth is watering thinking about it now! I definitely advise you try the cornbread if you come here. The waitress described the vegetarian options for us when asked and even though I was the only vegetarian, another member of our party thought it sounded so delicious that we both ordered the veggie burger. The burger was heavenly and unlike any veggie burger I have ever tasted. This veggie burger put all others I've had to shame! As if that was not overwhelmingly delicious enough, the roasted peanut coleslaw completely knocked it out of the park. If possible, I almost enjoyed it more than the burger. My dining companions were equally impressed with their meals. The server was very friendly and very apologetic when she accidentally brought us the wrong check. Our waters were re-filled twice during the evening and we felt that we were attended to. The server was also very familiar with the menu and gave us thoughtful, personal and personalized suggestions. After all my raving about the food, I have not even gotten to the atmosphere! The ambiance is my favorite: warm, cozy, romantic, dimly lit, trendy-ish, with LIVE JAZZ MUSIC. The jazz music sealed the deal: I love this place.  Overall, I had an incredible experience at Bandera and it makes me question that a few of the other five-star reviews I wrote deserved it!

2013-02-15,2.0,"I hate to write a bad review, since overall it would have been a nice dinner. Based on other reviews saying this would be great for a date or romantic occasion, I came here with my partner for Valentine's Day.  We went early to avoid any rush, got seated about 4:45pm.  I had the Seared Ahi Tuna and my partner had the Pan Roasted Scottish Salmon and we shared the Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches.  The food was good (though small portions and expensive) and the staff seemed professional and polite.  So far so good, but what turned the experience entirely uncomfortable was that they were in a big hurry to get us out of there. Our server, Kallie, brought out the check at 5:32pm when the dessert arrived, a bit surprising which by itself might not have been an issue, but it was the first hint that they wanted us out of there.  We paid at 5:39pm (according to the receipts), and were continuing to chat for a couple minutes when Kallie, whizzing by very quickly, took the receipt/tip plate, moving really fast and making us feel rushed... okay, another hint.  Another couple minutes go by and she swoops in, tries to grab our glasses/pitcher but almost knocks them over - embarrassing for everyone, she collects herself and our glasses and is on her way. This is the first time I've ever felt unwanted at a restaurant, and I had to consider why... Maybe it was Valentine's day and they were busy (but when we left, we noticed there were tables open, and no one waiting at the door), maybe she didn't like her tip (19% cash tip? that was more than fair, but after the way we were treated I wanted it back), or maybe we were dawdling too much (but we were there for under an hour)... the only other reason we could come up with was that she didn't like that we tried to save money by not ordering appetizers/drinks/wine (thus reducing our bill but her tip too)?  Apparently don't come here with a date unless you're planning to splurge beyond just a meal and dessert. It seems unthinkable but I don't see any valid reason for rushing us.  It was rude and inappropriate, especially for a special occasion.",-0.3908,0.86,0.069,0.071,0.5244530244530247

This seems like a great place for a date actually. I loved the live Jazz Music (who doesn't love live music!?). Even when they played it wasn't too loud so you could still have a conversation. I had already checked out the Menu before arriving and read many reviews...so I knew I had to taste the corn bread! Definitely get the corn bread! Four of us were seated at a booth. We all ordered different entrees (Salmon, Cheeseburger, Rotisserie chicken, and I ordered the Enchiladas). Personally, I think the menu should have a few more options (vegetarian options). I was surprised to see only 1 enchilada on my plate..along with a veggie mix that I did not like and the rice (yum)...but I do have to say it was delicious! It had two sauces...and wow they were both great. I finished that enchilada in no time. Then I realized that I was actually full! The Enchilada had cheese and squash and potato inside...very different. Now i am not sure if it was worth $19 . Now I am not a cheap person but definitely not worth the price for just one enchilada! Everyone else seemed like their meal. Chicken was also very good (you can tell it is a popular dish), but once again you feel you are paying for the location versus the food.

The service was poor. Our waitress was nice when she was around, but didn't stop by to check on our food or refill our drinks at any time, so I had a single glass of water until I flagged down a busser for a refill. I think what REALLY got me the most mad about her was that my bill was $39 and change, I put down 3 $20 bills. Obviously I want the third $20 broken so I can tip! She brings back 2 $10s. Seriously? You think I'm tipping you over 20% for never being around and making me flag down a busser for water? You're out of your mind, lady.  Luckily my lady had some $1s and she got a much more appropriate tip. Her response to the 2 $10s was, ""It's a good thing I've got some $1s, otherwise we'd have to wait for her to come back so she could break one of those.""

2012-11-06,4.0,"Recommendations: -- Appetizers: Spinach & Artichoke Dip -- Entrees: Rotisserie Chicken, Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich -- Dessert: Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich  Tips: -- Expect a 30-40 minute wait for dinner on weekends (make a reservation!!)  -- Live jazz pianist!  -- Lounge-type atmosphere, dimly lit, classy & upscale -- Bar seating is full menu and open seating Review: I didn't realize this at first, but Bandera is one of the restaurants owned by the Hillstone Restaurant Group. Hillstone also owns and operates a couple of other nice restaurants I've been to around SoCal - R+D Restaurant, Gulfstream, and Houston's, as well as Rutherford Grill in Napa Valley. Bandera's menu was very similar, if not identical, to Rutherford Grill's menu, as I imagine most of their restaurants have somewhat similar menus. This was good for me because I absolutely loved the food at Rutherford Grill.  Located in downtown Chicago, on the Saturday night before the annual Chicago Marathon, we knew we were going to have a hard time getting into dinner at ANY of the restaurants within the downtown Chicago radius. Bandera had the shortest wait (which was about 45 minutes), so we waited it out. By the time we were seated, we were all starving, so the food tasted even better.  We started with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip, which was served with tortilla chips and was absolutely delicious! We ran out of chips pretty quickly, but luckily our waitress was attentive and brought us more right away. For the main course, my friend and I both ordered the Rotisserie Chicken, which came with Mexican rice, for $22. I thought the chicken was flavored perfectly and extremely delicious, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the Mexican rice, unfortunately. At Rutherford Grill, the chicken was served with mashed potatoes, which I thought worked a lot better. You will definitely have leftovers, so consider splitting the dish if you aren't that hungry. My other friend got the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich with fries for $20, and she said it was really good. She was also able to save half for later. We didn't have enough room for dessert at that point, but I would recommend the Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich from when I had it at Rutherford Grill. They also have a large selection of drinks, wine and cocktails, and a bar area with a full menu that is first come/first serve seating, so you can try looking for a seat there instead of waiting for a table.   Overall, I'm a fan of the food and atmosphere at Bandera, but it is a little on the pricier side if you're on a budget. Appetizers are $8-13, and main dishes average out at about $17-22. Besides what we ordered, they also have salads, sandwiches, fish and salmon dishes, steak and BBQ ribs. The atmosphere is pretty classy and upscale, with a jazz pianist playing in the corner, and it is pretty dimly lit so it would be good place for an intimate evening or somewhere to just come with friends.",0.9983,0.802,0.174,0.023,0.5697142857142857

The seared tuna salad with mango and avocado presented mouthwatering ingredients at the peak of their freshness.  The greens were coated with just a bit too much dressing.  The a la carte enchilada with shredded chicken and spinach-- doused in two sauces-- understands that when contrasting flavors are this good, they must be included in the same dish.Every entrée I observed and every scent I smelled looked to be something I could and would enjoy.  The staff was courteous, and though bartenders often had to be flagged down, they were cheerful and accommodating when you could get their attention.

The taste of the beef was wonderful, but it was a little overcooked for my taste; they did not ask how I would for it to be done, but maybe it's because it comes in little strips.

(I later found out that there are only 5 Bandera's nationwide, the other 3 are in California)  We went early on a Wed night as the mag mile was crowded being the week between Christmas and New Years.  We were seated right away at a table overlooking Mich Ave, very nice!  The food was very similar to my experiences at their Scottsdale location.  We ordered the cornbread skillet as an appetizer, I had the rottiserie chicken with mexican rice.  My kids split one of the cheeseburgers (which is more of a long steak-type burger on a half loaf roll).  The food quality was excellent, everything was served promptly and hot.  Our server was very friendly, but she did leave us unattended for a long period at one point.  Otherwise, it was a good meal.  If I had a Bandera near my home, it would be my 'go to' restaurant for a consistently good meal.  For now, I'll have to catch ithem when I'm on the road.  On our way out the door, (7:30ish) the waiting line had grown to about 30 people hanging out in a walled off area to the side of the seating.  Looked like it was a long wait if you didn't have reservations.",0.9736,0.889,0.106,0.005,0.5654587079587079

2011-12-19,4.0,"The food here was great!  Went with my boyfriend for an impromptu dinner on a sunday night.  There was a bit of a wait, so we sat at the bar for some drinks and had the queso dip to start.  It was not a gooey cheese like you would expect, but a cold dip served with warm tortilla chips.  The crunch of the fresh jalapeno mixed with the chilled cheddar was amazing - a great texture and different spin on Queso. The wait for our table was quite a bit longer than what we were told, but once we were seated our waitress was very sweet and not overly attentive - and the food was just amazing!  We ordered the mac & cheese, which by the time our waitress got back around to us after it had been dropped off, asked if we had not received it, but ashamed by our piggyness had to confess it was gone in about 2 minutes.  We then split the Seared Sashimi Tuna Salad which we both would have been happy had we each ordered this as our entree.  Great flavors and just the right amount of fat left on the tuna.  For our entree we split the prime rib which is HUGE and cooked perfectly, but ended up taking much of it home and having to pass on dessert seeing that we were completely stuffed. I will definitely be going back.",0.9948,0.782,0.197,0.021,0.6036688311688313

Once upstairs, you are treated to the perfect combination of mood lighting, the buzz of conversation, and light jazz. Tons of people are usually crowded around the large bar eating and drinking. Definitely make reservations.  The service is great, and they are very attentive. The wine and martinis are a delicious start, as well as the spinach artichoke dip. I just tried the queso dip for the first time and it's delish - spicy! The food is what I'd call American with a twist or ""Modern American."" For example, the croutons on the Caesar salad are cornbread croutons, and the mac and cheese appetizer is made out of mostaccoli. The veggie burger is the winner here. Large and juicy, and just as good as any cheeseburger. However, I was not impressed by the fries at all. Too skinny and too salty.

I would have loved it except that they left the skin on the peppers. It gave it this weird texture. The first couple bites I thought I was eating some kind of plastic paper.

I got the fish sandwich as my main, with a side of peanut coleslaw.   Damn!  that's a good fish sandwich- and I got two types of coleslaw, which were both great! I need to find a recipe for this peanut slaw, because that was a fresh take on coleslaw that is not chock full of mayo. My coworker got a soup (I believe it was French onion) and the macho salad, which looked delicious and she was very happy with.  Definitely will have to try this on another visit.

Like Superman. Well, this Jimmy Olsen definitely got the blues on his last visit to Bandera. Everything was all over the place. Despite coming on an uncharacteristically sparse Saturday, it took a while to be seated. Once we were seated, it took a while to get a server. Once we got a server, it took a while to get some water. Once we got some water... you see where this is going (ie nowhere good). Once we finally received service, it was inattentive at best. I had to have my meal brought out three times because the first two times my order was wrong. Yes, you read that correctly: my order was screwed up twice. The first time, I was brought the wrong dish entirely. The second time I was brought the correct dish but with ingredients different from what I requested. By the time the dish came around for the third time, I'd lost my appetite and my patience. Figuring that I should eat *something*, I decided to dig into my sandwich. The bread didn't hold up well to the ingredients and fell apart midway through. I finished the sandwich with a knife and fork. Well, that is until I saw that it has mayonnaise on it. Despite not saying that the sandwich came with mayo on the menu and specifically asking about and requesting it not come near my meal, there it was. The proverbial strike three. The last straw was the bill. Nothing was comped. There was no apology from the server or manager. Our server simply asked if we needed anything else, dropped the bill off and left me to pay $50+ for a wholly unsatisfying (nay, disastrous) meal. Superman has left the building.",-0.5535,0.899,0.046,0.055,0.4381448412698414

The staff gave us complimentary corn bread as soon as we sat down since we had to wait a little while.  The menu is pretty heavy on the meat, and I didn't feel like ordering flesh that night so I got the veggie burger. I was not expecting anything special, but this was possibly the best veggie burger I've ever had. (The only one I could compare it to is at a restaurant called North Star in Columbus, OH -- the two burgers may be tied. And I have eaten a LOT of veggie burgers (and meat burgers) in my life). The veggie burger was $15 and came with an interesting (and tasty) peanut coleslaw. The veggie burger was enormous (if I didn't share it with other people I probably could have cut it in half and saved some for lunch the next day). Due to the size and deliciousness of the burger and the fact that dinner was accompanied by live jazz, I feel that my money was well spent.  Most of the other items on the menu are out of my price range, but I went back on a Sunday night (so I could get another veggie burger!) with my boyfriend. We were seated immediately. Our food came almost too quickly because we hardly had any time to sip on our drinks before they brought our plates out. My boyfriend shared a few bites of his prime rib with me, and it was cooked to perfection.  It came with gravy, mashed potatoes, and a rich sour cream.

Then we sat down and our server came over, who was very enthusiastic and polite (my complain is definitely all about the food here). She told us the specials, one of which was a sea bass. My boyfriend ordered that and I had the chicken and spinach enchiladas.  Our food came both of which were served with the exact same sides, which lack a little creativity in my mind. The enchilada was ok, nothing great. The sea bass might have been the most overcooked piece of fish I have ever seen.

Tip before you go:  Definitely have a reservation and when you call to make it, get the name of the nearby parking garage where you get discounted rates.  We did both of these and it made for a stress free night.   The restaurant itself is very sleek and beautiful.  The bathrooms are a delight.  Our server was perky and good.  The lighting and conversation level were perfect. After that is where my conflicted feelings came in.  It's named Bandera, Spanish for flag and it's listed as traditional American.  They have chickens on spits when you come in but are sortof a steak house?  With Mexican type sauces on things, sushi grade tuna with avocado and tortilla chips as the appetizer?  The menu is so small, how can it be so unclear what type of restaurant this is? The tuna poke appetizer would have been better without the avocado, make it more of a straight up ceviche.  But it was tasty enough.  My lamb was good, a more than generous portion that I had requested with the sauce on the side.  I tasted the sauce and it was just plain awful, so glad I had it on the side.  The cucumber salad was a jumble of flavors that just didn't match the dish at all and I hate it when hot food and cold food are all on the same plate.   When the food is plated usually  one temperature will suffer and sure enough the potatoes were good but lukewarm at best.  We split the cold asparagus which was delicious. They have two dessert options and we chose the banana cream pie which was bland except where they heavily sprinkled the cocoa powder, that gave it a bitter flavor.  Added to the soggy crust, I was very disappointed.  Should have tried the Oreo dessert. We entered full of anticipation and left vaguely let down.  Darn it, I had thought it would be a favorite.",0.9847,0.776,0.151,0.073,0.5637966039128831

Live jazz can be one of those things that sounds better on paper than it is in person, as the music CAN be obtrusive... But tonight it was the perfect addition to a great meal.  Three of us dined, and we had the French Dip, the ""Hacked"" chicken salad, and the roasted chicken with green rice (think steamed rice with cilantro, Chipotle style, not mold).  My dining companions thoroughly enjoyed their meals, and I thoroughly enjoyed stealing the hand-cut fries that came with the sandwich, and tastes of the rice & chicken with the other dish. Both were great! My salad was large enough to be filling, yet light enough so that I had room for dessert. The salad had mixed greens along with pulled rotisserie chicken pieces, corn, tortilla strips, and a light honey-lemon-peanut dressing. In general I'm not much of a salad guy... But tonight I planned on being a DESSERT guy so I wanted to be sure I had room. Anyway, I've had really bad salads before--which, for me, means way too much dressing--but this one passed the test. Initially I came in with the idea of getting the homemade Oreo ice-cream sandwich dessert, but was swayed to get a special item not on the menu -- key lime pie. I think my slice of pie constituted a full 1/4 of the entire pie, and it was fantastic. I'm a bit of a key-lime fanatic, and this pie was light as it should be. The crust contained some chopped walnuts, which wasn't my favorite, but it was very well done...especially for the Midwest.  Finally, our waiter Scott was top-notch. He was pleasant & attentive, and refills ended up at the table without request just as the last drops were consumed.

Props to other yelpers! The peanut cole slaw. One of the most delicious heaps of food I've ever tasted in my life. I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw, but the crunch of the peanuts sold me.  I went back for their corn bread and fish sandwich. I subbed out the fries for broccoli. Bad idea. The broccoli wasn't cooked thoroughly, so it was a bit stringy around the stem. I tried the fries off my friend's plate - they're shoestring fries which I liked. I kept sneaking my hand over for more. The cornbread was really good. It was definitely more savory than sweet with bits of pepper. The crust was my favorite part by far.  Their this and thats (aka apps) were pretty big as well. If you don't have a big appetite and wanted to conserve your money you could definitely get full off of two dishes.  The decor and ambience of the restaurant was really nice - dark, wooden over tones with low lighting. I loved their round tables for five. I adored their glasses - one had an etching of a mosquito near the rim!  Bathrooms - very clean. Very modern. I wouldn't expect less. The design of their stalls were pretty unique.  All in all, Bandera was a really solid restaurant in a sea of really good restaurants.",0.9986,0.67,0.309,0.021,0.5617521367521368
2011-05-15,3.0,"Bandera hands down use to be one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. I always get the same thing: a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, the artichoke, the grilled fish sandwich with fries and the Oreo dessert.  A night at Bandera meant I would be going home directly after, sliding on my fat pants and passing out on my couch five minutes after walking in my door. This had been my experience every single time  - until this Friday.  The mood was light and energetic -I was with my boyfriend and another couple and we were all anxious as we were sat at our table and began to order our favorite dishes on the menu as we have done time after time. None of us needed the menu as we all knew  our favorite dishes by heart. As I ordered my usuals, the mood suddenly changed as the waitress informed me that my fish sammy was no longer on the menu. I glanced down in horror as she was correct - it was nowhere to be found.  Granted, there are many good items at Bandera, but being a pescatarian there are limited options. The Bandera fish sandwich has to this day been my favorite sandwich in Chicago. Every bite was perfect - I never left a crumb on my plate. From the pickle, to lettuce and tomato and fresh grilled taste of the fish itself - i was in heaven with every savory morsel.  Friday night I felt like Oprah without her favorite things, Ryan Seacrest without his hair gel, Paula Abdul without her medication. This was my staple item and it had been ripped away from me with no explanation! No notice! Couldn't they have put something on the menu to let us know ahead of time? A girl needs to prepare herself for such a loss! I wasn't going to starve, so I ordered the veggie burger instead. Of course,  I did speak with the manager to let him know my frustrations. He did give our table a free dessert which was great - but still did not make up for the death of my delicious fish sammy!  So.. Chicagoans and people of the mile that is Magnificent.. this i ask of you. PLEASE HELP US GET THE BANDERA FISH SAMMY BACK!! Call Bandera - write reviews - but please HELP!

From outside it's above the ground so you have no idea what to expect. But this place is awesome. You walk in and it's a dim and elegant atmosphere. On saturdays there is live Jazz and the group that was playing when I was there (not sure if they change up) was great. As I was looking through reviews and tips on Foursquare I realized that people like their cornbread A LOT and decided to try it. OMG! It's SOO GOOD! Then I had their signature salad, the one with dates and avocado in it, and it was delicious. I don't live in Chicago therefore my perception on cheap/expensive may be misleading but it's a upper scale menu, so you make your own judgement on that. I sat by the windows and watched the Michigan Avenue the entire time. To me, even when you are alone, it's a great time... Would I go back? Yes but not a lot with those prices :) I hear their burgers are great too. Whether you are alone or with a date, it's a great place to be.

2011-04-28,2.0,"I hadn't been to Bandera for a couple years and undoubtedly the food is still pretty good but the prices are becoming exorbitant and I was not impressed with the service on my recent visit.  To start with, it would have been nice to have a menu that shows what they are actually serving - instead when I tried to place an order for the blackened/grilled fish sandwich with peanut coleslaw from the menu I was told that ""the menu is changing"" and now the fish sandwich includes fried fish (grouper) and is served with fries.  Okay, I am a huge fan of grouper so I decided to try it out and requested their amazing peanut coleslaw instead of fries (surprisingly, this was provided without an additional charge).  It would have been nice, however, to know that the ""new"" fish sandwich lunch comes with a mountain of  coleslaw on top so now I effectively had 2 heaping sides of 2 different types of coleslaw along with a small piece of (good quality) grouper which was heavily deep fried on a huge (but good) roll that was grilled with tons of butter and overpowered the fish.  Wow, this plate along with a small (and average) side of macaroni & cheese plus a Diet Coke came to a total of $30+ for lunch after tax and tip. I still love the Bandera cornbread and peanut coleslaw (and I'm not a big coleslaw guy so that is saying a lot) and I think the key here is stick to the rotisserie chicken or a burger (which would go great on the massive bun they used for my fish sandwich).  Even so, the prices are extremely high - we're probably talking a 20% food cost which would be well below industry average of 30-35% - and if you can't even give me an accurate menu I'm not sure this is someplace I need to return.  In general, I have always expected Bandera and the related Houston's chain to provide consistently good if slightly overpriced food but these prices are starting to go overboard.  I generally try to support locally owned places and my recent visit to Bandera only reinforced this choice further.  I'd probably give it 2.5 stars overall and a promise to rarely if ever return.",0.9956,0.828,0.157,0.014,0.5954882154882155

Bandera knows that it will be packed full of people throughout the weekend - and it shows. Servers are simply there to serve and rush around the restaurant. Food is there to be eaten and is fine.

While my group was waiting for our table, we noticed two bready-looking things in small pie dishes and we started speculating as to what it was.  Answer:  not chicken pot pie, but it was probably the best cornbread I've ever had in my life.  Then we went on to the main courses... I got the prime rib, which was HUGE (as in, the size of my face).  It was fine, but it tasted more like something I would get from a lower-end chain, and I was a little disappointed by the fact that it only came with the mashed potatoes and nothing else.  If I were to come here again, I would definitely go for the sashimi tuna salad, which looked wonderful. The service was kind of on-and-off.  On one hand, they were really speedy, but on the other hand sometimes our server came in the middle of a conversation and looked intensely aggravated that we didn't stop immediately to pay attention to her.  The other thing I didn't really like was the fact that they had about five specials and our server talked so quickly through them we had to ask her to repeat.  And even then I still didn't catch some of the descriptions.  The same thing happened with dessert... if you're going to have a band playing in the background, I think it would probably be a good idea to have the specials and desserts on paper. All in all, this felt like a good alternative to Grand Lux or the Cheesecake Factory, but I would not be knocking down Bandera's door anytime soon.",0.9949,0.789,0.183,0.028,0.5619731800766283

We didn't wait long for a table, and as soon as I sat to rest my feet, I wanted to stay for more than one glass of wine. The service was impeccable despite how busy it was. I was not uber-impressed with the menu as it was very small. The waiter explained that their restaurant group tends to focus not on liquor (no shots, etc), but on the food, which surprised me because one side of the menu was food, the other side: all liquor options. Nevertheless, they had some great brews - try the Matilda ale. Yum. I had the seared tuna salad (as did my 2 friends, boring! i know!), and it was excellent. Not and overload of too much food, and the salad had mangos and avacado in it - 2 of my favorite things. I couldn't put my finger on what the dressing was in the salad, but I am sure the tuna was covered in a peanut sauce of some sort. It was warm and sweet and oh-so-tantalizing. I always think that bread should be served with meals, and it wasn't here. Bread has gotten such a bad rap and is so underrated. It would have helped to round out the meal with some sort of carb. side note: the restrooms smell like oranges and made me crave dessert.",0.981,0.813,0.146,0.041,0.6522979797979798

My server, Dominique was fantastic and super friendly- I settled on a light dinner, the Macho Salad and an enchilada a la carte. The salad was FANTASTIC- (?partially because i was famished) although for $17 they could have been more generous with the avocado and goat cheese and overall portion-size. I honestly don't think i've ever paid that much for a salad.

The menu is short, but sweet.  The three (3) of us had a half hour wait and had a drink at the bar to pass the time along with conversation. When it was time our waitress (Stacey W., very nice I might add) told us the specials of the evening and was quite knowledgeable about the menu.  The ambiance is dark, in a light-hearted type of way, a jazz band was playing complete with piano, cowbell, and upright bass and there weren't any obnoxious people talking loudly.  Everything around us looked good so I knew what I wanted. The better half got the BBQ beef ribs, Heineken Light with the peanut coleslaw and shoestring potatoes.   I got the Prime Cheeseburger (cut into three (3) slices) with shoestring potatoes with a Pomegranate Martini.  The teenager was in a funk and simply got a Sprite and the Macaroni & Cheese.  All in all a good hearty meal after our day in the Windy City; I got a cup of caffeinated coffee as we weren't staying overnight this time and it was my turn to drive back to Moo Town...

It's low ceilings and low lighting at Bandera, and it makes for a very intimate atmosphere--even though it's packed. I'd describe it as Chicago cool. Swankier than it is romantic, Bandera's drinks are strong and mixed well. I had some kinda Ginger beer and dark rum cocktail that I didn't feel at all but I surely could taste!

I was a little concerned as we had limited time but service was quick.. and we initially felt a little under-dressed (jeans) as everyone there seemed to be in brunch gear.  I ordered the burger and he got the french dip. I loved the shoestring fries as well as the burger being cut into 3 bite-size (although large) portions. The bun was toasted and it gave it extra flavor. It was on the greasy side (which is what made it so yummy IMO).  Good value ($12-15/ea) as well. They had a Oreo ice cream sandwich we didn't get to try as we were stuffed and close on time but will definitely come back next time we go to Chi-Town.,0.981,0.796,0.179,0.025,0.338515406162465
2010-09-08,4.0,"I always avoided eating at Bandera because of my fear that anything on the Magnificent Mile would be horrible. First The Purple Pig proved that wrong and now Bandera. My wife and I took my parents here and we had a great time. The atmosphere has a late night club feel and that fits very well with the live jazz music they have playing (which is quite good). You are also visited with a giant rotisserie right when you walk in which I think has defeated the lobster tub as my new favorite item at a restaurant. Our server was very good. Nice, pleasant, knowledgeable on the menu and best of all - helpful with suggestions. I unfortunately cannot remember what everyone else ordered, I went with the ribs and chicken dish. A half slab of beef, yes beef, ribs and a half of a rotisserie chicken. Both were excellent and at a very reasonable price point.

I had the Bandera-style roasted chicken, which was so/so, and the mashed potatoes, a huge disappointment. Almost every dish is served with Spanish rice. Nothing on the menu deserves the prices Bandera commands. Overall, I'd recommend going across the street to The Purple Pig or leaving that tourist trap that is Michigan Avenue altogether.

It is just the right portion, and just the right sweetness and savouriness to it; it is usually what I order for main course whenever I visit. I have had their other appetizers and fish dishes as well, and they are pretty good as well. They have standard American food with a twist and you really cannot go wrong, they are not crazy or out of the way, the food tastes pretty much how you would expect it to taste. I like the ambiance for the most part, except that its a little too dark inside. Even in the day time, it is really dim inside, which I don't prefer most of the time, but I keep going back for the Macho salad! They have live music playing on an off, jazz I believe, and they aren't too bad or loud. Definitely a good place to pop in for a casual lunch or dinner if you are in the area.

It has a very subdued atmosphere set away from the tourists, but there is nothing on the menu that is deserving of its price. I brought a date here, and merely ordered a mini appetizer and a Grolsch. My tab alone was over $15. That's insane. And the waitress, who was very attentive, recommended the corn muffins, so I had those. It was no different than a Jiffy Corn muffin you'd get a mix for $0.50 at your local grocery store.

Although the lunch menu is not extensive, it covers most of the items someone would expect in an American restaurant.  I had roasted chicken with green rice.  The portion of the chicken was about 1/4 of a chicken and the pieces were tender and juicy although I did request for all dark meat.  The rice was delicious.  It was not green as the menu may suggest but is sprinkled with cilantro which added a wonderfully fragrant flavour to the rice. It was a great stop for us to refuel before we went back outside to do more damage to our wallets.",0.9083,0.824,0.127,0.048,0.5437500000000001
2010-08-20,5.0,"So definitely a bit of a hidden gem, smack in the middle of the tourist-ridden Magnificent Mile.  I was in town for work earlier this week and someone in our group recommended this place... at first I was definitely hesitant, considering it's location, but boy it really delivered.  It was crowded by with a professional crowd, not a lot of loud casual tourists... and they had live music to really set a relaxing mood. While we waited at the bar I had a drink, and I highly recommend the pomegranate martini- really fresh and fruity tasting.  Yes, I am a girl, I like fruity things.  But they also have a good wine list, so I can also recommend that :)  It has some medium-priced selections that are great for big groups that are planning on drinking several bottles. When I was there I ordered the ribeye special, but unfortunately they were out of that, so I got the filet,  cooked and served like the ribeye.  I LOVED that they were willing to cook a substitute specially to accommodate my original request- I think that's the sign of a true customer-focused restaurant.  That's actually why they get a five in my book.   And yeah, my filet was awesome.  It was cooked simply and served with huge fresh tomatoes sprinkled with blue cheese and drizzled with some sort of bearnaise sauce... really good. Now I will say, they don't have a really extensive or different menu, I only saw a few things I really thought were innovative (there's a tuna appetizer that's got fruit in it that I tried - it was served with chips, it was good).  But what they do, they do well, and that's all anyone can ask for in my book.    I'll definitely come back here next time I am in town.",0.9983,0.709,0.278,0.013,0.5069696969696971

We got a table overlooking Michigan Avenue, which was cool. The Jumbo Grilled Artichoke starter was so good! It was seasoned well, but you have to know how to eat artichokes (pluck a leaf and suck and scrape w/your teeth). For the entree, I ordered the Blackened and Grilled Yellowtail Fish Sandwich, which I think was a special. It was pretty good and the portion was big (kind of sad I didn't have room for dessert, I would have tried the Banana Cream Pie). I liked the peanut coleslaw that came with it too.

2010-08-15,4.0,"I could have written this review at any time over my Yelp career because, for several years, Bandera has been one of the only places in the city where I can get a decent Tom Collins.  It's practically the only place that I can ever think of when I am downtown and someone says ""Do you want to get a drink somewhere?""  And since I am rarely in that part of downtown looking for a cocktail, I always suggest Bandera, and if we go, I always order the Tom Collins.   As much as I enjoy discussing the lost art of the Tom Collins, if I had written that review, I would have precluded my opportunity to review Bandera's contribution to The Perfect Day.  So I'm glad that I never got around to it. Every once in a very, very rare while, circumstance (or Fate, if you prefer) conspires to craft for you a Perfect Day.  You may be able to help it along with a little planning, but it is out of your hands in all the important ways.  The stars align, everything clicks effortlessly into place, and a giddy, confident feeling lights you up like a Christmas tree.  It feels like powerful, unseen magic at work. To make an extremely long story extremely short, my recent visit to Bandera was part of one of those golden, faultless days.  In fact, it may have been the main highlight, or at least the climax.  Upon entering the overflowing waiting area, we were glad that we had made a reservation.  My girlfriend and I were hoping for a comfortable booth but due to the crowd were apprehensive that we would have to wait or be placed at an undesirable table.  Golden Moment #1:  within a few minutes, the hostess escorted us to...not just a booth, but THE booth--a huge wraparound number suitable for six.  We thought sympathetically for a moment about those big tourist families who walked in to quotes of ""45 minutes to an hour,"" but were not about to question our luck.  Of course we slid all the way around and met in the middle, decadently scorning all the extra space to canoodle next to each other like teenagers. Golden Moment #2:  My ladyfriend, who rarely drinks cocktails, joined me in a Tom Collins.  Still one of the best in the city. Golden Moment #3:  The menu.  So.  Many.  Mouth.  Watering.  Choices.  None of it is very fancy but it all sounded alluring.  After interrogating our gracious and helpful server Dominique, I tossed aside restraint, followed my whims (which you must always do on a Perfect Day) and ordered an appetizer, a soup, an entree with the requisite two sides, and an extra side.  Yep.  That led to Golden Moment #4:  when all the dishes had been delivered but we hadn't yet finished any of them.  I looked out over the landscape of gluttonous luxury.  We had managed to fill all the open space on that huge table without even meaning to.   Golden Moment #5:  The black bean chicken chili.  Yes, I ordered chili in the dead of Chicago summer.  I couldn't resist the description, and by God was it amazing.  Prior to that we had nibbled on a very good spinach/artichoke dip, and there was more great stuff to come, but the chili was my favorite dish of the meal. Golden Moment #6:  The barramundi special.  I don't order fish too much in restaurants but if there were more examples like this, I would.  It was very simply seasoned and grilled, yet so effing delicious.  What a lovely piece of fish, and expertly prepared. Cucumber salad...green rice...fresh corn with chili oil...the mediocre-to-good collection of side dishes passed into the background as we devoured our entrees, the barramundi and the rotisserie chicken.  I have no idea how I found room for it all, but Golden Moment #7 was looking over the table at all the empty platters, save for the chicken chili, which I was taking home.   Whew.  I sat back in the booth with an incredible feeling of contentment.  The kitchen, the hostess, the waitress, the bartender...they all had a hand in it.  It wasn't the greatest meal of my life, but it was so satisfying on all possible fronts; the evening already had that intangible magic to it, but after dinner we were practically glowing. So cheers to Bandera for several years of being a downtown oasis of class and exemplary cocktails.  And an enormous THANK YOU for your part in The Perfect Day.  We won't hold our breath for lightning to strike twice, but we will definitely be back to dine again.",0.9993,0.777,0.195,0.028,0.6101678876678878

I hate the smell when walking in, it smells like butter or something gross, but i guess some people like it. It goes away once your seated. This place has a nice ambiance and always seems to be busy, whether you go on a wednesday night or friday night and live music is awesome. The second time I went there I had the cornbread (ok) and the foccacia (really good) the fries (really good) and some of my friends veggie burger, which is THE BEST veggie burger I have ever had in my entire life. It was a surreal experience. It was so delicious i cannot even begin to describe it, my mouth is watering as I type this. I also had the banana cream pie (which i have never had before) and it was to die for. The 3rd time i had the veggie burger and banana cream pie again, and you'd think it be just OK the second time around, but, Nope, same initial excitement, same amazingness.

2010-08-09,5.0,"There is so much good to say about Bandera. I first discovered the restaurant many years ago when I was staying at the Marriott across the street and noticed the easy to miss restaurant on the 2nd floor above Michigan Avenue. Once you find the entrance off Michigan Ave, you are entering into a relaxing and fun atmosphere. While at times the wait can be a drag, I recommend finding a spot at the bar and enjoying a lovely drink and maybe striking up a conversation with your neighbor. Between the weather, latest show in town, cubs, sox, bears, bulls, blackhawks there should be something to help you pass the time with your neighbor (and maybe meet a neat new person).  Okay, since we're on the topic of the wait, if you have the time, I very much recommend waiting for a table overlooking Michigan Ave, particularly in the spring/summer/fall seasons. Great spot to enjoy a lovely meal and great people watching. That said, if you are on a date, the booths are a great spot. You can snuggle up to your honey and the way the space is configured you feel very intimate.  Onto the food. First of all unless you absolute hate salad, you must try their salad. Their little side salad is to die for. I can fairly confidently say that it is among the best salads I have ever eaten. The portion is plenty to share if you're with that special someone. For your next option you may be tempted by the rotisserie chicken that you can see prominently as you enter and you would not go wrong with that selection. That said, it is fair to say that anything on the menu to this point has been delicious and I have tried to find a flaw. In addition the service is tremendous and you can have your food in just about any fashion that you would prefer. The daily specials are usually great fresh catches and other delicious seasonal favorites that are delightful. As one might expect on Michigan Ave the wine selection is solid.  Lastly, worth noting, should you find yourself on the way to the little boys or girls room, don't forget to peek into the open kitchen, observe the master at work, and enjoy the lovely smells. In addition I must say and several of my female friends have affirmed this to be true from both gender vantage points, the place has a good amount of eye candy.",0.9983,0.746,0.231,0.023,0.5633680902430903

It is actually a great place to take clients, co-workers in from out of town, a date,  or just to treat yourself to some good ol' Americana food. I ordered the seared sashimi tuna salad and it was AMAZING. I know a salad does not sound all that exciting but it is the best salad I have ever had. The tuna was perfectly seared and the salad had this absolutely delightful dressing. I can't even think to what it exactly it would compare but I think that is a good thing, as it is testament to its uniqueness. The salad also had mango and avocado peppered throughout which really added to the overall savoriness of this salad. We had to wait longer than expected for a seat (around 1/2 hour for a lunchtime spot around noon) which was annoying and it is even more annoying that they don't take lunch time reservations. But, when we were seated the wait staff was incredibly friendly and efficient. I would definitely come back here and I definitely will as I need to get another tuna sashimi fixing before it's cold and blistery outside where I'd prefer something a bit warmer.

This may sound like a 3-star review but our waitress never checked back with us to see how our food was - a peeve of mine.

2010-07-06,4.0,"So happy we found this gem of a restaurant tucked among the shops on Michigan Ave. After a morning of travel, we were in need of sustenance to fuel our wilting tourist bodies. While we spent a bit more than we were expecting, it was placated by the scrumptious food and easy service. I had the macho salad, while the bf ordered the burger. My salad was gigantic, which I assume is why they call it macho because the ingredients were not terribly masculine: grilled chicken, lettuce, avocado, dates, almonds, goat cheese, and corn bread pieces stocked my bowl. In fact, I thought there might have been one too many components but I was too hungry to care. The burger was also giant, and also freaking good. If you eat your burger for the beef, you will love this one. It was seasoned perfectly, and served on something other than a bun (baguette? hoagie?). The fries were cut small, and were crispy and addictive. The best part about this restaurant were the views. The whole front of the room is lined with glass windows overlooking Michigan Ave. If there's a table open in the front, make sure you request it!",0.9864,0.803,0.169,0.028,0.5998538011695908

Aside from the fact I couldn't tell what the hell this place was trying to be thanks to a random menu and music selection -  My gripe is with a few things - price, portion size, hygiene and damage control. First off, they charge $13 for a caesar salad that based on the size of this thing should be more like $8. There is no way this should be considered an entree size. A complete rip off. Secondly, we ordered a side of asparagus and when it came out, there was hair in it. I can't say for sure but it looked like pubic hair. I sent it back disgusted not even wanting to finish my salad let alone get a redone side of asparagus. After this, the apparent manager came over and apologized asking if she could bring something out on them. To that I said no. Frankly, I wasn't interested in eating anything else that came out of their kitchen. I expected them to take something off the bill considering we ordered a salad and bowl of soup which cost next to nothing to produce. But no. They comped nothing. We left $35 poorer. Yes that's right folks, $35 for a salad, bowl of soup and one beer, I will NEVER go back. Had I known they wouldn't have comped anything, I would have taken the manager up on her offer and asked for a steak then have them wrap it up to bring to my dog (which I don't have).",-0.9236,0.848,0.049,0.103,0.36710758377425046

She turned 22 today. I would generally not recommend taking a group of fresh college graduates here, as it costs a bit more than a TGI Friday's (not ridiculous, but when it's a birthday and drinks are $10+ a pop, it adds up...especially when people in your group suddenly realize they are cashless).  Also, I would not recommend coming here if you live in Chicago and are bringing other people from Chicago. It's a little touristy (Michigan Ave. and all), and a little too hard to get into for what it offers. However, it is a great place to bring out of towners who want to feel like they ate at a ""nice Chicago restaurant"" with a cool view of the city.  The menu is limited, but the wine list is good. The mixed drinks (especially martinis) are also very good. Everyone seemed pleased with their food, including myself (I had the French dip), and the service was quick and friendly. Not an overall bad place, but not sure I'd jump into the five-star hype too quickly. I'd put this restaurant on par with something like The Rainforest Cafe, minus the jungle crap and being good for kids thing: A limited menu that is slightly overpriced for some of the choices, highly saturated with tourists, but nicely laid out, in an area out of town guests will love to talk to friends about when they get home.

Once you find the door and escalator, and get over the fact that yes, this is the right way, you'll be greeted by a wall of slow spinning rotisserie chicken.  This is one of their specialties.  You'll notice right away that the layout is rather large and sprawling, but each seat intimate, even more so over by the booths.  The lights remain low, with dramatic highlights and the sound of music (usually jazz) playing softly in the background.  At times, there's an actually group off to the side near the bar.   The prime seats are over the by the windows looking out over Michigan Ave.  These slant outward and are a great back drop at any time of day. All the staff approaches friendly and are attentive, as their clientele are a mixture of visitors and locals.  This I've notice makes service always a little better, especially when people could be coming back the next week.   The food is lovely and succulent.  Kick off with the grilled artichoke, which comes as 3 halves, full leaf marinated and salted.  It's a rather unique side for a restaurant and done right.  The ""meat"" slides right off and the hearts inside are juicy as can be.  Plus, it's a share plate that gets all involved and is fun to eat.  The crab cakes were the special and done very very well, as an entire at that.  However, the peak of the meal was the Macho Salad.  A large helping of salad which has enough in it to make anyone happy.  I was raised by a chef known for her salads, and this one brought me back to my childhood days.   Now, being on Michigan ave, you have to expect the prices to be a little higher, but the overall decor and quality of food comes with that.  The servers will make sure you're satisfied and it's a sure thing.  Excellent place for a date night, double date night or relaxing dinner with friends.",0.997,0.805,0.182,0.013,0.494451198919284

2010-01-29,4.0,"I have been going to Bandera several times a year for many years now and have always been impressed with the ambiance, location and quality of the food.  My GF and I love this place and will try to grab a table there whenever we're in the neighborhood.  Everything you order there is delicious.  From the macaroni and cheese to the rotisserie chicken and steaks, it's all top-notch.  The wine list is pretty decent as well, with an ample selection of quality Pinot Noirs from a variety of regions.  Service is frequently very professional and personable.  All the way around, a very good dining operation.  My only complaint ever before today was that sometimes, the front-desk hostesses tend to exhibit a bit of arrogance and almost delight in telling you there are no tables to be had right away (though this was not the case today). Today was not my best visit with them, however.  I was really in the mood for a cheeseburger and saw one on their menu.  I ordered it, thinking that a Bandera burger would have to be out-of-this-world amazing.  The description simply said: ""Cheeseburger - Fresh Ground (In- House) with hand-cut fries.""  When it arrived, it looked juicy and delicious, but I also noticed that it had freshly-chopped, giant, raw onions and green peppers melted into the top layer of cheese, along with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on top of this.  But wait...that's not all.  Underneath the burger was a thick layer of coleslaw and mustard.  I'm willing to concede that there are probably a whole lot of people out there who would salivate over a burger like this and may think I'm crazy to be complaining.  However, I absolutely hate onions and I really cannot stand cole slaw.  I'm just saying...one would think that if the kitchen was going to take such creative liberties with a cheeseburger, they'd at least mention all these extra ingredients on the menu before people ordered it, right?  I am so tired of ordering something as described on a menu, only to have it arrive and see that the kitchen has decided to include a whole host of mystery ""surprise"" ingredients not mentioned on the menu.  Today's experience at Bandera was one of the most blatant of these occasions I've seen in a very long time and I was not thrilled to have to spend 5-7 minutes cleaning off my entire entree before I could eat it.  The waitress stopped by several times and saw me dissecting the burger and didn't make a comment.  I think an apology would have been proper in this case.  Something like ""Oh, I should have told you that our cheeseburger actually comes with 6 extra ingredients that aren't mentioned in the menu...my bad.  Let me take it back and get you one that only has what you want on it.""  Nope.  I had to pick every piece of onion, pepper and slaw off of that burger before I could eat it...and nobody offered to take it back.  Despite this unpleasant experience, the burger was quite delicious after everything offensive to my palate was removed. While this was not all too great of an experience, I will definitely be back because I know Bandera to be an amazing restaurant where I've had many, many a fine meal.  I can give them an occasional misstep after years of great service.",-0.6981,0.807,0.098,0.096,0.5552974713458584

Every time we would show up on the weekend though, there would be at least a 45 minute wait and we were always starving, so we never hung around. Well, we finally wised up and went on a weeknight - got in immediately. First things first, I really like the atmosphere of this place. It's dark, but never feels TOO dark, and the decor is appealing. They also have a three-piece jazz band playing at the center of the place. Very nice. It should be noted that when I walked past the band, the drummer had the best ""I'm a badass jazz musician"" face I've ever seen. Anyways, on to the food. First off, I ordered the bangers and mashed, only to have my waiter tell me that they don't have it anymore and he ""wasn't even sure why it's still on the menu"". Kinda weird and I had my hopes set on it, but I went with my second choice, some apricot-glazed pork and mashed potatoes. Delicious. I don't have pork all that often, but this was very good. Very tender and the glaze was great. Maybe could have been a bit less dry though, but overall very good. My friend got a more simple (and cheaper) prime rib dip sandwich that I was skeptical about at first. It was also very good, however. Simple, yet delicious.  The biggest downside to this place is it is a bit pricey, but considering how good the meal was, it really wasn't a big deal.

I don't get to go as often since it's no longer within walking distance of my office, but that just means I appreciate it that much more when I am able to go. Always a creature of habit, I tend to order the Macho salad. It's chock full of rotisserie chicken, corn, avocado, goat cheese, cornbread croutons, dates and other unusual ingredients.  I am also happy to report that they finally listed almonds as one of the ingredients on the menu description. I would always forget that the salad had slivered almonds on top until it was placed in front of me. Since the salad is liberally covered in them and I have a mild allergy to nuts, I would have to send it back to be remade. I always felt bad about this, but the situation could have been easily avoided had the almonds been listed on the menu as one of the components of the salad. I'd have discussions with manager every time. I'm glad they finally remedied it. Saves them money too, since I can't be the only one this has happened to. The service is pleasant and efficient, and the atmosphere is relaxed but somehow intimate. Tip: I always ask for all white meat chicken on my salad and most places would charge extra. Happily, Bandera does not. Great dining option for a date, business lunch, or just a meal with friends. It appeals to tourists and locals alike.",0.976,0.781,0.15,0.069,0.6826666666666666

The decor and service consistently exceed the expectations of what one would expect from a chain. That being said, you can easily spend $50 a person here.

And if you have ever dined at Houston's, then you should know what to expect: very good American food, fine art displays, impeccably clean washrooms, and friendly service.  I recommend the following staples:  The Bandera Style roasted chicken- they marinate whole birds and roast them on a spit rotisserie-style - incredibly succulent  Beef BBQ ribs with fresh coleslaw and fries- this is a signature dish. You haven't tasted coleslaw until you've tasted coleslaw here. Insanely visceral rush of fresh textures and herb flavors.  Fresh corn bread- comes in a cool iron cast skillet.

Our server was attentive, friendly and informative and after our drinks were ordered, we decided on entrees and settled in. The roasted chicken sandwich looked hearty and delicious, and the tuna salad was lovely on a plate. Being that I am a meat-and-potatoes girl, I went for the bangers and mash. Unfortunately, my eyes were a little too big for my stomach and the portion generous. The local sausages were savory, the potatoes were decent and the steamed greens were good but overall, I felt the entire dish was a little too salty. There was no gravy or sauce, and with just a small bit of brown mustard to dip the bangers into, was just all a bit too dry for me.

Let me also gush a little about their peanut coleslaw concoction. I was never a huge fan of coleslaw because it's usually a little bit of cabbage in a bowl of mayo. Once again, Bandera proved me wrong. Their's is light, made with more of a vinaigrette with chunks of peanuts that, trust me here, tastes amazing.

Obscuring the view doesn't warm-up the space - it makes it feel like a prison.  If it ain't broke... Normally I would give Bandera a 5-star review. I have been coming to the Michigan Ave 2nd floor location for many years. The food is great, the service is friendly and efficient, and both are consistent from visit to visit. There are skilled bartenders and live jazz nightly. The atmosphere is warm and inviting for lunch, but the place really shines (or rather doesn't) for dinner. For dinner Bandera puts on a different face with dimmed lights grazing the dark interior finishes, copper and wood glint here and there, and of course that live jazz. The best tables in the house were (emphasis on 'were') always at the window - and they were worth the wait.  This brings me back to the reason 3 stars are subtracted from this review. Last night when I dined at Bandera I chose to wait an hour for a window table, even though my guests were hungry and there were banquets a plenty on this Wednesday evening. When I got to my window seat  I was stunned by the addition of wood blinds blocking my view. I tried to rationalize the addition: The windows face West, but generous exterior awnings and the high-rises of Michigan Ave block direct sun. And it's 9pm. And the blinds don't open - there are no cords to raise them.  (see prison comment above) With no obvious explanation coming to me, I  complained incessantly to the patient and sympathetic staff. Everyone from the runner to the GM gave me the same explanation: An edict from HQ to ""warm-up"" the space.  Really? I mean I get it, Hillstone is based in the West - the other Bandera restaurants look out on not-much-of-anything. However, this isn't Sacramento. The Hillstone people should put a little bit of trust in their local leadership and take some time to learn about the different markets they serve.  It right there on the main Yelp page: 35 reviewers on yelp cite the ""..great view of Michigan Avenue...""  I'm not done.  A trip to the restroom revealed another misguided effort. I don't miss the monitors over the urinals, however the thin, cheap-looking oak plywood is no improvement. You can't cut the material around the fixtures and expect it to look good. The engaging and ever-patient GM assured me that the finished product would be presentable - but I have my doubts.

2009-09-29,3.0,"It was the last day on our trip, and we had eaten at all of our ""bookmarked"" restaurants on Yelp. We were too hungry and tired to go searching and walking to another place beyond a city block. We walked down Michigan Ave, about a block from our hotel, and it hit us like a big red sign. This place is the same owners of Houston's, with essentially the same menu. I had never been to Houston's, so I figured why not try Bandera in Chicago. It's a very dark, cozy, and rather loud atmosphere. By glancing around, you can tell it's a very business-like and touristy crowd. We were seated along the window facing Michigan Ave, right by the live piano and jazz band. By now, we were starving and we just wanted to order right away. Unfortunately, it took a long time for the waitress to come to our table. We started off with the queso dip for our appetizer. It's not your typical melted cheese, but more chunky and hardened. Not bad, we ate it all up. For entrees, my wife ordered the salmon and I had the beef ribs with shoestring fries. Salmon was nicely cooked, moist and flaky, with a flavorful glaze on top. My beef ribs could have been more tender, and too much of a charred and burnt crisp on the outside. The shoestring fries were also a bit too oily. Yes, it's obvious that everything here is pretty overpriced for more or less average American food. We did enjoy the atmosphere, and people-watching through the glass windows was actually more entertaining than I had originally thought. We saw a cab break down in the middle of the street, and heard quite a few fire trucks and ambulances zoom by. Those sirens can get pretty darn loud.",0.9303,0.856,0.089,0.055,0.45087495160665897

The Queso Dip with which we started was unique (served cold) and was accompanied by house-made Guacamole; the duo of dips really jived well and weren't so heavy as to fill us up before our entrees arrived. My friends chowed on burgers and sandwiches while I ordered the Macho Salad. It was excellent - striking the perfect balance of sweet & savory.

On the way out I asked for a manager.  When I was able to speak with her I told her of the incident with the reservations be wrong at least twice.  I told her about the bartender taking the lunch menus from us.  I told her that she should have came over and spoke with us and at least offer appetizers or something.  She got smart with me which made me angry.  Only after I told her that I felt like I had been discriminated against did she try and offer $100.00 off our meal.  She follow us out and wanted us to come back into the restaurant to eat  She was ready to give us the world but the damage has already been done.  I told her we had already called for our Limo and it was on the way, once it arrived she said she would pay for the limo then she said she would pay for the limo coming back.   We left her standing outside as we got into the waiting limo.   She told me she would have her manager call me but I have not heard from anyone as of yet.   I'm taking my story public.",-0.7772,0.912,0.033,0.056,0.4990327380952381

Have it, period, end of discussion.  -Great place to take people visiting Chicago because it's on Michigan. -Make a reservation if you don't want to wait 45 to an hour for regular seating, an hour for sitting by the window, at peak dinner hours (7ish-8ish) -Service is always good. Hostesses range from nice to really nice.  I've had Stacey as my waitress twice now (since I insist on sitting by the windowed seats for the view of Mich Ave.) and she is wonderful.  Aside from the fabulous Macho Salad: -The queso dip is tasty and not the goopy cheese dip I was expecting, the mac and cheese is really good, I am obsessed with the Oreo dessert, and the banana cream pie is good. -The lamb sandwich tastes like roast beef and someone at the table next to me said the SAME thing when we asked how she liked it. I, however, don't like the gamey lamb taste so I welcomed the roast beef-ish situation.  -Their fries are thin and yummy; always salted to my liking. -The ribs are tender, fall-off-the-bone goodness. I detest BBQ/A1 style sauce and I still was able to appreciate. A little too much sauce, though, but that's just me. Maybe someone who likes BBQ would disagree. -Oh and I almost forgot.

2009-07-04,3.0,"What to say . . what to say . . .about a place that was ok at best but whose rave reviews on Yelp prompted me to give it a try the other day?  Bandera is one of the few chains that gets consistently good reviews regarding their food. Maybe it is different at night- but on a recent luncheon experience, it was just ok.  The dark clubby atmosphere is probably more suited to dinner than lunch although I did like the way the place was laid out and the abundance of booths.  We were seated by the front window overlooking the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. While this table was prime at lunch- it's close proximity to the grand piano would probably make dinner conversation a bit challenging but the view is worth it, in my opinion.  Part of our experience challenge was a server who acted like he really didn't want to be there and that he was doing us a favor by even waiting on us. I also didn't like that he stood behind us to take our order- a simple two steps to stand in front of me while I asked my questions would have gone a long way. A different server may have upped this review by a whole star!  We went with the appetizer special of the day (duo dips which were guacamole and con queso served with chips). It was okay but more like ""bar food"" so we left most of it. Again- thought the server might ask why we weren't eating it?  Our salads were quite tasty although my friend's Macho salad was the clear winner to my ahi tuna salad. The Macho salad was basically a chopped salad with some of their great chicken tossed in and served with a vinaigrette dressing. As for me- while the presentation of the ahi tuna lined up at the edge of the plate was lovely and the tuna fresh and tasty- the greens were a bit bitter and tasteless even with all the dressing they coat it with.  If you drive- parking is a bit of a challenge around here- it's Michigan Ave, after all! There is a pay lot behind it on St. Clair but know before you go it is a bit pricey (about $18 for 2 hours). And one other thing worth noting- the bathrooms at this place are as clean as I have ever seen- the word sanitized comes to mind (good to know on those days you may be wandering the Mag Mile and need a little break!)

The mister and I met up with my brother and sister in law here after they had a fun day of shopping and relaxing without two, very cute high energy toddlers. I too welcomed this afternoon excursion to get drinks and talk to company after doing laundry all day. Walking in here, it's a dark contrast to the brightly lit escalator. Instead, Bandera is dark and loungey with a large chicken rotisserie pit providing warmth and light nearby. I found my brother and sister in law at the bar enjoying Stella and queso dip. I ordered my usual drink only to find out that they don't carry flavored vodkas. What bar doesn't carry flavored vodkas? I settled on a Ketel One Citron with club soda and twist of lime. My drink was surprisingly strong. I usually expect weak pours, but these were some strong ones. The mister and I had the queso dip appetizer. It was alright. I expected it to be ooey-gooey cheesy, instead, it's more of a picnic mayonnaise based creamy dip. It wasn't very creamy, but more globular too. It had a mild kick to it; enough to please the non-spicy crowd. Frankly, it wasn't anything special. I had a wonderful afternoon drinking with my brother and sister in law at Bandera.

We were planning to walk the Magnificent Mile that day, and I was starving. Well, not literally, but I was determined to be in a bad mood until I had some good food in my belly. Riding up the escalator to the restaurant, which overlooks Michigan Ave (so cool, btw), I thought This is going to be a stuffy restaurant where I won't like any of the food. I was sooooooo wrong! Ok, it is a bit stuffy, but not in an overly annoying way. It actually made me want to be a stuffy adult when I grow up too. The food was amazing, and I'm not just saying that because I was really hungry. It's american cuisine, not fast food and not your average burger. I did order the burger though. I had never seen a burger like this before. It was a burger fit for the TV show Top Chef. It tasted juicy, light, flavorful, sweet and absolutely delish. Obviously, I practically inhaled it. The fries are unlike any fries I've had before, and to describe them would not do them justice. My only complaint would be the price, but that's just because I'm a cheapskate who loves expensive things but hates parting with my money. 4 stars! I had to knock off a star for the price. I'm sorry, I don't like spending my money even if it is for the best burger I have ever eaten in my life. Oh and that day I ate with one of the pickiest eaters I have ever met.

The entree chosen was the roasted chicken with spanish rice and although the chicken was flavored and very moist, the sauce that came with it had way too much chili spice for my taste.

2008-11-13,5.0,"Bandera, a good stop for my first time in Chicago. There were many franchise chain restaurants in this windy city and I'm glad to have landed upon this very delicious restaurant! I suggest a reservation be made in advance to avoid the wait, especially when you know there is a convention of some sort in town, cause it gets busy! But if you like to be spontaneous there is shopping around the corner you can do while waiting, and a Citibank and Bank of America right by it if you need some cash money money. We had a 40 minute wait for a walk-in on a Monday night. You can also get the full menu at the bar if you don't want to wait. The portions were large and worth the money. If you're on a budget you can get an appetizer and share the entree and still be able to enjoy wonderful food. I got a pork dish that came with two large pork chops. they were thick and yummy, the sauce on it was what made it delicious. My friend got the roasted chicken and it came with breast leg thigh almost half a chicken!  Sides need to be ordered separately like most fancy restaurants so if you want to include some veggies in this meal better order it on the side. It was a bit too dark in the place I couldn't even see the band and had to sit at a certain angle to read the menu. Live music playing is awesome, very jazzy and fun. Service was great but when i asked for extra sauce she gave me maple syrup and insisted that it was the sauce....... when i insisted back that there was apricot in the sauce. They don't take discover card, so no bonus points for me. I hate having my cards rejected its embarrassing  Overall I had a good experience, you can see a glance of the kitchen and the food was delicious and reasonably priced for the portion.

2008-11-01,4.0,"Bandera was a haunt of mine in the 1990's. I've been there rarely since, so having dinner there last night was essentially like trying a restaurant for the first time. And, to be hosted by one of my favorite cousins who came to Chicago to visit me and my kids, it portended to be precisely the treat it turned out to be. The salient aspect of Bandera is the service. It's excellent. The servers - even those whom are not ""your"" server  - all pitch in and help. There was a moment where one of us at the table didn't get just what she ordered, we summoned a server, who promptly corrected the situation, and all was good. My daughter ordered a prime rib sandwich that was so good  - as she said - she ate every crumb. I tasted her shoestring potatoes that were not greasy, but delicious. Two of us had prime rib entrees, and two had vegetarian sandwiches. The prime rib was unusually spicey and well, pretty damn salty, but YUM! (This morning my blood pressure pills asked me, ""hey, why do you bother with us?"") The mashed potatoes were almost good enough to order as an entree. The menu had great choices that all looked wonderful: lots of seafood and chicken dishes that would satisfy any hunger or level of palate discrimination, I suspect. It's pricey, and worth it. So, next time an out-of-town someone invites me to dinner, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Bandera.",0.9672,0.755,0.163,0.082,0.6578947368421052

The salad days, I like to call them. I was working on Michigan Avenue in a perfectly respectable position at a high-end sportswear store and life seemed nothing less the keen. Then, one day, a new venue opened above Citibank, Bandera. It's decidedly clubby atmosphere and 360º bar, wall of rotisserie chickens and open kitchen caught and kept the eye and nose of meat being grilled and roasted and it made my head swim. I soon forgot the bread and circuses at Houston's and found myself sitting at the bar without the fresh grapefruit squeezing show, or the napkin as tablecloth, instead, I was sitting in over-stuffed leather booths and enjoying the unique ambience, the Über-friendly and efficient service and new items like classic Chicago spinach-artichoke dip, #1 tuna poke, and impossibly juicy chicken and perfect mashed potatoes and crack-tastic skillet cornbread. Then I read the news Houston's was closing. At the time I learned that the same organization [Hillstone] owned both venues. No wonder things seemed so familiar. I felt like I and I alone had caused the closure of Houston's, but I felt ok with that since Bandera felt like it had real staying power, just as it has proven to date.

C'mon, tipping has been around for over 40 years.  If you're so crotchety and grumpy and still refuse to tip, don't go out to eat.  Paying the wait staff $2/hour allows food costs to be lower, so tips are a part of their income.   I hope Mary M's fiance was humiliated and his feeling's were hurt, because imagine how the waitress would've felt if the manager assumed she did a bad job.  THAT is why they come over and ask, to ensure that the meal was top notch and there were no problems.  It's not to embarrass deadbeats.  That is just a bonus.

They have the cozy rotisserie fire near the entrance with lines of chicken slowly spinning; their juices hugging their entire bodies, slowly caramelizing the skin. On your dinner plate, the chicken is not smothered with spices to hide the taste of the flesh but slightly seasoned so you can taste the goodness of the meat.

I was a little nervous about going here because of some the the bad reviews but I still chose to go to Bandera. I met my previous boss and some co-workers here. We went late night for dinner. Were sat at 10:00 p.m. I was a little bit nervous about coming so late, because working in the industry I know how frustrating to have last minute customers on a Sunday. But the staff were great. Our server Julie was excellent. She gave us some suggestions.  We split the queso dip & a hamburger for the appetizer. I really think that they have one of the best hamburgers in the city. It is topped with pickles, lettuce, tomato & a zangy ranch dressing. YUMM! The queso dip was interesting. It was cold & chucky. Looked terrible, but it tasted great.  For dinner we ordered the Salmon, which was really great. Cooked perfectly. Served with a mixed cold vegetable salad, and rice. Pork chops with apricot chutney & corn bread was out of this world. The pork was cooked perfectly. The sauce made me want more! The ribs were so soft, they fell right off the bone. I couldn't be happier.  For dessert the keylime pie was great. The only reason why Bandera isn't getting 5 stars is because they aren't orginal in their dessert selections. The keylime pie is the same as Houston's. For me--copying your sister restaurants menu is a bit cheating. There are so many great desserts you can come up with so I was a bit dissapointed. It looked like the banana pudding was the same as Houston's.  Oh well--but it was great. Our view really made out dining experience better. Seeing Michigan Ave. on a cool crisp night was outstanding.

Tonight I did remember Bandera so my brother and I headed over there for an early dinner.  Although I was tempted to get their amazing cornbread appetizer (one thing I can't find at Houstons) I decided to be healthy and get the grilled artichoke appetizer...it's easy to be healthy when veggies taste this good. YUM!  For our entrees my brother chose the Hacked Chicken Salad, which he described as awesome, and I went with the veggie burger.  I actually don't even like veggie burgers, but there is something about the veggie burgers at Bandera, Houstons, and J Alexander that makes me crave them! So yummy & so filling! The service was great and they had us in and out of there within an hour...when leaving around 7ish I noticed there was quite a wait for seating.  I may be forgetting about Bandera (although it will be hard to forget tonight's meal), but by the wait it looks like others are remembering how good this restaurant is!",0.991,0.751,0.181,0.068,0.6013888888888889

It is very different from any kind of mashed potatoes that I've had before, but it is very addictive!  They have roasted chicken as well, which is fork tender and flavorful. I've also had their oreo dessert which is a nice finish to a wonderful meal! I've been to the Bandera restaurant in Sacramento and was excited to know that they have the same chain here in Chicago.

2006-10-12,3.0,"I wouldn't call Bandera hip or trendy.  It seems to be mostly suit and tie clientele for business lunches or after dinner lunches.  Nothing says unhip like a room full of suited people.  I've been here a handful of times on business lunches, in fact, because this is what they mainly cater to (and for that purpose, it works). I rarely end up here for dinner, and after one experience, I wouldn't again on purpose. We ordered the artichoke for an appetizer.  While it was very good, I was annoyed when the waitor came by 3 minutes after we received it to explain how to eat it, as if I had never eaten artichoke before.  Its not like we were just staring blankly at it not sure what to do with it. We were further annoyed when the expeditor came and dropped off our entrees 2 minutes later (so in total no more than 5 minutes after we got our appetizer).    Hello, can't you tell we're not even half way done with our appetizer?  This to me is absolutely unacceptable and probably one of the worst things a restaurant can do.  10 minutes later (eating a giant artichoke is fairly time consuming) we were ready to eat our barely warm entrees.  It's not like we could even complain, because the server never came back to ask how everything was until we were clearly ready for more drinks and/or our check.   When he did finally come back, we were finally able to ask for water in addition to our drinks.   Just about EVERY entree on the menu is loaded and glazed with sugar.  The night I went all of the specials came with your choice of maple syrup glazed carrots OR braised cabbage.  Thinking the braised cabbage was the smarter choice health-wise, my dining partner and I both picked it.  The cabbage came and was more like caramelized cabbage than braised.  It tasted like it was braised in corn syrup and vinegar, not just wine or whatever one might expect.  My pork entree-which mentioned nothing of a glaze--came and was glazed in some sort of thick honey sauce.   It reminded me of something they'd serve at Applebees. Outside of the very simply prepared artichoke, the food itself wasn't anything spectacular.  To me any restaurant that needs to drench everything in thick sauces (a la TGIFs) is trying to cover up poorly prepared dishes. As soon as the check was about to be delivered, the waitor started being very attentive and tried to make us forget that everything up until then was pretty mediocre (even though we never actually told him, since by the time he really came back it was too late anyway). This place has live jazz music every night.  Just make sure that when getting a table, you aren't seated directly next to the quartet, or you'll be lucky to hear yourself cough.  I'm not complaining about the live music--its great--but for dining its a little loud. Honestly, I wouldn't expect service at TGIF's to be this lacking.  At over $100 for 2 entrees, one appetizer, and 2-3 drinks (total, not per person), the place isn't the cheapest place in the world for what it is, either.  Go to Bandera if you go out every night of your life and haven't tried it, but certainly don't go there hoping to have a nice date or something.",0.9065,0.903,0.064,0.034,0.5865735653235654
