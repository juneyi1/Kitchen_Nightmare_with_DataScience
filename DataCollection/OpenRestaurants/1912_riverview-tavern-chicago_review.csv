They had just had a tap takeover, so drafts were basically unavailable. We both ordered the same bottled beer and they only had one left...too stressful lol. The second time, I dropped in with a buddy for a quick drink just after work hours. Place was deserted except for a couple guys at the bar, but for some reason the bartender seemed annoyed that we were there. Kept pressing for a second round and huffily took the menus away when we said we weren't eating. Strange. It's close by...it's available...and the pizza is solid.

I drive by here all the time, and have been curious about it because it has a nice, comfortable look, and they seem to have rooftop seating, which is a plus. When I finally visited, I was very disappointed. The pros are they have a very friendly, accommodating staff, comfortable atmosphere and decor with just enough kitsch without being tacky. They also have a large selection of beer on tap, but were virtually all ales. If you want a crisp lager or pilsner, you're out of luck - we're in the Midwest, I would think at least one on tap would be in order. I chose this place based on some of the food photos on Yelp. A photo of nachos looked especially delicious, so that's what I ordered. Not three minutes later, when they came out, I immediately thought, ""See here, we're off to a bad start."" Yes, it was during brunch time, but they do offer their entire menu. What I was served was a congealed mess of unmelted, shredded cheese with a cold glop of cheese sauce ladled on top of cold chips with a thimbleful of black bean and corn relish, not the deliciousness featured in the Yelp pic (see my photo). Not to make a scene, I tried to muscle through it because I was hungry, but after 3 chips I had to stop. They took it off the bill without a problem.

My guess is they were smoked and then finished on the grill, but they were done way too long.They came with brown mustard (who puts straight mustard on ribs?) and two BBQ sauces. I had to use a lot of BBQ sauce to make them edible. I will credit them for a few things. Hand cut fries. Big deal in my book.

Sadly we'll be taking a break until they can get it together. Service has definitely gone down hill during our last few visits. Arrived tonight with party of 7 adults +1 toddler and was told they only had one menu available (restaurant was not crowded at all). Shared the one menu for about 20 minutes until more became available. An extra glass of wine was accidentally brought out with the first round of drinks (which took another 10+ minutes) and when we pointed out the error it was taken away but still appeared on our bill. Appetizer order of pretzels took another 20+ minutes and arrived completely cold/soggy. Had to flag a different waiter (ours had disappeared) to send it back. Took nearly an hour from the time we were seated for our meals to arrive, and the most simple meal of the group, a house salad, was never delivered. Had to walk around the restaurant and hunt down our waitress to let her know we were missing something. Again - had to get up and walk around the restaurant to find our waitress to bring the check, then find her (again) to remove the extra wine charge. All in all we spent an hour and a half there and had to go find someone every time we wanted anything - not acceptable for a place serving easy/basic bar food that was not even remotely crowded.",-0.5176,0.931,0.028,0.041,0.35986394557823126

Obviously those items are trailblazing and are standard fare at restaurants, especially pubs, but I have those dishes before in pubs across the city and they've been unmemorable or memorably bad.  Not as Riverview. I could tell there was a little extra effort there and I appreciated it and it didn't make me feel remorseful that I had to settle with eating at a bar.

It was pretty busy last night, but there were multiple things happening at the same time so it wasn't much of a surprise.

Our waitress was phenomenal, and made the experience even better. She was new, but clearly she had been a waitress before. She was extremely attentive, helpful, and wasn't afraid to talk with us and joke with us. A true gem. She said she had been working at Riverview for 3 days. But if she didn't say anything I would have thought she was a manager or a veteran. We got our drinks almost immediately and we were pleasantly surprised that our food arrived in maybe 10-15 minutes. More on that later.  There was a special on craft beer's for the night due to the event and our waitress was kind enough to bring us samples of different beer so we could ""try before we buy."" We actually wound up trying four of the beers on the list. I am newly single, and definitely had a special affinity to the ""99 Problems,"" saison beer because of that. I ordered a Cali-Chicken Sandwich and my friend ordered a Hickory Burger. The food only took 10-15 minutes to arrive much to our surprise considering how busy it was.

This place also seems to be having an identity crisis.  I was not allowed to just sit where I wanted  - a host sat me (and I wasn't given a booth by the tvs but rather an uncomfortable table alone in the front room despite the place being pretty empty).  There are a bunch of crayons on the host table.  I do not know if you are permitted to have a table if you are only ordering drinks.  I can't tell for sure if Riverview still intends to be a pub or if they intend to be some sort of a restaurant.  (Granted, someone else said this was just another noisy bar, so my experience on this front may have been unique based on the time I showed up.)  Also, I did not recognize any of the staff members, which made me sad because the old staff was really nice to me.  Hopefully they are still there and I hit the wrong time. In short, although I am sure the new management has the best intentions, I really think they cut and changed both the wrong things and  too much.  This place has at least temporarily been knocked off of my favorite neighborhood bars list - I'll stick with the Four Moons and the Village Tap.  I will keep my eye out for positive developments.",0.9803,0.783,0.127,0.089,0.5392544492544491

We then waited 10 minutes for menus and water and another 10 for drinks and to place our order.  We then sat there, completely ignored for 45 minutes waiting for our food.  My husband finally went to the main room to ask if we could get our food to-go (our 16 month old, who was surprisingly well behaved for such a wait, was getting really hungry).  Our server said that would be no problem. 10 minutes later, our food arrived at our table, but not to-go.  Oh well, since it was finally there we were happy. My husband's order was completely wrong, sandwich, side, everything. My son's ""grilled"" cheese was 5 slices of processed american cheese between white bread, not even remotely grilled or melted. It was pretty disgusting. The side of fruit he received was a few small chunks of apple and some dried cranberries, clearly the garnish for a salad, not a side of fruit.

In the grand scheme of Chicago dining, I'd give it a solid 3 stars- maybe 3.5 on it's better days taking into account that it's a neighborhood joint.  Service is really hit or miss. Usually the servers and bartenders are attentive, though sometimes you do get an occasional bad apple. Their busboys are a little overattentive.

We arrived and were instructed to seat ourselves.  We all ordered water, and I was immediately put off by the fact that they give you plastic cups for water... the cheapy, translucent step-down-from-Solo kind.  Am I at a movie theatre?  This is a bar, is the cost of washing one more glass so high compared to disposable cups that you're willing to let the environment take one for the team? Our waitress was nice enough, but she had a weird habit of pointing at the person she was speaking to, and she seemed to be covering the entire place on her own.  She walked quickly with her head down, and it was therefore nearly impossible to track her down, even when we should have been rightly in her line of vision.   We ordered the hummus plate (on $3 special, bonus), but when it came out, it was spinach dip.  The mistake was corrected, but the spinach dip also managed to sneak its way onto our bill later.  When my salad came out, it had the wrong dressing attached, and it took more than 5 minutes to track someone down to have it fixed (with my Dad eventually solving the problem by waving a hand in the air like he just don't care).  However, I didn't like the dressing I ordered (""avocado ranch"" tasted like slaw dressing) or the one that came with it (salsa vinaigrette was meh), so I ordered some standard ranch and it tasted like it came from a Kraft bottle. The way they do their salads is smart, with a base price per salad and then ""add a protein"" for an additional charge.  But the menu said ""grilled chicken,"" which a reasonable person would expect to mean that when you order, they will grill chicken and slap it up on your salad.  But the chicken was cold and dry as opposed to hot and juicy and had clearly been cooked hours earlier and thrown into a container to be added to salads later.  Honestly, it was pretty gross.  My Mom's salad had shrimp, and it was hot and delicious, which made me a little jealous. All in all, not a super great experience.  Especially considering my salad was $11, most definitely not worth the price.  Maybe I should stick to the deep-fried bar snacks, but considering it's not exactly in the neighborhood, I don't see much incentive to return...",0.9836,0.798,0.133,0.07,0.5903833333333334

It was grilled....um....gross? It's like they put the whole wrap in the middle of a foreman and then served it up. LOL, no thanks. At least not without my permission.  Snooks was real sweet the whole time though, and once we got the ball rolling the food came pretty quickly and she kept the water glasses full. I guess there's an upside to every experience.

While the history that Riverview Tavern proudly upholds of what was once (back in 1904) Chicago's only amusement park - and the ""World's Largest"" - is impressive and undeniable, the overall vibe here is pretty basic. Think positively typical neighborhood bar-cum-restaurant in every way... large wood bar, a smattering of booths, rickety tables with wood chairs, somewhat apathetic service, pub-type grub... the formula surely works for grabbing a brew and watching your game of choice via copious flatscreen - as I did this evening - but high expectations for much else should be checked at the ticket booth.  A shining beacon is certainly all the signage nostalgia from the roller coasters, fortune tellers, food vendors and even 'the parachute jump'... a neat flashback to our city's illustrious past, indeed and absolutely fun to dine by. Burgers and sandwiches are in plenty here as well as a few salads and pizza options from the next-door Robey Pizza Co. Stick to Riverview's items done well like juicy hot wings, meaty chili burgers and crunchy tater tots (mmmm....tots!) and you'll do just fine. Try to get fancy with healthier fare and you're left despondently picking at a dry grilled chicken breast and accompaniment of cold, undressed green beans. Barf.

These days they took the cork dartboards away and put a pool table by it.

We went inside and checked out the menu in the back room and went to the front room to make our order. It took awhile for the bartender to come on out but it was understandable given that it's Friday night and the whole place was jammed with Roscoe Village denizens. Plenty of good looking folks and the Blackhawks game was overhead on the TVs so we could get a clear view of them taking out Vancouver in devastating fashion! The bartender brought us our checks but the pens did not work much to my chagrin. Me and my buddy stood at the bar for about 20 minutes until our food finally arrived and we bounced out of there quickly to get to dart practice. Opening up the food, I found the Silver Platter burger worth every cent and it was a giant rollercoaster of bacon, cheese, mushrooms, caramelized onion and juiciness. It really was a MONSTER.

2008-05-31,3.0,"My first, and main issue with this place is: Why do they call it Riverview Tavern? It's a pretty long hike to the river from there. And before the other reviewers give me sass, I did my homework (thanks Google) and learned about Riverview park, which is neat and cute and all, but seriously, change the name. History is old. The future is new. So anyway, minus 1 star there. Then there was this thing at the bar where my friend ordered some Maker's Mark, but they had to give him Beam 'cause they were out. And even though he asked if it was cheaper, they still charged him the same. But (SPOILER WARNING) Jim Beam IS cheaper than Maker's Mark. So they should have comped him the drink or at least not been awkward. So minus another star there. The draft special was good price -- at the time I went it was Goose Island Summer Ale. Four pints of those took me to the mat really quick. So plus a star on beer prices. I have to take off one more star because the crowd was just so-so. I was there with a few friends which definitely made for a good time, but otherwise the patrons consist of people who don't look like they know what they're doing. Like if you had a bunch of friends in town and they all wanted to go somewhere different you might take 'em here just because nobody can complain if you at least go somewhere.

I find these to usually be lacking in something the kids menu kraft singles grilled cheese sandwiches (dipped in ketchup) of my youth always had. Maybe it was grease, maybe it was just my immature palate. Without wanting to make the Riverside grilled cheese sound unnecessarily artery-clogging (as I don't believe it is), it properly welcomed me into adult-hood grilled cheese sandwiches with just the right amount of melty melty cheese and butter (and I didn't even pick the tomatoes out!) The fries sat next to it, offering a little bit of recognizable comfort in case the thicker cut bread (with those holes fancy bread gets) became too intimidating. The fries are the type that get kinda crunchy crispy on the outside, like onion rings at times, but still remained very much in the realm of potato products. Not those gross pale-yellow sogfests that some restaurants serve. We sat outside, which was really lovely except after 11 they make you move inside.

Riverview is the place to stop in and have a few drinks with your friends either after work, or after a ball game with a your rec. league team.",0.9151,0.763,0.205,0.032,0.47232142857142856
