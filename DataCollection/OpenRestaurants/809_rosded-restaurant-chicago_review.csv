Pretty empty for a Sunday lunch so service was good. Food came out fast. First Thai restaurant I've been to that has different price for Thai tea with or without ice, with or without condensed milk. You can either pay $5 or $2, depending on what you get on it. Interesting concept.  Every table has condiment jars with pickled peppers, dried chili peppers.

We went there today to confirm that it wasn't in fact just nostalgia driving this claim. Alas, this hole-in-the-wall does have the best fish of my young 22-year-old life. We shared the red snapper with basil and chilies. Crisped to perfection and generously doused with a spicy sugar glaze, this dish really hit it out of the park. When my mom went three decades previously, they served the whole fish bones and all. Now, it's just the filet, which makes for an easier, albeit slightly less authentic eat.  Our server also recommended a mango rice desert for a light summer treat. The green rice is colored with pandan, a tropical leaf. Coated with sweet coconut milk, the warm rice pairs well with the cool mango. I don't even care that I left the place a few pounds heavier, because everything was so incredibly fresh and full-bodied.

2014-07-19,1.0,"This review is geared towards the food only, as I've only ordered takeout. I've tried the red and panang curries, both with tofu. The Good: The red curry was just average. Very mild with your standard red curry flavor. There was a smattering of red and green bell peppers and a surfeit of bamboo pieces (straws? strips? they were thin like linguine and short--kind of annoying). The tofu was cut into thick blocks, which were way too ungainly to eat whole, or even halved. I'm not too particular about the shape/size of the tofu, but it is an important component to consider when it makes up 50-70% of your curry contents. The Bad: As for the panang curry, I'm sad to report that it was completely inedible. The flavor was absolutely repulsive. I tried to keep an open mind and give it a few tries--maybe this is what panang should taste like? maybe I've been deceived by ALL the other panang curries I've tried over the years at VARIOUS establishments--but no, it was just as foul-tasting the second, third, and fourth tastes. Too bad, Rosded, this is a dealbreaker. To top it off, I was unimpressed with the ratio of tofu to vegetable (which was all tofu and no vegetable, practically). It looked like an entire block of tofu was swimming in curry. The Ugly: My ultimate beef is with the rice portions. They give you one small scoop of rice. Small as in ""we're rationing rice because it is wartime and the government asked its citizens to make drastic cuts""-small. It was nowhere near enough to accompany an entire bowl of curry. Pretty stingy, Rosded. I used two of your ""portions"" for one dish. Conclusion:  I will not be patronizing this restaurant in the future. It boils down to the curry being such a let-down, the rice portions abysmally small, and the fact that they aren't on the Seamless app and don't seem to have an updated menu online anywhere.

2014-06-27,1.0,"My partner and I were wandering the area looking for a new restaurant to eat at. We always love Thai cuisine and the reviews for this place seemed alright. Well we were sadly mistaken.  As we walked in we were crammed between a two door entrance which was quite unnecessary. No one said hello or greeted us so we sat ourselves down and the waitress came to us and gave us menus. My partner ordered the green curry with chicken and I ordered the chicken fried rice. For one I'm pretty sure that green curry is not suppose to have an oily film , nor be filled with a ton of spices to make it inedible with an overbearing taste of jelapenos. And my chicken fried rice was in fact not fried rice. It was white rice that they threw some stuff on, and barely any veggies.  As we continued to eat I examined the restaurant as a whole. The walls were dirty, the windows were uncleaned, and the tables had all mismatching chairs. When it came time to pay, we looked over to find her eating her food (which wasn't even the restaurant food.. Food from home) and talking with her friend while texting. We had to call her over to get our check. When sh came by, she asked if we needed a box which we kindly replied no thank you and smiled but she walked away with a rude attitude and brought the check.

This place was average but could maybe be better if we ordered other things. I got my usual crazy spicy noodles and also sampled the pad thai. The menu is kinda funny because it just says ""vegetables"" instead of actually telling you what's in each dish, so every noodle dish just reads ""noodles, vegetables, egg"". My particular iteration of spicy noodles had cabbage in it, which was a surprise. Anyway taste was good but slightly less flavorful than the other thai places in town (literally just down the street), and definitely less spicy. They have some sauces on the table, maybe I should have played with those. Also the food came out nice and hot.

No.  My experiences have been up and down like all of the other numerous area Thai spots.  On the one hand, you have crispy shrimp rolls, plain but delicious.  On the other hand, you have really bland pad thai with lots of tofu but barely any peanuts.  Where are the peanuts, yo?  They must be saving them all for the rama noodles, which come doused in a peanut-coconut sauce which is actually pretty good but very heavy-handed.  Tom yam soup is enjoyable but unexceptional.  Plain old stir-fried mixed vegetables might actually be the best thing that I have found.

The noodles are a bit drier and more flavorful than most Pad Thai. Although this quality is not consistent. On a few visits we did get wetter noodles, we noticed during those times are when the restaurant is more packed.

2012-01-22,3.0,"Its that time of month again! No, not that one. Its the time of month that my husband and I visit Chicagoland for an exhausting combination of (mainly) work and some fun. The fun part is typically limited to trying out a new place for dinner. Either I love food way too much, or my fun-o-meter is easily filled. You decide. Excited about the cultural melting pot the windy city is, we once again opted for an Asian dinner. So i quickly detached my phone from my figurative hip, and pulled up my trusty Yelp app.  ""Best authentic Thai"" in ""Chicago, IL"". Long list of restaurants? Check.  Always on the lookout for a small, hole-in-the-wall kinda place I figured I'd narrow it down to one dollar. After reading a couple of reviews (and running out of time on the express way) I navigated hubby to this highly regarded Thai restaurant in what appears to be a predominantly German neighborhood, go figure!  Imported Bavarian ""May-tree"" across the street, and all. Once inside I could only agree with previous reviewers, this place is indeed small, yet appeared to be surface clean *yay*. An official looking plaque hangs on the wall stating the maximum occupancy is 27, exceeding this number is 'hazardous and unlawful'. That should give you an idea as to the size of the dining room!  We started our meal off with a fresh cold spring roll with peanutsauce and an order of tom yum soup. Both were pretty good, the soup had a nice level of.sourness to it whereas the springroll was slightly on the bland side. The peanutsauce which is served atop is sweet and chunky. Very peanut-y, unfortunately I could not pick up on any other flavors such as lemongrass or a hint of spice or even creaminess. I am a fan of the more complex kind of peanutsauces. Sorry.  I have never been to Thailand, so I cannot speak for the authenticity of any of the dishes on the menu, or the items served. What I do know, is that my husbands Rosded special stir fry (I forgot the name, shame on me) had NO spice when ordered Hot, and the sauce itself tasted more American-Chinese than any Thai I have ever had. It faintly reminds me of your standard lo-mein flavor profile.  Another thing I know is that the green beans that came in this dish were raw, and the onions were very strong. Cooked at higher heat and for a little longer, the natural and delicious sweetness of this bulbous veggie wouldve come out and wouldve actually complimented the slightly sweet sauce, quite well. Lastly, I have a terrible petpeeve with corny shaped vegetables. You know, the run-of-the-mill and cheap-looking star/gear shaped carrots for example. Yeah, they were definitely represented! Also, their mushrooms are shaped like a certain male organ, which I hardly doubt is their fault- but entertaining nonetheless. Now, hubby enjoyed the overall flavor of the dish, so I am happy that he was happy! After studying Yelp (and the menu), I decided to go with the panang beef, ordered hot. My first plate came out like pieces of beef under a.layer.of.oil. Not appealing. When I asked the waiter if this dish is always served like this, I was told it was due to the peanutbutter? I will post a picture, and you can judge yourself about the plausibility of that claim. The sweet man immediately offered to reduce it, and the second plate came out MUCH better, see pic.  One bite and I was pleasantly surprised. The ghost of oilygreasypiecesofmeatgrossness made room for flavors that quite honestly danced on my tongue. Coconut, peanut, curry, basil and ireallydontcarewhatelse was a very satisfying combination that had me picking at my food long after I had reached the point of fullness.  Panang beef, definately a must try here! Friendly if not a little a slow service, low prices and pretty good food.

I absolutely love Thai food but was accompanied by two newbies, so I felt it was important to take them someplace legit. Forget atmosphere; Rosded is tiny and unimpressive in that department. The service is friendly, but not over the top. It does not matter. The food is to die for. Rosded has wonderful tom yum soup, and their cucumber salad is refreshing and delicately dressed. I am not a fan of cucumbers, so I have always ignored cucumber salad, but for some reason I tried it today. Much to my surprise, I was literally shoveling them into my mouth. Wonderful. The shrimp shumai came with 2 different dipping sauces, both of which we enjoyed, and the pork satay was moist and flavorful. (Side note: satay comes with a small side of cucumber salad, but you may just need to spend $2 and spring for a 2nd heaping portion.) The pad thai and pad woon sen were among the best I have had, but the real tantalizer was the dish I asked to be delivered extra spicy: the thai basil noodles with beef and wide noodles. The combination of the jalepeno, chili, ground beef, and basil was unlike anything I have ever experienced. My senses actually felt heightened while I was eating this. The noodles were thick and almost like a dumpling in taste and texture, with a slight browned top like a marshmallow. My taste buds were dancing with this one.

It just sort of fell off our radar. The main reason we came back is because they have ""the best pad thai"" that my girlfriend has ever tasted...and she wanted to see if it still was top dog. With the pad thai on it's way, I ordered the pork larb salad [which is essentially minced pork with red onions, pepper flakes, and mint on a bed of lettuce]. The pad thai is quite different than what I've tasted at other thai joints: it's sweet. Not a bad thing, but it was surprising to me. It also lacked most of the other ingredients typically found in pad thai [an abundant amount of bean sprouts, carrots, cabbage, etc]. So, I thought it was okay. It did, however, bring back memories for the girlfriend, who thought it tasted just as she remembered. The service was ok. The waitress was not very talkative or anything. She did refill our drinks often. Besides taking our order, there was no communication exchanged. Overall, food was good, service was ehh.

Actually, nothing spectacular about the beef meatballs--about the same as we get for home from another Asian grocery joint, but good.

It was like a pile of plain, barely cooked veggies on plain, unsauced rice. WTF. i could have ""cooked"" this at home in 3 minutes. The reason I LOVE Thai food is because of the complex spiciness, the lemoniness, the slight fishiness, the veginess...yeah this had none of that.  Sad, I won't be returning. I'd rather go to Royal Thai, Spoon, opart, Oscar, or Kan Pou any day.",-0.1373,0.782,0.105,0.113,0.552420634920635

The entrees here were the real treat.  I got the Thai Crazy Noodles, which were spiced well with noodles that were ever-so-slightly springy and soaked in a delicious brown sauce.  My husband got Spicy Basil Squid, and he loved the fact that it was actually spicy.  I don't usually like squid but this stuff was incredibly tender, especially considering the price.

Other reviewers, most of whom seem to be fond of pad thai in general, have complained that Rosded's is too saucy, but I think that's exactly why I liked it. The salmon curry, a house specialty, was off-the-charts good. The pad kee mao with tofu, one of the dishes by which I often gauge a Thai restaurant, was merely good. The deliciousness of all the other dishes, however, inspired in me the goodwill to overlook a weakness that would cause me to write off many Thai places.

I don't go far out of my way to go here, but I have no problem meeting someone there when they name it as a place they'd like to meet for dinner. The service has always been decent and generally friendly (they'd have to be really crappy to not be able to maintain the 6-8 tables that they have there). One of the reasons why I decided not to give a 4-Star rating, was that there is really nothing on the menu that sticks out as excellent. Usually good Thai restaurants have one dish that really sticks out as exceptional... but nothing really does here. If you're in the mood for decently priced, very standard Thai food... this is the place for you... but if you're looking for a place that is going to impress... this is probably not the best choice out there.",0.7837,0.79,0.13,0.081,0.545250626566416
2007-06-05,4.0,you might miss this tiny thai place in lincoln square among all the overpriced boutiques and german bars. but its oh so good. the food is authentic and not the same old stuff you can find anywhere. the service is a little iffy and the atmosphere is nothing. but the food makes up for it entirely. try the tom yum noodle soup (no sugar) or kao mok kai with chicken. the dipping sauce is soooooo good. give it a shot.,0.8984,0.867,0.118,0.015,0.485
2007-04-19,5.0,"This is hands down the best Thai restaurant in the city. If you want slick decor, this is not you place. If you want friendly service and the largest selection of the best Thai food, you have got to check this out. Pad Thai is perfect (I have found none better), Tom Ka Chicken soup is the only thing my wife could eat while she was pregnant (the ginger I guess) and the Cat fish is a 2 times a year indulgence (it can not be good for you)! It's a hole in the wall atmosphere, but one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.",0.9107,0.834,0.15,0.016,0.6094907407407408
2007-01-24,5.0,"The yummiest and cheapest Thai place in Chicago.  Just thinking about the Rama noodles (soft rice noodles in a peanut-infused coconut curry) makes my mouth water.  You don't usually associate comfort food with exotic cuisines, but this is among the best comfort food I've ever tasted.  Other dishes, like fried noodles, salads, and soups, are also top notch. They've recently added Thai soft drinks to the menu, which are a lot of fun.",0.9257,0.765,0.185,0.05,0.3972222222222223

2006-12-12,3.0,"This place rates for its good Thai food and very good prices.  I had lunch here, Chicken Rama Noodle for 5.95, no sides included however...  could have been spicier.  The bad Air Supply song courtesy of liteFM was just low enough so that if you were having a conversation you wouldn't be annoyed by it.  The place is small probably about 12 tables, all adorned with paisley and flower pattern tablecloths covered with plastic.  The little pagoda over the kitchen did not make up for the lack of atmosphere. If you are ordering take-out, bump the rating up to 4 stars",0.2924,0.799,0.11,0.091,0.6107407407407408
2006-10-08,4.0,"Very good Thai food at really cheap prices. They had a lot more dishes on their menu than I have seen at other places. I had the mussaman curry, which was quite tasty, and an appetizer with sweet and crispy noodles which good as well. I would definitely recommend this place.

2006-09-06,4.0,"Good Thai food. No Atmosphere, and service is hit and miss. Went there with a friend today for lunch, and it was just okay. I'm Thai, and spent about 4 years inThailand, and some of their menu items are very authentic. However, some of their menu items were totally made up. (which I don't mind). This place is cheap, and good food. Try the Panang with Shrimp($8) or the Shrimp rolls($4). I would skip the BBQ pork rice dish ($6) if you don't like sweet sauce all over everything on your plate. This is a good place for a quick lunch, but wouldn't bother for dinner or when trying to impress.",0.8628,0.81,0.136,0.053,0.5974999999999999

2006-04-25,4.0,"The Lincoln Square area is known for the German influences in its shops & restaurants, but if you take a good look around, you might be surprised to find that Thai is one of the more prevalent types of cuisine available in that area, there are at least four Thai restaurants within short walking distance of the Western stop on the Brown Line.  Rosded is one of the older Thai establishments in that area, the dining room is small & has a hole-in-the-wall decor, but the Pad Thai is among the best I've ever ordered. Prices are pretty cheap too. The folks that run the place are very polite & friendly.",0.9648,0.808,0.17,0.023,0.4422222222222222
