The Pad Prik King which is basically sautéed green beans with minced meat in a curry sauce was also undercooked, but tolerable. I tend to like my veggies on the raw side anyway. The sauce seemed generic and canned. It's probably the same brand my family buys from the Thai grocery, but we have enough sense to add extra flavors to the mass manufactured concoction.  At least dessert was good. The Kowtom Mudt (banana & coconut sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf was sweet, aromatic and steamy.

This place is the real deal and I want to come back ASAP!! We ordered: - Tom Yum w/ Shrimp: I've never been a huge fan of Tom Yum at most Thai places because I always get it was too sour. Their soup here reminded me of the Tom Yum that we hand made in our cooking class by hand making the stock from lemon grass and kaffir like leaves. So fresh and fragrant! - Shrimp in Blanket:'Admittedly probably not the most authentic thing but we love shrimp, so.... it was pretty delicious. Super crispy with great sauce.  - Kow Soy: AKA THE thing you have to eat in Chiangmai. The portion size was humongous and difficult to finish. The flavor? Just like I remembered it. Smooth and creamy curry with chewy and crunchy noodles.  - Gang Hung Lay: Recommended by the waiter, and my personal favorite dish of the bunch. Super tender braised pork cooked in a rich chili paste sauce. Definitely adding this to my list of favorite Thai dishes.

The name sake sticky rice was a great accompaniment to the various items. However the pineapple curry left me desiring more.

When the three of us walked in and sat down, we informed the lady it was our first time here. ""Ok"" was her response. Ok no big deal. Maybe not a talker. She watched us struggle with 1000 item menu and didn't come offer to help at all. We didn't really know what to get, and were gunna try Thai items that we usually do not get. I heard great things of their authenticity. We ordered 2 northern that sausages (1 would have been enough), large Tom Yum (small would have done), larb chicken, kai soi, pad Thai, nam prik king, and fried rice. Needless to say, she didn't tell us we ordered way too much food. And that wasn't really the problem. Hey, it was my first time here and I wanted a bit of everything.  Let me start with food. Sausage. Damn good and almost gamey. The soup. Eh. Average. Larb. Worst larb I ever ate. Not sure what the crunchy crap in there was, but it had to go. And not enough lime flavor. Kai Soi. I've had better and more authentic tasting (per someone who tried dan Thai and frequents Thailand often). Prik king. It was ok. The pad Thai. Average again. The fried rice was damn good though So when it came to packing up leftovers, we tried to help her out by giving her 1 or 2 dishes at a time as we continued to eat other things. As there were 3 of us, we asked to pack the rice and pad Thai in 3 separate containers. She gave a pissed off look and took it back to the counter. Signaled over a coworker, and told her out outrageous request. These bitches brought the food back to our table and threw 6 boxes down and said they were busy and to do it ourself. 1) they packed up other stuff for us 3 minutes before. And 2) there were only 3 other tables occupied. Now this shit just set me off. I mean we ordered around $100 worth of food, and they couldn't pack it up for us. And to top it off, as we struggled to do it ourself, they just stood. Who do the counter and watched us as we spilled a noodle or two on the table.

I have been to other restaurants where the price is the same, and  get half of what was served here.  Plus, they do not skimp on ingredients. My party ordered the pad thai with chicken and there was plenty of chicken to go around, unlike other places that only scatter about 3-4 tiny pieces for a large dish.  The spicy red curry was really spicy so if you like spice make sure you specify how spicy. Its refreshing to go to a place where they really do not kid around with their spiciness.. The bao we had was also very good.  Their menu is pretty extensive more so than other Thai restaurants, so there is definitely a lot of things to check out.  Although my review is based on the two dishes we had, they are basic thai dishes and for us, they exceeded on flavor and quality and made us want to return and check out their other dishes.

Garlic spare ribs: Tender ribs topped with a delicious garlic powder-- highly recommend eating this one with rice.  Nam prik khing red snapper: My favorite of the night. The fish was cooked so that it was a little crispy, and it was topped with a spicy, slightly sweet sauce as well as a generous serving of string beans.  Kow soy: Super fragrant coconut flavors in the curry as well as a generous portion of noodles. Sticky rice with taro: True to its namesake, this was delicious.

2016-11-05,2.0,"Review #219 - 2016 Upon my excitement before coming to Chicago, I decided to bookmark Sticky Rice since they had so many good reviews and I saw a good list of dishes that I know I would enjoy. We were greeted nicely when we arrived, seated right away because there were only 2 other tables there before us and given some iced water along with the menus. Of course, being the Thai/Lao food snob that I am, my friend was more than happy to let me do the ordering.  Which I definitely did!  I pretty much over ordered because there were so many items that I wanted to try. I ordered the Northern Thai Combo Set which consisted of some e-san sausages, which was probably the best item out of the entire combo set, pork rinds, two home-made dipping sauce to eat with the mixed veggies (which I am used to seeing them served steamed at other restaurants; however, they were not), along with a side of sticky rice.  The nam prik nhum was just ok; however, the nam prik ong was super salty.  Even when I ate it with a lot of rice, it was still too salty. The ""nam kao tod"" which is the crispy fried rice salad was super sour.  It was drenched in a whole lot of lime juice.  Also, the fermented pork tasted old and you can tell by the color that it's not pink, but rather it was almost a white hue. The crab papaya salad was overly sweet.  In general, the crab papaya is supposed to be very savory with a hint of fish sauce and lime juice. The crying tiger was the most disappointing of them all.  In Thailand, the crying tiger is made with a tender steak cut and cooked medium to medium well, never over dry.  It somehow tasted more like BBQ beef versus a salad. I guess I kind of knew in the back of my mind that the food was not going to taste anything like the Northern Thai taste because the chef is Mexican.  Not that I was being pre-judgmental or anything, but I've had a few bad experiences with Asian food that are not cooked by their respective chef. Maybe the Northern Thai dishes are a miss because it seems like people who ordered just the regular Thai dishes were happy with the food.  Unfortunately, I will never find out since we pretty much wasted about half of the food I ordered even though we were pretty hungry & I actually left hungry.

But it wasn't. From the staff to the food, this restaurant screams authentic Thai cuisine. Okay, since I said that, I do have to put a * and say that the plating was very well done, better than I would have expected of a traditional thai restaurant. I personally had the basil ground pork over rice (For $9.50 without tax+tip), which was excellent. I asked for it ""spicy hot"" which packed quite a punch, which I loved. The flavors were so similar to that I had when I was in Thailand previously and it really brought back great memories. To add on to that, the portions were generous. I didn't expect it. I had enough for a small but hearty meal the next day. The flavors were just the same, and brought back the same joy and excitement I had the day prior.

2016-05-22,5.0,"Sticky Rice is a clean, bright, authentic, no-nonsense Northern Thai restaurant. This is absolutely NOT the place where you can expect to be waited on hand-and-foot. You get a very real-world, non-Westerner level of service here. But what else are you expectin', huh? The menu provided is beyond massive, and, at 12 or so plus, small-printed pages, their menu is a bonafide tome of both standard, pretty typical Thai cuisine like Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai, and Pad See Ew and then the adventurous and fun stuff (aka Northern Thai food). Do yourself a dang favor and get fun! Be adventurous! Do you want the real deal? Do you want to try traditional, yet flavorful foods? Then please, for the love of food, honestly, do try the Northern Thai-centric menu. Sure. Sure. Sure. You can go safe and go the Pad Thai route (which -- truth be told -- I tend to go that way myself). But why deny yourself a potentially grand adventure? Try something different.  Let me break it down for you in a 3 Step Plan: 1. For your first dunk into the Northern Thai menu, go dip your toe lightly into the shallow end and try the Northern Thai sausage -$3 a piece. It is a mild, red curry accented pork sausage with pork skin and spicy herbs and served with slivered red cabbage, ginger, and minced cilantro. In short, it is the perfect introductory appetizer for any newbies.  2. Next, for those feeling braver, may I suggest the Nam Prik Ong -$8.95- and a side of sticky rice -$1.75. The Nam Prik Ong is a traditional Northern Thai, bit viscous, chili-based, pork and tomato dip that is served with chopped broccoli, carrots, green beans, and cabbage leaves. Sticky Rice describes it as a ""Northern Thai version of bolognese""... And guess what??? It totally was like a Thai bolognese. Using your hands to shape a small round of sticky rice, you scoop up some of the Nam Prik Ong. And experience a totally addictive, tomato-y, porky, delicate, yet smoky whisper of spice. Not at all overwhelmingly so. Eat. This. Now. 3. When you're ready to leave the shallow end, go plunge to the deep end. Seriously, submerge yourself. And try the Nam Crispy Rice - $8.50. The Nam Crispy Rice (i.e. Naem Khao Thawt or Nam Kao Tod) is a Thai salad that consists of crumbled, crispy, curried rice croquettes, fermented pork sausage (naem), slivered pork skin, dried chilies, shallots, cilantro, shredded carrot and ginger, and peanuts scattered over a bed of red lettuce. And, man, oh, man, is it the best damn salad ever. The tang of the fermented pork sausage + the freshness of the cilantro + the soft bite of the ginger + the gentle heat of the chilies + the beautiful interplay of textures from the crispy rice croquettes and everything else = pure, unadulterated food bliss.  Once you forego the standard fare and try the fun side of Northern Thai cuisine, you won't want to go back. I promise.",0.9975,0.81,0.173,0.017,0.553670634920635

2016-03-13,4.0,"We came to have lunch at this Northern Thai restaurant based on a recommendation from a good friend. During our visit, the atmosphere of this small establishment was quiet and unassuming. The décor included bright colored walls and a number of cultural artifacts. There were plenty of tables closely stacked, and enough sunlight to keep the place vibrant and well lit.  For appetizer, the Basil Pork Salapao ($1.75) and the Panang Beef Salapao ($1.75) were flat out delicious. The buns were freshly made, not too thick, and doughy enough to render a good chew. There was plenty of basil pork stuffing that came with a flagrant basil aroma. Equally addictive was the beef rendition with a sharp, complex curry flavor. I could have eaten a few more of these, and can't wait to return to try their BBQ Pork Salapao. The Northern Thai Larb ($8.95) came with stir-fried ground pork, pork intestine, fried shallots, and Thai spicy herb serve with fresh veggies. The spicy savory profile was explosive, and nicely accompanied by a good number of fresh veggies. It was a heavier dish than expected, but the range of textures and flavors nicely contrasted our serving of Sticky Rice ($1.75). The Gang Hung Lay ($9.50) was cooked with pork, garlic, ginger, and northern style hung lay chili paste. There was a good amount of pork cooked in a range of rich, sharp, and complex ingredients. In particular, the hung lay curry flavor was spicy and complex, and nicely embedded in the pork which was thick cut and easy to chew. Service was patient, friendly, and attentive. Overall, I thought the dishes were authentically executed, and spicy enough that we didn't have to use the side of prik nam pla.

Unfortunately, the food went from great to lackluster as the dishes kept coming out from the kitchen. We started with the Thai sausage, which was incredible! I never knew the northern Thai people even had a sausage specialty; now it's one of my favorite sausages! If only Hot Doug's had done this when they were in business... My entree, the gang hung lay pork dish, was decent. The sauce had some great flavors - tamarind, ginger, curry - but wasn't most satisfying portion. The mediocre portion sizes led everyone in my group to order the pineapple fried rice to share, since we were all still a bit hungry. This dish was sadly disappointing. They seem to oversalt/season the dish, yet serve it with the sweet pineapple. Not a good flavor balance. Also, the pineapple itself seemed to really obscure the size of the dish, as the serving isn't nearly as large as it looks when served.

They received their appetizer right away while I was still waiting on mine.  A group of 5 came in after we ordered and sat to my immediate right. I had previously asked about my appetizer was told they were working on it- the server never got back to me. They ordered and received their appetizers while the table on my right received their entree.  I was still waiting on fried tofu and I had been in the restaurant for 25 minutes at that point. I was very hungry and both tables that arrived and ordered after me had food. When I asked why, I was just told it was still being worked on.  I didn't get an answer, so I left and went to Dragon Lady Lounge, where I waited less than 10 minutes after entering to have food in front of me.  I will never attempt eating here again- they were less than 1/2 full and couldn't manage to get me my appetizer before the two tables that were seated after me.

Pad Thai is one of those staple Thai dishes that people of my translucent coloring flock for and it's a dish I feel like I can easily use to compare Thai places. With Sticky Rice's dish being subpar, it just sets the tone for the whole meal. The Chicken Pad See Ewe is one of my go tos and it was decent though not the best I've had. The dish was not as mind blowing as I had expected. The chicken curry was another mediocre dish and my partner wasn't even interested in finishing it.

2015-03-01,1.0,"I went to this restaurant thinking it was going to be decent thai food yesterday. It was not and here are the reasons. I got the green curry with chicken, and all the chicken were at the very bottom of the sauce and sliced very thickly. It was very dry and hard in texture, even less tasty than rotisserie chicken, I have better experiences with boston market. The positioning of the food makes me think they just dumped it all at the bottom without letting it mix with the sauce beforehand. Furthermore their slices of bamboo was really thick, and that made up 80% of their cup sized container. They didn't put enough other ingredients in it, there were around 2-3 pieces of pepper which makes it obvious they skimp on good ingredients and compromise on the dining experience just to save a buck. Coming at a price tag of around $9, the food was overpriced. They have good ambience, so you're paying for that rather than quality food. Their food tasted kind of funky too, all of the thai food I've gotten before at other places was a mixture of savory and slightly sweet, but theirs was just plan savory, I've seen other people's dishes. Their's looked appetizing, their presentation seemed good, so I'm not entirely sure if it would have been worth it to eat in. Though judging from the quality of takeout food, not sure if the quality of food will be any higher even with sit down food. Coming from flushing New york, my expectations of thai food is really high. The best thai I've had though, was a around New Haven.  There is a good thai place that is reasonably priced around 7-8 dollars and tasted better than this place, it was around ATB or ATM mechanics or something like that around Hodgkins? Hopkins? Hoggins? road? can't remember. Their store is smaller but they give decent amount of food for the price, good mixture of ingredients, though one pepper was kind of heterogeneously soggy and therefore not fresh..

Haven't had the chance to visit Thailand just quite yet, but do have friends who are Thai and you better believe I have been over for dinner many times. So I'm using those dinners to base my review of the food. When I think of Thai, I think of 1. Papaya Salad, 2. Tom-Kha, and 3. My go-to dish, Ka-Prao chicken.  I came here on a Friday night with two of my coworkers after a long day at work. It was around  6:15 pm. Luckily we didn't have to wait for a table. Between the 3 of us we shared a papaya salad medium spicy. Pad thai beef, Tom-kha chicken, ka-prow chicken, and a beef pad seew.  Food came out very quick. The papaya salad was okay. Could have used a little bit more fish sauce and a lot more heat. I was expecting it to be thai spicy when I ordered medium. The rest of our dishes followed quickly. The tom-kha was perfect for the cold night. Pad thai was good. My ka-prow chicken was a little on the saltier side. If it wasn't for the rice I probably wouldn't have been able to get through it. Was very happy that they had an option for brown rice though. Overall, I think that pad seew was my favorite. It had great flavor, the beef was tender and seasoned well. It also had this taste that my friends mom explained to me as being ""big fire"". The taste of pad seew being made in a high heated wok that is only accomplished by certain types of stove.

Ambiance: 0/10 After a brief seat at our table I am overcome with feelings of childhood nostalgia. Remember that prank where you trick somebody into supergluing their hand to a school desk? Yeah, that kind of nostalgia. Following a slight struggle I managed to forcefully peel my forearms from whatever residual substance had adhered them to the table. I sifted through the expectedly large menu -- still with naive enthusiasm at this point. This is when I noticed that the unidentified sap from the table had caused the humorously archaic disposable placemat to fuse to my arm. Terrific. I placed my order for ginger beef and sought refuge in the bathroom to wash the syrup-like glue off my arms, attempting to preserve as much of my armhair intact as possible. I am perplexed by the pleasantly neutral smell of the bathroom, which only compounds my confusion about the still lingering smell of the dining room. After returning to the table I rolled down my sleeves and set up a perimeter of paper placemats to prevent any more premature hairloss. Improvise, adapt and overcome. The food arrives just as my stomach begins to grumble, and I excitedly take a nice heap of ginger beef into my mouth and a nice breath of the aroma to soak it all in. Just as the tag team champion duo of Ginger and Basil are preparing to bodyslam my olfactory senses into a world of bliss a challenger approaches. Ginger and Basil combined are no match for the opposition and fall flat on their backs as the dominating force of Expired Beef takes the belt. The championship ceremony is cut short as the whole match is ejected from my mouth back onto my plate. What a shame. Looks like its plain rice for lunch.",0.9833,0.8,0.141,0.059,0.5886507936507938

The menu is extensive but I have my go to dishes that I always order.  The prices are real reasonable the portions are good sizes to share family style. Duck Pad See Ew- is the best I have ever had.  I really enjoy the duck, the meat and skin really compliment the dish perfectly. Kar Nom Jeem- it's a green curry noodle dish with chicken.  This is a dish that is hard to find at other Thai places. Tastes great with rice Garlic Pepper Spare Ribs- the meat is soft and falls right of the bone in garlicy goodness.  Taste great with rice. Warning: Watch out for Thai spiciness because they don't mess around.  I just get everything mild and add whatever spice I  want.  For dessert I suggest the coconut milk pancakes with corn and green onion.  But ask them to make it fresh because with mine I can tell they pre made it and just nuked it which changed the gooey texture I like.  Also don't forget your Thai Iced Coffee or Iced Tea :) I normally order Pad Thai wherever I go but I tried it here and was the only thing I wasn't impressed by so just stick to my go tos",0.9954,0.738,0.232,0.03,0.6017715419501134

2014-08-24,5.0,"Our family decided to eat here  on a vacation to Chicago. Now, five years ago, we all stayed for a few months in Chiang Mai which is a city in northern Thailand. This is a northern Thai restaurant that perfectly recreated the dining experience there. We ordered: - Kow Soy (Khao Soi) : a noodly spicy chicken dish of wonder, based upon reddish curry and coconut milk, topped with cilantro and crunchy noodles. Had the exact same kick as in Chiang Mai and the spices were perfect. - Pad See Ewe: a brown wide noodle dish with meat and well cooked greens... not spicy at all, but very, very flavorful. Somehow combines melt in your mouth with rice noodles. Again, both authentic and excellent. - Massamun Curry: Like coconut milk? This one's for you. Served piping hot with jasmine rice, it includes potatoes, peanuts, and an incredibly rich coconut-inundated curry sauce. Almost too much for some, but amazing nevertheless. We also got the Moo Ping (pork on stick) for appetizers and Thai Iced Tea to drink. If you've never had the sweetness that is Thai Iced Tea, this is a good place. We did not try the desserts here. And, as if icing was needed on this cake, the meals were all under $10 in price, and $6-7 was a common sight. The menu is huge, so everyone can be happy. For our family, this meant ordering some of our favorite foods from our Chiang Mai adventure and feeling a night of communal nostalgia.

However, since Sticky Rice is known for its northern cuisine, my friends and I decided to order some staples and new dishes. To start, we ordered some tom yum and tom kha soup, which everyone seemed to enjoy (even my friends that were trying it for the first time and found it a little smelly). They weren't the best that I've ever had, but definitely satisfied my craving. Next, we ordered a bunch of dishes to share, which included nam prik ong, pad see ewe, pad woon sen, green curry, and a basil bamboo dish. Everything was really tasty and it was nice to try a variety of dishes. I've never had nam prik ong before, but this was really good. Some of my friends found it a little spicy though, so it was nice that we ordered mild and spicy dishes.

I believe everyone was happy in the end, although it took a lot longer than usual for my kids to decide which dish to try in their super long menu. I ended up ordering a couple of fried appetizers (egg rolls and fried prawns) because my kids like fried stuff. They wolfed them down and wanted more. Luckily the entrees were right on their heels and we dug in ravenously.  I had the Kow Soy, and I'm so glad that I asked for the mild version. I feel like I can handle spicy things, but even the mild Kow Soy left a spicy tingle in my mouth after eating it. The vegetable thai fried rice was probably the best fried rice I've ever had. I love that it came with a fried egg sitting on top and that the vegetables were obviously fresh.  The only disappointment, for my children and not for me, was that they found a hard time getting anything that wasn't spicy for their entrees. They ended up ordering two fish dishes and asked them to put the sauce on the side. This worked out well for my son because he liked the sweet-and-sour sauce that came with it and he ended up dipping his rice and fish in it. My daughter, however, didn't like the side sauce and so she ended up eating bland salmon. She was a bit unhappy.

Whole fried fish- It was cooked perfectly.  They captured the crispy/tender texture wonderfully.  However, the sauce wasn't very good and kind of ruined it for me.  It reminded me of some kind of generic Chinese sweet and sour with basil thrown in.  Asked for spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all.  Asked for a side of fresh Thai chilies to spice it up and found the problem...they were not spicy at all.  I'm not quite sure how that happens, but I could have eaten them like grapes.  Thus, if your chilies aren't hot, how is anything going to be spicy? Khao Soi- I had read this was the best Khao Soi in Chicago.  I disagree.  The presentation was spot on, but the flavor just wasn't there.  How can this dish be bland??? Massaman Curry- Pretty good. I know I wasn't that positive about the dishes overall, but I would definitely return here just to have the Tom Sum.  It was great!",0.9815,0.687,0.214,0.099,0.6199070707070707

2013-06-04,4.0,"I just recently moved to the Chicago area, and Yelp directed me to try this place. I decided on carryout since the map didn't make the place seem too far away. What followed was an epic 30 minute drive down the freeway with heavy traffic, torrents of rain, lightning, and thunder. My passenger, obviously forgetting that I was driving, was yelping constantly at every distant lightning strike. The scene was set for a delightful meal at home with a show outside the screen door. Matching the weather outside, we decided to shake up our usual order: spring rolls, tom yum chili fried rice, and dry Sukiyaki.  The spring rolls were cooked perfectly, but definitely lacking in the filling... overall, I'd say they were par. I would not order these again. The fried rice was also perfectly cooked and seasoned with the right amount of spice. There were plenty of veggies, and the tofu was nice and firm. I thought the ginger was a little heavy in this dish. The dry sukiyaki was absolutely delicious. I have never had a dish like this before, and hope to come across it again. The noodles were so flavorful, and again, veggies and tofu were excellent. A couple of notes: This restaurant is extremely vegetarian-friendly, and has a very large menu to choose from, with many dishes I have never seen before. The prices were reasonable as well.

The service was good and it wasn't even crazy crowded on this Friday night.  I guess since it's kind of outside the downtown area and Lincoln Park and those types of neighborhoods it was fine.  It wasn't dead either - it was just right.  One thing I'd say could have been better was that the entrees were served almost immediately after the appetizers; there needed to be more of a gap.  Everyone was still having the soup when the main entrees arrived. So we had a BUNCH of food here; much more than was necessary.  So the veggie dumplings were great.  They were small little things, when compared to the normal sized gyoza that I've had at other places.  Very crispy too, because they were deep fried instead of lightly fried.  Definitely yummy though.  Then we had some Tom Kha soup.  Again, it was good.  Then the best thing I had was the Pad Ke Mow.  Really amazing.  One of the best I've had.  I think I'd get it more spicy, the next time I order it.  Then, the red curry was good.  Usually this is my test of how much I like a new Thai place.  In that sense, the red curry was good.  Not that I can pin down what made it less than great.  It was good.  Lastly, we felt a bit too brave and had decided to push our luck and we ended up ordering some Pad something eggplant item.  This was just kind of... meh...  The only disappointing part of the SR.  Oh yeah, I also had a Thai Iced Coffee, which was good. I have a comment on the $ rating SR has on Yelp.  I think a single $ is not correct.  It was easily a $$.  Maybe they've gone more upscale recently?  That was a bit mis-leading, but obviously not SR's fault.

Second time I went here, food was of a comparable quality but the service was slow and my partner's chair was broken in such a way that when she tried to scoot up to the table, it pinched her hand and drew blood.  Not such a good way to start a meal. The most recent time we were there, my partner ordered her dish with mushrooms and it came out with shrimp.

2013-04-07,5.0,"Since returning from Thailand, I've been cautious of ordering Thai food stateside. Compared to the real deal, it's typically oversauced, overgreased, and underspiced. This is not the case at Sticky Rice; the owners have worked hard to create an authentic Thai dining experience, and the results are spectacular.  The name of the game here is Northern Thai cuisine, which most Americans are not familiar with (most of the dishes we know and love come from central Thailand, or the area around Bangkok). I went the groupthink route and ordered many of the dishes beloved by Yelp; as usual, this lack of adventurousness paid off. Thai northern sausage ($2/sausage), made with pork, pork skin, red curry paste and thai chilis, is spiced distinctively and hotter than Hades. Can't say I've had anything like this before. Gui Chai ($4.95), or chive rice pancakes, are heartier, doughier versions of the delicious bite-sized scallion pancakes that are ubiquitous on the streets of Bangkok. Nam Prik Ong ($6.95), or spicy pork stew with tomatoes, is the Northern Thai version of Texas chili, except many orders of magnitude hotter. It's the perfect dish for a rainy day, and again, you're not likely to find this at a conventional Thai restaurant. It is accompanied perfectly by the restaurant's eponymous sticky rice ($1.50), which is as gratifying to eat as it is difficult to wrest from the spoon you serve it with. For the less adventurous among us, the restaurant's encyclopedic menu does offer a selection of more conventional Thai food; of these selections, pad thai ($6.95) is a well-balanced and comforting take on the beloved classic.  Pricing is almost criminally low. Service is fast and polite. Oh, and it's BYOB, so you can bring in your own hopped-out IPA to pair perfectly with the spicy fare. All in all, Sticky Rice passes the authenticity test; it's safe to say I've found a place that suits my post-Thai adventure snobbery. Although North Center is a pain in the arse to get to, a trip to Sticky Rice is much shorter and less jetlaggy than a trip to Thailand, and is nearly as good.

The sticky rice (the restaurants namesake) is exceptional of course (their sticky rice in banana leaves is pretty good as well!). The waitstaff was friendly and pretty good (although they did get my fiancee's order wrong the first time, but she loved what they did bring her *lol*), and for authentic Thai food, this place has some of the most unique and interesting dishes I have see (their menu is a small novel), and you CAN'T beat the price for value of the place!!

After debating between Chinese, Mexican and Thai- we ended up choosing Sticky Rice based on another friends recommendation!  We ordered the Spring Rolls, Mango Chicken and I had the Green Curry. The spring rolls were tasty, smothered in a plum sauce; they were light and an appropriate start to our meal. My friend had the mango chicken. It was served in the mango shells- beautiful presentation. Based on how quickly my friend devoured the meal, I am pretty sure it was a winner. However, I did not taste it--mostly out of fear of getting stabbed by my friends fork! The green curry was also awesome! Curry, particularly green curry, is my favorite- however some places really f it up by using what taste like caned or frozen mixed vegetables. Sticky Rice uses all fresh veggies and delicious basil which really deepen the flavor!

The inside of the restaurant is really cozy and cute, and the service was attentive. My friend and I went for lunch, and we ordered Thai spring rice rolls, a green curry, and pad thai. The spring rolls had an extremely sweet tamarind sauce on top of all of the rolls. The sauce was overwhelmed all of the other elements of the spring rolls, and I couldn't taste any other flavor except for the sauce. The pad thai also seemed to have some of that same sauce stir fried with the noodles, which made the pad thai very sweet as well. The green curry had the right amount of spice, and I thought the flavors of the curry were executed the most successfully. Overall, I thought there were issues with flavor balance in the dishes~too much sweetness for my taste. I would recommend being adventurous and trying their specialties rather than order what you would typically get at a Thai restaurant",0.9847,0.826,0.174,0.0,0.515850991114149

Their tom yum soup is also good but all the spices are at the bottom and it gets a bit too sour for my liking.  Their service is always good. Water cups are filled in a timely manner. They always bring ice buckets and wine openers.  Only complaint and reason why I'm giving a 4 star is because the seating area in the back by the restrooms always smell like pee.

2012-10-15,5.0,"Acclaimed as being the best Thai restaurant in Chicago, I put Sticky Rice to the test. Being Thai myself and having been to Thailand three times, I wanted to see what Sticky Rice was all about.  Sticky Rice receives five stars for having traditional Thai dishes that you won't find at other restaurants like the mussel fritter (hoi taud), kao soi, and stir fried insects.  Their portions are smaller and the prices are cheap so you can try several dishes on the menu. They also don't hold back on the heat - the flavor tastes 100% authentic.  Their menu is kind of like the Joy Yee's in Chinatown for Thai food where you can easily get lost since there are over 100 items. Like Joy Yee's, some dishes can be highlights where others can be forgettable. Try the items that they are known for rather than what you would normally get at a Thai restaurant. They specialize in northern Thai cuisine which are dishes that go well with sticky rice hence the name. I recommend the Northern style sausage with papaya salad and sticky rice. For a true northern Thai experience, eat the sticky rice with your hands.  Although not the best Thai food that I've had in the Chicagoland area, the meal was still really good. For those in Chicago, this is definitely one of the city's best.",0.9906,0.82,0.171,0.009,0.47412280701754395

These folks offer us authentic dishes and authentic flavors in a casual setting at very reasonable prices ... what's not to love?  I especially like their kao soi -- a thick coconut soup with noodles, chicken and a gentle fire for your belly. I've had kao soi in Chiang Mai many times, and I can happily say that Sticky Rice's reminds me of Thailand as much as any I've ever had -- right down to the touch of perspiration that forms on my brow.  Sticky Rice prepares Thai food with Thai ingredients and with a Thai palate. They do not pander to neophytes as so many American restaurants do, and I love them for that. There are fancier and more expensive Thai restaurants in the US, yes -- but I don't eat that way in Thailand, and I don't roll that way here.

You'd be completely wrong to assume that a durian is some kinda fruit that tastes like strawberry or mango. This fruit, my friends, is an acquired taste that only some, who claims that they love bizzare foods, could take a bite and let it go pass your throat without close to puking. My boyfriend had tried the durian smoothie once in Chinatown and immediately gagged, dejectedly describing the horrible taste to a pair of smelly socks. Fyi, even the renowed Bizzare Foods host, Andrew Zimmern couldn't digest it. Nonetheless, my friend and I are big fans of durians and enjoyed the durian sticky rice that was served warm, unlike the other sticky rice options.

It was SUPER spicy, but I enjoyed every bite through the tears. -Tom Yum Soup- I worked at one of the best Thai restaurants in the Atlanta area, so I'm a bit picky when it comes to tom yum. This version was far too sweet. Knocked my meal down a star. -Gang Hung Lay- Pork curry. OMG I DIE. so good. The pork was so tender, and the curry itself was mouth-watering goodness. I ordered sticky rice to go with my entree and it was a great combination. - Friend ordered some type of barbeque pork noodle dish with soup, which was alright, not great.

Note to self: do not mindlessly shovel food into your mouth, no matter how delicious!  The larb with pork was tasty and the basil fried rice with chicken was more than satisfying.  Everything was incredibly fresh and bright tasting, just the way Thai should be.  My husband, who tends to order on the safe side, enjoyed his egg rolls and crab rangoon.  They were typical, but tasty.  However the Northern Thai sausage really impressed him.  It was spicy and fragrant with yellow curry and is something that I have never encountered before.  The menu is extensive, available online and doesn't seem to separate between the Americanized version and secret Thai selections.  I can't wait to try the rest that Sticky Rice has to offer.",0.9941,0.773,0.206,0.022,0.5579292929292929

YOU TRY TO SAY THAT WORD AND NOT ORDER IT! ""Larb"". It was ground chicken with basil and lime and what the menu said was ""crab salt"". I'm from Maryland and assumed Old Bay Seasoning. I was hella wrong. The ""crab salt"" was a whole crab that had been chopped and stirred into the dish. Now, I didn't know how to EAT said crab, but it put a lovely crabby flavor in my larb - which was also served around a plate of crudié. You know. Raw vegetables. Original, odd, and tasty. The previous time I ate here, I had the green curry. Also incredible and highly recommended. Dining in was good.

The BYO element is also fabulous feature.  We had lunch there and started off with the spring rolls and fried chicken. Although I would normally not order fried chicken at a Thai restaurant, I was shocked by how tasty it was. The chicken was crispy (although not the American style many expect as I think they use a lighter flour), but the red chili sauce the chicken is served with added a nice spicy dimension to the dish. We also ordered the larb and pad hea poa. The larb was very flavorful and had a nice acidity to the dish. The spiciness was deceptive and snuck up on you like it came out of no where! The pad hea poa was not nearly as spicy, but had a some unique black pearl mushrooms, which were small, dense and chewy - a style that I would not recommend to the Thai novice. The ground pork and chili paste sauce was nice, but definitely a funky dish that would require a second try to properly appreciate it. Overall we had a great meal at Sticky Rice and the staff definitely won me over on the first visit.

I've never had Thai food and let me tell you, I was not excited to try it at all. I went into this place very unhappy.  My mom got a curry with chicken and I got lemongrass chicken. I can't remember what my sister got but it was flat noodles with chicken and Chinese broccoli. We ordered pot stickers for an appetizer.  The women working were all very nice and friendly. I had the worlds worst cotton mouth and the waitress was on point with refilling my water. I must have drank like 8 glasses and they kept filling the glass up, all smiles.  The pot stickers were unlike any i've had before. I prefer the kind I get from Chinese places. These were very crispy but still good enough to eat. The lemongrass chicken, I HATED it. It literally tasted like perfume or pledge or something. It was bad. My mom tasted it and said the same thing. I was content on just eating the rice but my mom complained for me and ordered what my sister had. That shit was the bomb! I loved it and now I love Chinese broccoli. I tried my moms curry and I wasn't really digging it since I can't handle spice at all. My sister and mom both loved what they ordered. They were nice enough not to charge or be rude to me for the lemon grass chicken.  Honestly i'm not sure if I'll come back. The servers were some of the nicest i've ever had and the second dish really redeemed Sticky Rice for me.

2012-02-16,2.0,"This place was fantastic and I really did try to give them multiple fair shakes, but success has gone to their heads and you can now expect very inconsistent food preparation and sometimes worse. We always get our food to go or delivered. Three of the last six times we've ordered from them have been very disheartening on multiple levels. A) A piece of eggplant that still had the large producer/farm sticker stuck to it. B) A delivery in which half the items were wrong or missing. C) A large soup with duck in which 75% of the duck was duck skin not meat (I like duck skin but please!.) And finally the last straw was this evening. Feeling adventurous I thought I would try something new, a dish described as ""Tuna Fish in curry over Thai noodles with steamed vegetables."" We had it delivered. The dish did not contain a single bit of tuna and I would have been very happy even if it was just canned tuna, honestly. What the curry did contain was an insane amount of fish sauce and about one tablespoon of what looked like minced and boiled frozen vegetables, not even recognizable. it was as if they saw that they did not have a can of tuna laying around and decided they would just pour what was probably about 1/3 of a cup of fish sauce into the curry. I love fish sauce and I even tried one bite. This stuff was inedible, salty beyond description. I immediately packed it up and drove to Sticky Rice. I was very polite in telling them what my complaint was and simply asked for a refund. First the girl behind the counter lifted the lid and said ""see, there is tuna"" which is utterly ridiculous, there was nothing of the sort. Then she and another lady behind the counter started speaking to each other in their native tongue and the second woman told me ""that's Thai style, jt just has the flavor of tuna."" To which I said ""no, that is the flavor of fish sauce."" Then the first gal offered me a discount on it. I'm thinking to myself, they have got to be kidding! I had to get in my car and drive back to a place that brought me a fraudulently prepared dish that was inedible and they're suggesting I take it home and eat it because they'll give me a couple of bucks back!? I'm about the last person to subscribe to the credo that the customer is always right but this was just plain bad customer service that bordered on being condescending.

Anyway, they were not good, not terrible but definitely not good and would highly recommend avoiding these...frankly they should just take them off the menu.  The red curry sauce however was outstanding.

I love their Northern Thai menu, yes their other offerings are good, but when the menu offers more than a hundred items to choose from, it's easier to just go with the Northern Thai section because you can't go wrong. The Gang Hung Lay is awesome, full of that savory, meaty flavor. The Kua Kae is awesome for those who can handle the punch of a spicy soup (kind of reminds me of a spicy kimchee flavored ramen, but full of veggies and other goodies)!

2011-11-16,5.0,"Sticky Rice is now at the top of my list for Thai. We typically go to Spoon Thai, whose ""off the regular menu"" Thai food has been excellent. But recently we've had some misses at Spoon with overly sugary dumbed down Thai. Not so with Sticky Rice--at least not on my first try. We had the som tom (can't ever resist this salad), with a side of sticky rice (just how they sell it from street vendors in Northern Thailand); the Northern Thai Sausage (I don't eat meat, but my friend tried two of these and said they were excellent); the nam prik ong (nam prik is a spicy dipping sauce for veggies, often with ground pork or fish, but this one was just with veg); and the catfish salad.  The som tom was excellent and quite spicy, which was nice, since I asked for spicy, but was anticipating that they might make it mild for the two of us (we're not Thai). The nam prik ong was excellent, spicy, and light--just tons of roasted and blended up green chiles with a nice amount of herbs, salt, and spice. The catfish salad was somewhat of a fail since it contained lots of pieces of pork (those Northerners love pork...) but contained no warning of this on the menu. That said, my friend liked it, and I suppose I should've asked about the meat in it. Our server was sweet and good about refilling the water. The bill was pretty darn cheap. We only tried a few things, so I'll be very excited to come back and work my way through more of the menu. Word to those without a car--the restaurant is on a weird stretch of Western that feels kind of empty at night. I didn't like walking here alone at night. It's probably fine, but I would take the bus or bike personally. So nice to get some out of the ordinary Thai! Exciting!",0.994,0.765,0.175,0.06,0.6164041514041513

Recommend highly the gaeng hanglay and nam prik ong.  Hanglay was made with a leaner cut of pork shoulder than it might be in Chiang Mai, but braised wonderfully and flavors (ginger, peanuts) melded perfectly.  Ordered both the sai ou (northern Thai sausage) and sai krok issan (Eastern thai sausage) -- northern is definitely better here, the sai krok was disappointing.   Khao soi should be a crowd pleaser. I prefer it a bit more luscious, but this was still satisfying. Lovely service from wonderful (northern) Thai waitress.   I read some of the less impressed reviews here and feel like many of these people just ordered ridiculously.   Don't forget it's BYOB, and there is not much B around to run out and get.",0.9921,0.677,0.273,0.049,0.6316666666666666
2011-11-11,3.0,"Heard so much hype from my Asian crowd about this place, finally I got a chance to go when someone was driving me there. Yes, Sticky Rice isn't that close, I don't drive, life is complicated, and I was grateful that I had a chance to try it out.  First off, I wanted a curry noddle dish. Waitress was very polite and apologized because they ran out of curry powder. REALLY? The only worst thing that a Thai restaurant out of curry powder is an Indian restaurant out of curry power. But that would NEVER happen because (1) their curry powder comes in bucket, daily, and (2) they'd run next door to another Indian restaurant to ask for some more. Let's face it, it's a bit unacceptable for a Thai restaurant to not have curry power, on a Saturday afternoon? Weren't they expecting some more customers that nights? I could have given them some of my own, but I accidentally left my jar of curry powder on the bigger purse I carried the day before! Mistake #1: never switch purse and forget your curry powder. Damn it.  OK --- you might think I'm being such a baby about this little hiccup, and I am (was). So I'm willing to let it pass. I went ahead and order a wide rice noodle with Chinese brocoli (Lard Nar). My dinning partner had a Cashew Chicken. Our food came out momentarily and everything was good. I could have used a bit more flavor in my noodle, but I guess that was the curry powder? Perhaps I should have gone with something else, like the fried bamboo caterpillars but I didn't want to freak my not-so-Asian friend out. Mistake #2: going to an Asian place with a non-Asian.  Honestly though, I was glad they have the caterpillars (and also about 200 other items). Menu is very extensive, and the restaurant itself is a lot smaller inside. Perhaps you should look at their menu online before hand to not be overwhelmed. Service was good, the waitress wasn't too personable but she got her job done. I can imagine the place being very crowded and busy during dinner. They offer delivery and take out, so that might be a good option since their venue isn't big.  I will give this place another chance and come back, since all of my friends have given it 5 stars, but from what I've experienced, it's a 3 stars.",0.9863,0.82,0.127,0.053,0.48004385964912294

We ordered four dishes - pad thai with tofu, bamee soup with bbq pork, home made northern Thailand style sausage, and sticky rice with durian for dessert. The pad thai was perfect! Exactly the way it's prepare by little vendors in Thailand - you could taste the lime, roasted peanuts, cilantro, chewy noodles, and that touch of savory sweetness. Unlike most Americanized Thai places, the pad thai wasn't covered in some gross looking reddish sauce or overly sweet. The bamee soup was great! Chewy noodles, a delicious sweet broth, and tasty bbq pork that was flavorful and not fatty. The sausage was the star. Amazing flavor that I haven't tasted since being in northern Thailand. The sticky rice with durian in coconut milk was a perfect ending. People either love or hate durian, and it's very hard to come by in the States. In addition, the service was great and everyone seemed friendly and had a smile on their face. Also, the prices are very good - most entrees are only $6-8.

We couldn't down it but it was tasty nonetheless. You could see the chilli seeds peeping out from the sliced sausage. If you can withstand the unquenchable fire in your mouth, go ahead and get this. The iced coffee tasted a little like Vietnamese coffee. Not too bad but I wouldn't say it's the best. Lard nar is wide rice noodle served in gravy. I picked the beef to go with it but wrong choice. Should have gone with shrimp. The beef slices were too thick and too tough. BUT the thick gravy was great (they added a little sweet sauce) and the noodles perfect! They don't give that much noodles though, in fact, there's more vege than noodles! I'm a relatively small eater and I finished my dish...so, for big eaters, you're going to have to order a second helping. However, I don't think it's going to burn that big a hole in your pocket because it's ain't that expensive here. All in all, we spent about $23 for all that we ordered. As for the Pad See Ewe, even though I found it a tad too sweet, it was still delicious. The shrimp was crunchy and absolutely yummylicious. The noodles were perfect too. I simply love wide rice noodles! Not as much vege in this dish though. :) Last was the sticky rice mango. I've had a lot of this in Asia. The sticky rice they have here is great. Infused with the sweet taste of coconut and cooked to perfection - not too mushy or too hard; that's usually where people go wrong. The mango they served us was overripe though. Too soft. Sweet but not over-the-head sweet because it was too ripe.  Service was great too. And I love the way the whole place was decorated - summer colors of orange and yellow.  Try this place!

Needless to say I tried a rather traditional app, the Gui Chai- something I can remember from my college days when my Thai sweet mate would make them in the dorm room - something similar to spanakopita.  It was pretty similar to what I remember, but for some reason the crust was a bit soggy on the bottom and the spicy soy-sauce left much to be desired (which is ironic when compared to the rest of my dinner....)  I had the Red Curry with Tofu and my friend had the Pad Thai with tofu.  He mentioned it was alright, but nothing to write home about. I on the other hand was coughing trying to eat my spicy red curry - and I must confess, I jumped on the spicy wagon a few years ago and am still building up tolerance, but even my friend who is mega devoted to spicy food said it was too much, and that I was not a baby for thinking it was too hot.   Yet here is the number one downfall of STICKY RICE - I ordered two Thai Ice Teas... we only received one initially so I reminded the waitress a total of about four times that  I ordered two - it was approximately a good twenty five minutes later, from the last and final time I mentioned it, and from another waitress no less - who finally gave me my Thai Ice Tea.   Needless to say, by the time I received my  drink I was already done eating (what I could eat since my dish was too spicy) - and was ready for desert - Mango Sticky Rice, but no - Our ""waitress"" drops the check on the table, not even giving us the chance to order some desert - RUDE!

These are dishes you won't see at most Thai spots in the city.  Anyway, l got the Gang Hung Lay, which was one of the best dishes I've had, hands down. Chunks of tender pork cooked in ginger and garlic; a nice kick that will get your head right. So flavorful and addicting, I kept eating past full. I got the sticky rice to go with it, which was whatever.  But, two nights ago I got takeout for a group of people and got the mango sticky rice. That ish was so tasty I shoulda ordered so much more of it.  To accompany this dish I got some spring rolls (best I've ever had), some chicken pad thai (surprisingly good), Northern Thai Sausage (spicy! but really good and $2.00!) and Kua Kae, which was a Northern Thai dish with Chicken, bamboo shoots, bay corn and some spicy ass peppers. They asked how spicy and I got medium - it was a good choice - not mild but with a really good kick.  The Kua Kae was awesome and proved once again that you should go out on a limb and try the Norther Thai dishes as you won't be disappointed. I also should mention that SR is very very affordable. Most dishes are $6.50 or less, mango sticky rice was $3.75, sprint rolls $3.25...everything is inexpensive. They have daily dinner specials like stuffed chicken wings or lamb on the bone, nice servers and fast service.

The service was unexpectedly great! very many Chicago restaurants in this area are filled with lousy waiters who don't really seem to care if you are there. At Sticky Rice the waiters are like ultra super attentive where if I even seemingly make slight eye contact near a waiter they jump on me asking me if I'm okay etc.  Great stuff!

2011-01-22,5.0,"Seriously delicious Thai food! I've eaten at a great many Thai places all over Chicago and I gottta say, I love Sticky Rice! As a vegetarian, I especially appreciate their large ""Vegetarian Menu"" -- which has like 30 things and is just on the back page of the 'regular' menu. They have mock meats AKA 'fake meats', made of seitan, which is a gluten product. Sounds gross, but taste fantastic.  In fact, one night I brought home carryout ""mock duck"" from Sticky Rice and my dad didn't even notice it wasn't real meat. So yes, I totally suggest, even if you aren't vegetarian (and even if you don't like vegetables!!), try some of their 'mock' meats at Sticky Rice.. very tasty!  Anyway, the service here is good - pretty fast and attentive folks. The prices are fair, and the menu is huge :)",0.9867,0.684,0.251,0.065,0.6431187859759289

2011-01-14,4.0,"I have heard rave reviews from friends so I decided to try it. seeing as its Thai it was not too hard to convince her.  The setting was surprisingly laid back and typical of a Thai diner. On first glance you would never imagine it to be an atypical place in a part of Chicago that isn't known for its adventurous nature. I ordered the grilled squid followed by the deep fried frogs legs. My girlfriend ordered a catfish entree (I'm sorry I can't remember the name off the top of my head).  The grilled squid was superb. Lightly toasted and spongy. still capturing the flavors you expect from squid (slightly fishy, mellow). The frogs legs were not what you expected and were smaller portions with peppers and mushrooms. You could tell they were north Thai since they had a very muddy, swampy taste to them. Enjoyable and much more of an exotic taste than eating frogs legs in say, a french restaurant. The catfish entree had a strong lemon grass finish and was very well cooked. we finished with some sticky rice with taro which was good comfort food on a cold Chicago night. My only reservations with the place was that the portions were small( I had to order the bacon wrapped shrimp to fill myself up. Tasty). The service is good but they seemed more concerned about everyone else than my table.

It's situated in the same building that former Cub, Dave Kingman's (short lived) Ice Cream shop called home.  Don't ask me why I remember that.   We stared out with a couple of appetizers. We did the Thai Meatballs and some Thai Goulash called the Golden Basket. The Meatballs were awesome, but the Golden basket tasted like a bunch of items from a Chinese Buffet that were thrown in a blender. In other words, the Meatballs were delicious, but the Golden Basket was unimpressive.    My entree blew me away. I went with the Northern Thai Sausage served with their famous, Sticky rice. I feasted like Rosie O'Donnell at a Old Country Buffet for $10. The Sausage was spicy, juicy and delicious. This is Sausage that could make a Obese Wisconsinite run naked across Lambeau Field.

I sat next to a guy who was what I imagine Paul Walker or Keanu Reeves would be like in the same situation. ""Do you serve drinks out of a pineapple?"" ""I want a frozen smoothie out of a pineapple."" ""If this pineapple drops below 50 miles per hour we're all gonna die."" This continued on for a few minutes.   I think he tossed in a few ""Yea, Babes"" to the woman sitting across from him. The food at Sticky Rice, per usual, is superb.  However, the problem that I encounter, from eating out at Thai restaurants relatively infrequently, is overcoming the ignorance I have towards which entrees are the most tasty. That's also the fun part though.  (usually). I got the Nam Tok, a grilled beef, mint, basil, and lime sauce salad.  I've had this dish a few times.  The blend of the different flavors that are not typical to a traditional N.A. palate are very nice and robust.  I order it extra spicy.  The waitress usually gives me a you-say-extra-spicy-but-do-you-mean-Extra-spicy look.  I hold the eye contact a brief moment longer than usual.  The waitress concedes.   I also had the Eggplant with Ground Beef.  A reasonably hearty dish, what with the umami-esque eggplants, that I've also ordered before. My lady had some rice noodle dish with chicken and veg.  It was about par for the course.  Not my typical choice.  But the noodles were deliciously slippery. Oh, you must MUST order the Norther Thai sausage (not to be confused with the sausage appetizer-this N.T. sausage is under the heading ""Northern Thai Dishes"").  It comes served diced with pieces of lemon grass and basil or mint (I forget, didn't order it this time).  Seriously awesome meat.

The 2nd to last time I went to Sticky Rice, my boyfriend asked for a recommendation for an appetizer. The waitress jokingly recommended fried worms, I believe fried frog legs too. I don't really remember as this visit was a longggg time ago. We were interested in trying fried worms but the waitress also said it tastes better with beer.  We passed on ordering fried worms since it was only us two, no beer and knew we wouldn't finish it. The last time we went to Sticky Rice, we decided to come back with a bunch of friends (and alcohol!). We also ordered the recommended fried worms.  I liked, not loved, fried worms. Salty to taste and crunchy- almost an acquired taste. It kinda looked like overgrown maggots- gross, I know! hehe. Anyway, so we had our friends try the fried worms, mixed reviews among friends but most of them ate more than one fried worm. Not bad, huh?  I recommend anyone spontaneous, in a large group to order their fried worms. Don't forget beer! It sure does go well with beer. :) Food is ALWAYS GREAT! Food portions and prices are both pretty average. Service, knowing that most of their employees are Thai, is SUPERB! -- They speak English and can carry on conversations with customers.

Now the bad - the service, which ruined my experience there.  I am a vegetarian, and ordered pad see eiw with tofu, and it tasted fishy, like perhaps they cooked it in a pan that was previously used to cook fish and not washed before cooking my dish.  I've been to Thailand and ordered the same dish there as well as in other Chicago restaurants, and I can say that it's not supposed to taste like that.  I took a few bites, then notified the waitress that it tasted fishy.  She took it back to the kitchen, then brought my plate back a few minutes later and told me that's what I ordered.  And nervously giggled and ran away.  To top it off, they charged me for it, so basically I paid for an inedible dish and left hungry.  Unacceptable.",0.752,0.788,0.122,0.091,0.33392857142857146

Let's keep it!"" and dug in. My roommate took the fish thingy and liked it, but it smelled pretty gross. I tried the sausages... and fell in love. And I don't even like spicy food! About 5 minutes later, Sticky Rice called back and asked if we'd gotten the wrong order and offered to switch them back. My response: ""Yeah... we did... but... we ate it?""

I also love the deep fried frogs legs with basil, a dish much less esoteric than it sounds.  Like wings? Like Thai food?

2010-06-03,4.0,"I am on a never-ending quest to find the best Thai food in the city and last night, gave Sticky Rice a try.  Le beau and I were catching a 10:00 show at Martyrs and we wanted to catch a bite before the show and decided on Thai.  We had only three criteria: it needed to be close to Martyrs, it had to be BYOB, and it had to be open late. Naturally, I turned to Yelp and was pleasantly surprised to see a 4 star average for almost 250 reviews. Once I saw the address, it occurred to me that I've driven by this place literally thousands of times and had always meant to give it a try.  Got there about 9:00, and it was still pleasantly busy. This was a good sign since we parked in front of Thai Room (just down the block) and that place was D-E-A-D.  The decor was quite cheery. Walls are painted a sunny yellow and the place is well lit. We were seated at a two-top and the waitress came right over to open the beer and give us menus.  The menu was huge - certainly one of the most extensive I have ever seen for a Thai place. Tons of appetizers and entrees to choose from, and many of them were things I had never seen at other Thai establishments.  My go-to appetizer when eating Thai is satay. I love peanut sauce and cucumber salad which is pretty much the reason for ordering satay in the first place. Sticky Rice offers both pork and chicken versions, and since most places usually have chicken, we opted for the pork version, only to be told that they only had chicken. OK, no big deal.  We got the satay as well as an order of egg rolls. While the satay was excellent, I am fairly certain we were supposed to get 5 skewers and only got 4. The egg rolls were piping hot and crunchy, but I'm sorry to say, a little bland.  For entrees we got Po Tak (a hot and sour soup with seafood) and Pepper Steak. The soup was big enough for two and chock full of shrimp, plump mussels still in their shell, and some whitefish, which may have been snapper, but I'm not entirely sure. The broth was just spicy enough and very flavorful and there was a ton of seafood in it. It was excellent.  The pepper steak was also quite good. I usually shy away from ordering beef in Asian restaurants, but I'm glad I broke my rule. Their beef was tender and tasted great and there was an abundance of fresh mushrooms ( I hate when they use canned), yellow peppers, tomatoes and peapods. It wasn't a huge portion, so we devoured all of it.  I am a fan of Sticky Rice and will definitely go back, especially since they have outdoor seating (although do I really want to eat outside as the Western Avenue bus blows its exhaust all over me?).  To sum up:  BYOB  extensive menu  fairly priced (not as cheap as other Thai places, but not expensive)  later than normal hours  easy street parking  friendly, efficient service  If you're like me and can't get enough Thai food, get yourself over to Sticky Rice.",0.9933,0.822,0.135,0.043,0.5557852965747705

While I asked for medium spicy, I could have easily gone hotter. Medium was spicy yes, but not the sort of heat I needed to break through this sinus wall in my face. The order of panang was perfect for one person with a little leftover and as it turned out, the extra rice was unnecessary.  Thai delivery has been letting me down in my 'hood for years.

I should preface this review by saying that I lived in Bangkok for 12 years and have visited at least once every year for the past 7 years. We started off with the larb gai (chicken) and som tam tamada (no crab). Both were ordered as medium spicy since I can't handle real Thai spicy anymore! Also ordered the tod mun (fried fish cakes) and khao niao (sticky rice). Tod mun had authentic flavor but the texture just wasn't there... they felt more like fishballs than fried fish cakes. Som tam was pretty good... could've been a bit spicier. Larb gai was a bit on the sour side but that might have been my fault for not ordering it spicier.  Overall, these dishes were good and I'd definitely order them again. We also tried the green curry with chicken and the pad khrapao gai with eggplant. These two were definitely a huge let down for me. The green curry was way too sweet and had too much coconut milk in it. The eggplants in the curry were not the traditional eggplants used in thai cooking. The kraphao showed up with green bell peppers in it... I knew off the bat that this wasn't going to be an authentic dish. It also arrived kind of cold as it had been sitting at the counter for quite awhile. The flavor wasn't authentic either. Bottomline. I'd come back for the more ""isaan"" or ""northern Thai"" food. All the other stuff, I'll pass!! I'll rate Sticky Rice based on the food I enjoyed.",0.9829,0.88,0.108,0.012,0.5343198653198654

I'd order my standard thai restaurant dish, pad thai with tofu, occasionally branching out to some pad siew ... and it was forgettable at best. Took a break. Then last week I remembered Sticky Rice and decided to Yelp it. I was taken aback by the great reviews, then realized that most people were raving about the Northern Thai dishes. I decided to give it another chance. I am so glad I did. Save your safe pad thai order for Duck Walk and Spoon; this is a place to branch out.  We had the papaya salad, which was an amazing taste sensation of spiciness, coolness and crispness. My girlfriend ordered the Thai green curry, her standard thai dish. It was amazing. I am usually a fan of green curry for about five bites, then it just becomes too cloyingly sweet. Not so here. I probably ate half of her curry. The sweetness was there, but subtle, and didn't overpower the other flavors, flavors I'd never tasted in curry, flavors I'm missing right now ...I ordered the Kua Kue, with sticky rice, which was delightfully spicy, with lots of veggies and tasty pork.

And here's the kicker - I always, always, always order Lard Nar/Lad Nar/Lard Na when dining Thai. It's my most favorite dish, hands down. But when I come here I know to always order the Thai Noodle Soup. It's everything I want and everything I need on any given day -- be it in the middle of a snowstorm or a hot, sunny July day.  The Thai Noodle Soup is the best soup ever cooked, nay ever created, I'm serious. It's base, a hearty, dark brown beef broth is packed with a multitude of flavors. The noodles are thin and perfect for absorbing all the beefy goodness. Next up are the mouthful sized chunks of delicious beef that float beside the crunchy fried shrimp bits.  Perfection comes in a bowl at $5.95 per serving. Yesterday my boyfriend, a Sticky Rice veteran, ordered one of his staples to go with the Thai Noodle soup, he got the Yum Nuer, a sliced beef salad that mingles with basil, mint, onion and tomatoes in a savory vinegar sauce. My mom took one bite of it and absolutely became addicted. I don't blame her.  Their pad thai is also quite tasty, light, limey and crunchy. The Lard Nar is not so amazing, it's just ""alright,"" because it usually comes doused in the brown gravy making it more like a soup but not quite so.

Since I was with a group of friends, I noticed a bunch of the others' food.

We topped off the dishes with Kar Nom Tuy (steamed coconut milk in cups).  We've been there before and these are our favorite.  The milk is silky smooth with a a salty and sweet taste.  I have never had this anywhere else.  So I highly recommend getting this here.  However, if you don't like the taste of sweets mixed with salty (i.e. bacon with sugar), then you might not like it.

Decor was nice inside, bright colors, big/tall walls without a lot of stuff crammed onto the, and good spacing between tables means didn't feel squished.   Started with my standard Crab Rangoon ($4.25) and they were pretty good--a little more crabby than usual which made me almost thing they used real crab instead of the fake stuff--dunno. Not real big individually, but not too crisp either, which is the way I like them. Not quite Gumrai good, but better than most, especially for the price. Nong got the Northern Thai sausage ($2/ea.--maybe a skosh high, should bundle 3/$5), and I liked them enough to order two more...good, spicy, and ordered a thing of sticky rice ($1.25) to eat authentic.

I ordered the Chicken Green Curry to go(my favorite dish) and as I was enjoying my dish I noticed a grain of rice that looked a bit different.

Although I'd lost my appetite, I believe that stuff happens from time to time and was willing to give them another chance. I did feel however that I should not have to pay for this one dish and also wanted to alert them to what I'd found so they can correct this situation so that it would not affect the quality of their food. Surprisingly, they treated me as if I was lying. Then they had the nerve to ask me to bring the thing in so they could see it! I obliged and brought it in on the plate just as I'd left it! They took it into the kitchen, left me standing there for at least 5 minutes, finally came back and told me that it was a beansprout not a larvae! Trust me! I was able to identify the head on that thing! To add insult to injury, the so called manger told me that they had refunded my money through my charge but I never saw it on my statement.

What was surprising (and upsetting) is that after having a lengthy conversation with the waitress about what dishes were vegetarian, we received our Tom Yum soup came with chicken rather than tofu. We sent the dish back and were told we could replace it. We told them to take it off the bill. After much complaining to my vegetarian table mates a waitress finally came over and offered to let us have our Sticky Rice with Mango on the house. Our main dishes came as ordered but were beyond sub par. You could really tell that they were made with a curry powder. While we were told that this was the case with the vegetarian curry dishes, we didn't expect the food to be that dry or flavorless. Plus, it was served warm! The noodles seemed old. It might be because it was the end of the day, but still. The sticky rice with mango was good but couldn't make up for the rest of the meal. We left very disappointed.

2009-05-22,5.0,"I moved to Chicago in 2007.  Thai is my favorite cuisine, and I had diligently been looking for a good Thai place.  All of them sucked.  So many of them sucked that I didn't bother to review them because it would have thrown off my average yelp rating. But the general problems I've encountered: Grease.  And when I say ""light oil,"" they just go light on all the liquids, so I get some plain vegetables and protein with a smattering of seasoning.  I imagine this is because they mix the oil in with the sauce, so the only way to put less oil is to put in less sauce. Taste and seasoning.  When you take a bite of Thai food, like you would in New York or California, the first word that should pop into your mouth is ""fresh.""  Maybe ""green.""  This is my experience at my favorite place in New York.  None of the Thai places I visited could make that claim.  The flavor profiles were muddled and confused and none of it landed squarely on my palate.  And for god's sake, easy on the salt. MSG.  Don't get me wrong - I'm actually very pro msg.  MSG has it's place, in moderation.  It should be used in very, very tiny quantities - at maybe one tenth the amount they actually use in most Chicago Thai places.  When you finish a meal, you shouldn't feel like you might be able to grow a second head of you tried hard enough.  But I often go home in a state of soylent green. Generally feeling like crap the next day.  When you have a good meal you should not feel that meal moving around your belly the next day.  You shouldn't be suffering from funky nightmares and decreased energy and reduced libido.  No food should ever make you feel like that.  I don't know what most of the Thai places are doing to their food to make me feel like that, but it's something, and it's something that's worse than what McDonald's did in the documentary  ""Supersize Me."" Anyway, Sticky Rice is the first place I""ve really loved since I moved to Chicago.  It got high ratings so I didn't make any special requests - no 'light oil,"" no ""red chili pepper on the side.""  And it was great.  I love the fact that the sticky rice is in one giant lump, and I actually just asked the waitress to just give me her favorite dish.  Unfortunately, I don't know what it is, but it's okay.  Chicken and vegetables with lots of flavor and a fresh taste and the right amount of salt.  They were generous with their fats, but not insane with them. After I paid, I stood up, and thought wryly that I should be rolled out the door, having eaten so much.  I was so preoccupied with my self mockery that I wasn't careful with my bag and coat - I took a table of plates and glasses with me.   Totally humiliating.  But oh well.  The servers apologized to *me*, and rushed to clean up all the shattered glass.  I went back to my table to self consciously and sheepishly double my tip, and quietly sneaked out.

I am an adventurous foodie, but there were a few tings on the menu that made me pause.  One dish had ""ant eggs"" listed as one of the ingrediants.  They also have bamboo caterpillars on the menu.  Another dish had ""intestines"" listed as part of it.  This is not meant to deter anyone from going there.  I am mentioning it because I like the fact that the owners did not decide to American-ize their restaurant.  I am no expert but the place seems like it could be an authentic Thai restaurant in Thailand.  If you like (or love!)

2009-04-01,4.0,"4.5 Sticky Rice is hard to beat.  Dishes are served as requested (more on that in a second), and there's enough menu diversity to placate both adventurous diners and those who prefer more Americanized food.  The apparent persistence of a ""secret"" untranslated menu is annoying, however, given the place's popularity.  Anyway... Tod mun and papaya salad (ordered very spicy) to start.  The papaya salad was probably one of the 10 spiciest restaurant dishes I've ever had (I've taken extraordinary liberties with my tongue in my home kitchen before).  At every other place where I've had a dish with comparable jolt, I've been interrogated as to my actual desire to eat spicy food.  No questions asked at Sticky Rice, and the result is a piquant and appetizing salad to prime the palette.  The tod mun (fish cakes) were better, if a bit oily.  They were helped substantially by the liberal use of keffir leaves. We had gang som toon (catfish in sour curry soup) and gang tae po (water spinach and pork in tamarind curry) for dinner.  The catfish wasn't quite as sour as I'd hoped, but the broth was complex and savory.  I'll have to read up on the ""toon stem,"" because it seemed to provide a strong, distinctive flavor.  The catfish was, however, a bit overcooked (key determinant in my not awarding 5 stars).  The pork was good, though not really matched to my taste sensibilities.  I like the taste of coconut, but I don't care for its cloying, fatty nature in abundance.  A few bites were excellent, but sufficed. The best part of the meal was the northern Thai sausage we had on the side.  It's dark and dense and pleasantly spiced.  It might be just a touch dry, but at $2/ea., it's hard to imagine not ordering a couple at every meal. If the service were a touch faster (though at the prices, who's complaining?), and if a few very minor inconsistencies were remedied, this would be 5 stars.  The alleged existence of a secret menu does not factor into my rating; if I knew for sure that it existed, I'd probably bump down Sticky Rice to just 4 stars, if only for the paralyzingly stupid annoyance factor.",0.9688,0.834,0.108,0.059,0.5011823361823361

The atmosphere is youthful and colorful, the wait staff is friendly, and the food...my goodness...the food is so good and at a great price!

Sticky Rice's panang curry is the best, using more coconut milk than oil so that it has a nice creamy texture. My family is also a big fan of the fishy rice. And we always get the tempura.  I also love mangoes and sweets, so when I had sticky rice with mango for dessert, I nearly went into a bliss coma.

2009-01-31,4.0,"Family style is a must for this place so you can try all their tasty dishes! Chicago has a ton of Thai restaurants and Sticky Rice has been my favorite thus far. They're busy but if there's a wait it's not for long and the space itself is eclectic (they sell Pocky??) but exudes warmth and coziness (maybe even a bit TOO cozy for space is tight). And prices are very reasonable. Now onto the food... If you must get your staples (Pad Thai, fried rice, etc) go for it but do try some of their Northern dishes not found easily elsewhere. We started out with their Northern Thai Sausages--definitely has a spicy punch to it.  Kow Soy (Khao Soi...many diff ways of romanization) was flavorful and hit the spot. More oil and less coconut milk than what I've had but this is a major specialty in Northern Thai, please try!  Northern Thai Larb: Don't be offset by the intestines (compared to the pork, ratio wasn't that much). It's chewier but other than the intestines, similar to other larb dishes.  Duck Curry with Lychee: definitely unique with whole lychees thrown in there. Duck meat was on the scarcer side but I was a big fan of the curry so didn't mind it. Man, curry and rice are neverending helpings.  Marinated frog legs. Was tossed with bell peppers and the sauce was yummy. While frog has the texture of chicken, it has a distinct flavor that I could never crave.  Safe bets that all go well with rice: Pad Basil -- tender pieces of chicken. Works well with rice. Sole fish with lime sauce -- sour!! but good kind of sour. The fish itself was just a piece of fillet so don't count on a whole fish coming out.  Finally, end your dinner on a sweet note.

The crab and sauce is excellent (my mom always said you know the quality of a good Thai/Asian restaurant is the thickness of their dough..thick dough means their lazy work). That being said, the rangoon dough was thin, crispy and a dream! The satay was well seasoned the peanut sauce was perfect...not too thick, nor oily. The cucumber salad was decent...they just needed to marinate it more.  For dinner we ordered the Gang Massamun Curry and Pad Woon Sen noodles. The curry was EXCELLENT! Just like my mom makes.

Funny story about the northern thai larb.  My girlfriend does not eat meat very often, but always likes to steal a bite of mine.  She never mentioned that she was going to have some of my larb.  She quickly reached over the table and grabbed a fork full of the ground pork and a piece of intestine.  Before I could say anything, she had already eaten it.  Now, she has just gotten used to having a piece of steak or pork here and there.  I didn't have the heart to tell her until our next visit that she had literally consumed pork guts.  She freaked out, and said she thought it was a mushroom.  In any case, my meals are likely safe from her wandering fork, at least at Sticky Rice.",0.9075,0.848,0.111,0.04,0.6112857142857144

2008-08-24,1.0,"Well, as the majority of the reviews here are 4 and 5 stars - combined with the fact that there are accolades and awards posted all over the front of the restaurant - I'm going to work with the assumption that *maybe* our experience today was an anomaly (although saying that I now remember ordering takeout from SR just about a year ago and thinking: ""Eh - it's still edible"").  If I could give a 1.5 star rating, I would - this time I'm going to have to err to the low side. Late this afternoon my hubby and I realized that we hadn't eaten anything in HOURS and were in desperate need of something delish.  As a treat we decided to go out.  My first choice in local Thai places wasn't due to open for another 50 minutes (and in hindsight we should have just gone for a 50-minute walk) so we drove a bit further south and went to SR. First - the menu looks impressive as heck - I don't know if I've ever seen a Thai menu so extensive.  Mostly tho, I'm a Pad Thai girl, and it's a good way for me to judge one place against another.  We decided to try something new in an appetizer tho, so we ordered the Shrimp On Sugar Cane Sticks in addition to our usual pot-stickers. I ordered Pad Thai and asked for extra tofu, as I wasn't going to get any meat.  Hubby asked for Pad Thai Beef. Service was pretty good - it took them a while to actually get around to taking our order - seeing as we were one of only two tables occupied in the place - but the food came quickly after we ordered. The shrimp appetizer was.... Rubbery?  The flavor wasn't anything to write home about and actually tasted a bit too ""shrimpy"" - but the texture was not at all what we expected and we only each ate 1 of the 2 servings.  The pot stickers were good, although I need to remember that I also like them steamed instead of fried and should order them that way more often.  The pad thai tofu was decidedly low on tofu and what little was there was cut up into these tiny little cubes that didn't even constitute ""a bite"".  Most of the places I get pad thai tofu from have these great big chunks of the stuff - and occasionally asking for extra means you can sometimes end up with more tofu than noodles!  Sticky Rice? Decidedly not the case.  The noodles themselves were over-cooked - they were mushy and actually kind of greasy - but the flavor of the sauce was pretty good.  Hubby's pad thai beef was okay - a very small amount of beef, but tasty enough. A few hours after coming home and settling in to make the most of the relaxing weekend, my body revolted against the meal in a rather painful and horrific way - with cold-sweats and all the trimmings.   Because I was so less-than-impressed with the food and then got so sick on it later - we will simply never be eating from Sticky Rice again.  Thai Room is only a few doors up and we've always been extremely happy with our experiences with them.  A few blocks further north and there are even more Thai places that are worth eating at.  I'll always suggest something else over Icky-Sticky-Rice.",0.9695,0.868,0.086,0.046,0.49801484230055676

I can't recall seeing this dish offered at any other Thai restaurant so one Saturday afternoon, I decided to venture up to Sticky Rice to pick up dinner.  Before I go on, I have to mention that I'm Thai. My parents sent me to Bangkok to get familiar with Thai culture when I was 12 years old and in the 3 months I was there, I gained 60 pounds eating, eating and eating (I've lost the weight). It's really hard to find a Thai restaurant that offers more than the usual curry dishes, noodle dishes and appetizers of egg rolls and satay. But when I find a restaurant that reminds of my summer in Bangkok, I'm in heaven! Sticky Rice is one of these places. I ordered 2 orders of the garlic pork, som tum (papaya salad), beef curry, pad thai, 2 orders of sticky rice, 1 steamed, white rice and an order of a dessert that wasn't on the menu. Sure, that's a lot of food for 2 people but I'll tell you - every bit of it was consumed. Maybe it took 3-4 meals but we (mostly me) did it.  Sticky Rice serves northern Thai cuisine and I'm not sure I can tell you the difference between northern Thai and southern Thai food but I know I love northern Thai food. I guess the differences are similar to comparing Szechuan and Mandarin cuisine.  The garlic pork dish is a must-have and it's customary to eat this with sticky rice. Som tum (papaya salad) is a great accompaniment to the pork. I'd be happy eating just these 3 dishes but I had ordered the pad thai and beef curry just to see how they compare and the pad thai might be top 5 here. The curry was good but nothing too different from other Thai restaurants.

However, there have been times at Sticky Rice when I've been tempted to butt in when I hear a neighboring table ordering Pad Thai or crab rangoon or something like that.

HOWEVER. If you are at Sticky Rice, why waste valuable stomach space on something you could get in a million other places?! Take my advice, as someone who has eaten there many times and who invades the menu with no fear. Grab the Thai menu and challenge yourself a little.

Try the fresh coconut drink too, so refreshing. Decor: It is pretty casual, bright, and airy. No frills.

Ill-advised as it now seems, we started with two seafood appetizers- shrimp on a sugar cane and the mussel fritter.   I choked down my share of two shrimp but noted the ""funkiness"" but I had to draw the line  at the mussel fritter- it tasted as though bits of rock (shell perhaps?) had made their way into the batter.  My husband thinks it tasted like ""fried crap dredged from the bottom of the ocean.""   The main dish we shared was pad see eiw- I'm glad it wasn't terribly adventurous, I might be dead right now if we'd ventured any further from the familiar.  It was bland, greasy, spongy, devoid of any and all flavor and the vegetables were scarce and sad.

The Gang Hung Lay is unbelievable. The meat is tender and tasty. I find that Sticky Rice doesn't skimp on the proteins like some other Thai joints do. They really load it up.

The service can be a bit spotty at times and on one occasion the place smelled like it had just been disinfected. Otherwise, no complaints.

2007-09-02,5.0,"Sticky Rice is S.'s, Y.'s, and my HOME in Chicago! This is how we made it through the long winters, aging (birthdays were celebrated here), the general depression of the midwest. We even have a fixed seating order.  At Sticky Rice, order the northern and northeastern dishes. The Thai menu seems much more extensive to me, so read that or ask for recommendations. There are a few things that we are addicted to, not all of them northern or Lao, na kha!  One of the really important ones is Sup Nomai. I think it is called Bamboo Pith Soup in the English menu.  Sometimes we order Som Tam, Papaya salad - when we do we usually get the hard core Lao version, with fermented fish (pla ra) and eggplant.  BUT the fruit version is also good!  Two of our rice favorites are ""khao phat khana pla khem""  (how do you do italics on these reviews?) - a salty fish and khana (sort of like Chinese broccoli, but not)  fried rice. The other is ""khao khluk kapi"" - fried rice that has been ""khluk"" - mixed (?) - with fermented shrimp paste. And there's chopped chilis, omelette strips, dried shrimps, onions, apple strips (instead of green mango) on the side. We ususally get the sweet pork that comes with it on the side, because some of us don't eat meat.  Sometimes we order ""lap pla"" (fish ""lap"") - lap is a spicy, minced meat or fish salad... we always get  ""yam pla duk fu,""  fluffy (i.e. shredded, deep fried) cat fish salad, because that is S.'s favorite. The ""tom yam nam khon"" - tom yam with coconut milk is also very good at Sticky. The latter two things are central Thai dishes, which Sticky Rice is also good at. Anyway, I've already exhausted myself just thinking about the food... maybe I'll continue later ...  Sticky Rice can with some certainty be said to be Chicago's best Thai restaurant, I think. All the servers are super-friendly and warm, carefully note down our bizarre, idiosyncratic wishes, and even remember our strange habits and tastes!! We've also come here in ravenous, demanding, large groups and they've always been completely perfect.  Sometimes we've chatted with the very nice owner, but mostly just say a quick hello to him, because he is busy cooking. There are a variety of cooks from different parts of the country in the kitchen, but almost everything they make is good. Some days have been slightly better than others, though. Throughout its three years or so of business, Sticky Rice has been able to maintain the same quality of cooking. We're happy to see that it's doing so well and that it's almost hard to get a table even on week days! Sticky Rice is decidedly BYOB and the staff will provide wine glasses, a cork screw, chill the bottle for you, whatever.  Sorry to have become faint with hunger while describing the food and then having to stop, but I want to mention that SR is also not bad at making vegetarian Thai food - something that is QUITE rare to find. Queer/non-queer moment: When I recently mentioned Sticky Rice to someone as the best Thai restaurant in Chicago, the person said, 'That's such a bad name!'  I thought we had a queer moment there, but in retrospect, I don't think so.... but speaking of queer,  SR is certainly queer friendly, it's not even a question.... having been there in large queer, transgender, feminist groups, we can attest to that...

Western Ave, I'm making a b-line for Sticky Rice. I'll reunite with my family after the meal. Yeah, it's that good.  Sticky Rice has a HUGE menu for those with adventurous tastes (not so far from island bugs) and for those with more tame palates (Stir-fried vegetables). My table had crab rangoons and golden baskets for appetizers. The rangoons were good, offering decent sized chunks of real crab meat in a lightly fried rectangle, but not the best in town. The golden baskets have to be the best appetizer I've ever had, however. Filled with ground chiken, peas, corn and onions, these little guys are a mouth full of yum! Seriously, next time I'm just getting six orders of these for my meal.  For entrees we had Kua Kae (stir fried chicken, green beans, baby corn, and bamboo shoots with eggplant, lime and basil in a curry paste) and mango chicken (an entire mango split in half and hallowed out, the contents mixed with chicken, red and green peppers and onions in a sweet and sour sauce). Both were spectacular! The Kua Kae offered just the right amount of curry spice, lightened with the sweet sauce on the chicken and vegetables. I had this served over sticky rice that is honestly rice that is sticky. Who knew? The mango chicken consisted of very fresh slices of mango and nice pieces of quality chicken.  The food here is very inexpensive so don't leave Sticky Rice without dessert! Most on the desserts come with sweet sticky rice in a banana leaf. We had the sweet sticky rice with mango that reminded me what it's like to O.D. on sugar but man did I enjoy it! This bad boy is doused in coconut milk and sugar and again served with really fresh mango.  Also, Sticky Rice is BYOB and as far as we could tell they weren't charging a corkage fee.

Service can be spotty at times, but then what level of service can you ask for if you are only paying $13-15 per head?

The pad thai from here is also really delicate and flavorful and fresh. The thai iced tea is wonderful. And, of course, who could forget the eponymous Sticky Rice!!! It has a wonderful texture and is fun to eat. The only thing that I've had here that I would not order again are the fried worms.

We tried the sausage that everyone has been raving about and while it wasn't horrible, I can't say I fell in love with it.  There was a certain ingredient in the sausage that I disliked, yet I couldn't really pinpoint what it was.  We also ordered the papaya salad which I was shocked that I liked it so much, the tartness of it was a nice accompaniment to our other dishes.  Stuffed calamari seemed interesting after being told it was stuffed with noodles and pork, but it didn't wow me.  The fillet of tilapia with tamarind sauce was good but I almost think the sauce was a bit too thick and a bit overpowering for a fish as subtle as tilapia.  Our Americanized dish of the evening was lard nar beef and to be honest, I wasn't a big fan.  At every other Thai restaurant that I've ordered lard nar, the noodles were semi crisp, here they were a bit soggy and definitely not to my liking.

We started with the cucumber salad, very nice, although small; and the sticky rice salad, a collecion of julliened vegetables and a peanut sauce (no rice, though), also very nice. I got the pad thai with tofu, no egg. It was tasty, not cloyingly sweet, although it was a little skimpy on the tofu. My companion got the Pad woon sen, which came with egg in it even though it didn't list egg on the menu. We also had some very nice jasmine tea.  In my past experiences with sticky rice, I had some very yummy mango chicken, and another dish that was so mediocre I don't even remember what it was. Their sticky rice in banana leaf is yummy, though. All in all, I've decided sticky rice has redeemed itself as a passable place for thai food.

My only caveat is that I hope you have a relatively strong stomach. My favorite appetizer is the Northern Thai Sausage - its tasty and spicy, combining pork with some good old red curry spices. Some of the standouts that I enjoy are: - Num Prik Ong (ground pork, tomato, red chilli paste) - Gang Hung Lay (churn of pork, garlic, ginger, red curry) - Gang Som Toon (catfish curry) - Pad Woon Sen Together, these raise the collective spice level to a very high degree but are fun anyway. I actually preferred getting regular rice to the eponymous sticky rice, but that's a personal preference. Desserts are pretty good - specifically the Sticky rice with Mango and Durian. Coupled with some beer (if you order for delivery or take-out) - this really hits the spot. The ambiance isn't quite comparable to other good thai restaurants like Thai Pastry, for example.
