2017-08-17,4.0,stopped in for drinks after having dinner nearby - the decor is gorgeously simple & sharp/clean bar area & bathroom/ the bartenders and our server were friendly and welcoming. we had one drink inside but then moved to the outdoor patio - not too loud but it was around 9:30pm on a weeknight so not all the tables were taken & street traffic wasn't bad so you didn't get distracted by the cars. We had a couple of their gin cocktails and then moved on to classic g&t's. The menu options looked good...not a huge selection but can definitely make for an enjoyable meal or just appz. Its a casual vibe ...people in business attire after work and others in jeans & nice shirts or shorts since it's summer.

2017-07-13,2.0,"The only reason I'm not giving this a one-star is because service was wonderful and because I am willing to believe that I somehow came during an off night for Tiny Lounge.  Upon good recommendation, my friends and I went to Tiny Lounge last night for apps/dinner and drinks. At our table my Old Fashioned was super watered down - I was told it was Tiny's Old Fashioned, which is topped with seltzer, but even in that instance, the soda must not have been working because it was incredibly flat and felt like it was topped with regular water.  They were willing to remake the drink though as a regular Old Fashioned which was better.  Another person at my table also got a drink and felt like it had ""no alcohol"" either, so he ended up switching to beer. The food was...lackluster. The portion size was ""definitely smaller"" according to the friend who had recommended Tiny.  The prices had ""definitely gone up"" and they ""must have redone everything"" because almost none of the food was as my friend had remembered.  For myself, I ordered the full portion of mussels and it was covered in so much garlic I still taste the garlic a day later even though I've brushed my teeth several times since then.

Order the sweet potato empanadas instead and the garlic still overwhelms my mouth hours later. Used the check in on Yelp to get a free ""Tiny Fry"" and I think we found the only item on the menu that wasn't tiny! The bucket of fries were actually ridiculous and absolutely nothing special.  The environment was bad too. Poor speaker quality and bad music choices. Uncomfortable chairs. Bad acoustics (could hear everyone in the restaurant better than my date).

2017-05-23,3.0,"We came by thanks to the a la card Chicago deck, which has always had great local spots to check out around the city.  That said, Tiny Lounge would be a go-to as a neighborhood bar, but as a bar/restaurant 20-30 minutes away from my house depending on traffic, I'm not sure I would seek this place out, despite the tasty drinks and the above-average food. Came by this past weekend to grab some apps and cocktails before seeing a concert at Metro.  You can tell right from the jump that this is THE place to hit if you can walk to it; the locals seem comfy, the bar is nice and wide, and I'm sure there are specials that incentivize visits on a weeknight. But if you made the trip to come to Tiny Lounge, I'm not sure there was quite enough to say I would come regularly.  The food we tried was a mixed bag:  the cheese curds were incredible (even though, for $13, this feels more like an entree size than an appetizer) even though the plate was a bit light on the dipping sauce, while the chicken and goat cheese pizzaleta was average, nothing special. The cocktails were great; we did a Hemingway, a Robusti Spritz and the Wyatt Earp, and all three went down easy.  Maybe I have Super Hot Cocktail Bar Fatigue, but I was expecting prices for these drinks to be closer to $10 than the $12 I did pay...there, again, lies the trick with comparing this to my neighborhood (Wicker Park/Bucktown) or the 'hood I probably go to the most now, Logan Square.  I can get great drinks at Remedy for $10 any time, or make a special trip to an area I assumed would be cheaper (North Center) and pay...more? But the service you get for those prices was great and very friendly, and maybe most importantly given that we had to get to a show, very fast.  If I ever move up to this part of town, I'm guessing Tiny would grow on me, but as is, it's a totally fine, perfectly acceptable place to meet friends.",0.9939,0.79,0.158,0.052,0.5958171068697385

Anyone I recommend it to loved it and couldn't just have one. Props to the old manager to recommending this drink over the 3 others I thought of ordering first.  In addition to drinks, the food is also really tasty and reasonably priced. The sliders are on point and Katchup is one of a kind. No, really, try their Katchup!

She was very apologetic and pulled together a couple tables so we had room for everything. The cheese curds were fried in a light, crispy batter with a gooey texture. The Tiny Burgers were packed with flavor and made with quality farm raised beef. The mussels are amongst the best I've had and the portion is extremely generous.

We ended up ordering the mussels and no other mussels will ever compare (believe me, we've tried multiple restaurants and these are the best!). The sauce the mussels come in accompanied by the delicious bread (which I sadly can no longer eat because I'm gluten free now - RIP) is a perfect combination.

This is how it went: -Walked into the restaurant and waited a good 3 minutes before the hostess even noticed us, which in my opinion was unusual. -was seated, and then it was another 15-18 minutes before our server approached us; he acknowledged the delay and explained that there was some sort of miscommunication. Understandable.  -we decided to order all courses at this point worried that we wouldn't see him for a while.  - had the El Morado and the Subourban, both drinks were great and crafted really well. For food, we had the triple cheese fries, tiny burgers(loved it) and the blackened chicken and goat cheese pizza. And to finish, we had the ""dark side of the spoon"". All of which were great. Really enjoyed the food and the ambience here. - our server came by twice to check if we were enjoying or meal, which we were.  - but when each course was served, they didn't bother to clear the table. And mind you, we were at a two seater table, so you need to understand how cramped that was. So we suggested that a few plates be cleared.  - we decided to order dessert. In most places, after you order your dessert, you table is cleared. But nope, not here. He brought us our dessert while there were still two plates of fries (yup, a ton of fries, we didn't really think our order through), the pizza board, two small plates, two glasses of water, and two drinks. Except for the drinks we were hoping for everything else to be cleared. So again, we requested him to clear out table.  - Check: again, there was a bit of a wait. But at this point we expected it.

It took a long time to get the bartender's attention for a drink which is annoying. I ordered a whisky sour off the classic drink portion of the menu and my drink was not classic.. when I got my drink it looked like a can of whipped cream was on the top but it was whipped egg whites. Pretty gimmicky in my opinion and it made it difficult to drink my cocktail. Was going to order food but again it was too difficult to get the bartenders attention... so we left and I would not go back. I just didn't like the atmosphere and wasn't impressed with the cocktail's. The hostess was very nice and helpful in finding seating but thats about it.",-0.7458,0.774,0.086,0.14,0.5435185185185185

I have been to so many places that will not seat you until everyone shows up, so it was a pleasant surprise to be seated. My party arrived a few minutes later. They had already eaten, I had not, so I ordered the catfish tacos. While I did enjoy them, there was so much slaw on them I could barely taste the fish. But like I said I did enjoy them. They serve a wide variety of cocktails, and even if it's not on the menu, they will create it for you. I was trying to drink lite, so I just had gin and tonics. Instead of using a lime wedge, they asked me would I like to try cucumber. It sounded intriguing so I tried it. I will never go back to lime again.

From my first memory of eating here, the mussels are absolutely delicious, so I suggest you try them if you have them. We instead ordered the tiny burgers and fries and left feeling fat and content (even without the mussels). My fiancé had the Goliath, a drink with gin and cucumbers, he loved it enough to have two. I really wanted hot tea mainly because I love tea and secondly because it's freezing cold in Chicago right now -  I'm constantly cold.

I walked through that door and saw a sleek interior and was soon welcomed by a smiling face and friendly personality. I sat at the bar with Ollie who seemed happy to hook me up. He knew all about the drinks and food. I appreciated his explanations of the components and flavor profiles. This is what I got: La Muerte: my favorite! This might be my favorite drink for the quarter and definitely a contender for the best of the year. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I really enjoyed the combination of sweet, smokey citrus. 2 Bitter 1 Brown: a bitter twist on the traditional Manhattan. The Cynar is a bitter liquor of which artichoke is the dominant flavor. As a result, the 2 Bitter 1 Brown has a vegetable undertone followed by a garlic aftertaste. Besides that, you can tell that it's a Manhattan; however, if you approach it expecting a traditional Manhattan then you'll be rudely surprised by the unusual additional flavors. Beet & Farrow Salad: The farrow is the most plentiful ingredient in this dish. I would have liked more beets and kale. The dressing on it was scrumptious and like crack. It was a generous portion (definitely a meal and not a small plate) and I ate it all. My only confusion about the dish was that part of the salad was stuffed into a pita. I ate the salad that was on the plate first and then picked up the pita and ate it like a sandwich. The pita addition tasted good but was unnecessary - especially since it was kind of messy. The price of my two drinks and salad was $37 (after tax). I thought that was perfectly acceptable for creative and scrumptious drinks. I also think it's important to note that the menu needs to be updated. They no longer have all of the ingredients to make some of their items. For example, don't get all excited about trying the Desert Rose because you'll be let down when you try to order it.",0.9802,0.701,0.191,0.108,0.6632017034456057

I should have written this review a long time ago.  My husband and I came here the Saturday after Valentines Day.  We had already had dinner, and decided to walk down to this place to sit at the bar and have a few drinks.  When we got there it was very busy, which was understandable. The hostess said it would be awhile for a table, and we said we would be happy to sit at the bar, we just wanted drinks.   So we went on in.  We stood at the bar (no seats open) and ordered 2 cocktails.  Watched a sloppily drunk couple almost fall off their bar stool, and patiently waited for a good 45 min - an hour for a seat to open up at the bar.  I went to grab the seat, and the manager was showing someone else to the same seat at the bar.  She told me I could not sit down, as seats at the bar were reserved for people who were on the seating list. I was very confused, as the hostess did not mention this to us, and Ive never heard of this policy EVER.  Seats at the bar are first come, first serve. I was very upset, and tired of standing at this point.  I explained to the manager that we were not informed of the seating policy, and I was given and insincere apology by the manager and she turned around.  I asked her to ring up our check, because we were ready to leave.  We had started a tab so needed to get our card back.  The 2 drinks we ordered were on the house.  Ok fine.  Fast forward to 2 months later, my husband found a message in his ""other"" folder on Facebook (we didn't even know it exsisted) and the manager was offering to mail us a gift certificate to come back.  Cool -- but, how in the world was he found on Facebook.  The manager must have done some SERIOUS Facebook stalking. I'm guessing they used his name from his debit card?? SO CREEPY!  He sent our address, and that was over a month ago.  No gift certificate.  This place is losing out on having my husband and I as good customers.",0.2777,0.884,0.059,0.056,0.4883141762452106

Along with catching up; we explored the drink menu, discussing the various drink options. I'm not a huge cocktail drinker, and Tiny Lounge tends to make a pretty stiff drink! One of these gets me pretty toasty. Two of these will have me very close to flat out drunk. As my friend and I discussed various menu items on the list, our bartender had been taking note. In the customer service industry, this is huge. Kudos! Right away he was able to talk about every drink we mentioned and offered up an idea of what they tasted like; and whether or not they were available.   What seemed creepy to me was the fact that dude was almost at the other end of the bar before we waved him over. Even though this was a slow Monday night; music played, and enough people were talking to make me think that you'd really have to be working hard to listen to what we were saying from that distance. Maybe it's just me. I point this out only because it seemed ironic, and in contrast to the obvious hipster style that the bartender had going on. Irony on top of irony. He was wearing some pretty cool glasses too. In a way I think I liked it. If I was a bartender, I'd totally be doing it to hear all the juicy stories that come out of the mouths of people sitting at the bar. He's still nosy! I'm totally laughing right now. If you're a regular, I'd take note! Tiny Lounge has hosted many of my first-date experiences since I have moved to the neighborhood. It was nice to be here, on a slow Monday, making different kinds of memories. I have had the food before and I tend to enjoy it very much. Don't ask me to recall what I have eaten. I just remember that what I have ordered in the past I have always liked. I think they are always changing the menu which is why I never remember what the heck I ate. Maybe I was on my second cocktail. I'm always worried this place will close down and I hope they don't! Would it kill them to lower their prices? There's nothing unique about the atmosphere. The staff allows the drinks and food to speak for itself. I enjoy the low-lit atmosphere. I love the bamboo walls. The interior is very Asian in essence and therefore minimalist in design. I really like how you don't see the bar crowded with bottles. It's genius. Always relaxing during your stay, I think this is why I have brought first dates here in the past. There aren't many distractions and the simple surroundings calm me down. Dare I call this one of my favorite bars? Not quite, but Tiny Lounge is close!",0.9982,0.781,0.185,0.035,0.5718323158323159

Drinks:  lots of fun cocktails on the menu but they were out of the primary rye they advertised in many of their signature whiskey drinks.   The kicker:  If they turned the lights up, it would be obvious that this place is extremely shoddy.  The upholstery of the booth we were seated in was worn threadbare and bits of the faux leather were flaking off.  Seriously, this would have been replaced at a Waffle House years ago.  Our bill (for 2 people, dinner and 2 drinks each) was well over $100 and not even the furniture lived up to the price point.",0.4419,0.886,0.055,0.059,0.5715277777777776

Also had the banana tort. ha-mazing. Service is always very fun and really good. One of my favs in the hood.",0.997,0.626,0.35,0.024,0.6638461538461539

Perhaps that is a good thing, as I would have spent entirely too much time and money there.  I love Tiny Lounge. The dark, cozy atmosphere is great for a date night, but it's also an ideal spot for drinks with the girls too. The cocktail menu is great. I am a huge fan of their pear, ginger, bourbon drink called the Wyatt Earp. It's fantastic. The food gets really high marks too. The three cheese truffle fries are mouth-watering and the blackened catfish tacos are out of this world.

2013-08-22,4.0,"I feel so lucky to have Tiny Lounge in the neighborhood, and only regret not having discovered it sooner.  It has a totally different vibe than any other neighborhood bar in the area.  First, as everyone has stated, there are no TVs in the joint.  This is a place to go for atmosphere and conversation.  They have some pleasant outdoor seating (I easily nabbed a table at 7 on a beautiful summer evening - there's always a nice crowd but it's never been packed).  On a cooler or rainy night, sit inside and snuggle up at a little table and peruse the menu by candlelight.  Or flashlight, because it is pretty darn dim in there.  Romantic, sexy vibe for sure - yet not pretentious like so many lounges. They have a great cocktail menu with talented bartenders.  The list is divided between classic cocktails and more unique concoctions.  I've had the Frenxh 75 (classic), the Henry's Holiday (seasonal cocktail with vodka and strawberry pure), and wine from their small (but changing and well-selected).  Never been disappointed with a beverage choice here, ever.  Cocktails are about $10, a good price in the city for something of this quality.   My friend and I ordered off the seasonal specials menu last time I was here, splitting a spinach/artichoke flatbread with a thin, crispy crust and a dusting of tangy cheese.  We also enjoyed the heirloom tomato salad with crostini.  Everything was fresh and light, and prepared skillfully.   You really can't go wrong here.  We walked away from a long wait for the rooftop at Fountainhead to come here, and I'm so glad we did.  There aren't a lot of places like Tiny Lounge in the neighborhood - you get the classy downtown vibe without the pretension or the prices.  I hope to become a regular!",0.9961,0.741,0.216,0.043,0.6501917598071443

2013-08-01,3.0,"3.5 stars to be exact.   I was a tad bit disappointed with my experience at Tiny Lounge.  For starters, I love the craft cocktail concept.  I'm not a restaurant historian by any stretch of the imagination but I believe this place was a part of the vanguard who were ushering in this concept in Chicago.  In any case, my expectations are high, appropriately aligned with the prices on their menu and therefore, not unreasonable.  And for the most part, these expectations were fulfilled.  I walk inside with my friend and the woman at the front entrance asks us for our IDs...both of us haven't been 21 for over a decade now, but ooohhhkkkaaayyyy.  Here ya go. And no, I'm not on anyone's guest list either.  Weird, whatever.  We were seated immediately on a Saturday evening and the place was hopping and full of energy.  A large party of 20 or so folks were celebrating a birthday in the back area (they sang the birthday song an hour into our meal...and not the 2 Chainz version either)  Most of the seats along the bar were taken.  I was happy we didn't have to wait or consider going someplace else.  We almost did though.  Because our waitress took FOREVER to take our order.   We spent a fair amount of time wrapping our heads around the menu.  It's extensive and all of the cocktails look delicious which makes choosing one complicated and lengthy.  And places get busy sometimes, I know.  But this guy has been by twice to fill my water.  Que sera, sera.  We ordered the panzanella salad, flatbread, and blackened catfish tacos.  Flatbread and tacos were good.  The menu bragged about the panzanella salad having homemade garlic croutons...let's just say this unrefined palette can spot a Pepperidge Farm crouton out of the box better than the best of them.  Croutons made from real bread, no matter how crunchy, will soak up all of the delicious balsamic vinegar, oil and seasonings in a panzanella salad.  Nice try though.  My friend and I engage in a long philosophical debate about how this establishment could get away with ""false advertising.""  We surmised if Pepperidge Farm or whoever else is billing their croutons as homemade on the box, ""technically"" it's NOT false advertising.  Besides, I can't find the waitress to send this back even if I wanted to be a jack*ss.  Oh, here she goes, can we order two more subourbons please?   The cocktails, as alcohol is known to do, made me forget all about the phony homemade croutons and lackluster service.     To be fair, this is not a case of the ""first finishing last.""  I don't suspect Tiny Lounge is going anywhere anytime soon.  I also don't expect this review to sink their battleship.  It would be nice if the service and food were as good as the drinks.  That's all.",0.9974,0.816,0.158,0.025,0.5392406692406693

2013-07-21,4.0,"What a hidden gem!  I first became acquainted with Tiny Lounge when I tried their excellent food at the Square Roots festival last weekend. Normally, festival food is festival food, but this burger was unique enough to draw me in to check out their restaurant.  We were pleased to get a table on the patio with no wait on a Saturday night. I suspect that the slightly off the beaten path location (located on Leavitt just past the more heavily traveled Lincoln Ave) might keep Tiny Lounge from drawing huge crowds. Because, in my opinion, if word gets out about the fantastic cocktails and food, Tiny Lounge will be much more crowded in the future.  The patio was a nice laidback atmosphere and our server was casually friendly but attentive. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, and provided excellent recommendations from the cocktail list. Speaking of the cocktail list, it is filled with creative well-crafted options. I had the Goliath and found it pleasantly refreshing and unique enough to set it apart from the cocktails you might find at other establishments. Lincoln Square may be more of a beer-centric neighborhood, but if you go to Tiny Lounge, I highly recommend trying one of the cocktails as you will not be disappointed.  In terms of the food, the menu is geared towards smaller portions--hence the ""tiny"" in Tiny Lounge. While the portion sizes may be ""tiny"" (and really, I would say more like tapas size), the flavor is not! I had the Prince Edward Island mussels which came in a very flavorful sauce. The fries were excellent as well. I look forward to returning to try out some of the other unique menu options--it was hard to decide what to order and so a return trip is definitely warranted.

2012-08-25,4.0,"Cute place, great atmosphere, and quite the selection of cocktails.  I have 2 issues. I ordered a beer that had n/a next to it.  Not knowing what that stood for and thought it was part of the name or they didn't have the information to where the beer exactly was from I didn't ask and just ordered it.  Later after I drank some of it I realized it was a non-alcoholic beer.  I know this is my fault for not asking, but I didn't know that n/a which is also the abbreviation for ""not available"" meant non-alcoholic.  I was sad!  Next issue is we were looking at the menu and asked if empanadas came without cheese, because I am dairy free.  The waiter said no, but they had a veggie pasta on special that is vegan friendly.  So I ordered it.  Came out covered in cheese.  Again, my fault for assuming that since we asked for no cheese in the empanadas and the waiter recommended the vegan friendly veggie pasta, I thought it would come without cheese on it.  But it didn't.  So I struck out twice in one night here!  haha!  But other than that it is a cute and cozy place!",0.9674,0.773,0.158,0.069,0.5122767857142857

2012-07-17,3.0,"So, I've been here twice in the last week. The first time was a Saturday. When we arrived, it wasn't too busy (maybe 8 people, total, sitting at the bar). We sat at the bar as well, and it took almost ten minutes to get water or a drink order (one of my biggest pet-peeves). Once I settled in, I was totally blown-away by their cocktail list (beer list is thoughtful and diverse, wine list is sparce). Really. Try the cocktails. A broad selection of popular and niche spirits are the components of this ""something-for-everyone"" drink menu. It's not particularly well-arranged, with the exception of the solid classic cocktail list at the end. They have the best Singapore Sling I've had in years!  We're drinkers, and don't mind waiting for craft cocktails, but it was tough to get anyone's attention for anything behind the bar. On top of that, as they were getting busier, and the support staff for the evening started trickling in, one of the bartenders, just coming on, was openly sobbing on the shoulders of the other staff, who were taken away from their tasks. I understand that everyone has bad days, but don't bring it on the floor on a Saturday night. Pretty unprofessional. Once we got our meal (mini burgers and stuffed portabella caps), it was all really tremendous for ""bar food"". Fries were a little cold, but plentiful. Great, grass-fed beef--something that's really important to us! The place is cool. Maybe a bit too cool. My second trip was on a Monday. As an industry employee, I LOVE drinking on Mondays! Lighter crowds, fewer douchebags, great specials, etc. So, my Monday visit was (obviously) even less crowded, yet it STILL took almost ten minutes to get water or order a drink. The solo bartender on this night was also present on my first visit, but had some backup to make her look slightly more competent. She wasn't even behind the bar for the first 5 minutes. She moved at a snail's pace, and could NOT have been more disinterested in her job. She made no effort to engage us, ask us questions, make suggestions. It seemed like a major inconvenience to even get her to speak to us. My first drink took almost another ten minutes for her to make, as she stared at the recipe card behind the bar 3 different times. Trying to order a second drink, she walked past me 4 different times, not busy, and did not look me in the eye, as I attempted to get her attention. I really don't know if they're just giving away bartending jobs at the bottom of PBR cans now, like Cracker Jack prizes, but that's definitely where this hipster got hers. Chunky glasses and an ironic t-shirt do not a good bartender make. We did not stay for a third drink or for dinner this time.

My boyfriend got a Singapore Sling and I just got the Gris something or other white wine. Both drinks were good but definitely not worth 25 minutes. We also had appetizers [just two] and that's it. They weren't as tasty as I expected but went well enough with my wine so I didn't complain much. So the two stars that I docked were for the slow and some what unorganized service, and because I was kind of disappointed that me and my boyfriend tried the place out because it said it specialized in drinks but when I was going through the menu [and the reason I chose to go with wine] I didn't see any combinations which suit the picky hearted. For example I was looking for something with rum, or something with champagne. I also thought they might have frozen [blended] drinks which don't include margaritas simply because on Yelp I saw pictures of their Strawberry Smoothie Martini.

The drinks vary with the season; everyone who works here is genuinely a pleasure to be around; and the roasted beet, potato, and kale plate is perfection. Without fail my whiskey sour is one of the best in the city; the soaked cherries, house made sour, and foam make it an absolute treat. I've tasted seasonal beers on tap, random sips of unique liquors, and a bit of wine here and there. Never have I been displeased with the eagerness of service, the desire to make every night I spend and every drink there special in some way. I know this sounds totally obnoxious but it's true.  Let me finish by gushing for a moment about the management and employees. Colleen is a lovely woman who's focus on the 'hood in neighborhood is very much appreciated. Mark is a talented mixologist and conversationalist. Davey is a puppeteer. He's also a very attentive server but I love that he is eccentric and funny.

2011-09-30,4.0,"I've been going to Tiny Lounge for ~8 years now, since they were in the old location.  Obviously some things have changed, but some haven't.  Some of the of the bartenders are the same as before and there are some new people.  Food and drinks are all excellent, if not a bit pricey for me.  I haven't had the brunch yet, so I can't comment about that. I would have given them a 5-star rating, except for the Groupon incident that I experienced while there.  I was smart enough to use my Groupons long before the deadline, however, my friend wasn't.  She asked me to go with her on the last day it was good.  Now, I should have said no, but I didn't...who could resist the chocolate martini and tiny burgers?!?  Needless to say, the place was packed, which was fine, we decided to wait.  We waited for about 2 hours before we were sat, even thought I kept asking my friend to leave, telling her that I would pay to take her to some other place.  She wanted to stay (God forbid she lose out on the $10 bucks she paid for the Groupon).  So this isn't really the issue.  What was the incident that put me over the edge, made me not go back for a good 4 months (after 8 years of loyal patronage), and made me sign up for a yelp account ready to give them 1-star?  A group of four people came in a good 1.5 hours after we did, got sat at ""our table"" because one of the guys' gave the nameless bartender money.  That's right...the bartender told us we were next, then I saw the one of the guys' from that party give him money and he was sat next, ~1/2 hour after getting there.  Who does that to a loyal customer that has been frequenting the place since is was in it's old location? BTW, these people were from the suburbs, and likely won't come back to send their hard earned cash at this place.  How do I know you ask, because when they walked in the place to put their name on the list, they asked how long ""for new customers that came all the way from the suburbs?""  Ugh, it puts a sour taste in my mouth just remembering it all.",0.988,0.844,0.114,0.042,0.4674832743014561

The cocktail list was probably my favorite.  I love a good cocktail, and having so many to choose from makes me happy.  While it did have a lot of the trendy, shi-shi ingredients that you will find on a lot of the fancy cocktail lists around (St. Germain, Veev, etc), they also had a lot of no-nonsense, delicious, classic drinks that seemed very fitting to the season.  I'm tired of looking a cocktail list up and down and not knowing half of the ingredients on it and finally just ordering a dirty martini (not that I don't like dirty martinis...).  I had two of the summery drinks with dinner and then had a desserty cocktail in lieu of a regular dessert (which is  one of my favorite things to do). I also loved that there was such a large section of a la carte items on the menu.  I always like to split items with other people at my table because I like the variety, and variety is not often an option on a standard menu of appetizers and entrees.  With the a la carte section I was able to get a little bit of everything that I wanted without ordering too much food, which is something I am very good at.

2011-04-21,3.0,"Tiny Lounge, your are tiny, in space and somewhat in taste. I was excited to go here after reading the reviews. Meeting a group of friends I wanted to share some small plates and get a few beers and maybe a cocktail. Yes, share small plates, which per my other reviews I do not like. And, after this experience I reaffirm my dislike for small plates. On this visit, I thought otherwise cuz I could eat a bunch of stuff but little did I know the group kept getting bigger with people I didn't know and I only got a little food and a few drinks for $40. The food: The only thing that was that tasty was the mini burgers - actually quite good. But, the prices are certainly not tiny. Basically, they are $5 each. I think it's a bit overpriced but with the bacon, cheese and tasty burger patty on a small pretzel roll I didn't complain.  But, I only got a half...boo hoo for me. The cheese fries...definitely not worth $12. They were not that good and not worth that price. What exactly was on those fries to warrant $12, you ask? I don't have a clue...maybe it was the truffle oil that I didn't taste. The seared ahi tuna tacos sucked. I'll just say it. Bland and limp. I didn't even want a second one. Grilled veggie platter was passable and that was that. The drink: Good beer list. I liked seeing Metropolitan's new brew, Iron Works Alt. I was tasty. So was the Half Acre Daisy Cutter. The standard list of ""unique"" cocktails for $10-$12 dollars didn't seem worth it to me. I had the laskshmi which was nice, I guess, but just didn't blow me away.  The drink had hayman's old tom gin, st. germain, mathilde pear liqueur, cava - maybe a bit too tangy for me. I do love my gin but perhaps it was the pear liqueur and cava that three me off. The service: It was decent. Nice server with lapses in attentiveness but overall fine. After we sat down she did tell us that we'd have to move at 8pm because a private party had the entire back space. It would have been nice to know that when we walked in. She did say she'd let us stay as long as possible and by the time we were done and gone the party had not started yet. Well, that's it. Not sure I'd go back. Not much to draw me in there.

Don't love the fact that they were out of ingredients for more than one drink and had only one waitress working. We went on a weekday, and only a couple tables were occupied at about 8 when we got there, so that was fine, but as it filled up, she got way too busy to take care of us consistently. Not her fault at all, but it was a little frustrating. She did give good suggestions when she was around. The food was good. And my ""vegan"" friend to got a burger, which was pretty awesome. And it came on a pretzel roll, which was also awesome. She also really liked the fries and whatever that catsup with curry in it is (which seems to be cool now?). A definite step above typical bar food, but not mind-blowing. Cocktails (which are $9-$11) were good. I tried the Stalker and a whisky drink I can't remember the name of. The Stalker is a gin drink that uses fresh celery juice along with a couple other flavors (lemon, maybe?), which sounds really weird but actually worked together really well. It was good, but lighter tasting than I prefer. Just my preference, though, not a problem with the drink. In my second drink I could taste the whiskey much better than I could taste the gin in my first drink, and the other flavors worked well together to make a pretty solid drink. My friend liked one of her drinks a lot but described the other one as tasting ""clear."" Overall, not my favorite place ever, but a good experience.

The burgers can be ordered as a meal with fries, but if you're opting for a different appetizer, I'd recommend just ordering the burgers a la carte ($4 a pop isn't bad).  I'll be staying clear of the empanadas next time, but I tried the pizzetta bianca, which was fairly good.  Highly recommend the burgers.  We didn't order the mussels, but from looking at others' tables, it looks like they're served with pretty good sized portions.   4 stars--pleasant service (although lengthy--expect to take your time on a busy night), mostly very good food, and we left happy and very full.

2011-01-26,3.0,"Yes, I was one of the loads of people who got the Groupon to this place. Unfortunately, it seems like they sold WAY too many Groupons. We tried going to Tiny Lounge multiple times over the last few months to use that Groupon, and unfortunately each time the wait was ridiculously long (over an hour for a table and then an hour plus for food), so we kept passing and going to other places. It sort of left a sour taste in my mouth, but I guess I shouldn't have expected anything else - if the place is called TINY, there is probably going to be a wait huh? Of course, today is the last day you can use the Groupon. Luckily, I was able to go yesterday right after they opened, so there were no problems getting a seat this time.  I think I was one of target demographics for the Groupon though. I live in Lincoln Square - how had I not heard of this place? Probably because there is no sign and unless you see the outdoor seating in the summer, you're going to miss it. Anyway, on to the experience. This is a trendy, upscale place that focuses on good drinks and small plates of food. Don't come here expecting a full dinner. This would make for a great place to get your drink on. I had a glass of Matilda, which was fine. The beer list is good, but not great. Especially annoying is the fact that they have beers listed on their website that are not actually available when you go to the location. Doh! The bartender was very nice, and the drinks were decent. Aside from the aforementioned Matilda, I had St. Sarita (w/tequila) which I didn't like, a Wyatt Earp (w/Whiskey), which I really didn't like, and then a Wizzo (w/tequila), which I loved. For food, I got the burger plate. For $12, you get two small burgers and a small basket of fries. Although overpriced, the food is actually very good! You could opt for 3 burgers for $15 as well, but don't expect to get filled up unless you're dining alone (I was).  So to summarize, okay drinks, cool atmosphere, nice people, and a pretty good time overall. But: CROWDED in the evening, EXPENSIVE across the board, and SLOW if you are eating. If you don't mind waiting over an hour for a table and an additional hour for food, you'll be fine. It's a great place to get drinks!

When we realized that the 3rd groupon was about to expire and we went to use it on Monday night. Ugh... the place was PACKED with fellow groupon procrastinators. We only waited about 15 minutes for a table, which is fine, but the real problems started after we got sat.  Our server (ironically named Patience) was...oblivious. Read: She was clearly in the weeds and seemed not to give a f*ck about anything. My drink took at least 20 min to arrive and once it did she tried to run off right away- I had to ask her if we could order. I'm sorry but I shouldn't have to ask if my server can take my order. Ok, so the order finally gets placed and then she returns at least another 30 min later and tells us that they are out of the tacos (which were the main thing that we ordered). Ok fine. We'll eat our pizzetta and figure out something else to order. 45 min later she finally arrived to take our dinner order. We ordered the check. And I had to ask her to remove the roasted beets. ""Oh, sorry you didn't like them."" No honey, we NEVER got them! Yeah, I'm bitching a lot but the thing is if she had even tried to be sympathetic or apologetic about the wait we would have been fine. Being polite to your customers goes a long way.  It's sad that this place couldn't handle a full crowd. The first 2 times we visited the place was about half-full and we had a great experience.

2011-01-19,4.0,"I must say Tiny Lounge is sort of an enigma to me. On one hand they tout themselves as a cocktail bar, but upon browsing their menu I was intrigued by the selection of craft beers and even more shocking...the wine! I was just about floored when I saw them offering a bottle of Turley Dogtown Vineyards Zinfandel for just $60 per bottle. That must be the best value for wine I've seen in Chicago yet! Our bartender mentioned that the owner has an incredible palate and selects some outstanding wines to offer. Indeed the wine list is 'tiny' but it packs a punch as they would say. Unfortunately my wife and I weren't in the mood for a nice Zin, so she opted for a cocktail and I went with a glass of the Lagunitas little sumpin'.  Now the food menu is something to admire for comfort food afficionados like ourselves. Ugggh I wanted to order everything on the menu. Fortunately our bartender acted as the voice of reason and steered us in the right direction. The tiny burgers with the fries and the pizza bianca (shitake mushrooms, fontina cheese, truffle oil, parsley) what more could you ask for? Both were delicious. The tiny burgers were uncharacteristically tiny...meaning they were much, much bigger than expected and the fries were oh so delicious with truffle aioli to boot! Beef, cheese, truffle and mayo all my main food groups on a single plate. The pizza was also good, but I thought the crust was a bit too thin and they didn't seem to emphasize the mushrooms as much as I would have liked. It was still good, but there was definitely a tiny bit of room for improvement.

However, I was excited to try their menu. It's filled with all kinds of interesting ""bites"".  I know everyone will make fun of me but arriving at 6 is probably best, unless you like to wait. My feeling is that when I'm hungry I want to eat, it's better for your body to eat earlier anyways, and it gives me more time to play in the night. I suggest 6 because by 7 this place is packed with a line out the door and it's extremely loud. Hell, it was loud at 6 but we were right under the speaker. I would have said something but the music was good (Modest Mouse, KOL, Interpol).  I said ""bite"" because some of the portions are more then a bite but they do give you an option for a smaller portion. Some worked and some didn't but I dug it, simple and tasty. Tiny fries -sea salt, tamarind ketchup, roasted garlic mayo. Nothing Tiny about them and the portion size is for at least 3 people. The mayo is overwhelming but that ketchup is awesome! Pizzetta Margherita- roma tomatoes, herb-infused olive oil, mozzarella, fresh basil. Very good and at $10 it's perfect for two people. Grilled Chicken Empanadas-achiote, fresh oregano, Cotija cheese, Chimichurri sauce. It didn't work at all. Too much breading and the worst part was the chicken. Way over seasoned, it was hard to eat! Ahi Tuna tacos-grilled ahi tuna, avocado, zucchini, red pepper, wasabi. Perfect little three bite tacos, excellent!

We didn't have to wait too long for drinks or food, and the food was great. The fries are amazing and served with a highly addictive garlic mayo. The burgers were perfectly cooked and served on pretzel buns that were able to stand up to their juicy deliciousness.

The Ahi Tuna Tacos were really good.  Thinly sliced fresh veggies sit with the ahi tuna and give it a fresh flavor.  As my friend said, ""it just tastes fresh and healthy"".  MMmmm. The chimichurri sauce for the chicken empanadas was a bit garlicky, so if you like it that way it was great!  My friend enjoyed the dish quite a bit more than I did. We got a bottle of white spanish wine, that was moderately priced and paired well with both of our meals. To top off the night, we had a couple drinks at the bar.  If the night is slow, ask the bartender to make you a surprise drink and see what he comes up with.  We had two fantastic drinks with fresh squeezed fruit and interesting liqueurs.  Yummy!

2010-12-30,4.0,"You know what?  I liked it.  It's great when you can walk into a neighborhood place with no reservation and scoop up a table just like that.  OK, yes, it was the last available table, but still.   I really came for the cocktails so I'll start with those.  Looking at the menu, the main focus appears to be fresh juices and ingredients.  At our server's recommendation, I started with the Wyatt Earp.  I prefer drinks that are a little more spirit forward but it was tasty.  Maybe a little too heavy on the lemon, but I could definitely tell that they use fresh fruit juices which is nice.  Since that one went down way too quickly, I followed it up with an Esprit de Corps.  Now that was a good drink.  Rich, spicy goodness! Since many of the items on the menu are named ""tiny"", I was anticipating that the portions would be, well, tiny.  Tiny fries, tiny burgers, etc. so we ordered a few things.  The first out was the lamb pizzetta.  Since I'm generally not a fan of lamb or mint, you'd think this would be a recipe for disaster for me...but I had a good feeling.  Turned out I was right, it was a good pizzetta.  The lamb combined with the goat cheese and yogurt was awesome! Next out were the tiny burgers that were anything but tiny.  Think regular sized burger from when you were a kid.  On a pretzel bun!  Nothing like the bite sized sliders that I'm used to.  Now I'm thankful that we didn't order the ""tiny"" fries.  I saw a giant plate of those arrive at the next table and was glad that we stuck with the small portion that came with the burgers.  So anyway, the burgers were juicy, rich and delicious.  So good! Since they were out of the BBQ pork ribs, we decided to get a couple of ahi tacos and some roasted beets.  The tacos were light and flavorful.  The beets were a little overcooked in my opinion but for $3 I wasn't too upset about it. We finished the meal with the flourless chocolate cake.  It was more like a brownie but that ice cream that came with it was amazing.  It tasted like spicy orange but I think it was supposed to be caramel.  Whatever it was, it was incredible.  Glad they only serve a small scoop! I like that they offer different portion sizes so that you can mix and match.  Keep in mind, though, that the menu on the website has more items on it than the menu in the restaurant so don't get your heart set on anything before going in.",0.9984,0.761,0.215,0.024,0.5506577280162185

Once inside though the space was sophisticated and polished. The layout feels a bit cramped but works. I just missed the 'lounge' part of it. It's a 'loungey' restaurant at best but not really a place to sip cocktails with friends. However, the upscale bar food was delicious and so were the drinks.

Surprisingly, this place doesn't try too hard, which is a good thing considered the aforementioned.  I'm going to break this review down into its components: 1) Marinated Olives -- 2 stars. A tad bit too salty for my taste.  2) Ahi Tuna Tacos -- 2 stars. Very bland and boring. Thick chunks of lightly seared tuna, but like I said, it's bland and boring. The accompanying wasabi couldn't even wake these up.  3) Tiny Burgers -- 5 stars. THE FRIGGIN BEST MINI BURGERS EVER!  4) Tiny Fries -- 3 stars. Nothing special about the fries, but the tamarind ketchup was a delightful new twist. And you know it's all about the sauce. As far as drinks, I tried to order the Henry's Holiday, but they were out of strawberries. I overheard another couple try to order a different cocktail and they were out of an ingredient for that cocktail, too. Frustrating! Although, they did have an interesting beer list which consisted of several Japanese beers, including hatachino white ale ($11). Kirin Light was also reasonably priced ($4).

2010-10-19,4.0,"Food:  4 Service:  4 Atmosphere:  5 Value:  2 My wife and I went for an early dinner on a Saturday night to beat the rush-great decision.  We had no trouble getting a table but there were enough people there to make the restaurant feel inviting.  It had a sophisticated vibe but didn't feel pretentious (after all it is in Lincoln Square).  It's the kind of restaurant where you immediately feel transported from the outside surroundings of the neighborhood once you step inside.  There wasn't a whole lot for kosher/vegetarians on the menu, but we ended up splitting the Pizetta Margherita, Ahi Tuna Tacos, and Truffle Cheese Fries. The Pizetta was similar to a flatbread and more like an appetizer than an entree.  Nonetheless, it was crispy, fresh, and delicious.  The cheese was melted properly and not overdone, and it had just the right amount of basil.  No element of the dish was overlooked and we savored every bite.   The Tacos were a bit plain, served with a simple slaw and no sauce.  At $14, I expected the four tacos to be a little more filling, but then again, the name of the restaurant should have given me enough warning.  The tuna was a little overdone but still had decent flavor.  The wasabi definitely elevated the dish, but I would have liked to see some avocado/wasabi/cilantro mayo in there to really tie everything together. The Fries were definitely the most memorable dish of the evening, partly for their richness, partly for their size, and partly for the fact that we couldn't finish them all.  Don't worry about the $9 price tag-they serve up enough fries to feed 3-4 people.  As you know, I'm a sucker for french fries and when you add truffle oil and cheese to the mix, there's little that can go wrong (But see my review of DMK Burger Bar).  Although most restaurants stick to just one cheese, this place packs gruyere, fontina, and mozzarella into every crispy bite.  When you combine the cheeses with the white truffle oil and house-made tamarind ketchup (ask for it-trust me), you've got food nirvana.  The only problem is that we found out it IS possible to have too much of a good thing:  The fries were so rich and plentiful we couldn't even finish them.  We wanted to eat more, but we hit a wall at a certain point and had to call it quits.   Overall, I would recommend Tiny Lounge if you're looking for a new spot to try in a new neighborhood, and you're not incredibly hungry.  There is a fabulous drink menu but, like the food, it's a little pricey for what you get.  The food and atmosphere make me want to sprint back, but the prices ultimately turn that sprint into more of a leisurely stroll.   [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]",0.9978,0.792,0.167,0.041,0.5482103113459045

I'm not certain that we'll be running back to dine again without a discount, unfortunately, but we still had a good time when we were there. While it's not the best atmosphere for quiet conversation, Tiny Lounge has a fun vibe. It's really busy in here, even on a weeknight. And, true to its name, this place is TINY. And narrow.

If you're at all picky, you might find your options somewhat limited. Fortunately, we found what we were looking for in the trio of medium-rare Tiny Burgers, which were just enough for the two of us, accompanied by shrimp skewers and some mighty tasty cocktails.

We went on a rainy Saturday night around 8pm and the place was already jumpin. We were lucky enough to find 2 spots at the bar right away. I ordered the ""Stalker"" for a cocktail which had gin and celery, lemon and simple syrup. I was hoping it would taste mostly like celery and it did! My friend ordered the ""Naked"" which had gin, vermouth, and hand stuffed blue olives. I thought it tasted great, but she is more of a dirty martini girl and thought it lacked flavor. It wasn't the drink's fault -- just a preferred taste issue. We ordered the ahi tuna tacos and pizzetta blanca. Both dishes arrived quickly and tasted great. The ahi tuna tacos had vibrant flavors and crunch from the cucumbers, red peppers and green onions that were julienned on top -- $15 for 4 small tacos. Pricey but it's a hip lounge that serves bar food in small plate form. It was expected. The pizzetta blanca had roasted shiitake mushrooms, fontina cheese, truffle oil, and fresh parsley on a cracker thin crust. It was my favorite dish of the night. Lots of flavor and excellent texture. Great for sharing as well. For $12 -- well worth it. We ended with the ""pain perdu"" that was freshly made banana bread with roasted banana ice cream, carmelized bananas, and topped with creme anglaise. YUM YUM YUM.  Our ending cocktails were my favorite -- the ""lakshmi"" was made with hayman's old tom gin, st. germain, berentzen pear, and cava. They shake it right in front of you so little shards of ice are floating in the drink at first. I loved that for some reason. It was a well balanced sweetness -- tasted like a riesling in cocktail form. My friend ordered the ""st. sarita"" which mixed 100% agave tequila, st. germain, grapefruit juice, agave nectar.

It's an odd business idea, because its hidden under the awning and behind the outdoor beer garden area of Bowman's, and you don't even notice it. Especially since it's dark inside and out and you enter through a narrow door. It's like it's meant to be hidden. Which would be cool if it were unknown. But it's not, it's busy. Which leads me to: You can't get anyone on the phone. You can get a voicemail, but they won't call you back. So how do you make reservations?  I guess online, but what if you have questions? I guess you check in with Yelp and hope you've got a FAQ. Aside from these, Tiny Lounge is a nice spot. We came in at 7:30 on a Thursday night and it was 40% full, so we got a candleglow table with no one sitting on top of us. Sooooo nice. Our server, Ollie, was great and friendly and came by perfectly often, the ""tiny"" portions were severely generous and the drinks were ohmygawd strong and delicious and different without fruitiness and mixed so kindly that they were actually almost worth their city prices. We came on a Groupon and we're glad we did, but we'll only go back for a last-stop drink or two. The food -- the tiny burgers and the empanadas everyone has recommended -- was kind of bland.

The best thing about the Tiny Lounge is it maintains its status as a hidden treat.  I was there on a Wednesday night and while there was a decent turnout it wasn't crowded at all.  The music fit the vibe of the modernly sleek and stylish bar perfectly, and the bartender was very friendly and helpful.  He introduced me to the Laguanitas Little Sumpin Sumpin hella hopped up wheat brew and offered me a sample to check it out.  It was quite tasty so I have yet another craft beer to enjoy and for the time being it's on tap at the Tiny Lounge.",0.9893,0.813,0.159,0.028,0.47015151515151526

They were juicy for how small they were, on a pretzel roll and we gobbled them up quickly. I have to say I was happy with the selection. We also ordered up a side of fries to go with that. I think we got the bottom of the bag as most of the fries were super tiny which resembled the crumbs of ruffled lays chips. The two sauces that came with the fries were tamarind ketchup and roasted garlic mayo. Both very delicious.

2010-08-23,4.0,"Ahoy my noble boozers!  My virtual comrade in arms Johnny T speaks the truth.  Sarah at Tiny Lounge is quality bartender material.  When Kelly and I made our second sojourn to the new location last weekend, Sarah remembered us even though our first visit was 10 months ago.  Take that, Sam Malone! The beauty of Tiny Lounge is you can be a bourbon boozer and have fun there without even drinking bourbon.  I stepped out on a Wild on Rye evening and barely missed by Kentucky mistress.  My after-work relief cure commenced with a Sarah Original - the Wyatt Earp - rye, ginger, pear juice and lemon.  It is a refreshing summer whiskey cocktail perfect for easing your way into evening libations.  I followed with a sazerac full of licorice absinthe-y goodness, and commenced my evening with an Old Fashioned that would make the Drake proud - gushing with rye and muddled fruit in an oversized glass. None of this is to say that you can't enjoy bourbon here - they have one of my favorite high end affordable bourbons, Hirsch Small Batch, and other selections, as well.  Contrary to Longman & Eagle, Tiny Lounge's bourbon list evokes its name and keeps the list small but high quality. But Tiny Lounge does not stop at whiskey cocktails.  They have excellent gin cocktails.  Kelly enjoyed a Stalker (every woman should have one) but it really is an acquired taste - gin and celery juice.  You have to love your celery.  More to my speed was Kelly's second selection, the Lakshmi - gin, St. Germain, pear liqueur and cava.  I love love love St. Germain and Kelly and I drink Gin, St. Germain, and soda at home.  The cava kicks it up a notch and I think Salman Rushdie would have stuck around if Ms. Padma came up with this herself. The only shortcoming of Tiny Lounge, if you can call it one, is that the menu (essentially tapas), cannot provide sufficient sustenance to compete with the cocktails.  Having said that, the ahi tuna tacos are superb and surprisingly meaty - you should definitely try them to balance the booze until you head out to a full dinner, preferably one close by.

The con: This is a problem with almost every place except Violet Hour - the freakin' noise level. When you see people complaining over and over in reviews about the noise level then fix the problem. This is a lounge, not a dance club or a live music venue. People go here to hang out with their friends and chat. I don't want blood coming out of my ears by the end of the night.

2010-08-16,3.0,"Tiny Lounge is like the second cousin to Violet Hour and while I like Violet Hour better, this place is in my 'hood and doesn't boast the hellatious lines one finds at VH.  Came here late Saturday night and walked inside to try and snag a table. Wow, this place was deafening. I was pleasantly surprised when the host said a table outside would be opening up shortly because I don't think I could have handled the decibel levels inside.  An outside table became available after only a couple of minutes and sitting outside is the only way to go.  Our server seemed a little put off like she didn't want to be there but on a lovely summer's eve, I wasn't going to let that put a damper on my spirits.  All of the cocktails are cleverly named and all of them sounded delicious and most are priced at $9, which I think is fair.  For our first round we ordered a Wyatt Earp (rye whisky, pear juice and ginger-infused simple syrup) and a Henry's Holiday (Tito's handmade vodka, muddled strawberries and fresh lemon juice). I didn't care for the Wyatt Earp, but then again, I don't like whisky or pear, so what did I expect? The Henry's Holiday was delicious and you could really taste the strawberries. I sucked that baby down lickety split.  Next up I ordered a Tito's Hammock (vodka, cucumber, fresh lemon and simple syrup). I am a sucker for cocktails with cucumber and this one was well-made and a perfect foil to the warm weather.  My companion's next drink was a St Sarita (tequila, St Germain, agave nectar and grapefruit juice) and this drink was a winner too. We reckoned we better order some food to soak up some of liquor so we ordered the ""Tiny Fries"" and two ahi tuna tacos.  The tacos came out fast and they were quite tasty. Two corn tortillas topped with lightly seared tuna, julienned carrots and cucumber, topped with a huge sliver of avocado and a wasabi sauce. Twenty minutes later the fries still hadn't come out so we inquired about them to our server, who again, seemed annoyed at having to check.  Finally they came out and I have to say they were worth the wait. A small cone of crispy shoestring fries with sea salt and served with a sweet tamarind ketchup and garlic aioli. Good stuff indeed.  Another round was ordered and quickly drank because the patio was closing. Boy those seemingly inexpensive cocktails sure added up and it was then that I noticed that after three tall drinks, I had nary a buzz and I am a total lightweight. So in the end, a hefty tab was paid for not a lot of return.  I purchased a Groupon for Tiny Lounge so I will have to come back and use it. I'm hoping (probably against hope) that the drinks will be stronger and the service a little more friendly.",0.9975,0.786,0.18,0.034,0.527013521457966

2010-08-08,2.0,"I was disappointed. The menu looked interesting for both food and drinks, and with their ingredients they could do a good job, but nothing was very good. At this price point ($60+ for two drinks, two entrees, one appetizer), there are tons of places that do the same thing much better. Pros: --Space has a cozy look and feel; plenty of tables, but still intimate --Prompt and attentive service --Open late seven days a week --Well-stocked bar with high-end liquors and fresh-squeezed juices (at this level, these should be a given, but I'll throw them one here) Cons: --Food lacks flavor, underseasoned --Cocktails sound in concept, but somehow off in execution --Very limited food menu We drank:  --""Stalker"" cocktail with gin, celery juice, and lemon. It was OK but tasted mostly like sweet celery. Needed a lot more gin, some kind of an herbal kick to make it not so one note. --""Esprit de corps"" cocktail with armagnac and about seven other ingredients. Again, not bad, but too strong an emphasis on sweet vermouth, and the mint should have been muddled and strained out, rather than chopped up and floating on top of the drink (gross). Also, both drinks were served with a layer of quite large ice chips floating on the top, which were unpleasantly crunchy in the mouth and obstructed the flavors of the drinks. They were better once the ice melted, but who wants to wait that long to drink their cocktail? We ate: --Truffle cheese fries, with three kinds of cheese, truffle oil, scallion. Sounds awesome, but was kind of meh. I didn't get much truffle flavor, it needed salt in a major way, and the cheese was dry, should have been thinned to a sauce. --Pizzetta bianca with shiitakes and truffle oil. Strong aroma of truffles, but the cheese was totally flavorless and the whole thing was greasy and soggy. --Ahi tuna tacos. Not horrible, but would have been much better with a sauce and rarer fish. Tasted sort of like a warm sock. This place seems to make its reputation on the bar, and since I only tasted their original drinks and not any classic cocktails, I can't say that there aren't some good, well-mixed drinks to be had.

2010-07-30,2.0,"i didn't have drinks at tiny lounge. let me say that here and now.  we had a groupon and we headed over on a wednesday evening around 8 pm. upon entering, it was a little crowded and noisy but that is expected from a tiny lounge space. the server told us to sit wherever, so we awkwardly and unsuccessfully searched for a table inside before settling on a table outside.  that's cool dudes, its a lovely evening. the server came by and dropped off a two-page menu (one was already scattered on our table). here's a thing: they have paper menus. mine varied slightly from my boyfriend's, so i guess they change their menu just that often. its a personal thing, but paper menus are gross and sloppy, especially when they appear to be simple word documents without any time or creativity put into them. when our server came back, we ordered tiny fries, the pizzetta bianca, and the pizzetta margherita. no drinks, so i can't comment on their quality. the fries came out fairly quickly, i assume an appropriate time for fry preparation. the guy who brought them out was really friendly and asked if we'd had them before, explaining the house sauces they come with. the garlic mayo was great and was the standout.  as a fan of flavored ketchups (what up, evo's!), i thought the tamarind ketchup was good but not the best thing i've had. then we waited. and we waited. and waited some more. fries were good to keep me occupied for a little while but after 20 or 30 minutes post-fries we started to get a little antsy.  finally, our time had come. they brought out the pizzas on peels, which is always a nice touch, if a little cumbersome on a small table.  the margherita was cheesy and tomato-y and fairly good, but lacking. the pizzetta bianca was... bad. guys, it was just bad. it had very little flavor and the mushrooms were dry. while mine was piping hot and melty, the bianca sort of looked like it had been sitting out for a while. my thought was that maybe mine had burned or been destroyed in some way and they left the other to wait while making the replacement. or they made that one first and let it sit there. or it was just badly made. there's pretty much no good answer. we ate maybe a quarter of the pizzetta bianca and less than half of the other one.  while the margherita wasn't bad, it was really only good in comparison to the other.  out of food wasting guilt, we asked our server for boxes.  in hopes that dessert would be the saving grace, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. oh boy! when it arrived, we still had everything from our meal on our tiny table, as our server had yet to come back with some boxes or take anything away. after some rearranging, we dug into the cake.  oh... boy. it was dry and crumbly; even using a spoon i lost about half of each bite before it reached my mouth. the caramel ice cream was good though it didn't taste caramel-y.  i could be wrong; it was be hard to tell since it was about teaspoon-sized.  bummer dessert.  overall, we just wanted to get the hell out of there.  the food was disappointing and the service was terrible. i can't see myself going back except maybe if a good friend was moving away forever or had a huge life crisis and wanted to meet for a drink. and it was free.   actually, i think i'd still go somewhere else.  truth.",0.449,0.759,0.123,0.119,0.526776556776557

This is a great place to grab a drink and chill beans for a while.  Service: Mark may be the nicest bartender I've ever met. He really takes time to get to know his customers. All the bartenders will listen to what you like and make good suggestions. Plus, they all know a ton about alcohol and liquor which is pretty swell. Ambiance: Really chill vibe with great music. The bar is awesome - the backsplash on the far wall is really cool - a pattern of recessed and protruding wooden slits. There are booths in the back which are also great for small groups.  Drinks: I had the Espirit de Corps and the Wyatt Earp. My buddy had the sidecar and Tito's hammock. The espirit de corps may be my new favorite drink in Chicago.  The bitterness of the armagnac is perfectly balanced by the lemon juice and the sweet vermouth. I've also realized that only good things happen when mint is an ingredient in your drink. The Wyatt Earp is pretty badass - maybe even more-so than Kurt Russell's version in ""Tombstone"".  It combines rye whiskey, ginger syrup and pear juice. The Rittenhouse was all gone, so Mark made it with Bean - it was still pretty badass.  My buddy's Tito's hammock was awesome.

I do agree that the wait staff are very attentive and friendly; our plates were cleared quickly and drinks were quick to be refilled. The decor is pretty, if rather impersonal. Lots of light wood and very little light to be found.  I was super impressed with the beer list (Left Hand Milk Stout on tap?!??!), but decided to go for a cocktail since that's their big thing. I got a Wyatt Earp which was.. fine. I mean, not worth the $10. It hadn't been mixed right, so every other sip was like slamming a straight shot of vodka. When I did get a sip where everything had gloriously come together, it was pretty good. I got the ahi tuna tacos for a late night snack. Again, pretty good. I prefer DOC Wine Bar's ahi burgers for something similar.  It wasn't bad.. I just don't get the raves.",0.9906,0.714,0.258,0.029,0.531662826420891

2010-02-01,5.0,"I discovered Tiny about a month ago, and it instantly became my favorite bar (a bit dangerous given that I live in walking distance).  The customer service is excellent, and even when the place is packed the bartenders will work to find you a seat.  They also know how to manage the crowd, making sure everyone has a good time but can still get home safely...  I really can't say enough about the bartenders.  They are friendly and willing to adjust your cocktail to your particular taste.  If you are interested in learning about liquor or beer, they are the people to talk to. As others have mentioned, the music is of high quality.  There have been nights when I ended up sitting around a lot longer than I planned because one good song followed another.  The music matches the energy of the crowd, and varies depending on what night of the week you go. The liquor, beer, and cocktail selections are all great.  I'm slowly making my way through their collection of liquors...  but it's hard to go slow because they're all so tasty!  The bottled beer list is almost daunting and has something for everyone, which is also true of the beers on tap.  I generally stick to straight liquor and beer, but the cocktails are also delicious (sometimes a little too easy going down).  My favorites at this point are the Lakshmi, the Sidecar, and the Sazerac. The only criticism I have of Tiny is that the menu isn't particularly veggie-friendly.  When I see the mini-burgers come out, my mouth starts watering and I long for a tiny veggie burger.  But no luck.  I generally stick to the fries (watch out, they are highly addictive) and the pizza.  I've heard that the meat items are delicious if you swing that way. So check out the Tiny Lounge.  Get there early on the weekends to get a seat without a wait, but if you want more room and a mellow atmosphere, go during the week.  A word to the wise, it's always good to treat the bartenders well, and I've never seen them turn down a shot of Zubrowka vodka ;).",0.9961,0.796,0.179,0.026,0.6038372093023255

As for the food, I've only had the fish tacos, which were great. But $15 for fish tacos seems a bit steep. I think they need a few small plates under the $10 price point.

Fortunately on Monday night the music volume was turned way down.  Several of my friends had difficulty finding this place (the sign is really hard to read and from the street it's not clear if the restaurant is even open) but soon enough we were settled at a table by the windows.  Our server was very attentive and came over immediately to take drink orders.  Unfortunately, they were out of some of the drink selections my friends wanted and the duck empanadas (which my friend had her heart set on) have been dropped from the menu.  I went with the Tiny Cider and Tiny Burgers (which came with Tiny Fries...none of which were actually tiny except the burgers.  And really, even those were more mini than tiny.)  They brought the food out as it was finished - which meant my friends that ordered pizzas got their food about 10 minutes before my friends who ordered the ahi tuna tacos - not cool Tiny Lounge.  We all agreed the food was good but, at $15 for the tacos and burgers, I felt it was a little overpriced.  Our server was a total champ, throughout, though - he kept us updated on the status of our food and frequently dropped by to see if we needed anything.  He also brought us a dessert with candle for the birthday girl, which was comped.   Overall I like Tiny Lounge.  There's really nothing else like it in Lincoln Square - the closest thing I can think of in the area would either be Marty's or In Fine Spirits in Andersonville.  I wasn't impressed enough to make this a terribly regular destination (and at $40 with tax and tip included for my burgers and two drinks, it'd be an expensive place to frequent) but I'd certainly visit again.",0.976,0.815,0.111,0.074,0.47218925518925514

There were so many interesting sounding cocktails on the list and then I spied a drink called the Sazerac. I've never heard of a Sazerac, so I asked our waitress/bartender. She was amazingly knowlegable and sold the hell out of that drink (it's apparently one of the oldest known cocktails...look it up, it's fascinating).  All I have to say about the Sazerac was holy hot devil in a highball! That is no drink for the faint of heart. The execution was brilliant, but I sort of felt my soul die sip by sip. Fortunately, my husband had a delightful, refreshing cocktail that I could periodically sip to cleanse my palate. And thankfully, there was a carafe of water on our table.

The people were a lot nicer than in similar places I've been to, although the service was a little slow (I know it was a Friday, but we were there around 7 and although it was almost full, it wasn't overly busy). Another thing was although the food was great, a lot of it is overpriced (3 mini burgers for $15 - what!) and their drink prices are comparably a little steep, too. With that said, their drink selection is great. They have a huge selection of beer, a nice little offering of creative cocktails (I had one that was vodka with strawberry puree and lemon juice - delicious and perfect for a Spring evening), and a good wine section, too.  The food, while kind of overpriced, was really good. The mini burgers I already mentioned were hands-down the BEST I've ever had, made on pretzel rolls and really good quality beef. I could probably eat them every day.  We also shared the surf and turf tacos, which were also very good. I think their menu is really creative and has a lot to offer, although don't go there if you want a huge meal - it's all shareables, but then again, it's a lounge.  Overall, I would go back.

The martini's were good, but not kick-me-on-my-ass-$10-strong-good.  They were nice recipes though, just needed to be martini-strong, not mixed-drink strong.  Plus, if you order drinks at a table, you get hit with tax (versus at the bar, tax included), so your $10 martini is really $11.  Not a huge deal, but I never understand why table-side vs. bar tax structure is different.  The other problem is that all the martini's are listed by name on the menu, but with no descriptions.  Who the hell knows what a ""summer solstice"" martini is without some sort of description?  The poor server probably has to recite the ingredients of the whole martini list 87 times each night.  And probably multiple times per table, once people have had a couple.  Oy.

There were probably 8 types of red wine, and I think about the same for white - all of which were $7 or $8 a (generous) glass.  And while we weren't there for beer, let's talk about the beer list.  It's HUGE.  It takes up an entire page - easily 40 types of beer, if not more.  I would have expected Tiny Lounge to be more focused on specialty drinks from the look of it, but even though it's got a slightly swanky/lounge-y feel, the place is super down to earth. We'd already eaten dinner so we weren't hungry, but I commented to our Jonas Brother server about how fantastic the fries smelled.  He (of course) said we could just get an order of fries, but I said I really just wanted one.  No lie, he grinned, looked at us and said ""let me see what I can do.""  A few minutes later, he came back with a little plate which had exactly 6 french fries on it, and a little cup of their tamarind ketchup.  So.   Freaking.  Good.  I will definitely be back to eat.

If it wasn't clear, I quite like this place a lot and I feel I will be spending many a night there in the coming months!!",0.9975,0.683,0.27,0.047,0.49877149877149873
2009-01-21,5.0,"Love the old place. LIVED at the old place. New location has a lot of the same charm. All the same staff and some good additions. Patrons are similar. The beer list is incredible. And even though some of my favorite Tiny Tini's are missing - those drinks are good too. Food coming soon, which is a nice addition. Aesthetics are similar - even the same old booths - but will a few more areas to congregate. The walls are sparce. Hoping that's temporary as it' kinda looks like a sushi place now. And the bathroom doors don't have those smoke door any more, so that's nice. New location is good. Near the scene, but not exactly in it. No sign, which makes it harder to find, but that's a plus in my book. Yay TINY!",0.9772,0.763,0.207,0.029,0.4364478114478114
2009-01-21,5.0,"The old Tiny Lounge was simply the best bar in Chicago.  Perfect atmosphere.  Perfect staff.  Perfect drinks.  Perfect regulars.  I could not have loved a bar more.  But... I love the new Tiny Lounge just as much.  All of the things I loved in the old place are back in a slightly different, but no less perfect, form.   I missed you.  I love you.   Now, please go get some cider because we will be back tomorrow and I am going to want a Tiny Cider this time!",0.9694,0.62,0.293,0.087,0.5294936947110859

2009-01-12,5.0,"After last night's visit to Tiny Lounge (finally!) I feel the need to update the review below and add on a few more stars. I may have been a little impatient to get into this place, but now I know it was rightly so. A friend and I showed up around 10pm on a Wednesday evening.  The place had about 10 other people sitting around at the bar and tables.  We opted to sit as close to the booze as possible.  I have to say that the minimalist decor on the inside serves the space very well and the large ceiling-to-floor windows provide a great view outside (or in).  Candlelight serves well to illuminate the place. As for the important things, the staff was extremely inviting and glad to converse with us.  The drinks were even better.  As a tequila fan, I strongly recommend the margarita and another concoction by Johnie, one of the bartenders, which involves tequila and orange slices (I think it's called the Woozoo). I'm very excited that this place is finally up and going.  It will definitely become a popular Lincoln Square hangout.  Though hopefully not too popular. A food menu is on its way as well. Oh, and don't forget to check out the great artwork inside ( alansalabert.com )",0.997,0.717,0.277,0.006,0.6505714285714285
2009-01-09,5.0,"I was excited to go to Tiny Lounge upon it's reopening, and finally went last night.  At first I was worried that it'd be packed because it ended up being featured in Timeout this week (as it should be, but let's try to keep this place a secret just between us anyway), but when we got there, massive crowds there were not. The (new) Tiny Lounge is exactly what I've been waiting for.  A cool, quiet, candle lit lounge with a very chic decorative style.   A mixture of blacks and textured wooden walls, with tables, and stools all sitting at different heights in the front part of Tiny Lounge with the comfy booths and couch placed towards the rear.   And the bar itself, wow!  Bottles are arranged and lit perfectly--appearing as if they are a part of an art exhibit.   Drink prices were about what you would expect at a nice, yet not super upscale lounge, so definitely not unreasonable.  There is table service, and our server was exceptionally prompt, friendly, and always ready to explain specific drinks on the menu.   Speaking of the menu, try the Tiny Cider, you can thank me later. I really can't recommend Tiny Lounge enough.  If you're looking for a nice classy atmosphere, with solid service, good drinks, and prices that aren't exorbitant, where you can lose your night talking to friends, a date, or a friendly stranger, look no further than Tiny Lounge.",0.9917,0.747,0.198,0.055,0.5285984848484849
2008-12-24,5.0,"Tiny Lounge has returned in North Center. Last week I stopped in for a sneak peek before a partial opening next week and back in business by the 1st of the year.  The same cast of characters has returned to provide both a delicate and delightful mix of drinks. You will be pleasantly surprised by both the location and the atmosphere.  The location could not be better on the corner of Montrose/Lincoln. North Center has been updating the store fronts for the last couple of years and Tiny Lounge is a great addition.  The atmosphere is spectacular and just short of breath taking. They spared no expense in decor, sound system, and lighting. The lounge provides a fantastic ambiance to mingle with the best of friends. The interior has a comfortable and warm feel with an artfully created wooden puzzled wall and fine finishes all around. They've even managed to save part of the old tiny lounge but I won't give that detail away.  New to Tiny Lounge will be a kitchen and wine cellar. The menu is still under wraps but I'd expect tasty and tapas style offerings.  Tiny Lounge gets the highest rating for the people but you will certainly enjoy the benefits of a new building, the added touch of food and the best mixologists in the city. All located in an easy to access re-surging neighborhood. Hope you enjoy!",0.9911,0.777,0.199,0.024,0.4485516934046347
