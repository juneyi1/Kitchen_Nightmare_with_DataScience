I ""get it"" now - Avec is a cool cool place and not to be missed by any self respecting foodie!  A booking here is really essential if you want to avoid an extensive wait. My friend and I were lucky enough to get something relatively early on a week day and get the coveted chefs' counter seats. Most of the seating is in community banquettes which are usually not really to my taste. I loved being right on the pass though and interacting with the chefs. They were funny and pretty cute I might add.  The food was downright delicious. The menu changes all the time but I've been told that some favorites stick around. I loved the chorizo stuff dates (sounds weird but trust me, it works) and the mushroom risotto (which I don't see on the menu now). The dishes are larger than a traditional multi course tasting menu but smaller than a normal sized entree. Definitely talk to your server about plate size as some were larger than expected for us.  I was expecting Avec to be a lot more expensive than it turned out to be. The price point is extremely reasonable for the quality of food, the West Loop location and frankly, the massive publicity surrounding this restaurant.

The baked egg shakshuka was a runny mess, and that came from my friend who studied abroad in Jerusalem and is usually a big fan of shakshuka. We also got the pork shoulder, squash pizza, and panna cotta for dessert, all of which turned out rather boring.  Also, the space was way too crowded.

2017-07-18,4.0,"Really delicious. I had been meaning to come to Avec for a long time, and I finally made it to Chicago for a long weekend and had the time to give it a try.  I think really the only fault of this restaurant is just how cramped it is. We had a party of 5 and the waitstaff kept bumping into us, and there's a cabinet in the corner that kept getting in the way. Maybe it's time to expand, haha. Despite the cramped conditions, all the food was on point. And I mean all of it. Some of our favorites: - Wood Oven Paella: the prawns were delicious and the rice was perfectly cooked. - Chorizo-stuffed bacon-covered medjool dates: a perfect mix of flavors, and probably the best bite we had the entire meal. - Whole-roasted pork shoulder with littleneck clams: Definitely on the the greasier side, but unbelievably tasty, and if you ask for some extra bread, you can soak up all the rich drippings and stock. Hoo-wee. Overall, the service was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. The prices were about on par with the area, likely a little bit more on the expensive side. However, the dishes were all delicious and well-executed, so at least you know you'll be getting a quality meal. While this might not be the best place for a large group, the food at Avec is outstanding, so it's worth a try for a date or small group.

I asked several times, as the people around me all got their food (some even finished and left while I still picked at my foccacia). Finally one girl came over and snottily told me that my food was being coursed because that's how they do it. Yes, I wanted to sit with this bread for an hour and a half and watch strangers eat how did you know?? Also, this was BS because the guys next to me got their foccacia last. There was no apology, nothing, no offer to bring me something to compensate. They acted like I was a jerk for bothering them with asking if my food was coming.  At the end of my meal they did not ask how the food was, did not apologize, but they did ask if I wanted the foccacia wrapped up to go. NO FOOLS, I DO NOT.  The 2 stars is for the salmon and the cabbage, both were great. The service here is AWFUL, worst ever from anywhere in the world. I left in a bad mood.

I decided to give Avec another chance and returned once again, but this time it was for brunch. I can safely say that the second time was much more enjoyable for me. For Father's Day brunch, my family shared orders of the Avocado Toast, Carrot Cake, Medjool Dates, and Pizza Carbonara. I laugh because the Avocado Toast (with the addition of an egg) was a whopping $12 (what did they say about millennials and avocado toast again?), but it WAS good. The bread was nice and fluffy and all of the vinaigrette really brightened the flavor. The Carrot Cake was extremely delicious! I recently discovered that I am a huge fan of carrot cake in general and I must say that this was one of the best I've had. The cake was packed with tons of spices and the cool cream on the side provided a nice, refreshing touch. The Dates are probably the most popular item on the menu and after eating them for the second time, I will have to say that they have grown on me. I liked the sweet and savory flavors with every bite provided by the dates and chorizo stuffing. My least favorite dish that we ordered would have to be the Pizza Carbonara. The entire dish was way too salty in my opinion. I appreciate how the dishes at Avec are reasonably priced. Avec has now made its way onto my list of restaurants that give you the most for your money. The small, cozy interior makes walk-ins somewhat difficult, especially if you have a larger party. I would definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time. I will most likely be back in the future to explore more of the menu.",0.9972,0.755,0.217,0.028,0.5641025641025641

Also tried the focaccia which was different, thinner and more like a crunchy cheese sandwich snack. Last, we shared an order of the paella.

2017-06-17,5.0,"Love love love it here! The food is undeniably good, it's hard to beat. I'm usually not impressed by many vegetable dishes most restaurants serve, but Avec's charred cabbage dish was my favorite of the night. It was beautifully presented and the cabbage was juicy with a hint of sweetness. It was the most creative vegetable dish I've ever tried, and there were just layers and layers of flavor incorporated into each bite. Some bites I got a burst of tartness from the fresh cherries, others I got a crunch from the spiced walnuts. I loved that each bite tasted different from the last. And I also loved that they incorporated quinoa into the dish for a more substantial feel.  Another must get item is their chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. I have a weakness for chorizo anything so this one was a clear winner. It was sweet, salty and a little spicy from the piquillo pepper-tomato sauce. Start any meal with this and you're guaranteed a good time! The restaurant is long and narrow with communal seating, so be prepared to get cozy with your neighbors.

I liked the fact that my family and I shared plates. We picked two small and two large, in particular, the whipped brandade (amazing) and the asparagus for the small, and the paella and fish for the large. The whipped brandade is like a soupy cod dip that they serve with garlic bread, and the asparagus was a fresh salad with some sprouts and some cheese. They were a good pair to start with. Then we had the paella, and man was that delicious. As was the fish, very fresh, I quite liked the lavender vinaigrette that accompanied it.

There is a patio setup outside where you can wait and order some appetizers and drinks. The food service overall was quick and our waitress was quite attentive. Verdict: Avec was 3.5 star rated restaurant in my experience. May go back to try some of the other dishes that looked interesting(Calzone, Bucatini, Paella) but the list of other restaurants to try on my list may take precedence.",0.1313,0.947,0.028,0.025,0.4218421052631579
2017-06-03,5.0,Everything I ordered from the braised pork shoulder to a few Tom Collins was exceptional. Even the simplest dish - cacio e pepe - was unexpectedly delicious. Staff was friendly and happy to give suggestions and explain the menu. The staff is also great at getting you seated quickly even when you show up at a busy time. I have no criticisms but just one clarification for potential visitors - the space is tight and the atmosphere is very convivial. I found that none of this distracted from the food though and if you go with a group it may even enhance the experience.,0.7109,0.817,0.12,0.063,0.6123376623376623

Because it was a Friday evening and we had no reservation, we waited outside in their little standing patio area and enjoyed a few tapas off the ""bar snacks"" menu and drinks. The anchovies were pretty good but the lavender almonds were divine. Definitely tried to stop myself from eating them all and failed lol.  When we were finally seated (we were told it was a 45 min wait but we only waited 25-30 min so that was nice) we ordered the chorizo stuffed mejdool dates (an Anthony Bourdain recommendation!), the slow roasted pork shoulder with clams and one of the cheeses. You could really taste the thought and care that went into each dish. My one complaint was that while the cheese and dates came out pretty quickly, it took foreeeever for us to get the pork shoulder.

2017-05-27,4.0,"Given the hype and popularity of this restaurant, the food is good enough but not mind-blowing. If only Yelp could do 3.5 stars!  We arrived at 5:30pm on a Saturday for the three of us, and even though we were told the wait would be 45 mins, we only waited for around 25 minutes or so. All the seats inside are communal, so space is a little tight and you will be sharing a table with other guests.  We ordered: - Beet salad: roasted beets with yogurt and fried lentils. A refreshing starter, this was recommended by our waitress, but I could probably do without this dish.  - Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates: probably the highlight of the meal. It's like a really tender meatball that melts in your mouth, along with the sweetness from the dates.  - Paella (half-portioned) - the rice is very flavorsome and moist, but I didn't quite like the snail boudin (sausage). Pretty average dish.  - Pork shoulders: the meat is very tender, but halfway through there isn't enough sauce to moisten it up and it gets a little dry. I do love the broth that is cooked with fregola pasta, clams and peas. A pretty substantial portion for meat-lovers out there.   - Chocolate rhubarb semifreddo: a rich, thick mousse covered in a chocolate shell. Not a bad dessert.  Overall a good experience, not sure if I would come back. But I know their focaccia bread (stuffed with cheese and truffle oil) is very popular, and if it weren't for the amount of food that we've already ordered, I would totally get that too!",0.9933,0.789,0.186,0.025,0.584861845972957

That would have been good had the burrata not been over salted. Final plate was the charred cabbage which was so so so tasty...except again the dressing was just too salty - basically lifted the cabbage out of its dish and ate it plain. There was a lot going on with the charred cabbage dish too, roasted cherries, quinoa, some kind of reduction, and more that I'm totally not remembering at this point, and it wasn't the bestest combination tbh. On the other hand, amazing bar staff. They didn't have the white wine I wanted and dude quickly offered me two samples to choose a replacement.

They squeeze quite a few seats at the community tables, so it can get a little tight, but we made some friends and it was fun. My date and I had the spicy chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon to start. They were amazing, the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. I've had the exact same dish once before at Bacchanal in New Orleans. I love them all, and am glad I know where to find them in both cities! For the main course we shared the wild hake with saffron cous cous, almonds and mint. It was pretty good. I like the almonds, but thought the entire dish was salty, which may have been necessary to give the fish some flavor. To finish we had the affogato dessert. It was exceptional! It was the perfect consistency, a little thicker than a mousse, but still very light.  The perfect ending to a nice meal. The servers were very nice and patient. We never felt rushed. When my friend called to make a reservation, they said they would do something to celebrate my birthday, but I guess they forgot. Not a big deal to me, but my friend was annoyed.

We started off with the whipped brandade with some awesome garlic bread. The brandade is basically a dip made from chunks of cod and olive oil. It was really delicious and pairs VERY well with the crispy garlic bread! We also got the slow roast pork shoulder. This was probably the BEST pork shoulder I've ever had! It is suuuper tender and every thread of the pork was soaked in so much flavor. We finished off with the pesto lamb calzone. This  thing was HUGE and totally worth the price!

2017-04-21,4.0,"I came here for a late lunch and their dinner menu was out. It was around 4 so there wasn't that many people there but once we sat down a few minutes later it got super crowded. You have an option to sit at the bar or the communal tables and i chose the communal tables because it was the furthest away from the door and they had their windows open. It's a small space so it gets pretty cramped. You're also very close to the people sitting next to you so you're going to be cramped but you might also make new friends. A lot of the people I saw coming in were tourist so it's also a cool place if you want to be nosy and listen to other peoples conversations.  I ordered the beet salad, butchers steak, and paella to share. They had a lot of other dishes I wanted to order but I was just too full. We were given the beet salad first with apples, yogurt, dill, and lentils. It was really refreshing and a good appetizer to start off with. I noticed a lot of the dishes were really herb forwards and had a strong dill taste. The next item we received was the butcher steak with fave beans, celery walnut tapenade, and fresh horseradish. They were all small portions but they were very good. The paella dish however was very large. I don't know how I could have finished it if I wasn't sharing. The paella came with confit chicken, snail boudin, shrimp, and tangerine aioli. I loved the paella it was very delicious and had a great sear to it. Their wine list has no American wine but they have a lot of interesting choices. I really loved going to Avec. The servers are very attentive of clearing the space since you don't have that much being a communal table. Although, the servers didn't keep pouring our wine it was alright since I assume the place was crowded they had a lot to deal with. Out water was never empty though so that's a good sign. The awkward part about being in a communal table is having everyone get up because you have to go to the restroom. It's better if you're in a bigger group asking friends to get up for you but asking as stranger makes it awkward especially since they have to get up again for you to get back to your seat. If you're going with a date I suggest you request the end of the table or sit at the bar.",0.9977,0.802,0.178,0.02,0.5340444310211752

I came in on a Friday evening around 6 pm (winter season) and was seated immediately, much to my pleasant surprise!  The wine, cheeses, and bruschetta were great, but my main entree, side salad, and dessert just didn't do it. I had the fleur de marquis for my starter, which is a sheep's cheese from France. I had the sea urchin bruschetta with cured ham and pickled mustard seeds as a small plate, and the cheese was very moist and fresh, pairing well with the other ingredients. We ordered the classic pork shoulder with tuscan kale ribollita, apple, and ricotta salad vinaigrette. I'm not a huge pork fan and really shouldn't have ordered the pork shoulder, however, it was a classic so we felt as if it was a must-try. It was bland. We had initially put in an order for the focaccia large plate, but later changed that to a brussel sprout salad. Our waitress ran into the kitchen to immediately change our order and handled the request graciously, whereas we felt like such a request would warrant an eyeroll by any other waitress. The brussel sprout salad was made with shaved brussel sprouts, and that too, was bland. When a waiter came by and asked if I wanted dessert, I had requested to know what the gelato offering was. He said ""banana coffee""... I thought.. ""hm, I don't like banana but I love coffee, so why not"". Unfortunately I had misheard what he had said and the gelato turned out to be banana ""poppy"", two flavors I am not fans of.

The place: Even though we felt a little bit like we were on Noah's Ark, and I might have gotten bumped by the door a few times while waiting for the rest of my party to arrive, there was something incredibly cozy, familiar, almost familial about this place. I don't normally love the communal seating, and it was a little inconvenient when we had to use the restroom, but we made it work, and it was totally manageable. The taste: Everything that I ate, I'd eat again today, tomorrow, you name it. I didn't have the bruschetta with cured ham or the bacon wrapped dates, which I've heard amazing things about, but my crew seemed to enjoy them. I did eat the brussels sprouts (YUM), the focaccia with tallegio (YUM YUM), the lemon bucatini (solid. tasty), the charred cabbage (mmmmm). We shared the citrus pavlova for dessert. And 2 bottles of the Indalia pinot noir - that was a fantastic bottle of wine, IMO. My face: A little flushed from the wine, though I stopped after not too much since I had to drive us home. A little radiant because someone who wasn't me picked up the whole tab for the 4 of us. Dinner for 4 with one bottle of wine, pre-tip was $170; the bottle of wine I bought at the bar before was another $50 I think.

We also tried the calzone, which again holy crap on the salt!!! The middle section was inedible because of all the salt. The edges were great and had delicious flavor. Lastly, we got the chocolate cremeaux and it was alright. Whipped mousse with whipped cream. Nothing mind-blowing. Wish they had another warm chocolate dessert option. Overall, we were very underwhelmed by the food based on all the hype. Most of it was SO salty that it was inedible. On top of it all, it has a serious price tag that is completely not worth it.

I thought the guanciale was on the salty side, but I was still a huge fan of the dish. We ended brunch with the bone marrow quiche, which was nothing short of excellent. It's amazing how the quiche can be so fluffy. The bone marrow gave it a great, rich taste. I'm looking forward to coming here again for brunch and also trying their dinner menu.

They also have this red pepper sauce that is yummy on bread, on the dates, on practically everything I would imagine. I also got the caldo verde off the lunch menu - this I would skip next time.

Decor: Super simple, it looks like a big wooden sauna. Communal tables or bar seating. Super small, warm, inviting, loud, great music. Service: The servers are all very knowledgable about the menu that is always adapating and changing. They are also very opinionated. They really don't BS you with that ever dreaded line ""you know it is all very good""  They tell you their actual opinions and stand behind each item. Drinks: Extensive wine list. Very tiny cocktail menu that is always changing and very unique and solid. They also offer a full service classic cocktails but they just don't have it on the menu.  Food: The menu is so well edited, it is ever changing with a few staple items that never change for good reason (there would be a riot if they took off the chorizo stuffed dates). The menu is extremely simple and it represents their take on the food as a whole. Every dish is very well balanced.  I have honestly maybe had 2 dishes in 5 years that I wasn't a huge fan of. This is the best restaurant in Chicago. To the owner: I just wish they can go back to being a walk in only place. The reservation thing kinda ruins the overall vibe of the place.

The chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates were good but I've had better plain bacon wrapped dates because you can better appreciate the sweet and salty dichotomy. These have too many flavors going on - spicy, salty, sweet, and tangy. I wasn't super impressed.  The field greens salad was good but maybe don't waste your experience on a salad you can easily recreate with some quality ingredients.  Oysters were teeny tiny! The lemony flavor was nice but not worth $18.  Lastly, we got half order of paella. The rice was meh, with a weird aftertaste. The shrimp was somewhat fishy. Chicken was fine. The sausage was definitely the best part.

They are the highlight of the menu in my opinion. The tomato sauce has a bit of a kick to it which helps mediate the sweetness of the dates. The bacon is well cooked and not super fatty while there's plenty of chorizo on the inside. These are a must have. I've had a number of the sandwiches (pulled pork, avec burger, some fish sandwhich which is no longer on the menu). All have been great and are excellently done so it's just a matter of what mood you're in.  Only thing I don't like about Avec - the communal tables which are a bit short.

Service:  Both the waiter and bartender were very courteous, but the owner-like man seemed to skip talking to us about the food intentionally but not other groups who also ate at the bar maybe because we're both Asians and was talking using another language.  Even though the bartender was friendly, I sneaked him taking away my wine glass with maybe 1/5 unfinished when I was talking to my friend. I didn't ask the reason, though I felt weird.

I've been here a few times and the experiences were equally awesome. The chorizo stuffed dates are absolutely amazing. They come in a tomato like sauce which results in a sweet and spicy taste that is given an extra lift by the tomato sauce. I've also has a few other dishes such as the French toast which is excellent, and the four lettuce salad which was one of the mist unique and delicious salads I've ever tasted.  They also have a lot of creative and delicious cocktails. I've had a few rum cocktails as part of their brunch menu which were awesome. There is specific drink made with dark and light rum, bitters and lime that is delicious.

We ordered: chorizo stuffed dates (HAVE to have these, they are known for this dish, so rich and salty, very satisfying, you can have a half order! It was perfect because my friend does not eat pork. The waiter talked us into the pastry of the day-it was an apple and carrot bread with walnut butter. I have NEVER had fruit/veggie bread this good. It was so moist and flavorful! I was amazed how good this bread was! My friend had the butcher steak and she said it was great! I had the lamb burger and it was cooked perfectly! The roasted tomatoes were smoky, and I loved the creaminess of the goat cheese. I like the fact that they have a smaller menu to share and larger plates.

Perfect combination of sweet and savory, this is a must!!  - baked eggs with prosciutto: I was a little confused at first but this was filling and delicious. Bottom layer of baked beans, topped with poached eggs and lots of savory prosciutto! YUMMM - French toast: perhaps my least favorite of the three. The bread itself was really dense, I prefer my French toast fluffier and chewy. The flavors were also really rich but I liked the pear  jam/reduction on top.  We were going to order more (among 3 girls) but our waitress said that it might be too much food. Glad we took her advice because we had food leftover and were stuffed!!

2016-11-06,5.0,"I do so adore that cozy hole-in-a-wall restaurant, Avec Moi! Dining there was the one ray of sunshine in a trying week. Spoiled creme fraiche, a tardy manicurist, the death of my prize-winning hydrangea. How much hardship can one person take? How much?!? It all started on All Hallows' Eve -- wouldn't you know it -- with Maurice's bright idea (why do I listen to that man?) to conduct a seance to determine the true cause of death of our dear Uncle Roald once and for all. Well, I'm not one for Maurice! MAURICE!! There's pulp in my mimosa! PULP! How did this happen? You know I can't -- and I won't -- abide flecks of fruit flesh. Well it's too late for apologies now, my breakfast is ruined. Ruined like Pompeii! Just bring the bottle of Bollinger, sans jus d'orange, for Christ's sakes. Put it here. No here. Here, lodge it between the cushions. You know I can't reach when I'm wearing Oscar. histrionics or drama but summoning the dead is more than this woman-of-a-certain-age's nerves can take. I was beside myself! Literally! Bippy popped-by post-alcohol-fueled-all-day-breakfast at the 3rd Coast Chicago. Mya (my certified CranioSacral therapist) and her ever-present female friend Wolf (Parkinson-White) lingered after simultaneously bilaterally adjusting my sphenoids (the release actually unclogged my first chakra and it was heavenly!) to participate. The motley five of us dragged Chef away from his bubbling béarnaise sauce, and of course my dear, bloated friend Eugenia arrived in a minute, as God knows she had nothing better to do with her day. That was seven. And everyone -- EVERYONE -- knows that it takes eight -- Eight is Enough -- to conduct a proper seance. So what did Maurice do? Do you guess? Do you guess? Do you? He invited Blanche (Blanche!). She had the audacity to arrive escorted by those insufferable, entitled Brant Boys. I had no part of them, sending them off to the Viagra Triangle to wreak their havoc on the new moneyed set and the Eurotrash and the general riffraff who gather there. AND.... And nothing! We tried, but we could not summon dear Uncle Roald from his grave. His demise remains a mystery.... Well, let me tell YOU: nothing stimulates the appetite as much as an attempt to rouse the dead! Maurice suggested that the eight of us -- minus Chef and Mya and Wolf -- mere hired help -- five of us actually, try Avec Moi for dinner. Avec Moi! A charming, narrow wooden space (I couldn't help but be reminded of our sauna at the hunting lodge in upper Haapajarvi) that just oozes with hygge. Friendly servers and bartenders, if they are a bit rough around the edges. And those wines by the glass. Delightful! We each had four! I found the brandade and pork shoulder (they never ever leave the menu) To Die For, but let me tell you this....THAT TRUFFLE FOCACCIA BREAD was tastier than any lover Mother, Bippy or I have sampled, or shared, and that's saying a lot! I would have never tried it -- focaccia is a tad blue-collar for someone as sophisticated as myself -- but the couple next to us swore by it. Simply orgasmic if I do say so myself. I do! Imagine! Me! Talking to strangers! Noshing on scrumptious focaccia! In fact the communal seating -- as dreadful as it sounds -- was a hoot! I conversed with a woman from Ohio. Ohio!?! She was a tad overweight, of course, but perfectly capable of conducting a (brief) conversation. Anyway, I am returning to Avec Moi to sample their bacon-wrapped medjool dates (I haven't indulged in that dish since Serge and I visited the Gettys in Marrakech (before Talitha's glamorous drug-addled descent into paranoia and death)). With Maurice, of course. And if we can entreat my dear, departed Uncle Roald to join us (he was a man of refined taste, afterall), we shall. And we will!",0.9917,0.784,0.135,0.081,0.42013572013572015

With lunch menus in hand, my colleague and I went with a bunch of small plates along with a large one to share.  The egg-topped avocado toast was fantastic and the easy star - the hot, toasty bread was the perfect canvas for the mix of creaminess, acidity, fresh greens and EVOO.   For the lamb burger, the patty itself was rich and gamey with the cool yogurt, cucumber and mint cutting the fattiness nicely.  However, the bun was entirely forgettable and honestly looked like it could've come from McDonald's.  Suffice it to say, the entire presentation was surprisingly plain and underwhelming. Thereafter, the butcher steak with a fried egg was pretty good, just that nothing about the flavors stood out.  For the large plate, our slow roasted pork shoulder was very warming and super generously portioned, yet the flavors lacked complexity and bored the palate after a few bites.  On top of that, the shoulder meat wasn't the most tender and the dish really needed the fat from the sausage and feta to balance that out. Finally, the char and sumac glaze on the slabs of pork belly was brimming with sweet and savory notes.  Like the shoulder though, the meat itself was fairly dry and once again needed the glaze and fat for balance. On the upside, the wines by the glass were very well curated as we both thoroughly enjoyed our picks from France and Spain.",0.9966,0.759,0.23,0.011,0.6321428571428572

Only complaint is they tend to be a little messy to eat (large chunks of meat that may or may not be semi falling as you bite into it) if you're the super dainty type. For dinner, I honestly feel like there are just way too many good choices: - Chorizo stuffed dates: a classic and many folks swear by it, but personally I think it's a little too saucy for me. The pepper-tomato sauce feels a bit blunt - I like my flavors ""harmonized"" with each other better if that makes sense?  - Butcher's steak: beyond awesome in terms of how much the beef tastes like beef - Pork shoulder: Very soft and beyond substantial. We were both basically full after just finishing up this dish P.S.

The salmon was also cooked nicely, and my friend ordered the dates which she enjoyed. For dessert, we shared the lime and coconut gelato in strawberry soda, and the fruit tart. The fruit dessert was nothing particularly special, but I loved how unique and refreshing the gelato float was. Altogether, a great dining experience that I would highly recommend. My one criticism for the restaurant is that the booths at the communal tables don't work! My friend had to get up about 5 times throughout dinner to let someone in or out of the booth.

We decided to just go veggie for the whole table to keep it simple and we ordered a trio of cheeses (say yes to the honey. do it.), olives, the foccacia, the kale salad, the tabbouleh, the burrata, an amazing bottle of wine, then dessert because you always need dessert, right?

We were told the menu rotates often and though they do have some standards (the dates!!)... it changes often so don't expect to see the same menu even a month later.  It is a small restaurant with the actual kitchen among the diners.  We sat along the bar instead of the communal tables and got a great view of the chefs at work.  We were given a nice introduction to their top dishes and we composed a VERY filling dinner.  Everyone working in the restaurant is in constant motion.. whether it be clearing plates, cooking, taking an order, or serving... it's a constant hustle.  It gives a great vibe to the place. We started off with the sprout salad (love the flavours and texture... crispy sweet apple slices with a hit of mustard, and crunch and nuttiness of peanuts), calamari (my fellow diner was really hesitant on calamari.. he thinks rubber bands. Turns out this was a great dish and now he's open to having it again.  They were tender and the lime citrus note was good), chorizo dates (very good... love the sweetness hits you first then the paprika and pork flavour comes afterwards.  LOVED the sauce... we used all the bread to sop it up), paella (WARNING this is a LARGE portion.  Like more than enough for 2 people... we're talking probably 4.  it came with 5 large head on shrimp and 3 chicken legs... plus a ton of crispy bottom rice.  Great dish but damn we were stuffed), and ended with kumquat flan (LOVE this... my dining partner thought this might be too eggy and it was more like creamy milky heaven... the caramel was so good).  We did over order but wow, great flavours and execution.  I love the constant changing menu and how it does offer a variety of vegetables, seafood, and meats... not just a constant focus on red meats.  For those of us who like to eat more vegetables, Avec will be a constant on my list of places to eat in Chicago.",0.994,0.851,0.137,0.012,0.5255079365079365

Perhaps it was just the welcomed solitude after constantly being around people for a week?(#introvertprobs) But aside from the occasional glances from the server or corporate guys drinking on their lunch break next to me, my attention was solely fixated on the food. That's what you would call an unbiased, unclouded experience! I dropped in during lunch and was happily seated at the bar. I overheard the host tell guests that the wait for even groups of two were at least 20 min for a table. (However, they do take reservations for lunch now!) I considered ordering the famous pork shoulder, but after consecutive meals at the Girl and the Goat and the Purple Pig, I was all pork-ed out haha. I ended up deciding on the kale and carrot salad with mint, dill, green harissa, and sunflower seed dukkah and the popular chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. The server was so kind to half the portion of the dates (from four to two) so it was more reasonable to finish -- and it was perfect! I loved how refreshing the salad was, with a hint of spice from the harissa. I've never had dukkah before, but I didn't mind it at all! I would have preferred smaller slices of the carrots though, much easier to eat! The half portion of chorizo-stuffed dates was just right with a good balance of sweetness from the dates and saltiness from the bacon and chorizo. But the pepper-tomato sauce was such a hit, I was devastated when I ran out of bread to dip into the sauce.

Though you'd think there would be cheese in this dish due to the consistency, there isn't any surprisingly. - Slow roasted pork shoulder: This was also delicious and a nice-sized portion (granted it's $26). It was tasty, but it's not a dish I would absolutely order again necessarily. - ""Deluxe"" focaccia: I didn't eat this since it was made with primarily cheese, which wouldn't agree with my lactose intolerance.

My favorite was the the smoked salmon taramsalata--the flavors of the smoked salmon were light and came together very well with the frisee and tangerines. The brunch pizza was also amazing--the crust was thin, light, and crispy, and the runny egg was perfectly melted into the cheese. For dinner service, the foccacia and honey is always a solid bet. The one entree I've gotten that I wasn't a huge fan of was the pork shoulder, which I found a little overwhelming because of its rich and heavy flavors  (though it would be great to share with 3-4 people).  Overall, avec's prices are very fair for the portion size and the quality of the food.

I'm a fan of the concept as well as the execution ever since it opened up a few years ago, and have seen it become a hip place for small gathering.  I appreciate your opening up the ability to make reservations, and also the lunch option. But I wanted to bring to your attention that lunch at AVEC is close to impossible and far from an enjoyable experience. Still great food and warm service, but the table set up is impossible to get in and out - I brought my colleague there just now, full of excitement for her to finally try the place I've been raving about, and it was embarrassing. It was close to empty when we entered, we were nonetheless to be seated right next to two gentleman all the way in the back of the restaurant. Upon request, we were moved to the brighter side of the restaurant, but had to keep getting up and sitting down when other customers were getting in and out of the table. Also, we were seated so close to the next pair of customers at the communal table that we were really invading in each other's privacy - again, I get the concept of communal table and love it at dinner time, but it just does not work at lunch time, when people are showing up around the same hour, and all expecting to have an enjoyable experience. And on top of all these, the AC was constantly dropping water right on my face from the ceiling.  I will also point out that it is very special to have a sit down lunch for any working professionals these days, and when they so choose to come to your restaurant, they have a right to enjoy this experience. Right now, it's noisy, crowded, customers are cranky and waiters trying to put up a strong and happy face. It is NOT what the AVEC experience should be.  We had to finish our lunch faster than necessary, and I actually came back and cancelled my reservations for tomorrow with a friend at AVEC right away.

We also got the Pork Shoulder and the Mussel with garlic bread and those were very mild tasting. Not a lot of flavor, nothing special. The mussels were actually very small. One thing that really ticked my boyfriend and I off was what the hostess did while we were eating. As most of you read, the tables are set up so that you sit next to other people. Imagine a dining room table where you may be in the middle of two random couples on both sides. What ended up happening in our situation was the couple to the right of us left and the couple to the left right next to us left as well. However there was still another couple all the way at the left end. We were mid bite into our food and the hostess came over and basically told us ""can you please move down a seat?"" She basically did that so there would be four empty seats next to each other on the right. 1. I would have no problem doing that if she would have waited for me to put down my fork and stop chewing 2. If those four seats were actually going to be used within the next couple of minutes. However the fact she rudely interrupted us and no one sat down next to us for the next twenty minutes or so was just bizarre. I was actually pretty mad at the situation and was going to tell her she should wait till a more appropriate time to tell someone to move till our waitress came over and mentioned that she saw what happened and that it was wrong. Her name was Sontra and she made the situation way better. She was very nice to us and apologized for something she didn't even do, so thank you Sontra.

Focaccia is incredible. My boyfriend and I were hesitant to order bacon-wrapped dates (which are pretty over-done at this point); however, I had read reviews and we decided to try them. They were some of the best we've had! This is a great restaurant to go with a group of 3-4 and order family style - almost everything is amazing, so the more things you are able to try, the better.",0.9903,0.721,0.263,0.016,0.5457407407407406
2016-07-17,5.0,"I mean what to say about this place that hasn't already been said. Came here on a Friday night right after work, and a group of 4 was easily able to slide into one of the communal tables and get right to it. Super extensive wine list (didn't even read it to be honest) and very short cocktail list. Ordered an old fashioned which wasn't on the menu but turned out very well. Girlfriend ordered a tea and gin inspired drink, which actually arrived after our first plate of food - the only downside to the meal. Food order included the dates (they are everything that other reviewers have mentioned and more. you need these in your life), mussels with fresh naan and flavorful lemony broth, greens with feta and fennel (needed something green.. right?), focaccia bread which was more like dry flatbread with creamy cheese in the center (wouldn't order again), lamb shank with calabria chili sauce and apricots (wow!), fresh yogurt and berries, and finished with olive oil chocolate cake. Dates were easily my favorite thing, followed by the lamb and mussels.  The place is loud and busy (rightfully so) so expect that going in. You'll sit in close quarters and stare at the surrounding plates wondering - hm should we order that? Yes. Yes you should. Order as much as you can eat as the menu rotates a bit and make sure if you take guests they are comfortable with communal seating. Not as pricey as the neighboring blackbird makes Avec a great spot with high repeat potential.",0.9934,0.821,0.17,0.009,0.5561520337301588

For food, we went with: Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates, Charred beet tartine, Smoked Salmon tartine, and the Avec burger. All the sandwiches and tartines come with a choice of marinated lentil salad or spiced chips as a side. We got both. Everything was great. The bread that came with the dates was nice and crusty and perfect for sopping up the remaining piquillo pepper sauce. Each tartine had it's own unique flavor as did the burger and everything was made with quality ingredients, precision, and care.

I ordered a Turkish Float (lemon gelato + strawberry malt soda) and chocolate sesame truffles, and both changed my life!!!

The staples -- chorizo dates and focaccia -- are remarkably consistent in quality, and are always a pleasure.  The other parts of the menu, which change seasonally, are nearly always worth trying. I fondly recall sumac salmon, squid ink spaghetti, poached eggs, and many other great seasonal dishes. That being said, I've also had ones that weren't so good (duck egg pizza this season, for instance), so there's some variance among the seasonal items. The gelato and sorbet selection, which changes daily, is also always worth going for. Not only is it usually very well done, but it's almost always an interesting and compelling flavor. That being said, the music and atmosphere are great too. Avec manages to be intimate and feel vibrant while maintaining a high level of polish.  Service is usually great.

2016-06-14,5.0,"There are so few times I've eaten at an establishment that just transcends the 1 - 5 Star Review system. As rare as this happens, it sometimes does - like tonight at Avec. Let me throw some adjectives out there; memorable, fantastic, complex, thoughtful, delicious, smart and a list of twenty more. Avec was a dining experience I've had only as many fingers (no toes) as I have or maybe less than that. So let's go through the dinner I just had: Tabbouleh Salad with so many things going on your palette was jumping like a frog. Chicken Liver on Crostini that was as smooth as silk and kicking with a lot of side flavors given by ingredients that I had no idea what they were.  Let's just say IT WORKED! Chorizo with Dates that was as thoughtful as a dish I've ever had.  This dish affected my mind more than my palette - Very Cool. A Pork Shoulder Casserole that made my Chef Wife's head buzz. She was blown away and I haven't seen that awed look on her face in years. Fideos with Squid and Ink - Wow - Unbelievable! Portokaloptia pudding with ice cream that was crazy good.   Sure you have to wait an hour for your table at 9:00 on a Wednesday night, but let me say emphatically that it is totally worth it. The wine list is well constructed to fit the food.  The service was very good. The price is surprisingly not much compared to similar dinners as memorable. I apologize if this glowing review sounds like my son owns this restaurant (which he doesn't) but I will not forget this evening anytime soon, and I say those words so seldom.",0.9868,0.83,0.154,0.016,0.640462506841817
2016-06-12,1.0,"I always disliked communal seating, but now I really despise it.  This was my second time returning to Avec, and the food still didn't impress; no need to call out anything specific - everything was just mediocre. Why the 1 star?  There were a series of incidents with the hostess who didn't know how to seat separate parties at this narrow restaurant that has communal tables. My husband and I were celebrating something and decided to come here for a date night.  We got seated at the last table at the back of the restaurant. I sat with my back against the wall.  Later on, a party of 3 got seated at the end of the table adjacent to us, and 1 of the guys was told to sit in the aisle in between our two tables, so I was blocked if I tried to get out.  Then a large party arrived and occupied the opposite end of our table, leaving just two vacant seats in the middle of our table next to my husband and me.  Near the end of our meal, a couple arrived, and the clueless hostess asked me to move to let them in, but like I said - I was blocked by the guy.  What first bothered me was that she didn't notice the guy blocking me, so I had to ask him to move when I feel it should've been her.  I looked over at her, and she clearly had this ""oops"" face.  Additionally, I was very pregnant, and squeezing past diners wasn't very easy.  My husband and I decided to just ask for the check and forego dessert at that time so we found our waitress who rung up our bill.  I waited alongside the counter next to her.  Moments later, the hostess returned and asked me if I needed any assistance in an impatient tone like she was trying to move me out of the way.  I'm like, ""I'm trying to pay, and there's no where to go!""  And she's like, oh!  My husband was already by the front door waiting for me, and he told me she approached him and told him he couldn't stand there to wait!  What the heck?  Where do ya want us to go then, lady?!  We're trying to leave this stupid place!  She single-handedly ruined my night, and now Avec is officially on my shit list.",-0.9054,0.798,0.088,0.114,0.34147619047619054

2016-05-01,4.0,"Several years ago when I went to Avec, it had a high-end, trendy, American feel to it. I never detected anything French or Basque about it. And there was a hint of Mediterranean. As of my most recent visit, it's still very high-end, trendy, American. The service is top. The food now is okay. Since my visit in 2008, the small plates have seemingly become entrée size. My advice would be to order linearly, not all at once if you think you may not get to enjoy a large plate because the small plates are larger than expected. I had a shaved brussel sprouts salad that had grapes, slices apples, crunchy peas, and some flavourful cheese in a tasty vinaigrette. This came in a large bowl. The other dish I had was a huge bowl of mussels. This also was supposedly a small plate. The mussels were a bit mushy, opposed to the al dente lima beans. Having had mussels at other restaurants in a sauce accented with saffron, the sauce on the mussels at Avec made for an okay dish. And instead of toast for better sopping of the sauce, there was something akin to doughy naan. The server paired both with wine, a white for the salad and a red blend for the mussels, and both pairings were spot on. Avec is a happening spot, so reservations are recommended. For the food, I give 3 stars. The service bumps my rating up because the servers are very good with offering suggestions.

2016-04-30,5.0,"Over the years, Avec has become so inextricable from my memories and experiences in Chicago that a trip to the Windy City feels incomplete without a bite of those incomparable dates and a cold Atomium. Like most restaurants of its ilk, Avec doesn't take reservations and can handle around 30 people at capacity, so the wait for dinner is typically 1-2 hours during the dinner rush. This may be a blessing in disguise if it's a nice day, since it gives you the chance to enjoy an aforementioned Atomium (a crisp, flavorful Belgian ale) in the small standing area outdoors. Inside, you'll find that the long, narrow venue is constructed floor-to-ceiling from shimmery reclaimed wood. The seating is communal, so be warned: you might find yourself shoulder-to-shoulder with a couple on an awkward date. The Mediterranean-inspired menu is subject to change, but thankfully there are some standouts that seem to be permanently in rotation. The shared dishes vary in size, but are all both filling and surprisingly affordable. There are no wrong answers here, but I personally was not a fan of the whole roasted fish, and others have reported that the paella is subpar. My favorites: Medjool Dates - Avec's most popular dish and with good reason: it's a masterpiece. The savoriness of the bacon and chorizo are cut nicely by the sweet, fruity tones of the dates. The smooth sauce is tangy and satisfying -- soak it up with the firm Ciabatta.  Pork Shoulder - One of the largest courses on the menu, the slow-roasted meat is tender and succulent. The broth is mild and the white beans give it a nice earthy consistency. Brandade - If you don't like seafood, you may want to avoid this one. But for the rest of us, this dish is a knock-out. It comes with a creamy, rich puree of white fish that you can spread on sliced toast. The fish is mouth-watering and warms you right to your core. Foccaccia - A large, thin serving of hot, perforated flatbread with taleggio and ricotta cheeses baked in. Not one of the more filling options, but definitely one of the tastiest. Ask for a side of honey to really make the flavors pop. The servers are always highly professional and don't try to insert themselves needlessly into your dining experience; I appreciate that. The venue is gorgeous and you can share some sensational food for $30-$45 each. Make plans to go this weekend and don't look back.",0.9951,0.789,0.163,0.048,0.5681616832779625

2016-04-13,1.0,"How the mighty have fallen.  Its been a year or so since I've had some of those famous chorizo stuffed dates, or braised lamb neck, or some version of the always satisfying paella.  Sunday night, we decided to go get some of those delicious good feelings again and hopefully discover some new ones.  Unfortunately that did not happen. It started with the cold statue of a hostess. I dont mean she was made entirely of cement and motionless, but she was cold and didnt smile. At all. We sat at the communal table and roughly 10 minutes go by before we get approached by our server or anyone for that matter. We order a glass of wine and a beer. Both were fine. Then comes the food... Chorizo stuffed dates: A classic, and honestly as good as i remember. Smokey, spicy, fatty. The generous chunk of hot crusty sourdough is probably the best bread in the city. Holes bigger than golf balls. I dont remember the price of these, say 3 years ago? But 4 stuffed dates now? $15. They're still made with pork right?  Calamari salad: A confusing dish. Charred calamari with what looked like watermelon radish (a finicky winter vegetable) pea shoots (spring) and a couple smears of avocado mash, i didnt want to call it guacamole because it had virtually no flavor. The calamari itself was salty beyond belief. Like, it had to have been an accident, perhaps a deli of salt tipped over without anyone noticing. THAT salty. But beyond that, there was just no balance. It needed acidity (lime juice) really badly and it was slightly overcooked and rubbery to boot. Just not good. At this point, we wanted to flag down our server and address our culinary concerns, but she didnt even look our way, it was bustling, loud and crowded. We shrugged our shoulders and accepted the reality. A bus boy eventaully brought our paella.  The paella: In the past, ive probably had 4 different versions of this dish. Classic in its own right but always amplified somehow with a housemade sausage or few bright creamy dollops of orange/tangerine mayo. But this time? No sausage (sad face) 3 (small) head on shrimp and the mushiest rice imaginable. I wish i was being dramatic. You couldnt differentiate one grain of rice from the next. It was just one big blob of overcooked starch. The chicken thighs were fine. But the paella overall was far from enjoyable. So sad at $28.  We finished the meal with their affogato. By far, the best part of the meal. Delicious in its simplicity. After tip, which I reluctantly gave 20% HAD to pay $120. Very disappointing.

2016-04-06,3.0,"As I review some of the other reviews I can't help but have some doubt about my own perception of this restaurant. It's likely me, not them. But, nonetheless, I will continue with my 3 (gasp!) star review. First impression: Casual atmosphere with foo-foo menu items with which I have absolutely no familiarity.  Menu: the menu made the dishes out to be complex.  I didn't quite know what was in each dish as my mastery of culinary lingo is incredibly subpar.  Not totally a big deal as, from my experience, high quality restaurants like this usually deliver on taste.  Food: Overall everything was tasty and good.  Nothing was ever at the level of 'omg this is to die for' and conversely nothing came close to being spat out.  Everything was just...good! Chorizo stuffed dates (of course we got them- every single Yelp tip and review mandated the ordering and consumption of these ahhhhmaaaazzzing dates):  My thoughts:  they were.......good.  Nothing more, def nothing less.  I'm not going to rave about them as, for me, they don't deserve all the attention. Brussels Sprouts Salad: Good. (That is all) Mussels: Buuuuttttter!  (Which allows this item to hover between good and pretty good.) Lima beans were a good addition. Atmosphere:  Pretty cool vibe.  Casual environment.  We were seated at an upscale picnic-style table (if there is such a thing) which  was backed up against the wood wall.  Loved it until 3 different groups rolled through at various times throughout our meal and conversation, requiring us to stand up and allow them through.  At one point, whilst mid-chew, we stood up allowing a group to sit down beside us. However, the area in which we were standing became quite congested with the waiter who was attempting to deliver drinks, the new patrons, another table of ~5 getting up to leave, and us.  All ten of us were jockeying for position in 2'x2' space.  Whilst being excused this way and excused that way I was able to finish chewing the chorizo stuffed date with bacon.  Folks, the bacon made this situation tolerable. Therefore, I think the bacon (and I suppose the chorizo stuffed date to which it was attached) is due an upgrade on its ranking to 'great'! Ha. Anywho.  Everything was good. Glad I ate here once.  Unfortunately, I do not have a desire to go back at this time.  Pro-tip:  weekday 6:30 seating was easy peasy.  7:30-9 it was hopping- people were waiting.",0.9918,0.816,0.137,0.046,0.557234668109668

I was prepared for a long wait, so I wasn't surprised once we got in around 7 and was told there would be about a 45 minute- 1 hour wait. We used this time to go in for a drink a couple doors down and a western restaurant for the wait.  Atmosphere:  I really did love the atmosphere it even though it is indeed a slim fit restaurant that has apparently be open for 12 years, so they must be doing something right. The lighting was great, the embroidered napkins were a nice touch, and the plating dishes were perfect. Yes of course it was loud but for the conditions, I think anyone could handle it.   Food: Hands down amazing, I can't complain about a single course. The char-grilled sweet potatoes was sweet with a tahini and grill taste, the Brussel sprouts salad was fresh, and the olives and bread was a nice starter but could've done without. Entree wise, my mom got the fresh fish which was good but was frightful of bones, and lastly my tangine was hearty for a vegetarian dish a  tang of the yogurt. I agree with others who said that two small plates or one large plate is standard as a filling meal. The proportions are perfect for any time of the day. Outstanding!  Dessert: Two out of the three of us went for the special desserts of the day where my dad got the lemon ginger sorbet and my sister got the mint chip gelato. Each had special touches, the sorbet with a torched meringue, and the gelato with two small shortbread cookies atop it. finally, I had the greek yogurt cake which was moist and creamy with a crunch and the currants inside made for nice collected components.  Conclusion: . Wouldn't regret this visit at all, Even Due to Lenten obligations, we had to pass on the chorizo stuffed dates, but next time it's a must. However, I learned my lesson that other reviews can't scare me anymore because they made me think I wouldn't like it.

2016-02-13,4.0,"I came back to Avec for lunch in February and I have to bump up my rating from 3 (in December) to a 4. The things that mattered to me in December were no longer much relevant. I ended up ordering the seared trout for lunch - it laid on top of bread with a salad medley in between. It hit the spot and really gave me the push to update my review - yum! Here's my review for December: The place is a bit hard to find since the door is camouflaged with the wall. Once you find the door - push, don't pull. I was expecting the place to have a more formal or semi-formal ambiance based off of the info I read online (queue the dim lighting, semi dressy attire, and music with volume that is loud enough to cover eaves dropping but soft enough so that you won't lose your voice from screaming) - my expectations were let down. The lighting was faintly dim, workers wore jerseys, and I don't think music was playing at all. The restaurant menu is setup suggesting that people share plates family style. They recommended that 1 large dish or 2 small dishes be ordered for 1 person. Kale Salad (small) -  Delish! The salad was light yet full with flavor. If you're looking for greens, I would highly recommend this option! --- 5/5 Chorizo Stuffed Date (small) - The spice of the chorizo, saltiness of the bacon, and sweetness of the dates really made this an interesting dish! I enjoyed trying it after noticing the hype from Yelp; but a try was good enough for me. The dish comes with 4 stuffed dates; we had 1 each and had the rest for take away. --- 3/5 Pork Shoulder (large) -  The first thing I thought of when I took a bite is that this reminded me of a taco - in a good way! The pork was very flavorful and reminded me of flavored meat in tacos. I, as many, would recommend this dish. --- 4/5 Steak (small) -  Good. Nothing less or more than my expectations. This was the last dish we settled on for our dinner order. --- 3/5 Apple Crostata with Ice Cream -  I love it when warm breaded dishes meet cold ice cream! The apple pie wasn't as warm as I would have liked it so that was a bit of a let down. They don't mention it on the menu, but this dish has raisins! My bf is allergic to raisins so he wasn't able to try it which was unfortunate. --- 4/5 (with the caveat that it's not cool to leave out ingredients that people can be allergic to) Turkish Coffee Gelato (Special"") - My bf ordered this since he recently came back from Turkey and has declared turkish coffee one of his favorite types of coffee. Unfortunately, he was let down from this ice cream rendition. --- 3/5 There were three things that really caught my attention: 1. The bathroom sink/dryer combo - I've never seen something like that before! Pretty nifty! 2. The ""kitchen""! Are the back 2 ovens behind the bar the main part of the ""kitchen""? I noticed it on the way out so I didn't have a chance to ask, but it's such an interesting setup! It may be why the dessert took much longer than expected. I would say dessert took over 15 minutes to be served. 3. About 5 minutes after we placed our dinner order we noticed a ""specials"" board and wanted to change one of our dishes for a special. We were told that they couldn't change it since they dish was already made - unfortunate since we really wanted to try to scallops, but fortunate since the kale was amazing! Maybe I'll come back in the summer time.",0.9963,0.831,0.129,0.04,0.49651282051282053
2016-02-12,5.0,"I had no idea what I was walking into when I came here, I just knew a few friends mentioned Avec was awesome and yada yada yada. Coming in was a bit of a surprise, the place is squeeze tight small. You'll have some room to walk around, but there is bar seating (which has long waits) and communal seating which is a free-for-all. You can get more privacy at the bar, but the communal you will basically be seated at a table with open seats. You might be squished into the middle, or if you're lucky, you will get the end seats. It'll be difficult to get seated with more than 4 people in my opinion, but you can try your luck. Came here with my gf and we luckily got the end of the table. Ordered some drinks which were good, and got two small plates - the butcher's steak and the whipped brandade. The steak came around medium and I enjoyed it, but my gf likes steaks more well done (I know...). The whipped brandade didn't do much for us, I would recommend trying the dates. I didn't try them, but someone next to us got them and they looked fantastic... bacon chorizo and some sauce, just get it. I recommend one small plate for a couple. The large plates are pretty enormous. We got the wood oven paella and the slow roasted pork shoulder. Wood oven paella was amazing. I loved the slow roasted pork shoulder as well, the lemon yogurt was amazing with the pork shoulder. The serving sizes seem pretty large - we orderd two small plates, and our waitress recommended half-plate of the paella and we couldn't even finish the pork shoulder dish that much. Stick with one small plate to share between two people, and individual large plate per person. It gets pretty cluttered but its a very casual feel. If you get stuck in the middle of a table you might hate the experience. The food is really good though. As long as you aren't uptight and demand perfection, you should have a good experience here. It takes a while for the food to come out, so maybe order your large plate as your small plate comes to you. Still, I'd recommend Avec to anyone.",0.9981,0.747,0.225,0.028,0.5537878787878786

It was packed with flavor due to all the sauces and I couldn't help but scarf it down. The service was also great.

We weren't that hungry, else we would've gone for actual entrees rather than these small plates. Hubs enjoyed a beer, I a Spanish cidre.

It seemed like they must have been under different management because something was off. We were served a burrata salad with a very bitter tasting vegetable. I didn't understand that, since it took away from the burrata and Avec prides themselves on fresh ingredients. Then, we had the kale salad which wasn't mixed well together (everything was at the bottom) and it was drenched in dressing. The rest of the meal was underwhelming to say the least.

My biggest issue with this place is the space. Yes, it's super cramped, and you dine at long tables smooshed up next to total strangers, which is not my thing at all, HOWEVER that is not my biggest issue. The tables/benches/chairs are AWFUL. The chairs are super tiny, basically little wooden squares with backs that are approximately one inch tall (that is not an exaggeration). I am a pretty small person and I could barely even cross my legs under the table, which was built for Smurfs.

We ordered the octopus, kale salad and skirt steak as small plates to share. The octopus and steak were satisfying dishes with plenty of interesting flavors, textures and colors.  The kale salad leaned a bit to far to the tart side. It could have used either more sweet or savory to balance the dish. That said, we had it first so it did a nice job to wake up the palate.   For a large dish, we ordered the paella.  This dish had good flavor and crunch since the dish was baked to crisp up the rice. I wish it had more protein or artichoke heart in the dish, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Seating is either at the bar or on a communal table. They really pack you in. It's a fun atmosphere if you are in the mood to chat with a neighbor and see what everyone else is eating. If you want something quiet and more intimate, this is not the place.

Little things like the pasta was no longer homemade, and the apple pie was clearly made earlier and heated up before serving (it was soggy and partly cold).  I love Paul Kahn--Paul, please bring the quality back!",0.9596,0.723,0.228,0.048,0.5277777777777778

2015-12-01,2.0,"After reading so many rave reviews, I have been wanting to try Avec with much anticipation.  My girlfriend and I finally went for a late dinner and expected to be wowed.  What a disappointment.   Upon entering we were greeted with an apathetic hostess who barely made eye contact or said hello.  After being seated our waiter came over and also had a bit of an attitude.  We asked him about an item on the menu and he answered us in a dry cold manner saying one word - ""terrific"" followed by an awkward silence... Nothing about the content of the dish, the reason for it being so great, etc.   We ordered 2 small plates and 1 large plate: the kale panzanella, butcher's steak and rigatoni bolognese.  The kale salad dressing was bitter and overly pungent.  It had some kind of hot pepper that was not listed on the menu and overpowered the dish, so much so I felt my lips burning.  The croutons - a staple of panzanella, were stale and flavorless.  And worst of all, barely 2 bites of one of my favorite cheeses - halloumi.  Then the steak arrived; I remained hopeful.  The meat was well seasoned and tender, albeit a bit undercooked, but I felt it was excessively covered in parsley which overpowered the dish.  The portion was also very small for $16.  Lastly, the pasta arrived and it was mediocre at best.  The onions in the dish were undercooked and overpowering and the flavors just didn't quite go together.   To top it all, the interior design may be intended to be ""minimalistic chic"", but in fact is just uncomfortable. Seats are hard wood flat bottomed, with no back rests. My back was really bothering me by the time we were ready to leave (and I don't suffer from any back problems). Tables are long and rectangular, providing for communal dining - the hefty amount of money one spends in this place is apparently not enough to earn you an inch of privacy. Also, if you grab a table, there are only two seating options - facing the bar (which means you're staring right into people's backs sitting on the bar stools) or facing the wall (which means you're staring at a wooden plain wall with no decorations, pictures, etc.). It felt like a cheap pizza joint.  All in all the food was unsatisfying and the service was lacking.  The staff was unfriendly, not to mention my girlfriend's water glass went empty several times and we had to call over a server to refill it.  The interior design was just flat out wrong. This was an overpriced distasteful experience.",-0.2486,0.851,0.07,0.079,0.5132604470359571

We live down the street from Avec and aren't at that point in our lives anymore where No Reservations Accepted works for us, but the lingering crowds have definitely been an allure all these years, so we finally went during lunch today and everything we ordered was top notch, with great service to boot.  My husband and I mainly shared several small plates (like 5 - we went hungry!), had their yummy house made lemonade, and split a to-die-for orange marmalade gelato.  When compared to the other more ""commercial"" lunches I usually have in the loop which ring in at $10-$12, I feel like Avec offered a menu that was truly unique, fresh, flavorful, and filling all for a price point that was just slightly more.  Plus, I'm a vegetarian and felt totally satisfied with the number of options available to me, not having to pick from the single selection as is the case at many other establishments.  Totally loved it and will definitely be back again soon, and may even consider bearing the wait for an evening meal next time.",0.9938,0.753,0.239,0.007,0.4687118437118437
2015-11-29,5.0,"Amazing and memorable dinner here! Try to come early or during off hours as the restaurant is small and the wait could be long during peak hours. They do have a nice little hangout spot outside to sip wine while you're waiting for a table though.  On to the meal, here's a breakdown of what we ordered (dishes are served tapas style and meant to be shared): - Strawberry with fava beans, mint, straciatella cheese, rose vinegar, and aleppo pepper: Good refreshing summer dish that worked well as a sort of palete cleanser since the rest of our dishes were on the heavier, fattier side. - Smoked whitefish with taramasalsta, pickled turnip, cucumber, and baby spinach on seed bread: Solid dish especially for those who enjoy seafood, the smoked flavor is very apparent. - Chorizo stuffed medjool dates: bacon wrapped and served with piquillo pepper tomato sauce. This dish was packed with flavor; the sweetness of dates marries well with the saltiness of chorizo and the sauce adds a nice spicy kick. Be sure to soak up some more of that sauce goodness with the bread that comes served with the dish. - Squid ink pasta with sardines, fennel, lemon, dill and n'duja bread crumbs: This dish is packed full of aromatic flavor; I thought the sardine was bordering a bit on overwhelming but that could just because I don't eat sardines much. The dish was still delicious and I would recommend it for anyone who isn't afraid of some bolder flavors. - Honey lemon semifreddo with almond meringue and basil apricot sauce. Dessert was decent, didn't blow me away but I'm also not a dessert person so don't know if that's saying much. We were too full to get the much-raved about nutter butters, but the girlfriend has had them before and she says they're amazing :)  Decor here is modern and clean. The interior is lined with an abundance of natural wood. It's a bit on the pricey side, but the food is delicious. Definitely a date-worthy spot or a place you can go to celebrate a significant event.

The dates are exceptionally flavorful, a nice mix of sweet and savory with a hearty chorizo stuffing and bacon wrapping (thanks, Publican Quality Meats!) I would drink shots of the piquillo pepper sauce.  The preparation of the pork shoulder varies, but it's always incredibly tender and a very large portion. The latest rendition I've tried, with smoked clams and arugula, was very, very salty - hopefully that was just a one-off occurrence.  And man, I'm not a fan of truffle oil in most foods, but I think it actually pairs really well with the soft taleggio in the focaccia.  I'd love to try Avec's other offerings...it's just hard to stray from the staples above. A bit pricey, but generally worth it.",0.9508,0.827,0.143,0.029,0.49787114845938363

2015-11-17,5.0,"One of my favorite spots in the city -- most recently sat at the bar stools directly in front of the stove, and it was an amazing front row seat to everything that was coming out of the kitchen. I highly recommend it if you're luckly enough to be there when it's available. The entire kitchen staff popped over to check on us, making sure our questions were answered and even talking us through their prep/techniques as we watched them assemble delicious dish after delicious dish. We also kept commenting on how calm and respectful the kitchen crew was -- it was strange to see a fairly busy kitchen staff work in such a zen state. Everyone there is passionate about what they do and what they serve, and seemed entirely approachable. Our server (seemed to be the manager) smirked as he plopped unknown tasters down when we requested help deciding on wine (he seemed to enjoy watching us try things and then surprising us with which pour it was), and the generous wine pours (a full pour + a small carafe with another pour+) are a solid deal. When we couldn't decide between the kale and serrano ham plate as starters, they ended up giving us the kale, compliments of the house, which left us giggling and smiling like kids. It was also fortuitous, as it's now one of my favorite dishes. The portions are generous, and they've adopted a few ""half"" portions for some of their larger menu items (dates, chicken, and paella can all be halved and still fill your belly). The kale panzanella was insanely good -- smokey and salty and complex. We kept stopping between bites and exclaiming, ""I mean.. this is kale.. How is this salad? This is amazing. I don't understand."" The paella made me smile -- crispy rice bits, smokey sausage, and shrimp -- and the pork shoulder made us weep with happiness (what felt like 5lbs of pork happiness - it was huge and dense and ridiculously tender). The one of the chefs (ok, all of the chefs)  excitedly recommended we take some home and throw a fried egg over it. YES PLEASE. Oh, and the serrano ham plate? It's huge. It was like getting a huge salad made out of ham, with pickled grapes that made my heart flutter. Everyone's great about helping you edit your choices, and making sure you understand how much food you really just ordered. Our guy talked us down a bit from our list when it grew to about 25% of the menu items. They also have a monthly brunch series with guest chefs that looks amazing, and that I'm excited to check out at some point. We went on a Sunday @ 7p with no wait, but it can get busy on Fri-Sat.

Came in 4 pieces and again, the sweetness of the dates and saltiness of the chorizo and bacon were perfectly balanced. The tomato pepper sauce added a nice touch of acidity that really complimented the dates and made this dish different from other bacon wrapped dates I've tried. Definitely recommend! I also tried the Whole Roasted Branzino. Cooked and seasoned perfectly but since it is a mild tasting fish, I always found it a bit boring. They topped it with some wonderful colors which included carrots, parsley, cilantro, garbanzo beans (which were undercooked). It was good but I think the others items on the menu were better.

The communal table is a great place to chat, and I actually made friends with two of my neighbors who were on a date.  The food is top notch, but I wouldn't say it blew my mind. The staff however were some of the friendliest in Chicago. They always have a joke ready and they know when it is/isn't appropriate to jump in to a conversation. Service is fast and drinks are strong. My only complaint is that it does get crowded.

2015-10-04,5.0,"Sadly the brunch has come to an end and I must move on. This was an amazing experience. Everything from the service to the food to the ambience was great. I can't say anything bad about his place. Just know the space is a little small and gets fairly crowded for brunch. If you don't like eating too close to strangers or get claustrophobic easily this might not be the restaurant for you. If you go during the brunch rush (11-1pm) you need to anticipate waiting for both your table and food. I recommend going as close to 10am as possible since they don't take reservations. I'm very impressed with how quickly they do serve you given the space they have to work with. If you eat at the bar, hopefully you get Duron to wait on you. He's a stud. Kelly is great too. They function in a very tight space and have a lot of people to wait on so be patient with them. I suggest going at 10am when they open to avoid as much of the crowds as possible. I've been there from 10-3pm so have seen the entire brunch unfold in real time. They close the kitchen at 2pm so just make sure you get your last order in before then and you can eat and drink until 3pm. Just know they start seating people for dinner at 3:30pm. After trying everything on the menu, my favorite small plates are the poached eggs and chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. Favorite large plates are the pizza, pork shoulder, and focaccia. Both the papas braves and pork belly are great sides. Nutter butters and Affogato for dessert are amazing too.

We had an unruly group of people next to us that were several cocktails in when we got there, and then still ordering drinks when we left. The whole time they were yelling, laughing at crazy volumes. I should state the men were the ooc ones, the ladies with them were well mannered. We order a mix of plates - we didn't the infamous dates - might have to grab em at some point. Since we love meat, we had the lamb, pork shoulder, steak and then a fish pate to get some variety. Also had a wine. Everything was good and the pork was outstanding.

2015-09-26,5.0,"SO. GOOD. The most sophisticated party for your taste buds!  I'm a vegetarian, but having options was not a problem at all. Our waitress recommended a bunch of great things: 1) Royal Jamaican - Ginger beer [$5] -- On the (much) sweeter side with a strong ginger taste,  but a pretty solid drink if you have a thing for ginger.  2) Charred corn - tabbouleh with peach, freekeh, parsely, radish, olive and tahini [$12] --  FREEKEHN GREAT. It is enough for two people probably, but I sneakily pecked at it all night long, till it was gone. Smoked, spiced, and seasoned just right.  3) Burrata Pizza - with charred eggplant, cherry tomato confit, basil, and calabrian chili honey [$18] -- Heaven....Is it sweet? Is it savory? Is it spicy? Is it herby? Is it soft? Is it crispy? Is it awesome? YES, to all of the above. I used to be an Eduardo's Enoteca pizza fanatic....but I think this one has won me over! 4) Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce [$14] -- My brother, who loves his meat, got this...Couldn't stop raving about it the whole time he was eating it and saying ""you wish you weren't a vegetarian right now"" ...He finished the whole thing..alone.... Having stuffed our faces, we didn't have room for dessert, but it definitely looked good. So maybe just share a bunch of little portions and then end with something sweet, because chances are, its probably amazing!  One little thing - You do get seated really close to each other, enough to have the side of your arms touching the person next to you sometimes. But it's loud enough for you and your party to have your own conversation (perhaps having to lean in and repeat yourself a few times to hard of hearing people like me). Overall, the crowd is friendly, the service is solid, and the overall ambiance is perfect for essentially any event.

2015-09-15,5.0,"Love this place! Went here for dinner w/ a friend before she left Chicago, and I had been wanting to dine here so I'm glad she picked this spot. We came on Thursday night around 7 and the place was packed, but we were lucky enough to grab a seat immediately at the bar. They have a nice wine list and we settled for a bottle of red from Spain (I forget which). The real star, though, is the food. We got: -Seared trout with red pepper-almond romesco and rock shrimp escabeche: the trout was cooked perfectly and had a great sear. I think this was my first time having a romesco and I definitely loved the sauce and flavor that it added to the dish. -Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce: THESE ARE CRACK. I really don't know how else to describe them. It had the perfect amount of sweet and savory from the dates and chorizo, respectively. Anytime you have bacon, that's a plus. The sauce compliments the dish very well. Also, I've had bacon-wrapped-anything before, but the way they wrap the bacon here is some sort of witchcraft. Normally, whenever you cut into something wrapped in bacon, the bacon sort of falls apart or falls off whatever it wrapped. The bacon here, however, stayed wrapped tightly around the dates. I know this is a weird thing to get excited about, but it made eating the entire dish easier and not as messy. A must-get! -Slow roasted pork shoulder with piri piri broth, cracked wheat, snow pea, smoked yogurt and clams: tender and packed full of flavor. The yogurt was a great accompaniment to the dish. Also, the clams were a welcome surprise (I don't think I've had pork + clams in the same dish before). Another must-get! It's a pretty lively spot. If you're seated at the tables, you will probably be right up next to a stranger, so be prepared to make friends. It can get pretty loud here, so you definitely won't be having any intimate, quiet conversations here. Also, they don't take reservations, so come in really early or really late, as I've come here before during primetime and was quoted a wait of 2 hours (or...just get lucky like we did and hope to grab a seat by the bar).

For starters, the restaurant gets extremely loud and it was next to impossible to have any sort of conversation - I could barely hear our waitress. We also sat directly behind the kitchen and ovens, which meant it was really hot. Finally, we were also sitting right by the entrance to the bathrooms, which is generally unpleasant.

We started with the sangria - which was typical sangria.  We had the  chorizo stuffed dates - which given all the rave reviews, I was expecting much much better.  We also had the whipped brandade - which even though I am not a big fish fan, I went for.  It was a spread that you put on large pieces of garlic bread.  It was pretty good.  The bread is very filling, however.  Keep that in mind.   For our main dish, we got the pork shoulder - which neither my husband nor myself really cared for.  The smoked yogurt on it was really good, but certainly not enough of it.  We ended with the warm raspberry bread pudding - which seemed to be a very popular dish, but again - nothing that was great.  The creme fraiche sort of ruined it for me.

2015-08-18,3.0,"This was definitely one of the most disappointing dining experiences i've had this year. Everything I ate (with the exception of the bread, I felt I could have cooked better myself and for a fraction of the price. I also found the seating style to be obscene and obnoxious: we were seated in the middle and we finished eating before the party at the end, so two of the three of them had to stand up IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR MEAL to let us out. I think communal seating can be okay when you're in the mood for it, but not like this...you should be able to get up without disrupting an entire table. Here's what we ate:  Chicken Liver Crostini: This was the first thing they brought to the table. It took them 30 minutes (which was confusing because it's clear that they had the liver pate sitting in the fridge and just spooned it into the container they served it in...there's no reason it should have taken that long, especially considering that they brought the second dish out (a hot one) 5 minutes after we started eating that one. This was pretty good. If you like chicken liver you will appreciate this...but it wasn't exceptional Brandade: This was the second dish that was served. This was decent but WAY too salty (they buttered the bread with salted butter and then generously seasoned the fish as well. Trout with shrimp:  The trout was cooked very well, but the shrimp were not good...the quality just did not seem good (maybe farmed and previously frozen). Pork Shoulder: This had to be the biggest culinary disappointment of the night. The conceptualization of this dish was ridiculous: Pork with clams in a salty broth covered in creamy yogurt sitting in ""cracked wheat"" that is soaking in the broth. WHY? I would definitely avoid this one. Amaretto Cake with Peaches:  This was okay, but it did not seem fresh...we agreed that it must have been sitting in the fridge for hours (not in a good way...like, maybe hours was actually days).  The Alcoholic Ginger beer was excellent (it's bottled, not something they make in house); I thought the cucumber cocktail was not good, but my boyfriend liked it (I would only recommend it if you really really love artificial cucumber flavor). I've given this 3 stars because I think the technique was there, but the flavors, execution, and concept are are not great. P.

2015-07-22,3.0,"We've now been here for brunch once (previous review) and dinner once. I'm not really sold on the place. The food has been a mixed bag, ranging from quite good to pretty poor. My wife liked it less than I did too.  I thought the chorizo stuffed dates were very good, as everyone says. The pork shoulder entree was quite good as well. The focaccia bread large plate is very bland, and probably not what you are picturing when you think focaccia. It's two very thin layers, the thickness and crunchiness of a saltine cracker, with cheese in the middle. It tastes like it needs a few extra ingredients to give it some personality. Their Sangria also is lackluster, skip it. Overall the food, for me, was probably a 3.5 or 4 star. I don't care for the environment at all though. It's very small, very crowded, very communal, and very loud. Even on a Tuesday, we were quite literally elbow to elbow between two other parties at a communal table, and were cupping our ears and shouting to hear each other 8 inches away. Just not my style for dinner. And the food, while good, wasn't good enough to make me want to repeat that experience. Still, its a place worth trying.",0.9757,0.828,0.146,0.025,0.4578483245149912
2015-07-22,3.0,This is my second time here. The food was so great the first time that it set a very high bar. This time I ordered 3 dishes and I only enjoyed 1 of them. Came here at 6pm and we can sit at the bar without wait. - Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates: I LOVE this dish from the last time. MUST try! - Charred Sepia: I think the chef just put TOO MUCH salt on the sepia. It was so salty. But it helped with the intake of the arugula and watermelon at the same time. It would be a great dish for the summer if the sepia was less salty - Squid ink pasta: The pasta taste TOO fishy. It tasted more fishy than a piece of raw tuna. And I do not like small bones in general. So do not order this dish if you feels the same way. Because the Sardines has a lot of small bones in it.  I am a little disappointed since I got such a great experience last time. But in general this place is a great hangout place for groups or single travelers. People at the bar are very friendly and will give you a lot of good tips.,0.9882,0.812,0.166,0.023,0.462898482469911
2015-07-20,3.0,"A group of us from the office went to Avec on a Thursday at 12:15pm.  It was a 30 minute wait for a table so we sat at the bar instead.  From the second we at down, I was immediately uncomfortable.  The restaurant is long and narrow in minimalist decor, with the main ""path"" right down the middle.  The bar is on one side and tables are on the other.  If you're sitting at the bar, customers and wait staff are always walking by and brushing into you.  It was loud and crowded with communal tables.  This was a major turn off for me but I can see how others would like the social aspect.   For lunch I tried the charred beet tartine and sampled someone else's salmon tartine. The beet dish was just alright but the salmon was amazing.  Cooked perfectly on crispy bread.  I really enjoyed the salmon although there seemed to be a collective feeling among the people I was with, the food was too salty overall.

2015-07-14,5.0,"Visiting a friend in the city and came by one of her favorite spots! We called in on a Monday and night and were told a 45 minute wait, but as soon as we arrived we were seated at the bar!  Started off with some delicious rose sangria with blueberries. One serving is enough for about 2 wine glasses. As for the food- incredible. We were a party of 3, and split the stuffed dates, the strawberry salad (they used cherries that day), the steak, and the paella. All items so so original, fresh, and satisfying! Favorite, by far, were the stuffed dates in a pablano pepper tomato sauce. My least favorite dish was the paella (only because I was comparing it to a paella I recently had in Spain.., probably not fair!), but it was a huge portion, perfect to share. I was most impressed by their desserts- my friend I came with us a pastry chef, and she said it was one of her spots in the city for unique deserts. The home made nutter butters come in 4 (size of ice cubes, I'd say) and great to share. although I could have easily finished them on my own...even two orders! We might have gone a bit overboard on dessert, as we also ordered the goat cheese and cookie, as well as the merengue tart. But really...Can you really ever go overboard on dessert?? Needless to say, not a bite was left on our plates from all our meals. I love this place. Price point is amazing for the quality and location of the restaurant.

2015-07-12,3.0,"Quick Summary --- Solid fine dining with a breadth of intriguing dishes, delivered in a claustrophobic communal seating attached to a high price tag. No reservations allowed, so make sure you plan for up to an hour of waiting during peak dinner hours. Knowledgeable staff to guide your through their impressive wine offerings. Highly recommended: chorizo-stuffed dates Intro --- Like many reviewers here, Avec had been on my to-try list for a while. Various friends have encouraged for me to try it. The long narrow dining room always intrigued me, and when a friend and I planned to eat at The Publican only to find it reserved for a private party, with Avec in proximity, it was the perfect opportunity to give Avec a shot. Setting --- The dining room is long and quite narrow with a pleasing minimalist aesthetic. There's the bar seating on one side and the table seating on the other separated by a very narrow space to traverse the length of the room. The tables are communal. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of communal seating, at least when it comes to finer dining. It was crowded and loud. My friend was seated at the middle of the table up against the wall, so as we were leaving the table, three other people had to get up and move for him to get out. Honestly, this restaurant commands too high a price for customers to have to deal with that kind of inconvenience. Service --- It was a very busy night, and it seemed like there was only one server. The server seemed stressed and wasn't in the best of moods, but I couldn't blame her. I felt rushed in ordering due to her impatience. On the flip side, she was of great help when I was trying to decide what wine to have. Their list is impressive, and she made a great selection based off of what characteristics I wanted. Not too sure if my request to have the wine be brought out with the first dish was obnoxious, but the wait for the food seemed to be long (and it was) and I didn't want my white wine to be warm by the time the food came out. She was visibly annoyed with the request, and perhaps in hindsight, with how busy they were, it was not the best request to make. The wine, however, was presented by the time we finished dish #2 out of 3. Wasn't too happy about that. Food (for 2) --- (* denotes highly recommended)    Charred octopus with white beans: The lemon lifted up the dish with a piercing (but pleasant) that cut through the savoriness of the octopus and beans. Great char on the octopus, extremely tender and fresh. The hazelnuts were far too large and felt disruptive. Sure it paired well with the nuttiness of endives, but the texture combination of slimy beans, leafy endives, and crunchy hazelnuts was not appreciated.    * Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates: I've had plenty of bacon wrapped dates, but this is by far the greatest of them all. The added spicy and acidic dimensions provided by the chorizo and tomato sauce respectively were in perfect balance with the salty and sweet dimensions of the bacon and dates. It seems from the other reviews here that you can order a half-portion of this? Don't sell yourself short. Get the full portion. No, get five full portions. 10/10 would order again 10 times.    Slow roasted pork shoulder: Huge generous service of pork. Slowly cooked to fork-tender, the meat melted in my mouth. The Brussels sprouts held up their own against the pork and spiced lentils, while the apples added a much needed vibrancy to an otherwise heavy dish. It was delicious, but split between two people, the portion was too much. Other notes --- With the crowded communal setting, this is not a place for an intimate date. The food was overall very good, but not without flaws. With a high price point, I wouldn't necessarily call it a great value. I saw some other large plates being served to those adjacent to us, and they really are large. Between two people, perhaps it would be better to stick to the small plates. Conclusion --- A beautifully designed dining space marred by the almost-claustrophobic seating. Having only tried three dishes, I do think Avec warrants another visit to try the other enticing menu options. However, I would do so at non-peak hours as the service provided by a stressed irate server was less than ideal. The food was great, but a tad overpriced. My overall experience here wasn't poor by any means, but it wasn't great either. Keep in mind this is just my experience from ONE visit, as there are plenty of stellar reviews. It's worth checking out yourself at least once. Grade --- (1* - never come back, 2* - poor, 3* - good, 4* - excellent, 5* - perfect) Avec gets a 3.5*",0.9988,0.776,0.171,0.054,0.565931164545026
2015-07-03,3.0,"Ugh I would have gave this place an easy 5 stars if it wasn't for the awful kale pizza we got. To start we had the bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates that were amazing. The dates were lukewarm while the tomato sauce it came in was 400 degrees hot (I burnt my mouth so bad because I wasn't expecting it to be so hot from the bite of lukewarm stuffed date I had) which is something they could work on. But still an awesome dish. Then we ordered the kale pizza and the seafood paella. The waitress said the pizza would come out first and we were completely fine with that because that's how we wanted it to be, so we would have the star of the night and the heaviest dish (the paella) at the end. 45 minutes goes by and the paella arrives first. The paella is awesome and even better after we asked for lemon to squeeze on top. So good and such a large serving! They must have forgot about our pizza. The waitress apologized that it was taking long and said it should be out soon. We finished the entire paella (probably took about 20 minutes) and then the pizza finally came out. At this point we were full and decided to try 1 bite and box the rest.  Well let me tell you that 1 bite was awful. It has a green pesto which literally tastes like a ginger-apple-spinach smoothie that was dumped all over the crust. The pesto had such a sweet taste to it and I swear it had hints of ginger. Then it had toasted walnuts which I do not think went well and some sort of white cheese that did not have any flavor at all. Then it had some kale on top which was the only good part of the pizza which is sad to say. I am cringing thinking about that green-smoothie pesto that should have never been on a pizza. So from the taste of the pizza and the way the food came out I knocked it down 2 stars. I wish we would have never ordered the pizza because we definitely did not need it and it caused all the problems.",0.9828,0.828,0.125,0.047,0.635778289810548
2015-06-30,1.0,"I have been to Avec on three previous occasions and the food was always excellent and the service was satisfactory. However on my recent visit, the food was again great, but the service strongly detracted from the overall experience.  The maitre'd who seated me just placed the two menues on the counter without the usual 'have a nice dinner'.  The waitress started out OK. I ordered two items and a glass of wine.  About halfway through the meal, it would have been nice if the water glass had been refilled, but that never happened.  I could have used another glass of wine, but the waitress never checked back, not even to ask 'how's the food'.  Then before I was finished with main course item number 2, the cleanup guy came by, took my plate with knife and fork.  I told him that I needed my knife to finish the second course and he said that he would be right back with another one. I never did get another knife, so I finished cutting the entree item with my fork.  The waiteress finally did come by and I said that I might like another glass of wine.  However after over 5 minutes had passed, I just asked for my check.  In a restaurnat with like this one that has really excellent food, I seldom tip less than 18%, but for this meal, 9% seemed sufficient.  I have had far better service at restaurants where the food was not nearly as good.  The staff here seemed distracted or bored and that contributed to the negative experience that I had.  Clearly, the staff needs some serious training in how service should be conducted in what could be a fine restaurant.",0.9768,0.803,0.14,0.057,0.5383597883597884

My first visit out, I was smitten with the food, the booze, the space, the faucet in the Men's room and then while urinating into the toilet I was bobbing my head to some great hip hop music whose tunes were echoing from some unknown destination.  I walked back into the hallway to see where it was coming from and was met by a server headed to the basement.  So, I asked about the hip hop.  He said, ""that's the dishwasher, he likes this music.""  I asked if I could get the rest of my order down there with that guy.   I couldn't.",0.9959,0.807,0.186,0.006,0.46412037037037046

2015-05-28,3.0,"Expensive, uncomfortable, loud, and just ok.  This perhaps has been one of the biggest disappointments of my dining adventures in Chicago.  This is my first time in Avec (will definitely be my last) and I had heard wonderful things about the place. What a disappointment our experience here was.  Firstly, the restaurant is very small, doesn't take reservations, has shared tables and is EXTREMELY noisy! I could barely hear my fiancée and this made conversation difficult and uncomfortable. Furthermore, our table neighbors (seated in our same table and with which I constantly rubbed shoulders) were annoyingly loud.  Food was just OK.  We started by sharing the Serrano Ham platter and started with the wrong foot. Simple, uncreative, boring. No other way to describe it. We followed with the salmon starter and it was an improvement, still nothing impressive. We continued with a whole fish that was actually pretty good! But definitely not worth $42. For desert, we concluded with a cheesecake ""with chocolate"", which turned out to be a chocolate cheesecake (and I'm not a big fan of chocolate).  Overall, our experience was only ok. I am disappointed because I had heard great things about Avec and there was nothing great about our dinner.  The only ""great"" thing was the bill: UBER EXPENSIVE and totally not worth it  (and we didn't even order wine).",0.8589,0.706,0.159,0.135,0.5958897243107771

I was shocked that a restaurant could pull of a great paella without more time (they'd well thought out the prep).  Too many times restaurant try to pull off soupy rice or just rice with veggies and meat/seafood as paella.  The rice held rich flavor and had a nice level of soccarat (caramelized rice).  The snap peas were possibly the best vegetarian dish I've had.  The salmon had a unique sweet chili glaze that was a whole new way of tasting salmon.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.",0.9938,0.716,0.268,0.017,0.635930735930736

2015-05-21,3.0,"I am confused writing this review. If it weren't for the mishaps, maybe I'd give it an extra star. I wanted to like this more. This was bookmarked for over 2 yrs and I decided to take the bf out here for his birthday. For a Wed evening at 7, the host (initially) said there was no wait but i had to wait for the boy to get here before seating. From the looks of it, tables and bar seats were all full. Then at one moment the host said it would be a 30 min wait but then we were seated about 5 min. Confused but yaay! I guess it was a matter of minutes for some diners to leave.  observations: -picnic seats - very 'communal' seating. You better get comfortable with others next to you. you are seated so close that a 5 ft., 110 lb. person like myself will likely bump elbows with you. This happened 3 times. if you are sitting on the wall side, people have to get out of their seats for you to move in.....interesting. guess it's a great way to maximize revenue.    - you can hear everyone's conversation or lack of conversation next to you. Lucky for us, we can speak another language to give ourselves some privacy. (LOL!) the eh or mishaps: - While I waited for the boy to park the car, I was looking at the wine list and asked for suggestions from the hosts. the bartender(?) nearby suggested something that sounded ok and I told the host I'll try remember it later when I order. She told me ""oh I think he'll bring it over to try"". which sounded nice as my intention was to buy a bottle with the birthday boy. i had no intention to open a tab and buy a glass right there...but instead they give me full glass...(um....I never actually ordered it). In about 1 min once the bf arrived, I had to close out this ""forced"" tab since we were going to be seated.  - once we were seated, The BF asked the waitress for a glass (just the empty glass) to share the ""forced"" glass of wine I was having. we thought we'll order a different wine later. She even asked if we wanted just the glass...instead we end up getting a second full glass of the same wine. So the idea to buy a bottle was not happening and the idea to try something different didn't happen either.  - Dessert mishap? - see below Food: - The chorizo-stuffed medjool dates were great. the chorizo had a good kick. these are stuffed well. thanks to fellow yelpers, I took the idea to get a half order, which allowed us to try more items - the octopus was tasty - it was just a small slab over a bed of white beans. looking at the menu prices....this wasn't that worth it. maybe it was a good 4 small bites to savor. - the salmon - was decently portioned and tasty.  - the slow roasted pork shoulder - (very popular item but...) it didn't live up to the hype much.  this last dish was a heavy stew of brussel sprouts and lentils. the pork was very tender no doubt. waitress was nice enough to provide a small half portion of bread since it didn't come with anything. rice would be a nice compliment. anyways it made great leftovers for lunch that was envied by my coworkers today. it was a bit salty and just heavy compared to the seafood dishes obviously.  - praline cheesecake: this came out with a candle on top as we told the waitress that it was the boy's birthday. it was just okay...but i was so full to enjoy it much. I was hoping a place like AVEC would have taken this off the check as a birthday courtesy...maybe it was my bad to assume but they didn't. Maybe I'd come back if I someone else wanted to try it and there happened to be no wait but otherwise there are plenty of other places to try.",0.9961,0.828,0.125,0.048,0.44300595238095236

I felt like I had just competed in a food eating competition and that the buttons on my jeans would pop off any minute.

2015-04-29,3.0,"It hurts me to write this. I'd been wanting to go here for months. Like ever since I heard Avec existed. It's been bookmarked on my Yelp forever. I'd been waiting for the right time because they don't take reservations and I didn't want to wait forever.  So three of us went on a Wednesday night around 7:30 and were seated right away. Yay! Awesome! We ordered. First come the chorizo stuffed dates. Basically giant bacon wrapped dates the size of meatballs.  Were they good? Yes. But they're bacon wrapped dates. No better or worse than any others I've had at other tapas places. Slightly different texture but not that great.  Then the serrano ham. This was freaking awesome. The ham is so thinly cut and creamy but not too salty. On top of it is super thinly sliced pears (I believe), arugula, peas.. idk what else just awesomeness. I loved this. This was amazing and hands down my favorite dish, but honestly the competition wasn't that strong.  Next came the focaccia. It was good but surprisingly bland. Disappointingly bland. I love truffle anything so I kind of had high hopes for this and I just expected a lot more flavor.  The paella came after and it was good but I realized I'm not a huge paella fan (crazy right.. not the paella's fault).  The sausage in the paella was creamy melt in your mouth goodness.  And finally we also had the whipped brandade which was tasty but after a while the garlic gets really strong.  It was good but nothing unique.  That's kind of how I felt about a lot of this: good but not as amazing as it was hyped up to be and the focaccia really was on the bland side. The serrano ham was the only thing that stuck out. A unique combination of flavors that were amazing. Finally, we had dessert. The chocolate cheesecake and gelato.  The cheesecake was good but not very rich. In a good way, it seemed less dense but maybe it was still a huge calorie bomb like regular cheesecake. I liked it but it wasn't actually that cheesecake-y.  The gelato that night was burnt honey gelato. Holy hell that was good. Super rich and creamy and the flavor was unique. My two friends and I are all foodies. One thought the meal was great (4 star worth), the other thought it was just ok (3 star worth) so 2/3 of us were unimpressed. I would not go here again given that I know so many other places in the city are so much more amazing. Also be ready to rub elbows with your neighbors given the table set up.

Diners were dressed a lot more casually than I expected to see here. Like others have mentioned, if you enjoy personal space while dining, Avec may not be the place for you--communal dining in a very small restaurant may make some uncomfortable.  We ordered 2 small plates and 2 large plates (and dessert)--no regrets! We left feeling very satisfied.  The squid ink pasta arrived first, which I wish had come later in the meal. I'm a huge fan of squid ink pasta, and this did not disappoint. The sardines added a nice saltiness while the fennel and lemon provided a nice balance to the dish. The textures were also perfect together.  Next, we received the charred octopus. This dish was another hit! It included 2 large pieces of octopus, which were perfect since this was defined as a small plate. The octopus was cooked great, too. The char mixed great with the ""sauce"" it came with.  Deluxe focaccia was next in the lineup--this is a must try! I was apprehensive to order something as plain as focaccia at dinner, but I'm happy I was convinced otherwise. I'd also suggest asking for honey with this dish. The sweetness of the honey balances the saltiness of the bread and cheese.  The chorizo stuffed dates were our final course. Just like everyone has said, you must try them! The dates were much larger than I expected, but you definitely get a good amount of food for your money! We also ordered Avec's take on Nutter Butters for dessert--they were so cheap and a perfect end to the meal! I think they were $3 or $4, and we recieved 4 little squares of what tasted exactly like a Nutter Butter. If you're looking for a sweet bite to end your meal, this is a great option.

I went with a couple of people and we order brunch food. I have to say the food was phenomenal and I enjoy it so much along with my mimosa. The waiter we had was very attentive to our needs and he apologize right away feeling bad in giving our check already knowing we didn't get our last dish yet. The restaurant was pack and we didn't have to wait that long to be seated. The decor is of the place is nice with a nice ambiance. I would definitely go back to this restaurant a bring along some other friends who haven't try the place.,0.9643,0.798,0.171,0.031,0.48241567460317464
2015-03-16,4.0,"Avec was our final meal before departing Chicago, a last hurrah to the city and snow before we headed back to O'Hara. It's one of many successful restaurants under Paul Kahan, a wine-focused dining space that first opened in 2003. Although the restaurant has received more praise for the eclectic, ever-changing menu that pulls from many different cuisines and genres, it's nonetheless yet another quintessential Chicago restaurant. We arrived on the early end of a weekend brunch, as Avec does not take reservations; thankfully, at the time, there were only a few other parties present, so we were quickly greeted and seated at a table. The dining room is bright, featuring light woodwork, and the single row of dining tables in addition to the bar seating can be deemed minimalistic. It's a clear counter to the diversity of dishes found on their menu, which are small(er) plates, and best when shared. Each is as tempting as the last, and it's not difficult to overorder; three dishes is a good starting point between two people, unless, of course, you have sizable appetites like the two of us. One of the must-order dishes at Avec is the Chorizo-stuffed Medjool Dates. Lovers of the combination of sweet and savory will instantly appreciate this pairing, which consists of plump medjool dates stuffed with diced chorizo and then wrapped in a strip of smoky bacon. The dish is served in a spicy-tart piquillo pepper-tomato sauce, a perfect foil to the flavors, and can thankfully be ordered in a small (2) or large (4) size. We weren't as impressed with the Poached Eggs, which were served on sourdough with 'nduja, a condiment made of spicy, soft pork sausage. Perhaps it was the preserved lemon hollandaise, which tread towards being too acidic, but the pairing of ingredients didn't seem as harmonious. There's also a dish listed as the ""Deluxe"" Focaccia, a dish that wound up being the equivalent of a flatbread pizza. The focaccia was a commendable texture, simultaneously crisp and doughy, and held a center layer of ricotta. There were a few herbs to add some freshness as well as the all-too familiar drizzle of truffle oil; while delicious, it became rather heavy towards the halfway point. In hindsight, it would be better to serve a smaller portion of it as an appetizer, as it would make a perfect starter for a group. We barely had room for the Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder, a hefty serving of tender pork served in a lentil stew with onions, brussels sprouts, raisins, and a few slices of apple. It was a delicious and well seasoned dish, and ideal for the colder months, especially as the pork shoulder had just the right ratio of lean to fatty meat. I have to commend Avec on delivering a strong dining experience, from the delicious and well-executed food to the thoughtful service. They were kind enough to let us linger after our meal as we tried to figure out our next course of action (limited in scope given the nature of Chicago winters), and if we hadn't had to board a plane that afternoon, I'd have been tempted to return that evening for dinner.",0.9968,0.841,0.144,0.015,0.5097085385878489

Quite perfect.  The paella was packed with flavor with sausage and shrimp and spiced just right. The pork was slow cooked, a generous portion with a delicious stew like presentation.  All were very good. I would come back for those dates alone. The wine list is varied but don't expect Napa Chards here.  Most of the wine (or maybe all of it) was from France and Spain and the server was more than happy to help me pick the perfect glass.  They also had some mixed drinks and beer, but it didn't seem like a full bar. Service here is very good. It's a small space and there are family style tables or a long bar. We sat at the bar and didn't want for anything.

WOW the snail boudin was delicious! I would suggest getting the half portion paella so that you can try other things from the menu. I really enjoyed the charred and fluffy, saucy rice parts that were seasoned so well.  Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder - I went for and half order as well and it was still an extremely generous portion served in its own crock pot along with lentils, roasted brussels sprouts, and apples.  The pork was tender and pulled apart effortlessly.  It was a bit salty for my likely but it seem to be a hit dish for others.

Perfect for date night -- just remember that you will be overhearing and be overheard, as people are seated directly next to you in communal tables. That being said, the food:  Chorizo-stuffed Medjool Dates: 4.5/5 -- Nothing special about the bread. Bacon dates themselves were juicy, filled with flavor, and drizzled in tomato sauce. Very well-made.  Walnut Pesto Pizza: 3/5 -- In retrospect should have gone with deluxe focaccia. This was actually recommended by the waitress, but we didn't take the advice. Instead, we sadly looked at our neighbors' plates when their focaccia arrived. It looked excellent.  Squid Ink Pasta: 5/5 -- By far the best part of the meal - never tasted a pasta like this.

2015-03-08,5.0,"Just when you think you've tried most of the best food that Chi Town has to offer........think again. I had heard great things about Avec so we gave it a try on a Thursday night.  The place was just jam packed and I could easily see why.  The ambience at this restaurant is just spectacular; it's almost like the food just comes along for the ride.  Well.....the food's not that bad either. The restaurant isn't for everyone; you are crammed into a really loud place with a whole bunch of people you don't know.  Say hello to communal dining in a really small restaurant.  If you don't like this kind of closeness, this is not the place for  you.  Our hostess told us to cram ourselves between several people already eating.  You find yourselves apologizing to folks who have to stop eating and get up to let you in.  Then you're apologizing profusely again as you somewhat get stuck trying to cram yourself onto one of the long benches.  Oh it was so much fun though. The rule of thumb is two small plates and a large plate for a table of two.  As we found out, even this can be way too much food. There's nothing else that can be said about the chorizo stuffed dates that already hasn't been.  An incredible combination of sweet, meaty, and spicy taste in a phenomenal sauce.  Note this is a ""small plate"" that really is closer to a ""large plate"".  There are four stuffed dates on a plate and you're pretty full afterwards but it is oh so worth every bite!! Even if you don't love cauliflower, you will love this dish on the small plates menu.  What gives it the utterly unique twist is the tabbouleh, freekeh, and the tahini.  It's light and flavorful. We ended our main courses with the full order of paella.  This is where the overload kicked in.  It doesn't say so on the menu but you can get a half order of paella and this is what we should have done.  The paella is fantastic and chock full of clams and tangerine aioli.  The only complaint was we would have preferred chicken breast in lieu of the dark meat on bone that is in this dish.  Needless to say a large portion of this dish ended up in a bag to take home.  Left-over paella tasted even better the next day.   Yes we were incredibly full but couldn't resist getting the warm chocolate bread pudding.  This didn't have the wow factor of dinner but perhaps because I'm not a huge fan of cherries.  It was a good finish nonetheless. The service is utterly cool.  Our waitress recomended one of the best white wines I've had in a long time - a portuguese blend MUX that was just superb.  It seemed to be a combination of sauvignon blanc and chardonnay and just out of this world.

2015-02-17,5.0,"We counted down the days until Valentine's Day, because we had decided it was the day we would finally go to Avec.  Per other reviewers' recommendations, we got there exactly at 4 pm and it was already PACKED. This was a V-Day anomaly, I believe. Either way, we decided to wait until a bar seat down by the kitchen opened up, which was definitely the right call. The hostesses, who were a bit stressed by the earlier-than-usual flood of people, were perfectly happy to accommodate us and we got the two specialty cocktails while we waited. Note that though there are only 3 cocktails listed on their menu, Avec will happily make you whatever you want. Our waiter made my boyfriend two unique and yummy whiskey cocktails, so just ask. If you're flying solo or with only one other person, I highly suggest waiting for a bar seat. At the tables, you'll be up close and personal with your fellow diners, but at the bar you'll have a bit more privacy and it'll be easier to hear one another. But, I should probably note that the bar has only backless stools (which is the reason my boyfriend's boss says she's ""too old"" for this place). ` Once we were seated, we ordered the octopus and OF COURSE the bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates. These were easily the most tasty dishes we ordered. Even writing about them 3 days later makes my mouth water. Did I mention that I don't eat meat? Well, at Avec I did. These are two must-have dishes--I don't care if you're vegan. Next we ordered Avec's famous focaccia and the half-plate paella with clams and confit chicken. Yes, you can do the half serving of paella even though it is not explicitly stated on the menu. The focaccia is massive but was a tad too salty for my taste. We ended up taking half of it home and, per our waiter's recommendation, ate it for breakfast topped with egg. We decided we probably should have skipped the focaccia for a whole order of paella, which was incredible. The chicken and seafood were perfectly cooked, the rice was moist and sticky, and we literally sat there scrapping the final bits out. However, if you're into salt, crunch, and truffle oil, then by all means, get the focaccia. Then was dessert. Though the bread pudding sounding incredible, we were stuffed so our waiter, the hero, suggested we get the homemade nutter butters. We also ordered the date gelato which was the special for the night. The nutter butters were the perfect little sweet thing for those who like chocolate, peanut butter, and crunch but who are stuffed, as you should be after eating at Avec. The gelato ended up being the most memorable dish of the night--creamy and sweet in your mouth and spicy in the back of your throat. It was a work of culinary art. Simple, interesting, beautiful, and deserving of every positive adjective in the English dictionary. If you haven't already been able to tell, our waiter was fantastic. Looking like an ex-frontman of an indie rock band, he was around when we needed him and not around when we didn't (which is great because I cannot stand hover waiters, especially when I'm trying to savor my meal i.e. eat really slowly) and all of his suggestions were on point.

They talked me into the date which they said was a specialty- it reminds me of Chicago deep dish pizza and not fine dining flavors. I wouldn't recommend. It also came in a super hot bowl that no one warned me about; I burned 3 fingertips. The chicken liver is beautiful and interesting but you can't eat much of it it is so rich. The Languedoc white wine was nice and presentation for everything was lovely. The salmon was pretty delectable. Crispy, seasoned and tangy. The one thing you should order.  It is a nice place for a drink but nothing about the ambiance makes me want to linger. The lights are too bright and it is chatty and clanky and a bit sterile.

So average 3 stars it is, even though I love the concept of the restaurant and the layout, decor and vibe. The service was also great and so friendly. But the food just didn't quite do it for me... We got the roasted cauliflower dish with radishes and olives and tahini but it didn't taste like much to me other than salt...The brussel sprout panzanella with raisins and cheese  also was on the salty side, and the octopus dish with beans was pretty good but not enough octopus and again still salty! We also got the chorizo stuffed dates that were wrapped in bacon which I loved since they were so rich and full of flavor but others at our table weren't as impressed but the pequillo pepper sauce we mopped up with their really really tasty bread they fire up in their oven. We also used more of that bread with the pork shoulder dish we got that included apples and lentils which was good and pretty flavorful but it didn't seem novel enough to me for such a trend setting restaurant. Their foccacia with talleggio cheese and truffle oil was so addicting though! And we ended with their nutter butters which also were some of the best nutter butter bites ever, so definitely a hit and miss meal for me, but still a great dining out choice that is more affordable than some of the other restaurants near here and we had a great small group dining experience here.",0.9949,0.782,0.178,0.04,0.5935483870967742

Tried out a few small plates and 1 one of Avec's larger plates. The focaccia bread with cheese is huge-mogous and completely wiped by trying to finish it. The cheese is soft, very flavorful, and there was a hint of truffle. I had high expectations for the chorizo-stuffed dates, but the star of the dish had to be the sauce (fantastic dish, if you are into the savory-sweet dishes).  I would recommend coming here for a happy hour with a few coworkers. When coming after work, a friend from Canada and I were immediately seated.

2015-01-09,5.0,"I have been here at least 7 times and find it to be consistently refreshing - brunch, dinner, and dessert. Every time I come, I have managed to get seating within 20 minutes. If I plan well, I don't even have to wait and get to sit comfortably without large crowds around me (tip: around 4pm for dinner, right at 10am for brunch, and after 9pm for late night dessert). I really do like their intimate communal setting which really perpetuates good vibes and good times (socially). I have a lot of favorites off their menu, so here goes. Medjool dates are a must-have for a first visit. Pork shoulder is ah-mazing (they did serve it with couscous about a year ago and I really loved that one). Focaccia has just the perfect flavor of truffle, however the portion is huge - it's either a take home or be-generous-to-your-dining-neighbor-and-share-because-that's-what-communal-tables-are-for  (I've experienced this a few times). The roasted whole fish is divine. I've usually only eaten steamed/roasted whole fishes asian-style, so this was definitely a nice change in spice and flavor. I tried the squid ink spaghetti with oysters one time and found it to be solid, but not a must. Great food keeps you interested throughout your dining experience, but this didn't occur with the squid ink. I would recommend ordering two small plates and one large plate to share between 2 people. Either that or one small plate and two large plates if you're feeling really hungry. I have no complaints with their service and found everything conducted very smoothly. Save room for dessert! I never leave Avec without ordering a sweet plate. Their menu changes often, so you may only have one chance to try what you see on the menu! With that being said, I still daydream about the lavender ice cream they had one time served with a stone fruits cobbler. Serious mouthgasm there. Street parking is pay-to-park and could be a hassle during rush hour times. Late night dining wouldn't be a problem, though, since I believe street parking is free after 9 or 10pm.

I came here for my birthday in September with a friend and had a wonderful waitress go over the wine list with us as we started out with a few starter plates. We had the chorizo stuffed medjool dates which is considered one of the top starter dishes to try and the charred corn tabbouleh. The charred corn tabbouleh was light and fresh.  A nice dish to start and not overwhelm your palate as you move into the chorizo stuffed medjool dates which is complemented nicely with a nice bottle of red wine.  We opted for a rioja since it would complement all the dishes that we would try out that evening. Afterwards, we had the braised lamp neck which was the highlight of the meal.  It was moist, succulent and flavorful.  It didn't give you that heavy feeling after you ate a long meal but it was enough to keep you satisfied. Based on this dinner, I knew I wanted to come back so a few months later, I read many reviews that brunch was also superb and came back with another friend who was in town for the holidays. My friend and I shared two dishes.  She was intrigued by the coddled egg with roasted mushrooms in  a fonduta cream sauce served with a crostini and I ordered the deluxe focaccia with taleggio cheese.  The fonduta was definitely delicious but who abhors cheese? The deluxe focaccia was also amazing and I could eat this endlessly.  Afterwards, my friend had coffee and I ordered a chocolate mocha chai.

2014-12-15,5.0,"pure ENERGY. Energetic atmosphere, engaging conversations, great food, good drinks all combined to make Avec one of the best dining experiences I've had.  EVER. SETTING:  Located in a very nondescript building, surely one would not think such a lively dining establishment would exist in such a place.  Approaching the first floor window, looking at all those conversing, laughing, eating and drinking, it's with the utmost certainty that you WILL want to join in the crowds for sure.  At least that's how I felt.   CHECK:  Coat check available as there isn't much space for coats, jackets, etc. within the seating areas. ENTER:  Though the restaurant looked extremely crowded, as the odds seem to be in or favor once more, the hostess informed us we could be seated right away.  And so, we we were seated at one of the many community tables, where six other people were already enjoying food, drink, and good conversation. NOTE:  No reservations.  We called ahead to determine when might be the best time to come down for dinner on a week night.  The advice we were given:  ""the earlier the better."" FOOD: *Chorizo stuffed medjool dates (with bacon and piquillo pepper tomato sauce):  This dish was quite delicious.  Sweet and spicy pair just right and provide a flavorful combination.  But beware, for those not accustomed to spicey, this dish has a definite ""kick"" for sure. *Whipped Brandade (with garlic bread and chives):  I absolutely loved this spread.  The whipped salt cod and olive oil finish well together, thus producing a strong dish.  *Slow roasted pork shoulder:  An extremely generous portion served in its own crock pot along with lentils, roasted brussels sprouts, and apples.  The pork is tender and shreds easily.  Mix the entire contents to combine the flavors.  Bon appétit! SERVICE:  Simply phenomenal.  I feel there are no words to truly describe the incredible service we received at Avec, but I'll do my best.  To start, the hostess was very polite and friendly.  She swiftly checked our coats and seated us.  Our (sadly her name escapes my memory) server was just amazing in terms of service and knowledge regarding the food and drink menus.  She definitely played a hand in helping us decide which wines to pair with our meal.  Throughout the evening, she checked on us periodically, engaged us in conversation, made sure the food and drink was satisfactory.  She gained our respect early on thanks to her extensive knowledge with the food menus and wine list, and definitely made our experience all the more enjoyable.  Overall, terrific customer service. SOCIAL:  The absence of social media was evident. Don't expect to see people on their phones checking Facebook or texting.  The food, drink, and conversation are the social aspects of Avec for sure.

Their Sunday brunch menu is fairly limited when it comes to dinner-like courses.  The brunch menu is comprised mostly of egg dishes and sweets like a wood oven baked French toast and a daily breakfast pastry.  Avec does feature one of their signature small plates (chorizo-stuffed and bacon wrapped medjool dates) and I started with them. The dates were very good.  The date was nicely sweet and was perfectly balanced by a crispy, salty and smoky wrapping of bacon as well as a moist, soft and spicy stuffing of chorizo.  The dates sat on a piquillo pepper-tomato sauce that provided a warm and comforting heat.  The dates also came with very good bread.  The bread was a freshly baked roll that had a crispy and chewy exterior and a soft and airy interior. I was hoping the rest of the courses would live up to those dates, but unfortunately they did not.  The hanger steak was served with bitter radicchio and saba as well as a fried egg.  The hanger steak was moist but too chewy and the beefy flavor was ruined by the too bitter radicchio and the saba, which was too vinegary, too acidic and too sour.  Hanger steak is a cheaper cut and is harder to cook and thus it tends to be chewier than a lot of steak cuts, but I have had much more satisfying preparations of hanger steak at Suzanne Goin's restaurants (Lucques, AOC and Tavern). I ended the brunch with a sweet note--their daily breakfast pastry, which was a salted caramel doughnut.  The doughnut looked great.  It had a sticky salted caramel glaze.  Unfortunately, it did not really taste like a doughnut.  Instead, it tasted like a dense dry bread or a bagel.  It was very bland too and there was too much bread to glaze. Service was very good as the staff was personable and the food came out at a quick pace. Prices were okay.  Almost everything on the menu was $15 and below and the small plates here were quite filling. Avec has a good design.  The room has a narrow and rectangular setup (like a rail train).  This setup along with the two doors to get into the restaurant give the dining room an exclusive feeling.  The room is simple but nice and contemporary with attractive light colored wood. The chorizo stuffed and bacon wrapped dates were very memorable and worthy of Avec's strong reputation.  Unfortunately, I found the rest of the food disappointing.  What I had though were more brunch-like items so maybe a return for dinner is needed to truly experience the best that Avec has to offer.

In LA, this is unheard of without an eye roll.  In our case, we walked in and were warmly welcomed by the host who offered us the menu to review before we committed.  It wasn't a hard sell as the menu here is deliciously unique and the vibe is sexy! Our server was promptly at our end of the communal table to offer up cocktails and some really good suggestions -- some off the menu, which I love.  I settled on a bourbon cocktail that went down nice and easy and my dining partner went with a moscow mule which was equally nice. We ordered a fab sounding salad that had currants and what tasted like indian spices - it was fantastic!  Then we had the chorizo stuffed dates -WOW - they have a kick!, but they are a wonderful combination of savory, sweet, and the textures and layers just melt in your mouth.  Our last item was a truffle oil focaccia that was crispy and savory and a little on the salty side, which I attribute to the cheese it had inside.  2 of us were not able to eat everything and we were STARVING when we arrived.  The portions aren't incredibly large, but the flavors and textures are so satisfying that you need not over order.

In conclusion, GO if you're in Chicago.  Prices were so reasonable as well (~$50 a head with wine, tax and tip).  I definitely plan to be back one day with a larger group so I can try more of their dishes.",0.9985,0.767,0.218,0.014,0.5177319902319902

2014-10-22,5.0,"I headed to Avec for a late Sunday brunch. When I arrived at 1.30, the place was still bustling with activity. Lucky for my friend and I, two spots in the bar opened up and we managed to grab them. We started out with the Atomium, which is a Belgian beer. If you are into beer (especially pale ale), I highly recommend it. It's flavorful and you can taste the grains. Personally, I love wheat beer - and wheat is one of the six grains in the beer. Unfortunately though, the server took a while to get our beer to us. After 10 minutes, we asked him about it and it slipped his mind. I suppose it's because he was pretty busy, so that was fine with us. We started out with the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. The dates were wrapped with bacon, served in a dish with piquillo pepper-tomato sauce. The dates do live up to the hype. It was such a flavorful dish, the saltiness of the bacon complemented the sweetness of the dates. It still amazes me that they found such huge dates. The sauce was slightly spicy, and provided a nice kick to the dish. I'll be dreaming of these dates until I return. Next, we had coddled egg with roasted mushrooms. This was topped with bitter greens. My favorite part of the dish was using the garlic crostini on the side (toasted and flavored to perfection) and scooping up the egg and the fonduta.  We finished the meal with the focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, herbs and most importantly, truffle oil. On my first bite, I thought the focaccia seemed a little plain. But after taking a few more bites, the truffle taste started growing and I was addicted to it. The focaccia was also well baked, it was thin and crunchy, but still held up the cheese.  I will definitely be returning to Avec! The food was very impressive, and I can't wait to try everything else on the menu!",0.9776,0.884,0.106,0.011,0.5876026272577997

The chorizo stuffed medjool dates live up to the hype.  Sweet paired with the right amount of spicy, porky goodness.  The accompanying piquillo pepper tomato sauce adds excellent acidity that perfectly balances the dish and accentuates the natural sweetness of the pork.    The brandade; near perfect.   Peppery olive oil adds a huge richness when whipped with the reconstituted salt cod.  A good dose of raw garlic adds a sulfuric finish that elevates the flavors.   For large plates, props to the slow roasted pork shoulder.   Served in its own ""crock"" over curried lentils, roasted young Brussels sprouts, dried apricots and apples, this is a winner.   The strong aroma of turmeric and curry spices perfumes the air long before you take the first bite.  The pork; juicy, fall apart tender with just the right amount of residual fat to balance the dish.  Shred the pork shoulder with a fork then mix the entire dish up.  The flavors complement each other perfectly. Short but very well chosen wine list focusing on France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.  There are NO wines from the US and rightfully so.  Reinvented, old world foods pairing with modern interpretations of old world wines.  Prices are fair with the average bottle at $40.

However, this turned out to be one of the worst experiences ever.  We had dinner reservations at Girl and The Goat later (which was amazing) but wanted to swing by Avec first for a drink and appetizer. It was 5 pm on a Thursday, thinking it would not be too busy. The restaurant was only 3/4 full and there were at least 10 open seats at the bar. The surly hostess informed us if we were not eating dinner, and only sharing small plates, we would have to be prepared to give up our seats at the bar for patrons planning on eating a full meal. I have dined at hundreds of fine upscale restaurants from San Francisco to New York to Paris and have never heard anything like this. So we took our chances and sat down at the bar. We were handed menus without a greeting, sat for at least  10 minutes before the bartender/ waitress came to take our order by her saying ""what do you want""? She didn't explain the menu, or ask if we had any questions. She was not very friendly. We ordered two glasses of wine a Portugese red and a Riojo, they were very good but pricey.   We also had the chorizo stuffed dates and I must say they were good. The sweet and spicy sauce they are prepared in is good as well.  We felt rushed however, eating quickly, for fear of getting ""kicked out"" of our seats. Interestingly, 4 seats at the bar remained empty the entire time we were there. Recently, my wife made the chorizo stuffed dates and duplicated them exactly. So I have to give Avec credit for ""inventing"" the recipe, however, that was the only thing going for them and we can have them at home now!",0.9684,0.813,0.123,0.063,0.579760640593974

The place itself is pretty small with limited seating. We waited about 10 mins for our table. Based off yelp reviews and pictures, we had an idea of what we wanted to order. But when we sat down and looked over their menu, almost everything was different. Almost all the dishes we wanted they weren't serving anymore. We were already disappointed from the start. We decided to go with the medjool dates, the pork shoulder and the lamb neck. The medjool dates were pretty good and decent sized. I've never seen dates that big before. The dates were a bit too sweet for my liking but the chorizo was delicious and that marinara sauce they have in there went perfect with the bread. We saw pictures of the pork shoulder served with clams, but even their pork shoulder was different. The pork shoulder was very tender from the slow roasting, but the seasonings they had made it taste very herbal and earthy. The lamb neck was also super tender and peeled right off the bone with no effort. However, the lamb neck was extremely gamey. Some people don't like the gamey taste of lamb. I usually love lamb but the gaminess definitely caught me off guard. I did eat it though, but it was the gamiest lamb I've ever had. Overall, the food was just below average to me. The style and taste of the food was just not to my liking despite the fact that each dish was cooked perfectly.  Our dishes were also pretty pricey.

2014-10-02,2.0,"I've been to Avec before and enjoyed it, but this last time I had an underwhelming and unpleasant experience ruined by the service and the inconsistent quality of the food. I think what you order will make a huge difference in your experience, as not all dishes here are created equal.  If you want to be safe, stick to the paella and the pork shoulder. I am a seafood lover and ordered the mussels. When we tasted the mussels, they had an unpleasant odor, as if they had been dead a while before being refrigerated.  When we told our server our concerns, she started to lecture us and went on and on about where they get their mussels from and how they import it and how it was impossible that it was unfresh, and that we ""could not get any fresher mussels in Chicago."" Well as a matter of fact we've ordered mussels at a dozen other places in Chicago, and none of them smelled the way these did-- unpleasantly unfresh. The server  was very unprofessional.  She even had the cook come over and taste the mussels in front of our face just to prove she was right. That basically ruined our whole experience at Avec and was uncalled for.  Then when we tried to seek out our server to order an additional dish, she kept her back turned to all the tables, sipping a wine at the counter while chatting to coworkers for a good five minutes without turning around. This was on a Saturday night with the place packed. Another dish we did not find up to par was the quail dish.  It was dry and tiny.  We asked if five people could share this dish and was told that it was an adequate size to share.  Unfortunately, the dish was so tiny that not all of us got to try a piece. The schwarma meatball was also mediocre.  Although the paella and pork shoulder were good, the inconsistent quality of the dishes overall and the unprofessional manner of the server was very disappointing.

The waiters are knowledgeable, and it's worth seeking their input before you order. In fact, one of the waiters talked me into ordering what is now my favorite item on Avec's brunch menu: coddled eggs (probably the best brunch food I've ever had). If you're going for dinner, I recommend the chorizo-stuffed dates, werp farm greens and whole roasted fish (the texture is like butter, and I mean that in the best way possible). Don't miss the nutter butters for dessert. If you're going for brunch, try a latte, the coddled eggs and the French toast. The eggs are silky and savory with an earthy quality from the mushrooms; they're everything you could want in a brunch dish.

To make it easier for everyone, it's best to order tapas style to share because the food will come in the order the tapas will typically come in. They struggled to bring our various items at similar times so sometimes one person had something and the rest of us watched lol. I enjoy the tapas-style of sharing, but I think they could have done a better job in working to get our orders in a timely fashion.  We went right when brunch started and it was empty. However, that changed so fast as it got packed very quickly! What I got: coddled eggs. Who would have thought that this would be so flavorful and delicious! It comes with roasted mushrooms, taleggio fonduta, bitter greens and garlic crostini. Considered a small plate but still very filling.  I then got the wood oven french toast which comes with some fresh cheese, meyer lemon curd, mint and almonds. It also had some jam that kind of looked like it was some sweetened tomato lol. It was an acquired taste. The syrup was a little bourboney. The flavors were so different but still veyr good. I also got to try the breakfast paella which has chicken confit, snail boudin, eggs and tangerine aioli. The snail boudin was surprisingly good haha. To be honest though, I preferred my first two dishes. These flavors were interesting but I think after eating the french toast, my palate wasn't ready for some chicken and snail.

As the food culture continues to grow west of Halsted it's good to remind yourself what's on the east side of the highway.

They don't take reservations, so I was afraid we'd have to wait a long time, but we got lucky and were able to be seated right away!  It's a pretty small restaurant, with one long narrow hallway of tables. Very minimal decor.  The 3 of us shared the following which was the perfect amount of food:  DRINK: PECHE SANGRIA. This was super light, pretty much like peach juice. I could barely taste the wine... CHORIZO-STUFFED MEDJOOL DATES w/ bacon: OMG!!! SOOOO GOOD!! Definitely the best thing on the menu! you MUST GET THIS!! It is perfection. I could have easily eaten a whole order of these by myself. This dish deserves 10 stars on its own. The most perfect blend of savory, sweet, crunchy, soft. YUM! Best dates dish of my life! WHIPPED BRANDADE w/ garlic bread & chives: my 2nd fave dish of the night! I highly recommend this one too! It's a fishy type of spread (salt cod + olive oil), and wow it is amazing when you eat it with the toasted garlic bread. So delish!!   BRUSCHETTA: I believe this is one of their seasonal items not always on the menu. I like bruschetta in general and this one was very good! The tomatoes tasted fresh. A good starter for sharing!  CHARRED CORN: this wasn't anything too special. If you like corn like I do, then you will like this dish. I think this is one of their seasonal items so they may not always have it.  SQUID AND CHORIZO: this was probably my least fave of the night, and also the least memorable for me. But if you're a fan of squid and squid ink, maybe you'll like this.  PORK SHOULDER w/ roasted carrots, olives, cous cous, mint, and ricotta salata. This one was also pretty forgettable for me. It was meaty and hearty, more of an entree dish. If you want some amazing pork dishes, go to Purple Pig to get it. At Avec, I'd suggest going with some of their other dishes. Pass on this one.  Overall one of the better dining destinations in Chicago! :) I would come back if I had the chance. Definitely recommend!!",0.9994,0.668,0.326,0.006,0.5870681605975724

We had to take some of the roasted pork shoulder back to the hotel. Had it for breakfast the next day and it was still crazy good. A few other standouts were the chorizo-stuffed dates, brandade, and house-marinated olives. We got the dates purely based on the unanimous Yelp reviews (didn't even question it) and once again, people were right! They should take these dates and feature them in the Contemporary section at the Art Institute of Chicago. Enough said. The pork shoulder was so tender and the portion was very generous. It was pure perfection. House-cured olives were amazing. Blew my mind. I didn't even realize how big of an olive fan I was (especially the bitter ones), until I had these ones. I should also mention two other things: 1) the ambiance was super laid back and casual, yet somehow classy at the same time. Pretty much everything is made of finished wood. 2) Their beer selection is superb, especially when it comes to local brews which you can only find in Chicago.",0.9804,0.833,0.144,0.023,0.5048617511520738

2014-09-07,1.0,"I came here last Sunday with a couple of out of town friends for brunch. We made sure to be one of the first ones there (got there at 10:15am) because we know how waits for brunch at these places in Chicago can be.  First off, this space is so poorly designed and cramped. Everyone gets seated at either communal tables or at the bar. Out party of four were seated at one of the communal tables. Throughout our meal we were constantly shuffling around or getting bumped into due to neighboring patrons that needed to use the bathroom, new patrons getting seated, baby strollers getting through the aisle, waiters moving around, etc. Hardly a relaxing way to dine.  Second of all, I'm pretty fed up with these trendy restaurants serving up ""tapas"" style meals meant to be shared. Our waiter had informed us of this, but it was clear by the way out table ordered that we wanted to order separately. What if someone just doesn't care to eat as much and would just like to have a small bite with the rest of the group? I would hope that my preference on sharing would be respected by my waiter. We had dishes ordered by separate people in our group to arrive at very different times, which obviously created very awkward moments of waiting for each other's dishes to arrive. Our waiter noticed us waiting for our dishes to arrive and again insisted on their establishment being ""meant to be shared."" I just don't get why they can't get over that we were ordering separately.  We waited and waited and waited. And the half order of paella came out as a full order. They reassured we'd only be charged for a half order. And we waited some more until we asked about our undelivered pizza for the third time. We asked to have the pizza canceled since by that time, I had been taking bites from my friends. They ended up packing up the pizza and comping it.  They food was pretty good, but it was the most unenjoyable meal I've had at this level of dining. I could never go back to avec or recommend it to anyone.",0.9914,0.852,0.128,0.02,0.48098049460118425

Somehow this place won a James Beard design award but I can't see it. Service: A little hit and miss. Some people got all their dishes at once, others got them one at a time and one never got theirs at all. You want to be clear in ordering how you want them to come out as it's tapas style. Food: Okay but nothing memorable. We went for brunch and it was probably a little heavy for that. In fact most dishes were pretty aggressively seasoned in general. We had the coddled eggs which was good, but unnecessarily had truffle oil added which destroyed the taste of the actual mushrooms in it. Worse was the focaccia which wasn't actually a focaccia (I was eating with a baker who was more than a little disappointed). This came with *loads* of truffle oil and garlic making it all but inedible.  Price: Pretty steep all things considered.

Me: New York foodie visiting Chicago for the weekend I've had my fair share of fantastic food in New York and was not expecting to be wowed by anything other than the famous Chicago deep dish. But after taking my first bite of the roasted salmon (small dish), I knew Avec would be one of the highlights of my trip. All the dishes I had were unique, flavorful, and well priced: - Roasted wild salmon (HIGHLY recommended) - Chorizo stuffed dates (HIGHLY recommended, dip the bread in the sauce) - Braised lamb neck (the most tender lamb, again... HIGHHHHLY recommended) - Wood oven paella with confit chicken (pretty good but I wouldn't recommend) - Slow roasted pork shoulder (very good, but kinda salty, maybe recommend..) You could buy bottles of wine (many choices) starting at ~$40, or glasses for ~$10, which may be considered pricey(?) in Chicago, but given the quality of the food, I think it'd only be fair to compliment the meal with some good red wine :) Very good portions for the large plates. I was with 5 dudes and 1 girl. There was so much meat in the dishes even the guys had trouble cleaning up ;o The total came out to be around $33 each including tip, tax, wine. This is a STEAL for how much food we had and the quality of service we got. PLUS at the end, the server was able to divide up the check 7 ways for our convenience... how often does that happen!?!?

The interior is really nice and modern, though a tad bit cramped. It's basically a long, narrow room with a bar to the entire left side when you walk in and tables to the right. It's also pretty loud. However, when we arrived at 12, there was no wait and we were seated immediately! The service was great! Our waiter we very helpful when it came to suggesting what to order! Since it was just two of us, he suggested either 2 small plates person or 2 small and a half order of 1 large plate. Also, every server in the restaurant was very attentive and was quick to fill an empty water glass.  Anyway, for food here's what we got: Medjool Dates (stuffed with chorizo sausage, wrapped in bacon, and served with piquillo pepper-tomato sauce and fresh bread): THESE WERE AMAAAAZING! We should have gotten another order! The bacon was perfectly cooked and it made for a savory bite of absolute deliciousness. mmmm still thinking about these.... French Toast 1/2 order (topped with jam, cream, mint, and almonds and served with maple syrup): Fantastic! The bread was more dense like a pound cake but was very moist and amazingly tasty! When paired with the maple syrup.... oh yeah. Heavenly. Coddled Eggs (topped with garlic cream, bitter greens, mushrooms, and fonduta; served with garlic crostini): Sooo great!

I saw a few tables ordering the breakfast pizza and oh man, if only I ate meat, I'd be all over that! My friend and I split a few dishes- coddled eggs with mushrooms and crostini, patatas bravas, and deluxe focaccia. Each came on a beautiful, thick wooden cutting board: 1.) Coddled Eggs- By far my favorite! The eggs are creamy, rich, and enhanced by the earthiness of the roasted mushrooms. Served on a crusty slice of bread, it was everything I wanted in a brunch dish 2.) Patatas Bravas- Incredibly crispy and accompanied by the best sauces (aioli and possible a romesco), they were spicy and delicious! 3.) Focaccia- Typically, I've seen focaccia baked about an inch thick. This was more akin to thin crust pizza between which was creamy ricotta and taleggio cheeses and the perfect hint of truffle oil. The top layer is cripsy from the oven and finished with a touch of sea salt. It was addicting.  Lastly, I finished my meal with a bourbon, cold brew cocktail.

Anyhow, yes, do get those even if they may be radioactive. I didn't think much of the focaccia. I thought it was excessively oily and not as good as it's hyped up to be.

I can't blame the crowd, either -- this brunch is pretty dreamy. If you're hesitant about ordering a bloody mary, just do it.

Second time, dates are still good, but not insanely omgoosh good and I am pretty sure I could make a decent facsimile with what is posted at NYT.  Then we had charred summer squash and shishito peppers.  For 12 dollars this was tiny and really underwhelming in the flavor department.  So many places are doing good vegetable dishes that Avec's attempt is a travesty. We tried a paella with chicken, sausage and mussels.  The chicken was moist and had a well seasoned skin, but everything else was bland, bland, bland.  Also where is the socarrat?  The crusty rice on the bottom is essential to a paella.  The mussels were pretty damn sad for the price too.  Lastly was the braised lamb neck.  Really tender meet with some marrow and nice accouterments of currants, carrots and herbs.  It and the dates were the only worthwhile things we ate.

2014-07-09,5.0,"We have a close friend in Chicago--shoutout to Monika S.--that swears by Avec as her favorite restaurant, so it almost seemed like a travesty wrapped in an enigma that the wife and I had never been. That has now been rectified. So in my Longman & Eagle review, I noted that L&E reminded me of Austin's Barley Swine, one of the best meals from the American (New), trendy-casual, no reservations, you'll wait and you'll like it school of restaurantery. Well, if I could combine L&E's gastronomically heightened food with Avec's uber-communal environment, you'd get Barley Swine to a T. Avec is close-quarters dining, a long stretch of eight-tops plus elevated bar seating, where you're squashed next to a fellow diner whether you know him or her or not. That means you get to be envious of their food and-or conversation and-or dining companion, unless you ordered better or are especially loquacious or brought a smokin' hottie. So if that's your bag, you'll dig Avec. If food is your primary reason for racking up dining rewards points on your credit card, then Avec has you covered too. It's more traditional--whatever that means when it's a Basque restaurant in Chicago--than innovative, but it's unmistakably delicious. The wife and I went with three dishes, though I surely could have ordered more based on description alone, if not for the cost and the stomach real estate. We started with the brandade, a delightfully creamy and delicious dish, and sort of an amalgam of the creaminess of Robuchon's mashed potatoes and the buttery fattiness of Le Comptoir's crazy good bone marrow. Yes, I just dropped Paris references, and now I hate myself for food snobbery. Our next dish, the summer squash, was a flavor-texture mishmash medley--smokiness from the charred squash, creaminess from the feta, spiciness from the shishito pepper (yes, I landed the coveted one in ten), crispy sweetness from the nuts, mintiness from the...mint. It's a fantastic summertime vegetarian dish. We ended with the way too big paella. My wife was very hesitant as it comes with snail boudin, while I fancied how the sausages were sneakily shaped as large escargot. My take is that it was boudin blanc, but I can't fully verify. The paella's chicken was hit-or-miss, as some parts were tasty while others dry. I really enjoyed the charred rice, while my wife liked the fluffy, saucy parts. That got along amiably with the dish. By then, we were too full for dessert or anything else. If anything, a party of four would have been perfect for small plates sharing, so long as you get to Avec at an unreasonable hour in order to avoid an unreasonable wait.

2014-07-09,4.0,"Solid food, good ambiance, not pretentious, and well priced. So how can I describe Avec that the reader gets the best idea: - corner location in West Loop, very close from the Central Loop, - located in a row of many restaurants, - fairly small (by Chicago standards) but decent size (by, say NYC standards), - lots of communal tables, - open fire kitchen that you can observe (can get hot), - tapas style food. Had dinner with a small party and had about 6 or 7 dishes, which were a selection of large and small dishes.  Overall, I thought food was good.  It is not going to shatter your tastes, but it is fairly good, decently flavorful, a bit greasy, a bit saucy at times, just like tapas ought to be. We ordered: - squid and chorizo with pasta and black ink, - chorizo and dates wrapped wrapped with smokey bacon, - salmon small plate, - steak with blue cheese, - cheese filled flat bread. (maybe some more I don't remember). Squid and chorizo was good, but the black ink gave a taste I did not prefer.  Chorizo and dates were excellent: just the right combination of savory.  Salmon was not my favorite, as it was completely uncooked, and was not even soft.  I think preparation can be much better, even in a home kitchen. Steak with blue cheese was good.  Flat bread was very simple, probably could have gone without it. Drinks were excellent: we ordered the verde flight which was excellent and good value, and a couple of beers, which were excellent. Overall, for 3 people, total of $130 with tax and tip, for good amount of selection of dinner food was great.  Will probably return to try more dishes.",0.9964,0.763,0.213,0.024,0.5050793650793651

Contrary to what we expected, when we arrived around 6pm on a Saturday, there was NO WAIT.  We even had our choice between a table and the bar (we chose the latter to be in front of the kitchen). We were greeted by the sommelier of the restaurant, who after hearing this was our first time there, gave us the background behind the restaurant, the cuisine and the wine.  Having read the reviews (and confirmed with the sommelier), we ordered the dates, the foccacia and the whole fish of the day. The dates - there is no reason to even both reviewing these given the others' praise.  Get them.  In fact, consider getting them again, for dessert...  they're that good. The foccacia - this was a surprise.  Definitely one of the more unique plates I've had (warning, it's a lot of food for just bread/cheese), and I found it to be an incredible accompaniment to the two bottles of wine we went with (both rose's for once on a whim - both reasonably priced). The fish - this is one of the best whole fish preparations I've ever had.  The fish itself wasn't greasy at all and it had a great accompaniment of greens that balanced it well. At no point during the entire meal did we feel rushed.  In fact, after ordering dessert (cobbler - which was also good), we ended up ordering coffee and a second round of dessert (nutter butters - which were some of the best small bites I've ever had for a dessert). Overall, for the quality of the food, the atmosphere and the service, I couldn't believe how reasonable our bill was at the end of the meal.  There are very few restaurants I frequent more than once a year...  this may be one of them.",0.9904,0.844,0.126,0.03,0.49729390681003593

Spiced Lebnah Cheese with Roasted Apricots, Cilantro, Green Almonds, and Flatbread - $14.  A very flavorful cheese that is mixed with a wonderful salad of apricots, cilantro, and almonds.  It's a very Mediterranean dish and has those signature flavors.   Hand Cut Pappardelle Pasta with Mushroom Bolognese, Madeira, and Crescenza Cheese - $18.  Super fresh pasta cooked perfectly al dente.  The mushroom sauce is amazing as is the piece of soft cheese on top.  A wonderful dish. Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder with Pocha Beans, Cider Braised Chorizo, and Clams - $24.  We actually ordered the wood oven paella, but they accidentally brought this instead.  I didn't say anything as I had been eyeing the clams and pork shoulder dish of a nearby dining patron and actually wanted to try some.  It's great.  The pork shoulder is super tender.  The clams are flavorful and well seasoned.  You mix the thing together and the beans and sausage just add to the mix.  It's almost TOO flavorful.  I almost wish I had some white rice to pair with it.  But very good.  A very generous portion too.  We couldn't finish it. Overall, we had a great meal at Avec.  Top notch drinks and some very great food.  The waitresses recommendations of how many dishes to order was spot on and the tapas style allows the sampling of many different flavors.  If there was one criticism, it's that I personally found the communal table and loudness much but I can see how the trendy crowd loves it.  As for the inability to make reservations, with advance planning, it wasn't too much an issue, even at a prime dining hour.   Avec takes credit cards, including American Express.",0.9968,0.822,0.155,0.024,0.5286292709174067

The list was great because they had several more inexpensive bottles in the 30's range. Great if you want a bottle but aren't looking for something incredible (and expensive). We ordered a French pinot noir for around $35---solid choice! -Server. Our server was helpful and there when we needed to order more The not so good: -Expediters. So we ordered 3 or 4 plates total. The first was the aforementioned dates, which comes in a red marinara sauce. We expected to receive new, clean plates after. Sadly, the rest of our food was shoved to the side of the dirtied plates as to avoid the red sauce. After our last small plate, an expediter asked if we wanted new plates. Kind of funny.  -Food. Beyond the dates, the other food was just okay. Everything sounded great on paper, but just didn't blow me away.  -Price. Fairly pricey for small plates to begin with. Couple that with small portions for a small plate, it didn't make me want to return. There are far too many other small plate/tapas restaurants in the city that are better and a little cheaper. We actually left Avec a tad bit hungry! Overall I would say it's just underwhelming. Perhaps we ordered the wrong small plates. Perhaps we should have gotten one small plate and one big plate.

Half of the dishes we tried were delicious: the chicken liver crostini and the dates are a must-have. Especially the dates, they're a perfect mix of sweet, savory and spicy. On the other hand, half of the dishes were quite disappointing: the mixed greens were basically a salad with potatoes and olive. Fresh and crispy, sure, but not exactly restaurant-level, right? We also had the salmon, the squid with chorizo casserole and the pork shoulder. I did not like these dishes. The salmon was served with a tomato/beetroot puree that completely overpowered it. Similarly, the squid disappeared in a stormy sea of flavors: orange, cinnamon, beans, chorizo... too much. The pork shoulder was very tender but tasted too much of vinegar in my opinion --- I have to say I am not a fan of sour mains. Plus basically no veggies with it (coriander does not count, right?). Fortunately, as a finale we ordered the Affogato with pistachios for dessert. That was truly delicious, we literally fought over the last spoonful!

The cuisine is quite eclectic, but I'd describe it as a contemporary Mediterranean. Combining elements of French, Spain, & North Africa cuisine complemented by a solid wine selection.   Avec is one of those rare restaurants where the small plates aren't small...they're hearty. Their large plates (or entrees) are even bigger, so fair warning.  For a party of 2 we ordered 2 small plates and shared 1 entree and we both were stuffed and had to bring some home. So try not to over order (which is difficult b/c everything looks delicious). It seemed liked every table ordered the Chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped medjool dates (as did I) -- so that appears to be their signature dish -- and it was worth the hype.  We also ordered an evening's special which was prosciutto, some type of amazing cheese, strawberries and lavender. It was my favorite dish, so definitely don't forget to check their special chalkboard to see if something tickles your fancy.  For the entree we got the paella, which was also incredible. Overall the dishes are very meat-centric (or maybe my ordering was!) but after 3 plates including chorizo, bacon, prosciutto, mussels, chicken, and sausage....I was feeling a little sluggish.  Next time I go back I'll make sure that one dish is at least salad/veggie oriented.  Go to Avec.

When I lived in Chicago, it was the place I would lumber in to, escaping the brutal cold with an eclectic wine list and food that is a powerful combination of delicious and creative. The offerings here and comfy without being hokey and small plates and half orders give you a chance to sample a nice variety of flavours, making Avec great for one or four. (I'd caution about large groups here--Avec is painfully small and does not take reservations. I have been successful dining alone or with one other in not having to wait terribly long for a table, but given the layout of the restaurant, bigger parties might not be so fortunate.) Avec is a wine-forward restaurant, which is not to denigrate their mixologists but to say that they have an impressive collection of wines that far surpass its size and price point. You can easily find many unique and unconventional bottles or pours without breaking the bank. Waitstaff are impressively polished on the ins-and-outs of the expansive wine offerings. When it comes to food, Avec's small plates (and the ability to order many dishes in half portions) means that the menu can be quite flexible. I generally find two of the smaller dishes and a larger plate is plenty of food for two hungry eaters but you can easily tack on more or less as the meal progresses. Like the rest of the Blackbird group (Pubican, Big Star, Blackbird, Violet Hour) the menu is constantly changing but some things are fixtures--the brandade, the dates, the focaccia, and the pasta. All of these are excellent and show off how capable this kitchen is, but I'll save my plug for the dates. I don't even like dates! Stuffed with chorizo and in a homemade tomato sauce and served with crusty bread, this is satisfying plain and simple. I have ventured in to Avec on my way out of town just to get my fill of those dates. They are the must-have on the menu, and you can try them in a half order (2), if you remain unconvinced. Deserts can get fancy and yes are quite good, but I like to keep it simple: a good Intelligentsia cappuccino and an order of nutter butters, four squares of peanut butter and salted caramel.

2014-06-02,4.0,"My visit was short and sweet so I'll make my review the same. I was having dinner down the street at Maude's liquor bar and stopped in for a quick drink beforehand.  I had heard great things about Avec (foodwise), and I figured i'd have to wait to get a table.  Surprisingly, I didn't.  I was seated quickly (it was 5pm on a Friday), and given drink menus (food too, but we weren't doing food).  The drinks seemed interesting, but once I had them, the prices were a bit steep...I feel like I've had much better cocktails at other places for the same price so it was a little disappointing. The service was wonderful, and I don't regret dropping in - I'd go back for the food (judging from the tables around me) - the drinks: not so muuch",0.9614,0.792,0.171,0.037,0.45711805555555557
2014-05-28,4.0,"This past Monday, my two friends (Will & Susannah) and I ventured to Avec, a Mediterranean small plates restaurant owned by the same management as Blackbird. The restaurant is very small in square-feet but quaint nonetheless. Wood paneling in the interior creates a rather cozy vibe and the tables are seated in close groups where you may share a table with complete strangers. The small size of the dining room allows for intimate conversations with good friends.  If you take a date here, I recommend you make sure there are no better-looking, eligible bachelors/bachelorettes at the table you are about to be seated at...  Haha.  Now for the food.  All the reviews I came across before the meal were raving descriptions of the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. I am happy to report that they are indeed phenomenal. The dates are wrapped in savory bacon and served in zesty tomato sauce. Even Susannah, who doesn't particularly care for dates, enjoyed them. A must-order at this restaurant.  The octopus plate was crisp and refreshing. Combining the seafood flavors with ruby red grapefruit and fresh mint provided a sharp, citrusy taste to an otherwise stereotypical roasting of octopus. The plate was very well prepared and is a definite order for any octopus-fanatic. The squid plate was also fantastic. The squid and tripe with fideo pasta was interesting and unique. Until this plate, I had never tasted squid ink aioli. I am happy to report that it is delicious and I definitely recommend it to the culinary adventurous individual. Steering away from the seafood and onto the red meat, the Butcher's steak was paired perfectly with the strong flavor of blue cheese crumbles. The crisp kale decoration added a necessary crunch to the plate as well as a green element to an otherwise meaty dish. The incorporation of pistachios on the Merguez sausage pizza brought a contrasting texture to the softness of the melted feta cheese adorning the pizza and the aroma filled the restaurant, attracting the attention of many nearby diners.  My favorite large plate was the wood oven paella which combined the delicious flavors of chicken, seafood and a hint of fruit into a single dish. The paella was cooked perfectly and provided a background to the various ingredients namely the mussels and the chicken pieces, both of which were lightly flavored with citrus. The perfect large plate to share for a group that cannot decide between poultry and seafood. It gives you both! For dessert, we ordered a selection of options but my favorite was the chocolate-ricotta mousse. It ws topped with crushed raspberries which provided a fantastic compliment to the richness of the mousse. I am typically adverse to whipped cream but the orlorosso whipped cream added a creaminess to the chocolate-ricotta mousse that I would have missed if I had simply spooned it out. So delicious it's borderline dangerous.  Small plates are amazing. They allow diners to share and try multiple dishes, bringing friends together through shared culinary experiences.

The foccacia bread with cheese and truffle oil is a must! the nice crunch with cheese that oozes out in the center makes it addicting to eat and the truffle oil with every bite is a nice touch.

2014-05-01,5.0,"OMG this was so good. From top to bottom, just awesome. That's the 2 sentence review for those who don't want to read any further. For those of you trying to sleep, I offer you the following long-winded review.  To start, we got there and there was a 30 minute wait so we put our name in and went for a quick walk. 10 minutes later we walk in and suddenly we have a seat. Both people working there that we talked to were super nice, very friendly even though the place was jam packed. We ended up sitting at a table of 10, which consisted of 4 groups - 3, 2, 2, and 3, with the 3s at the ends and the 2s in the middle. So we ended up talking to the other 2 (we were 1) and one of the 3s. Both parties were very friendly, and made the experience better than it would have been otherwise. Yes I know this is luck of the draw and has nothing to do with Avec itself, but it counts. As they say, lucky  beats good.  The waiter, a friendly guy, suggested a bottle of wine that was dirt cheap (well, by comparison with the others) and was very smooth. Something from France, merlot/cab/malbec combo I think. Anyway, wine good, service good,  The food, in order of appearance... 1. Brussels sprout panzanella. We got this because Andy knows I like brussels sprouts and we wanted to give it a shot. It was fine, good and all. But of the 5 things we got this was the least impressive of them all. For me, and Andy agreed, it really had no core taste of the sprouts. Brussels have a very distinct taste, which I like. It seems like they did all they could to remove that taste and just use the sprouts as a color, more than a flavor. Fine, but I would not get it again, really.  2. Werp farm greens. Of the things we got, this was the one I was expecting the least from. But once it hit the fork and my fork hit my mouth, wow. Just wow. This was possibly the best salad I've ever had. The combination of greens, dressing, mini potatoes, and peas was just lights out. I think maybe this is just right up my alley because I couldn't get enough of it;. Every bite was fantastic.  3a. Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. This came with the Focaccia, thus 3a and 3b. When we sat down to order, the waiter told us this was their signature dish. When the people to our right then proceeded to have it placed on the table in front of them, that more or less sealed the deal. It just looked & smelled stupendously good. And it came with a small hunk of bread that looked perfect. We each got 2 of these since the dish came with 4 pieces. They were good, succulent, dates filled with chorizo and wrapped in bacon. Yes, this does sound incredibly overindulgent in a typical American way, but they were actually most excellent.  3b. Focaccia. This too is apparently a signature dish and is always served with the dates above. The people next to us had gotten this, and they dipped the focaccia pieces in the sauce that came with the dates. This was good, and had a hint of truffle oil that gave it such a sweet, yummy aroma that I was forced to cram every last piece of this massive dish into my mouth by the end of the night. It was worth every single bite. 4. Chicken liver crostini. Yes, by this time I was stuffed and had absolutely no need to eat anything else. But this dish is effectively fois gras with bread (did I mention the bread was awesome? No? Well, it was) and some other stuff that I put on top and crammed into my mouth. You know, no matter how full you are, when the dish comes out and it's fois gras, how do you let that go? We were in the hotel for the night so it's not like we were going to bring it back with it. We did it, forced ourselves to eat it, and it was very good. I don't think this was ""holy cow"" amazing. It was good, not great. I'd order something else next time.  Ok, that's enough. If you're not asleep by now, at least pencil in your trip to go here. it's worth it, every last incredibly over-indulgent bite.",0.9993,0.762,0.2,0.037,0.5259916073709177

Burrata: A+ = crack I have no idea what they put in this thing, but whatever it was, I want more & I want it now.  The mixture of flavors with the smooth, creamy burrata.... OMG 6. Charred octy: C Meh. The only thing I was a little saddened by.  Octy is my all time favorite.  This was kind of ordinary.   And we only got two small leg pieces.  Ouch.   7. Hangar Steak: A+ The hint of salty anchovy really brought out the steak.   8. Paella: A Don't normally like paella in the US, but the other ladies wanted it.  And it was goooood.  Had the right amt of crunchy rice bits, all different flavorful tender meats/seafood that maintained it's own flavor but still complimented the rice.  Yum.   9.

Mmmmm delish!  My only gripe is that it's rather large for 2 ppl and half the portion would have been better so we could fill our tummies with more goodies.  We also had the Brussel sprouts slaw salad, chorizo wrapped w/ dates and octopus. The octopus was tender and tasty but didn't seem to have enough pieces in the dish.

The place is smaller than a normal restaurant so when it's busy (which is always) it can be a little bit hard to navigate through the little space between tables and the bar seating.  Nonetheless, it didn't change my opinion of this place's delicious food :)   Definitely one of my favorite places in Chicago along with Blackbird which is it's neighbor (literally).

Probably because I remembered how crazy crowded it was: had to leave early last time to avoid the wait (hope my boss isn't reading this).  This time I came for brunch, which wasn't very crowded at all, though I was a bit annoyed by the hostess who refused to seat us before our final guest arrived, so the 3 of us huddled by the limited space near the entrance in everybody's way for a good 20 minutes, watching the tables rapidly filling up.  They were doing special collaboration brunches, and the day we went it was with CH distillery, so there were a few special cocktails. Since it was too early for me to drink, I skipped the drinks and went for the coffee, girlfriends enjoyed their drinks though. We ordered whitefish spread, coddled eggs, brussel sprouts panzanella, moroccan berghir pancakes and breakfast paella (yes, we were hungry gals!). I thought the whitefish spread was nice in flavors but a bit too thick, panzanella was flavorful but a tad garlic-heavy for brunch. Loved the coddled eggs so much I want to bathe in it, and the spices on the chicken wings that came with the pancakes made me want to move to the next table (although the wings were nice & juicy). We noticed the group next to us also order the paella and left most of it intact when they left, so we were a bit worried. But it turned out to be lovely: strong saffron flavors in the perfectly cooked rice, juicy chicken pieces & duck sausages. Only wish they gave us more bread with each of the small plates but they didn't refuse when we asked for more, so no problem.

2014-02-28,5.0,"Honestly top three restaurant experiences I have ever had in my entire life. Probably the best I have ever had in Chicago. The only downsides to this place is the wait (which is most certainly worth it) and the fact that it's on the smaller side. Came here with a party of 6 and we were told an hour and a half wait. The hostess was awesome and told us about CH distillery which is right down the street and has lots of great cocktails and much more space. We went there while we waited and the hostess said we would get a text when our table was ready. After drinking a tasty cocktail over there we returned and only waited about 10 minutes until our table was ready. This is where things got good. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table (one of the cheaper reds) and it was good and complimented the food very well. It was also suggested to us by the sommelier/waitress who knew the most about the wines. Food wise we ordered the following, Large Plates: 1. wood-fired pizza with PQM pancetta, pear, blue cheese panna and arugula 2. slow roasted pork shoulder with clams, braised greens, potato and linguica sausage 3. ""deluxe"" focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, truffle oil and fresh herbs 4. whole roasted fish with olives, fennel, arugula, charred orange and lavender vinaigrette Small Plates: 1. whipped brandade with garlic bread and chives 2. chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce We got a double order of each small plate. The fact that they do small plates and large plates is great. It was perfect for sharing and if you're there by yourself or with just one person a large plate is a great amount for one person. Everything here was crazy amazing and my taste buds and my brain still can't fully comprehend how they made some of this stuff taste so good. The only thing that I wouldn't order again but was still tasty was the Large Plate #3. It was a lot simpler than the other dishes and didn't pack as much flavor and was a tad bit bitter. I would love to try some more of their menu (even though I'm at least half way through it) and I would HIGHLY recommend the chorizo stuffed & bacon wrapped dates and the slow roasted pork shoulder. The dates melt in your mouth and go through three stages of delicious flavor and two stages of meat. The pork shoulder is slow roasted all together with the other ingredients in a deep metal dish and the flavors blend perfectly and everything just falls off the bone.

Everything -- and I do mean everything -- caused ""wows"" and expressions of delight at our table. First, we began with the obligatory bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates in red sauce, and they truly are obligatory. My favorite new dish I think. Next came the foccacio bread with truffle oil and cheese, fresh mushroom homemade pasta, and the short rib. Let's stop right there on the short rib. I'm not a big fan of stringy meats like short rib and roast, but this dish changed my mind. I was expecting a hunk of stringy meat in a sauce or gravy on my plate. Instead, a black kettle pot arrived at our table with the short rib inside, topped with bread stuffing that was so good it was Thanksgiving, and apples on top. There were three of us, and we could not even finish it. When you consider that a dish is $25 or so and easily feeds a whole table, that's not a bad deal at all. The meat was tender, juicy and perfect in presentation. We arrived just after 6 pm without a reservation. We were seated immediately, the server was incredibly friendly, and the food descended on our table like bread from heaven almost immediately after we ordered.

2014-01-07,5.0,"We got here early and were sat immediately. Chorizo stuffed dates - These are awesome.  The sweetness of the dates perfectly complement the chorizo stuffing.  When I had originally read about it on the menu, the dish seemed heavy.  I was surprised when the chorizo came out shredded, almost like the consistency of good pulled pork.  To top it off, the sauce is great with the bread that they serve. Ricotta flatbread - Not much of a looker but I found it to be a great light snack.  The tiny hint of truffle oil didn't overpower the dish at all. Pork Shoulder - A little disappointed with this dish, I found it to be a extra-sweet version of a classic cantonese braised pork belly with not quite as much balance in the flavors. Papperdelle - Expertly made pasta but the flavor was not too memorable.  Pine nuts really saved this dish.",0.9463,0.794,0.164,0.042,0.5929824561403508

2014-01-03,5.0,The review will be brief because it's all been said before by others.  This place is my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  It feels more like a NYC restaurant than Chicago due to the small size and close communal seating.  They don't take reservations and the wait can be long during peak times.  You're best going on the weeknights (before 6pm or after 9pm).  Everything on the menu is great and items are continuously being updated on the menu...but the amazing dates will always be there.  Great beer and wine selection.,0.9719,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5708333333333333

Pork shoulder- actually this dish is what I am craving for when I decided to go here. But finally I just feel fine... I mean, not bad, but not really impressive. I hope the meat can melt in my mouth but actually no. By the way, the portion of this dish is really big, share with someone or order half portion.

2013-12-04,5.0,"I was already distraught about the fact that it had taken me so long to get myself in here and after dining at Avec for the first time I was really kicking myself for not visiting sooner! From here on out I will definitely be making up for all that missed time without this amazing food in my life! It was a Tuesday night and as the snow fell outside, this tiny space on Chicago's Near West Side was bursting at the seams with energy. Conversation and laughter filled the restaurant as wine flowed and food was savored, all to the soundtrack of Biggie Smalls playing in the background...what's not to love?! Being the tiny space that it is, along with their no reservation policy, Avec is usually a fairly crowded spot any night of the week. When we arrived there were a few seats open at the bar, so my two dining partners and I snagged those up and settled in. For a group of 1-3 the bar works fine, I usually prefer the bar if it's just me or me and one other person because I love chatting with the bartenders and getting their opinion on what to order. Avec has a variety of small and large plates that are all perfect for sharing-my favorite way to go! Their menu is filled with Mediterranean classics, pulling from regions of France, Portugal, Italy, and the coast of Spain. The twist? A Midwestern interpretation that makes these dishes interesting and comforting at the same time. We perused the menu over a lovely plate of house-marinated olives...the perfect first bites to give us a taste of what was in store. Our first dish was the Brandade. No idea what brandade is? Neither did I. Per Wikipedia, Brandade is an emulsion of salt cod and olive oil eaten in winter with bread or potatoes. It was delicious....and now I know that I love brandade! We also ordered their much-loved Chorizo-Stuffed Medjool Dates and as soon as that first bite hit my tastebuds, I knew that this dish was the winner of the night. The spicy kick from the chorizo and pepper sauce combined with the slight sweetness of the dates and the saltiness of the bacon is a PERFECT combination! As hard as it was to follow the dates, we thoroughly enjoyed our next few dishes as well-charcuterie and cheese boards and the refreshing brussels sprout panzanella to round out the meal. The brussels sprout salad was really fantastic-if you think you don't like brussels sprouts...I challenge you to try this salad and see if you feel a little different about these mini cabbages afterwards! Luckily my friend that I dined with had been to Avec a time or two. Even though we were happily full at this point, he let us know that Avec's version of the Nutter Butter was not to be missed. After quickly polishing off the four pieces in our first order,  he and I exchanged glances and knew that a second order was going to be needed! You definitely do not want to miss these...and I guarantee that you can't eat just one! Bottom line: if you haven't been to Avec, get there! If you've been but haven't tried some of the above items, heck, even if you have...get back!",0.9816,0.885,0.089,0.027,0.49484126984126986

Wine is a must here guys. Really. It really really accentuates your dish (and the food can kind of be oily sometimes so the wine washes it down really well!) It's not even that expensive - $11 for enough to refill your glass about 3 times. (note that the order of the foods listed is the order it came it - very important) chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce - this is a must. Seriously, if you come to avec and NOT get this dish, that means you came here too many times that you no longer crave the perfect combination of sweet, spicy, savory, salty, amazingness in one dish. It means you live a good life and don't have to endulge in this perfect dish. ""deluxe"" focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, truffle oil and fresh herbs - Last time I came here, the focaccia came as the LAST dish - I thought that worked better than having it as the 2nd dish because this ""large plate"" is more like a dessert plate or appetizer. So starting with it or ending with it should be better, because the focaccia is like eating a really savory biscuit with pungent scent of truffle oil, so having it in the middle of the meal was a little strange, but regardless GREAT. If you like the scent of truffles, this dish will not disappoint you. Random fun fact - did you know truffle oil isn't made out of truffles? Cool. Oyster mushrooms with roasted artichokes, goat feta, endive and black garlic vinaigrette - Maybe Avec DID purposely give us the focaccia 2nd just so they could give us this dish afterwards. The focaccia was very buttery and oily so this oyster mushroom ""salad"" was PERFECT. Perfect addition of greens and vinaigrette to cleanse our mouth. And the oyster mushrooms! I've never had it yet, but WOW. SO SAVORY AND SO GOOD. Who ever said mushrooms had no taste? Try this try this try this. Burnt wheat pasta with mussels, broccoli, and 'nduja butter - SAD FACE :( I was so disappointed by this dish...We originally wanted the squid ink pasta, but they didn't have it on the menu anymore so we opted for THIS pasta. I mean, ""burnt wheat pasta"" + ""mussels"" sound great, right? Hmm...I wasn't too pleased. The pasta was indeed very peculiar - they looked like (dont google this if youre going to order this. really, dont.) mermithidae.....And the pasta has a HOLE in the middle! how cool?! I don't know...the pasta definitely tasted undercooked, but that's probably because of the ""burnt"" and ""wheat"" part...anyways, it just didn't satisfy me, and definitely made me a little sad because it was the last dish... Dessert - I cant find the name on the online menu! But it was basically an apple pie with cinnamon ice cream and caramel. Very very very delicious and the flaky layers of the pie was so great. Not dry at ALL and the ice cream was wonderful. Came here at 5:45 on a SATURDAY night, three people, waited about 40 minutes.",0.9967,0.779,0.16,0.062,0.5529334554334554

I would've given more stars for just the food alone, which was excellent.  The focaccia bread was delicious btw.",0.8045,0.829,0.099,0.073,0.43586545729402865

2013-10-16,5.0,"Though I would more so rate this place 4 stars than 5, Avec gets 5 stars from me JUST for their amazingly delicious heavenly chorizo-stuffed dates.  I came here with my friend that I was visiting in Chicago, and this was one of the restaurants on our must-go list. With reviews always talking about how long the line is and how this place doesn't take reservation, we decided to come here early at around 4:30 on a Friday afternoon. When we got there, half the restaurant was empty so we got seated right away.  What we got:  Chorizo-Stuffed Dates: heaven on earth. Literally. If i could eat this forever, I would. I would also probably come here JUST for this. Yes, I would fly 4-5 hours from SoCal to Chicago and take the EL train to Avec JUST FOR THIS.....if i had the money to, that is. If you don't get this dish here, you're completely out of your mind. Originally, I was scared that it'd be too salty because the dates are stuffed with chorizo (which is already a saltier type of meat) but it's ALSO wrapped in bacon (which is also on the salty side), but the dates were sweet enough to counter balance that and the tomato based sauce that the dates came with was rich and spicy enough to just balance everything together. The sauce was so good, if I had extra bread, I probably would've cleaned the plate.  Shrimp: My friend ordered this, and I didn't have any of this, but the shrimps looked like a good portion and my  friend seemed to enjoy it.  Burnt Flour Pasta: This was meh. There wasn't much to it, the pasta was kind of oily from all the butter, no outstanding flavors, and the pasta just tasted like whole wheat.  Pork Shoulder: This was also really good. The pork shoulder was pretty soft and moist for the most part and I liked how they used clams and rice to counter balance the rich flavors and the rice really soaked up all the flavors of both the pork and clams, which I enjoyed. The portion is really big so it's worth the $21, but I was literally bursting by the end of the meal. The only part I didn't like about the dish was this weird yellow mustard-y sauce they put on top of the pork. I could've done without it and I personally think it would've tasted much better without it, but again, that's just me.  The only complaint I have about this restaurant is that the service kind of sucked. I understand slow and inattentive service if the restaurant was really busy and packed, but at the time we went, it was pretty empty, so they had no excuse for that.",0.9977,0.774,0.184,0.042,0.5386387163561076

2013-10-08,4.0,"Short version: Dishes can be slightly hit or miss - some were very delicious, while others were good but not worth ordering again. Service was decent. Prices aren't cheap but I wouldn't say it was particularly overpriced, at least for a restaurant of this tier.  Long version: This place has been sitting in my bookmarks page for a while, and I finally got my butt over there a few days ago with a friend. Since they don't take reservations and it was a Friday, we got there early (4:30 pm) to avoid a wait. We ordered: - Chorizo stuffed medjool dates: My friend ordered these and said she loved them. I didn't try the dates, but I did try the sauce, which was delightfully spicy but not overpowering. From her reaction, I'm guessing that this dish gets rave reviews for a reason. I did notice that the portion was decently sized - 5 giant, stuffed dates with a bread roll on the side.  - Seared shrimp with beans, pesto and vinaigrette: Although there weren't any particularly interesting flavors, the dish was still delicious. It came with three giant pieces of shrimp with heads on, a generous serving of beans, and a delightfully tangy vinaigrette.  - Burnt wheat pasta with mussels, broccoli, and 'nduja butter: Not particularly impressed. The noodles were interesting - tasted very whole grain-y and they were hollow (!). The mussels weren't anything special, and I was disappointed by the minimal amount of broccoli. Simply put, this dish basically began tasting like buttered noodles after several bites, and there weren't enough variances in texture/consistency/flavor to keep me interested.  - Wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with rice, clams, green beans: This was okay. I'm probably partially biased because I was a bit full by this point. The pork shoulder was very good and juicy near the outside, especially when eaten with the rice and sauce. However, it got a little dry near the middle. I will say the portion size was quite generous. It was $21, but the chunk of shoulder was quite big.  Service was so-so. I remember reading some reviews that raved about stellar service, but I wasn't too impressed. Our waitress didn't seem too interested in serving us and wasn't particularly friendly either. However, our water was constantly re-filled and plates cleared away promptly by the busboys.  Spent $80 for two people, no drinks.

The interior is beautiful, the atmosphere is great, and though the communal sitting might get uncomfortable during its busy hours, it's all part of the experience.

The saltiness of the smoked bacon and chorizo combined with the sweetness of the dates is like nothing I've ever tasted. The piquillo pepper-tomato sauce makes the dish even more outstanding. This is not your ordinary bacon-wrapped dates. Whole roasted fish - I'm a fan of white fish, so this one really hit the spot. The salty flavors of lavender vinaigrette mixed with olives, fennel and arugula is perfection. Squid ink pasta with steamed mussels -  Didn't know what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised. The thick alla chitarra noodles are buttery and savory, and though the flavors of the chili and basil are a bit understated, I think the sea urchin butter is the highlight of the dish. The delicious, salty mussels also balance out the noodles at the end. Seared shrimp - Not anything groundbreaking, but still as delicious as shrimps could be. The shrimp is spiced perfectly, and the unique combination of the corona beans, radish top pest and roasted radish with limoncello vinaigrette makes the dish a satisfying treat. Lamb sausage - As a huge lamb fan, this was not my favorite dish. Just don't expect anything more than the dish description: lamb sausage with carrots, zucchini, dill, cilantro, green harissa and sesame seeds. Anise-marinated hanger steak - Oh, the meat, the meat, the meat was perfect. Perfectly cooked. And who knew adding avocado to steak could be so good??

Service wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either. I've noticed that service can be a problem at these communal table type restaurants, very busy and workman-like. However everything came out correctly and there weren't any egregious waits so it was fine. My friend and I ordered the chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon, the whipped brandade, the pork shoulder, and the chocolate praline soufflé cake for dessert. The food was mostly a hit. I absolutely adored the dates and the brandade. Amazing dishes not to be missed. I thought the pork shoulder was cooked perfectly but didn't love the sauce. However, I feel that was more that it wasn't a taste I prefer because my companion loved it. My main problem was with dessert. I have high expectations for restaurant desserts because I can cook pastry pretty well and avec just didn't cut it for me. The soufflé cake was cold and fallen, which I had been warned about. I didn't object to that but the sauce wasn't very good and the berries didn't appear or taste transformed in any way. All in all it felt like an afterthought and I didn't bother finishing it. Still the dates and brandade made up for the letdown at the end mostly. I'd return, but wouldn't order dessert again. I'd much rather go to Hot Chocolate after my meal or get a dessert in mk's lounge.",0.9899,0.741,0.193,0.066,0.6649999999999999
2013-08-07,4.0,"I absolutely loved Avec. No reservations, by dining here you opt to come share a meal among the other patrons at the communal tables or the bar. This matches nicely with Avec's small plates approach that encourages sharing among your party. I liked being able to spot what other people were ordering and get a feel for what different options Avec offered. I almost wished I could start to propose some sharing with the other diners as options are definitely not something Avec is short on and everything I tried made me want to see what they were able to do with their other dishes. We were advised to do two small plates or one large plate a person which sadly limited our party of 2 to 3 things. This was more than enough food but we had to make some tough choices to narrow it down to just 3 things. We went with the deluxe foccacia, the burrata, and the brandade. Everything was excellent but the rich ricotta cheese and truffle oil of the foccacia really stayed with me as the best dish of the night. What I love about their menu is that I could come back the next day, make completely different choices, and end up with a completely different style of meal. And I'd be lying if I said the thought of returning the next day didn't cross my mind, it's just that good.",0.9867,0.779,0.177,0.044,0.47628384687208225

Man, was I missing out! It was a Saturday night and my two friends and I got a table within 30 minutes. The turnover is pretty quick which is a mega plus at a popular restaurant on Randolph Street on a weekend night.  The food is pretty fantastic with a few minor faults here and there. We had the chorizo stuffed bacon-wrapped dates which totally lived up to their rave reviews. SLURP! The pork shoulder was really tender, but there was an abundance of rice and a lack of salt. The squid ink pasta was good, it's just that kind of dish that I want to love, but I can only bring myself to go with a ""like"" review. The thought of consuming the oyster mushrooms and the wood-fired squid amatriciana again causes me to salivate. The service was great. Food came out of the kitchen quick, and our server was very kind and knowledgable about food and wine. Another thing that I noticed and loved was the attention to the music selection. Radiohead, The Cure and Depeche Mode with dinner made it even more delectable.  Just short of 5-stars for me because of my food review and the fact that if someone has to get up to the restroom, the entire row of people has to get up. Community style seating.  Love Avec!

We ordered a bottle of wine from the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French options available (we also had port after dinner - and props for having a Pedro Ximenez option!!).  The service was efficient - our server attended to us but was not overbearing at all and had a very good grasp of the menu and wine selections. We ordered the chorizo bacon wrapped dates which were amazing.  I could have stopped after these as they were cooked to perfection and were incredibly tasty!  We pressed on to the lamb sausage, the salad (just OK - very lemony), the stuffed focacia bread (very rich)  and finally the braised pork shoulder which was also outstanding.  This was an ample amount of food for our group and we really enjoyed it. I can see how people may not like the community seating aspect, but we enjoyed the vibe in the place (lots of 90s hip hop in the background) and we were able to carry on a conversation throughout dinner.  I would certainly like to return to sample other items from the menu.",0.9946,0.82,0.172,0.007,0.5120408163265306

Following the mushrooms, we had the chicken liver crostini and the lamb sausage. They were both great, but we both agreed the crostini was the better dish.

The prices, for most things, is reasonable in comparison to other tapas-style places in Chicago, but I felt the quality of the dishes were just okay, especially after reading such raving reviews of these plates. One of the truly redeeming aspects of this restaurant though is not the design (which is great, but management, you have to fix those leaks above the women's restroom dooway!), but the service. Everyone we encountered was always smiling, we felt taken care of without feeling like they were being overbearing. They even allowed us to use a gift card we received to go toward tip, which is a stretch. So we ended up putting in more tip than standard just because they deserved it. As for the food, we ordered the bacon-wrapped dates, the salmon with fava bean puree, the braised pork shoulder w/ clams and rice, and the foccacia. The bacon wrapped dates were good, but they just didn't cut it for me. They were a little too sweet and the flavors didn't seem to meld enough for me. It could have used more sauce to balance out the sweetness, but all in all it the crispy bacony goodness still made it one of the better dishes of the night. The salmon wasn't anything special, it was tender but a little overdone, and it could have used some tartness or acidity to make it more vibrant. The foccacia although was fantastic in its first bite very quickly became too rich for me to consume more than a couple pieces (it's a whole pie). The pork shoulder was probably the best of the night - the clams were briney but tender, the roast pork was just the right texture and tenderness, the rice had soaked up all the goodness of its ingredients. It was delicious.  We ended the night with an amaretti cake which was a bit disappointing. The cake was pretty dry, but it was helped tremendously by the whipped cream and strawberries alongside it.

I ordered their chorizo stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon and their wood-oven roasted squid. OMG!

So what? we popped over to blackbird for a cocktail! basically killing two birds with one stone!   About 15 mins later, as we just put in our drink orders at Blackbird, avec called us! what a tease!

I actually don't understand why people make such a big deal out of ""personal space."" Back in Asia I basically got touched and pushed by strangers all day long - in a platonic non-creepy way. Plus I always peek at people's food to make sure I order the right thing, so their seating style was actually a plus. Needless to say we struck up a conversation and a quick laugh with the table next to us.

We were eating with friends so we had to behave!  The quality of the food is another story. Everything was delicious and well-done. My personal favorite is the grilled octopus and the focaccia - crispy bread, melty cheese, and a perfect touch of truffle aroma and herbs. My friends also complimented on the bacon dates and the pork shoulder, which combined the perfect amount of tender and fatty meat well done - the meat was cooked soo well we didn't even need a knife, and it melted in your mouth!  Desert is probably Avec's weakness. I loved my affogato, but I didn't care for the carrot cake much, it was rather dry! But tis ok, I was happy with the rest of the meal.

2013-04-13,4.0,"Super cute place. Located next to Blackbird on Randolph. May be hard to located because you don't really see the name for the place, there's no lit up sign. The place is long and narrow. Lots of people walking around and it's a bit hard since the place is narrow. The wood interior of the restaurant is simple and modern. We came in at around 9:30 on a Saturday night and was told the wait was expected to be around an hour but we were called to sit at the bar within about 20 minutes. Everyone was super friendly! Oh, and they do complimentary coat check =) and yes ladies, there are hooks under the bar for your purses. Food ordered were.. Bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates - were pretty good, although I'm not a big fan of bacon nor dates. The mixture of flavors worked well together though. The sweetness of the dates, the spice of the chorizo and the saltiness of the bacon balanced everything. This is worth trying. focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, truffle oil and fresh herbs - i loved this! it's like a light thin pizza. loved the wood burnt bottom and the sweet cheese and truffle oil. yum yum! one of the waiters brought over some honey for us to eat it with and it was perfect! Pasta with lamb Bolognese - not a lot of lamb but it was a good pasta dish, i especially liked that it wasn't a heavy pasta dish. Nothing too extraordinary about this dish though.. Tangier carrot cake w/ whipped goat cheese and pineapples - the cake was good but i wasn't really liking the whipped goat cheese, it was a bit too sour for the cake. A nice place to check out. Lots of wine to choose from and everyone here is really friendly. Small portions here, great to try everything and to share. No reservations!",0.9983,0.71,0.258,0.033,0.569047619047619

It's a long room and they pack in as many people as they came. As Bahi stated, the buzz really adds to avec's charm. I saw Chef Eric roaming about and I secretly wanted to say hi - he made it a point to go over and serve some people. It was nice to see him around the restaurant.  WE ATE/DRANK I was expecting to be more ""wowed"" - maybe it was high expectations. The chorizo stuffed dates were EXCEPTIONAL. Definitely a ""must"" here. I loved the chicken thigh as well. The steak fell a bit flat for me. The ladies at our table were not as enthused about the octopus. The latter two dishes were good but not great. I will say the value here is quite good.  The pinot grigio red wine was great to have as we were waiting. The staff here are really exceptional and though it was prime time they made sure we were taken care of.  I love the sharing concept without it being called ""tapas.""  OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I told that this was a must must must. It was really good but not AMAZING.

Interior: 2/5 (is it beautiful? yes.  is it designed to jam as many people in as possible AND have them in-and-out quickly? yes. does it tout itself as a high-end eatery? yes. i prefer higher-end eating experiences to accommodate comfort and not try to shuffle me out ASAP) Comfort: 0/5 (read below) Cleanliness: 5/5 (it's a very clean spot, with an open kitchen, which I love. the kitchen is spotless. I enjoy seeing the grill used in front of me. the bathroom is beautiful and impeccable) Customer Service: 3/5 (the wait staff is nice, but this place is very popular and crowded. you're easily forgotten about, and must frequently wait around for things. but the food was timely enough) Presentation: 4/5 Food Quality: 5/5 Food Taste: 3/5 Portions: 3-4/5 (well, this is a tapas place, albeit an overpriced one.  what can you expect portion-wise) Drinks: 3/5 (I'm not a big alcohol-drinker, so it's hard for me to judge amongst an array of drinks.  I am an avid Riesling drinker, and the Riesling I had here was not great.  I prefer a sweet and mild Riesling, but had a sour one). ----- I rarely give out 3's, but Avec is a solid 3 in my book.  I rate each restaurant relative amongst its type/range in THAT city.  So, no, I'm not rating 3/5 compared to Alinea or some kind of Michelin-star restaurant.  I rate Avec a solid 3/5 out of other restaurants with a similar aura and price range. I had many dishes: the whole roasted fish, roasted swordfish,  roasted pork shoulder, squid amatriciana, of course, the popular chorizo-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, and I forgot which salad.  All in all, I found the fish and squid amatriciana above average, and the pork shoulder average.  The popular chorizo-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates were amazing and my favorite (note- still not the best I've ever had.  I mention this because people RAVE about Avec as if it's one of the best top 15 eateries in town, and I just don't feel this way).  I'm a big fan of this dish, and have had it served different ways in different places (note: my favorite rendition was actually in Barcelona).  The salad was mediocre. In my long list of eateries visited, Avec wasn't memorable but not yet completely forgettable.  It's one of those memories that's barely there, those places I can say I ate at when others ask about it.  Why slightly unforgettable, you ask?  For me, it's for a negative reason.  The seats are so uncomfortable, it's such a small place, and there's so many people crowded together, it's so hard to feel comfortable OR hear your guest well.  I know it's purposefully designed this way so that many are in-and-out, but damn.  I'd be more comfortable sitting on the floor w/a cushion (a.k.a at authentic Asian restaurants).  It DOESN'T help you are unable to hear others next to you.  Lol, forget it if you're thinking of coming here as a 1st date, unless of course, you don't want to hear them and it's just a courtesy first (and last) date, ha. Beautiful restrooms, however.  The design uses light wood everywhere, it's very geometric and angular.  Sharp and clean looking.  Very clean and nice-looking place.  Comfort, as mentioned, is another topic...  There IS a problem with coats, however.  There's no coat check, and you're so crowded, you often have to sit at the bar (no seats), and then it's hard to hold your coat or sit on it.  There's a measly ""coat rack"" in the corner, but it's out in the open and for a place so busy, it could be easy for your jacket to disappear.  If you wear couture or jackets worth a few hundred minimum, this could be a serious, serious issue and the unpleasant-thought itself may prevent you from eating comfortably without glancing over every so-often. The owner has other restaurants, like Blackbird next door, and Publican.  If I had to pick between the two, I'd pick Blackbird hands down (far roomier), though Blackbird is also known to be another restaurant overrated for it's hype.  Wow, this post makes me feel/sound like a total downer, but I'm really not.  I've just eaten at a lot of good (and bad) restaurants, lol. All in all, my Avec experience was very middle-of-the-road.  I recommend that you do try it, as others seem to like it, and your tastebuds may rate it higher than mine.  If not, at least you can share in the ""Avec hype"" and know what it is (or isn't) about :)",0.9977,0.763,0.164,0.073,0.5589395313681028

My husband and I also tried their octopus with polenta this time. It's not that common to find larger octopus here, but this tentacle was from a larger one.

The roasted pork shoulder is a little reminiscent of the braised short ribs Koreans and Taiwanese people eat.  The pork shoulder is moist and filled with just the right amount of flavor and not overpowered with salt.  It's more than enough to share among 6 people, especially if you shared other dishes.   The next time I get to visit Avec, again, I'd like to try to their bruschetta, salad, and other desserts.",0.9791,0.811,0.168,0.021,0.5575396825396826

So bread and bread. Also, they offered to take the fish off of the field green salad *for the same price*, so I could have plan field greens for something like 15. These were no other options or offers to make something other than bread or plain lettuce.  For the bread I did eat, I wasn't blown away. It wasn't bad by any means, but it was very expensive and very salty. As I said, I was with a group, and the rest of them ate various dishes. Including me and my friend who only ate the foccacia, the bill averaged to $46 per person. That's insane!

2013-02-15,5.0,"Yes! 1,000th review.  I went to Avec for the first time on Valentine's day. I cannot believe it has taken me this long to check it out.  We arrived at 7pm and it was really crowded while we waited. It was uncomfortable but our estimated 1 hour wait ended up only being about 35 minutes. Not bad, especially considering they took our drink orders and brought them to us while we waited.  I like the ambiance. It is nicer and high end, but I would have felt perfectly comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt. There is no pretension here, just a perfect balance of casual and sophistication.  We sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine. I like the price range they have for their wine selection. I don't have a very developed palate for wine so I was perfectly content ordering the $19 bottle. They had nicer ones available but I wouldn't have known the difference.  We shared the foccacia bread which was great. I wouldn't want it to be my whole meal but it was great to share. I ordered the chicken thigh with brussels sprouts. It was amazing. Even though it was a small plate it still filled me up. I wanted to order another one just to take it home with me. It was that good.  My boyfriend ordered the pork shoulder. I usually don't like pork but they somehow made this pork so perfectly that it melted in my mouth. I will admit, it was fantastic.  For dessert we shared an affogato. I assumed I had the best affogato possible in Italy, but Avec's trumps anything I had there. Again, I considered ordering another one it was so good.  I had the tasting menu at Blackbird a few days prior and I was far more impressed by the few things I tried at Avec (and the prices were way more reasonable).

2013-02-08,4.0,"Good dinner overall but there is a ridiculous wait time and a strange atmosphere. Food: Everything is designed to be shared.  In that sense, I guess it's like a French tapas place but there are both small and large plates.  We already had something to eat previously, so we just shared a few small plates and one big plate.  Of course, we ordered the bacon-wrapped chorizo-filled dates which were phenomenal--sweet, crispy, bacon-y, and spicy.  I think it could have been even more improved if there was slightly less chorizo inside so that the balance of flavors was a bit more equal.  Other than that though, fantastic choice.  We also got the roasted white fish and the focaccia that everyone was raving about.  The white fish was good and the focaccia was delicious and cheesy and yes, very filling.  Wine selection is extensive and great also. Atmosphere:  I don't have a problem sitting next to people.  Communal dining is great...it connects people and gives it an old-school feel.  So, don't get me wrong, that's not the reason that I think Avec has a strange atmosphere.  It's just way too darn loud.  Walking to the restaurant, it is absolutely silent on the streets outside.  But, the minute you push open that wooden door, you are bombarded with the noise of human chatter.  It's great to have a bubbly, upbeat atmosphere, but it was so clamoring that I could hardly hear my dinnermates from right across the table.  There were many instances of miscommunication.  As the night went on and other parties left, we realized, in fact that there had been French music playing.  You can attribute the fact that we did not hear it upon entering so we were surprised when we finally were able to decipher out the type of music playing.  As it got later and later and other parties finished their meals and left, we could make out different instruments coming into play.  But, seriously, awful acoustics.  Probably because you are basically sitting in a long wooden box. Service: Service was friendly but possibly not quite as attentive as necessary.  We really only saw our waitress when we absolutely needed her--to order, to get our meal, and to get the check.  Some face time in between would have been nice. The Wait: Even on a weekday night at 8 PM, the place was packed and there was still an hour wait.  We decided, as other Yelpers have recommended, to check out the Korean bar next door.  There is really no indoor waiting area anyway and in the blistering heat, we didn't want to wait outside.",0.9963,0.802,0.161,0.037,0.4293272864701436

The waiter was extremely knowledgeable as we bombarded him with questions.  He knew how every single dish was prepared and could compare rare ingredients to other things we've probably tried.  He was very helpful with our drink selections too. Some of the dishes that stood out were the marinated chicken thigh with bomba rice, charmoula, red kuri squash and apples.

The tables are so narrow, that when seated across from someone, your toes are practically touching. I was part of a party of three and was seated at the head of the table. There was not even enough room for me to put my feet on the floor under the table, and because the chairs are solid, I couldn't simply curl them up under my seat.

2013-01-09,4.0,"This is a bit of a duel review for avec and Blackbird, but seeing as how they're sister restaurants I don't think it should be an issue. My BFF was visiting from Cleves, and as usual she likes to live it up in one of Chicago's best restaurants - we settled on avec, but the place was packed so we were politely directed next door for a bit of a tipple at Blackbird. Am very glad, because all four of us really enjoyed the London Calling cocktail - a mix of gin, Pimms, ginger, and cucumber soda - to the point where we all got seconds. I also insisted on trying their semi-famous endive and crispy potato salad with a poached egg on top (the potato is shaped into a basket, the server cuts it up for you!), which I really enjoyed. Blackbird was lovely, but a little posh for us. Note: as I travelled between restaurants - they're separated by a small alleyway - a large rat ran across my foot. Don't be alarmed - if I were a rat living in Chicago, I'd hang out in Blackbird's dumpster, too. Plus, it reminded me of home, as Australia has rats the size of their ancestral ship denizens. Finally we were called to our table at avec. The crowd was 90% hipster, and jumping. Our server was lovely, and recommended excellent cheeses for the platter (with honeycomb, and quince jelly), and a good red wine. The dishes, however, were a bit hit and miss. Here's a rundown of ones that were memorable, both good and bad: ""deluxe"" foccacia - server recommended, and my favourite dish of the night. Crispy, salty, creamy. It was addictive. The bacon/chorizo stuffed dates, another signature dish, were merely okay (a bit sad, because I was really excited to try it). I ordered the burrata with eggplant and mushroom, which I enjoyed. The Husband ordered the pork shoulder cassoulet, and it was universally loved. However, my chicken dish - which I anticipated as being homey, warming, comforting - was both odd and universally *unloved*. The chicken itself was pronounced in its cumin affliction, and otherwise bland (Tom Colicchio would deduce serious points for lack of seasoning). The rice was a bit gluggy, instead of crispy. Supremely disappointing. We ordered virtually half the menu, although I'm struggling to recall what else...ah! The pear and quinoa salad was yummy, and I enjoyed the roasted leek bruschetta, too. We also ordered the entire dessert menu - hey, there were 4 of us! - and I loved the affagato best, although the orange upside down cake was delightfully moist and tasty. By that point we were stuffed and poor, but couldn't shake the feeling that we'd had...better. And we had. While avec was fun, and a prime restaurant to cross off the Done list, Girl & the Goat remains my favourite restaurant, ever. When you leave G&tG, you're euphoric, happily surprised, blissfully educated. I didn't get that feeling from avec, and neither did my cohorts.

The only dish that was a bit much for just one person was the brandade, as it is a bit greasy and it comes with bread that is enough for two persons. We had wine- 2004 Luis Canas, temranillo- I liked it a lot, and the pricefor it was for 250ml, which is more that just a regular wine glass size.  Our server was polite and attentive, and did not bother us with ""Is everything ok, Did you need anything else""-type of questions every five minutes( like in many other restaurants I've been to). The hostess, Sam, was friendly and knowledgeable when it comes to food. I like the fact that every time the busboy brought a dish to us, he introduced the dish by listing all the ingredients inside.  The music was not very loud and we were able to converse easily. We will definitely be back to try some other delicious stuff here.",0.9921,0.836,0.154,0.01,0.5391555468341183

It's a bit small, but we arrived on a Sunday evening and it wasn't terribly crowded. We were able to get seated at the bar right away. The staff was very friendly and attentive. They explained things on the menu that we didn't know the details about and were very helpful. For such a foodie and high brow restaurant, it was very refreshing to see how approachable and pleasant the staff is. Food is excellent. Quality and craftsmanship were very high, although some of the flavors were subtle so make sure to pay attention. We had the focaccia, squid, and brandade. All were amazing.

The space is not ideal for a first date, because the tables are communal, which can make for some awkwardness. But for a nice dinner with a significant other and friends, it's a fun atmosphere. The bar counter is also really nice.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the ""focaccia."" I literally have dreams about it. Delicious truffled cheese and oil between two thin focaccia's. It is just so so good. At this point I've tried most things on the menu, and haven't really disliked anything. It's a great place for sharing, as the food just kind of comes out when it's ready, and it does not disappoint.

2012-12-31,4.0,"While in Chicago for a conference, I had one night where I was solo for dinner. I chose Avec since I'd read that their counter and common-table seating would be suitable for a single diner. Sure enough, I walked right past a line of guests waiting on the sidewalk for seats and was seated in the single empty chair at the counter. Even before seeing a menu, I was excited about the meal thanks to the vibe of the restaurant, smells coming from the open (tiny) kitchen, and smiles on diners' faces. I was pleased to see Campari at the small bar, and started out with a serving on the rocks. I ordered the leek bruschetta, which came out quickly and was fantastic. I ordered a glass of wine from their decent wine list, but was told that they were out of that bottle. I took a substitution which was great. I saw the smoked edwards surryano ham on the menu, and asked my waiter for a 1oz portion of the ham by itself rather than the ham dish on the menu. He said that'd be fine, but after consulting with the kitchen came back and told me they'd rather serve it as the dish on the menu. I love a great ham, but was pretty disappointed with how Avec killed it. The great ham was served with crisp tart apples, avocado, LOTS of pepper, olive oil, and vinegar. I couldn't taste any of the smoky ham flavor through the curtain of accompaniments. Unfortunate. Avec has a great menu with lots of interesting, original combinations. With such talent and creativity, I'd expect the chefs to highlight great ingredients rather than hide them. For an entree I had the roasted pork shoulder, which took a while but was worth the wait. It was served in an individual cast iron hot out of the oven. The pork was obviously fork-tender, and the sauce and veggies melded together exquisitely. I took half of it home and enjoyed it for breakfast the next day.",0.9955,0.758,0.195,0.047,0.5549554781262098

We came on a busy Thursday night, people were waiting outside despite the frigid weather - a sign that it's worth the wait.  Started off with the chorizo stuffed dates which I saw everyone raving about on here. They were good, but also the most forgettable part of the meal. For me, bacon-wrapped-anything all tastes similar - delicious, but similar.  The wood-oven roasted pork shoulder was AMAZING, the meat was so tender and it just fell off the bone. I loved every bite. I hear they change the recipe every few months though, so try and grab this one while it's around. Also had the baby octopus with squid ink linguine. We were seated at the bar in front of the cook and saw this being prepared, and we just had to try. We weren't disappointed, it tasted as good as it looks.  If you go, just be prepared for a wait. When we went though, we were told 25 mins, so we got a drink next door. But we suddenly got a call in 10 mins and had to down our cocktails super fast. Also, I'm not a fan of family style tables - it's loud and I don't like people listening in on my conversations, so I'd suggest the eating at the bar if you're the same.",0.9905,0.813,0.167,0.019,0.5432222222222223
2012-12-25,4.0,"like many of the other reviewers Have mentioned, Avec is a great place to go to and serves delicious food. the first thing that came to mind when i entered the restaurant was that it was very small, yet it aPPeared to have a cozY and ""cool"" atmosphere. my Boyfriend and I went on a friday night and found the place to be packed. (even afteR leaving around 9pm, people were still waiTing to get in.) we ended up waiting over an Hour for our seats and were eventually seateD at a communal table. lucky for us, we sat at the edge of the tAble so we were not sandwiched between other people. due to the communal tables, holding a conversation was slightlY difficult and it was easy to eavesdrop on what others were saying.  The waitress was very attentive and made great recommendations to us first-timers. She even ran out after we left because I forgot to take my leftover dessert. When ordering, you may have the inclination to order more items due to the ""small,"" ""medium,"" and ""large"" plate sizes, but you can get full with just two small plates and a large plate - this was more than enough food for two people.  We started with the chorizo-stuffed dates, and these were delicious! It comes with bread, which is great dipped in the spicy tomato sauce the dates are in. The smoky flavor of the chorizo mixed with the sweetness of the dates made for a flavorful combination. I would highly recommend getting this if you go to Avec or haven't tried it yet. The fish dish we ordered was good and went well after the dates since it was a much lighter course, but since I can't even remember what exactly it was, it didn't make that great of an impression on me. We also ordered the roasted pork shoulder, which was also very good. The meat is slow roasted and it fell apart as soon as you touched it. The pork was super tender and moist. The flavors were simple, yet it worked well with this dish.  After these three plates, we were already stuffed, but I didn't pass on getting dessert. We ended up ordering the housemade chocolate crisps. These were not anything special, but it was still good considering it was just chocolate. You get broken pieces of dark and milk chocolate sheets that are filled with ""crisps"" (think Crunch bars, but a lot thinner).  Overall, Avec is a nice place to go to for a great meal. The atmosphere will probably be different than most are use to. You may get claustrophobic because the person sitting next to you is touching your shoulder but don't let that stop you from trying this place out.",0.9965,0.837,0.146,0.017,0.552847619047619

I recommended this restaurant to many people.  Because of the number of restaurants in Chicago, it has taken me a while to return.  I went last night and was sadly disappointed.   As I was reading the menu, I thought to myself where are all the amazing comfort dishes that I expect from Avec?  I decided to erase my expectations and move forward. I ordered the dates, leek bruschetta and pork shoulder.  Here are my thoughts: dates:  delicious.  the smokey chorizo was unique and bursting with flavor.  So far so good... leek bruschetta:  not a fan.  I thought the leeks would be more caramelized or cooked.  They were broiled momentarily with the fennel, on top of dry grilled bread.  It was flavorless. I add fennel to my meals at home at least once a week so love fennel.  This dish was just okay. I would not recommend it. pork shoulder:  it tasted good enough, but I didn't expect it to have the same flavor as pozole, a mexican soup. (lentils instead of chickpeas though).  Perhaps if they would have added a smokey pepper like chipotle it would have created a more complex flavor.  When you spoon the soup onto your dish, the shoulder lacked flavor.  It needed seasoning. This is typical with soups using large portions of meat BUT, if you are not eating it as a soup and you are expected to spoon it onto a plate, the pork needs salt.  It was good enough, but I've had better in pilsen. Would I go back? The chef has changed. The current chef has a more mexican palate (dates with chorizo, pozole...).  I prefer the original peasant french food from the past.

I had to sop up the rest of the tomato sauce with bread too. - Burrata with marinated tomatoes and pork bits. The warm cheese was very delicious, and went very well with the accompaniments.  - Wood oven roasted pork shoulder with braised flageolet and roman beans, kielbasa, and pickled banana pepper relish. This dish was awesome! It came out in a small pot and the meat was so tender it fell apart in the mouth. The stew it was cooked in seeped into the meat to really produce a tender, delicious dish. - Pizza with anchovy and greens. This was also quite delicious, and made up for the fact that we accidentally ordered it instead of the flatbread. The salty/briny taste from the anchovy was actually very good on the pizza! (I'm not normally an anchovy on pizza type of guy) The ambience was cool, a small space with a wooden interior (it kind of looks like a sauna, but doesn't feel like one...) and very modern.

Service was good, though the first course did take a while to show up.   All in a all with our order and I believe 3 glasses of wine the damage was only about $120 after tip.  This place is definitely on my list to recommend to friends visiting Chicago.",0.9755,0.683,0.225,0.092,0.5119166666666668

I dined on three small plates for my sublime gluttonous dinner. Like everyone else I went with an order of the chorizo stuffed dates, where they put pig in your pig so you dine on swine while you wine. It was fantastic. Just an excellent dish with great taste. I then tried the chicken thighs. These weren't as stellar as the chorizo stuffed dates but it was still excellently prepared. The squash and rice that accompanied them thighs were good, too. Finally I went with the veal. That was fantastic. Really fantastic. When I go back I'm getting the veal, the stuffed dates, and then trying something else.",0.9863,0.781,0.219,0.0,0.6823529411764706

The pasta was fresh, the flavor were amazing.  It was one of those times where there were so many things going on with your palette that I really didn't know what I was tasting, but I knew it was damn good.  The chorizo stuffed dates will be ordered and quickly consumed every time I go, even though I normally hate dates.  It is my mission to go back as many times as necessary to try the whole menu, but those were the two highlights of an overall excellent meal.   I don't know if I'm punch drunk over the experience with the food, but I normally detest communal seating and the lack of a reservation system.  I actually struck up several conversations at dinner and met a regular who shared my general displeasure of sitting next to strangers who stared at my food.  He told me there's something different about the crowd here, which I fully agree with.  It's been around for a while, so maybe you don't get the rush of tourists or out of town business people.  I can't put my finger on it, but it provided for a great vibe and energy that really made the most of the communal atmosphere.  As far as no reservations, a restaurant this good would probably have a painstaking 2 week wait to get into during peak hours, I'll switch that out for a last second decide to go and end up with a 45 minute wait and 2 brews next door any day. The biggest surprise came at the end of the night.  As good as the food was, there was too much for 2 people to finish (as hard as we painstaking tried), couple that with an excellent bottle of wine and the bill was under $120 after tip.  I'm still doing the math in my head and it makes no sense at all.  One of the best deals in the city and I would stick to that even if it were 50% higher. stop reading, free up a night and get there now!",0.9899,0.82,0.115,0.066,0.49235290571497475
2012-10-19,2.0,A big let-down. Everything is way too salty for human consumption. I tried the signature dishes: the bacon-wrapped date and the squid. Both are so unbelievably heavy on seasoning that you can not even taste the flavor of the food itself. And the seasoning is not done right. For example they use too much chorizo and too little date. Simmering everything in tomato sauce makes things worse. Depending on who you are the ambiance may be a hit or miss. I don't fancy it at all. The seats are narrow and you will have to sit among complete strangers who are going to shout at each other for a conversation since the music here is insane.,-0.7506,0.936,0.0,0.064,0.4282467532467532

We decided to go with a few small plates: -buratta: this was ok, but not very memorable -sardine bruschetta: this was one of the specials and was disappointing. I didn't like the flavor combination -wood-fired squid: you know a dish will be spicy when there is a dollop of cream on top! This was a little too spicy for my liking, but I kept shoving it in my mouth anyway.  -bacon wrapped, chorizo-stuffed dates: there is a reason this is a staple menu item! This was my favorite dish. I loved the combination of smokey bacon, spicy chorizo and sweet dates. Would it be weird if I ordered two plates for myself next time? -cheese plate: we were drunk and went with the server's suggestions. I don't remember what cheeses we had, but I remember them being delicious. The plate came with bread, grapes and almonds that were drizzled with something sweet.

I was almost tired from my boyfriend raving about the chorizo stuffed dates for four months until I went with him. Now I think people are tired of me raving about them.  Avec knows what it is doing as it is balanced: the top notes of food don't overwhelm the subtle flavors (a chorizo stuffed date could be a nightmare of a balancing act, especially with a red sauce on top... imagine the acidity and fattiness if not properly balanced). The environment is simple and clean--almost Nordic--perfectly balanced between being upscale and casual.  Best thing is, the price is what you want it to be; the glass of wine is about 3 glasses, the food can be filling with one $14 plate, or fill you up with 3 plates and still stay under $45.

I also tried not ordering their most popular small plate - their dates (no pun intended, although my friend thought waiter was pretty cute). But the bacon-wrapped part lasso'd me, and then the chorizo-stuffed part pulled me in. fast. Small portions, yes, but huge flavor. Chorizo juices flowing out, and then the sweetness of the dates mixed with the salty bacon, all in one bite (may want to take several to savor it as long as you can). It also comes in a delicious red tomato base that is perfect with the bread that comes with the dish. Another must-try: focaccia flatbread, not only laced taleggio and ricotta chcese, but drizzled to perfection with truffle oil. I pretty much ate the whole thing myself. It melts in your mouth and gives it flavors you didn't think was possible in just a flatbread. We also tried the wood-fired squid, which was on what I think was a bed of noodles / pasta. Each bite burst with flavor, and the squid was grilled to have the perfect crunchy firmness to it, married by the soft al dente noodles below.  This was almost a 5-star, except I wasn't too impressed with the desserts. We had the homemade nutter butter (total of 3 small pieces, but honestly would rather have the real Nutter Butters for 85 cents in the vending machine). The chocolate budino with oloroso cream tasted too much like an Irish Car Bomb to me - which I don't not like, but wouldn't have liked it as a dessert. A little bland on flavor, and texture was quite fluid.  Overall, good atmosphere, can get pretty loud during busy times. Don't be afraid to sit at the bar, because not only do you have to usually wait longer for a table, but they will most likely seat you at a table with another couple/party touching your knees.

Came here with my husband per our usual date night on a Saturday night and were supposed to arrive around 6pm and hope for a decent wait time, but plans changed and we got there around 5:15pm which was perfect since we got sat right away. The whole communal dining experience isn't ideal for date night and my husband is def. not a fan of that, so we probably should have sat at the bar since there were a few empty seats. By 5:30pm, the place was jam packed and at least a half an hour wait, so timing is key at this place.  Since we were literally on top of our neighbors, on both sides of us, we got to see that everyone pretty much orders the focaccia and the dates and so we ordered both since there was just two of us and a few of their beers. Beers were alright, nothing note worthy even getting the Italian ones. The focaccia came out first and it was a okay, we both thought it was tasty, but a bit bland for us, so I would have to agree with some of the other reviews so at this point my Avec experience is a okay to even I've experienced better point, but wait, wait, everything CHANGED when we received the chorizo stuffed, bacon wrapped, mejdool dates in that spicy red sauce served with hot bread. WOW, that was one of the best things I""ve ever eaten, my two star experience suddenly went up to four stars because, they were amazing. Just get them, don't think twice, in fact get a portion just for yourself because they are just that good. Perfect combination of sweet, salty, spicy and mouth-watering goodness.

The wait was about 30-45 min which was not as bad as we imagined. Since it was such a small space, we did have to wait outside in a little area they had sectioned off. Now on to the food. We ordered everything to share. Small Plates: Big eyed tuna crudo: 3 pieces of fresh, delicious fish. There was a nice smoky chili flavor to the sauce. Burrata with marinated tomato and pork bits: The burrata was so creamy and buttery. The tomatoes added a very nice texture to it. Chorizo stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon: Perfect blend of savory from the chorizo, sweetness from the dates, and smokiness from the bacon, along with a slight kick from the chilis Crispy redfish with watermelon, onion, and tomato relish: The skin had such a nice crisp and flavor to it. The fish was soft, warm, and flaky..well cooked. The relish added a nice freshness and texture to the dish.  Large Plates: Squid ink pasta alla chitarra with corn, fresh cayenne pepper, mint breadcrumbs and rock shrimp - Nice earthy flavor. Pasta was perfect al dente. The shrimp were well cooked, but I have to deduct half a star because they were not deveined. :( I expect that from a place like this. Otherwise I really enjoyed the dish.  Wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with braised flageolet & romano beans, PQM kielbasa, and pickled banana pepper relish - If there were a bone it would have the melts off the bone effect. Very tender and flavorful meat. The relish added a nice briny flavor.  Because of the size of the restaurant, the seating is limited. They have a communal table concept...A long table with one side being a bench and the other side chairs. It's very cramped and a bit awkward because you have to get up to let other parties in and out if you are sitting on the ends.

2012-09-20,4.0,"I am so torn on this review... There were such highlights but the service (to my great suprise based on the reviews) really left something to be desired.  I started at a 4 went back to a 3 and am now at a 4 again.  The food is great, yes, but we were taking an out of town friend here and I just don't know that I would do that again knowing there are places with better service.  Meal cost 5 people, bottle of wine, 3 beers, 5 cocktails, with tip, food, $60 per person. Let's start at the happy place, food: 4.5 stars - Dates: super yummy, very heavy, only 4 in an order, but you only need 1 per person.   - Hanger steak: was a little well dont for my taste and given the cut, but it paird beautifully with the mushrooms, which were fresh and perfectly cooked. - Focacia:  very light and crisp, the cheese and truffle oil was deslish.  Great size too, so if you are going with a party of 4 or so, definitely worth it.  For 2, you are going to be pretty stuffed after. - Salmon: Torn... The salmon was absolutely perfectly cooked and of high quality.  The pairing with the fingerling potatoes were just OK.  I thought the sauce was bland and the potatoes were underdone. - Toscano Salumi plate: yummy. Cheese plate: spain - la pata cabra, france - tomme brebis, and portugal - castelinhos: super yummy, very high quality cheese.  We also ordered the accurtiamets and they paired nicely.  However, they give you one very small piece of bread for a generous portion of cheese, and I just think it's a poor balance.  We would have asked for more... but the service. Service 2-3 stars:  We walked it an 8pm on a Wednesday and they lovely hostess took our name and number and said she would call in 60-90 minutes.  We were plesently suprised to hear from her an hour later with our table.  We walked over sat down and our server promptly showed up, which was the peak point of our waiters attention. What went wrong:  I originally wrote this huge explanation, but in the bottom line is that our server was inattentive, flippant, and borderline rude to us. But the highlight is that  we are noshing on the yummy dates and my friend who ordered a French 75 has this really funky glass that is like a cocktail glass but they make a thin 1/2 inch stem and no bottom to balance it.  So, my friend knocks it over when we are trying to make room on our table, and the waiter who is about 3 people away looks over and lets out a VERBAL scoff at us and literally runs away.  The very helpful runner who is right there apoligizes for the clutter of glasses and gets napkins and helps us.  I realize it isn't the most gracious move to knock over a glass in a trendy restaurant, but seriously when you service glasses with a thin stem and no bottom, you shouldn't get that upset.  Oh and our waiter also brought out 6 wine glasses when we told you only 2 people were drinking it.  Which, if you have been here you know how overly crowded and limiting that makes the table. This was the whole attitude toward us the whole night.  And we were pulling teeth to get a second round of drinks Bottom line: I'll be back BUT I would be disinclined to bring someone from out of town, like we did, knowing the service.",0.9992,0.731,0.221,0.048,0.602766097634022

So a minor annoyance. - If you are looking for a place to bring kids, this is not it.  Simply too many people in a small space to accommodate children, seems to me. - The server told us to get 2 items per person (everything is family style), even the large plates.  You don't need that much food.  One large plate, one small plate and the olive side were plenty for us. Pros: -food is awesome.  Yes to the dates - Wow.  Pork shoulder was ""good"" but didn't live up to the hype - kinda bland - but the kielbasa that came with it was outstanding.  Olive plate had tons of variety. - great wine menu. - really cool, intimate atmosphere. - very friendly service - not uppity like you might expect for this kind of joint.

The place is not what I'd call ""kid friendly"" in the least, but our child was well-behaved and they let her plop down on the bench between us adults no problem. I think we had the perfect amount of people.  We split a few different plates, got to try a little of everything, and the bill was very reasonable.  Go with a few friends or another couple and you've got plenty of options to try.  I agree with previous posters that you'd want to order more plates just to try them if dining with only two. We shared the heirloom tomatoes (great combination of texture/flavors), squid ink pasta (even the baby ate this!), hangar steak (excellent), and wood-fired squid -- which I hardly had room for but was also very good.  (I know what chorizo-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates taste like because I've had them at several other restaurants, and I don't doubt they're tasty here but it wasn't what I was wanting that night.) I can't decide whether I'm a fan of the decor, or rather, lack thereof.  It's like dining in a long giant wooden shoebox or something and the no windows/mirrors thing was semi-claustrophobic... but I was busy enjoying the food 99.99% of the time; the walls were a passing thought.",0.9828,0.798,0.156,0.046,0.5092888888888889

I can't remember what all the dishes were called, but we had  an app that consisted of corn puree on freshly baked bread (which was amazing) the dates stuffed with chorizo and wrapped in bacon (which came highly recommended, but actually wasn't my favorite--although my sister loved them) an entree with pulled pork and chorizo that was unspeakably good. I worked in a Puerto Rican restaurant that was famous for it's pulled pork, and Avec's was definitely comparable with its melt-in-your-mouth meat. ...and finally... the flatbread with ricotta and another cheese I can't remember the name of. This was maybe the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. Holy shit.  We also had tea and little peanut butter, chocolate pastries for dessert. Mmmmmm.

We arrived at about 5pm without a reservation and were seated at the bar. We ordered the roasted corn crostini with pepitas, smokey peppers and watercress and the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce. Although we ordered together, the crostini arrived about 5 mins before the dates. Upon attempting to cut a crostini in half to share, I almost sent half of it flying across the room. It was as hard as a hockey puck and burnt substantially. When the bartender approached to ask how our food was some 5 mins later I requested a new crostini be made. She obliged but seemed insincere with her apology. When the new dish returned about 10 mins later, the crostini was half the thickness and barely toasted at all. My friend said the the dates were tasty but not phenomenal. Overall the experience was ok, the food was saved by the atmosphere of the patronage and a pleasant decor.

Price is in the mid range and the food was the same. My wife and I had gone to Longman and Eagle two nights before and Avec just didn't quite lived up to the hyped of other yelp reviews. We ordered the Hanger Steak, Cheese Platter (La Peral was the highlight), the Red Fish, the Medjool Dates, and the Wood - Fired Squid. All our dishes were good, but they were not great and left both of us wondering what the hype was about. I just expected to more and was just left wanting. Perhaps the expectation was too great and quality just can't be maintained. I think after the media publicity on No Reservations, the hype got even bigger.

2012-08-31,3.0,"I expected to be ""wowed"" after reading all the great reviews for Avec but I have to say, I was a bit underwhelmed.  I went with my sister at around 6pm on a weekday, and luckily we didn't have to wait for a table.  It did take us a while to find the door, however, since it blends in with the wall.  The decor was simple but I did not like sharing tables and sitting in between two groups of people.  If I needed to use the bathroom (which, fortunately for the ""tables"" next to us, I didn't need to), then everyone on one side of me would have to stop eating and conversing to let me out, and later, do it again to let me back in.  A few people actually had to get up at the end of our meal so that I could get out to leave.  Annoying. If you want to eat and converse with some privacy, this is not the place for you. The group to the left of us was super loud while the couple to our right was quiet (and I think they were listening to our conversation...) Our waitress (an older woman who was a little frumpy and looked like she just rolled out of bed) played favorites, which was clear because she told the table next to us that there were specials for the day but did not tell us that there were any specials...we found that strange but that (and her slow, almost neglectful, service) was reflected in her tip so no worries.  We ordered the deluxe focaccia (with cheese, truffle oil, and herbs), the wood-fired flatbread (with mushrooms, spinach, bacon, and goat cheese), marinated hanger steak with kale chips, and the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon.  That was wayyy too much food for two people but they served as mediocre drunk munchies later on in the night.   The focaccia was good but very salty.  The hanger steak didn't have much flavor but was cooked well.  The flatbread with goat cheese wasn't flavorful either, and probably could have used some of the salt that was used in excess on the focaccia.  The only thing worth eating was the chorizo-stuffed dates...they were amazing.  Filling and flavorful...my mouth is watering just thinking about them! I'm really not a picky eater but I do enjoy flavorful (not salty) foods with good service.  The service could use improvement, and the food was so-so.  If you go, order the chorizo-stuffed dates with a glass of wine, and call it a night.  (P.S. the guy who fills your water does it so aggressively that it splashes onto your food/phone/anything you leave on the table so watch out)",0.9473,0.821,0.102,0.077,0.4373015873015873

2012-08-28,4.0,"Word is that there will be a new chef soon, so I better get to it on my review. The boyfriend and I came here with a friend of his about a month ago, and we ordered the chorizo stuffed dates. Now, I usually don't like this dish. I've had bacon wrapped dates multiple times at many Spanish tapas places, and I've never liked it. My companions always order it, and I always get offered one, but I just didn't like the mushy, sweetness of the dates with the hard (not crispy), semi-salty bacon. It wasn't my thing, and I was almost sure that I wouldn't like Avec's version either. I was wrong though. Avec's was slightly spicy thanks to the peppery tomato sauce, and I love the chunkiness of the chorizo with the mushy, sweet dates and the salty, savory bacon. This plate of bacon wrapped dates was the best I've ever had.  We also ordered the hanger steak with shaved artichokes, dried crimini mushrooms, pine nuts, parmesan and kale chips. It sounded good, but actually, this was my least favorite dish. First, I didn't think that the crimini mushrooms would be dried. It didn't mention it on the menu. It was like eating it straight out of a bag of sliced dried shiitake mushrooms (except that shiitake would have been more fragrant)... It was strange to me. Second, the flavors of the toppings were so overpowering that I didn't enjoy the steak. The toppings had a very herby taste to it. Finally, I thought the steak was a little dry too.  For our last dish, we ordered the wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with braised collard greens, wild rice, and green tomato chow chow. I don't know what green tomato chow chow means, but the dish was very good and savory. I liked this one a lot too, if only because it reminded me a little bit (very, very faintly!) of my mom's bo kho (Vietnamese beef stew, except that my mom made it with lamb meat). I was also surprised by the wild rice, and at first I thought it was the black forbidden rice from China. It tasted very good, and the broth was very fatty. It was perfect for dipping your bread into after you're done with the meat.  I had a very fun and enjoyable meal here, and we had some fun talking to our neighbors next to us at the communal table. I thought the restaurant would be a little more classy (not that it's not!), but it was a lot more casual than I thought, and I enjoyed that a lot.

Here's my take on each: - Chorizo-stuffed dates: Lots of flavor, but pretty heavy. Would be nice if they could lighten-up the chorizo filling which was dense. The bacon wrap was undercooked, and therefore fatty. - Burrata cheese: A nice smooth disk of burrata, topped with some colorful grape tomatoes and what seemed to be a light olive oil vinagrette. I've had this before and while good, really didn't stand out. - Grilled squid: The most disappointing of our dishes. A concoction of very small pieces of squid and fideo swimming in a pretty pedestrian tomato sauce (tasted like marinara out of the jar). The special antipasti, consisting of kale, thinly sliced fennel, and cauliflower in a vinagrette was good....maybe the most enjoyable thing we had. Service was attentive, but felt a bit rushed. They had asked us to order everything at the start so that they could properly ""course"" the meal. This makes sense until some of the courses started piling up....also difficult to gauge how much food we were actually ordering.   So overall I'd say the food was OK but overrated.

2012-07-29,4.0,I finally ate here last night.  We arrived around 645 and to my surprise we were seated almost immediately.  Then we sat for a good 15-20 mins before anyone came to take our drink order.  I'll echo the other reviews that the seats are horrible uncomfy....I wish i knew about the butt cushions when I sat down...sadly I didn't notice them until the end of the meal.  Our server wasn't friendly at all.  Not sure if she felt she didn't need to be because it's Avec but she bugged.   The dates are as amazing as everyone says....same with the pork shoulder.  The squid was gross.  I was so pissed we trusted our servers rec and got that instead of the steak.  It was like squid mixed with spaghetti-o's.  The antipasto of the day was also really tasty.  I'd love to go back and try some of the flatbreads and get the steak.  I am glad the placed lived up to all the hype.,0.9407,0.762,0.161,0.077,0.5271825396825397

Although the foccacia was delicious as usual, I thought it could have used a touch more salt and truffle. The squid on the other hand, was amazing as usual and cemented its place at #1. It doesn't get as much love as the dates or the foccacia or even the pork shoulder, but the combination of super fresh squid, creamy fennel aioli, fresh vibrant tomatoes, and smoky guanciale is ridiculously good.

2012-07-14,4.0,"Avec was the second of two dinners on a weekend getaway to Chicago with my boyfriend. Having had an amazing dinner at Girl and the Goat the night before, my bar was set pretty high. I have to say though, Avec delivered. The wood interior of Avec translates directly to its food-- simple, natural, beautiful.  We started with the burrata, dressed with pickled ramps, rhubarb and golden beets and topped with fresh tarragon, olive oil, and salt + pepper. Amazing. Soooo delicious. The portion size is pretty large, although it is categorized under small plates. I would recommend this dish for up to 4 people easily. Next we had the fermin serrano shaved paper thin. We still had our burrata on the table with some bread and these two dished paired nicely together. Very light and simple flavors that dance in your mouth! After this, came the dates. Oh, the dates. Stuffed with chorizo and swimming in a unforgettable red pepper sauce, they truly are a stand out as all the other reviews seem to also claim.  Our last two dishes were the flatbread and wood-fired squid. The flatbread was delicious and is enough for 4-5 people. We had leftovers that made for a great snack the next day. I was so full by the time the squid came that I really didn't get to enjoy it and don't feel that I can honestly critique it as I struggled to put a bite in my mouth. Too much burrata, I think. Avec is a no reservation place and often has a wait, but we walked right in on this particular Monday night at 10pm and had our choice of table.

The hangar steak was excellent, even though I normally do not like things that are on the rare side. Our large plates were the fish and the orrecchiette with duck.

2012-07-09,4.0,"kennethtiongeats.wordpre… Avec | Chicago | Menu Avec's been around for more than 7 years, and it has a disarmingly informal feel, even as one of the city's top restaurants. I had the pleasure of stepping inside on a Wednesday dinner (the Mediterranean restaurant doesn't take recommendations) burrata with fresh tarragon and pickled trio of ramps, golden beets and rhubarb (4.25/5) Burrata had an outer wall of solid mozzarella goodness, and an inner molten core of liquid mozzarella. Pickled vegetables formed a sour counterpoint to the burrata. Good dish. from wikipedia:  Burrata is a fresh Italian cheese, made from mozzarella and cream. The outer shell is solid mozzarella while the inside contains both mozzarella and cream, giving it an unusual, soft texture. It is also defined by some sources as an outer shell of mozzarella filled with butter or a mixture of butter and sugar. It is usually served fresh, at room temperature. The name ""burrata"" means ""buttered"" in Italian. chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce (4/5) on yelp, chorizo-stuffed dates was often mentioned as avec's speciality. the inside of the dates was incredibly meaty, with smoked bacon and a large helping of chorizo. THe tomato sauce was very good for dipping. whipped brandade with garlic bread and chives (3.5/5) brandade was a good whipping of fish and olive oil, and this paired well with garlic bread. I was also recommended to eat this with apples. from wikipedia: Brandade is an emulsion of salt cod and olive oil eaten in winter with bread or potatoes. In French it is sometimes called Brandade de Morue and in Spanish it can be called Brandada de bacalao ('morue' being the French name for salt cod and bacalao the Spanish one). roasted whitefish with lentils, spanish chorizo, endive and shallot (4.75/5) Whitefish was perfectly browned on one side without being overcooked. The scraped lines on its browned side made it look endearingly like toast. Perfectly textured, and served on a delicious mix of lentils, spanish chorizo, endive and shallot - which tasted and looked a bit like cassoulet chicago.eater.com/archiv… avecrestaurant.com/menus…",0.9934,0.854,0.146,0.0,0.4121044546850998

But to me that adds to the charm of this place: you are getting high quality food but in a very relaxed yet fun atmosphere. Definitely don't go if you are in a rush, or someone who has a problem with communal seating.  I have been here many times and usually love every dish. Although there have been a couple missteps (wood-fired squid that is really a pasta dish??), but just like most restaurants, sometimes you just order the wrong thing.  The menu changes often, which is a plus but also a minus if they remove one of your favorites (hopefully the mussels with chorizo make it back one day!). To be extremely repetitive, the Bacon-wrapped dates are seriously delicious, and definitely worth the hype.

2012-06-21,3.0,"There are many things that Avec is doing right, however, it's the things they're doing wrong (IMO) that's keeping me from giving them 4-5 stars. First off, the atmosphere is very interesting. You're literally dining in a wooden box... not in a bad way, but the entire interior is made out of wood. My friend and I were seated promptly at the edge of a table (there's communal seating here) and we were the only ones at the table at the time. Our server gave us some recommendations off of the menu and since we weren't terribly hungry, we ordered a small plate of the roasted whitefish ($13) and the roasted pork shoulder ($21). A few minutes later a couple was seated at the other end of our table.  So thankfully we weren't starving because our food took a long time to come out. I started to think that they forgot about us because the couple that came after us got their food long before we did. The roasted whitefish came out first and I thought it tasted fantastic. It was cooked to perfection and the veggies under it went very nicely with the fish. The roasted pork shoulder probably came out 15-20 minutes after we finished with the fish which I thought was unusually long. In the meantime while we were waiting, they seated a party in the middle of the table which I thought was kind of awkward to ask people who were already dining to get up and let people in. I didn't really mind but I could see how some people would mind if they were in the middle of dining.  So when the pork shoulder finally came out, it appeared to be stew-like. The meat fell off the bone with ease, it was very flavorful, and the portion was very generous. After a while though the flavor was starting to get boring because it was the only thing at our table. It would've been nice to have a couple dishes at the same time so you can mix up the different flavors in your mouth. On top of that, I felt the service was lacking. Avec didn't seem very welcoming at all since our server just took our order and brought us our bill.

Chorizo stuffed, bacon wrapped medjol dates. They're HUGE. And Delicious. And they put crack in the red sauce. I swear. A light arugula salad with hazelnuts. Good, but not as good as Purple Pig's version. House marinated olives - a great starter... i loved all the different types of olives. Hangar steak - perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful. Burrata - who doesn't like melty and creamy mozz cheese? And a couple of the seasonal specials. So you can see we ate plenty. We were all groaning about how full we were, when we realized that we had one more dish coming to us, and that it was a LARGE plate (so was the hangar steak). We thought... ""maybe we should cancel the order if they haven't cooked it yet!"" but as soon as we said that, out comes this round, flat, crispy looking bread. And despite how full we all were, we all started salivating. The focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, and truffle oil is probably at least 10 inches in diameter. Sliced in half horizontally, and slathered with cheese and drizzled with truffle oil. IT WAS PERFECTION. This dish is what I'd go back to Avec for, because despite having a lovely time, it's not quite easily accessible for me, there's not much nearby, and I prefer dishes at other tapas restaurants. But none of the other tapas restaurants has focaccia with cheese and truffle oil. Tips: We came for an early dinner. Walked right in and we were immediately seated. If you've been out and about and you're not that hungry, maybe you don't mind waiting. But I hate waiting. I'd rather eat early, relocate, and resume the cocktail consumption elsewhere.

Since I knew they did not take reservations, you'll need to sit outside or go somewhere and have them call you. During the wait, I met a good couple of out of town foodies like myself. Ordered a wine since they basically don't serve any martinis. 45 minutes into my wait, they got seated. Waited another 25 minutes and noticed that there was on open table near the entrance and asked the maitre'd what was the status of my seat. She told me that she was waiting for a place to open up at the bar but at this point I wanted to get to eating so she ended seating me to the couple I met outside. They told that the end of their table near the back had been opened since they sat down.  I would have appreciated some sort of notification that something had opened up. Well on to eating. Chorizo dates: I can understand why many yelpers enjoy this.  Sweet, salty, spicy.  I thought it was pretty good.  But one of the couple was not too impressed and likened it to a sweet meatball.  Yeah I could see his point but still think it is worth trying. The pacing of long the next course took was quite long.  I finished my dates and it at least another 15 minutes before the next course came out.  In the meantime, the couple shared some of their squid.  The consistency was pretty soft and bland. My carpaccio steak sandwich came out next.  Good texture and a nice contrast between the softness of the meat and the crunchiness of the bread. The daily selection of salumi was decent. Next course, a generous portion of pork shoulder.  Well made but not extraordinary.  Pretty tender with good flavor but when I sampled the couples's hanger steak, theirs was dissappointing tough. Pretty decent value but for the time, food pacing, quality, and balance of flavor, I would advise going to either Girl in the Goat (if you're not into communal seating and can get a reservation) or the Purple Pig or the Publican (if communal seating is okay for you) at a similar pricepoint.",0.9957,0.803,0.168,0.029,0.49857881136950905

Other times my dinner plans fell through. Well I finally conquered Mt. Everest last night, partly because I work right down the damn street. I now realize it was God sparing me the calamity. Despite and possibly as a result of the immense build-up of self-implicated hype, words cannot explain how disappointed I was in Avec. We started out with the bacon wrapped dates, which I thought were great but it went downhill from there.  We also ordered the hangar steak, which took FOREVER to come out. When it finally arrived I fathom that maybe they thought we ordered steak carpaccio, as it looked like they tried to cook it with a flashlight. It was completely raw, and a horrible cut with gristle running throughout which was amplified by its rawness. Highly disappointed. We order the ""deluxe"" focaccia as the other two dished didn't do much for us. I'm surprised Yelpers actually like this stuff. I was expecting something flavorful and this dish was absolutely monotone. I mean it tasted like I was eating plaster. Liquid caulk sandwiched between two slices of cardboard. I didn't taste any herbs, or salt, or cheese. It tasted like nothing. Nothing at all. I'm wondering if they forgot the other ingredients. I wanted to give the place 3 stars just because I've grown a bias in my mind for wanting to like it so much. But as I wrote out my review, it started to hit me just how bad this experience was.

2012-05-09,5.0,"Avec is my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  This is a place for people who love food, plain and simple.  And for this price point, I don't believe I've ever had better (in America, that is).  I've been to avec more times than I can count.  I've tried almost everything on every menu, and while sometimes one or two dishes may be underwhelming I am still astonished that Chef Koren Grieveson can deliver new surprises after all these years. Let's start with the standards: 1) Bacon wrapped dates - They're good everywhere, but decadent at avec,  stuffed with house made chorizo and drenched in a spicy sweet red sauce. 2) Focaccia - The best thing I've ever put in my mouth.  Indescribable. 3) Pork shoulder - The meat just falls apart.  It's warm and rich, perfect for a Chicago winter. Now I'm going to *beg* for the return of these: 1) Hangar steak with grilled bone marrow - I miss this so much.  The fatty marrow scooped on top of the hangar steak made my life complete. 2) Anything with cured meat - My favorite so far was the one with prosciutto and lavender and grilled peaches. 3) Brussel sprouts - To be fair, every vegetable is beautifully constructed with the perfect balance of salt and citrus.  It may sound simple, and that's why it's so elegant. My favorite right now? Burrata - If you've never had this ""cheese"" before, this is a great place to get it. I also want to add that I love the waitstaff.  My favorite hostess is Liz, who wears very cool earrings.  The chefs wear bandanas to hold back their hair, and they are rock stars in the kitchen.  The wine selection is very reasonable, beer is unique, and the bartenders know how to pair them. In the spirit of objectivity, reasons not to go: 1) You have back problems - the seating can be rather uncomfortable. 2) You require a reservation 3) You like me so much that you're keeping the place free for me.",0.9979,0.744,0.233,0.022,0.624017649017649

I inhaled those lightly fermented tasting sprouts, which were just reminiscent enough of actual kimchi that even a Korean food lover doesn't have to be hesitant to try it. Dessert was a hazlenut cake with a dollop of creme fraiche and a coffee heavy Hell's Black Intelligenser. Dark beer galore. An excess of HBI meant we got some extra pours, perfect for a midday buzz.

They have their regular items such as their chorizo stuffed dates, which I would say ORDER. In a HEART beat. First of all, the portions are MORE than generous! Plus the dish comes with this effing great crust of bread!! You're going to wipe the rest of the sauce off with it. The dish isn't super sweet, in fact it's a bit spicy but you can taste the subtle sweetness from the dates, the spice from  the piquillo pepper and the tomato just has this very hearty taste with it. It comes with 4 large sized chorizo sized meatballs. The marinated hanger steak is surprisingly tender and flavorful. They change the marinade and accompanying items with it, but each time it's really worth it. The portion is definitely big enough for 2. It's a shame they didn't have their bone morrow when I went a few days ago because this is my favorite place to order that dish! The bread they serve it with is lightly buttered and crisp, the portion of morrow is good ( you can always do with more ), and the herbs they give you add that light and earthy kick. We just tried the Sunchoke corstini with salmon roe. If you're not a huge fan of salmon roe like me, you HAVE TO ORDER THIS. First of all, the brown butter adds this insane sweet coat so the roe isn't that pungent and the sunchoke break is MIND BLOWING!!? WHAT THE HELL IS SUNCHOKE AND WHY HAVEN'T I HAD MORE OF THIS?!

For someone uncomfortable with squid, this may have been the dish, since the squid was covertly hidden along with the fideo, I couldn't quite appreciate it without feeling overwhelmed. CRISPY DUCK The only crispy part was probably the squash and mustard greens. Very simple and refreshing. Although I'd wished that the duck was emphasized more within the dish.  The meal felt like a rollercoaster between high intensity flavors to the mute and subtle. As many have noted, the seating is a bit awkward. Fortunately or unfortunately, we were seated at the end. I don't mind community seating, but it takes away from the experience when I have to get up every so often when someone wants to get in or out. I would come back, but only for the medjool dates.",0.6672,0.914,0.048,0.038,0.5934340659340658
2012-02-16,5.0,"Avec is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. From the classy yet friendly communal seating, to the fresh, innovative, share-able and utterly devour-worthy menu, Avec is worth going back to again and again and again. Highlights/tips: + ""deluxe"" focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, truffle oil - woahmygod so good, and huge, so be prepared to either split between 4 people or take some home. Tip - if you are ordering something flavor-punched like the bacon dates, I would suggest eating the focaccia first so that your palate doesn't get too overcrowded to appreciate the taleggio-truffle awesomeness. + chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon - this version of bacon-wrapped dates will pummel the *** out of any bacon-wrapped date you've had elsewhere. Really, it's like a chorizo-date-meat-heaven-ball wrapped in smoky bacon bathed in tomato-pepper sauce. 4 generous portions, you *could* split between 4 but really, you'll want 2 to yourself. + daily antipastos usually feature a nutty grain (think farro, wheatberry) with grilled vegetables and other tasty add-ins. Nice dish to lighten things up after the 2 aforementioned stomach and taste bombs. + get. the. chocolate. crisps.  I don't care how full your belly is with focaccia and dates and pork shoulder. You will see the heaping plate of chocolate crisps coming your way and think, oh my god who in the world would eat that much chocolate? no way! and then you will sprinkle sea salt on the chocolate. and then you will eat every single last chocolate crisp until the plate is spanking clean. Go on an off night (e.g. Monday) if you hate waiting for seating. Street parking outside. Push to open the inner door (you will empathize with my confusion if you've seen the door). Get a bottle of wine and enjoy your company. Get ready to have Avec's dates and focaccia dancing around in your dreams.

2012-02-16,3.0,"Visited on a Wednesday night around 10 in the evening. There was no wait. We were immediately seated right next to a couple who were on their ""official first date."" How do I know this? Because you're literally rubbing shoulders with your neighbors..the restaurant has communal table seating. We did not know this until we got there and I thought to myself ""how Benihana-esque."" It was pretty awkward listening to the guy trying to flirt with his date. He was corny as hell. I mean it was really difficult for me to eat because I was cracking up in my head.  Literally, I was snickering to myself, hoping they didn't see me laughing at them. Not to mention, it was difficult to hold a conversation because of the close distance to other people who are holding their own conversations. I wasn't sure if I should have joined the couple's conversation or texted my boyfriend in order to communicate with him. I also wasn't sure if it would have been okay to try our neighbors' food haha. With that said, the place is quaint and simple. You could google image search  the place if you wanna see how it looks. It's a small place, almost everything is made up of wood except for the back wall stocked with glass bottles--well thought out touch! You could eat at the bar. The chairs reminded me of kahon drum boxes. The bench was made of wood as well. I think the point is for your ass to be uncomfortable so that you could eat and leave right away since it's a small place and that would shorten the wait lines. I have never dined in a place like this before. I appreciated the design. The food we ordered was excellent! We had the wood-fired flatbread with tuna, mozzarella, tomatoes, and watercress. This was like a pizza. At first I didn't know that it was tuna and thought they were anchovies. The concept seemed similar. However, it was beautiful and delicious! The colors, taste, light and fresh vegetables, and flatbread were spot on!  We also had the sunchoke crostini with salmon roe, breakfast radish, and brown butter. This was the highlight of my dining experience. I love salmon roe to begin with, and the only way I've had it was in temaki or sushi. So this was a pleasant surprise for me. I was in heaven for a little bit. It was pretty grand. The presentation, the textures, the different elements, and the overall taste pushed me over the edge. Great plate!!! We also ordered the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce. I didn't read the description when we ordered. I just saw the words ""dates"" and ""bacon"" and immediately nodded. I'm a big fan of bacon-wrapped dates and thought, ""Okay you could never go wrong with them."" But this placed killed it. And not ""killed it"" like ""it was to die for."" I mean killed it as in ""ruined the dish"" and ""messed up my perception of bacon-wrapped dates forever."" Honestly, does the recipe call for one whole shaker of salt? The chorizo/sausage/longaniza was ehhh. I felt that the meat and sauce were overpowering. It tasted like salty spaghetti sauce and meatballs. I couldn't take any more bites. I removed the chorizo and sauce off my plate and just ate the dates and bacon. I thought that bacon was supposed to give the ""salty"" taste on the dish but apparently this was not the case--the sauce and chorizo did. Oh and my boyfriend didn't even know there were dates stuffed in the meat. That's how overpowering it was!  And last, we had the crispy whitefish with pistachio puree, marinated beets, and grapefruit. It was a-ok. It was a unique combination of different textures and tastes. I was a bit confused. The whitefish was cooked to the tee. I loved the soft meat of the fish and the crisp outer layer on the sides. YUM! The puree was excellent with the fish! I didn't understand the beets. It brought out a metallic taste and reminded me of canned cranberry. I only had a few bites of that. And the grapefruit was a nice touch to the combination. It had that bittersweet taste and brought out the flavor of the dish overall. Yay! Another thing...I wasn't that pleased with the service. A lady took our order. Another lady gave us our bill. One busboy changed our plates and silverware. Another busboy brought out our food. Another busboy refilled our waters. It's great to see they work as a team but who does our tip go to? I was hoping it went to our busboys because they were really serving us hand and foot, while the ladies didn't do that much work. It seemed like they were just standing around. There was even a time when I asked for something to the lady who was just standing there doing nothing, and she ordered a busboy to do it. =( Truth: If you want privacy when you converse, this is not the place. Also, please don't come here on a first date. It's so awkward for other people to listen to you try and impress your date!",0.9954,0.844,0.11,0.047,0.5864904295051356
2012-02-15,5.0,"I had the opportunity to fly out to Chicago from LA for a whopping $70, thanks to Groupon. But honestly, I would pay the full roundtrip flight just to go back to Avec. Yes, my dining experience was just THAT good.  The restaurant is definitely smaller than most. It got a little cramped when we were waiting for our table. However, they worked with the space that they had. The decor and the ambiance really complimented the restaurant. We were seated at a communal table and I've noticed that communal tables are on the rise. I don't really know how I feel about this situation just because I like my breathing room (only child syndrome). But, I guess, it does save a lot of space and it's a plus if you have cool neighbors. On the other hand, it can be disastrous if your neighbors are staring you down with confusion because all you can do is nod and moan simultaneously to your friends, pointing at the dish that just changed your life. Luckily, our pretentious neighbors left and I was back in my zone, just eating. And nodding. Don't judge me, you know you do the same. Holler back. What what. Of course, we ordered everything we desired on the menu. We started off with the small plates: the signature chorizo stuffed dates and the wood-fired squid dish. The tastes of the charred smoky bacon with the sweet dates go hand in hand and I was thoroughly impressed with the fusion of flavors.  The squid dish was my absolute favorite small dish. The squid was cooked to perfection, the tomatoes were fresh, and the fennel was crunchy but not too crunchy. Everything went perfectly together.  On to the big plates that we ordered: the whole roasted fish with fennel seed, wood-oven roasted pork shoulder, wood-fire flatbread with tuna, and half chicken roasted with pomegranate and asparagus. My favorite main dish was definitely the whole roasted fish. I died. The skin of the fish was crunchy and slightly salty. The fish itself was extremely moist.  The pork shoulder was tender and the beans added flavor to the dish. The flatbread was mediocre. It was not my favorite for the mere fact that the taste of the tuna was extremely prominent. Lastly, the half chicken plate was absolutely great. The chicken was moist and the pomegranate went so well with the dish. The combination was to die for.  You didn't think we stopped there did you? Of course not. I would never walk out of a restaurant without cleaning my palette with something sweet, even if I was dying from being overstuffed. There is always a compartment for desserts. Therefore, I ordered the cappuccino paired with the hazelnut crumb cake and the housemade chocolate crisps. Everything was divine. The crumb cake was not too sweet and the hazelnuts were the icing on the cake, literally. The crisps were thin and just delightful.  Even though I eat out pretty frequently, I haven't had a great dining experience like this in a while. There isn't a surprise factor in most restaurants I go to. Avec pleasantly surprised my taste buds and I hope that it will do the same for you.",0.9982,0.777,0.192,0.032,0.572834274952919

2012-02-09,3.0,"I'm going to go against the grain and give Avec a mediocre review. Don't get me wrong, the food is quite good. And it's not really as expensive as I was led to believe. For a party of three, with one bottle of wine, six small dishes, and one desert, it was $140 after tip. Obviously that is not dirt cheap but it's also not crazy high, given the quality of the food. My complaints come from the seating. I am not opposed to the ""group dining"" atmosphere, where you sit at large tables and are practically in direct contact with your neighbors (even if they are strangers). My main problem comes with the seating itself. The seats along the wall are very uncomfortable. You sit on a wood bench and the backrest is straight up-and-down wood. I know this looks neat and is trendy nowadays, but unfortunately that doesn't make it any more comfortable. And for the people sitting opposite the wall, they get to sit on an uncomfortable wood block with no backrest whatsoever. I am someone who has some back problems, so neither of these seating options is acceptable for me. Also, the legroom is nonexistent, so that leads to more discomfort. Finally, as other reviews have mentioned, it is very loud and crowded inside the restaurant.  At one point, one of my companions said ""Just to clarify, we all are incredibly uncomfortable right now, right?"" After we asked him ""WHAT????"" about three times since we couldn't hear him initially, we all agreed that we were uncomfortable - even the people without the back problems. When it's all said and done, I would recommend the food from Avec, and the service is good too. but I would say that if uncomfortable seating bothers you, stay away.",-0.9651,0.757,0.098,0.145,0.6108854166666667

2012-02-04,5.0,"avec: French for ""with"" The concept of this Paul Kahan's sophomore restaurant is pretty obvious given the translation. There's a sense of community where sharing is encouraged. The decor is stunning. I couldn't take my eyes of of the walls, ceiling, kitchen, outside, everything. It's no wonder avec was the winner of the James Beard Award for Restaurant Design AND (yes AND) Restaurant Graphics (2005). The restaurant is small, so prepare to wait during peak hours. Otherwise, go early or go really late. As mentioned, dining at avec is meant to be a shared experience. We were given the following tip: order two small dishes, one large dish, and a dessert (for two people). This doesn't seem like a lot of food, but depending on what you ordered (or if you eat like a champ), it will do the job. After some conversation with our server, we decided to order the chorizo-stuffed dates (small), crispy whitefish (small), and the roasted pork shoulder. Let's start with the dates..easily the best dates I've eaten ever. Ever. Sweet, salty, soft. The whitefish was complemented with a pistachio puree, beets and grapefruit. The beets added a subtle earthy sweet flavor, in addition to the citrus, which also had hints of sours. The pork shoulder looked like it wasn't going to fill the two of us..wound up being difficult to finish. Not because it was disastrously tasteless, but it was deceivingly large. In fact, this pork shoulder is classic comfort food. Served with beans, carrots and a salsa-ish sauce, this well-seasoned piece of Miss Piggy had to have been cooked for a long time, because she just fell apart by the touch of a fork. At the end of the day, though, dessert at avec is aight...but next door is what's up.

Also had a pasta dish that was really good but nothing too crazy and amazing. The whitefish turned out to be a star to me, cooked to a perfect golden brown crisp on one side served atop a pistachio spread with grapefruit.

I've often found this appetizer at other restaurants to be way way too sweet, but Avec has found perfection in this dish. The prices won't break the bank, but the wait can be forever on a weekend night (an hour and half!). So I recommend giving them your phone number and heading over to Sepia (around the corner) for some delish drinks!  We also tried the foccacia with taleggio cheese and truffle oil. I'm always over the moon about truffle, but this dish was sorta drippy but still tasty.  Pork shoulder was cooked well (tender!) but a little too meaty/porky for me--would try something else next time.

On Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend, I spoke to Liz, who is the general manager, and she apologized the smoke and offered to compensate us for our dry cleaning of our coats and send us a certificate. In December I emailed her my receipt, heard nothing.  Emailed again last week and still have not heard anything.  So basically, I feel she broke her promise and that this is  very poor customer service on her part.  Therefore, this is why this restaurant only gets 3 stars.  They really need to improve their customer service especially since customers complained and follow-thru on their promises.  Not break them.   And because of this, I highly doubt I will ever go back to Avec.",0.5682,0.863,0.078,0.059,0.49933333333333324

We knew they didn't take reservations so my husband and I went there at 5:30pm on Friday night, and didn't have any trouble getting a table. We shared 3 small plates and 1 large plate, plus two glasses of wine and 2 bottles of beer. The wine came in carafes that held about a glass and a half, so pretty decent for $11-13 each. The Atomium was really awesome Belgium beer, thick with a bit of honey and a crisp finish. Our meal consisted of chorizo stuffed dates, the whitefish, hanger steak, and the pork shoulder.  The 4 dates were the size of golf balls and stuffed with deliciously spicy chorizo, they were my husband's favorite. The whitefish was seared and seasoned to perfection. The hanger steak was my favorite, with a super flavorful crust and a medium rare center. By that point we were pretty satisfied and still had the pork shoulder left to go. It's unfortunate that it came at the end of our meal since we couldn't eat more than half of it it was so big. The pork just fell apart by itself and was wonderfully juicy. We were way too full after that and was sad that we couldn't get the cheese plate. I would totally suggest ordering less in the beginning if you are getting the pork shoulder for two people. Definitely going back for more!",0.9896,0.82,0.158,0.022,0.5579481792717086

We stopped by for a few small plates and a drink prior to eating at another nearby restaurant.  I didn't want to admit it at the time, but we would have probably been better off just staying at Avec.   The chorizo-stuffed dates with bacon were as good as they sound and were larger than you would imagine.  The salami plate was fresh and had a decent variety (generous portions of three different types).  We went with beer instead of wine and were not disappointed.  I was a little cautious when I found out they had no IPAs (or pale ales), but their Belgium selection was excellent (most were new to me).

The wine was just fabulous and complimented our bacon wrapped chorizo dates, hangar steak with melted bone marrow/lentils, and oven roasted squid fideus wonderfully. The downside? All these dishes were competing for attention and were a bit heavy handed in the seasonings but I would certainly vote them among some of the more flavorful and well cooked things I have had thus far in my life.

Not knowing much about the menu ourselves, Marcus was able to find the perfect plates for our group and apatite as well as pair it perfectly with the wine. Marcus is Incredibly knowledgeable of the wine they serve, to a point that would make a Frenchman go crying back into his mothers arms.  This was a few months ago but I remember the charizo stuffed dated with bacon, the clams and chili sauce (the wine pairing for that was amazing, had a great spice) and the Brusselsprout and brisket salad  (Marcus paired it with a rich leathery red that I cannot pronounce, it was one of the most savory glasses of wine I have ever had).

It is a pretty busy place, so you may have to wait for a seat, but we got lucky and were seated at the bar right away.   I would definitely recommend Avec for anyone who wants to take a girl out to impress her or even someone who just wants to sit at the bar and learn about wine.  I can't say much for the rest of the staff, because I didn't interact with them, but everyone there seemed incredibly happy to be there (which is definitely something you want in a restaurant!)",0.9958,0.792,0.202,0.006,0.5707199546485261

I think the issue was that my dining partner picked out all the items for us that night and passed up suggestions I made that I thought I'd like. Nonetheless, I wasn't impressed as I know all before me have been. When we got there around 830 on a weeknight, we actually had no wait! We were off to a good start. I'm not a fan of this type of seating where you are two inches away from the couple next to you but it seems that's a theme at Paul Kahan's restaurants (cue Publican & Blackbird). Our waitress was super duper nice so points for that. I came from a Sake tasting so was already in a spirited mood, I ordered a beer once sitting down at Avec. They were out of the first beer I ordered so I then went with Cerveja Sagres.   We started with the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce for $9. So many friends have told me how amazing the dates are and the friend I was with couldn't stop gushing about them before we arrived. I took one bite and my mouth was on fire. I'm admittedly very weak with spicy food but it was so strong on the dates that not only could I not taste any of the actual flavor to them but I couldn't taste any flavor at all in my next dish either. I was not into the dates at all and definitely will not get them again. We also got the Avec bread when we sat down and that was very fluffy & light, loved it. For our second plate, we got the marinated hanger steak with puy lentils, melted bone marrow, spinach, tomato, oranges and fried capers for $14. As I said, I really couldn't taste any flavor due to the dates but what I did taste was just mediocre. I was excited about this because who doesn't love bone marrow!? But alas, I was let down with it. For our third plate,  we got the wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with braised chestnuts and cabbage, parsnips and roasted apple for $21. This was the best dish of the night and I liked it but was not blown away. The pork was in a miso type of broth and by now I was able to taste flavor a bit again! For dessert we got the housemade chocolate crisps for $9. My favorite candy bar is a Crunch bar and this was like homemade giant sheets of Crunch bar! It was my personal favorite of the night plus it came in milk & dark chocolate! I would get this again in a second.

However, aside from a few new menu options and different place settings, Avec has risen from the ashes like a Phoenix and is just as good, if not better, as it always was.

I'm sorry but this is disgusting. And everyone tried that and said the same thing. We all gave it a shot but decided it was probably the worse dish yet. - Roasted pork shoulder.

2011-11-30,5.0,"Sometimes dining alone can be a scary thing... but one HUGE perk is that it's generally easier for staff to find you a seat at the bar.  When I asked how long it would take for ""just one,"" the hostess said she could get me in right away.  I felt a little guilty as we walked past a few groups who were waiting to be seated, but I was also pretty relieved since I was so hungry.  (Note: Something I noticed about dining with a group in big cities is you can't wait until you're actually hungry to go out to some trendy venue because you'll probably end up using some of your fat stores as you wait and give death stares to the now-sated diners lingering over their checks.) I don't know what I can say about the ""chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce"" that hasn't already been said.  Perhaps they're laced with crack because I could've kept on eating more--this was one of those hyped-about dishes that I actually found hype-worthy.  I love when food has salty, sweet, tangy, earthy, and spicy components, but I find it especially rare for all flavor components to not only be present, but robust and yet, balanced.  Dates aside, when is it not the case that bread + tomato sauce = tasty?  Even cafeteria pizza has its fan base... but I digress. I also ordered the ""marinated hanger steak with baby squash, asparagus, blueberry and bone marrow"" because sometimes you get those iron cravings, right?  Every part was well executed, but the bone marrow and blueberries were really the main things that pushed this dish into the realm of ""interesting.""  I feel for it... when you have those brilliant and addictive dates for an older sibling, you could be practically perfect but by comparison, you would still struggle in trying to fill their shoes.  Frankly, I could have forgone this in favor of a second helping of the dates. Since everyone already knows about the dates, I'll leave you with my thoughts on the less-mentioned dessert option that was available to me (but that I see was replaced with a chocolate mousse)--their white chocolate panna cotta with maple figs and walnut shortbread.  The panna cotta was flawless--rich in the way most creamy desserts are, but perfectly portioned and light textured so as to prevent you from getting that ""why did you let me eat this after I ate all that?"" feeling.  It gave such a pleasant mouthfeel that I was slightly saddened since I found only one whispery sliver of a delicious maple syrupy fig, mixed in with a small portion of sliced-up dried apricot.  As much as I like dried apricots, I found their chewy texture a little bit too much of a contrast when paired with the smooth panna cotta, because while the panna cotta dissolved into a practically literal sweet nothing, the nubby apricot pieces hung around--leaving an aftertaste that was more grocery store than luxury.  That tiny piece of fig that I tried had melted in my mouth alongside its white chocolate counterpart and I would have much preferred more of that.  The walnut shortbread added that touch of streusel-y charm that makes almost all creamy desserts even better, but it was also buttery enough to crumble away with the panna cotta.  If the mousse is as good, I'd try my hardest to save some room.",0.9975,0.816,0.15,0.033,0.5334183673469387
2011-11-25,5.0,"Full review blogged, dish highlights below: For the first dish of the evening we would receive ""Chorizo stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon, piquillo pepper tomato sauce, bread"" - a dish that not only wrapped perfectly sweet dates with bacon like many tapas restaurants, but also stuffed them with a substantial portion of smoky chorizo.  Simple, rustic, and with four to the bowl plus a chunk of warm bread to sop up the smoky sauce I enjoyed this dish just as much as I expected to and even our group member who doesn't really fancy dates noted that he too found it quite good. For the second dish, ""Warm hen of the woods and shiitake mushroom salad with apple, red quinoa, dill, parmesan, sherry vinaigrette"" was pretty much exactly what you would expect and the sweet meets earthy admixture was nicely accented by the sharp points of the parmesan and the acid of the vinaigrette.  Always a fan of quinoa I particularly liked how the toothsome grain not only managed to balance everything out, but also how it absorbed a small bit of each flavor making for a wonderful taste even as we reached the bottom of the bowl. The third item arrived on a huge wooden board in the form of ""Deluxe focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, truffle oil, fresh herbs"" and although I enjoyed everything at Avec that evening this was by far and away my favorite.  Taking a different route to the spongy focaccia and serving it essentially as two individual flat breads sandwiching a medium-thick spread of the cheesy blend plus low notes of basil and parsley and heady top notes of truffle I immediately understood why Joshua had suggested we may have ordered too much; this was a whole lot of cheese and bread and we still had four plates to go, but working diligently the plate did eventually disappear - every single bite worth it. Slowly enjoying the focaccia the next two items were certainly not something I would have ordered on my own but much like everything else Avec did that evening there was a beautiful balance to the simplicity of each and although I would not order either again I did enjoy what I ate from each, the first ""Roasted Brussels sprouts with calf's liver, pumpernickel, butternut squash, almonds, mustard vinaigrette"" which featured the taste of caramelized sprouts in spades but used the sweetness of the squash and the bitters of the pumpernickel to help tame it a bit.  With the liver providing a slightly gritty proteinacious component and the almonds a bit of crunch I was additionally happy that the mustard tones were relegated to a small supporting role, though in later bites towards the bottom of the bowl would prove a bit much for me. At this point admittedly comfortably sated but certainly not full the next two plates to arrive would prove Joshua to be quite right in his assessment of our order, the biggest capacity consumer being ""Whipped Brandade with garlic bread and chives.""  Seemingly harmless in terms of portion but certainly not in terms of richness this take on the Provencal classic brandade de morue was simply astonishing in its careful balance of the salted cod, potatoes, whipped milk, garlic, and what I can only imagine to be an aged cheese plus olive oil.  Creamy and smooth as silk but easily a cup and half in portion and served with crispy garlic bread this was another course where I did a lot of the leg (stomach) work and although more than capable of holding my own at a dinner table this was simply a whole lot of dairy in a rather short time. For our final savory, the main course of the night would be ""Wood roasted pork shoulder with chestnut braised cabbage, parsnips, roasted apple, fresh herbs in puff pastry"" - a flavor profile no less transporting than the flavors at Next the night before as ""Pork Steak and Potatoes"" was one of my grandfather's favorite dishes to cook when he was alive.  Arriving in a large Staub pot and sizzling hot from the oven with golden pastry atop and at least half a pound of tender pork beneath the flavors in this dish were all spot on and entirely rustic without being heavy handed or clumsy in the least - a truly impressive dish and all the more so for the unique flavor of chestnuts infusing the broth and acting to foil the flavors of the cabbage. Not ready to admit defeat but certainly not in the position to consume more cheese my dining partners and I weighed the dessert options carefully and eventually settled on sharing one of the ""White chocolate panna cotta with maple figs and walnut shortbread"" three ways to see if sweets matched the savories in quality.  Generally not one to be ""wowed"" by panna cotta I will note that although small in size this particular dish did pack a lot of flavor into each bite and through such light use of chocolate the flavors each came through with aplomb, particularly the maple notes atop the sweetness of the figs.  While I personally prefer my desserts with a bit more texture this was a nice ""light"" finish to an otherwise heavy meal.",0.9993,0.808,0.173,0.019,0.5261904761904762

I had pretty high expectations for the chorizo-stuffed dates because everyone seemed to rave about them here.

Some of my favorites include the tomato salad (seasonal, no longer on the menu) - so simple but delicious.  I really liked their focaccia - the cheese had a great flavor and oozed out of the bread. However, I've had the focaccia twice now, so I don't know if I'll order it again...too many things to try. I don't eat pork, but my husband said the chorizo stuffed in dates was the best thing he ever ate. I also had a great pasta with mushroom ragu (seasonal, no longer on the menu)..I really enjoyed the texture of the pasta and the flavor of the mushrooms was excellent.

2011-11-08,4.0,"Came here on a Friday night which is pretty aggressive when they don't take reservations! The reason (I'm guessing) they don't take reservations is because the place is SO small, like teeny tiny! I think it probably seats no more than 50 people in the whole restaurant. They try to seat as many as possible by doing shared tables, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it works out OK. So we got there at 6:30, and the nice thing is that they take your phone number to call you when your table is almost ready. I definitely suggest going a few blocks down Randolph to the Haymarket Pub & Brewery (which will also be crowded) to grab a beer. They have an awesome selection and it's a cool place.  If it's not too cold of a night, you can also order drinks and stand outside by the heaters. They have a really great wine list ranging in all prices - we actually got two bottles of Tempranillo for $19 each (which is hard to find in the west loop). We ended up getting seated at 8pm, so 1.5 hour wait. On to the food which definitely gets FIVE stars. A group of us four girls shared: * The focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, truffle oil and fresh herbs: SO good and a really good size... we all got 3 pieces each * Wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with puff pastry, chestnut braised cabbage and roasted apple: SO tender and delicious. It comes out in a mini crock-pot and you can definitely tell they cook it for several hours * Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce: MUST GET THESE, they are absolutely delicious. It only comes with four ""meatballs"" so you may need two orders because you will definitely want more * Marinated hanger steak with puy lentils, melted bone marrow, spinach, tomato, oranges and fried capers: Also so delicious and perfectly cooked with great flavor I recommend all four dishes above. We were all full after sharing between the four of us, and the price was totally reasonable! Our whole bill (with a bottle of wine) for 4 people was $99. The only thing that knocked it down one star was the size of the place and long wait, and the server.

However, the only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars was the 2 hour wait.  Avec is another restaurant that has joined the growing trend of not allowing reservations.  I get it.  It builds a buzz and makes the place look jumping.  But since Avec has no bar, they make you wait in a little fenced in area on the sidewalk.  Not bad if the weather is decent but can't imagine too many people would want to wait out there in February, even with the heat lamps.  Was the food worth the wait?

The dinner went horribly wrong after that.  Even though we had ordered the brandade and the squid at the same time, we waited at least a half hour for the squid.  When is arrived it was so over spicy (and don't get me wrong, I love spicy) that it totally burned out our taste buds for anything else.  Now since the squid was taking so long we ordered the salmon while we were waiting as the next dish.  It came at the same time as the squid. Go figure.  The problem was that they forgot to cook it.  It was completely raw on the inside.  Raw is okay if it is sushi, but not in this dish.  It was gross.  Luckily the waitress noticed that we had cut into the salmon and just left it.  We didn't have to send it back, she noticed the orange, raw flesh and suggested she take it back to have it cooked a little more.  When it came back, it was very good.

I was traveling alone in Chicago and hadn't made a reservation ahead of time, but they seated me at the bar in the 9pm hour on a Wednesday, for which I'm grateful.  Ambiance is different than what you might expect from a French-oriented establishment - quite urban. Metal bar, all wood walls, shared bench tables. If you were looking for an intimate, white table cloth kind of place, this ain't it. The music in the background fits the overall vibe, with house and hip hop cycling through. Avec is known for small plates and sharing. As I was alone, though, the water recommended starting with a small plate and going for a main. Started with the Antipasto of the day, which was roasted golden beets, siagarello, champagne orange vinaigrette -- beets were incredibly fresh, but overall taste was not wowing. Taste was definitely helped by some chard that was snuck in there. Pork shoulder ended up as the real star. Firstly, this was a massive portion - when some of my coworkers came a few weeks ago they shared this amongst four of them. The dish came with some amazing local carrots and served with a basil pistou (basically French pesto without nuts), which cut through the savory meatiness in a perfect way. Not known to be When I was about halfway through the dish, I felt full and considered stopping. However, the diminishing return on the shoulder was so low - the light jus kept the remainder hot, and I felt as if I just started eating a new dish!  If I weren't stuffed from downing the full pork shoulder, I would have certainly taken aim at the panna cotta. Next time Avec, next time.",0.9859,0.815,0.142,0.043,0.4013755062142159

Skip the focaccia if you don't want to fill up on it...cause the portion is huge.  On the other hand, that truffle oil is to die for.

2011-09-20,4.0,"Mr. Kahan exceeds all expectations! First walked in and instantly loved the atmosphere - the all-wooden interior makes the place feel like an upscale boxcar, and you almost can't notice the unthinkably small kitchen behind the bar. Waiters are clad in soccer polo shirts with ""avec"" written on the back, which I personally found interesting. A truly sleek restaurant.  The food was, for the most part, delicious - bacon-wrapped, chorizo stuffed dates may be the best bites in Chicago, the brandade was delectably fishy and creamy, and the braised pork shoulder was almost impossibly tender and juicy - like love in meat form. The signature focaccia (served Ligurian style with ricotta in between two layers of flaky crust) was a nice dish, although I'd only advocate ordering it in a group of 4 or more people, as we thought it was a little overwhelming. The octopus with chickpeas was perfectly seasoned and very unique; I found the chickpeas undercooked, but I confess that this is likely due to my hummus fanaticism. The tomatoes in the heirloom and white anchovy salad were multicolored and perfectly ripe, although some in the party thought it contained too much fennel and not enough anchovy. However, I loved it. The service is five star service, if not six star service. One member of our party was about an hour late, and while they obviously couldn't seat us before our party was complete, the hostess made an extra effort to get us seated as soon as he arrived, and the bartender (although I'm sure she was miffed in actuality) displayed no disappointment when we sat at the bar for an hour and ordered 2 drinks in total. Once seated, the waiter was informative, and attentive without being overbearing. The meal felt relaxed despite the somewhat crowded and chaotic atmosphere. Pricing was appropriate - this was very high quality food, and we certainly paid for it, but it definitely didn't break the bank. We ate more food than recommended and got out for around $35 each, (sans alcohol, including tax and tip) In summary: Avec deserves its reputation as one of Chicago's finest options.

Sat at the bar at Avec alone when on business, but still wanted to try as many dishes as possible so the bartender was nice enough to offer me half portions of the dates and pasta dish. **cantaloupe salad with mizuna, grapefruit and spicy mustard vinaigrette- this was by far the worst dish of the evening. The salad was so drenched in dressing that it was almost inedible and souplike. This cause all of the canteloupe and grapefruit to be very soggy, and the vinaigrette was not spicy in the least. **chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce - these are amazing. the dates look like they are on steroids-they are about 5 times  the size of dates I have been able to find at any NYC market. really a perfect tasting appetizer. The taste of bacon is mild. One full order has 4, so i reccomend sharing with one other person because 2 was the perfect amount for one person. **marinated hanger steak with baby squash, asparagus, blueberry and bone marrow - cooked perfctly, nice flavors, beautiful colors on the plate. **Mushroom pasta dish- the half order of this was still enough to feed several people. Very Rich sauce, but the homemade pasta was hearty enough to hold its own with the sauce.

When my bf and I decided to take an extended weekend trip to Chicago, first thing I did was research all the places I wanted to eat. Obviously in 3 days we didn't get to go everywhere on my list, but Avec made the cut and I'm glad it did.  Per many Yelp reviews as well as the recommendation of our waitress we went with the favorites: focaccia, chorizo stuffed dates, hanger steak, pork shoulder, as well as a cherry tomato and kale antipasto we threw in. By far the focaccia and the dates were the highlights of the evening. Focaccia - so simple but so freaking tasty! The cheese, the truffle oil, the herbs, everything in perfect proportions. I could have just eaten this and walked away happy. Then on to the dates- I mean sweet and salty wrapped with bacon how could that not be delicious. A real star.  Hanger steak - well cooked but nothing extraordinary, I may or may not order again. Our last main dish  was the pork shoulder and I'm sad that we finished with this. This was the only dish that I actually considered sub par. Maybe it was an off night for the pork shoulder (others seem to rave about it) but both my bf and I were very much underwhelmed. Very tender but lacking in flavor. Even when eating a complete bite with everything else it came with it seemed like it needed copious amounts of salt or some other seasoning. Disappointing after everything else and all the good reviews. To finish we got dessert, the affogato- my bf's choice. It was good but I'd think that'd be hard to mess up. Wine list - pretty extensive and very reasonable (we got a bottle). I think for the quality of the food the prices are extremely reasonable.

We walked in at 9:30pm on a Friday night, and were told it would be an hour wait. We weren't starving, so this was fine by us. We ordered a bottle of wine in the outdoor waiting area (there were about 4 other groups waiting out there as well). But by the time our bottle came, our table was ready! Somehow the hour-long wait was only 15 minutes, so that was a nice surprise!  The whole restaurant decor is long, light wood panels - very cool look. The seating is family style, so hopefully you like your neighbors you get sat with. We were sitting in between two groups and both were nice. One guy even shared some of his octopus dish with my husband :)  OK, let's get to the good stuff...The Food:  - Every single person in the restaurant orders the chorizo stuffed dates. Even if it kills you to be a follower, you must order them, they are the star dish of the restaurant. The stuffed dates are quite large, so even though they only come 4 for an order, they are delicious and worth the price! We called them meatballs on accident twice, because that's what they look and taste like. Really amazing meatballs. The bowl of dates is served with bread, which we dipped in the ""piquillo pepper-tomato sauce"" - this sauce was incredibly flavorful and had just the right amount of spice.  - Next we received the ""sockeye salmon with sweet corn, lima beans, market tomatoes and mojo de ajo."" The corn/sauce mixture was awesome, the salmon was well cooked and had a great crispy skin on top. Overall, we were very happy with this dish.  - For dessert, we got the ""buckwheat crepes with ricotta filling, goat's milk caramel and berries."" It's a small dessert, so don't expect to feed a table with one dessert. The goat's milk caramel was a really good, thick caramel drizzled over the crepes. I almost asked for more on the side, it was that good. The crepes don't have a ton of ricotta, which could be considered good or bad, depending on your favor of the cheese. I thought it could have used more berries on the top to add some tartness to contrast with the sweetness of the caramel.  Yes, we only ordered three dishes. We were stuffed, but very content and each dish we ordered was awesome.  I have only one compliant:  - The menu is small and doesn't offer a lot of vegetable dishes.

I found them underwhelming, but the pork shoulder I followed them with was the richest and tenderest thing I've ever eaten. Last night I wanted to start with the hangar steak with bone marrow. When I ordered the bartender suggested I order something else first due to the long cooking time for hangar steak. I found this curious since hangar steak is normally served rare or close to it. So I ordered the octopus with a wine pairing. I was served my white and immediately after the hangar steak arrived with it's red pairing. I set my white aside to warm while I dug into my hangar steak, and as I took my first bite the octopus arrived. Obviously this was annoying and awkward. The hangar steak was awesome, and was served with bone marrow since it's so lean. Next I ordered the whole roasted dorade. The best fish I've ever had. Unfortunately the server told me it was thoroughly de-boned, ""so dig in."" Upon doing so I found myself with a mouth full of sharp bone. It was great though. I sucked out the eyes, cleaned the collar, scooped out the brain cavity, and even ate the tail.  I finished with an assortment of Italian cheese, and the  white chocolate dessert.

The worst aspect of service was seating - while tables consist of the standard 4 chairs on the outside and 4 seats on a bench on the inside, the hostess seats couples across from one another instead of placing them next to each other (I get that this is optimal for sharing plates, but sharing plates between ur SO isn't hard to do either). This by itself isn't terrible, but my buddy not only sat at the head of the table but also had another table to his back, which resulted in his having to get up 3 times in the middle of our meal in order to let 3 separate couples get into the table next to us (on top of having to get up twice for the people sitting at our table).

2011-08-29,4.0,"This was the first restaurant that we tried in Chicago.  I had heard about it through Food Network and when I saw the Yelp ratings, I knew we had to go.  We almost walked right past the entrance, but luckily my SO saw it and figured out the way in.  It was very rustic looking, with everything in wood, which I loved.  The seating was long wooden benches, and you're sitting right beside your neighbour.  Luckily only one person needed to leave while we were sitting there, because I could see it getting a little frustrating if I had to get up multiple times through the meal.  It was an interesting concept, but perhaps not that practical.  I loved that all the food was prepared right in front of you in a long open kitchen, with a big wood stove.  Nothing to hide here!  The only slight negative about the atmosphere was that it was pretty loud.  Put a lot of people in a small space and I guess that's what happens! Our server suggested that for two people, we should order 3-4 dishes.  Since I always try to sample as many things as possible, we went with four.  We ordered the chorizo-stuffed dates (of course!), the hangar steak, the pork shoulder, and the focaccia bread.  Out first were the dates, which were my main reason for choosing this restaurant.  Being Canadian and a lover of Food Network, I've seen ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" many times and wished I could go to the restaurants they suggested.  And finally, there I was!  I'm not a big fan of dates usually, but these were fantastic.  Chorizo inside, bacon wrapped around them...what's not to love.  They were served in a lovely tomato-based sauce that was a perfect accompaniment.  I wished there were more than four!   Next came the focaccia.  A creamy cheese, fresh herbs, truffle oil...it was heavenly.  Unfortunately, it was also huge - about the size of a regular pizza.  We felt terrible that we couldn't finish it, but we knew we still had two dishes to come.  It started to dawn on us that perhaps the server had misguided us.  We probably would have been fine if we'd ordered three small dishes and one large, but we'd gone half and half, again based on her recommendation.  Really though, I can't complain when food tastes that good. The hangar steak was probably our favourite.  So flavourful and juicy, it was just absolutely delicious.  It came out pre-sliced which made it easy to share.  They cleared our dishes before the pork came out, and when it did we wondered why they hadn't left us our steak knives.  We only had our forks, and a spoon was in the dish of pork.  Very confused, I picked up the spoon - and the pork melted beneath it.  This was the most tender pork I'd ever eaten.  I didn't find that there was a lot of flavour, especially in the top parts that weren't in the juice, but it was still pretty good.   All in all, delicious food, and a nice but loud atmosphere.  I would probably try something new if I were to go back to Chicago, but that says more about the culinary options in the city than it does the restaurant.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone taking a trip there.",0.9984,0.767,0.186,0.046,0.5513407069121354

The chorizo-stuffed dates were hands down the best of the dishes we tried.  Savory, sweet, chewy.  It came with awesome bread, too.  One of my dining companions kept ogling every tray of dates/bread that passed by.   The hangar steak was good, but not that special.  We were initially excited about the bone marrow part, but it tasted kind of funny, in my opinion.  We also had one of their specials, a crispy rouget, which was okay, but we really picked it for the pickled chanterelles and the artichokes, which there weren't enough of.  Upon our waitress' rec, we also got the pork shoulder.  Mixed feelings about the pork shoulder.  It was really well done, I liked the basil pistou, and the black rice, but I felt it was way too much meat!  Even for three people.  Maybe we weren't hungry enough?  But all that grease of the pork should be balanced out better.  Maybe more rice, or something.  I guess that's what the baby carrots were for, but they felt like an afterthought. Still, a pretty solid, satisfying meal.  Maybe we didn't pick the best items.  Or maybe next time we'll just get two orders of dates.  Or three ;)",0.9942,0.762,0.227,0.012,0.5628845101258894

This was the dish of the night for me. My taste buds were calling an emergency conference call, figuring how to go about attacking this unusual and ridiculously fantastic collection of flavors. An order comes with four; consider ordering two dishes. As for the rest. The canteloupe salad was really good. The focaccia was fantastic, but be warned: one order could fill a hippopotamus. Deceptively filling. What was funny was that we ordered the focaccia, but so did the three other pairs of people at our table. (One probably would've been enough for the entire table!) The pork shoulder: extremely tender, huge portion, but a little bland. I wanted to love it. So you can't make RSVPs here. But we went at 6:30 PM on a Thursday night without a problem. So it's crowded. Okay, it gets loud, but honestly, you adjust and realize it's a super atmosphere; fun, lively, and, of course, delicious. And finally the wine. I let our waitress pair the wines for us. She did extremely well. You will be stuffed by the end of this meal. Prepare yourself. And you've been warned about the focaccia.

We ordered a few espressos and cognac (a pairing I had never tried) which was pretty interesting although the espresso was slightly burnt so that was a little disappointing.  In any case, we moved onto our appetizers and although I can't really recall what we had, I do recall the portions being small and the taste being subpar. What I do remember is my poor vegetarian friends waiting 45 minutes just to get a plate of pasta.

I especially loved their house special chorizo stuffed dates which were packed with delicious spiced chroizo! LOVED IT. We also their specials of the day - crispy sardines and california bass which were both perfectly cooked.  I also loved and now crave their chitarra with grilled fennel, guanciale and broccoli rabe which was their housemade pasta with what tasted like fried pieces of pork belly.

And as you're driving along, not really sure you're in the right place, seems a bit residential and quiet, all the sudden you come upon a few restaurants close together. So cute!  They didn't take reservations, so the wait was maybe an hour (we arrived at 9pm). There is a ""bar"" - though you can't actually see where the drinks come from inside, it's a great little area on the sidewalk for you to chat and have a drink. I can't quite describe, but I loved the ambiance. And it was a beautiful night and on a quiet block, really romantic.  We were seated at the ""chef's table"" - two spots at the bar right in front of the chef. So we got to see him in action the whole way through. I've always wondered if chefs enjoy having patrons chatting them up while they're trying to do their job. If the chef at Avec wasn't interested, he certainly didn't make it known. He was friendly, answered all our questions, and kept us engaged and happy. And all the while, he made food for everyone in the restaurant, all of it looking pretty spectacular!  We ordered the focaccia bread with truffle and ricotta cheese, chorizo stuffed dates, hanger steak with summer squash, and shaved brussels sprout salad. I'd say all were tremendous except the focaccia bread. It was much too large for two people (from the large plate menu, we should've paid more attention), and it was served after the other dishes since it took longest to bake. So by the time it was delivered, we were quite full and not interested in having what felt more like an appetizer-type dish. On the other hand, the other dishes were spectacular. My non-vegetable-loving BF was quite keen on the brussels sprouts salad, that says a lot on its own. The spicy sauce that came with the dates was so delicious I ended up dipping other foods in it as well. And we both loved the hanger steak (not so much the bone marrow that comes with, not quite our style).  I saw plenty of other great dishes go by that I hope to get if I return.

I have never tasted anything like it ... it was definitely the highlight of our dinner.  The flavors were very creative.  We also had the salmon as well as hanger steak, which were both really good.   The foccacia was gooey and good, but was not as special as the other dishes.  We had the foie gras, which my friend, a foie gras ""expert"", really enjoyed.  Overall, we enjoyed this restaurant very much.",0.9789,0.764,0.209,0.027,0.5188756613756612

2011-06-12,5.0,"Ok so about a month ago I went to Blackbird and had an incredible meal there. This meal was better, I believe. I came here on a Saturday night at 5:40 and I was worried because of the no reservation policy that I would have to wait quite a while. They seated me immediately. Very pleased with that. I was sat at the long bar which was nice (you were able to see the chefs prepare the food a little bit), but the seats got uncomfortable about 30 minutes into the meal. No biggie. After having a good amount of time to look at the menu I decided to order the Chorizo stuffed dates and the whipped brandade at the same time. The dates came out first. This was the first time I have ever had dates, I didn't know what to expect but based on the reviews of these babies I was confident. They were AMAZING! I thought of ordering them again but I wanted to continue to try new things. They had a little sweetness, and a little spiciness. They were also a little smokey  because of the chorizo. The only complaint I have with the dish is that I wish I had a little more sauce so I could use the bread to sop it up. The brandade came out once I was about to eat my last date so I was pleased with the fact that I didn't have to wait for it. I have never had salt cod before so again I didn't know what to expect. It was really tasty though, probably my favorite thing of the night. I don't really know how to explain it but it was creamy and rich with a nice fish flavor. The bread that came out didn't have its own flavors that over powered the fish spread but it was good bread that was grilled nicely. It had a nice chew, was crispy on the crust, and has a smokey char flavor. Makes me wish they served that quality of bread at Blackbird next door. As I was about to finish the brandade, I ordered the small plate hanger steak. The amount of time it took to come out was quite long and I thought about taking one star off of my rating but when the plate of food came, the flavors were well worth the wait. Very tender steak cooked medium rare to rare. The balsamic and basil mustard added a little bit of heat to the dish that was nice (it was a horseradish type heat). The grapefruit added a beautiful citrus flavor to the plate that I loved. I only wish there was another segment of the grapefruit because I almost ran out when I was eating the last piece of steak (and I don't even like grapefruit!). I finished the meal with their seasonal sorbet which was lemon and it came with two small, and fragile sugar cookies. Maybe the best sugar cookies i've ever had! I definitely recommend going with someone because I went by myself and these three small plates were almost too much for me. What I ate could have fed two people who were moderately hungry. The price was real good. With no drinks (just water) and including tax and tip I spent $50. I would recommend this place to everyone and hope to be back soon when I celebrate my birthday with my parents later this week! Quick edit: One thing that was a bit tricky was finding the door to the place. I walked down into the little entrance/alley area thing and saw a door in front of me. I tried to open it but was locked (it was a private entrance). I then went to the front of the restaurant and looked at the front of it to see if there was a door but there wasn't. Went back and saw a wooden door that blended in well with its surroundings. I tried to pull it but had to push. Not a big issue but could have had a more obvious front door.",0.9986,0.813,0.161,0.026,0.531643642305407
2011-06-07,5.0,"I've only been here once and considering it's within stumbling distance of my apartment, that is just wrong.  Came here in the winter, so perhaps that helped the wait but we arrived right after work on a Thursday and only waited about 10 minutes.  But I regularly drive/walk by here and see people waiting outside/inside or at Meiji.  Unless you go to Meiji, there's not really a good place to wait in poor weather.  So don't go to Avec and make more space for me.       I'm going to have to disagree with those who say the dates aren't worth it.  I love bacon wrapped dates (let's be honest, I'd love bacon wrapped shoe leather) and have been eating them at family affairs for ages.  Little did I know how much I was missing out on by not eating them stuffed with chorizo and slathered in a piquillo pepper-tomato sauce.  Swoon.  Not only are these puppies delicious, they are HUGE.  I could make a meal out of one order.  But of course, that would mean I would miss out on the other delicious offerings on the menu.   We had the taleggio foccacia - holy yum.  I have yet to have foccacia in the US that is as good as I had in Italy but this was a pretty delicious dish.  Plus adding truffle oil to food is never a bad idea. The rest of our meal was good but not quite as standout as those two dishes.  One of my favorite things of the night was the wine.  Our server recommended one of the most amazing bottles of wine I've ever had.  It's been a while, so I can't even remember what kind - I just know it was awesome.  It was a crisp, fruity, slightly sweet (but not cloyingly so) white.  A+.   Looking over this, I'm really confused about why I haven't been back to Avec since my last visit.  I'm gonna have to rectify that ASAP.  In fact...maybe I'll head there now...",0.9758,0.748,0.15,0.102,0.6250037125037124

The communal wood seating wasn't the most comfortable, but the optional seat cushions definitely helped (they're above your head).  Well for one thing, the interior is very unique, like being in a hardwood floor cabin.  Weird yes, but I also loved the bathroom, with hardwood floors/walls and the mint soap was a nice touch. The service was excellent, but the food was even better.  All the dishes are meant to be shared, with small and large plates.  We started with the bacon wrapped dates and just wow!  Stuffed with chorizo and in a spicy tomato sauce, all the flavors just worked together so well.  Served with some hot crusty bread to sop up the sauce, we enjoyed it so much we ordered seconds.  This was a great start and I already had a smile on my face. Next came the focaccia - thin & crispy focaccia stuffed with a creamy mixture of cheese, herbs, and truffle oil.  The cheese was very rich, yet the bread was very light and crispy.  Every bite was delicious. The housemade bratwurst was another solid dish and I couldn't get enough of that pickled ramp vinaigrette with the super soft white beans.  I also enjoyed the hangar steak, which was very tender with a nice char crust and worked well with the grapefruit. We were too stuffed for any dessert, but I know I'll be back soon.  They also have a nice wine list, as well as a small but nice craft beer selection.

I thought it was quite salty. My favorite dish was Focaccia with taleggio cheese, truffle oil and fresh herbs. It looks like a square pizza and it was drippingly good, we killed the entire thing. Our eyes were a bit big and we ordered - over-ordered - for three people. I think that maybe 1 starter and 2 - 3 entrees were good, but we went for 2 starters and 3 entrees. We also had the housemade bratwurst (tasty), roasted half chicken - very very moist, large portion, and the roasted pork shoulder. All the food was made well and comforting, but I think that we were so stuffed near the end that we didn't keep track of what it tastes like.

We had a party of four and wait was just under 2 hours on a Saturday. Our service was excellent; the food phenomenal. We picked 3 small plates and 2 big plates for the four of us. I can still taste the truffle and taleggio focaccia and the chorizo stuffed dates were amazing. I think you are a liar if you didn't like them. We also ordered the bucatini w/ squid and  marinated hangar steak -- the candied grapefruit made the dish! We did notice that our dishes were coming out a tad more quickly than the couple next to us. We didn't feel rushed, but certainly noted that they had a little more time between courses than we did. I wonder if our larger party size had something to do with timing? Not a huge factor, but the only thing I can find to pick apart. All in all, it was the little touches such as the hostess coming over to our table when we were done and asking the lady next to me to let me out, give it the fifth star from my review. They recognize it is a different dining experience and accommodate for potential awkward situations where Americans are sitting together so closely, not like we're used to.

2011-05-26,5.0,"Avec is our [especially mine] all time favorite Chicago Restaurant. They don't take reservations, so if you arrive with a group, be prepared for a wait, or get there closer to opening time to avoid long waits. We usually head here as a two-top and like to sit at the bar, but no matter where you sit this place is 'communal' and 'close quarters' and you will like share conversations with those around you, another reason why we like this place. We have met some really interesting and fun people here. The food is obviously the big draw card. Thank-goodness they treat their staff well as Chef de Cuisine Koren Grieveson is the secret sauce, she has provided the magic from the start and I hope she is the main-stay for years to come.  The menu has been a revolving & consistent menu. Revolving in that they do different seasonal takes on several staple dishes providing the consistency. There is always a 'crostini' to be found, and when we were there it consisted off  smashed early spring peas, red onion, parsley & marinated feta in red wine - delicious. People go crazy for the 'chorizo-stuffed medjool dates' with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce, they do taste good, but there are so many other things that we are typically drawn to. The menu also features a whole fish at MP [market price], a salad, some seasonal vegetables and a dessert or two as a special. The dressing they use on their salad is so drool worthy we asked for the recipe, all we got was a list of what went into it. That was three years ago we are still trying to get the balance right - we are almost there, not that a few more trips to Avec won't help. A few other faves to try that we also like are the: focaccia with taleggio cheese, truffle oil and fresh herbs; any salad that is shaved be it fennel or brussel sprouts; and of course the bread fresh & hot from the wood oven. Did I mention they have a great wine list? They offer up an interesting selection of European wines. The 'pork shoulder' also a staple on the menu comes in some form or another. This visit it was a wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with harissa, marinated rock shrimp, hominy, peanuts and tomatillo. It is always moist & succulent and packed with interesting flavors & textures to round out the dish. It is huge and filling, although it looks small - trust us. The other fave dish to order is the 'prosciutto' also always seasonal in flavor the current version is a la quercia prosciutto with lavender mascarpone and coriander. As an insiders tip, this is listed on menu as large plates, if you ask nicely they will serve it up as a 1/2 portion. Truly fabulous. Thanks Avec.

We started with the shaved fennel salad, which was killer.  Crisp fennel, red wine soaked manchego, a tiny bit of sweetness from halved grapes and walnuts, and a truly awesome vinaigrette; everything went really well together in this dish.  Then we had the chorizo stuffed, bacon wrapped dates (pretty much as you'd expect), which came with a piquillo pepper tomato sauce that we soaked up every last bit of with the bread it was served with. My highlight had to be the bucatini with squid, tomato and mint.  A beautiful bowl of al dente bucatini, overflowing with calamari infused with the flavor of one of the best tomato sauces I can remember having, and just a hint of mint rounded it out quite nicely. Finally, the hangar steak was nicely cooked and marinated, but I didn't quite 'get' the dish.  I loved the hint of basil and the mustard seed it was served with, but the addition of grapefruit supremes really just didn't make sense to me. I wanted to get about 12 other things on this menu.  I can't wait to come back for more.",0.9772,0.834,0.154,0.012,0.5579166666666666

The sweetness of the dates work perfectly in harmony with the saltiness of the bacon and the spice of the chorizo - whole fish: it's exactly what it sounds like, a whole (deboned) fish fried to a crisp and simply flavored. A charred orange that it's served with adds a nice touch of citrus at the diner's discretion - bucatini: the sauce, mint, bucattini, and octapus come together to make this dish delicious to the last bite - striped bass: this was the only ""meh"" dish of the night for me, the charred fish housed a bitter flavor which I wasn't very fond of, I don't think I would order this one again next time being this the first time I've visited Avec, I would say the experience was pretty good.

Thank God it comes with that fluffy perfect bread, which soaks up all that flavor. The whitefish with the scalloped potatos and buttery base is one of the best cuts of fish I've ever had. The fish just flakes perfectly and together with the peas and buttery sauce gives you layers of simple yet delicious flavors. The pork shoulder is so juicy and tender.

2011-03-22,3.0,"The central question at Avec is how much pain are you willing to go through for some pretty good food.  The highlights are certainly the Chorizo-Stuffed Dates and Housemade Blood Sausage.  In fact, leaving the restaurant I saw one gentleman at the counter having those exact dishes--he knew what was up.  Also good was the Wood-Oven Roasted Pork Shoulder.  The pork was so tender you literally spoon it out of the pot it is served in.  The Salumi Selection was solid, but nothing particularly stood out in my opinion.  Items that I would definitely pass on in the future: the Shaved Fennel Salad and the Sweetbread Fritters (which ended up tasting not much better than glorified hush puppies). And now for the pain, which starts the moment you walk into Avec.  More likely than not, you will have to wait for a table--the problem being that there really is not much of an area to wait.  In fact, beyond the two wooden stools by the window and maybe additional floor space for two more people next to the host (and the entrance door that opens inward--gah), people have to start standing in the main (and only) walkway through the restaurant where you are guaranteed to be a nuisance to fellow diner and beleaguered server alike.  Ironically, all of this occurs in view of the restaurant's James Beard award for outstanding design. Your reward for the wait is the privilege of sitting at a communal table on a rock-hard chair or bench.  Luckily, having read this review you will know to look or ask for one of the seat cushions stacked in the window sill because your server surely did not point these out much less offer one to you--service overall is really nothing to write home about.  Also, Avec has to be the worst implementation of the communal table concept I have seen for the simple reason that whenever a diner on the interior of the bench-side of the tables has to get out, the two or three people (likely complete strangers) will have to get up and go out onto the main (did I also mention only?) walkway.  There they can bump into and remind queued-up diners that while both of them are sharing in the miserable experience, at least the seated fellows have food to assuage the hurt. Finally, pain does not have to all be physical.  As your server will explain, Avec is a small-plates-slash-sharing-slash-we'll-bring-you-food-whenever-we-feel-like-it kind of restaurant.  Thus, the usual experience of a build-up and denouement is traded for a ""raid the pantry as needed"" approach you might follow when watching Sunday football by yourself.  The end result is a jumble that I feel does not properly highlight the food. So, why the three stars?  I seriously considered dropping Avec down to two, but...have you tried the chorizo dates and blood sausage?",0.8814,0.837,0.092,0.071,0.5003779289493575

I appreciate that Avec almost always carries an Eizaguirre Txakoli not often found in USA Spanish or tapas restaurants.  I hope they will soon add a Russian River Pliny the Elder offering amongst the fabulous beers, as it would stand up well to the more flavorful items on the menu.  I should mention that all of the waiters and waitresses are quite familiar with each offering, VERY agile on their feet, and friendly.  There were so many good people waiting for a table at Avec this Monday evening that I moved along as fast as I could to Blackbird next door for dessert.

I read it several times, but I still wasn't really sure if I wanted to eat here as my 1 nice meal out in Chicago. But my friends convinced me that it was worth it. And boy, was it totally worth it.  My boyfriend and I arrived here and saw a line out the door. We were prepared to wait a long time, but luckily we only waited 15 minutes.  We sat at the bar (which I LOVE sitting at bars, especially in small restaurants). We started off with a wonderful bottle of wine that was suggested by our server.  We tried the following: 1. Chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates: absolutely amazing...every bite was an explosion in my mouth. I really didn't think this was going to be this good, but I was wrong. The chorizo was perfectly spicy, the date was perfectly sweet and the bacon was perfectly salty. The sauce it was in was so good we dipped everything in it. It pretty much made our trip.  2. Sea Bass, clams, octopus in garlic sauce: This was surprisingly good. It wasn't as good as the dates, but I couldn't believe how tender the octopus was. It was simple, but very well made.  3. Pasta:  I forgot what kind of meat that was in this pasta. It might have been some sort of braised veal or something. It was sooo good. The sauce was so light with just some veggies. I remember carrots...and a wonderful lemon flavor. We licked this bowl clean.  4. Pork Shoulder: I wasn't crazy about the pork shoulder. It was good, but maybe the dates and the pasta put the bar so high that the pork shoulder just wasn't as good. It was really tender. It was hard to share with just 1 person, seeing that we were already stuffed from all of the other food. I'd skip it next time.  The place is tiny....and the service and food is great. I loved that we could get half orders of some of the dishes. This made it possible for my boyfriend and I to taste alot more food than we expected to.  The portions here are pretty big (eventhough it's considered small plates/tapas style). I swear some of their ""half orders"" would have definitely been ""full orders"" here in LA for the same price.

2011-03-11,4.0,"To begin with, I love the idea of a restaurant naming itself with a preposition and nothing more--so spare, so avant-garde, so chic, darling. And Avec is. However, man and woman cannot live on chic alone. Flavor, delicious, savory, orgasmic flavor is what I'm after. And Avec, with its measly preposition of a name, has the goods and goods to spare. Oh, Avec, you coy thing, you! I loved the small, shareable meals and matching small, shareable space. And I personally prefer Avec to its grander siblings, Blackbird and the Publican, both on the merits of its food alone and its self-consciously svelte space. The only drawback to its charm is the fact that there are no reservations and space fills up alarmingly quickly at indecently early hours, leaving you, particularly in inclement conditions when you'd rather not step outside, to feel a bit like Gulliver amid a herd of Lilliputians in its hair's breadth of an entrance way. Revise that: a bit like Gulliver who's not beyond roasting up half a dozen Lilliputians because his senses have been toyed with long enough, and he's hungry, damn it. Also, not to be catty (ok, to be a little catty), our waitress had an obscenely high ponytail that she shook around like a whip at us every time we paused ever so slightly during our, yes, several rounds of ordering, which I cannot imagine to be uncommon, given the indeterminacy of the smallness of the small plates and the carefully elicited sensory greed that began to take us over once the first bites made their way in. I don't know whether if the ponytail made its way down an inch or two she would have slipped a few inches parallel on her obvious high horse (sorry--the pun absolutely forced itself on me; I am a victim in these things). But the effing phenomenal quality of the food considered, we left in a decided happy trance and wished her sincerely good night and lower hair.",0.9824,0.792,0.142,0.067,0.46042042042042036

Since it's been 5 years I honestly don't remember what we had but it was mighty fine. The real test of a great experience is if, years down the road, you look back and reminisce joyful memories like these.

My waitress for one wouldn't address me when my friend and I were ordering food which was odd... Apparently I did something to make her not like me, which is strange since I barely communicated with her at all. This happened all throughout the night... And towards the end when I received my bill she gave me the death stare from hell look. Maybe its because i was playing with my phone while my friend went to the bathroom and that looks bad to people walking by? The hell if I know, but this place reeks of snobbery so that's a likely possibility. To be fair, the people at the front who greeted us were very pleasant as was the busboy, but really that's where the pleasantries ended.

Everything, and I mean everything, I have tried is heaven in your mouth.  From their signature chorizo stuffed dates to their flatbreads that change ingredients every time, to their unique pasta dishes, fish, beef, you NAME it, I  am always impressed.  Flavors are so unique and pungent.  Desserts are equally as scrumptious.  I won't even try to make a list of everything I've had there b/c it's been so many different things! 2) The atmosphere.  The communal tables are are such a fun concept, and the modern,  clean looking atmosphere just makes you feel like you are somewhere important.   3) The service - always friendly and willing to answer your questions with care - you don't even get the feeling they are just answering you to answer. 4) Drinks - They have a fantastic craft brew list if you're looking for beer, their wine list is unique and haven't gone wrong with a bottle yet, and they have an adequate bar for mixed drinks.  Although no mixed drink list, I have asked 3 times now for the waiter to just  ""surprise me"" with a fun, tasty, pre-dinner cocktail and every time they have been more than happy to do it and I've loved each of them. 5) Prices for what you get are extremely reasonable! you leave full, but not too full, and excited about the next time you get a chance to come back. Overall, more a than pleasant experience and I would recommend it to  anyone and everyone for a great night out on the town!  I will be returning for my 7th or 8th time i a couple of weeks and I can't wait!",0.9921,0.823,0.169,0.009,0.5939564564564566

Showed up on a Sunday evening at 7:30pm and were lucky enough to snatch 2 seats at the bar right away. The interior is intriguing. I think they did a good job of making the space look bigger than it really is. As I made my way down the hall I felt very thankful to be sitting at the bar vs. one of the communal tables. I'm not anti-social or anything and actually quite enjoy communal tables (a la Purple Pig) but these tables were just too small!  Very reasonably priced wines. They offer their wines in carafes so we sampled two different reds. Don't quite remember what they were called but both were recommended by our servers and both were pretty decent (in terms of taste and damage to our wallets). The food was AWESOME. Like really truly delicious flavors. Where is Avec's Michelin star??? Without realizing it, we ended up with a very pork-heavy meal: chorizo-stuffed dates, garlic sausage with some sort of chick pea salad, and the pork shoulder.

More like a huge delicious meatball with clear, clean flavours. Incredible. 2. Special of grilled sturgeon, with a creamy cauliflower sauce. Delicious and interesting. 3. Rabbit parpadelle, good, but I felt like this was a ""safe"" choice.  4. Two of their wine quartinos - exceptional value for a 250ml mini-carafe.

We were seated right away and everyone was really friendly and helpful with describing the menu.  We ordered chorizo stuffed dates because we were told that it was very popular, local apple salad, and seared sturgeon. We started off with the apple salad. Now, when I saw apple salad I thought it was fresh greens with slices of apples. So I was slightly wrong. It was a salad of apples. Ok, I was just wrong. I liked the apple salad because I love apples. The salad consisted of green apples, manchego cheese, and apple cider. The apple was tart but sweetened with the cider and I love the nutty taste from the manchego. The dates came out and I didn't even know they were dates because they were huge and stuffed with spicy chorizo. Dates stuffed with chorizo, bacon, and tomato sauce. Really can't go wrong. It was really good. You had the sweetness from the date that paired with a kick of spiciness of the chorizo made it a very enjoyable dish. The seared sturgeon was cooked just right leaving the meat tender and juicy. We finished the meal with chocolate crepes with mascarpone and house made nutella. Very simple and very good. The nutella was a bit runny. I prefer it being thicker so that I can plop a spoon of it onto each bite of my crepe.  The overall meal was delicious.

Service was a little disappointing.  Perhaps we didn't order enough food (the waitress warned us not to order the foie because it would be too big!) or didn't buy an expensive enough bottle of wine (the cheapest red is not a good option), but the pacing of the dishes was uneven, I had to ask for silverware, and it took forever for my glass of water to be refilled.  Since I plan to return, I hope that's not the norm. The food, in detail: Chorizo-stuffed dates: Besides the dessert, the best thing we had all night.  I'm not a huge fan of bacon, and honestly, when I read chorizo, smoked bacon, and pepper sauce in the same dish I thought one of the three flavors would dominate.  Fortunately, I was very wrong.  The chorizo and the bacon provided good contrast in texture with the dates, and the sauce was on the thick side, which I really liked. Focaccia: This was okay.  The biggest problem with this dish was that it became cold and deteriorated way too quickly.  The bread was good, but there wasn't enough of the cheese/oil/herb.  Thankfully, there was leftover sauce from the dates, which worked pretty well. Hanger steak: Good but not great.  The steak was slightly overcooked and underseasoned.  The shallots and brussels sprouts were the stars here. 50/50 sausage: Really good.  The kale was amazing and the sausage was perfectly cooked.  It's pretty obvious that this dish is *extremely* unhealthy. Pork shoulder: Also really good.  Really tender and flavorful shoulder.  I was really impressed by the potatoes as well, which had a nice bite to them and weren't unbearably hot.",0.9974,0.709,0.234,0.057,0.6248148148148149

The menu certainly satisfied my mild impatience.  And when I caught a glimpse of the whole roasted foie gras on the menu, I was hooked.   Also, the chorizo-stuff dates were outstanding.  Unfortunately I had to share these with my group, otherwise I would eat the whole plate.  Maybe it's a good thing I didn't have that option.  Furthermore, our group ordered some focaccia with taleggio cheese, which I surprisingly enjoyed.  Thoroughly enjoyed even...the cheese was very creamy.   The simple presentation of all food items was a pleasant surprise. The waitstaff was very knowledgable and friendly and when our group tried to play Millionaire Matchmaker with one of the chefs, she was quite happy to oblige.  I'm very glad to have finally made it through the wait one time and sample the delicious food here. Pretty boring review I'd say.  The food here is so good that it leaves you with a pretty succinct review.",0.9943,0.689,0.277,0.034,0.6734950029394475
2010-12-22,4.0,"I had pretty high expectations for this place - in some ways it met them and in others I was disappointed.  I think I ordered too much meat while I was here, got the fish, pork shoulder, and brisket. They were all done well, but maybe too much meat and not enough of anything else. The fish was great, loved that it was de-boned for me but I don't think it was better than what I had at Ginza the previous night. The pork shoulder was good, but I feel like I had something similar at Purple Pig. And the steak was wonderful - this dish was a great one to start off with. Overall, everything was delicious here, but I don't know if it was worthy of all the hype it gets. I loved the way this place was decorated and thought the food was great, just not amazing like I expected. I don't know if I would go out of my way to come here again, but really glad I tried it.",0.9963,0.665,0.306,0.029,0.6366666666666668
2010-12-20,5.0,"So Avec doesn't need another good review, but I'm jumping on the bandwagon anyway. My husband took me here for my birthday a couple of years ago and I'm just getting around to the review.  The wood interior, communal seating and business clad clientele were a bit intimidating for average old me, but the food made me so happy that I gladly pushed my comfort level a bit.  It's my fault for failing to anticipate such a young, white, business crowd considering the location and the critical reviews.  The service was warm though--I only wish we hadn't ended up being packed in the middle of a communal table.  I was bumping elbows with the couple to my left during most of the meal.  This is a smaalllll space.   In any case, the menu of small plates and entrees changes regularly, but there are some staples, including the tantalizing Chorizo Stuffed Dates.  These are gargantuan and succulent and not to be missed.  My husband and I split a bottle of reasonably priced wine (in the $20-30 range) and also enjoyed Gunciale Meatballs which were enormous and came in a delectable sauce, the Hanger Steak which was wonderful and the most tender Pork Shoulder I have ever tasted which came stewed with Mussels and Tripe (two of me and my husband's not so favorite things but I enjoyed here).  We walked away stuffed and with leftovers which made for the best day after lunch at work ever.  Really, the prices are totally reasonable for such amazing food.  We've definitely spent more for far worse food.  I hope to dine here again.",0.9899,0.735,0.186,0.079,0.5568764568764569
2010-12-19,4.0,"This is kind of embarrassing to admit to all of cyberland, but up until recently, I'd never actually dined at Avec's. It's not for lack of trying though. On more than one occasion, I've gotten through the entry to be greeted by the throngs of washed masses and a hostess quoting hour-plus wait times.  The entryway/waiting area is very small, however, and due to my diminutive stature, I'm easily pushed around by others trying to pass. This, combined with a low-grade claustrophobia (resulting from the time I got stuck in a hula hoop), makes waiting at a crowded establishment that doesn't accept resos a bit unappealing for me.  In honor of a new facebook friend's arrival from The Angels, CA, I decided to suck in my gut and brave the crowd in search of one of Chicago's more lauded dinners. Despite the unreasonably cold weather and the fact that it was a Monday night, we still waited over an hour for our party of 8 to be seated.  The beer list, while limited, was very very nice, composed mostly of foreign beers I haven't heard of, but I'm sure are better because they're from a different country. The food menu was pretty much what I expected. Not a whole lot of veggie options. I think everyone in our groups' eyes quickly fixated on one thing - the whole roasted foie gras.  The foie is listed as M.P. Now, I'm not a purveyor of organ meats, but I know someone who very regularly purchases whole lobes, and he says the price he pays hasn't fluctuated in over a year. Granted, Avec's duck liver is from a specific region and perhaps a specific farm, but I've heard other diners say they paid $86 for the same dish we were lucky to acquire at $70. What's up with that?  The foie was glorious, as was most of the food we received. The focus seems to be on taste, far more than presentation. I personally don't care too much about presentation, since everything looks the same on the way out, but I was actually surprised that most of our dishes arrived looking like Jan, yet tasted more like Marcia.  Upon leaving, it occurred to me to take a quick look at the open kitchen. My name is Matt, but let me be Frank with you.... The kitchen area seems tiny. I saw a wood-burning oven and maybe a couple burners, but not a whole lot more. I have no idea how they crank out that much food there. When you go, you should check it out, it's rather impressive. Now, to my 3 loyal readers: Sorry for this review that some may actually find useful (and ROTD-worthy). If you defan me, I'll understand, but I promise I won't do any more snoozers like this for the time being.",0.9957,0.807,0.151,0.042,0.4996331663978722

I dined here on 12/15/10 and OMG SALTY SALTY!! The kind of salty where I looked like Lisa Rinna after I got done eating my meal. My lips were so chapped and puffy that I felt like I had gotten bonus lip injections. We ordered the apple and manchego salad which was pretty refreshing, then we had the skirt steak, which was progressively saltier, but it was not until we tasted the flat bread with clams that I started feeling like this meal was made for Mr. Ed.  Not sure if this was an off night, but this morning I could not even get my wedding ring on.  The chefs really need to lay off the salt, I know it's in season with the snow and all, but I want to taste my food rather than lick a salt block.

I went with my mom on our last night in Chicago. We were seated in the middle of one of their communal tables. Immediately the groups on either side introduced themselves. The group to our left turned out to all be waiters at another famous Chicago restaurant, The Girl and the Goat, and the group to our right was a group of food-loving professors. Both sides offered us tastes of their food, recommendations of their favorite dishes, and even the remainder of their bottle of wine. We spent the rest of the evening enjoying one of the tastiest and most reasonably priced meals I had ever had.

2010-12-14,5.0,"Dear Avec, I hope this isn't too awkward but, I enjoyed our one night together.  When I first saw you, I found you very cute and interesting because of your hallway shaped restaurant with a bar/table that extended almost the entire length and on the other side there were small tables. Behind the bar/table was the kitchen where all your wonder aromas originated from. You didn't crowd me because of your high ceilings. I saw that you kept yourself clean, simple and made of wood from the ceiling, walls and floor which really made you even more attractive.  You started to flirt with me with your Tuna spread (accompanied with a half boiled egg) which was so creamy. It was perfectly seasoned and when I smeared on the toasted bread, I was almost in bliss. You then tickled me with the chicken liver dish!  I love chicken liver and I think you knew it because the way you cooked it with the endive (which was perfectly cooked with a hint of bitterness), the flaolet beans (firm and soft) and the vinaigrette was in complete harmony with each other. At this point, I had a feeling you were trying to seduce me with the marinate hanger steak with roasted shallots and brussel sprouts salsa verde. The hanger steak was so tender and the added flavors of the shallots and salsa only indicated that it was going to be a fun night. Well that and the second bottle of white wine (2009 P. Mas, ""Claude Val"")! Who knew that brussel sprouts (soft in texture) would go so well with a hanger steak? The marinated steak was salty but, the salsa helped even out the flavor. I guess you thought I still wasn't convinced that you were into me because you came out with the strip bass with harissa, tahini and romaine hearts.  The fish meat was so soft and tender that it flaked off as I tried to eat it. I can't remember all of the flavors but it was so appetizing. This dish was orgasmic!   I felt I needed a coffee after all of that sensual food action. So you brought out a Café avec which was a 1 oz espresso and 1 oz Leopold Gourmel Cognac. I've never had this combination in my life but I enjoyed it so.  Our one night together was erotic and I'm not sure when I'll be back. I think about you often when I'm in other restaurants but, no one will ever take away our one night of pure pleasure.

2010-12-14,4.0,"Dear Paul Kahan,  You may have dissed me (and one of my friends) by totally rebuffing our flirtatious advances at an event (yes, I know you're married), but I still love you.  I love you and your food and all the deliciousness you bring to my fair city of Chicago. Love,  Angie M. If I can put some advice out there, I would say this: Go to avec with folks who like to eat and will pretty much try anything.  If you eliminate something because you don't necessary know what it is (like mortadella), you may be missing out on something pretty tasty.  So put on your adventure pants and get ready for some yummy eats by some of Chicago's finest chefs.  Hell, if it's good enough for Tony Bourdain, its good enough for me! My party of eight went with, well, pretty much the entire menu.  Get ready to get schooled on avec's winter menu! * Whole roasted fish with herbs de provence, toasted rice and charred lemon.  If you've ever been to a Filipino party, you know of something called 'community fish' where there's a whole fish and everyone just kind of digs in.  This would be the avec version of community fish.  The crunchy skin is amazing, but be aware that even though the fish is deboned, there are still SOME bones in there holding it together. * Focaccia with taleggio cheese, truffle oil and fresh herbs.  This reminded me of a quesadilla of sorts.  The taleggio cheese was so rich and creamy. * Wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with soffrito, fingerlings and pickled garlic.  SO MUCH PORK up in this dish!  It was so tender it was falling apart.  I also may or may not have lapped up the sauce with avec's bread so shamelessly I feared people at the table next to me would start staring. * Whole roasted sonoma valley foie gras with roast pears, candied walnuts and rosemary.  You better really like foie gras, because this bad boy will set you back $70.  While I don't love foie gras, I did tuck in for a few bites.  I had to see what a $70 entrée tasted like. * Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce.  Duuude... EAT THESE.  If you can find fault in chorizo stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates, I'd like to know all about it, because I feel this may be the most perfect food around. * Whipped brandade with housemade garlic bread and chives.  I'm still a little clear on what this is exactly, but what I do know is that it's some kind of whipped up, cheesy and herby fish that you spread on garlic toast.  Very tasty! * Local apple salad with manchego, marcona almonds, celery and apple cider.  What?  We're at least kind of healthy with this light and fruity salad.  * Marinated hanger steak with roasted shallots and brussels sprouts salsa verde.  Tied for a close second for ""Favorite Dish of the Night"" with the pork shoulder, this dish is spectacular.  I'm slowly learning to order my steak more on the medium to medium rare side (which is how this is prepared).  It makes it so much easier to enjoy when the steak is cooked and seasoned to perfection. * 50/50 sausage with creamed kale, pearl onions and navel orange gremolata. A little rich and fatty for my taste, but a nice concept. * Open-faced chicken sandwich with housemade pumpernickel and squash.  My throwaway dish for the night.  Nothing spectacular or even very interesting.  But I suppose putting chicken on the menu does make your restaurant a bit more accessible for the masses. While the food is great, there are a few issues with avec.   1. No reservations and nowhere to hang out in the restaurant while you're waiting to be seated.  Because of avec's popularity, it could be a substantial wait.  It's lame that the space is SO tiny.  I have to think that if you have such a small restaurant that you'd at least do reservations for larger parties, but alas, avec seems to be functioning fine right now and probably doesn't need to take my advice. 2. avec is literally the most uncomfortable restaurant in Chicago.  The tables and benches are hard, boring wood.  There's community seating (totes not my thing), so you're scrunched in with total strangers.  I know it's all about enjoying food with your dining community, but I totally hate it.   In the end...

2010-12-03,5.0,"During a recent trip to Chicago my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this gem of a place. Little did we realize that we happened to hit it just as they opened (right about 4pm) and made it in with no reservation and no waiting, which I hear is very unusual. Before we were done and gone there was a long line out the door with a good number of people waiting on the porch area.  I must say that this place is an overall experience. You get wonderful food, plated in the perfect order by the knowledgeable staff, wonderful wine and liquor selection with talented bartenders, and an unusual social atmosphere in a well designed space.  The first thing that struck us (having no clue other than a few reviews what we were getting in for) was the setup of the seating area. You are sat at a table that seats about 10 people, and you are sat with complete strangers! At first this was incredibly intimidating to a typical American with personal space issues, but after a glass of wine it turned out to be an amazing experience. The couple next to us were regulars and shared insight on the menu, wine, and the restaurant in general. They were so much fun to talk to! I was happy in the end about the unusual setup. It made great food and drink even better and more memorable. If Chicago didn't have so many great places to eat I would want to come here every time I visit!  The food...oh the food. We have a wonderful selection of tapas. Every morsel was well cooked, and tasty. About 4 plates was perfect for the two of us and left room for wine and drinks. I'm not sure I was a huge fan of the spicy date dish, but it wasn't bad either. Just compared to the other great things it was so-so. The couple next to us had the whole fish, which they said was a different fish cooked in a different style every time they came. they said it was always good and it looked wonderful. They also have a nice cheese and olive selection if you are just looking for something to accompany conversation and drinks.  I had a great experience here. The staff was great and knowledgeable, the food and drink was amazing, and the social atmosphere was incredible and led to a wonderful night and memory.  Highly recommended!

First, the food. I went with the medjool dates that everybody has been raving about, the wagyu coulette, and the lamb neck pappardelle.  Dates: this is one of their signature dishes and rightly so. If you like pork at all, you will love this dish.  The dates with the tomato sauce is a revelation.  The other fantastic perk is that you can order a half-serving of the dish, so you get two instead of four. Wagyu: Really smart move to take the coulette cut (top sirloin cap, which can be tough), and use wagyu and marinate it, which gives you fantastic flavor with tenderness. The combination of the beef with the salsa verde was fresh and delicious. Lamb: Disclaimer - I love pappardelle with braised meats in general, so I was predisposed to like this dish.  It met my expectations. The lamb neck was flavorful and delicious. The only problem I had with this dish was that it was a little bit oily. Ordinarily, I would be hesitant to give 5 stars to a restaurant I've only been to once and only had 3 dishes at, but all three dishes were superb and you can tell that they run a great operation here. Some highlights 1. The whole ambiance felt homey, special, and friendly. The wooden panel interior, the communal tables, the long stainless steel bar, the attentive service...it all served to transport you from a random street in downtown Chicago to a world where you got delicious food with friendly people.  The two people sitting next to me struck up random conversations with me and it felt totally natural. One guy next to me was on a business trip like me and had come two nights in a row because the pappardelle was so good.   The decor, vibe, layout, and food all reminded me a lot of one of my favorite restaurants in NYC - Momofuku Ssam Bar - and in my mind, it's hard to beat that. 2. Everyone was incredibly thoughtful. When I got there, it was a 30 min wait even though I went on a Wednesday at 9pm, but they took my cell phone number and so I could wander around the neighborhood while waiting. Everyone introduced themselves by name. The hostess introduced herself and Tess and remembered my name throughout the night. Same with my server Josh, who was great and kept warning me that I might be ordering too much food (I proved him wrong though!)...how often do you have a server tell you to stop ordering?!

After an existing reservation fell through at 8 pm on Halloween (a Sunday, lots of Loop restaurants closed), I called Avec with the hope that they could seat 7 (!) immediately.  They could!  We arrived to our table already set, no waiting. The soon-to-be epic evening started beautifully...  Avec's wine list is unusual and honestly not that easy for a relative naif to maneuver. But after explaining our tastes, the waiter directed us to gorgeous bottles of  red (2006 Grillos) and white (2006 Bergerie de l'Hortus ""Classique"").   The table shared a smattering of dishes. The chorizo stuffed dates were clearly a highlight! The pisaladiere was incredible - not fishy at all, not too salty, just a perfect blend of flavors - and even our picky eaters loved the focaccia. The oil-poached tuna was very good, as was the brandade. But the wagyu... oh, my.  Wonderful!!! Clearly my favorite dish of the evening.  I think we also had the papperdelle, but after 4 bottles of wine my memory may have lapsed a bit.  Loved the decor!  Loved the service!  We ordered everything up front, but the dishes were perfectly timed...  it felt as if the table magically produced another wondrous item whenever we had started to slow down on the previous dish.  Avec is now one of my favorite Chicago restaurants, I can't wait to return!",0.9919,0.797,0.19,0.013,0.6304365079365081

Italian... Meditteranean.  All 4 different parties at our table that night got this dish.  Just absoutely amazing.

Yup, me.  Worth the many months of waiting? Well let me tell you: We came here on a Friday night fairly earlier than we usually eat, around six pm, since the restaurant doesn't take reservations.  It was already packed, but luckily we were seated almost right away.  We had the most lovely and attentive waitress.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that bottles of wine are very reasonably priced.  As for the food it was great.  And each dish was constantly delicious as each plate arrived.  I came here with three others and we settled on three large plates (foccacia with cheese and truffle oil, pork shoulder, and pappardelle), and four small plates (chorizo stuffed dates, poached tuna, pan seared shrimp, and the waygu coulotte).  It was slightly more food than we needed, but everything was so delicious that we couldn't stop eating so it was fine.  Food coma was worth it.  I can't say which dish was my favorite, because I'm a fan of all of them, but I will say that the waygu is one reason I'm glad I'm not a vegetarian.   The space is very small and narrow.  It's a slight annoyance if one sits on the benches that are against the wall.  If someone from the same table or a neighboring table needs to get up or sit back down, then everyone on that side needs to get up and let him/her out.  But the food and service were excellent, so it's no dice.  I like the minimalist design of the interior and the loud atmosphere.  It makes it feel very unpretentious. The open kitchen is pretty cool as well, but sitting facing towards the kitchen definitely made me extra hungry as I watched the go by.

Normally I would not wait this long for any restaurant, but my out-of-town guests were excited to try the place. - After waiting 2 hrs, we were starving when we sat down. The group next to us sat down AFTER we placed our orders. The same dates & flatbread we ordered were served to them first! I overheard the guy asking the server if they could hurry their dishes because they were starving.

The easiest thing I can think of is this:  It's a place that got famous and subsequently tried to doop its customers by slowly degrading the menu and the ingredients over time.  This is the only way I can understand why this place is popular. Hearsay and not good hearsay at that.  So here are some more details that you need to know: The Seating We tried to be nice about this at first.  Jam packed between a group of four and a loud couple - at the very same table no less - we tried to see the bright side of things.  But I simply could not hear A WORD my dining partner said.  We moved to the bar, fortunately, but it's simply shitty to have people sit like this and emphasize the virtue of 'sharing' when all you're really trying to do is fit as many people into a small space so you can make the most money.  Sorry, you didn't pull that one on me!  The Service: Never in my life have I waited so long to order a drink and food.  Not only that, but the service was simply snobby.  This improved at the bar, the guy serving water was really nice and a breath of fresh air to this establishment, but everyone else was less than disappointing if there is such a thing.  Being from San Francisco and moving to New York, I don't really think that these folks have a leg to stand on and whatever they think they have..well let's just say this, you should always be nice to everyone.  I feel like this establishment has forgotten this essential fact of service.  The Food: We got everything the server recommended.  We got the chorizo stuffed medjols, the foccacio, and the pork belly.  All of them were just not hitting it for us.  They were simply OK.  That's all and good but when you want to cram me on a bench next to other people, I don't know your food better be damn good.  All and all, I felt like none of it had any real flavor.  Looking around the loud, crammed dining room I felt sorry for people who thought this was a great dining experience.  The Wine: We got a primitivo.  I overheard the bartender telling the people next to me that this was fruity and spicy.  We got that bottle and there was nothing spicy about it.  It was truly a corner store type of wine.  It reminded me of Yellowtaiil.  We get that in San Francisco for less than $10 a bottle.......... You would think that with such an extensive wine list that they would have a someone who could help customers with wines. Saying, ""Sure we have a very nice primitivo,"" after we already suggested it isn't very convincing.   Please, have some confidence in your product people.  Food and wine are some of the most amazing things we have been blessed with in our time on earth.  Treat them with respect and artistry!",0.9955,0.771,0.159,0.07,0.5536793257247803

We were so stuffed (two small, one large all together would have been perfect).   I knew about the communal seating, so we went there early on a Monday.  It was nice because we had our personal space.  Even when it filled in, it wasn't too bad.  What was awkward though was the decor.  I felt a little like I was dining in a giant coffin because there is wood all around this narrow box of a restaurant.  Some candles to soften the mood would be nice.  Overall though, a great experience. Chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates - eh. Probably won't get them again because they are so different from the usual kind that it didn't satisfy my craving.  Nothing beats the dates at Mercat a la Planxa. Pork shoulder - OMG amazing. Positively delicious.  You cannot come to Avec without this. Flatbread with mussels - basically a pizza, we weren't expecting that, but it was tasty.  I loved the bread and wished I could find a regular pizza in Chicago with that crust. Special tagliatelle with squid ink in a citrus cheese sauce - YUM! I'm sad it's not on the menu all the time.",0.9934,0.771,0.195,0.034,0.6193784709913743

I went with my boyfriend and another couple visiting from Toronto. We went around 6PM and it was relatively not so crowded surprisingly. We were seated RIGHT next to another table, literally I would be touching the woman from the next table if my ginormous LV purse was not in between us. Our waitress was very nice but not helpful with what dishes were popular, and I do really hate it when they say ""all the dishes are my favorite"". I started off with the ice tea which was very tasty and refreshing and my tablemates had nice cold beers (""Blanche de Bruxelles) which was delicious. We ordered several dishes, the chorizo dates, pan fried sardines, pork shoulder and the whitefish. We ONLY ordered one fish dish, but apparently our waitress got confused and got us the whole roasted fish too. When we confronted her, she was making it seem like our fault, and how we should have listened better, and with no apologies.  Girlfriend, if you work in a customer service occupation, the customer is ALWAYS right. Anyways, the sardines were terrible but that's cause I am not a huge fan of sardines. The whole roasted fish was good, not anything special and the dates were good but I am not a huge bacon fan either. Even though I did not like the food as much as I would have liekd to, I would go back there again because I think my table got all the wrong dishes. I mean, I've heard such great reviews, I think I must have missed something! Overall, terrible service but food was decent.

Inside is communal seating- each bench seats about 16 people around it.  But again, coming from NY it didn't really phase me.   But what DID blow me away was the food.  We got 3 small plates and 3 large plates...and we can't figure out what we liked best because they were all so delicious.  Small plates we got the chorizo stuffed medjool dates wrapped with bacon....the spice was absolutely PERFECT on them.  The whitefish with fingerling potatoes was also extremely tasty.  And the the grilled peach salad...mmm...with pistachios...went great with our bottle of Rose from Portugal.  (Did I mention their extensive wine list?!?!) As for the large plates, we had the focaccia with taleggio cheese where the herbs blended in so well it was literally mouth-watering.  The rigatoni which was surprisingly light and good even for a hot day.  And the pork shoulder...talk about comfort food...my girlfriends were reminded of their grandmother's home cooking.  It was roasted perfectly and the pork was so tender and flavorful.   Anyway- here's the best part.  3 small plates + 3 large plates + foodgasmic flavors + 2 bottles of rose wine + 2 really cute chefs = only $45 per person includine tip.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who visits Chicago!",0.9959,0.796,0.204,0.0,0.6658664567755477

We were looking for a place w/ good food, a good vibe and a ""special occasion-like atmosphere"". What we got was an insanely bright and overlit restaurant with a really long wait, average food, bad service and a cold, communal table seat right by the rainy open doors.  Bleh.  Perhaps if we didn't have to wait til 10pm to eat, had better service, didn't sit in a restaurant where it looked more like 10am than 10pm and didn't have to wait 10 minutes in between each dish, we would've had a better experience. But alas, we didn't and the extremely average food didn't help (it was good but definitely NOT great!). Instead, we were told that the wait would be 20 minutes and not the over hour that it was, had a  waitress that didn't welcome us, be polite to us, talk to us or really check up on us and staff that brought the food to the tables w/o as much of a smile or a word just to remind us what the hell the dish was. The worst really, though, was the order in which we got our food. We ordered the fish, hanger steak and ""flatbread"". You would think that if a party ordered pizza, that it would be better as a first course. Instead, we started off w/ fish, had steak in the middle and ended w/ pizza... pizza! Just doesn't make sense. And on top of that, the $16 ""flatbread"" dish w/ mussels that turned out to be more like a small pizza w/ 3 pieces of mussels was just overwhelming after the first slice. The flavors were good at first, but then after the 2nd and 3rd slice, it just became too much. (The same can actually be said of the whitefish which had too much lemon and too much butter).

Lo and behold, they seated 3, the same amount as our party. Strike one. 2) Unfortunately for us, we (who are Asian), were also seated next to another Asian party. The waiter confused the two groups because obviously all Asians look alike. So, while we waited for our order, the party next to us got theirs first even though they ordered after us. In addition, in the end when we got our checks, the waiter told us they he had informed us of a price change for the sardines. Wrong. He told the other Asians.

I don't consider communal lunchroom tables hip or interesting, I consider them one of the things I was happy to leave behind when I left middle school.  Why?  Because when you share a table, you're likely to share it with a$$hats.  True, maybe you meet some nice dining companions.  But maybe a$$hats.  It's a gamble. To one side of us at the shared table on a Sunday evening: two middle-aged couples, conversation increasingly dominated by one of the increasingly drunk women, who became increasingly insistent on providing a detailed and theatrical rundown of her recent psychological growth.  The only thing that didn't steadily increase was the distance between her head and the table and she slumped further and further, eventually resting head to hand to table. To the other side: three acquaintances, maybe co-workers. Conversation dominated by a middle-aged guy in a bright red Polo pullover, gray hair slicked back and slightly tousled in a style I can only call ""country club mystique,"" trying very hard to impress the other two with his erudite knowledge of the food and wine.  Whatever this guy's name is, I'm guessing he went by ""Chaz"" in the 80's and likes to tie an argyle sweater around his shoulders to protect himself from the crisp breeze while he's out yachting.  The only moment of intermingling between any of the parties at the table was when this fellow announced, ""I saw that!"" after I accidentally dropped a slice of dried ginger into my lap. Thanks, Chaz. Avec is loud.  Bad loud, not good loud. When my date and I got tired of of trying to talk to each other over our charming neighbors (across a table that's so narrow you have to keep rearranging plates and glasses), we started texting each other: me:  wtf is with this guy in the red shirt?!  my date: he's giving a$$hole lessons me: i see my date: i brought you here on free education night me: i'm thinking about flinging a hunk of cheese toward the kitchen and seeing what happens ...[discussion of inappropriate behavior]... my date: let's not get blacklisted, i have to come here sometimes with [business associate] me: yeah. when we were here with  [business associate] and some other people, weren't some of them total douchebags? my date: yeah. this place must have a quota Alright, so sitting with d-bags wasn't Avec's fault, I s'pose. Here's what was: Our server (Josh, i think?) was a dick. He came to our table one minute after we sat down, and told us in a bossy, unfriendly tone that he was taking care of both our group and Chaz's group and so he really wanted to put the parties' orders in together.  Then he asked what we wanted, and of course my date and I had no idea, but Chaz said something like, ""WE'RE ready, let's get this thing going, baby!""  So, of course, the orders went in separately.  Sergeant Josh also acted annoyed and defensive when I added a fruit side to our cheese plate-- he said in an accusing tone, ""I thought you decided against that.""  Well I did, Josh, but I changed my mind, and now I'd be very appreciative if I could get the MF-ing fruit plate! Finally, a love note.  Dearest Avec:  How do I love thee?  Not at all.  A few words about beer, my darling. A beer bottle should not be taken away until the customer has poured all the beer into her glass.  Also, some beers (like my date's) have tasty, tasty sediment at the bottom of the bottle, and before you pour out the last bit, you're supposed to swish the beer around so as to get that beer-gold out.  I would normally not mention this trivial business in a review, my love, but since you fancy yourself a high-class foodie joint, you should probs get this stuff right.  Yours for-never, H",0.9983,0.76,0.176,0.064,0.5356418493323257

We show up at around 6:45pm... there was a wait. It wasn't long though. About 15 minutes, if that. We had a carafe of sparkling rose to keep us company so it was just fine. We got seated at the bar (which the hostess had told me earlier would be the best spot to eat if it was just going to be the two of us), ordered another carafe of champagne, and perused the menu. We had asked the bartender/server what his recommendations were. He said the dates are a must (of coarse), the walleye (whitefish on the menu), and the chicken. Yes, yes, and yes please! Chorizo stuffed dates with smoked bacon and pepper and tomato sauce - everyone has explained these little love bombs to a T so I'm not going to go much further. I was told that everything is made in-house; the chorizo, bacon,... the guy even told us they have a little date tree in the basement (he had a real good sense of humor).

Roasted chicken with chimichuri, chickpeas, squash, cauliflower and shaved haricot vert - This was good, but not the best thing we had that evening. Great flavor!

Once again, non-intrusive, informative, and very well-versed on ingredients, dish availability, and accompaniments (big plus). Servers knew their wine, what dishes were good for that night, and making suggestions without ""selling"" ... nothing more annoying than a server who uses the ""it's a popular dish"" as opposed to ""it's a good dish"" ... I don't care about how many people eat something, I care about if that something is good and worth having. I digress. While I was V-disappointed when they took the duck confit off the menu, but the foccacia and bacon-wrapped sausage more than make up for the loss. Also, their fish of the day is phenomenal.

2010-06-15,5.0,"Hands down, this was the best meal our group had while on a visit to Chicago over Memorial Day weekend. One word, three syllabales made this meal fantastic: chorizo. When stuffed in Medjool dates, wrapped with smoked bacon then covered in a piquillo pepper-tomato sauce, it is a combination anyone can appreciate. Considering our group consisted of three Muslims and a Jew, we dubbed this pork-laden dish ""Sinner's Delight.""  I was really impressed by avec's space. The feel of the place was fantastic. I loved how understated, yet beautiful the restaurant was. The buzzing energy of the place, the excellent beer and wine selection, and the amazing food made our visit very memorable. Yes, the wait is long, but so what? If it's a nice evening, grab a drink and have a nice time outside. The experience is totally worth waiting for. This is counter to the typical steakhouse/giant entree experience; get a bunch of small plates and go to town. We ate so much we all felt sick, and at the end of the night, we had a case of reverse sticker shock...our meal turned out to be less than $50 each! This place is just too good to pass up.

Delicous blend of cheeses and was crispy on the outside but soft and cheesy inside. Truffle oil gives it an interesting flavour. Recommended! For mains had the chicken.

2010-06-08,5.0,"Although I have been here several times, I haven't had much time to write my review of Avec until now.  Avec is in my top 10 favorite restaurants in the city, maybe even top 5.  Koren is a genius with the food -- I met some old high school classmates last week for an uber-mini-reunion.  Although we arrived at 5ish, they were already busy!  (this is a GOOD thing people)  We only waited 30 minutes, which was a perfect amount of time to have a beer or glass of wine and do some initial catching up prior to being seated. I get the communal seating ideology....I don't like it, but I get it.  If I may be allowed to ""nit"" a bit, I dislike the actual seating -- the bar stools are impossibly uncomfortable, as are the outside/aisle seats.  The only real comfortable seats are the booth/wall side with proper a proper back -- I highly recommend using one of the seat pads (which you can find in the window sill above you).   The food is wonderful.  As does everyone else, get the dates.  If you're not a meat eater, I'm sorry.  Be aware - the dates are spicier than you think, but oh so delicious.  I also highly recommend the focaccia ""stuffed"" with taleggio (think a fancy cream cheese with herbs).  It is heavenly.  Absolutely heavenly.  Crisp and tender.  Smoky.   Creamy.  Savory.  My mouth is watering as I type this.  I also highly recommend the whole fish special (no matter the fish type) - prepared in a cast iron skillet, sauteed then finished in the oven, the skin is crisp, the chefs always use the freshest herbs, and the meat is flaky and tender.  Those three dishes alone are worth their weight in gold.   And, if this was all you ordered, I believe you will be satisfied and amazed.   Other recommendations -- the brandade.  Think bacalhau.  Ask for an additional ""loaf"" of bread.  And, the English pea crostini.  Refreshing and light and also so, so delicious.  The wine selection (glass or bottle) is excellent.  The beer list, albeit small, is global and whimsical.   And, the desserts change often.  However, the chocolate shards are great to share and go well with a cappuccino.   I really love it here.  The servers and hostess (and the co-owners, who are almost always there) are very nice, friendly, quick, knowledgeable, accommodating, and just downright good people.  Be patient (because you will probably have to wait), and you will be rewarded with delicious, perfectly cooked food.   I WANT you to have a good time here...if you don't, it's probably because of the uncomfortable seats.  Or, because you don't like to be around people.",0.999,0.717,0.248,0.035,0.5608290816326531
2010-06-04,4.0,"This place is probably impossible to get into if you're in a group of 4 or more. Fortunately, we went as a group of 2 and were seated immediately. If you're not comfortable sharing a space with other people, this may not be the place for you. We were seated among a table of 6 at the table edge and when they finished their meal, we had to interrupt our dining to let them out of the booth we were sitting at.  But I'm okay with that, I just charged a tariff on table movement....""if you want to get out to go to the restroom, you give me a bit of whatever you're having.""  =] That's what places like these are all about, creating an eating community. That's arguably the essence of ""Avec"" which means ""with"" in French, you're dining ""with"" others and your experience should be shared. It's a valuable concept that's been lost in America, which excessively elevates the value of exclusivity. The food we had was good, portions ample. Among two people you'd do good to share 4 small plates or 2 large plates or 2 small and 1 large. We went with 4 small plates for variety and were pleased with 3 out of 4. Everyone raves about the figs and it's warranted because they're really good. But I'm honestly getting a little tired of the reliance on bacon to add flavor and wrapping it around things to add panache to foods. This wouldn't have been so bad had I not noticed that they added bacon to their watercress pasta small plate, rendering what could be a good option for vegetarians obsolete. Nevertheless the watercress pasta with bacon and spring vegetable medley (asparagus, artichoke, and fava bean) was really hearty and tasty. The pasta came as a rectangular sheet, which was topped with breadcrumbs. Great texture, though would've wished to taste more of the watercress bite in the pasta. Was not happy with the cuttlefish. The cuttlefish was cooked really well, some of the most tender I've had in my life, but the flavor of the sauce it was resting in was such a let down when compared to the red bell pepper sauce of the dates. Had the beef and pork sausage as well that was served with cannelini beans. VERY flavorful, if not a little bit too salty. We had to ask for extra bread to mellow out the saltiness of the sauce it came with; then again I would've asked for more bread anyway because the bread is amazing! Freshly baked in their in-house wood-fired oven. Crispy crust  with light, airy interior. We could not resist asking for 3 small rounds throughout our meal. Dessert was innovative, offering a house chocolate candy plate in place of your usual cake/pastry. It was cardstock paper thin pieces of milk and dark chocolate peppered with crispy, sweet crumbles of feulletine (crepe flakes). An entire plate of this chocolate ""bark"" is too much for two people. It became onerous to eat, and really would have been more classy if just given as a complimentary sweet at the end of the meal, one piece per person, kind of like a fortune cookie.  Service was good. Our glasses were filled with water at all times. Wine was replenished. The pacing of our meal was also good, plates given sequentially as we finished each one, despite a VERY busy service. In truth there may be some refining to be done with some of the dishes but I do love what this place represents and am anxious to see the food evolve over time.

One side is a bar and the other side consists of 3 or 4 communal tables. Be prepared to scoot in and out of your seat as new people are seated at your table. Since everyone is so close and the place is so small, it can get very loud and you'll have to shout to communicate.  The food was amazing! We ordered the chorizo stuffed dates, laughing shrimp, watercress pasta, hanger steak, and roasted chicken. My hands down favorite dish was the stuffed dates. They were nice and big and full of chorizo and if that wasn't enough, they were wrapped in bacon and smothered with a piquillo pepper and tomato sauce. All the dishes were completely different flavor-wise and everything was just so good.  The service was equally great.

I rarely complain about noise, but this is definitely louder than a hard-rock café and thus it's hard to hear someone across the table.  So to the food: I started out with the Chorizo-Stuffed dates which are ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. Heck, the trip out there is worth it just for those. I also had a focaccia. Let me explain it: it's not focaccia. It's better. Think Indian Naan filled with a luscious cream but with the thickness of a focaccia. So it's just fluffy and blissful.  Then came an orange sausage. No, not coloured orange, but made with orange. This was... depressing. It was really not worth it. There's a pork dish with puff pastry, however, that was also delightful.

After all that richness, we ordered a bottle of Primitivo, salad with grilled fennel, watermelon radishes and ricotta salada, and also the sturgeon with shaved beets, ramps (gotta love ramps!) and cilantro vinaigrette.

Second off, I heard great things about the food here and it was decently crowded on a Tuesday night. However, after eating here, I just didn't feel like this is somewhere I'd want to come back to. I agree with other reviewers, the hostess is a little snotty. She refused to seat us until our entire party was there, which is fine, but she didn't let us sit at the bar because those are dinner seats too. This place is so small that there is literally no place to wait if your friend is stuck in traffic! You kind of have to huddle by the door which isn't a fun experience.

Our waitress was okay but I wish she were dressed a little nicer. I mean, isn't this supposed to be a trendy place?  And finally, after eating myself until I was stuffed, I felt sick all night.

Food and wine were decently priced for what was on the menu. The bad: Totally uncomfortable seating: Wood chairs on one side look cool, but don't have a back, so you have to really lean on the table or have the best posture in the world. Also, family style seating i.e. picnic table like tables are fine, but my girlfriend had to constantly get up and down so people could get out! After the sixth time I was pretty pissed. Also, no reservations meant sitting in another restaurant (as Avec does not really have a bar or waiting area) for an hour to get a table. Lastly, I had one great dish, one okay dish, and one horrible dish...I expect excellence in my $100 dining experience (for two with cheaper wine).

We got a number of small plates, but the highlights were definitely the chorizo stuffed dates (O. my. GOD) and the foccacia with taleggio and truffle oil. It was just so. good. And really, for the absolutely phenomenal, still-remember-exactly-what-it-tasted-like-6-months-later food, the price isn't bad at all.  I liked the cafeteria seating - the interior of the restaurant is just really cool looking, with all the light wood.

Purposely went early on a weekday to beat any rush - for whatever reason waiting in lines has become particularly annoying for me recently. Had the dates, of course, and they were indeed quite good. The spice and meatiness of the chorizo and the sweetness of the dates provided a nice balance to one another, and a plain tomato sauce was perfect for cutting the richness of the dish just a tiny bit. Not sure the bacon added much to the environment, and perhaps the dates overpowered the chorizo a bit, but those are minor quibbles. Overall, really enjoyed the pairing of these disparate ingredients to create a flavor that was new and exciting, but satisfying in the most familiar way.  We also had an apple, honeycomb and prosciutto salad which was perfect for a surprisingly warm Chicago spring evening. Refreshing and rich in one bite. Unfortunately, the rest of the offerings disappointed. The pork shoulder was fall off the bone tender, yes, but I felt that it didn't offer much in the way of flavor. After hearing about its glories, I was left feeling let down - and it isn't as if braising a pork shoulder requires any particular acumen. I've certainly had much better from supposedly 'lesser' restaurants. Same for the fried smelt - good, but for the price certainly not good value. Especially considering I could swing down to Chinatown and have a superior fried smelt, dressed with salt, pepper and jalapeno, for a fraction of the price.  Dessert was the biggest letdown - $6 for a tiny portion of pomegranate sorbet, which tasted how I imagine pure high fructose corn syrup might taste.

For those fellow New Yorkers who have been to momofuko will see a very similar esthetic but the back wall of glowing wine bottles really makes it. Flew in last Friday night and headed straight to the restaurant. While there being at least a 45 minute wait we were directed to the outdoor waiting area to enjoy drinks and being 80 degrees outside at 8pm this was the perfect way to spend time waiting. The wine list is extensive while offering bottles, glasses and even 250ml in order to get a good taste and try a few out while you are at it. At $11 not a bad way to get 3 glasses of wine (considering you are at a restaurant) Although the wine was a bit warm, I wonder how it is being stored?? As mentioned above the decor made the night, we had bar seating and could watch the cooks in action (although it was very hot in the restaurant, maybe because we were so close to the cooks?).  I would have been okay without the blaring hip hop music as the environment of the packed restaurant would have sufficed.   The menu consisted of a lot of different options, some being safe choices and others being more on the experimental side i.e. chorizo stuffed dates wrapped with bacon and banger sausage. We decided to stick with marinated olives, a mixed salad (blah) and red snapper which was a whole fish and not a filet. Normally would be fine but was not as described. Avec is definitely worth another shot as the flat bread with arugula and the cheese/salumi is what I really wanted to try, but on a hot night just really did not put me in the mood.

2010-03-01,4.0,"Avec is my go-to place in the city when I feel like eating  a hearty, home-style meal especially during the cold months in Chicago. I find the food to be heavy to eat during the summer months, but that's just me. Go try it! Everyone's been talking about their dates - get them, and get the pork shoulder, too. I know, it's a lot of pork product, but you won't be disappointed. I've had to deal with the long wait during the weekends, so I  have learned to compromise and I typically hit this place up during the week and try to come before the after-work crowd piles in. What's great about this place (besides the food and wine list )- you have a warm and welcoming ambiance with a young/young-at-heart crowd, so there isn't a snobby ""don't ask questions about our menu"" vibe (much like its neighbor, Blackbird, next door). You get SO much for your money here. The prices are ""student friendly"" if you decide to split the bill with your friends. I wouldn't suggest bringing a huge crew with you - limit the group to 5 at the most if ya'll want to be seated together quickly.",0.9856,0.827,0.162,0.012,0.5533333333333333

I don't mind communal dining, but it's kind of awkward when one side of the table is a booth-- I had no way to get out! Beyond that gripe, the food was EXCELLENT.  We ordered wine, which was light and lovely, though I don't know what kind it was since my date ordered my glass without consulting me (points off for him, not avec.)  We got the oft-mentioned chorizo stuffed dates, which were INCREDIBLE, an order of the veal livers, which I highly recommend even if you're scared of weird bits, and the gnocchi with oxtail and kumquats and some other stuff I don't remember-- it all sounded weird but was perfect in combination. The service was really friendly and quick, the ambiance is great-- the people at one end of our table had some kind of beautiful crazy absinthe drinking contraption-- and the food is delicious.

It's probably the best comfort food I have ever eaten. The idea alone for stuffing dates with a pork product..and then wrapping them in another equally as good pork product is legendary. I could have eaten probably 7 of them. They should have contests on how many you can eat like the lamb fries in Great Outdoors except these are not testicles..they're dates. Way better..in my opinion. The pork shoulder (which I learned is cooked on a 12 hour braise over night) was great. Separately it was not as good as the eaten together. I'll explain. If you ate the pork, then ate the dumpling, then ate the squash..they are all very good. Put those suckers together and you have a party the likes of Rick James AND George Clinton in your mouth. You think that's not possible? Try it. Strap in first because that's one crazy party. The only thing that outshines the food is the service. Seriously top rate. The bus is on top of everything, but not intrusive, and the waiter/bartender/concierge is informative, likeable, and honest. He made the night.

Yes, it is an odd choice for dinner before a sporting event but it was good nonetheless. :) At first, I felt silly walking in because it took us a second to figure out just where the door was. The set up for this place is really cool. Low lights, wooden walls, simple chairs and tables gave this place a really cool vibe. Or I'm just easily impressed. The party next to us were all drinking their expressos and speaking french - loved it! We ordered the Chorizo-stuffed Medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce and pork shoulder. The dates arrived first and I wasn't too impressed, they were spicy and sweet but didn't really blow me away. Not terrible by any means but not what I expected. The pork however, made the meal magical. The meat was so tender it feel right apart when I pulled it with my fork. So juicy and very flavorful. Excuse me as I wipe my mouth of drool. I definitely recommend trying this out. For drinks, we voted against wine, even though they have a large selection of enticing wines, we figured beers at the game were good. Instead we went with masala chai tea and cafe avec. Both were very good too! What also made me fall a little more in love with this place was the bill. Not just the fact that it inexpensive for a very good meal but the waiter hand wrote our bill. I don't know why but I thought that was really personable and cute.

2010-01-29,5.0,"Let me start off this review by saying that I absolutely, positively love love LOVE Avec. This restaurant was recommended to me by a couple of my friends during a trip to Chicago. They definitely did not lead me astray.  My friends and I came here on a Saturday evening and it was pretty crowded, both inside and outside of the restaurant.  There is a small patio in front of the restaurant which serves as a waiting area.  And wait we did. Luckily we were able to enjoy two bottles of red wine outside in the patio while we waited which gave us time to peruse the menu and get recommendations from one of the friendly wait staff on what to order. Our wait time came close to two hours but it was hardly noticeable with the wine consumption and great conversation. And even though that seems like a ridiculous amount of time to stand outside for food, it was completely worth it.  The restaurant itself is fairly small but it is, by far, the most coolest restaurant that I've ever dined in.  The decor is a testament to simplicity.  It is a narrow dining space with communal tables and bench seating but the use of wood throughout the restaurant creates a streamlined cohesiveness that is very pleasing to the eye.  The staff here was very pleasant and helpful. I'm not sure who was in charge of the play list but the music here was fantastic! It's always makes me giddy to hear good ear candy at a restaurant and none of that top 40 stuff.  On to the important stuff, the food! The menu at Avec is fairly extensive with various small and large plates to share. Think of it as a French tapas style restaurant if you will. I haven't dined here since September '09 but the following dishes will forever hold a warm, delicious memory in my heart... and stomach: Chorizo Stuffed Medjool Dates  Three words: Oh Em Gee. Ok, those are letters. A few more words then: The best dates I've ever had!! This was the first time I've ever eaten a date (hah!) and it just completely blew our table away. They were wrapped in smoked bacon and accompanied by a peppery tomato sauce. This dish was just absolutely divine.  Tuna Apple Flatbread Pizza It seems like an odd combination but the tuna and crisp apple were perfect complements.  I'm not really a fan of pizza but this was a great divergent from your traditional pizza.  It was very light and refreshing.  Meatballs with Orzo We spent some time trying to figure out what Orzo was as it looks and tastes a lot like rice.  The meatballs were flavorful and delicious.  We also ordered the Wood Braised Pork Shoulder, Fois Gras, Chicken, and some other meat dish (overall a lot of meat that night!) but I can't quite remember the details of each dish.  I do recall that none of us at our table of four were disappointed by any of the dishes that we were served.  The food just continued to amaze and delight our palates. To the chefs of Avec: Kudos for making such an outstanding meal! The next time I see a cheap deal for airfare to Chicago, I'm booking my flight just to dine at Avec again.",0.999,0.758,0.212,0.03,0.5335046611237088

(this is the only time of year where reservations are accepted)  We arrived promptly at 8:30 and our table wasn't ready.  The six of us had cocktails next door at Meiji and the hostess said she would ring our cell phone once our table was ready.  By 9:15 - we were still hanging out at Meiji. Finally, at 9:30 we were seated in the WORST seat of the house - the one right at the front door where wind would catch us every few mins.   The restaurant was bustling and crowded.  We had one couple sharing with our party of 6 and I felt kinda of bad for them because we were starting to get a little fiesty from the cocktails we had waiting an hour for dinner and on an empty stomach - but this is supposed to be Avec's fun concept right? The dinner's theme was ""land and sea"" for $50 and a wine & beer pairing for an additional $25.  It was a good deal for the date and the number of courses but honestly, only one dish blew me away.  The rest of it was decent but definitely not outstanding. On a positive note though, the staff were not sticklers about the wine pairings - if you happened to have finished your wine before the course came, they were very good at filling up your wine.  Two of the five pairings were outstanding and well worth $25. I was a little peeved that we didn't get out of dinner until 11:30 which only gave us a short amount of time to get to our next destination to toast in the new year.  I thought I had it well planned to do dinner at 8:30 but didn't expect that they would seat us an hour late. I will return again because I can understand that a restaurant serving the same thing over and over again can be uninspiring.  I'd like to come back to give it a chance but doubt it will happen soon because I hate restaurants that don't offer reservations and I don't wait for my food.  That's how I roll.",0.7793,0.823,0.099,0.078,0.5563031576266869

The place wasn't packed like sardines (every table had patrons but we weren't rubbing elbows or anything). We got very attentive service by Sontra and the busboy who filled our water glasses. This is arguably one of three best meals I had in Chicago during my 5.5-day stay (we ate out 2-3 times a day). We had to, of course, order the chorizo-stuffed dates since they get written up so much! The sweetness and spiciness went together magically. We also had a very refreshing grapefruit salad and the pork shoulder, which was hearty and good but wasn't quite as flavorful as the other two dishes. Between the two of us this was more than enough food! We probably could've done with just three (or even just two) small plates rather than two small and one large plate. Sontra suggested a bottle of Garnacha by Las Rocas which was very versatile and balanced. She wasn't too knowledgeable about certain items on the food menu which I thought was unfortunate since she had been working there for several years.

I came into Chicago on a Thursday evening and after getting off the plane and taking the train into the city to drop off my bags, Avec was the first place I headed to. For a place that doesn't take reservation, I was at first a little shocked that the wait was an hour long at 9pm. But having friends reassure me that this was worth the wait, we just grabbed a few beers and waited outside. They had a great beer selection - I had just returned from Spain not too long ago and I was very surprised to see one of my favorite Spanish beer on the menu. While the restaurant space itself is smaller than one would think, but the atmosphere in there is great.  The food is unique - in a good way. Smaller portions that encourage you to share with your party while having great conversation. The chorizo-stuffed dates is a must. That might be one of the best single bites I've ever put in my mouth. The pork shoulder was tender and very nicely done. Of the 5 things we ordered, I did not find a single thing I could complain about.  This place is what every restaurant should be like... unpretentious, simple menu with sophisticated flavors... If I'm ever in Chicago again, Avec is for sure going to be one of the places I'll be eating at. If you don't want to wait, go early and avoid the crowd.

Lady, if you use unusual ingredients on the menu, prepare to explain them.  The restaurant's decor is great - the music could be turned down a notch though. We all love Thom Yorke, we just don't need him wailing over the many conversations in such a narrow space.  The food... I love the menu. Inspired combinations, varied selection of meats, however..where's all the vege dishes? Two of our group of four are vegetarian and we were unimpressed with the offering.  The only entree was a pasta dish which changes daily. When we asked what it entailed, the waitress whispered with the chef right behind our table and - rather than the chef just explain it to us - the waitress turned and said, 'watercress, suede, rutabaga....' WHAT? Judging by the menu, they clearly had other vegetables on hand, so what's with all the roots?    Instead we shared each of the vegetarian starters (all overly salted, although the squash/arugula salad was great), the focaccia (lovely, but far too salty) and a cheese platter. Which was fine for two small vegetarians... I wouldn't recommend it if you're hungry, though. As for dessert... two options. Lemon tart (served cold and alone on a butter plate) and a flour-less bitter chocolate cake with cinnamon ice-cream. Emphasis on the bitter. Fortunately the ice-cream was delicious.. if not a little unseasonal when it's snowing outside!) My advice: another vegetarian main course option. A little less salt on EVERYTHING.

2009-12-21,4.0,"I enjoyed my experience at Avec.  The food was good/acceptable; not spectacular. We went on a Wednesday night; we gave our name and only had to wait 30 minutes (which I thought was great considering I've heard of 2 hour waits since they don't take reservations).  We went next door and got a drink; they called our cell phone when they were ready for us. The staff was uber pleasant.  They were very personable; they actually seem happy to see you. Overall the food was good.  Amongst three people we had: -The Chorizo Stuffed Dates wrapped in Bacon: This was good; maybe not to die for as some say though.  It had heat, nothing overwhelming.  This dish probably had the most diverse flavor profile of all the dishes we had.  I would get this again. -Sunchoke crostini:  This was good.  It's light.  It was nice to have greens to cut the heaviness of the other items we had. -Bolognese Pasta: This was enjoyable, but nothing to write home about.  It was made well but still seemed to be a standard issue bolognese.  The fresh pasta seemed homemade; still, not earth shattering or anything. -The Flatbread with Pheasant Sausage: This was probably the most underwhelming entree we had.  It was prepared nicely; but still it was very ordinary.  It's very similar in style to something you might get at Quartino. -The Pork Cheeks:  I enjoyed this.  The cheeks were very tender.  If anything was wrong with them they might have been slightly dry.  They're served over kishka; which was good. Something I really appreciated about the entrees that included bread was that attention was obviously paid to the quality of the bread.  The dates came with a mini country loaf; it was hot out of the oven.  The crostini used a baguette cut on the bias; the crumb was excellent, the crust was pleasantly crisp. Unfortunately, after our entrees I felt like we fell off the waitstaff's radar.  We ordered dessert, and instead of the dessert we were given the bill.  After we pointed this out it took a while to get the dessert.  Then when it came it was really disappointing. The chocolate lava cake was bad.  Instead of being warm, firm on the outside and runny on the inside; it was like eating a dense lukewarm brownie topped with average ice cream.  This was a letdown; especially after the ordeal of trying to get it. The only other thing that really bugged me was when we ordered a bottle of wine for the table; the bottle came to the table already open.  I imagine this establishment is honest and no one died as a result of the incident; but this is just Wine Service 101.  If the bottle we ordered had been more expensive; I would have been pissed and would have said something. You wouldn't like this place if you don't like tapas, loud conversations around you, sitting at the same table as other people you don't know (and having to get up for them if they need to leave), or hard wooden seats. For me though, I would return.  For the quality offered it's a pretty good deal.  With a modestly priced bottle of wine we spent a little under $40 a person after tax before tip.  This would be a fun place to take a small group from out of town.  It's cozy; but still alive with activity.",0.994,0.796,0.145,0.059,0.5694102564102564

The bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates were great, as was the fish special, a whole dorado. Everything else - the crostini, pork cheeks, focaccia, veal ragu pasta, salmon and sausage - were just OK. Compared to the depth of flavor and seasoning on the dates and dorado, these dishes were noticeably lacking. The thing that bothered us most, though, was the service. The greeters and seaters were lovely, but the waitress was chilly at best. There were several instances where we had questions about the menu or the status of our orders, and rather than explain the situation, we received snotty replies. For instance, when asked for the second time about an appetizer, which we clearly want sooner than later and which is clearly delayed compared to other apps, why not look into it or explain the deal, rather than snip ""everything is on the way, SIR"" for the second time, only for it not to arrive for 15+ mins (25+ from the first time you were asked)?",0.986,0.808,0.167,0.025,0.41911027568922304
2009-12-18,1.0,"I have to say that I used to be a huge Avec fan in the past. Undoubtably, Avec has some outstanding, very creative dishes from stictly a culinary standpoint. However, I have to say that after the last experience I had with them, I will definitely never go back.  1) Waiting approx 1+ hrs for a table is ridiculous. The food is good, but it isnt that good. There are no pre-reservations and you have to show up at the restaurant, and then make a reservation for 1+ hrs. Whoever owns this place is off their rocker full of themselves. The food at Avec is excellent, but it wont last in the long run provided the reasons below 2) The waitstaff are prentetious and act like they are something they are not. Very rude and inattentive! I normally always tip 20%, but after the treatment I received last time I went to Avec, I actually made it a point to tip $0. I'm not sure what they are going for (NY or something), but rude and attitude do not work in Chicago, we are nice people 3) The lighting in Avec is so bright (to try and increase its turnover and get people from staying long periods of time at the table) that I felt I was on Broadway or something. Nobody is perfect of course but I definitely dont want people to see all my imperfections under a makeup lamp (I'm a straight male too) 4) Packed like cattle. Tables are packed in like sardines. I personally do not want anyone rubbing up against me while I'm eating or ease-dropping in on my conversation but at Avec, you're gonna be sure it's guaranteed to happen. So, watch what you say otherwise the table brushing up right next to you is going to make fun of everything you say 5) Food is Avec's saving grace. Excellent and creative, but for the prices, there are many other places to choose from without the rest of the poor treatment and nonsense of being treated like a child in the cafeteria. 6) Sum: Avec is more about making money than pleasing the customer. Very disappointing since the food is so good and the restaurant vision has so much great potential.

Enter the elongated room where they've definitely made the most of their space.  Behind the counter you have the chefs, the bartender.  There are a couple seats at the counter and long tables from the entrance to the exit.  Get comfortable with not having personal space because you'll probably be sitting next to strangers that can hear everything that you say, so you should probably save the illegal business and family drama for later.   I ask the waiter for a white wine that isn't too sweet, mildly fruity, and crisp tasting.  He brings a vinho verde which was actually perfect for what I wanted.  Then we look to the ""tapas-like"" menu, where everything is made to be shared. Everyone raves about the chorizo stuffed dates.  And I will add to that raving.  The dates add a subtle sweetness to the chorizo and the bacon wraps all of that up in a perfect, tidy package.  The tomato sauce encompasses the meatballs in perfect harmony and adds a great spicy kick.  This comes with fresh baked rustic bread that pairs very well with the meat. We also had the sunchoke (root of a plant similar to sunflower, we were told) crostini (little bread) with shaved Brussels sprouts, radish, in a light delicious truffle vinagrette.  This was absolutely amazing.  It has a very nutty flavor as the sunchoke is some sort of flower root that they mash up and the consistency tastes almost like hummus --served on crunchy bread.  The shaved radish and Brussels sprouts on top added a great crunchy texture. And this not being enough, we also felt compelled to order the wood-oven braised pork shoulder which is a large item (as if the 2 small ones before weren't already big enough for two hungry girls).  This comes complete with mussels, tripe, and grape tomatoes.  This dish actually had a very Asian inspired taste to it.  Maybe it was the tripe.  Maybe it was the spices.  Either way, the pork just melts in your mouth and every bite is better than the last. And then, as if all of that wasn't enough, we had to order the pear tart.  It was almost like a crumble tart and it tasted pretty good with the spiced pumpkin-y ice cream on top.   Thank you, Avec.  It was truly a delicious culinary experience.  Oh.  P.S.  One of the chefs is totally good looking and I couldn't help but stare.  He was making awesome focaccia and the crostinis.  :)",0.9989,0.75,0.219,0.031,0.5152441485068604

2009-11-01,5.0,"I've been three times. Once completely sober with a lady friend for her birthday, once pretty hammered around 11pm on a Thursday, and again on a Monday to show a friend how amazing it is.  First time, there was a VERY long wait, we hung outside and had a beer. The manager took our drink order. Love to see a place that is totally hands on.  We were sat in the middle of a communal table and at first it was very hard to get acclimated to the noise. Two drinks down and that was all in the past. We had a handful of different options with beer to boot. We left with a full belly and money to spare in our wallets.  Second visit I went with a few grown ups, yes that's right, I am 25 and don't consider myself a grown up. We went very late, almost midnight? I now think that is the perfect time to go, we had our own table! There were 8 of us and one guest did all of the ordering. We had a few bottles of wine, the truffle flat bread, dates, and whole fish topped my favorites that night.  Third visit, we went on a Monday, about 30 minute wait at 9PM, tried to order a few different beers. Note to beer drinkers, they get their beer delivery on Tuesday, so they were out of almost everything we tried to order. We sat at the bar for dinner, and this has probably been my favorite experience. The kitchen is small and in your face, it's amazing the volume of food these guys put out every night. We ordered the dates, meatballs, truffle flat bread, chicken, and two others that are escaping me at the moment. WAY too much food, but props to the server for letting us know that ahead of time.

2009-10-24,5.0,"Ordered four scrummy small plates, one delectable big plate, and four boozy bottles of wine for three people (too much wine, obviously).  I ate with a real wine snob and apparently, Josh, the waiter, knows good wine.  Avec, the restaurant, also knows good food.  Really f---ing good food, let's not kid ourselves. The fact that they don't take reservations (and eat holes in my wallet) is the only thing stopping me from going back every other week night.  And then some. Like the brazen food ""connoisseurs"" we are, we ordered : chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with bacon & piquillo sauce; saffron marinated chicken thigh; crispy sweetbreads; flatiron steak; and braised pork shoulder with mussels, tripe, tomato and savory streusel.  The dates are insane.  Seriously.  I've made dates stuffed with camembert and wrapped in bacon before (gourmet party trick), and my dates look like a skinny, sad-eyed comparison to the voluptuous sweet and spicy roasted mess that got delivered to our table.  Everything else was really good, you know, by anyone's standards (and at any other dinner would have been a highlight).  Then came the pork shoulder--with mussels--in the most savory, finger-licking stew (or broth, or brew, or something).  Technicolor food FEST! I kept calling Josh by his first name and demanding he try our food (I may have been rather intoxicated by the time the final course arrived; hard to say).  He didn't oblige such demands, but did drink a fair bit of our wine.  Good chap, that one. The dessert--well, to be frank, I'm sure it was good, but memory gets a little hazy at that point. I do recommend the restaurant.  I've tried Blackbird and Sepia (same owners) and love them too.  Sepia, in particular, has ridiculously good cocktails, and some of the best front of house I've ever been party to.  But Avec has the best food, hands down.  I just hope they eventually start offering reservations, so I don't have to freeze my ass off for an hour the next time I want good cookin'.",0.9945,0.768,0.18,0.052,0.4910968660968662
2009-10-21,5.0,"UNBELIEVABLE. First, and most important: believe everything you've read about those chorizo stuffed dates. Well, except for the name, because in reality they are chorizo meatballs wrapped in dates and bacon. When you see an item with that name on a menu for $9, the picture in your head is not what you're going to get. Here I am imagining these little dates with a nibble of chorizo inside... instead, this is main course kind of food. I went so far as to save one last bite so it could be the last thing I ate before leaving. I will remember that dish forever. Luckily for us, Avec offers so much more. And from our tiny sampling of the menu, everything delivers in a surprising way. My girlfriend and I went on a Monday night, just before 6, and our timing couldn't have been better. I had assumed it would be crowded and we'd be sitting at the bar (if at all), but we were promptly seated and began enjoying a couple of beers almost immediately as we looked over the menu. The dishes at Avec are designed and portioned to be shared with others, which was perfect for us because we always wind up splitting entrees. We decided to go ""light,"" which meant we only chose 4 plates and an appetizer of house marinated olives, while skipping dessert. The starter plate of olives and bread was a perfect beginning, with a variety of olives each having a unique flavor (the smallest ones had a chocolaty note, while another kind definitely had a gorgonzola/blue cheese element).  Our next plate was the roasted sunchoke crostini. It was so unexpectedly flavorful that it rivals the aforementioned chorizo-stuffed dates for favorite part of the meal. Perhaps it was the truffle vinaigrette that added the perfect amount of saltiness to the fluffy, bitter greens, but whatever it was, this was the moment we really knew we were in for a special meal. Our third dish... did I mention the chorizo-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon? I can't stress enough how amazing this dish was. I told my girlfriend that I wished I lived in Chicago and worked nearby, just so I could make a weekly visit for this dish. The pequillo pepper tomato sauce was really what sent this into the stratosphere, with just enough acidity to tame the sweetness of the dates and the spice of the sausage.  Since we were unaware of what we were getting into with the chorizo-stuffed dates, we followed this meatball feast with a second meatball feast -- the turkey and guanciale meatballs with orzo. These were fantastic, but I'm sad to say that I could barely pay attention to them because I was still savoring the previous plate. Still, how can you go wrong with meatballs made from delicate bacon made from the jowls of a pig? The orzo was perfectly cooked as well. If you fear the spice of chorizo, perhaps this would be a good alternate choice? Finally, we capped our meal off with the roasted swordfish. It was delicious (I had never had swordfish). I was especially thrilled at how well the smoked ham hock complimented the fish, and absolutely stunned at the flavors in the braised chana dal. There was this wonderful lemon/citrus flavor that burst out after a few moments, turning the whole concoction into this wonderful mix of tender and crispy, smoky and sweet. Best of all: the price! This is top notch, gourmet dining at a pretty affordable price. Our tab (4 beers and 5 dishes) came to almost $80 before tip, and we could have (maybe should have?) trimmed one dish from our list and still remained absolutely stuffed. Of course, we regret not even glancing at the dessert menu, but one more bite could have ruined us. For those who don't like to rub elbows with others, be forewarned: the seating at Avec can be tight, as everyone basically sits together. This was actually kind of fun for us, because you get to ask people about their food or even give recommendations to a new party seated right next to you.  The service is quick and impeccable, and the setting is more of a dinner party atmosphere than I would have expected. Avec was completely without pretense or the snootiness one would expect from a 5 star establishment. My girlfriend and I were absolutely thrilled to be eating our meal to the sounds of ELO, and we were glad to get out as the sounds of ambient techno crept in.",0.9988,0.795,0.165,0.04,0.5865463540788214

How is that possible?""  How was that possible, I wondered. And then I knew the answer. Avec takes no reservations and has communal seating. Two things that don't bode well for business discussions and since about half of my eating out is work related in some way- Avec just fell to the side until I could make a personal visit on a night (Monday) at a time (6pm) where I thought the wait might be minimized. And it was.  We were seated immediately at the very back table right in front of the kitchen area. We started with some of the cheeses from ""the cave"" and the assorted salami plate. Terrific. And the bread that came to the table was so tasty as well. A friend had told me about the chorizo stuffed dates so we had to order those. And he was right. They were exceptional.  For entrees- we split the the pasta special of the day which was angel hair pasta with squid. Delicious. And finally, we tried the turkey meatballs with orzo. Perfect as well.  While several of that day's desserts sounded tempting- we decided to forego more food for an after dinner drink as we brought the evening to a close.  While the food was great- service was a bit off. Our server acted like she didn't know the menu and was slow to come up with suggestions. Also- we shared everything which seemed to again throw her off. But the food made up for any inconsistency in the service, that's for sure.  Will communal seating ever be my favorite? I doubt it. And not taking reservations? I'm a girl who hates to wait.

Yes, the hyped dishes are All That: the bacon-wrapped dates are utterly sumptuous (and I don't like dates) and the current preparation of hangar steak (no matter what it is) tends to be juicy and flavorful in the extreme.  The small pours of many different wines keeps Avec true to its wine bar roots and moniker.  So many neat things to try, and a great complement for the food.  The cheese selection is nice for a wine pairing and you can get a plate of accompaniments that includes Marcona almonds, panforte, and quince paste (which makes it all worthwhile for me, *dreamy sigh*).

This was fine for us because we weren't stuck in the middle of a communal table and it was less noisy where we were.   The menu is divided into small and large plates, all for sharing.  We ordered the salumi plate, 4 types of salumi served with piping hot bread, a small tart salad of cornichons and a sweet/hot mustard spread.  We also ordered the famed bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates.  I am NOT a fan of dates or sweetness in my food but this dish was really surprisingly delicious.  There are 4 and they are the size or large meatballs, very good.  We also got the sweetbreads (we were being daring) and they were so delicious.  They reminded me or a smoky sausage that you would put into Thanksgiving stuffing.  They came with 2 triangles of garlic bread. Our last 2 dishes were carb city, the taleggio focaccia, which I liked but expected to be different.  It was pretty much two large pieces of focaccia with a layer of melty taleggio cheese in between, like a swanky grilled cheese.

2009-09-26,4.0,"Thursday , 7:30  , 2 for dinner Was told there would be a 30 minute wait but was seating in about 5 minutes.  Minimalist décor, a trendy spot.  No TVs!  Though perhaps not the best choice for a first date.  Seating is commune style so there isn't much privacy as you're seated shoulder to shoulder with other diners.  Could be fun, if you like to chat up strangers.   I only have 2 minor complaints:  (1)  It's a little on the loud side; I found it hard to maintain an easy conversation.   (2)  the chairs are hard, check out the restaurant pics, its like sitting on a coffee table, without a back.  Tough for a 2 hour dinner.   A +   Chorizo-stuffed Medjool dates w/ smoked bacon and pepper-tomato sauce    you've heard it 100 times, and here it is again.  Get the dates.  Wonderful spicy delicious tomato sauce A +  Nichols Farm potato and cauliflower salad with haricots verts.  A surprise star for me.  I didn't think I'd like potatoe salad but again there was this wonderful spiciness A   Pan-roasted mackerel with mint-cured bacon, garbanzo beans.   Nice presentation, easy lemon flavor and of course bacon makes everything better.  I love garbanzo beans. B    Wood-fired flatbread with Spanish bonito tuna, celery root, pickled Melrose peppers, egg and market apples.   Maybe not the best choice.  A crisp crust, and meaty tuna taste.  Not over fishy, but the apples didn't add much to this dish.  And I wasn't as delighted as I was but everything else.    C+   Service.  Our waitor was maybe a little overworked?  I wanted to like him because he was pleasant and brief.  But one of our orders didn't make it in and he forgot about us halfway through the meal : we waited about 15 minutes for another round of drinks and 15 minutes for the check.

I had heard all the wonderful things about Avec (""Get the dates!  You MUST get the dates!!!!) but I did not have the opportunity to personally partake until this past Thursday night.  The fiancee heard some good news on the work front so we decided to heard to Avec to celebrate.   When we arrived at around 6:30 PM, we found out (much to our pleasant surprise) that there would be no wait.  What?  No wait on a Thursday night at Avec?  Sweetness.  Right then I knew the stars were aligned for us tonight so we were undoubted going to have a most excellent meal. The meal itself was terrific.  Service was friendly and pleasant and we lucked out in sitting next to a family visiting from Dallas.  (On a side note: how many tourists do you know go eat at Avec?  Color me impressed.)  But to be honest, it was the food that won us over.  Our feast for the evening: * Salumi Assortment - Three slices of four different salumi's.  I don't recall exactly what we got but it was excellent, especially with the awesome Avec bread.   * Turkey and Guanciale Meatballs - If you haven't heard of guanciale before, it's basically pork cheek.  And as we all know, any sort of cheek (beef, cod, etc) is bound to be tasty.  These meatballs were no exception to the rule, as they were absolutely juicy and flavorful. * Chorizo-Stuffed Dates - Ah, the infamous dates.  The first thing I noticed was how ginormous they were.  By my guess, one date was the equivalent of a child's fist, which sounds small until you try to put one in your mouth.  Ok, that sounded slightly disturbing but you catch my drift.  Anyway, the dates were as good as advertised.  Stuffed with chorizo AND wrapped with bacon -- come on.  How can you go wrong? * Braised Pork Shoulder w/Clams and Tripe - Believe it or not, I actually liked this dish better than the dates.  Perhaps it's because I'm a sucker for anything braised.  Seriously, braise any type of meat and I'll happily eat it (same goes for deep frying).  While the shoulder was moist and tender as expected, the real surprise was the tripe.  I like tripe at dim sum and in pho but that's about it.  However, the tripe that came with this dish was wonderfully prepared and absolutely delicious.

Hate the communal tables.  Lots of people outside just drinking which I found odd considering the food is inside! I had high expectations for this place and I was slightly disappointed. We ordered the eggplant crostini with sweet corn and arugula salad, the medjool dates with bacon and chorizo, ""blt"" with foie gras, and the braised pork shoulder with white beans and basil/cashew pistou.  Eggplant crostini was tasty and I am not a fan of eggplant!  I enjoyed the vinaigrette over the corn and arugula salad.  My husband found it a bit sour although in general he is not a fan of vinaigrettes.  The medjool dates had good flavor, but in my opinion had too much chorizo, and not enough dates. It was a little too spicy for me to really enjoy it.  I love spicy but for some reason the spicyness overpowered the taste of the whole dish.  The ""blt"" with foie gras was good but not great.  Pan-seared foie gras with tomatoes and a light salad sprinkled with bacon bits.   It's an interesting and creative dish but not satisfying.  The vinaigrette was similar to the one with the eggplant crostini.  Lastly, we had the pork shoulder. I love pork and this pork was definitely braised slowly since it fell apart as I picked it up. The most disappointing part was that it was significantly under-seasoned.  I enjoyed the pistou with the pork and the beans, but all of it was a bit bland even when I ate them altogether. I was slightly disappointed by this restaurant. I've decided that this restaurant has potential and deserves a second try.  I will return.",0.9788,0.772,0.147,0.081,0.5539035087719297

We got there around 7:30 and were told the wait was going to be 1 hour. Fine, we went elsewhere for drinks and came back an hour later. The wait time was now 45 minutes. Wait...yes. one hour, fourty five minutes later we got our seats. In our party, there was one person who has never been to avec before, so we ordered the mandatory stuffed dates. They were much spicier than I remember. I went through a couple of glasses of water just to eat one date.  The next dish that was brought out was prosciutto with ricotta with peaches and mint. Honestly, after eating the dates, the prosciutto tasted bland, almost flavorless. It could be because my mouth was still on fire, or it could be because the prosciutto was, in fact, nothing more than slices of (very fine) meat paired with ricotta and peaches. Then we got Focaccia (flatbread) with Teleggio cheese and truffle oil. Oy. The smell and the taste of the truffle oil (first time for me) was overwhelming. It reminded me of someone with really bad breath. My friend (who's had truffle oil before) said that they might've just used too much.  We had pan-friend fish which was really really good. Usually, I never order fish because I'm not really a fan. But I ended up eating most of it. BLT. Well. It was the best dish of the evening. Pan Roasted Foie Gras - melts in your mouth. Heirloom tomatoes were really fresh and extremely flavorful. Tomato Bacon vinaigrette was the ""cherry on top"". The bacon came in tiny pieces, crunchy, cooked to perfection.

2009-09-03,4.0,"I was so glad finally to make it to Avec.  The cuisine has intrigued and enticed me for several months.  It really helps to have a guide who knows the menu, as I did, because there are so many great choices that an indecisive orderer like me could probably end up spinning my wheels until they kicked me out.  I wish that I had tried one or two more dishes (particularly the hanger steak, boar sausage, or pork shoulder) but that's easy to say sitting here with an empty stomach.  I'll just have to return again soon... We started with the dates (hold that thought) and a newer menu item, the potato/cauliflower salad with sun-dried tomatoes, green beans, and anchovy vinaigrette.  I really liked the earthier flavors of the potato and cauliflower together with the more traditionally salad/""green"" flavor of the beans.  Do not fear that the anchovy vinaigrette will overwhelm the other flavors--it did nothing but nudge and accent.  Well done. The bacon/chorizo dates have quite a reputation, and deservedly so.  I notoriously do NOT eat fruit and meat together.  It took a lot of arm-twisting to make this exception, and I have to say that this dish came very close to making me forget about my rule.  The date flavor comes in late, and the sweetness is strongly handled (almost banished) by the savory/spicy chorizo.  This sausage, made in house, is flat-out amazing.  I could eat it plain with bread and be very happy.  Probably the weakest aspect of the dish was the texture, not the flavor, of the dates.  They were just a bit of mush being crushed under the weight of the meats.  The red-pepper sauce is a perfect complementary touch. We intended to order a fourth dish, but as it happened, the brandade was our last of the evening.  They brought us extra bread, and we practically cleaned the bowl.  If you are thinking ""What--pureed fish and cheese dip?"" please don't skip it for that reason.  It does not taste overly ""fishy"" and was really sort of...delicately rich?  Is that a paradox?  None of the flavors are too heavy, but it is very flavorful.  The brandade would have been a great ""in between"" course, except that we filled up on it and didn't feel like eating more meat.   Oh well, I'll just have to make another visit when I am feeling more carnivorous (i.e. days ending in ""y"").  Come early to get a seat!",0.9952,0.805,0.156,0.04,0.5138558201058201

The food is inventive, yet uses classical ingredients and the dishes retain the distinct flavor of the individual ingredients.  (I'm not sure that the description of ""French, Basque"" is really that accurate -- it's more Mediterranean.  Think the southern regions of Spain, France and Italy.)  The food is perfectly executed, and is also timed out to arrive in the order in which they think you should eat (which I love).  My favorites are the dates and the deluxe focaccia.  Order them together and you will not regret it. On a recent visit, I went with a friend for her birthday.  We were instantly seated (at the bar), greeted and had a bottle of excellent wine at our table within 5 minutes!  I realize this is not the typical experience as the wait is usually quite long, but I guess going early on a weeknight served us right.  For our wine, we had the 2005 Mas Belle Eaux ""Les Coteaux"", which was velvety, rich, and went deliciously with the dates and the deluxe focaccia.  It was so good that I found myself hunting around for it today (and came across a pleasant surprise -- it retails for around $21, which means that Avec only marks it up by doubling the retail price instead of tripling it like most restaurants -- extra points for Avec).  Anyway, those two dishes were ridiculous, as usual.  We also tried the salad with fennel, cherries, onions and marinated feta cheese----yum! I was a bit hesitant to order it because I find that fennel can really overpower a salad if not used correctly.  I should have known not to doubt Avec!

F, T, M and A had been far into the meal (missed out on lots of amazing dishes) so what ever came out BFF and I ate it. Missed out on: Chorizo-stuffed Medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce  9 (but licked the sauce on the spoon -omg yums) Salumi and had a tease of the cheese plate (what's going on here soooo much tastier than NY) Housemade wild boar sausage with wild rice, poblanos, Nichols Farm currants and spring onions  12  (really good and I'm not that into sausage!) Marinated hanger steak with spigarello, guanciale, celery, tomato and strawberry salsa  12  (could this be any tastier and more tender??? excellent flavors) A mix of summer beans and vegetables light dressing -heavenly. James Beard Nomination and for a GOOD reason.   Organic white wine in gorgeous mini goblet glasses -class all the way through :-) I high recommend Avec just check out the website and be ready to drool --no lies.  This place is very casual with communal seating and a must!!!!

Truly amazing, superlative food, served in a bit of a quirky setting, yes, but listen to me when I say that's definitely a worthwhile tradeoff for the simply phenomenal eats. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm on a Saturday at the chef's counter near the back, which I would also describe as foodie heaven. Watching the chefs work was a real treat -- it was incredibly awesome (and eye-opening!) to watch the full preparation of every dish. Service is quick but polite -- we split a bottle of rose and when the bottle wasn't chilled, they gave us a couple of glasses on the house while we waited for it to cool on ice. Classy. Food was phenomenal - I had to try the dates based on all the other reviews and wow - they did not disappoint. The cheese plate was great with fairly generous portions of three cheeses picked from a list of around eighteen -- the fruit, quince, and nuts that accompany it were simple yet amazing as well. We also had the pasta made vegetarian, which was great -- I'm sure it's a second to the pasta with seafood, but seriously great layers of flavor and texture -- the earthy crunch of a carrot or bit of zucchini at the start with chewy fresh pasta in the middle and a flair of herbs at the end -- wow.

2009-08-10,4.0,"lol I laugh at some of these reviews. My sister loves this place and used to live close to this restaurant which is why we frequented this several times. Menu: Most of what you order is delicious. I can't remember the names. The bacon wrapped chorizo date thing is amazing. Their bread is warm and soft. I just remember not liking the Red Snapper. Fresh, but not my personal favorite. Everything else is really really good. Service: I liked it. Once we got to sit at the bar by where the chef prepares everything. He has one heck of a tiny space to work with but it was amazing watching him work it. :) He was really nice too. Atmosphere: The decor reminds you of a sauna. Posh in that sense. You sit close to others so if you're anti-social this is not the place for you. It gives the restaurant good energy. The Wait: We went here a lot last summer and it was always busy. We almost always had to wait bc it was so popular.  Any Cons: Can be a bit pricey. It's not super expensive, but you won't find a cheap menu here. I think it's worth it though. :)",0.9924,0.733,0.229,0.038,0.581547619047619

I would suggest going on a weeknight if possible as the restaurant is small and gets crowded quickly.  The wait can be long. The medjool dates stuffed with chorizo are amazing.  So delicious I got home and immediately looked up a recipe so I could attempt to recreate them at home.  The trout is also delicious as is the pork shoulder large plate.

Weird. It IS beautiful in there, planked wood everywhere (tables, floor, walls, ceiling), but this does nothing for the acoustics.  Pair that with the buzzed foodies pressing against your thigh and you've got a very loud establishment and many overheard conversations.  People were just having a good time, but I was not.  I had to raise my voice more than was comfortable, just to speak to my dinner companions.  Eh. That would have been enough, but there was also a drastic shortage of vegan options.  I found one small plate and another that was debatably legit.  Granted, what I had was tasty, but even if I'd have had choices and it was delicious, I can do without the noise and too-close-for-comfort seating.

In addition, Avec has a solid beer selection for relatively reasonable prices.  As I mentioned before, there is a considerable wait if you arrive later in the evening.  The restaurant itself is fairly small, with long communal tables and simple, modern decor.  Everyone working there was extremely nice (even the time we clearly had too much to drink beforehand).  What an awesome place.",0.9748,0.799,0.161,0.039,0.4532539682539682
2009-07-31,5.0,"Arrived at 6:30 with a friend for dinner on a Thursday. Avec doesn't take reservations but we were seated quite quickly in one of the few open spots left (in-between two parties, sharing the same table). They don't take reservations and it's clear why- they don't need to (the small, yet efficiently run restaurant was packed) and they simply can't afford to let space go to waste waiting on a reservation to show. They use every inch of space in that place and I mean inch. If you are someone who requires a certain amount of personal space, you will not enjoy your time at Avec.  So the food- a lean selection of small and large plates, all expertly prepared and intended to share. My companion insisted we have the shaved Brussels sprouts salad (I hate, hate, hate Brussels sprouts but agreed to try it) and it was my favorite dish of the night. A very complex dish- lemon, mint, dill, and other flavors working together for a unique taste: crisp and zesty. Perfect for a summer evening. We followed that with the bacon-wrapped-chorizo-filled dates. They were very large due to the stuffing. I have a long standing love affair with bacon-wrapped dates so this dish was not to be missed. I do admit I was a bit disappointed that the chorizo became the main flavor here, but they were delicious none the less and filling. We finished our meal with the deluxe focaccia with truffle oil. It was simply decedent deliciousness. I will say that living a 95% veggie lifestyle most of the time made it a bit tough for me to stomach these rich, not-quite-as-healthy foods but it was a much enjoyed treat.  We shared a bottle of wonderfully crisp white wine from their wine list. A wine enthusiast friend of mine warns to never spend over $25 for a bottle, but there were not too many options on Avec's list to meet that price, so expect to spend but also enjoy.  And that's what we did. Service was fast and friendly. Decor, modern minimalist; which went well with the food and general upscale ambiance. If you're visiting Avec, expect to enjoy a great food experience, but also expect to pay for it. These people know what they're doing.",0.9958,0.707,0.209,0.084,0.5198735119047619

The bacon wrapped dates is a must order.  Salty, smokey, sweet, spicy.  We had the good fortune of having our dates brought to us by Chef Grieveson herself.   The last to come out was the focaccia.  It was light, cheesy, crispy, and piping hot.  If you order this, eat it right away because that is when it tastes its absolute best.   They have dessert but not on a printed menu but if you ask any server or hostess, they will inform you on what is available.   Avec continues to be one of my favorites in the city.   With the food they keep churning out, it looks like it'll stay that way",0.9881,0.859,0.125,0.016,0.5934981684981686

2009-07-22,4.0,"This past weekend me and a few friends took a fifteen hour car ride from Boston to Chicago to go to Pitchfork fest. Before we left though, I asked the chef at the restaurant I worked at where I should go eat in Chicago, whereupon laughed at me and said ""Alinea, obviously."" and then proceeded to tell me about Avec. I was a little skeptical at first since I always feel awkward going into a place that is geared towards alcohol when I'm not 21, but I figured I would give it a shot.  So after fifteen hours of driving we finally get to the restaurant, only to have to wait for half an hour at 11PM. That's how busy this place is. The restaurant itself is really beautiful, a stark contrast to the minimalist white Blackbird next door. The communal aspect of dining combined with the wood paneling gives the place a really cozy warm feel, something you don't find in a lot of ultra-trendy/hip places. It is a little loud though, and we had to shout across the table at times to keep up the conversation. Also, while communal dining is pretty cool in that someone offered us their food after they were too full to finish it, having people dip their fingers into the salt and pepper was not. And I hope you don't mind people listening into your conversations because that's bound to happen as well.  But the food. The food was deliciously amazing. Like I said, we had just gotten finished a car ride that took us halfway across the country, so we were all hungry and tired (especially after that wait). The food did not disappoint. Everything was so heavy and rich and just full of flavor. Despite the fact that nothing here is conventional, it all felt like comfort food. The ""deluxe"" focaccia was one of the best dishes I've had in a while. The cheese inside of it was so creamy and savory, and the bit of truffle oil in it gave it that earthy smell that made it an olfactory wonderland.  Our group got the focaccia and flatbread to share. The flatbread was a little on the salty side, the olives and the relatively strong (but delicious!) cheese contributing to that. I personally got the dates since I heard so much about them on the site. While the sweet and spicy flavors were an interesting mix, I really wasn't all the impressed by it. The spiciness of the chorizo really overpowered a lot of the other flavors I thought. Maybe if it weren't so spicy it would have been better. It was a good dish, but I think the praise that it's getting is a little much. It was really filling though, a heavy dish, which was nice. Someone else in the group got the asparagus crostini, and she described the red bean hummus as one of the best she's ever had. Like I said earlier, the dishes here are all really rich and really filling. After eating a few pieces of the focaccia and a piece of flatbread, I was almost full and could barely stuff down three of the dates. But I loved that, everything just had so much flavor and was perfect for a bunch of tired hungry people late at night. I wish I felt as content and happy after every meal like I did after Avec. The price isn't bad too. For four people to the check came out to around 80 dollars, and we all left with full stomachs. Even though we all skipped out on having ""classic"" Chicago foods like burgers or pizza to go here, it was well worth it.",0.9991,0.779,0.196,0.025,0.5068689917281466

While some liken the wood panels to a 'sauna,' I find it a refreshingly clean and non-disrupting backdrop to the food experience. The community dining aspect is also something that some can find abrasive -- it isn't for everyone -- but when experienced with an open mind, I think it's only positive to be able to relate to others about the plates, cheeses and wine. You learn and experience more than what's just in front of you, and isn't that what ""Avec"" (with) is all about? The service was attentive, knowledgeable, but also casual and unpretentious. The servers seem genuinely excited by the food and were generous when it came to sampling different wines before ordering them. The bussers were on top of their game and I was never want for anything. A potential downside is the lack of reservations, but again, for me, it only added to the sense of community.

2009-07-09,4.0,"As you approach avec, you will be greeted by a crowd of people hovering around the empty barrels sipping from avec's delectable wine and beer selection as they anxiously await for their dining experience to begin. It takes a few moments to grab the hostess's attention, but while the wait may be painful, it is worth it. We were not picky and opted to take two seats at the bar conveniently located directly in front of the main chef. So with this fantastic seating opportunity, my sister and I did not shy away from finding out every detail of ingredients being used, recommendations for the evening, and other random questions we were dying to know about every dish that came out. He was a good sport in keeping his focus on the food while still having a moment or two to chat. We started with the chorizo stuffed dates which not to be redundant to the many other reviewers, were satiating. The spice in the chorizo complimented the sweetness of the date and the red pepper sauce they were cooked in added an even more dynamic layer of flavor. We were doubly surprised by the taste and the enormous portion size for the dates - very filling. Next came the hanger steak salad with fresh strawberries - unique combination of flavors and refreshingly light to follow the richness of the dates. Our main dish was the braised pork shoulder served in a broth with garlic sausage, tomatoes, pesto, and a pasta. Again the meat was unbelievably tender. However, at this point in the meal, we had a lot of meat and probably in hindsight would have gotten a lighter seafood dish (the trout looked so good, i was jealous we didn't go with that - have to come back again) instead of three hearty meat dishes.  Our meal was not yet complete until we savored the fried polenta cake with dried cherries served under a large drop of marscapone. Wow, I wish I could have had a few of those!

Slick maple woods and silvers and an open kitchen. It's like a restaurant inside a sauna shaped like a long shoebox. - Family style dining. Everyone sits together. I mean it. There are like, 5 tables total. If you get stuck next to some loud talker who will NOT shut up, you're pretty fucked - but you'd be fucked in any other restaurant too - you just wouldn't be RIGHT next to them. - The place was packed when we got there, so we were told to hang out outside and a bartender would be out to take care of our drinks. We hung out outside. Bartender never came. Sad face. - Once seated though, our server was super nice, super animated, and not too ""breathing down your neck"". He brought us a bottle of PINK champagne right away and it was awesome. - The crostini was nice - but only nice. Not mind-blowing. Asparagus had a great crunch to it but the red bean ""hummus"" was kind of meh. - I had never tried boudin before, but my friend recommended we try it. My reaction? ""Meh."" Not impressed. - The chorizo-stuffed dates with bacon? Holy jesus. I want like, fifteen orders of THAT. Sweet and savory and a great texture and just...wow. WOW. THAT gets 5 stars immediately. Holy shit. Just thinking about them makes me want more. - The pork shoulder? Da-yum. It was served in a little cast iron tub, marinating in this great sauce with noodles, sausage, squash and I forget what else. But it was tender as hell and everything in that little tub went together perfectly. If I could bump this place to 3.5 stars, I'd do it. But I can't.

I get that communal tables can be oh so avant garde and edgy - but seriously, I would've preferred more privacy.  Thank goodness, the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce was able to distract me from my surroundings. My taste buds had a serious party when the dates touched my tongue. You have to get the dish when you go - do not pass it up. In fact, get two orders. Or three. Perhaps four.  Mind-blowing, orgasmic, tantalizing stuffed dates aside, the brussels sprouts were actually quite delicious.  We also ordered the braised pork shoulder and it was good, however, nothing outstanding.

If you're going to eat, I'd advise going in a group of about four (any more than that, and you'll probably have trouble being seated as the space is small) and eating family style - you'll be able to sample many more dishes that way. They encourage this; while the dishes are listed on the menu as ""big plates"" or ""small plates,"" some of the ""small plates"" came out after some of the ""big plates"" because it made sense in the culinary progression.

I also noticed the communal seating which I haven't experienced before (except for family dinners in Thailand, not sure if that counts).  My roommate and I ordered the chorizo-stuffed Medjool dates which were PHENOMENAL. It was so phenomenal, I got an extra order just to take home and savor the next day. The foccacia was also excellent. We also ordered a braised pork shoulder which was quite tender and juicy with pesto flavoring, lima beans, pasta rings, and squash. This was mediocre in my opinion (in all fairness, I'm not a big fan of red meat). My roommate would beg to disagree and loved the fact it was served like a hearty stew.  Toward the end of the meal, Avec started getting crowded, and that's when the communal seating began to get annoying. It got much louder as everyone was talking over each other to carry out their conversations. Would recommend bar seating instead if you're lucky to find a spot.

The scopey menu ensures there will be something for everyone in your group.  Don't get too attached, though - you're meant to share!  The wine list can look intimidating, but the servers know their stuff and will happily point you in the right direction.  The best dish of the meal was the skate-wing, which was a special.  It was perfectly cooked, seared to perfection and dressed with an asparagus and olive salad.  The communal seating arrangements can be seen as either a detriment or a bonus for the restaurant; it depends what you are going there for.  If you're going for a first date, say, it might be a little awkward to be plopped down in the middle of a long table full of people.  But, if you're going with people that you actually know, then it's a lot of fun to make friends with the people around you.  It's a lively, friendly atmosphere.  I think that it is the combination of this atmosphere and the excellently prepared food that keep Avec feeling fresh and sitting at the top of most people's ""best restaurants in Chicago"" list even after being open for (I believe) over 4 years.",0.9973,0.706,0.281,0.013,0.519973544973545

I wasn't in charge of ordering since one of my co-workers had been there before and was adament on what we should try (definitely the cheese dish).   As far as communal seating, it was fine...we ended up overhearing conversations from the group next to us and vice versa...so chatted them up for the latter half of the evening.

2009-02-24,5.0,"Avec is one of THE best restaurants in Chicago.  It is THE epitome of greatness. Hands down.  I kid you not.  It's one of the few places of its league that I want to go back to consistently.  I know Chicago has a ton of great restaurants and going to the same place all the time may seem almost a waste of time, but Avec is the exception.  Yes, it is THAT great. I am picky.  And not just about food.  I am high maintenance about the service and atmosphere that my food is served in.  I don't eat just to get full - I eat for the food.  I would rather starve than eat bad food.  My boyfriend can verify all of that in a heartbeat.  Anyway.  Back to Avec.  Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) on Avec's menu is consistently delicious in a very down-to-earth kind of way; the inviting, warm, casual-yet-chic atmosphere as well as the spunky, personable servers only enhance the entire experience.  I am usually not a fan of communal-style seating in a restaurant but Avec somehow does it right - it is cozy and intimate and the crowd there is always friendly so it works perfectly with the whole ambiance.  I will not sit here and recommend specific dishes that you need to try because I am certain that no matter what you order, you will not be disappointed.  The food comes in small portions (which I absolutely LOVE) so you can get a fair sample of a good portion of the menu.  One thing that I will say is definitely try the wines - it comes in smaller portions so you can have more variety.  They have a wonderful collection of wines and the servers make great recommendations.  It is an open kitchen, where you can see the chefs preparing your food at no matter where you're sitting in the restaurant.  It is the second best open kitchen besides Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas (but that is another story for another day).  There is something awfully comforting about knowing how your food is being prepared.  That is minor though - just an added bonus. The one thing and the only thing that should ever hold you back from going to Avec is the wait.  As you already know by now, they do not take reservations and chances are you will have to wait, and waiting sucks because you're 50% starving and 50% pissed off and all you do is stand there and watch other people devour the food you came to eat.  Well at Avec, the wait can be part of the experience.  Get drinks while you wait.  And when it's not freezing outside, they set up wine barrels as tables and umbrellas so you can enjoy your drinks outside.  AND, you'll probably be sipping on an empty stomach so chances are, you will get at least somewhat tipsy, which will make the wait go a hell of a lot faster.  Don't get me wrong - I am NOT a patient person and I do NOT like wait for a meal - it's different at Avec though - just trust me.  Don't let the wait hold you back.  Basically, if you live in Chicago (or anywhere close) and you haven't gone to Avec yet, you are missing out on life.  Sure, the food isn't cheap and definitely not diet-friendly, but let me tell you what you need to do: starve yourself for a day or two so you're saving not only the money but also the calories and haul your ass to Avec.  Do yourself a favor and JUST GO.",0.997,0.749,0.177,0.074,0.49966805240614764
2009-02-24,1.0,"I went to Avec this past Saturday and I must honestly say it was a horrible experience. My boyfriend and I arrived at 8PM and we knew would have a long wait but were up for that. I told the manager(Liz?) my name, my number, and that I would have the first available opening weather it being at the bar or at a table.  Because it was so crowded in the restaurant we decided to wait in the corridor outside of the restaurant.  About 40min into our wait a younger couple walks up to the door (I told them how to get in through the ""tricky"" door since they had never been there before) and they put their name on the wait list. They decided to wait with us in the corridor. 15 minutes later Liz calls the young man and tells them they have an available table! Before me and my boyfriend who by that time were waiting for an hour!! Isn't this a first come first serve restaurant? I then decided to go in the restaurant and ask Liz how much longer our wait was. She then told me we had 18 more parties ahead of us. Not wanting to make a scene, I decided not to confront her about our obvious pass over and we left. We went to a nearby small plates restaurant (where we were seated right away) and received a phone call from Liz TWO AND A HALF hours after requesting a table. I didn't realize that Avec is a restaurant/club where the manager/bouncer gets to pick and choose who gets in and who doesn't. Liz, I don't know what your criteria is for passing me over but you should be ashamed of yourself! Is this how Chef Kahan wants his restaurant managed? If so, I will have to boycott both Avec and Blackbird. It really is ashame that this happened. I'm in the culinary business and all my fellow colleagues raved about Avec. I'm sure the food is delicious but after this incident I'm not sure if I'm willing to go to Avec or Blackbird ever again.",0.9104,0.912,0.062,0.026,0.4048206937095826
2009-02-24,5.0,"What do you do when you are having a shitty week compounded by international political/ bureaucratic drama, and a boss that looks and acts like a homeless person? Well, you say ""fuck all of you"" and go to a nice dinner/ drinks with wonderful company. That is what I did, and Avec was the right spot to get away from a shitty work week. A lovely friend and fellow yelper suggested we go to Avec. I have never been there, I heard about the bad wait times. I am not a fan of waiting, no matter how good the place is. When my dinner companion assured we will not wait for long, I jumped at it. Perfect. The interior looks like an upscale Finnish sauna. I have seen enough of them in Scandinavia to tell the upscale ones from the cheap ones. I was tempted to take my clothes off, wrap a towel, and sweat out. Don't worry, my clothes stayed on the entire time. I am well behaved in public, and company of women. You see sir, I am a gentleman, after all! We were greeted by our server Josh with two glasses of Gran Sarao Rose while waiting to be seated. Nice! The bubbly was perfect for the gloomy weather and delectable food to follow. We started with the frog legs. The combination of flavors was outstanding. Crispy fried fennel goes very well with paprika aoili, and proscuitto. Having never had frog legs before, my dinner companion was thoroughly impressed. A perfect start to a wonderful meal to follow. We moved on to the focaccia with truffle oil and herbs. It was a pure delight. I ate most of it within 2 minutes (not appropriate when you are sitting next to a lady). Josh kept refilling our wine glasses and we were enjoying our dinner and conversation. The experience till this point was 4 star. That is when we ordered the medjool dates. Stuffed with chorizo, wrapped in bacon, with a piquillo pepper-tomato sauce. Holy slut of Jesus, I just had a memory bitchslap. You know when you eat something so good that you remember past memories? No? You say I am the only weird one that has memory flashbacks when I eat amazing food? Whatever, let's get to the review at hand. I got on the bar counter, took off my pants, and asked the chef to ""take"" me right there.... on the bar counter. Fuck yeah! You deserve some kind of a sexual favor for making dates taste this good. The sweetness of a date balanced out with the smoky flavor of bacon and peppery tomato sauce. Fuck me God, right now! And give it to me gooood! Oh yeah!! No, that did not happen. Remember, I am well behaved in public and the company of women. So, I secretly wished my ""bar counter"" fantasy would come true. I didn't say a word for a good few minutes while enjoying the dates. I am sure my companion was wondering why the hell I suddenly muted myself while I have been yapping about my international healthcare drama until a minute ago. Well, I was silent because I was having my ""bar counter"" fantasy, induced by the medjool dates. I lived in the Sahara desert for 4 frickin' years. I was surrounded with all kinds of dates, yet never liked them. My mom tried to feed me that shit for lunch and dinner. Mom: here beta (beta = son, in Hindi) have some dates. They are good for you... and they are fresh from Dr. Merzouk's garden (Dr. Merzouk = my dad's colleague) Me: wtf? This shit is nasty *inside voice* Mom: It's either dates or (horse) milk, what do you want? Me: *gobbles up the dates* It took a restaurant in Chicago to make me like them. How strange is that? After having a barrage of inappropriate thoughts, I realized it is rude to stay silent with a boner in my pants. Times like these I am glad I went to Avec in my work attire, a monkey suit. In order to come back to reality I decided to take a look at the dessert menu. We ordered the vanilla crepes with kumquats. Two crepes filled with cheesy goodness surrounded by delicious kumquats. It completed our evening of extraordinary food journey. We sat by the bar counter instead of getting a table. I like communal seating, and Avec does a good job at keeping the communal seating in order. It is not an ideal date location because it is loud. As with any communal seating restaurants the vibe is casual, and everyone was well dressed. Josh did an excellent job taking care of us, my wine glass was always full. Thanks to my dinner companion for the lovely company and introducing me to Avec. I will definitely go again. And this time, my pants are coming off!!",0.998,0.749,0.178,0.073,0.6348162071846283

And there really isn't much room to wait anywhere.   My friend and I attempted to order 3 small plates and 1 large but our server informed us that we would probably be better off not ordering our third small plate as he feared that we would be too full to eat our large plate. And while I questioned it, we agreed.  We started with the chorizo dates everyone raves about. Fantastic. My friend normally isn't a fan because normally dates are too sweet for her but the chorizo was a nice compliment and gave it a nice kick. Definitely dip your bread in the sauce that accompanies the dates. We also got the frog legs. Nice delicate taste and went well w/ the small greens that it was served upon. Our large plate was the pork shoulder with beef tongue. I wasn't necessarily in love with it but my friend loved it.

2009-02-21,5.0,"I dined at avec for the first time over 3 years ago, on my second date with my now fiance, and I can't believe it's taken us this long to return! My first trip to avec was a little different, as we were there very late and had a table all to ourselves.  This time, we experienced the communal seating at the peak of dinner hour -- and I must say, at first I was a little hesitant to dine that closely with my neighbors.  But after awhile (and half a bottle of champagne) I was enjoying myself and chatting with people about the amazing food. The food.  WOW.  has got to be some of the best reasonably priced ""fine dining"" food in the city.  We had the frog's legs, polenta with spinach and reggiano, pork shoulder, and chorizo dates -- we were debating if it was too much food, and our server suggested a half order of the dates, which was one each, and turned out to be a perfect amount of food. It's hard to choose a favorite, but the pork shoulder was just amazing.  It came in this wonderfully fragrant and well-seasoned broth, topped with a spicy mustard.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  All the flavors just melded together perfectly to create an unforgettable dish.  The polenta was pretty unforgettable as well.  Three seemingly simple ingredients: polenta, spinach, parmesan - came together to make something so wonderfully delicious.  I can't get over it.  I will be thinking about this meal for a long time to come. Lastly, we had the lychee sorbet, which after all that food, was a fantastic light and sweet finish.  The two accompanying little shortbread cookies were delicious. The servers here are all so nice and helpful and not the least bit pretentious.  Even though it was packed, they didn't hurry us at all, and the meal was wonderfully paced. Although I can see how some people may not enjoy dining so close to their neighbors, the food outweighs every qualm you may have about being cozy with strangers.  Just have a drink and go with it!   I will certainly be back to avec, and it won't take three years this time!",0.9981,0.777,0.209,0.014,0.6245183982683981

Anyway, I really, really wanted to love this place.  I had heard such positive things about the food, but for me it's the entire package--the setting and experience as well as the food that's important.  So in this case, even though I loved the food (we had the shaved brussels sprout salad, which had a piquant but beautifully balanced dressing; the artichoke bruschetta, which was like a salad on toasts and very tasty; the brandade, which was hearty and satisfying--love the cod and potato combination; and the rouget--perfectly cooked), the reality of being seated at the center of the long table with two loud, obnoxious groups on either side of us ruined everything.  Partly it is an age thing, but it's also an I-dislike-dining-with-idiots thing...",0.9796,0.731,0.187,0.082,0.5983918732782371

Hanger Steak: Very tender, almost like brisket, but still pink in the middle, perfectly done.  The sauce and the touch of orange slices were a welcomed touch.  I wish I had the skill to make such a dish...   Pork shoulder with garlic sausage, & beef tongue: The pork melted in my mouth and was by far my favorite of the trio.  The sausage finished second, while the beef tongue, while good and unique took the last spot.   The veggies were soft but not mushy.

Coming with a group of 7 makes it quite difficult to nab a table. There are no reservations, and our wait was 2 hours.  Some of our group headed next door to sister resto Blackbird (on Avec's staff recommendation) to sample some cocktails... some of us decided to wait it out perched at the bar.  An odd ""rule"" -- we were intitially informed that we couldn't order food at the bar if not everyone in our party had a seat (2 of us were seated; 1 standing).  But the server came back and informed us that the boss had given his approval (perhaps taking pity with the foolish large group whose wait was increasing exponentially by the minute...). To stave off hunger we nibbled on the medjool dates before we finally were reunited with the other half of our party and were seated. A large group at Avec does have its advantages - we were able to smaple a goodly number of dishes off the menu... 1) chorizo-stuffed madjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce $9 This is apparently a constant on the menu -- I'm not a fan of dates, medjool or otherwise (and except when I'm with the husband), but the ratio of date to chorizo & bacon with a complex tomato sauce made for a some flavour-packed balls of savoury, salt, sweet and the perfect bit of spice. 2) braised chestnut and lima bean crostini with caramelized onions, frisee salad and lemon vinaigrette  $9 - 2 orders delicious and somewhat mild chestnut and lima bean puree topped with a refreshing acidy salad - again, something I would not normally order, but fairly good-tasting if not too exciting. 3) avec salad with red oak and butter lettuce, watercress, radish, belgian endive, white onion and hazelnut vinaigrette $10 Generous portion of delicate greens, lovely dressing and crisp radishes.  The bowl served all 7 of us well. 4) baked escargot with french ham, mushrooms, white wine and housemade bread $10 - 2 orders Fantastic dish of utterly tender escargot with smokey french ham and lovely whole mushrooms.  Topped with a round of toast and served with a small ciabatta loaf, we defintely were sopping up the sauces to get every last tasty bit. 5) wood-roasted chicken thigh with liver dumplings, cabbage and bacon, green apple vinaigrette $11 - 2 servings One of my favourites -- a perfect balance of savoury chicken thigh, rich liver dumpling (one could not really taste the liver), and balanced by the acid and tartness of a fantastic green apple vinaigrette. 6) curry-braised pork shoulder with roasted rutabagas, turnips, garpanzo beans and mostarda   $20.5 - 1 serving - Large Plate Perfectly cooked tender meat that must have been simmering 8 hours... a lovely winter dish. 7) wood-fired flatbread with taleggio cheese, truffle oil &amp; herbs $14 - Large Plate - 1 serving !!!! - I would not have normally ordered flatbread but it was crisp-fabulous, oozingly-fantastic and oh so wonderfully truffly.  I sat and sniffed and inhaled before scarfing my portion down. We ordered 2 more dishes: ""a quercia"" prosciutto with marinated ruby red grapefruit, cucumber, mint, red onion and gin vinaigrette  $20.5 -Large Plate -and a special of grilled rapini $8 which I unfortunately did not get to taste. :( Our bill came out to a very reasonable $30 for 7 of us. Fantastic pricing considering the quality of the food.  Definitely worth the wait, but perhaps we'll try a party fo 4 next time instead of bombing the place with 6 or 7...",0.9982,0.803,0.161,0.035,0.5297955747955746
2009-01-23,3.0,"I love Top Chef so of course I had to try Top Chef Stephanie's favorite restaurant in Chicago. Upon arrival, it took us a second to locate the entrance. It is deceivingly located in a small hallway, as if you're entering the adjacent building.  Upon entering, my first impression was madness! There is no waiting area and they don't take reservations so as you can imagine, it was incredibly hectic near the front door. The wait was surprisingly (and probably unusually) short, but they were sweet enough to serve us drinks even though we were crammed in a small corner. The tables are large benches and our party of four was placed in the middle. This made it very inconvenient for the party of two at the end of our table. I guess with a table set-up like that, its expected that someone will be inconvenienced.  The uncomfortable seating and crammed waiting area is excused as soon as the food arrives. It is tapas-style small plates and due to all the positive reviews, we had to start with the chorizo-stuffed dates. Yelpers never fail and it was our favorite dish by far. We also ordered the special pheasant sausage with fingerling potatoes, the chestnut crostini and the braised octopus. We cleaned off each plate down to the crumbs. The wine list was long and they provide small decanter sizes rather than glasses so you get a little more than a glass for the same price. For dessert, we shared a ricotta crepe with kumquats and pistachios. After tasting, we wished we had skipped it. The weak ending aside, I can see why this can be a favorite and I plan to return for more.",0.9862,0.799,0.155,0.046,0.5240764790764791

Menu isn't huge but the variety is good. We got the foccacia bread which was good but super rich - it was so filling that the three of us couldn't finish it. Definitely recommend the chorizo bacon wrapped dates - delicious and spicy! We had the snapper special which came out whole - very tasty but kind of a haze to pick through ALL the bones. We also had the pork shoulder which was delicious and a large portion - definitely could be shared. We had two bottles of wine - both were great, they have a good wine selection. From an atmosphere perspective, I could see what they were going for but it didn't do it for me. It was too bright and I felt like I was in a sauna (because of the walls, not the temperature). Also we were right by the window and I know they can't do anything about it in the Chicago winter but it was COLD where we were sitting. Also, there is nowhere to really stand for the people who are waiting for a table - so they ended up standing right by our table.

2009-01-21,4.0,"Hands down our favorite restaurant from Chicago.  Through our connections, we were able to be seated with relatively little wait time at the counter in this intimate, ash-blonde/steele/glass establishment. The maitre-d'/sommelier(?) took our coats, suggested vino prior to our seating and we had a great time people watching from a corner. The tempo was fast yet casual and fun, and the food that was presented at each table made every minute of waiting become exponentially more tortuous than the last.  When we sat down, we peered into the menu and had a really difficult time deciding. The flatbread looked fantastic on the table, but at 12 inches in diameter, we thought it would be a little too much flatbread for the 2 of us, especially since we wanted to order as much as possible. We ended up with: - Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo (delicious) - Braised octopus with spinach (so unexpectedly sea brine-savory and tender, we could cut the octopus with our forks) - Braised beef hearts with beans (THE BEST dish of the night) - Oven roasted whole porgy with tarragon, walnuts, olives and parsley (the flesh was tender, skin crispy and perfectly seasoned--I never knew porgy could taste so good, we even ate the cheeks and eyeballs out of the fish) Avec is excellent in every way except when it comes to billing. Apparently, our server added an additional $20 on top of our bill either on purpose or by accident. Either way, that sucked because we were using a gift card and I didn't notice the deduction until the day after when I checked the balance.

2009-01-14,4.0,"Avec is a great small restaurant located next door to Blackbird. Both  are owned and operated by Paul Kahan. I like each for different reasons. Avec is great if you need to grab dinner before a show. They open at 3 PM. Also they do a selection of small plates, so it's not a ton of food before you sit in a theater for 3 hours. The style of food is healthy French; lots if flavor minus the butter and cream. Their wine selection is exotic; little known labels at a great price. I've been several times and the food/service was always good. They always have a whole grilled fish on the menu. It changes and rotates constantly. Unfortunately, the last time we had their signature dish, it was a bit overcooked and overpriced. It was small at 24 oz's for $40. The only drawback is this restaurant is not romantic. The atmosphere is stark and utilitarian. It gets very crowed and fills up fast. Noise is a factor.

That beer list, though: it was full of intriguing brews, mostly Belgians, I'd never seen or heard of.  Not being a Belgian fan, I dove into the wines instead - and I'd love to tell you which ones we sampled, but I don't recollect at all.  They were all (a little too, perhaps) delicious - an outstanding selection. The atmosphere is noisy and fun, and the all-wood interior and close quarters make for a cozy visit.  Just what we were looking for. For our meal, we shared what seemed like one of everything on the menu - as a vegetarian, I was a little more limited, but once I tried the focaccia I never wanted to eat anything else again, anyway.  Oh, yum.  The Avec salad was delicious, too, and the chestnut & lima bean crostini, while not my favorite part of the meal, was tasty as well.  Looking forward to our next trip to Chicago!",0.9942,0.761,0.21,0.029,0.5812111801242236

2008-12-28,5.0,"Avec is my first really good food experience in Chicago. The restaurant has a no reservations policy and offers bar seating which is perfect for dining alone. I love the location of the restaurant because it feels non-touristy which is a refreshing departure from my River North  residency (plus parking is easy to find). Blackbird is right next door. The restaurant is owned by the same partners.  Fortunately, there was a seat available at the bar. My first impression was mixed. The dining room is essentially one long ""hallway"" with two parallel rows: the bar and a row of tables. The bar area is covered in a stainless steel kitchen surface. The tables have a harsh fluorescent lighting. Not my fave, especially since it gives the wood decor a cold feeling. So instead of having a warm natural feel, avec has a clinical vibe to it.  It didn't matter too much because the joint was humming with energy supplied by the constant exchange of dialogue. It's that patented social white noise that let's you know people are having fun.  The menu is succinct which is usually a sign that most of the menu items are strong. I knew right away what I wanted: Baked Escargot with white wine, pancetta, and herbs followed by Bucatini with housemade italian sausage, veal, tomato, fresh herbs and reggiano. Yum Yum!  The escargot were perfectly cooked. This dish is excellent; not drowned in butter. The flavors were balanced and I could taste each ingredient. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough bread to mop up all the deelish sauce. I would warn those who are timid to avoid this dish because the snails are not disguised (they shouldn't be anyway).  The bucatini was to die for. Perfectly al dente and napped with just the right amount of stewed tomato sauce. This is why pasta is sexy to eat. The veal flavor is bold. Just a proper bowl of f--king good pasta. There were several items that I wanted to sample, but I didn't have the appetite.  Avec is as ""recession-friendly"" as a restaurant of its caliber can get. My two courses set me back $26. And two people with mild appetites could have shared what I ordered. I am less price sensitive when it comes to dining out so I had to have some vino with dinner. Avec offers several wines by the glass ranging between $11-$15 for most. My server was awesome. She recommended two good wines that paired very nicely. She also gave me a starter list of ""must try"" Chicago eateries! So excited! Finally, avec is great for bringing friends or a casual first date.

2008-11-23,5.0,"I was lucky to join a newbie to Avec tonight. Although only being here once, I thought I had a good handle on the place. Perhaps I thought wrong. The food is still outstanding and is always fun to share and enjoy with a wonderful friend or even a small group. Penny and I got to sit at the bar, this time. The menu changes slightly for each season. Some dishes get modified, some get changed completely and others remain their tried and true selves. We were able to sample some of each tonight and of course what we had left smiles and happy faves on each of our faces. Starting with a glass of wine from their large and simply jaw dropping wine list, we descended on to the menu. What to get... what to get...  we went in on two different rounds and 6 different plates. We went in our first round the chorizo stuffed, bacon wrapped dates, really a must when ever you come here. 4 of these bad boys placed in a roasted red pepper sauce. Amazing stuff. Feel free to take the crusty bread and get lusty with the sauce. I mean that's what it is there for. Then we move on to the prosciutto, pear and manchego cheese. Light with a hint of citrus from lemons, smokiness from the prosciutto, blended well with the sweetness of the pear and the richness of the olive oil and cheese. As well as the deluxe focaccia with taleggio cheese, truffle oil and fresh herbs. Think of it like this. Crispy warm flat bread that nestles and cradles soft warm cheese that just melts in your mouth. It explodes with the richness of the truffle oil and sings harmonic praises of heaven with the herbs. This is my kind of carb loading.  Our second round we went with the special of rapini sauteed in olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes and a little lemon. The bitterness of the rapini comes toward the middle to the end of the mouthful, as Penny put it, kinda like horseradish, but the olive oil and garlic make the presence known in the beginning. Savor the mouthful. We did since we got one of the last plates of it. Then we got the Avec salad. Butter and red oak lettuce cradles the creamy avocados and roasted tomato dressing, along with red onions and radishes. If you threw some chicken or seared tuna on there I'd be eating that every day. We got a little adventurous and went with the duck dish they had that day. It was a little rich, but certainly our glasses of wine helped to cut through. Slice of warm toasty baguette with a little olive oil, then spooning cool pulled duck, seasoned and filled with the rich duck fat. Certainly this is not an every day dish, but one to savor and experience once in a while.  There is the bar and three long tables and that is it, its communal seating. You might be sitting next to a couple from out of town or just down the street. They may have come from the theatre or from the Bears game. If you want privacy, don't expect it here.  You should just go, grab a good friend, enjoy the very friendly and on top of their game servers and staff, savor the food and enjoy a great glass of wine.

2008-11-05,5.0,"one of my favorite restaurants evar. i checked this place out after hearing it mentioned on top chef chicago and was not disappointed. setting: avec looks like a giant sauna, which is kind of weird, but i dig the casual atmosphere and west loop location.  you can either sit at the bar or at one of the picnic-ish tables, but either way you'll probably be sharing some space with some other peoples.  i definitely would recommend the ""worst"" seats in the house which are the two barstools in the back of the restaurant.  they also happen to be right in front of the kitchen where you can check out the chefs working their magic and chat them up for some suggestions/samples. service: very friendly but not always attentive. the place is usually full and there are only a handful of servers so don't expect tons of attention. price: definitely a great value for what you get. 2 people can share 3 or 4 dishes plus dessert and a couple drinks for $100 including tip.  leave out the dessert and drinks and 2 can easily eat for $60 or less. FOOD: everything i've had has been awesome, but the stuffed dates, salmon tartare, and half chicken are especially good.  definitely get at least 3 or 4 things to share and maybe an order of dates for yourself.  the wine list is pretty impressive and they also have some interesting beers that pair well with the food.   bonus: the kitchen is open late on weekends so head on over if you want some fancy drunk food.",0.9974,0.723,0.258,0.019,0.7123139880952382

The visit started out fine, it was a rainy cold night, but of course, there was still a wait.  We got to order a bottle of wine while waiting though, and that was nice. The three of us finally got sat.  I would definitely suggest going in even numbers so no one has to be stuck sitting at the head of the table with extra knee bumps that no one needs.   And our service was terrible from start to finish.  A couple was sat next to us at the same time, and this is how things started: Server:  I know you aren't all together, but I'd like to give you the specials, blah blah blah.  *Turns to dude next to us*  Would you like something to drink? Dude next to us:  Blah blah orders a drink for him and his date (in Italian accent) Server:  Ignores us and turns away to go to bar Me:  Excuse me (we were ready to order)....trailing off... Dude next to us:  Oh, she'll be back. Me (in my head):  Well DUH!!! I hope she'll be back moron!!!   And that's basically how things went for us the rest of the night with our server, the dude next to us, and my party. It was nice to see Koren running food out, and I think I may have to give it another try.  Prices were very reasonable, and we absolutely loved the brandade!  I would skip dessert though.",0.9163,0.757,0.135,0.109,0.4251923076923076

2008-10-14,5.0,"My GF and i had some flight vouchers with Southwest and decided to go to Chicago to visit a friend of hers who moved there recently. We decided we wanted to take her some place nice for letting us stay at her place and showing us around all weekend.  I was hoping to make it to Alinea, but i was too slow trying to get a reservation, so that will have to wait for a future trip. She'd already been to the famous Frontera Grill, so that was off the list too. We decided something mellow and laid back would be good, and i remember Tony Bourdain mentioning Avec in one of his books as one of his favorite places in Chicago that had great food, but none of the other crap you have to deal with at fine dining restaurants.  They don't do reservations. We showed up around 8pm on a saturday night (probably not the best idea) and ended up having to wait just over an hour for a table. The place is very small, modern architecture, with obvious Japanese influences (geometric shapes, simple design, light wood, communal seating, etc) in the design of the restaurant, not the food. The food is mostly french, spanish, italian inspired small plates.  So here's what we got: House Marinated Olives - even though these were just olives, they we ridiculously good. Really soft with lots of meat. Really delicious.  Avec Salad - Really nice. Nothing too flashy or exciting, just a really nice, delicious, perfectly dressed salad.  Pot Roast - This was done kind of vietnamese style with carrots and cilantro. It was really good and a twist on a traditionally delicious but kind of ho-hum dish that screams 1950's suzy home maker. This was certainly unlike most pot roast dishes.  Focaccia - Basically two super thin pizza crusts sandwiched together with taleggio cheese, truffle oil, and herbs. Again, very simple, and oh so delicious.  Chorizo Stuffed Dates Wrapped in Smoked Bacon and Served in Piquillo Pepper Tomato Sauce - This was easily the star of the show. These little nuggets of joy had me about to pee in my pants. The heat of the sauce and the charizo, the smokiness of the bacon, the sweetness of the date, all wrapped into a little nugget of modest, no frills, mind blowing deliciousness. No super trendy and expensive gimmicky ingredients like foie gras, wagyu beef or truffles, just wonderful.  Most dishes we ordered came with home made bread that was great. The servers were tattooed and casual enough to not be stuffy, but not obnoxiously alternative. Our waitress was just about perfect, we tipped very well.  Not only was the food and the service fantastic, but for three people (granted, we didn't order wine), we all left stuffed, and the total before tip was under $60.

There was a long wait for this restaurant that seats only about 50 people but with good company it went by quickly. It was well worth it because we got seated at the ""chef's counter"", the best seats in the house if you appreciate cooking.  We sat right in front of the chef! What a treat that was. We saw him cook all the dishes. Everything was so freshly made. He was so busy but very in control of the kitchen.  Tapas we ordered were: 1. Butter lettuce with red onions, red beets in cream garlic dressing - we ordered this because we needed to eat some ruffage. 2. The infamous chorizo-stuffed madjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce - this was quite a unique dish. The sweetness of the dates with the saltiness of chorizo sausage and bacon in a sauce with a kick. 3. Beef pot roast with onions, carrots on a bed of cumin and other spices carrot puree , topped with carrot salad - delicious. This was our favorite! 4. slow roasted crispy duck leg with marinated plums, tarragon, grilled onion and savory streusel - our least favorite. The duck was dry. 5. cheese platter - we forgot what the three cheeses were but they were all hard cheeses. All very delicious. We got the quince paste, marcona almonds, orange and date compote complimentary since they gave it to us by mistake.  We had our fill of the warm whole wheat ciabatta that accompanied our meal.  The fish looked awesome but it was too big for the 2 of us to eat, maybe next time. We had no room for dessert.

Avec is a notch above all of them.  Don't get me wrong, Avec is pricier than all of them, but they have extraordinarily different tapas plates.  I won't go into it all, just check out their online menue. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the busboys are too exuberant, taking away our  wine glasses while we still had wine in the bottle and constantly trying to remove dishes with food still on them. Not that big a deal but we had an episode when one lady in our party poured the remaining wine in her empty water glass and then the busboy started to pour water in that glass.

2008-10-08,5.0,"Easily my favorite restaurant in Chicago, Avec strikes a perfect balance between refined modernism and plebian communalism--a ""diner"" for the 21st century. The food is inspired by traditional Mediterranean cuisine but departs to uniquely modern taste combinations. Dishes are usually served in the cookware they were cooked in, from a cast-iron pot of pasta to a wood-fired pizza served on its wooden slab. The menu is divided into large dishes and small dishes--prime dining for a group of friends, or else a good way to make friends with the people around you. One large plate generally serves one person and two or three small plates make for one serving, although all dishes seem destined to be shared. The design of the restaurant itself forces such communalism, with minimalist tables and chairs crammed together side-by-side in the already cramped dining room. Even the diner's relationship to the cooking staff is communal, as the ranges and wood-fire ovens stand open in the corner of the room. I'm usually averse to claustrophobic spaces but something about Avec makes it feel like a room full of friends, loud and close. The outstanding food certainly doesn't hurt in easing me into such amiability. The best advice I can offer to someone going to Avec is: the larger the party the more dishes to try, so bring the gang or elbow up to some new friends whose dishes you can dip your fork into.",0.995,0.779,0.207,0.014,0.518819143819144

I know there's been much discussion about the communal seating.  People, get out and be social.  Alot of us are stuck at computers all day and have no real interactions with actual people, so take advantage of this opportunity.  Both my visits to Avec were enhanced by my table-neighbors.  My first visit with my boy, we sat next to a group of four who seemed to be regulars, and they recognized us as newbies (while we were drooling over their food) and gave us some really good recommendations.  The couple on the other side of us were hysterical, and we had a great time both talking with them and observing them for entertainment (and I think they felt the same way about us, by the way).  My second visit, my wine expert brother helped our neighbors pick out a bottle of wine, and they were really grateful (unfortunately, it was the last bottle of the same wine we were drinking, so when we winos were trying to order another bottle, we had to switch to something else, which was actually great because I got to try a new wine).  Anyway, talk to your neighbors.  It's fun. Both my visits were on weeknights, and I didn't have to wait for a table either time. Miraculously, I did not check out the bathroom on either visit.  I think I was worried that if I stepped away from the table I might miss out on a scrumptious bite of food.  Maybe I was also thinking that if I didn't visit the bathroom, that would mean I'd have to come back.   I will definitely be back!  And you should go too.  But only if you're friendly, or at least entertaining.",0.9972,0.802,0.17,0.028,0.39361346018322757

The dates serve as a sweet balance to chorizo and bacon (seriously. chorizo and bacon? and there's a chance it wouldn't be good?) The focaccia lacks all the icky things about focaccia (too oily, too much rosemary) and instead is perfectly crispy like a heavenly grilled cheese sandwich with the essence of truffle. LOVE it. The salumi platter was also quite nice. If we'd stopped there I would have thought Avec was really good. But we didn't.

The salmon was cured really well and altogether a nice dish, though perhaps one or two many flavors happening. Next was the ""focaccia"" with taleggio cheese, truffle, and fennel. This was by no means an authentic focaccia, but rather just a delicious, wood-oven baked flatbread loaded with flavor. The taleggio was very mild (in fact I would not have known it was taleggio except for the menu), but not in a bad way, and the truffle was perfectly proportioned (tastable, but not overwhelming like truffle often is). Little hints of fennel were just perfect. We capped it off with a cheese plate. They have a small but nice selection, and give you a reasonable portion along with another loaf of bread, and a salad of grape, citrus juice, and those wonderful Spanish soft almonds. This was enough food to easily satisfy two people, so no dessert. This meal, along with two beers, tax, and tip came to around $70 (a great deal for food this good). My only complaint was the beer list, which certainly had some interesting choices (and a good portion of 750 ml bottles) but lacked such basics as a good IPA or classic Belgian.",0.9952,0.774,0.19,0.035,0.5990990990990992

There was a bit of a row with the hostess, who seems overworked and I'll just leave it at that, but that part worked out in the end, more or less.  Inside the service was great, although really after standing for so long, a chair with more than 4 inches of back would have been nice :|.

So we pay the check and start to walk inside to meet up with the hostess who had (already) said they were ready to seat us...well lo and behold she acts like she never said she was ready to seat us.

Ok, I'll have the pizza--the one with the apples and pork. ""Do you mind holding the pork?"" No subs. Ahhh shit.. Ok. Um...taleggio focaccia (which is to die for)  but would be SOOOO much better with a little salad to cut the fat and truffles.

""oh..I thought you wanted that as a second course."" Um..no that's why we ordered the olives and brandade to start.  So, 1.5 hours later we're still waiting for the remaining items of the order.  It was all too much for a Sunday night. I had to leave.

2008-05-26,5.0,"The better half, his maternal unit and I independently asked friends for dining options during our evening in Chicago. When comparing our findings, the one common recommendation across all three was Avec. As we approached Avec, it felt like a cold, contemporary, urban hot spot that thinks it's better than you with it's minimalist wood planked walls and ceilings, back-lit feature wall made up of empty red and white wine bottles and architecturally-restrained communal tables and low-backed seats. However, once you're plopped amongst strangers who have to get up to provide you access to your seat in the middle of said communal table, you begin to realize that you're in for an intimate, chummy one-of-a-kind dining experience. Up until last Wednesday, I thought I knew what ""communal dining"" was - boy, did I need to be learned!! Initially, I was disoriented about how close we were to unfamiliar diners on all four sides! After settling into the menu and a nice bottle of wine (a Periquita - which I remember to be a smooth, tasty Spanish red), which our waitress cheerily and adeptly recommended, I acclimated to the idea of eating out of a complete stranger's lap! We were advised to order either two small plates or one large plate per person - we picked two and two (which was just right): + Gnocchi with ramp-arugula pesto + confit shrimp - W! O! W! This ranks as one of the Top Five Dishes I've ever had in my life! This made me forget about being cramped and annoyed I could barely hear my companions. For 10 minutes, it was ALL about my tongue making love to this gnocchi. (I know: EHWWWWWW!) + Chorizo-stuffed dates wrapped in smoked bacon - This was identified as one of Avec's ""signature"" items and it certainly earns the props! The chorizo-date was tender like a meatball, trying to be held together by bacon all coated in a tomato sauce with a bit of a kick. + ""Deluxe"" focaccia with tageggio cheese + truffle oil - Another winner! Maybe a bit too big for three, but we certainly weren't complaining. Anything that's baked and drizzled with truffle oil is A-OK in my book. The focaccia is sliced thin, crispy and almost sandwich-like (with the gooey goodness in the middle). + Marinated hangar steak with asparagus - My least fave of the four dinner plates. This dish certainly didn't suck, but when compared to ungodly greatness, something was bound to fall a bit short. Despite the crowd, I think this is a great place for a date night and special occasions. Be patient when waiting for seats because the food is most certainly worth your time.

The wine has always been excellent here and we always trust the waiter's picks.  Our waiter did a good job on the wine selection but our service got worse once the place got more crowded.   What struck me as odd, was it was very hard to get his attention (not hard to imagine in this tiny loud place) BUT we were trying to leave for 30 minutes while 15-20 people are standing waiting for our seats.

But if you're not the patient type, subtract at least 1 star. When we were finally seated, we found ourselves sitting shoulder to shoulder at a table that really shouldn't seat 4 on the wall (bench seating) and 4 wooden blocks facing the wall. Given the close proximity you can't help not to eavesdrop on your neighbors and if you happen to sit next to obnoxious/lame people, subtract another star. On to the food. I know the chorizo-stuffed dates come highly recommended but I did not find it all that special. But that's more than made up by the duck sausage, the cod and the spaghetti w/ mussels. The whole experience took 1.5 hours but I never felt like the service was slow. The booze helped. They have a very surprisingly inexpensive wine list.",0.8328,0.881,0.081,0.038,0.46174603174603174

I asked around and it seemed like this is more a place for younger adults to hang out but I decided to try it anyways. I was there around 4 to avoid the crowds as they do not take any reservations but it started to be more crowded around 5.30pm. The decor is sophisticated and modern and they have long tables and bar-style seatings to encourage strangers to talk to each other.  The food was excellent. They have a good selection of small and large plates; so if it's your first time there, you might need some time to decide what to order. My favorite of the night was the stuffed dates and pork shoulder. After chatting with the person next to me, I even got her to try the dates because she was curious about what I was eating.

2008-05-01,4.0,"This place would definitely get five stars if it weren't for two huge design flaws: Design flaw #1- the lighting. Remember the Seinfeld episode when Jerry was dating ""bad lighting girl"", who could look drop dead gorgeous or horrifying depending on what kind of light she was in? Well, Avec has the kind that makes everyone look at least worse than they would outside....if not, well, horrifying. See, it's like fluorescent/ cubicle lighting....which is bad if you're trying to set the mood or just not get a headache.  Go during the day to get the best the sun has to offer- after dark it's kind of creepy. Design flaw #2- the chair/block/seat thingy is not in proportion to the table. It never fails- completely sober and about ready to enjoy my wine- that I hit my hand against the table and spill in my lap and then look like I pissed myself for the entire meal. Now, I'd totally assume it was just me (depth perception issue, learning disorder, spaziness) if I hadn't also seen it happen to others. Get an architect/ designer/ furniture-maker in there stat and, while you're at it, put some backs on the chair. I want to eat and get fat- not work my core.  Aside from those issues, this place is great. The food is amazing, interesting, perfectly portioned, and the beer and wine selections are great. I'm not one for hard liquor, so I don't mind that they don't serve cocktails. Their cured meats are amazing, and just about any meat dish you get is going to rock your world.",0.9568,0.718,0.17,0.112,0.6783333333333333
2008-04-28,5.0,"This just might be my new favorite Chicago restaurant. It's been on my must-try list for way too long, and it fulfilled all my expectations and more.  The wait was almost intolerable (but we were partially to blame, just showed up around 8 pm on a weekend evening. Honestly, we were kind of asking for it) but nothing a good bottle of red can't cure. The bartender was super knowledgeable about picking something based on my vague preferences, and the hour pretty much flew by.  I really love the way this restaurant wraps you in wood - everything from the floor, walls, ceiling, to even the long benches and stools, is in warm wood tones, except for one wall crafted entirely of beautifully lit glass bottles. This makes communal dining and even the stark lighting a little friendlier.  When we finally settled into our seats, we wanted food, and wanted it quick. After a once-over of the menu, we ordered a half dozen plates. They arrived pretty fast, in no particular order, and were all phenomenal. The cauliflower-garlic crostini had a great interplay of textures, the gnocchi with mustard greens was delish, the cod and chicken thigh were cooked perfectly, the taleggio and herb stuffed foccacia was addictive, and even the olives seemed better than usual. Amazing dining experience. With only a month and a half left in Chicago, and too many more places to visit, I'm not sure we'll make it back, but this one goes down in the best-of records.",0.9944,0.764,0.196,0.04,0.580869672333087

The 2 of us had 3 small plates and 2 large plates (probably a little too much food. 3 smaill plates and 1 large would have filled us up). We had the cod, the dates, duck sausage, focaccia, and pork shoulder. The food was amazing. Everything was full of flavor and the prices very reasonable. Portion sizes for many tapas places in San Fran are much smaller than the portion sizes at Avec. We also had  250 ml of wine for 14 bucks.

The food is delicious; most noteworthy dishes include the salmon, as well as the citrus salad.   4. If your date sucks--you can talk to the people sitting next to you.

We started off with the focaccia and stuffed dates, and both these dishes were extremely delicate and delicious. The focaccia was fresh and crispy and the cheese unique and thick. The stuffed dates were sweet with flavors of the dates, but also savory with the chorizo. Extremely succulent. Then we moved on to the crispy chicken thigh (which we found on the top 100 dishes of 2007 from Time Out Magazine), and the cod. Both dishes were good, but didn't stand out as much as the appetizers. The pork shoulder however was extremely juicy and soft. The juices and fruits also enhanced the flavors and I just couldn't help but finish everything. The small space, cute wooden decor and various well-dressed people made the place cozy yet chic. The prices matched well with the quality, and despite the smaller portions, I was extremely satisfied and full at the end of the meal. My only complaint is the wait. Luckily we arrived at 5:30 (when Avec opens). But if we had arrived 10 minutes later, we would definitely have had to wait for a table, and by the time we left, the line was almost out the door.

2008-01-08,5.0,"I almost don't want to review Avec - simply because it is already too crowded.  But, Avec so deserves it! The thing I love most about Avec is the communal seating.  I love the feeling I get right when I walk inside the door, I feel as though I am in a cozy lodge filled with friends.  I love snuggling up next to the ""out of town"" stranger or the ""in from the 'burbs visiting our kids and had to try this place"" stranger or the ""we come here every week"" stranger.  I just love most of the people who dine there so I like the communal feel.  And I go there when I am in the mood for that warm camaraderie. The second best thing about Avec is the food.  Koren's food is hearty and delicious, but much like her tattoos, her food is also very original.  The Brandade is a must- have dish that I eat each time I visit.  I love the lamb sausage pizza.  Their pasta is always ""al dente"" (or however you spell it) but it is perfectly cooked so that the pasta is still firm to the taste, as it should be. The next thing I love, is the wine list.  Good, inexpensive wines and a staff that knows what they're talking about.  The staff (particularly Sontra, or as I like to call her the Evil Fairy) knows what they are talking about, the management takes the time to educate their staff on the products they sell and bravo for that. Other things I love...  - The fact that they use Molten and Brown as their hand soap in the bathrooms and my hands are always lemony-fresh.  - The fact that they serve a glass of cognac with an espresso back.  - The best seat in the house - the last two seats at the counter, right in front of the chefs.  You can talk to them the whole time and when you say, ""hey, what's that in your pan?""  They give you a little taste.  - The fact that they play album sides or even whole Cd's.   And of course, how can one forget, the fact that they have  A COAT CHECK.  The lovely man or woman at the door greets you and says, ""may I take your coat"".  And you hand it to him/her and he/she takes it downstairs.  For all I know, they throw the coat in a pile of horse poo - but they offer the courtesy to their guests.  Or at the very least, hooks on the walls, so when you're piled in on top of each other, there is a place for you to put your coat.",0.9975,0.802,0.181,0.018,0.49667293233082704

I don't know where and how they cook their bread but it's amazing. The staff is quirky and helpful - I like to have them pick out cheese for me sometimes as I get stuck in a rut and tend to stick with the same ones.  You can't go with the expectation of getting seated right away - I agree that the no reservations approach can be frustrating but at least you don't have to wait forever to get a reservation. I think with the communal seating, you can choose to engage in conversation with the people next to you or not - I don't think you are forced to.  Being able to come in at 11 pm for dinner is great if you decide last minute that you are starving and want to stop by after a cocktail party or something. They have a tendency to play whole albums vs. multiple songs which makes the vibe great - one night I heard the sex pistols - nice and different. You also don't walk away spending a ridiculous amount of money on dinner - you share the dishes, the wine pricing range is diverse and you don't walk out hungry.",0.9833,0.709,0.2,0.092,0.5452726017943409

2008-01-03,1.0,"avec is a good-looking restaurant, filled with good-looking customers and a good looking menu and wine list. How unfortunate that such looks can be deceiving.  Having read such good reviews about avec we were very disappointed with the pedestrian menu, a bland wine list and questionable service. Communal seating at avec is as irritating as anywhere else that suffers from this late 90's attempt at edginess, as is the ""we're too cool to take bookings"" approach to dining - especially annoying when  you are seated after five people who had arrived after us but apparently knew the hostess. The 'sommelier' recommended a wine that for $50 all three of us agreed was frankly ordinary. The food at avec is an unexciting, pretentious attempt at modern American cuisine afflicted with the trendy affectation toward 'small and large plates' designed for oh-so-cool sharing. Said menu contains such culinary masterpieces as cheese foccacia, a bowl of olives, a third of a tasteless sausage in a bitter broth, a flavourless salad, a chicken thigh, a brandade and a pizza. Attempts at further trendiness include the existence of a ham slicing machine on the bar (?!) and the pulsating sound system of an Abercrombie and Fitch. The nicely designed and appointed bathrooms replete with excellent Molton Brown products were marred by the floor being strewn with wet paper towels.

2007-11-29,3.0,"Went here the other night with friends. The ""eh"" factors first: much has been made of the sauna appearance, but I was more put off by the seating - big hollow wooden blocks. Mine was tippy, and we were at the bar, so it wasn't terribly comfortable. The prices are pervasive, but it's apparent the quality of the ingredients dictate this. It's essentially a wooden shoebox and the decor is minimal, if qualifying as existent. But you know...I didn't come for pretty pictures, so it didn't much matter. That aside, we were handled by Clarence, who knows his stuff without appearing terribly sniffy. I enjoyed his wine descriptions and he chose some very good cheeses for us. We started with a bottle of Cerasuolo di Vittoria (2004), which was the perfect accompaniment to our food. Our first plate was the chorizo-stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates and that was my favorite. Sometimes stronger flavors compete in a bad way, but this REALLY worked. Next we got the focaccia with taleggio cheese, which I thought was bland; the cheese was too mild for my taste. Next was the brisket with fingerling potatoes, which was so, so tender - no knife needed. VERY tasty. We finished the evening with a cheese plate, but I'm not sure which one. It was all very tasty, and I liked the marinated grapes as well as the apricot and cranberry chutney served alongside.  For some reason, their quince paste (of all things) was DIVINE. It was mellow and honeyed and it reminded me of when I was little, living in Iowa and playing outside in a huge park just after sunset - the smell of the clover, the wildflowers...I could close my eyes and I was very nearly 5 again.

The atmosphere was very---austere.  I didn't exactly dislike it, but it could've used a few orchids or something.  It really does look like a sauna.  The back wall of green wine bottles is really cool.  Don't go for privacy, as the seats on the long communal table are closely spaced.  We sat at the bar, which was fine, and though the seats really weren't that comfortable, they also were better than they looked.  In Rainbows was playing (it was right after it was released) and they played the album's best song, Reckoner, twice in a row, which amused me.  Gail from Top Chef was eating there with friends, which also amused me.",0.9961,0.722,0.259,0.02,0.5200264550264551

I definitely recommend the chorizo stuffed dates-best ever, besides that, the rest of the food was average tapas. Not very many vegetarian options-so if you want good veggie chow, don't come here.

The atmosphere.  It is decorated like a sauna with communal seating and awful flourescent lighting.  I hate being packed into communal tables with strangers (and I mean packed in tight).  This sucks when on a date and with large groups expect to wait outside in their cafe for hours while small groups get squeezed in ahead of you (they don't take reservations).  Should I hold it against them that they are popular?  Probably not.   But I would rather they jack up the prices so they can take reservations and spread the seating out.  This would make my experience pleasant and let me give them the 5 stars that they deserve.",0.9374,0.746,0.168,0.086,0.6191416040100253

All in all we were out of there with the shortest tab I've had all week at $90 for 3 people; however, our alcohol consisted of merely the small amount of cognac this time and the present company did not like cheese.  Match the rest of the meal with those two old friends and of course the bill shall rise.  Overall I'd describe it as a step above some of the Tapas bars and a good experience.",0.9431,0.88,0.089,0.031,0.3839105339105339

I hear he gets his own hog and cures his own meats, which adds a nice little novelty to the chacuterie choices.  Our food was very good, though maybe because of my expectations I can't say that I was totally wowed.  The ingredients were all very high quality and I particularly liked the duck and seasonal apple salad...solid, but understated. Last pet peeve I'll mention is the lights.  In general, I think the communal tables, scandanavian-mod wood paneling/tables/chairs, and warmth from the fire make for a generally inviting version of modernism.  However, the lights tend to remind me of the hospital.  Minor thing, but details count.",0.9402,0.852,0.124,0.024,0.5738042328042328

As individuals, we all place value on each of these relative to the weight we give them.

Avec is an exception for me. Atmosphere first, food second, and well, company really doesn't matter because if you get lucky, you'll be sitting next to some of the most interesting people you could ever ask to meet in a Chicago restaurant.
