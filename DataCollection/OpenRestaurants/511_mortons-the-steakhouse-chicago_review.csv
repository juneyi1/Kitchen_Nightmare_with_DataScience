Me and a few girlfriends decided to give this place a try on a rainy Tuesday night during Chicago Restaurant Week. Upon entrance we were greeted by a nice hostess... an older guy who sat us right away. We liked the dim light settings.. gave us a romantic feel. Our server whose name was Josh or Sean or something like that was extremely rude and inpatient. He offered us the wine menu , when we declined it seemed that his attitude immediately clicked in. ( we don't drink so I was wondering what's the problem) Being that this was my first experience here I had numerous questions about the dishes. First of all customer service is key. Maybe the server Sean was having a bad night because he was sarcastic, rude, monotone and maybe even prejudice... being that we were the only blacks in the establishment at the time. He made it clear that he had a problem!! He was very bubbly , helpful and enthusiastic to all the other tables in close proximity .. but to 3 young black classy women extremely rude. The food here was just okay. My friend's decided to order the Shrimp Alexander which was so bland, the breading was soggy as if it had been sitting in a warmer and the mashed potatoes were blah..overall they were disappointed . I ordered the filet which was seasoned well and actually tasty. But customer service is Key so overall I didn't enjoy my experience. At top notch prices I expect exceptional service... the kind I always get at Ruth's Chris and The Capital Grille. I think I will stick to my usual spots..",0.7878,0.79,0.122,0.088,0.5777685492801772

Unfortunately, the steak just didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for. The au gratin potatoes were okay, and the grilled asparagus was good but I would recommend getting the balsamic just drizzled on there. Our asparagus was dominated by too much balsamic.

We had to shout to hear each other, but that is not why I gave a one star review.  I ordered a Manhattan ""up"" which is served in a martini glass. We received our drinks and after taking a couple sips from mine, I noticed that there was a crack in the martini glass and a small chip out of the rim. No problem. I let the waiter know and he took the glass without saying anything, walked over to a manager, and they looked at the glass and discussed it for several minutes. About 10 minutes later the waiter came by the table, plunked down a METAL martini glass, said almost under his breath, ""this one won't break"" and moved off before I could respond.  Yes, they brought me a drink in a stainless steel martini glass!  As if I could not be trusted with their glassware because my glass had a chip in it. I have never been so insulted and did not expect such a petty and offensive gesture from a Chicago institution like Morton's.   Nobody ever apologized for serving me a drink in a chipped glass and our service from that point on was borderline rude and almost non-existent.

2015-07-13,3.0,"I've been slowly knocking off steakhouses in Chicago from my list (some more and better yelp reviews to follow) and went to Morton's for the first time this past weekend with my fiance. Sadly due to money this is only a  2 or 3x a year occurrence in Chicago, but as I have a slight obsession with steak, I've been going to high end steak houses practically my whole life (thanks to my entire family's obsession). Unfortunately I don't think I'll be returning to Morton's again.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Throughout the whole dinner, our server was great- prompt but not overbearing, friendly, helpful (I believe our server's name was Kelly). We were given bread at the beginning, and maybe because I was starving, it was possibly the best part of the meal. I ordered the shrimp cocktail and my fiancé the caesar salad. According to my fiancé the salad was good, but the shrimp cocktail was just average. The shrimp cocktail came out smoking, I believe they serve it over dry ice, which was definitely interesting in a good way. However, when I'm paying $21.50 for 5 shrimp on a shrimp cocktail it better be one of the best I've ever had, and not distinctly average.  For comparison's sake the shrimp cocktail at Capital Grille is $16 (for 6 shrimp), and remains one of the best I've ever had.  For our main courses we both ordered the filet mignon (8oz), mine at medium and my fiance's at medium well (travesty). Since she ordered hers medium well they offered to butterfly it which she gladly accepted. Hers came out perfectly cooked and tasted pretty good. Mine however came out rare. Keep in mind, this wasn't a case of people having slightly different perspectives of what temperature a cut of meat is, it was cold and red in the middle, nowhere close to medium (for the record if the steak comes out medium-rare or medium well I would eat it and not send it back). The waitress quickly took the steak away back to the kitchen- no big deal. But here is where we run into the issue I had. While they quickly ""fixed"" the issue, they did so by reheating the steak and bringing it out at the correct temperature. I would have no issue with this at a lone star or outback type of place, but when the steak is priced over $50 and we are easily spending $100+ /person I expect a new steak. When you cook a steak you normally let it rest and settle on completion- for that reason reheating a steak is never really the best course of action. Not to mention when it's been cut down the middle and then reheated you've effectively ruined the best part of the steak.  I get it's obviously cheaper to reheat the steak, but at a place like Morton's I was expecting a little different. On a side note, a manager (I think- he never introduced himself, but he was wearing a suit) brought my reheated steak out.

Morton's delivered on both fronts. I actually had never been to the State Street Morton's, though I've been lucky enough to go to Gibson's, Hugo's, and newcomers like Chicago Cut. Morton's itself is a bit dated and definitely feels...old, not really sleek nor with-the-times. Still, it's very classy and comfortable.

The tuna tartare was OK - I had high hopes for it but it was slightly fishy. The good news is that our small-but-filling filets were AMAZING. We both got medium. My filet was cooked just perfectly for my tastes and not too charred (some steaks are too cool in the middle and too charred for my taste - the worst of both worlds!). The steamed broccoli was not life-changing, but it was good. My friend's horseradish mashed potatoes were pretty good! Dessert was nothing special - the key lime pie tasted pretty generic. I doubt it was store-bought, so I won't allege that, but it certainly was a close relative to the store-bought variety. I once had the key lime pie at Joe's and it could very well have ruined other steakhouse incarnations for me. :0 Anyway, I'd go back to Morton's, especially since the steak itself is fantastic, but other aspects of it didn't completely wow me.",0.9943,0.723,0.206,0.071,0.5716682228446935

I said OK, but in the back of my mind I was a bit confused, as I don't believe that any of the old-fashions that I've ever had included soda.  I did a little research later on and found that these are variations to the traditional old-fashioned.

2013-11-24,1.0,"Back in town for the holidays and what better way to celebrate some time back in the city then a reservation at the famous Morton's on State.  Two things I was hoping for after experiencing other locations; the Charm and the Service. Sadly both were lacking and I think this location pretty much is phoning in the any attempt at either by slacking on name alone.  The interior is dated and tacky, the feel of a 1990's basement era in much need of a remodel job.  I don't care for all that; I'm spending dollars for a good steak, glass of wine, and a night of gluttony. But in this day and age, similar to an older yelp review of this location, better steaks and service can be had from places which do not thrive on name alone.  Just like us older Bulls fans, we're slowly going to have to move on from the Michael Jordan debates and find a steakhouse with a better quality of service and attention. What really grinds my gears about this place is the attempts of staff; both management and waiters to fawn hand and foot over the older folks and whatever definition may be for a ""Traditional Steakhouse"" customer, but completely disregard any attempt at service for those perceived to be a non profitable investment. IE, anyone under the age of 30 who looks like they don't have money to splurge, but I like to surprise those that judge, and only after a substantial salad/steak/wine/two sides order was the attention very minimally turned to us.  And by minimal, I think my party was offered to take the bread home in a to go box.  As George Takei would say, ""Ohhhh Myyy...""  Overall, my service experience was poor, and I'm the type to give plenty of reasonable doubt.  Such sins include: lack of providing a wine list for our review, lack of offering wine suggestions, and not offering any detail into the steaks or sides.  Yes, I get it, it's a steakhouse, it's self explanatory. But what really drove me over the edge was that I simply saw him offering other tables service and attention hand over foot to older parties, providing those tables attention for a significant amount of time, 18 minutes by my iphone count, without even considering my dinner reservations, my meal, or should I say, ""how everything was going."" I was tempted to leave as a tip, something with snark and a little bite, like $0.1 on a $100+ tab for dinner for one, taking into consideration such terrible service; but figured I'd be the better patron.  But this is one experience I won't forget and more than likely avoid this location for any gathering in the foreseeable future.

Which is fine if you're blown away, but if I made that asparagus at home I'd throw it away before I'd served it to friends.

I'm not much into service, but the staff members that we encountered were extremely polite, helpful, and professional.  The atmosphere wasn't especially fun or exciting but, as I said, we went on a low turnout Tuesday night.  If you plan to walk around after dinner, the location on State Street is fabulous.",0.9848,0.79,0.178,0.032,0.5950218938149973

Big tip about restaurants: if they have burned-out light bulbs in the ceiling, you probably don't want to eat there. If they don't pay attention to small things, they're letting bigger things slide; many of them in the kitchen. I ordered an 8 oz filet mignon, medium rare, but it came-out medium to medium well. Kind of ruined it. The waiter not only got the temperature wrong, but served me my buddy's pork chop. ""I didn't order a pork chop."" ""Oh."" He served my buddy's girlfriend and I the filet's, but then wasn't sure whose was whose, so he took them back to the kitchen to check temperature, while my buddy sat there with a pork chop in front of him.  I ordered green beans, but when my steak came, I got asparagus. ""We're all out of green beans."" ""Thanks for the heads-up."" I guess he assumed asparagus was cool for me. Kind of a cluster, and I paid $95 just for me. I didn't even take a date w/me. That's just one person, with crappy service. Hey, I'd spend $300 with a date, and if it was awesome, great. It was not awesome. It was nothing like Gibson's, Hugo's, etc., which is who they're supposed to be competing with. I've eaten at those restaurants several times, and they're always great. Why isn't the Landry's district manager doing a walk-through, and firing the Morton's manager simply because there are a bunch of burned-out bulbs? Maybe the Landry's guy needs to be fired too.

2012-11-08,4.0,"What:  Classy dinner for two. Where:  Morton's, The Original. When:  Saturday night. Why:  Because I have a Master's Degree, bitches. Unlike some of my friends who ""Tru on a Tuesday,"" I like to save high-end dinners for special occasions.  It keeps me from getting spoiled.  I do love me some steak, so the original Morton's seemed an appropriate please to celebrate my completion of B-school, courtesy of my favorite loved one. So where to start?  The location.  Sure, it's bizarre, located in the basement of Newberry Plaza.  I thought I was walking into a service entrance when I opened the door, and the stairwell felt like I was walking into my grandparents old basement, with pictures of past and present mayors instead of embarrassing family photos.  I suspect this place used to have a secret past hidden from the rest of Chicago, but maybe that's me trying to be an investigator. When we walked in there was a bit of traffic at the counter.  Apparently the hostess counter doubles as a coat check line, so we stood and waited while the 5 people in front of us got their coats.  I don't know where there would be room to do this, but maybe have a second host(ess) or dedicated coat-checker? We were taken to the very back of the restaurant and given our menus.  They were personalized, with ""Congratulations on your Graduation!!!"" (Yes, 3 exclamation points!!!  They must have been as excited as I was!!!) written at the top.  Nice touch.  Every person who came to our table, including the wine people, congratulated me.  Baby, I'm THE star. We were given the wine list and a giant loaf of toasted onion bread.  Mom always said, ""don't spoil your appetite by filling up on bread!""  Sorry, Mom, but you haven't had the toasted onion bread at Morton's.  I wish they gave you one to take home with you. We ordered a bottle of Mirassou, picked solely based on the funky name, and put in an order for the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella.  It was tough to pick an appetizer since 90% of them involve seafood and I do not care much for it, and cheese is always an easy way to please.  The combination was delicious, topped with watercress and balsamic.  However, there were two of us, and three of those, and we ended up having to split the last one.  I wish there would have been four because I wanted another whole one to myself. We put in our dinner orders.  I went with the 8oz center filet done medium; date went with the filet done medium-rare/shrimp/bacon-wrapped scallop combo.  Because all the great Chicago steakhouses know how to cook up some awesome red meat, I have to judge them by the sides they offer.  For our sides we chose the broccoli and the truffle parmesan fries.  My filet was delicious, although closer to medium-rare than medium, but I didn't mind.  I ate the entire thing easily and only wished I had ordered the 12oz.  I cannot speak for my date's meal, but I ate half of a scallop, and thought it was cooked perfectly and coupled nicely with the bacon.  The broccoli was massive and came with a hollandaise sauce; in my perfect world, it would have come with butter, but I ate it plain with salt and used it as an excuse to cut out excess calories.  In hindsight, I wish we would have gone with the jumbo asparagus, which looked tasty.  The truffle parmesan fries were out of this world, but I secretly lusted over the huge pile of hash browns the table behind me had.  Is there a way to make it a win-win and create truffle parmesan hash browns?  You would have me sold!  I was a bit underwhelmed with the overall choices of sides, especially because, two years later, I am still thinking of the fried green tomatoes from Joe's. To make up for lost calories by the hollandaise elimination, a piping hot chocolate lava cake served with ice cream came to the rescue.  I was in no mood to eat more, and I don't even really like chocolate, but I could not help but dig in to such a decadent treat.  It was perfect, delicious, and we ate every last bit. And the bill?  Well, I didn't pay, but I know it was expensive.  But, like Cybil Shepherd says, ""You're worth it.""  She was specifically talking about me when she said that. A great dinner with great company.  Thanks, Morton's, for making me feel real special on my special day.",0.9993,0.772,0.196,0.032,0.5841570466570467

The overcooking and inconsistent cooking of a steak is the ultimate sin of steak house. Especially one with the reputation of Morton's.  Also on the way up the stairs as we were leaving, there was a used bandaid on the floor, which grossed me out. Cleanliness should be the number 1 priority of any restaurant I think.  The pros were that the wine list was excellent.  The service, food (including desert), and overall ambiance were average at best if not subpar, especially considering the high expectations I had for this place.

Had lots of great experiences here and other Morton's but this one is poorly managed/training must be off. One of the assistant servers tried to take our wine order. I asked about a bottle on their 'Rare' list and he literally said ""It's pretty good."". That's it. I said, 'what can you tell me about it?' He said, ""Well, they let us taste it and it's pretty good."". Lol. I then had to ask if there was someone who could come over who knew something more about the wine. He said yes and left. Then, the same guy came back (!) and said ""I asked our manager and he said it's medium bodied."". Literally that's it. I then asked again if someone could provide more info so he left again. Well, Joe, the manager came over, the very guy who the assistant server had consulted apparently and in fact just said 'it's medium bodied but for the price is a great value.'. That's all he could tell me. When you're spending hundreds of dollars on wine, I fully expect much more knowledgable and professional service. On top of this, my bone-in ribeye was undercooked. At the end of the meal, after the server ran the credit card, he came back and announced (loud enough for  the whole table to hear that the AmEx Platinum our host tried to use was expired (it expired the day before).  Our host graciously explained that he just got a new one but grabbed the wrong one and there would be no problem w the credit and  could they call AmEx to figure it out. The manager then came over and rudely said that 'they don't do that (call AmEx), and I've never been asked to before.'. Our host then went to the front of the restaurant w the manager to call AmEx, but the manager didn't offer to call their merchant services number so it ended up taking much longer than our host was comfortable with so he finally decided to use another card (which of course was immediately approved). Bottom line, a restaurant charging this much should have handled this very differently, and should be trained to simply call the card holders bank to try to sort it out before coming back to the table like lazy slobs.

For entrees, we both went with the filet mignon served ""Oscar style"" - butterflied and topped with jumbo lump crab and asparagus. We both requested them cooked medium but mine was a little over-cooked and his slightly under-cooked.. maybe it had to do with the size of the cut (8 oz. for me, 12 oz. for him). We also ordered a side of horseradish mashed potatoes - a nice compliment to our entrees. Overall, it was a good meal although I wished my filet hadn't been over-cooked. I had read numerous reviews prior to dining here with people describing how their meat was cooked perfectly and could be cut with a fork. I was a little disappointed that I couldn't say the same.

They didn't skimp on the alcohol at all, and were mixed very well. Our appetizer was the crab cake. Hands down the best crab cake I've ever had. They brought a cart around with steak cuts and a live lobster squirming around begging for his life. That was hard to see.

Please fire him for forcing me to see it (I could have done a better presentation then him anyways)!!! I always tell the Chicago servers that story and we have a good laugh at the LA servers expense. The warm bread with toasted onion on top is so good. We can never stop eating it and we should not be filling up on it because of the amazing food on the way. For starters I highly recommend the jumbo cold lump crabmeat cocktail and the Colossal shrimp Alexander. Both of these are so good and we can not start our dinner out with anything else. Next you must get the wedge salad. It is so good and is one of the best I have ever had. In fact, I measure every wedge salad against this salad. Nobody beats it anywhere! Now it is time for the double cut filet cooked medium rare. It is like butter. The knife hardly has to cut through it. I think I might even be able to cut it with my fork. I can hardly express in words how good this steak is. And do not forget the sides...get them all. Okay I am kidding! If you have to choose, then go with these: grilled asparagus, baked potato and Lyonnaise potatoes. The Lyonnaise potatoes are like a dream for me. They are so tasty. At this point you should be stuffed but it is desert time. So go with two, the key lime pie and the hot chocolate cake. The key lime is better then anything you will find in Florida.  I love this place and I love the fact that Morton's started here. This is a Chicago original and it makes me proud to be a Chicago Guy!!!",0.9974,0.724,0.194,0.082,0.5802651515151517
2012-01-30,4.0,"Went to Morton's Friday night with the family.  We did a yelp check-in and got the amazing dinner for 2 for only $109.99.  This deal included soup/salad, filet, choice of seafood, vegetable side and dessert PER PERSON.  Plus we threw in a bottle of red wine for only $45.    There were 4 of us so we all ordered different seafood and vegetable sides to get a taste of it all. I can't even begin to describe the amount of food we had.  The portions of everything from the salad to the vegetable to the dessert were huge.  I can't imagine anyone actually finishing all the food.  Unfortunately, I spent too much of my time and energy eating the delicious chop salad that by the time my steak came I could barely eat it.  Good thing was that I did get it all wrapped up to go and was able to eat it the next day and it tasted amazing even on a reheat.  The deal is unbeatable so you must get it but don't pull a rookie move like me and waste all your time on the salad.  Although the salad and onion bread is good, it'll ruin your appetite for your delicious steak and seafood.  My favorites were the creamed spinach and the crab cake.  The key lime pie and chocolate cake for dessert were also really good. Our server told us that Morton's has been bought out and sold to a new management company so this deal is ending soon, go get it while you can!",0.9615,0.844,0.117,0.039,0.5561688311688312

Sooooo much food, what a great deal. I got the Lobster Bisque for my soup and this was Amazing! They put huge pieces of lobster in the soup which made it even better. The Filet Mignon was good. Mine was a little under cooked for my liking and I can't really say anything about the meat wowed me. I came with a group so I got to try all three seafood dishes and would suggest the Crab Cake. This was really good! The Jumbo Shrimp was alright and the Scallops were very fishy and I would suggest steering clear of those bad boys. The different sides we tried were the Creamed Spinach (Awesome!), Sauteed Button Mushrooms (Pretty Boring) and the Grilled Jumbo Asparagus (Really Good) For dessert I got the Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake and I can see why this is ""legendary"" because it was AMAZING! Soooooo good. I'm not a big dessert person but I may just have to get this anytime I come back to Mortons.

The service was subtle and simple or, if you wanted to get jovial with your waitress after a few lemon drops, it became what you wanted. . . a bit of a song and dance. She was a delight, having us feel as though we were the favorite table. She WAS comfort. After all, everyone just wants to love and be loved. While eating filet. Morton's is typical in a lot of respects. Buttoned leather, white table clothes, plenty of ties and suits. Cutting into meat may be decidedly male, but after making eye contact with a few female patrons we had an understanding. Maybe we would take back the steak. Make it ours. Smoke our own cigars and tap our own cask. I felt right at home here, sitting in the darkness with two handsome men, gasping at portion sizes and flavors. I ordered first. It always feels good to lead. Placed in front of me were roasted brussels and bacon, tuna tartare, petite filet and carrot cake. I ordered the carrot cake first and with emphasis. Cream cheese frosting ought not wait for anyone. I couldn't finish but a few bites of everything, but that's how the steakhouse train moves. Chug-a-chug-a-toot toot! Slowing to a stop. What should be creamy was. . . what should be savory and charred delivered.  Morton's was an experience best remembered by the company you kept.

2011-08-14,2.0,"Ok, maybe this is not a fair review about a steakhouse since my wife and I just went to Peter Luger Steakhouse in Brooklyn, NY less than 2 weeks ago.  Still this was a subpar experience for my taste bud.  At least the service was reasaonable and my wife loved the ambience. We went to Morton's the original place to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We decided to taste both the strip steak and ribeye, which were actually too much for two of us.  If you go as couple and only one of you (or neither of you) has big stomach, I totally recommend you order a big steak and share it with a couple of sides.  This will do well for your good dining experience. Anyway, my strip steak was so disappointing.  It was a little bit dry and was undercooked (I order a medium and got an almost medium rare one).  My wife's ribeye was ok, but she said it wasn't better than some of the steak I cooked for her.  The brussel sprout side was good but we didn't go there paying 200 dollars for that.  Lastly their souffle was almost disastrous.  Here, this may not be fair also, because I had the best souffle you could get at Adour Alain Ducasse in NYC less than a month ago. Still, it was a definitely undercooked souffle and you could almost smell the uncooked eggs from it.   As I said before my wife liked the ambience and the service was reasonable, we may go back to this place, but not for their steak for sure.",0.9583,0.82,0.129,0.051,0.5028673835125449
2011-06-15,4.0,"Morton's--your epic steak and generous portions thrill me!! So let me set the scene.  It was a Saturday night at 6:45.  My posse of three and I were getting the WORST service by the waitress at Tavern on Rush.  We decided we didn't want to spend one more minute or one more dime in that place, but we still needed to eat.  So we look out the window.  What do we see but the mecca that is Morton's The Steakhouse calling our names.  My husband places a quick phone call and asks if they have any wait.  They said if we could get there in 5 minutes, they could accommodate us.  I have never gotten my butt out of a chair faster!! We were seated right away in their intimate dining room, and our server brought out the giant onion loaf.  I don't care if you're on your first date with your potential life partner and you're worried about things getting stuck in your teeth or bad breath--eat the onion bread.  It's a giant loaf of awesome. So the waiter brought out the meats and explained each one.  I felt slightly bad for the live lobster, but it didn't make me want to eat him any less.  The presentation of the meats was very helpful in helping us choose what we wanted to order! To start, I got the house salad and french onion soup, and my friend got the lobster bisque.  My house salad (especially the dressing) was fantastic, and my french onion soup was delicious as well, but the lobster bisque that my friend got was a game changer.  This soup was DELICIOUS and I usually don't go for cream-based soups.  I think if she could have gotten away with licking the bowl and not gotten ""looks"", she would have.  heck, I almost did it, and it wasn't even my soup!! But my husband and I split the filet mignon-double cut, cooked medium (but it turned out to be way more rare than medium--sad face), and my friends got some sort of amazing shrimp dish (SO good!) and the Strip Steak which really WAS cooked medium, and was quite the delicious little number! The only thing that brings this review down to four stars was the wait.  Now I am alllll about the ""experience"" of the food in fancy restaurants, but we were told that if we were going to order one of their specialty desserts (um, duh, of course we are!!) then we should order it with our meal because it takes a while to make.  So we did--my friend and I ordered the Baked Hot Chocolate (see picture) and my friend ordered the carrot cake.  So we finish our meal, our plates are cleared, and we are waiting for our dessert for a good half and hour before we asked about it.  He said it would be right out.  Then we asked again about 10 minutes later, and we were told the same thing.  it was brought out about 10 minutes after that.  What was the point of ordering it ahead of time if we had to wait that long anyway??  We almost missed the beginning of our comedy show! But overall, it was a great experience, and if I ever find myself with $125 (pre tip) to spare and really want steak, I would return!! :)",0.9966,0.811,0.141,0.048,0.5703329882677709

2010-11-30,4.0,"What could be better than Sunday night dinner at the original Morton's Steakhouse? That's how I started my Thanksgiving week - an over sized bone-in fillet. It's a long story why we were all there for dinner but we had a great time. I don't know if Morton's would qualify as my favorite steakhouse in Chicago, I don't eat at steakhouses frequently so it's not an issue anyone. Dan has a great story about Morton's, specifically Arnie Morton, so we always enjoy sharing a meal there. We were a table of six and started with the hot platter sampler, featuring grilled shrimp, oysters Rockefeller, crab cakes and bacon wrapped scallops. Everything was tasty, especially the shrimp and scallops. We also had an order of tuna tartare, delicious, which was half gone by the time I could take a photo and eat a piece. The sauce on the plate was a bit salty, but applied in moderation was fine. This was all in addition to the amazing onion bread that's been there since day one. The main course was, SURPRISE, steak. For first-timers, definitely ask for the whole display presentation. You get to see the cuts in the flesh before making a choice. I decided to try a special, a 13oz bone-in fillet with the au poivre sauce. In addition to the meat, the table ordered asparagus, creamed spinach and potatoes.  My steak was very tasty, the product of a great formula and the highest quality meat available. I really liked the au poivre sauce, though I know that goes against the purists out there. As much as I like steak, I did not come close to finishing my portion (great for leftovers!). Erica had no problem finishing her petite fillet. The creamed spinach and potatoes were amazing, always solid choices as sides.  I am not a huge steakhouse guy and would not feel confident differentiating between the great choices in Chicago. Morton's is the preferred family spot and that is fine by me. There are many good reasons why there are about 80 successful locations around the world (and the meat is always sourced from Chicago). They serve the highest quality steaks and seafood in a classy, old-world setting. Never forget to order plenty of the amazing sides and starters, and enjoy the attentive, friendly and knowledgeable servers.

So when the service element was severely lacking on my trip to this establishment, I was really let down.  I went on my birthday. We were told to wait a bit before our table was ready despite a reservation. Upon being seated, our waiter was quite unwelcoming. It seemed like he was pre-judging based on our age that we weren't going to be big spenders, and he certainly did not go the extra mile to make the evening enjoyable. He rushed through the menu, was not friendly while taking the order, and seemed to look down upon our wine order. He did not come back to check in on how things were going and it took a while to get the check. Given that literally steps away are two additional great steakhouses (Gibson's and Hugo's Frog Bar) it's hard to imagine that level of service is the norm, so it's unfortunate this happened but worth pointing out.",0.9216,0.842,0.122,0.036,0.5138053467000835

This special includes 2 salads, 2 apeteizers, 2 desserts, and a filet mignon and 2 sides. That was what we ended up ordering but we paid a little extra to get a different cut of beef, which was prefectly fine with me. For the apetizer we ordered the the scallops wrapped in bacon, jumbo crab cake, and 1 dozen oysters. The oysters were very fresh. The scallops were seasoned perfectly. The crab cake was amazing. It was all crab and seasoned nicely. For our sides, we ordered the sauteed spinach and mushrooms and the onion rings. We wanted to try the onions because it came with a special thai dipping sauce. Those side choices were ok. I didn't really care for the onion rings and the sauce didn't make it any more special. The mushrooms and spinach didn't have that much flavor, but was decent.  For dessert we had the creme brulee (this was VERY VERY good) and the hot chocolate cake. I didn't think the chocolate cake was that great. I guess I was excited for try it and when it came out it wasn't anything special for me. Overall the food was excellent, the service was decent, and we enjoyed our dinner there.

The scallops that came with the steak were not browned but rubbery!. I've had better at red lobster for much less money. The prix fix came with dessert.

This location is normally busy but gets extra busy for dinner on the weekends.  Expect the usual business crowd in here during the week.  You also get some of the younger crowd who go here before hitting the State and Rush scene. The menu is the stock standard Morton's menu available around the country.  I usually go for the Porterhouse medium rare but have been known to take on the Double Porterhouse when feeling peckish.  I've also given the Prime Rib a couple of tries, and while not perfect, it is probably just behind Gibsons as the best I've had in Chicago.  Just save yourself the hassle and get the creamed spinach and potatoes.    When getting dessert at Morton's you only really need to get their Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake.  Don't expect to be able to move for a while after as it will fill up every empty space you had left over after you entree. The wait staff, hostesses and bartenders are always very cordial and I've yet to have a bad experience with them (some can be a bit dull, just depends who you get).  Reservations are a must have.  Valet is available and they park in the buildings garage, so no long waits in the Winter.  Definitely the best Morton's I've been to, don't hesitate to give it a try.",0.8528,0.854,0.088,0.058,0.40486111111111117

The steak was perfectly seasoned, tender and cooked precisely rare. The weakest link was the broccoli, as the hollandaise was very good, but I prefer my veggies with a tangy kick.

Not only do my Dad and I share a birthday, we also share a love of steak, AND, just a week after we both turned older, his work brought him to Chicago. And with it the offer to book a table anywhere I'd like.  Where I'd like was first Gibsons, but getting a table there o a Saturday seems nigh on impossible, so I settled for Morton's - the original location, for authenticity's sake. And i starved myself all day to prepare. This red meat game is serious business.  This was a very very good meal. Was it the best piece of steak I have ever eaten? Why yes, it was. Was it the best bearnaise I have ever had? Yes indeedy. Could I have dived in and swam about in the mashed potatoes given half a chance? Yup. Was it the best meal of my life and did it justify the price (I sneaked a look at the birthday bill and grew another year older)? No, but that doesn't mean it wasn't amazing - there were just a couple of little niggling things to drop that last star, for me, at least.  Let's get it out of the way though, the food is phenomenal. Bacon wrapped scallops tasted of scallops and were huge, hot through (impressive for scallops the size of small cars), and juicy. Their accompaniment sauce was delicious but pointless - ditto the jumbo crab cake. Seafood, when it tastes like fresh seafood, should be left well alone. Dad polished off a porterhouse, god knows how, and I a filet, with mash and garlicky green beans. No garlic was spared in the making of those beans. Even the onion warm bread loaf they bring at the beginning is too good - I filled myself up prematurely, dammit. Hence, no dessert.  But: they forgot us. We were left to stew in the bar for almost an hour, having arrived ten minutes early. When reminded, a table was magically ready... yes, they definitely forgot us. I was sad.  Second but: that table presentation. I don't object to it in principle, perhaps we got a bad-day waiter, but he spoke too quietly and too fast, as if he was scared we might ask a question. It wasn't informative, it just showed me what bits of raw beef looked like. And I was set on having lobster bisque until he picked up the poor 'example' lobster and it waggled its little legs at me. Honestly, after a bottle of wine later, I nearly liberated the blighter. There is no point in doing this. Lobster is tasty. A live lobster with blue rubber bands on doesn't LOOK tasty. Put it away! Third but: the wine list seems extensive and reasonably priced but I was offered no help on it and felt rushed into choosing so didn't ask, when really I should have done. Again, I think our waiter was just having a bad day.  Final but: as we came down the stairs, we weren't met by the wonderful smell of frizzling meat, but with the smell of a butcher's shop, i.e. the raw stuff. It wasn't very pleasant.  All in all, we had a wonderful meal - as we should for the price. The ambience is perfect and the food fantastic.

2009-08-15,4.0,"So I was in Chicago and felt the need of some good ole prime red meat. Since I have visited a number of Morton's around the country, I thought I should try the original restaurant where it all started. Personally, I love the fact that it's a bit hard to find. The small Morton's name plate on a nondescript door is the only indicator that you have found the restaurant. After walking down a flight of stairs you get to the restaurant. Inside is classic Morton's.....dark lighting, dark furniture, a little Frank singing in the background.... The evening started with a decent sidecar to drink. Not bad, not the greatest either but I had another one anyway before the Morton's presentation. I let our very efficient and friendly waiter Lorenzo go through the presentation even though I knew that I was going to get the Steak and Seafood special for two going on until the end of September. It's a smoking deal....signature salad, filet, choice of seafood, share a potato and vegetable, and each with gets key lime pie or hot chocolate cake...all for $99. You have the option of upgrading your steak, which I did. I opted for the wedge salad, a rib eye cooked perfectly medium rare, baked potato, asparagus and the hot chocolate cake with ice cream. For an appetizer, an order of very flavorful blue point oysters was consumed quickly! Everything was delicious and cooked as ordered.  As for the service, as I mentioned above, was very efficient. Lorenzo would come by refilling our wine glasses without us knowing sometimes. What was great was that since we were there for a birthday, Lorenzo gave us free passes to listen to jazz across the street. Now that's great service! I checked to see how much the special is here in San Diego and it's $109. Still a deal in my opinion considering the quality and quantity of food you are getting.",0.9953,0.817,0.166,0.016,0.5734367484367485

Dessert - we typically always get the chocolate lava cake, but today we had 4 people total, so we also got the baked apple pie dessert.  Both are very good, so it depends on what kind of sweets you like - chocolate or fruity.  Chocolate lava cake - perfection - it doesn't get better than this.  The outside of the cake is hard and crispy, and the inside is gooey, but thick and not runny.  They put the perfect amount of vanilla ice cream next to it and it's the perfect compliment.  The apple is very good - it's VERY apple-y, very thin slices of apple with raisins on a thin layer of pastry.  Comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I would have preferred more pastry on the bottom.  While the apple was good, I'm just a chocolate person through and through, so we'll always get the chocolate and probably only the apple when we go with other people. Service here is top-notch, I prefer this location to the one on Wacker Pl based on my last experience at both locations.  They treat you nicely from the hostess right down to the bus boys.  The last few times I've had servers with thick accents, so it's hard to hear with all the noise, but luckily I know the menu and know what I want, so I just nod and smile.",0.9984,0.731,0.216,0.052,0.5246051726051727

If you're looking for something healthier, they certainly have a fine selection of seafood. The steaks I've had were cooked to perfection and typified how the occasional expensive red meat indulgence can be such a treat. Surprisingly, the veggies almost steal the scene from the entrees (almost). Really good stuff, as are the desserts, if you can last that long. They boast a fine wine cellar (not that I'm anything like an expert on wine). On one visit, I was disappointed that the bar didn't have the ingredients for a Cable Car, and then I stumped the bartender again when I ordered a Sun and Sand.

2009-03-22,2.0,"THIS is the famous Morton's?  This place must be ringing the cash register based solely on reputation.  There are at least ten better steakhouses just in downtown.  Last night's visit disappointed me at every turn.  First, it's difficult to find this place.  ""1050 N State"" doesn't tell you enough; they should have signs and arrows for first-timers.  You have to go into an office building (hopefully guessing the correct entrance) and then through a nondescript wooden door which leads down a staircase.  Yes, the restaurant is unexpectedly underground. I was very early for a large-group reservation, so of course I bellied up to the bar.  I figured, old-fashioned sort of place, I'll try an old-fashioned sort of cocktail:  Tom Collins.  I love them, but hardly anywhere can make a good one.  Put Morton's on the bad side of the list because it was terrible.  I ordered a second one just so that I could watch him make it (an expensive experiment at $11.50 a pop) and sure enough, he pulled out a plastic bottle of pale yellow-green mix.  MIX?  Are you fucking kidding me, Morton's?  I should have refused it but I'm a lush and he was using Bombay Sapphire. We had reservations for eight at 8:30.  I arrived around 8 and noticed a table for eight in the middle of the dining room, all set up.  And indeed, it turned out that this was our table...when they finally seated us near 9.  Our whole party was there by 8:35.  We checked in.  We followed up.  We followed up again.  They finally seated us after a twenty-minute wait.  The table was ready the whole time.  Why were we not seated?  I wanted to complain, but I was just meeting most of these people for the first time and it was sort of their party anyway, so I let them handle it.  I really would have liked to hear an explanation though. The server.  This guy was all right, but he made a huge faux pas.  One of our group had sniffed out some kind of internet special and asked him to give us the rundown.  He sort of hemmed and hawed and played dumb for a minute, but when we finally cornered him with the details which we already had, he grudgingly stated the special (any salad, any seafood appetizer, any side dish, small filet, and one of two desserts for $50, plus steak upgradable for a surcharge).  But his annoyance was clear as he must have realized that his tip decreased by tens of dollars in one fell swoop.  Get over it, buddy.  Your restaurant offers the special.  Trying to hide it from us is disingenuous and borderline inexcusable.  Overall, I found the service slightly subpar for a place of this reputation and price level. But that special is a hell of a deal.  I have no idea how long it runs but they called it something like ""steak and seafood internet special.""   The food:  up and down.  I loved the warm onion bread.  The beefsteak tomato salad was simple and decent (B) and I tried my buddy's ""wedge"" salad which was also solid.  For some reason, they brought out the seafood appetizers with the steaks; in fact, the whole time they were rushing us from course to course.  The bacon-wrapped scallops were AWESOME--very simple, perfectly cooked, and came out HOT right from the oven.  I tried my neighbor's crabcake, and while she loved it, I found it bland.  It was mostly crab, which is a plus, but they need some other components in there for, you know, flavor. The steak was extremely disappointing.  I have cooked a better steak in my own kitchen in the last six weeks.  I upgraded to my mainstay porterhouse, and I shouldn't have bothered.  One side (I'm not sure which because it was dark in there and I was caught up in the conversation) was a B-, the other was a D.  Another reviewer mentioned oversalting, and that's how I felt about the B- side.  The D side was just flavorless and slightly overcooked.  A steak should be one of life's finer pleasures.  What a waste. I chose spinach and mushrooms for my side and can't complain, although it's inherently a boring dish.  I needed something light to complement the rest of the food orgy.  I tried a bite of the macaroni and cheese and liked it, but I could never have finished a whole serving. Dessert was key lime pie (a favorite of mine) or warm chocolate cake.  I ordered the former and sampled the latter from my two nearest neighbors.  D+ on the key lime pie and B+ on the cake.  I was the only one at the table to eat every bite of food put in front of me (I'm a glutton that way) but I ate only four bites of that crappy pie.   There was no special birthday gesture for my friend even though the occasion was mentioned to the wait staff.  Maybe they simply don't do it, but I've come to expect it from restaurants at this level, so that was one last disappointment.  Well, plus the fact that one girl at the table refused to go along with our proposed game of credit card roulette.  Lame.  So we all dutifully paid our portion, minus the birthday boy, and got the hell out.",0.9854,0.801,0.117,0.082,0.5359654720994927

Instead of a salad, I opted for oysters, and they were humongous. Entree was a bone-in ribeye. We had an array of veggies, plus mac n cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. The veggies were a little bit blah. I certainly don't expect a restaurant like this to be overly innovative, but I have to think that they can find something more interesting to do to a veggie than steaming.  I ordered a Grand Marnier souffle for dessert, and the waiter turned me down. He told me I should try the rasberry souffle instead. I trust waiters when they make recommendations like that, so I went with his recommendation. Unfortunately, I was a bit dissapointed.

2009-01-01,5.0,"Ideally I would have liked to rate Morton's 4.5 stars...since I do think it's about as good as a steakhouse gets, I guess 5 stars best represents my opinion. Morton's is simply a terrific restaurant for those who like the highest quality meats available.  In my four visits (three at the Original location, and once in the suburbs), I have found the food to be simply sublime.  The steaks are large, flavorful, and in my experience, cooked to perfect temperature each and every time I've visited.  I try to order bone-in steaks of some type since I've found that they have the most flavor, and the bone-in filet (apparently a special, although it seems to be becoming a popular choice at several Chicago steakhouses) didn't disappoint.  It was tender, perfectly cooked, and delicious.  I highly recommend it and also the rib eye. The appetizers are very good, although they are pricey for what you get.  In my last visit, we ordered a colossal shrimp cocktail and crabcake to split for the table.  The shrimp cocktail was as advertised, with each shrimp being gigantic.  The flavor was very good, but not the best I've ever had.  The crabcake was terrific, although you should realize that yes, they really do mean 'cake', singular...it's a bit pricey for a single crabcake, but boy is it yummy! The sides do vary in size somewhat, so you'll want to ask exactly how large each portion is...I haven't found any that are small, but some are typically sized, while others are huge (i.e. good for splitting among several people). For dessert, I can recommend the chocolate mousse. Service is usually very good, although it was a little too slow on my last visit...HOWEVER, this is understandable given that we went on New Years Eve.  Since we weren't on a specific schedule, this wasn't a problem. The restaurant is pricey, and you should plan to drop some serious coin here (note the $$$$ in the overview).  For most folks, Morton's will be a special occasion type restaurant.  It's ambience is that of an old Chicago steakhouse, which isn't necessarily the most romantic setting, but it is comfortable. I've been a huge fan of Chicago Chop House for several years now, but I must say that Morton's is giving it a run for top spot in my book for prime steakhouses.",0.9977,0.777,0.214,0.009,0.5633694805194804

The anniversary dinner experience started well.  We were seated promptly and given a wine menu.  The waitress came by and was very friendly and energetic in presenting the different cuts of meat and the lobster.  When I asked about the Steak and Seafood Special (plastered all over the website,  mortons.com ) everything started to go down hill.  She said, ""Oh, the special...

I suppose that the great experiences I read about here and on other food forums are true and consistent if you just go in ordering off the regular menu.  The attitude must've come off the asking for the special which is clearly advertised on their website on the front page.  She never offered to us and was probably disappointed that we knew about it.  If Morton's wants to gain new customers with a lower buy-in by advertising the special, the staff should at least respect the corporate decision and use the opportunity to gain a customer.  I will not go back to Morton's as there are many other steakhouses in Chicago that are better such as Gibson's, Chop House and Keefer's.  Nice try with advertising the ""special"", the treatment is anything but.",0.9868,0.876,0.105,0.019,0.5046695718811104

However, it's a bit more expensive than other steakhouses in the city that are just as good all-around, and it doesn't necessarily stand out in my mind over other steakhouses.  That isn't a bash, but there are so many great places to eat, I probably won't be back here very many times.",0.9256,0.813,0.187,0.0,0.6166666666666667

Ultraclean restrooms, and great values on bar snacks at happy hour and latenite.  They may or may not have invented the steakhouse, but they're close to perfecting it here.

2005-12-08,4.0,"Reminds me of what an established dining experience from the early 1900's might have been, typical large room filled with boisterous upper class patrons satisfying themselves on well prepared fine cuisine and substantial wines, while smoking the most expensive cigars available. I had the Spinach salad and the ""Farm Raised Salmon"" both of which were excellent, but nothing special when compare to other similar establishments. The service is decent depending on the size of your group as the servers know who will tip appropriately and cater to those they think will. My date and I were well satisfied with the meal overall. Morton's is a poor choice if large rooms filled with excessive conversation, smoke and affluent are ubiquitous, which makes it great for the affluent wanting to hobnob or yuppies wanting to dine like their folks and impress their friends. So, plan to spend some money while you hobnob with the elite.  Pros: Excellent Choices, Period Atmosphere, Sophisticated Cons: Mediocre service, Excessive Pricing, Crowded Cost: $$$$ of 5 Overall Rating: 3.75 of 5 Recommendation: Recommended",0.9887,0.745,0.22,0.034,0.6440079365079365
