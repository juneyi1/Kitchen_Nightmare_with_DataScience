So. My mother and I decide to go to this restaurant because her favorite is Chicken  mole.so  Upon arriving,there was one waitress and one bus boy(its was grown guy).My mother went to the restroom as i sat at a table(my first selection was dirty so i had to choose again).The busboy apparently had put chips and condiments on the table and apparently cough without turning his head..(which was disgusting..luckily i turned my head just in time)The salsa's bowl looked stained in one area with either previous residue or from that bus boy's fingers.. I think the biggest disappointed was which in some of these review quoted the food as cheap...hell no. it seem that they increased they're prices ridiculously..how does a $9.00 dollars dish go up to $11.00 dollars.  Well my mother and I decide to eat regardless (HINT:since it was our last time)So my mother ordered Horchata (which tasted terribly sweet,it was as if they added more sugar then needed..hell of alot of sugar) and I ordered unsweetened iced tea...(which they put a piece lime on it and it looked rather old)we put in our order,I got Chicken and Rice ($10.50)(Which I usually got the chicken,shrimp and crabmeat dish but unfortunately it went up to $14.50 Dollars) and my Mother got the Chicken mole ($11.00).Upon receiving the food,i didnt really look at in full close  detail.so  i was eating and i spotted what seemed like a piece of black hair or piece of synthetic black hair like from a wig or something..(I have bright pinkyish red hair).So I lost my appetite..after the first couple things,i decided well this is the last time,im coming here..so i didn't say anything and not once did the waitress come over to our table to ask if we needed anything or nothing of that sort . The restaurant was not full and it was only our table and another table.(that was it!) So we were going to decide to have the Chicken Mole to go but the waitress apparently had recieved a call for a order.(my mother asked if i was sure about taking the food to go and said yes )then i told my mother to forget it( (because the bus boy was useless and after that incident i said forget it!)So we got up to pay for our food and the waitress was still on the phone taking a order. At first we were nice and patient....time pass...the waitress is still writing a order..time  pass.my  mother signal the bus boy (which was pointless because he just walk by us and walk around the waitress ...that was it lmao) Time passes...i told my mother that I'll wait to pay for it and told her to go to her car (since my mother had knee surgery) ..time passes...I stare at the useless bus boy (who isnt picking up our dirty dishes or cleaning tables just standing there) I stare at the people who i can see from the kitchen...time passes..new customers come in..I continue to staring..then a cook from the kitchen comes by me and asks if i want to pay then takes my credit card but doesn't really help me because she put my card near the waitress still on the phone ..I stare at the ceiling (like wtf was that for)so the waitress finishes...instead of taking care of me,she takes the five page order (she wrote big) to the kitchen...time passes..she finishes our order card...and thanks me for waiting..which i smiled (BECAUSE I KNEW THIS WAS THE LAST TIME I WAS STEPPING IN THAT JOINT) Bottom line= I gave it  two stars due to the lack of customer service,ridiculously over priced food prices and only thing memorable was the pretty paintings on the wall...case CLOSED!",0.9059,0.857,0.077,0.066,0.5418689698101463

To say this is one of my favorite restauraunts is an understatement. My mother has been coming here for the last 20 years or so (crazy to think it's been around that long). Naturally, she brought me here at a young age and I've been in love ever since. Whenever we have a taco craving, this has been our place.  This place gets a bad rep and I don't  blame you. You get what you pay for and sometimes this place can be a real hit or miss. I've come here and enjoyed some of the best food I have ever tasted and other times, it didn't sit very well with me. I know we would all like to have a perfect dining experience every time but things happen and it certainly doesn't change my opinion. I see a few reviews that bash the personalities of the employees. Maybe it's just because I've been coming here for so long but these are some of the sweetest women I have ever met. Maybe they come off as shy but they get their job done. If you've been here, you know your food comes fast but sometimes they do get busy. Relax, take a breather, and enjoy your time there. Also, try to strike up a conversation and you'll soon realize that they actually do have a personality. I've seen and heard a lot of customers here act like complete pricks to these women for no reason at all. I'd be pretty quiet, too if I had to tolerate that every day. With that being said, maybe this place isn't your cup of tea and that's fine. Maybe you prefer a fancy dining experience and exquisite food on your plate. It's a taco joint, the food is flavorful, and their hot sauce is impeccable.  And for those of you complaining they don't serve alcohol, it's BYOB.",0.9879,0.798,0.138,0.064,0.5379092261904762

Even in my mildly inebriated state of being, I knew to lower my expectations. Yet even with the lowest of standards, the food here was barely passable. Perhaps in a smaller town or even in a different part of the city, this would have been acceptable, but not here.

2008-03-04,2.0,"I have to say I was disappointed by this restaurant.  My roommate and I decided to order some good, greasy mexican food to cure our hangovers on Sunday.  Our first disappointment with the place is they do not deliver.  Once we ordered, we went to pick up our food.  We got there and the entire place looked run down (old booths, tacky Easter decor) and probably not that clean.  The woman that got our to-go order ready acted put out by our request to change our Diet Coke to other types of pop.  Also, when my roommate called she specifically said the orders were separate.  However, when we went to pay they had it all on one bill.  They were able to split it up, but it still required additional time out of the day. When we got home we were excited to start eating our food.  We opened all the bags and realized they did not include my roommate's burrito order.  We called the restaurant immediately and he/she rudely replied she could pick up her burrito dinner in 10 minutes.  Once she got to the restaurant (within 10 minutes) she had to wait about 25 minutes for her burrito.  This means they had never even cooked the burrito in the first place probably!  Not to mention, the waitress was extremely mean to my roommate and acted upset by the whole situation when it was my roommate who should have been upset. The food was just so-so.  I am a vegetarian and decided to try the nachos.  The chips were so greasy and tasted of meat and/or seafood since they probably had been fried in the same dirty oil.  Neither of us got food poisoning or anything from the food, but neither of us was all that satisfied with the taste of the food overall.  I would stay away from this place unless it's 4am and the only place open!",-0.9536,0.887,0.031,0.082,0.5040458937198068

I ate a steak burrito suizo - I usually don't do suizo but the waitress insisted on it, which I thought was strange, it didn't cost anything more so I said sure.  I thought it was good.  The rice wasn't that great. I did like that the burrito came with sour cream and guac.  The chips and salsa they give you were OK, the hot wasn't so much salsa, it looked like a bowl of Louisiana hot sauce or something (didn't taste as good as Louisiana).

I haven't been here for a while , I kinda married someone that used to date one of the owners kids , tough breaks. Honestly I would not qualify this place as a destination place , more of a safe place that caters to circumstances. The decor is not anything that adds to it's appeal , unless you are a fan of Mexican kids on black velvet. The location is safe , even at 3am , but parking gets really tough after 8pm.  As for the food , it is authentic , if you are coming here expecting some sort of nuevo-Latin French-Mexican fusion , this ain't the place. If what you want is your standard fare , Tacos , Burritos  and the like , you should be ok. I'm not gonna be putting on any fireworks shows celebrating the food here , but I came here many a late night and ate well.
