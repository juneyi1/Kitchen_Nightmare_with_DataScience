The food came fairly quickly, perhaps about ten minutes. The crepes - highly recommend! They are very fresh and they have such a wide selection. The  creamy caramel creations was such a treat, you must try it if you like caramel. The Venice was also very fresh and had a distinct taste of red peppers. The Napolitan was an excellent carbonara dish, and is a good dish for sharing. They also had a special of an egg soufflé which was delicious, as there was potato on the bottom and seemed quite gourmet.

2017-02-13,2.0,"This was my first time visiting Iguana Cafe. In the issue of time, I wont go into too many details, but here are the three main reasons I only gave this restaurant two stars: 1) Our visit was on a Sunday, I called on the previous wednesday to make the reservation for 10 people- the man on the phone took my reservation and confirmed it. Unfortunately, once we arrived, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our table because they said we didnt have a reservation. Ok fine. These mistakes happen (even though I had record of the call on my phone log). But the issue was their ""hostess"" was anything but apologetic, in fact, she gave me attitude about it.  2) The food was just so-so;  nothing more than what you'd find at a corner diner. 3) Another disappointment was that the waitress did not tell me that the tip was already added in. We ended up only having 7 people so I didnt think that she would add it in, and obviously my fault for not checking. But I waited tables for 7 years and I would always let customers know when I added in the tip for a larger table. I guess some people are honest, while others are not.

The menu is extensive with many options both healthy and indulgent. I ordered the smoked salmon salad and it was a big portion and served with small toast slices.

As for their service, the server that brings the water out is very pleasant, but the one who takes our order is a bit rude.  She is so impatient with taking our oder. The specific experience I'm referring to is when I came with a friend once and ordered promptly.  The server came out with our dishes, and I very politely and gently said ""oh wait this is actually his dish"" as she placed the wrong plate in front of me.  The moment I said that, her eyes opened up wide as if I had delivered some horrible news to her.  She stared at me for a good 5 seconds, and then switched the dishes and walked away quickly.  A few moments later, I requested for her and said that they had made a mistake.  I nicely explained that I had asked for extra nutella on my waffle and not my friend because they stuffed his crepes with an excessive amount.  She apologized and came back out with a whole jar of Nutella.  I was baffled as to why she had done that.  I told her that was way too much, and her remark though rude made me giggle ""don't worry you can take that home with you, I'll pack it.""   All in all, that was a very odd experience, but I do highly recommend this place.  I hope that lady really sees this review and gets a laugh out of it but also treats us more properly next time.",0.9649,0.757,0.154,0.089,0.42464285714285704

2016-07-22,4.0,"Generally when I here the word café I think of a women's light lunch with dessert and coffee. This place does have dessert and coffee, along with a variety of light to medium eats, crepes, salads, wraps and sandwiches. In addition to the food, they serve alcohol, wine/beer and the harder stuff.  I had the Sparta, and it was perfect, in general I like any combination of spinach, feta and mushrooms. Add chicken and a crepe or eggs as an omelette and I'm a happy camper. Everything in this crepe was fresh and the chicken wasn't salty, which is a usual complaint of mine. I also didn't need to put any salt or pepper on it, as I said, perfect. I also enjoyed a a tasty white sangria, it was just the thing for a hot day, when the last thing you need is too much alcohol.  The vibe is bar like, dim with wood tables, not what I don't think about when you hear the word café. Perhaps, this is why there were more guys then women when I was here, this place had a different feel than Lutz or Selamarie for instance.

2016-07-05,3.0,"I stumbled upon this place when I had an intense craving for crepes. I guess I could say that I have a small obsession with them so I am always on the lookout for places that serve great crepes. I got the classic Tempting Trio crepe (Nutella, bananas, strawberries) and my friend got the Tropical Pleasure waffle. The portion sizes are huge here so you are sure to get your money's worth. The taste, however, was pretty mediocre. Normally, I am able to scarf down crepes larger than the size of my face (this one was as large as my face) with ease, but I found myself having a hard time finishing my crepe here. The ingredients were pretty run-of-the-mill and I found the presence of Nutella to be a bit overwhelming, especially towards the end. After finishing the crepe, I was left feeling a bit nauseated due to the overdose of sweetness I had just consumed. My friend felt the same after consuming his waffle (he even added ice cream to it...big mistake). If you have a huge sweet tooth, perhaps you should check out the Iguana Cafe. Otherwise, be prepared to experience an unpleasant overdose of sugar.",0.9824,0.771,0.193,0.035,0.632903439153439

Every time I come here, my go to dessert is The Chocolate Dream crepe; it's stuffed with nutella, crushed oreos, and served with a scoop of creamy chocolate ice cream & whip cream. I'm a die hard chocolate lover, so the more chocolate, the better. TRY IT!  I know people hype the European Dream (my friend's are obsessed), but I tried it, and I didn't...really...like...it. I don't know if it was because the honey was too overwhelming for my taste buds (overly sweet), but after a few bites, I wish I had just ordered my Chocolate Dream crepe. At least the ice cream served with the waffle was good!  I recently came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. I only order dessert whenever I come here, but I decided to try their tuna sandwich. I thought I was going to be able to finish it in one sitting, but I ended up packing it and taking it home because the portions were huge. Not complaining, though.

She came back three times to ask us if we were ready in less than 5 minutes. And would clear our plates when there was still a few bites left. Other than that again nice atmosphere and concept. The appetizer (goat cheese) was decent but something you can easily make at home with a small piece of goat cheese and tomato sauce. The crepe was great (though my French husband said they used the flour for a dessert crepe for the dinner crepes but then again it's not a French restaurant) I had the Amsterdam crepe which was the perfect blend of ingredients and a really good price for the ingredients and size.

The space is quite interesting. It's dark and intimate but with a fun eclectic vibe as well with the art and décor. This place seemed perfect for a date night. I ended up getting a cup of the creamy tomato basil soup, a scoop of vanilla and dulce de leche ice cream and a hot pomegranate green tea. Note that their portions are quite large. I thought my cup of soup was really the bowl size. Def not complaining. The soup was delicious and loved the texture as it had chunks of tomatoes in it and wasn't quite your standard tomato basil soup. The ice cream was alright, nothing special there. The tea was perfect and also came in a giant tall mug. It had the perfect note of pomegranate and was definitely brewed with loose leaf tea. I tried my friend's 'Sweet Sin' and that was yummy. Those caramelized apples were perfect. My other friend's brownie a la mode (with mint choc chip ice cream) was good too. Our server was great, even though she appeared to be the only one for the whole place.  Definitely need to come back for dinner and try some food and more offerings.

Overall an ok place except for one huge detail, see below at the last comments. I had one of there crepes, it was good, a little sloppier than id prefer butit still tasted good. We shared the crab/cheese dip app and it was also very good. In fact it was probably the best tasting thing of the whole time we were there. My wife had the chicken sandwich and complained it was very dry.  The staff didnt seem too motivated to be serving but we were there early around noon, not sure if thats an excuse or not but whatever. Our server cracked a smile here and there but nothing that made you feel comfortable or made you want to jump at the idea of goin back soon. Pricing was ok i guess, although I can count on one hand an easy number of places that serve much better food in larger portions for the same prices if not less.  Overall it wasnt horrible and if I happen to be in the area and hungry enough I may stop by again. One of my BIGGEST disappointments was their Bloody Mary.... After a night of normal drinking and waking up the next morning hungry for a good meal and thirsty for a nice hearty Bloody Mary to just start your day off right and set you up for a good day, a place like this you would imagine might offer just that right bloody for ya. Nope, it literally was like they cracked open a store brand can of tomato juice and added vodka to it, thats it! My wife is an experienced bartender so on top of me knowing good drinks thanks to her I also know and understand the level of certain places a place can offer and what can be expected. But there was honestly no excuse for this poor Bloody Mary. They couldve AT LEAST added some lime, and 3 olives as a garnish and it wouldve been an attempt, hell a pickle, celery stick. Salt on the rim, SOMETHING. Haha i never expect a fancy tower of garnishes and a bloody mary that has to be prepared by a chef type of deal but like I said...its not hard to put a toothpick through 3 olives, a squirt of lime and maybe a dash or two of hot sauce and your off to a good start lol. A couple bottles of either Zing Zang or Tobasco's bloody mixes to have around would make a WORLD of difference and still keep your cost down.  PS.

I only saw reserved signs on one of the tables, whereas the other table was clearly free. I decided to let it go and enjoy my meal. When it was time to pay the bill, we were given one check. Being an avid foodie in Chicago, it is customary to give separate checks for the convenience of the customers. Instead, we were told to only pay one bill. He suggested to use the ATM which would be an additional  2.25 charge. We offered to give our individual credit card information for each customer, he still did not oblige. He did not try and help us in any way.  Although the food is good, the cafe did not treat their customers respectively.

2015-07-20,5.0,"I love this place and I always feel welcome when I come here (which isn't as often as I'd like, due to the location being far from my apartment).  After reading some really negative reviews here I decided to give my two cents and explain why I love this place so much. In the process I plan on addressing some of the complaints I've seen on their yelp page.  Firstly, the coffee shop is very nicely decorated and isn't crammed at all. So, coming here for an afternoon get together with friends over some coffee and food is aesthetically pleasing. I was always greeted by the staff nicely and felt welcome. Speaking of the staff, one of you guys is owed a huge thank you for helping me get my friend out of the restroom that wasn't even locked (said friend is simply confused by how doors work). Thanks for helping and laughing it off.  Since I've been here quite a few times I can speak for several dishes that I personally enjoy:  Savory- Italian sandwich (get the potato salad as a side, much better pairing than pasta salad), carbonara and napolitan pasta, tirokafteri and the Mediterranean plate are great appetizers. They make a good club sandwich as well. If you want a lighter option their salmon salad is a good choice. Sweet- the Greek yogurt and Nutella & banana crepe.  Coffee- I've tried a bunch of their coffees, they make European style coffees that taste great. But I'm not going to give suggestions for the coffee, they have so many options I can only suggest you get adventurous and try something you haven't had before, or explore the different syrup options for a custom drink.  Now that food and drinks are covered lets talk about the service pace. Yes, it takes a while to get the check. The famed European style service that I hear about and experience a lot when dining in Eastern European places around town (and, well, in Eastern Europe in general) is present here as well. It truly is a thing, and I firmly believe it is due to trying not to have the patrons feel rushed, as opposed to what others have said (facebooking and ignoring patrons for no reason). Having that said, your water glasses will always be full and you will have ample opportunity to order additional items off the menu if you so choose. In a hurry? Don't appreciate the European dining pace? Me too! So now that you've been warned, make sure to mention to your server that you'd like the check to come out with your food and it will. Problem solved.  As for the review about split checks and being forced to order food... I split checks just about every other time I go here and it is never a problem. You were asked to order something at a place of business that offers food and beverages? How shocking! Iguana might have a homey feel to it but you are not, in fact, in your own living room.  Another thing I should mention for those that live or work around the area but are in a rush and don't have time to sit down and enjoy a meal- call them about 15 minutes before you can come in and place a to go order, your food will be waiting for you and you can merrily go on with your day. Iguana saved me from plenty of bad lunch option days at UIC.",0.9929,0.823,0.139,0.038,0.4958912037037037

In my opinion, the portions were generous considering the price. My friend and I easily could've shared one dessert instead of getting two.  The service was fairly good although it took the waitress a little while to come to our table initially and then to take our checks at the end.

The table got a hummus plate to share and the hummus was really creamy so it was pretty good. I would recommend sharing this as an appetizer.  We also had the creamy caramel creations and the dulce de leche ice cream was what made it stand out. Really good crepe just wish there was more ice cream dab on top.

I had a delicious cappuccino and chocolate cake. My friend had the bougatsa, which was a nice, different option. Live music was a nice touch, enjoyable, but not so loud that you couldn't still hold a conversation. Service was good.

Anyways I had the bougatsa - I looked at the other reviews and thought I have a late night dessert. It was my first time, I had the genius idea to put Nutella on the ice cream one... Big mistake - it was too sweet.  But it was good for first time, it had its flaky crunchy texture on areas not drizzled by caramel or the Nutella and the creaminess and cool ice cream made the temperature hot dessert more enjoyable.  Atmosphere is comfortable to talk at night, the worker/busser always hussles to take away trash, and refill your water.  I was thankful it was opened conveniently for me to get a little dessert and figure some things out- thanks  If I ever come back from California - I'll try something else and give another rating. :)",0.98,0.824,0.163,0.013,0.48769841269841274

Unfortunately I had a pretty bad experience last Saturday with (I was told by the Manager, 'the Boss'). I hosted my b-day party, just like last year, at your coffee shop. First of, ""the Boss"" was very rude as soon as I walked in. I had around 20 guests, which was discussed in the beginning of the week. Nothing was properly organized. I was given attitude by the Boss when I asked to rearrange the tables a bit so it can accommodate my guests, and we are not all sitting waching eachothers backs. He was very rude and didn't help at all. We all witnessed his unprofessional behavior and decided only to stay since it was too late to go any other place with this large group of people. I didn't catch your name, since you never introduced yourself to me. I was very surprised when I was told this guy who just walked up to me and started giving me attitude was actually the Boss. If you are dealing with people, especially guests that bring you business, change your attitude and learn how to respect. I read/heard other negative comments about Iguana and staff attitude.

Very European ambiance in that you'll see tables having coffee and/or wine and/or beer...all mixed instead of the usual segregation of coffee & booze you see in this country. Anything baked in the clay bowls is delicious but I've unfortunately become severely addicted to the panini grilled wraps, specifically the Spicy Chicken Pepper Wrap...love that damn thing.

My friends and I split a sweet caramel crepe at the end of the meal, with ice cream on top. I can't say enough good things about it. Then I had to grab a train to the burbs and stopped our waitress and explained that it was pretty urgent to get my receipt and told her I needed to catch a train. She says ok, then turns around and asks another couple of tables if they wanted to order any food... Really?! I told you I needed the check. That was blatantly rude.

Plus, there's a good number of parking spots on both sides of the street...easy access!  Inside, Iguana Cafe boasts lofty plank ceilings, a small bar, plenty of tables/half booths, and free WiFi. I will note, however, the free WiFi was pretty spotty when I worked here for a few hours, so you may want a back up just in case. Other points of note... Service: Super on point, friendly and quick! The food came flying out of the kitchen and my water was always kept full.  Food: My Berlin crepe (turkey, provolone cheese, tomatoes & cucumber) was flavorful and just the right texture, especially when I subbed gouda for provolone. I really enjoyed the sauce that came on the side, too.  Ambiance: Background music was a little loud near the front windows, so if you have really concentrated work to get through, this may not be the spot for you.  Price: Just right, especially for the sizable crepe I was served. One thing I was surprised about, though, was that I had to pay for a refill for my iced tea/lemonade combo. A bit odd, IMO...

This is my favorite go-to stop! It is perfect for after dinners or a movie, especially because it is open late on the weekends! The workers don't mind if you are sitting there for hours with a coffee, or keep ordering deserts! They don't push you out like other cafes if you are trying to relax and have a conversation with friends. This is a great location, not too busy, and with parking easily available.

We were also allowed to come in early and decorate the back area and the best part was that the restaurant cleaned up the mess for us.  I really like this place and have never had bad food here.

After 5 minutes of waiting in the restaurant, I started to take glances at the staff which eventually had to result in long, awkward stares. It was apparent they didn't get the clue that they should at least say something. How about something as simple or casual as ""Sorry, we'll get you a seat as fast as we can get one"" or making a commonly used wait list.  It seems like they lacked a hostess, a manager, a second wait staff and a couple of busers.  I attribute this lack of restaurant sensibility to be the fault of the manager and owner. Can the entire front of the house be run with a quiet bartender and a quiet waitress who only see their job as quietly minding the task immediately in front of them? No that's just a cheap solution that cuts down payroll and lack of training.  If you expect restaurants to understand customer sensibility, don't expect to find that here. If the manager or owner does not care to be there, it's also a bad sign.",-0.9096,0.846,0.044,0.11,0.5419091710758377

I  also tried their hummus which was decent,  but came with plenty to share.   the bad part is that  the  service was terrible. our  waitress was incredibly rude and short to the point that none if us wanted to tip her. of course she added in her  mandatory  gratuity.  (why be courteous if you know your tip already is included seems to be the assumption under which she was working) There is apparently, a $3  charge for sitting and not ordering (ostensibly  because you take up the space a paying  patron could have used,  but since we took up most of the restaurant,  you would  think  they'd give us a break on  the 2  people  out of 30 who didn't order food.  incidentally, they refused to order food because they find the waitress  so disagreeable).     before we ordered we asked about how to pay. when we took the bill to the bar,  the  manager told us to use the ATM  because running three cards at our 8-top was going to be too  difficult. we refused  because the waitress  told us we could use as many cards as  we  wanted. his  answer: "" well, you're going to have to wait.""   I'm sure they were stressed out about having a full restaurant, but I'm thinking, given the great reviews the place has  gotten, they've had a full house before. the service was atrocious.  the food may have been great, but I don't know if I'll ever suggest  out of towners  to  come here again. they  came off with a  bad  impression of the city after eating (or not eating) here.",0.404,0.816,0.099,0.085,0.587804232804233

I wouldn't recommend this place for a first date or families with kids, but overall it's a pretty cool place to go!",0.9679,0.839,0.145,0.017,0.4079365079365078

It may technically be just outside the River North boundary but is only a ~15min walk from most of River North.  Iguana Cafe is a great place to go to at anytime of the day or night (it's open late) and enjoy a coffee, meal or drink without it costing you a fortune or having to deal with a pretentious River North establishment. The atmosphere does feel European and it is probably something to do with some of the European (I think) staff and concept of a cafe in general. The service is prompt and staff is very friendly. Parking is easy to find if you choose to drive and the Blue Line el stop is a minute away. The menu is varied and includes items ranging from great crepes (savory as well as dessert), sandwiches, pasta, meat and cheese plates along with plenty of beverage options from coffees, teas, wines and a full bar.  My favorites are the Chocolate Monkey (crepe with nutella, banana and vanilla ice cream), Pikilia (assortment of cheeses, meats, breads and spreads) and some of the savory crepes. I havent had a chance to try the sandwiches and pastas, but I've heard good things about them.",0.9895,0.807,0.172,0.02,0.4666666666666667

2012-07-09,4.0,"Warm, soft and fluffy. This is not a pillow commercial. I was describing Iguana Cafe's crepes.  Generally, I am very skeptical about having crepes in America because it tends to be either too sweet or too salty. However, Iguana's crepe's seasoning is just right. Today I had a crepe with baked zucchini, sauteed spinach and mushroom. The zucchini's slight crunchiness contrasts well with the soft crepes. The dried tomato also complexes the flavor of the crepe. However, the spinach is overcooked and slightly too dry.  Although I do not live in this neighborhood, I would consider coming back. My friend and I like the fact that the tables are more spread out than most cafes, so we could have a long girls' talk. It also seems to be a nice place to study or work alone.  P.S. I came into the cafe with a Starbucks coffee, since I did not plan to come to a cafe for dinner. The host offered to exchange my cup with an Iguana's cup. Iguana's coffee lid is well sealed and would prevent me spilling coffee when I am in a hurry to work.  Food: 3 Decor: 4 Service: 4",0.9023,0.877,0.099,0.024,0.4720551378446115

Read some reviews about slow, inattentive service which put me off trying this place for a while.  But it's walking distance so curiosity and convenience finally got the best of me. The good news is that the slow service must be an evening thing.  We went in for lunch and even though it was crowded, we didn't have to wait, and the waitress and the busboys were very friendly and attentive.   We tried a number of items (salad, appetizers, etc.), but crepes are clearly what people come here for, and after trying the rest I'd suggest sticking with the crepes.  Be prepared for some serious volume.  Even though Iguana bills itself as a European style cafe, I can't ever recall getting venti-sized portions like this in any of my European voyages.   The savory crepes come with a tomato slice as your only side.  It's not terrible, but it makes the plate look somehow unbalanced and incomplete.  Some potatoes or greens might be a better side for turning a crepe into a full savory meal.

There are benches for those waiting to be seated and a small water fountain to entertain you for the time being.  When we were finally seated, we were welcomed with five chairs and two mini tables combined. It wasn't too shabby. We were promptly given menus and glasses of water. It wasn't long before we proceeded to ordering: cheesy crab dip, Napolitan pasta, three orders of crepe, two orders of waffles, and one bagel sandwich.  The cheesy crab dip are a must-order. It was rich with ingredients and were perfectly complimented with the toasted pita bread. The Napolitan pasta was also memorable. I love my pastas baked but it was too filling to finish it in one round so we took the leftovers to go.  The crepes were average and I do not recommend the chocolate monkey. It was all sorts of sweetness and the chocolate came spilling out creating a huge mess. I love my sweets but I think this topped it by a few notches. It also came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but it melted before I even got a good look at it. The waffles were ginormous and the vanilla ice cream scoop stayed intact even though we didn't dig in until some 15 minutes later.  We shared eight plates and it came to approximately $10-15 per person. Most of our dishes were $6-$9 each. Prices are very reasonable and the menu is very expansive.

Food arrived extremely bland, dry, and otherwise unimpressive. The coffee, which was billed on the menu as being of such a high quality that they couldn't offer free refills, was utterly mediocre.  The service was good and the prices reasonable, but the quality of the food didn't inspire me to go back and try the crepes I've heard so much about.

OK, perhaps the booze isn't necessary (and surely it shouldn't be, considering I'm supposed to be working! ...Mimosas never hurt a thesis, right?), but this place truly is fabulous. Clientele range from new mothers to graduate students, aging couples and first dates, and it seems as though we're all quite comfortable. The ambiance is top notch-- I'm a sucker for fireplaces and holiday decorations-- and when it's not the holiday season, the high-beam ceilings and palm trees create a very relaxing atmosphere. Plus, it's an atmosphere you can enjoy late into the night with such closing hours. The only reason I can't give Iguana Cafe is the fact that the internet is not free. I didn't think they did that anywhere but airports nowadays-- and only the really annoying airports that frequently delay flights and don't offer beer. $8 for 24 hours, or $6 for three and .10 per minute after.  But don't let that keep you from Iguana Cafe. The well-priced and totally delicious food should make up for it. Try the goat cheese dip; I keep asking for more pita pieces, just to get the last few bits! I'd be annoyed by me at this point, but that's another plus-- fantastic servers equipped with patience and friendliness for a gal six hours into her workday!  And yes, the crepes ARE that good.

You see, I am the world's most unlucky person. Tonight my iPhone was stolen by the bitchy guy wearing more eyeliner than I do (quite the feat) behind me at a Florence and the Machine concert who asked me to sit down bc I was blocking he and his lady friend's view. I refused... as I paid more than the ticket price and if I want to stand and show my support for arguably one of the most talented voices to make it to mainstream today, by George, I'm going to do just that. And if you're not willing to stand for an artist that's one thing (you being lame), but personally, I'll be damned if I'm feeling a jam and I'm not going to get up, stand up+stand for my right.  So Bitchy Man had a problem with this and somewhere along the lines stole my iPhone from my back pocket. F to the M to the L. Keep in mind this is also the same week I got not one, but 2 flat tires 6 days apart and 2 speeding tickets within the last month, one of which was for going 2 miles over the speed limit.  Why does it always rain on me?  Anyway, the Chai here came up fast as f*ck. Like, I swear I had ordered the damn thing *maybe* 35 seconds before it arrived.

I like this place? Is that a question or a statement? I'm not entirely sure... it's not exactly memorable, but on the other hand it's exceptionally inoffensive. Good food offered at reasonable prices in a laid back environment makes me a fan. This is where I end up sometimes when I try to walk home from work and get distracted by how much easier it is to just sit at a table and have someone else do the hunting and gathering. Presumably Iguana follows a European tradition of hybrid restaurant/coffeeshop/bar/art gallery settings, and this spot seems to draw a rambling mix of dates, mellow girls' night outs, convening writers, and lone wolves romancing their laptops. The place is too dark to be a café but it's not too dark to read; it's too laid back to be a restaurant but the food's pretty good. I can't for the life of me recall the true breadth of the sprawling menu here, because I'm consistently drawn to their unique and interesting selection of crepes combining ingredients like sautéed mushrooms, spinach, various pigs and cheeses under identities like Prague, Budapest, Lisbon. The beer list spans the ""worst of"" international exports- Heineken, Becks, Stella Artois, Corona, etc... those foreign lands can keep their damn second rate beers. With half a dozen white wines and another half dozen red wines, I tend to settle on the tasty Reisling. The only thing I don't really like about this place is the music, which is probably a reflection on modern Euro pop and electronic trends. I hate that. ""Try not to be such a hater, Rob R.""

On their website they advertise themselves as a European style coffeehouse where one is welcome, whether they want to dine or just have coffee (and, in fact, refer to themselves as a ""coffeehouse""  on their sign which usually indicates a more leisurely atmosphere). However, when I went there, the waitress was extremely rude as soon as she found out that my husband and I only wanted espresso beverages. First, she gave the disgruntled ""is that it?"" response then snidely, taking the menus away, said ""well, I guess you won't be needing these."" We drank our coffee as quickly as possible, though we had to expend a great amount of effort to get her to come by our table for the check, and what little she said was with a rather snide tone. It was very clear that we weren't welcome there. We weren't dressed inappropriately, nor was it crowded (only about 1/3 of the tables were taken) so I can only assume the attitude was based on the fact that we, encouraged by their website, had chosen this place to have coffee rather than dinner.  Additionally, the atmosphere seemed more like a European hotel restaurant than a European coffeehouse. While I've never been to Greece (where the owner is from) I have been to Rome, Naples, Berlin, Munich, Heidelberg, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Paris and London. The cafe didn't resemble any of the cafes I visited there. There was a big screen television, for one thing. For another thing, my cappuccino tasted more like something one would expect from a corporate coffee joint like Starbucks than the Illy and Lavazza fare one typically finds in Europe.  I just moved into the neighborhood, and frequently go out, not just for coffee but for lunch and dinner. I'm a bit of creature of habit, so once I find a place I like, I tend to stick with it.

This Sunday I thought it would be a good idea to drop in. My girl had never been here so that gave me an incentive to take her to this ""European cafe"". We saw the cakes @ the front register so we automatically knew what we wanted. We both went with the Tiramisu, but I got a peppermint tea and she got a white mocha latte. The tiramisu was delicious and my peppermint tea was very soothing. I had a sip of her coffee and it was good as well. Prices here are pretty reasonable. I forgot how much I liked this place, but what I did not appreciate was the slow service. We waited awhile before anyone took our order...The people that came in before us had their order taken before us. By the time someone finally had shown up to take our order, someone else came shortly afterwards to take our order as well.

The sauce was pretty good (even though it needed a little salt and pepper), but the chicken was awful. Dry, stringy and ick.  I didn't give up vegetarianism for crap food like this!

Also, I had a bad experience in regards to their hours.  I'm used to a laid back approach to Coffeehouses, where if they are open late they generally let customers slowly make their way out of the store.  When I was there with a friend, they pretty much tried to kick us out 30 mins before closing time!  If you are going to make a chill late night hangout spot that isn't a bar, let people linger a bit and enjoy it as much as possible.  (I'm totally spoiled by the Highland back in Cincinnati, as far as Chicago coffeehouses go, this is one of the best).",0.9742,0.823,0.146,0.032,0.5448866213151926

It's a very Midwestern thing to have a happy-go-lucky, cheerful, and gregarious wait staff.  Only in Chicago and Milwaukee (empirically speaking) is NICE expected of a waiter/ress.  Europe & the UK (empirically - London, Oxford, Paris, Prague, Athens, Madrid, and Barcelona. Exception: Ireland) does not regard ""warm and fuzzy"" as a necessity in waiters/resses.  In the US, we have evidence of this too - talk to most anyone who's just returned from a NY, trip.  Did s/he compain about the service?  Unless s/he had wads of money to spend at 5 star joints, I bet restaurant-service complaints were had. In Chicago we like things a little soft and a little warm.  But, we also like fairness and quality.  At Iguana, you get fair prices and high quality.  Enjoy the atmosphere.  Don't take it personally if the waiter/ress has a bit of a 'tude.  Treat it like a anthropological experience.  You'll enjoy yourself.  I promise.",0.9676,0.838,0.127,0.035,0.505

Plus, the icing on the cake: they're all really reasonably priced. I've been here both with friends and on a date, and the ambience is always appropriate. Iguana's atmosphere is reminiscent of West Mexico (Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan) with a ""spring breaky"" bar feel...and yet, it's simultaneously a hip European cafe where it's perfectly acceptable to sip away on a giant cappucino.

The menu was boring except for the crepes which I guess is there specialty.  This was kind of weird since it's a turkish coffee house.  Anyway, I didn't have the crepes so I can't comment on them.  However, I was expecting some sort of brunch or breakfast menu but found only egg sandwiches made on either a croissant or bagel.  I chose to have the ham scrambled egg sandwich on an everything bagel.  I expected to receive actual scrambled eggs with ham but instead received a McDonald's style egg patty with a slice of deli ham.   I also ordered the fruit salad which was huge and well worth the money.  It came in a huge bowl with strawberries, bananas, pears, apples and red grapes.  The coffee was also good.  I don't think I'll go back unless I have a taste for crepes.",0.8945,0.866,0.095,0.039,0.55

My only con is that the caged iguana really weirds me out.  He acts like he wants to get out and kill us all, but whatever- he can't.  I have to imagine that animal rights people would also probably have a few not-so-kind things to say about his existence there.  He seems pretty cooped up.

The one thing I always didn't like about Iguana though is that it takes awhile to get and pay your bill.  Theirs normally one server for about 16 tables; so, when it's ""bill time"" your usually waiting a few minutes.  If you have time it's no problem.  If you need to be in and out, I suggest you ask for the bill after you order, or get your food.  You can also ask for the bill and just walk to the register and pay, they'll take care of ya.   Other than the paying thing, I love it.  Foods goods, waitresses are nice and are good (just a little busy at times), and it's clean.  Great hangout.",0.9887,0.762,0.183,0.055,0.5052083333333333

I went with the veggie oven-baked omelette. The server will tell you that it's a 25 min wait for the oven-baked omelette. I was starving by the time it arrived but holy crap, it was worth the wait.

There are two reasons why Iguana doesn't get higher marks for me despite it's very low prices and high-quality beverages and food.  One, the place is cramped.  Tables are placed so very close together that sometimes I feel as if I am eating together with the people sitting next to me (so wait to hold your private conversations elsewhere).

Toasted bagel, semi-melty cream cheese, long slices of crispy cucumber and fresh, raw salmon. Delightful. It rescued my haphazard morning.  Coffee: LARGE, and in a real mug. Thank you, heaven. Real cream that billows (the sign of freshness, so I'm told). Splenda. Recipe for success.  Lunch (told you I was here for a long time!) was a caesar salad with chicken, which was large, with fresh chix chunks, fresh cheese and toasty croutons, with a side of dressing. Really fresh and tasty...$6.25.  Really, the food is an outstanding value for what it is. Great service, laid back Euro coffeehouse feel.  NO FREE WIFI. (it is available, you just have to pay).

I felt right at home at Iguana Cafe. The only things that gave away the fact that I wasn't back home in the sticks; the waitress had a nice European accent when she called me ""hun, baby, sweetheart"", There were crepes on the list instead of grits, you could get your coffee spiked with something other than the flask of Jack Daniels that you carried in.

As I just said the menu is strange, but very large so it seems as if there would be something for everyone. It ranges from salads & soups to crepes. Trust me, everything sounded delish! I ended up with the hummus wrap, which was unreal. It was the perfect mixture of red pepper hummus, feta cheese, and tomatoes. Oh my Lord, I'm drooling...thank goodness no one else in the office!

Therefore, I feel like I can comprehensively assess its highs, its lows and its competencies. 1) The food could have a bit more range- it all boils down to just sandwiches, salads and pasta, viewed more or less through a Mediterranean lens. I really enjoy the vegetarian sandwiches, and the potato salad is weirdly good.* The pasta is great --really great-- but comes baked in huge portions and covered with cheese. Poison.   2) The drinks are delicious and they always serve you in a big ceramic mug, so as to say, ""Stay a while, stranger."" 3) This is the best place to bring a country mouse who would like to experience a bit of your city mouse life. The Iguana Cafe is supposed to be European, and it feels thusly, to a degree. It is really quite beautiful and relaxing on the inside and very rarely overcrowded. The clientele tends to be attractive and lead mysterious lives of intrigue. You too can be part of that mystery.

They're open late on the weekends, almost 2, I think, but check that.  On the weekends it's almost a lounge with the music they play.  Some mild house and electronic stuff, but not too loud so you can talk.  Thing is, so many people will come to hang out, it actually can get pretty loud on the weekend. If you're not feeling the club or bar vibe on the weekend, go here with some friends, or even by yourself.  Bring a book, your laptop (WiFi not free, sorry) or some work, I don't know.  I've done that, and found myself people watching, and the place getting pretty busy. Food is okay cafe fare.  Coffee and drinks are the same as any other place, nothing outstanding, but not bad at all - and they have alcohol, so this place really is a great spot for a lot of things.  Also a good place to go during the day for business coffee, a date, meet a friend halfway in the middle of the loop for a chat, whatever.

2007-09-15,5.0,"I found this place in 2005 when visiting a friend in the neighborhood.  He's since moved away and I've since moved to the neighborhood.  The one thing that remains constant is Iguana.  It's my kitchen away from home.  I can go at all hours of the day and get just what my stomach desires in a relaxed, very friendly atmosphere. While I don't work here, I might as well.  I've been known to eat here several times a week when I'm not traveling.  I have to have been here over 50 times in 2007 and I can honestly say I've never been disappointed once.  That speaks volumes given all of the choices here in Chicago. So here are the particulars: AMBIANCE:  This is a very cool space.  The exposed brick pulls the whole thing together and reinforces the European coffee house vibe.  Not too bright and not too dark.  One thing I will mention is it really is several restaurants in one. If you come for breakfast or lunch during the week you'll find folks who work in the neighborhood who want good food quickly.  If you come at night you'll find the candles on the table and find people lingering over coffee or wine.  If you come on the weekend you'll find the big weekend paper and lots of coffee crowd.  So if you come and the atmosphere isn't quite your cup of tea, give Iguana a try at another time of day. Also, the place is very international and you'll find people speaking all kinds of languages.  The owners are Greek (hence some of the food) and the servers are from all over.  Having traveled as much as I have, I find that to be a real 'plus'. The only possible drawback in this category is the smoking.  It's really not that bad, but I'm not used to smelling like smoke anymore when I go eat anywhere.  (It's technically a bar and smoking is still allowed).  This is really a moot point as the new Illinois state law takes place on January 1. SERVICE:  I have always found the service to be efficient.  If you want to chat them up, they're happy to chat back.  However, their primary concern is that you sit back and relax in their 'living room'.  Get comfortable.  If you do, you'll be back again and again. FOOD:  The food really is the star here.  I've tried many, many things on the menu and have never been disappointed.  The quality is always very good.  The breads and the deserts are worth special mention for their freshness and quality.  If you like Greek and or Mediterranean food, those are always a good bet.  There are also plenty of things on the menu for the Vegetarians among us. It is a coffeehouse, after all, and the coffee is quite solid and the range of coffee drinks quite extensive.  There is also a full bar and a very nice selection of wines by the glass that changes now and again.  My current favorite is the organic Malbec.  At $7 a glass, this is a nice value. So, I strongly encourage you to give Iguana a try.  Take some friends and while away the time amidst the great coffee and fine food.  Or, go alone and be prepared to meet some of the most interesting people in Chicago.  Either way, be prepared to get comfortable.  If you do, I know you'll be back.",0.9987,0.813,0.181,0.006,0.4605118646785314

2006-08-27,3.0,"While the sandwiches are tasty and the coffee decent, watch out for the salads.  Every time I have ordered them (to go, btw) the greens have been old and slimy.  This problem has been going on for over the past year.  I wish they would purchase fresher produce.    Nice atmosphere.  The servers can be a bit snooty at times.  Wish they were a bit more friendly.",0.8399,0.798,0.164,0.038,0.5194444444444445
2006-05-31,4.0,"Such a delightful cafe, with a reasonably priced menu. Delicious spinach and artichoke dip (although it's hard to go wrong ) and good mocha frappes. Salads leave a little to be desired. The wait staff are friendly and helpful; I was reading there once and a waiter asked if I would like some better light, and promptly rearranged for me. Great Europeanesque atmosphere that includes a live iguana and red telephone booth. Only real downside is the pounding techno beat that makes intimate conversation and concentration a bit difficult.",0.9614,0.635,0.267,0.098,0.6384259259259261

2006-04-25,4.0,"If want good quality food (european cafe-type fare), at great prices, a cozy setting, and friendly servers, then check out Iguana Cafe.  The salads/paninis/crepes are great, and they also serve wine/coffee, etc, if you just want to sit and sip on something. A good place to bring your work/sit alone, but also a very nice spot to dine with a friend or two.  They're open pretty late (1am, i think), so there's no need to wrap up that conversation/finish that paragraph too quickly.",0.9608,0.681,0.27,0.049,0.6291666666666667
2006-04-23,5.0,"I went to Iguana with QJ and our Greek for dinner last night and I loooove this place.  It's perfect for lunch, dinner, or anything inbetween and their paninis and crepes are all tasty.  It has a great European feel to it, and it would be wonderful if they had patio space in the front for summertime. They have a nice wine selection in addition to coffees and other cafe drinks. I think I could live at the Iguana...I can see myself sitting in there for endless hours working on my stupid thesis....Then taking off my librarian sweater and letting my bun down to switch into night mode to enjoy dinner and a round of drinks with my crew.",0.9337,0.835,0.138,0.027,0.5450396825396825
2006-04-19,5.0,"My Greek brought me home some leftovers last week and I was craving them since.  Last nite we met there and had a chicken, tomato and provolone crepe, some tomato and mozz salad and the carrot cake is perfect.  From the bar section, to the coffee station, yummy all the way around, and I mean that. Seriously devine.  (and ya gotta love servers with accents) EDIT 3/31/07 I saw the yelp sticker on the door when i came in the other day. I love it here, my son loves it here, my friends love it here.  The servers are NOT snooty.  Just that hey're not from the South and wont ""y'all"" you on the way out the door.   If you cant handle the service here, you're just not cool. The food is still awesome as when I found it, and I still love coming here - even after having everything on the menu.",0.9874,0.776,0.203,0.021,0.5616071428571427
2005-12-12,3.0,"Cozy, yet spacious, the Iguana Cafe is an easy crowd pleaser that appeals to the studious, the artsy, and the girls or guys who just want to chit chat.    My only peeve is the smoking in combo w/ the lack of ventilation, but that's Chicago for ya.  The panini sandwiches are abso-freakin-lutely scrumptous.  My favorites include the meatloaf and the Italian - a perfect combination of provolone, oregano, olive oil, prosciutto, and nice crusty bread.  Don't forget to grab a brownie (a la mode, of course) and at that point, you will promise yourself to try a crepe next time.",0.9623,0.784,0.201,0.015,0.6547619047619049
