2017-08-31,1.0,"To say I am disappointed would be an incredible understatement.  For starters, we ate at the ""treehouse"" or top floor of the restaurant.  Our table was sort of awkwardly located in between the bar and an open social area for a private event, and seemed totally out of place. There were people walking back and forth around us the whole night, which hardly provided a comfortable experience.  As for the food... I ordered the Bookmaker Steak Sandwich, which I took to be a signature item of the Tavern at the Park.  The menu should be reworded to state that the main ingredient is the butter! The bottom of my bun was so soggy in grease and butter that it fell apart after my first bite into the sandwich.  In fact, all I could taste in that bite was the butter. I decided to try eating the cuts of streak from the sandwich alone without the butter-soaked bun, but was unsuccessful even in that as the steak was soaked in the stuff. Gross!! Finally, I found our waiter to be rude.  He always seemed like he had somewhere better to be rather than taking our order, and never came to check up on the food after it came out of the kitchen.  Considering the location and price of the food (a $25 dollar sandwich!), I expected MUCH better from the Tavern at the Park.  I will neither return nor recommend this restaurant to a friend.",0.6922,0.844,0.085,0.071,0.5125

2017-08-29,4.0,"Have you ever had food so good that it makes you dance? Well visit Tavern at the Park and you will be dancing in the streets. This place is so good that I ate here for lunch and dinner.  For lunch, I had the chicken pot pie. This is not your typical Stouffer's or Marie Calendar pie. Imagine fresh vegetables with huge chicken chunks in a crispy butter crust. It's so massive that it can feed 2 people.  For dinner, I started with a beet salad. The presentation alone was  remarkable. Stacked 6 levels high with assorted roasted beets and creamy filled cheese in between each layer. Served with mixed greens and walnuts then topped with a vinaigrette. It was appealing on the eye and to the stomach.  Since I still was full from the pot pie, I added sweet potato fries to my beet salad. You know veggies and carbs balance out a healthy meal! The fries were served with ketchup and maple honey aioli. I need the maple honey aioli recipe ASAP.  My dessert was a cold brew but I felt like I had went to heaven. This place is a good non-touristy tavern for those near Millennial Park or those that work nearby. On a good day, you could sit outside on the patio or venture to the rooftop to see the city.

The lady who I assumed was the manager since she was instructing the hostess asked if we had reservations and we said no so she she took our names and instructed us to have a seat. We waited 10 minutes with no one in there while she talked to the training hostess and then watched her seat a table who had a reservation. Normally it wouldnt have been a big deal since we had no reservations but it was EMPTY. Not one customer there. You couldn't at least sit us at the bar??? Like come on. She didn't even offer it. Super bad customer service. She wasn't even nice about and seemed irritated that we were outside waiting for it to open. The only reason we waited 3 min for them to open was because one of their employees told us to wait and he would let us in as soon as it was 11.

2017-08-10,3.0,"Ate lunch here a couple days ago. Mediocre service but great food!  Took a good amount of time to even be greeted by a server. When we finally were, she took our drink order and disappeared for a good 10-15 minutes despite there being only one other table in the dining room we were in. Our drinks were just sitting at the bar, no other servers would even run out drinks. I work in the industry, so I'm usually really understanding to servers but this girl was gone forever. Finally the manager came over and asked if he could help us with anything. I felt bad getting our server in trouble but we have the girl a good amount of time before complaining! The manager was very nice, super helpful. Took our order and answered questions about the menu. I ordered the steak sandwich and it was amazing. One of the best meals I've had lately. My mom and sister both got soups (chicken matzo and French onion) and were practically licking the bowls they enjoyed it so much. We split sweet potato fries, they were great and they came with especially good ranch.  When our server finally came back after the manager took our order she just silently filled up our water and left. No apology, no asking if we needed anything else. Like I said, I work industry. Muster up an honest apology or quick excuse, put on a smile and see if there's anything else you can do. It sucks but be nice and move on. She also proceeded to tech across our table and change the specials menu, it was just kind of odd and rude and should've just been done after we left.  This would have been an easy 5 stars if it wasn't for our glaringly bad service. Greet food all around and not a bad price for quality and location.",0.9952,0.666,0.231,0.103,0.5892857142857143

The décor was nice and people were casually dressed. I noticed floor managers were very attentive and walked the floors frequently. It was Friday evening and nicely packed.  We started off with the Crab Cake which was VERY good. It is served with a pickled slaw and light sauce which just adds to the overall experience. Just the right bite of soft and crunchy. You can tell it was mostly crab and less filling. The flavors were off the chain! We agreed that is very close to the cakes cooked at Michael Jordan's Restaurant, which are the best that I've ever had!  For the entre, my wife had the Lobster Ravioli and I had the Roasted Scottish Salmon. We shared the parmesan broccoli.  The freakin ravioli was EXCELLENT!!!... Just the right mix of sauce and ratio of pasta to filling. It was incredibly light. The saffron in the cream sauce came through ever so slightly. We BOTH agreed it was superstar!... The salmon was served on top of wasabi mashed potatoes which was surrounded by a tomato jus. The mashed potatoes WERE EXCELLENT!!!. Especially mixed with the sauce... Ohhh MYYY!!!... The fish was well cooked, but over-seasoned on some portions of the fish. I couldn't finish the whole thing due to the salt levels. Certain portions were totally un-edible, which was very disappointing!!!... The crispy leeks served on top of the fish was a miss. Although a nice contrast (crunchy) many of the pieces you couldn't eat!.  We finished everything with their pumpkin ice cream. My wife liked it, I didn't. Just something about pumpkin I can't get with. But hey... she enjoyed it, in fact almost finished the whole thing. Overall the food and experience was good.

Towards evening we decided to stop in to one of local places for dinner. I had never been tavern on the park but it looked very nice.

Tons of sugar and hardly any tequila. The 13$ glass of Chardonnay was awful and tasted watered down. My 5 lobster ravioli for 33$ were not big homemade ones. Regular size ones and again Costco quality drowned in sauce. Some small pieces of lobster on top along with sun dried tomatoes that took over any lobster taste there was. My wife ordered the chicken.

It was put at the wrong end of the table and some members of the group started eating it without knowing. It was then passed our way and my boyfriend brought it to the attention of the wait staff. We said it was fine but the staff should know they did wrong. They insisted on bringing us another order when we explicitly said no to several waiters. To further embarrass us, they brought it anyways and again, gave it to the wrong people forcing us to explain and involve more people in this annoying situation. Before dinner, twice someone tried to take my wine glass and I told them I was expecting wine. It was like fending people off for my glass. Lastly, when I went to have my leftovers this morning, most of my meal was missing. I had a sandwich and almost full plate of fries and no fries were in the container. I usually ask to full my own container because I don't like people touching my food. But they took it away before I even had a chance to stop them. Then the fries that I paid for were not even there. On top of everything the food was only mediocre. Not worth $19 for a sandwich. In such a high profile and expensive place, I expect a might higher degree of service.

Thinking that maybe it wouldn't be top quality because it's basically in touristville but it looked nice and we wanted to sit outdoors so we went for it. Since it was nice out and the freaken weekend, we opted for an alcoholic beverage. Nothin like a nice glass of champagne for a late brunch. When it arrived, his was bubbling like crazy, while mine was almost flat. We asked the server if she could check to see if mine was poured out of an old bottle. She came back with a new glass, claiming they came out of the very same, newly opened bottle. [insert eye roll] I ordered a salad. He order the lobster roll. We got calamari to start.  The calamari tasted like typically greasy calamari that you'd get at a pub or cheap restaurant, but hey, it wasn't the worse. My salad was decent. I've had fresher from a salad bar, but it did the trick. My bf's lobster roll was laughable, to say the least. It looked like a tiniest bit of seafood salad on a lame looking hot dog bun.

I asked her why- I can't help that I have an allergic reaction. She then told me ""it cost the company more money"" why would it cost them more to give me potatoes with my burger instead of fries cooked in fish grease. At that point I told her leave off the side and I will just have a burger instead because I was not going to pay extra for replacing something.

Most people were dining as couples and they were dressed business casually. We came in like a storm as those who I was accompanying just finished skating at Millennium Park. We were civil and could be respectful but this was not the lunch we were originally planning for. I am never a burger guy but I always find myself ordering burgers. I think eating burgers is an American thing. So every time I go to a new place I usually have the staple burger which is normally named ""[Enter Restaurant Name] Burger"". I had the Great Chicago Fire Burger which is a unique name and ended up being a phenomenal burger. I would recommend and would order again. TATP treated us kindly and didn't put us out. The service was friendly and they wished us the best as we left on our merrily way.",0.9923,0.814,0.169,0.017,0.5008176593521422

2016-03-14,2.0,"Service:  Let me start off by saying there is great service, especially in our case where we had a man who cracked great timing jokes. For example, when My sister and I said we were fine with water he warned, ""Okay but be careful girls, the water is wet."" Later he said "" Don't worry, If you can't finish the food, I'll pull up a chair and help you out."" He had great humor and was also informative on the menu. Wouldn't be the same experience without him (although I do wish I could remember his name) App: i just had to say that I enjoyed the bread basket which included a flat bread, rye, and pan bianco. Love how there are options and it how it looks with the blue glasses and water serving glass.  Food: I guess it is my fault for ordering something I had doubts on, but I ordered the hungry hungry hippie burger. I'm already not a huge fan of veggie burgers, but I had high hopes for a lentil and quinoa burger.However what i received was basically just a mess covered in cheese with basic loose leaf lettuce, slice of tomato, and onion addressed as a ""full garden garnish""  Not only were the aesthetics lacking, but also the bun of the burger was way out of proportion that I couldn't bite into it and had to cut through leaving the top bun off.  I was sadly disappointed with lunch but ate it anyway with sub par fries for $16. However it was just me, because the rest of my family seemed fine with the rest of their meal with the shrimp salad, goat cheese salad, and the turkey burger. On the other hand, we all seemed to see that the portions were a bit too big since none of us could finish our meals.  Atmosphere: No complaints, just that I wish we were in time to sit outside on a great day. Also I would like to add that there was a great playlist being played throughout the restaurant was very entertaining.  Prices: I guess its reasonable but i personally felt like burgers were overpriced.  Conclusion: definitely not my favorite place, hung on by service, atmosphere, and accessibility to our restaurant the Fairmont Hotel.

The atmosphere is upscale, classy pub. The servers were attentive and knowledgeable. Price is a touch higher compared to loop area restaurants, but not undeserved.   Let's get to it...the food.  I had the Blackhawk Special named for the local professional hockey team. This filet comes out sizzling in a cast iron pan. Have you ever been in a Mexican restaurant when someone orders fajitas? Yeah, just like that. This amazing steak is drenched in garlic butter and tastes incredible. Seriously. Now, do note that no sides come with - I added the mashed potatoes and they were a great accompaniment.   The wife was craving 'pub grub' and went with a Guinness and the chopped steak burger. Very well sized and she only finished half. She rates it a very solid hamburger that finished well.  On to dessert and likely the weakest part of the evening. We tried the bread pudding and it was average - dry, mild flavor, and the sauce was unimpressive. A crème anglaise dressing would have been much better. Not a deal breaker and we will certainly try the others at the next visit. Is sum, a fantastic restaurant with good atmosphere and great food and drink.

My party of 8 had made a reservation to sit inside the hotel, and we had the concierge at our hotel confirm that we could sit on the rooftop bar. We had to leverage the concierge because when calling to make a reservation you can only reserve for inside the restaurant; they ""don't take reservations for the rooftop"".  That policy is such a sham. We came up to the separate entrance to reach the roof top and were told we had a party of 8 confirmed by our concierge and the hostess was so unbelievably rude. The visible eye rolling, demeaning tone, and continually telling us she can't seat us because they don't take reservations was the worst service I have ever seen. Even though she was checking her list of names (why check names, if you supposedly don't take reservations). She told us we have to go inside, since a table for 8 wouldn't be available for another hour.. We went inside and informed the other host how rude the lady was and how we had a confirmation for roof top seating. They called upstairs and said miraculously a table was just clearing out, and we could sit there. Ironic, we were just supposed to wait an hour, yet now we got moved back up immediately. We got up there, and were there for over 2 hours, and tables were never completely full. Ridiculous they had to tell us that. Other service issues, the bar downstairs would not serve my friend alcohol because she had a Chinese citizenship ID, but their book only shows Chinese driver's licenses. But when we went upstairs, we showed the server her ID, and said look this up on google, it is valid, and he finally served her a drink. The bar downstairs would not do this. We live in a modern day where the internet is at everyone's fingertips. Not everyone in China drives, so don't only accept Chinese driver's licenses because that's the only thing in your book for double checking. The food was actually really good, and the wait staff was extremely nice. It's a shame that both the host/hostess and bar left such an bitter experience of the restaurant.

2015-09-06,3.0,"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night; we made an OpenTable reservation but were informed by the hostess that reservations are not valid for the rooftop and that there was a wait to eat up there. We said that was fine and that we would just wait around the bar area and drink until a table was ready; ""No"", the hostess said, ""there is no room at the bar."" We must wait downstairs. Ok...so we waited maybe 20 minutes downstairs until a table was ready. As we enter the rooftop we were expecting it to be mobbed considering the hostess said there were no tables or room at the bar: the rooftop was EMPTY. There were open tables everywhere and the bar was half full. What?? This treatment made a poor first impression, but luckily the service and food the rest of the night made up for it. We had two cocktails that were unique, tasty, and decent pours. For food, the fig & prosciutto flatbread was delicious; highly recommended. Unfortunately, the braised short rib was not good; I have had a lot of short rib in the city and this was below average; it was too chewy and tough (short rib should be tender and rip apart easily; go to Pinstripes for an example of a good short rib); the small piece of polenta that came with it also was underwhelming; short rib should come with mashed potatoes in my opinion. We also had a side of mac 'n cheese which was tasty.  Overall, the rooftop really is beautiful; I recommend you go here for good food and drinks (although skip the short rib) and also be prepared to wait 20 minutes to be seated even if the rooftop is empty (I'm not sure what that was all about - let me know if you find out).",0.8452,0.795,0.111,0.093,0.5514236111111113

In this case the original sin was reaching over the table to pour water rather than coming around to the side of each person. So let's talk about the food. Our table had steak Diane, salmon, chicken and fish & chips. Since veggies were not part of the meal, a side of grilled asparagus provided the one not-buttery vegetable option.  All round the food was pretty good so I regret  the  experience was marred by the spilled drink episode.  But since eating out is an entertainment experience, it is not just about the food. It's theater and this was not one of Chicago's better productions. The table was soaked as was my companion as the water pouring from the carafe missed the water glass in the ensuing chaos. The server sprinted away to get help. That took 5 minutes for both server and manager to arrive to assess the situation. We asked for a different table.  Rather than just move us immediately to the adjacent 4-top, they disappeared to consult their computers. Now another 5 minutes later we were moved to the adjacent table. My companion is still wet and drying off with table napkins. We got the apology, one fresh drink and an offer of free dessert.  Free dessert? Well, thank you, but dessert was not on our agenda. What about an offer to clean the clothes or comp the injured individual's meal? Maybe a round of drinks to lighten the mood? Some gesture other than what we're not going to have. Nevertheless, when the meal ended and, well, maybe we might have dessert, no server or manager was around. Ultimately we got up and found a different server and requested they find our server. Check, please and we were gone. One of our party spent the next 4 hours with wet pants.  Pretty uncomfortable. Maybe an isolated case? Perhaps.

Although my first luncheon choice was not available, I happily ordered the Caesar salad with grilled salmon. The salad came, but the salmon did not. No problem. Kitchen mistakes happen. The waiter took the salad back to the kitchen and a few minutes later the manager returned with it.  In a restaurant known for large portions, I've never quite seen as small and thin and burnt shard of salmon in my life. So I asked the waiter if this was the standard portion. He said no; apologized and summoned the manager, who gave me a lecture on portion control. Then bashfully admitted that the piece of salmon was indeed small. And overcooked. He then half heartedly offered to get me another piece and discouragingly said ""but that would take some time.""  Instead he said I won't charge you the extra $9 for the salmon -- the small thin burnt piece of Inedible salmon.

And though our server was prompt and friendly, instead Of explaining the specials, he just pointed to the table tent that listed them. Oh well.

Perfectly cooked and seasoned, and was a thick 9 oz cut. So. Good! The ahi was extremely fresh and served with an edamame purée that I tried and really enjoyed.

Then again, it's right on Michigan, so walking inside shouldn't be a surprise to see despite the name of the restaurant. Service was pretty decent.",0.8825,0.829,0.149,0.021,0.5320317460317461

2015-05-05,4.0,"I have gone to Tavern at the Park on both of my visits to Chicago - in the summer and the winter. Both times I have been very pleased with the service and quality of food.  In the summer, the best way to enjoy an afternoon at Tavern is on their rooftop deck called The Treehouse. It is filled with comfortable tables and lounge chairs, great background music, and provides a great view of Millennium Park. During my summer visit I had their Fig & Prosciutto Flatbread which was absolutely delicious. I'm a sucker for anything with truffle oil, and when you pair it with poached pears, blue cheese, and prosciutto... it's an easy home run. Their Tuna Tacos, Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese, and Shoestring Fries with Truffle Aioli were also very good. I have a major sweet tooth so I went to dessert heaven when I ordered their Warm Apple Blueberry Bread Pudding, New York Style Cheesecake, Key Lime Creme Brulee, and Apple Crumble. The bread pudding is MASSIVE and can easily be shared between 4 or 5 people. The cheesecake and apple crumble were probably my favorite. In the winter, I went to Tavern for a romantic dinner in their Tree House Atrium, which is an enclosed glass section on their deck. Very romantic, quiet, and intimate lounge area. For dinner we had their Wild Mushroom & Truffle Risotto and Lobster Ravioli which were both so, so good! I was so happy we took leftovers back to our hotel so that we could have the next day.  The service was also excellent. The waiters were very attentive and accommodating. I will definitely we returning to Tavern at the Park in my future visits to Chicago.",0.9961,0.776,0.212,0.012,0.6532219251336898
2015-04-30,4.0,"By far one of the best places if you want to eat outside in Chicago! My boyfriend and I came here two weeks ago, and it was the first truly nice day of the year. I'll break down our visit for you Service and Ambiance: We had a reservation for 7:00, and when we arrived they said they could seat us immediately inside, or if we waited till 7:45 we could eat on their rooftop patio. I'm so glad we waited! It's directly across from Millennium Park, so it was so easy killing some time there, and then the hostess called my cell when the table was ready, about fifteen minutes earlier than they anticipated! The whole experience was wonderful. We were taken upstairs in an elevator, and the hostess gave us great recommendations on the way up. We were seated at a really cute table by the glass wall of the patio with the most amazing view of the city skyline. It was dusk, and everything was gorgeous! Very romantic. I wish I could remember our waiters names"" (that's right plural, waiters, we had two super awesome and attentive gentlemen serving us) because they both did a fantastic job. They answered all our questions, service was fast, and they made us laugh with their good-natured ribbing of one another.  Food: This is why my review is 4 stars instead of a solid 5. We both got beers, they have a pretty ecletic and unique selection. They were large and priced right. We also got the calamari appetizer to share, and it was delicious. The aoili was flavorful, the portion was big, and the calamari was done to perfection. My boyfriend got the steak sandwich (I believe it was called the Blackhawk) and he said it was really good. I got the Hippie Burger, which was a veggie burger, with rice, beans, and chick-peas, and I wasn't impressed. It kept falling apart and made a mess! I couldn't pick it up and eat with the bun and toppings, I ended up scooping the bits of burger up with a fork. It was a little disappointing because everything else was perfect.  I'll definitely be back this summer, I would love to try it for brunch, I'll just avoid the Hippie Burger in the future.",0.9974,0.755,0.207,0.037,0.6160052910052912

The aioli and onions on top just made it an out of this world meal. I had the fish n' chips, which was also very good.    I found the service to be exceptional. We arrived during a shift change, so we got to experience two servers, and both gentlemen were very knowledgeable, polite, and funny. One of their drink specials was recommended to my wife, but after one sip, she said she just didn't like it. Without hesitation the server (Chris) said he would bring her anything else she wanted and that she wouldn't be charged for the drink she didn't like. That's just great customer service! The atmosphere is very relaxed yet professional. This is not a bar. I would recommend patrons wear something a tad bit nicer than you would if you were going out to Applebee's or TGI Friday's.

That said, I have yet to experience the level of service that I have at Tavern at the Park anywhere else. Tabitha, the event coordinator, has been wonderful to work with and is extremely responsive via phone and email. Every time we hosted an event Tabitha stopped by before our guests arrived to thank us for our business. She also went the extra step of staffing our event with the same server (Ryan) each time which added to our experience. Ryan remembered me and my co-worker, and even called us by name which was impressive.

I also liked how the tables were not crammed together, there was nice spacing. I sat at the bar while waiting for my friends to arrive and had a drink. The beer menu is selective, but covers all the bases. Both at the bar and at our table, the service was excellent. We were seated even though we did not have our full party, which is a plus compared to some other places I've gone that make you wait. The food was well prepared and beautifully presented. The menu is a little on the pricier side, but it is well worth it. I recommend the house-made hummus as an appetizer, and do NOT leave this place without ordering a brownie sundae. It is to die for. I took the blue line and walked from Washington, which was not a bad walk, so I'm not sure about the parking situation. The reason I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5, because really I have no complaints about the service or the food taste and presentation, is because the menu has limited vegetarian options besides salad and one veggie burger.  I would like to see a mushroom sandwich or some sort of delicious pasta dish, but obviously I ate something and it was fabulous.

2014-12-17,4.0,"Location, Structure and Food! After flowing through my Yelp feed, I stumbled on this place and became very intrigued by the rooftop benefit. This location is directly across from Chicago's Millennium Park and externally is a beautiful building. As per recommendations from Yelpers, I made a reservation and noted that I wanted to be at the rooftop. Upon entering, my reservation was confirmed and coat check was available, as the hostess was about to sit me down at a table, I asked if the rooftop was available - she checked with her manager and it was!!!! I was then led to an elevator and escorted to the infamous rooftop... Unfortunately, due to the weather, the rooftop was enclosed but you still had a view of the park and city, however I was not able to get the same experience that other Yelpers had spoken about (ex: bar area, plush seating, closer views and airiness). I knew exactly what I wanted so I got the following... Smoked Pepper Wings - I asked that these be well done. They came out piping hot and were great! I wouldn't say that these are ""jerk"" but they are seasoned very well, I have to say that I was surprised with the quantity given... it was a lot... enough to share between 2-3 people. The Traverse City Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce that is givin on the side takes the wings to another level, I could swim in a bowl of it... it's sweet and has a hint of spice, you will enjoy it. The Tavern Steak - A 16oz Prime Ribeye, I ordered this well done, this is a lot of steak, lol, I loved that there was more meat than chewy fat and that it was grilled to perfection. It comes with a house made butter which compliments the steak well. I opted to also get a side of onion straws to place on top of the steak (which IMO should come automatically). I know many have concerns about customer service but I had no issues, in fact, my waitress was on it. She overheard me saying that I needed to be quick as I didn't have much time and came back to check on me as I was waiting on my food to ask if I was OK as she did not want me to be late, she kept my glass full and checked on me throughout the night. I did not encounter any issues with any staff and all requests were answered and accommodated without any attitudes.

And had I read many of the other reviews, I guess I would've known what @$$holes the host and hostess were. I hate to start a decent review with the bad stuff, but chronologically that's how this is going to go. Thankfully things greatly improved as the night went on. I made a reservation several days earlier and was informed that reservations aren't taken for the Tree Top, but they would note that we wanted to sit there on our reservation. Unfortunately when we arrived, it wasn't acknowledged whatsoever. No mention of it. The hostess began to seat us and I asked if we were going upstairs per our request. ""No, we only note that on the reservation,"" she said rather rudely. I told her we'd wait for a table up there, which seemed to shock her. ""It could be an hour,"" she said. ""I have no idea. But you can sit at the bar."" She pointed to a packed bar.  ""Where?"" I asked. ""Well I don't know. It's first come first served."" No shit, lady. But don't tell me to sit there if it's obviously full.  ""So what do you want to do?"" I said we'd stand there and wait for our table, which seemed to put her off even more and she walked away.  Well, we waited for a spot at the bar to open up, and before our drinks even arrived Friendly McCrabbypants arrived to tell us there was a table available upstairs. Once again she showed annoyance when I mentioned that we hadn't gotten our drinks yet, but my wife absolved the situation by telling me to go ahead upstairs and she would follow when the drinks came.  The hostess didn't go upstairs with me or show me to a table, as she did with every other guest that arrived after us. Instead she simply pushed the button on the elevator and said, ""take whatever table you want."" Jerk.  Had they simply said something like, ""I see you'd like to sit in the TreeTop. Unfortunately there's no table available right now, but I can seat you in the dining room right away,"" I wouldn't have been so put off by their behavior. But simply ignoring our request was downright rude and uncalled for.  But once we were upstairs things changed. It was another world. It was elegant and warm, with an amazing view of the skyline, picture-perfect lit Christmas trees and a roaring pillar fireplace. Everyone upstairs was delightful and friendly, and our waitress couldn't have been more helpful and attentive.  When my wife showed up sans drinks (they were missing an ingredient for one of their signature cocktails at the bar downstairs) our waitress told us they absolutely make it upstairs.  The food was divine. We had the duck egg rolls, my wife had a burger and I had the barbecue brisket. Everything was flavorful, delicious and wonderful, and our waitress Nashley checked on us and saw to it that we had an exceptional time.

The Tree House can be completely enclosed in glass and heated during the colder months we experience here in Chicago or they can open it up during the summer temps so you can eat, drink and be merry with the sun on your skin and feel Lake Michigan's breeze upon your face.

It's a bit complicated to know how you get up to this place.  On some nights you put your name in and wait for your entire party to show up and enter through the main restaurant.  And on our recent visit- they directed me a little east of the regular doors to climb up a metal stairway on the outside of the space.  No matter- the ending is the same as you find yourself in a cute rooftop bar with comfy seating clusters, cozy sofas and a bar to gather at. Since we were a party of 5, we were able to secure one of the table and sofa areas which was just perfect as it offered us a view of the park.  Know that after work and later in the day- the sun moves behind the buildings so it can get chilly up there.   Service was attentive and the manager stopped by a couple of times to make sure we had what we needed.

First and foremost, the smoked chicken wings were the best wings I've ever tasted anywhere, and I'm no stranger to wings.  These alone could have garnered the Tavern a 5-star review, but everything else was great as well.  They came with tradition hot sauce as well as a cherry cola BBQ, but they were so good plain I was neglecting the sauces.  I paired the wings with a Kentucky Bourbon Ale, which was as flavorful as it was smooth. For dessert, we tried the bread pudding (made with apples, blueberries, and lemon curd sauce) and a drink called The Peach Around.  I'm not usually a fan of peaches or baked apple, but both were great and they paired fantastically.  The bread pudding must have the size and weight of a cinder block,  I've seen mixed reviews regarding the service, but I had no complaints.  We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were knowledgeable, jovial, and welcoming.  While the atmosphere is definitely more upscale, I never felt out of place despite the fact that I was wearing a T-shirt and jeans.  Will definitely be returning the next time I'm in the area.",0.9831,0.748,0.179,0.073,0.4935574229691876

On the walk there, it looked as if the Treehouse was empty.  We were excited that we might be able to get seated right away.  We when finally found the correct hostess, she told us it would be a 15-45 min wait.  Since we weren't in a rush, we gave her our cell number and went downstairs to the Tavern at the Park bar for a glass of wine to wait. The bar was nice, not too loud, but the bar tender was very rude and not at all attentive.  It took him a good ten minutes to take our order after it took him more than five minutes to get us a wine menu.  Since we were in good company, we gave him two bucks, and then ignored him (like he noticed anyway...the bill sat next to even as we left over twenty minutes later).  After a while I called the hostess to inquire about our wait time, she said we were next on the list if no one in front of us responded to her calls.  Five minutes later, she called back and said our table was ready.  Then she told us we could grab the hostess downstairs, and he/she would take us to the elevator, so we didn't have to chug our drinks.  How nice! Then...we got upstairs.  The view was awesome, and the atmosphere was very nice.  However, the place was EMPTY!  EXTREMELY EMPTY.  Like, I could probably count the number of people on just my fingers, including the staff.  We would have been pissed, if it weren't for the wine we had already drank.  We really could not figure out why we had to wait when there was absolutely no one there.  We came to the conclusion that maybe the restaurant like to keep people waiting to think the tables are more in demand then they truly are.  Either way, it was fairly annoying and pretty dishonest.  There is no way that 20+ tables are got up and left in the same half hour time span we were waiting. To sum up the rest of our experience: the two apps we got were very good - shoestring fries with aioli and the margherita flatbread.  However, the service was awful.  So awful in fact that I had to physically find someone to get the check (our server was no where in sight).  Then, I had to waive the check in the air toward two or three servers standing and talking (again, not our server), just to pay them. I would have to say I wouldn't mind going back because of the food, the view, and the atmosphere (for us old people, you can actually hear each other talk).  As long as I am willing to put up with crap service the entire night.   However, I am still not sure why we had to wait when the place had over twenty open tables...  This will continue to baffle me...",-0.8235,0.807,0.089,0.104,0.5196693121693122

2014-06-05,4.0,"On a sunny weekday afternoon with colleagues, coming here for lunch was a real delight. We had a reservation upstairs on the second floor, and it was nice to see a view of the city all around us. From what I understand they have a fantastic outdoor rooftop deck, and I think that must be spectacular. This was my first time dining here, and I have to say my experience was perfect, other than I wish I would have followed my gut and ordered the short rib sandwich, because I'm still thinking about how good it must be.  Overall, the menu had so many options that I truly had a difficult time deciding. It's not an overwhelming menu and it's well organized, but it all looked beyond delicious to me. They have a great selection of salads, and for lunch you can choose from an entree or a list of delectable sandwiches - like the short rib.  I decided to go with a meatless option today - the butternut squash ravioli dish. It's my fault for assuming, but I thought the ravioli would be made from butternut squash and stuffed with some kind of cheese. It was plain ravioli stuffed with butternut squash. Here's the thing. The ravioli were just okay. The stuffing, however, was a mix of sweet and savory. The sauce, when blended together was a tad more on the sweet side, but a nice summer dish. Not super filling. Our server was professional, friendly, gave us plenty of time to search our menus, and I appreciated that he asked if any of us have allergies, because I'm allergic to soy.  Great experience, and I hope to get back for that sandwich!",0.9967,0.74,0.235,0.026,0.564404761904762

One half of the crust was burnt, the other half, under-cooked. Call it ""Pizza"", because this isn't flatbread. First impressions are everything.

2013-06-17,3.0,"I actually would've given this restaurant 5 stars if not for the one super important detail to service which you will learn about later. I visited on vacation and was celebrating my friend's 40th birthday that evening (it was just the 2 of us, not a large party). I'd gotten a recommendation from the concierge at my hotel and after reading the reviews on yelp thought it sounded perfect. Walking distance from my hotel, great view from the rooftop, known for great food and service. Once we arrived I let the hostess know we were celebrating a birthday which she then shared with our server who was excellent throughout the entire time. The food was fantastic, everything was cooked perfectly, other servers in the area were also very attentive, even had a visit from the manager asking if everything was OK, which up to that point everything was great. We hadn't finished our meals in order to save room for dessert and while getting that packed up we asked our server for the dessert menu. He then informed us the kitchen was now closed (it was 10:45pm on a thurs and they close at 10). He did say he'd go and speak to the chef and see what he could do. He was gone for awhile but in the meantime we just chatted and enjoyed the view. About 10 or so minutes later he arrived to inform us the chef would not serve us dessert. At that point, feeling somewhat dumbfounded we asked for the check and left. I did leave the server a 20% tip because he was excellent. We however left feeling very disappointed and turned off from this restaurant. Our complete experience went from absolutely perfect to less than just OK because we couldn't believe they wouldn't serve us dessert. The bar was still open with plenty of guests being served. What about a birthday drink offer? Or an ice cream scoop with a candle? or a chocolate cake slice? Something to show that you care about the special occasion. It was my friend's 40th birthday and we celebrated while on vacation, out of all the restaurants we had to choose from we picked this one and this is how it ended? Pretty sad actually as I've worked in the hospitality industry my entire life and service is a huge deal. I was feeling rather embarrassed and felt bad for my friend. Some things only happen once and this was it. This is the last memory we will have of Tavern on the park because we will not be going there on our next visit to Chicago.  I understood if the desserts have to be cooked but seriously, any effort would've made us leave with a smile instead of a frown that night. This is just a warning for anyone celebrating any type of special occasion or romantic event, or anyone who is looking for a special night. In the least I would've appreciated a ""we're closing the kitchen at 10 so if you want dessert, tell us now"" but nope, nothing, nada, zilch.",0.9973,0.77,0.183,0.047,0.5483597883597885

Star 2- I ordered a glass of wine and my fiance got a whiskey on the rocks (quite a generous pour!).  Drinks were large and reasonably priced! Star 3- Service.  Geremy was our server and she was fantastic!  She was there when we wanted her, she was not overbearing, she was super friendly and seemed like she truly enjoyed her job.  She gave great recommendations and comments on the food- she knew the menu well.  It was honestly the best service I have had in along time! Star 4- The Food.  The prices arent cheap, you should know that going into your evening, but its worth it.  I ordered the bookmaker steak sandwich ($22).  I am not a huge steak fan.  And this is only the 2nd steak sandwich I have ordered from a restaurant.  I eat steak probably twice a year at Ruth's Chris, and the only other steak sandwich- Morton's.  This was DELICIOUS.  I ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.  Why was it $22? Well... there was a TON of meat.  It comes with a delicious truffle aioli that melts in your mouth- and is delicious with the crispy onion strings.  I am currently fighting to finish this sandwich for lunch the day after (I was full for HOURS after 1/2 of it).  It comes with about 5 servings of fries.  I normally am not a fry person, but these were good!.   We ordered a side of creamed spinach- I could do without it, but it was pretty good.  Next time I will order an appetizer or dessert instead of a side! My fiance had the Lobster Ravioli (our server suggested that over the Lobster Mac n Cheese... but it was a close call).  Not only was the ravioli stuffed with Lobster, there were large chunks throughout.  I'm allergic, so I cant tell you how it tasted, but he was very pleased.  The dish was $34, but the amount of lobster I could see made the price extremely reasonable.   All in all it was delicious and we will definitely be back!  Next time when its nice and we can sit outside with a beautiful view, have a few drinks and the Duck eggroll and fig & prosciutto flatbread appetizers!  Why no 5 stars? I was still sad about not being able to sit outside and there were some d-bags running between the upstairs area and the bar downstairs that annoyed me (not the restaurants fault, and it wouldn't have been that way in the dining area!) oh and I am so not a fan of having to go upstairs to use the restroom.  Other than that... great experience!",0.9965,0.799,0.155,0.045,0.5660389610389611

2013-05-08,2.0,"With its proximity to Millennium Park, you'd probably think Tavern at the Park would be a bona-fide tourist trap. And you'd be right. The food actually isn't bad; it's just completely overpriced for the portion sizes. The menu is full of ""safe"" choices meant to appeal to those with an unsophisticated palate. This isn't necessarily meant to sound derisive; sometimes I rather enjoy ""plain"" food (for lack of a better word) and I certainly don't mind spending money if food is tasty, well-prepared and fills my stomach. The latter is the biggest issue I have with TatP. Today, for instance, I ordered a grilled vegetable salad. For $14, I expect it to fill me up. Now granted, I did not add on a protein to the salad (mainly because it would have turned into a $20 entree), but I foolishly thought a salad with grilled zucchini, peppers, corn, and tomatoes would suffice. My friend's caesar salad, to which she added salmon, came with a hefty price tag of $21, and it was the teensiest piece of salmon I've seen. Ridiculous. My salad was fine, but the portion made it look more like a ""side"" salad than one meant to, I don't know, actually fill me up. I'm back in the office after lunch and I feel as if I didn't eat anything. I'm on the verge of breaking my cardinal rule of scrounging in the office kitchen looking for whatever leftover food there might be from one of the lunch meetings we always seem to have. Normally, the thought of that horrifies me, but sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures. Service is perfectly fine. It's efficient and professional; no complaints there. They have a nice rooftop area to sit when the weather cooperates. That's pretty much all of the positives I can come up with at the moment. You could do worse.

2013-05-05,5.0,"Great experience at Tavern at the Park!  A friend of mine were meeting for dinner before a show at the Harris Theatre, and decided to go here based entirely on location, so I made a reservation and off we went. However, my friend went to Kansas and as such is a HUGE Jayhawks fan and they were playing in the Big 12 tourney last night...  something that wasn't scheduled or really even considered when buying the show tickets.  What's this got to do with Tavern at the Park, you say?  More than you'd expect. We get seated in the back dining area, and to our very pleasant surprise there's a tv near our table!  So we ask if they can change the channel to the Kansas game when it comes on and our server very accommodatingly says he'll do so.  Unfortunately when he comes back, it turns out they can't change it as it's tied to another tv and people who got there first requested something else.  Which would be a huge bummer, except he talked to the manager and it turns out there are also tvs in their upstairs area and there's a free table so we can watch whatever we want if we don't mind moving.  Seriously, they would not have been any nicer to us, or more eager to help us watch a basketball game.  This, friends, is what customer service is about.  WAY TO GO, Tavern at the Park! We ended up with a different server upstairs, but she was just as great - they were also very conscious of the fact that we had tickets to a show and made sure we were all finished up in time to get there. In addition to the service, I have to say that the food was also great.  I had chicken piccata, served with angel hair and I loved it.  I have absolutely no recollection what my friend had (sorry, it's been a month or so...  I'm a little behind on reviews), but I do remember that he was equally pleased with his meal.   Definitely worth a return trip, especially in the summer when you can enjoy the upstairs patio - nothing like sitting outside with a drink, overlooking Millenium Park!",0.9949,0.804,0.172,0.024,0.5805555555555556

The bf picked Tavern at the Park for Vday 'cuz he saw that they extended their Restaurant Week menu.  We had a little bit of a fail for Restaurant Week, so he thought this might make up for it. First off, service was incredible.  For this location, I assumed that we would be dealing with snobbiness all night, but I was really wrong.  Everyone was really friendly, especially our darling waiter.  We were seated in one of the large booths (which was perfect for sharing convo AND people watching).  For the Restaurant Week menu, I choose to the duck confit flatbread and the bf ordered the crab stuffed artichoke.  We ended up swapping apps, though, as we liked each other's picks better.  The flatbread was good, but I really liked the crab/artchoke combo.  My main entree was the sea bass which came with this apple hash, rice and amazingly addictive spicy sauce.  I have no idea what that suace was, but it pretty much made the dish. The bf ordered the beef medallions, so when they brought out this huge piece of beef, I thought to myself, ""Wow, they don't really skimp on the portions here.""  If you know me, you know that I have no clue about steak/prime rib/cuts of beef, so I didn't realize that they brought out the wrong thing.  Neither did my bf, apparently.  When the waiter came by, he was absolutely appalled that they brought out the wrong dish.  A couple minutes later, when my bf was mid-bite, one of the managers came around with the dish he actually ordered.  I thought they were just going to swap out the items, but the manager actually wrapped up the initial dish for us to take home!  Amazing!   I was pretty food coma'ing at this point, but I couldn't refuse taking a few bites of the fantastic banana cream pie.  It was probably the hugest slice of pie I've ever seen.  Since my bf wanted an after dinner sip of something (and I did NOT want scotch), the waiter suggested Frangelico.  When I admitted that I've had grappa and limoncello, but never frangelico, the waiter offered to bring me out a sample so I could figure out if I liked it.  It was honestly the best thing ever (and I started wondering how I've never had it!) and it was the perfect way to cap off the meal!

We were all stuffed when it came time for dessert, but my aunt decided we needed to see the menu anyway.  We ended up ordering the two LARGEST desserts on their menu: the carrot cake and the berry tart (i forget the real name).  Both were monstrous and delicious.  I'm pretty sure we spent 3+ hours eating, talking and carrying on and we closed that place down on the Thursday night we were there, but the staff was incredibly friendly and didn't seem to mind at all.  In fact, the manager visited our dinner room during the evening to make sure everything was going well.  Over all a great place to eat and enjoy yourself!  Ask for the private room if you can -- it made all the difference in our dining experience here.",0.9978,0.782,0.211,0.006,0.5998511904761905

Our server, Jimmy, was probably one of the nicest, friendliest and most helpful waiters I have ever had in my entire life!

I also had the ceviche to start which ""was sooooo good"" according to the waitress who claimed that she had never had it before and when she tried it here she asked the chefs to give her the recipe.

The special pizza, which came with lobster, pancetta, tomatoes, and spicy onions, was almost too spicy to eat, and I'm not a sissy when it comes to heat. There were jalapenos sort of randomly on there, too, despite no mention of them in the description. The combination of flavors was unusual, but not really harmonious. Felt like a kitchen sink pizza that could have used a little more thought/finesse. Beet salad: good, but standard. Chunks of beets were pretty clunky/big, not pretty to look at. Sockeye special: Fish was good, not overcooked, but the whipped potatoes it came with were cold. The other things on the plate included two sliced tomatoes, some cucumbers, olives and frisee. Weird set, didn't really go with the fish. It was sort of like a nicoise and a Greek salad got together and procreated. For $28, I felt a little cheated that my salmon basically just came with a side salad. My date got the truffle chicken hash, which looked good. Huge plate of food, and he barely made a dent, but it looked more interesting than my dish. The service was pretty good -- only annoying thing is the server kept asking us when we wanted our entrees to arrive. Right after she brought out the apps, she asked if we were ready for entrees. No, we said, we'd like a little time to eat the apps. She asked again 5 minutes later. The kitchen was closing, but still....it's the server's job to time the courses properly.

I definitely liked the ambiance of the place. We had made reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival. We were promptly greeted by our server Quinton who was very prompt and attentive throughout our meal. I will say that I'm not always adventurous in my choices and thought I would love to have a good piece of prime rib. While texture was there, there was very little flavor. All it needed was some garlic and some herbs and it could take it from $35 for this!?!?? To, Yum! Who cares how much it is?? Additionally I ordered the potato cakes which were good I must say but a huuuuge portion for one person as a side. My wife ordered the rotisserie chicken which she enjoyed but I felt was rather dry when I tasted it. I wasn't impressed with the barbecue either. Overall it was a good experience but when something so simple and pricey is screwed up it leaves a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended) .

It was good, but nothing super exciting. My friend had the Chicken Piccata and loved it. I had the Bookmaker Steak Sandwich and OH MY GOD. It was so incredibly good. Great cut of meet, onion strings, truffle aoli, whiskey butter, toasted pretzel roll ... mmmmmmmmm. It was very rich so I could only eat half but I wanted to marry the other half.

2012-06-05,5.0,"Lobster and salmon and ribs...oh my! On a recent Saturday evening, I had the pleasure of experiencing dinner at Tavern At The Park for the very first time. It was magical like The Wizard of Oz!  My party arrived before I did. When I walked in, I was led through a gorgeous dining room. Warm, dark woods. Interesting wall art. Large booths. And...wait for it...comfortable chairs!  I sat in one of those for quite a while over a leisurely dinner with family and friends.  We started with crispy meatballs and smokey chicken wings. The meatballs definitely were the real deal! Crispy on the outside. Soft and moist on the inside. Expertly combined with a rich Sunday gravy (like Grandpa C. used to make). The wings really surprised me. See, the apps were ordered before I arrived. Honestly, I never would have ordered these. I would have missed this life-changing experience had it not been for my dining companions. Thanks folks!  The side sauces were fantastic, but almost unnecessary. Don't misunderstand me. The sauces were spot on, but those wings were seasoned beautifully and the smokiness had me eating every single bite and maybe even licking my fingers. ...Allegedly. ;-) Don't skip the bread and butter. This is very important, so I will say it again. Do not skip the bread and butter. There was a variety of choices available. My favorite?  The pull-apart rolls with a bit of cheese melted on top.  I indulged in the broiled king salmon. This was the most memorable entree that I have eaten in years. Literally. The cherry and apple glaze on this huge piece of salmon was light, but definitely present. This was served on top of a crispy hashbrown, an onion chutney and a fabulous sauce. I ate every single bite. I'll share a secret with you. I took one of those crazy good rolls and basically wiped my plate clean. I'm not ashamed. There was no way that I could waste a single morsel of that yummy goodness! I nibbled on a little of almost everything that hit our table. I was in heaven. Smokey ribs (another finger lickin' good dish). I had a lobster ravioli. The homemade pasta was perfectly al dente. The sauce was unique in the most deliciously memorable sort of way.  Then, the desserts arrived. We tried three of the most luscious sweet treats I have ever laid a fork on before. I can't even tell you which one to order because I would probably want a bite of all three again. First, was a blueberry bread pudding. Fresh blueberries among perfectly executed bread pudding. Not overly sweet. The perfect temperature. Fantastic!  Next, there was a slab of carrot cake with caramel sauce. I should use a word other than slab to describe it, but it was a huge piece!  How about hunk?  Aw, forget it. This carrot cake had the best surprise throughout. Pineapple chunks!  Perfect bites of fruit helped to keep the cake moist. The frosting was a cream cheese base with a hint of something else that I couldn't put my finger on. Good?  Understatement!  If I hadn't been so full at that point, I probably could have eaten a bowl of that frosting. Finally we had a strawberry blues. Imagine blueberry scones (really they are hoecakes, but it was just like a scone), with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, blueberries and whipped cream. Fantastic textures had my mouth dancing for joy!   Service was delightful!  Our server was helpful, courteous and on top of everything that we needed before we needed it. The manager stopped by a few times over the course of the (leisurely) evening to check on things. He had his eye on every detail and really seems to keep the operation in check. One of the owners also stopped by. He was friendly and down to earth. Obviously attentive to his guests' needs.  I waited a couple days to make sure that I wasn't dreaming this whole amazing experience up in my head. I wasn't. I'd like to go back right now. In fact, I'm going to grab my ruby slippers...

2012-06-03,5.0,"This place is a real gem...prior to last night, I had only visited or carried out for lunch.  I go to school nearby, and this is always my go-to place if I have the time.  The club sandwich (only available at lunch) is amazing.  I've never had one as good anywhere else. Great friends of 30 years were coming into the city yesterday for engagement photos, so I was only too proud to show off my city and spend a day outside catching up.  We got to the restaurant at about 9:30 and did not leave until well after midnight.  The service was absolutely impeccable, as it always has been in my experiences there.  The manager and owners are beyond personable and visit the table on occasion.  I have never sent anything back for any reason, but you very clearly can tell they want your experience to be above and beyond the norm.  Special requests are very welcomed and they really pay attention to detail.  One member of our party had to leave prior to going to dinner.  When it later turned out she was able to join us, they reseated us at a larger table and managed our meal amazingly to ensure we were never without while we waited for our addition to arrive.  She ordered her entree, enjoyed some appetizers, and everything came out together.  Awesome! The food was incredible.  No more needs to be said.  Just incredible.  We did a fair amount of sharing between friends, so everyone got a taste of everything.  We got the crispy meatballs and smoked wings for appetizers.  Amazing.  The peppers that come with the meatballs were out of this world, and the wings were nothing short of mind-blowing.  I hate wings (really, hate em') but this may very well have been one of the best I have ever tasted.  Smoked perfectly, meat was firm but juicy as could be.  I cleaned the bones.  And will be ordering them next time I dine there...but all to myself! Entree round consisted of prime rib, rack of ribs with mac n' cheese and slaw, lobster ravioli, the salmon special, and a baked chicken dish.  All were remarkably good!  As I said, we did a lot of sharing, so it made for a very family-stylish mood.  For dessert we had the carrot cake, which is the size of a VW Bug, strawberry blues and the bread pudding.  These desserts are beyond description!  The berries were so fresh and perfectly ripe, the cream was freshly made and fluffy, and the carrot cake must have a secret ingredient in the frosting.  I don't know what, but holy cow!   I cannot speak highly enough of this experience.  I have always enjoyed my visits there, but last night raised the bar big time!  The ambiance was perfect, service was so attentive, but completely nonintrusive.  The manager and the owner stopped by, congratulated the soon to be newlyweds.  They closed at 10:30, but we got the same incredible level of service at 12:15 that one would get at 8pm.  So impressed.  My guests, who rarely make it into the city for such evenings, had a blast.  And it was just the perfect choice for a group of friends looking to reminisce and catch up.",0.9987,0.766,0.201,0.034,0.5717373511904761

Other than the price, my other complaint is that I was in the middle of taking a bite of my burger, when the bar tender wanted to start a tab on me and asked for my credit card.  Very odd, as I had ordered wine and waited for my burger, which took at least 15 minutes.  Why ask for the credit card when I was mid-bite?!  Pretty unprofessional even for a meal at the bar.  In fact, all of my years living and dining in Chicago and all of the years that I have traveled have never brought on such a request mid-bite.  Better training for the staff could improve such things.   Would have given the place four stars, even with the burger that was not medium and high prices, but asking me for my credit card in the middle of my meal is over the top!  Three stars for Tavern at the Park!  Plus, the Gage is better and more affordable!",0.9644,0.86,0.111,0.029,0.48839743589743595

The entrees are truly wonderful, creative and very affordable for this class of restaurants.  My black truffle chicken was divine and $21.00.  Truthfully, it was enough to feed two people, but I gorged myself silly.  I simply loved, loved, loved the Irish Potato Cake.  It's like someone shaped grits and cheese into a biscuit.  The poached egg on top of the ensemble seems like the new trendy thing to do with burgers, but there it was on my black truffle chicken.  It was like have breakfast and dinner combined.  I also had their fired banana split dessert.  That was ingenious frying the banana in what I assume is cornflakes!  My SO loved his hamburger.    The interior was more casual than I assumed from looking at the outside, but maybe that's because we were seated downstairs across from the bar.  Perfect for lunch and a great, first introduction to Tavern at the Park.",0.9955,0.767,0.211,0.022,0.5970494417862839

2012-02-13,4.0,"Based off of near-the-theater yelp reviews, we took a chance at this tasty-sounding, food and drink stand. Tavern @ the Park was oh so close to that illustrious 5th star but the really awkward server quickly brought it down a star (so close...) along with a consistent lack in use of salt and pepper. The biggest surprise to me were the prices of the drinks. Incredibly affordable for that area. The beer, cocktail and wine consumed by us was delicious and my wallet only took a paper cut rather than a financial gashing.  As for the food, it lacked a sprinkle of pepper and salt. That little shake of s&p could've made the meals amazing. They were, however, quite delicious in my tummy. The pork belly appetizer provided a much larger portion than anticipated for $8. The mustard-vin dressed salad it comes with was the tastiest surprise on that plate (the bread with raisins didn't make any sense). If you like chicken and want something hardy, I recommend the chicken hash. Everything went really well together. It was like having dinner and breakfast all at the same time. My wife had the lamb shank special and though tasty - she craved some good ol salt n peppa. (You can Push It, Tavern, Push It real good). All in all, it was a delightful experience before seeing a show just down the road. It's not too loud, the food's great and everything was very prompt.

However, I recently came here for dinner with a friend and was rather disappointed. I ordered the ricotta gnocci, which turned out to be enough food for about 3 people. I probably ate about a third of it. I guess they're trying to justify the incredibly steep prices by piling on the food, but I would much prefer a normal portion size with a normal price. The gnocci also seemed overcooked to me and the sauce was overwhelming in taste and in quantity. There was probably a pound of sauce alone.

We'd eat here again - and definitely recommend it to others - local and those visiting.  The ambiance was very nice - you could request a table outside, inside the bar area, or in the dining area - choices for all,  FYI, the only reason that we deducted a half star was because our dog wasn't allowed out on the patio....Maybe that's Chicago laws...but....I'm just sayin'...

I don't remember the name of the salad I got at lunch, but there were four chicken breasts on the plate. FOUR. For one person! That could have fed me for 4 separate meals. In any case, the salad also had goat cheese and apples and it was just yummy all-around. For dinner, I got the vegetarian lasagna, and again, it was enough for 3 or 4 meals. This is nit-picky, but I would have liked bigger pieces of veggies so that they wouldn't fall off my fork after the noodles were cut...but anyway, it was delicious and I can't wait to eat it for lunch today.

2011-02-26,1.0,"I'm a longtime customer of the former Chicago Bar & Grill, which now calls itself Tavern At the Park, dating back nearly 30 years now.  Owing to its intimacy, quality, location and the ability to always get a comfortable seat within seconds, it has stood for decades as the ideal place to go for dinner and/or drinks after work, for quick business meetings, after taking in social functions, entertainment, shopping, ice skating or whatever.  You can rest assured, however, that after my experience there last night I will never set foot inside the place again, and I will admonish my friends and professional colleagues to avoid this establishment as well. Several news stories have been written and published in local mainstream media over the past couple of weeks detailing how suburban whites are now eschewing the suburbs they ran to more than 40 years ago, and are returning to reside in the downtown Chicago area--like it's a good thing.  What not one of those articles has emphasized is the African American populace that they are displacing, and the attitude, arrogance and sense of entitlementment that some of these ""newly urban"" white transplants are bringing with them to the city. A female colleague of mine and I decided to meet at Tavern On the Park last night just to catch up on things, and enjoy some cocktails.  She arrived minutes before I did, and was asked by the metrosexual white, male host  to stand by because there was a ""45-minutes-to-an-hour wait"" for a table (we are both African American).  Once I walked in, my friend informed me of the situation and we stood off to the side, but watched intently as at least three non-African American guests and their parties were very warmly greeted by the host, who proceeded to assure them that ""whatever table opened up next was definitely theirs."" He repeated this audibly, three times, almost as if he was determined that we heard him.  My friend then simply walked over to the desk to ask about our place on the list, and out of nowhere was rudely, verbally assaulted by this blonde, pompous, male (expletive omitted) like I have never heard a woman addressed before.  Then, he calmy turned back to his white guests, smiled like a Cheshire cat and said, ""now, how can I be of service to you?""  This person has no idea how very close he came to a physical confrontation with me for insulting a black woman and friend of mine like that, but we just determined that it wasn't worth it, and that after three decades Tavern At the Park no longer deserves our money. It's like these days, so long as most downtown Chicago establishments are packed to the rafters with white, college-aged kids freely spending mommy and daddy's money and chasing butt, proprietors feel like they can address and treat black patrons any kind of way because serving people who look just like them is what they prefer.  Handing downtown over to white, former suburbanites may be a cash cow for merchants, but that's not Chicago.  Character is no more.  It's essentially a college town after 5:00 p.m. People of color, if you're in search of an establishment where you'll be respected, Tavern At the Park is not it, and it starts right at the door with the so-called ""host"" that they have in place.  How very disappointing with an accomplished restaurateur like Peter de Castro, Jr. as the owner.",0.9965,0.802,0.152,0.046,0.2802756892230577

We had made a reservation but suddenly decided to eat earlier than planned. I called and the host was extremely accommodating. When we got to the restaurant he greeted us warmly and immediately had us seated. Tavern At The Park has very low lighting and a mellow atmosphere in the dining room, but the bar seemed like it was fairly ruckus for a Thursday night. Although, it's kind of an inconvenience to have to take an elevator to the restroom, I felt very chic doing it so it made up for that.The wait-staff, on the other hand, is okay. I wasn't impressed. Our waiter seemed as if he would have rather been somewhere else. Perhaps he was having an off night... Who knows? Nevertheless, the food is ok at best but the portions are huge so bring your appetite with you. The atmosphere is appealing for a large group or an intimate dinner.

Once I read the reviews and factored in the proximity, I figured I would give it a chance. It was pretty busy at 9 when I arrived, so I stole a place at the bar. Bad choice. I was next to two drunk women, on of which was describing her sex life in way too much detail. I ordered the rib eye and the creamed spinach. The spinach was very creamy and cheesy, way too cheesy. I ordered the rib eye black and blue, the bartender even verified exactly how I wanted it, too bad the kitchen didn't pay attention.

They were both extremely kind, attentive, and accommodating. Also, you can't beat the location. We sat outdoors on a perfect summer day with a breeze. Then the food and drinks happened. I mean it is a restaurant. My Wife and Mom-In-Law both started with what they claimed was a Cesar salad. These salads were coated with mayo like white on rice. I've never had a Cesar salad this disgusting. I'm not quite sure how you screw up a Cesar salad this bad. It's hard. I mean real hard. I mean this stuff comes in easy to use grocery store kits for lazy bachelors that tastes halfway decent. I did however find it hilarious when the two women started brushing their tongues with the bread to scrape off the mayo taste. We also got a couple glasses of white sangria (no pitchers? no red sangria option even? okay, fine, I'll stop being picky). The glass was about 3/4 ice and only had three berries in it. There were all raspberries. W. T. F. Kids, that stands for Why The Frugality. As you could imagine, we weren't expecting a ton from the main courses at this point. My Mother and I got the Saturday Night Special: a 14 ounce Prime Rib (it's $22, how could we not?). My wife had the Chicken Milanese, and mom-in-law the Veal Chop Marsala. My Prime Rib was excellent. I honestly didn't expect a cut of meat so good for this price from a place like this, but they did well to keep things simple with some horseradish sauce and some au jus. The Chicken Milanese was decent. I have a feeling the balsamic reduction really saved what could have otherwise been a bland dish. The Veal Chop Marasala was too heavily breaded for it's own good.  I'd go back to Tavern At The Park for the Prime Rib. The service, weather, and location - right next to Millenium Park - also helped saved the night for me.

2010-03-12,3.0,"The girl and I celebrated our anniversary last week and part of our celebration was dinner at Tavern at the Park. All in all, the meal was just fine, but I think my dear friend Keara's review below caused me to get way to excited about it. It didn't live up to expectations, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.  We began our meal with some drinks. I ordered a scotch and water and to my dismay, it was served to me in a regular drinking glass rather than a rocks glass. I'm not normally a snob (when I'm at home, not owning a rocks glass, I drink from a Shrek glass I got at McDonalds), but at a nicer restaurant I would like to have my drink served in the proper glass.  For an appetizer, we had the grilled polenta. This was a part of one of my new years goals to try a new food every month. I'd never had polenta before, but understanding it to be basically uncooked corn bread (sort of) I thought it might be ok. Texturally, I didn't care for it, but if I got a piece of sausage and some cheese and a just a little polenta, it wasn't too bad. I didn't care for the sausage served in the chunky tomato and pepper sauce, but that's my own pickiness.  From there, we moved to main courses. The girl had blue cheese crusted filet mignon and absolutely raved about it. I had the prime rib, which was outstanding. Cooked right, tender, flavorful. Just great. The star of this portion of the meal was the Ashley's Mac and Cheese. Some of the best mac and cheese I've ever had in my life.  Let's finish with desert. It was the highlight of the meal. Our waiter told us ""Our deserts, with the exception of the cheesecake and the crème brulee are huge so you're only allowed to order one."" But at the recommendation of Keara, I was having the key lime crème brulee. Holy balls. It was fantastic. The lady got the cookie ice cream sandwich, which she could barely finish, but since my crème brulee was light, I made quite a dent in it myself.

Now on to service-- our server Lauren was, for lack of a better word, OUTSTANDING!!!  She was on top of things without being intrusive. She has a wonderful sense of humor and was very engaging.  She even asked at the beginning if either one of us had any allergies the kitchen should know about.  We don't- but my son does so now I know I can take him here and he'll be safe.  I wish all restaurants did that.   The drink list had some very unique combinations that I will have to get back to try soon as I understand the mixologist tries to keep things seasonal.   Overall a great lunch with outstanding service.",0.998,0.747,0.237,0.016,0.5944588744588745

Main course - I had the brick chicken - wow, it was so tasty and juicy.  At first it looked small, but that's because they put the dark meat piece over the white meat piece, after I found that out, it was HUGE!  My bf got the prime rib - he ate every last piece, it was cooked very well, very soft and very tasty. Dessert - I had the hot fudge sundae, it was very good, nothing special, but very tasty after that rich meal.  My bf got the chocolate mousse, and it was the only bad part of the meal - it was so grainy!  Not smooth at all.  Our server was really attentive.  During dessert she noticed my bf had only eaten a few bites of his mousse and asked what was wrong, so we told her it wasn't very good.  She was very apologetic that we did not like the chocolate mousse and offered to give us another sundae. We declined. Service was excellent.

The staff is very knowledgeable and the management is hilarious.  I think some of the poor reviews given to this restaurant are from people who are expecting something out of the ordinary and contemporary. The reason for this is because many of the people who rate this restaurant are from out of town and have expectations for a Chicago restaurant based on what they see on TV.  Tavern is not going to go out of its way to be famously artistic with the dishes; from my experience, they concentrate on comfort food cooked to perfection. They pull this off better than any other restaurant that is trying fit this same genre (i.e. Table 52).  Try the Double-Cut pork chop, which is always a crowd pleaser. As is the chicken and fontina fondue. I've never been a fan of their chop salad so probably steer away from that, but I have enjoyed the grilled vegetable salad, which is fantastic and different.  Like I said, don't come here if you want a menu that has been overhauled to squeeze in items such as ""black truffle foam, creme fraiche coulis, duck confit-stuffed rack of lamb with a roasted puree of pequin capon,"" because you're not going to find that. Tavern will give you great dishes that you grew up with, incorporate a cool twist, and cook it to perfection (i.e. Ashley's Mac & Cheese, Coca-cola BBQ sauce, Prime Rib Sandwich).

No. I ordered the seared ahi appetizer -- it came with a weird chopped mix of vegetables (peppers, celery, onions), which looked interesting, but wasn't.  The tuna itself was tasteless, and had a green drizzle on it that also added zero flavor.  None -- I still am confused as to what ingredients you could possibly mix together to get something that void of taste. I was hoping that was a fluke, and thought maybe my taste buds were just hungover, like i was.  But that wasn't the case -- my taste buds are one sense that never let me down. I ordered the wheat penne -- it sounded amazing -- white wine sauce, portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts...but it was a major let down.  It was way too creamy, oily, lacked flavor, and the noodles were soft and mushy.

The menu featured just a few lunch-y type items, but I think the cheapest was an $11 burger.  Aside from a few sandwiches and regular entrees, they had some ""lunch"" specials that were more like dinner entrees when it came to price ($20 -$25 each).  So this is definitely more of a business meeting/special occasion place to lunch. The food was a mixed bag - appetizers such as calamari were excellent, as were the fries.  A couple of us ordered the prime rib, was supposed to be prepared medium but what we received was very pink & bloody & I swear I could hear mine making moo-ing sounds as I cut into it.  Another person who had ordered the same dish sent it back to be cooked more, to the credit of the staff they gave her a whole new entree without a hassle. Everything is served in generous portions, if you still have room in your belly, they have a few good desserts - sharing is recommended as most desserts are enormous.

We ordered an appetizer and entrees... the appetizer came in a timely manner (10 minutes or so), but then I swear there was another 20 or 25 minutes at least before our entree came, which is just puzzling given that we had ordered it at the same time as the appetizer, the place was nearly empty, and we had both ordered sandwiches.  Other than the slow food delivery the service wasn't overly impressive, I felt like I was eating at the bar with the bartender taking my order (though I wasn't). I work in Prudential Plaza, so I was hoping when they opened it would be a good place to go for an occasional somewhat splurgy lunch or a good business lunch... Apparently the place is very busy and you pretty much need a reservation to get a lunch table here (unless you're OK with eating at 2pm...).  So that's a strike in my book, but I guess you can't fault them for success (or at least temporary rush success).  It would be nice if they'd have a late afternoon special or something to get in more people, aka me.  Given the extremely slow service and what not, we were there long enough to find that the place started really packing them in to the bar after 4.

2007-11-02,3.0,"Hmmm....Tavern on the Park.....where do I start?  First off, I personally like the decor .  The interior is done in a warm mahogany finish and is dimly lit, my sort of place!  Second, the service was decent though our waitress seemed inexperienced but there was another server watching over to ensure that she was doing her job correctly.  Third, the food was decent but a little pricey for the money.  Overall, I would come here for drinks and people watching rather than for the food.",0.7088,0.917,0.083,0.0,0.37878787878787873
2007-10-25,3.0,"After hearing Food Network Star Robert Irvine had dined here recently, I had to make a reservation and try it for myself.  I made a 5:30pm ""reso"" on a Thursday and it was packed the second we got there.  Granted, there was a large party occupying the entire upstairs room, but this place was still hopping all night long. My mom and I started off with the Blackened Ahi Tuna appetizer, and it was average at best.  It had some type of green sauce that made it taste better, but the tuna itself was simply average and not spicy at all. For our entrees, I ordered the Marinated BBQ Chicken Sandwich, which came smothered in cherry-cola BBQ sauce that was honestly the greatest BBQ sauce I'd ever tasted.  The chicken was thin and grilled to perfection.  I had a giant baked potato with it, and I promise you, it was the size of a football, but I somehow finished the whole thing.  My mom ordered the Filet with Lobster crust, and the bite that I got of it was super moist. For dessert, we shared the Fried Banana Split, which is basically two medium banana's coated in frosted flakes and deep fried.  Then place them on top of two huge scoops of vanilla ice cream and drizzle it with chocolate and caramel sauce, along with a cherry and some whipped cream, and you have the ultimate dessert!  This was fantastic and the sweet crusted banana paired with the ice cream was the perfect match.   The service here was even better than the food.  Nilo, are server, was so incredibly fast with our drinks, food, and was always willing to get whatever we needed.  When I told him how much I enjoyed the BBQ sauce on my sandwich, he ran back to the kitchen and brought out a huge bowl of it for me to layer on.  He also was relaxed, calm, and funny at the same time, never phased by the incredibly packed bar and ongoing demand of his tables.  We rewarded him for all his hard work. Overall, Tavern at the Park is a must see place with amazing service and extremely flavorful food. Second Visit: This place was way less appealing the second time around.  I went in there with two of my friends at around 4:00pm, with the entire restaurant empty.  Our waiter was either high or really dumb because he seemed to have trouble talking.  When he did, he spoke so softly we couldn't understand him.  And remember, we couldn't hear him despite no one in the restaurant.   Anyway, we ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it actually was pretty good, and the spicy dipping sauce was a good compliment.  I ordered the Cherry Cola BBQ Chicken Sandwich again and this time it was so average I felt like they stole my $14.  There was like a hint of BBQ sauce, and I would've asked for more, but knew our dumb waiter was unable to do much.  My friends ordered the Whole Wheat Pasta and the Lobster Crusted Filet and both ate most of their food.  We all shared the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert, and again this was a disappointment with the lack of strawberries and the over dose of tasteless pound cake and unbelievably heavy cream that had the effect of your gut expanding on the spot! Try this place once, come when its busy so you can be seen, but don't expect much else.",0.9987,0.766,0.191,0.043,0.5480086580086581
2007-10-21,3.0,"The three stars are really for the food not for the location and neither for interior decor. Should probably include the remarks that doorman made to my date for wearing his Burberry cap inside the dining area. Therefore, no hats, no designer fancy shmancy hot and trendy.  Uptight and smart is the motto! or at least, it must appear so. . . The wine selection was not far distinct and even satisfying.

2007-10-10,4.0,Went here for a work lunch meeting and had a good experience.  The decor and ambience is great (love the blue glasses and water pitcher) and it has an upscale feel without being stuffy or uninviting.  The menu was decent and even the strict vegetarian/vegan with us was able to find an entree without too many problems.  I knocked them down a star because I will say the shrimp on my salad was overcooked and for an $18 caesar salad that shouldn't happen.  But overall I was pleased and will definitely go back again!,0.9343,0.846,0.154,0.0,0.4664141414141414

2007-09-10,2.0,"This restaurant reminds me of this accountant I used to date.  He was really cute, made a ton of money, extremely intelligent, and most importantly, crazy about me.  I should have been head over heels about him, but for some reason I just couldn't get into it.  Something was just....... off.   Tavern at the Park is like that accountant.  It's a good-looking restaurant (if I were rating it based on looks alone, it would get five stars) in a great location with menu items that sound delicious.  Unfortunately, I left dinner vaguely disappointed.  While there wasn't one big glaring problem, I thought there were lots of little ones. Service gets an A for effort, but a C for execution.  Our waiter was friendly, but struck me as inexperienced.  I mean, who doesn't know that a chilled white wine gets placed in a bucket of ice once it's brought to the table?  (Not that it mattered too much, since we polished off the bottle pretty quickly.) As far as the food is concerned, it was not promising when the bread basket arrived with store-bought dinner rolls (these were seriously awful........ not even Jewel-quality) and cold butter.  While it's a minor detail, this should be one of the easiest things for a restaurant (especially one that is attempting to come across as upscale) to get right and they didn't. I ordered the rotisserie chicken, which was cooked and seasoned perfectly, yet slightly overpriced at $18.  Entrees are served a la carte here, so I had to shell out another $5 to get some broccoli (which was also cooked and seasoned perfectly). My boyfriend had a club sandwich and macaroni and cheese, both of which he seemed to enjoy immensely.  (Of course, he'll eat anything, but I suppose that's beside the point.) We ordered the cookies and cream fondue for dessert, which was yet another part of this dining experience that was great in theory but not in practice.  I think white chocolate is really too thin for fondue, especially if the point is to incorporate something like bits of Oreo cookie; the mixture didn't really stick well to anything. It should also be noted that the rice krispie treats and marshmallows were vaguely stale, and that green apple, white chocolate and Oreo cookie crumbs is not a good flavor combination. And yes, I know it seems as though I am being really picky, but I am a detail-oriented person.  So there. However, much like my tumultous relationship with the accountant, I will give this place another try because I really do want things to work out (also, it's in close proximity to my office).",0.9889,0.814,0.127,0.059,0.5586640211640211

2007-08-25,3.0,"Not an upscale dining experience, but certainly tavern style food with the potential of great views. I should remark that if you're looking for a well executed dining experience with more upscale choices, the Park Grill is a much better choice than here. But if you're looking for a casual place to relax and have some drinks and dip the Tavern at the Park is the place for you!  We had a party of 6. I had called several days before and requested a table with a view. We were seated promptly, though to my dismay, our only view was of a plasma TV in an odd windowless room on the second floor.  The appetizers are all about the dips. Crab dip, chicken cheese fondue (skip it) mac and cheese, artichoke, etc. Main courses: Most of us stuck with the tried and true fillet which was pretty good. You order sides a la carte, and you are offered the typical steakhouse fare of creamed spinach, green beans, broccoli with cheese etc. My bf had the pasta with scallops, it was huge and pretty good. My aunt had a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon which looked really good.  Overall: The service was marginal. Our waiter, bless his heart, was very inexperienced. They were featuring a heart of palm salad, and he volunteered that though he had never heard of heart of palm before today he thought it was kind of like asparagus. He was very eager to please but unsure of what to do almost every step of the way. The one very important exception to this was at the beginning he made a point to ask if there were any allergies (there were) and he was very intent on making sure that the allergy sufferer was taken care of.  Our dishes were cleared promptly.  Once again, not fancy schmancy but definitely OK, and the prices while steep aren't outrageous. I am looking forward to returning in the fall, when the leaves are changing.",0.9972,0.736,0.223,0.041,0.6142037890424987

Due to rain and cab messiness, two of us were very late but the waiter was awesome and took our orders as soon as we showed up and then brought everyone's food out at the same time.  I ordered the chicken pot pie which was flakey and delicious.  The waiter was extremely attentive and two of the managers also visited our table to make sure everything was going well.  I will certainly be going back again.   The restaurant wasn't very crowded and I hope that's because it's very new.  It pains me that people will wait for an hour to eat at Grand Luxe when there's an even better restaurant down Michigan avenue with no wait at all.",0.9817,0.73,0.225,0.046,0.6080460062813005

I had the French Onion soup as well which was good.  I also had the filet sliders with blue cheese.  The sliders were a little overcooked and the blue cheese wasn't quite as flavorful as I normally prefer.  The wine list gets an extra star since it had one of our favorite bottles on it that is hard to find. Finally, the service was perfect.  Our waiter Tim was very friendly and helpful and always looking after us but not intrusive.  Two managers stopped by our table as well to ask us about our meal and our night.  I'll definitely be back again soon.",0.9466,0.804,0.161,0.035,0.5026041666666667
2007-08-04,5.0,"Went here for dinner and had a great experience. The place wasn't all that busy so we got seated for our reservation right away. The service was absolutely great and the food was excellent as well. We were started off with a basket of assorted breads, which were good. I had the Filet Mignon with the parmesan crusted topping. I have had this before at Wildfire and this was very similar and just as good if not better. The steak was cooked perfectly to how I ordered it. We also got the whipped potato caserole as a side and that was delicious. We were both full after dinner so we skipped on dessert, but they had something that looked delicious that I've never seen before. They had a cookies n cream fondue which is served with assorted fruit, marshmallows, rice krispie treats, and pretzels. Being the sweets lover I am, this sounds delicious and I want to go back and try this sometime.  Overall, this was a great dining experience.
