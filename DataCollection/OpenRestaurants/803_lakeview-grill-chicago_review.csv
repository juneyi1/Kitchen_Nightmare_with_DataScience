It never takes more than 25 minutes for me to receive my food!  They have things ranging from ribs to a half a chicken, as well as build your own pasta and burgers.  One thing I always order is the cheddar mashed potatoes. Why? Becauase they are real mashed potatoes! And amazing! I dont care if it goes with whatever else Im ordering, they are that good! Never had an order get messed up from hear either, and the prices are pretty good. home.uchicago.edu/~chudgâ€¦ That is the website! Now go eat some food!",0.9707,0.767,0.186,0.046,0.6064102564102564
