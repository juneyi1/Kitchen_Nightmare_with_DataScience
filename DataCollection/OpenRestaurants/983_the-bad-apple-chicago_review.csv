There was about a 30 minute wait, so we grabbed some seats at the bar. We ordered cocktails-- I got the Butterbeer, and bf got Subreddit. Both were really interesting. The butter beer, while not creamy, had flavors that were definitely reminiscent of what I imagined from Harry Potter: alcoholic ginger beer mixed with butterscotch schnapps. This drink is perfect for cooler weather. Bf said his was well mixed too. Both $9, pretty normal for cocktails in Chicago.  We then got burgers. Bf got the basic burger, and I got the feta wap. So good!! Burger itself was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The toppings on mine (fried egg, pepper coulis, garlic herb whipped feta, Munster cheese, bacon) worked perfectly together, but be ready for a messy time eating it!

They have a bunch of different types of burgers though so I feel like I need to work my way through their entire burger offerings. I met some of my Yelp friends up for a bite & a pint last week and had a lovely time. Solid service, solid beer list, solid food. Beer prices weren't too bad but their $18 beer flight did seem a bit silly. $18 is verging on madness. I tried the flight though and did enjoy it, but wished there was more direction on the beers (brewery only listed for most). My friends convince me to get the Elvis Last Supper burger for $11. She's a beast (both me and the burger) with bacon and peanut butter smothered on top. It was real good and I'm glad I started my Bad Apple burger escapades with this one. I *always* have left overs when I go out to eat and though my remaining burger tasted great the next day, peanut butter does not microwave well, ha! So...just a light warning if you get this burger....eat it all fresh & in person!

Service was great, and I had multiple people behind the bar check in with me, which I always appreciate. I was overwhelmed by the burger choices but everything sounded sooo good. I was very tempted to try the elvis (with peanut butter and bacon) but I got nervous last minute and pivoted. I opted for the ""grizzly adams"" instead. A perfectly cooked medium burger, topped with braised short rib, caramelized onion, some kind of perfect sauce concoction, all atop a pretzel bun. I was absolutely starving, but my burger excelled my expectations. I always respect a burger that is cooked perfectly, and the short rib was phenomenal. Something you really need to appreciate here is that fries come with the burger! I've found that most places up-charge for that. I had a mini panic attack when asked what topping I wanted on the fries. I was going to go with firecracker, but was told it is incredibly hot, so I played it safe and went with minced garlic. I have no idea what I was expecting, but it was fries with a bunch of chopped up garlic on them, so it was pretty potent. I would definitely go with a better seasoning if I could do it all over again. That being said, I don't always love regular fries, but they knock these out of the park and I ate every last one of them.

(2) The Topping Burger is about everything else you can place around the meat. Bacon, truffle, chillies, onions, veggies, funky delicious stuff, etc. The Bad Apple presents a third type of burger that marries these two components: quality, well-cooked meat, and topping combos to meet your needs.

2017-04-20,5.0,"FORBIDDEN FRUIT This North Center burger bar doesn't fall far from the tree. In fact, I'd say this particular apple is the most succulent variety you'll find anywhere in Chi-town. Â There's absolutely nothing bad or rotten about it. After hearing positive things from fellow Elites (and recommendations from Chicago Eater and Thrillist) I made the trek here on the eve of 4/20 with a hungry dinner companion. Â We were seated immediately on a weeknight around 7pm at a table in the back. Right away I noticed that the dimmed lighting conditions would make it tough on photos but added to the trendy vibe that Bad Apple gives off. Â With a solid 4* across nearly 1,300 reviews to date, my gut instinct told me that I was in for a treat, and boy was I right. Once we picked brews off of their extensive beer & cider menu, we shifted our focus to the big draw: their burgers. Â I counted 13 speciality beef sandwiches, ranging around $10-13, most with clever names like the 'Feta Wap' (whipped feta cheese, pepper coulis) and '#hashtag' (smoked brisket hash on an english muffin). I vacillated between a few options, finally settling on the 'Slow Burn' (stout sautÃ©ed hot chilies and onions, bacon, white cheddar). Â My +1 ordered the 'Little Champion' (chili mac, pepper jack, crispy tortilla strips) and both came with fries; I added firecracker seasoning on mine for an extra 75Â¢. Having asked for my burger to be prepared 'medium', the kitchen rolled out the most picturesque patty I've ever seen. Â Cooked around the exterior with a large band of pink and slight tinge of red, you couldn't ask for better preparation. Â This was crucial, because the burger itself was a goddamn inch thick. Â lolwut A juicy patty griddled to near perfection with simple yet effective toppings. Â As tasty as the fries were, the burger was unquestionably the best I've ever had. Â Better than Au Cheval's, superior to Kuma's, trumping even Lockdown (which now gets runner-up marks in my book). We also ordered the poutine special (bbq gravy, pulled pork) which was delicious. Â Each of us received a different dipping condiment: a homemade honey mustard (really good) and sweet hot sauce (really spicy). The men's room is slightly larger than your household microwave oven. Â Even though it's communal, in reality only 1-1/2 people can fit in there at a given time. Â Also, either the bathroom mirror was some modern art piece intended to be ironic, or it was just some kinda hipster joke that I don't understand (see photo). Our server was nice, but she definitely started off on the wrong foot. Â Moments after greeting us she blurted out ""if you're thinking of getting beer tonight, DON'T GET.......(long pause)"". Â Uhhhhh wtf?? Â She then listed off a handful of taps that'd run out, which happens, and I get it. Â But the way she worded it sounded brash, erratic and a teensy bit odd. Â Not a huge deal but still a peculiar way to introduce us to the beer menu. Bread = 5+ Circuses = 3.5 *TL;DR* Despite a goofy restroom situation and some weirdly uncouth service at the outset, Bad Apple bounced back with a vengeance thanks to their absolutely KILLER food execution. Â All it took was one bite to know that I'd just encountered the best burger in Chicagoland.

2017-04-19,5.0,Love this place. There's always something new to try on the beer menu and the food and service are great. Highly recommend the cheese curds and I love their house-made ketchup.  The only compliant I have is that they don't have the Frenchie on the menu anymore (haven't for a while but I'm finally getting around to writing a review).

2017-04-16,4.0,"This place has some of the best burgers in the city!! They are creative while being approachable as a bar/restaurant.  I love the setup of the restaurant; it can get quite crowded on the weekend, but it still has a cozy feel even when it fills up. My advice with this place: go on a weekday or weekend off-hours. Friday and Saturday are a pain when it comes to getting a table!  The beer list is consistently great! They offer a lot of variety, and they change the menu frequently with the seasons. The food is awesome! I've only had burgers, but they're always delicious! They use high-quality beef, and they know how to properly cook a burger! Sides are tasty; any unique toppings appear to be house-made...in short, the quality is ever-present.  Terrific spot year-round for burgers and unique beer selection!

I ended up ordering the Creole Contender - it is creole crusted fried chicken. chipotle kohlrabi slaw. pickles. chipotle aioli. on a hoagie bun. Being from the East, I would say the bun was a Ciabatta, not a Hoagie but that's okay. The chicken was crisp, juicy and tender - being fried I always worry it will be greasy. But, it was not greasy at all. The creole coating was very mild. I expected something spicier, and it was not. I have to say that the flavor was complimentary and did not overwhelm the taste of the rest of the sandwich. The slaw really added to it - it added texture as well as a slight vinegar flavor. The pickle also added to the mix. Even though the bun was not a real hoagie bun, it still made the sandwich a masterpiece.",0.9854,0.782,0.179,0.039,0.5430335097001764

2017-03-09,4.0,"I would like to preface this review by saying that I am not a huge burger person. I eat burgers probably two to three times a year, typically after a race or ridiculously hard workout. So when my friend suggested ""going out for burgers"" as a Tuesday night activity, I wasn't too excited. We happened to be in the area, and ended up at Bad Apple because it was the most conveniently located and had respectable Yelp reviews. I was immediately happy about the choice when I saw the beer list. They have an awesome rotating draft list, featuring local goodies like 5 Rabbit and Dovetail. Nothing interest you on the draft list? Check on the even more extensive bottle list, and I promise you will find a beer that suits your fancy. Now, the food. I wasn't super excited about the burgers, but figured I would give it a try. I stuck with the basic Bad Apple Burger and my friend ordered the Elvis' Last Supper (Peanut butter on a burger???). I have to say, once I took the first bite of that burger, I was so happy that we had agreed to a Tuesday night of burger-eating. Yes, it was a basic cheeseburger, but man was it cooked perfectly and delicious. I also tried a bite of my friend's burger, and yes, peanut butter on a burger DOES weirdly work.  This is a relaxed place to grab a beer and a good bite to eat if you are in the area. I'm not convinced that I would travel far to get here, but I see myself coming back in the future because I live in the general area.  PS: Come here on your birthday and tell the bartender or the server that it's your birthday. Enjoy the free shot of whiskey and candle to blow out.",0.9926,0.734,0.192,0.074,0.5790322580645161

2017-02-16,5.0,"""We take our customer service very seriously"", - Caitlyn: Host. And that's why I'm on yelp giving them a 5 star review.  It's Valentine's Day, 2017, and my wife agrees that we should have some burgers to celebrate. She googles ""Best Burgers in Chicago"" and we find The Bad Apple. It's close to Uptown - they make their own ketchup - and we have never tried it before!  I call it in for pickup. We ordered the cheese curds, the Bad Apple Burger and The Southern Dandy. I was told the Beer & Cheddar Fondu can only be ordered when dining in, so I set a reminder in my brain to make sure to dine in soon.  Fast forward to me being back in the car, about to drive home with my freshly picked up meals (I can smell the truffle fries and am getting excited), when I realize that they forgot the cheese curds. Time stops - do I say ""forget it"" and drive home with only the burgers? How will my wife react? Will she make me sleep in the car tonight? Did I pay for the cheese curds already? Is it going to be awkward if I go back in and ask about it? ""No - you're right"" - this is about cheese curds on Valentine's Day. This is serious enough to go back and ask about.  That's when they won me over as a customer for the rest of my burger loving life. I walked in, asked about my missing curds, and the host, Caitlyn, took it way more seriously than I thought she would. She sincerely apologized, offered me a seat and a drink while she went to figure out my cheese curd situation. A lady who seemed to be a manager came up to me to apologize and told me the curds will be in my life in the next 5 minutes. When the host came back to the front, I offered her my debit card to settle the bill, and she said ""That won't be needed. The cheese curds are on us tonight.""  The burgers are delicious. The cheese curds are seriously AMAZING. But what impressed me most of all about this place was that they have employees who actually give a sh*t about their customer's experience. The place was busy, I came back in to inquire/complain about not getting my deep fried cheese fix, and they made me feel like I was important to them. So many other places would have fake apologized, called me a pain-in-the-ass behind my back, charged me for my curds, and I wouldn't have had a major reaction.  I'll be back to try that fondu. I'll be ordering the cheese curds again.

The very first thing I have to commend about this place is the service. Every single person, from the hostess, to the waitress, to the bus boy was absolutely fantastic to us. Friendly, quick knowledgable about the EXTENSIVE menu, and polite. On top of this, it all just feels very genuine, not just faked friendliness for the sake of tips. Every single staff member made us feel welcome and like they were happy to speak to us and serve us. The bus boy actually accidentally spilled a small amount of water while trying to take our drink menu from us, complete accident and it was really not a big deal at all, the pool of water was very small and we didn't get wet, and he gave us a free shot to make up for it. Near the end of our night a group of guys was standing next to our table sort of crowded around us and one of the waiters politely reminded them that they were crowding our area. The gentlemen apologized and then before we left the hostess apologized to us for the inconvenience as well. I just could not be happier with the friendliness of the staff. I wish I had asked for their names so I could thank them on here but rest assured, they were all great.  The food is really good, we all got various burgers and all loved the taste, the meat is juicy and flavorful and the toppings fresh. Everything - down to the ketchup is homemade and I commend them for that, it all tastes great.  The drink list like I said - is EXTENSIVE. They have hundreds of beers, and if you cant decide which one you want, the staff is immensely helpful in helping you choose. They know the flavor profiles of each beer and can help you decide based on what you already like.

I ordered the Royale Burger which was way too fatty, literally dripping with butter. The fries were pretty good, but overwhelmingly salty. The house ketchup unfortunately tasted more like marinara sauce too. The only really outstanding item I had were the cheese curds. Yes, they will kill your heart, and yes they are worth it. But don't go out of your way to try this place, it's not worth the trek. In the end though, I can't blame Bad Apple. They did live up to their name.",0.958,0.69,0.204,0.106,0.6249999999999999

Great selection of locally brewed and a knowledgeable staff to point you towards the right direction. I had the ""Royale with Cheese"" burger which comes with mushroom, roasted shallots and truffle compound butter. You had me at truffle butter. And just in case that wasn't enough truffle, I added truffle salt to my side of fries. Truffle, truffle, truffle.

2016-10-31,5.0,"Great burgers and drinks. Superior service. First, the food... Got the Cowboy Killer Burger, with fried egg, meunster cheese, jalapeÃ±o, & bacon baked bean. Flavors were great; I couldn't really taste the jalapeÃ±o, so those considering the dish need not worry about tolerating the spiciness. FYI, the meat is mixed with the jalapeÃ±o so it cannot be put on the side. (Tho, I would've actually preferred more spice, but understand that they may have been trying to cater to the crowd.) Loveed the fries- I prefer mine on the crispier side, and the fries certainly hit the mark while not being too greasy or salty. I wasn't adventurous enough to add additional flavors, but I will have to come back to try again :) Just Encased, sausage links with giardianera, smoked beer infused whole case mustard, was also yummy; my boyfriend and I liked 2/3 of the sausages (one of them was a little too dry for us). The flavor and textures were great and I absolutely fell in love with the giardianera! The giardianera was a little on the spicy side, but it was so amazingly sour and delicious! I just had to ask for an extra serving (which you can get for $0.75). On top of that, the mixed drinks are great- it is definitely a great venue for a date or casual meet up. Beyond the hip atmosphere and the well spaced venue, is their top notch service. You can tell that the staff take their Bad Apple Service motto to heart. Everyone is willing to help each other out, and providing high quality service is a noticeable focus for this group. A few examples: -- While waiting for a table, one of the hosts came over and asked us if we wanted to order something to drink, and ordered for us from the bar -- Seating was arranged to help put more chairs on the side of the table that was facing the TV for a party of 3 so that they could watch the game -- Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. This place is the perfect example of employees who are not too pushy, but are always there when you need something. Â Absolutely love the fact that we can ask other servers passing by for something Overall, the atmosphere, food, and drinks are great... the amazing, notable cherry on the top is its memorable service, which makes Bad Apple truly stand out.",0.9985,0.737,0.232,0.03,0.5571825396825397

2016-10-28,5.0,"I liked this place. I definitely will return. I particularly liked the atmosphere, friendliness and helpfulness of the servers and $5 delicious whiskey sours. You can't beat a $5 cocktail. I was however VERY underwhelmed by the cheese curds. They were not good at all. I don't know what the rage is about, but even the worst place in Wisconsin can make better cheese curds. We left most of them on the plate. Def not worth the calories. The burger was a solid 3.5/5. Cooked perfectly med rare. I don't like fancy shmancy burgers so I just got the regular apple burger with cheddar. I wish the cheddar was yellow and sliced a bit thicker. Bun was good and the meat was seasoned well and juicy without being sloppy. Not the best burger I've ever had but it was satisfying and I'd order it again in a heartbeat. I had a house salad instead of fries and it was amazing. For just a little old house salad it was the best thing I ate there. I don't really remember what was in it( corn and beans I think?) but it was fantastic. I went with tha hubs and 5 yo daughter. We were seated in the ""kid"" area, it has a boat load of board games, tv and arcade...comes with separate bathroom for that side of the restaurant. Even though we weren't close to the bar and all the action, it was still good people watching.

Interesting and tasty toppings, and BIG. Honestly, I think I've taken partial burgers home as leftovers probably every single time I've come here. Though to be honest, that's probably because of the cheese curds. Oh, those cheese curds. No thick, chewy breading with only partially melted curd inside here. Oh no. These are big curds in a thin, tempura-style coat, the batter barely containing the glorious flood of molten cheese inside. And the homemade buttermilk ranch dressing they come with?

So, once we got there we were surprised on how nice it was. I mean they have pictures and stuff but it was really nice, we looked around and we liked the paintings and how everything was set up. So kudos to that. I loved how the menus are places, the options on the burgers and beers were pretty dope. The even let me sample 3 beers to help me decide which beer to have. they recommended my date a mix drink and she looooved it. I order the Cowboy Killer and it was pretty good, well cooked and prepared, it was good. My date also enjoyed the burger , which was the bad apple burger. they only thing were kind bummed about were the fries. They were good but the ""seasoning "" they give out wasn't much, so it was like eating fries without salt and with very little seasoning.

2016-07-24,4.0,"Very much a hipster burger place with an excellent selection of craft beers, The Bad Apple delivers a fun, interesting, and delicious place to eat and drink. After a day of touristing (is that word? I'm making it a word), I really had a hankering for a good local burger joint. Fortunately, The Bad Apple was within walking distance, and immediately upon surveying their delicious-sounding burger menu that was only a few puns shy of full Bob's Burgers, I knew I had to give it a try. It's pretty much a hipster's dream restaurant, with alternative art on the walls, a good selection of craft beers, and a staff of hip young people.  The menu is burgers and comfort food, along with a couple of surprises. I came with a large group of people, so we tried the Fried Cheese curds ($8), the Poutine ($8), and the Pickled Platter ($7). The fried cheese curds squeaked (so you know it's good) and delivered a savory morsel of melt-in-your-mouth cheese encased in a hot and crispy deep fried breaded shell of heaven. The star of the poutine were those veggie meatballs - so savory. Only order the picked platter if you're into pickled stuff already, which I totally am and was able to try pickled carrots to pickled grape tomatoes (the latter was...interesting).  For my main course, I picked the Figs Is In burger ($11 - it was between that and Sloths on Parade), which had Tyranena Chief Blackhawk porter, fig & bacon relish, goat cheese and smoked onion, along with a side of house fries with minced garlic. I was actually a little disappointed in the burger, which came out well done (I ordered medium) and was too dry and lacking that juicy flavor any burger needs. There was also too little sweet fig to cut the overwhelming goat cheese. The fries also underwhelmed - a bit too oily when they should be crispy, and the minced garlic was just placed on top, not tossed with the fries, thus you got fries with no garlic or with an overwhelming amount. On the bright side, I was able to try a brilliant Saison from a craft brewery - definitely take advantage of the beer list here. Overall, I'd come back to The Bad Apple in a heartbeat, as I think some of my complaints may be just from the night. Otherwise, they have all the ingredients to make this THE burger place in the neighborhood.",0.9771,0.829,0.118,0.053,0.5751138716356108

Â This thing was delicious, interesting, and held together reasonably well. Is it *Kuma* level? I'm not sure. But if you like your burgers meaty rather than crispy, this is top two.

There were only a few people inside and it wasn't crowded, only a couple hours from closing time. We sat in the back corner of the place and started out with some beers. I had a Southern Tier 2X double milk stout, it was very creamy and delicious. We started with the cheese curds and wow these were amazing. Forget Culver's cheese curds, these things were made in house and fresh out of the fryer. Gooey, cheesy and delicious with The Bad Apple's homemade ketchup, I really really enjoyed these curds. I had the chupacabra burger which was white cheddar, braised goat chili, roasted garlic and guacamole. Everything on here blended together wonderfully. The braised chili with guacamole was a particularly good combination that worked surprisingly well with a meaty burger. I personally thought the fries were decent, but not out of this world after paying an extra $0.75 for the truffle seasoning. Our server was super down to earth and very helpful in taking our orders and giving recommendations. I forget her name but she was great!

2016-06-22,5.0,"Was surprised to see I hadn't written a review for Bad Apple, so righting that wrong now. Bad Apple is our go to neighborhood place. There are so many things to recommend this place. - Great for kids. Kid's menu has some great options, my son loves the granola, which is a great option on a kids menu. Parties that include kid's are usually seated in the side room, so you have to worry less about upsetting adult diners. The side room also has games as well. BA is one of the few places I can think of that supports kids and adult dining really well. - Food is always consistent. Some very imaginative options. I've rarely veered away from Slow Burn because its spicy and not a meat on meat option. - Beer. Huge number of options, and very reasonably priced. - Patio. Lots of places have a street patio, but theirs is on the side off of Lincoln, which makes it much quieter than most street patios. Was there last night and it was great. - Service. This is the biggest thing for me. They do a team service approach where anyone passing by can grab you a drink, take your order etc. I could see it being chaotic, but BA have perfected it.",0.9388,0.79,0.146,0.065,0.5315277777777777

The Fig and the Lamb variants were totally unique, absolutely incredible, 5 stars.The Grizzly was really really good, 4 stars. We've also had the quinioa salad which was refreshing and delicious but the portion a bit paltry and the Cobb salad which was indescribably good, probably the best I've had anywhere and a unique take on the classic. They are paying attention to small details that really sets it apart from some other similar joints. For instance, the huge and perfectly ripe chunk of avocado on the Cobb salad was seasoned perfectly, not just thrown on top with no treatment. Little things like that make a big difference. Our to-go orders have been nicely assembled for transport and the containers they use are recyclable, a nice touch.

Went here on a weeknight and there was no wait for a table for two. Hung out at the bar to wait for my date, and I chatted up the bartender and some local patrons. Both were friendly and knowledgeable about the beer selections. Speaking of, they have a vast and well-curated draft list that includes both local options and national treats. I had a chocolate peanut butter stout and a Belgian sour, both of which were amazing. The food really drove it home. I had the Even Cowgirls Get the Blues burger. Guys, this burger...it gives Au Cheval a run for its money. Juicy, excellent toasted brioche, thick but won't fall apart in your hands: it was simply amazing. Paired with sweet onion jam, savory bacon, sour malt vinegar, and subtle funky blue cheese, this was an outstanding burger. As a blue cheese fan, I could have had a little more, but I understand that they wanted to create a more delicate balance.  The pickle tray was also very good, with a wide variety of pickled veggies.  The atmosphere was hip and pub-like (dark wood floors and paneling). Nice enough for a date, but relaxed enough that I felt at home in my jeans and messy shirt. The clientele is also pretty hip. Overheard a man sitting next to us telling his date how a movie he'd watched was indie and pretentious, but he loved it because (to quote him) ""I'm a little pretentious, too.""

And it was still a delicious burger regardless. But she apologized and I told her she shouldn't be the one to apologize because she doesn't control what comes out the kitchen. Thats the chefs job. She asked me if I wanted to switch it out and I said it was fine and I'm way to hungry to wait especially after taking my first bite into the el chupacabra.

There are many vegetarian options, including vegetarian poutine. We sat outside today, which was nice. It seems like a lot of parents also take their kids here - they have a kid menu. The food here is affordable - $9 for a veggie burger and pretty much $11/$12 for all their other burgers. All the dishes include fries, which you can upgrade for 75 cents more. I wanted to get their charcuterie & cheese plate, which was a great deal at $15 for 2 cheese and 3 cured meats - will try to get it next time! We got the cheese curds, which were solid and a good portion for $8. I got the La Chupacabra, which was delicious, whereas my friend got the Strange Famous (veggie burger). For any of the burgers, you can sub a veggie patty in place of a beef burger patty. While I liked my burger, my friend was not a fan of his veggie burger. You can also change up the cheeses on your burger for any of the other cheeses that they have on their menu, which is great! We also added seasoning to our fries for 75 cents more - I got the spicy chipotle and my friend got the truffle seasoning. The truffle seasoning is definitely worthwhile, but the spicy chipotle wasn't that great and I probably won't get it again.  Servers and the outside seating were both great - inside is a bit dark.

However, various staff members never exuded any rudeness and rather always offered if we needed another drink or if we had been helped yet while waiting for our table. After being seated, our waitress was quite accommodating and took care of our large group rather graciously.  I got the 'Grizzly Adams' with firecracker fries. I also got to try the 'Cowboy Killer' with garlic fries and the Montreal poutine. I definitely recommend upgrading the fries to one of the seasonings ($0.75 extra). I almost did not, thinking it was unnecessary but they really enhanced the fries which are seasoned liberally. The garlic was amazing with chopped fresh pieces on top. The firecracker was also very tasty with just enough heat. The fries itself were perfectly crispy and golden on the outside and soft on the inside. They also weren't too thick or thin. I also enjoyed the poutine very much. The gravy wasn't overly salty or heavy which was great. The burgers were definitely good. I was very relieved that they were cooked perfectly as well. While I prefer my burgers to be more simple and earthy, they do what they do well. Side note: For this style of burger, I do prefer their burgers over Kuma's. While I enjoyed the burgers, I could not really distinguish much between all the toppings, which I guess isn't uncommon for a burger with that much going on.

2016-04-16,5.0,"Six Words: Great service, beer selection, and food! I may have just found my new favorite restaurant it's name is The Bad Apple. I came here on a Sunday night with some friends. I had scoped the menu and yelp reviews before so I knew I would be in for a good evening of food. I just didn't realize how good the evening would be. Let me explain.  My friends and I, when together, can be loud and difficult. We're not horrible people but we just are loud and get easily distracted. We also are all trying to be beer people but don't know enough to be actual beer people. So helping us decide on a beer is usually quite the endeavor. And the servers were so helpful. Recommending us things, giving us samples. It was great. At one point my friend told a server that she had a Corona the night before and didn't hate that so something like that please? And he made an A-Ha! face and he came back with a few options to sample that she enjoyed. Again, great service. And I say servers. Because we had a few. Because they do team serving. So whoever was closest would help us. And someone was always close - to get us more water, to take a plate away, to get us more napkins, to check on a rogue craft soda bottle that had fallen, etc. Someone was always there. And it was great.  The food was also incredible. We ordered poutine (not the special) and it was everything I wanted. The gravy wasn't overpowering and the cheese was delicious. We all ordered burgers and gosh they were incredible. I ordered the Cowboy Killer (fried egg. muenster cheese. jalapeÃ±o & bacon baked beans on a pretzel bun) and I demolished it. I normally take pictures of my food (for Yelp purpses I promise!) but the moment the burger was in front of my face it was in my mouth.  Overall, it was a great experience.

From the moment I walked in the door, I was impressed with the service.  Granted, this is a really hipstery place. It looks like a total divey sports bar when you enter. Â Not really my scene in terms of locale, either, but I typically enjoy being pulled out of my comfort zone and I was not disappointed in the least. Â  The cocktail list was impressive, the selection of beers-- phenomenal. While I am not a beer drinker personally, I certainly appreciate a place that features such a robust offering. And the food...wow. I tried the ""truffle shuffle"" burger, and it was about as good a burger as I had ever had. Delicious truffle fries accompanied my burger, and I found myself wanting to lick the plate. I had to give this place five stars for the excellent food, excellent service and outstanding liquor offering.  Don't come here looking for ambience, unless you're a big fan of a more rustic aesthetic. Come here ready to eat some excellent food. Oh, and their prices are exceptionally reasonable. A burger and fries will cost you as little as $10-- a bargain, in my book. So so good, will definitely return.",0.9976,0.67,0.3,0.031,0.63046768707483

I got the waygu burger, Â the notorious D.O.G., and one other that was essentially a spin on a cuban with 3 different types of porks. The waygu burger was absolutely amazing. Had I gotten just this I would have given this place a 5 without a doubt. The cuban was way over powered by the mustard, and the notorious dog just lacked a lot of flavor. It was decent, but nothing spectacular. My friend and I also ordered the truffled fries. They came as regular fries, dusted with a ""truffle salt"". the truffle flavor was pretty much undetectable, and my friend ordered some more truffle salt on the side with them. This fixed the problem, but unfortunately made them too salty. Definitely opt for another seasoning, or none at all. I'd go back, but would definitely go with the waygu or another burger.

You get consistent high quality in everything you eat. It's always the best option for any group of adventurous or picky eaters, and the staff are pros at splitting up checks.

The wait staff are also among the most clean and thorough you've ever seen. Seriously. Count how many seconds your discarded paper napkin ring stays on the table. (Never more than two minutes, tops.)

It's probably my favorite Chicago burger (granted I have not had the patience to get into Au Cheval yet)! The fries can be seasoned with a large variety of different flavors. I got the ranch fries, but when the garlic fries arrived, I immediately regretted my decision.

The food selection is mostly burgers and sandwiches, but what they do, they do well. Â Let's start with the cheese curds. Â Phenomenal. Â Our table ended up ordering a second batch we liked it so much. Â I had the Elvis's Last Supper, a burger that's topped with thick bacon and homemade peanut butter. Â As they say on the menu ""trust us it's good."" If you're in the Lincoln Square area or are willing to travel, it's worth the stop.

2015-09-23,5.0,"Located in the hoppin' Lincoln Square The Bad Apple has all of the ingredients to make for a sweet and juicy experience. My experience at The Bad Apple was anything but rotten and in fact my fiancÃ© and I indulged in all of its glorious temptations, ranging from the extensive beer list to the appetizers and sinful-sounding Â burgers. Â The Bad Apple, like many others burger joints throughout this great city, has made itself known for the extravagantly concocted burgers that are piled higher than what your mouth can bit into. Â After much debate, I settled on the Cowboy Killer which was extremely juicy and flavorful which looked as sinful as it tasted. Â They really do cook their burgers to perfection there, but only as long as you order it as a burger should be ordered -medium rare. Â  Before you delve into that oh-so-tempting Â burger you must order some appetizers, specifically the poutine. Â the poutine is this Canadian dish where you get fries covered in gravy and cheese curds. Â It has a very distinct taste that you will greatly enjoy if you like any or all of those ingredients. Â We also got the regular cheese curd appetizer which was just as good. Â Altogether this made for a great food experience. Â The cherry on top of all this food was the beer. Â They have a lot of great beers here along with several that are constantly rotating. Â I'd say that they have several beers that other pubs do not have so if you're looking for something different to wash your burgers down with then you're in luck. Â  The service at The Bad Apple was great - the host sat us near the back of the restaurant where our waitress came over to us right away. Â In addition to this, our appetizers and burger came out in an extremely timely manner - thankfully because we were starving! Â After having this meal my fiancÃ© and I were set for the rest of the night and we left with smiles on our faces because everything was cooked and served so perfectly.",0.9944,0.739,0.183,0.078,0.5128531309959883

He picked one that had a pineapple base and a cute game-of-thrones-ish name - they made one non-alchi version for him and he enjoyed it so he asked for another. She told him that they couldn't do that because they didn't want to waste the mix for someone who wasn't paying the three extra dollars for booze. I think customer service is a bit more important than a three dollar shot of tequila, however - that's fine. We would have been totally happy if there had been a follow-up suggestion of a different drink for him to order, or the explanation that he could just pay the regular price.... Instead there was nothing but awkward, stiff rudeness and the feeling that we had somehow put her out. (The rest of the table had also been drinking regular cocktails - so, it's not like we were just coming in to steal their pineapple juice...that we were paying for...whatever.)

I used to carpool to work everyday with a close friend of mine and he ALWAYS talked about the Bad Apple and how the burgers were some of the best in town. He insisted that I have dinner and drinks at the Bad Apple, so after a few year of waiting, I finally went.  We started with the cheese curds. I went to school in WI and my gf is from WI, so we have high standards for cheese curds. These were actually pretty good, I'd give them 4 stars out of 5. We both ordered burgers, but it was about 6 months ago so I can't remember which ones we ordered. The pretzel bun was great, it's really tough to find a better type of bun than the pretzel bun in my opinion. The meat was over cooked for a medium-rare burger, it was much closer to medium-well. Instead of having them cook me another burger, I just bit the bullet and stuck with the overcooked one. I thought it was OK, but certainly nothing that would make me tell my friends about it (even though I'm telling all of you, and you're my friends). It was an average burger.  The bartender was really friendly and didn't hesitate to give beer suggestions. He made small talk with us at the bar and seemed genuinely interested.

2015-05-21,3.0,"Ended up at the Bad Apple a few Friday nights ago for dinner. I had high expectations of the spot based on what I've heard from friends and read in reviews but found the experience to be fairly disappointing.  The meal started out on a high note, we were seated right away and had two great servers (one in-training) who gave us helpful suggestions on choosing beers off of their large list.  There were two couples in our group so we opted to go big on the appetizers (we were starving!) and split burgers. For apps we went with the Fried Cheese Curds and the Beer & Cheddar Fondu both were spot on and are the reason this review made it to three stars. Let me just say that as a girl that loves her dipping sauces, The Bad Apple is spot on in this department.  The perfectly battered and fried curds came with an awesome buttermilk ranch that made me want to devour the entire bowl. The fondue that accompanied the pretzels was also spot on and had just the right amount of kick to it. My only qualm with that appetizer was the portion size, I think our group of four could've easily each consumed two of these.  As you could probably guess the burgers were where this place fell short for me. My boyfriend and I chose ""The Slow Burn"" and to me the burger was not particularly large or juicy and lacked seasoning. The fries were equally disappointing and I found the meal as a whole to be totally underwhelming. I guess I was full when I left but by no means was I satisfied...

The hostess seamed to be overwhelmed and not sure what she was doing- I'm not sure if maybe she was new, or what the situation was, but it got a little frustrating because tables were open, but we were just left standing there until she came back from talking to another employee for a while. The food was good- I was SO full from it. Burgers were delicious. I ordered the truffle fries with it though and my only complaint is that they were WAY too salty (and I love my salt).

My husband at the whole burger and our mate ate all of his sausage; both remarked that they like them. I had a good stout on nitro (which is important for their creamy factor).  A few mix drinks were had and I have to say they were both just gross (the Umbrella drink and the Peaches & Whiskey)--I would stick to beer or your own liquor combinations that you like (i.e vodka soda, rum and coke, etc). Finally, in the past, we've not been able to be seated without the whole party, which for our group has been a problem, because we have some people that will come to meet us after we've been somewhere for 30 to 45 minutes. At The Bad Apple, we have had to wait for 45 minutes, while tables are available, because we are waiting on one person that gets off work later than everyone else.

While I have been in Chicago for a little over a year, this was my first Poutine experience and I thought it was pretty decent.  For my meal, I decided to forgo a burger (even though that is what they are known for) for their Italy vs Mexico sandwich. The sandwich is comprised of porchetta rubbed down with ancho mole and topped with pineapple, salsa verde, and other spices. Great great flavor contrasts in this meal. The pork was seasoned well and the sweetness of the pineapple mixed in well with the mole seasoning. I really should have taken a picture of it but I started eating way too fast.

2015-03-27,4.0,"There is a good reason that the wait on Saturday night around 7:00 was an hour and a half, and if you happen to arrive during that time, my recommendation is to put your name in and wait. It'll be worth it. I made it here on a couple different nights at a couple different times. We had the convenience of being able to walk here from where we were staying, but it looked like there was street parking around the area. The street that this business is on also hosts a lot of other bars and restaurants, and it is a fun area where you can go bounce around to a handful of places in the same spot. We actually made it in here for the first time later on Friday night and we walked right in and got a table. It's really nice that their kitchen is open late so you can satisfy those cravings that seem to come after a few beers. The restaurant has a bar area that was a little more crowded, and then a couple dining areas that felt more like a restaurant setting. If you come here and need to put in your name, they will take down your phone number and call a little bit before they expect to be able to seat you, so you are free to wander around the area and grab a beer somewhere less crowded until your table opens up, which was our situation on Saturday at dinner. The menu is amazing, and is probably not for those that are faint of heart. It's a lot of burgers and sandwiches, along with a short list of salads and plenty of delicious appetizers. Their southwestern cob salad was delicious, but it was hard telling it was an actual salad since they pile on so many toppings. The burger and sandwich menu was extremely difficult to narrow down to one selection. They definitely like putting a spin on the usual offerings, and their topping combinations are second to none. I got the Grizzle Adams burger, which comes topped with braised short rib that was delicious, caramelized onions, and an ale, stone ground mustard, jalapeÃ±o, and sharp cheddar cheese sauce all served on a pretzel bun. The burger itself was great and it was cooked to order, but the combination of those toppings all piled on in a very generous serving put it over the top. The other standout that made it to our table was the Edmund Fig-Gerald burger which is perfect for people who like some sweetness with their savory with its fig and bacon relish, goat cheese, and smoked onion. All of these burgers and sandwiches are in the $10-$12 range, and come with a large serving of house cut fries. I don't know what was different about it, but their ketchup was very good. It tasted homemade, and was a more sweet and tangy than the stuff I am used to. There were easily a handful of other amazing sounding options that I was torn between, so this will definitely be a spot I need to make it back to. As good as their food is, they definitely also stand out in the beer category. Their list of things of tap was pretty extensive, but their list of things in bottles was huge. Their prices were ok for standard stuff, but their prices for some of the better beers were pretty crazy, even with them being limited offerings. I see lots of places raise prices or drop the serving size of similar beers, but they did both here. The thing that drove me crazy, and the thing I hope they figure out, is better managing their beer list. I assume they turn beers over quickly, which is great for knowing there will be something new each time you visit, but I kept ordering beers that they didn't have either because we weren't told what was out until we already looked through the menu and decided, or because they forgot to tell us one that was empty when they rattled through the list the first time. That or they just didn't have the bottle options on the menu actually in stock. When you run out of something, just tell the wait staff to take the 10 seconds to mark it off on the menus when they put them on the table. It would take less time than having to run through the list of things that are out each time they seat someone or going back to check whether they actually have it each time. The service we had was a little hit and miss. On Friday night when it wasn't that busy we were seated in a table way back in the corner and I think our servers kind of forgot about us. Definitely not what I would expect from a restaurant even if we were just getting some appetizers and beers. It was better Saturday night and I think relative to how busy it was, they did a great job. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that our service Saturday was more indicative of their usual offering. This place is definitely worth another visit to sit down for a dinner and get some more of their amazing food, but I might venture off to one of the surrounding bars that are less hectic and cheaper if I am just out looking for a beer.",0.9994,0.804,0.167,0.028,0.4791668921356422

That's right, the cheese curds, we could both live off of those.  I tried the slow burn and the bad apple burger, well, we shared. Those were the least of my favorite, I would not get them again. I didn't feel like the slow burn really had a burn and the bad apple burger could be a little better considering the rest of the menu.  The second time we went for our April 2014 GNO pick and with a group of 7 ladies, I was kind of worried we wouldn't get in. To my surprise we got in and only waited 10 minutes for our table! Yay!  That particular night, 4 of us decided to get a burger and a side and then we split the burgers into 4 and shared them. That's one of the reasons I like going out with a diverse group, we can share and try a lot off the menu.  Of course we got about 3 orders of cheese curds (Duh!), poutine, truffle fries and garlic fries. EVERYONE loved the curds. The poutine was not as good as we all had expected and the fries were ok. As far as burgers are concerned, we got the Grizzly Adams which was topped with short rib and caramelized onion; the Rick Ross topped with an aioli, marmalade and arugula; El Chupacabra topped with goat chili and goat cheddar and Elvis' Last Supper, topped with bacon and peanut butter.  Surprisingly enough I really like the Elvis because the peanut butter just gave it an extra delicious flavor. My favorite was the Grizzly Adams. I've gone back now plenty of times and had their cheese curds (which are the best I've ever had), and all kinds of different burgers. They do rotate their menu which I think is fantastic!! Their beer menu is like no other. I've tried beers here that I could not get anywhere else and that's one of the reasons I keep coming back, well that and the cheese curds.

2014-10-16,3.0,"Less is More I found myself thinking that less is more while I was eating my burger at The Bad Apple. I ordered the King Beef because I like beef and I love horseradish. Well I guess it doesn't do me no good with a burger because it was certainly nothing to write home about. It was served on a pretzel bun. Now I love a nice hot salted pretzel, but this is the second time in my life that I had a burger on a pretzel bun, and both times the burger or the bun seemed extremely salty, and I'm a salt fiend. I thought about ordering the Brave Blue World because I have in the past enjoyed some blue cheese burger assemblages and because ""Ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches,"" but I thought I'd give something new a shot. Roast beef with burger just didn't work for me. I don't think I want to waste anymore food trying to try all these crazed burgers with all the bells and whistles and the kitchen sink. Lettuce, tomato, onion, and mustard please. No fuss. I want to taste my beef burger. The employees we encountered were all very pleasant people. You have to love that. My friend who never does drink no beer never, asked our server what beer he would recommend. Some kind of a bind to a muthaphucka in, wouldn't you say? The waiter asked what kind of beer he was interested in, to which my friend replied something sweetish, flavorful and some other ""I sound like I know what I'm talking about"" gibberish. If I were the waiter, I'd have told him to just have a phuckin' Coke. The waiter was actually being trained, so his waitress teacher said she'd bring out a couple of samples for my friend, which she did, and all of them tasted like everything except for muthaphuckin' beer.

Even in spry youth, I had never crushed a marathon in less than 8 hours. At that pace, it's no longer clear who is crushing what. In her honor, my friend's boyfriend, who is an old school Chicago eating expert, invited us to one of the city's legendary hamburger homes, the Bad Apple. They accommodated our party and the beer service began. Their list has some neat beers, and must be about new stuff because I had never even seen Pipeworks on draft before. My friend's mother Mary was in town to support the run that weekend and we met for the first time. The night before I had a stress dream about Syria. It was like Xoco and Kobani intersected in the stress sector of my subconscious. Not wanting to make a weird impression on Mary, I held my tongue while we destroyed the cheese curds. They were golden and fluffy, some of the best cheese curds I've ever eaten. As any marathon runner will tell you, one of the most stressful scenarios would be self-defecating in public on race day. To celebrate overcoming those odds, my friend got a Hot Brown. These poutine fries, rich and complex, are named after a famous sandwich from Louisville, Kentucky. The burger was pretty unbelievable. The grass fed LaFrieda beef was perfectly pink and juices oozed out into the pretzel bun with every bite. I got the Slow Burn, meaning my burger was topped with spicy chiles that had been cooked down in dark beer. The flavors intensified but never into the orange zone, nevermind the red zone.

2014-07-20,5.0,"First thing's first: Â check out the beer & drink menu the second you sit down. Â It's an encyclopedia of choices, so you're going to need some time to peruse and ultimately decide. Â  I started with a Temperance Greenwood Beach, which I also tried at Bigby's about a week prior. Â It's a lighter beer that reminds me of Leiny's Summer Shandy, only more refreshing and less tart. Â It's a perfect summer beer and great with a burger. The cheese curds are the BEST cheese curds I've had anywhere. Â They are so good it made me ashamed to admit that I have repeatedly eaten them at Culver's. Â The batter is crispy and greasy, and the cheese is squeaky and also greasy - just as cheese curds should be. Â I would come back here just to get an order of cheese curds. Â  My burger was pretty good. Â The Edmund Fig-Gerald was topped with fig & bacon relish, goat cheese, and smoked onions. Â I don't particularly like onions, so the waitress offered to put them on the side for me. Â While I ate the burger, I got a few mouthfuls of just bun and fig. Â I think the fig & bacon relish would have been better if it wasn't as chunky and had been put through a food processor like a salsa. Â It could have used more goat cheese too. Â  All of the burgers are served with fries, and I love what they've got going on here. Â You can choose a seasoning for your fries, and since I love truffle and my friend Aimee M. recommended it, I didn't hesitate. Â The fries are delicious, I wish I had more of them! I was a little disappointed to hear about their ""shortage"" of pretzel buns, so I wasn't allowed to substitute, but it didn't ruin my meal. My burger was very good, but I wasn't blown away by it like I was the cheese curds or fries.

That's just what I did on one lazy Sunday afternoon after catching a movie over at the Music Box on Southport. Â My wife and I were greeted immediately after we walked in. Â It was a decent size crowd, but nothing overwhelming. Â We requested to be seated in the bar area to watch the Bulls playoff game, request granted! Â Started off perusing their extensive beer menu, opted for a Akari Shogun from the Half Acre Brewery located across the street. (You should really go there as well!)  Next up we ordered the Montreal Poutine which is a decent size portion of fries with delicious gravy and cheese curds on top. Â Really good and not an overwhelming amount because I was here to have a burger. Opted for the Bad Apple burger which is their basic burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and provolone. Â They had a lot more exotic burgers on the menu that I will be sure to try at a later date. Â The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted out of this world! Â Surely one of the best burgers I have had in Chicago. Â The atmosphere here is fun and the service was terrific. Next time you are on Lincoln Ave. make sure you carve out some time for The Bad Apple, you won't be disappointed!",0.9899,0.797,0.156,0.047,0.6036324786324786

I got there a little early so I sat at the bar and was greeted warmly and got my drink (Butterbeer!) within minutes. Â Our dinner server--I forgot his name--was just amazing. The beer list is massive but he was so knowledgeable about the brews and gave a lot of suggestions based on what some of the gals liked/disliked when it came to brews. He and his assistant (I think he was training someone) checked on of often, split up the bill for us (wha??? so very cool), super friendly and funny and probably one of the nicest servers I've had in a restaurant.  And the food? Pretty damn good. Come with people who like to share because there's tons to try on the menu! We tried a few appetizers and 4 of us ordered different burger/fry combinations and split them up so we had a great sampling! My favorites:  Fried Cheese Curds--crispy with a light beer batter coating and chewy cheese just melts in your mouth. Â Heaven.  El Chupacabra--Starts with an All-Natural Beef Patty topped with braised goat chili, roasted garlic purÃ©e, goat's milk cheddar, avocado crema. Delicious flavor all throughout.  Elvis Last Supper--Again, starts with an All-Natural Beef Patty but this one is topped with bacon & peanut butter. The menu said ""trust us"" and we did and I loved it. Different but good. Â Not sweet, just savory with bacon and roasted peanut flavor. Yum! My favorite fries were the Truffle Fries and the Garlic Fries. No vampires came near me that night. Lots of minced garlic on those fries. And the Truffle was just enough for aroma and flavor--earthy and savory. Very good.  The other items I tried were good, just not my favorite favorites but do deserve a mention:  Grizzly Adams Burger topped with braised short rib, caramelized onion and an ale, stone ground mustard, jalapeno & sharp cheddar sauce on a pretzel bun. The braised short rib was delicious.  The Rick Ross topped with an aged beef & thyme aioli, fennel marmalade, arugula on a focaccia bun. Well made but the thyme and focaccia made taste a little herbacious for my taste.  What I'd take a pass on:  Montreal Poutine. Â I got spoiled by the folks at Bad Happy so I wasn't too fond of this poutine. It was just OK, not high on the wow factor.  Warm Goat Cheese Fondue.

2014-04-15,3.0,"I liked the Bad Apple more than I thought I would. It was prime kids' hour at the BA when we arrived at about 6:45 on a Friday evening. We were quoted a 45 minute wait for a table and made our way to the bar area, which was also crowded. We appreciated that we didn't have to fight our way to place a drink order because the bartender immediately stepped out from behind the bar, drink menu in hand, to ask us what we'd like. Despite it being a haven for craft beer, I stuck with mixed drinks, which I enjoyed very much. The first being the ""Cucumbersome"" (Effen cucumber vodka, lemongrass simple syrup and soda) and the second was a ""Winter Collins,"" which added blood orange juice to a traditional Collins. Both were very tasty and fairly priced at $7. We only ended up waiting about 20 minutes, and the host was ready to seat us. I told him that we needed to close out our tab and he said they'd transfer it over. I explained that they were holding my credit card and he said he'd bring it to me as well. It seemed that they were very focused on customer service. I knew we'd have to order the cheese curds everyone raves about, and they were as good as everyone proclaims. Burgers also seemed to be in order, but against my nature, I opted for the ""Earthly"" sandwich instead. It's everything I love in a vegetarian sandwich: mixed sautÃ©ed mushrooms, spinach, caramelized onions, and goat cheese on rosemary focaccia. So satisfying, I didn't miss the meat at all. Vegetarian options abound. My companion ordered a burger and was very pleased. All the requisite toppings were well-balanced, and more importantly, the burger was cooked exactly as ordered. (I'm always surprised at how many burger emporiums fail to cook a burger to its proper temperature.) Hand-cut fries, which can be fancified with a variety of seasonings for a slight upcharge, also excel.  Service was very efficient. Our food was well-paced, we were served drink refills swiftly and didn't wait for our check to be brought or settled.

We tried the veg poutine- bless their soul- it's just so yumm. Then we ordered the mushroom truffle burger (with veggie patty). This one was a bit dry compared to some better patties I have had however it was pretty good. Then we ordered their special veggie burger which had goat cheese(sold!) and pickled onions on top. Mouthwatering and delectable. Now it doesn't end there. We decided the substitute fries with their sides of rasta slaw and the broccoli bites. Oh I have never tasted such good broccoli in my life.

2014-04-06,5.0,"HOLY FLAVOR EXPLOSION!!!! For my 150th Yelp review I want to do a good one for a good place. Â I went here last night looking for another good burger, and since Chicago is loaded with good burgers I had many choices to choose from. Â When me and my brother came up with the decision to come to Bad Apple we based it upon the fact that they serve the hard to find in Chicago, Montreal Poutine, a Canadian cuisine and one of the very few Canadian culinary contributions to the entire culinary world. Â We had heard Bad Apple had a good burger but we saw no other reason to set them apart from other burger joints, so it was definitely the lure of the Poutine that drew us to take the trek to the north side and try this dish of fries mixed with gravy and cheese curds. When we arrived at 5:30 P.M. there was a wait. Â We were quoted 15-20 min, they did indeed need all 20 min, but my goodness, the host actually gave us an update and not only that, he wanted to seat us so he grabbed towels and everything and cleaned a spot for us, we definitely Â appreciated the service that he provided, and he went the extra mile. Â Our waiter was a friendly guy that was decently tentative so no problems there, ok enough about the service let's talk food and let me tell you why I put up an exited headline with exclamations. We started off ordering the Montreal Poutine of course which was the main reason for coming in the first place. Â Man was it good with creamy delicious gravy that you could just drink, in fact, the waiter made a joke asking if we would like gravy shots, I wish he was serious I would have taken a few shots of that stuff LOL. Â In summary the Poutine was amazing. Â We were a little concerned because we saw burgers coming out that were dark in color like they were slightly burnt of overcooked, so we were concerned the burger was going to be no big deal here, but hey at least we got our Poutine! Â Well we decided to order burgers anyway, and we both chose the El Chupacabra burger. Â We requested the burgers be cooked medium rare. Â Later on those burgers came out ( as pictured below). Â The burger is topped with a braised goat chili, roasted garlic puree, goat's milk cheddar cheese that actually is put on as a liquid, and also liquid avocado as you can see in my picture. Â we ordered these because it sounded damn good. Now I need a separate paragraph to explain the experience of eating the El Chupacabra. Â I took a bite and a huge flavor fist punched me right in my face with a big right hook, wow! Â The flavor of the cheese and the goat chili was amazing as hell! Â My taste buds were soaring with happiness. Â I looked at the burger after I took a bite and the meat looked grey inside so I thought to myself ""dammit they overcooked it,"" but I said oh well the beef is still grass fed and good tasting and the items that top it will make it alright and compensate for the overcook. Â Well as I took another bite and another, the burger got pinker and pinker the further I chewed in! Â This is science, burger science, allow me to explain. Â You see this burger was cooked at a really high temp then shortly after awhile you reduce the heat, you will effectively add a light charred sear around the surface of the burger which will trap juices on the inside of the burger. Â Then after you reduce the temp it will cook the inside at just the right temp and trap all those juices on the inside which created a non messy, and hidden juices inside the meat you can't see but you can taste. Â I would almost bet cash money that Bad Apple uses this difficult cooking method (do not even bother trying this method at home unless you are a professional chef with pro equipment or you will fail) Â You actually need a special cooker to cook a burger this way. Â This was burger science and this burger tasted better the more you bit into it which was important to me because I became quite full toward the end of the burger. Â I was truly blown away and I will come back here, as this is more on the top of my list of best Chicago burgers. Â Oh and yes the fries, I almost forgot. Â They are fresh cut fries and you get a choice of seasonings you want for an extra .75 cents, I got the fresh garlic on my fries and it was damn good, but it will give you bad breath so watch out if you are on a date LOL. Â My brother had the truffle seasoning and he said it was not that great and I tried it and yea it mostly tasted like Lowry's seasoned salt. Anyway this place is well worth the trip and these people really go to the extra mile for you, I highly recommend this place and do definitely get the Chupacabra burger it will floor you with flavor!",0.9988,0.764,0.174,0.062,0.46110754414125205

I'm also sorry to say I do not care for the house made ketchup and I feel like the fries always taste burnt.

2014-03-12,5.0,"Had a hankering for a burger the other day and saw on Chicagoist they named Bad Apple as one of their favorites so off I went in search of adventure. A few initial observations. The ambiance is nice with a separate bar and seating area so if you're looking for a pub feel, sit up front, restaurant, sit in back. Music was also quite interesting as tunes ranges from 1920's swing to Today's Pop Hits. Quite an odd combo but kudos to whomever programmed that piece of ear candy as I spent my time both entertained and confused throughout the evening! Now on to the good stuff. I had the Elvis's last Supper burger which was topped with peanut butter and bacon. Yup, I thought the same thing but it was actually quite tasty. The PB was sweet and the bacon salty and combined with the beef, made for a nice combo. Served with fries topped with ranch seasoning which were also well done. The beer selection is overwhelming and awesome at the same time. Lots of rotating drafts in a wide variety of styles as well s a list of bottle and cans a mile long. What impressed me most was the knowledge of the bar staff as to recommendations and service. Overhearing some conversations they were having with those of us sitting at the bar about styles, tastes and trying to find something on the list a patron would like. Solid, knowledgeable staff which helps with a list like that! Overall a solid place that I'll certainly be back to. Not sure what people were saying when they said it was pricey. $10 for a burger and fries is in my opinion, quite reasonable.

2014-03-03,5.0,"Another 5 Star review, Â I know but this place deserves it. I can only give a 5 star review if service, atmosphere, cleanliness, and food quality are all beyond expectations. Â  Date of visit Saturday, February 22nd, 2014 Â 12:00pm I was in charge of planning my brothers bachelor party from my apartment in Madison, WI. Â I had planned a Brewery Tour theme for the party and wanted to start the day somewhere we could get a good burger to fill us up before the real drinking began. Â The Bad Apple was ranked high so I decided to make that our first stop. Â I got there just as they opened and the place was empty so I got to look around a bit. Â Very nice place with a modern/rustic theme that displayed some very cool artwork from what I would assume to be from local artists because it was all for sale. Â  The beer list was great but it was almost too long, Â I felt bad for the server trying to get a beer order from 12 guys drooling over a beer list 4 pages+ long. Â The food menu was shorter which is great, to me that just shows more love going into the food. Â I decided on the Sunday Morning Burger, Â it was everything I hoped it to be. Â Fried egg with a perfectly runny yolk, bacon, and breakfast sausage on top of a very nice beef patty and fresh bun. Â The French fries seemed to be freshly cut and even the ketchup was homemade! Â Overall, Â the food oozes quality and freshness which is what were all after right? Â Not only was my burger great but 11 other guys were equally impressed and not much of anything was left uneaten. Â  The server was great at taking care of us all and making sure we all had what we needed. Â My glass of beer was never empty and he never left you hanging without silverware, napkins etc. Â So for those reasons I give the Bad Apple 5 stars. Â I am a former bartender/server and not many places seem to impress me anymore but the Bad Apple is great. Â I will be back next time I'm in Chicago.",0.9965,0.727,0.205,0.068,0.5147582133628646

It has immense flavor and as you continue to eat it, the heat turns up! By the time I was nearly finished I needed some bread! Last night I had the Grizzly Adams which has grilled onions and braised pork. The sandwich was delicious! I wish there was a little more sauce on the burger, but the taste of the burger by itself is amazing. To accompany the burger you get a side of fries, and for .75 you can add seasoning.

We came in around 6:30 on a Friday night which was seemingly perfect timing, we only waited a couple minutes for a table. However, about a half hour later the entrance to the restaurant was packed! I would think the earlier the better as far as getting a table on a Friday night. To start, The Bad Apple has an awesome beer list. They have many local brews and interesting options, our waiter was also very helpful in recommending beers. For dinner, we decided to split the Grizzly Adams and Easy Like Sunday Morning. For sides, we went with the ""firecracker"" seasoning on the fries because we both love spicy foods. These were the spiciest fries I've ever encountered! Super tasty and flavorful, but beware if you just kind of like spicy foods. Our other side was the potato salad which was very mustard-y and tasty. The burgers were the star of the show at The Bad Apple. Grizzly Adams the most tender braised short rib, caramelized onion, jalapeno, this outrageous soft cheese sauce, all on a pretzel bun. So many flavors, so much going on here. The short rib definitely had a strong taste and added greatly to the already perfectly cooked hamburger patty. The Easy Like Sunday Morning was your typical breakfast burger, on steroids. Forget just an egg, forget just some bacon, this creation has all of that and an entire sausage patty on top! Plus white cheddar. Phenom. All on a delicious pretzel bun. I'd say I ""couldn't get enough"" but I was so full I couldn't eat another bite.

Â The tap handles are constantly rotating, and the bottle selection is once of the more varied in the city. Â Sure you can find a bigger bottle selection other place, but Bad Apples list is not loaded with filler bottles. Each beer on the list can stand as it's own, which is an accomplishment. Â The thing about them is that they will hold onto kegs until the craziness of a beer has passed, then they will hook it up randomly. Â I like walking in during September to find Parabola tapped. The food is always good. Â Burgers are cooked well, and it is hard to find a joint that will cook a burger rare. Â It really is a testament to their confidence in their meat to cook a rare burger. Â They also come up with great combinations of burger toppings. The only issue that I have is right when you fall in love with a sandwich they take it off the menu. Sure the food and drinks are great, but what it really comes down to is the staff. Â They anticipate our needs, and work hard to ensure that we have a great visit. Â Overall every great visit starts and ends with the hard working people dropping off menus, bringing us a water bottle, telling us about the beer, and dropping off the check. Â In the end it is not the great food or the fantastic beer that brings me back week after week...it is the great service that I receive time after time.

2014-02-17,4.0,Second time here. The first time we ate outside on their small patio. It was early on a Sunday and the place was quite nearly full. Ambiance is OK - very crowded and tight in the dining room and a little bright. Servers are fine - a little impersonal but attentive. Had the goat cheese dip for an appetizer which was good. The wife had a southwestern salad which she enjoyed and I had a sliced beef sandwich with cheddar and onions which was OK. Fries were a liitle overseasoned in my opinion. The number of draft beers on tap is impressive but all save one were ales and most were craft brews. I'm hoping that the bars start putting some more pilsners on tap as US craft brewers start to get their lagers / pilsners up to world class standards.

2014-02-17,4.0,"I originally visited Bad Apple a while back in search of a good beer bar. Â Not only did I find that, but I found an awesome burger place as well. Â Their burgers are absolutely delicious. Â They aren't as crazy as Kuma's (not that they should/need to be), but they have some very unique combinations (bacon and peanut butter!) and always cook to perfection. Â Besides the burgers, we have ordered the meat and cheese board which was bountiful and delicious and the cheese curds. As for the beer, it is damn difficult to fill 25 taps with a more complete and fully concepted list. Â  On my last count there were 5 belgians, 1 Austrian, 1 English, and the rest US in various styles and distances ranging from the coasts to just down the road. Â It is constantly rotating. Â There are also two American Ciders. Â If you can't find a beer you like on this draft list, then you either have no idea what you're talking about or you simply (unfortunately) don't like beer. Â Besides the drafts, there is an enormous bottle list, 10 wines, and a large cocktail list. Â Get your drink on! In addition to the great burgers and great beer, one of the coolest parts of Bad Apple is the proximity to the Half Acre Taproom.

2014-02-11,3.0,"I was slightly disappointed with The Bad Apple. I really wanted to like it, but I think I had too many preconceived notions about it. First of all, their menu changes monthly, so when I first heard about this place, they had some really interesting things on the menu. But by the time I got around to going here, nothing I really wanted to try was on the menu. I settled on the Grizzley Adams burger. A $12 burger topped with braised short rib, caramelized onion and an ale, stone ground mustard, jalapeno & sharp cheddar sauce on a pretzel bun. It was really good, but fell a little short as far as the meat was concerned. A little on the bland side. I feel that the toppings outshined the burger. To me, the burger should be the focal point and the toppings should play a supporting role. The fresh cut fries were cooked perfectly.  My other issue was the beer menu. I'm a bit of a beer snob, so I'm tough to please in this area. While I do appreciate an extensive beer menu with lots of options, there better be some quality on the menu. And Bad Apple is quantity over quality. It is very telling when you have an amazing local brewery right across the street from your bar (Half Acre Brewery) and you only feature one of their beers. Really disappointing. And Â to make it worse, the only two beers on the menu I really wanted, they were out of..... Wonder why? The service was so-so. I went during lunch hour and it wasn't very busy yet I had to wait fairly long for drink orders.  I would recommend trying Bad Apple at least once.

2014-02-02,3.0,"First visit for me was Friday, 1/31/14 at lunchtime. My coworker and I chose Bad Apple due to proximity to work that day & reviews on Yelp. I am going to break this down into areas & rank stars in each category. Ambience: 3 stars...normal looking restaurant; some high-tops, some space at bar, some tables...nothing fancy. Â I'm not a huge fan of hunting, so all of the antlers & dead animal carcasses on the walls don't do much for me. Service: Â 5 stars...our waiter was attentive; continually poured us water, offered me a taste of draft beer, cleared dirty dishes, offered suggestions and made us feel welcome. Beer: Â 5 stars. Â Has it's own menu, need I say more? Â Ok, I will....I love craft beer, but I can't describe it like the true aficionados. Â There had to be 100+ options on the beer menu & I felt overwhelmed. Â I ended up with a shitty, bottled ginger beer called Old Tom. Â Blechhhh! Â $9.00 wasted. I think I drank one sip & almost puked (no lie). Â Tasted like day-old warm cola, with no carbonation. Â I should've went with the Half Acre Daisy Cutter on tap. I'm giving this area 5 stars due to extensive menu...if I'm in area again, I'd like to hang out & do a beer flight. Food: 3.5 stars based on what we ate. Â We split fried cheese curds with ranch dressing. Holy yumminess, you must try these! Â The batter they use is light and melts in your mouth. My coworker and I both ordered off their daily special menu. I had the mini burger trio, which included Waygu with mushrooms and Brie (it was ok...I don't like mushrooms on burgers but we were told we could not change anything, so I peeled them off). Â Also included was a turkey breast (I was too full to try) and a bacon burger (ok). Â My dish came with house-made fries that I opted to add truffle seasoning to (for $.75). Coworker had the Waygu 1/2 lb burger that came with house-made fries & homemade ketchup (nothing to rave about). She couldn't finish even 1/2 of it, so do yourself a favor & split this giant thing if you aren't starving. Â Price was $26! Our bill with tip was $78, which was crazy for lunch. Â If I go back, it'll only be for the cheese curds and beer flights. Â A lot of burgers on their menu were very different...seemed geared towards men (one was topped with braised short rib, jalapeÃ±o and creamy cheese...not for the light hearted). My opinion: Â ladies who like craft beer should hit this up with a group...try the curds. Â No need to dress up...it's laid back. Men who like giant, unique burgers/sandwiches & a variety of craft beers, try this place.",-0.9608,0.839,0.06,0.101,0.5555346700083542

The fries in the poutine were nice and crisp and help up to the chili well. From what I understand they have a different poutine each day.

We had truffle and chipotle fries. Both were good. I upgraded for a side of the Brussels sprout salad. It's says its fried on the menu, so I was expecting crunchy Brussel leaves but it was doused in honey mustard dressing. Luckily I like honey mustard so it was all good.

2014-01-13,2.0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I live on an extremely crushingly limited budget. One in which I should probably never even spend the money on dining out in the first place seeing as I can barely afford to put food in my stomach some days after student loans. That being said- I work in the service industry at a restaurant myself, and am surrounded by others leisurely dining out (and most of the time tipping poorly, but that's another story entirely). Thus I allow myself to give in to that temptation and go out once a month or so. And I don't just pick any old restaurant to dine at, either. I painstakingly plot and plan and scour menus and yelp reviews and ratings to make sure that I'm going to be satisfied and satiated with every last morsel of my meal for the precious limited commodity that I'm paying for it. We picked to dine at The Bad Apple after much contemplation, and almost excitedly skipped the whole way there. As I said before, going out is a pretty spectacular treat. I digress, we picked the Montreal Poutine for starters, which unfortunately arrived before our drinks. Amongst the seemingly never ending list of beers and drinks listed in a bad and particularly hard to read font, we did both order mixed drinks though, which admittedly take longer to make than just grabbing a beer out of the bar fridge. Anyway, the poutine was absolutely delicious, albeit a pretty darn measly serving for the $7 it cost. I'd also like to note that I read in the menu something about Bad Apple is an ""every server helps every guest"" kind of place, and it did seem as though we didn't have just one particular server. Initially, this seemed like a good idea in theory and very much appealed to my server ideals as it's encouraged where I'm employed to help run fellow servers food and drinks. But as I observed, it seemed as though service would be much faster and more consistent if one server where assigned a particular section and stuck with it. Plus, I'd assume that means servers probably do some sort of tip sharing at night's end, which is unfortunate for them. I digress again. We ordered the Edmond Figsgerald and the Grizzly Adams burgers with Truffle and Firecracker fries. Everything was absolutely phenomenal! The burgers were a perfect medium-rare, and I think I may have left a wet spot on my chair the fries were so delicious. I was almost tempted to finish my plate entirely. But I kept a level head and as I sliced my burger in half and pushed a halved portion of my fries to the side (as did my boyfriend) I filled me head with thoughts of savouring the leftovers for lunch the next day. Skip to opening the doggie bags just now only to find out that both of our leftover fries hadn't been bagged up. I could have cried. In fact, I did. We payed hard earned money, not to mention tipped 20%+ for some server to have the audacity to throw out perfectly good food that was still very deliberately left on our plates? Now aside from all the aging unkempt yuppie hipsters glaring at us as we walked in, I would have had a fairly decent experience void of complaints at The Bad Apple. But as it turns out, I was left with an empty wallet, grumbling stomach, and a bad taste in my mouth.",0.9884,0.796,0.126,0.078,0.534248866213152

2014-01-02,3.0,"Your home made ketchup is GROSS! Thats right-- I said it! This place has a some great things going for it. The burgers are excellent the beer is priced well, but sometimes they over extend themselves. Example One: They had a Jersey Turnpike sandwich and being from Exit 7 off the turnpike i had to order it. Lets just say the burger resolved some questions of why people shit on my home state. I get that a ever changing menu is cool, but don't try to have themes if you can't capitalize. The burger of course had pork roll, a Jersey tradition. This had to be the worse pork roll I ever had--and this is saying something because it is a heat and eat meat. How did you turn this wonder into a failed experiment?  Example Two: The fucking ketchup. Okay so you make your own ketchup--cool story. I don't want your nasty vinegar water. When I eat a burger and/or fries I want some real fucking high fructose filled ketchup. Each time I come here I go to Jewel to get some ketchup or go to another place and ask for some to go packets. yeah I'm classy, so classy in fact I make it visible known their nasty ketchup is an insult to the cow that died to make my burger.  Now that my rant is over let me say Bad Apple's burger and beer combo can not easily be beat. The burgers are thick, fairly priced and come out as you request. Expect to pay up for pretzel buns, toppings, and for them to ""season"" your fries.  The beer list, both draft and bottle, is pretty extensive. They regularly have 15+ things on tap many of which at 6.00 or less.  The service is hit and miss. The bar tenders are hit and miss. When you go be prepared to wait for a seat and service. Once you food magically appears the waitress ( i have never had a waiter here) will be scare. The beer list should keep you busy enough and hopefully you don't get the one bartender that can't remember to tilt the glass when she pours your beer. While my ketchup loving, Jersey heart won't let me love this place there is no denying they do some things really well.",-0.491,0.737,0.13,0.133,0.6286152736152735

The beer list changes fairly often, but some beers stay on the menu. My personal favorite beer there is Pranqster, but I try one or two new ones.  The average price of a burger is $10 which is great compare to other bars that charge $12 for a mediocre cheeseburger. I highly suggest trying the Elvis' Last Supper. It's an amazing combination of meat, bun, and peanut butter. After getting it, it's hard to try anything else. The cheese curds are another delicious item to get.

Â  Now, that being said, let me preface this review by saying that these burgers are far from a disappointment. Â Let me regress.. Walking into Bad Apple, I was extremely excited. Â The host was friends and seated us quickly. Â The decor of Bad Apple is welcoming, at the same time, it's not super cozy. Â A little bright and sparse on the decor. We began by looking over the insanely large beer list. Â Our server was prompt in letting us know what they do not have available on tap at the moment, which is great- I can't stand when you order something, just to be told they're out. After giving us the low down, we picked out some beers to start. Â I went with Southern Tier's 2XMAS. Thank you baby Jesus for this beer. I drink my beers with the season, and by golly, tis' the season to have the taste of Christmas in your mouth at a very high alcohol percentage. After the beers came, we started with the goat cheese appetizer. Â Service was prompt and we didn't have to wait long to have this delivered to our table. Â It was extremely tasty.. a bit more bread wouldn't have hurt. Â I'm sure they would have brought it had we asked. On to the main course.. Now, I love trying burgers with crazy stuffs on it.. BUT- if it's the first time I'm going to a place that specialized in burgers.. I go for the classico... this gives me a good guideline for comparing. I ordered the Bad Apple burger and my partner in crime ordered the Slow Burn. We both ordered our fries truffle style - because why wouldn't we? Burgers again were very quick. Â Presentation not great, but who cares. Â The fries were DELICIOUS. Â I got most of the bottom of the barrel fries - the small crunchy ones - and I still can't complain because they were so yummy. Â Our server also recommended keeping our left over goat cheese to dip.. that was a great suggestion.  To get onto what's important, my burger. Â It was cooked to my specifications, A+ for that. Â Ingredients-wise, I had the pickle, onion, and lettuce. Â One pet peeve of mine is when there isn't enough pickle on the burger to fulfill your every bite.. Unfortunately, this Bad Apple burger was lacking on my pickle liking. Â Besides that, the burger tasted good. Â Decent flavor. Â I wasn't overly excited about it- but I wasn't mad at it either. Â My pal, loved his Slow Burn... and I think it really was a slow burn for him. His mouth was a little heated afterwards. Our experience overall was a pleasant one.

Great food and cheap Great prices (Imperial ipa's for under 5 !! are you kidding me!!) Great service (the service I judge others bars by) The staff works as a team. As soon as my beer is close to empty someone is there to take my next order. The food is so good I like to try something different every time I go there knowing it will be great. I am partial to the slow burn. I am not a huge fan of the fries even though the home made ketchup is good. Here is a tip for those who do not frequent the bad apple there is a small post card sized piece of paper in your menu with the specials. You can substitute a side from the list for a dollar more. If they have the truffle oil potato salad get it, it's amazing.  If you ever had a bad server when you where there (it happened to me twice both new people) come back again that server will not work there any more.

The Real Diehl and his Little Lady Love venture here often, so they were able to give me suggestions when it came to ordering.  We started with beer battered cheese curds with homemade buttermilk ranch dipping sauce. Very good...but I wanted to save my appetite for the main attraction, the burger.  For my burger, I had the Slow Burn which is Stout sautÃ©ed spicy chilies & onions, bacon, white cheddar. As all of the burgers here are, this thing is huge. Thank you to Ms. Little Lady Love, your recommendation was perfect and it satisfied my spicy craving. Apparently they make home made ketchup...when I first tried it, I wasn't sure what to think of it but after dipping my fries a few time, I liked it.  I had a few sips of a Bloody Mary made with pickle vodka. Impressive.  I also had a few sips of a Bloody Mary made with horseradish vodka. This one had more of a kick. It was also impressive.

2013-10-29,4.0,I have been wanting to try Bad Apple for as long as I can remember. I finally had the chance and it was worth the wait. Every single staff member was helpful and friendly. We made plans to arrive early and it paid off. We had no wait at 530pm on a Saturday night. It filled up almost immediately after we sat down. The beer selection is huge! I didn't even take it all in. I probably should have spent more time looking over the beer menu. They had so many of my favorites it was hard to choose. I could easily spend all day drinking here. I can't remember which burger I ordered. I know it had mushrooms and spinach and some type of cheese. It was really good. I did feel like a few bites were cooked a little under what I asked for though. I thought all of the burgers looked amazing and wouldn't hesitate to try more of the menu next time.  The fries I ordered (truffle) didn't really taste like truffle. Everyone at the table agreed. They were really good but had more of a salt flavor than anything else. I also tried the firecracker fries and those were awesome. I didn't think they were too spicy to handle but I could see how some people would.  The only real disappointment for me were the cheese curds. I was the only one that wasn't a fan though. They were really sweet. The batter tasted like funnel cake. I am looking forward to heading back for another burger and fries. They have a few things on the menu that really caught my eye. Prices were really reasonable.

Â But to our surprise, the gentleman guided us to a table in the back. Â This place is huge; a great place for a large party. Â The ambiance at The Bad Apple has a rock and artsy vibe with its exposed brick walls, scrap metal art, and loud rocker music. For food, my sister ordered the famous El Chupacabra burger (braised goat chili, garlic puree, goat's milk cheddar, and avocado) with a side of truffle fries while I ordered the Trixie Dixie burger (fried green tomato, horseradish remoulade, and corn relish on a pretzel bun) with a side of mustard potato salad. Â My sister and I really enjoyed our burgers. Â The patties were cooked just right: juicy and tender. Â From the little bite I took from the El Chupacabra, the goat meat was delicious. Â The cheese and avocado added the nice creamy texture. Â For my burger, the ingredients worked well with each other. Â I enjoyed the different textures and flavors from the fried tomato and the corn relish. Â I also really enjoyed the mustard potato salad. Â It is different from your traditional potato salad by using mustard instead of mayo. Â The mustard also gave it an extra punch. This is a great place to meet up with a group of friends to grab a burger and a beer.

2013-09-10,5.0,"Everyone wants in on Chicago's craft beer and burger scene. We're bombarded with new restaurants attempting to emulate it, and for every inch of excitement we have at the prospect of finding the next great one, we're two inches skeptical. So if you're going to try and be the next great beer and burger joint, you better do it right, and Bad Apple does it ten notches above right. Let's start with the beer. You will find things on tap at Bad Apple that you've never seen anywhere else, and on tap no less. If you love trying new beers or rare beers, you'll find something on their drink list. Also, if you're not a huge beer fan, you'll find something you like on their beer list. Then there's the food. Every burger on the menu is worth trying. I have enjoyed the Slow Burn and the Chupacabra and recently the Grizzly Adams stole my taste buds. I haven't dabbled into the sandwiches because I'm still making my way through the burger list. There are also a handful of vegetarian options that my veggie friends have raved about. For appetizers, get them cheese curds. Best outside of Wisconsin. And for the fries, you can't go wrong but I like the Old Bay seasoning. (They let you pick you fries seasoning!) The servers at Bad Apple know their stuff and are helpful, and are for the most part very friendly. The ambiance is a little classier than you might expect from this kind of place, but by all means go as you are. Ive seem families here on weeknights. I also love the location of Bad Apple in that you can keep your buzz going by hopping over to Half Acre's tap room across the street.",0.9664,0.807,0.131,0.062,0.45801484230055656
2013-09-10,4.0,"So, this is yet another place I have been to so many times but have never written a review. In fact, btw my wife and I coming here about a dozen times, I've seen and tasted just about every burger. They are fantastic, so chose the one you think you'll like the most and do it up!!! I'm a spicy guy, so I love the Chupacabra, Elvis' Last Supper (not spicy but delicious!) and the Slow Burn the most....and since I LOVE SPICY, the Firecracker seasoned fries are the way to go!!! My wife is more of a veggie gal and sweet loving burger fan, and she really enjoys the Strange Famous veggie burger and the Edmund Fig-Gerald. So why not 5 stars with all the love from above? Well look out below.... The last time I came here was about a month ago...My buddy and I, after having a couple cocktails, stumble into BA and are entranced by the $26 Wagyu burger.....Forget Pulp Fiction's Five Dollar Shake, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A $26 BURGER!!! So I ask the waiter if it's REALLY worth it, and of course he says it is..and of course our slight intoxication says we must, so we do.  I've had Wagyu burgers before out in Napa Valley and Cali, and they were out of this world. Bad Apple's burger was decent at best. It just wasn't as ""melt-in-your-mouth"" as I would have expected from a $26 burger, and the flavor was a bit too smokey for me. I almost thought it took away from the meat itself. My buddy agreed that for the small fortune we forked over, it was a bit disappointing.  But I love you, Bad Apple.....4.5 stars, no doubt. I love the beer menu and the atmosphere to boot. Improve the recipe on the Wagyu burger and I just might have to try it again!!!",0.9969,0.715,0.22,0.065,0.47999999999999987
2013-09-03,4.0,"There comes a time in everyone's life when they must relent to the endless dinner propositions by someone they don't care to ever actually share a meal with. A few months ago, I finally relented. But where to take this pestering fool so that I needn't muster too much energy and charm? Where can I emulate a bump on a log and not even need to utter some pathetic excuse dipped in exhaustion from a sleepless night to compensate my complete lack of Effs to give? The Bad Apple. It's genius, actually. Enough neighborhoods away from my own so the persistent twerp can't invite herself back to my place for cocktails, and open early enough in the evening that an early dinner I'd rather forget can be washed away by another dinner with a far better companion later that night. Perfect.  The menu and atmosphere also lend huge helping hands to my cause. First, it's dark. Super dark. So dark you don't have to notice when said twerp is glaring at you across the table because you haven't uttered a word in almost 10 minutes. Sorry, were you going to say something? I can't see too well in here! This also gives you a good five minutes of idiot commentary that you don't have to try so hard with. Annoying people love to talk about how dark or loud a place is. Which leads me to my second reason for loving The Bad Apple on a bad night out- it's loud. Music, bar noise, glasses clinking, and the forever gnawing sounds coming from other patrons chowing on their Connecticut-sized burgers. Trust when I say it's easier to just smile and nod here. Even your bad date across the table will get the drift it's just too loud to talk.  This leads me to my final reason for loving The Bad Apple: the menu. The beer listing alone will give you a solid 10 minutes of silence to select your craft brew and contemplate how stupid you are for actually agreeing to this God-awful night. Many of these beers are heavy suckers. After two or three you'll have liquid charm anyway and will resemble a less pissed off version of yourself. You might even trick your bad date into thinking you aren't miserable.  Once you've picked your brew, pick your burger. And seriously, go with the burger. No one has ever had a long, in-depth convo while simultaneously snarfing down a big burger. This can afford you at least 15 minutes of peace. I would recommend the Freedom Burger. It's so flavorful with the truffle creme fraiche and vinaigrette. Also, because America. Get fries, too. They're nice and crunchy, and again it's more time with stuff going into your mouth instead of words coming out of it. Â  Throw in a few trips to the restroom, and you've had yourself an almost silent evening, and a great meal to boot. I doubt The Bad Apple owners had bad dates and bad experiences in mind when crafting the restaurant's vibe and menu, but it worked out nicely just the same.",0.5051,0.802,0.097,0.101,0.5551251956181535

You can either sit at the bar area and watch the game or be seated in two separate-ish dining room areas. The staff is always insanely friendly, engaging and willing to help with beer selections or menu info. Which gets me to the best part of the place... The beer. It's one of the most diverse and impressive beer lists in the city. They always ALWAYS have a huge local selection to choose from in addition to more regional or nationwide beers. I even dropped in once when they had Dogfish Head 120 minute on tap. I stopped in a few more times to enjoy a glass a few times that weekend. :) The food is also great. Favorite burger on the menu is the left coast burger topped with a secret dressing similar to thousand island and coleslaw. It's a great mix of heat and sweetness to go with the savory beef patty. Their menu is constantly evolving and rarely disappoints. Their sandwich and side selection is great, too. I'd recommend the fried cheese curds (they are a staple as I grew up in Wisconsin). It's hard to find restaurants that do them right and the Bad Apple does them right. This place is great. It's my go-to place when I have friends and family visit the city.

I can understand if we are 2-3 short but we were waiting on one person. We could not be seated. The place started getting really busy. Now, I am typically the chronically late friend so I knew our last person would show up. We pleaded with the gatekeeper because we had already been waiting 30 minutes and could easily see another 30 if all of the people at the door were seated before us. We were eager to start ordering. The fried cheese curds had been on my mind all day! Finally the gatekeeper begrudgingly agreed to seat us. She put us at a two top with a chair pulled up. So passive-aggressive. We like to eat and drink and this was not going to work.  Our server happily moved us when she saw that with the water bottle and glasses there would be no room for food. Our fourth showed just as we were scooting across the room. Now.. this bit of drama was completely avoidable. We settled in, got another round of drinks. I had a spicy version of a salty dog - it was terrific. Everyone else was enjoying the sampling of the beer list. We ordered our cheese curds which would be repeated - they were great. It would have been easy to eat an order per person but we are prudent! The burger list is full of great options. We finally negotiated four separate incarnations that everyone wanted to try. Three of us ordered med-rare and they were right on the money. The one medium-well was a bit dry. We each sliced bites off for each of the others, great idea. All four were best I have had in awhile. These were real burgers with well thought out toppings. Not so stacked that you can't bite it.  Overall.. this place was great. I will go back for the curds, cocktails and the burgers. I will hope no one is late arriving or that this BAR has a change of seating policy. They have a whole other room and three seating areas.

2013-06-24,4.0,"Let me start off by saying that Bad Apple would hand down have my five stars, but their AC was broken when we dined there last night, and it made our dining experience rather uncomfortable. My friends and I have been checking off places from The Best Bars for Beer Lovers on Metromix's list released in December, and Bad Apple was our next stop. Â I had heard great things about their burgers, and I was in the mood for a burger and was hopeful that they'd have a great veggie one. Â My group of friends and I all arrived around the same time, but we were still waiting on one person, and we were told we couldn't be seated until EVERYONE was there. Â Luckily, they let it slide and they sat us at one of the large hightops by the bar. Their menus for both drinks and food are heavy bound bibles. Â Their beer list is so extensive, it's overwhelming! Â I opted to stick to the draft list, which is still huge, but less overwhelming. Â Throughout the course of dinner, I drank two IPAs which were both excellent and reasonably priced. As for the menu, they have a small list of appetizers and salads and a large selection of sandwiches and burgers. Â We started off with the cheese curds, which were fantastic, and the bone marrow, which I as a non-meat eater, did not partake in. Â Our server was super helpful and willing to answer our millions of questions about the menu. Â There were two non-meaters in the bunch, and we asked about subbing the veggie burger for any of the other specialty burgers. Â They do this at no charge, even though it isn't listed on the menu. Â I asked the server which he would recommend with the veggie burger and ended up ordering the Freedom, which comes with ""truffled whipped St Angel's triple creme cheese, spinach & enoki mushroom salad, truffle vinaigrette"". Â This was the BEST veggie burger I have ever had in my life. Â I wouldn't change anything about it! :) Â At our table we each got a different type of fries, so I ended up trying almost all of them. Â They included the old bay, garlic, firecracker, spicy chipotle, truffle, and ranch. Â My favorite were probably the old bay or the spicy chipotle. Â I ordered the firecracker and they are crazy hot! Â  Bad Apple was amazing and aside from the AC being out, I would have had a perfect meal.",0.9977,0.742,0.2,0.057,0.6003341687552214

2013-06-20,1.0,"The burger I had was great and they have a great selection of beers, however I will not be going back based on the treatment we received.  We were a large group on a Saturday night which I know can be tough to accommodate, but they basically did everything they could to make us feel unwelcome. We were there to spend several hours eating and drinking which means we spent some serious money there so I'm not sure what we did to receive the short tempers we got for from almost everyone we encountered (perhaps its because we aren't hipsters? I would sure hope not). I will say that the main server was good although she seemed a little stressed and annoyed by us at first (i think that was because the hostess and manager gave us such attitude that she assumed we were jerks) but she came around and did a good job of serving us and was very attentive. They have some sort of tip share program there so there are many people that will deliver drinks and food throughout the evening and everyone but our primary server kept giving us attitude and being very short with us. I'm sorry but if you stand at one end of a table of 13 people and call out an order, don't be pissed if we don't respond immediately.

2013-06-15,5.0,"After my last visit to the city in January, I really needed a food option that wouldn't leave me thoroughly disgusted (service and food at Fernando's in Wrigleyville were awful. Shout out!) This was partially Â my fault, as I let me friends dictate the choice. As an elite yelper, I know that from now on, it is my responsibility to find the finest establishments for not only myself, but also my peeps. I had this place bookmarked in January, but we didn't get around to going. After reading reviews/reassessing options/confiding with my brother, also an elite yelper (Shoutout Pat E.), I decided to tell the guys (not suggest) that we were heading to Bad Apple, which was 10 mins north of their place. We arrived and were told it would be about 20 minute wait for the table. Two of my buddies ordered a beer, and we chatted over the menu. They were very excited about the menu. They were not only intrigued by all the burger options, but the fries as well! After about a 20-25 minute wait, we were seated. Our waitress, who didn't bother to tell us her name, was very condescending towards my friend Dave. She asked if we had a tab at the bar, which one of us did, but then she tried to explain the difference between a bar tab and a bill for the table. I actually thought about moving BA down to a four star because of her, but she got a bit better as the meal went on. I will also add that she was pleasant to the table of 2 next to us, introducing herself, asking how they were doing, and just being nice. It's harder to be a jerk than it is to be nice, but oh well. We were all ready to order, and we all ordered different fries and Burgers. Personally, I ordered Â the Baby Kale & Blueberry Salad, which came with baby kale, arugula, blueberry, pickled grape, spiced candied walnut, St Agur blue cheese, blueberry balsamic. For 5 dollars, it was quite a deal! It was small, but very tasty. I loved the pickled grape and the dressing especially. Another bonus: the woman who brought my salad out chided me, but nicely, for getting dressing on the side. I ended up using the whole thing, but I appreciated her human interaction skills, unlike the waitress. For my burger, I ordered the Freedom Burger, which featured truffled whipped St Angel's triple creme cheese, spinach & enoki mushroom salad and truffle vinagrette. I had the vinagrette on the side, because I really wanted to taste the meat. I ordered my burger medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly! The cheese was very tasty, and I appreciated the greens and enoki. The Enoki Â (see my photo) was an elongated type of shroom, but it had a lot of flavor. My burger was on a pretzel bun, which was an excellent choice! As for my fry choice, I went with the truffle seasoning. Out of all of the seasoned fries that our table ordered, mine were the closest to normal, I guess. They were different, and tasted good, but I wish I could have ordered another one with more flavor. As for the housemade ketchup... excellent! It is a chunky ketchup with a nice tang. I'm a huge fan. The other burgers ordered at the table: Left Coast Burger Reuben, BLT and BC, Slow Burn, and the El Chupacabra. See their menu for complete descriptions.  As for the fries ordered: Ranch, Spicy and Sweet Chipotle, (Truffle) Old Bay, and Firecracker. All of them had great flavor, and I listed them in order of how much I liked them. The firecracker fries were very hot, so if you get those, be prepared! All and all, a fantastic experience, besides a little hiccup in the service. We split the bill 5 ways. With the 4 total beers, my salad, and 5 burgers/fries, the total was around 80 bucks. A great deal, especially considering the size of the burgers. As noted, I was on the fence on whether to give 4 or 5 stars. My bro, an elite yelper, asked me a very simple question to help clarify my ranking: Would I return? Even with all the options down in the city (I'm a suburbanite), I would make a point to head back here!  The El Chupacabra looked amazing, and will most likely be my next order.

2013-04-02,4.0,"Good burger joints that serve craft beer are like the mythical unicorn. Â Some seem to be the one you seek, hope, and pine for, but ultimately turn out to be just another as... donkey. Â This place should be on your short list when you're dreaming of a good burger. Â No Findus here! The cheese curds are a good place to start. Â Eat them fast. Â They come out clumpy since they appear to be all fried together. Â If allowed to cool, well, it's just not as appetizing though it tastes fine. Â Do avoid the poutine however. Â If you've ever had the real thing, you'll just be all disappointed and screaming ""Ay this ain't poutine, Ay!"". The variety of burgers is good. Â It's not overwhelming nor a list of one. Â The size of the patty is somewhere around 10 to 12 oz. Â It is made of ground meat and has a good amount of juiciness. Â You won't have to worry about taking a bite and having a stream of burger juices running down your sleeve. Â Having said that, I do enjoy the Chupacabra quite a bit. Â Asking for an extra dollar to get a pretzel roll however is a bit excessive... Â The seasonings available for the fries is another excessive add on. Â The truffle seasoning is a dry truffle seasoning and not the oil. Â Skip it. Â Minced garlic and the chipotle are pretty tasty however. The beer menu is quite extensive. Â You'll find a decent mix of the midwestern craft beer scene with the larger craft beer and Belgian power players. Â You'll find something you like, though probably not your obscure favorite or micro brewed seasonals. The decor and ambiance are sort of a mixed bag. Â Maybe even odd?

My last experience was a nightmare and left my guests shocked and embarrassed.  I met my boyfriend and two of our other friends out after work (I'm industry) and wanted to get a bite to eat while the boys grabbed a beer- shortly after placing an order for food our waitress disappeared after she reappeared the boys tried to order a beer and she in a very condescending manner suggested they waited for food before they had anything to drink .... Excuse me ? I was speechless and embarrassed my girlfriend got up and walked out from embarrassment alone.  I bartend so I'm sympathetic to ever having to be in the position of cutting someone off - it can be a sticky situation. But the way this was handled was atrocious especially because none of us were DRUNK ! Tired and hungry yes but not drunk. My friend then approached the bartender asking if he was cut off or if he had done somethjg to be cut off they said no looking as puzzled as he was and the waitress couldnt have been an ruder - she proceeded to back track and claim that it was only my girlfriend and I being refused for drink (ummmm we were drinking water) - we canceled our order and left - total shame too because I was starving. You can see that I literally created this account to share my story - I'm almost anti yelp - I think that yelp reviews can sometimes misrepresent restaurants.

Â That isn't to say they aren't tasty because they absolutely are. I think they are a must order.  My gripe about this last meal is with the preparation of my burger, the Edmund Fig-Gerald. Â I asked for medium rare and it came out very rare. Â  I don't mind a rare burger but it wasn't what I asked for. Â The fig/bacon jam was ice cold as was the half dollar sized disk of goat cheese. Â I took the goat cheese disk off the burger so I could smear it on my bun. Â If I didn't do that, I wouldn't get to it until I got to the middle of my birger. Â Anyways, because the cheese and the jam were so cold, my burger was cold by the time I was halfway done. It was pretty unpleasant biting into a cold burger so didn't finish the other half. Â The server noticed this and asked if there was something wrong, so I told her. She apologized and offered to warm it up but by that time the damage was done.

2013-02-26,4.0,"I first found out of this restaurant from my Chef at work, telling me that they have an enormous beer selection and great burgers that you won't find anywhere else. It took me awhile to finally go there with my roommates. When we first got there it was packed! And was only a 5minute wait which wasn't bad with how busy it was. The host took us to the table near the back of the restaurant. It was awesome seeing all the dÃ©cor on the walls and the art work on the walls that where dragons if I'm not mistaken.  When the waitress came after we were seated, this was fairly quick. She gave us a book that we thought was the menu but it was the drink menu which was crazy! There where so many beer opinions it was abit overwhelming and I didn't know where to start to look at. The text in the book was really small and cramped so it was hard to read without losing my place. I asked the waitress if they had any local beers, which my chef recommended but I couldn't remember the name of. She said I should try Half Acre which was done the tree from Bad Apple. I ended up trying both the beers that they had from that company which both where really good.  When looking at the menu I loved how different the burgers where from other places like the calf tongue burger or the truffle one. It was hard for me to pick which one I would have like to try each one of them. I ended up picking the BLT & BC burger that came with crÃ¨me blue cheese, bacon, arugula, oven dried tomato confit on herbed focaccia bun and a side of truffle fries. When I got the burger it was cooked to order which was a surprise to me (not that they over cook them but from past places I always order rare to get medium rare). The flavors of the burger where amazing and went well with the beer I really like the acidity of the tomato and the creaminess of the blue cheese. Also the truffle first weren't overpowering everything else since it's a strong flavor.  The pricing for the burger and what you got was not bad at all seemed for me to be cheap with all the goodness. Over all it was real enjoyable for me and I have gone back there since.

2013-02-06,4.0,"I like to chase my beers with fries, and vice versa, so making my way to Bad Apple seemed both necessary and natural.  I was impressed right away with the quality of host staff. Smart, quick and more cordial enough to get people in and out. Our group of 6 walked in right after a group of 3 was sat in a large high-top that was big enough for a much larger party. She quickly turned around, saw that we'd entered and did a 'oh, I'm sorry- actually let me seat you back here' to that smaller group of 3 as another more appropriately-sized seating area was being cleared, then she came back and sat us right away. Smooth moves.  One of the next two things I noticed was that our server was super quick and the menus were monstrous. Monstrous not only in the hundreds of craft beer options and plenty of feast-able offerings, but in the almost comically over-the-top size of the very tall menu, like those giant, novelty 'Big Book of _____' books you find in kindergarten classrooms. I noticed those two things right away because the when I went to open the giant menu, it was so large that knocked over the glass of water that the server had already set down on the opposite side of the table, then making em look like I'd already had a few too many, even though I'd just sat down and hadn't even been able to open the menu enough to see the beer the selection, let alone down enough to be drunk on it.  The beer selection is fantastic and one of the main talking points whenever I've heard folks mention The Bad Apple but one of the other main things I'd been directed to try here are any of their numerous vegetarian options... but I got a steered a little in the wrong direction there. I'd decided on their 'Legends of the Daal', a wrap with chipotle hummus, curried cauliflower, lentil, spinach, feta, red onion, peas, Sarasola cider soaked golden raisin, cilantro yogurt, lavash wrap. The curried cauliflower sounded great at the time, but I'd also assumed that it would be somewhat warm, but it was my bad on that assumption. Everything in the wrap was fresh-out-the-freezer cold and in the cold Chicago winter months, that's precisely the last thing I want. Also, I just really wasn't into what flavor was there. It was like leftover Indian food in a wrap, but not the good kind that you eat a day or two after it was fresh, it tasted like dry and just douced ina Â sauce that was half curry powder. I only had a few bites before regifting it to a much hungrier friend.  The fries on the other hand- YeeHa! Sign me up for s'more of that! Curry fries, truffle fries, garlic fries, ranch fries, firecracker fries. I felt like Ash in Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all... except I eated 'em all.",0.9725,0.84,0.105,0.055,0.5148809523809524

Cocktails for those of you who do not care for beer- Pouty Pear cocktail was recommended by the lovely Dallas to me- clean, sweet and I want another (maybe two) shaken for an extra-long time until ice is slivered to bits and chilled to refreshing perfection.

However, it was their fault for sitting six adults that are drinking alcohol next to tables of children. Didn't help that a few of them liked to scream and throw food too.

I was not scared, because when I eat, it is the food that is scared.  The burger was excellent. Great flavor and toppings. And the fries really did live up to their name. Certainly not for the faint of heart, but if you're a boss like me, you can handle it. The only thing I was unhappy about was the appetizer we ordered, which was basically a smorgasbord of pickled items. We were told it was a new on the menu. My friend thought it sounded like a good idea to order it. I'd say she was wrong. This item needs to be sent into exile, like yesterday. I wish they'd call it the ""Manti Te'O's Girlfriend Platter"", because that would mean it didn't exist. Avoid this like a sexually-aggressive recent divorcee.

We came to meet our friends and when we arrived, adding 5 people to the party, our server, Brianne, made sure to accomodate us by adding another table so we could sit. The newcomers made it clear from the beginning that we wanted to split checks which appeared helpful for Brianne (she gave some of our established friends a really hard time at the end because they did not specify this).  Brianne didn't go out of her way to visit our table or ask if we were ok. She simply came by to take orders (we'd have to wave her down) and drop stuff off. BARE MINIMUM. All of this said, close to the end of the night, you could tell she was getting moody. She screwed up our check so we worked it out between us so some of us switched checks, paid for eachothers food/drinks then followed up with quickpays, etc., to make things easier for her.  When she saw that people in our group switched checks with eachother, she SNAPPED and made some smart comments. The mistake was hers... why is she making it feel like it was ours???

I always order medium, hoping to at least get a solid medium rare, and I have never gotten one cooked past what could, charitably, be considered the extreme low end of medium rare Â I've had them come out on the low end of rare (as in effectively raw in the middle) before. I know it seems like the trend for restaurants to somehow assume that you want your meat rarer than you say, but really, I know what I want. Further, all of their burgers are just, well, not that well composed. If you are going to throw five ingredients at a hamburger, at least put some thought into it.

We went on a Saturday night around 7, and despite being busy, we got seated after about 15 minutes of waiting, which was nice.

I didn't even eat half of my burger because the carbon taste was too much and I ended up not feeling well the rest of the night. I liked the house ketchup...for a while. It is too sweet to eat all of the fries with. Our fries were just okay: room temperature, overcooked, and all stuck together in a giant fry-ball. Must have gotten the last of the batch.

Â I had no idea they had such an extensive beer list but I had never been to this place before so I guess I didn't really know what to expect. Â It was pretty hard to read the menu because of how dimly lit the bar area was and I ended up with a glass of wine as I was far too indecisive to choose a beer. Our server was super friendly and attentive. Â They use local products, fresh ingredients and their menu is indicative of both. The interior itself was a bit confusing.

Â While bopping our heads to Mr. Astley's song, we were looking over the menu and we admitted to each other that we might need a suggestion from our server as neither of us really knew what to order. Â If you are looking for basic burgers, you'll only find one here. Â Otherwise, they are pretty eccentric burgers, the entire menu is, and it scared me quite a bit. Â I was not in the mood for anything other than a big, juicy burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, ketchup and mustard....so that is what i ordered. Â Oh, it had a large slice of melted provolone on it too. Â  My burger was delicious, I devoured the entire thing.

2012-10-15,4.0,"After literally months of saying that I needed to try The Bad Apple, I finally made it a reality on a Friday evening. We arrived around 7:30 to a loud and bustling bar and were told that it would be about a 40 minute wait for a table for our party of four. Luckily, we weren't too disappointed as we were able to keep ourselves occupied with their extensive (and impressive) beer list while we waited. Only about 20 minutes went by before we were seated, which I feel is always a great touch when the restaurant is handling your expectations. Upon being seated we decided to try the fried cheese curds after reading all the hype on Yelp. These cheese curds definitely delivered--they had a nice balance of light and crispy breading along with some oozy and stretching cheese. All of this dabbled in a little bit of the ranch dressing was heavenly. Luckily we each got about three to four cheese curds, so the indulgence wasn't overkill. We put in our burger orders as follows: 1) Elvis's Last Supper (Two people in our party ordered this): I feel that there is a lot of buzz around this burger, but then again it is to be expected when combining peanut butter, bacon, and beef. I snagged a bite of this one, and you should absolutely not be turned away from the unique combination of peanut butter and bacon. I thought it would be overkill with the richness and sweetness of the peanut butter, but it was incredibly savory. I wish I would've snagged a few more bites before the burger disappeared, but I'm glad I tried it. 2) Jersey Turnpike (topped with Taylor pork roll, fried egg, white cheddar, ketchup): I didn't get to try this one, but my boyfriend's brother seemed very enthusiastic about it, and I feel that the quickly cleared plate is always a great indicator. We asked the waitress to clarify what the Taylor pork roll was, and she said it was essentially a very thin piece of pork that tops the burger and said it was incredibly flavorful. The combination sounded amazing, and I'd definitely put this high on my list of burgers to try.  3) El Chupacabra (topped with braised goat chili, roasted garlic purÃ©e, goat's milk cheddar, avocado): I absolutely LOVED this burger, and I would highly recommend it. I was a little skeptical about ordering it at first, as my ventures into goat meat have never been that great. Also, for some reason unbeknownst to me, I tend to gravitate towards incredibly messy and sloppy foods, so I was convinced that this burger topped with chili would be soggy, sloppy, and messy. I was incredibly taken aback when it was neatly presented to me, and when it didn't fall apart throughout the meal. The goat chili was enhanced by the garlic puree (which was surprisingly subtle for being a garlic puree) and the combination of the goat's milk cheddar. The avocado mellowed out the flavors and provided a very creamy balance to these strong flavors. I was a huge fan and it'll take a lot for me to not order this one again in venturing out to try the other burger offerings. I feel that it's important to mention that you can ""upgrade"" your fries by adding optional seasonings to them. I went with the sweet and spicy chipotle, which I loved, as it provided a little heat and a lot of flavor. My boyfriend and his brother went with the firecracker which was SPICY. They both have a high tolerance for spicy foods but they kept on remarking on how hot they were. The fry I snagged was tasty, but I could see the heat building as you downed more of those delicious potatoes. My boyfriend's mom went with the ranch flavoring, and it was exactly what you would expect, and it too was delicious! Overall, I feel that the meat wasn't incredibly flavorful/spiced on its own, but like Kumas, the emphasis is obviously on the toppings. Also, my boyfriend's brother kept on raving about the bun on the burger the next day, which I felt was worth mentioning as the bread was very fresh, but didn't have a strong flavor that overpowered the burger. The toppings were fresh and unique, which was a great attribute to the overall meal.  We had one hiccup with our service which was easily remedied. They accidentally brought out two of the El Chupacabras instead of the Elvis burgers. As soon as we pointed this out they brought out a burger within 5-7 minutes and let us take how the extra and comp'd us a burger without batting an eye. I won't deduct any stars for this because accidents do happen, especially during peak weekend hours. I know I'll be back since I live so close, but I'd recommend this as a contender to Kumas without the wait.",0.9992,0.808,0.169,0.023,0.6311555555555555

I kind of compare it to how when you start dating someone new that you really like and you just want to keep seeing more of them. If these feelings persist i think might need to seek a couples counselor. I adore this place due to combination of the absolutely delicious food and grandiose selection of craft beer, craft soda, wine, and specialty drinks.  The overall theme i would say is like a hipster/goth texas ranch house? it probably sounds silly as hell when you visualize all of those clashing themes together in your head, but hey- they made it work! Now I am all about the art pieces and decor and this joint had some really interesting ones. Lots of independent work by local artists. Various mixed-media paintings each with an incorporation of either a human or cow skull. Kinda dark yet fits in with the hipster/goth texas ranch house theme lol.  I ordered the Elvis burger because i'm adventurous enough to try a burger with peanut butter sauce and bacon. I paired this with fries covered in curry powder for additional 30 cents. To drink i ordered butter beer (beer specialty cocktail of ginger beer and butterscotch shnapps) I ordered my burger medium rare, and when i tasted it it was amazing. The burger was so rich and succulent. The peanut butter was home made and it added a really nice nutty flavor and texture. It wasn't sweet and paired very well with the crispy bacon. The burger was very well executed. The fries were delicious and ordering them was a good idea because they contrasted against the burgers sweeter taste. They were crispy and a lovely yellow/brown color. The butter beer was so good and not like anything i've ever tasted before. If you like sweet drinks that taste more like candy this is for you. I drank this thing really fast because it made me feel like i was at hogwarts. The food is also very reasonably priced. My burger and drink together was $18, and would have been $10 if i didn't get the beer. I really love this place and will keep coming back.",0.9974,0.78,0.195,0.024,0.5331553030303032

Â Lots of beer, ale, cider choices and I would have to say that any beer nerd is going to find something they enjoy on that menu. Wait, hostess, and bar staff were very friendly and pretty attentive. I ordered the belly burger, which is a burger with a horseradish sauce, topped with a braised pork belly and served on a pretzel bun; I also had them toss on a slice of provolone. Â Alicia got a sort of 'standard' burger with traditional fixings. Â Both came with fries and I had mine dusted with chipotle powder while Alicia had her fries dusted with curry. Â both of us order our burgers medium rare. So how was it? Â I'm gonna go ahead and say that the burger itself, that is the patty, was excellent. Â Perfectly cooked, juicy, tasty, and thick. Â If all of the peripherals on that burger matched, we might have to go five stars! However, the peripherals didn't match. Â The fries were nothing to write home about. Â Soft and floppy and just mediocre at best. Â The dusting didn't do much for them though Alicia's curry dust was better than the chipotle. On my sandwich, I couldn't even tell there was a horseradish sauce on it. Â Horseradish isn't exactly a subtle flavor, you know? Â It's also one I enjoy, so having a horseradish sauce that was so subtle I couldn't taste it didn't do anything for me. The pretzel bun was jut a big fat hunk of bland bread. Â I'm not a fan of thick buns and this was pretty thick. Â Even taking the whole bottom half of the bun off and eating it upside down sort of 'pizza' style with just the top half, it was too much bun. Â Alicia had the same problem with her more standard bun. I was satisfied with the burger, but for the price and the hype around gimmicky burgers, it didn't leave an impression of ""Wow, AMAZING!"" I'll probably go back, though, the beer list is compelling and I'll try at least one or two other burgers before I make a final call on whether or not this will be a go to spot.",0.9959,0.839,0.139,0.022,0.5306111111111111

They also have a great beer list to select from at reasonable prices. When the weather is nice, enjoy the nice outdoor patio.

So let's get down to business- I chose this place for my birthday, and I hadn't had a burger for quite sometime due to working out with a personal trainer, and trying to eat healthier. I was craving burgers, and this craving was not gonna be wasted at a Mickey D's or some other lame chain!! Â I loved the look of this place. The inside very roomy, and Â there was cool art on the walls. Everyone I interacted with was pretty cool. They also allowed me to bring my birthday cake, and they brought it out when we were ready for it.   Â  Â The beer list is incredible! I don't think I've ever seen so many different choices in one place! I wanted something dark and thick, but I did try the cider first which I liked, but I was ready for a stout. That was pretty odd for me because I usually don't go for stouts at all! Those are just a little too bitter for me. But, I went for the Youngs double chocolate stout! I actually liked it!   Â  Â  Â Now on to the food!! There were 3 of us, and my friend Chris suggested to cut our burgers in 3rds and swap. Which was a great idea because we got to taste 3 different sandwiches. My friend Chris ordered the El Chupacabra, Taylor ordered the big Texan, and I got the Edmund Fitzgerald. My favorite of all three was Chris's choice- El Chupacabra. Oh my god was that damn burger good!!! El Chupa is topped with braised goat chili, roasted garlic purÃ©e, goat's milk cheddar, avocado. Forget slapping my mama, I was ready to take it one step forward and go dig up my granny and slap her! Â That's how much I enjoyed that burger!! The big Texan was good also with Â house pulled pork, fried onion rings, BBQ sauce on Texas toast. I liked it, but when I eat burgers I have to be in a mood to eat BBQ sauce on it. Â Now on to my choice the  Edmund Fitzgerald porter- fig & bacon relish, goat cheese, smoked onion. It was different. Not bad, but in all honesty I probably would NEVER get that one again. When it comes to food I am trisexual lol! #Okay. Like I said it was not bad, it just didn't work for me. We also tried the cheese curds. Those were a miss for me. Nothing special at all! The bad apple also has different seasonings for their french fries. I went for the truffle seasoning which was pretty good!! I tasted Chris's garlic fries, and they were good as well!  All in all I really enjoyed myself and will be back!! I totally recommend this place. Great atmosphere to relax with friends and knock back a few beers!",0.9983,0.717,0.225,0.058,0.5276118326118329

So I had great hopes for The Bad Apple, especially when we walked in at 7 pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Sadly, I was disappointed on all but two counts. First--the cheese curds are great, light and flavorful. Second, the beer list really does overwhelm, in such a good way. I had a bizarre mustard beer and the great new cider by the Goose Island guy (it's tough to get!). But the burgers and fries were not great, by a longshot. My partner got the Edmund Fitzgerald and it was fine, he said, but not exceptional. I got the Strange Famous veggie burger, and it was okay. But the toppings were so, so boring and the whole concoction was dry. I was almost crying for a Kuma's ABSU half way through. The fries were okay, but still--kind of dry, like it was impossible to use enough ketchup to give them some flavor. There were no big, bold flavors here. I should also add that while this place seems much more vegetarian friendly than Kuma's, I don't think it actually is, if you want a burger. Yes, there's a lentil wrap, a pb&j, some salads, and a portabello mushroom on the menu in addition to the Strange Famous. But there's only one burger. If I'm going out to dinner, I don't want a pb&j. And a lentil wrap? I am at an ashram in 1987?  To top it all off, the service was seriously slow. We were seated for a solid hour before our appetizers even arrived.

2012-08-09,5.0,"I've been wanting to try TBA for awhile now, at the recommendation of a former co-worker who loves good, juicy burgers as much as I do. Â The fact that they have unique combos and flavors just added fuel to the fire, and I  had.to .go. So, it's probably been about four months since I first heard of TBA, and finally had the chance to go earlier this week. 1. Street parking is ample, and if you don't mind walking a block or two, you can avoid the pay-boxes. 2. The location is easy to get to. 3. It's LOUD, but FUN. Â I like that all of the artwork is for sale. 4. The crowd is ECLECTIC. Â I was surrounded by hipsters, musicians, the tattoo'd and non-tattoo'd alike, the girly girls, and even the older folks. Â Everyone got along just fine. Â Is TBA the center of the space-time continuum? 5. The beer/cocktail/drink list is massive, and ANYONE can find something. Â I didn't try it, but it was the first time I've seen alcoholic ginger beer on a menu, anywhere. Â Next time, f'sho. 6. The food ROCKED! Â I can't confirm, but the burgers were definitely formed on site, and from the taste and texture, probably also ground on site. Â The toppings to choose from made it difficult for me to decide on what I wanted, but I finally ended up with ""The Frenchie"" which is topped with spinach, truffle mayo, fried onion straws, and LOTS of melty brie. Â The only thing I would change about this burger is it needed something to cut all of the richness. Â I think that's what the onions were there for, but it just didn't do it. Â The onion either needs to be raw, or it needs something in addition, like... BACON. Â Bacon would've been perfect on that burger. Â The BF had the BLT&BC burger, which he devoured within minutes. Â He said the flavors were spot-on. Â I didn't add seasoning to my fries (next time, I certainly will) and he had the ""firecracker"" which the server told us was made with scotch bonnets. Â You have been warned!!! 7. I didn't see anywhere on the menu where you could ""add"" to your burger. Â I am a big fan of sunnyside eggs on pretty much anything, but the burgers that included it also had a ton of other ish I didn't want. Â If they want to keep the integrity of their burgers, I'm all for it, just an observation. 8. The only thing I *wasn't* a fan of, was the house made ketchup.

The slow burn could be more spicier though. The fries, however, was a bit overwhelming.  My friends got the truffle fries and the boyfriend ordered the creole. Both were good. I think my friend commented that the truffle fries were too salty for her, but it was perfect in my opinion. I ordered the garlic fries. They use fresh garlic and really load it up.

I didn't even hesitate this time, I said: ""Can I get some more beer in my glass?"" The waitress had clearly noticed the bad pour as well, because she also did not hesitate, responding immediately by saying ""Yeah, let me get that topped off for you."" OK. And the next beer came back nice and tall. But then they switched shifts and I got another waitress. Guess what? Another short pour! What does this tell you but that shitty pours are endemic to the Bad Apple; they will give you a crap pour unless you complain in order to extend the life of the keg for as long as possible. And make no mistake: An inch of foam at the top of the glass turns your 16 oz pint into a 12 ouncer at most, shorting the customer by 4 ounces (25%!) per beer, providing them with another ""full"" beer in the keg they should not have for every three served, a ""full"" beer that you should have sitting right in front of you. Or to put it another way, one free keg for every three they run through. For what it costs to drink at a bar these days, this is nothing less than a criminal activity. I really hope that more people start to notice this. If you do, please say something. If places continue to get away with this then perception is going to shift in their favor -- soon the price of a pint will be seen as acceptable for a 12 oz beer, and it will be that much harder to call them out on it in the long run.",0.9567,0.786,0.137,0.077,0.4850373482726424

The fries didn't seem as hot as they could have been, and our theory was they were left under a heat lamp and forgotten.

You can substitute a veggie burger into any burger on the menu, and the waitress was very helpful with the popular vegetarian selections. I went with the Left Coast Burger Reuben. I was not disappointed. The burger itself was good and didn't taste like a boca burger loaded with protein substitute but rather a patty loaded with lentils and veggies. The rueben part of the burger was also tasty. The pretzel bun was not overwhelmingly heavy or pretzel-y, if that makes any sense. The creamy special sauce and crunchy slaw made for a nice mix of textures and flavors.  I had the fries with chipotle seasoning, and to be honest, I couldn't really tell.

And now I'm kicking myself that it took me so long to discover this place. They have a great (large) beer selection, both on tap and bottles. The hardest decision for me is always what beer to get. The solution? I have multiple, that makes the decision making easier :) I'm not a meat eater but I've come here a few times now with burger loving friends & family and it always gets an enthusiastic two thumbs up on the burgers. I have the Strange Famous veggie burger and it is darn good. For sure one of the best veggie burgers I've had in Chicago, hands down. And oddly enough, Sage Francis, who is listed as a collaborate on the burger, is someone I met back when I lived in Minneapolis and was a regular in the underground hip hop scene there. So when I eat the burger, it brings back warm fuzzy memories and I feel 22 again!!  Last but not least, they have CHEESE CURDS. All three of my siblings went to the UW Madison so there's a special place in my belly for cheese curds. I can recall many a time spent on State St eating curds & drinking beer. Again with the bringing back the warm fuzzy memories. Maybe that's why I love this place so much?

I went from a girl who can drink any guy under the table to a girl who falls off of tables after a cranberry vodka.  So here I am legal to drink & with an app like yelp I can find a place like Bad Apple. Remembering I convinced myself I will never EVER like beer, I get handed a beer list when I sit down. I give it back, but soon I feel like I am missing out on something. I ask for the beer menu back. I have no idea what I am getting myself into. The waitress suggests a good one for my taste, 5 Rabbit is the craft beer name and it is on tap Ha-leh-LOO! Â It came in a nice decent size glass for only $5! Steal for a deal this place is already. And the best thing is that our waitress, Kate hit the nail right on the head with 5 rabbit. It was smooth, crisp. I can taste the honey and hibiscus in the beer and it was 9%, but it did not hit me until later. I savored my first one and drank the second one down like it was no body's business.

We haven't gone out to eat much in the last 4 months, but yesterday we decided to bring him in for the first time. My aunt and uncle were in town, and my parents came with us too, so we had 6 adults and a baby with a foldable stroller with a removable carseat. The large round table in the main area was available, but the host told us that there wasn't room for a stroller near that table, so he seated us in the back room with another large (loud) party with two newborn crying babies. The room was so dark that we couldn't see each other or our food even though it was the middle of the day, and our baby seemed frightened. My aunt has a hearing problem, and we were seated right next to a speaker blasting loud hip hop, so no one could talk. The service was oddly slow, and the food wasn't as good as we remembered - my mother, aunt and I all ordered the Southwestern cobb salad, which was incredibly salty, and my husband's veggie burger was bland and undercooked. If they're going to ghettoize large parties with strollers, they should at least fix up the back room so it's as nice as the other rooms (regular lighting? softer music?). Lincoln Square is a neighborhood with a lot of babies, so it doesn't seem smart to alienate their parents by seating them in the punishment corner. They also used to rotate the art occasionally, but they've had the skeleton art up for a long time now, and I would recommend that they go ahead and rotate it out.

No, I am not a veggie nor a vegan, but I am no longer eating dairy thanks to a little something called lactose intolerance. I ordered the legends of the daal without feta or yogurt and honestly, was worried about how tasty a veggie wrap in a burger joint would be. Our server asked me if I was vegan and I told her no, but it turns out that she asked because they have different serveware for the vegans and veggies. Wow! We had a short conversation about how cool it was that they catered to the meatless, animal by-product free crowd and I learned that many of their staff were vegan/veggies, and one of the owners was also a veggie. As a result, they're very sensitive to having good alternatives eating from serveware that has never known meat in its inanimate life. Having been a vegetarian for a few years of my life, I can certainly appreciate the places that go out of their way to appease a minority crowd. Oh, the fries weren't that good, and the ketchup was not better than Heinz, albeit had a unique (non-ketchupy) flavor. My daal wrap? Delicious.",0.9874,0.754,0.181,0.064,0.577281746031746

Â This place has a tome of a beer list so after a brief discussion with bartender extraordinaire, Andy, who really knew his stuff, another extraordinary beer was found and happiness reigned again. As for this girl- I know a Miller Lite is not what you order in a place like this so our favorite bartender was put into service again as he found me something that would satisfy. Now I hear this place gets packed on Friday and Saturday nights, but on this Sunday afternoon- they were able to seat us right away at a great table in the back and we quickly ordered the chacuterie plate to take a little of the edge off. Â This plate had three types of meat (the peppered bacon was to die for) and three kinds of cheese, along with 6 different sauces and soft pretzel bread to eat it on. Â A great way to start! Burgers are king here and their list had me doing flashbacks to Kuma's. Â Being the ""plain Jane"" that I am, I went with the Bad apple burger which was your basic burger with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato ,pickle and onion. Â But my friend?

I've tried several of them and you can't go wrong. Tonight, I tried the Happy Belly sandwich which featured pork belly, pear, and arugula on a pretzel bun. It was cooked perfectly, and the pear provided and interesting contrast. I will definitely order it again. Their fried are nothing special (I can see why they offer so many additional seasonings, but at 75 cents? give me a break) but their homemade ketchup is the best I've ever tasted. Seriously, it's amazing. Heinz can totally suck it.  Anyway, onto the beer. They have an extensive list of really interesting beers. I recommend doing a beer flight at least once. I've tried both the light and dark beer flights on several occasions (the beers change seasonally) with my beau and each one has been quite the experience. I rarely tasted a beer which I would be willing to order on its own. Some of them are really unpalatable but regardless the flight is a lot of fun for beer lovers.  The only thing that keeps me from giving the whole 5 star enchilada is their average fries and the fact that they have TVs. True, the TVs are in the bar area, but there are a lot of tables in the bar area. I can't imagine they have a lot of people come in just to watch sports when there are two sports bars right across the street. It just doesn't fit the style of the restaurant.

I had the big Texan burger which has three onion rings, pulled pork and served on Texas toast. The pulled pork was absolutely tasteless. The onion rings offered nothing at all and the toast was dry. I had to get a side of barbecue sauce to get through it. I've also had a sandwich here which was forgettable. Another thing that bothered me about this place was their ketchup. I think I remember reading that they make their own there. It flat out blows. Is Heinz really that much? Poor choice. Also the fries were soggy and way too greasy. And their service seriously lacks. We hardly saw our server and when we did she asked us how our food was. I told her that it wasn't that great and she actually said great and walked away. Where do they find these people?

We didn't want to spend an obscene amount of money and we wanted to have a low key NYE where people weren't going crazy. Bad Apple was exactly what we were looking for. We made a late dinner reservation for 9 PM and started off with few rounds of appetizers and drinks. Our table shared the fries, cheese curds, goat cheese fondue dip, olives and the poutine. I tried everything except the fondue and the poutine. I loved the curds which had a breading that was similar to tempura. The fries were ok, and we felt like we overdid it with those since they came with most of our entrees. I heard that the fondue and poutine were wonderful. Our service was wonderful. The waitress was very attentive and even split the checks for us which saved a huge headache at the end of the night. We all ordered different burgers and sandwiches for our entrees. I had the PB&J sandwich while my husband had the Strange Famous veggie burger. My sandwich was OK, and his veggie burger was interesting. I think we probably would have enjoyed them more if we didn't stuff ourselves so much with apps. By the end of the night we were trying to calculate in our heads how much the total would be.

We were seated in about 10 minutes (quicker than the 20 the hostess promised). We ordered cocktails to start ... I got something that was basically a gimlet with grapefruit juice; my ladywife got something called ""Kitchen Kool-aid,"" which was very tasty. The cocktail list in general was quite creative. Â We ordered the goat cheese fondue appetizer, which was on par with what I'd had at other restaurants; predictably good and cheesy, nothing that stood out. I ordered the Squash da Beef, a hamburger with a squash puree on top, and Old Bay fries. The fries were top-notch; some of the best I've had. Spring for the additional seasoning option for 75 cents. They have some good choices. The burger was so-so. The beef was good and flavorful and cooked just right; however, the squash on top was weird. It was cold, which I thought was strange, and kind of flavorless. My ladywife got the Frenchie with a veggie patty, and truffle fries. She oohed and ahhed over the fries (I snuck a taste and can confirm that they were really good), and said her burger was tasty, too.  Their beer list is very extensive, with some very interesting and affordable brews. For their draughts you have the option of ordering a 1 oz for $1, so you can taste a couple. I had the St. Bernardus Christmas, a sweet and spicy holiday beer.  All told, like I said, a four-star meal. Why the three-star rating? The ladywife loves dessert, and she always asks to see the dessert menu at the beginning of the meal, so she can order her entree accordingly. She asked for one and the server (who had been super friendly up til then) retorted ""You're drinking dessert.""  ""I'm sorry?"" H asked, startled and confused. ""We don't have dessert,"" she answered. Then laughed awkwardly. I think that she was probably trying to make a friendly joke, but it came across kind of rude. Like I said, she'd been very friendly up to then and was afterwards as well. Still, it was a bit off-putting. Looking forward to going back to use our second $25 gift certificate (apparently you can only use one at a time ... and we'll have to go soon; they expire at the end of this month).

My friend called the Bad Apple and they had the ale, so we were off. I was pleasantly surprised. Atmosphere was a good mix of lively yet still able to hear your dinner companions. We started off in the bar waiting for a table. Huge beer selection, probably rivals Hopleaf, but plenty of valid options for the non-beer drinkers as well. As someone who drinks beer minimally I sometimes feel stupid ordering a cocktail at a ""beer"" place, but not here.

Once we sat down our server was friendly and funny, even making jokes with my tipsy friend. Lots of interesting and off-beat options for burgers, maybe even more creative than the ones at Kuma's (which, admittedly, I think is overrated). I counted at least 3 or 4 veggie options, which is pretty good at a burger place, so vegetarians need not stay away. I got the Edmund Fitzgerald burger (goat cheese, bacon fig relish and grilled onions) and truffle fries, both of which were cooked perfectly. So many fry options our party decided to each get different ones so we could try a few. Yeah, their ketchup is a bit different, but I didn't want any ketchup to cover the taste of the truffle oil anyway.

Â We live in the neighborhood and enjoy supporting local businesses... unfortunately, with a baby, we don't actually get out much. Â  The stars aligned and we were able to *gasp* eat out for lunch on a Sunday - such a treat these days! Â After a little discussion, we decided to try the Bad Apple. Â What a waste of a (for us) special occasion :(. Â  We were seated in the ""side room"" a.k.a. the holding area for people who bring kids to restaurants, extra sticky, and full of germs. Â I understand why restaurants separate the families, but we're with an infant - she's not running around, yelling or disrupting customers in any other way.

Â  Â  Anyway, back to our meal, the reason we're at the Bad Apple anyway. Â My husband ordered a burger, which was ""ok, good for this neighborhood"" by his review, hence the 2 stars.  I ordered the You've Got Mozzy, which was described as roasted tomato, argula and mozzarella on sourdough. Â It was the worst thing I have ever tasted. period. Â The bread was stale and had no sourdough flavor. Â The arugula was good, but hardly a meal, the mozzarella was flavorless, and the ""roasted tomatoes"" was a misnomer. Â I expected a tomato, roasted. Â Instead, the sandwich was covered with some sort of cold tomato sauce dripping with oil and filled with an overwhelming rosemary flavor - blech. Â Overall, the sandwich tasted like a badly flavored crouton at an all-you-can-eat salad bar. Â I was really, really hungry (it's difficult to find time to eat with an infant!) so I choked down about 1/2 the sandwich but couldn't eat anymore. Â  Sadly, not even the fries could compensate, and fill my hungry tummy. Â Mine came out lukewarm and burned. Â I might not have minded the ""unusual"" ketchup if the fries had been good, but when all I wanted was to cover the icky burnt flavor by drowning the fries in ketchup, it was a disappointment.  We brought the horrible meal to our servers attention. Â She was polite about it but did not offer to bring out warm fries, another entree, or anything edible.

In the back they have shuffleboard. I friggin' love shuffleboard.  There were several burgers on the menu that sounded tasty. Â I went with the Red Dragon, a burger topped with brisket hash, an over easy egg, pepper jack, & roasted red pepper sauce. I opted to upgrade my fries to truffle fries. The burger came out with a perfect yolk, begging to be popped. I placed the other half of the bun on top and did my duty. It was delicious. Â The brisket hash was very apparent. Â It tasted as though it had been properly smoked! The portion was good. This burger reminded me what I had once forgotten...that you don't need a pretzel bun to have a delicious burger. Although if you must, they do offer pretzel buns with some of their burgers. The fries were nice and toasty, but I would have preferred truffle oil rather than truffle salt. Â Nevertheless, they weren't bad. The ketchup they provide is homemade. I asked for a side of chipotle sauce...they told me they had chipotle ranch. Even better!

2011-10-23,4.0,"Living up on the north side it's always great to see neighborhoods like Lincoln Square and North Center getting better bars with wider selections of beer and food. Located on the northwest corner of 4300 N Lincoln, you'll find Bad Apple packed on the weekend with plenty of people waiting in line for some eats and drink. Drink-wise I kept my selection simple: Green Flash Double Stout. Somehow this brew had 8.8% ABV but was smooth as a stout with half the ABV. This Green Flash might be my new favorite beer, with seemingly as deep of a beer menu as Hopleaf or Map Room, the possibilities were truly endless. Bad Apple also boasts a cocktail menu, beer cocktail menu, and there are an endless varieties of beers on tap along with ciders. Food wise, I have yet to try any appetizers but I've had the Frenchie burger twice and am addicted. Upgraded to pretzel roll and bacon, the Frenchie is loaded with spinach, brie, and fried onions. Ordered medium rare, the burger comes with a good shade of red. Fries come with options, I usually add garlic and truffle. If you are looking for something interesting on the northwest side and have a craving for fine beers and a wicked burger, do yourself a favor and head on to Bad Apple.",0.9377,0.792,0.141,0.066,0.5031341991341991

I ordered truffle fries, but all I could taste was the salt. Â I was literally dusting the salt off of my fries. Â On the flip side, the onion rings on the Red Dragon were amazing and not at all salty and you could taste the freshness of the oil used to deep fry the batch. Â Yum. Â The creole fries were delicious too. Â I'm conflicted, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, very possible. Â Also, the house ketchup was great, I could actually tell it originated from a tomato. Service - Our waiter wasn't memorable, not very helpful when we asked for suggestions, and overall just didn't talk much.

My first visit, I had the fig and goat cheese burger. Here's one complaint...being that I am pregnant and obsessed with goat cheese I had to make sure that there version was a domestic, pasteurized option. I was told that it wasn't so I had to switch out my beloved goat cheese for a white cheddar...eh, very disappointing. The burger itself was very overcooked. I ordered it medium to medium well and it came back extremely well done. I also wasn't a huge fan of our waitress this time. She was really rather non interested in our table and upon my second visit, with an awesome waitress who actually went and found out about the cheese selection - I learned that our waitress the first time provided us with some not so accurate information. Therefore, I could have had the goat cheese and would have been much more delighted.  The second visit, my burger was better prepared. I had the Frenchie and loved loved loved the excessive amount of brie flavor. I had the firecracker, chipotle, and truffle fries and in this case the truffle fries win.

We stopped in on opening night over two years ago and continue to go on an average of once a week since. The burgers are inventive, original, consistent, and perfectly sized so that you are full but not in a coma. The pulled pork sandwich is the best I have ever had in Chicago, it is true backyard bbq and should not be overlooked. The beer selection is notoriously amazing, this is a true beer lovers restaurant. With so much great beer on tap it must be really hard to update the menus but they somehow manage to do this, putting nearly every other quality beer destination to shame. Since it would be impossible to update menus mid-day, you are ALWAYS told what is not on tap immediately by the staff. Just one of the many reasons that I would rate the service 10/10 every single time I have visited. Even the things I could care less about are above average. The decor/art/lighting are dark, comfortable, and a bit ""metal""...in other words: perfect. Unlike a notable competitor, they are not actually blasting metal at full volume to a sea of people who have been waiting for 3 hours in an un-ventilated room.

Â I've been here twice now and I've left satisfied both times - by the tremendous burgers (it's NYC's Pat Lefrieda beef!) and fries (with several seasoning options!) and the great beer list. I haven't had anything on the starter menu but I really want to try the Poutine. In my trip to Toronto and Montreal I indulged in this north of the border treat and I was hooked. Surprisingly, I haven't had it in the states yet, but it's not like I see it on menus every day. Oh, and the cheese curds look killer. I spent 4 years going to college in Wisconsin, cheese curds are part of my DNA now. Yes, I know, but my DNA mutated while in Wisco. I haven't tried anything else, really, for that matter - except for a bit of my friend's El Bandito, and it was a tasty sandwich that I'd like to spend some more time with. The two burgers I've had so far are as follows: the Black 'N Blue and the Frenchie. Both really just great burgers. The one thing I noticed about the BA burgers is that you can really taste the quality and freshness of the beef. I've been to burger joints where I'm enjoying a decent burger but you the beef flavor doesn't stand out, I end up tasting more of the other ingredients mixed with the burger. Not here. The flavor really stands out and I can taste all the ingredients individually.  Make sure you get the burger medium-rare. It's how all cow parts should be cooked...well not all cuz there some parts I just won't eat. But burgers of this quality (I'd cook the hell out of beef from Jewel tho) should be cooked the right way. BA does it right, with a nice crisp outside and a medium-rare juicy inside. Â The Black 'N Blue burger is topped with really nice blue cheese sauce made with Pranqster Ale and the Frenchie has a nice slab of brie, some frizzy onions, spinach and truffle mayo. How can you go wrong. The fries are pretty good here too. Not the best, but definitely appetizing. Add on some of BA's seasoning choices (I like the Old Bay and the firecaracker) to kick up your fries and then get a good beer from the expansive selection of draft or bottled and get down on a good meal in a bar that has a good atmosphere (not too crazy but has enough TVs to watch a game and not be surrounded by a bunch of hipsters).",0.993,0.759,0.165,0.076,0.5133928571428572

Sometimes with specialty burger places the patty is too large and I can barely get through a half once the snazzy toppings are added. This burger was perfectly sized so that I could enjoy the delicious burger and the great toppings (brie, spinach & truffle mayo - umm... yum!) Oh, and you can customize your fries. Extra truffle oil can't hurt anyone in my opinion, so why not put that on there too? =) I cannot wait to come back to this place and try some more of their specialty burgers and see what is new on draft.",0.9954,0.745,0.241,0.014,0.550230364873222

Never would have thought that peanut butter and meat would taste so good. I liked how the peanut butter on the burger and the ketchup was restaurant made.

I went with my family, who are notoriously difficult to please - I am a hardcore foodie, my sister has a 6-year-old's taste in food and doesn't eat red meat, my mother is on a Gestapo low-carb diet, and my father has pathological difficulties ordering food. Nevertheless, this place had something to please everybody. My ""Happy Belly"" sandwich had perfectly seared pork belly (crispy, and with just enough fat rendered to keep it from being greasy), a delectable tarragon mustard dressing, and was served an above average pretzel roll. My sister's veggie burger was a crowd pleaser (how often do you see that in writing?!), my mother's eggplant salad was great, and my father managed to find a brisket sandwich on texas toast that was very good, and they even had a superfluous bowl of olives that pleased his obsession with small plates. The beer list was exceptional - I had 2 beers (Great Divide Yeti, Ska Decadent Imperial IPA), both from Colorado and both delectable. The service was also great; our server managed to come off as being legitimately enthusiastic about the offerings without sounding cornball or contrived, which in my experience makes him the waitstaff equivalent of a unicorn. I was unaware that such people existed. I actually accepted his beer recommendation, which my friends will tell you is almost unheard of.  My lone gripe is with the fries. The garlic fries were excellent and crack-like in terms of their addictiveness, but the truffle fries were too scantily truffled; I felt like when I ate a fry, I had a 50/50 chance of tasting truffle on the fry.

I settled on ""The Hangover"", which was house glazed ham, over-easy egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, ketchup, mayo, mustard, provolone & fries on a pretzel bun. Gigantic burger, lots of ingredients (but a good mix), tasty eating. The burger itself on a pretzel bun makes for a pretty nice pairing. The fries were standard, nothing spectacular. The beer selection was excellent as well.  From what I can tell, this place was less on the trendier side...which is a good thing. A little bigger than some of the spots that I've been at, this is definitely a place that you can sit, hang out, grab a beer with friends and watch the game. Not very crowded, either...love that aspect too. Although the heavily tattooed woman behind the bar kind of freaked me out. It was like if I started a bar fight, she'd immediately jump over the bar and smash both of our skulls. Ok sorry, maybe I exaggerated :) To tell you the truth she seated us, she was a very nice woman and the service was good.

We chose to dine and drink at the bar to be close to the taps and more importantly the beer. Important the beer is at this place. The burgers are tasty and filling, but nothing revelatory. I had the slow burn burger, which was good, but as a serious spice freak I was expecting a little more oomph from the hot peppers, no teary eyes or fuming from the ears with this one. My brother had the Texan Burger (or something to that effect) with pulled pork and onions rings which I tasted. This is the burger I would get the next time I visit. Though the true star of the food options here is the cheese curds. No pre-packaged or frozen curds that you find on your plate 90% of the time. Service was quick and friendly. The customers all seemed to be in good spirits, although this could probably be said for anywhere in the city on Friday at 5pm. The other gems at the Bad Apple are obvious. A great selection of beer. Unfortunately, I only had time to stay for one with my meal. There are many great foreign and domestic craft brews that will surely tempt me to come back.

2011-03-24,3.0,"Apparently, quite a few Yelpers feel a more apt name for The Bad Apple would be The Bad Ketchup. Â I am not of the same opinion and am seriously stunned at all of the whining about a...condiment. Â Many Yelpers seem to feel they have the power of a higher being to change the world with a few strokes of their wittle fingers, but harping on ketchup? Â This is a new low, Yelpers. Â Goodness. Â  I decided, after reading a bunch of reviews of The Bad Apple and its supposed bad ketchup, to take McKutie there for a somewhat late weekday dinner. Â The plan was actually to go to The Grafton if parking wasn't readily available at The Bad Apple, but we were able to score free parking steps away quickly. Â So, off we went to score our ketchup dinners. Â Yum. The front bar area was full, so we were taken to the back room, where tables were plentiful. Â Our waitress came a few minutes later and asked, ""You guys need anything to drink?"" Â That's a direct quote. Â Harbinger of the subsequent service. Â It's a good thing we didn't ask for water, as none was ever placed on the table. Â  We both took a few minutes to peruse the beer list. Â All 100 beers on a list is going to do is confuse me. Â I like beer, but I'm no beer geek. Â I quickly found a Great Lakes Irish something or other, trusted that and went with it. Â Good call, McGuffin. Â I prayed McKutie wouldn't try to order a Miller Lite, and I talked her into an Allagash White, which, in my opinion, is crap but nowhere near the sewer emulsifier that Miller Lite is. Â Did I use that word right? Â  Next, we ordered the mini ham sandwiches as our appetizer. Â I noticed they had cheese curds on the menu as soon as our waitress walked away and wanted to change it, but the mini ham sandwiches were ultimately very tasty. Â Recommended. We both ordered The Bad Apple burger medium well. Â The common threads are scary, but it's a cute scary. Â I would rate The Bad Apple's burger higher than Jury's down the street. Â The fries, however, were a disappointment. Â They came out lukewarm and limp. Â They tasted good, but you know how quickly fries go bad. Â Fries need to be eaten straight out of the fryer like a New York Yelper, i.e. while they're hot, quickly and before they even leave the server's paws if you can. Since it's such a hot topic at The Bad Apple, let's go back to that ketchup. Â You know what? Â I thought the ketchup was quite tasty and pleasingly tangy. Â You want to know what the problem with the ketchup was? Â Well, the bottle was nearly empty and was squirting air when I wanted more. Â You want to know where the waitress was? Â I don't know. Â It's likely she was off pouting or being gruff elsewhere. Â She gave the second worst service I've ever had in my life. Â (Hello, La Mediterranee. Â Oh, I mean Marrakesh. Â Sneaky bastards changed their name and threw on a coat of paint. Â You aren't fooling anyone, pal!). Â Sorry, now I'm trying to change the world with my wittle fingers. Â I digress. Lastly, I have to say something about the motif. Â The walls are painted red, and much of the art and decor centers around the use of skulls. Â Okay, I get it. Â The Bad Apple and a death motif. Â I don't think it works, boss. Â Perhaps this is some sort of thing the hipsters (there were plenty of them in there) think is ""cool?"" Â No, man. Â Just no. Â  Here's my suggestion coming from my wittle fingers for The Bad Apple to make the world a better place: change the name, change the decor/motif, ditch that waitress, cut the beer list at least in half, keep the burgers, keep the mini ham sandwiches and, last but not least and very importantly, keep the ketchup! The burgers are five stars. Â The service is one star. Â The decor and vibe are one star. Â Because grub is paramount in my mind, I'll give you three-and-one-half stars, Bad Apple.

2011-03-14,5.0,"During my heavily food-oriented visit to Chicago, I had a strong desire to compare two allegedly legendary local burger and beer strongholds, Kuma's and the Bad Apple, especially as they seem to be quite customarily compared to each other. Â The first stop was Kuma's (yesterday), which was remarkable in its obscene noise level and unpleasant bum's-rush-at-our-backs vibe as we sat attempting to enjoy ourselves in the roar of the bar. Â I enjoyed my food (mac and cheese and iron maiden), though I felt the toppings in both overwhelmed the innate taste of the ingredients. Â However, as this is a review of the Bad Apple, I will complain no further about the atmosphere or cheap ingredients I experienced at Kuma's. That's the preface! Â Here's the non-industrial meat of the review: I liked the Bad Apple much better. Â One plus, perhaps one that dates me (I am an old-timer in my 30s), is that non-shouted conversation is possible. Â I loved that. Â I also loved the encyclopedic beer selection--and that was just the draft list. Â What surprised me somewhat more was the thought and care that also went into the cocktail list, so we also tried some of those. Â When I see ""house infused"" ANY liquor, I know that a caring ""mixologist"" is involved at some stage. But while the drink selection was stunning in its length and diversity (from Sri Lankan to ""across the street"" beers), I would like to give special notice to the burgers and fries. Â They are not like Kuma's. Â They are notably better. Â You can taste the quality of the meat. Â You can taste the quality of the not shoveled on ingredients. Â The balance is harmonious. Â I had the Left Coast Reuben (suitably, as I live on this ""left"" coast) and my friend had the Red Spruce Springsteen. Â Both were lovely. Â When I say ""lovely,"" I mean I spent one hour slowly savoring this burger with frequent exclamations of joy (that became somewhat repetitive). Â I hear the ketchup had a sketchy history, but it seems the recipe has improved since the vulgar days of patrons ""bringing their own."" Â If you are looking for a corn-laden sludge, you will not like this. Â I detected no corn notes. Â Instead, the ketchup has a subtle spiciness (perhaps allspice?)--but if you like curry ketchups and the like, you will probably like this. Â The fries, I would like to add, are not very salty. Â If you like to taste potato, you will like these. If you prefer salt flavor, you may want to relocate. I may have become long-winded in this review; however, I am still glowing in the ""aftermath"" of this meal, which I am already excited to repeat. Â Essentially, I recommend this restaurant/bar to serious drinkers who like to discuss their favorite libations with a thoughtful, attentive, and intelligent staff--none of whom dropped the ball at any time in the five hours we were delighted to spend at the Bad Apple. Â I equally recommend this place to people who prefer burgers with high quality, non-industrial ingredients who are not tempted by gimmickry. I thank the entire staff at the Bad Apple for such a delightful and memorable experience. Â Tot ziens!",0.9971,0.759,0.189,0.051,0.6119265873015872

2011-03-07,2.0,"Disclaimer: I usually travel to Bad Apple per the request of my shuffleboard loving friends. So shuffleboards are cool and fun, but Bad Apple wants to make sure you don't have too much because there are dining customers in the other room. I think this is my biggest hang up, as I will get to the food and the service in a moment, because it begs the question ""why have something if you can't fully enjoy it."" I was recently asked to leave the restaurant by one of the owners for ""insulting her staff"" when enjoying my time there and being a tad bit loud; as being loud and enjoying yourself where there is beer and games can happen. I was insulted and will not ever go back. HOWEVER  to be a fair reviewer of food and service and other things FOOD The food is good. They have creatively invented different burgers that please the senses in multiple taste variations and they cook their meat fairly well as a few times when ordering a medium rare I received a well cooked burger. It happens. Thats why I say good. Fries are better seasoned than dipped in tomatoes, no question.  DRINK The drink selection is great. For a restaurant. Don't confuse this for a bar, and dont pretend you know about beer when you order. SERVICE So they know about their beer. The service staff there is great, super friendly, funny and generally enjoyable to talk to. Whenever you need a suggestion or a friendly barb about your selection of beer the staff will politely oblige. So its not much to look at on the inside, dark and not necessarily complimenting to the atmosphere. I am not sure why they insist on placing flat screen tv's at the bar and in the ""game room"" as the confuse the entire lighting arrangement. The shuffle board is great although they need more sand, and its nice to play Galaga, but not while people are eating. Overall I think that Bad Apple should bit the bullet and just rid themselves of the slightest idea that they would be an enjoyable bar and stick to building credibility as a restaurant. The food is good but can be better and the atmosphere is like an adolescent boy in theater club wondering if its ok that he is going to a sports event after.

We sat in the back half of the restaurant, which was very open, not too noisy and a little chilly.  The Pros:  -Great beer list  -Decent burger selection with interesting options. I got the Red Spruce Springsteen and enjoyed it. It wasn't the ginormous burger you get from Kuma's, so it was a good option for a hearty burger without overdoing it.  -Burger patties were cooked perfectly to order  -fries were a-ok. One of us got the chipotle seasoned fries which were spicy and good. I got the regular fries which tasted good on their own (more on the homemade ketchup in the cons).  -Good host  The Cons:  -Service was slow. While our server was friendly and nice, it took a long time for her to take our drink order, return with our beers and take our dinner order.  -Beet salad was not so good.  -Husband's red dragon burger was cooked fine and had some heat but was completely devoid of flavor.  -the homemade ketchup was d.i.s.g.u.s.t.i.n.g and tasted like plain, watery, tomato paste. Gross! If I return, I would honestly think about stashing my own bottle of heinz- it was really that bad.  -our table was near the wait stand and the bus buy noisily threw dirty plates into the bus tub every so often which was distracting and unnecessary.  -Pretzel buns on some burgers are considered an ""upgrade"" and cost extra.  All in all, I would return if I don't feel like waiting at Kumas and don't feel like traveling the extra few blocks up to the Grafton. So honestly, a return trip isn't likely.",0.9511,0.799,0.136,0.065,0.5137728937728937

I ordered the Earthly as my main course, which is truffled goat cheese, spinach and thinly sliced portabella mushrooms on a super soft rosemary bun. OMG, HEAVEN. The goat cheese pleased me greatly. This was such a good sammich. I don't usually like portabella mushrooms (people don't know how to prepare them and they taste like dirt), but this was divine.

2011-01-27,4.0,"From the food, to the dj spinning tunes, to the cool art and the ultimate affordable beer list, Bad Apple is a winner! Went on a Thursday night with another couple. We got there a little late and missed out on their cheese curds. They raved about them. So we decided to get the poutine, just to prove that, yeah, we can have cheese curds too...but ours will have fries and gravy on top! The poutine was good, if a tad bit too salty. There was a lot of it, so we had to force ourselves to stop picking at it before we ate our entrees. The entrees, I'll get to those in a minute. I want to tell you about the beer list. Holy Cripes! It's extensive, and by extensive, I mean 8-10 pages long extensive. The hubs and his pal had a slightly smoky/meaty flavored beer that they didn't particularly like (Left Hand Fade to Black), but at ~$4.00 a pint, it didn't break the bank. Soooo many good beers to choose from. Plus they serve cocktails and wines too, so if beer ain't your tipple, something else will grab ya. For dinner I had the best ""gourmet"" burger I've had in a long time. The Edmund Fig-gerald. Fig and bacon relish, goat cheese, smoked onions all on top of a perfectly cooked medium burger. Fig sounds like a weird topper to a burger, but honest to god, it mixed with the goat cheese and onions like, whoa! It was amazing! The other diners at our table had non-burger dishes. 2 were deemed ""meh"", the other was the Pork-a-licious, which despite a heinous name, was greeted by oohs and aahs by the eater.  Price-wise, I believe the four of us rolled out of there, belly's full of food and beer, for ~$115-120 (including tip). Seriously, for all the food we ate and beer we drank that is not bad at all!

Â This is really a 3.5 review, and I am betting for a 4-star update in the near future. Â Read on! Let's hear about what I saw:  The bar area is decorated with NIN-inspired animal skeletons in industrial equipment. Â There are also flat-screen TVs showing football and glossy wooden high-boy tables with attached benches. Â The clientele was similarly mixed: there were at least two of the under-three set, a table of girls'-night-outters, a handful of dressed-up daters and the table next to us was a family with a dad who had many questions about the menu. Â Many. Â Oh, and we also saw one of the aforementioned daters take a world-class stumble in the middle of the bar, then almost get nailed by a bottle tossed into the recycling by a bartender. Â If you, like me, are entertained by this sort of thing, 1) shame on us and 2) I can't guarantee that it would happen while you're there. Â  Let's hear about what I ate: I was torn between my two favorite sandwiches: housemade veggie burger and portobello mushroom. Â The burger (Strange Famous) won this round in part because of the goat cheese and baby spinach on top, but also partly because of my mood and its ability to dictate my life. Â The burger itself has a lot of mushroom, garbanzos, corn and seitan, and there was a hot kick in there too from something not listed. Â I removed some of the very generous goat cheese and had the red onion and sage marmalade on the side. Â Still, we're talking about a ton of good things in a humble little burger. Â I also had a bite of the Rosemary's Chicken sandwich, which was, as Matthew McConaughey would say, ""Alright, alright, alright."" Â The fries were nothing special, but there's a list of add-ons to choose from for $.75 more. Â   Â   Let's hear about what I'll drink next time: The drink menu is huge on beer, but there's also a section on beer cocktails. Â Perhaps you are inquisitively cocking your head to the side like a dog, but these pairings sound really great. Â The first one that caught my eye is a pear cider with Tanqueray (Apple Pie), but there's a wide range of inventive combos. Â  A word on what I heard: Lots of beat- and base-heavy music, including the Beastie Boys. Â It was almost too sexy to have on while watching football and eating fries.

I came here for a girls night out (we're girls who eat) over the summer and again with the manfriend recently. Great burgers, great drinks, and ridiculous fried cheese curds. Seriously. Eff your diet and eat some. I tried two different burgers, but of course I'm not sure which. Mf had a spicy one but it was so spicy he couldn't taste anything by the end. We were warned that it was spicier than normal, but why serve that? I watched him pick entire jalapeno cores with seeds and all off of his burger. Â Come on Bad Apple, that's not cool. Service was ok and Mf was ok with his fire burger, but wants to try something else. Actually, he wanted to move in so he could try different burgers every day.

Wonderful beer selection, fabulous burgers and a kid friendly area secluded from the main restaurant - I may have died and gone to burger heaven. Just don't tell my doctor.  The only downside was running out of several menu items. Being a Sunday, their fried cheese curds were no longer in supply as were a few other items. It's a Sunday, I guess it happens?

Men toasting one another with large gold studded steins while jester's do magic tricks - you know, the whole medieval thing. My assumption proved true; at least about the taste of my beer. It was nothing short of perfection in a glass. The burger was outstanding. I went with the traditional (Bad Apple burger) sans pretzel bun. It was juicy and bursting with flavorful burger prowess.

The Bad Apple was not what I expected in a lot of ways. Some good, some bad. The restaurant itself is not at all what I expected. I thought it was more bar, less restaurant. When we arrived at noon on a Sunday there were BABIES there. I was not at all prepared for that, but they were quiet so whatever. That beer list was insane. Finally I looked at our server (who was awesome) and said, ""um, I know nothing about beer. I drink crap beer mostly. Help me."" So I let him pick, and he surprised me with Allagash. It was okay. I didn't love it, but I definitely didn't hate it. We started with the poutine, and my canadian friend was super excited because I guess this is genuine poutine except for the fact that the cheese wasn't melted/stringy. I tried it. I didn't love it. Sorry, Canada. I'm not the biggest fan of regular gravy, so that definitely didn't help. And you know how some people hate the word moist? I feel that way about the word ""curd.""

I got a burger - I think it was the regular Bad Apple burger - and added a pretzel bun. It was pretty good, but nothing earth shattering.

2010-08-22,4.0,"I am the undisputed Cheese Burger expert in the Windy City. Â Woke up this morning feeling slightly tired and hung over after attending an amazing party in the suburbs the night before. Â For a late lunch/early dinner today, I knew I would need just the right meal to absorb the liquor and jump start my system back to normal especially since I have to show up for work bright and early Monday morning. Â I have heard of so many new burger joints popping on the north side, today was the perfect day to try one of these new spots. Â  The Bad Apple is located on Lincoln just south of Lincoln Square, between Montrose and Irving Park. Over the years, this area has been built up with a ton of bars and restaurants. Â We conveniently found parking on a side street half a block away. Â The Bad Apple is located on the corner and has an outside eating area. My fiancÃ© and I decided to eat in doors. Â Inside the place is an open space with a large bar and bar tables & chairs laid out across the room. Â The back room which is attached and sectioned off by large curtains must have just been opened since it was completely empty. Â We decided to sit in this room since tables & chairs were normal height and I wanted to be waited on. Â The place is clean and nicely decorated. Â Television screens strategically placed in case your conversation stalled. Â The background music being played was a great mix of early hip hop and mash-ups. Â   Our waitress was professional and friendly. Â She knew the menu well and offered intelligent suggestions. Â During our meal, she checked on us regularly to make sure we were happy and didn't need anything else. Â The Bad Apple offers a variety of draft and bottled beer along with an incredible selection of burgers, salads, and starter items. Â To drink I ordered a ""WITTEKERKE"" which is a light beer from Belgium with a citrus flavor. Â Maggie ordered a ""LAGUNITAS MAXIMUS DOUBLE"" which was a darker beer with a hint of grapefruit, apple, and other pine flavors. Â Both beers were delicious! Each beer served in it's own unique glass. Â To eat I ordered the Mahalo burger, ""Ebel's weiss ham, grilled pineapple, honey cilantro vinaigrette, provolone cheese"". Â Maggie ordered the Big Texan, ""topped with house pulled pork, fried onion rings, BBQ sauce on Texas toast"". Â Both the burgers and beers were DIVINE! Â The burgers are served with house cut fries. I love house cut fries, but in my honest opinion the fries were over cooked. Â The ketchup and mustard tasted good, but was slightly off. Â I love going to a restaurant when I could tell for sure they are using French's and Heinz brand. Over all, The Bad Apple has a great location, friendly atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, great beer selection, great burgers. Â I would have to go back to see the fries being over cooked was a one time occurrence or served this way by design. Â I would also love to see them using original store brought bottles of ketchup and mustard. I give The Bad Apple 4 out of 5 stars.",0.9955,0.808,0.146,0.046,0.5609883995477217

Craving that Friday night burger and a beer I was. So I proceeded here undeterred by the memory of the former boite, Feed The Beast, and with many recent recommendations from friends and others. Well, this place is like the Oz of Brewskies. So many beers available on tap, and scores of others, domestic, craft, Half Acre from across the Â street. And many at prices like $4.00 or $4.50. I tried a variety myself: a darker ale, a ginger-tinged lighter ale, and the Half Acre IPA offering. I ordered the Evil or Devil burger with roasted Garlic, feta cheese, olives and roasted peppers. Sometimes, a burger is just a burger, but this one was one deliciously fresh flavor pairing. With the standard fries, which were delectable and a reasonable amount. Â So, a burger with fries and three beers for $24.00. This is less than I would pay at my even-more back yard burger spot, Rockwell's Neighborhood Grill. The staff and bartenders were great (I ate at the bar.) The other patrons were friendly and engaging, and I enjoyed the music, and the general din on Â a warm Friday evening. Even Mr. Muscled Loud Guy to my left Â with the his greying tee, and Radar from M.A.S.H cap, who by the way knew he was loud, and his buddies were at least talking food, steaks and Anthony Bourdain rather than, say, sports.

Got there a little early and while we were waiting decided to sample some of their beer. It's saying something when the beer selection his larger than the food menu WITH an extra insert just for the drafts. I started with the Founders Dirty Bastard ale, a Scotch style ale which was pretty good, not as malty a Scotch ale but good. I then tried Eric's Ale a spiced sour beer from the maker's of Fat Tire it was an interesting beer to say the least, more tart than sour and fruity, like a good lambic. I switched to the Domaine Dupage as my last one- a recent favorite. Oh wait, I ordered food too! As a starter I got the Montreal Poutine which was okay. I've actually had poutine before and the gravy really wasn't as rich or salty as I liked. The housemade ketchup was sweeter than used to but still pretty good.  On suggestion from my friend who had been there before I tried the Frenchie. A burger with brie, spinach, truffle and fried red onion strings. It was okay-it was good but I've had better burgers and not from a fancy burger place either. Our server was a little slow, but once our whole party showed up +4 extra he was all over the place.

2010-05-29,3.0,"For some reason I thought this place was considered a dive bar so when I walked into it I expected to see just that. I entered into a dark dimly lit bar with red glowing lights and felt as if I just walked into a vampire bordello but instead of bloodsuckers everywhere, there was hip day walkers. Being a Friday they did have some room at the bar but since I was with others we decided to go into a back room which was more lit and less lounge like. The waitress was very nice and helpful and dropped down this book which I thought was the menu only to open a extensive beer list. It was almost to difficult to pick a beer because there was too many to choose from. It was kind of like the menu at Cheesecake Factory where it's overwhelming so you just end up getting what you had last time.  Normally I start off with PBR or High Life but I decided to try a preselected beer flight since you can't make your own, bummer. As we waited we noticed they had all types of board games and realized that the tables around us where already in mid play. Instantly this reminded me of Guthrie's on Addison but not as comfy. We decided to play Scrabble and just as we start to play our beers come and my flight is huge and served on a paddle plank, almost no room for the game board now. I taste my first beer from the five offered and it taste sour and vinegary, gross I almost spit. I assume it's bad so I taste the second beer and it's the same. I get the waitress and tell her that I think the first two beers are from a bad tap. She says no because they are sour beers made from peach and other tart fruits so that's how they taste and they are considered excellent. I wish she had said that before, because I would have not chosen the flight and selected something more enjoyable. Despite the sourness, I down the first 2 because now I feel obligated, then I drink from the 3rd beer Â which tasted better, thank god. When I go to put the beer back on the paddle, the paddle has indented rings where the beers sit in. I accidentally place it on the lip of the indent and it spill all over the Scrabble board, triple soaked words and double letters floating all over. Felt like an ass but the staff came to our aid without rolling their eyes at me in judgment, which I appreciated. So all in all even though this place was not what I thought it was going to be, I rather enjoyed it and would definitely come back to try the food and just sit at the bar to get the insight on which beers are the better tasting and not made from sour fruit.

Nothing says unhealthy to me like burgers, fries, and beer, and the menu on the website made this place look like the perfect destination, and boy, was it. I had the Sir Loin burger, a burger complete with steak on top, as well as horseradish herb aioli, and provolone, with the garlic fries. The burger was wonderful, though the steak kept sliding out, and the fries were perfect. (Garlic is my weakness, apparently.) The creole fries were really good too, and not too spicy for a wimp like me. One great thing about this place is the HUGE beer list. We didn't even glance at the bottled list because they had so many interesting options on tap, and some have the option to dry a 1 oz serving for $1! A great way to get a feeling for some of the weirder options. My only real issue with this place was the noise level. The music was pretty loud, especially considering the conversation level was also pretty high. I understand loudness from conversation, but there's no need to crank up the music on top of that.

Â The place wasn't at capacity and there were alot of families in the back dining room. Â No bar tables open, so we opted to sit a the bar. The service is a little off putting. Â There was alot of gossiping and talking about customers behind the bar within our earshot. Â I'm not so naive to think that doesn't happen (I was a server, afterall), but it's a little rude to do it in front of customers seated at the bar. Â Service wasn't exactly attentive or engaging. Â Listen, I don't need a server to sit with me and be my best friend, but be friendly for goodness' sake! Â At least make eye contact when you are forced to speak to me. On to the food. Â The burgers were really good. Â Great beef, very flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium rare! Â Couple of comments are that I would prefer a thinner, wider patty. Â These are a little hockey puckish for my liking. Â The buns are just plain old, wimpy white buns. Â I don't even like they were toasted. Â You can order a pretzel bun for $1, but I think it's a little petty to charge extra for a better bun on a $9-$11 burger. Â The burger was piping hot and the cheese was nice and melty. Â Both burgers that we got were really good! I was happy with them. Â The fries were just ok and they weren't hot...boo to warm fries. The atmosphere is ok, nothing to write home about.

Smooth & luxurious."" i'm really Â bad at detecting certain flavors in beers, so i can't really comment much on it, except saying it was a good beer. onto the food menu, i've been having bad burger cravings, so i was obviously going to try a burger. i decided on the slow burner, ""Left Hand Milk Stout sautÃ©ed spicy chilies & onions, bacon, white cheddar."" it sounded really delicious, and spicy chilies was calling my name. and last minute we decided to get some fried cheese curds for an app. those were totally delicious, fried, yummy batter, and delicious dipping sauce. who could resist fried cheese? but here's where the stars begin to get taken away.  the slow burner, FAIL.  even people who are super sensitive to spiciness would say this isn't spicy AT ALL. the peppers were almost sweet tasting. not a bad thing, but when i want spicy, I WANT SPICY. and the burger meat itself. yeah, not amazing. there was almost no flavor to it, ,it was bland, and i ordered mine medium rare, but it was cooked more to a medium..not enough pink! i like my burgers super pink inside! even red! so this was disappointing. and the fries, yeah, i think i ate about 5 fries total. i love fries, and when the fries suck, YOU SUCK. no, but srsly, i was kind of disappointed.  im not saying i wouldn't be back. i would go back for the beers which were decently priced, and the cheese curds for sure.",0.9819,0.696,0.182,0.122,0.5556305916305916

Shortly after 1630 we walked into an empty, but charming bar that was balanced by exposed brick walls and bad art made by what I assumed to be a local high school art class.  The server was a gem of a lady with a haircut only a hipster's mother could love, men's plastic glasses - a fashion movement that has leaked all the way back to Iowa and an EXTENSIVE knowledge of the menu. Her recommendation was amazing, or was it just that everything on the menu was amazing so she could not go wrong? We had a grand time with a grand server, amazing food that was quite well priced.

They have good beer selection, which came in handy since even though they told us we would be waiting 30 mins for our table we didn't get seated for more like an hour and 15 mins. Needless to say, I was a little unhappy about that. Seriously, learn how to manage the front of your house. If you think it's going to be 30 mins, tell them it'll be 45, because nobody ever complains about getting seated too soon. And if you tell them 30 mins then when it hits 45 mins maybe you are just going to have to seat a group of two at a table that could seat 4 instead of continuing to skip over them for the bigger groups. It's not rocket science. But, they picked up the beers that we got at dinner, so I feel like I can't complain about it too much. And gave them the 4 stars anyway. We started with some cheese curds, which were yummy. Then I got the Frenchie (burger with spinach, brie, truffle and frizzled onions) and the guy I was with got the Big Texan (burger with pretzel bun, onion rings, pulled pork, bbq).

They stand for the Bad Apple's Pabst Blue Ribbon and pickle, mayo, and onion sandwich. I know, sounds awful to begin with, right? It didn't seem so. Apparently the pickle was house cured, and it was believable that they could put together a decent bar novelty at $1.75 for the sandwich. It was a steal, I couldn't say no. Unfortunately it nearly stole my hunger. After it was ordered my cohorts instantly began to question my choice, as did I. It literally tasted old. I asked for extra pickles yet they weren't on the sandwich, there was barely any mayo (dead space on a sandwich is a culinary crime), and the bread. . .well it was crusty. What followed was one of the most troubling 10 minutes of mind over sandwich as finally I discovered that the pickles were amazing by their lonesome and that if I had to eat this freak of nature, ketchup (yes, ketchup!) had to be added to the equation. In the end this place still deserves four stars for service and overall value. Our server Jessica was attentive enough to honestly ask how it was, and after receiving the same explanation gave me a free order of some really great fries. I might also add that had I gone with any of their well-priced ($8-10) sandwiches or burgers I would've been much happier, as they looked and apparently tasted incredible. And hey, this is the longest explanation for a single dish ever, so I guess it wasn't a total disaster. Plus, the beer list?

Although the salad had a little too much dressing for my taste, I thought that the flavor profile was terrific. They gave plenty of the little candied walnuts and fruit were perfection. I really appreciated that they gave the option for a small and a large. I never eat a lot in one sitting, and liked that I didn't have to pay for something I didn't want. The hubby ordered a burger ($9) with cramalized onions and mushrroms, and got it on a regular bun rather than the english muffin it was meant to come with. We ordered it medium rare, and guess what? It came out medium rare! It was juicy and delicious, but the real star were the fries. I ordered a side of gravy (.75) to go along with them, and Iw as in heaven. Hand cut and seasoned perfectly. I also had a milk stout beer ($5) which was delicious, and the hubby had a beer that I can't remember the name of. He found it to be too floral, but drank it anyway (ofcourse). Although the menu is limited, I would definitely come back here to eat. I'm not sure I'd hang out here as a bar goes. It was a little too quiet for me in that regard, but the food was upstanding.

2009-11-03,5.0,"I've eaten and drank here several times and have never had a bad experience. First off, fried cheese curds as an appetizer. Deep fried cheese served w/ranch dressing. How can anyone not order these? If I recall correctly, it's actually a misdemeanor in Wisconsin to not order deep fried cheese when made available to you. For the slightly more cholesterol conscious consumer, there's the mini ham sandwiches appetizer that his the spot with just the right amount of food for two people seeking some pre-meal pork provisions. They also have a goat cheese fondue appetizer that looks amazing and is currently on my ""to-do"" list. The menu is very heavily focused on burgers. Another reviewer (and the menu) mentions the burger meat is from Pat La Frieda in NYC, a company that has been in the business over 90 years. Hardly ""flavorless"" or worse than McDonald's as others on here have commented. The various combinations of toppings are enough to add extra flavor to the burger, but not enough to overpower the taste of the meat itself. It's a delicate balance that they have achieved. Please don't put ketchup on these! It'd be like putting A1 on a filet. I've heard good things about the house made veggie burger, but with so much meat on the menu, I can't justify ordering one. If I do, I'll be sure to request bacon on top. I've only strayed from the burger menu a few times but have not been disappointed. The stand out for me is the ham sandwich, but then again I'm partial to the pig. This is not some bush league, lazy ham sandwich that consists of sodium-laden deli ham slices. No, fellow pork aficionados, this is real deal ham off the bone and plenty of it. It is topped w/cheese and house pickled onions (and peppers, I think). The fries are just as nature intended. Hand-cut and crispy. If you want your fried spuds to have some company, don't grab the ketchup, but instead order any of the variety of seasoned fries. I like the garlic, curry and truffle oil. These are definitely in my top 5 favorite fries of Chicago. As for the drinks, allow me to summarize: The beer menu is physically larger than the food menu. If that isn't a sign from the heavens above, I don't know what is. The beer menu is expertly laid out by country of origin and brewery. Those less familiar with some of the more exotic beers will be happy to discover descriptions of the beers noted below each one. There's an ever-rotating list of draft beers that you will generally not find at the average Chicago bar. No Miller Lite drafts here. There's also a Lindeman's lambic tap if you dig the lambics. Lastly, there's also specialty drink list, though they are more female focused as those lists generally are. My lady friends have raved about the Persnickety Lemon. If all else fails, order yourself a bloody mary. One of the best in the cosmos. Love is the secret ingredient. Service is always excellent whether you sit at front in the bar area, or in the back at the grown up tables. The staff are very knowledgeable in both the food and drink selection. If you're confused by the beer list, don't be afraid to ask for a suggestion. I've found the food and especially drink prices to be very fair considering this is Chicago. If you're unable to spend $9 for a burger, I'd suggest visiting a dollar menu from any number of fast food establishments. Overall, this is one of my favorite new bars/restaurants. The food is unique and prepared with quality ingredients while the drink menu clearly had a lot of thought put into its creation. Give it a try and I'm sure you'll feel the same way I do.

Unfortunately, I don't really drink beer but the (small)menu proudly states burgers cooked by some awesome chef from NY, so I pounced on the Blackened Burger with Bleu Cheese(cooked Medium). PS - He refuses to switch buns for certain burgers. The waitress whispered that he reserves his Pretzel Roll for select combinations. Whatever. It's a dead cow patty. Get over yourself. My expectations of a Bleu Cheese burger are that it will have a copious unhealthy amount of bleue cheese smeared on top of it. Grilled onions are usually par for the course. All of the grease from the aforementioned ingredients should make it's way into the exposed underbelly of the bun to create a sinful yet almost nutritionally defend-able meal(it's got onions!) Fail. I don't know if the friendly waitress got my order wrong or what, but what I received was an average tasting burger with some kind of vaguely sour tasting sauce dribbled into it's nooks and crannies. The rather chaste bun sitting on top looked almost embarrassed to be there, like it had stumbled into an awkward and ill advised three way between the meat, uncooked onions and tomato. Â It was also cooked medium rare. I confirmed with the waitress that I received the correct burger and then requested some extra bleu cheese. Didn't help. I scraped off the blue cheese ""juice"" and squirted some ketchup on there but gave up after a half-hearted nibble. Even the burger was not very good. The fries however..Oh my god.

I thought the cheese curds were quite awful - why are they so fluffy and airy? Â They reminded me way too much of that Circus Peanut candy and that is never a good thing. My sandwich, the beer can chicken, came on a bun that was too soft and tasteless, almost like it had been underbaked. Â Plus there were all these other ingredients but none of them had any taste. Â All you got was yeasty bread and chicken. Â Shame. Â Then I ordered the truffle fries and those were way too oily.

We started out with the Cheese Curd Appetizer. The curds were fluffy and delicious. They rank right up there with some of the Curds that I have had in Wisconsin.  For my Entree, I tried the Ham and Cheese sandwich. The ham was lean and beautifully honey glazed. It came with Caramelized Onions which complimented the Sandwich well. The fries were awesome. I'm not really a big French Fry person, but the fries served by the Bad Apple were awesome. They were crispy and golden with very little grease.  This could turn out to be a regular hangout for C.R. and I. The food is awesome and the service was fast and courteous.

Drinks were served promptly and the beer selection is extensive. You could come here fifty times and still have something new to try. Now, the bad. We sat in the main dining area, which makes you feel like you are a vampire (this could be good depending on who you are). The curtains were drawn across all the windows, making the space feel closed in. The ceilings are covered with black draping with red lights peeking through. And, in the center of the room is an obnoxious chandelier with about 50 bulbs and blinding beams of light that were very irritating throughout dinner. Things got worse when dinner was served. Â For appetizers, we tried the fried cheese curds (with ranch) and goat cheese fondue. The cheese curds were decent, but I wasn't that impressed with the fondue. For my main entree, I selected the chef-inspired veggie burger. BLEH!!! Â It tasted bland and heavily spiced with sage (or something else I couldn't place). The bun was grocery store-like, making a bad sandwich worse. I could barely eat more than a few bites. Thankfully, the fries were good (although a number of them were burned). My husband order the Texan, which is a burger plus pulled pork and onion rings on toasted Texas Toast. He was also disappointed. But, with all that good beer we didn't want to give up after some disappointing food, so after dinner we moved to the bar area, where we were greeted by a snotty waitress and ear splitting music. The music was so loud that we couldn't talk to each other without shouting and I swear my ears are still ringing today. As a result, we quickly finished our drinks and headed out the door.",-0.6326,0.814,0.097,0.09,0.5458435708435708

You know what... you want a cheap burger, stick to the drive-through lanes and stop complaining. I haven't seen a decently cooked burger at a sit down joint/ trendy bar that was ever worth anything for less than $8 since the early 90's.

I came here with friends after work, and were looking to grab a bite to eat on that stretch of Lincoln. We saw The Bad Apple was newer (formerly Feed the Beast) and decided to try it. The inside is pretty swanky. It reminded me of nightspots found in James Bond films during the Roger Moore era.  Regardless of what period film this restaurant reminds me of, I want to say that the beer list is outstanding.  I wish their menu was. And service. Our waitress didn't come for at least 15 minutes. I went to use the men's room. Of course, she came while I was in the men's room, and took another 10 minutes for her to return to take my order. Granted, she was training a new server, but there was hardly anyone in there when I arrived. The appetizers looked good. Cheese curds, fries in gravy with cheese curds, mini burgers, etc. The rest of the menu seemed to be devoted to interestingly new types of hamburgers ala Kuma's (they also had a sandwich section including a pickle, mayo and onion sandwich, or a pb&j sandwich...) Â I saw a burger on an English muffin with white cheddar, sauteed mushrooms, and onions.  I thought it would be some cool type of English muffin that you find in those stupid mail-order specialty food catalogs your family might get around the holidays. Nope. It came on an English muffin you might get from the Jewel several thousand yards away. Like it was stated before by other reviewers, my tiny medium-done burger patty was more rare in certain spots.  It's very obvious The Bad Apple is trying to imitate Kuma's in a more intimate setting with softer music and no wait times. I'll give them props for having an attractive interior and an awesome bar area plus liquor list. It's definitely a bar to savor a drink with conversation in.

That may of been our first mistake. While the hostess was attentive to sitting people at tables, we didn't want to share meal with strangers at the ""community tables"". We opted to wait for the bar. We were able to get a seat for about twenty minutes- we found the wait for the bar a bit disorganized- people who had arrived after us were jumping into available seats that were closer to where they had been waiting. The menu told the rest of the story- amazing beer list! Dortmunder gold on tap? YES. The rest of the beers were also very painstakingly chosen. I had several, and they were all delicious. The food? Totally underwhelming. The menu was completely uninspiring. I was hoping for toppings that transcended the usual choices of blue cheese and sauteed mushrooms. I forged ahead and relied on the quality of the meat (rumored to be mixed by some fancy-ass butcher). I ordered it as rare as they could possibly serve it, and it came out super well-done. Not to be daunted, I sent it back, to get a second, super-greasy, medium-well burger. Oh well.  Soooo....

Â Once our food was delivered I noticed that the burger was cooked well done (not medium), the patty was significantly smaller than the bun, and the bleu cheese appeared to be a rare commodity. Â The fries were tasty but the portion was small and they were served only slightly warmer than room temp. Â  We finished our food, paid and left.

2009-08-29,3.0,"I met a few friends at The Bad Apple, reportedly when it was Feed the Beast it was always pretty empty. FtB obviously didn't get the formula right, but The Bad Apple did, at 7:30 on a Friday the place was packed, there was a 30 minute wait for a table and the bartenders were running themselves ragged!  I don't know what FtB used to look like, but The Bad Apple is cute. The bar area is a deep maroon with dark wood chairs and accents and little red ball lights hanging over the tables. The dining area is brighter, but has the same maroon walls. A few accent walls have trees painted on them with one single red apple - very cute.  We settled in at some chairs along the window with the gigantic beer list. I was impressed not only at selection, but how reasonable the prices were. Both of my beers were $4.25 and really good, I tried the Dark Horse Raspberry Ale and the Left Hand Ju Ju Ginger Ale.  It's hard to separate our food from the service. Our server was very inattentive and awkward. When we sat he was going on and on about the drink lists (they reportedly have a nice specialty drink list too) while we looked at him puzzled, it took him a while to figure out those full glasses of beer in front of us were ours and we were set with drinks.  When we ordered it also got awkward. My friend wanted her burger made with a veggie patty, our server stood and pondered the idea before saying it was no problem. When Picky McPickerson (me) asked if the pieces of olive in the tuna salad were large enough for me to pick out, I threw him for a loop; I ordered something else instead.  Our food took forever, we wondered if we should tell him to cancel it or if he had forgotten to submit it. When we asked why 3 burgers were taking an hour he just said the kitchen is doing their thing; no apology for the delay, nothing! We had to ask him to find out when that meant we'd eat. Aside from checking on us for drinks he seemed to be completely out of his element!  To eat I got the Strange Famous - homemade wild mushroom, seitan, chick pea and corn burger, goat cheese, caramelized onion and sage marmalade, and spinach leaves. I got the marmalade on the side unsure of how it would work with the burger, but it surprisingly was good and not very jelly-like. I felt like the goat cheese was either wrong for the burger or there was too much of it, it overpowered the burger. I ended up putting ketchup on it to cut some of the goat cheese flavor. My friends got the Mahalo (sub veggie patty) and the Hangover. They both liked their burgers, but my friend's veggie burger fell apart almost instantly. The Hangover was huge with a fried egg and bacon on it. The hand cut fries served with it were really good, but I would've liked them a little hotter.  There aren't an overwhelming number of veggie choices here, even most salads seem to have meat on them. It's definitely not impossible to eat here, just a little limiting.  Bottom line: 3.5 stars for great beer selection with great prices; good food; cute decor; sloooow service.

2009-08-23,3.0,"I live in Lincoln Square and love most things Lincoln-Square-y. So, when Feed the Beast closed, I was sour about it. To my delight, Bad Apple fell not far after.  Atmosphere--great dark red theme. The painted trees and the red globe lights are totally delightful. It falls short in the back room where nothing hangs on the walls and the lights aren't as dim. They forgot to do anything with the bathrooms in this rehab and therefore fall short of any expectation. Food--the menu is thoughtful and interesting and all dishes are reasonably priced around $8-12. I had the Lucky Duck--duck confit on grilled texas toast. It was a little bland and needs some work, which I think they can accomplish after a few more weeks of being open. My friend had the Mahalo burger w/ pineapple which was delicious.  Drinks--surprisingly extensive beer list organized by state. Includes international brands and stuff from Half Acre Brewery right across the street!",0.9794,0.81,0.17,0.02,0.44376026272578
2009-08-18,5.0,"I live down the street and just ate there for the first time. (on a Tuesday) I had a great experience. The list of draught beers is better than Crust and rivals Hop Leaf or Publican. It is better than Feed the Beast (the previous tenants of the space) but let's stop comparing to FTB. These are new owners with a new plan. Bad Apple is burgers and beer but they are very serious about both. The list of bottle beers, if you ever get that far, is amazing. They are pulling no stops on quality. There is Tripel Karmeliet on tap and Kwak in bottles, along with an impressive selection of domestic craft brews. I sat at the bar and got to see the selection of ""house wines"" along with their spirits - the entire bar is top shelf. The prices are perfectly reasonable, maybe even cheap for this kind of quality. I ordered a burger with arugula, tomato, and blue cheese - according to the menu it's named after their butcher. Again it was excellent. it's not a boatload of food, like you can get at the taps across the street in either direction, but ultimately it was the right amount and the quality was far better. The burger was cooked exactly how I wanted it. The bleu cheese was real not the crap that usually gets thrown on a burger. The fries were perfect. If you like Hop Leaf Â then you should definitely give Bad Apple a try. If you want to impress out-of-towners with the city experience or just want really great food and drink without going broke then do likewise.",0.9937,0.735,0.206,0.059,0.6017262965792378

Â The bun was dry and just stale and boring and well, big..HA! Â I just ate the burger minus the bun. Â The fries were VERY, VERY good. Â Please have some. Our bartender/server guy was great though, but a tad slow. Â I'm sure with explaining all the beers, the new place to, blah blah, etc to everyone, that he just was a bit overwhelmed.

2009-08-18,5.0,"I was legitimately sad when Feed The Beast closed. It had good food and a lot of potential and a lot of fun beers. But it was always understaffed and I was ALWAYS waiting for my food. Always. So the fact that the owners of The Bad Apple are committed to keeping things fresh, focused, and awesome is a very very good thing. Brendan S. and I went here for dinner the other week because a) we were hyped that it was finally open, b) they had Half Acre Daisy Cutter IPA on tap (read: it's brewed across the street and is literally the only IPA I like) and c) I'd read the menu in the window a few days prior and wanted to eat everything I read about. We sat at the bar and were greeted by Ronnie - one of the managers/owners - who told us about remodeling the place and revamping the menu to keep things as streamlined as possible - such as having one ingredient and using it for many things, which helps cut down on costs and helps keep things fresh. I grabbed a burger that was ""blackened"" and covered in blue cheese, and Brendan grabbed a veggie burger composed of chick peas, mushrooms, and corn, while covered with spinach, onions and goat cheese. He RAVED about the taste of the veggie burger, while commenting that its texture reminded him a little of mashed potatoes. And my burger was awesome and juicy to the point where the bottom of my bun was completely saturated (and DELICIOUS). Anyway, really good food, a seriously amazing beer list (LOTS of Belgians) and management that gives a damn. If only all bars were like this.",0.9813,0.815,0.142,0.044,0.5813293650793651

2009-08-17,5.0,"In two words: Fresh and Focused.  The Bad Apple strives for quality over quantity and they are succeeding in my opinion. Even though I am a big-time carnivore I felt tempted enough by the ingredients of their veggie-style burger to stray from my grilled meat roots. The patty was made from chickpeas, corn and mushrooms topped with spinach leaves, goat cheese and caramelized onions served on a fluffy bun. This concoction is titled the Strange Famous. The patty stayed together relatively well considering its veggie makeup. The goat cheese combined with the caramelized onions was a total party in my mouth. I learned later that because this burger has been so popular they had to pick up extra ingredients from Whole Foods earlier that day to make sure they could continue serving it fresh. Nice to know they don't keep a bunch of frozen stuff in the back. This was served with a side of hand-cut fries that were lightly seasoned--also delicious.  And how about the back room with the Ms. Pac-man, pinball and Foosball table? Definite score!",0.9709,0.816,0.156,0.028,0.4978835978835978

I think they will be as popular as the Hop Leaf, so go early. Even tho they haven't been open long, the staff was very friendly and seemed at ease. The owners have done a great job updating the space, and we appreciated the recession-proof pricing.

2009-08-17,3.0,"From the beer list alone, I was excited to try this place. And it mostly didn't disappoint. It's true the beer list is huge -- I think about 30 drafts and 50 bottles -- and all micro- or import brews. Some really interesting choices, too. Now if only they could get Ommegang beers on there... But I digress. As a bar, Bad Apple is great. We got there, got seated and had beers in our hands in 10 minutes. As a restaurant, Bad Apple has a loooooooong way to go. We were seated in the bar even though both rooms of the restaurant section were practically empty. Our burgers took forever to come. The waitress got one person's fries order wrong. And the other fries were ridiculously salty. I ordered the curry fries -- the fries that had curry on them were great; the others weren't. The mushroom burger that comes on an English muffin was great, except the English muffin needed to be toasted.  One person in our party did get to taste a beer before ordering. And when we did see our waitress, she was friendly. But we also witnessed the table next to us being served the wrong food. So they have some kinks to work out. I'll be back certainly.

2009-08-14,5.0,"My roommate and I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of The Bad Apple after Feed the Beast, formerly in the same restaurant space, closed down. She and I live just down the street, so we were really hoping this place would be good, considering it's withing walking (stumbling) distance from our apartment.  Before stepping into the joint last night, we reminded ourselves not to be overly excited otherwise it would skew our perceptions of the place. I am more than happy to report, however, that the staff and beer, food, and atmosphere exceeded our admittedly overzealous expectations.  Let's start with the staff. So, we sit down, and immediately, we are handed a beer menu by a very pleasant, waitress who somehow correctly pegged us as beer drinkers. We were blown away by the number of beers from which to choose, but quietly commented to each other that we wished there were descriptions to accompany the beer names. Not one second later, our waitress appears and hands us hot-off-the-press, new beer menus with, you guessed it--descriptions! At this point, I started to wonder if I should ask her to pick my lottery numbers. But, I digress. My roomie and I both ordered the lambic framboise, and were disappointed to learn it wasn't available (waitress said it wasn't tapped or something). At this point, the male bartender, Ronnie, offered some recommendations, and we ended up with a porter and a dandelion ale; both were excellent.  My roommate ordered the beer can chicken sandwich, and I ordered the Mahalo burger with the ham and pineapple. In short, the chicken sandwich was awesome. It was tender with a hint of citrus and just delicious. The burger was the star of the show, though--my roomie and both thought it was the best burger we had ever had. I'm not even kidding. I ordered the burger medium, and it was cooked to perfection. The pineapple was grilled and sweet. The ham was oh, so smoky! The bun was toasted. It was the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and smoky. The fries were excellent, too.  As we were waiting for our food, the bartender let us sample the fruit-infused vodkas in the large, transparent jars that adorn the bar. The raspberry and citrus vodkas were delicious; we're looking forward to going back and ordering martinis soon.  Atmosphere feels the same as it did when it was Feed the Beast, which is to say it has a neighborhood clientele and thus neighborhoody feel. The Bad Apple is somehow slightly less pretentious, though.  The back room in which we used to play Rock Band is now converted into a game room, complete with pinball and Packman and board games, which is just as fun. Check out the paint job in the bathroom back there, too. You kind of get the feeling that someone's looking at you. . .  Can't wait to return. Thanks to The Bad Apple for an awesome meal and experience! Here's to hoping for consistency. . .",0.9972,0.81,0.157,0.034,0.49689118071471

2009-08-13,2.0,"Just thought I'd balance this out a bit. Â I had a bad experience at the Bad Apple. Â I'm not sure exactly when it opened, but they definitely have some kinks to work out. I was apprehensive to go in the first place, since the logo is so terrible, but a friend said it was good. I'll get the positives out of the way up front: nice space/decor, great/unique menu (kind of wanted to order everything), good beer list and good fries (only good thing I consumed). My friend Jen and I sat down and a waitress brought menus immediately. Â Then, no one came back to get our drink orders. Â The waitress FINALLY came over (maybe 20 minutes later?) when I gave her ""the face"" and she was, like, ""has no one helped you yet?! Â I'm SOOOO sorry."" Â The bartender / manager-seeming dude was waiting on all the other tables in our area, so I don't think this was her fault, I think it was his. Anyway, we order beers and burgers. Â We both order our burgers Medium. It takes awhile to get our beers and the waitress comes over and says they'll be right up - something about the heads on the beer, maybe about the taps or something (I have bad hearing). When she brings the beers back, they are each 1/3 foam. Â The foam settles and we have only 2/3rds a beer each (and we ordered different beers - not the kind that would typically have a huge head or anything). Â Not sure if she was rushing them b/c we waited but I'd rather wait another 5 minutes and have a full beer, thanks. Â Oh, and mine wasn't as cold as I would have wanted it (it was a weiss type beer). We get our burgers and they are completely un-evenly cooked and WAY rare. Â The middle was, like, fresh out of the meat-grinder raw. Â But we were both starving, so we ate them. Â  My toppings were good (I ordered the Slow Burn) and the fries were really good. Â Had the burger been cooked properly, it would have been a good meal. Â Jen subbed a salad for her fries and liked it a lot (and she ordered a side of mayo for her burger which they forgot). So, okay. Â Blah, blah. Â Not a great experience. Â But here's the kicker: the bartender / managery guy comes over and asks how the food was (I think he might have heard me crack a joke). Â We tell him that the burgers weren't cooked well enough (we don't even mention the beers - we aren't very confrontational). Â He asks how we asked for it to be cooked. Â We tell him Medium. Â He's like ""oh, well, if it were up to our chef, he'd serve them cold because it's good meat."" Â And Jen says, ""Well, it was pretty much raw."" Â And he continues to defend the meat and the chef's stance. Like, I get that it's good meat. Â Okay. Â But if I order it Medium, I expect it Medium. Â It was rare and an un-evenly cooked Rare. Â The chef can't decide to cook it however he wants, there's a standard. Â They can suggest on the menu that you order it Rare, but not cook it however they want. We could have sent it back but we were starving and had waited so long already (plus, the edges were cooked - I didn't notice the middle until I had eaten a bunch of it). Â Oh, and the lighting is red- so it was hard to tell that the burger was red. Anyway, I doubt I'd go again.

I think we're going into week 2 of the Bad Apple being open so it should definitely be visited if you really want to know for yourself, but given that I didn't find too many kinks that you normally do that early. I had the steak frites burger and my wife had the veggie burger concoction (the something famous) and went nuts over it. She's a veggie burger snob and said this may be her favorite - very high praise. We LOVED the fries, very fresh and tasty. Our only food complaint was that both our buns were a little burned when toasted, but it didn't ruin it for us. BEER - thats why you come to this place. They have Belgians, Unibroue and an amazing variety of cool beers that I hadn't even heard of. Some are pretty pricey but the draft menu is really reasonable for craft beers.

Out of the group of 6, we each ordered a different burger and everyone loved their choices. I had the Pat LaFrieda (blue cheese and arugula) and it was delish. Hand cut fries were amazing. Best part - each burger is only about $7 or $8 and waaay tastier than any other options in the hood.  The game room is a definite bonus - old school Pac Man and Scattergories rounded out our night. My one complaint is the only light beer they have is PBR. Not that I don't love a good PBR, but a little variety would be good.
