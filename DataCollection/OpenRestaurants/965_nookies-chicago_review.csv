2017-08-20,2.0,"I struggle to understand why this place has the wait that it does.  Sure it has that old school diner feel, a rarity in the city.  And it is an Old Town icon at a time when the Benchmarks and Steak Bars begin to crowd out the long standing staples.  But once you get past those sentimental points, you realize that Nookies fails to deliver what any good restaurant must: good food.  Having lived in the neighborhood for several years, I've eaten here a lot.  And over time the food has ranged from mediocre to outright awful.  Most recently the eggs were way overcooked for the whole table; poached eggs should not have a hard yolk. The toast was even bad, barely toasted and kind of soggy.  Breakfast, which is Nookies' domain, is incredibly easy to make and yet they routinely struggle with even the basics. You can properly poach an egg at home without much effort--and you can certainly toast bread--and it won't set you back $20.",0.3376,0.829,0.095,0.076,0.47924933862433855

The Old Town one is the original. It seems like a house converted to a restaurant ( I could be wrong but the atmosphere is like that.) The outside seating is very relaxed an casual. There was nobody eating there that seemed to have an agenda. I sat at the counter and was comfortable. In the northern one I am aware of being alone.

2017-08-06,4.0,"Nookies is a good brunch option in the neighborhood, with larger portions, and quick service. We came as a group of 7 at about 10 am on Sunday and ordered a mix of sweet and savory items.  My wife and I ordered the southwest omelette and the berry brioche stuffed French toast. Both items were good but I would order the omelette with spices (jalapeño maybe) to give it a kick, though the avocado on top was great. It was stuffed with cheese, beans, and tomato. Also, the hash browns were quite plain so maybe some seasoning in addition to ketchup would help.  The French toast was good but not as moist as I was hoping, and the toast was thinner as opposed to a thicker style toast which I personally prefer. It included strawberry, blackberry, and strawberry. No maple syrup needed as it was drizzled with berry sauce and fruits.  Prices were a bit higher than what I expected given the casual diner vibe and layout (as I'm accustomed to River North), but the positive is that there are plenty of options on the menu.",0.982,0.824,0.162,0.014,0.47932900432900427

Needless to say we were quite upset.   Not only were they unwilling to accommodate us, they were rude and dismissive. They acted like I had made the whole thing up.

The food was VERY plentiful and very hot. However, the gravy on the potatoes sort of tasted like dog food, but the potatoes were good. The steamed veggies were good. The chicken was kind of dry and had not the best flavor. In all, it is comparable to any other standard diner food.

Thankfully the bus boy could tell we were agitated and felt bad so he came over to ask us for drink orders and fill waters. Minutes later, he could tell we were still searching for our waiter so he came over and asked if we had been helped yet. When we said no, you could tell he was embarrassed and searched for the server. The server comes over, as if he were agitated he was being asked to do his job, and says ""what will you have today?"" Perhaps an acceptance that you're busy and running slightly behind and an apology would help defuse. The remainder of the brunch, he's short, and overall unfriendly. As we walk out, he walks past us, makes eye contact and you would think this would be a good time to thank us for coming in. Ha, you knew that wasn't coming. Silence instead. Of course I mentioned it to the owner as we walked out. I told him, I understand places get busy and perhaps you're short staffed; however, this is NOT the type of service you would ever want to hold your own business accountable to.

Both days we weren't offered our first coffee refill until we were almost done eating; and weren't offered a second refill at all. The Mexican skillet with chorizo was very homogeneous and tasted like and had the consistency of processed factory food almost like baby food.  It all seemed squeezed out of a Kirkland bag and microwaved. Yuk. But we gave it a second shot the next day and ordered  Eggs Benedict - by far the worst we've ever had.  The Hollandaise sauce on the menu was replaced by a disgusting lemon sauce (on Eggs Benedict!).  Sweet/sour rather than savory sauce on poached eggs??  We had to bathe it in hot sauce to choke it down.  The eggs were not at all tasty, and a little soggy.  The Canadian bacon had barely touched a pan - seemed like it was dropped onto the English muffin straight out of a cold package.  The English muffin too was so lightly toasted it seemed dropped onto the plate from the package.  All of it looked and tasted like it was assembled from packages rather than home cooked.  No care at all was given to making this meal, and it was unpleasant to eat.  That's a disgrace in any event, but at an average ticket of $20 per person, it's also a crime.  Just plain gross.",-0.9038,0.854,0.058,0.088,0.4494331065759637

We had to hang out for 20 minutes or so for a table of two but no biggie as the hanger didn't quite hit in yet.  Once seated, I ordered their huevos con chorizo which consisted of scrambled eggs, Mexican chorizo sausage, potatoes, & chihuahua cheese and served with a side of rice, beans, and flour tortillas. I think the biggest disappointment was the chorizo which was pretty unrecognizable as chorizo to be honest. Sort of just tasted like deconstructed sausage and was pretty bland overall. Eggs were cooked well as were as the potatoes and I ended up constructing two mini breakfast burritos with the tortillas. But overall still kind of meh.  I think the biggest attraction for this place is the fact they are a diner that is BYOB. Just about every other table or so had a bottle of champagne popped and another table even brought a full handle of grey goose and an arsenal of mixers. Those guys knew what's up! Other than that the food wasn't very good in my opinion, and there were at least a dozen fruit flies buzzing around our table which kind of made me lose my appetite.

After a 5k in Lincoln Park, a friend offered to treat and I suggested walking over to Nookies. A little before 10 o'clock, we only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated at a table for 2. I was actually surprised to find the place is bigger than it looks and has 3 different rooms, able to accommodate groups of all sizes. I also noticed lots of kids and families, along with younger people enjoying (byoc) mimosas - a good crowd mix overall. So after settling in with our coffee (I mean, first thing's first!), we perused the myriad of menu options and decided to split 2 dishes: the combo crepes and the artichoke frittata with hash browns.

They offer a large menu with a wide variety of items, so anyone and everyone can come for a meal and be sure that they will find something that is to their liking. The coffee is good. Staff is generally friendly. The juice is actually fresh squeezed. The portions are huge (I usually get an extra meal or two thanks to the leftovers if I order an omelet). And, of course, they are BYOB, which is always a nice bonus.  So why only 3 stars? To be honest, I don't find Nookies to really be anything special. It always strikes me as a pretty standard diner with average food. I've had some okay meals, a few disappointing meals, but I've never had a really great meal here.

2015-12-23,2.0,"Last weekend I visited Nookies with a group of friends. We had a 12 o'clock reservation and our party of 15 arrived on time. When you make a reservation there's an expectation that your table will be ready when you arrive but we still ended up waiting nearly 45 minutes to be seated. That's unacceptable in my opinion. What's the point of even making a reservation if you're still going to have to wait anyway? We finally got seated and had to wait another 15 minutes or so for menus. We were seated at two different tables that were adjacent to each other. However we weren't served at the same rate of speed. One table had finished eating their food before the other table had even been served!! Luckily everyone was good natured about it and went with the flow. I ordered pancakes, bacon and eggs. There was a special for about  $9 but the server rang everything al a carte which ended up being more expensive. I was annoyed but I didn't complain. There were too many of us even bother with it.  The service was ok. Our waiter was efficient but he was like a robot. He wasn't personable at all. He took the orders, dropped off the food and that was it. He never came back to check on us or anything.  The food was ok. The pancakes were overcooked so they were dry and tough to cut. The eggs and bacon were edible but nothing special. Overall, I just wasn't impressed. Even still I'd be inclined to give the place another shot. The location is convenient and the environment is cozy enough.  Even though everyone in the group was unimpressed by the lackluster service we still tipped the waiter well over 20%. It is Christmas after all....",0.9499,0.815,0.12,0.066,0.528047619047619
2015-12-20,3.0,"My first food stop while visiting Chicago was to Nookies for a quick breakfast with friends. My boyfriend Brett and I had been up all night driving from Charlotte and I was ready for some delicious nom noms. The ambience was a down-home family style diner with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The greeters at the door were phenomenal while we had a short wait we were offered hot coffee and after sharing we had been on the road for 14+ hours the staff said they would ""keep the coffee flowing"". We appreciated the humor and the coffee. I had heard through friends the skillets were delicious but I was craving some vegetables so I opted for the smoked gouda (.... ahem need I say more???) tomato, mushroom and spinach egg sandwich with a side of fruit. Brett went with his gut and instantly chose ""the hangover"" skillet; potatoes smothered with chili, poached eggs and sour cream.  I wasn't overly excited about my breakfast sandwich (best part was the cheese) but the skillet was a hit!!  So why the ""3"" rating you may ask?  While the service at the beginning of our experience was spot on, the food filled our bellies and was overall cooked well, what put the bad taste in my mouth was our server.  Having spent 6+ years working in the restaurant business waiting tables and tending bar I generally give my servers a good bit of slack when I see they are ""in the weeds"" however our server wasn't too busy, and when he did spend time with us he was very short and abrupt in his conversation. After the meal was over and checks had been paid, the server returned to us the receipts and pens without saying anything to us, no ""thank you for coming"", ""I appreciate it"" etc...Although I do not penalize servers for their attitudes and always tip 20% + , service is one of the main reasons I return to a restaurant.",0.9436,0.858,0.101,0.041,0.5115999999999999

Food-wise, this place is great.  All the typical diner options which they do right.  I got the Dixie Benedict: poached eggs, ham, and biscuits covered in sausage gravy and served with has browns.  Great comfort food and hangover cure.  GF had a special: black bean fritters and said that was fantastic. Overall, it was a great brunch experience.  Our only issue was the price of the drinks.  When we first sat down, we both ordered a water and orange juice (large - 8 oz).  It wasn't until we got the bill that we saw the juice was $4.25 EACH.  Can't be too upset as the price is clearly marked on the menu, which we didn't look at.  Common sense would put the juice at a MAX of $2 per glass, so we ordered without looking.  For the $8.50 we paid for our non-alcoholic drinks, we could have just went to the Walgreens down the street and gotten 2 gallons of orange juice.  ""Fresh squeezed"" or not, that wasn't worth it.  We'll be coming back, but just getting water next time!",0.9933,0.833,0.167,0.0,0.49250610500610503

Very cute and has a nice patio area; we knew it was gonna be good because of the amount of people standing around outside waiting for tables. We figured we would be out there waiting for awhile- but it was only 10-15 minutes, just as the host had said.  We were seated inside. The place has such a great diner feel- but different because its a bit more classy. Our waitress was super friendly and kind, and took great care of us! Thanks to other Yelp reviews, we got the fresh squeezed orange juice... it was SO GOOD. We are from Florida and recently moved here to Chicago. THIS is the stuff Floridians live for. It was perfect. We also enjoyed watching the juicing machine. They were putting whole oranges in, peel and all, and juice came pouring out. Intriguing.  I ordered the Chili-Avocado fritatta with hash browns. It was phenomenal and such a huge portion, I barely finished half. I wasn't a huge fan on the hash- kinda tasteless and needed quite a bit off pepper. I didn't eat much of it. The fritatta though. Oh. My. Word. I wanna eat that for breakfast every morning. Just as the waitress described it- a bed of eggs with chili, all this awesome melted cheese, and avocado. Yum.  My husband had the Bistro burger. Bleu cheese and carmelized onions on a 1/4 lb beef patty. He really liked it, although it wasn't exactly cooked how he had asked. He asked for medium, and it came out almost well done. Not a huge deal, and he was starving and just wanted to eat, haha. Overall he said it was a pretty good burger.  One thing that my husband would like me to add is that he was so sad he didn't order the huge stuffed french toast stuff we saw come out of the kitchen soo many times.

The price was I believe 8.95 for that meal, which isn't bad but it was basic. We then ordered a thing of crepes and the flavors we got were apple cinnamon, strawberry and creamy cheese (or something like that) The strawberry and apple were very basic as well, it was a crepe with fruit in it essentially, no whip cream or any kind of drizzle but the creamy cheese was amazing, I would recommend that over the others! Aside from the food being basic, the place itself seemed worn down; the carpet was disgusting as well as the tile. When I walked into the bathroom, there were two stalls, one stall had poop alllllll over it, and it was disgusting. That took off sanitary points for me. Overall, I would not ever go here again and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone as well.

I would probably give it 3.5 stars if that was an option because it wasn't bad (I would go back) but it also wasn't anything exceptional either--it's just a standard brunch/American spot. My boyfriend and I split the tuna melt and an omelet. The tuna melt was pretty good (classic tuna on an english muffin with melted american cheese), but nothing that I couldn't make easily at home. The omelet was great: huge, veggie-stuffed and super cheesy, but again, nothing different than any other omelet I've had at a brunch place. With our orders, we also got a side of onion rings (yummy but greasy) and hash-browns (eh, only okay, I've had better). One particularly frustrating/bizarre thing about our meal was that the tuna melt comes with a side of chicken & rice soup, but we are vegetarian. We told the waiter that we can't eat meat and asked to sub it for a side salad or a different side instead, but the waiter told us: ""no, we can't do that because the soup is just complimentary.""

The entire meal was devoid of flavor top to bottom. Except for the English muffin, which was actually great. Also, freshly squeezed orange juice is a nice touch. Service was fine.

2014-10-26,1.0,"I'm perplexed by the high ratings Nookies gets.  I'm seriously disturbed, no really.  We came to Nookies based solely off of the four star rating.  We were wandering around the city and did not know any places nearby, so I did what Yelpers do - I did a search for nearby restaurants and chose one that was close and had high ratings.  Nookies looks great from the exterior, but once you walk in you see it is quite old school, which is not a bad thing. The front looks like a more traditional American diner from a time long gone, with the U shaped seating around a main ""bar"" and stools for seating.  There is also regular tables stretching into a back room. We were seated at a table.   I think one of the main rules of thumb for any customer at any establishment (at least for me) is to judge the place by the cleanliness of the bathroom... Dirty bathroom.... most likely dirty kitchen - maybe poor food handling on top of it.  If staff can't keep the bathroom decent why would they have the discipline to maintain a quality kitchen?  The bathroom at Nookies was a mess. There was garbage on the floors, the soap taken out of the dispenser and placed on the sink, water running for no apparent reason, and unappealing toilets. The handle was broken and would not flush.  Does this make you want to then go into their dining room and eat their food? Nookies serves up breakfast and lunch. Hubs ordered the Belgian waffle, I ordered the Frisco grilled chicken sandwich with cottage fries.  It was not served the way it was described on the menu.  It is supposed to be served with Romaine, it was served with iceburg. Not only that, but it was served with the large white ""stalk"" of the iceburg, not the actual lettuce.  It was plain, boring, and I could have made a far superior sandwich at home.  The Belgian waffle was so basic, nothing special at all. If I can make it better at home I feel I've wasted my money going to a restaurant for it. Next up.... the diners next to us waved our shared waiter over, and whispered something in his ear. Naturally I was intrigued. I paid attention to their table and watched as the waiter casually walked over to a wall the diner was pointing to, and proceeded to smash a roach.  He then stated ""oh those ones aren't as bad as the others I've seen.""   Appetite lost completely.",-0.8992,0.837,0.068,0.095,0.48540565817161563

The regular menu is good, nothing too special, but it's a good amount of food for a fairly cheap price. Perfect for families, especially with kids. Their seasonal specials menu is definitely worth checking out too. The fall menu has pumpkin flapjacks that are AMAZING! They always have at lest 3 season options between pancakes, waffles, and french toast and they always sound super tasty. However, the spring menu had a trout skillet which may have been one of the worst meals I've ever had (in all fairness, the service is so good that I'm sure they would have brought me something different had I asked, but I didn't.) I'd be pretty cautious to order anything with fish from Nookies again after that. But my favorite thing on the menu is definitely Ernesto's chilaquiles. Combining Mexican and breakfast is just a beautiful thing! All in all, Nookies is such a good breakfast place that even a horrible meal didn't scare me away, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",0.9964,0.663,0.273,0.064,0.579526682467859

I went recently for what I think will be my last time. I'm not a fan of any of their NON breakfast foods. I have had a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches, and nothing begged for a second chance. Their breakfast is good but again, nothing spectacular. The omelettes are always a little dry and the potatoes are bland. And why can you only get sweet potato fries in the after noon? The last time I went my waiter seemed to be in a training program for Ed Dbevics. He was rude but clearly in an attempt to be funny...he just failed.

The burger came together in a wonderful way, with the sweet onions, but salty, rich blue cheese. I was in heaven! The only thing I'd say is that the burger seemed a tad dry, but since everything was so great it wasn't super noticeable. My friend said the Acapulco was amazing as well. Burgers came with the veggie soup of the day which was nothing to rave about but ok. There were chunks of veggies in a simple broth. Fries were great though! I've never seen fries cut potatoes chip style like that so they were a nice, crispy surprise.  At a little less than $10, we were pleased.

The place is BYOB, which is one of reasons why we chose it, and we called ahead to ask if they had bloody mary mixers or if we should bring our own. They assured that they had everything we needed but the liquor, and that the wait was about 20 minutes, so we headed right over.  When we got there the wait was actually 40 min. That's understandable as it was a Sunday morning on a long weekend, but after 40 min was up we waited for another 40 min. Then, when we ordered the virgin bloody marys that we had called to ask about, the waitress brought us horseradish that had expired in 2010. We asked for a different bottle, she disappeared for almost 15 min, and finally came back to say they didn't have any other bottles of horseradish. So apparently we've been the only people to need horseradish in the past two years. Also, the food and drinks all came out separately,  like 5-10 minutes apart, which is always awkward.

Everything on the menu is well executed, but for a real treat check out the seasonal menu.  I typically will get the summer vegi fritta or the steak and egg tostada (when in season).  My girlfriend goes nuts over the crab cakes benedict. The thing that really shines is their service.  The food comes out fast and you always someone there when you need them.  For the fish out there that go through a ton of water, you will love that they are constantly replacing your pitcher with a full one regardless of how much is still in it.  In summary:  Not going to give it 5 stars because I do have breakfast places that I like slightly better, but this is without a doubt one of the best places in Chicago for weekend breakfast food.",0.9868,0.832,0.155,0.013,0.4274691358024691

I strolled over to nookies after going to the farmers market on a Saturday around 11, the wait was only five minutes And I was able to squeeze in a mexicution in the meantime. We were seated and right away got some fresh squeezed orange juice, a little pricey but well worth it. We followed the advice of other yelp reviewers(thanks a bunch I will remember if you are ever on the chopping block) and ordered off their specials menu. The trio (which is a smaller portion of their 3 sweet breakfast items) was awesome. hotcakes with mango and coconut, stuffed french toast brioche with mascarpone and a mound of fresh berries, and pancakes with apples, almonds, and spiced butter. at 12 bucks they were all full of flavor, creative, and made with obviously fresh and quality ingredients. The portion was a good size and I did not finish and had to leave with a doggy bag. My partner ordered a vegetable fritata with hashbrowns which was also solid. Eggs were fluffy, veggies were yummy, and hash was solid. Also a very large size. I wish I could have had a bloody mary or a mimosa with my breakfast but they are BYOB.

Just a bunch of stuff thrown into a pile for you to eat. The next and sad to say last time I went there I took my girlfriend with me. It was pretty busy but I had 2 eggs toast and sausage and my girlfriend did the eggs benedict. My food was alright, definitely nothing I wouldn't be able to make for half the price. My girlfriend however is why we probably will never go back. It was obvious from the first look as the waiter was bringing it from across the room that they hollandaise sauce was straight out of a can. Had a terrible off yellow color that looked more like bile then hollandaise. When we asked our waiter if this is made fresh he kind of rolled his eyes and laughed. That just leads me to believe everything here is either frozen, canned or just plan cheap. I prefer simple things like hollandaise and mashed potatoes to be made fresh and not instant. When we notified the manager that we were unpleased that they couldn't take the extra 5-10 mins to make it right, his answer was something along the lines as you can't win them all.",0.9624,0.829,0.127,0.044,0.4359750566893424

Another friend got the southwestern omelette which turned out to be a bad decision.  The avocado dollop on top of the omelette was too creamy and tasted strange and the omelette itself had way too much cheese.  It was literally half pepperjack cheese.

Nookies buttermilk pancakes are of the upper echelon of pancakery, although I wasn't crazy about paying a buck extra for maple syrup. You know what that says to me? It says that you serve the steerage syrup to us poor folk, the ones who need that buck to pay for fifteen minutes of parking.  Nookies is an interesting place, with a strange sliding door-like aperture that people nearly crash into when visiting for the first time, despite the arrow on the door pointing left to the real door. You go through the real door and hit the wind-up toys, which include a sushi wind-up. Not sure how that works, but let's not get off track.  Breakfast food here is good, and for the second time in this review I will herald my love for pancakes. They're good here with a side of sausage and a great cup of coffee.

Once we got back the seats, we discovered that the food MORE than made up for the odd layout.  I had the good old, traditional pancakes, with 100% maple syrup (up charge but worth it) and bacon.  She had peach and raspberry pancakes with almonds and a peach-marmalade butter.  Both dishes were out of this world!!  Our waiter was excellent and extremely attentive.   The only service issue we had was keeping our coffee hot - the waiter really wasn't the one handling the coffee...the guy who was didn't make it back to our room very often so we had to keep asking for a warm-up.

2010-07-20,5.0,"I like to think of myself as a breakfast food snob. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. Unfortunatley I am rarely ever impressed by a place that serves me food I can easily make at home and usually better.  That being said I was completely and utterly blown away by this place!!!!!!!  The dish I ordered was spectacular and my friends all devoured their dishes as well.  Let me give you a run down of why Nookie's is so great.... First I am no more mature at 25 than I was at 12 and walking in the door I giggled like a little girl when I saw the sign....haha Nookies.  POINT 1 NOOKIES  Second we were sat, even with a group of 6, in a timely fashion. ON A SATURDAY MORNING, WITH AN ART FESTIVAL ON THE BLOCK!  POINT 2 NOOKIES  Third the menu had a decent selection of breakfast/brunch/lunch offerings. But what really excited me was their Mexican breakfast dishes. Any breakfast place should include this specialty on their menus. Our neighbors to the south know how to do breakfast.   I ordered a skillet of eggs, refried beans, chorizo, authentic crumbly Chihuahua cheese, rice, and fresh salsa.  The dish was absolutely a revelation. The chorizo was perfect. Spicy but not over powering or to fatty, the rice and beans were cooked perfectly, the cheese meleted, and the eggs and salsa perfectly matched. I ate and ate to the point of being uncomfortable because the food was so good I didn't want to insult it by not finishing. In my opinion this dish alone gives the place 5 stars regardless of other facts i.e. service/atmosphere.  POINT 3&4 NOOKIES.....the extra point is deserved because I'm afraid I may never again find such a perfect breakfast dish. Fourth the service was good. We had a pleasant waitress who was on point with coffee refills (a huge pet peeve of mine is not having a full cup through my entire meal).  POINT 5 NOOKIES I live in the suburbs and was brought here by my girlfriends best friend during a trip into the city for a crosstown game on the north side.  I initially was worried when I was told my gf bff was picking breakfast because she's a healthy eater and I am the antithesis of healthy.  But as you read above I was not let down. Everyone was satisfied with their meals, maybe not as much as me but nonetheless no one complained.  I will try my best to make this a stop for breakfast every time I venture outside of my safe little suburban world.

I ran into Nookies and immediately not one, but two people greeted me. It was full of local Boystown residents. Kostas (Sp?) was at the register and was super fast taking my order and his fingers flashed across the touch screen register. I told him I was running across the street and would be back in 5 minutes. He confidently told me"" it will"" be ready when I got back. I was quick and back in 4 minutes. When I returned, dry cleaning in hand, he said ""one second"" and ran back to the Kitchen. Another employee within 30 seconds asked me if I was being helped. Kostas gave me my food and I shook his hand when I asked him his name and told him that he was very helpful. I must say, this was great service. Not typical of pick up where you have to sit and wait watching others eating and wanting to go go go. I will be grabbing some more on the run breakfast goodies here and also leaving a bigger tip next time I go since I had missed my chance earlier to tip him, Thanks Kostas and the staff at Nookies for helping those of us who are on a busy schedule.

Here's what happened... I walked in after a dentist appointment (yuck) for a salad and a nice read all to myself. Well, this didn't exactly happen. For one, it took FIVE MINUTES to wait to be seated...and then, I wasn't seated. See, after waiting that whole time, NO ONE even LOOKED at me or bothered to say, ""Someone will be right with you,"" or ""Can I help you?"" It was NOT crowded. At all. So, I figured, maybe I'm expected to seat myself? Doesn't seem like it, cuz I know how the other Nookie's works (see: someone at the counter ready to seat you immediately), but I think, ""Whatever, who knows,"" and seat myself.  It became apparent that I was NOT supposed to do this, as every waiter and bus boy walked right past me paying me no attention / not knowing how I got there. So FINALLY, after 10 minutes, some waitress says something to the manager guy at the counter, clearly pointing at me. He shook his head and said something. She turns to me and says, ""Excuse me, do you need a menu?"" I said I did.  With that, she turns around and storms off to the front, shaking her head and throwing her hands up in the air in annoyance. At me. As if I wouldn't see this?  Then she hands me the menu and, in a fake-nice voice, but loud enough for everyone to hear, says, ""Next time, just make sure you check in at the counter, okay?"" I responded, ""Yeah, well no one helped me for five minutes so..."" And she WALKED AWAY as if I hadn't said anything.  I should've left. But i was starving and already there. So I stayed and ordered my salad. The rude waitress decided she should be nice to me from then on out, clearly remembering that she needed a decent tip at the end of all this. (Which, she did not receive nor deserve.)  I must say, I've never felt like such a nuisance to a waiter or waitress like this until the Old Town Nookie's.

So we awkwardly stood around, unintentionally hovering over the tables nearby as there was no real area to wait. It definitely was an older crowd at that time. Everyone was in their 50's or 60's it seemed, reading their morning paper and sipping their morning coffee.

Finally, everyone arrives and they seat us.  I start with an orange juice, which happened to be freshly squeezed. Delicious. Then I order the cheese stuffed crepes, with one cinnamon/apple one and a side of bacon. Pure dessert. The cheese crepes were very tasty and super sweet.

Otherwise I've had the sandwiches.  Pretty sweet if you like sandwiches with shit piled on top of 'em.  For example, when I went last week, I got a tuna melt.  That's right, tuna on english muffins with tomato slices and some nuclear orange cheese melted on the top.  It was pretty good--the tuna's real mayonnaisey if you're into that.  I usually prefer a drier tuna.  Because I'm weird.  The fucked up thing is, though, that I could barely eat any of the GD sandwich because I had a bowl of split pea soup that preceded it. NOW IS THE TIME WHEN WE DISCUSS THE MAJESTY OF THE SOUP. Seriously, this split pea soup was thick, creamylicious, hammy, oh my oh my oh tasty good.  On its surface floated big as hell sourdough croutons, nary a sogged by the viscosity of their home waters.  The croutons were buttery, a bit garlicky, basically fucking incredible.  And the soup, oh, heavens, the soup.  I tell you, I have never had it taken out of me so bad from a bowl of soup before.  I'm a huge fan of soup, and it usually sates me, but, like, Campbell's doesn't cut it unless you also--in addition--hook up some cheese and crackers with that bitch.  Now, the type of cheese and the type of cracker are HIGHLY context specific with respect to the particular soup, but their copresence is near mandatory, in my soup consumption book.  But I'll be damned if this split pea didn't get a full fucking pass with crusty croutons alone.  And then I was too full to eat my sandwich.

I've been here once for the typical Saturday early afternoon rush.  The wait wasn't too bad.  I tried a seasonal pumpkin pancake and it was really good.  Good service.

2009-03-10,2.0,"I am a devout Nookies fan--a fan of the food, I should say.  This is a review of the service.  I've been going here enough to feel that I can give an accurate take. I LOOOOOVE Nookies food.  I go here a LOT because the food is great and the prices are not bad.  It's fresh, dependable, unpretentious.   Now, I despise the customer service.  I go here a LOT, but the employees treat me as if they've never seen me before; in fact, they even treat me coldly and rudely.  This pretty much goes for everyone who works here. Now, there are several ""hosts"" who work here.  The two I see the most, Douchebag #1 and Douchebag #2, are the rudest.  Douchebag #1 is the one who seems to be working the most when I show up.  He's oldish and very bald.  This guy, when he's not talking about his ""gym"" or some sort of personal training adventure, does the minimum.  A begrudging ""hi,"" escort to a table, and exit.  Handles the payment at the end, ever so brusquely, and delivers a short ""bye"" when I leave.  In between all of that minimum work, he's sitting down, usually blabbing to someone, likely regulars, about personal training and working out or some crap like that.  ALLLLLLL the time.  Without fail.  Once, when he had to perform work, he delivered an order that was messed up, and he freaked out when I told him so.  He very unwillingly took my order back. Douchebag #2 is a tall, hairy one.  The kind of guy who played football in high school and wasn't very good; he was just stocky and tall, so people thought he was good.  This guy also does the minimum.  He's pretty much like Douchebag #1, but he's there less often, so hence, a little less annoying.   And there are two other guys that are just neutral, meh.   The waiters:  the girl with the dark hair, always in a disheveled pony tail on the side, scares me a bit.  She gets the job done, but she's incredibly bitchy.  I'm always happy when I don't have her because she makes me nervous. The tall girl who has a high pitched voice is nice-ish but fake.  Sometimes messes up the order and will often forget about you as she chats it up with Douchebag #1 and occasionally, Douchebag #2. The blonde guy also sometimes messes up an order, and forgets about you often.  He's eh when it comes to niceness.         None of them actually acknowledge me--they just take my order and give the food (sometimes incorrectly) with a barely passable decent demeanor.  It makes me uncomfortable to even come to this place, especially when it's not jam-packed because it's even more obvious that they could give a crap about this regular.  I think I may stop coming here, though I love the food so, and start going strictly to Nookies Tree on Halsted--the waiter, Deda, is MUCH warmer and friendlier, even bubbly.  The other waiters...eh.  Nookies, I suppose, in general, could use an overhaul when it comes to their waitstaff and ""hosts.""   The food is sooo good and affordable, but the customer service just blows it for them--2 stars.",-0.9958,0.736,0.088,0.176,0.5072874902874903

2008-07-13,4.0,"What probably originated as a neighborhood tradition has grown into somewhat of a breakfast phenomenon. This Nookies, which obviously has two other locations, is on the quiet part of Wells that it's fairly uncommon to drive down--and if you were looking for the place during any other time besides brunch, it's possible you might miss it. Standing outside for brunch on a Sunday at 10:45am meant one thing: a 20-25 minute wait. Now, this really isn't bad compared to say, Overeasy Cafe up in Ravenswood (and hell, it's worth it) but it can feel significantly long if you're waiting for a cure-to-your-hangover breakfast as we were. Once we were seated, though, things started to roll. Our server was friendly, and although a little to begin service, she checked back up on us a couple of times and made small talk.  The food? Nothing special or unexpected--but Nookies isn't the kind of place where you're going to find ancho-butter with your toast. It's predictable, good, hearty, short-order cooking, and you pretty much know whatever you order is going to be solid. I ordered the chilaquiles which were warm, tasty, and the portion was far more than enough. My boyfriend ordered the eggs, hash, and toast (a LOT of food for $4.45) and couldn't finish it all. So, say you're a little low on cash, don't mind waiting to put something in that belly of yours, and would like to partake in a friendly neighborhood's offerings?

Thus, this review is dedicated to her... I ordered my standard Denver omelette with tomato slices and coffee. It is a bright, shiny day when my coffee is perfect, and that it was. The right blenda splenda, cream and hot diner coffee sends me into a sort of dream-like state that can only be replicated by the perfect Diet Coke  formula. (fully carbonated, fountain...if you must know). Regardless, the refills were plentiful and well timed... My omelette was quite perfect, actually. Not too big, not too small...large chunks of green pepper (I hate mushy little shredded chunks of veggies, ick), and the cheddar cheese did not resemble Kraft nor nacho cheese topping from 7-11. IN an omelette, this is quite important...especially when one is a cheap cheese connoisseur like myself. SO many times I am presented with plastic cheese, and I just cannot stoop to that level of consumption. Don't get me wrong, I'll eat in certain situations (baseball games, jail, etc), but when dining with intelligent women, I need real cheese. Obviously, they get an A in this department... CASH only.

I am not one to eat leftovers, in fact I despise them. However, I could not leave my unfinished crepes to be tossed in the garbage. The prices are a little high, but you will realize that every dime you spend is going towards a fresh ingredient. The service is fast and for the most part friendly, but can be a little cranky sometimes. Who can blame them though?

2007-03-15,3.0,"Every time my friends want to go to Nookies I throw some kind of protest. Not cause I am a brat, but because I don't really see the hype in this restaurant.  I am not a breakfast person, so maybe I am missing out on something amazing, but a good restaurant has to make sure quality covers all bases.   The first time I went was the mid-morning after a shackfest.  I was told it was a ""cute little restaurant"" and immediately pictured a small quiet place to eat and have conversation.  Instead, I found myself walking into a cram-packed little room with tables that were so close I could practically taste test their meals (though they were eating breakfast food so I wouldn't have anyway).  My BBQ chicken sandwich was ok.  Just ok.  A little sloppy with sauce, but nothing worth noting.  I was disappointed again when the check came and the waitress said ""Oh sorry, we only accept cash.""  ARGH!  I would say 3 stars for that. But LUCKY for me 4 of my friends wanted to go another night.  I put up my protest, but could not get out of it.  Heck, why not give it a second chance and see if it would be better on a random weeknight.  I was in a sour mood, so I was pretty critical of everything.  While there were less people in the restaurant, they only had one server working.  I had a major chili craving, so I ordered the chili bowl.  Other minor things happened to throw off the whole meal, and worst of all for me, my chili was pretty cold.  Another disappointing experience. Maybe the third time is the charm?  Who knows.  I'll likely put up a fight before that happens though.  Sorry, Nookies. edit: 3/18/07",0.9782,0.726,0.172,0.102,0.6007452574525745
