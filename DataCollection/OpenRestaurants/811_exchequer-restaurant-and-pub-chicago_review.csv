2017-09-02,3.0,"We were out for dinner in Chicago, checking out a local pizza and rib place, pronounced ""Ex Checker"". I wasn't super hungry, so went for the 8"" thin crust.  I ordered the Italian sausage but it arrived with what tasted like, salami.  The pizza was pretty decent.  A crispy cracker crust with what tasted like some provolone in the cheese mix.  The sauce kinda reminded me of a marinara.  I paired it with a coke... the draft beer selection looked amazing (i.e Revolution, Lagunitas, Bells)... wasn't in the mood for a beer...but next time I will be. This place is known for their Chicago Style pizza, so next time I'll bring my appetite and might give that a try.  Someone in our party ordered a burger with bacon and the works.  It looked huge and awesome.  The bun was soft and griddled or toasted.  Actually, might get the burger next time!  It looked perfect. The server was really nice, and attentive.  This place has been around since 1969 with 3 generations running it.  It's been some other restaurants since the roaring 20's.  If only the walls could talk. I'll definitely come back here for dinner, it's a really neat place to check out.",0.9934,0.789,0.202,0.009,0.518560606060606

We were visiting Chicago for the first time as tourists and staying in a hotel nearby so we gave it a try because of the good Yelp reviews.   We had pizza which didn't have the sauce on top and I don't know why. It would seem that all Chicago style pizza has the sauce on top. But it was delicious. We shared a small pizza and I'm pretty sure there was no less than two pounds of cheese on top and we ate it all. The pizza takes a while. As thick as it is that wasn't a surprise.  The other people around us were eating other things from the menu and it all looked good. From what I hear, Chicago style pizza is mostly consumed by the tourists so maybe they were locals.  The service was great and our server was personable and attentive.  In conclusion, I think the Exchequer is a worthy stop while in Chicago.

2017-07-03,1.0,"Took my family of 6 there tonight after a long day in downtown Chicago. Came highly rated, but I can honestly say it was the most overrated restaurant I have eaten at in a long time! To be fair, the food was decent, not horrible or great. However, the service was inferior to every other experience we had on our trip (I cannot remember the last time I only tipped 15% as I did tonight). But overall, it seemed TONIGHTS MANAGER set the tone for a far less than family-friendly experience. The moment we walked in, he gave my family a once over, whispered to the hostess, then walked away. She then looked at us and said ""our kitchen is backed up, so I don't know when I can seat you. Do you still want to wait?"" We politely said yes, then she said ""ok, well it will probably be about 15 min."" I replied ""No problem"". 20 min later she told us there wasn't a table for 6 open but she could put us in the bar area. We said ""ok that's fine"". While we waited, another party of 6 young adults walked in and were taken to a table 3-5 minutes later. Perhaps they had a reservation, but I didn't hear any mention of it. Eventually we were led to two high tops shoved against a wall in the bar- probably 2"" by 6"" table. We would have had more room at the bar. The hostess saw that we barely fit and that I was doing my best to keep my hungry family engaged with a good experience, so she came to me and said a round top in the restaurant had opened up. From there, the less-than-stellar experience just continued. The manager seemed like he is in the wrong business as he gave no time to even speak to other customers, even when he dropped off silverware, AND treated my family as if we didn't even exist! The server gave mediocre service, and we had to ask her 2 of the 3 times we wanted refills. Food took 32 minutes from ordering to being served, and when it did come, it was decent at best! If you have a family with you, avoid this place!!!!! So many other great restaurants within walking distance!!!!! Having almost a decade of experience in the food service industry, I would suggest avoiding this place. It seems the best thing this restaurant has going for it is its history. If you want a far better experience in the downtown/millennial park area, my advice would be to hit Emerald Loop Bar and Grill, Wildberry, or Elephant and Castle!!!!!",0.9916,0.799,0.143,0.058,0.5217916666666668

Service was a tad slow due to the sheer amount of people in the restaurant, but our server was very nice.  We ordered a small classic deep dish pizza which had mushrooms, peppers, sausages, and onions. We were told that a small was perfect for 2 people. 30 minutes later, our pizza came out and a slice was lifted from the pan and placed on each of our plates.  My first impression was that there is a lot of cheese. I normally love cheese but that was almost too much cheese. Other than that, the pizza was perfect. The sauce had great flavor and the sausages as well. I ate 2 slices and I was stuffed. So was my mom after 2 slices even though she had just run a marathon.

I also ordered a filet medium and it was as well-done as I've ever had a steak with a big cut in the side of the meat, like the checked to see how done it was?  The steak was oddly sitting on top of a piece of Texas toast with the crust removed and it came with, in addition to a nice side salad and potato, a couple very hard onion rings (were there onions inside those rings?  If there were, they had dried up). I think the lesson I learned is this: don't get the steak unless you want it well done.  Get a salad, burger, or even the meatloaf, which looked amazing as a server brought some to another table.   Service was fine.  I asked for something extra with my meal that didn't arrive, but our drinks stayed filled and she was friendly enough.  I've been here before and things were fine so I was a little disappointed the steak was so poorly cooked and executed.",0.9274,0.859,0.111,0.03,0.6219202898550724

I had a ceasar salad which probably had a little too much cheese and dressing on it.  Also split a burger that honestly just had 0 flavor.  It tasted like they had just put meat on the grill, not even seasoned with salt and pepper.

2015-01-16,5.0,"I've been told by friends to cheq out Exchequer (zing!) and finally got the chance to this past weekend. Me and my girlfriend opted to go here on a blustery Saturday afternoon for lunch and to my surprise they were pretty steady, not packed but definitely doing good business! We were promptly greeted by one of the managers (Jake, I believe) and he sat us in a booth. Jake did a great job of gauging our familiarity with the restaurant and provided some nice suggestions for both food and drink.  Due to the weather we both needed to be warmed up so we ordered a couple of their winter cocktails, I had the Irish Coffee and my girlfriend opted for their speciality spiked Hot Chocolate and both were delicious! For lunch I opted for their special that day, the Buffalo Burger. Being a fanatic of buff chickens I was excited to taste this burger. As advertised it was a generous 10oz burger patty cooked to a perfect medium pink with gooey bleu cheese crumbles on top! This was definitely one of the best ""speciality"" burgers I have ever had! Definitely go for the pretzel bun! I opted for the waffle fries and found them with a nice snap crispness with the right tenderness on the inside and a special dipping sauce. I washed this down with one of their self-titled beers that was the perfect compliment after the pre-lunch Irish Coffee got me toasty inside. My girlfriend opted for the Old Hickory Burger with their homemade BBQ sauce and bacon and the only sound that escaped her mouth for the next 10 minutes was variations of ""mmMMmm"" and ""mmHmmHmm!"". They even put the sauce on the side for he so that we could dip our fries. I noticed that this BBQ sauce was definitely unique from one such as Sweet Baby Rays in a variety of ways of which most noticeably was a lighter shade of maroon. This sauce was sweet and savory with a hint of smokiness that made me ache for a full-rack of ribs (which I will be definitely be getting next time!) The 10oz of burger definitely got the best of my girlfriend as she was not able to finish the whole thing (but no worries, I certainly did later that night!) We were smart enough to preemptively order one of the Award Winning ""#1Deep-Dish Pizza"" (the Deluxe style, classic with sausage, mushroom, peppers and onions) at the begging of our visit to take home with us and enjoy the next day. This was great foresight because as any Deep Dish fan knows, they take about 30-40min to prepare. This pizza was a perfect compliment for Sunday football the next day at home. Just be sure to ask for it ""half-baked (cooked)"" so that it can be completed in your oven at home! All of the staff was courteous and attentive but never loomed too close as with some over-eager places.

I can't recall the specific name of the pizza I had but it was an Italian beef and giardinara (which I love) and was very good.  The other one we had was a buffalo chicken which I found pretty dry.  Passable selection of local beers too (think Five Rabbits was what I tried).  Appetizers were fried and uninspired.

2014-11-07,2.0,"So I'm told this place has history and is the best chicago deep dish you can find. Fine, bar raised and challenge accepted.... You get discounted parking at the adams and wabash garage with a validated ticket so that was a plus ($12 for parking vs $40 it would have cost) and the server was kind and attentive. Unlike service noted in prior reviews, our service was 4 star yelp quality and actually very good. Must be hit or miss on who you get. We ordered the goat cheese and marinara to start and a deluxe pizza. This is where it goes down hill.  The goat cheese really wasn't melted in the marinara and extra garlic bread was $4 extra. It was tasty but it needed to sit in the oven a bit longer to get the melted cheese in marinara experience. Flavor was good but thumbs down for execution since it's not hard to really make this dish.  The pizza is a 2 star at best. Best chicago deep dish this is not, but it might appeal to some tastes. Here are our impressions: 1. Semolina is a coloring agent in the dough that gives it the golden color you see at Lou Malnatis, Ginos East, Giordanos, etc. Exchequer doesn't use it or not enough and it is more of a doughy white crust.  2. Oil is not used on the pan or was not enough. The other places listed above oil the pan which gives the crust a crisp almost lightly fried texture. Lou Malnatis has more and Giordanos has a bit less, but it is a distinct taste. Exchequer does not do this and contributes to the doughy texture. If you look at the bottom of pan the pizza is actually elevated from the pan with a grate with holes in it. This is why the crust tastes like it does. If I knew they did this I wouldn't have gone or at least lowered my expectations on a deep dish pizza by about half.  3. Too much cheese which was a bit rubbery and too little sauce. I ate left overs the next day just to see if my sentiments were correct and they are. Deconstructing the pizza there is really not much sauce at all.  4. This isn't a sauce on top pizza which is fine 5. Veggies in the deluxe tasted fresh which was good Take the review with a grain of salt but it is my most honest review from an avid deep dish pizza lover.

We each ordered a burger and were both unimpressed.  I had a traditional cheeseburger on a pretzel roll.  The patty, pepperjack cheese, and the pretzel roll had no flavor, all I could taste was the fried onions.  My girlfriend ordered the Al Copone burger which was similar but with marinara.  She had to ask for a side of marinara because there was hardly any on the burger and it had very little flavor.  One thing to note was that the burgers were perfect cylinders.  I'm not sure if this because the chef is great at making cylinders, or they are pre-packaged patties.  Given the lack of flavor, I would guess the latter, but I can't say that with certainty.  The waffle fries were the best part of both our meals, only because they were on par with my expectations.

2014-07-31,1.0,"Backstory I visited the city with my family this past Sunday and it was the first time in the city for some of my family members.We all wanted some great Chicago style deep dish pizza and there was a place near where we parked called Exchequer Pub. When I  Iooked it up on Yelp it had decent enough reviews. We waited for 35 minutes to actually be sat, although most of their second dining room was empty and one half they were not even using.  The Food The pizza was mediocre to say the least. It was not what any of us expected from an authentic Chicago Style pizza place. Us being from Metro Detroit we have a couple deep dish places locally Pizzapapalis (Detroit) and Pizza House (Ann Arbor) that were much better. The dough was hard and had no flavor whatsoever, it was not at all what we expected. It almost seemed like it was a toast and not a dough because dough is gooey, springy, and bounces back usually. I ordered pineapple and bacon in my deep dish and i literally had one large chunk of pineapple in every slice, thats it!! For $16.25 I was definitely expecting them to be more generous with the toppings.  The ""Service"" I put service in quotation because I would not call our experience service by any measure.  Our ""waitress"" Katerina displayed some of the most unsettling and irreparable customer service that I have ever seen. I honestly thought at one point that we were being 'Punkd' or we were on some type of reality show. From the very beginning of our interaction she was despicable. She was short, dismissive, and condescending throughout our visit to this establishment. During our first order my uncle finished his order, Katerina asked ""is that it?!"" Mind you there were 9 of us at the table. I let that go because I thought okay maybe she made a mistake thought we were only ordering 1 pizza for 9 people... Next order she says it again, at this point I notice that we were not going up to her speed, which is why she was rushing us to order. I have worked in customer service and hospitality for many of years, so I do understand that people have rough days but the way that Katerina continued to display her disgust and disinterest was completely off putting.  When she brought the plates out and was plating the food she actually slammed the plates on the table. We actually only ordered pizza so really this was not something that was difficult or complicated, but yet every time we interacted with her she it seemed as if we were inconveniencing her. My aunt ordered ginger ale and it was brought out without ice, yes I get that people make mistakes but I don't know too many people that drink soda without ice. When Katerina was prompted about bringing a new soda the first time she says ""Is there anything else"" no response, no apology, or anything. The second time when she was questioned she says, ""I dont know, I mean I guess that is what happened."" Still no apology or offer to amend the concern. I was appalled and embarrassed. Appalled at the level of service she was giving and embarrassed at the fact that this was my families first impression of what Chicago has to offer.  The fact that the waitress was combative, argumentative, and prejudicial in her treatment of us was something that will stay with us all. ""The solution"" The manager was apologetic about the discomfort and the service that she provided and he stated that ""it would be handled and taken care of.""  Oh and he offered us some free dessert. It was explained to him that it took multiple times of us asking for management before she would even get him. It was also explained that she rushed us to pay our bill before she would get him as well. I'm not sure how he normally handles things but I definitely was not satisfied with how it was handled in our case. It was not about the money, we were on vacation and expected be dining out a lot. It was the principle that they made it seem as though we made a fuss because of the payment and to me that is unsettling and not even worth the time.

That's on top of this being my general go-to place in the Loop when I want a nice-ish dinner and to watch a game.  The pizza is great--both the thin crust (my preference) and the chicago style (my family's preference). I'm not sure what kind of cheese that they use, but it's great. When I'm there on my own I either order a small pizza and take about a quarter of it home, or I order the cajun chicken alfredo which is AMAZING and the perfect blend of spicy chicken and creamy alfredo sauce. The service is consistently pretty good, there are enough TVs that the important games are always on, and it's just generally a good atmosphere. It ranges from quiet enough to bring your work and get it done on the quieter days, to definitely feels like a packed bar on the weekend. 5/30 update: I came here to just drink and watch the Rangers/Canadians game. Turns out that this was a great group of regulars, reasonable drink prices, and great service.

It is by far the best thing this place has to offer, in my opinion, at least.   Forget the chain places...the pizza here is off the hook! Both the thin and pan pizza!  Plan on waiting for your pizza though as it does take some time, or you can order ahead and they'll have it ready for you when you get there.   The noon rush hour tends to get crowded so again, plan ahead and go early (or later) I'm also a fan of their taco salad - it comes in an edible taco bowl, lettuce, and all the fixings you'd find in a taco salad, and with chicken breast (though I believe you can order a variation of this)  I've had other things as well like the hummus plate appetizer, chili mac, burgers, chicken sandwiches, dessert, etc .  you name it!  Again, no complaints...definitely worth going to if you're at a loss with places in the area to sit down and eat at.",0.9105,0.889,0.083,0.028,0.42537037037037034

This restaurant has out-done every expectation and previous experience I've had with deep dish - dense, overpowering, overly salty, essentially rubbery cheese on a dry, thick, white flour crust. Instead, the taste here was refined and well-balanced, complete with a perfectly crisp crust with a thickness ratio fitting of the cheesy portion in the center. We ordered the medium sized deep dish and it was enough to satisfy 3 people (2 girls and a guy). The toppings that we chose were Italian sausage (not Texas-sized/chunky), mushroom, and hot giardinera (which is very mildly spicy). Toppings is probably not the right term because these ingredients were actually hidden with the cheese.  The restaurant is rather spacious and atmosphere, comfortable. There is a lot of historical decor -  news clippings and the such. Also, don't let the unimaginative/stale website turn you off from the quality of the food.

However, I once ordered mozzarella sticks when I was craving something greasy and they were absolutely disgusting. I only ate one and a half they were so bad, and I was starving that day. The cheese inside the sticks had NO flavor whatsoever- it was like eating melted paper, only paper has more flavor. The fried bread that makes up the outside of the stick was not salty at all and wasn't seasoned with anything. They pretty much just tasted like nothing, with a hint of awful bread and cheese. There are definitely better places to get lunch in the loop, but if you want cheap and semi-tasty food, Exchequer won't let you down.",0.9172,0.723,0.171,0.105,0.581400966183575

The blue cheese dressing was several grades better than either of us would have expected with huge chunks of blue cheese on top of a more standard blue cheese dressing. The fish was good though I found the breading a tad disappointing. (I would have preferred a crispier beer batter type.) We each tried one of their special hot drinks for our dessert.

I don't even know her name (she didn't grace us with that pleasure). She got to our table fairly quick which is great, however the first thing she said was if we're ready to order drinks, no introduction at all. I told her I haven't looked at the menu much yet, as soon as I looked back up she was gone. This shocked me because usually at restaurants there's a hi my name is such and such I'll be serving you today, then you ask if we would like drinks and appetizers. If we are undecided, then a server usually says okay, I'll give you all a few minutes, etc. This lady seemed to be rushing my table which made me very uncomfortable.  I ordered the salmon and ended up eating most of it at home. I asked simple question about the types of soups and salads they offer with the meals and asked about specific ingredients in the salad. These questions seemed to bother her. Word of advice: people are allergic to certain ingredients in various dishes nowadays, there should be no attitude when I politely ask to omit onions, or ask about your salad dressings. The menu is not one page, and as my first time there I would've liked to enjoyed exploring the menu to make a comfortable decision my order.

I had Lamb Chops, 18 oz Burger, Fish and Chips, Some other assortment of fries, The sampler appetizer, and pizza, and yeah... literal gluttony. Conclusion: Exchequer was extremely fun, and a really really good experience. The pitchers were cheap, and well priced. As long as the food was reasonable and very filling.

2011-01-24,1.0,"Let me start by saying that I am not the type to typically have a bad experience at a restaurant and leave a bad review. But this was one of those experiences that makes you want to call the manager, the BB and the local newspaper. I went here for lunch with a friend. We ordered drinks, the waitress carded us and asked for second forms of ID which we gladly supplied. We both have out of state licenses and as a bartender I completely understand. However, then she literally looked us in the eyes, smiled like she was humoring us and said ""Oh okay, sure."" I was totally confused. Obviously neither of us had fake IDs but she acted as if we were trying to pull a fast one. Mildly insulting, but nothing like the rest of the night. We tried to place our food order, listing off the topppings we wanted on our pizza. The waitress MADE A FACE and said ""Oooh are you sure you want that? That sounds like a lot."" What. Are you serious. Yes, that is what we want. I'm pretty sure we discussed it and never asked for your input. She finally ""allowed"" us to order what we wanted. The waitress then went and sat down at a booth across the restaurant and started chatting with a customer/boyfriend (?). At this point we cheers our drinks and take a sip, which my friend immediately puckered her face to. The bartender had obviously went a little heavy on the sour mix in her long island, the drink was so tart it was undrinkable. We try to catch the waitresses eye or wait for her to walk by,  but she never looked our way or left the man she was talking to.  Eventually our appetizer came up and she asked how everything was. At this point my friend politely said that her drink was too tart and she didn't care for it. The waitress came back with an ""Oh, why don't you go flirt with the bartender and see if he'll make you another drink."" I was so appalled I literally laughed. After a second it was clear that she wasn't joking. WTF. My friend replied that she didn't feel comfortable doing that and the waitress seriously tried to convince her to go up to the bar and ""flaunt her assets"" to get a new drink. After a very awkward exchange she finally said ""Oh, so do you want me to get you a new one or something?"" YES. THAT IS YOUR JOB. I work in the service industry and I give people a lot of slack but this was plain rude, not to mention dumb. Finally she brought back a vodka tonic and slammed it down on the table. Then she went back over to the man she was talking to and completely ignored us for a good 30-45 minutes. Our empty drinks and water were ignored until she brought us our pizza and got us refills. The pizza was pretty good, typical Chicago style pizza. The rest of the meal went well, until our check came. There was a random Stoli drink on the tab, which neither of us had been drinking. I had Tanqueray and my friend was drinking well vodka. Those were both on the check as well. I politely told the waitress that she must have accidently rang in a drink on our tab because neither of us had drank a Stoli. She said ""Oh yeah, that's just what I decided to charge you for the long island."" At this point I was so over this lady. I told her that the drink was AWFUL, that's why it was sent back and NOTHING was drank from it except two sips, when each of us tried it.  She argued with me and refused to take the Stoli off the tab. Eventually she told me I could go up to the bartender, who was the manager's son, and ask him if he would take it off. I finally said, this is absolutely ridiculous, we'll pay for it. Whatever. She got all huffy and said I should understand considering that I am in the service industry as well.  I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. I understand that you are not supposed to treat your customers like dirt and force them to pay for items they didn't eat/drink.

Well the ribs at Exchequer did not disappoint. The ribs were fall off the bone. And although the BBQ sauce was tasty, I have had better ribs before at Smokey Joes in Aruba.  Still they were much better than Carsons. Now for the wings. They were dry wings, not buffalo like I am used to with a side of blue cheese.  These slightly larger than usual wings came with a side dish of the same BBQ sauce as the ribs. Come to think of it, it's probably better then mixing with blue cheese, but by the end of my meal, I was BBQ sauced out. If you are a big BBQ sauce fan, then you will love them. I give them a 4.  I was going to take one half star away because of one of the wait staff. Ok I was wearing a Jets jersey but I wasn't looking for a fight.

Spicy meant a couple of sliced jalapenos and pepper jack cheese. I can handle much spicier, but the burger itself had a great flavor. On the side they served a low-fat potato salad that was decent (esp for low-fat).

2010-03-20,4.0,"Ahhh yes...Exchequer...a loop bar...It's been a couple of months, but seeing the title pop up, I had to wax nostalgic. ;) Exchequer is located over in the east loop, by jeweler's row.  A good size place, it's not too hard to find.  There's plenty of hotels around, so for people visiting, it's a welcomed bar to sneak into.  If you're a local living downtown, this is one of the few late night options.  Luckily, the place gets it done.  Nothing fancy, but not a dive. The small bar up front is my preference for a seat, but there's a large two room dining area for 2 to many many people.  It's great for larger groups, especially with that second room that is rentable.  However, I enjoy the upfront bar where food is served and it's easier to walk up and get a refill. It's here where you can really enjoy Exchequer with their collection of regulars and those who have stumbled in.  There's plenty of people watching and overhearing to get you and those with you to smile.  From businessmen to students, there's something about the slightly out of date bar that gets people going.  Thankfully, to keep you there, the prices are decent and then there's the food. With a menu mostly taken up with BBQ and bar food, they do a great job.  Food can be ordered up front and in the back, and it's usually out in good time.  There's their large thin crust pizza that surprised me with fresh toppings, and it really is a good size for 2.  Being partial to burgers, their bacon cheeseburger is big and tasty.  I've also had a BBQ styled burger and that too was filled with taste.  The menu also has ribs and steaks, which I cant comment on other than the ribs loooooook good.  And if they use the same BBQ for those that they do for the burger, those will be a definite next time. Although many pass it up, this is a decent place for downtown.  The staff enjoy the clientele and put in a good effort to make those ordering happy.  There's not much I'd want them to ever change as the only cons to Exchequer are not important.  It is what it is and they do a good job at that.   As usual, as I review a place that I haven't been to in a little while I start to miss it and know I'll be back soon.  Check it out.",0.9978,0.808,0.181,0.011,0.5055322128851542

Mega cheese, which I'm a sucker for, and our server was really nice.  Apparently he was filling in for someone whose mother passed away. Told you he was nice.

The beer selection doesn't include any of the craft brews that are showing up all over the outlying neighborhoods, but does represents some of the best widely known beers in the world- Boddington, Guiness, Carlsberg, Sam Adams.  Somewhat mysterious is the ""Exchequer Amber"" tap- the staff didn't even know what this was, other than it is sometimes Budweiser but sometimes another beer.

He didn't speak, he drawled.  He was altogether lacking in the ""friendliness,"" ""charisma,"" or ""personality"" departments.  Anyway, my husband ordered a sandwich of some sort and I ordered a pizza.  He let me know that my pizza would take about 30 minutes and asked if that was okay.  I checked my watch-- 6:30-- and said that was fine, figuring even if it took 40 minutes, I'd still have a comfortable 20 to 25 minutes to eat.  So we sat and waited for our food... 7:00, 7:05, 7:10.  Around 7:15, my husband tried to flag him down to inquire about the whereabouts (and when-abouts) of our food.  We swore he saw us wave him over but he totally and completely ignored us.  He disappeared and was nowhere to be seen.  By 7:25 and no food and no server, we were getting a little frantic.  We were debating leaving $5 on the table for my husband's beer and trying to find fast food elsewhere, especially since Mr. Casual Server was MIA.  This whole time, we were watching tables seated up to 30 minutes AFTER us get their food, finish their food, pay and leave.  Right around 7:30, our server came over, acknowledged the HOUR-LONG wait for our food and said he'd just checked with the kitchen and they'd messed up.  He said he'd try to cut us a deal and was making the kitchen hurry on our long-overdue food.  We were not pleased but were polite.  We were out of options, there was no time to go elsewhere.  We got our food just after 7:35.  I don't truly know how it tasted because I literally shoveled my food into my mouth.  I think it was fine; I don't think even if I had savored it that it was exceptional.  I burned my tongue so bad on that damn pizza; I had multiple welts in my mouth for days.  I apologize to anyone who was there that night  who may have watched us eat because I am sure we looked like disgusting pigs.  The server apologized to us (but in his super casual way, he didn't seem the most sincere) and offered to hold onto the rest of our food if we wanted to pick it up after the show.  That was somewhat nice of him, but no thanks.  He said he was able to get us the ""hotel deal"" on our meal-- a whopping 10% off.  Mind you, our bill was probably somewhere in the $25 to $30 range, so this saved us like a whole $3. NOt even enough to cover my hubby's beer.  I realize that it was likely the manager's fault & not our server's that 10% off was all we got out of this, but it did not placate us very much.  We paid our bill (and left  a tip, of course) and hightailed it out of there with burned tongues and beating hearts, because it was now 7:50.  Luckily we made our show in time, but the whole situation was stressful, the service was lackluster, and we felt generally disrespected as customers.  We will not ever return.",-0.9595,0.797,0.089,0.113,0.6287440014765597

Now, we all expected something that resembled a mojito or even the description in the menu to arrive. Instead, she got a greenish drink in a margarita glass with bits of chopped up, browning mint. We both agreed it was incredibly bitter. Not a big deal. She explained to our server that it wasn't what she expected and asked if she could have something else. Our server became mildly combative and quizzed her on what she thought a mojito was. The server got another server to explain to us all that they used a mix and blended the mint in a blender. That's fine, but it should say so on the menu. ""Fresh mint"" led us all to believe the mint would not be brown.  Our server brought her a new drink. I was willing to leave extra on the tip since I thought maybe she was just having a rough night. That was, until she brought the second drink and began quizzing my girlfriend again on what we thought a mojito should be.  I'd be willing to give it a second go.

I don't recommend the mix drinks as my friend's Key Lime martini looked pretty gross, and according to her, it was.

Exchequer allows you to design your own pizza, so there are many toppings. You can even go half 'n' half.

Then this week-end I went to the Printers Row Book Fair with my parents and afterwards we were seeking a lunch option that would suit my meat-and-potatoes-craving father. I remembered that the Exchequer wasn't too far away, so we wandered over.  The food ended up being good; the service, not. Our waiter was a young flake who couldn't seem to remember anything without being reminded several times and would disappear for long intervals (he also took a long time to make his initial appearance; we had to ask another server who would be helping us and she went and unearthed him from somewhere). Well-meaning but not focused enough.  The food endeavored to make up for this, though. I had ribs; my previous Chicago downtown ribs experience came from Millers, just down the block, and I liked these better -- they didn't have that charred outside, so they didn't taste burnt, and the sauce was fairly thin (good for dipping and finger-licking) and tangy. I tried the Greek potatoes as a side (since I wasn't in a french fry mood) but they weren't all that great (if they'd been warmer it would have helped). My parents each had a burger and were happy with their choices and the hefty portions. For dessert we had a delicious peanut butter-Snickers pie concoction that no one had a problem polishing off.  In addition to burgers and ribs, they have a range of pizzas and sandwiches to pick from. The ambiance is rather old-school: dark; newspaper clippings and memorobilia on the walls, with the bar first thing when you walk in the door and the restaurant in the back.

It's in the south loop, so it's within walking distance to a lot of cool places.  I usually bring friends to Exchequer when we're hitting up Millennium Park or the Art Institute.  If you can, use public transpo so you don't end up paying $15 for parking.",0.9829,0.829,0.162,0.009,0.44305555555555554
2007-04-23,3.0,"I tried the Exchequer last night based on pretty strong reviews from Yelp.  Here's are my brief observations. 1) The pizza (deep dish with veggies) was pretty good.  The crust was excellent.  Could have more tomato sauce, but there was a very liberal amount of cheese so maybe it just seemed 'out of balance.'  I would rank it as better than Giordano's, comparable to Gino's east, not quite as good as Lou Malnati's or Art of Pizza.  Also had a Caesar salad, which I thought was very good.  Would definitely try burgers or other items. 2) The pub itself is pretty cool.  Lots of Chicago sports-related newspaper clippings; has sort of a neighborhood watering hole feel, but also has a pretty large dining room in the back.  Very suitable for families.  Reminds me of the types of places I would go with my grandparents as a child -- broad Italian-skewed American menu, blue-collar sort of joint.   3) The service was spotty.  It was busy and the girl handling the bar tables seemed swamped.  She was sweet but a more than a little inefficient.  It would be frustrating if you were in a rush.  (Obviously, deep dish takes time to cook but she neglected to put it in immediately.  However, I should emphasize that she was very nice and eventually took care of everything requested.) Given the lack of options in the Loop area, my dislike for Giordano's, etc. I would check this place out again for either drinks or dinner.  Very centrally located.  And I thought the price was also incredibly reasonable for the Loop.  (Don't be put off by the appearance from the street -- it's actually a pretty clean and well-kept restaurant, not a dingy pub.)",0.9919,0.775,0.18,0.046,0.5951258503401361
2007-04-07,4.0,"My boyfriend and I came here on a whim. We were going to go to Miller's down the street, but it was too pricey. Exchequer has good prices, big servings, a casual atmosphere, and nice waiters. Also, it was tasty. I'm sure that the desserts would have been as good as the entrees, but there just was not enough room in our stomachs to handle it. Spaghetti and meatballs: a little bland, but good meatballs. Saturday Mixed Grill (steak, chicken, lamb chops): lamb chops the best by far out of the three. Steak was a little tough, chicken was cooked right but nothing special. Good mashed potatoes, not completely soft, but just enough chunks. Minestrone: reminded my boyfriend of Campbell's Canned Ravioli but for him, this was a great thing. Garlic bread: YUUUUUUMMMMMM. Other details: lots of TVs with sports stuff if that's your thing, and smoking/non smoking sections. Overall, Exchequer is definitely a place to check out, even for food other than their pizza.",0.985,0.774,0.188,0.039,0.5756519274376417

2006-10-24,3.0,"I started off disappointed and ended up impressed. A friend and I went here for dinner tonight, and unimpressed by the general menu -- run of the mill and then some more of the same -- we decided to splurge on the onion tower and an eight-inch deep-dish pizza. The onion tower was a hoot. Basically, it's just a vertical metal rod adorned with onion rings, along with two dipping sauces. Overly phallic in its presentation, it begs the question, ""Did no one think this was a bad idea?"" But they are tasty, those onion rings. I preferred the barbecue sauce-like dip. And the pizza? Having not lived in Chicago for quite some time, it was good to return to the deep dish. We got a pie with mushrooms and green pepper, and it was quite good. Roughly five slices, so it's somewhat awkward to split between two people, but with the onion tower, we couldn't finish our meal in any event. Not sure what the rest of the menu is like, but the pizza is passable. Not much else to recommend the Exchequer for otherwise.",0.8853,0.854,0.1,0.046,0.5664682539682541

Some nice surprises: the french onion soup and the hummus appetizer. And the desserts! The bar is small, so it gets crowded and extremely smoky. If that's not your thing, I recommend sitting in the back room. It's usually quieter and smoke free.",0.973,0.712,0.259,0.029,0.5277777777777778

I also had the garlic cheese bread for an appetizer, which included some of the best marinara sauce I've yet tasted from a restaurant. The atmosphere is that an old-style bar and grill, and you can tell that Exchequer has been around for a while.

We stayed at the Hilton (wonderful view) and were trying to come up with something interesting to do other than go to the Art Institute museum or Shedd's Aquarium (personal fav's to do in Chi-town). So we thought we'd be creative and do a walking tour of the best chicago-style pizza joints. We went to all the ""original"" chicago style places (we walked miles and miles and miles). We discovered this apparently little-known place by accident (it was near the hotel and we were walking by one lunch time...). It turns out that the Exchequer won our VERY BEST OF CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA award. A fun, inviting, unassuming atmosphere, friendly staff, and THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD. The crust is deep, yet somehow light and crispy--kind of bowl-shaped. That way they can pile in the toppings--or more like layer them in. It is thick and full of flavor, yet not greasy. A great combo and a unique and creative spin on Chicago Style that gets four thumbs up from me and my wife.",0.9899,0.77,0.2,0.029,0.5518181818181819
