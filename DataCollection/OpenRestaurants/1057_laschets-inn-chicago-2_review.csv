2017-08-30,5.0,We had an amazing time at Laschet's and we're so happy that Erika from Rare Dirndl ( yelp.com/biz/rare-dirndl… ) sent us there after our visit in her shop. We always sit a the bar in drinking establishments and the bartender was amazing to us. She served us some great bier in authentic German glasses. She was even a good sport when we tried to buy them off of them for $50 bucks a pop and then some-those glasses are priceless gems guys!! While we didn't leave with German glasses we did leave with full tummies! All the food is authentic German food and that means a lot of meat and potatoes as well as hefty portions. We shared a meal and were more than stuffed after finishing. The potato pancakes were great but the Spatzle was AMAZING! (Highly suggest getting spatzle!) the meat was so tender and flavorful and you could tell everything was made with love!  If you haven't tried Laschet's yet you definitely should. Grab some great German bier and bring your appetite. If we had more time to explore Chicago we definitely would have made Laschet's a repeat adventure.

Delicious dark rye bread. Choice of 2 house-made soups of the day or salad with warm bacon vinaigrette. Menu is large: daily specials, something for everyone -- even vegetarians (e.g. mushroom goulash with spaetzel & red cabbage). Save room for dessert: choice of house-made apple strudel or apple crisp, also Lutz' German chocolate cake. Complimentary after-dinner shot of schnapps or brandy.

2016-12-18,3.0,"Great authentic neighborhood mom and pop style restaurant with a bar in front. Food was delicious all around (we ordered rouladen,  potato pancakes, and thuringer sausage dinner plates) and very plentiful. Service was not so good, bathroom ok (not a horror show but not spotless either) which is the only reason I am not giving it 4 or 5 stars. We made reservations because it was not only a Saturday night but a World Series Cubs game night on top of it, and not far from Wrigleyville on top of that. So we knew it might get crowded as the evening wore on. Reservation was for 5:30. Arrived to meet my our 3rd party and were waved into the back left to try and find him. Awkward. He was seated at the very farthest table next to the back wall, off to the side. Our waiter took FOREVER to come back there and take drink and app order.  Service: waiter has either been there forever, or just for a few days. Can't tell which. He was a forgetful older guy who seemed annoyed all around and totally forgot our pretzel app. I had seen it on the menu ahead of time and was looking forward to it. I reminded him not once but twice about it, Finally he threw it down (literally plopped on the table) after our entrees arrived and after I asked a 3rd time for it from the runner who was a woman who did not fully understand English (though charming, she was obviously from somewhere in eastern Europe - def not Germany however) and had to get an interpreter for our waiter. When he finally came with our appetizer mid-meal it was without the stated cheese/mustard sauce. I asked for it and he then came back with a squeeze bottle of mustard and likewise slammed it down on the table. On the plus side, he apologized over an over and seemed angry with himself. OK onto the food: delicious and extremely plentiful. Very filling and do not come here if you seek a light meal LOL. My rouladen was tender and super flavorful. I ordered 3 but 2 are far more than enough for a normal adult, or even a gluttonous adult. The spaetzel is fantastic. Yes you may ask how a pasta-ish item could be delicious but it is! Absolutely perfect texture and flavor even without gravy and with gravy is heavenly. Better than Oma's! My hubbie's and brothers thuringers and potato pancakes were also nonverbal-level good.  The side of red cabbage also warrants a separate mention. Sooo good. Just the right amount of vinegary and salty with a hint of buttery yet all very light as a vegetal side. Perfect. All in all the food was fantastic even though they were busy and full. Our waiter did not do a good job but seemed like a nice guy. I almost wonder if he is a friend or relative of the owner or manager down on his luck and working his way back up. Kinda seemed like that. I would go back again just to try the food, but if the service was as bad I would not keep returning.",0.9969,0.775,0.165,0.06,0.5371918767507002

2016-09-20,5.0,"Lace me up in one of those traditional dirndls and put an Oktoberfest beer in my hand...then I will be the German lady fit to dine at the wonderfully authentic Laschet's Inn.  It was so very charming on the inside that I felt as if I had just turned off of the Autobahn and waltzed right into a regular ole neighborhood hang-out.  I sure felt like I was welcomed with open arms - I wonder if they could tell that I was German?  As if my Hans Gruber-like wit and height didn't give it away?   Anywhooo...I have been dying to come here for over a year since my first attempt hadn't panned out the way I wanted to, to no fault of their own.  When walking up to the restaurant I could smell all of those super delicious goulashes and chicken paprikashes.  In fact, they smelled so good that I had to order that in addition to a boatload of other things to satisfy the German monster roaring in my stomach.  The special of the night (Tuesday) was Chicken Paprikash which of course came with spaetzle (the tastiest spaetzle ever) and red cabbage.  On the other nights of the week they offer different specials, all of which are probably to-die-for, but if you're able I would recommend coming here on a Tuesday night for this particular dish.  A bonus is that it's quiet during this night so you can stuff your face without feeling watched by judgmental on-lookers.   In addition to the Chicken Paprikash - a truly spectacular dish, done exactly the way it should be done (round of applause!) - we ordered the Hackenpeter (aka steak tartar), Bavarian pretzel, goulash soup, a small order of Rouladen, two Oktoberfest beers and the densest German chocolate cake from Lutz's bakery.  The meal was perfect from beginning to end, but then again when is German food not the most perfect meal for any occasion?  Just as a sidenote: we came on a warm summer night, but this food would be best enjoyed during a winter night (preferably within a cabin).  In other words, I will be coming back to Laschet's Inn during the winter time to test my theory, especially since it does feel like a cozy little cabin in there.   Back to the food - I've never had steak tartar before this, but after trying it here I don't think I'd ever want to order it from elsewhere.  I simply don't think that another place could make it as well as they did here.  The steak tartar was very pastey (as I am told it should be) and SWEET!  But wowza, when served on the rye bread and with capers it was stupendous.  I'm a steak tartar convert thanks to Laschet's Inn.  This was coupled with our order of the Bavarian Pretzel which was served with the best spreadable beer cheese!!!  I was already getting full at this pont (yikes) but persevered to indulge in the goulash soup (yum!) and both the Rouladen and Chicken Paprikash.  I don't need to obsess more over the Chicken Paprikash, but I must give a shout-out to the Rouladen which was interesting, but good.  Both of the entrees came with a choice of certain soups, but for an upcharge you can get the goulash soup.  Definitely choose that option.  We rounded out the food with the chocolate German cake which was so filling that I ate about 3 bites and saved the rest for later.   I actually saved about 3/4 of my meal for later...us Germans like our comfort food and we like our leftovers.   Aside from the food we each got a pint of their freshly tapped Ayinger Oktoberfest beer.  Boy, it was delicious as ever.  Oh, and I almost forgot!  After our meal we were offered complimentary Schnapp's and we were able to choose from three different ones.  Go with the apple cider liqeur!  I had asked the waiter, Greg, where to get these delicious little buggers and he said they could be found at Gene's Sausage Shop in Lincoln Square.   Speaking of our waiter, Greg - he was a very nice gentleman who was both attentive, but not overbearing.  I'm telling you - the Germans do it right.  I would go back for the food without a doubt, but I'd go back for the service as well.  Not only was the service great, but as I eluded to earlier, the atmosphere of Laschet's Inn is one that is very comfortable and homey.   A tid bit that our waiter told us: Nick Floyd of Three Floyds frequents this place often...so for all of you cult followers, if he is a frequent flyer of this place then you know it must be good.  Truly, though, this place is one of my new favorite restaurants in the city.",0.9994,0.808,0.187,0.006,0.5312771933142304

2016-06-23,5.0,"My favorite German place in Chicagoland. Ever since college, when the guys would go out for wurst on Friday before boozing, I've had a thing for German food. Despite living in one of the largest German populations outside Germany, I couldn't seem to find a place that really gets me excited. There is a number of decent places, but I couldn'd find a clear winner. Until yesterday, when I tried Laschett's, which happens to be in my back yard.  The food was excellent, the portions large, and the service was good. The environment is a bit old and dry in the back dining rooms but the bar up front is cozy. Our waitress was so nice and attentive. It's really hard to find people like this. She was so enthusiastic about their food and even noted that she would come by on her day off to eat there. That's awesome.  Regarding food, we had the hot sausage appetizer, the goulasch with barley mushroom soup, and my wife had the potato pancakes appetizer as an entree. The hot sausages and accompanying bread and sauerkraut were very tasty. It was also served with hot mustard and horseradish. The portion was enough to be a dinner for 1-2 people. The accompanying bread was also very tasty. The goulasch is some of the best in town. It's got a real zip to it. It was served with red cabbage with an intense (great) flavor and very good home made spaetzle. Again the portion was just enormous. I have more goulash at home in my fridge than I know what to do with. I'm also very excited for lunch as it was very good. I preferred the smaller chunks of meat to the bigger ones but that might be a personal thing. Finally, the potato pancake appetizer as dinner. It's essentially a half-size order of the entree, which must only be ordered by Paul Bunyan or Andre the Giant. There was something like 8 large pieces of potato pancake.

2016-05-11,5.0,"I've been going to Laschet's regularly since 2002. Without hyperbole, it is one of he best German restaurants/bars that I have ever been to.  Why is it so good? Why should you plan on spending four hours on Saturday night here? Here are a few reasons. 1. The beer. The selection of perhaps 12 different German and Austrian beers on tap has to be the best in Chicago. This place concentrates on Lagers -- good, easy-drinking Lagers. What about a Stiegl from Salzburg, Austria or a König Pilsener (ein Köpi, wenn du willst) from Duisburg. Don't come here expecting American craft beers -- this is about German beers! And with the high volume of drinking, all the taps are fresh. 2. The Food. Just as important as the beer. Everything is fresh and made to order. Portions are enormous. And guess what? German food has vegetarian options, too. Ja, wirklich. Die Deutschen essen auch vegetarisch! Of course you can have great Schnitzel, Rouladen, Sauerbraten, and duck, but there's also a tasty mushroom Spätzle on the menu. And here's my Geheimtip -- an insider tip of sorts. Order the Hackepeter which is a raw, minced beef, served with onions, capers, and bread. It's the best I've ever had outside of Germany. 3. Ambiance. An incredibly comfortable place to sit, talk, drink, and have fun. Plenty of regulars and plenty of beer lovers. Great for all people, including kids. A bit kitschy with its decorations, but that part of the attraction.  This is a neighborhood bar that has lots of appeal on the North Side.

It's simple really - The broth was so crazy good that the meat was secondary, hanging out filling up the bowl unnecessarily, damn it. Ordered the steak tartare, which was served spread very thinly on dense bread.  Took us four pieces of choking dry bread down before I suggested we scrape the tartare off the bread with a spoon and scrap the bread entirely.  Much better. The sauerbraten - one of my all time favorite German dishes - was disappointing.  Unlike traditional sauerbraten, the gravy was light in color and not very rich.  The meat was cut thicker than I'm accustomed to and it was really dry, despite being covered in gravy.  The spaetzle wasn't soft, it was pan fried and crispy, not lightly sautéed.  It was hard to find anything I like there, and after two bites, I gave up and set my plate to,the side in defeat.

2016-01-23,4.0,"If you want to step back into a time machine that skirts the era in Chicago (during the 50s to the 80s) when pro-German unity neo-Deutsche-Reich-ers would meet and drink then this is the place. It has since been remodeled and upgraded and mostly neutralized -- but every once in a while you can smell the German-ness - and I don't mean the touristy German-ness of a good Bavarian restaurant --- I mean the German-ness of mid-19th Century German community that belonged to the Lincoln-Turners and maybe even the 3rd Reich Supporters prior to the War - who continued to meet here for decades after in order to be with some like minded members or one or another private groups of secret believers. The first half dozen times I came here it was on the invitation of some very pro-German friends of mine - and I don't mean pro-DDR or pro-BRD. I mean that there was an old map on the wall of Germany including Pomerania and Silesia and a Frederick the Great map of United Germany - and this map was still up in 1983. Once I came her to meet my pro-German-unification friends and I found out that we were there because it was Hitler's birthday. This has nothing to do with Laschet's itself (it had to do with my friends) - but I have to tell you - the place had a lot of people in it - and most of them were pretty darned old. So - back then at least - ""this weren't no tourist joint"". That said - I came here - even under those circumstances - because it is a great authentic German Bar with real Germans in it - and it serves good German Bar Food (not only plates but you can buy a meat stick, aka. ""Landsjager"" from behind the bar. Of ya - and has good German Beer too ;-) .  Another good thing is that there is always someone here to practice my German with. And German is a language that will pour out of your brain onto the floor if you don't pratice it (unlike Spanish which will stick with you forever pretty easily). I love German food & drink - and like Germans (despite their history - because they have good history too - and we have bad history too - so we just don't talk about it) - and I love the German language (it expresses ideas and concepts and sensations more clearly than any other language that I know) - and I love Germany (traveling there and being there and seeing the great art and hearing the amazing music - from Bach to Rammstein).  Yes - I love all this - and I really like going to Laschet's - (even if I am not-a Neo-N).

2016-01-14,3.0,"Took my husband here for his birthday because we both love traditional German fare and old-school dining. This spot sort of delivers. The atmosphere is on point if you are looking for throwback tavern experience. My husband ordered a pilsner on draught and it was crisp and delicious. i had a nice dry white wine. We started with bismarck herring, which I highly recommend if you are into pickled fish. You get 3 giant fillets, dill pickles, onions and a little loaf of pumpenickle bread.  For billing itself as a traditional German spot, our dinners were less than traditional. My husband went the Wednesday special of beef stroganoff which he raved about. I am not a huge fan of the dish, but I sampled some of his and it was really good! The dark brown gravy came out with a tiny dallop of sour cream on it, which surprised me, as most stroganoffs I've tried are much light in color due to the large amount of sour cream mixed in. Conversely, I ordered the sauerbraten. I am obsessed with sauerbraten, so I was super excited to try it here. Unfortunately, when it came out, the gravy was very light looked like it had a good amount of cream in it -- so much so I thought it was beef stroganoff. I asked our server (who was very nice) if there was cream in the sauce and she said, yes, they added sour cream to it. A traditional German sauerbraten doesn't include sour cream -- I've never seen or tasted a version that has it. I wish they would have noted that it contained sour cream on the menu, especially for those who are lactose intolerant. While I typically do ask if unfamiliar dishes have cream in them, it wasn't even on my radar to ask if this dish had it because it typically doesn't include it. The red cabbage was delicious though while the spatezles were greasy and sort of tasted like mini donuts. Sadly, I was disappointed with my meal. Like I said though, service was great and we were offered a shot of schnapps at the end of our meal to digest. In the future, I hope they consider noting that the sauerbraten gravy had sour cream in it, since it's not a traditional take.",0.9937,0.811,0.15,0.038,0.5375000000000001

2015-12-21,5.0,"I'm being a little generous with the rating, but given how unique this place is (not what I would have said 20 years ago when there were plenty of restaurants like these), I'll give the benefit of the doubt. Classic city tavern as one walks in - moving toward the restaurant, you can see it goes back away. Interesting decorations around the place - a deer head on the wall near the only 8 top I saw. Definitely an older place, but pretty well kept all in all. But as I walked in to sit down and wait for the rest of my group, what I was noticing was the food. Large plates of good looking German food with generous portions. As I sit down and glance at the beer menu (didn't have my reading glasses, so had to wait until my brother showed up for the rest), I see numerous draft options. I go with a Pilsner which was perfect for my taste that night. All arrive and we order - for appetizers we get potato pancakes and the hot sausage plate which included bratwurst, knackwurst and a third one (thuringer?) that is escaping me right now. All were outstanding - the sausages surrounded a pile of sauerkraut. Now about the only time I'll eat kraut is when it's on a Rueben - but this stuff was amazing. Our table had two rouladens and two sauerbratens. Personally, I like the darker gravy version of sauerbraten, but this stuff still passed. Good red cabbage... GREAT spaetzle - some of the best I've ever had. Dinners come with soup or salad (I had a liver dumpling soup that was good). For dessert, we had an apple crisp and an apple strudel at the table. Outstanding - perfectly done. One came with ice cream that was really good - thought it was a homemade brand, but come to find out, they buy it from GFS in bulk. Gotta go there and get me some ice cream! Finally, the dinner ended with an offer of complimentary schnaaps - which 3 of 4 of us accepted. We ended up taking half of our entrees home. And what was nice - no sticker shock with the check - all of this is reasonably priced.   After having driven by for years, I finally tried this spot - my only regret is that I didn't try it sooner.",0.9981,0.754,0.216,0.029,0.5843849206349208

Food was not good (except for the goulash soup, that was tasty) Otherwise the rest of the food was mediocre. Service started out ok until I asked for some glasses of water (very early on during our visit) the waitress said they didn't have any ""water"" glasses, but that they were washing them at the time.  Well 15 minutes later still no water, I asked the guy busing tables and he said the same thing. I dine out quite a bit and this was a first. At some point I just asked for any glass for water and she just rolled her eyes and returned with a stack of glasses, a moment later the bus boy brought another stack. Really? How is it possible that a restaurant/bar runs out of glasses and in that case does it only have to be a designated ""water"" glass? Anyhow, the waitress then started bringing out the entrees, out of a group of 9 I was the last person served with a good few minutes in between, there was a joke at the table that I had pissed off the waitress.  So finally I get my plate and I start cutting into my chicken and there is what appears to be a pubic hair nicely laying under the chicken. I was utterly horrified, the waitress came over immediately as she was tending to others at my table and seem horrified herself.

So good. So rare. Most places use pork.  3. Spaetzels. Boiled and then sauteed until nicely browned. Oh so good. 3. Very kind and professional servers. 4. Excellent beer. Not Bud.

We always start with some sausage, which is complimentary at the bar, so we ask for it at the table. Then, we order their Bavarian pretzel, which is pretty huge! You can definitely split one with 1-2 people. Top it with some of their cheese or spicy mustard. Or both. Yum! Next comes their delicious fresh-from-the-oven rye bread! If you order an entree, you'll also get either a soup or salad. I typically get their yummy garden salad with their special bacon viniagrette dressing! For an entree, I just LOVE their chicken schnitzel, which I get with the red cabbage and spaetzle. It's a TON of food, but seriously, it's all so good that you can't help but devour it all!

I should've known this was going to be a poor experience. Upon being seated, myself, my significant other and my 2 1/2 year old sat waiting for at least 10 minutes before being greeted by an SA delivering water. Where was our server? Who knows? When he finally arrived, I knew I wanted him to immediately put in the food order for my 2 year old, and expected (as any server who knows anything about serving would do) he would come back to take our order and deliver drinks. This is not what happened. The next HOUR was filled with what can only be described as the WORST service experience I've ever had. The server delivered the food for my 2 year old and walked away. I then took my son to the restroom, while my partner sat, prepared to place our food order, the server approached the table then walked away. Upon my return to the table, I notice tables around us receiving service and FOOD (we still haven't placed our order). We finally flagged him down en-route to table in the back corner delivering shots (which he enthusiastically participated in consuming) and placed our food order and asked for the check. Another extended period of time passed and the SA came back to fill our water glasses, at that point I asked if he could find our server and tell him we need our check immediately and our food to go. My 2 year old had long since finished eating and was getting extremely restless. I have been a server, I understand things get busy, but if you're a server with any sense, you understand the importance of timing. I wish I could tell you the server's name, but, alas, he never told us. So, there's also that.

2015-03-05,4.0,"Had a real feast at Laschet's last October, it's dark with an old-school bar feel. I love pumpernickel bread and was starving at the time, so I devoured a few slices of their pumpernickel with butter to start. The complimentary goulash soup was incredible and loaded with tender beef. Rich, creamy, and perfect for a chilly night. Definitely get the Schneider Aventinus, it's a dark, malty ale with hints of fruity flavors. The Bavarian pretzel ($8) was enormous, and came with mustard and a delicious cheese dip/sauce. The pretzel itself was the best I've ever had, warm and dense and fluffy, and we had to use the pumpernickel to clean out the little tub of cheese. I highly, highly recommend the rouladen ($18) which I tried a few bites of and couldn't stop eating. The beef was extremely tender and rolled around grilled onions and pickles, and the gravy and mustard were perfect with it. This was another rich, hearty dish and even the spaetzle was outstanding. My fried pork shank ($18) was all right. It was the special of the day and the shank was expectedly huge. It was perfectly deep-fried and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, but it was overwhelmingly fatty and I wished I had some sort of mustard-based sauce instead of gravy to cut through all the richness. Definitely well executed, but not my cup of tea. The sauerkraut, like the spaetzle, was outstanding. Dessert was a decadent German chocolate cake ($5). The two of us were stuffed by this point, but we still polished it off. Service was warm, friendly, and attentive throughout. Highly recommend this place!",0.9944,0.768,0.212,0.021,0.6013797313797313

2015-02-14,5.0,"Laschet's Inn is a must visit restaurant if you live in Chicago. Their location on Irving Park Road in itself makes this place a destination. It isn't far off the L and parking is free on the side streets near by but there isn't a lot of foot traffic at night. This is a neighborhood place with an atmosphere that could not be replicated anywhere else. The unassuming front entrance opens up into a long bar that hasn't changed much in the last 20,30,or 40 years (besides the flat screen tv) and I don't anticipate it changing much in the future.  Beyond the bar, a mixture of families and couples are seated in the dining room having a good time. Our server recommends several German beers, some of which would be difficult to find anywhere else. Their menu is vast with German Classics mixed with more crowd pleasing bar food. We started with the pretzel and Hot Sausage Plate appetizers, This in itself was enough food to feed a small family. We all agreed that the Thuringer was our favorite of the sausages while I would most definitely order the pretzel again. For the main course, i ordered the Wiener Schnitzel with sauerkraut and spaetzle. The Schnitzel reminded me of the old Berghoff Wiener Schnitzel. tender and prepared perfectly. The portion's were more than enough for one. Even though I couldnt finish my plate, our waitress insisted on buying us a Apple Strudel and a shot of Schnapps for some uncontrollable spill mishaps that kept coming our way.  The strudel with whipped cream was incredible, not too sweet, cooked just like you would imagine a German grandmother would make it for her family.

Laschet's is everything that the Hofbrau chain in America is not. It's a local, family-owned dive, of sorts, that is hard to find if you haven't been to the neighborhood. It looks like an established little social club that's been here for decades. Partially true, as my grandparents dined here while my grandfather was still alive.  The space itself is actually much larger than it looks from the outside. The bar area is very narrow, but welcoming. Further back you'll find two separate spacious dining areas. Plenty of German brews on tap for reasonable prices. I had a Spaten Optimator, a Weihenstephan Oktoberfest, a Ayinger lager. Can't go wrong with food here, either. I had the leberkase and my friend had the rouladen. After sampling both, I can say that this place features some of the best German food I've tried outside of Germany. If you like bacon, this is your kind of place. The sauerkraut AND potato salad both have small chunks of bacon tactfully inserted in the recipe! You can't beat the prices, either. I have never seen such reasonable prices on such huge German meals anywhere in Chicagoland. I definitely had to take home half my meal for lunch the next day.  The oompah band (particularly the guy playing the bells!) and the complimentary shot of schnapps at the end of the meal were the icing on the cake, and capped an excellent experience.

2014-10-19,4.0,"Just went here for the first time last week and must say this place is a treasure. It has that feeling you get at certain places (like Twin Anchors) that if you came here in 1979 everything would have looked exactly the same. . . and some of the staff and customers would have been there then as well. That said, there is definitely a wide variety of age groups and attire - there were twentysomethings dressed to the nines, and plenty of people wearing jeans and ball caps.  Even though they're not trying to push the culinary envelope, it is clear they take their food seriously. Our waitress Jo, an older blond woman, was very happy to give us a lot of tips and pretty much ended up ordering our entire meal for us. The biggest hits were:  1) The hot sausage plate - specifically, the bratwurst was some of the best that I've had anywhere.  2) The spaetzle, red cabbage and sauerkraut - sometimes places let these slide and just focus on the meat, but if dinner just consisted of a heaping plate of these three things, I would leave the restaurant happy.  3) The goulash soup, which came as a side, was hearty and the beef was perfectly tender. Another thing I wouldn't mind having as a main entree.  4) At the end of dinner we were each given a free shot of brandy. A nice and completely appropriate touch to the vibe of the place.  We also had the Chicken Paprikash, and the Rouladen, which were both fine but which I would probably skip in favor of the above, or trying other items when I go back in the future (and I will!).",0.9889,0.851,0.14,0.009,0.47545155993431854

While we were there, 2 workers hugged one of the kitchen staff--seemed like he had just returned from being away for awhile. It had a really homey feel.  The food was impeccable. I had the cucumber salad with the 3 Potato Pancakes! Delish. My boyfriend had Spaetzle with red cabbage, with liverwurst soup. So good! I kept stealing some of the red cabbage.

(May 2014) I had been here previously throughout the years, but pertaining to my last visit, my 25th birthday, I was soooo glad to have chosen Laschet's Inn! To begin with, the service here is impeccable. Our waitress was very attentive and had an encylopedic knowledge of both the dinner and beer menu.  While my family ordered a multitude of various drinks, I personally opted for Schneider Aventinus. I must say, it was the most supurb import beer I had ever tasted! Smooth, strong, creamy with notes of banana and maltiness... It was to-die-for. Highly recommended!!! We ordered the giant Bavarian pretzel with cheese, hackpeter, and goulash soups for the table. We were very taken with how delicious they were. In particular, the salinity and creaminess of the pretzel cheese. We were so happy to have discovered it! For my entree I ordered the Sauerbraten. It was by far the most tender I have had in the Chicagoland area. That goes for the spaetzle and red cabbage as well. Hands down! Towards the end of our meal, we were offered complimentary shots of German liqueur. They were a very nice conclusion to our meal, but paled in comparison to our waitress' sensuous happy birthday song and faire! ;-) As the birthday boy, I also got a complimentary dessert of German chocolate cake. What made it stand out was its generous portion of dense and semi-sweet richness!The best in Chicago!!! Since I last dined here I have always wanted to come back. It's a great place to go for parties of 6 or more. I think I have already decided my next birthday dinner feast! ;-)",0.9974,0.78,0.22,0.0,0.5284444444444445

Both the thuringer and bratwurst sandwiches are excellent, as are most of their dinner specials. The smoked pork butt is very solid. Additionally, the sides are a must: potato salad and the warm red cabbage (yum) are fantastic. Personal favorite is the spaetzel. Unlike Mirabell off Addision, Laschet's pan fries the spaetzel to give it a bit of crunch. I really think it's the best I've ever had, maybe even better than some of the spaetzel I've had in Germany.

The new owners have helped to liven up the interior and add a sidewalk cafe, and they very kindly have my favorite, their EXCELLENT Chicken Paprikash available for carry out more nights than the menu lets on.  (I hope I haven't ruined my chances of getting it on Thursday nights for carry out now that I've let the secret out!). Whether you are dining in, waiting for carry out, or just hanging out with the regulars at the bar to catch the Cubs/Hawks/Bulls/Bears games, what you immediately notice is the warm friendly atmosphere.  And if you scan the place, you will notice that everyone has a smile on their face because they are enjoying themselves.   Thank you Matt and Mannie for NOT turning Laschet's into yet another meaningless faux Irish Pub!

It was a nice way to break up the week, kick back, enjoy some authentic German food with great hospitality and attentive service.  Wow, we thought this was so much better than the usual German restaurants that we have eaten at over the years.  There were six of us in our group. We arrived at 6:30 pm and were promptly seated.  We really enjoyed the food here. For starters, we ordered two Appetizers:  Cold Sausage Plate  Sliced bologna, beerwurst, liver and summer sausages served with Swiss cheese, sliced pickles and crackers and the Hot Sausage Plate  Grilled and sliced bratwurst, knackwurst and Thuringer sausages served with sauerkraut. They were excellent and everyone enjoyed both varieties (hot and cold). We all agreed that these are worth four solid stars across the board.  The restaurant offers daily specials. On the evening that we went the dinner special was Beef Stroganoff  which was almagated with mushroom and caramelized onion gravy, topped with creamy sour cream and served over egg noodles with a fresh vegetable medley of broccoli florets, cauliflower and carrots. One person in our group ordered this and he rated it with four stars. The rest of the orders were:  Rouladen tenderized beef rolled with mustard, bacon, pickle and onion dressed in dark gravy and served with spaetzle and red cabbage; Chicken Schnitzel which is a thin breast breaded and pan fried, garnished with lemon wedges and served with roasted potatoes and red cabbage; Wiener Schnitzel which is excellent. It was breaded and pan fried, garnished with lemon wedges and served with roasted potatoes (or your choice of red cabbage or sauerkraut) and lastly Sauerbraten which were thick slices of marinated beef In a traditional sauer gravy served with spaetzle and red cabbage. Although the beef slices were thick it was super tender, juicy and tender. The person who had this dish gave it five stars, while the others rated their dishes with four stars. Some of our friends tried the Beer, and thought it was very, very good German Beer. They also have a wonderful variety of beers, so the selections are endless. We were super full. The portions were generous. The price-point excellent. Service was hospitable. We felt very welcomed here. We had a fun time here! One gentleman, who is originally from Germany, who met us here with his wife raved about how ""authentic"" the food is here.  He was born and raised in Germany and moved to the USA to attend Graduate School. We were happy to hear him compare it to his mother's cooking as well as his Grandma's food. Impressive.

The hot bacon vinaigrette house salad was amazing, the right balance of sweet and sour.  The roulanden was so perfect-tender , flavorful and a delicious gravy.  This is probably the BEST spaetzle I've ever tasted.  The same can be  said for the red cabbage, which was  again a perfect blend of flavors.  My husband and son had the thuringer plaste and it was delicious, perfectly cooked and still moist.  The complimentary shot of schnapps was a pleasant surprise.   I would have no qualms recommending this restaurant as a trusted place for authentic German food.",0.994,0.752,0.229,0.019,0.5347542242703535

A crazy drunk guy who had brought his own beer stein even walked up to our table and told us how he shot 'the communist deer' on the wall. I do love a colorful clientele! We were seated at a large table and we ordered the hot sausage plate-3 kinds of sausage-which came with sauerkraut. It was good and enough for all of us to have a taste.  The weinerschnizel seemed to be the overall ordered entree at the table along with a goulash. Portions are huge -you can share but they do charge a $3 splitting fee.which was fine. We all loved the three bean salad which came with our meals-who knew that pineapple, onions, and beans could be so delicious. The cucumber salad was also a winner-light and refreshing. The weinerschnizel was lovely with some fresh squeezed lemon juice.  It was hard to choose between the sauerkraut and the red cabbage so I had both. Great beer selection and they give you a complimentary after dinner shot-Apfel liqueur is my new favorite thing. They even brought out a complementary apple crisp as we were celebrating an engagement-I will have dirty dreams of that warm apple naughtiness.  Service was fabulous-I love this place!

The staff was very accommodating to our group of 15+ friends. Service was friendly.  The first section of the restaurant is a bar area with some booths and tables. However, if you make your way to the back area, there are plenty of tables that are good for groups. We were placed in a little nook that almost felt like our own private area.  The menu at Laschet's is pretty extensive--plenty of meat and potatoes, though they do offer a wide selection of other items. A few things I have tried include:   - Chicken schnitzel, which is the breaded chicken breast. Can be quite filling. - Side of spaetzle is about $2.50 and it is delicious! I could seriously eat spaetzle alone and be completely satisfied.  - Pretzel, which again was gigantic enough to share. It came with Obatzda, which is a yummy cheese/onion dip. A MUST try.  - Potato pancakes were also very tasty! Now, for the alcohol. This is a German establishment, so naturally, the beer is just as delicious as the food. They've got several German beers on tap (i.e. Hacker-Pschorr, Hofbrau). But one thing that they had that I made sure I had many servings of was the Gluhwein/Glogg, or mulled spiced wine. For some reason, mulled wine is hard to find in Chicago, at least it was hard for me to find-- except for at Chriskindlemarket. So, when I found out Laschet's Inn served Gluhwein, I was ecstatic.

When you walk in it feels like a big hug both with the comfortable/laid back vibe as well as the mouth watering aromas coming from the kitchen. Went with a group of four and it's a place where you can enjoy yourself without feeling like you are bothering your neighbor. As for the food, 5+ stars. The cold sausage plate was simply amazing and the creamed herring was incredibly fresh tasting. 2 of us had the rouladen w/a side of red cabbage and spaetzel. The meat melted in your moth and the gravy was outstanding. You can tell the spaetzel is homemade as there was no consistency to shape and was not drowning in butter. Best red cabbage I've had in years. My husband had the sauerbraten and the goulash was had by another. Both of them raved about their meals as well. We ended with both the apple crisp & apple strudel, both amazing-I liked the strudel better, but neither one will leave you disappointed. We will for sure become ""lifers"" of this great gem!  RUN to this spot. And the price is the cherry on top.

Their sausage, crackers, pickles and cheese are so fresh and heavenly that you will never want to eat these things anywhere else - no I am not exaggerating. And did I mention the portion is huge??? For main dishes, I like their pork shank a lot, which is only served on Saturday night. But the waitress said if you call 24 hours in advance, they can see if they can make it for you, even for a different night. I also love their fried chicken, which wasn't the first thing I had in mind when thinking about German food but definitely a great choice. Their services is pretty good.

We shared a giant pretzel for an appetizer which was delicious, then an order of potato pancakes (HUGE!), sausage plate and spaetzle with gravy. The spaetzle is the best I've ever had! The meal portions are huge and come with a soup or salad, so if you're not interested in leftovers the next day or wearing your fat pants, you could probably easily get away with sharing an entree.

Feels like you're having your beers and meat-n-potatoes in someone German friend's mother's basement bar (such things exist!). We went during prime dinner hour on a Saturday, and though the place was hopping, we were accommodated reasonably quickly at the bar. (They take reservations, though, which might be recommended.) Here's what we had:  Garden salad (4/5): I'm giving this a 4/5 solely for the super-tasty warm bacon dressing. I'd ask for it on the side though, because mine got a wee bit drenched.  Lentil soup (5/5): Wonderful. If it was lunchtime, I'd totally consider getting a bowl of just this with bread.  Saturday pork shank special (6/5): No, that 6 is not a typo because HOLY MOTHER that was some FINE SHANK, SERIOUSLY. It looks like an intimidating hunk of meat when they serve it out, but half of it is bone, and as any self-respecting meat-lover knows, roasting meat on the bone brings out AALLLLL the flavor. Once you get past the amazing, perfectly browned crisped skin, the lean meat inside is just. mind. blowing.  Saturday Königsberger Klopse special (3/5): This is what I *actually* ordered, before I dug into boyfriend's pork shank (see above). I do love veal, and the meatballs were wonderfully soft and almost melt-in-your-mouth. Problem is, the other sides all had the same texture. Soft potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots, all boiled. Texture fatigue - it's a thing. I also wasn't the biggest fan of the lemon-caper sauce, which a) was a little too thick, and b) just seemed kind of a weird taste combination with the meat.  Overall: am looking forward to visiting again, mostly to continue my love affair with that STUDLY pork shank.",0.9917,0.773,0.167,0.059,0.4794841269841269

2013-11-06,5.0,"Laschet's is one of those businesses that hasn't changed with the times -- Thank God! I remember coming here in the 80's when original owner, Karl owned the inn.  Before the craft beer revolution, it was one of the few places to get an honest beer.  Yes, we would have lunch or dinner, but I often took the meals for granted.  That doesn't mean the food and preparations weren't good.  No, not at all.  The fact is that there were at least a half dozen German restaurants within a 15 minute drive from Karl Laschet's.  Sadly, most of them are gone. The décor hasn't changed much in 30 years and that's fine with me.  They've upped their beer game with 12 German beers on tap.  No, you won't find local craft beers on tap but there are plenty of fine establishments nearby where you can.  (Thank God for that as well.) I ordered the Goulash which came with spaetzle and red cabbage.  My salad was a wonderful cucumber salad just like my Mom would make.  No sour cream, just basically a delicious vinegar dressing that was perfect.  The Goulash came with 5 golf ball sized pieces of beef, ample brown gravy and homemade spaetzle.  I took one bite, closed my eyes and thought I had been transported back to the little German gasthaus that my parents took me when I was just a teenager.  There are not many meals that actually take me back in time.  It really was a perfect execution of this German and Hungarian standard.  The spaetzle were cooked perfectly as well. Mom had the Wiener Schnitzel which was just right as well.  The breading was light  and with a little spritz of lemon was very flavorful.  Served with red cabbage and pan-fried potatoes, she really enjoyed it.  She really liked that you could order a small portion ($15.95) and it was plenty.  Neither one of us walked away hungry. I ended the meal with a ""kurze"" (small shot) of pear brandy. My hope is that out-of-town visitors looking for true German food will make the trek to some of the longtime German restaurants in the city, like Laschet's Inn, and avoid faux German restaurant tourist traps like the one in Rosemont.   It's been way too long since I have visited Laschet's and I need to make a point of returning soon.  I'm delighted that the new owners have preserved these German recipes and that the Chef executes them so competently.   For real German food and gemutlichkeit, make the trip to Laschet's.",0.9975,0.794,0.186,0.02,0.380609668109668

To top it off, the server brings over after dinner schnapps, the way they always do it at ski huts and subterranean bars in Germany, to round out the night.

It was cloyingly sweet mush with no crunch and no relation to cabbage.  The apple cobbler had some nice crunchy almonds mixed in. I should say a word about the drink before dinner.  My martini craving was strong at that hour.  The imported beer list was a potent draw, but I ordered a martini anyway, with some trepidation.  I've been in dive bars where they pretended not to know how to make one, not to have the right ""ingredients,"" and outright refused to serve one.  At Laschet's there was no problem at all, and the martini was great.  So cocktail fans, yes, you can dine here.",0.9929,0.707,0.229,0.064,0.6086640211640212

It's nicest in the front and middle room. Our server Jojo was so friendly and gave us a great beer recommendation. The fresh pretzel appetizer with Dusseldorf mustard was delicious. We tried the Thuringer sausage dinner, the Saturday special of roasted pork shank, and the Goulash with spaetzle. All delicious! Keep in mind that German sausages are supposed to have the consistency of a hot dog, as it is prepared by an emulsification process that keeps the sausage really moist.

If you saw my 11-letter last name, you would know right off the bat that I'm as German as they come.  I would be Hitler's poster child of the 'perfect' Arian child---blue eyes, blonde hair. Too bad I don't speak a lick of German, or am out to reproduce children.  Now let's get back to what we're interested in, the food... I always steered away from this family-style, Black Forest decor restaurant due to the dark, dive-bar facade.  Yet, I'm glad I finally stepped foot inside.  The food is pure perfection, and not overpriced like the BrauHaus or Berghoff!  They offer everything my tastebuds desired: -Giant German Pretzel (with their homemade cheese and horseradish mustard): Check! -Potato Pancakes (of course, with apple sauce and sour cream): Check! -Spaetzle (fried crunchy yet soft interior, with a pad of butter on top): Check! -Red Cabbage (sweet, sour, and a ride for your tastebuds): Check! They've got all your classic German breaded/fried/pickled specialties, and a European beer to pair. Their daily specials will make you drool: ~Tuesday: Chicken Paprikash--Cubes of chicken dressed with a sour cream paprika sauce served with spaetzle and red cabbage. Kassler Ribs--Two large, smoked pork chops grilled and served with roasted potatoes and sauerkraut. ~Wednesday: Beef Stroganoff--Cubes of beef smothered in a mushroom and caramelized onion gravy, topped with dollop of sour cream, served over egg noodles with a fresh vegetable medley of broccoli florets, cauliflower and carrots. ~Thursday: Smoked Pork Butt--Thick slices of smoked pork butt served on a bed of creamed cabbage with roasted potatoes and sauerkraut. ~Friday: Steamed Cod--A thick filet steamed and lightly seasoned served with lemon wedges, drawn butter, roasted potatoes and a fresh vegetable medley of broccoli florets, cauliflower and carrots. ~Saturday: Königsberger Klopse--Four veal meatballs draped in a lemon caper sauce served with boiled potatoes and a fresh vegetable medley of broccoli florets, cauliflower and carrots. Pork Shank--Roasted pork shank served with sauerkraut, roasted potatoes and gravy. ~Sunday: Roast Duck--A half of duck baked until crisp and served on a bed of stuffing with an orange sauce, roasted potatoes and red cabbage. Roast Pork Loin--Thick slices of roast pork draped in brown gravy served with spaetzle and red cabbage. Portions are a decent size and can be ordered in both Small or Regular sizes: Perfect for us light eaters and senior citizens, or those who chow down and dependingenjoy leaving with a full stomach.  I split the regular sized chicken schnitzel with my mother and it was just enough.  My partner had the veal that was soaking in a light gravy.  Both were outstanding and came with a variety of sides to choose from.  If you still have room, they either homemake all their German desserts, or they are ordered from Dinkel's Bakery on Lincoln Ave.   I'm sorry to say, but I'm happy there is no umpa-dumpa Polka band playing in the corner.  Instead, all the families and men sitting at the bar create background noise. Note: The kitchen is closed on Mondays!  You may want to avoid or join in during both Lincoln Square's and the German Oktoberfest due to crowds, depending on what type of person you are.  If your waitress likes you, you may get a free shot of Schnapps.  My favorite is the cherry, while my partner sipped on the potent apple brandy.

First, the old German charm.  Having been to Germany several times, inside and out Laschet's would fit right in a neighborhood in Germany.  The selection of German (and other) beers is great, and the prices are reasonable.  The food is also spot on.  The last time we were there we shared a hot pretzel which came with some kind of cheese mixture that was awesome.  The waitress recommended it and I'm so glad she did.  For my entrée I had the rouladen, and ordered the ""large"", meaning two rouladen came on it.  Huge!  I ate it for two days.  It was served with fresh warm bread, soup or salad, red cabbage and spaetzel.  Their spaetzel is crazy good - they pan fry it a bit after boiling it, so you get browned, crunchy ends on some corners, and that mixed with a little red cabbage and the gravy from the rouladen is something I now crave from time to time! We've never tried a dessert there because we've been too full of food and beer, but the meals come with a shot of your choice of 6 or 8 flavors of schnapps at the end.  Nice finishing touch and something we've experienced many times in Germany!  Some reviews say what they had at Laschet's didn't taste just like when they had that dish in Germany.  That doesn't mean it's not authentic.  Not only does each region of Germany (and all of Europe for that matter) have it's own version of a particular dish, but so does each town, restaurant, and cook!  The recipes will vary but they are all still authentic.   We have always had great service whether sitting at the bar or at a table.  The servers we have had were efficient and great at explaining items on the menu and making recommendations.  We'll keep coming back!",0.9927,0.853,0.137,0.011,0.519405186316951

Wow!!!!!, it is tender chicken in a sour cream/Paprika gravy served with red cabbage and spetzel. Despite the dish originating in Hungary, the food was just amazing. My husband got the Frikadellen and it too was amazing. I also need to compliment the sauerkraut which was possibly the best I've ever had. Outside of Munich, and on this side of the Atlantic, it does not get better then this place. Not really Americanized as much as other German Restaurants here in Chicago.

Laschet's is the best experience I've ever had that reminded me of my family's cooking.  A whole bunch of buddies met up here for German food and alotta German beer. I love the exterior of the place, the hardwood paneling outside reminds me of so many towns and villages in Western Germany. The interior is awesome too, lot's of traditional German fare one would expect to see. The bars a lil' cramped, but I like that. However there's plenty of dining space when you move deeper into the restaurant.  I declared we start with Hackepeter, which was outstanding. Nicely spiced and all the fixin's make this a great way to start. We also had their potato pancakes and hot sausage plate which were both really good. Especially the potato pancakes, although I have yet to not enjoy a potato pancake.  We all ordered different meals, I had their sauerbraten with spaetzle and red cabbage. Not before I had some of their outstanding goulash. The sauerbraten had a great sauce but was a little dry and lacked tenderness. Although the spaetzle was perfect, it was moist and had a nice carmelization and the red cabbage was sweet and had nice flavors of bay leaf.  The beer selection is great. Unfortunately they were out of Bitburger, which is my favorite German Beer. If you cant find a beer you like here, then you don't like beer.

So, I'll just tell you my tale and let you decide on your own. The interior is exactly as expected. A lovely, small pub atmosphere offering dim lighting and an array of beer options. My guest and I were seated in the back and greeted by a lovely waitress. We chose to split our appetizer of potato pancakes because, what two Europeans can go for German food and not indulge in this favorite staple? Well, this was a mistake. The portion, though impressively large and making us wonder how large the dinner portion would be, was COMPLETELY dry. I mean, cardboard dry. I assume there was potato used to make this dish, but you would have no way of knowing that. Well, other than that it's called potato pancakes and served with sour cream and applesauce.   Next came the entrée, I opted for Frikadellen (something I'm familiar with from my Russian background). My guest went a more traditional route and ordered chicken schnitzel. (Little did I know that that schnitzel would be my savior in the coming hour or so). We waited much longer than a tolerable time to receive our main course. Though I did thoroughly enjoy the bread served. Upon arrival, everything looked delicious and HUGE. Gotta love the Germans and their portion sizes (=  Well this is when I realized the utter unpleasantness of my dish. I mean, just, NO. My friend insisted I sent it back (something I don't normally like to do). I squeamishly asked the waitress if that would be OK, to which she said that its not something they normally allow, but she would ask the chef. He agreed. My friend was kind enough to share half of her Schnitzel with me, which now that I think back was very, very yummy.  All in all, I can't say it was my favorite place to dine (though I will fully admit that it could be because I just don't know what to order in a German restaurant). The food took way longer than necessary to arrive and I never appreciate being told that sending food back isn't something that normally ""allowed.""

The spaetzel noodles had the slightest crispiness to them (perfect) and the goulash featured juicy chunks of beef with a wonderful, slightly biting spice (just enough to remind you that the Austria-Hungarian empire extended well east!). Delicious draft beer options, including Pilsners that leave room for the flavors of the food. My wife's chicken schnitzel was a proper schnitzel, nothing fancified. Interior and ambiance reminded me of an old school Chicago neighborhood joint like Twin Anchors on Sedgwick--but with a German theme. After dinner, they serve complimentary Schnapps shots for the table, apple or pear, or a combo. Great way to wrap up a meal. Don't see any major flaws in Laschet's (and I'll say this, it's far better than any downtown German restaurant, and much more reasonably priced). Service was great, too. It does, however, seem odd that they carry Italian beef sandwiches and crabcakes (and a number of other menu items miles from the restaurant's main identity and focus, German and Austrian fare). I suppose it makes sense to cater to those diners not interested in Thuringer sausages, saurbraten or schnitzel, but as solid as the food is, I wonder if it couldn't be even better (blow you away) if the menu focus wasn't so broad (quality vs. quantity?). But that being said, if you do appreciate Austrian and German food and beer, this is a great place to go, worth a trip on the Brown Line or even a short drive (parking a piece of cake on the street on this stretch of Irving).

I've only been to Laschet's once.  We were driving out of town and had no way of taking leftovers.  Pity.  Because they served SO much food there was no way either of us could have finished it all. I have eaten very authentic German food since I was a child, thank you, and Laschet's does a very decent job.  Is it perfectly ""authentic""?  I don't know.  In my family we got used to individual variations on family recipes and cherished trying how each grandma, aunt (or dad/uncle) would prepare them.

The restaurant is roomy and what you'd expect to see from a German-pub-in-Chicago. We were seated right away, and our waitress was very helpful explaining the German draft beers. The beers were delicious, and we started with the Hackepeter - tartar on rye with capers and onions. The rye seemed a little dry, but the tartar was good enough.  For our main meal, I had the wiener schnitzel and Katie had the mushroom goulash. The schnitzel was a little too crispy, more than others I've had before, but the side of red cabbage was incredibly tasty. Very sweet. Katie's mushroom goulash was, well, very mushroomy.

We got pumpernickel bread with butter (you have to eat it with butter!) and potato and bacon soup came before the meal. My mom had chicken schnitzel with roasted potatoes and red cabbage and I had the Weiner schnitzel, which is veal, roasted potatoes and red cabbage. It was my first time eating veal and it was okay, but it was great with potatoes. I thought the red cabbage was a little too sweet to go with the meal. We got some mushroom gravy to put on our meat, but I put it on everything except the red cabbage. When I saw Lindemans' Framboise, I thought I didn't know that was German. It was a raspberry-flavored malt beverage and I had tried it once as an ingredient in a cupcake, but then I was saw it said ""product of Belgium"" and I thought I have made a $9.00 mistake because everything I consumed that night was supposed to be German so I should have got a German beer. Oh, well maybe next year. Anyway, it was good. I was sort of drunk after drinking it because you're not allowed to take alcoholic beverage outside the restaurant. The bottle didn't say how much alcohol was in it, but I found out it contained 4.0% alcohol, which is enough to get me tipsy. I also got an apple strudel and it's delicious when warm.

The variety of styles is extensive, and includes pilsener, lager, weiss, dunkel, doppelbock, kolsch and altbier. The beers are rotated regularly so there is always something new to try. The food is the best German fare in the city, hands down. For appetizers try the hackepeter (steak tartar), potato pancakes, a giant bavarian pretzle or the marinated portabello mushrooms. All entrees are served with a warm loaf of dark rye bread, soup or salad, and sides ranging from sauerkraut, roasted potatoes, red cabbage or the best spaetzle around. The homemade soups are outstanding and change daily except for a hearty goulash soup that is always available. My favorite is the liver dumpling soup which is served on Sundays. On my past two holidays in Europe I always tried the liver dumpling soup if it was available on the menu where we were dining. From Munster to Munich, from Stuttgart to Salzburg, I never found a better liver dumpling soup than Laschet's. The waitstaff and bartenders are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.

2012-02-19,5.0,"I went here Friday night, and it was fantastic. The place seemed pretty crowded, but we were seated right away. I literally can't find anything to complain about, and I have to say I love to complain. As someone who has family in Germany and has been a few times, I don't get German food in the US often, mainly because it's somewhat hard to find a ""German"" restaurant and I've never found one I wanted to go back to. But I'll definitely be back here. We first got the appetizer special, which was a big pretzel with this amazing cheese dip. Usually I hate the salads that come with entrees at restaurants and sometimes even ask the server not to bring mine because it winds up being a waste... But I actually really enjoyed the salad here. I couldn't tell you what differentiated it from any other salad, so maybe I was just in a good mood. Who knows. For the main course, I got the potato pancakes with a side of spaetzel. So. Much. Food. The leftovers are in my fridge right now and once I finish this review I will be heating them up for my lunch! And probably for my lunch tomorrow, too. I couldn't have possibly finished the potato pancakes, so the giant plate of spaetzel was not going to happen. I had a bit of each, and both were fantastic. I sometimes make spaetzel at home because I love it, but because my own spaetzel is so mediocre, I had forgotten how good spaetzel can be. The potato pancakes came with sour cream (which I don't like) and apple sauce (which is okay). I dipped the pancakes in the apple sauce a bit, which was good, but reminded me a bit too much of breakfast, so I just ate them plain. Which was not a problem since they were delicious. Now, you're going to think I'm crazy after describing how much food we had already eaten, but... we got dessert. We had our hearts set on apple strudel, but when the server listed the dessert options he listed one cake that had hazelnut (which doesn't seem to be listed on the menu online, so I'm not sure what it was called), and we both changed our minds immediately. The cake was fantastic and we ate almost the entire thing, despite having previously declared ourselves as full. I can't wait to go back here again.

2011-12-18,3.0,"Returning for an annual Christmas meal with a friend, I have the following observations: A) the food quality has declined. Our red cabbage was overcooked and gloppy like caaned fruit you would use for pies. Spicy , sour and sweet,  but gloppy. The Rouladen was tough and dry, and the spaetzle rubbery like cheese curds. Since the cabbage and spaetzle are my primary Teutonic Love dishes, that was disappointing. The redeeming food items were Doug's Goulash Soup, deliciuosly spicy with lots of beef, and the large shrimp in my Shrimp de Jonghe which were tender and flavorful.  B) The new back room where we were seated by a very grumpy hostess had all the charm of a banquet hall in Elk Grove Village. While it does proviide more dining space, it really detracts from the intimacy of sitting up front near the bar.  C) Prices have gone up, I guess, with its popularity. What I liked about Laschet's was the $8-10.00 entrees, which are now In the $17-20.00 range. And I'm not so sure it's worth it.  D) Our server Cookie was fantastic.

Just about five blocks away from the brown line stop of Irving is a very non descript restaurant serving fantastic food and great beer to go with it.  When you enter you are first in a bar then proceed upstairs to the restaurant.  The place is just dimly lit enough to feel cozy but not too dark.  Ethnic music is played inside surrounded by wooden beams and a few simple rustic items that don't make the place look too kitschy.   Super quality is obvious right after ordering just appetizers.   Potato pancakes crackle with delight.  The potato salad is loaded with great flavors of savory bacon and wurst, mixed with classic seasonings Roulade doesn't even need a knife to cut it, the chicken paprikash is DEVINE as is the thick stewed beefy ghoulash loaded with black pepper.  Red cabbage sides and the spatzle will not dissapoint. Then there is the beer... I have never been to a German restaurant that had ever served a distinct piece of glassware for EVERY BEER!  I thought I was in Belgium for a moment.  Ok well one glass was a Spaten that held my Altbier but of the eight different brews served each one had its own distinct glass complete with lettering too.  About twelve German beers on tap, and several bottles. Service is extemely pleasant, makes great recommendations, and even let us have substitutes on some sides.  Not only that with all the beer and food the four of us drank it was quite reasonable in my opinion. I come from a German family and didn't even really grow up liking German food and I LOVED the food at this place.  This is a place every body needs to visit if you love good food and beer to go with it.  JUST GO!",0.9961,0.807,0.177,0.017,0.4627267573696147
2011-08-22,5.0,"All I can say is LECKER, LECKER, LECKER! I was born in Germany and my parents owned a traditional restaurant back home in Bavaria, so I have very high standards for German food and this place is my favorite restaurant for German food in the city! My recommendation is to start with ""Hackepeter"" as an appetizer. It can be shared easily and is best with onions and capers on top. Many of my friends were very skeptical about eating raw meat, but whenever I asked them to try just a little piece, they were convinced and it became their favorite. As an entrée I always order the Rouladen, since they taste just like my father made them at the restaurant at home. They come with Spätzle and Red Cabbage and the portion is so large that you can take half of it home for a second meal (Tip: ask for an extra ladle of gravy when they're packing the to-go bag). You get soup or salad with the entrée and I recommend the cucumber salad. The front part of the restaurant reminds me of a typical German ""Kneipe"" (a traditional Bar) and they recently expanded the restaurant part, which gives allows for a lot more available tables (although the ""Stammtisch"" is the best table in the house). The beer list is very good and they get a lot of seasonal brews from Germany. Pick your beer based on the season i.e. in summer a refreshing Kölsch, in fall a nice Wiesn Bier (Oktoberfest Beer), etc. Most of the staff doesn't speak German anymore and that's the only part of the experience that's no longer authentic, but I can live with that.

Scene? Well, maybe there is no scene per se because walking in the place, it's obvious redecoration hasn't occurred here since the 80s (although they recently knocked down a wall to add more dining space -- hooray!). There are mismatched woods, restaurant supply house tables, some taxidermy treasures hanging from the walls, sounds of steins landing on bar/table surfaces, a constant murmur of conversation and a relatively inoffensive smell of cooking cabbage. It's a cozy little spot that screams of home cookin', and boy do they serve it up. My favorite is the schnitzel, except I order it with spatzle and red cabbage. They're cool with substitutions. I can put away the potato pancakes with sour cream like whoa. When dining with a large group, there's a sausage platter that has to be one of the best deals in the city.

I had the smoked porkchops that came with sauerkraut and potatoes which was delicious.  The pork was moist, and the meat was a light pink tone which shows that the smoke had penetrated the meat.  Great sear marks on the chops as well.  The sauerkraut and potatoes were very flavorful, and their mustard and fresh horseradish was awesome.  My roomie had a beef dish that consisted of slice of beef covered in gravy, some red cabbage that was awesome and some type of pasta that I don't recall.  I tried a bit and it was very good, but the beef wasn't anything extraordinary.  My other buddy tried both the pork and chicken sausages and they were delicious.  Tasted very fresh, great flavor and excellent with the mustard.

The beer selection is great and unique, and the server was very knowledgeable about the options.  The litre (if you will) size is enormous, so unless you know you really like that beer, I'd stick to the half litre.  They seem to have the appropriate glass-ware for every beer on the menu, which is a nice touch.  The weight of that litre mug has to be truly satisfying, though. :) I did have the opportunity to sample my friend's beef rolls (I didn't catch the exact name, regrettably--ah, rouladen), which are covered in the most decadent gravy I think I've ever sampled.  Pretty f'ing great.  The apple crisp, while not as sizeable as the entrees, was truly crispy and as butter-laden as I could have ever asked for. The atmosphere is great too -- super old world, and very Chicago of yesteryear.  The service, thankfully, is friendlier than the decor initally led me to believe it might be.  Despite those of us that were there more towards the time the dining room closed (10:30?) not having received the apparently complimentary schnapps, I would still say the service was excellent.  I will be back in the winter for sure, but I think there is a good chance I will be back even before the fall has really kicked in.",0.9931,0.831,0.164,0.005,0.566795865633075

Even my brother who had a little trouble knowing he was eating raw meat got over it real fast once he tasted it! I had them substitute the capers for chopped pickles though because I'm not a big fan of capers. For my entree I ordered the Goulash which was absolutely delicious! The meat was so tender and the sauce was a bit spicy with a  perfect bite to it. It is served with red cabbage and heavenly little dumpling morsels known as spaetzel. I also enjoyed the cold raspberry framboise which they serve on tap, it was perfect with my meal! I also chose the dinner salad with the hot bacon vinaigarette dressing which was good although a little too sweet and thick for my taste. We all ordered the Goulash with the exception of my father who chose to order the Rouladen. Lets talk about portion, wow they do not skimp and prices are beyond reasonable for this German feast.

As a Midwestern child of German/Polish heritage, growing up in the 80s meant being pummeled with pizza, burgers, and other types of food driven by wildly successful marketing campaigns. It's the sad truth for a young buck like myself. Fast forward 20 years and enter Laschet's Inn.  This place does things right on so many levels - the most important being that you simply have fun here. Whether it was the big mugs of beer, the authentic German music, or the lively German speaking employees, I couldn't stop smiling. My two mugs of Wurzburger beer probably added to the charm. Our dinner took 2.5 hours so don't be surprised when you aren't rushed out the door.  We started off with the sausage platter and a large pretzel - both tasty in their own regard. For dinner I had the sauerbraten but fell in love with the spaetzle. For those unfamiliar, spaetzle is Germany's version of dumplings. Laschet's appears to cook theirs a second time (perhaps pan fry) to develop a nice crust on the outside which is outrageously delicious. Dinner was followed by a free shot of apple schnapps which the parents even enjoyed. There's something about an authentic restaurant that makes everyone participate in the activities.

When I'm not in a hurry, and when I'm ass-deep in a good conversation, the last thing I want is for the food to come out too fast. That said, this is probably not a good place to bring someone on a first date, since the only distraction you'll have to fill those awkward silences is booze.

They do offer some traditional American stuff, which is understandable, since some people may not be inclined to try some of the menu offerings. I can't dock the restaurant any points for trying to make everyone happy. The beer was good, so no complaints there; but get this! You get a complimentary shot of Schnapps at the end of the meal! Isn't that exciting? It should be, since it's FREE ALCOHOL, and it's actually not bad. I had the apple Schnapps. It was tasty. As if this place doesn't already have enough high marks: people were friendly, the table was cleared quickly, and my drinks were refilled promptly. Hallmarks of good service? Check. Overall, you're stupid if you're looking for a good, German restaurant experience, and you pass this place up.",0.989,0.738,0.187,0.075,0.5384562890812892
2009-10-30,3.0,"I want to give the benefit of the doubt, that perhaps it was one of those off nights where everything went wrong at Laschet's. But I'll have to give 3 stars until further review. First problem, the waitress clearly didn't want to be there. It's not that I expect her to be happy, but waitresses should have their ""game faces"" on and sort of grin and bear whatever other crap is going on to keep the customer happy. She half-heartedly took orders and very non-chalantly introduced to us a problem in the kitchen. The deep frier was on the fritz. Now, considering the amount of fried food on the menu, this cut out a good chunk of what is available. We literally had to switch around everything to accomodate what she treated as a mild issue. The brats were good, the beer plentiful, cheap, and of wide German variety, but I was a bit misled by what was described to me as a salad with fruit in it. 3 bean salad with a few pineapples in there does fit the description, but is about as close to false advertising as could be expected. I expected much better, but since I have pretty much blamed the waitress for all its woes, I'll have to give it another shot.",0.9135,0.754,0.149,0.097,0.5073717948717948

I might just have decided to go in on the right night, but this place exceeded my expectations in every way possible.  Starting with what you notice when you walk in: the atmosphere. It's cozy enough that 15 people in the place make it feel happening. It feels like an old school neighborhood restaurant; like it's been here since there was still a sizable German immigrant community in Chicago. There's a great old wood bar where one could certainly spend too much time nursing some delicious Austrian Stiegl.  The night I was there, they happened to have some live Oktoberfest entertainment in the form of ""Peter and his Alpenhorn."" During dinner, this guy played the tuba, the trumpet, the accordion, a ten-foot long alpenhorn (think long horn from the riccola commercials), and a full set of cowbells, which he played an incredible version of ""edelweiss"" on. It was all good fun, and despite the hokeyness, I was blown away at the musicianship of this guy.  Most importantly, the food. It's excellent. I lived in Austria for two years, so I can attest to it's authenticity. Our food took a really long time, but they were really busy, so I didn't mind. I just drank another Stiegl (Try the Stiegl beer. It's one of the best beers from Austria. My girlfriend doesn't really like beer, but even she loved it) .I had the roasted pork shank; crispy pork skin, succulent pork fat just underneath. It came with red kraut sweetened with apples, potatoes, and a side of pork gravy. Don't forget to ask for mustard and horseradish to complete the German flavor spectrum.  The masses may not consider German food as sophisticated as French or Italian, but the jovial, beer-drinking atmosphere, combined with the uber-satisfying comfort food gets my vote every time.

After studying in Berlin this summer (hence the Yelping gap) I had been longing for some serious German food at home. Thus, my birthday came around yesterday (woo! 24 feels so much more legit than 23) and thanks to fellow Yelpers, I picked Laschet's as my destination party central with 10 of my friends.  Oh, boy did we have fun. Some people may think Laschet's is cheesy and too chotchky-ish, but I thought the decorations and atmosphere were super fun. There were plenty of places in Germany that made Laschet's look tame...trust me. Everyone was very friendly: the bartender I talked to, our server, the old man with the accent at the bar who welcomed me as I came in. Our server (hey! Happy Birthday!) gave our boisterous group plenty of time to decide what we wanted to drink, answered questions, and demonstrated some serious patience in waiting for us to decide what to order. The assortment of import beers we all drank were fantastisch. I got to sip a couple: Radeburger Pilsener, Hacker Pschorr Lager and Hacker Pschorr Weiss, those only being few of the serious selection. For dinner, I ordered  the chicken schnitzel dinner, which usually comes with roasted potatoes and red cabbage, but I ordered the spaetzle instead of the potatoes. The dinner came with an option of soup or salad, and I had the goulash. Ohhh, was that goulash delicious. The paprika was dancing on my tongue! And the schnitzel was crispy and tender, just the way it should be (not soggy!) Since I was the birthday girl, our server brought me a piece of apple strudel in addition to everyone's after dinner apple schnapps shots. YUM.

2008-09-07,3.0,"Let me provide some context around the 3 start rating:  Having grown up and living most of my life in Germany, I generally do not go to German restaurants in this country, because every single one I have ever been to has been a huge disappointment (so bad I've been insulted buy what some are trying to pass as German food).    If I have the craving, I just have to cook it myself.   Therefore, even though Laschet's is one of the best German restaurants I've been to in this country, I can't give it more than 3 stars because it still doesn't even come close.   Although I generally find the Bavarian theme decorations and the cheesy ""Volksmusik"" choice pretty annoying, I actually like the atmosphere in here.  The service was also super nice and the beer was great (yes, I've seen some places even screw up the beer).   As far as the food goes, overall this has been some of the best American German food I've had.  The Spaetzle is pretty good and that is definitely the closest thing to real Red Cabbage I've been served (although just a little too sweet).  I didn't enjoy the Gulasch all that much and the Thuringer Bratwurst was just plain horrible. The next time I'm craving German food and am too lazy to make it myself, this is where I would go back to.  If I lived closer, I'd probably go here even more often just to hang out with friends and drink delicious beers.  I will definitely have to go back to try the Hackepeter anyway.  I haven't tried Laschet's version yet, but this is normally one of my favorite things to eat.",0.9463,0.831,0.116,0.053,0.480343300110742

2008-07-25,5.0,"A very unexpected delight! My dinner companion and I arrived 7pm on a Thursday night.  The bar area was full, but the restaurant was fairly empty.  We were greeted promptly and given full choice of where to sit. The waitress was moderately knowledgable on the beers.  She let us know what was popular, so we tried one of her recommendations.  It was perfect. There were several American-oriented appetizers on the menu, and only three of what appeared to be more ""German"" offerings.  Of those three, I didn't want the liver pate, and my companion didn't want the herring.  So we settled on the Hackepeter (steak tartar).  We didn't really know what we were ordering until it arrived.  I never thought un-cooked meat could be so tasty!  However, it was still a bit odd.  My companion was less-enthused, so I had six pieces and he had only two.  The portion was quite abundant for two persons .... probably meant more for three or four persons as an appetizer.  It comes with sides of diced onions and capers.  By definition of ""Hackepeter"", our dish was allegedly pork, but it tasted and smelled more like beef, so I'm uncertain. The dinner entrees come with choice of soup or salad.  I opted for the tossed greens with hot bacon vinaigrette (which was very good), and my companion ordered the mixed bean salad, which was very appetizing.   When our entrees arrived, I was astonished at the SIZE of the portions!  They were huge!  (and I'm a hearty eater!).  I ordered the Rouladen, which was accompanied by Spaetzle and Red Cabbage.  Simply put, it was A+.  My companion had the Wiener Schnitzel, with designated sides that he substituted with Spaetzle and Sauerkraut.  I heard no complaints from his side of the table.  I will offer a couple of observations: The Spaetzle is different at this restaurant than what I'm accustomed to.  In the past, my Spaetzle dishes were usually long noodles in a buttery sauce.  These however, were short noodle-ettes (almost curd-like), no sauce, and slightly browned until giving the item an almost-French toast or griddle-cake kind of consistency.  Nonetheless, it went very well with the abundant gravy that came with my Rouladen!  The waitress believed this type of preparation to be regional within Germany, but was not sure. Also, the Red Cabbage had a soupy/saucy texture to it, unlike the more Sauerkraut-like texture that I'm used to.  It was still somewhat crunchy, but with much more sauce than I've seen before.  Still very good though! In all, the service was excellent, the waitress pretty knowledgable and friendly, and the atmosphere quite German, but not over-the-top.  The only change I would make would have been to save more room for dessert!",0.9888,0.845,0.108,0.046,0.5700599647266315

2008-04-23,4.0,"Here is a beer bar with some legacy. Karl Laschet's has _always_ been a tavern in which you could get a very good beer, even back in the prehistoric days of the early 1980s. That the beer was from somewhere in central Europe probably added to the mystique. But unlike the other mystique beers then available from macro brewers; these brews had hops, malt, and flavor. The beer selection continues to uncover brands and styles which have only recently been plundered by U.S.A.-based craft brewers. Every one of these beers could reasonably have the ""ur-"" prefix adhered to their names. Most of the taps are from Europe. I think I espied one tap of Samuel Adams, and one tap from Summit [the Hefeweizen?]. I was last here on a Thursday evening in late May 2007, during a particularly upheaving week in my personal life. I went here because I felt it would be a relaxing venue where I could sip good beer, write down the outline of what I was going to scribe on-line later, and not be particularly bothered by baseball fans craving another megabrew light. I must have brewer radar or something in my genes, because 30 minutes after I arrived here, who else comes in for dinner? Just Jonathan Cutler from Piece and Nick Floyd from Three Floyds. I forget exactly which beer I settled upon, but I am fairly certain it was a black lager (but not a smoked beer). It has been a while since I ate here. I seem to recall that I was most pleased that I could finally have a sausage with *something other* than pork; and the potatoes were very tasty, probably due to the sauce. Transit: Argh!

The Irving Park Brown Line ""L"" station shall be closed until spring 2009 for its reconstruction (to handle eight-car trains). _*There is no public transit way out of here after 12:10 am.*_ In summary: This is a tavern which won its medals, and its place in Chicago, a long time ago; and it continues to display the Teutonic discipline which put it there.",0.9289,0.928,0.054,0.018,0.4580485527544351

It was located in the bar area so it made for some amazing people watching!  The mister wanted to try one of their beers so he tried the Optimator, which was a yummy dark stouty brew. I tasted a fellow Yelper's pate and it was delish. We started out with warm rye bread and butter, and the mister had the most amazing split pea soup, while I enjoyed the three bean salad with pineapple.

There were sides of warm pickled red cabbage and roasted potatoes included. I ate up ALL my cabbage and I hate cabbage, it was SO good!  I guess if you pickle something you can't go wrong ;-). Laschet's was so nice, we decided to try it twice!  The mister had a hankerin' for German food recently so just the two of us went back last Friday night.  It was super busy and when the hostess asked if we had a reservation I was afraid that we wouldn't get in.

Definitely a must try for carnivores, perfectly paired with a good dark beer as suggested by the barkeep.

The beer list is chock full of German beers that rotate by season- most of which I had never heard of.  But the server recommended the BBK Pilsner and I was a happy camper!  Kept thinking about that old drinking song, ""Eins, zwei, drei, vier, lift your stein and drink your beer""! For an appetizer- you must try the authentic hackepeter.  My grandma used to make this but I haven't had it in years- instead opting at restaurants for its counterpart which is steak tartar.  The hackepeter is served on little wedges of rye bread and comes with capers and raw onions for seasoning.  Very good! For my entree- since I am not a big sausage fan, I chose to go with the Wiener Schnitzel- which is pounded veal that has been breaded and fried.  Served with lemon wedges to squeeze over it all and simple potatoes, there was enough food for two.  You also get a choice of soup or salad.  I am so glad that I asked the server what his recco was as I got some of the best homemade pea soup I have had since I lived at home! Go for the soup! The place was packed, the volume was loud and the ambiance is like being in a neighborhood bar in Germany (right down to the local pictures on the walls!)  But for this Frau- if I ever get a craving for German food, you'll find me at Laschet's.",0.9784,0.879,0.105,0.016,0.417636853886854

Inside, it's got a long bar and a dining section off to the side, plus an even larger elevated dining area in back. The walls are adorned with black & white photos of Oktoberfest kings and queens of years past. And there's a somewhat lewd mural on the wall of angels getting drunk and pouring beer. The mural even features a female angel with a ""wardrobe malfunction."" (see attached picture with review). We had a huge selection of German beers. While I didn't drink any, it was impressive to see the beers served in different glasses or mugs depending on the one you ordered.  John B got a pickled herring appetizer. It looked really good and smelled awesome too, almost like my mom's home-made on Christmas Eve. I skipped the appetizer and went for a thuringer sausage dinner. The meal came with a delicious split pea soup. After the soup, my sausages arrived: two juicy, thick and tasty sausages that would compare in flavor to some of the best Polish sausages I've had. The casing was tender and not leathery at all. I could only finish 1 of them. The warm German potato salad was good too. Nikki C kept it simple and got a bratwurst & sauerkraut sandwich with fries. It was a good choice too, as the brat looked massive in the bun.  The place was lively and good for conversation. They did not rush us out though the place was pretty full. And as a bonus touch, one of the waitresses working there was a Lane Tech senior herself. With it being a Lane Yelp event, we included her in our group photo at the end.

The Schnitzl was tender, the Rouladen was really fresh. The spaetzle, oh the spaetzle! Tiny, tender piles of gravy scoops boiled and then gently browned in butter. I've always had a love/hate relationship with spaetzle. It was a staple growing up when visiting the Great-Grandparents. Oma was famous for her tiny dumplings. Us small children waiting waiting waiting for the right minute when the lid would come off the pot and never ever a second before the time was right. Magic, at that age (her's or our's) is always exciting. I, myself, have not mastered the art of this magic. The people in the kitchen at Laschet's Inn have. The sauce of the Rouladen fit the definition of Piquant word for word. Creamy but tangy, peppery, hot; tasty, flavorful, appetizing, savory; pungent, sharp, tart, zesty, strong. Magnificent! Additionally, the server offered us traditional after dinner Schnapps. I choose to take Edelkirsch, as we do at home. We ordered Strudel for desert, which was slightly disappointing. I will ask them when I go back if they suggest it that night or not. They were spot on and honest about the Rouladen's freshness, as we did not bother asking about the strudel, I can not blame them.

2007-01-15,4.0,"Gut gemacht, Laschet's Inn!  This is my favorite German restaurant in the winter. They don't break out the lederhosen-clad oompah band in the evenings like Uberstein and Chicago Brauhouse, and they don't appeal to the over-the-top kitsch decorations like Mirabelle's, which are GOOD things in my book.  Surely, there are definitely some German memorabilia adorning the walls and the bar, but they don't scream, ""we're trying to create the most kitsch Bavarian experience we can think of"" -- the effect ends up being that of a nice traditional Chicago influence in a German restaurant.   It's a fairly small space, divided into two split-levels: the bar level where you greeted when you first walk in, with the bar and a few tables, and the main dining level just a few steps up onto the split-level.  Overall, it's a very cozy, brightly lit, comfortable and inviting atmosphere.  I was suprised to find that most of the diners seem to be in their late 20's and 30's, but there were also older families and obvious regulars.  There was one bartender, two waiters and a lady who appeared like one of the owners working the rooms, but they all seemed to enjoy working together, barking out drink orders in German, and exchanging jokes and jovial comments with each other and the customers.  Overall, it's a very friendly atmosphere.   There is a row of TVs perched on the top of the bar shelf, but they volumn was muted the night I visited.  Instead, my focus was on the row of German and Austrian beers on tap -- about a dozen or so with some of the usual suspects (Spaten, DAB, a few hefeweisen varieties) as well as rarer ones (Spaten Optimator, Stiegl (Austrian)), all mostly within $4-5 range, served by a friendly bartender.  Our grou p of three did not mind at all, waiting for 20 minutes at the bar for a table on a Saturday night.   The dining tables are bunched fairly close together, so our German waiter had to squeeze through the diners to serve us, but the service was prompt, courteous and attentive (despite the physical obstruction), and as the atmosphere is a friendly one, the other diners didn't seem to mind.   The dishes are served in huge portions, and our group of three shared two entrees, Goulash and Roasted Veal (on recommendation by our server), and they were generously portioned, well seasoned and prepared right, and of course, served with the delectable Spaetzle other Yelpers have already mentioned.   When the dishes were cleared out, our server came over and produced the shooters and poured three generous shots of (peach) schnapps.  We lingered around for a bit, enjoying the atmosphere and our conversation, and he showed up AGAIN with the bottle to pour us another round!  I jokingly mentioned that I liked my schapps drier, and he offered to give me the ""stiffer stuff"" which I quickly waived with a smile -- four beers and two schapps were plenty for me.  He happened to be taking a short break at the bar when our group was passing by the area to leave, and he thanked us again with a big smile.   Lachet's Inn is NOT the place to go if you fancy a gourmet, avent-garde dinner (as German fares tend to be of the meat-n-potatos type), but it's a perfectly comfortable, cozy place for a hearty dinner on a cold winter evening.   My friends (never dined at a German restaurant before and are fans of places like Mia Francesca) were thrilled with the dining experience.",0.9991,0.779,0.21,0.011,0.45695767195767195

We did not take Mark's suggestion to get there early and so endured a 15 minute-wait--no big deal because it gave us an opportunity to see all the goodies coming from the kitchen and to enjoy our drinks.  The place was incredibly busy so we waited a bit more for our rye bread and to place our orders, but the relaxed, friendly environment made it easy to be patient.  Besides, by the looks of what other patrons were eating, it looked like the wait would be well worth it. We actually split our entire dinner, which was a good plan (unless you want leftovers)--the schnitzel was HUGE and delicious (Justin liked it better than what he'd eaten in Munich), the potatoes crisp and flavorful and the sauerkraut peppery and addictive.  The spaetzel was good, but I actually prefer Hot Chocolate's (of all places), made even more flavorful with pork belly.  By the end of the meal we were basically bursting, but needed a bit of strudel to complete the Oktoberfest experience--a very sweet ending to a great, reasonably-priced dinner. My only complaint of Laschet's is my most frequent complaint of restaurants with bars in close proximity--smokiness just bugs me... However, the food, drinks, price and family-feel to the place (and I don't mean kids running all over or strollers jamming the aisles--I'm just talking camaraderie and fellowship) ensure that we will be back time and again.  Brauhaus has its merits and the live music is fun, but Laschet's food is certainly in a class of its own.",0.9975,0.758,0.227,0.015,0.485548115079365
