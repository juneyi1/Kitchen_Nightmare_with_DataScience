I like that they do have a great kids menu with several choices. And they do have a sweet deal that kids meals are free when an regular meal is purchased--but only before 9am.  My son chose the plain waffles and a side of sausage links.  I chose the Avocado Beach Omelet (egg white only) with bacon, Swiss, spinach and avocado, with a side of cheesy grits.  We also got a side of fried green tomatoes.   All of it really disappointed me.  The omelet wasn't really well-made.  Cheese on one side, avocado on the other, one or two bits of bacon and the spinach was stringy. The cheesy grits seemed old, it came in a small bowl and the outer edges were hard and the only edible area was the center. I had a bite of my son's waffle and it was spongy and the sausage looked like it came from the frozen section and tasted like it too.   The fried green tomatoes were rock hard--and we only shared one (it was a plate of three).  flavorless and the tomato puree topping it was way too acidic.  *sigh*  so disappointed.  The only redeeming quality was our server who was super friendly and checked on his often and ensured my son didn't need anything.",0.9794,0.819,0.141,0.039,0.5705799755799755

I've been back here three times since, and it's become a regular brunch spot for me.  I can't speak to a wide range of food here, because every time I go I always get the GF Eggs Florentine. SO GOOD. They use biscuits from Wheat's End, and it's so nice to be able to have a bread product that actually tastes like it's supposed to. The spinach and eggs and bacon are delicious. Combine that with a decent cup of coffee, and I'm pretty happy. Add on the cheese grits, and I'm sold. I've only ever gone here solo, but I've always had good service from the waiters despite that.

2016-03-14,5.0,"I just visited Wishbone for the second time this month this past Thursday and I was blown away both times. I am always on the search for quality Southern food when I'm feeling homesick and I found it! The first time I went was for lunch. I had an appetizer of hush puppies (about $4) and ordered the soup and slider pair (about $9). The soup was creamy and chowder-like with large pieces of fish and great spices. The slider was a petite brisket served with slaw. SO GOOD. The second time I returned was for dinner. I ordered the chicken and waffles (about $11), skeptical given that is one of my favorite southern dishes. I couldn't have been happier. The waffles were made in a heart waffle iron which was especially nostalgic of my childhood. Normally chicken and waffles come with a chicken breast atop the waffle, but instead the meal came with 5 or 6 breaded chicken fingers that were so delicious, I actually ate them separate from my waffle so I wouldn't drown them in syrup. I highly recommend either option to anyone visiting, but I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Additional positive about this place: it's very friendly to all diets. My friend was doing the Clean 30 cleanse and could find two separate options on the menu she was able to eat without having to alter them in any way (great for anyone that is gluten free) ANOTHER plus: The owner is SO NICE. He stood and talked to my friend and me for quite a while and even made recommendations for other places we should try with good hush puppies.

Everything was deliciously prepared and the ambience in the outdoor made it seem as if it wasn't so crowded if we would have chosen to eat in the inside dining area.  We brought the little one with us and we enjoyed our brunch as he slept.

I have some food allergies (gluten, dairy, corn) and called a couple months ago to see if they would be able to work around them and it seemed they would.  Today, we went there for Mother's Day which of course was very busy (half hour wait to be seated, then a while for drinks and food). When I asked about the potatoes, the server believed they were made in butter. When I asked if a separate order could be made with olive oil, she said they were too busy.  I asked to speak with a manager who said he ""didn't know what planet she was living on"" but the potatoes weren't made in butter (rude!). He checked and they were made in corn. I again nicely asked if they could make a side with olive oil instead and he basically laughed at me telling me they were way too busy. Again, how rude! On top of it, they made my mom's order wrong- where she would be very sick if she didn't notice. I understand busy - I don't understand lazy or rude.  I won't be returning to this restaurant when many others in the neighborhood are very accommodating for and understanding of those with allergies!",-0.8554,0.857,0.056,0.088,0.5416666666666666

There was only one time where I thought they were actually kind of rude, so I guess that's decent after having been a regular here for years. Once, I was with a party of 3 and another party of 3 who came in after us got seated. After which a party of six got seated. When I mentioned that others were seated before us, the older woman up front made a face and said, ""Yeah, that was a party of SIX."" Um yeah, lady, I know that. I'm talking about the party BEFORE that one. Anyway, that's the exception, I just thought I'd warn you about THAT lady, but I don't know her name. :)  Everything I've tried here is pretty good.  Even the coffee. I love the home fries with the sauteed onions, which come with many of the breakfast entrees. I love that they offer sauteed spinach as a side, which is yummy and has a splash of lemon.

I used to wait tables for years and I completely understand when restaurants are busy and it takes longer, but they weren't busy!

When I first moved into the neighborhood a few years ago, Wishbone was one of the best family friendly restaurants in West Lakeview.  Upon my return, it seems that the most recent reviews speaking of their demise are accurate. We arrived around 10:30 on Sunday morning.   In the past Wishbone always had a line out the door at this time so I expected we would have to wait to be seated...nope.  My party was seated right away, which was a pleasant surprise, but also a red flag that something was amiss.  Our server did his best to take good care of us, but the restaurant was clearly understaffed and he was slammed (he had to seat us himself, and had no one to help bring out water, refill coffee etc). Our food could be described as mediocre at best.  I ordered the crawfish benedict special, and one of my eggs was already broken by the time the plate was set in front of me.  My potatoes were under cooked and looked like they had just been thrown on the plate, mixed in randomly with the hollandaise sauce from the benedict.  My girlfriend ordered the florentine benedict which she described as decent.  For her side she got the cheesy grits which were completely devoid of any flavor. It seems someone has lost their passion or given up, because this place used to be a real gem.  If I could give them 2.5 stars I would but I decided to round up based on nostalgia.  Maybe I'll be back, but probably not anytime soon.",0.9893,0.8,0.161,0.039,0.447874149659864

2014-06-08,1.0,"I used to come here over 10 years ago when I used to live in Chicago. I was happy to see it was one of the few places in the neighborhood still open on a recent visit with my brother. After this experience it probably should have closed a long time ago.  First off after being seated at a booth by the windows if you look up at the big light fixture above where your plate of food will be there is so much dust around this fixture as if it hasn't been cleaned since the 90's. It doesn't take much to clean this especially considering it hangs directly above the table. 1st strike! We ordered 2 Sunday brunch entrees and drinks. While waiting for food I was never asked for a refill for coffee or water as servers just pass on by seeing both empty. You shouldn't have to chase down servers and bussers to ask for refills when it's clear that all glasses are empty. That's your only job so I don't think it's asking too much for you to do it at the very least at a subpar level. Strike 2!!  After first bringing over both wrong dishes and waiting another few minutes we received entrees. Both breakfast dishes have home fries though one plate has about half the amount than the other one. How disorganized is this kitchen that the cooks and runners both looked at these plates and thought this looked right? Complete lack of consistency and just throwing food on the plate is what this looked like. After reading some of the other reviews on here I seen this being a common complaint about the plating. After commenting to the waitress she said this happens some times and that's pretty much it. No attempt to resolve the matter. That was the problem with my dish. My brother had some eggs with $3.50 side of bone in ham. The ham was two thin pieces of cold, overcooked meat that tasted like a metallic char. I had to taste it myself just to confirm. After letting the waitress know about the home fries and now the ham....my brother ordered something else because it was unedible. The sausage that he ordered instead never came in addition to ketchup and any refills. Nothing. Strike 3!!! What did eventually arrive was the owner to take a look at the ham. While looking at it he did agree that it looked completely unappetizing and grey. Thank you ""captain obvious"" for confirming this.  Instead of offering  something else as he knew there were problems with both dishes and letting him know we've been coming here for years, he just walked away. When getting the bill he decides to comp half. Wow....how generous!  So I don't have to pay for the food the owner called unedible and the food that was missing on the other plate. We made sure to let him know that if he was wanting to make sure a customer doesn't leave upset with a bad experience he did a pretty pitiful job. An owner chooses to lose two long time customers in exchange for two scraps of ham I wouldn't even give to a dog.  How all these lakeview sheepeople are waiting in line here is beyond me....there's a handful of greasy spoon breakfast places in the area serving way better food than this. I would've loved to give this place a great review as it's been a neighborhood staple for a long time but with real low standards on cleanliness, service, food, presentation, and customer service...this is an extreme failure on all levels!",0.6266,0.883,0.063,0.053,0.4934700176366843

2014-03-03,2.0,"I have been coming to this location for over a year now. We loved it until the past couple times. The food in itself is very good. But my problem is with some of the wait staff they have working there. This one waitress in particular. The last couple times we've had her just left us shaking our heads. The first couple times it was just a forgetting certain side items we ordered and still putting it on the bill. Just had to mention it and it was taken off, no big deal. But then the last time we were there was just unsatisfactory. My friend and I had ordered the Mega Mimosas for 8 dollars. When she brought us the drinks(yes the same waitress as before)they were brought out in little glasses, certainly not the ""mega"" they had claimed to be. The only reason why I knew this was because I have seen what the mega glasses actually look like. When I explained to her the situation all she could say was ""oh they are mega because of the peach nectar inside"". Now, the last time I checked mimosas were just oj and champagne, unless otherwise stated of course. So I double checked the menu and low and behold the description was just plain oj and champagne. She seen that I looked at it in the menu and quickly came over and grabbed the menus off the table and stated she would get the manager. Then the manager came over, looking very non manager like, told us that they ""ran out of mega  glasses so they have to put it in the smaller ones"" and that we were only going to get charged for the smaller ones. Well, long story short when we got the bill I has asked for mine separate. She wasn't too thrilled with that idea and shrugged me off. And then added gratuity on the check making sure she gets her 3 dollars. Now I am not quite sure if she was able to do that on a separate check just for one person. But the reason why I am giving this only two stars is because if they didn't have what I ordered I should have had to the right to know that. Not just try and get away with charging me 8 dollars for a drink that clearly isn't my drink. Oh, and the fact I was told some bs reason why my drink wasn't my drink. Clearly she was a liar or she doesn't know the menu very well. All in all if we ever decide to go back to this location over the one in the west loop, if we get sat at her section, we will ask to be moved.

By the time we go back to the restaurant to pick up the condiments the pancakes are cold. If we pay extra for fruit (almost $10!) we don't receive the fruit. If we ask for no cheese in the Omelet, there is cheese. At one point, the lady at the counter wouldn't let us leave without checking the bag and the orders during that time period were ok but now that we are back to just picking up and not checking (different person)...for some reason the order cannot be filled without mistakes...simple order...almost the same thing every weekend with minimal alterations.  We were supposed to have a credit on our account for the fruit incident referenced above. As soon as my bf came home with the food and I knew the fruit was MIA, I called and spoke with the manager, who at the time was cordial and indicated she would credit our account for the fruit and the next time we ordered it would be applied. So...this weekend when my bf went in to pick up the food and indicated we had a credit from the manager, the same manager I spoke with the previous weekend interrogated him regarding the credit as if he was making it all up.

It was inedible.  I've had it before, as I said, and this isn't how it tastes.  I had a couple of specialties; mashed potatoes and green beans with carrots, both were great.  The sweet tea had so little sweetness that I thought they had brought me unsweetened by mistake.  When they came  back to fill it, I saw all the unmixed sugar at the bottom of the pitcher.  I had red velvet cake for dessert and it was great. The appetizer was brought at the same time as the meals which isn't that big of a deal, but a little more attention to detail would bring this score up for me.

It had lots of odd paintings of farm animals, everything was done in bright colors, and the restaurant had just an overall fun décor.  Our server was great, and helped us narrow down our choices with some explanations and recommendations. I got a fried tomato breakfast sandwich which had fried tomatoes coated in a corn meal type batter, thick cut bacon, fried eggs, and cheese, all in between jalapeño corn bread. The 2 years it cut off of my lifespan was well worth it. The homefries that came with it were delicious as well. The other two at the table got a really good andouille hash and shrimp n' grits which made me second guess my choice. This place definitely focuses on southern style cooking, and they do it right. When we were there they had a weekly specials menu, which is where I got my selection from. It's awesome that they change this so often so that there is always something new to try when you go there, and they definitely put an emphasis on having options that you normally wouldn't see anywhere else. I can't imagine looking over the menu and deciding on eggs and toast after seeing all the options they offer. The prices were all reasonable with the serving size and quality at around $10 a meal.

I'd been wanting to try this place for a while, so I was glad when we ventured on over, about a ten minute drive from their place. We wanted to sit outside, but all the tables were full, so we decided to sit inside, where there was plenty of seats available. My 2 buddies had just eaten breakfast, so it was only me eating. I decided on a omelette with spinach, tomato, and mushroom. I had a choice of home fries, grits, or black beans. I decided on the latter. I wanted to get some pancakes/corn cakes instead of the corn muffin, biscuit, or toast, but I was not even given the option. Not even a substitute or an upcharge option. There's one ding. The food was decent. It came out relatively quick too. My omelette was nothing special. I could have made the same thing at my house. The beans were vegan, but I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. The corn muffin was a bit crumbly for my liking, but it was the best part of my meal. I also had a side of sweet chili bacon. The bacon was chewy, and the sweet chili glaze was nice, but neither were very memorable, because I almost forgot I even had it. Decent prices for the meal (8.95 + 2.95 for the bacon). Overall, Wishbone left much to be desired. I would have liked to try their corn cakes, but I was not given the option at all.

The two crab cakes were the size of flattened golf balls, with just enough filler to keep them together and lend a little flavor. Very successful, and the crab had clearly been well picked for shell because I didn't encounter any.  I love grits, and the cheese grits were great: they came in a cup and were smooth in texture and mellow in flavor.  The biscuit was not as light as some I have had, but it was not the doughy-bottomed ones you all too frequently encounter.  The bacon deserves a star of its own! A delicious balance of standard bacony goodness stepped up with sweet smoke, then studded with a crunchy carapace of cracked black peppercorns. Salt, sweet and spice: you need nothing else!

I have not tried everything, but so far what I have had has been great. Shrimp and Grits first and foremost. The sauce is thick and creamy, heaped with juicy shrimp and dotted with green onions. The blackened catfish is lightly seasoned and a popular choice when when we've brought guests there. My sisters really like the belgian waffles with the whipped cream and strawberries with a side of bacon. We also recommend the kid's smoothies. Yum! The cheese grits are great and so is the hoppin jack ( black beans with cheese, tomatoes, scallions). The Jambalayan Cajun Stew is also worth trying.

2013-02-06,1.0,"OKAY PLACE TO EAT...UNTIL THEY SCREW UP. You know, I don't remember that much about the food, as it's been over a year and a half since I've eaten there. And the reason I haven't eaten there is the fun part of this review, and the Stuff from Which Customer Service Nightmares are made. I decided to take my parents to Wishbone for Sunday brunch, as I recall I had something good there before. The place was packed, so we placed an order to go. It arrives after about 20 minutes and we go home to eat.  Only, it isn't the food we ordered. it isn't even new food. It's someone else's, partially-eaten food. Thanks for making me look like a moron for having recommended we eat at your restaurant, Wishbone.  Containing my anger, I leave my parents to rustle up some pancakes at my place and take the food back to the restaurant. Initially a server notices me waiting for someone to come over, and I explain to him the problem. I ask to speak to a manager and he brings back a hostess/assistant manager, who apologizes for the mix-up and offers to replace the food. I decline the offer and, lafter discovering that the general manager ""is busy in the back"", I leave my business card and home phone number and ask for the GM to call me back.  I don't hear back from the manager, and call back. I'm told they are in meeting, or off property, or on the phone. Here begins a repeated excuse cycle where I remain polite and patient and persistent, calling in (when i remember to do so), and having one assistant manager (Ama and Ozzie are the two I recall) promise to have the GM - away at the moment - call me back. I leave my name and number and email address enumerable times. I never hear back. Now, the sensible thing to ask is why the hell I didn't just give up and chalk them up as some disreputable scumwad restaurant trying to rip me off. I'll tell you why: they pissed me off. They pointedly lied to me on at least ten different occasions and wasted my time. There was no way in hell I was giving up until I actually got to speak to this mythical GM-person. Today, I called back and asked to speak to a manager. I was put on hold and one of the owners finally manned up and spoke to me. he said they had ""a file"" on me, documenting my calls in. When I asked him why - having my various means of contact - he never bothered to call back, he claimed to - get this - not have my phone number! He then suggested that my not giving this up was indicative of either some severe mental illness or scam. I was flabbergasted. So, here was a guy who blows me off for over a year, and then apologizes for such by calling me either insane or a conman. I think he was confusing my determination to stay polite and determined as mental illness; maybe he isn't aware of anyone who actually knows how to be those things in his life. I don't know. As for a scam, well, hell - it would be the dumbest long-con in the history of Man: a year and a half on a restaurant bill of $45?? Really? Anyhoo, I tried to explain my point of view, but apparently this manager (who I will do the extreme favor of not identifying his sorry ass here) had already made up his mind about me: I was some crazy homeless guy or whatnot. He asked me not to call again. No problem whatsoever; I now know what kind of people I have been dealing with. It's a problem from the top down. I'd be crazy to think that doesn't eventually affect the quality of the food and service. Judging from some of the other reviews, it already has. No one can say that I did not give this restaurant every single chance in the world. I won't be dining there, or recommending the place to anyone. In fact, I'd actively warn people about the place.  Maybe I am crazy for having been so diligent. They screwed up by giving us someone else's half-eaten food, and I wanted them to rectify the problem. That doesn't seem unreasonable to me, but I guess if you are a business owner overly paranoid about your customers ripping you off, it tracks. In some crazy world where up is down and wrong is right. Whatev. Apparently, they thought that by blowing me off long enough, I'd just go away. They could just as easily do it to someone else. They may have been doing this for years, assuming anyone with a complaint is either crazy or running a scam.  It seems to be a crappy (and creepy) way to run a business.",-0.9959,0.818,0.058,0.124,0.40193734217171706

Our food was definitely not warm or hot when we received it. The anglaise on the pancakes tasted like melted icing dumped on my plate. The poached eggs had a teardrop-like shape to them and tasted off. The bean cakes were dried out and tasted like mashed up black beans -- no spice or anything. We ordered the home fries on the side: nothing great there, just cubed potatoes, maybe half a potatoe's worth of home fries. What really ruined our breakfast was how our food was not hot. The food was definitely over-priced for what you were getting.  I'll never go there again.

He surprised me by taking me to Wishbone and to my surprise (can I stop saying this word?) it was BBQ NIGHT. High-fiving a million angels. We walked in and it was EMPTY, probably about 4 other families there... awesome. Our waitress promptly came over to see how we're doing & then gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. I knew as soon as I saw it on the specials that I was getting the barbecue sampler, which consisted of: - beef brisket - pulled pork - rib tips - barbecue chicken - coleslaw - 2 sides (I got the mac'n'cheese & cajun fries) and oh... it was yummy. The Wishbone sauce was PERFECT if you're more into the Texas-style barbecue. If you like something more vinegar-based, I'd go with the Lexington. I'm not a NC-style girl so I, very gently, pushed the Lexington to my boyfriend and went hard on the Wishbone. The 2 sides I ordered were DELICIOUS; I could have eaten the cajun fries all day. The pulled pork had a definite tang, and the beef brisket was super yummy. The chicken was a little dry so it wasn't my favorite, but you can't win 'em all (I'm hoping next time I do, though). For $12, though, you couldn't really go wrong. Our waitress was very nice, but she seemed to care more about the family seated behind us.

The one and only time I went to Wishbone for dinner I had a less than stellar experience. I had family in town for a football game and needed to find a restaurant downtown that (1) was affordable, (2) was casual (3) was appropriate for children and (4) somewhere we could be seated quickly without a reservation on a Saturday night. As my guests requested we go somewhere unique to Chicago, Wishbone immediately came to mind, based on my prior great brunch experiences. Well, I really cannot say how the food tasted, as I was recovering from a nasty stomach flu and had very little appetite, but the service was bad. The restaurant was very quite, but it took our food forever to come out, and after it did, we did not see our waiter again until we had to flag him down to pay. It was incredibly frustrating to be sitting there, practically alone in the restaurant, with family I had talked up this restaurant to,  trying to catch the waiter's eye while he chatted up the bartender.

What he neglected to tell me was that the blackened chicken is boneless and skinless, but the special was bone-in, skin-on. The red pepper sauce with the special was creamy, not very flavorful or impressive. Chicken seemed kind of dry. I ordered the collard greens on the side, which were pretty good.

2012-04-04,4.0,"On a late winter day in February I decided to go out for a late lunch before an interview. I was in the Lakeview neighborhood and saw Wishbone restaurant. I have been there numerous times for brunch and coffee, but really wanted to try their lunch menu. The lunch menu offers dishes like great Salads, Salmon Cakes, Hopin' John and Po' Boys. Breakfast and brunch places generally focus all their creativity on their early eats and neglect the lunch and dinner menus with blasé food. After my great lunch here at Wishbone I know their delicious food does just not stop at brunch but continues on throughout the day with innovative twists on Southern Cuisine.  I walked in and was greeted by numerous familiar faces in the staff and was quickly seated. I sat at a table alone, but quickly noticed there were other patrons siting alone enjoying a meal too. I ordered the Hush Puppies appetizer and the Brisket Po' Boy. The Hush Puppies came out very fast and hot.  Lightly spiced fried corn bread served aside a creamy spicy mayonnaise. These were a perfect beginning and the sauce was a bit addicting, but who doesn't like spicy mayo? Then came the Beef Brisket Po' Boy. I knew this was going to be good. Smoked juicy sliced brisket on french bread with grilled onion strings and a smokey BBQ sauce served with crispy Cajun Fries. The Po' Boy was delicious and left me wanting Mo' and Mo'. My drinks were bottomless and the server was very prompt, courteous and friendly too. Overall, lunch here was great. And with a meal this great I knew I had the inspiration to nail the interview I had later. I suggest you try the Hushpuppies and the Po' Boys off the Lunch Menu and save Brunch for another time.

My wife had french toast with scrambled eggs with cheese and bacon, along with a side order of shrimp and grits.  I had the crunchy french toast with those same eggs and shared the shrimp and grits with my wife.  My stepdaughter had some kind of shrimp omelette.  We were pleased with their service and the food was great.  I had never had crunchy french toast before, but it was very tasty and not overly crunchy either (they dipped it in corn flakes or something.)  We really liked the shrimp and grits.  This place did a pretty good breakfast and were able to accomodate us even though they were starting to prepare for dinner.  Way to go, Wishbone.",0.9848,0.875,0.118,0.006,0.4873333333333334

On the weekends, the wait can be over an hour but that is a testament to the quality of the food. I have been here for dinner before but I mostly come for brunch. I love Southern food (being from the south and all) and I was not disappointed. I have had the biscuits and gravy (great!), the cheese grits (awesome), but the best meal EVER is the Yankee Scrambled Eggs. The eggs are scrambled with cream cheese and green onions. You also get an amazing cornbread muffin (don't miss this!), bacon, and the most amazing house potatoes! i normally get it with an iced mocha with skim milk. My boyfriend has gotten the pancakes which he also liked but his favorite is also the Yankee Scrambled and a smoothie. He likes that the smoothies are made with orange juice instead of milk. Their menu is extensive so there is something for everyone. Their blood mary's are a house favorite and if you need the hair of the dog the next morning, this is the place for you! The seats at the bar are first come, first serve so hit up the bar area if you are over 21 and there are only two or three in the group. The food also comes out super quick and the staff is exceptionally awesome and attentive. I'm a fan for life!

I came with two friends late on a Sunday afternoon expecting to get lunch, but then we found out they only serve brunch on Sundays. I ordered oatmeal and a biscuit on the side. The oatmeal was fine (it came with milk, raisins, and brown sugar all in separate containers so you could control how much to add). The biscuit was the right consistency, but had an odd taste--almost as if it had somehow come into contact with fish before being served. My friends ordered pancakes and sausage and biscuits. They reported that the pancakes were only mediocre and that the sausage was bordering on disgusting.

The menu features a late breakfast, so if you're like me and occasionally like to indulge in brunch at 7pm, you can! Another favorite menu feature: they have ""on the lighter side"" options that still taste good; you won't have to sacrifice flavor for health here. Favorites so far: collard greens, black bean cakes, any of the omelettes, sweet potatoes (whipped and with pecans in them!), and the fruit pancakes. The most important thing about this place though? They have fresh squeezed juices, and you can mix and match for delicious combinations. I highly recommend apple and ginger.

If you're going for the ""quick and dirty"" (intrestingly enough, my nickname in college) Wishbone is a good spot. My unfertilized chicken fetuses were hot and fresh, the sausage (patty style) were savory, and the homefries were nicely seasoned. The biscuit that came with the meal was a bit dry and lacked great flavor. If you're going to be a southern themed restaurant, you best come with the biscuit noise, brah. Star subtraction.

The crabcakes looked good and were packed with crab, but tasted so terribly fishy I couldn't stand them. The overall dinner menu seemed pretty blah to me. The place was described as southern comfort food, yet I was greatly disappointed that there was not a bit of fried chicken in sight. I don't usually want sandwiches or salads at dinner, but their main dish selection didn't thrill me at all. Predominantly seafood, and mostly in cake form--no thanks.  My boyfriend and I settled on the multi-course Valentine Weekend special--$18.95 per person for an appetizer, salad, entree, dessert and champagne cocktail. Everything we picked was delicious. His blackened mahi mahi was so juicy, tender and lacked any fishy taste whatsoever; I asked for multiple bites despite my usual avoidance of fish. My stuffed poblano was OK, but probably would have been better had they remembered the cream sauce and pomegranate seeds the menu said it came with. Compared to the huge piece of fish my bf had, my single little poblano was pretty sad looking. The chicken gravy is good enough to drink as far as I'm concerned, though.

2010-08-25,4.0,"WOW! I was inspired to have some fried chicken after reading about it in the talk section of Yelp. I got here a little early not realizing that they closed for about an hour or so to switch over for their dinner menu and reopened at 5pm. No problem since I'd already downed a smoothie from Jamba Juice and a red velvet cupcake from a bakery around the corner. What I ordered was pretty basic southern food, pan fried chicken (breast and wing), a side of greens, mac n cheese which came with a small scoop of crunchy slaw. The food came out very quick considering that I was one of the first to come in for the dinner menu. Honestly this had me a little worried. But as soon as my plate came and saw in person what I had ordered by the nice and attentive waiter Dan (I think that was his name, I am bad with names) my worries slowly started to fade. I had asked Dan when I ordered if the greens were sweet or more on the tart side from the vinager and he informed me that they were not sweet at all. I was a little skeptical because too many times when I've gotten greens they've tasted like a whole five pound bag of sugar was dumped in. But he said since they cook them up in turkey rather then bacon they weren't sweet. And you know what he was tellin the truth! Granted they weren't as good as what my baby daddy makes me but for being a restaurant in a white neighborhood they were gosh darn tasty. So tasty I was almost tempted to get an order to go. I refrained cause well my tummy is big enough right now. After chowing down on the greens I moved onto the mac n cheese. I found the mac n cheese to be good but not super duper good, but I wouldn't have thrown them out with the bathwater. I think that they would had been better with some spicy sausage mixed in but that is how my baby daddy makes it for me. After I was done with the mac n cheese I moved onto the slaw. Now this isn't just your average blah soupy slaw. No way Jose! This stuff was da bomb! It is a mixture of green and red cabbage and it is so crunchy and was mixed with I would guess some kind of vingergrett dressing which gave it a sweet (from the cabbage) and tart taste. It really did the cabbage right. I wouldn't have complained if the portion for this was bigger. Now for the main part of the meal CHICKEN! It has been forever since I've had pan fried chicken. I honestly hate cooking chicken in any form. It almost always turns out pink and that freaks me out. I wont eat it if it's pink. Beef and pork chops should be pink, not chicken. Ok with that said I started off with the wing. It was cooked so well that the bones were having a hard time staying together. I knew that this was going to be a good thing, and it was. The meat for being white meat was tender, juicy and full of flavor. I was impressed with the lil wing so I moved onto the breast. First the breast is a good sized hunk of lovin chicken meat. I found the breast to be cooked perfectly and not one bit of pink. It was soooooo flowing with juice and so tender. Even the skin on both had just the right amount of seasoning and had the right amount of crispiness for my taste. I have to say that I for sure want to come back for more pan fried chicken and try some more of the sides.

2010-06-28,3.0,"Back in the day, Wishbone had a special place in my heart for their grilled chicken breast with sauteed spinach on the side.  I went back recently and ventured into veggie burger territory.  It was okay, but heavier on the grains than veggies - I usually prefer the reverse.  I opted for a kaiser roll (instead of ""black bread"") and, welp, it was a kaiser roll. When it came to choose a side, I had a flashback to The Glenn's Dinner Experience of '10: no fries.  There were other potato options, but homegirl wants a straight-up fry with her verger.   Because I was denying myself (or rather, was being denied) fries, I subbed a piece of cornbread with butter.  I'm glad I did - it was sweet and, brace yourself, moist.    My companion, Melanie S. of the youthful metabolism, ordered the fried chicken and mac n' cheese.  It occurred to me upon seeing her meal, that I had asked Wishbone to golf with a volleyball, whereas Melanie S. knew how to let them hit a homer.       The service and atmosphere were nice indeed - we were seated right away and scored a primo table outside.  Our server was friendly and helpful except when I asked about the difference between the regular vegetable platter and the ""fiesta vegetable platter"" on the specials menu.  He replied that the difference was ""the fiesta.""  I have a high tolerance for smartassery, but I still didn't get a good answer.   Overall, good, not great.",0.9463,0.808,0.128,0.064,0.4644521420608376
2010-06-22,2.0,"Sigh.  You can do better, Wishbone.  I know it! The brunch menu *looks* to have all the bases covered.  In fact, I was impressed by the sheer volume of menu items.  Wishbone actually does a good job covering the bases with lots of egg dishes AND lots of pancake/waffle/French toast options.  You don't see that often, so bravo to Wishbone for bringing variety into the mix. Our visit didn't start out on the best note when the host stand accidentally crossed off our name from the list before seating us leaving our party of four ladies waiting and waiting and waiting for a seemingly endless stretch with no table in sight.  And an apology?  Nope.  Not even a cup of coffee on the house for making us wait so long.  Nice customer service.  I'm an egg girl, so I decided to go with the breakfast burrito. Mistake.  Big mistake. 1. It's ugly.  We eat with our eyes first, you know, and the breakfast burrito was just a fugly mess of a sloppily wrapped tortilla, sour cream and some kind of brown sauce slapped on top and boring potatoes on the side.  Where's the color?  Where's the ompf?  Where's the visual appeal? 2. The inside of the burrito is Boringtown, USA.  It had NOTHING but soupy black beans and overcooked eggs.  Where's the veggies?  How about some guac?  Maybe some cheese?  Blah.  Bland.  Boring. 3. The potatoes need some serious panache.  Barely even crispy on the outside (critical in my book) they were dry and flavorless. Our service was non-existent.  The waiter looked bored to tears when taking my lovely group of ladies' orders, checked on us maybe once and looked annoyed when I asked him for ketchup for my taters.  What?  Breakfast potatoes simply REQUIRE ketchup, mkay?  Don't look at me like that when I ask for it. The real deal breaker though, was the bacon.  When my friend asked for her bacon to be done crispy she was presented with soggy, floppy bacon slices just staring up at her.  After nicely asking the server to have the chef cook the bacon a bit longer, she was rewarded with three pieces of charred carbon when he came back a few moments later.  The kitchen had undoubtedly stuck the bacon in the microwave because it was dried out, rock hard and you know... carbon black.  Uh... I'm sorry.  THIS is what you call crispy bacon?  Because I call it burnt to hell.   Underwhelming, y'all.",0.5486,0.828,0.083,0.089,0.5405952380952382
2010-06-17,3.0,"I really miss the original location of Wishbone on Grand Avenue, you know, ""back in the day."" Anyway, the lovely Beth R. and I made our way to the Lincoln Avenue location of Wishbone yesterday evening for dinner at her suggestion. Once I realized it was a Wednesday, I wondered if they still had the fried chicken special on Wednesdays like they used to. A quick perusal of the menu confirmed that they did. Score; sold. We both wanted to sit outside on such a pleasant evening and getting a table was no problem. I didn't even need to look at the menu since fried chicken was in the offing, so I only needed to select my sides, but Beth was clearly looking for something less decadent than fried chicken, so she had to look over the menu. Wishbone has flavored lemonades that are really good and refreshing. I noticed that they took the watermelon lemonade off the menu, but they still had strawberry, cantaloupe, cucumber, and one other flavor that I'm forgetting. I ordered the cucumber, which was slightly slushy and nicely tart, but clean-tasting with the addition of cucumber. Beth is fond of veggie burgers, so she decided to order that, but turned her nose up at the choice of side dishes, so the veggie burger would have no such unhealthy accompaniment. My fried chicken? Not so much. I added macaroni and cheese and green beans with sauteed mushrooms. Our food shows up and I could not look like a bigger pig next to this dainty eater: 4 huge pieces of fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, and green beans dripping in butter vs. a veggie burger with no adornments. I may just get a complex if I continue to go out to eat with her. The fried chicken was really good, just not as good as I remember, but I definitely enjoyed it. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy; just what you'd want in an unhealthy side dish when you're already going for broke. The green beans were literally dripping with butter and were overcooked, but the mushrooms were a nice touch. She enjoyed her veggie burger but proclaimed it as not one of the best she's had. You'll have to wait for her ""Veggie Burger"" list to see who holds that distinction. I hadn't been to Wishbone for quite some time and the last time was for brunch which I did not enjoy. Dinner is better in my opinion, and far less crowded than going for breakfast or brunch, which I find is inconsistent and rather expensive for what you get. I don't love Wishbone, but I will be back to get my fried chicken fix when the mood strikes.",0.9888,0.788,0.143,0.069,0.5974168912848158

However, because I have no imagination, all I could decided on was food and couldn't even think of a place so The Boy suggested Wishbone because he passes it a lot and thought it would have a selection of vegetarian items.  Apparently they only serve Brunch on Saturdays, or maybe it was just the Saturday we went. Either way, we went in and was sat down immediately. It wasn't particularly busy or crowded but the place is huge so it might have looked a lot emptier than it actually was. Also, whoever decorated that place sure has a fascination with chickens. Good grief. I have become quite known lately for getting Bloody Marys but there was no way I was going to pass up a mango bellini, nectar of the gods. They didn't really have much in terms of vegetarian items outside of pancakes (and maybe eggs - I didn't look) so I ended up with the black bean cakes with both the red pepper sauce and the mango salsa.

I got The Boy interested in the hobo pancakes, which were pancakes with bacon and sausage baked in, and thought they were delicious (but then again, it's pancakes with bacon and sausage bakes in and The Boy loves his meat).

I was really hoping for some real Southern comfort food in coming here -- maybe some ribs or fried chicken or something deliciously artery-clogging. I appreciate the move toward making Southern food healthy, I truly do... I just want something more than boring salads, xyz cakes and grits. The dinner menu felt a bit lacking, and its execution failed to impress.  The evening kicked off to a great start: warm, sweet-savory corn biscuits and an awesome server. She may have checked on us a little too much, but I prefer that over the other extreme.  I had the vegan black bean cakes with both the red bell pepper sauce and mango salsa... with sides of mac & cheese and beet salad. The black bean cakes were pretty tasty... nothing I'd ever crave, but solid. Against the advice of the server, I ordered the beet salad since I've recently been on a beet kick, and I was very pleasantly surprised -- simply dressed in oil, salt and pepper with thin slices of onion. Terribly disappointed in the m&c, though. It required me to step out of character and ask for the salt shaker!  My dining companions had the Louisiana chicken salad and spinach/ricotta stuffed chicken. Both were unimpressed and felt the grilled chicken was overcooked (plus, the skin was apparently left on?).

The spinach omelet was pretty good, it's nice that you can choose which cheese you like, but it wasn't anything you couldn't find elsewhere. The potatoes were wonderful, perfectly crisp, and cooked with onion and garlic. The biscuit was terrible. Really, I can't say anything more about it than that. The corn cakes... Well, the corn cakes I'm used to are a little sweet. These had a sweetness to them, but they were a much more savory dish. They contained green onions and actual pieces of corn, which was pretty confusing to me, and I couldn't eat more than a bite of it. I could definitely see how some would love it, it's just not my taste. I also ordered the Mississippi Mud, which they claim is the best Thai Iced Coffee in Chicago, but I'm convinced that whoever decided that had never had Thai iced coffee.

Maybe you can dull some of the noise or campy family vibe with one of their Mississippi Muds or a mimosa (or, three). :)",0.9906,0.693,0.249,0.059,0.5513629599567099

2010-02-20,5.0,"After Yelp Office hours at Starfruit, I headed off to Wishbone to meet a pescatarian for dinner. Coming early, I decided to start compiling my dart team statistics and while waiting for my friend. The server came by and I ordered a diet coke and had some water while I scribbled on a piece of paper. The waiting got longer and longer and I was starting to feel awkward.  The server stopped by periodically to refill my drink and asked if I needed anything. Having scanned the menu a few times, I still wasn't sure what I would finally order. There were plenty of children running around climbing on tops of booths and introducing as much chaos as they could muster by dancing to the live jazz music and having the time of their lives. The jazz band was a wonderful touch to Mardi Gras and I felt like it really was finally Mardi Gras. Once my friend came we got down to business and she convinced me that a Mardi Gras plate featuring jambalaya, crab cake, sausage, red beans, and etouffle would be the way to go. She ordered hers and I ordered mine while she took notice of the delicious cornbread on the table that I already helped myself to. The music was loud the restaurant was running on all four cylinders and the night was just getting better. Once the food arrived I was in another place quickly taking out a crab cake and getting to work on jambalaya and etouffle which was rich, laced with taste and I resisted the urge to take my straw and just slurp up the rest of it! Okay, so not really - but it was the best thing on the Mardi Gras plate. Dinner passed by with the server bringing back more and more and time flew by and never stopped. I had a great time and now upgrade my assessment of Wishbone food and service to 5-star status.",0.9015,0.879,0.08,0.041,0.5151111111111111

2010-01-26,3.0,"Chicago has a wide range of comfort/soul food joints, places from the divey to the sublime. Wishbone capitalizes on this in a variety of good dishes and sides. That said, its clear they have some issues with their success, namely in the execution at this particular location.  While I think the West Loop location pretty much nails everything, I've always been disappointed by this Wishbone on Lincoln. The tastes aren't as bright, the grease seems heavier, and the presentation lacks any inspiration. Is it because of the huge dining room thats constantly full of young families? Or is it that West Loop diners have more aggressive restauranteurs vying for their dollars?  Whatever it is, and as much as I dig Wishbone... this location only gets a pass from me. I really don't mind lots of kids in an establishment, but I do mind what that does to the kitchen staff. Go to any big restaurant in the 'burbs to see what I mean. Things just get blandified cuz the youngin's aren't ready for a full-flavored palette. OK this is just my theory, but name me one family-friendly restaurant you'd go just because the food is that great? I mean regarding taste, huge portions don't signifiy greatness.

Today I came by for a hearty breakfast.  It's got that southern hospitality feel to it and based on the quick glances of my surrounding tables, everyone was getting their South on.  Grits, Cheese Grits, biscuits, gravy, bacon, Jambalaya omelettes, Southern benedict. etc.  Of course it isn't as good as your grandmother's cooking, but this is the closest you'll get all the way up here. I don't make it here often, like I do Southport Grocery, but it's a nice spot to visit bi-annually.  The staff is prompt, polite, and friendly, & they have impeccable timing too.

For instance, their coffee is fair trade/organic.  Being from the northernmost of the southern states, I know firsthand you don't get that in many actual southern eateries.  Also, when I think Southern, I basically think of meat, potatoes, gravy, green beans, simple sides, etc.  But at Wishbone, their menu goes well beyond that simple scope. They offer pretty standard dishes, but with nice twists to them. Take the corn cakes as an example. I am a big fan of cornmeal pancakes, so when I see them I usually order them. Most places I've had them down south just make them out of cornmeal and serve them with syrup, done deal. At Wishbone, they are made with cornmeal, but with actual corn and scallions in the mix. Instead of syrup, they are served with a roasted red pepper sauce. Delicious. I had them with a side of mashed sweet potatoes and two eggs, over medium. The mashers were sprinkled with chopped pecans. I love sweet potatoes, so I'm biased, but these were great. Dishes my friends tried included chicken sausage, black bean soup and crunchy french toast.

2009-07-22,3.0,"My wife and I have been eating here on and off for the almost 2 years that we've lived in the neighborhood. I've tried many things on the menu, and although I am no vegetarian, the hoppin John is my favorite dish. I really like blackeyed peas and rice and they can add cheese, onions, etc. Good stuff! The portions are more than big enough, and the price is OK, not cheap, but not expensive. The omelets are OK, just kinda average. When I want a really good omelet I go to Ann Sather on Belmont. I had a breakfast burrito once. They stuffed it really well, but it wasn't possible to pick it up because it was too soggy. They also loaded the top with sour cream - yuck. It tasted good, though. The red beans and rice are pretty good, but I need to add hot sauce. I've made better at home, but it's a pain to cook red beans and rice so I don't mind ordering them here. The reason(s) for subtracting one star: mistakes, tiny 2 person tables, and the back room.  Though the wait-staff is very nice, We've had: 1. scrambled eggs brought instead of over-medium 2. Cheese grits brought instead of regular (...) 3. Attempts to bring us other people's food (!) I guess it could be a lot worse, but if you're gonna do a front waiter/back waiter setup, you have to really do it right or things get mixed up. My wife has recognized some of her high school students working as hosts, so there ya go. Tiny 2-person tables: You know, the kind that you get if it's busy (and if you are a party of 2 people.) There's nothing more obnoxious than a loud conversation on either side of you, coupled with the inconvenience of being reached over by the wait-staff (to drop food, take orders, refill (?) etc.), and being skipped for refills because you have been smashed into a child-size seating area and it's difficult to get over there. If I wanted to eat at I-Hop, I would be there, not here.  The back room: Meh. I don't come here to drink booze, I come to eat. I always request to be seated in the front, screaming kids and all. At least screaming kids know when to shut up and eat, unlike the horrible hipsters that we had to sit next to once. Couple that with the fact that there is a horrible echo quality to the back room, so if enough people are drunk and shouting hipster-speak at the top of their lungs, you literally cannot hear yourself think. Plus, on certain weeknights there are puppets and a band out front, so why would you want to miss that? It's a good place to eat, but only once-in-a-while these days. It's cheaper to eat at the Whole Foods hot/salad bar across the street, and sometimes, the ambiance is better there :-) Ohhh yeah, something I almost forgot - the brunch menu on weekends. When I want lunch, I want lunch, not brunch. There's really no reason I should not be able to order lunch at 2pm on a Saturday, unless I'm at Wishbone :-( How about having 2 menus - what's the deal with that? Plenty of other restaurants do it.

I also tasted the Yankee scrambles (I think that's what it's called) and they were quite wonderful.  Adding cream cheese to scrambles can sometimes go disastrously wrong as I've found out at my own stove.  But these eggs were fluffy, cheesy and filled with scallions. In all, it was a pretty darn good brunch an fairly reasonable for all we got.  I'd say Wishbone is generally a winner.",0.9952,0.744,0.229,0.028,0.5968452380952382

The girlfriend I brunched with is from the south and loved them so maybe that has more weight. I had an omelette with seasoned shrimp that was pretty excellent.

The service is always friendly and the place is nice and big with large comfy booths. The reason I only give it 3 stars is because the food is inconsistent. It's almost like they have two chefs, a good one and a bad one, who alternate shifts! The first time I came here I got the tilapia and my little cousin got mac and cheese for her side, and the tilapia had no flavor and the mac and cheese just tasted WEIRD. The second time I came here I went for breakfast and it was DELICIOUS. So so so yummy. A few visits later I got the same omelet I had ordered the first time, but this time it hardly had any flavor! Same goes for their special potatoes, the ones sauteed with onions. Sometimes they are super delicious, and other times they are too greasy with not enough flavor. After the tilapia debacle I decided to give the fish a go again, so I ordered the blackened salmon. IT WAS AMAZING. Oh my god. I have dreams about it. It was just perfect.  I could go on with examples, but you get the gist. I would easily give it 5 stars if the food was always amazing and flavorful every single time.",0.9943,0.762,0.216,0.022,0.5309752747252747

Thankfully, this is not the case anymore and I can spend the next 25 years shoving my face full of them. Thank you Wishbone for introducing me to the awesomeness that is collard greens.  I first had Wishbone catered at an event for work. Mouthwatering cornbread - hell yes. Crab cakes to die for - check! Collard Greens made in heaven - omg! I couldn't shake the delicious taste of Wishbone, so my husband and I finally biked over to their location on Lincoln last weekend.  I love the restaurant setup. It looks like an upscale diner with out being pretentious or too cutesy and it just feels really comfortable.  It was a Sunday night, and not that full so we got our pick of the tables. Our server was running her butt off, I think she was only one of a few there, but she was still super sweet and did a great job. I had the steak with homemade blue cheese dressing, garlic and cheese mashed potatoes and of course collard greens. Everything was excellent. My only complaint was that is took a REALLY long time. I usually allow more time for steak, but at one point I debated asking our server for more cornbread because I was going to gnaw my own hand off and because it was the most tempting corn bread to ever come within 5 feet of my mouth. And it was really empty, so I'm not sure why the wait was so long. But when my food arrived, it was warm and awesomely tasty and worth the wait.  I also found out they give discounts to people who come over on their bikes Monday - Friday - I believe a whole 15% off.

I got the veggie burger, which was mushy and bland.  There was no sauce on it, no cheese, just a very bland patty, on a plain white bread kieser roll.  It came with no side dish, as if someone is going to order a burger and nothing else?  You have to pay extra for 1 side dish, so I had the rice and beans side dish, also bland and unappealing.  The mac-and-cheese my dining partner had was a small portion and lacked cheesiness.  We got two tiny corn muffins and we had to ask for water twice.  Before this time, I came once in the evening, late.  I understand they were going to close, but they clearly said they were still open and let us in without an issue.  The food was nasty, cold in the middle as it had been reheated via microwave.  They do have carrot juice, which is good, but carrot juice is hard to screw up.  I was also there for brunch before, where I had the french toast.  It was bland once again, and had little batter on it.  It needed cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg or something, because it was not good.

Crabcakes Benedict: eggs were not even remotely poached, completely overcooked hard-boiled quality yolks. Underneath it all, the english muffins were blackened and burnt and actually difficult to cut. Side of cheezy grits = cold. My boyfriends poached eggs were also cooked to rubbery. To their credit was our waiter, who I asked ""what's going on? Everything is totally weak and missing the mark?"" and showed him my overcooked eggs.

Unfortunately it falls far short of being satisfying.  Despite several visits to this location over the years (I work nearby and coworkers sometimes want to go here out of convenience more than anything) this restaurant simply is not good.  Let's start with the food itself.  Especially considering it is southern food it is very bland tasting, doesn't always seem well prepared (veggies are soggy, main dishes are dried out), and it has consistently been this way for a couple years.   Now if the food was great you'd still have to deal with the service.  It is horrible.  Simply dreadful.  It is slow, the servers seem to be consistently understaffed, and when you do get a chance to talk to a severe they are not particularly skilled at their profession.  They have gotten my order wrong on several occasions or will simply disappear for up to 30 minutes at a time.  Any place I have to get up and go to a wait station to refill my own water because my waiter decided to take a break while I was eating is going to get less than 3 stars no matter how good anything else is.

Remember that spacious dining area? Wow, totally impressive...that saved this review from a lower score. Cocks everywhere, and by cocks I mean male chickens!

I mean come on the only reason we came in was because of the way the restaurant looked, and because we love a good southern meal. Hospitality, right? The table and chairs were lacquered with some kind of sticky substance that felt like they needed a heavy scrape down. I hate, I hate going to a restaurant with sticky tables. (Read TR's Old reviews) I understand that this was not a clean problem but a lacquer choice problem. The daily specials seemed nice, and being Monday, Mmmmm Pulled Pork, we had to have it. Again I did mention confusing! Pulled Pork special with Cole Slaw, cornbread muffin and two sides, $8.95. But make it a sandwich for just $6.95 (you don't get that cornbread muffin, and the two sides). You have to order them separately $1 per side. The menu didn't explain anything beyond, Make it a Sandwich, $6.95. Very confusing!

Tedious, and to boot when I asked for water the waiter brought over three new glasses of water for the three of us seated, but my friend hadn't gotten to half empty so the waiter took the third glass away rather than leaving it for later.

As it is, the boy and I stopped in here on a whim for dinner on Saturday night, and it really didn't do anything for either of us. As far as service goes, we had the same experience it looks like a lot of other people have had. Our waitress came over once RIGHT after we sat down and asked if we were ready (even though we were obviously still looking at the menus); when we said we needed another minute, she gave us about fifteen. As if we had personally offended her by not being ready to order within five seconds of sitting down and opening our menus. And it's not as if she had anything else to do - we were literally one of five tables in the entire restaurant, and there was just about one waiter/waitress for each table at that point. She was pleasant enough, but the rest of the night was the same story (all the food took forever to come out; we had to wait what seemed like years to get the check). And after all that, the food was really just so-so. The corn cake we ordered to start was decent, but sort of soggy in the middle, and it had shrimp on it (which we were charged for) even though we ordered it plain. My blackened catfish was nothing to write home about, and Steve's crab cakes were really uninspiring. Everything just tasted like it had been coated with a thin layer of ""blah."" Not gross, but not good either. I had been especially looking forward to the sides, but the mashed sweet potatoes were just okay, and the grits were pretty gross. I didn't grow up in the South, but I did learn to love grits in the South, and these were really not grits that I could bring myself to love. Oh, but Steve's green beans were really, really, SUPER good. I considered adding a 3rd star for the green beans alone, but that seems overkill.

2007-03-21,5.0,Wishbone is my favorite place to take vegetarian & vegan friends. They have a great selection on their menu as well as clearly marking their vegetable dishes if they are non vegetarian right on their menu. It makes things so much easier since you don't have to guess or rely on the server to know. Most of the time I end up eating vegetarian dishes. They do have something for everyone on their menu.  I love the crab dishes. Their side dishes are always fabulous! I love the cole slaw and the sauteed spinach.  I always try to save room for dessert. Their ever changing dessert menu is ALWAYS good.  The quality is always consistent and the service has always been good.

2006-09-27,2.0,"It was a Friday night and I was hanging out with some friends when someone decided they had a craving for fried chicken.  We're all dressed up, ready to hit the bars, so I suggest stopping off at Wishbone rather than hitting up the drive-thru at Popeye's.   I'd been to Wishbone a couple of times for breakfast (and I enjoyed it, even though I thought the service left a little to be desired), so I figured that it would be a safe bet for dinner.  How wrong I was! So we get there and we're seated.  And then we waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  After 20 minutes, our waitress finally made her way over.   Her english was REALLY poor (why you would hire someone with poor english to be a waitress is beyond me), but we managed to order a round of drinks.   We settled in and started deciding what to order, only to discover that Wishbone doesn't have fried chicken on the menu!  How a southern restaurant only has fried chicken for an occasional special is mind-boggling.  Seriously.  We then asked if they could make us some, but the answer was no.  How's that for fabulous customer service?  Like it's so difficult to make fried chicken or something.  (At this point we were seriously reconsidering our decision not to go to Popeye's.) I ended up with some bland chicken potpie and overly salty mashed potatoes.  I can't recall what everyone else ordered, though I do remember they were as underwhelmed as I was.  Our waitress stopped by a minute after our entrees arrived (reeking of cigarette smoke, which was beyond disgusting), so we were able to order another round of drinks (which took a ridiculously long time to arrive).  We downed those in about 10 minutes and wanted to order another round, but our attempts to flag our waitress down were unsuccessful.  Which is really too bad for her; more drinks means a bigger tab which equals a bigger tip. At this point, I was annoyed, especially since I had to get up and walk over to her and ask if we could FINALLY get the check.  (Which she didn't bing over for another 20 minutes or so.)  Before bringing my friends here, I had a reputation for always picking the best restaurants for Friday night get-togethers.  Now my friends are all like, ""This isn't another Wishbone, is it?""

Reading some of the other comments on here, it looks like people had mixed reviews about their food. All I can say is the restaurant should focus on promoting its breakfast because it's delicious. The first time I went, I had the banana pancakes and some home fries, which were a perfect combo. The pancakes are plate-sized and were maybe a 7.5 on my 1-10 flapjack scale (patent pending). My buddy loved the biscuits and gravy, as well as the crunchy French toast. In fact, he couldn't stop talking about the damn French toast, so I had to order it the next day when we went back. Wow! What they do is dip the stuff in a sea of magical batter made with a lot of love and some Corn Flakes, which make all the difference in the world. It was amazing! In fact, I can't get it out of my head and have even thought about trying to make my own batch at home, which I know would rank high up there in my lifetime disaster department, much like the time I tried to make a homemade chocolate cake or spent $50 preparing for a date with a girl who ended up blowing me off.
