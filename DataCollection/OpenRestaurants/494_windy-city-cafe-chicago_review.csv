This is probably my most frequented restaurant in the city.  I have about 25 check ins...and that's not including the times I was just too hungover to deal with Yelp.  I used to LOVE, I mean love their omelettes and the overall vibe.  I was so excited for them to get their liquor license and now I feel like a deflated balloon after a shitty New Year's Eve party.   Been here twice since the change.   1.  The menu has changed...more trendy and upscale.  Of course, more expensive, which I can totally understand.  It just kind of lost its luster for me.  I feel like it's a teenage girl playing dress up...and failing miserably.   2.  ""Housemade"" Bloody Mary...I was salivating as I ordered it and when I received it, I wanted to throw a tantrum like a 2 year old...it wasn't good.  All of my hopes and dreams that this could be my all around breakfast place quickly faded away as I barely could sip the less than average BM.  So sad.  Sniffle.  I even left half of it on the table. 3.  Where's all the old staff??  There's only like half the people that used to work here...all of the fantastic servers and hosts, etc...????  Where'd you go???? 4.  Can you say...ssslllllllllooooooooooww.  Both times it was AWFUL.  We were sat immediately but the drink order took a good 10 mins.  I could understand if it was all booze but the second time we only had an OJ and a coffee.  The first time I was the only one that ordered anything to drink.  We even beat the morning rush and arrived before 9a.  The food seemed to take forever and the overall vibe has changed.  I just cannot put my finger on it. 5.  At 9a with less than half of the restaurant filled on a Sunday, they were blasting metal music.  We are sitting right under the speaker and mid way through breakfast, asked if they could turn it down a notch.  Server said yes, but I'm pretty sure she forgot because I struggled to hear my mom who was sitting right across from me for the rest of the meal. Ugh, I am dumbfounded by what in the heck happened during the change over!   Even my Malibu omelette didn't seem to taste the same as the old fluffy, heavenly omelettes they used to serve.  Alas, WCC seems just like any old bfast place now.  I guess I'm back on the hunt for somewhere to love.",0.9496,0.81,0.113,0.078,0.5036583694083693

I have ridden my bike past it previously and was definitely intrigued by the classy old style diner exterior so that is what I selected for breakfast when I was looking for a low key meal. When we arrived around 11 a.m. we were quoted a 20 minute wait. Given the heat outside (we walked), we accepted it but were not looking forward to the wait. Lo and behold, the wait was approximately 5 minutes. The line ahead of us moved rather fast. My wife ordered the brioche french toast and I had the chicken fried steak with eggs, potatoes and rye toast that was a special. My wife is a french toast expert, so she definitely has a discerning palate when it comes to that dish. And Windy City Cafe's french toast stood the challenge. While she said it was not quite as good as the Breakfast Club's french toast, it was certainly delicious. My chicken fried steak was great as well. Service was quick and prompt. I was charged for an apple cider - which is what I ordered - when in actuality they brought an apple juice - which was totally fine. They were happy to make the change and gave me zero attitude. I will definitely be back to the Windy City Cafe in the future. It is nice it is a bit of a walk as it makes one work it off as they say.

2016-06-12,2.0,"Was looking forward to coming here. Arrived 20 mins to closing time & were welcomed none the less, caveat being that grill items are not available due to the hour. We wanted donuts anyway so no problem. I saw 2 donuts and asked if they were within the acceptable realms of freshness - we were assured that they were. Deal. It was over $6 for 2 so I expected a lot. Unfortunately they were terrible. Dry and stale with a cloying texture. We had to spread several tubs of the complimentary jam on the donut just to get it down. Here's the problem: at the price it was an unfair deal. Or it was gluten free which would explain the texture and price. Would have been nice to be informed though. I think it's always a good idea to offer discounts in the last hour before closing. As a result I would probably not go back in a hurry. I just don't trust them. Nor can I recommend eating there.",0.0545,0.769,0.119,0.112,0.505718954248366

Our 1st experience with Windy City was noteworthy. Our server, Mujju was informative and attentive. The food quality was superior to other cafes/diners. I told our waiter I had to pay for parking on the street, cause the Cafe is located on one of those weird 6 corners of Chicago. He informed us that parking parallel to the diner was allowed and free and they had a private lot in the back. Good tip! This past weekend, we had the opportunity to dine at Windy City for a 2nd time....yeah! Parked in their private free lot... yeah, again! This time we arrived at the height of Sunday Brunch, 12/noon. Not to panic, the Host was like a orchestra conductor. He took names, watched when guests would leave, so he could clear the table(s) for the next guests, processed payments, and basically pitched in where help was needed. Gotta say, when you have a line of hungry guests at your door, I appreciate the extra effort a Host helps his team. Our waiter, Ross H. was awesome! Friendly, attentive and a sense of humor.

She had the Edgar's skillet which is packed full of meat and cheese. I stole a few bites and was jealous that I didn't pick it as my meal. I had the omelet that was on special that day (forgot the name, sorry). It had avocados, spinach, cheese and applewood smoked bacon. Needed a pinch of salt but was extremely tasty with fresh ingredients. It comes with potatoes and a side of toast but I passed on the toast since mom and I decided to split a half order or french toast. The french toast was easily the highlight of the meal. You don't need too much syrup, they were moist and SO flavorful. I enjoyed every bite. The half order comes with two slices cut into four and it was more than enough for my mom and me to split with our entrees. The service was good, our server was very friendly and he was wearing a hilarious Christmas sweater that said ""All I want for Christmas is Beyonce"".

Our plates were brought out at intervals. Mine first, my daughters second and my significant others was last- each seperated by several minutes.

We were in great moods and laughing when we came in, so I can't say that I thought there was any rude exchange here.

He actually left our table to go check? But even that didn't seem too awkward at the time, just funny.

She explained the manager and the bus boy was trying to get out all the orders. I asked for more coffee and the second cup was cold.

The omelet was huge and the ""short stack"" of pancakes could have been a meal in itself. The two pancakes that were part of the short stack were huge. Needless to say, as hard as I tried, I was unable to finish the entire meal.  The omelet was very good, as were the shredded potatoes. The pancakes were fantastic. They had a great buttermilk flavor that was enhanced with the maple syrup. These were definitely some of the best pancakes I have ever eaten.

I was in the neighborhood visiting a friend, we decided we wanted brunch on a Monday.  Saw this place on yelp, and liked what I saw when I glanced at menu and reviews so we decided to give it a try. Modern but comfortable and relaxed interior.  Simple, but nice to look at.  Creative menu-board up front. Server was nice, attentive, cute personality.  Never had an empty glass, didn't even have to ask for my hot sauce.  Nicely done. Menu was surprising for the size of this place.  Lots of choices, but its not JUST quantity, it's quality too!  Even a red-velvet french toast made out of their red-velvet doughnuts!  Creative choices all around. The food I ordered, Corned Beef Hash Benedict, was great!  Perfectly portioned, amazing price.  My only critique would be the hollandaise sauce.  Not surprising as I'm VERY picky about my hollandaise.  It has to be a PERFECT balance of the butter and lemon flavors.  Many places tend to lean too far in one direction or the other.  In this case, it was just a tad too far on the lemon side, but still good enough for me to eat. I checked in on Yelp when I was there, and they gave me a free red velvet doughnut!  It was AMAZING!

And the burger was really good. I love their fries.  The service here is really nice and friendly. They make you feel at home. So kudos to the boss for hiring them.

I personally have other favorite breakfast/lunch venues of my own, however he seemed to really like this place so I am giving it a great review from his ""steak and potatoes man"" perspective.  He had the linebacker omelet with cheese and sausage, bacon, pecan waffles, and a side of fruit and toast (my boo likes to eat lol)  I had the The Spartan omelet with egg white spinach and feta, wheat toast, and hash browns. All the food was yummy, but the omelets were a little much. Just way too much egg for me. I know it said 3 but there had to be like 6 in there for sure. I probably got through 1/4 of it. Simple menu, good portions, reasonably priced. My only complaint was there was really no parking. Most of the surrounding blocks are permit so we had to park a few blocks down and cut through an alley. Considering it's a Wednesday afternoon I can only imagine what it's like on a Saturday.

2009-05-10,3.0,"I wanted a down-to-earth place for breakfast with my mother and grandmother when I picked them up from Union Station on Saturday morning.  This place fit the bill perfectly, and it wasn't even busy at 9:30am. They serve dinery sort of food with atmosphere a cut above a greasy spoon.  Service was very, very friendly and old-fashioned.  Big points for that.  Also, prices were very fair, bordering on cheap.  Think frittatas and breakfast skillets for about $7 and simpler dishes for a buck or two less. Food was fine.  My chicken fajita skillet was bland but generously portioned.  My mother and grandmother enjoyed their selections, although my mom said that her potatoes were cold.",0.9371,0.837,0.15,0.013,0.5928571428571429
2009-05-05,4.0,"Let's be honest with each other, Windy City Cafe.  A prince of a cafe, you are not.  But you're reliable, you're friendly, and you're cheap.  A great standby date.  Plus, this morning you treated us to a semi artery-clogging food coma. What happens when your roommate falls in love and strands you for the wilds of Uptown and her boyfriend's hood?  Roommate date nights fall by the wayside.  This morning, she took me out to make up for ignoring me in favor of her man (not that I'm jealous, but I do miss my roomie!).  We hopped on the new dating trend, or so the European versions of Glamour tell me.   We met  for breakfast. At 8am on a Tuesday morning, this place was almost deserted (unlike the weekends).  Our waiter was warm and friendly.  He even asked about our friends, who usually join us at the Cafe for brunch.  Without asking for it, he brought us our coffee and a plate of toast so that we could munch a little while reviewing the menu. We're not adventurous here, but then again, neither is the kitchen.  Nevertheless, the food is always served hot, portions are generous without overdoing it, and the taste does not disappoint.  I opted for the #2 special, made up of juice,  two buttermilk pancakes, my choice of two eggs (scrambled, please!) and either some bacon or some sausage.  My roommate got a cheese and sausage omelet.  This place knows how to do eggs.  My scramble was light and fluffy.  Yummy! Windy City Cafe left us feeling satisfied. Our tummies were full of sustenance and we promised each other to visit again soon.",0.9933,0.796,0.177,0.027,0.5216351829988194

Food was typical fare, but they did it well.  Good portion sizes, selection, and even the cheesy dishes aren't too greasy.  We'll be back :)",0.8934,0.821,0.143,0.036,0.5454545454545454
2008-06-23,2.0,"Wife and I have been here twice since we moved to the neighborhood. The question when we left this past Saturday was ""why did we go back?"" This is a completely average diner with average food and average service. This last time I ordered an omelet and a bowl of fresh fruit. The ""fresh"" fruit included peaches from a can, some cantelope, and half a banana. This is all they can get that's in season?!?! My wife ordered french toast with ""fresh"" strawberries. The french toast were very dry and seemed like they had been sitting out a while and the ""fresh"" strawberries were the overly sweet kind that comes from a can of pie filling. The worst part for me though, and probably the #1 reason I won't go back is that the first cup of coffee was lukewarm and the second was the same.
