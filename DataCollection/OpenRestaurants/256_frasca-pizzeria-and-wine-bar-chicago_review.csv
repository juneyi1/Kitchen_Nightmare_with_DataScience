2017-08-28,2.0,"Updated review (previous review was 5/5) - used to love this place, but over the last year they have reduced their menu, getting rid of some of my favorite dishes, have gotten rid of their Thurs wine flights, and have seemed to back away from their emphasis on what I thought made this place great - the wine and awesome food (they even used to have a  sommelier on staff!).  Now I feel Frasca is your typical Italian place, albeit with very nice outdoor seating, where you can get a portioned dish of pasta for $20.   Old review - Great place.  The food is really good, but what I like most is their wine selection.  They have all different kinds of really good wines that are for the most part reasonably priced - particularly if nab one of their specials during the week.  Pretty sure they have a sommelier on staff too... Pizzas are solid and all the pastas I have had were excellent.  They also have a really nice outdoor eating area.  The burrata salad is out of this world and the skillet cookie is equally as fantastic - highly recommended restaurant.",0.997,0.714,0.286,0.0,0.5844444444444444

I ordered a coke and coffee and breakfast pizza, my brunch companion ordered french toast and bloody marys. This wasnt my first time having breakfast pizza, i was pretty excited as i have yet to find it in the burbs, its a city breakfast treat for me. I ordered the eggs scrambled, it came with sausage and pieces of bacon. I also ordered a side of hollandaise sauce and prosciutto. The pizza dough was on the thicker side, i enjoyed my pizza but i like a thinner crust pizza.  I tried the french toast and that was so good! It was made on french bread it tasted buttery yet sweet it was the perfect amount of sweet. The bread was thick and soft, i would order this if i ever returned.

2017-07-12,2.0,"Frasca was cute and pretty empty on this Tuesday night. They also offer 1/2 off wine glasses on Tuesdays.  This place has potential but I'm not sure what happened last night... it was not good. We waited at the front for a bit for them to seat us even though it was completely empty inside. When we were seated the server disappeared for awhile so we rushed to order drinks and apps. I ordered a sangria because the server said it was great and not too sweet only to find it was pure sugar and had to wait for it to water down because she came back every 20 minutes. I loveeeeee brussel sprouts so we ordered the roasted brussel sprouts and cauliflower, when we got it the Brussels were hard and not cooked/roasted enough and the dish was over run by onions (which weren't even on the list of ingredients). So that was a complete disappointment. There weren't even times to complain because she would leave for 20 minutes at a time and we'd only see her in the distance. We then ordered the Wrightwood salad and pepperoni pizza. The pizza was SO good! The salad on the other hand was okay. Dressing was a citrus-y vinaigrette that was too sweet. And they had chicken deli meat slices... what? No thanks.  Probably would come back solely for the pizza, maybe order it to go though.",-0.8718,0.794,0.077,0.129,0.5715811965811965
2017-07-09,3.0,"Been in the area for almost a year, and frequently pass by walking to the gym, and around the neighborhood.  My boyfriend and I have always talked about going to Frasca, and always wound up going somewhere else.  The place is packed, and everyone appears to be having a good time.  The decor screams traditional italian, which made me think positively about my choice. We arrived, and preferred outdoor seating.  They have these tables along the outer wall of the restaurant, with planted flowers.  Be careful when you stand up, as the heavy open windows are right above your head if you're not careful.  I did not hit my head, but the woman who seated me said, ""I'm sorry, I dont understand why they would put tables right below these window.""  That immediately told me that they've had problems.  Also, there were a lot of fruit flies in the flower beds.  I'd recommend they pitch the flowers and dirt. Looking at other customers tables, I saw a lot of salad entrees, and even saw more salads brought to tables.  I was perplexed.  It's an italian restaurant.  Where are the pizzas, and pasta dishes?  It concerned me because who goes to a restaurant that screams italian and only orders salad? Their menu is shockingly limited for an italian restaurant.  Maybe 5-7 pasta dishes.  Their pizzas are plentiful with a build your own option.  their toppings are authentic, but expensive add ons so be careful.  Three salad options, and the majority of their menu appeared to be their al a carte appetizers; meats, cheeses, and bruschettas.  We decided against appetizers as they were priced close to the entrees. The service started out questionable, unfriendly, and without personailty.  My boyfriend made a comment out loud not realizing our waiter was right next to him, and from there the service improved.  We started with bruschetta; They skimped us on the mozzarella for the traditional, but was loaded with tomatoes.  The panchetta, had one piece with a ton of arugula and a couple of tomatoes.  Very expensive for the actual ingredients used (high margins).  The bread was fantastic. We decided on pizza, because the pasta dishes didnt speak to me and I was flabbergasted by lack of pasta dish choices.  I ordered the soprano, a four meat spicy pizza.  Eating it was fine, but after the sodium and meat caught up with me.  It is heavy so take your time with it.  My boyfriend ordered the Rustic, which I recommend.  It was packed with flavors that meshed well together. Personally, they're a little pricey, and I'd like to see more pasta on the menu, and less al a carte and appetizers.  It reminded me of my roots of the north shore with their clientele.  Not a place I love or would return to residually.  So far 0-2 for restaurants on Lincoln, Roscoe, and Paulina.",0.8912,0.865,0.077,0.058,0.5532647907647907

Once known for good pastas, now they serve too chewy rigatoni with bland sauce and unappealing sausage. How hard is it to cook it al dente?

We were checked on, but not an insanely annoying amount.  The spinach artichoke appetizer was delicious. It wasn't the typical spinach artichoke dip and it had a little spice to it, but not overpowering. I was able to get salmon on my Cesar salad for an extra $7.

The omelettes are all amazing and you can't go wrong with their mimosas :) They used to have $15 bottomless mimosas, but alas, that deal is long gone. :( Their pizzas are good, but not amazing; there are better wood stove pizzas out there in Chicago. Their crust is absolutely amazing, but the pizza itself is just decent. The funghi pizza is probably my favorite and has excellent flavor. I have had the cauliflower/brussel sprout salad and it was good, but as brussel spouts can be, were oversalted.  Frasca always has excellent weekday specials and service is good.

(intersection of Paulina & Roscoe).  Super walk-able if you live in the neighborhood or a pretty easy commute.... looks like plenty of street parking in the surrounding area too.   Wood-fired pizza, a plentiful selection of pastas, and salads make this spot pretty tasty in my book.  There's a great outdoor seating on either side of the restaurant that lets folks park strollers or enjoy dinner with their furry friends outdoors. The staff is super nice and accommodating.  Our server was excellent.  Very kid-friendly place... May have been the early hour of dinner that we went, but it seemed like all the tables surrounding us had highchairs.  There's a bar in the center and plenty of tables that can be configured/moved to accommodate large parties (just plan accordingly since this place can get pretty crowded at peak times). My family ordered two pizzas and two pasta dishes and we shared everything.  Still had a ton left since we ordered a cauliflower appetizer and indulged in the bread basket.  The leftover pizza was great a couple days later.

When I went the first time, I ordered pasta (I believe it was ravioli) and while it was tasty, I left hungry.  A heftier portion would have been a little more preferred for the price.  When I went the second time, it was 1/2 off Pizzas on Wednesday.  Let me tell you, it was phenomenal.  The Soprano pizza was very, very good.  It had various types of sausage and pepperoni and had the perfect amount of spice to it.  One of the better pizzas I've had in quite some time!! We stood by the bar waiting for the table.  The bartender was nice enough to give us a heads up that someone on the other side was leaving, so we walked over and waited for them to leave.  Overall, the service was prompt.  Ten minutes after placing our order, the bartender came back and asked what pizza I ordered again, so she had forgot to place my order.  She felt bad and gave me a beer on the house, so while I was bummed for the delay, it was an honest mistake and she made up for it.

Heaven on earth those polenta fries were SO GOOD. I'm a fan of polenta anything so it's not too hard to please me but I loved the crispy outside and smooth hot inside with the zing of the lemony dipping sauce. Oh so good. The meatballs were okay, but they were served cold which obviously wasn't the best.  Next we split 2 pizzas between the three of us -- the pepperoni and the rustica. I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food and my mouth was on FIRE with both of these somehow. The pepperoni does have a spicy soppressata on it, so that makes sense...I'm not sure what it was about the rustica that had my mouth still burning. Maybe it was still from the pepperoni.

Zero flavor ..acidic and sour from not being cooked down.    In the end, my son ordered a root beer float.  How can you mess up a root beer float.right? $4 later..

There were 3 of us waiting, since our other 2 friends had yet to arrive. We were told when we got in that it will just be a moment, and that we should go to the bar to grab a drink. We went to the bar, got glasses of wine and waiting around 20 minutes. At around 7:20/7:25p we go back up to hostess table, and ask how much longer the wait will be. The male (longer hair, in a bun, believe his name was Timothy) and woman (dark wavy hair) working asked if there were three of us waiting, we confirmed this, then they followed up and told us they were waiting for other people to get up from their table, and our wait should not be much longer. 20 more minutes pass and its almost 7:45p, we proceed to go up to the hostess table again to ask what is taking so long, when we had reservations at 7:00p. It was Timothy and the other woman who told us still that it won't be much longer, they apologize, and say they are now just waiting for our table to be cleared off. When 8:00p rolls around, we are at this point, livid. I go up to the hostess stand for a third time, and hour after our reservation, and the woman proceeds to say ""oh well..... we were waiting for the rest of your group to arrive"". I just about blew up- for one, you need to communicate to your customers if that is the reason we have been waiting over an hour for our table. That should have been vocalized that from the moment we got there. We had to go up to them 4 separate times and that was never communicated to us. We assumed we were waiting for people to finish eating, then to clean off our table... not that we were waiting for our other two guests (who were only here for a drink anyways). I've never experienced such poor customer service and awful communication from an establishment. The only reason I am giving two stars instead of one, is because of the extremely nice gentleman who finally sat us (over an hour after our reservation time), apologized and gave us complementary Polenta Fries.  I have been to plenty of restaurants where you have to have your entire party present before you can be seated. That is not the issue. The problem is that you need to vocalize that to your customers instead of making up excuses for an hour after their reservation, as to why you're not seating them.

2015-09-07,2.0,"Recently having moved to Roscoe Village, I was really excited for my fiance and I to try out new places to eat around the area. My advice: there are a lot of restaurants near Frasca where you'll get better food for a better price and BETTER SERVICE. We walked in (2 hours before closing, with 1/3 of the tables full, mind you) and stood at the front door for 10 minutes. The host was M.I.A. The first person to notice us in front of the host stand was a waitress who was sectioned outside. If she hadn't acknowledged us, who knows how long we'd have kept waiting. All of a sudden the host shows up! Miraculous! She asks us where we'd like to sit and gives us literally the WORST table in the restaurant. It's a little table located right next to the host stand. I literally felt like I had to lean forward every time a waitress came to ring up her tables, with the other side of the table literally stuffed in a corner. Not to mention, when you're seated right next to the register, you get to hear all of the staff's complaints about their customers and their bickering :):):) I'm sitting here wondering, there are SO many other tables that aren't located in this tiny cramped up spot and you give us this one? Fast forward to 15 minutes after we sit down. The bus boy brings us water. Fast forward to 10 more minutes. There's a gathering of 5 waitresses by the host stand and no one has asked us for our drink orders yet. They scatter, and one sweet blonde girl stops and asks us ""has anyone helped you yet?"" We asked if she'd be helping us and she says she doesn't know who our waitress is. Cool, great, awesome. She takes our orders and we wait for another 10 minutes for 2 glasses of wine. The food came out right after, which was nice. FINALLY our actual waitress stops by the table and asks us how the food/drinks are. I'm not entirely sure why we tipped the girl who ignored us for 45 minutes, or why we tipped her when she literally did nothing but ask us twice how the food was, but whatever. Essentially, the service sucks. We paid $16 for a tiny portion of 4 cheese ravioli. At least my fiance's pizza was okay. It's overpriced Italian food that you can really find anywhere. Not a terrible wine selection, but that was about the only positive thing about the experience. If you want to wait around for almost an hour in a restaurant that's not even busy, be my guest. Otherwise, walk down the street and try one of the many other restaurants in Roscoe Village.",0.8736,0.89,0.069,0.041,0.5147574123989218

Simply excellently delivered through and through.  My wife and I were hungry and as usual, didn't know where we would ultimately end up.  Driving down Lincoln avenue, my wife says very nonchalantly, as we pass by, Frasca. I pull over and Yelp it.  Almost 5 stars and a few(okay more than a few) reviews and we decide to give it a go.  Since the Air & Water show was going on, it was very quiet and low key.  Despite the humidity and heat today, we opted for the streetside outdoor seating.  After a refreshing sip of moscato for the wife and the""scurry"" on tap for myself, it was just a great Sunday afternoon to order up some food.  In particular, we had ordered the campari tomato watermelon salad and the prosciutto pizza to share.  The salad arrived first. It was a summer delight. The fresh mozzarella on top combined with the crispness of the watermelon cubes,tomato wedges, mixed greens and garnish of red onion hit all of my taste buds.  The pizza came out shortly and it was hot.  First thing I noticed was the mound of arugula on top of the prosciutto.  I grabbed a slice and topped it off with more arugula.  The saltiness of the prosciutto combined with the arugula on the light thin crust and cheese.  This was absolute perfection!  Needless to say, between the six slices there was nothing left after a matter of minutes. Update 1: ordered the spinaci pizza on Monday.  It was delectably delicious with the carmelized onions, bacon and cheese. Update 2: it's Friday (of the same week) and we ordered to go the buccatini with a side of beef meatballs and the potato bacon pizza. The pasta was al dents in the light tomato sauce.  It was such a delicious comfort food with the lightly seasoned beef meatballs!  The pizza was light and doughy with just enough bacon and potatoes to complement the pizza.  We can't say that we have a favorite pizza yet.  They have all surpassed our expectations.",0.9916,0.864,0.127,0.01,0.56703216374269

The service at the bar was spotty - we kind of had to fight to get the waitress's attention. They made up for it later when my friend decided she would try to send back a spinach pizza she had mildly destroyed. I was like, no way, you are not going to try to send that back! The waitress thought the same thing and gave her a huge ""WTF"" look when she explained she was planning on just eating the toppings and because they were stuck to the cheese that really was not working for her. She claims to be gluten free thus could not eat the crust. The waitress snatched the pizza away and left saying fine thereby agreeing to give her the other pizza she wanted instead for free. She then went over to her manager and spent a good five minutes (no doubt) explaining that my friend wanted to send the pizza back after eating half the toppings, while they both stared daggers back at my friend. I was mortified. I could not believe they did not just flat out refuse to sub out her pizza for another. But they brought back the other (aforementioned sausage) pizza she ordered about ten minutes later. I felt like apologizing when we left but did not.

I did notice that our server was helping out behind the bar but it looked as though we were her only table in the dining room so the slow service was a bit confusing. We had to flag someone else down for our check and then she never came over to say thanks or have a good night.  Overall we loved the place! We'd love to come back on a not so rainy night and try the patio. Just a fluke waitress.,0.9792,0.838,0.14,0.022,0.5606481481481481

It's always crowded but they have friendly service if you're willing to wait. Frasca is usually overrunning with kids but they have good weeknight specials on pizza and wine. There's a nice patio seating option when the weather permits.

Our server came quickly to go over drink specials and we ordered the 1/2 price wine by the glass. We then decided on a trio of bruschetta and 2 pizzas. The bruschetta was devine. The tomato mozzarella is a classic and the ricotta with honey was a sweet bite, however the real standout was the roasted beet bruschetta. Paired with fresh strawberries, ricotta and balsamic it was the clear winner.  After appetizers things started to go downhill. The food coming out of the kitchen was taking quite a bit of time. Normally I am lenient but seeing as we were one of 5-6 tables in the restaurant it was frustrating. Then we proceed to watch our pizzas sit in the window for almost 10 min. Multiple servers and bus boys walked past them and didn't deliver. I was just about to get up and get the pizzas myself when our server saw them and brought them to us.  The pizzas were ok. Very doughy for a supposed wood fired pizza. The special Brussel sprout pizza of the night was unfortunately pretty bland and the margarita pizza was tasty but nothing to write home about.  We were hoping to indulge in the skillet cookie we noticed on the menu earlier, but thoughts of long wait times deterred us from making the plunge.

Considering we had plenty of alcohol and each had our own entree, I was VERY impressed that the pre-tip bill was under $30!   The only minor dings I have were that my one friend asked for extra garlic and I had to run down our waitress because she didn't give me a glass of water while I was in the bathroom and she served everyone else. We had an early reservation (5:30) and there were a lot of young families, which is understandable. So, feel free to bring your kids if you've got them!  If it's a date night I would say definitely go later at night.

The ambience is comfortable, and as loud as should be expected at an informal restaurant (yes, loud). Service was perfect, and if this makes or breaks a meal then at Frasca it is a plus.

2014-09-13,4.0,"We love this place for brunch. It's one of our go-to spots. Dinner is also great. The only reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is because  a) there is one waitress who works there who is awful. We have had her several times, every time, awful. Now if we get her we move to the bar. and  b) the acoustics in the restaurant are weird. Today the music was WAY too loud where we were sitting (it was 10:00am, we just wanted to talk and could barely here each other. Yes I'm old). Other times we have sat on the south side of the room and the curved ceiling lets you hear conversations on the other side of the room. Or if there is a baby crying, like today, we heard it loud and clear and it seemed amplified. and  c) Years ago they gave you a small draft beer with the Bloody Mary's. Than they switched to the mini Miller high life bottles. YUCK. I never drink mine. I would much rather have the small mini draft. I've left comments on comment cards and emailed them to let them know, but oh well I think the mini drafts were better. The Bloody Mary's are very good though. All of this aside, we still come back time and time again. Their pizzas are amazing. The breakfast pizza with hollandaise sauce is out of this world. Very easy for two to share. Wood fired pizza crust loaded with cheese, bacon, sausage, sunny side up egg, than topped with prosciutto and hollandaise - YUM~!! The rosemary breakfast potatoes are like a yummy creamy casserole, awesome. If you go with the group, start with the fresh doughnuts. They are awesome! For dinner you can't go wrong with any pizza.

Young adults love it because it great for a date night and a fun spot to grab dinner or brunch with friends.  Casually classy and laid back, this lovely wine bar is a win win.

Some of my dinner favorites are the rigatoni, prosciutto pizza, any of the bruschetta's, the farmer's table menu, and my absolute fave - the Wrightwood salad. De-lish. Brunch is amaze-balls too. You absolutely have to get the donuts to start! My go-to is either the breakfast pizza or breakfast sandwich - both equally as good in my book. Then of course there's their bloody mare's which is the perfect way to get your Sunday started on the right foot. They use Smoke Daddy's bloody Mary mix which they also have available to purchase by the bottle for $5. The prosecco they use in their mimosas are spot on.  I highly suggest enjoying their outdoor patio space on a beautiful day - it's awesome!

Your server will give you a smaller menu called ""farmers table"" in which to order brushetta. (I specify that because we almost didn't notice it). Our table ordered a combo platter of brushetta to share: mushroom/truffle oil, melon/proscuitto, brie/apples, and white bean/olives.  The mushroom and truffle oil brushetta was to die for. Seriously it was everyone at the tables favorite of the night. The mushrooms were perfectly roasted, placed on top of pecorino which offered the right amount of buttery and salty flavors, with just a couple drops of truffle oil. The bread was appropriately crusty but not overly dry.  For us, the melon/proscuitto was a miss. It didn't offer enough of the sweet and salty balance in which it was striving for. The melon just over took the proscuitto and ricotta.",0.8701,0.865,0.1,0.034,0.5620748299319728

Our wine was great, my friends daughter ate for free, and our dessert cookie was better than any dessert I've ever had.

He was so attentive and kind, and made some really great suggestions( I wasn't going to drink until he started talking about wine.) the best part is how great he was with my friends daughter. He saw her crying while he was at another table and came straight over to see what was wrong. After making some silly faces and giving her a high five, she forgot that she was crying because she wanted an airplane coloring page instead of whatever she had.

Since it was a nice day, people were sitting outside. My party and I chose inside to avoid the wind. I was seated immediately despite my two friends not being present which was nice because I wanted a Bloody Mary. My server was super nice and allowed me to take my time with ordering especially since my friends took 40 minutes . . .  So first, I ordered the Bloody Mary with cucumber vodka, no meat and cheese. That was a tasty beverage! It was also served with a 7 oz Miller High Life - too cute! After my friends arrived we ordered food. Sadly there are no vegan options for traditional breakfast items but Frasca does offer some lunch options like pizzas, salads, sides, a few main dishes. I decided on the Campari and Watermelon salad. I was not disappointed! So many tomatoes and cubes of watermelon with fresh basil, arugula, olive oil and fresh lime! Yum!  I also ordered a side of potatoes but I think they were made with butter . . . They still tasted good! I'm hoping they were made with olive oil ;-) My friends ordered pancakes with bacon and they really enjoyed their food.

Lots of good things, but sometimes pretty bad... Don't bother with the chicken/salmon/filet medallion entrees. They always come out EXTREMELY salty. Worth the money for the amount of food, but there's a chef back there over-seasoning everything. We just had one of their seasonal salads--roasted brussels sprouts and cauliflower. This would have been so lovely, but again, it was incredibly over-seasoned. So much cheese, plus salt, plus bacon, plus capers. Yuck.  However, I will say I've had the pastas and pizzas, and I love them. Simple thin pizza with a chewy crust and usually fresh toppings. Just the right amount of cheese. My girlfriend is a big fan of the meatballs and spaghetti, though it looks like that's been removed from the menu recently (why?).  We also are a little obsessed with the fried egg sandwich, which is a chore to eat, but worth the mess. Love the rye bread. The omelettes are just okay. But the breakfast potatoes, if you're not counting calories, will keep you coming back to nurse your hangovers. They are creamy and herbed and thrown on a griddle before served.

Well no, technically I had gnocchi.  Hand-rolled sweet potato gnocchi with pancetta, apple, pearl onions, brussels sprouts, and sage.  Um, yes please.  It was warm and comforting, and a wonderful fall entree.  The apples added a very pleasant fruty taste, the pancetta a bit smoky, and the gnocchi were pillowy.  I'm sure it's even better sober!

I'd like to think this was Christopher's first day on the job, but I doubt it was.

It took him 25 minutes to come back to our table to take our orders, mind you, this place was not packed, at all. Instead he was walking around aimlessly with a coffee pot in his hand and started restocking glasses at the bar. When the food finally came, 1/2 the tables orders were wrong. Most of us ordered the Egg sandwiches w special requests like no tomato, cheese, etc, and every single one was wrong. The last person got their corrected dish after everyone was almost done eating. Took forever to get our bills as well. Luckily for him, he had added gratuity because we were a large group. SERVICE WAS AWFUL and no manager ever visited our table to check in on us, even though the food runner (manager?) was aware of the mistakes. Luckily for Frasca, their food is good.

They have a decent wine selection with good prices.  Their salads, pizzas and bruschettas are the best.  I would say skip the appetizers,  and stick to those three basics.  They seasonalize their menu which makes it nice for people like me that eat there all the time!  When it comes to dessert the classic skillet chocolate chip cookie with ice cream is a must try.  They do a nice job of adding new desserts in the mix that are also very tasty but the cookie is a staple. It's family friendly but also later in the night it weeds out to just grown ups.  If you live nearby and haven't been yet, it's a must!",0.9386,0.892,0.108,0.0,0.4625252525252525

My party arrived at 8:20ish to check in and was told by the host that they were waiting for 3 tables to get up so we may have to wait till 8:40. Ok well with no space in the bar area, we waiting outside. 8:40 came and went and we are still on the street.

But the food was nothing short of the best Italian food I've had in the 18 months I've lived here, so that in and of itself was the redeeming factor.   I chose Frasca based off of the excellent reviews on Yelp and the positive word of mouth I've heard as well. They also have great specials Monday - Wednesday for both wine and pizza. I took my parents, who prefer restaurants on the quieter side with an interesting but not ""out there"" menu and great wine. I wouldn't say Frasca was exactly quiet, but we've been in louder places, and it definitely delivered on the other two elements.  In any case, back to the first 5 minutes. We found it easily and there was no wait at 8 on a Thursday. With that said, the hostess seemed to be thinking, ""Really? Another table I have to seat?"" Which was not the welcome I had anticipated. We got to our table, but couldn't sit down until the busser was done awkwardly reaching in front of us to put the water on the table. Not sure why that couldn't have waited. And then it was about 10 minutes before we were approached by a waitress for our drink order. Luckily, the food and wine was so wonderful that it made me forget about that first part. I was wishing that my parents had been more hungry, because I really wanted to try the polenta fries and wrapped dates. I decided on the papperedelle bolongnese with some sort of Italian sausage; mom got the caprese salad; dad got the Tuscan sausage soup (special) and a Caesar salad. All excellent choices. I would highly recommend the Tuscan soup and the pasta dish; they were both full of flavor and something a little different than I see at most Italian restaurants. If you're not a garlic lover, beware of the papperedelle. It wasn't overwhelming until I took it out of the fridge the next day and that was the only thing I could smell. Along with dinner, we also had a really nice Pinot Noir - nice enough that my parents, who are not Pinot fans, enjoyed it as well. Unfortunately I can't remember the name.

Some of us split salads (they have the Wrightwood salad here that I love from Dunlay's- must be the same owners?) which they were very accomodating in doing, and pizzas.

My girlfriend and I could be accused of being creatures of habit, but when we find something that works we tend not to veer off course. At Frasca this means we always start with the Farmer's Table, basically their meat/cheese platter. You select 4 or 8 items and they come out on a rustic board. Each bruschetta option is great and you get two big pieces per order, but the mushroom and goat cheese option is the star. The meats and cheeses are always changing, but the servers seem to be up to date on them and are great with recommendations (beware: some cheeses are quite pungent). The board also comes with grapes, nuts, crackers and chutney/marmalade. We're always happy with the pizzas when we get them. The prosciutto with arugula is my favorite, but the margherita is also tasty. The atmosphere is bustling. We always sit in the front bar area at one of the booths. It's really nice in the summer when they open their windows up. The dining room falls into the trap of so many Chicago restaurants where you're closer to the person at the table next to you than your dinner companion. This is a pet peeve of mine so we never go back there. Other drawbacks: Panko-crusted calamari was subpar, not recommended. A bit over-priced for what it is if you don't get the wine deals. They have two TVs behind the bar, why? I love sports as much as anyone, but who goes to a wine bar to watch the White Sox game?

I took off a star for the time I visited with a friend who was 8 months pregnant.  Her doctor had told her that it is okay, in the 3rd trimester, to have a glass of wine on occasion.  She was in town visiting and we wanted to celebrate and she hadn't had a glass of wine in, oh, 8 months.  We ordered a bottle of something sparkling and asked for 3 glasses.  The waiter was very uncomfortable and did not want to give my pregnant friend a glass.  We eventually spoke to another waitress (or the manager), who was a woman, who apologized for the waiter's reluctance and gave us the glass.  At this point, however, my friend felt like she was being judged and was sort of pissed off.  I know that not everyone agrees about the glass of wine in the 3rd trimester situation, but it is not up to waitstaff to decide if a pregnant lady can have a glass of wine. The next star I took off is for brunch.  They actually have a nice brunch selection here, and I do love the Wrightwood salad, but the atmosphere is not great for people without kids.  Roscoe Village is a family neighborhood and Frasca is, astutely, very kid friendly, I get it. Were all of the kids poorly behaved or untended by their parents?  No.  Were there enough unruly children and oblivious parents to make it annoying?  Yes.  I like kids, I just prefer to eat my meals without them running around my table and grabbing at my purse and silverware.

Sundays are $3 drafts and they have a small but impressive draft list. Dangerous for Sundays.  Food was pretty sizable and delicious on top. Free warm bread with EVOO was a good start, especially while nursing a hangover. We ordered the panko crusted calamari as an app. Pretty good, decent flavor, but nothing memorable. The table next to us got a butchers platter from their farmers menu which is definitely the way to go. You can order a la carte or get a butchers platter of 4 or 8 things off their list of bruschetta, cheese, and cured meats. It looked damn good, I think they saw me eyeing it. The ladies were raving about their 'Infamous Wrightwood Salad' and described it as the 'best salad they'd ever eaten.' I am a straight dude, so did not get a salad. However, it was a pretty massive portion with shredded chicken, tomatoes, craisins, avocado, corn, goat cheese, fresh croutons. I would imagine if I were to ever order a salad (which I would never), then it would have to look like this (with maybe a steak on top).  I got the Capone Pizza. Large pizza that could easily be shared, but I ate it alone like a fat ass. Plus I was hungover. Big chunks of fennel sausage was a good touch, as was the roasted onions. I would say not worth the $12, but the portion alone made up for the cost and I'd probably rather eat this than a Dominoe's pizza.  This will definitely be my new spot in the West Lakeview/Roscoe Village area. Definitely gonna come back for their Wednesday buy one get one free pizza special.

2012-07-18,1.0,"I finally got to dine at Frasca after an aborted first attempt.  A few weeks prior we skipped out on eating here because an uncontrolled shrieking child could be heard throughout the dining room.  It was so bad you could hear it a block away as we walked to the competition.  On Monday, we gave them a second chance and I wish I just kept walking. The atmosphere in here is rather loud, music is blaring and the noise from your neighbors (elbow length away) is deafening.  Also, as part of the dining experience, since they have open air seating, is flies.  I understand you have to contend with the elements when you dine al fresco; but when I eat in the actual dining room, I shouldn't be constantly swatting away flies. We sat for about 10 minutes before someone took our drink order.  When the waiter did come, because it was so loud (keep in mind we weren't in the middle of an event - this was a normal Monday) we had to repeat ourselves 3x.  Drinks were never promptly refilled and we were left with empty glasses throughout the whole meal.  This wouldn't be so bad, except the food here is extremely salty. I had a pizza and it was unevenly cooked, one side was soggy, the other was blackened crisp.  This wouldn't be an issue as normally you'd tell the waiter and they'd fix it, except our waiter never checked in to see how the food was.  So I was stuck with an overpriced, poorly cooked $15+ personal pizza.  It took over 15 minutes to finally get a bill, at which point I just had my card waiting because I wanted to be done! I wouldn't classify Frasca as ""budget dining"", so I have come to expect a higher level of service, food quality and atmosphere that one can get from their competition.  Next time you are in the area, just keep walking, I wish I did.",-0.9089,0.915,0.025,0.06,0.44043209876543216

2012-03-11,4.0,"Went on a Saturday night so there was quite a wait. Clientele seemed to be all neighborhood types and it was pretty noisy to be sure. Atmosphere is nice though, candles on the tables and lights dim with good wood trim to give the place a comfortable vibe. Now on to the food: Starter bread was a nice warm half crusty loaf served with olive oil and freshly grated romano. We ordered a beet salad and the caesers to start. Both were sizable and tasty. While the caesers dressing was homemade, it missed the anchovy flavor a classic caeser dressing has, but it was good and creamy and fattening nonetheless. Then we both decided on ordering pizza. I got the capone which was sausage and roasted onions with a marinara sauce. The ingredients were fresh and plentiful. The crust was good, but I would say a level below some of the other wood fired ovens in the area like Spaconapoli. That said, it did hold up to all the ingredients and had a nice char on the edges so complements to the kitchen for not under baking. Service was attentive and friendly even though they were clearly quite busy. We sat at the bar when we checked in with the hostess who told us our wait time had doubled from her original estimate.   All in all a really nice upscale pizza evening out.",0.9876,0.792,0.177,0.031,0.6422979797979799

The Capone pizza is amazing as well, but in my book their best dish the Wrightwood Salad. It's always fresh, the chicken is always perfect (nothing ruins a dish like a bad piece of chicken) and the salad dressing is a treat.

We went last night and started with the Risotto fritters and the Veal Marinara Meatballs.  Both were prepared almost perfectly and showcased the balance between the savory sage and the tomato-y tang of the sauce.  My wife ordered the Chicken Saltimboca and I ordered the Filet Medallions with the Potato Gnocchi and Mushrooms.  A good call all around, although I liked the Chicken better than the Filet. The two things that I didn't love:  they assess a $20 corkage fee, which is a bit steep, even by Napa standards.  In addition, for reasons that escape facile explanation, they saw fit to blast Top-40 music over the noise of the crowded establishment, which made conversation a challenge, as I was seated directly underneath a speaker, which hung over my head like the proverbial Sword of Damocles.   We're excited to try their pizza special on Wed. night.  I would say that this is a step down from Francesca's but it offers good value and good service.  We'll be back before too long.",0.9798,0.826,0.165,0.009,0.4361973775017254

We started with a couple special wine flights that they featured for Valentine's Day-I tried the Rose flight and my fiancee had the Classy Reds (or something along those lines).  All the wines we tried were great.  Their appetizers and Farmers Table offerings sounded so good that we decided to forgo entrees and just share a few things-we ordered the Italian Sushi that was on special-tuna and vegetables wrapped in rice that was wrapped in prosciutto with a horseradish sauce underneath...this was soooooo good!  The horseradish took the place of the wasabi and it was perfect-also a very large portion. From the Farmers Table menu we ordered 3 types of Bruschetta-mozzerella/basil/tomato, mushroom/goat cheese/truffle oil, and goat cheese/roasted pepper.  These were all awesome!  The bread was warm and crunchy and the topping were all fresh and super tasty.  We also got the Hot Coppa Salami-little kick of heat, very good. To finish off our meal we ordered the Nutella Pie.  This slice is huge, definitely recommend sharing.  The nutella filling was fluffy and rich and the crust was really good-not too sweet, a little crumbly-just how I like it!

One negative that I can see popping up on occasion - the entryway can get a bit crowded if a group is waiting for a table and the spacing between the tables on one side of the place is very tight.

All the food is recommended, but the ""create your own"" antipasto platter, or as they call it ""Old World Farmers Plate"", is AWESOME!  I have to agree with Al D. regarding the pizza, not the best in the city:  yelp.com/biz/frasca-chic… .  The circulating Chef's Selection of the Week cheese is always a pleaser.  After all, they do have the fabulous and Chicago's one and only fromager bring in the fresh cheeses for the chef to choose from and serve.  The platter comes in small (perfect for two or three; $15) or grande ($26) sizes with your choice of 4 or 8 items including bruschettas, cheeses, cured meats or house marinated olives.  I can't help myself and usually go with the chef's weekly cheese, the Delice de Bourgonge triple cream cow's milk (perfectly rich 'n creamy), the hand-dipped ricotta with pistachio and honey bruschetta (honey and ricotta, perfect combo), and a third random cheese selection based on my tastes buds that day.  Even better, the cheeses come with thin crackers, homemade jam, grapes and some nuts! My favorite appetizer, which I sometimes make a meal, are the Wild Mushroom Risotto Fritters!  Perfectly and slightly fried on the outside, but mushy and warm on the inside.  Dunk one in their reggiano creama and you're in for a ride to heaven.  On another note, I'd skip the Gnocchi all together because it is the worst I've ever come across (gnocchi shouldn't be sticky and mushy, sorry).  Go with the Spaghetti Pomodoro instead, it pairs perfectly with the complimentary, homemade bread and the spiced oil.  Finish off your meal with their Iron Skillet Cookie that is deliciously doughy!

2011-07-01,5.0,"Frasca is my go-to local restaurant. The ambiance, service, and food are always outstanding. This is a rare restaurant where I'm happy to be seated anywhere. The room is open and inviting around a central bar, and the long walls of windows in front offer great people-watching every time the brown line rumbles by. Someone has also paid thoughtful mind to the music. With selections from the likes of My Morning Jacket, the Strokes, and Radiohead, the musical backdrop is always modern and fun without being distracting or overly hip. From the farmer's table,  the brie + apples bruschetta and the mushroom + goat cheese + truffle oil bruschetta are delicious. For apps, the calamari is a crowd-pleaser, and I enjoy the crispy, mild mushroom fritters.  You can't go wrong with any of the pizzas, but the prosciutto pizza seems to be a universal favorite and my default order is the caponata. The pastas and entrees change seasonally to incorporate fresh ingredients, but the main components of the dishes stay the same -- this keeps the menu both fresh and familiar. Brunch is also excellent. Their rich style of side potatoes is creamy and crispy at the same time. Their weeknight deals are deals indeed and the neighborhood really comes out to take advantage of them: half off bottles of wine, buy one get one pizzas. If going on a weeknight, I suggest checking what the day's deal is and making a reservation -- it gets packed! The only thing I can complain about is wanting more. The atmosphere reminds me very much of wine bars in New York that stay busy late into the night. After the earlybird crowds of families and the regular-hours dining crowds start to abate, I would love to see Frasca fill with a later-night crowd of wine drinkers so that I could stay there all night. If located in a more central and bustling neighborhood, I could see this happening easily. But instead, I'm just left wishing that other high quality establishments would set up shop in the available spaces on Frasca's same intersection, turning Roscoe/Lincoln/Paulina into a hopping nightspot where I can sip wine and forget that I'm not in Greenwich Village.",0.9927,0.843,0.143,0.014,0.47704369274136715

The service was just so-so. They were very busy and we practically had to beg to order food hence why I gave Frasca four stars, otherwise it would have gotten five. We weren't in any hurry so it didn't bother me too much. The atmosphere was nice and not too loud. The crowd was young, but mature -- if that makes sense. This would be a great place for a casual date or to come with a group of friends. We ordered a Primavera Pizza (tomato sauce, asparagus, red onion, artichoke and lemon ricotta cheese) and a Caponata Pizza (tomato sauce, eggplant, goat cheese, red peppers, mushrooms and artichokes).

We probably go there every three or four weeks and I still haven't written about this place that we find ourselves going to. Not that anyone is losing sleep, but about time I wrote hey! Usually we get either the Pizza, or the crostini and pasta. The pizzas are really good (recommend the potato pizza among others) - crust is thin but really has the flavor of the wood oven. Sometimes if the crust is too thick you just don't get the right level of crispness, but usually here they have it down and they are consistently good. The breakfast pizza is also good overall. The crostini is another favourite - they are quite tasty and there is a good variety overall. The white bean/balsamic is on par to what I make at home - I like the smoked salmon a lot, but even the simple ones like apple and brie are quite tasty, and they are always served on nice crispy bread. Entree's are also good - we used to get the parpadelle but now there is the gnocchi which is a bit of a treat. I wish there were a couple more pasta options as sometimes four is not enought to choose from, and the range of entree's is a little narrow at times. That said, the food is pretty consistent overall. Sunday's have the $3 beers, which is very important and is a real draw card. Beer range is quite reasonable too.  The staff are also friendly and know the menu and wines pretty well.

Wednesdays is buy one pizza, get one pizza free. I believe they also have a Sangria special. In any case, check their website before you go and see which special suits you best. I typically stick to the margherita pizzas, although they do have quite the selection. There are only two choices that are veggie though, out of about 10, so not a huge selection for you non meat eaters. The margherita pizza is just OK, nothing really spectacular, and I feel like the dough is missing salt or something; it's just sort of blah.  They also have a nice selection of salads and some other meat and pasta dishes to choose from in case pizza isn't your scene.

2011-03-09,2.0,"My experience seems to mirror some others hinting at a lack of good management here, which is sad. The day I went to Frasca (the first and last time), it was busy but not packed for Sunday brunch. Our waiter took about 10 min. to even tell us he'd be back soon. He said they were short-staffed that day. 45 min. after being seated, we finally got our food, which was cold and incorrect. They served all our food with fruit, despite all of us ordering it with potatoes. When we finally caught the waiter, he said that yea, they were out of potatoes, and said they'd bring some bacon to make it up to us. Why not tell when we ordered, or before it came out, or when they were serving it? Did they hope we wouldn't notice? My omelet (Lincon Omelet) was tiny and looked like it would give me food poisoning immediately: besides being ice cold, it was brown and tasted weird. They replaced it with an equally bad-looking one but it was at least warm. The toast they served was also, somehow, gross, with bits of raw egg yolk spilled on the bottom sides of the toast. So, since I don't like fruit, I spent $17 in all on a tiny, disgusting, omelet. When they gave us the bill, the waiter said he ""took some stuff off"" for our inconvenience. When we looked at the bill, it turned out that the only thing he ""took off"" was the complementary bacon. Even though my friends tell me it's never been like that, all-in-all it was not a good experience, and their half-assed attempt at making it up to us made me definitely not want to go back.  Lame.",0.4266,0.822,0.092,0.086,0.5584615384615385

Atmosphere:  LOUD LOUD LOUD, on a crowded Saturday night.  I liked the modern-rustic aesthetic, but the tables are very close together and the ambient noise cannot be blamed on the sound system, which was kept at a minimal level.  By the way, the music (when you can hear it) is good stuff:  I heard The Shins, The Raconteurs, and several other great songs. Service:  Very good, especially from our server Amy, who was warm and friendly and never let my diet soda glass reach empty. Menu:  Many, many options, to the point that I had a difficult time making up my mind even though I wasn't remotely hungry.  Pizzas, pastas, appetizers, a whole separate cured meats/bruschetta card... Caprese salad:  Top-notch.  Even a mediocre caprese is still delicious but Frasca puts together a very nice plate indeed.  The tomatoes are oven-dried, which adds something intangibly tasty. Calamari:  Substandard.  Too breadingy, too greasy, and far too bland.  The accompanying tomato sauce has a slight kick and was the only thing that allowed me to eat about 60% of the serving.  If I leave calamari uneaten, you should know that it must have been worthless.

2010-12-20,5.0,"My only problem with Frasca is that it's across the street from a train station.  No, it's not noisy or anything.  It's just that whenever I eat there, I have to look at people who take public transportation. Frasca has become a neighborhood stop for me, which means every time I'm in the neighborhood, I stop, look at it, and then pass right by. But no, really, ever since I moved north from warm and wonderful MiAmI beAcH, I can't get enough of Frasca's drink specials (and uh, food too, I guess).  Frasca has lots of special nights for wine-o's like me.  Mondays are  1/2 off bottles.  Tuesdays are  1/2 off glasses.  Sundays are $3 drafts.  I'm still waiting for the night when those cute server boys are  1/2 off... OOOH cHiLd, they're thin and bearded and look like they just got off shift at American Apparel.  I'd compost for any of those hedonistic hipsters. So what was I saying?  Oh right, alcohol.  The wine list is largely Washington/Oregon.   I think Oregon is the capital of Washington.  Or the other way around.  Either way, I've never been to Canada, so I can't tell you for sure.  All I know is that this guy named ""Owen Roe"" is very popular on their wine list, and boy do his wines lighten up my sad, lonely life.  Whenever I try to burn my cheating boyfriend's wardrobe like that crazy loca in Waiting to Exhale and the cops lock me up for weeks at a time, it's good to know that I can go right to Frasca and get drunk on my buddy Owen Roe.  And for half off! Ugh, so you probably want to know about the food.  I can sum it up in two words: Mushroom Risotto Fritters.  Fried balls of perfection.  And I know a thing or three about balls.  I've ordered everything on the menu... from cabernet sauvignon, to cabernet franc, to sauvignon blanc, to--wait, which menu are we talking about?  Oh, food?  Oh, I don't eat--why are you asking me to talk about food?

Done and done.  Boyfriend and I snagged a table and started to search the menu for beverages. The drink menu is predominantly wine, but we are avowed beer drinkers. Frasca has a few on tap, including seasonal Octoberfest beers, so just ask your server if you are similarly inclined when it comes to imbibing.  To start, Wild Mushroom Risotto Fritters. What is a risotto fritter, you ask? We didn't know either, which is why we ordered them. Turns out they are fried mac & cheese's classier, more sophisticated cousin; crispy breaded outside, warm, mushroom inside. We like.  Next, we split the Caponata pizza. I'm mad for goat cheese, and Frasca did not hold back - the pie was liberally covered with the stuff. Other toppings (eggplant, peppers, mushrooms, artichokes) likewise did not disappoint.  Now, a note: Frasca does thin crust, wood-fired pizza. So, you grew up in Chicago and like things a little more deep-dish? Come to Frasca's to break out of your pizza rut - they do thin crust quite well. Crispy yet chewy, it is the perfect platform for your toppings. Trust me.  Generally, post-pizza, our meal would be over. However, I happened to scan the menu and see that they had skillet cookies for dessert.

The roasted chicken with asparagus and potatoes is delicious too. The asparagus is always cooked to perfection (I'm picky about my asparagus), and the chicken is always tender.  One evening, I ordered the Limenchello Martini, and my life was changed. The first one tasted like a green Skittle. I ordered another one. That one tasted like a red Skittle.

Tuesday night's is half price wine night and well, I love wine. The wine list was pretty impressive too and I had a lovely Sauv blanc from a Napa winery because I was missing my trip. It was really refreshing and the list was impressive enough that I could barely narrow down what I wanted to drink.  But let's move on to food. It's awesome. For an appetizer, we got the Chorizo bacon wrapped dates and they were really, really good. It came in a red sauce that had a little kick and really made them taste better.

For the main meal, we split a pizza and he graciously let me pick, so I went for the prosciutto with arugula and provolone. It was....amazing. It was perfectly cooked w/the crust not too crispy or burned and the prosciutto adding the perfect amount of flavor. I had to control myself from eating my entire half.

It's so nice to sit outside with fresh flowers around us and lots of people watching to enjoy and no pressure to eat and get out. But the inside is also very charming with modern (but not trying too hard) decor and lighting.  The food was fantastic, and reasonably priced. Of what I tried I loved all of it.  To start: bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates (um...hello delicious!) and fresh bread (a little crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside).  Dinner: Infamous Wrightwood Salad (love all the various fresh ingredients, didn't even need the dressing on the side) and the quattro formaggi pizza (the blend of mozzarella, gorgonzola, ricotta, provolone on a soft and thin crust was phenomenal).  Dessert: Chocolate Chip Cookie in a skillet with ice cream and caramel. It's one of those where if you think you'll only eat one bite, you are SO wrong.  Bruschetta: You're thinking the standard tomato based concept, but here it's a whole lot more. You could eat it as an appetizer if you split it with people, or order it as your meal.

We tried the bruschetta (you choose 3 kinds from a list of about 6 or 7) we had Goat Cheese/Red Pepper, Ricotta Cheese, Pistachios, Honey and Brie with Apples. They were all excellent and the bruschetta bread was perfect. Honestly, the perfect bread! For dinner I had the Wrightwood Salad and loved it. My husband had a Chicken Entree with Fingerling Potatoes and Asparagus. I can't wait to go back and try their Cheese to start and Pasta or Pizza for my entree.  I also had the white wine flight which was really good.  I loved all 3 wines.  They were really decent sized pours and only $14.00.   I really liked it and I was surprised at how laid back it was. You should go and check it out for a nice, relaxing night with friends or for a date.",0.9973,0.715,0.273,0.011,0.7053140096618357

I would recommend, however, that if you are ordering a pizza, to get something that goes beyond just cheese or sausage-- they are ""gourmet"" and kinda pricey, so just go for it and try something new.  There's one in particular that has arugula on it that I absolutely love.",0.9849,0.695,0.266,0.039,0.6614965443912812

The ceiling arch around on the side and they have twinkly lights around the bar.  The place goes far back, with a bar for seating as well.  We got there around 6 on a Thursday and by 7, the place was packed, with pretty much all the tables filled up. We went for a buy one get one free pizza deal, which was an awesome deal.  We started with a small plate of cheese, meats and two bruschetta (you can pick four off their menu for $15)  One bruschetta had ricotta cheese with honey and pistachio.  YUM. The other had mushrooms and goat cheese, also delicious.  We tried the hard aged gouda which was very good and I could have probably have three portions of it. (the portion was quite small)  The pepperoni smelled yummy and garlicky though I did not eat it.   My friend said that it was really infused with lots of delicious flavors.  Next we tried the Caponata pizza and another pizza that I cant remember the name or find on the online menu.  The caponata pizza had chunks of goat cheese, eggplant, mushrooms, red pepper and artichokes.  It was so yummy! The goat cheese could have been distributed more evenly, but the pizza was still really yummy. I also liked the oven baked crust.  The other pizza we got was a white pizza with potatoes and bacon.  We asked for the bacon on the side for the one meat eater in our group and they happily obliged.  That pizza was delicious too, though I am still on the fence on potatoes on pizza.  It is good and I am glad that we tried it, but I think that I would have to get that a few more times to have it be a taste that I am used to.  The waitress was tentative and nice. She was also kind of hilarious. Our water glasses were refilled often. The tables are big blocks of wood that are kind of funky.  We were seated by the window and the door, so it was a little chilly, but in the middle of January, what can you expect.  The location is perfect, really close to the Paulina stop and right off the Lincoln bus.  They have outdoor seating for the summer too.",0.9952,0.828,0.152,0.02,0.5819217687074829

Here are a few things that I think you should know about it: It's very close to the Paulina brown line stop, and street parking is very convenient. They have an extensive wine menu, and I heard through the grapevine that they might be doing wine tasting events in the near future. The atmosphere is so-so. It's a small place, and I feel that they do the best they can with it. The bar is in the center of the space, and really the focal point, which gives it a cool feel. The service is fantastic, and smiles are given easily. As for food, I had the calamari, which I found to be breaded in something that didn't agree with my tastes. I didn't even eat it, actually, and I was surprised that the bus boy didn't say anything to our waitress about a full serving of food going into the garbage. My friend had the tomato basil soup, which she said was terrific, and another friend had gnocchi which was soooo good although the sauce was just a tad on the rich side. I do also want to mention that there are a ton of families here with their children.

We had a reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival despite that half our party was still stuck in traffic. Our server, Audra, was incredible. She was patient with the people of our group who arrived late and gracious when one more guest showed up that was beyond the number we expected.  All of the main meals came out at the same time, piping hot and fresh. Audra allowed us to wine, dine and celebrate with ease. I cannot say it enough: the service was exceptional.  The wine selection was great, our table ordered several bottles of different varieties. The meat and cheese choices were divine and worked well with a large group for an appetizer. The food was very good; most people ordered pizza and were very happy with it. As an East Coast pizza snob who is also Italian, I give it 4 out of 5 stars. The ambiance was wonderful, busy but not overly loud or crowded. It was very romantic, even for such a large group.

We both had pizzas (pepperoni and capone) which were great but the bottom of her pizza was burnt a little bit.  I guess you'll encounter that when it's brick-oven pizza.  The pizzas averaged about $11 each so they were a bit on the pricier side for individual pizzas.

After perusing the menu we decided upon the calamari for an appetizer.  For entrees, I got the handmade gnocchi's in a red sauce and my fiance got the pork marsala.  After ordering, the bread came out and it was 3 pieces of french bread, rather small as I'm used to being overwhelmed by bread at restaurants but no worries bc we had the calamari coming.  When the calamari came out it looked delicious and it was except for the ketchup like cocktail sauce.  At this point we had already gotten our drinks and apparently the bartendar doesn't 't like to rinse out the shaker bc my dirty martini tasted like chocolate...yum and had chunks of ice in it.   Throughout the meal we had two different waitresses.  After my fiance finished his first Martini, he ordered another one but never received it.  Mind you it was a Thursday night and neither the bar nor the restaurant was crowded.  Our original waitress was seen busing tables and what seemed to be waitressing the patio as well.  Maybe they cut staff as times are tough but service was mediocre at best.   The food came out shortly after we finished the app and it looked great however the portion size, for the money, of the gnocchi was tiny.   We did notice that everything seemed to be very ""over-herbed"" and definitely tasted that way.  The gnocchi's and the pork marsala were both good but neither were worth the $15 and $18 we paid for them.  Both could have been $4-$5 less.   Once we asked for the check we canceled the last drink order, since we never got it anyway.  The waitress(es) both realized we weren't that happy and did give us a gift certificate for our next visit.  Frasca touts itself as a pizza and wine bar so maybe we should have just stuck with that.    Seeing as we now have a gift certificate maybe we'll return for another shot.   Again, we loved the atmosphere but we thought the food and drinks were overpriced and the service was meh.",0.9943,0.806,0.144,0.049,0.4546485260770976

We both ordered some prosecco to get things started, and then we both ordered pizzas.  Not sure what she had, but I stayed simple - pepperoni.  While we waited, our server brought some bread out and it was very chewy and delicious.  Mmmm.... before I had time to enjoy more than a couple bites, our pizzas were already done. The pizza is divine.  You could tell it had been made in one of those wood fired ovens, and though I just ordered pepperoni it still had a nice heat to it that made me suck down the rest of my prosecco in a flash.  Nice chewy cheese, the sauce had actual tomatoes in it.  Ah, it was perfection!  It was so good I was all, ""ok, I need to stop eating now"" but I couldn't because it was soooo good.  Paige was enjoying her meat fest, and she said the pizza rivaled Spacca Napoli.  I would tend to agree with her. Finally, Paige and I waved the white flags.  Then she said, ""I could go for some ice cream.""  So we ordered up the cookie sundae - a warm, half baked gooey chocolate chip cookie served in an iron skillet with a scoop of melting vanilla ice cream topped with caramel sauce. It's ok, you can go ahead and drool now. That cookie was amazing.  We ate the whole thing, and I have no shame. Overall, an excellent meal.  The food is YUMMY, prices on the food are right (wine list prices are a little up there), and the service was great.  The patio is perfect, and I think I just found one of my new favorite places to eat.",0.9977,0.715,0.235,0.049,0.5790644540644538

The food was generally good... I liked the prosciutto-wrapped fontina (although I would have preferred the fontina had been more melty) and my husband liked his fried calamari.  I don't think I'd order another martini there though... too many big chunks of ice.  Maybe the mean bartender shakes the shaker too hard. We all had pizzas for our main course.  They were fine, but nowhere as good as Sapore di Napoli or Spacca Napoli.   In the end, I'd say that the food was good (maybe 3-4 star), but I was so grumpy by how the evening began that I couldn't enjoy it.",0.4814,0.849,0.083,0.068,0.4900362318840579

There were a few other small groups of brunchers but we got seated right away, no wait. It was not crowded, not loud, it was just right for the two of us, catching up and enjoying a great meal together.  I got a ""bottomless mimosa"" for $10 which I think was worth it. I did get a funny look from our waitress by about the 7th refill followed by, ""Did you want ANOTHER one?""  Umm, yes. That's what bottomless means, right? Is there a limit??  I guess I should have asked for the bottomless mimosa, hold the judgement. Anyway. We got this amazing fondue app which came with small toasted croutons, apples and a sopresetta or salami to dip into this ooey-gooey garlicy cheese dip. My fave!   Then we split the fried egg sandwich, which was basically a BLT with egg on rye. It was huge and I was happy to only have to tackle the half.

Was greeted and handed a menu, but when my friend showed up 10 minutes later, the bartender still hadn't taken my order. When we finally did order, we had to wait 10 more minutes for our drinks. And 10 more minutes for the round of waters we ordered with the wine. The bartender was crazy busy but still... not my problem. Our server was good. You could tell she was slammed as well, but she did a good job of keeping us informed. And by informed, I mean she let me know a few minutes after I ordered that they had ran out of that particular pizza. I thought it was strange, which ingredients did they run out of? But no problem, I just ordered a different but similar pizza. A moment later she came back, looking embarrassed. Seems the restaurant was out of pizzas all together. All pizzas. A pizza/wine bar was out of pizza. It doesn't make any sense. She was very gracious, very sweet about the whole thing. We couldn't decide then what we wanted, we were both starving, hungry for pizza. The pasta options only seemed to have cream sauces. We settled on pasta, but asked for olive oil sauce or wine sauce, basically anything besides cream sauce. When our dishes arrived, they pretty much were pasta and olive oil. Not great. The salad we split as an appetizer was excellent. But the meh pasta, running out of pizza, lacking service (at the bar, at least), sort of ruined my first experience at Frasca. I do want to go back and try it again.

Actually, it should be noted that I really enjoyed my wine.  This past Saturday they had a ""high end"" California wine flight that was truly excellent. The thing is, there is nothing very memorable about the food.  I had lasagna, which was decent and my boyfriend had the pumpkin ravioli, which was good, but came in a rather small portion.  Brunch is also OK, but I'd rather go to Su Van or Wishbone.  I'd say the stand out is the pizza, so if you can go on a day when they're having one of their specials, I say go for it.  In fact, if based on that alone, I'd probably give Frasca closer to 4 stars. But considering all of the options in the city, I decided never again to be lazy (they are down the street from my boyfriend's apartment, which means no cabs, buses, or one of us forgoing a Saturday night cocktail to drive) and either try something new or go to a restaurant I know serves phenomenal food.   If you're going to spend $92 on dinner, I think you should walk out feeling like the place was worth at least 4 stars.",0.923,0.848,0.108,0.044,0.5944492544492546

2008-09-14,3.0,"3 1/2 stars for great service, but average food. Frantically, I ran to Frasca after discovering my friend failed to make reservations for her birthday dinner at another establishment. I don't know what she was thinking, 10 isn't a small party and it was Saturday night afterall. I explained our situation and the nice hostesses at Frasca said they'd make it work and had a table pulled together for us in 10 minutes. The service here was great, especially because my party was let's just say high maintenance and needlessly impatient. I waited tables back in the day and to this day can't stand when customers are rude. By the end of our meal I felt like an ass for inflicting our group on them and I think they were regretting their decision to be so accomodating (I'm sorry Frasca, I really am). The food was not bad, but just average, most of us got the pizza's. First, I'll warn you the menu on the website is outdated. I was bummed about was the pasta selection, there were 4-5 pasta choices and only 1 was vegetarian, the gnocchi. There was one other dish that was almost vegetarian, it had no meat in it, but was sauteed in chicken au jous. Hey Frasca, why do you have to ruin a perfectly good veggie dish by sauteing it in chicken juice! Since gnocchi is terrible if not done right I figured the safer bet was the pizza. Second, there were only 2 vegetarian pizzas Margherita and 4-cheese, for a place that has 8 different bruschetta's I expected something more creative. I got the Margherita pizza, it was tasty and I liked the crust, but it was nothing to write home about.  Sure you could create your own pizza, but it would quickly be one expensive personal pizza - most toppings were $2+ each. Like I mentioned they have 8 different bruschettas and an option to create your own sampler. Some friends split a sampler as an appetizer and really liked them, especially the green apple-brie one. They also have cheese plates too - I think those come with a sampler option as well. Bottom line, this place is pretty good, however since I'm not a meat eater or over the moon about their pizza's I probably won't be back unless it's for drinks and to try the bruschetta.",0.9872,0.737,0.166,0.097,0.6363681849551416

I really can't comment on the atmosphere inside as, aside from one drink at the bar, the few times I've been here I've sat outside. Looks comfortable though. However the food, in my humble opinion, is only so-so. The concept is appealing, but I really can't get excited about this place. There are just too many other options around with better offerings. As a pizzeria it falls considerably short compared with Spacca Napoli or Apart Pizza Company. For example, the crust is a bit thicker and lacks the flavor, slight char, and blistering of these two. Equally bothersome is that Frasca's pizza margherita uses a low-moisture commercial ""mozzarella"" (the stretchy/stringy type) rather than fresh fior di latte or mozzarella di bufala.

2008-07-09,4.0,"I tell you what, I really like Frasca. It's billed as a Pizzeria + Wine Bar but it's really just a pseudo-italian restaurant that happens to have pizza and wine on the menu (you're kidding me?).  The food is really decent and they try pretty hard to make the dining experience unique. They have this small paper checklist and pencil that sits at the table so you can mark off the appetizers, cheeses, and bruscetta you want and just hand it to your waiter/waitress. Not the most unique idea in the world but I give them points for thinking outside of the box. Plus, they have about six different types of bruscetta and they're all worth a try, so check away! I recently moved out of Roscoe Village (Frasca's hood) and one of the things I miss most is Wednesday's 2-for1 pizza special. My favorite think on the menu is probably the Shrimp and Panchetta pizza, a savory, peppery treat... and 2-for-1 is hard to beat. The atmosphere at Frasca is fairly realxed, though it can get a bit hectic in primetime on the weekends. They have outdoor seating when the weather permits and all the booths along the north wall have huge open windows that really bring the outside in. The kitchen is open, it's centerpiece being a large woodburning oven that fills the air with amazing aromas... rosemary comes to mind. The waitstaff are generally friendly and knowledgable and are always quick to recommend a nice wine pairing. They kind of fade into the backgroud, which, I think is a good thing. It's always hard to move to a new neighborhood and leave the places you have come to love the most behind.

The first time I went with my boyfriend, we got the butcher's block appetizer (HIGHLY recommend this, you choose from an assortment of meats, cheeses and bruschetttas. All were delicious!), and split the wild arugula salad (fantastic!) and the capone pizza which was delicious. The crust was crispy and soft and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. The wine flight was also great with generous pours for each wine. I think they might have been able to do a better job explaining the different wines, but we didn't ask, so I can't really fault them for that. The second time I went, I had a vodka martini from the bar that tasted rancid since they used the olives soaked in oil, not brine. I was disappointed, but that's what I get for not ordering wine I guess. We made the mistake of ordering a pasta dish (I don't remember what it was) that was watery, bland and pretty disappointing overall. We had the rustica pizza as well after our great experience with one the last time. The rustica pizza was SO salty it was practically inedible.

I had the caesar salad with chicken and it was delicious. We split the carrot cake tiramasu, and I just didn't ""get it."" It was so rich and the cream used was globby and thick. It was odd, I wouldn't recommend that. Plus, it was supposed to come with espresso, and it did not.  Overall I think the menu a bit pricey for a place that calls itself a ""pizzeria.""

The bartender got to us immediately with a menu, and came back promptly to take our order - I can't complain about that.  My wife's kir royale came immediately, and the barkeep poured the Italian white flight as soon as he had gathered up the bottles he needed.  One thing that made an impression on me was that when one of my glasses came up just barely short, he went and opened a new bottle and topped me up.  Frankly I wouldn't have noticed... but then again I'm sure he was going to pour more of that wine, so it's not like it was just for my benefit.  But he wasn't taking shortcuts. The food looked great but I can only comment on the wine.  My wife was a little disappointed with her kir royale - a little too much Chambord for her taste.   The white flight was nice, and an interesting mix.  There was a fragrant, fruity Friulano, a dry Pinot Bianco, and a very interesting Soave that they described as fruity and ""creamy.""   What struck me was the full creaminess and slight sweetness, combined with the tree fruit flavors - it tasted not unlike a good dry Belgian ale, maybe a golden ale (they're fruity and not too hoppy).

2007-08-28,2.0,"Now, its official name is Frasca Pizzeria and Wine Bar, and I'm just like, hand me the pizza slicer already so I can cut myself a break. Pizza demands beer like Kim Jong-Il needs nuclear bombs, so having a cellar of stellar wines on the drinks list is like Condee Rice snooping into unknown DMZs. But enough of American politics -- after all, I am from Singapore and my specialty is food. So Caroline and I ordered Lagunitas, a microbrew from Petaluma, California, which was very tasty indeed on that summer evening, and scoured the menu -- it was, perchance, two-for-one pizza day. Governor Rod Blagojevich should come here to learn a thing or two about budgeting. As Stellas, Amstel Lights and Blue Moons began to appear on the table, we settled on a flight of appetisers that took off with a trio of bruschettas, cheeses with fig jam and slices of various Italian meats. Nothing fried, but this was a bubbly, Euro-crust kinda of pizza place, so we had to fancy it up a little. They were delectable enough finger foods, and we were hungry enough to forget to take pictures. Five small plates for $15.00, reasonable. Nobody wanted to share calamari with me.  For pie, I decided to honour my adopted hometown with the Capone; wood roasted onions, fennel sausage and fresh mozzarella on tomato sauce. It was tasty, but nothing special nor memorable. I had all kinds of clever captions lined up in case it was delicious, like -- ""Murder Incorporated"" or ""State trooper can look (but he better not touch)"" or ""Local hero,"" but the best I can do is, ""The cops busted Madame Capone for telling fortunes better than they'd be."" Unlike our first two excursions, there was no theme to Pizzapalooza III. Crust was organic, Pizza Rustica was Venetian, Frasca is... bastard European bubbly crust? I do enjoy pizzas with cyst-like textures, but overall, I felt my 'za was average in taste, albeit a satisfying filler after a romp in the lake. If Spacca Napoli is ""Born to Run,"" then Frasca in my mind is ""Tunnel of Love."" It should be really glad that it didn't end up in ""Lucky Town,"" but that could be because it had a brilliant disguise. Yes, everyone in Chicago loves thin crust with fresh ingredients these days, but no, let's not keep opening more just for the sake of it. Let's continue to wait 45 minutes for a table at Spacca, bless its 3,000-ton brick oven imported from Naples. Dessert, however, was a different spin on a brand new record. I thought we had the best dessert of the tour thus far at Frasca, and I was pleased that the group was willing to place the burden of ordering in my hands. So I selected the carrot cake tiramisu (interesting... glad we tried, wouldn't order again), chocolate banana nut cake with chocolate gelato (now we're talking... I would learn Italian just to coo chocolate banana nut cake with chocolate gelato in its native language) and marscapone cheesecake with a chocolate crust and raspberry sauce (si si). For the six of us, we spent approximately $150.00 (plus one take-home pizza for Jim MacGregor). My verdict: 4 slices of yuppie 'zas (out of 8) -- one slice for dessert alone.",0.9975,0.778,0.17,0.053,0.5271483835313624

Mondays usually stink but THIS particular Monday meant a new job for me which equaled a new reason to celebrate / blow off normal things.  Funny enough, Monday is the day-o-half-priced-wine at Frasca.  Sold!  Lee and I ordered a bottle and some a la carte bruschetta.  Both were top notch.  Now for the pizza. . .fantastic!  The crust was the right combo of chewy-crispy and the toppings were great.  Naturally, I loved the plain old roni and cheese but adventurous Lee ordered a pie with pesto, prosciutto, and veggies.  The prosciutto here is worth noting because they cook it in the form of mini prosciutto balls.  This method makes the salty meat THAT much more tasty.  For dessert we went with carrot cake tiramisu.  I love carrot cake in any and all forms.   As for the service - our waitress was a little cold at first but she got better after our initial drink order (didn't we all).  The one complaint was the spacey hostess who may actually have a legitimate stick up her bum.  I won't let her ruin my rave review but hopefully she had said stick removed.  Sticks aside, Frasca one me over so check it out!",0.9958,0.737,0.222,0.041,0.5071874204227145

I just wanted to sit there all night - and I almost did. Three hours flew by! After my friend Antoinette raved about this place and their weekday specials, we had to check it out. We dined on a Wednesday - which is Buy One, Get One pizzas!! - and ordered two pizzas, the bruschetta appetizer, and a couple glasses of wine.  As a self-proclaimed bruschetta freak, the Pick Three appetizer was music to my ears. We chose the Smoked Salmon & Capers, the Ricotta, Pistachio & Honey, and the Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese bruschettas.  Listen up, friends, I could've sat there all night long munching on these delectable snacks. They're *that* good. As for the pies, I tried the Prosciutto Pizza which featured the namesake, olive oil, fresh mozzarella and arugula. YUM. Antoinette had the Caponata Pizza with tomato sauce, eggplant, goat cheese, roasted peppers, shrooms & olives. Although I didn't sample her pizza, neither of us left with a doggy bag, and that's usually evidence of a tasty meal.

I briefly thought the thick rough wood tables were hokey and northwoodsy set against sleekly curved dark wood canopies, until we were seated against a wall covered in subtle tree-printed wallpaper, and I became slightly amused at the theme.  We sat at a two top against a wall-length booth, rather close to our neighbors, which would probably be more comfortable on a busier night when the place is buzzing with more ambient noise. Presented with a checklist for cheese and bruschetta, we opted for the latter, and were tickled by our selection - ricotta and pineapple, salmon and capers, wild mushrooms and goat cheese.  Here it's served on thick slices of un-toasted bread, which I thought was odd but less messy! Pizza is enough for one person with a decent appetite - while it's about the size of the stuff we used to get in Rome, their crust is more of a pillowy flatbread than a thin crust.  Great combinations of Italian meats and cheeses and vegetables.  We devoured shrimp and Italian bacon, and a Caponata (eggplant, goat cheese, veggies).",0.915,0.885,0.088,0.027,0.4384615384615384

Pretty cool in my opinion. I started off with a martini which didn't exactly get the job done- tasty, but it could have used a bit more alcohol! After a martini, a wine flight, and another martini, I was not even buzzed- which may either mean the martinis are just generally weak, or I have developed some serious alcoholism. One of my friends and I split a pizza- I wasn't sure what would be enough to order.  This was just slightly not enough to fill us up- thankfully we both had salads (ok I had caprese, that counts as salad right?!?).  The pizzas seemed to be in the $9-13 range, and are pretty light so a person with a decent appetite might just barely be a little too stuffed with a whole pizza.  Hopefully that explanation makes some sense! The crust was pretty good, not too crunchy (I dislike crispy pizza so I definitely notice this stuff) but not soggy, kind of light really.  Our other friend's penne was smaller than I had thought it would be for the price too (entrees start around $12 I think, with pricier items like steak being closer to $20) The drinks were very tasty though, particularly the sparkling wine flight- there was a sparkling red in there which was amazing!  The atmosphere is also very cute- but there were families with young kids which cuts either way I guess.  Otherwise just groups of happy looking people- very inviting and warm feeling to the decor (even if physically you might be a little chilly by the windows!)
