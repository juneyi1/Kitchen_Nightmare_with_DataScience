My friend and I sat down at the end of the bar after two gentleman got up and waited for over 10 minutes with no one even bothering to acknowledge we were there.  Once we made eye contact with a bartender and my friend said ""hi"", he very curtly responded with a ""Yeah I'll be right with you"" and then proceeded to sort his clip boards with the specials on them. When he was fully ready to take our order he looked at us and said what do you want. I asked for a menu because that seems like a normal request at a bar. After our first round of drinks were finished, we waited another 20 minutes before we were acknowledged by a bartender and asked if we wanted another drink. Mind you, others around us were getting speedy service from the other older bartender, but apparently they don't tip pool because only the one bartender would even look in our direction. The other guy acted as if we didn't exist. I am not sure what's going on in this place tonight, but I sincerely hope this is just a fluke. I come to shows here often and feel like these guys behind the bar tonight are annoyed with their jobs and lacking any real customer service and the bar is not THAT busy.",0.9105,0.868,0.095,0.037,0.4771284271284271
2017-01-03,5.0,"As far as music venues go, this one was great. It's definitely one of my new favorites for sure.   The only downsides to the place was that it's a bit unclear when doors/the show are happening because you'll find a different time everywhere you look - so I'd suggest to get there at the earliest time you see and then wandering around if you're early. The other downside being that it's very hard to transfer tickets seeing as their policy is quite intense - so if you end up unable to go your ticket is pretty likely to be wasted.    Other than that it was all good. It was nice and warm inside - a nice change from the freezing temperatures and snow we faced before coming in. There were tables in the venue area to sit while you watched the show and lots of coat racks so you don't have to worry about holding them.   The employees were friendly and helpful and the ticket prices are low. There was parking offered at the venue (look for the address of the garage on their site), but that was a bit of a mess. It was a heated and locked garage that stayed open late (4am, I believe?) which was greatly appreciated, but the prices were quite high if you don't get the ticket validated by Schubas. On top of that, we DID get our ticket validated (which meant our ticket should have come out to a max of $8), but when we tried to exit we were charged the max (around $40). The great thing about it is that there's a number on the machine to call and she was very helpful - she ended up letting us out for free due to the ""trouble"" so that we didn't have to come up with $40.   The last great thing I'll mention is that it's in a really good area as far as other things to do. We were able to walk to Cheesies for lunch and Blaze for dinner - then find other things to amuse ourselves while we waited for showtime.

This, by itself, is not terrible, but means that if something comes up between the several weeks between paying for the show and the show actually happening, you are out of luck.  There is no way to transfer/sell/give away your ticket under any circumstances.   This low-rent system would not be so bad if it meant that some kind of cost savings were passed on to concertgoers.  Nope.  Instead, this place has surcharges as high as a legitimate ticket service.  We get to pay $3.75 (per ticket!) to be inconvenienced by this absurd system.",-0.3186,0.856,0.075,0.068,0.6812820512820513

It was a Sunday afternoon - don't know if they were understaffed - but it didn't appear so. We asked 2 other servers to get us drinks and take our food order because we rarely saw our server. Her excuse at one point was she was training someone so she was talking a lot. God help the poor girl who was being trained by her! My credit card was charged twice! We asked for 2 separate checks for our group of 6, and the charges on each check were mixed up - no surprise. We could easily pay each other for the errors so we didn't ask for them to be corrected.  But my credit card was charged for both checks, and my friends card was charged for her bill - a coincidence that the repeated charge was the higher bill - I doubt it!

Unfortunately we didn't look closely enough and when we got there we realized the acoustic brunch wasn't for another 2 hours. I ordered the Mona omelette with pancakes on the side instead of hash browns and toast. My friend ordered the cinnamon French toast and a side of bacon. I didn't try his but he said it was very good, sweet enough that it didn't need syrup. My omelette was very greasy and if it had pesto in it I couldn't see or taste it. It was pretty much flavorless and definitely not worth the $10 they charge. The side of pancakes was very good though. Nice and thick and cooked perfectly.  So this review is 2 stars for 2 reasons, 1. Because of the bad omelette and 2. Because my friend's side of bacon came with an additional surprise... A piece of hair. We sent it back, the waitress apologized and brought out a new plate but still charged us for it on the check. Rule number one in restaurants: if there is hair in a dish you comp it. Something else that was odd was the way you walk into the brunch room is through the bar and then through the servers' drink station which is unsanitary in my opinion.  The service here was good and we didn't have to wait but the hair in the food, being charged for it, and having one of the most bland and boring omelettes that didn't come with everything it claimed ruined my experience.

If I would have known how long it would take (1 hour & 30 minutes) to get my food, I would have gone elsewhere. I would have understood the wait if it was packed, but there were only 4 other tables being serviced at this time. Not only that, the waitress was very awkward & not very friendly at all. When our food finally did come out, I was given the wrong dish, so I had to wait even longer for them to remake it. Keep in mind, the first band had already started their set, of course the band that I paid $30 to see. I ended up missing half of their set, which really upset me. The food was great, no complaints there. The waitress also got a lot more friendly after messing up my order, but she should have been more friendly to begin with.

Shows here are quality and well put together, so even if you're on a bill with someone you don't know, chances are you'll be happy. Park on Belmont and load in through the side door east of the main entrance. Stage is small but fine and a nice height. Share gear if you can. Room is narrow and long, with a bar in the back. Through the doors is the front room bar and restaurant. There's a room upstairs as well. In general, a nice place to hang out before the gig. Sound is good, they worked hard to get it right, and the staff is excellent. Not big and they seem to keep a close watch on capacity, so while the room fills up fast it's always comfortable to watch as well.

FOOD: On Wednesdays they offer their mac & cheese for half off.  So, my wife and I shared a chicken sandwich and an order of mac & cheese.  The sandwich was really good.  Juicy chicken and just a solid sandwich.  The mac & cheese had a ton of options.  Lots of ""add on"" possibilities.  We asked our server for some popular combinations and settled on a basil and goat cheese combination (at least I think that's what it was).  The mac & cheese was good, but not great.   I think the goat cheese may have thrown off the taste of the other cheeses that come standard.  I'd be very interested to go back and try some other combinations because I think the mac & cheese has some serious potential.  It's also a very big portion. PRICE: the price was great.  I don't recall exactly how much, but I remember thinking I felt like we got a great deal.   MUSIC VENUE:  We saw Ingrid Michaelson and the show was awesome!  It's a tiny room and feels so intimate.  The sound was great, you can get right up to the stage, and the temperature was pretty comfortable.  We were really glad we got to see the show.

There are some tables off to the side, but mostly its an open floor space but that is never a problem.  The bar areas themselves are pretty solid.

The Food:  I've sampled a range of menu options:  turkey burger, sweet potato fries, mac & cheese, chicken/brie sandwich with apple slices, bean/chicken burrito, chips/salsa.  The food is consistently good, hot, and service has always been quick.  Out of those entrees, the bean burrito was my least favorite - not that special;  the standout to me was the sweet/savory chx/brie/apple sandwich and the thick, hot & gooey mac/cheese - awesome.   The Beverages:  This is a Schlitz bar.  I like that.  I also like the oldschool blue glass ""Schlitz"" lighting fixtures in the upstairs dining room/bar (*more on that later).  They've got your average lineup of draft beers - not a huge selection, but enough.  They are a tad pricey, wish prices were a buck or two lower.  They offer $4 'apple pie' or 'pineapple' shots, dispensed from giant vessels filled with booze and said (real) fruit.  Haven't tried those yet, but I plan to.  *Holiday note:  They've just started serving hot spiced Glogg wine.  $5 glass, yes please!   The Waitstaff:  Everyone here is always laid back, cool, pleasant, helpful.  They seem like they're enjoying themselves, and that helps me enjoy myself.  * Back to the 'more on that later' note:  Our group reserved the private upstairs room for the weekly meetings.  The room has its own bar, bathroom, tvs, music/speaker setup, and is adorned with tables, loungy leather couches and those great old Schlitz lighting fixtures.  It's an ideal space for a private party, meeting, social gathering, etc. and has worked out great for us.   Of course, this place also hosts concerts all the time too.  I have not yet seen a show, but along with the apple pie / pineapple shots, it's something I plan to do.",0.9963,0.787,0.192,0.021,0.5309246954595792

The upper room right between the bar area and Harmony Grill is great, air conditioned and a perfect space for 35ish people. They do have a very steep staircase to get up and no elevators,  but our older guests were pretty spry and had some help, so that was a non-issue.  The food was great and everyone complimented us on both the appetizers and dinner. My favorite appetizers were the bacon wrapped dates and the cucumber sandwiches. We got the southern style dinner option and it was a hit with everyone. They do have basic choices for dessert but we brought in our own from outside which they had no problems with, and even had empty trays waiting for our spread.  Price wise, it was reasonable but on the upper end of the budget. Room rental itself isn't bad, and the appetizers on their own are ok, but once you start adding everything together, it can get about as expensive as a wedding itself! They can make it as fancy as you want - we had linens on the tables, real silverware and glasses, plates, etc. However, make sure you mention this and even put it in your contract if you want the fancy. We came the day before and confirmed linens on the table, but there was a mix-up on the silverware and plates, so make sure you have it all down and confirmed.

I've never experienced crappy sound here, the space is charming and intimate, the bar has a decent beer selection, and the bathrooms seldom have a line. In fact, because this is an inexpensive venue that doesn't use ticketmaster or slap you with other fees, you can afford to see the band and have as much beer as you want!  Because it's small, it can get packed and hot, there's no room for coat check, and you shouldn't expect to be able to sit down while listening to the music (and probably not in the bar area, either). The jukebox in the bar area is pretty good, but a few times I have been there and it (along with the photo booth) was not working, or some jerks were hogging it and trying to start fights with other people who wanted to buy songs on it.

Harmony Grill:  Good food at decent prices.  Your typical bar fare, plus a variety of  interesting sandwich and entrée options (Cuban sammy, vegan burrito, gumbo, etc.).  The restaurant area is cool, well kept, and usually pretty crowded (in a good way).  Always impressed by the wait staff. Bar:  Nothing special here - just a chill bar.  They have eight or so beers on tap so you can usually find a draft that will make you happy.  They charge only a little more for the good stuff (Bells, Delirium, imports, etc.) then the domestics which almost encourages you to drink the better beer.  Good place to grab a drink pre-show or post-dinner.",0.9924,0.77,0.23,0.0,0.5744937055281883

At first it was funny, but as he continued to hit on my friend and grab her ass after she told him she wasn't interested, things went downhill rapidly. He became very belligerent, and then he started being an ass - not just to us, but to every woman around us. Grabbing asses, stumbling around, acting like a fool, you get the idea. (And it wasn't that kind of show.) And yet, the bartender kept serving him. I stepped out to the guy working the little podium outside and gave him a heads up that he was overserved, and that they might want to a) cut him off and b) keep an eye on him. He said he would take care of it. His idea of taking care of it? Popping his head in and not even seeing the guy, and leaving. The guy continued to be a drunk asshole, and at one point I lost my shit and had to yell at him in order for him to finally leave us alone. And the bartender kept on serving him! In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal I guess. More important things in life, blah blah blah.

I've been on that stage probably two dozen times and have never had a problem.  The soundcrew are top notch (Fabrice especially), the stage (while somewhat tight of a squeeze at times) is still cozy enough that you can have an intimate show with the crowd. As a patron, this place is fantastic as well.  The doorstaff are always nice, the bar is extraordinarily stocked with whatever you can throw at them, the bartenders are great and will make you a nice Chicago-style heavy-handed drink at non-exorbitant pricing.   The food is phenomenal as well.  Harmony Grill's mac and cheese (as mentioned previously) is the stuff of legend.  Try a pesto, ham and green pea mac and cheese.  Highly recommended. The thing that people seem to skim by on the menu is probably the best thing in the house:  The honey chicken brie sandwich. Honey glazed chicken with melted brie, candied walnuts, sliced green apples and lettuce on a focassia roll.  Are you kidding me?   Locationwise, this place has always confused me.  For a place with such a gauge on the pulse of the music industry it sometimes gets filled with the least music-interested people out there.  Come friday or saturday night while you try to pass through the bar to get to a sold out show in the back music room, you may have to swim through a swarm of Cubs jerseys and Axe body spray before you can get to the door to get in to see the show.  It sometimes makes me wonder how many live Phish and Dave Matthews Band cds are being unattended at home while all of their owners are out on the weekends.

Look:  I do not expect special attention simply because I am one of three females in a bar teeming with men.  I don't mind waiting for a drink.  What I DO mind is a bartender mean-mugging me dead in the eye while measuring my booze into the eensie-weensiest regulation shot glass possible before adding it to my glass of ice and soda.   A bartender that can't wing a drink is no friend of mine.   My companions, however, were parsimonious and easy-to-please enough to drink the $3 Busch Lites that were on special.  They had no complaints.

On top of being able to listen to good music they actually have pretty good food too and a very comfortable outside patio to enjoy it in. It is not a high traffic restaurant or bar area in lakeview which makes it kinda of a good get away spot. You are able to walk farther North on Southport and get into more of a bar/ restaurant area if you would like. I would recommend checking this place out for music or a simple meal.,0.98,0.743,0.257,0.0,0.5553968253968253

Luckily, Schubas has a small, intimate room for their shows. Even when I'm stuck behind someone taller (and let's face it, EVERYONE is taller than me), I can usually squeeze through somewhere and find a nice little spot for myself with an unobstructed view. The thing I like about Schubas is that they don't oversell their tickets. Every time I go to a show there, they end up selling out, but the room isn't stuffed with bodies. The result is a fairly laid back, enjoyable experience. Plus they're one of the few bars that sell my favorite beer, Beck's light. Fair prices for shows, always parking available, friendly staff.

2010-05-09,4.0,"I sat here.  I never sit at shows.  But here I sat. They have a bar in the front part of the venue which is rather narrow and though when you enter the concert hall it's still narrow but bigger. It wouldn't be a very good place for a dancey show in my opinion, (I consider a dancey show something like Infected Mushroom) but for light jamming it's great. I saw Casiotone for the Painfully Alone the other night (I've been Brokeyotone for the painfully jobless) which was a particularly chill show.  There are a few tables for 2 people each along the left hand side of the room, and a wooden booth-like seating area that spans from one side of the room to the other. Tables are separated a couple feet from each other on this side, and sharing tables is simple and unintrusive. I sat on the far end nearest the doors and the sound table and was able to throw my feet up while I sat in the corner nook. Believe me it was a beautiful experience.  There is a waitress that walks around with a smile on her face and a small bar in the back of the room. Not all of the beers served are in the small bar though. I went out to the main bar to buy a glass of Matilda. It was a little over 8 bucks. Considering it tided me over with a nice buzz and I only needed one beer, it was worth the price. However, when the bartender first told me how much it was I blinked a couple times. It wasn't a big glass, but served its purpose. I can't make a statement on any other drinks.  Overall I had a nice time. The acoustics were pleasant, the stage looked like a small play could have been preforming there, and though there was plenty of room to stand (though in the back it's hard to see the stage) I was very comfortable with sitting on the room long bench.  I'm considering seeing a post rock concert coming up which is playing one day at Lincoln Hall and the next at Schubas, and after experiencing both venues I'm more interested in seeing it at Schubas based on atmosphere. I haven't been a big drinker at shows lately. Based on drinks, I would probably go to Lincoln Hall. As well as a better shot at getting up front by the stage. If you're taking photographs at Schubas, you'll have much more intimate shot opportunities however.

They have half off on wine bottles on Tuesdays, and half off on macaroni and cheese on Wednesdays. Now, if they could combine the two, I'd give this place six stars.  The entire experience was phenomenal. Started off with some Schlitz, moved onto the hummus appetizer and a bottle of wine. Scaled up with a burrito and another bottle of wine. It was a friend's b'day, so got some shots. At this point, we're all already loving the place, and our server - she was friendly and helpful and amazing. And then we go in for the music.  People always talk about how Schubas is a stepping stone for music acts before they go to subterranean and then the Aragon, before embarking on a worldwide tour, and while that may be true, for me the story is mood based, not size or fame based. Schubas lends itself to more of a mellow, intimate feel. I don't know if it's the dim, warm lighting. Or the crowd that lends to a cozy feel. I just know that I would not be happy listening to alternative or metal here, like I would be at Subterranean. Give me throaty voiced female singers who strum on their acoustic guitars at this joint. Or Iron and Wine. You know what I'm talking about? Anyways, after the performance was over, we spent some more time here chilling. It's a really nice place.

They've also got a booker who knows how to book eclectic small-venue shows.  The schedule is heavy on the folk and indie pop-rock side with bursts of international bands and themed nights/bands. If you're looking for Dave Matthews, go to the United Center. If you're looking for the super hot newcomer or the established indie artists, you'll probably be going to the Bottle or the Riviera. That's not to say that Schubas doesn't book bands like Okkervil River, but they're more likely to mix things up a bit so that it's not all Okkervil River, and it'll be Okkervil's sophomore or junior album touring. The pricing is also incredibly reasonable. Most shows are purchased straight through Schubas Web site, which means avoiding absurd Ticketmaster surcharges. There is, however, a $2.00 Schubas ticket charge. That's nothing to complain about, fer sure, but because hard tickets are not printed and all tickets are will-call even this itty-bitty charge seems questionable. Maybe it's paying for the will-call dude or a sound tech? Who knows? Last, transportation to Schubas isn't the best. It's a simple walk in my hood, but I could see how depending on the Belmont bus would be tedious after a concert. Brown line is three blocks away. It is, however, a great location for biking with plenty of well-lit spots to lock up bikes and a vigilant doorman always wandering around out front.

Ding!  :::::::::::Round One: Schuba's:::::::::::::  Super cheap shows. Really, really cheap... I've never paid more than $12.00 here for a 'headliner' like Regina Spektor or MGMT, $5.00 for small homespun gigs and often shows are just downright FREE. Fabulous! The main stage room is intimate and warm, just as I like it. Throngs of bodies pressed up against each other, swaying to the music and creating an energy that is nothing short of spine-tingling. I missed out, unfortunately, on the circus punk stylings of the 30-piece Mucca Pazza while I was there on Thursday night but alas the jukebox kept me well occupied... non-digital and stocked with plenty of hipster rock (hello Fleet Foxes) I was ready to curl up and cry in no time. Kidding. I shed a few tears due only to the lack of Miller products (no High Life peeps) but had a rockin' good time regardless with good company, friendly bar staff and being fed red vines - who knew?? As you can see, I'm a big advocate of Schuba's for big shows, small shows, drinkin' and drankin'... Put it on your live list!  :::::::::::Round Two: Harmony Grill:::::::::::::  Yummy! Set just next door to Schuba's in it's own space - but still part of the family, you can order their grub at the bar - one good turn of the music deserves another with the food and Harmony Grill does not disappoint. Really solid weekend brunch and dinner options alike!! Whether you hit 'em up pre or post show or just show up for a little Sunday Funday belly fill there are great options awaiting you... A few of my favs? Beignettes with a raspberry dipping sauce and their Luigi Omelet with smoked chicken-apple sausage, roasted peppers, fresh basil & mozzarella - hook it up with a side of cheddar, garlic grits for a little extra oomph! Dinner time is all about the mac 'n cheese my little thrashers... they do you right with the best m 'n c outside of Mama's kitchen!  :::::::::::Decision:::::::::::::  I call a draw!!

Matilda, Hoegaarden and a few other fine brews on tap. The wings, fries and chicken tenders ordered from Schubas' Harmony Grill at the bar were all very tasty, though portions border on the smallish side. Bartenders are attentive, fast and friendly, even when it came time to close our tab. And completely deserving of a fat tip that I still feel good about this morning!

With the exception of this one unfortunate show, I have never had a bad experience at Schubas.  The crowd is usually very respectful, the sound is excellent, and the staff is very friendly.   Drinks are a little on the pricy side.

There are places in Boston comparable in size that really can't get a hold of their sound, but Schuba's definitely rocked it. The lines for drinks were long, so after two beers I stopped. The crowd however.. was there some serious pre-gaming I wasn't aware of? Cuz I did NOT get the memo. I think I got more beer on me than I actually imbibed. Is this the normal Schuba's ""culture""? One thing that really bothered me.. the smoking. No one was smoking in the back music room (that I saw), but they were everywhere else.

2007-09-12,4.0,"It's hard to give Schubas only one review since they are a restaurant, bar and music venue. As far as the restaurant goes, The Harmony Grill, it tries to hint at a southern style with Mac and Cheese, Crab Cakes, Chili, Southern Chicken Salad, Pork etc. Of course they also have decent burgers with good fries and some vegetarian options like the Tofu Chili Mac which is actually better than their regular Chili Mac. It's definitely a step up from bar food but nothing fancy, more of a weekend lunch spot but I usually go there for brunch. I guess the main draw with their brunch is that it's A. Good, and B. they have a huge Bloody Mary bar.  As for the bar, I typically go there for Bears game brunch as you get to avoid all the guys with backwards Michigan State hats keeping track of their fantasy football stats. If you like to watch the Bears but aren't still trying to relive your H.S. football days and escape your wife and 2 blonde kids which are a staple around the Southport-Belmont area  and want to avoid the frat boy football crowds then this place is perfect. The decor is awesome and its old and looks like what a bar should look like. I did however notice that they don't have any Pilsners at all but have plenty of other good beers to choose from. They also have a pretty decent juke box but since I am usually there on Sunday's to watch the Bears, I usually don't exploit that resource. As far as the venue goes it's small but it sounds good and they always have decent bands even though most of them are usually too folksy / grass roots for me to know who they are. It's hard to imagine that they would actually book someone who was down right awful. This is definitely not a place like the Mutiny where you may find a band playing their first show, very few local acts. The crowd for the bar and the crowd for the venue is typically very different, especially at night. I would venture to say that the people who go to this bar typically aren't wouldn't be the same people who show up to their shows and vice versa unlike what the Fireside was like back in the day. UPDATE: Due to the revelation that they actually charge you $.50 for ""rocks"" AKA Ice in a Jameson on the rocks, along with the expensive drinks and not the cheapest food in the world, my friends have informed me that they plan on moving our Sunday Bears brunches elsewhere.

Which is okay. Sometimes.",0.8313,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.30416666666666664
2005-08-24,4.0,Schuba's is a friendly little neighborhood bar that greatly enriches the Chicago live music scene.  It is so intimate you can hear the bands rather than the people screaming conversation next to you.  Drinks are not too terribly priced and I have never had a problem with parking!,0.7248,0.784,0.166,0.05,0.55
2005-08-12,4.0,"I have been to this club a few times, but it was my last time that was the most fun and memorable. I was invited by WXRT to watch the Wallflowers perform in their back room, which is where the stage area is. Say hi and toast one with the friendly owner Bill Schuba. You will probably find street parking like I did, which is always a plus.",0.9252,0.828,0.172,0.0,0.3380952380952381
2005-08-10,4.0,This place has a lot of good bands that come through. The food is good for bar food. Some outdoor seating in the summer. Street parking is not terrible in this area. This is a good place to stop in before heading out for the night.,0.8424,0.744,0.215,0.042,0.7000000000000001
2005-08-09,5.0,"Check out their website to find great bands and musicians playing there. That's the best part of this bar. It's a little over-priced to drink, so you may want to hit some place else up to drink and then head over for a great show.",0.9409,0.707,0.293,0.0,0.575
2005-07-11,5.0,"Schubas is an awesome place to get some drinks and go stand right in front of the amplifier and awe at the guitarist 2 feet in front of you. I went there earlier this summer and saw Nick Hornby do a reading in conjunction with a concert with one of his favorite bands, Marah. It was one of the most memorable shows I've ever attended. Schubas is intimate, contains a steady bill of notable performers and usuaully draws a good crowd. Rock out, dude.",0.875,0.882,0.118,0.0,0.6735714285714286
2005-07-06,5.0,This bar and concert is one of the best places to see a small concert and be able to hear and see the band the whole time. I have enjoyed every band I have seen so far and will continue to see many more!,0.8313,0.833,0.167,0.0,0.553125
