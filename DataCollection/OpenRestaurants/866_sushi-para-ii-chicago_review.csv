They are awful about charging extra for every grain of rice. Don't drop even 1 grain otherwise prepare to get charged extra. No exaggeration! The service is mixed. Some of the workers are amazing but the waitress(es) who are related to the owners are Nazis when it comes to charging extra. If I'm able make 1 customer skip this place I've succeeded in doing humanity good. Para i's a terrible place to get quality experience and sushi. Try a diff place because it'll be worth the extra $3 more. This business decided that it's better to sour the whole experience over 10 cents worth of rice rather than let it go for a positive customer experience.  Note to management: I got charged extra $$ for this BS and now I'm here writing a negative review revealing the truth about your shady business. Also, I'm going to tell all my friends AND everyone I meet to avoid this place. Great business sense!",0.9704,0.731,0.182,0.088,0.3882867132867132

We came here around 2:30 on a Saturday and it was pretty bare in there. We were two of about 8 people there. I ordered the Spicy salmon roll, the spider roll, and one other roll (the name escapes me). My boyfriend ordered the salmon skin roll and the spicy salmon as well. The soy sauce was WAYY too salty. I don't know why or what kind they use, but it definitely did not compliment the fish well at all. In the spider roll, the soft shell crab looked off and old. I have never seen it look off and brownish in the center; this made me very uncomfortable so I did not even finish it. My boyfriend was mildy amused by the meal, because it simply just was not up to par with other sushi restaurants we have been too all around the Chicagoland area. This place is nothing to rave about, and there are many other places I will go to get sushi instead.  The service was great !

I finally decided upon it for date night on a Tuesday evening, approximately around 8pm. It was busy around this time and the wait was around 20 minutes. I enjoyed most of the rolls we ordered and there was really only one I didn't particularly enjoy. Staff was friendly and attentive, making sure to return to our table to take more orders once we had finished a plate. My biggest and probably most relevant complaint would be the temperature. The place had to have been 55 degrees and this caused me to find it difficult to enjoy my food. I understand that this is likely due to keeping the sushi chilled and fresh, but it seemed really extreme at the time and rendered both of us uncomfortable.

The AYCE menu offers an array of sushi pieces and rolls, and even some appetizers. You will out a sheet indicating what you want and then you turn it in to the waiter. 10 minutes later, your food comes out on a plate. They do caution that if you don't eat all of your food, you will be charged for the rest. We started off with some shumai. I was expecting dim sum shumai so I was very surprised. I ordered four rolls and assumed I could eat a lot more since I usually do, but the plate was huge and I could barely finish. The shrimp tempura roll was delicious and comes with tobiko, cucumber, and avocado. Next was the palatine roll, which comes with salmon, eel, avocado and cucumber. The last roll I remember was the spicy tuna roll, which only came with rice and tuna.  The fish was very fresh and the value that you get is great. I would compare this to Lawrence FIsh Market. For $20 after tax and tip, I usually can stuff myself with a variety of deluxe rolls if I'm sharing with friends at Lawrence Fish Market.

Our server and host were both professional, I would not describe them as overly friendly, but what the heck do I care? We don't have to be best friends, just serve me my food in a timely manner.

I'm pretty sure they added an extra log of rice to each sushi because every time we picked it up, the rice would break apart into two equal sized rice logs. The fish also tasted very fishy, a sign that it wasn't very fresh. Finally, at 10p they said they could not refill our tea because they were closing soon (the restaurant is open until 10:30p). If the service was better we would have had our tea refill earlier than 10p. It's not that hard to boil some water and add a tea bag anyway.

2016-04-10,1.0,"Sushi Para II used to be my go-to place for inexpensive and relatively good sushi and rolls.  They ""used"" to have a nice atmosphere (although always busy), friendly service, and $18 all you can eat sushi/rolls which even included apps.  The only requirement is and was that you finish what you order, or they charge you have to pay for what you eat.  Since I was in there often, there were times when I couldn't quite finish my plate, but they were always really nice about it and tended to look the other way.  Times have (and always do) change however... Sushi Para II is now on their 3rd location, all within 10 feet of the first.  Since they have moved to their new location, it seems like corners are now being cut wherever possible.  My girlfriend and I thought we'd go back to an old hangout for some good, inexpensive sushi.  At first impression going into the new location, upon opening the door, we got a HUGE stench of bad seaweed and fish.  It was almost unbearable.  I thought we'd still bear the stink...because all you can eat good sushi for 18 bucks would be worth it... To my slight disappointment, they raised their price from $18 for the all you can eat to $20.95.  But hey, it's been a while, there's inflation, I can understand.  Ok, so we do the $21 all you can eat.  First bad experience was the edamame.  Although some restaurants serve cold edamame, this one was supposed to be hot, but came out just luke warm at best.  We told the waiter and he took the edamame back and returned in literally under a minute with the exact same edamame, which was hot yes, but tasted old and chewy, clearly indicating that he just microwaved it and returned it to us.  Shame on you Sushi Para II!   The sushi and rolls came out and was definitely sub-par.  They were small (which to an extent they always have been) but far worse the rice was old and getting hard, and the fish didn't taste all that fresh.  We ate what we could, and had some leftovers that we didn't like... and this is where the friendly atmosphere that I used to know vanished before my eyes.  Our waiter was INSISTANT that we eat every bit or pay a penalty price.  I looked at him, said that we would eat it, and the moment he walked away, scooped the remaining bits into a napkin and discarded it.  I understand that they have their rules, but no need to be so insistent on them, especially for just remaining few bits.  After paying the check, my girlfriend excused herself from the table to use the restroom, and while walking to the restroom was stopped by the hostess, who told her that the restroom was for customers only and she couldn't use it.  She pointed to our table and said that we were sitting right there, which granted her access.  The fact that the hostess didn't even know who was there and had to stop a customer from using the toilet is just rude and embarrassing. We reluctantly paid our check, and while walking on the street, still reeking of bad seaweed and old fish said to each other that we will never do that again.  It's a shame that such a great place that I have such fond memories of, ended up going so downhill.  I used to recommend this place to all my friends, but now it will be the exact opposite.  If you end up trying it, I hope your experience is better, but we will not be returning again.",0.9324,0.779,0.12,0.101,0.48726675623227345

Occasionally not all of the items you ordered are included on the plate that is eventually served, usually the second round has significantly more rice in the rolls and of course the instrumental Carpenters music playing. Where I draw the line is the offensive odor that is wafting through their new location. I didn't realize the ""II"" in their name stood for ""number 2,"" if you catch my drift... To me it smelled like a sewage issue, to others at the table it smelled like bad fish. Neither was preferable. When I called to complain about the experience, the hostess replied, ""You were here for 2 hours. Imagine how we feel smelling it all day!""  Hoping they get their act together and figure out the issue, whether it's the building or something else. Until then, I'll hold off on my all-you-can-eat sushi urges.",0.4389,0.865,0.082,0.053,0.34957912457912454

When we realized what had happened, we called the next morning to point out the restaurant's oversight and lack of transparency, but the manager insisted it was our fault and nothing could be done after the 14 hours since we had dined there (not even reversing the charges for the extraneous tip).

It was one of the worst experiences in my life both for the service and for how the managers treated us, as if we were stupid to not understand.  Food there is ok! It is not bad but not great.

2015-06-21,4.0,"Craving Sushi and you don't want to spend a lot of $$$? Sushi Para is our go to inexpensive, sushi restaurant. We've been coming here for the past few years and decided to bring my mom for her very first experience eating REAL sushi. My mom was hesitant to try sushi, she bought some of those California Crap Rolls at her local grocery store. I told her, that's not REAL sushi, you've got to try real sushi! So, she said ""yes"" and we made online reservations. Love the fact you don't have to waste time calling a restaurant directly, you can book online ;).  I wanted to make a great impression on my mom and had to get ""the boat"". This is a wooden vessel which can accommodate 12+ rolls and and serves no purpose at all, it's just a cool way to serve sushi. Like most sushi places, Sushi Para is BYOB and doesn't charge a corkage fee. Today, we just ordered the green tea.  Upon the boat's arrival with our assortment of rolls, we all hungrily grabbed and immediately started chomping away. IDK why, but we always eat sushi really fast, it's not going anywhere but, we can't get enough of it. Good news: my mom now loves Sushi! Guess we'll be bringing her back when she visits us again. 3 Good Things about Sushi Para II: 1. Sushi Para's location on Clark Street moved 2 buildings north of their old location. It is larger and can accommodate more tables. 2. It is an All You Can Eat Sushi restaurant for a flat charge: $20 for Lunch, dinner is maybe $2-$3 more. 3. Celebrating a special occasion? It's ok to bring your own cake.  It's not the best Sushi restaurant in Chicago but, for the price, location, Sushi Para II delivers consistent friendly service and delicious Sushi!",0.9899,0.824,0.14,0.036,0.4391106442577031

Request for boat was ignored (damn).  Also, saw another table got several ice creams and candles for a birthday. Since we were there celebrating a birthday as well, we asked the waitress if we could do that as well. She had to ask the manager and then brought out one mochi for our table of 12. No candle. So we blew out the whipped cream.  Overall an ok experience.  Bonus for actually reading this far: the women's bathroom has two toilets placed next to each other without a stall or anything separating them.

It still took 50 minutes for us to receive our order, which came out after parties which arrived after ours, and was not the entire order we had placed (our server cut down our order size unbeknownst  to our party). We wanted to place an additional order immediately knowing the long prep time but we were told we could not order more until we finished the first platter. We easily did and ordered more which our server told us she would not place the order as it was too large (it would have been an additional 8 pieces per person and our first order only provided 6 pieces per person, nothing astronomical by any measure). We cut our order down and waited another 45 minutes for food. I would have placed another order for more sushi but the kitchen had closed by the time we saw our waitress again.",0.4875,0.914,0.05,0.035,0.5374915208248543

Ambiance: friendly and casual, it was quite loud when we went. The place is kind of small so it was hard to squeeze through with 15+ people, but they managed it, somehow! We had a table in the back to ourselves so it was nice that were weren't being completely obnoxious to other customers. (:  Sushi: AYCE so we had a little of everything! Going to be honest, I didn't expect a lot since it is AYCE sushi and I noticed that most of the staff was Chinese (not being racist, I promise, just an observation from a fellow Chinese person) but for that price the quality was not terrible. I thought the fish seemed a little older and warm, but they were really busy that night and we had a HUGE table so can not really judge them for that. So-so sushi. Staff: They were super nice to us and accommodating , especially since we had the largest group of people. We had some Chinese speakers at the table that really helped make the communication flow better between the staff which was a plus for us. They kept trying their best to find the right rhythm to bring out the sushi so that we weren't sitting long periods without food, even though they were packed with other customers as well.

While waiting, I attempted to pick up my glass of water and it accidentally slipped out of my hands and the water was on the table, but the majority of the water was in a puddle by my feet. I quickly used the napkins on the table to clean and dry the table and my husband went up front to the host to tell him to get a mop because there was too much water for the few napkins we had to dry the floor. He proceeded to give my husband two napkins and the waitress used two paper towels to wipe up the mess, but that amount of water needed to be removed with a mop. I went into the ladies room and got several paper towels to try and dry the floor because they didn't seem to care and never got a mop. After the third time of going in to the ladies room to get paper towels to dry the floor, as I am drying the floor I see a COCKROACH crawl past my fingers. THAT WAS IT!!!!!

Orders are placed by checking off items on a menu then handing it off to the waitress. Sounds simple enough, eh? The first round of orders came quickly and was quickly devoured. To my pleasant surprise, the presentation was very visually appealing and everything tasted great! My only complaint was the slight warm temperature of the nigiri.  The 2nd and third round of orders took wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too long.  I am very forgiving of the service during a rush hour but the restaurant was pretty empty. I was enjoying the company of my friends so I was not timing how long it took from placing the order to receiving the food. I imagine it took nearly 30 minutes for the 2nd round of orders to arrive and even longer for the third. We flagged down the waitress twice asking about our order missing order. One of the other waitresses even asked us if we were finished because we were sitting at a sushi-less table.

We deliberated going to House of Sushi and Noodles, but the area there isn't the prettiest, while this was in LP.  We were seated immediately on a Saturday afternoon around 1PM and were excited to start eating. I was so surprised that they served nigiri since that stuff tends to be too expensive to be on a buffet menu. I pretty much tried every roll with my favorites being anything with the shrimp tempura. Everything served was fresh and prepared cleanly, and the buffet menu was a pretty decent size offering quite a few specialty rolls along with normal ones.  I would've given this place five stars based off value and taste, but the wait time between our first and second orders was like 20 minutes which was crazy considering our first plate took around 10. Maybe they were trying to get the food in my belly to tell my brain I was getting full so I'd have to pay for the extra pieces left (the last few pieces were a definite struggle).

The hosts are very courteous and try to seat you as soon as they can. The first time my boyfriend and I were on a date and were offered to sit at the bar which not only was a great experience watching the chefs make sushi with lightening speed and precision but we also got 10% off our bill! The second time we took advantage of the BYOB and went with some friends and accidentally stayed past closing time. The waitresses didn't even politely ask us to leave. We realized how late it was because someone got a phone call!  And the food is really amazing. They don't try to  heat you by serving huge rice balls with a little best of fish.

There weren't a lot of customers. But it was quite obvious that the sushi chef/workers know the two/three girls sitting behind us (If not, they were trying to flirt with those girls, which is more disturbing.) Anyways, our food came. For starters, we ordered a few by the piece sushi(unagi, salmon, white fish, etc) and two rolls (dragon and California). It all came on a huge white plate.  Hmmm. Let's see. Pieces of the sushi rolls were falling apart even before we started to pick it up with our chopsticks. The rice was hard and they barely gave us any fish. I eat a lot of sushi, and I could tell that the chef rushed our orders. It's either that OR the chef was not well trained. Either cases was a bit upsetting.

So the positives are that it's under $20 for AYCE sushi, the quality of the fish was pretty good (no fishy taste, not still frozen), it's BYOB (though we didn't take advantage of that), and it seems like a nice place to come and spend an evening with friends and family.  The downside is they use way too much rice to try to fill you up. We only ordered nigiri (especially after seeing someone else with rolls that were mostly rice) but even those were made with too much rice. I got the sense there were two chefs working, since some of the nigiri came to us looking almost normal, where some pieces had way more rice than they should have. I guess you just have to rely on luck to get sushi from the chef who uses the right amount of rice! It was also fairly busy, so it took a while for each of our orders to get to us. I'd recommend ordering a lot to start and then order your next round before you've finished the first. Service was friendly, though sometimes it took a while for the waitress to get to us (we were in the downstairs part of the restaurant, which seems to be a secondary seating area when upstairs is full).

I agree, buffet style sushi is gross, but here it's not like its sitting under a lamp and people are helping themselves, it's made on the spot and served right away. Remember, the day you choose to go eat sushi is also important!  Never go on Sundays -- that will probably be the least fresh that sushi will get. Thursday nights are amazing. The catch will usually be super fresh. Fridays are nice too as the turnover rate of the fish is much higher so you won't be eating any salmon that has been sitting for any long period of time. The staff can sometimes be the only problem. Last time we went we had to go to the counter to pick up our check because the girls were too busy chatting.

However since I did, I can tell all future prospective customers that there are definitely better places out there. The quality of fish can barely pass as being sushi grade, and came very warm. The service was disorganized and lacking energy. One of the servers came up to us in the middle of the meal and tried to communicate that they charged for any left over sushi and also any leftover rice. After I had explained that the sushi just had too much rice and I had eaten it with 3/4 of the rice it came with, she outright told me that they charge for sashimi and that I had ""better finish"" the rice.?? Confused? So was I. If a customer is trying their best but the food is not settling well, it would be nice to be accommodating, and ask reasons why, not tell your customers to finish every last piece including a few bits of rice. It wasn't like we were there deliberately trying to waste food (wasting is a nono), but if it doesn't taste right how else should I go about it? I did leave a constructive comment on the receipt. Oh, and the sushi chefs, they are not authentic or at least produce do not produce authentic Japanese food to say the least. I am from Toronto and the worst ayce is better than this joint here.

For only $18.99, you can you choose from appetizers, maki rolls, and nigiri. They have an excellent list of creative rolls with unique combinations and textures. My favorite is the Michigan roll which is basically a spicy tuna roll with tempura chips and the Mountain Roll which has tuna, cucumber, and avocado smothered in a spicy mayo. Even though it's a buffet, the quality still stands. The fish is at the right temperature and texture of the rice is almost spot on. They also don't hold back on the cuts of fish for the nigiri. Half of my order consisted of tuna, white tuna, and eel. Normally, these cuts of sushi sell for around $3 a piece so I got my money's worth just from the nigiri.

If you come here, come here for the all you can eat sushi.  At $18.99  (as of yesterday) it's definitely worth it even if you only get a few rolls.  While the appetizers aren't the best or the most varied, the rolls on their AYCE menu definitely make up for it.  Sushi Para doesn't suffer from the ""lots of rice"" syndrome or ""they all taste the same"" affliction that many sushi AYCE restaurants suffer.  They had a good fish to rice ratio, and the rolls are flavorful! Service was fairly friendly and quick.  I had a question about some of the tuna (I'm not very fish aware and it had a little sheen to it), but the waitress assured me it was freshly delivered that day and even double checked with the chef for me.  And once I knew it was fresh I went ahead and ate it.  As my friend said, I eat by faith, not by sight.

Rolls: Variety is there on the menu but of the 7-8 we tried, there wasn't anything that stood out. Flavors are a little bland, no punch. The spicy tuna had little heat, avocado overload in one roll, and just generally the rolls lacked savory tastiness.

Here are some of my favs: 1) spider roll 2) green dragon roll 3) shrimp tempura roll 4) potstickers 5) kara age (fried chicken) 6) shiu mai 7) tamago nigiri 8) salmon nigiri It might sound a bit pricey but if you can eat a lot or at least two or three rolls, you definitely will get your money's worth! We stayed for about 2 hours chatting and allowing ourselves to digest before going back for more. The service was awesome and everything came out pretty quick! We never felt rushed or were made to feel guilty for asking for more food. If you can't make it to this location, there are others in the city as well!

2012-06-27,4.0,"Food: The sushi is very good! If you like spicy tuna, try the mountain roll! It is one of my favorite rolls ever  and is much better than a regular spicy tuna roll. American dream roll is also a great roll to try.  -For apps, get the yaki chicken and the gyoza, yum! Service: Let's be honest, the food is great but if you're looking for 5-star service, this is not the place for you. Some of the servers don't speak the most amazing English and because it's all you can eat, the 10-15 minute wait times they say are usually pretty unrealistic.  -Go during non-peak times, expect to wait at dinner time, or do the awesome take out special and eat at home (3 rolls, 2 pieces, and an app for $18). Making a reservation for big groups doesn't necessarily mean you will actually be sat at that time p.s.

It's all you can eat for $18.99, which includes sushi rolls, nigiri, miso soup, some salads, and some entrees.  As far as all you can eat goes, this is the best place I've ever been to.  Figuring I always get my money's worth, I rarely go anywhere else for sushi.  I would say that getting my money's worth only works when I'm with a group of people.  When it's just me and another person, only a few sushi rolls are consumed, but when it's a large group of people, we order A LOT of sushi.  My friends agree that this is a great place to go for sushi, so going with a group is never a problem.   This place is BYOB- there's a liquor store down the street. Reservations recommended for groups over 6. Sometimes there's a wait, but for 80% of the time I've not had to wait to be seated.   There is also a Sushi Para in Palatine, IL, and a Sushi Para D on Diversey not too far from Sushi Para II.  I prefer Sushi Para II over the other two.   My favorite is the salmon nigiri. yum :q I usually recommend this place to out of town friends, even those who've experienced sushi in Tokyo, and have not yet heard negative feedback from them :-)  Hope you enjoy it too!",0.9944,0.788,0.212,0.0,0.5996031746031747

2012-06-13,3.0,"Made a reservation at this restaurant for my boyfriend's birthday dinner last week and the reason we chose Sushi Para ll was for their unbeatable ""all you can eat sushi"" deal and quite possibly well-known in Chicago because of that. There were some good rolls and some not quite up to my standard. I'm not a fussy eater and I wouldn't dare admit to being one. But putting fussiness aside, I can very well differentiate my past and current food experiences. I have the tendency to compare restaurants, particularly the same type of meals I order. Nonetheless, I will say that my overall dining experience at Sushi Para ll was satisfactory and worthy of another visit in the future... for the good price and amount of sushi I can stuff in my belly :P About the food: The eel, salmon and fish egg rolls tasted pretty good, but the other rolls were just ""meh"". One of the factors has got to do with wrapping the contents with too much rice around it. Not only did it look unappealing, it was falling apart right when I try to lift it up with my chopsticks. Weirdly enough, they were generous about overflowing the fish eggs on the rice but not with the other less costly fish like tuna (the mashed up ones).",0.924,0.869,0.099,0.032,0.45634920634920645

It leaves you tasting the fish too. The place is pretty spacious but feels vey different as compared to the place when they were located downstairs. I guess it is the walls.  The last time I went they did not have a limit on how many rolls and pieces you can order. But if you order from the buffet menu, you better eat what you order or they charge per piece.

It's all you can eat sushi, where you order some, and then can order more, all for one price. The price at this place is $18, and is not worth the money. They have this crazy policy that says if you order too much sushi, and don't finish it, you have to pay extra money; a fine, if you will.  I don't need this stress in my life. I find that I'm afraid to order another roll, because I might not finish, and will be scolded by the server.  I would rather not go to a place where the food is mediocre, and I have to worry about not finishing my food. I feel like a little kid afraid to be yelled at by her mother.

Sushi Para II and Sushi para M is my friends go to spot when we have  group of people that just really crave sushi.  Worst experience here ever. Now I don't know if it was because they were super busy or whether it was the mix of my group that gave us this type of service. Just went here to celebrate my girl friend's birthday with 5 other girls. Upon entry we were told wait time is 45mins -1hour. That's fine with us we waited around . However, there were groups of people that walked in and just sat down once the table was cleared. Strike 1, okay this might be because they have a reservation, I'll let that slide.  After 45 minutes we ask about how much longer. The hostess points to a specific table and said we were waiting for that one table to leave. No, even if other tables cleared up we can only get that one table -Strike 2 maybe it was reservations again idk. fine  We finally sit down and order, two of us opt for no buffet so we went ahead and ordered first while the others mulled out the buffet items they wanted. As we are sitting there I see a roll that I ordered and its just sitting there by the bar. I wonder if that was mine, it looks just like the one I ordered. 10 minutes pass. A waiter finally picks that up and oh wait there's a table that needs to be cleared first. He puts it back down and picks up materials to clear and reset the table first. (Note there was nobody waiting for a table at this point)  few minutes later, I finally get the roll that by now is just been sitting there for 10+ minutes. I attempt to pick it up and on look it falls right apart. My younger cousins can make tighter sushi than this. The volcano roll was salter than any I've ever had and definitely not as fresh as usual. Alright so its an off day for sushi, let's give the dessert a try to make myself feel better.  Tempura ice cream = breaded ice cream. I've had tempura ice cream before and tempura is very little. This was seriously like a ball of bread with a small scoop of green tea ice cream inside. Not to mention whip cream must be on sale cuz there was a ton of that and flour. Ice cream? Not so much.

Went for lunch to make sure that it wasn't too crazy.  Staff was efficient, but taciturn, so can't really call them friendly.  We started off with the miso soup (pretty standard, but I've never had a standout miso before), the house salad (nice and gingery with a good amount of ginger pulp, not overly sweet and orange like most places) and the shumai (frozen, but still good.) Let's move on to the sushi.  Thought the shrimp tempura roll was fantastic, though I prefer mine to be wrapped in soy paper instead of seaweed.  Didn't bother with California roll, because that's like eating bread at a buffet.  Ordered several of the nigri pieces like the tamago (sweet egg omelette), crab stick, tuna, masago (flying fish roe) and ebi (shrimp).  They were well done, and I love masago, so having all you can eat of those was a dream come true.  We also had the spicy tuna roll, which was great. All in all, a pretty good experience and I'd visit again. Just be careful that you don't overorder.  Whatever you don't eat, you get charged for. So when my friend decided he didn't want the rice in the nigri pieces, things got a little pear-shaped for me.  As in my vision from stuffing myself with sushi rice.  As well as my figure, also from stuffing myself with sushi rice.   Definitely feel like we got our money's worth.  Now it's time for a nap.",0.9973,0.732,0.247,0.021,0.6037037037037037

For around 20 bucks, they have all the normal rolls (spicy tuna, volcano, etc), nigiri, and fried appetizers/salads. I knock a few stars off, however, for the classic yet greedy AYCE gimmick they pull. As soon as you start the first few rolls, they'll start to bring out orders muuuccch slower (around 20-30 min for our second batch of rolls), pack the rice in more dense by adding vinegar and squishing it in, and making that mound of rice bigger in volume.  Don't get me wrong, I totally get them wanting to make money (for example, the eat it or pay for it rule is totally legit), but this is something that has gone overboard in many AYCE sushi places.

2011-11-26,1.0,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE ONE ON CLARK, NOT FOR THE OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE CITY. This place has been kind of the convenient fallback for my boyfriend and me when we want AYCE sushi but don't feel like traveling to one of our favorites in the suburbs and just want to stick with the classics. Whenever we've gone, the service has been fine, though not spectacular. They've sometimes left off items from our AYCE checklist, but we usually just made up for it with the next order, and all was well. The last time we were there, which was just a couple of days ago, the experience sunk my regard for the place like a rock. We showed up around 7ish, maybe about 7:10, and the guy (I assume he was the manager because he was the only one who spoke pretty competent English) told us it would probably be a ""10-15 minute"" wait. There were already some people in front of us, and the manager said there was a reservation. Personally, I was bit puzzled because I don't remember Sushi Para II ever taking reservations, but whatever. I wasn't first in line, so no biggie. I went ahead and sat down in a chair right by the counter, but my boyfriend remained standing and within sight of the manager.  10-15 minutes ticked by, and in that time more customers came in, and the manager kept telling them he was waiting for a reservation to come in. People asked if they needed to put their name in. He said no, just wait, and he'll call them in. If they had to wait outside, he would step outside to call them to their table. At 7:45, I overheard him call a party who had a reservation for 7:30 and they told him they'd be there in a couple of minutes. Personally, I think if they were already five minutes late, he should have canceled their reservation and started seating the people who'd been waiting for a while. Keep in mind that at this point, we'd been waiting about a half hour.  Around 7:50, a lady and her friend who came in after us checked with the manager and politely asked if they should put in their name. In a rather loud and rude tone, the manager shoved a paper and pen at her and said, ""Here, you want to put your name in?! You want to?! I TOLD you I will let you know when it's your turn!"" Good golly. The lady remained calm and said, ""Okay, can you just let us know about how long we'll be waiting?"" He said, ""You're next, about 5-10 minutes."" At this point, my boyfriend spoke up because they had come in AFTER us, and of course, our wait by this point had been nearly 45 minutes. The guy said we'd be next, in...wait for it...10-15 minutes. Heck no. Our first 10-15 minutes had turned into 45 minutes. Even some people standing next to us wondered what the deal was because they remembered that we'd been before some others who were being seated. So my boyfriend went ahead and called another Sushi Para location, and they said they had lots of open tables, so we just bailed. We warned a few others on our way out that they better stick their faces in there if they wanted to have a chance at a table.  After this experience, I don't want to waste my time with Sushi Para II anymore. There are other locations (M & D, to name two) that have the exact same menu and better service. I'm sure Para II won't hurt without my business and there'll be plenty of other customers who'll keep it alive and well. But that was just it for me. The fact that the food isn't that spectacular to begin with and that they mix up our orders already made it kind of subpar in our mind. But to be treated in such a way and to see the manager (or at least a person who's supposed to be polite) treat others so poorly...just killed this location for me.  It was a good run, Para II. Good luck.",0.9907,0.846,0.106,0.048,0.42461843711843716
2011-11-21,4.0,"FEW IMPORTANT POINTS: 1. AYCE dinner is around $20. Lunch is a few $ less but less variety in rolls. I'm as cheap as cheap can get, and I still think the dinner is the better value. The lunch menu lacks a lot of roll variety (like no soft shell crab roll). 2. The rice/sushi ratio is very good for an AYCE place. There are a few pics showing rolls with a ton of rice, but my friends and I have never had that experience. I didn't feel that the rolls were artifically inflated with rice at all. Maybe 10-15% more rice than normal at most. 3. Sashimi is not included in the AYCE price. Yes, I'm bummed as well, but not unexpected. 4. Basic nigiri is included in the AYCE price. Yay!! This makes this place a winner in any AYCE sushi'er's book. 5. BYOB I really like this place. It serves a lot of basic rolls and maybe a few slightly creative ones. The amount of rice/fish ratio is very good. This place isn't gonna win any awards for best sushi or most creative presentation.

Dishes did not come out as advertised: my tuna salad was drenched in sauce to cover up the fact that it was fish on a bed of iceberg lettuce. The miso soup, I will give them, was decent. The real problem arose when the bill came. Now granted, we were a larger group, but we were all well aware of what we ordered. When the bill came, it had extra items. Most of them were taken off without extra fuss, but the manager was very dead set that we ordered an extra tempura roll. We argued with the manager who then said that they would watch the surveillance camera to determine who was correct. Who does that? If we ordered our food, we would pay for it.

Jerry M and I were looking for a sushi place with a nice lunch special and settled on Sushi Mon. Discovering - on my way to said lunch - that I overlooked the fact they only do lunch on Fri/Sat, we ended up at Sushi Para II. SPII was on our original list of lunch contenders, but not near the top; in the past I've found it immemorable. I had not been to Sushi Para II since they moved upstairs; the new location is nice and roomy, much nicer than their old basement spot. The signage is a little confusing, it's easy to think they're still located in the basement.  SPII has three lunch specials; $15.99 AYCE sushi, sushi combos, and a menu of hot dishes, the latter two deals are served with miso soup. There are 4 or 5 different sushi lunch specials ranging from $9-14; they consist of varying combinations of maki and nigiri or sashimi. The maki included in the lunch special is more than your typical spicy tuna and california rolls; as a whole, the sushi lunch special menu is a decent selection of both sashimi/nigiri and maki. I went with the 2 maki special for $8.99, opting for Christmas and spicy salmon rolls. The rolls were well prepared, no issues with them falling apart this go round and they weren't skimpy on the fish or too overloaded with rice.  There isn't much of a lunch crowd here, which is nice. We were seated immediately and not rushed through our meal.  I'd definitely pop in here again for lunch, plenty of options and a good deal for the price.",0.9855,0.822,0.134,0.044,0.5496753246753247

As for the sushi, this is where I was the most impressed.. the cut of their nigirizushi was pretty big, and their rolls, while nothing terribly special, were all good.  The fish all seemed very fresh and good, too.  If I could do things over, I definitely would have eaten more nigiri, less maki!!

Probably not worth the salad either but do as I say and not as I do, hah.  - order only about 2 rolls max to start, plus nigiri, they give you less rice this way.  - remember you can always order more! Nothing worse than ordering too much to start and looking at your still half-full plate 30 minutes later and hating yourself.  - get everyone at your table to order AYCE because then it's a group effort and you can sneak bits you can't finish on to your friends' plates.  I love the rolls here on the AYCE selection, and any of the incarnations with salmon, eel and tempura crispies make me happier than is probably appropriate. They also use quality fish, especially for this price point, which is great as about half of my meal is salmon nigiri. Service here is fast and friendly and at a place like this it's always a nice bonus when I feel like the waitstaff aren't judging me for ordering my third round.

2010-09-12,4.0,"I think the majority of people who had a bad experience, did so because they wanted their cake and they wanted to eat it, too.  The quality of this sushi was excellent. On the AYCE list, things like rainbow rolls, softshell crab rolls, etc. require fish that you can't skimp on, and I never encountered a roll that was subpar.  I'm not sure if people like what they ordered, but anyone claiming food poisoning is probably mistaken, especially if you haven't given it a good 24 hours to process in your system. Also, it just seems likely that if you are STUFFING yourself with food, you might feel sick.  Service-wise, I was unimpressed. The staff is not very communicative due to whatever reason, but everything I ordered along with the other two guests I was with (who did NOT get the AYCE sushi) came out accordingly.  On that note, they have a GREAT list of Japanese hot food that is seemingly ignored. My mom got the beef negimaki (rolled steak and green onion), some gyoza, and tempura. They were all delicious and having been to Japan, I can say that they were pretty close, at least for the American palate. I'm not really sure why there is so much hate for this place on here. My advice to anyone going to Sushi Para II is to 1) know what you are ordering, 2) know your limits (you are charged for left over food, which I think is a good thing to limit waste), and 3) take your time as the food is made to order.

The rolls have much more rice than most sushi I've had, no doubt to fill you up faster, but to complain about that would be overly gluttonous.

Of course, this means that there is much better quality sushi in Chicago (I've liked Mirai, Ai and Friends) but this is the largest amount of decent sushi + appetizers you can get for 18 bucks. I went with my significant other without a reservation on Saturday at around 7:30 and sat at the upstairs sushi bar. The best part about sitting at the bar was that the waitstaff/chefs never forgot about us and we got our orders very quickly. We ordered the miso, the gyoza, and seaweed salad, all decent. Then we ordered roll after roll. They were all pretty good, although the Rock n Roll was pretty memorably savory. What separates this from House of Sushi, probably its biggest budget AYCE competitor, is the comprehensive menu and the ease of ordering. There is much more stuff at Para, including nigiri and a wide assortment of appetizers. Plus, there are more maki rolls to choose from. Additionally, to place your order you, you just check off on a list how many of what you want. At HoS, you must order two maki rolls at a time, no more, no less, which makes your stay at HoS much longer than it really needs to be.

My biggest problem was the fact that I had to reorder Nigiri several times, and rolls.  With the inattentive waitress this became a problem.  Definite vanishing server syndrome (puts the food down and turns to run before you can get a word out) I could understand if the place was hopping, but it was a pretty relaxed night.  Big minus for me. Because of the closeness to the zoo and DePaul you'll get a cross section of the two.  Families coming in for post zoo food, and students done with class for the day were at every other table on my visit.

As somewhat of a regular at House of Sushi (and Noodles) on Belmont, I hoped to one day try this place that includes nigiri and appetizers with its buffet. The rumors told the truth. So after meeting my group of friends who also enjoy large quantities of sushi, I promptly order 3 appetizers, along with a couple of rolls. One friend almost immediately got her order of miso soup. Then, we waited a long time, perhaps due to one friend's order of 5 rolls. Eventually, two friends got plates of sushi they ordered. Shortly after, I got one appetizer I ordered. After I got my rolls - almost as those 2 friends finished their plates, I asked about my other appetizers, and had to reorder.  Aside from the inclusion of appetizers and nigiri in the buffet, the other aspect people love about this place is the quality of the sushi. I found it find, but not exceptional. The egg sushi appeared brownish likely from overcooking, adding unnecessary dryness to the piece. The rolls with cream cheese contained too much for my friend's liking. She's the girl who usually claims Philadelphia as her favorite kind of roll. I loved the eel pieces and the crazy tuna rolls. Beware of the density (mayo base?) of the chef's special sauce.  Long story short, I really enjoyed the food and found the extra couple of dollars ($19 vs. $17) a good value for the additional types of food I could order, compared to House of Sushi. As indicated in that review, I especially enjoy the communal aspect and variety in maki there. At Sushi Para II, sushi is served on individual plates, which discourages the sharing so key to a sushi buffet, in my opinion.

We had to wait for approximately 30 mins, but from the looks of what people were ordering, I knew it was going to be worth the wait. We were finally seated at the bar, and quickly ordered (b/c we figured it would be an even longer wait for the food to come...considering the boat load of people in there).   I ordered a Sai salad  (which I think they forgot about) because it was after 15 minutes had passed and I reminded them that I ordered it when they remembered to bring it out. To my surprise, the salad was A LOT more shredded cucumber than seaweed. Still tasty, but a lil shabby on the seaweed. I also ordered a miso soup (b/c we were still waiting for our sushi) and I have to say that the soup was pretty bland. Out of fear of being charged, I slurped down the flavorless soup anyway. My husband and I ordered 4 rolls (to share) on the first round, and I have to admit, ALL were Deeeee-lish! We ordered the: Crazy Tuna Roll (super spicy) Volcano Roll Mountain Roll Chicago Roll For the second round, we ordered 3 more rolls (to share) Another Volcano Roll (yes, it was THAT good) World Series Roll Pop Up Roll But the time we were on the 2nd round....we were practically FORCING ourselves to eat the food. We were extremely stuffed. We eventually cleared our plates...but it wasn't without forced efforts. lol. I guess it didn't help that we were drinking our BYOB wine the entire time. The staff were super friendly, the atmosphere was casual, we definitely felt like we got our moneys worth...all in all, it was a great first AYCE sushi experience.

Why yes there is and it is called Sushi Para II.  It is located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago.  I have ventured to this place quite a few times to par take in the all you eat lunch and dinner special.  The dinner special runs roughly $20.00, which isn't bad, especially for all you can eat.  I know what you must be thinking, the quality of fish can not be that great. Well honestly I would have to say you are wrong!  The fish quality is well above par.  The roll selection given in the special is excellent.  The atmosphere is great.  The wait staff is helpful, however, there has been the occasional mix up with forgetting to bring out my beloved edamame.  But since I was already stuffed from all the other great food, I didn't mind.  Oh and yes I can't forget to mention my favorite...it is BYOB.  On another positive note, the restaurant finally just opened up the basement portion of the establishment thus making the wait on a Friday night not as unbearable.  As I am discovering here in Chi-town, they to do not take reservations for parties of 2, which I think is just unfortunate.  So if you are in the area or even if you aren't I would recommend giving this Chi-town eatery a try!

So in trying Sushi Para, I did not have high expectations (I've tried House of Sushi and Shiroi Hana before) and found myself very very pleasantly surprised at the quality and variety of sushi. This sushi buffet actually offers nigiri, not just massive rolls.  I started off with a miso soup. Yes, I know you are thinking why am i filling myself up with water when there is sushi to be eaten but if you know me, i need variety in my meals and can not fill up on only one item. I had also wanted the seaweed salad but they had run out for the night so I had some of my sister's edamame.  Both miso soup and edamame were good and left me craving for the main course: sushi! I started off with 3 pieces of salmon nigiri, pop up roll and crazy tuna roll. Wow, the salmon is surprisingly fresh and tasty. Yum on the nigiri. Popup roll sounded fantastic: spicy salmon, crab, shrimp, avocado and cucumber with tempura flakes on top but the actual taste was lacking.  A lot of items but not much flavor and it ended up being quite bland and just kind of blah. Maybe it was an off night? I definitely did not taste any spicy salmon.  The crazy tuna however was absolutely delicious - peppered tuna with avocado with seared tuna on top. Double Yum on this roll.  My sister ordered spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and shrimp tempura roll.  All looked delicious but I was too involved with my own plate to try hers out. In deciding what to order next, the waitress told us it was ""last call"" as they were closing up shop so we ordered 5 more salmon nigiri to share and i added in a pepper tuna + wasabi salad and a tamago nigiri (yes, i also wanted to fill up on egg... but i love tamago!).  Pepper tuna salad was pretty good but nothing to rave about. I do not think I'll order this again - rather try to stuff in a few more pieces of the crazy tuna roll. Tamago was sweet and not overcooked, wish I had room to eat more than 1 piece.  By the time we go to eating the salmon, we were so stuffed and wished they didn't stuff so much rice but still pretty darn good.  My sister and I had originally wanted to go to sushi para x (She's been to sushi para II before and wanted to try another location) but finding street parking on Diversey is horrendous! We each drove around for over 15 minutes with no luck.  This clark street location is slightly better (i found parking in 5 and she found in 10).

On the one hand, all you can eat can be exceptionally enticing but on the flipside, the sushi can be below par. Reading the various reviews spun my head, but the pictures looked good so I decided, ""Why not?"" Why not wasn't a bad idea, but when I got to Sushi Para II, there was no sign directing me to go upstairs. Instead I go directly downstairs down the unshoveled and icy stairwell of DEATH! There at the bottom, I found the lights out and the doors were locked. Oh dear, did I stumble into the wrong place? Luckily a sign on the door in the bottom of the stairwell informed me to use the upstairs entrance, so I had to climb back up the icy stairwell of DEATH. Inside was a quaint sushi restaurant that was not too filled on this cold icy day. I ordered some tea and checked off some things off the menu and noticed that the roll selection was not all too deep with basic nigiri and a degree of maki rolls. The buffet menu had a few appetizers but none seemed too enticing so I ordered squid, shrimp, spicy salmon and octopus. The rolls came out shortly and tasted delicious. The ginger worked its magic and the squid was on point satiating my hunger. The rolls were a bit loose, making them somewhat harder to pick up. I liked everything I tried and the shumai had a bit too much garlic and ginger, but that is the way Japanese shumai tends to be. My great displeasure with Sushi Para II is the excessive amount of rice that arrives with every roll. If I wanted to eat that much rice, I could have just ordered a bowl of rice. Should every piece of nigiri come with a rice ball bigger than the piece of sushi is? Yep, it will save the restaurant some money by overloading on rice, but it will not do anything to impress me as a value proposition. I really felt like they were cheating, adding more weight to the ""sushi"" when it was actually just more rice. I hereby submit the motion that Sushi Para II now be dubbed Rice Para II.

The place is clean, koreans are behind the bar doing their thing, rollin' their rolls (at least I think they're korean), and you can bring your own booze. One time I ordered 5 rolls, oysters tempura, some salad, a bunch of pieces of nigiri and they didn't give me shit. Just told me not to pass the goods. They're trying to run a business and I get it. The quality of the fish is near top notch, and you won't get any better in Chicago unless you're willing to spend some serious cash. Serious cash. I don't have that serious cash so I go here. The miso is decent and not too salty like House of Noodles. Creative rolls. Way better rolls than the competition. Better than most of the ""upscale"" aka [some yuppie trying to con you] sushi places I've been to. This place is damn good. For those of you who think otherwise, keep your American arses in some place more deserving of your business like the Italian staples Olive Garden or Gino's East.  As for the atmosphere - It sucks when there are people waiting by your seat - annoying as hell. But when this place ain't busy, its a pleasure to dine there especially when you have the waitresses are singing along to Nickleback in their cute accents.

Since we had a lot of time, my crew headed to Urban Outfitters up the street.  As my luck is the way it is, I was in the fitting room when Sushi Para II called about a table opening.  Since I was partway into a tight pair of skinny jeans, I called the others on my phone and told them to head back to the restaurant.  When I finally got back into my regular clothes, I dashed over to Sushi Para as well.  Midway during my dash the dang restaurant calls me back asking where I am.  I told the girl that I was up the street (I mean UO is only a long block and then some from them, jeez.).  She kept saying something (I guess scolding me), but I couldn't understand what she was saying.  It's not like I was gone for two hours and they were holding a table forever.  Chill out. The food is so so.  Many of the rolls didn't have much variation.  The fish did not have much taste.  The rolls were not rolled tight enough.  Everything tasted similar.  By the way, the menu has a section entitled ""sushi or sashimi.""  I think they meant nigiri as all of this raw stuff is sushi.  The tables were crowded together.  I felt like we were sitting with other people and listening in on their conversations and vice versa.  We were right next to the bathrooms (a single facility per gender), which was only good for knowing when it was vacant.   All in all, I would only go back if I really wanted to eat a lot of cheap sushi that is just okay.  I would rather trek all the way to Schaumburg to get to Todai.",0.7114,0.922,0.046,0.032,0.4796997645211931

For the past several months, I've gone to other sushi places and I always find myself comparing them to Sushi Para II.  Seriously.  I always say things like ""I don't know, their volcano roll just wasn't as good as Para's..."" or ""This isn't as spicy as the rolls at Para II.""  Clearly, I've been in some serious denial for awhile because I just wouldn't admit to myself that Sushi Para II was my favorite.  But here I am, now, professing my love for the sushi on Yelp.  And that's what counts. Their all-you-can-eat menu is spectacular.  For $17.99 the selection is amazing.  There's at least 8 appetizers to choose from (edamame, gyoza, miso soup), tons of rolls and a really nice selection of nigiri.  The rolls aren't just the standard, ""cheap"" rolls that other happy hour sushi places serve (like California or Philly) - they actually have the more expensive rolls that are way fancier and require a lot more work (you know, the ones that are usually $12-$15).  You can order two or three rolls from the AYCE menu and you've eaten your $18 worth of sushi.  Add in a couple more rolls and some apps and you're golden.   The service is always quick and friendly.  Quick service = outstanding here since it's always packed.  People clearly love this place if they keep coming back.  I have waited at least 10 minutes almost every single time I've come here, so that's saying something about the demand.   Also, they've finally moved locations!  Sushi Para II used to be located in the tiny, lower level of a building on Clark.  It was kind of basement-esque and super, super small.  Like there may have only been eight or 10 tables total in the whole restaurant, most of which were for two-seaters.  However, their new space is nice, roomy and nicely decorated.  There is no more pushing awkwardly past tiny tables full of people to get to the bathroom - now there's tons of room and way more tables, so way less waiting.   And it's BYOB.  Always a plus in my book.

Those of you that have visited the restaurant prior to the new location must give it another shot.  The first two times I went, the fish to rice ratio was horrible. They used to put so much rice with their nigiri. The last time I went, which was just two days ago, the fish to rice ratio has improved. They did not put too much rice with their nigiri. I was very pleased with my visit.  The quality of their fish is above the ""all-you-can-eat"" standard. I was impressed by the variety. Their selection includes yellow tail and white tuna. =) I did not smell any 'fishy' smell when I ordered the Tuna or any other fish for that matter. I thought that the quality was fresh, and cannot complain about it. I don't consider myself to be a master-level fish critique but at the same time I don't consider myself to be a novice.  The environment has lively feel. Those of you that are looking for a quiet romantic ambiance may need to look elsewhere. The restaurant has greatly improved regarding cleanliness and decor. It has much better lighting, and the restaurant just seems more comfortable to sit in.  The service was where I was most impressed. Whenever we wanted to order, the waitress was always around to take our order. The waitress was not impatient, and we always got our sushi order in a very reasonable manner. I was actually surprised on how fast our order arrived being that the restaurant was completely full.  I can't think of any complaints that I might have.  The restaurant was clean, the food was good, and the service was great.  The price is not bad at all. Best in Chicago for ""all you can eat"" in Chicago, considering quality and service. $18 is a fair price. If perhaps 18 is too much, then you may opt for the lunch price for only $14.99.   One particular thing that brought much delight to our experience at Sushi Para Too was that they did not make or force us to finish our plate before we ordered another round. Again, props on the service.  My expectations are however relative to a Sushi restaurant that do all you can eat. Don't expect sushi restaurant extravaganza like the ones in Vegas or Japan. But expect to be satisfied in all areas that I have mentioned.  Don't criticize my review too harshly if you don't agree.  This review is only based on my last visit.

2009-11-14,3.0,"Sushi Para II has been on my ""To Try"" list for ages ever since my open call for places to add to my ""All-You-Can-Eat Sushi"" list, and today I figured we hadn't had Date Night in a while, so we'll try this place.  The majority of the 200+ reviews were a convincing argument and the mention of a ""larger space"" was what sealed the deal.  So I don't know about the restaurant's life underground, but here's my review of my first (and likely only) trip to Sushi Para II: We entered at 5:30pm, and there was already a line at the counter.  It took 5 minutes of standing there before anyone bothered to ask how many were in our party, and then tell us it'll be 2 more minutes.  A restaurant should ALWAYS have staff at the entrance, especially when it's notorious for having a wait - so names and parties can be written down ASAP and the we can move along and you can call when tables are ready. 2 actual minutes later, we were shown to our seats in the back.  Luckily the back area is not very loud, even though it's right by the kitchen and bathrooms (which each hold one person and I found magically have someone knocking on the door 30 seconds after you enter and lock the door) - but that means you are forced to overhear the conversations of those around you. Pray that you're seated next to interesting people.  We were unfortunately seated in the Pretentious Boring Yuppie Zone tonight. We were brought menus and the pink papers for filling out the buffet.  Once I touched one pink paper, the server silently grabbed the menus away and walked away.  Not that we WANTED to order a drink besides water, but the dignity of being asked would have been nice. Filled out the cards, and then it was time for the food.  This place gets a slight bump for treating separate cards separately.  Appetizers were brought out in combination for the table, but sushi orders on each card are brought on separate plates.  Makes identifying foods easier when you don't have to also guess who ordered what. Miso soup: average - hard to ruin and they thankfully didn't ruin it Gyoza: poor - hard to ruin and their ""homemade"" version meant it had indistinguishable items that weren't tasty in comparison to basic non-homemade gyoza Shumai: warning - these were not served very hot at all.  The rather-warm temperature raised a red flag in my mind. Spring rolls: worth trying - they did something weird and I think put the traditional dipping sauce INSIDE, leaving the texture inside kind of mushy and not BAD, just interesting and worth trying once Nigiri sushi: not bad quality at all, though I think there were two sushi chefs working that night and you could tell that different rounds of sushi were prepared by different chefs.  Sometimes my eel had a nice sauce and sesame seeds, sometimes just a scant drizzle of sauce and no sesame seeds. Maki sushi: same as above - sometimes my rolls were packed tight and small, sometimes they were larger and looser.  Same roll, different round, must have been a different chef. Rolls to try: I enjoyed anything that had spicy mayo sauce on it (like Mountain Roll), including the Volcano Roll that had a spicy chili sauce on it.  I also liked the Pop Up Roll with tobiko on top.  And the traditional rolls like Eel and Philadelphia were good, too. Rolls to maybe not try: I found the Fashion Roll difficult to eat due to a piece of tuna perched atop each roll that would fall off or otherwise hinder sushi enjoyment.  The American Dream Roll was a little too busy for my tastes and was prepared too large for each piece to comfortably fit in my mouth (and I've got a large mouth). It's an interesting concept they have for several rolls of ""instead of wacky ingredients in our sushi rolls, let's think outside the box and be pioneers of sushi ingredients placed OUTSIDE the roll.  It just isn't always a pleasant experience with every roll.  The traditional rolls are still good, guys - you don't have to push the limits too hard.  At least no rolls featured the dreaded American Cheese like some places we've been to. Additionally, I know that most AYCE Sushi locations have a litany of rules.  The servers at Sushi Para II were weird about it - the only rule being ""you pay for sushi leftover that you don't eat"" (printed on all the pink sheets).  Yet on one round, they tried taking away my plate while it still had sushi on it!  I had to stop her and grab it before she took it away!  Then at the end of the last round, when we said it was our last, they brought us the check and threatened me to eat it all. Well yea, I'm STILL EATING.  Maybe wait to bring the check until I'm DONE and you KNOW I've eaten everything or that you'll have to charge extra! All in all, nothing spectacular about this place to warrant another trip.  I've done it, I've reviewed it, and if given the choice, there are places that are closer and have spectacular offerings.  I wouldn't avoid Sushi Para II if I were asked to go, but I'm never going to volunteer heading here.",0.989,0.811,0.112,0.077,0.5040270064463613
2009-11-14,3.0,"Aaron S surprised me by meeting me at work tonight just as my drawer was being checked out, he was picking me up for one of our date nights. We haven't had one in a few weeks, so I was pretty excited.  His choice of place? Sushi Para II. Since we left, I have been trying to figure out how to rate the experience, and after thinking on it some, I have to say that this is a pretty weak three star place.  The first thing you notice is how tiny the restaurant is. Very tiny. That is not always a bad thing, but the set up was odd, and trying to have conversation was awkward  because I was hearing everyone else talk, and wondering if it went two ways. I also was really annoyed with the group that sat behind us, if you are rich enough to just happen to be carrying three thousand dollars in your pocket you really don't have any money issues to complain about okay?  One of the staff members sat us at our table and assumed that we were getting the AYCE option just because Aaron picked up that piece of paper. The other thing, we were not offered any drinks, at all, both of these things are rude, and you all should know how the saying about ASSuming things goes.... Anyway, first thing I noticed about the AYCE menu is that there was not a lot variety on it at all, not half the selection that other places offer. Not a huge deal, but it doesn't work in their favor either. We each had three rounds of food. We had, miso soup, gyoza, shumi, taki chicken, spring rolls, egg nigiri, eel nigiri,  eel roll, spider roll, mountain roll, fashion roll, volcano roll, American dream roll, philly roll,  and the pop up roll (I think that was all of it anyway...). The gyoza were very weird tasting, they had something in them that made them bitter tasting. Our shumi was kind of lukewarm and mushy. The spring rolls were different. The sweet sauce was on the inside, which made for a unique taste. None of the rolls really stood out though, and some of them would just fall apart when using the chop sticks. The worse part though? This is going to make me sound crazy, but you really cannot make this shit up, is that each order we put in was padded with more and more rice! Um i came to enjoy some sushi not to make my belly explode thank you very much. Service was horrid too. The lady asked us if we were going to order more or if we were done, we said that we were ready for the check. She came back with the check, and basically barked at Aaron about how he needs to finish what was on his plate.

Just FYI: although this place is all-you-can-eat, you will get charged if you leave a noticeable/significant amount of sushi left over.  So you better have a big appetite if you want the best bang for your buck.   The buffet allows you to order some of their sushi rolls, which were decent, and most of their sushi.  The sushi was decent in quality.  It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst I've had.  The only thing about this place is the wait.  Fortunately, my friend and I were able to get a seat but it definitely gets packed during the dinner buffet rush hour.

The first are the traditional or semi-traditional places where you order sushi and the chef immediately CUTS the fish up versus places that have all the fish pre sliced and ready to go, or even worse, pre- made in trays and they just lay it all out for people to touch and take.  Given that bias I hold against such sushi joints that slap fish on a ball of rice and call it cuisine, I was remarkably mollified by the service and treatment of food at this place. They made all the items that you wanted to order. And it if you stick with getting rolls instead of nigiri sushi, you really can't go wrong. They are very generous with the spider rolls, I actually found the spicy tuna to be nicely flavored.  The balls of rice underneath the nigiri sushi pieces were ridiculous and they have a rule that you have to eat all the rice or they charge you. So I would stay away from that.

Yes, it is located in a somewhat weird basement/garden level space, and the space isn't that large.  The bathrooms don't have the newest amenities, and the seats and tables won't remind you of eating at Alinea.  But it's not supposed to.  For those of you who have been to NYC to some of their sushi joints, you know that some of the BEST are in hidden little alleys.  Same can be said for sushi places in Osaka.  Yes, it may feel humid in there once in awhile, but get over it.  You're there to eat, not to sit around and primp. Yep, they have a threat that says, ""We'll charge you if you don't eat what's on your plate including rice.""  Not sure if they've ever had to enforce it, but usually the people I go with don't push their luck.  After going a few times, you sort of know your limit of # of rolls you can consume before that cutoff switch in your stomach goes, ""No mas.""   Lunch is cheaper by 5 -6 bucks a person, but dinner includes pricier rolls like the big salmon roe and more of the specialty signature rolls.  Think Chicago, Alaska, Volcano, Rainbow, etc. etc.  They also offer your traditional sushi joint fare.     The place is BYOB, and conveniently, there's a store about 3 blocks away that sells libations.  It's a great place to go with friends, provided you're not a group that expects this place to be like Sushi Samba.  It's a down to earth atmosphere to hang out with friends, laugh, and have a good time - not a swanky club where you eat like a princess because you're afraid to spill sauce on your knockoff blahniks.   Service is adequate.  They aren't the quickest, but they get things done.  If you don't mind hot green tea made of powder, then it's not that bad.  I have a slight advantage in that I can communicate with them in their native language, so I find them to be rather personable once you get them talking.   Others have alluded to additional buffet items at lunch and diner, and this is true: shumai, potstickers, veggie tempura, edamame, soup, and even salad are available under the umbrella price.",0.9919,0.828,0.135,0.037,0.4871560846560847

2009-06-15,4.0,"Currently, this is my favorite sushi place because of the perfect balance of affordability and tastiness. I believe Sushi is often over-priced for something really basic and easy to make because of it's trendiness. I refuse to even sit down at a place that would charge $4 for a single slice of unagi. I can get a sandwich for that much.  The cuts of fish here are a good size and I've never had them load me up on rice either as some other yelpers have complained about. (See my photo of the American Roll.) This may be because I've always gone when they haven't been too busy, ie: weekday nights, lunch-time on weekends. I can see how the chefs could start to get sloppy on the sushi-making close to closing time or during periods of high-volume diners. It makes sense that they could start to get a bit heavy-handed with the rice to try to satisfy the hoards of all-you-can-eaters.

My buddies from Chicago recommended this cause we're craving for sushi and we can eat ALOT, yet we're on a budget, so this is where we ended up.  Totally not bad at all, $17 for AYCE, I think that was like dinner price too, weekend probably be a little bit more, but who cares, you can order like crazy, just be sure to finish what you order, cause I heard from my friends we gonna get charged if we have a left-over. We ordered Unagi, Tamago, Inari, Spicy Tuna rolls, and many more. Everything is made to order, which is great, not like those Todai AYCE kind. Those peeps who like Shumai dumpling, they even have that as appetizer, we ordered like 2 dozens I think, my friend was so crazy about it, even tho it looked like those that you bought in the 99ranch store and heat them up urself. We ordered like 2 big plates full of rolls and sushis and we thought we're still hungry so we ordered the third round plate and we're stuffed when the plate was still half-empty. Oh No! So we started checking who ordered what and they had to finish it. One girl ordered a spicy tuna roll and she only ate 1 and she felt full, but she said, ""I can do this, I don't want to pay extra!!!"" She then started eating slowly, she looked like she's in pain. The rolls came in like 8 pieces, by the 7th piece, the waiter was ready to clean up the resto as it's closing time. She told us, "" no worries, if you can't finish, we won't charge extra.""

The sushi is very good and I've had sushi in all kinds of places all over the world. Some reviews point out they stuff more rice in their rolls which I have found to be entirely untrue. They don't charge very often either unless you are grossly blatant about not being about to finish your sushi which is easy to avoid as long as you get the $17.99 all you can eat and order in successive portions. I usually have no issues polishing off 2 large plates. The spider rolls are delicious and my favorite of any Japanese restaurant but usually anything with soft shell crab is quite pricey. Imagine my excitement when I found out you can have as many as them you could stuff your face with. As one reviewer pointed out, you'd be hard pressed to find another all-you-can-eat Japanese place and the price is beyond reasonable. The service isn't as attentive as maybe other restaurants but for the price? I can deal with having to actually wait a bit for my water or tea. Generally, the service is nothing to complain about.

You could probably tell the sushi wasn't fresh when it all arrived within five minutes of placing our order. The variety of appetizers was lacking, and overall was too much to handle. I always crave this type of buffet every few months or so, and then seriously regret it afterwards, when I feel constipated and just disgusting.

Tips:  Be creative and try all different kinds of app's, nigiri, and the specialty maki (suggested app: chicken yaki skewers and shu mai), don't order everything at once as you can always order a second round of food and they will charge you if you don't finish everything.

We knew it was BYOB so we stopped at the liquor store just north on Clark before Fullerton and got a bottle of wine. Looking at the place from the outside I can honestly say that if I didn't know anything about it I would probably not try it.  It is in the downstairs part of one of the old buildings on Clark and due to the lack of chic design (especially compared to all the fancy sushi places popping up all over the city) I might have been afraid what the sushi would taste like.   We got there and this place is small!!  We sat at the sushi bar because all the tables were taken. They give you a list of their options on the all-you-can eat menu and you just check off what you want.   This list is pretty extensive including miso, edamame, regular maki rolls, specialty maki rolls, and ngiri.  Evidently they charge you for what you don't eat, so we were sure to order carefully.  What is nice is that you are allowed to order more if you didn't get enough the first time...not like a one-time trip to the salad bar or something.   We each had edamame, but we probably could have split one order.  We had a few of the maki and some ngiri pieces...a yellow tail and then something with salmon on the outside and some unagi.  The best was the volcano roll that was really spicy and delicious.  Definitely going for that one first next time. Due to the all-u-can-eat menu, I was a bit nervous about how the fish would taste, but it was really good quality fish and all of the other ingredients were fresh.   Like I said, it is a small place and it is kind of bright in there (those of you who read a few of my other reviews are likely worried about my eyesight by now).  The place could use a little ambiance.

2007-03-09,4.0,"After Molly talked this place up as being the Old Country Buffet of sushi, I just had to try it. I went here on Sunday night with Ginny and while she was not satisfied with the amount of food for the money, I felt happy and full when I left. This place is tiny like other Yelpers have said, so expect to wait. Once we were seated we marked down the appetizers, rolls and pieces we wanted and then waited a bit and the first appetizers came out. The waitress was very pregnant and when I asked her if it was alright if I just crossed off the things (seafood) I didn't want inside my rolls, she looked very confused but nodded. The orders all came through sans fish, so it was understood! I think I stuffed in 4.5 maki rolls, a piece of tamago, chicken yakitori, and vegetable tempura. Everything was very delicious. Ginny's rolls seemed to be bursting with seafood. Mine were very full. My only complaint was that most of the rolls fell apart, possibly because they were overfilled or that the sushi rice was not sticky enough. The appetizers came in very small portions, so don't be afraid to order one thinking it'll take up a lot of room in your belly. I am definitely going back to this place the next time I have an insatiable hunger for sushi. Since I learned how to make sushi, it's become a little painful to dole out $4.95 apiece for veggie rolls at most sushi places, but my wallet says PHEW at Sushi Para II!",0.6046,0.894,0.057,0.049,0.5747222222222222

2007-01-28,5.0,"I was always a little put-off by this place -- below street level, all-you-can-eat sushi with a rather unseemly sign.  This past summer someone recommended it, so I decided to give it a try.  And boy, was I glad I did.  Weekend nights can be rather crowded at this tiny place, but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table.  The wait staff is very friendly and genuine; they are always ready with corkscrews and bottle openers for your BYO beverages.  Once you are seated, the waitress produces sheets of paper that list the menu items.  You write your name at the top, then put a number next to the items that you want to signify how many you want.  The miso is delicious, as is the edamame, but careful -- you don't want to fill up on this stuff when the sushi is as amazing as it is.  I like to start with the homemade gyoza, which are delicous little hot spring roll type things.  The spider roll is one of my favorites, as is the rainbow roll.  The sushi is extremely high quality and beautifully prepared -- not what I initially expected for an all-you-can-eat place! So for a mere $22 including tax and tip, I stuffed my face with delicious sushi, and washed it all down with some Sapporo I had brought in myself, bringing the night's grand total for dinner and drinks to $25.  Not bad at all.  A great way to spend a Friday night catching up with friends. ** The only stipulation is that you must pay for any uneaten sushi.  This is not a problem, however, because you can order as many times as you like.  So if you're like me and your eyes are usually bigger than your stomach, start out small. :)",0.997,0.756,0.226,0.018,0.651423611111111

At first, I drove right past the restaurant because the location was somewhat discreet (okay, I'm blind as a bat at night but compared to the neighboring restaurant, it was hidden!), but was able to find it after I parked and walked it over. The $16.99 all-you-can-eat is an awesome deal. Sushi Para  II offers generous portions of hand-rolled makis made-to-order. In the spirit of the holidays, I ordered up a Christmas roll among others (Volcano, Spicy Tuna, etc.). There is a small monetary penalty if you don't finish what you order. Service was prompt and to the point. If we asked for it, we got it... but wished at times waitstaff would acknowledge that they heard our requests in the first place. Dinner rush was not yet in full swing when we went on a Monday night but the atmosphere was good and cozy.

Now, as for the service, I felt like I wanted to back hand my waitress for being such a miserable little snot. Every time I would ask for something she would roll her eyes and wouldn't even acknowledge what I said to her. There were only a total of about 7 people in the restaurant, and she wasn't busy. She also tried to take my food away twice while I was still eating it. Little did she know that is a great way to lose an arm.

I went with a friend of mine, and while I wouldn't consider either of us refined Sushi experts, I think we're in a pretty good place to give a descent review. The atmosphere of the place is compact yet cozy, and you're definitely not paying for the atmosphere, just the food. If you're okay with that, then you're probably in the right place. When you sit down, they give you a full list of all their salads, soups, rolls and nigiri. You mark down how many of each that you want, and they'll put in the order. If you want more, you can fill out another sheet. We ordered a variety of rolls, and I felt that they were pretty descent. I would put this up to par with just about any other ""pretty good"" sushi restaurant. The service was just fine, but the rolls were slow coming, most likely as was mentioned in another review, its because the chefs are kept busy! One thing that I was a little concerned about was the wait / crowd. We got seated by 7 PM on a Friday night (in November) and didn't have a wait. However, a little later into the night things began to pick up pretty quickly. We even called to make 6 PM reservations and the girl on the other line say, ""6 PM? You won't need reservations.

Run by Mandarin-speaking Chinese; All the sushi chefs are likewise Chinese although the dialects spoken are different. The wait time between submitting your order and receiving can be exceptionally long, however the chefs work fairly quickly - it's the large amount of orders which bogs them down.  Update:  Significant crowds these days and horrible wait times to get a table in this tiny restaurant.  The cooked food and non-fish items are not worth eating: tempura on the buffet menu consists of two pieces of sweet potato and two pieces of zucchini, the harumaki is horrible - overly MSG'd mushy vegetable mash springroll, a friend had GI upset and horrible diarrhea after their ""homemade"" gyoza, the miso is standard hot water, a few flakes of nori, minute cubes of tofu and a dab of cheap miso and house salad is a tomato slice on iceberg lettuce w/ an overly salty soy dressing.  You have to be selective re: the rolls you order - some rolls come w/ 8 huge pieces, and if the roll is bad, then you're out of luck - you'll have to grind 'em down like Fear Factor or be charged.  One particular culprit to watch out for is the Fashion Roll.  Stick to ordering those rolls that come in sets of 5-6 pieces.  Order your tempura or spider roll sans unagi sauce ,otherwise everything'll come out drenched in the overwhelming sauce.  This place is now inundated by local college kids and young professionals/un-professionals.  Unfortunately the wait times to get a table and then to get your food have now made this a less desirable destination than in the past.",-0.0923,0.855,0.073,0.072,0.4512977262977263
