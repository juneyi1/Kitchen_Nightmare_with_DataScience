2016-12-28,3.0,"*sigh* During the summer of 2016, Anheuser Busch bought the beer company, and along with it the restaurant.  We finally feel their impact. The food remains fine -- it's good bar food and all as perfectly serviceable as it always was.  Our table had two burgers, a salad, and the fish & chips, and everything was perfectly good and as one would expect.  The legendary pub chips are still a staple.  If you haven't had them, do. It's at the bar where they've thrown a wrench into the works.  My wife is a wine drinker.  For years -- and I mean like more than 20 -- we've been going to Goose Island where I've enjoyed the beers and she had a glass of something grape-based. No more.   Now that AB is involved, there is beer, and only beer. There's probably a licensing reason for it, but still.  Not a deal breaker for most people, but certainly likely to take this off of our rotation for when we're in the city. Appears that the Cream Soda and Root Beer that Goose Island used to brew is now outsourced as well.  Still seems to be the same stuff, though. The kids liked it. The good news -- the beer is REALLY inexpensive in comparison to most places -- I guess this is AB using this to market the product.  So, it could be worse.   If you're visiting Chicago and want to see the place it's still worth a try.",0.9688,0.854,0.123,0.022,0.625625

2016-12-02,5.0,"The OG in the Chicago brewing scene, this place is a must-visit. It's one of my favorite locations for having a beer, and they've got a lot of good food.  The food is pretty varied, so most people can probably find SOMETHING interesting, although in my opinion there's varying quality in some of the entrees. The burgers are all worth trying, but again, are all very different, so if you want a can't-miss, have the All American, which is their ""regular"" burger, basically (and really delicious). They also tend to have weekly or monthly special burgers, which can be pretty fun (like a Thanksgiving-themed burger with fried turkey and mashed potatoes on the patty). I prefer my burgers with thinner patties, stacked, and the All-American fits the bill. Their pretzels are also awesome, so I'd recommend grabbing one (or two if there are 3 or more of you). In terms of beer, in the summer to fall they tend to be on the more ""traditional"" side; you won't find a lot of sexy ""super hoppy"" American IPAs, nor are you going to find anything on the cutting-edge of current US beer trends. However, all their beer is well-made and tasty, so you also won't find a beer that isn't at least good. The colder months are where they really shine; their stouts are fantastic, and their barrel-aged program is second to none (this is the brewery that basically invented the barrel-aged stout, after all). If you're in town and they're serving something barrel-aged, give it a try, and if they're serving their special holiday gift-drive beers, RUN there. Goose Island has that classic pub feel, so I'd recommend it just off of that. It's also pretty cozy, and the staff is really nice, so I'd throw in a second recommendation for that. But when you add in tasty food and a large, varied beer list from a legendary brewery, this one is a no-brainer.

However it was 80 degrees inside the brewery room the whole time and pretty much felt like a sauna. This was not mentioned before we signed up which would have been nice because some people we were wearing long sleeve shirts and it became so uncomfortable some of left the room to cool down. They overbook the tour as well so if you're at the end you can't see or hear the tour guide. Our group got bored after 10 minutes. It's like sitting in a classroom lecture for 30 minutes.  There is a beer tasting component at the end but all the beers were warm by the time we got there. The beers they chose were also mediocre as well.

And for not serving 'smoked fish' at the bar, which is apparently pub food in Texas.  There's no accounting for taste. But pay no attention to any of these naysayers- the beers are delightful, varied, fresh and innovative. The space is large and comfortable, service is friendly, and we ate probably the best pretzel I've had in my life here.

Goose Island serves both house-made beers (identified by a house flag on the menu) and beers from the now-separate Goose Island Beer Company production facility on Fulton Street.  I went for a selection of the former, in five-ounce samplers: - Daybreak Spiced IPA.  6.1%.  Clear brass, medium head.  Mildly resiny nose.  Juniper taste, fading to bitter.  I didn't detect a spice element. - North Branch Oat Pale Ale.  6.1%.  Clear gold, light head.  Slight sweet malt nose, and a hint of cantaloupe.  Taste is sweet malt, with a ""raw grain"" presence. - Rain Delay Double IPA.  7.6%.  Clear brass, light head.  Nose reminiscent of Juicy Fruit gum; also a ""rainy pavement"" note in the aroma; perhaps by power of suggestion from the name?  Intense sweet malt and milk chocolate-cherry taste, also notes of Juicy Fruit and peach. - Sara Later Belgian Pale Ale.  7.8%.  Cloudy gold, heavy head.  Tart nose, with a touch of black pepper.  Noticeable yeast element in the taste; also a canned-peach note.

2016-07-25,2.0,"Good beer.  Otherwise... We were in town for the weekend and came to the Goose Island Brew Pub with a group of friends. I was impressed in some areas and appalled in others.  Atmosphere - The folks who designed this place did a bang up job of adding plenty of light to the classic (dark) pub look. The place is quaint, yet airy. Very comfortable. It was excellent for our group of eight. Service - Again, Goose Island seems to employ some excellent servers. Our glasses were never empty and the food came out hot and nicely presented. Food - This is where I part ways with many reviewers here. While the quality of the food was fine (not spectacular though), the menu itself is more akin to a boutique tea room than a brew pub. Sure, they serve the requisite Fish 'n Chips (more on that in a sec) and Beer Brat, but there are more salads on the menu than at your local Nordstrom café. Where are the po'boys? Smoked fish? Scotch eggs? Be that as it may, I was the only one in my party who really cared about the non-pub menu. Several people ordered the bread and/or the sweet & spicy wings. Both tasted fine, but it felt like ordering pizza at a barbecue joint. All kidding aside, Goose Island Brew Pub should be ashamed of its Fish 'n Chips. This is the quintessential brew pub menu offering, and Goose Island has the gall to serve pollock. Not cod, but pollock! If I wanted pollock, I'd go to my neighborhood Long John Silver's or Arthur Treacher's. Hell, I'd buy a steamed fish sandwich at McDonald's. But for a brew pub to serve pollock as the fish on its Fish 'n Chips plate? Major fail, Goose Island. Beer - I've been a fan of Goose Island's offerings for several years, particularly their IPAs. I had the sampler (don't remember which ones I chose, but it was along the lines of IPA/Pale Ale/Pilsner) and enjoyed them all. The only problem: the ones I enjoyed the most were not available on draft. Seriously, Goose Island? This is a brew pub! I'd like to drink from the cask or kettle.  Despite my disappointments with this place, I want to reiterate that it's a nice venue with excellent service, quality food and good beer.

It was small and the tour consisted of standing in one room the entire time. However, it WAS more informative that other tours I've been on. I left feeling like I had a good idea of how they made their beer and what their history entailed. After the ""tour"", they bring you to a tasting room where you get to sample 6 beers. This part...AWESOME! And not just because it's the part where they feed you beer. The super cool thing about this location is that they don't brew beers that they sell commercially. The Goose Island beers they brew are specifically for this location only. The beers we tried were literally beers we couldn't try anywhere else. That alone made the $10 worth it.

The best part of the tour is the tasting afterwards where they give you 5 samples to try and explain 'how to taste' beer.  This was an informative tasting portion but something you could easily accomplish yourself by just ordering a flight from the bar.",0.9052,0.872,0.098,0.03,0.456060606060606

Leading up to the big day, Stacy was immensely helpful, answering my wife's innumerable questions regarding every minute detail (her description, not mine) patiently, cheerfully, and rapidly. In fact, the entire staff was fantastic, answering our guests' questions about the unfamiliar beer and guiding their choices, replacing the empty chafing dishes promptly and efficiently, and keeping the tables neat and tidy. Kylie was particularly helpful. My wife and I are living in Philly and had never visited the venue, so we stopped by to see it in person a day or two before our event. While Stacy was off that day, Sara showed us our area, answered our few last questions, and let us try the beers that were to be poured. The selection was great, very well thought out, in terms of quality, variety, and potency...don't want to take anyone out too early, ya know? Also spectacular was the food. I was a bit sceptical of how the buffet was going to be, as wedding buffets are typically not great, at best...holy crap: the food was fantastic. Every piece of steak was perfectly cooked (not easy), the chicken was moist and delicious, the mashed potatoes were (nearly) as good as my wife's, and the Brussels sprouts were on point. All of our guests raved about the food; we couldn't ask for anything more...oh, except they also supplied meals for our vegetarian friends with no problems. Much like the staff, food, and beverage, the space itself suited our needs exactly. We had a fairly small reception, about 65 people. Unfortunately, we could not fit everybody in one room; however, we were able to fit our families on the main floor (Karl Strauss Room) and stash our rowdy friends up in the adjacent loft that overlooks the bar. The front half of the Strauss Room was then used for the DJ and dance floor, and could have accommodated a band if we had decided to go that route.

2015-09-22,4.0,"Had a great time here on a Saturday night.  I have had a lot of Goose Island's regular production stuff and I'd say it ranges from good to great.  The bar has easily 30 beers and offers 2 oz tasters for 2 or 3 bucks, so you can make your own flight, or glasses 14 to 16 oz depending on type.  Prices seemed very good for premium beer plus almost half the beer there seemed to be brew pub exclusives. Food menu is not huge but has a lot of pub staples, sandwiches and burgers seem to be the focus.  We started with a giant pretzel, with mustard and some kind of aoli to dip.  For dinner we all went with burgers and everyone agreed they were good.  Staff was super friendly and when they decided our burgers were taking too long brought us out a plate of house made chips with apologies from the kitchen (we didn't even notice the time really since we were enjoying our beers). The facility is large and has a warm inviting pub atmosphere.  It surprised us that the place was not more crowded on a Saturday night.",0.9888,0.805,0.187,0.007,0.5978255078255078

We also had wings, fish & chips, and a burger for our main course and personally rate it as top of the line beer food. Make sure you get a flight if you come and sample up to four beers of your choice- also make SURE you try to Willow Street which is now my favorite beer; a lightly carbonated, floral & sweet taste with a crisp finish. We came on a Saturday night and it wasn't that crowded but then again it was pouring outside so I'm sure on a nicer day they are a much busier.  Everything from start to finish was superb including our lovely server whom was attentive, knowledgable, and quick.

We got two flights of beer - always a good option at a brewery, and this didn't disappoint. Despite their buyout, Goose Island is still making good beer. To munch on while we drank, we got the wort bread with honey butter and bacon jam. Bread was hard, dense, and chewy in a bad way. Spreads were okay. Ordered a fish taco - nothing special, have had better. Flavorless fried fish with cabbage, spicy green sauce, and a lime. Sauce was good. The service was the real downpoint of this visit. Our waitress hardly made eye contact or smiled and made us feel like we were an inconvenience the entire time we were there. She didn't come by our table very often or offer refills on water. When we asked for our bread to be boxed up (hey, we're traveling, taking our leftovers for breakfast even if they're not that great), I asked for the spreads to be boxed up, too. The waitress didn't respond in any way. I've had too many restaurants not box up all of my leftovers to trust I'll get everything I want if I don't specify, so I said again it would be great if we could get the spreads, too. She responded this time: ""I heard you the first time."" Great, if you'd said so or nodded or even looked at me the first time, I might have already understood that. Not just asking again to be a jerk. Thanks. If we lived in Chicago, we would probably never come here again.

I'm talking, waiting list, lines down the side walk, entire bar tap-takeovers, just to get Bourbon County Stout, Bourbon County Coffee, Bourbon County Barleywine.  And let's not forget my favorite Madame Rose, and Juliet!  There's also a ton of other beers from Goose Island that I love: Gillian, Lolita, Halia, Sofie, Matilda. I can go on... Last week, I was at Goose Island Clybourn, and tried an amazing Biere de Garde called Old Town. What a special beer; strong, oakey, fruity, just perfect. I only wish I could take home a growler of it!  They also have random Farmers Market series, and I tried one called Mr. Locomotive which was also amazing; smokey, coffee, and cocoa all in one glass. Delicious!  Goose Island is a front-runner in the craft beer industry, and is loved by Philadelphians like me. Keep it up brew master!

Had I not said anything, I guarantee she would've ignored us and gone about her business. Beer is fine, no real complaints there. The service, however, is where the 1 star starts. Our waitress was not inviting, conversational, or really expressive of any emotion at all. Maybe an off day? Or maybe try a new field that doesn't require this much communication. When someone says thank you... it's common sense as a server or decent human being to say ""you're welcome."" I had really high hopes coming here considering I love the beer. I was even going to bring my buddy back once he's in town from NY. Not anymore. The food was extremely subpar for the price. Flavorless, greasy, slapped together food. $14 for a burger that I could grill better at home. Not to mention the burger came sitting on a puddle of grease.

Everyone had a good time, from gramma to coworkers to the surprise +1. Most of this was thanks to Goose Island's event coordinator, Lisa Carlson, aka Patron Saint of Weddings at Bars.  We had a 100-person wedding in the side room and bar at the restaurant. Although we were worried we'd be crowded, Lisa reassured us that the space would be perfect, for both ceremony and reception. And, of course, she was right! The food was delicious, and included some of our favorite items from Goose Island menus of yore - smoked meatballs, pretzels with mustard dipping sauce, and truffled mac and cheese. Oh, and pierogis, which my Polish gramma loved.  Our package included mini root beer floats, but we also brought in our own desserts at no extra charge to us. One of our dessert vendors forgot to make a delivery, which I was ready to write off - but not Lisa. Lisa called them, set up a secret drop off (the dessert was a surprise for my husband), and the dessert arrived as if no problem ever existed! The outstanding bartenders and Lisa crafted a couple of custom drinks for our wedding, which were delicious and bourbony. Of course, a whole bunch of beers were on tap, and listed on a custom wedding-day menu.  Our guests also took tours of the brewery area during the wedding - which was pretty well received by our older family members, which was surprising but also very cute. Who knew Aunt Judy was down to learn about craft beers?  Audio jacks made playing out own playlists super-easy, from the ceremony through dinner and then the dance party. We were even able to fit a 100-person hora (well, 50 people dancing, and 50 surprised people just watching) into the side room. Last but definitely not least, everyone working the wedding was absolutely incredible. The bartenders and servers were outstanding. They were so wonderful to all of our guests and it really made the day extra special. Great planning, great food, great drinks, great location, and great service. Would I get married here again?

I enjoyed my Demolition beer and while it was the right beer for me, Goose Island brews just stand mediocre for me. I enjoyed the apps a lot more than my entrée. We got the wort bread and crab rolls to start. Our delightful waitress was very helpful and personable in explaining their offerings. The wort bread is made from the leftover grains used to brew the beer. The bread itself was warm and toasty, but paired with the bacon jam and honey butter, it was perfect. I was surprised that I enjoyed the bacon jam so much as I'm not a big fan of bacon, but it was a perfect balance of savory and sweet. Their honey butter was also very good, considering I've tried honey butter at other establishments. The crab rolls were also quite tasty, and pretty much was like a traditional lobster roll, just with crab. Next was my stilton burger. I'm usually a big fan of strong flavors: pungent cheeses, garlic, spice, onion, etc. However, the combo of flavors and toppings of this burger didn't quite work for me. I was pleased to see the whole garlic cloves, enjoyed the pepper crust and the stilton cheese...just not all together. It wasn't horrible, but was definitely let down. While I am detailing this to the extent that I am, this wasn't a huge deal for me. What really dampened my spirit was that my burger was nearly well-done instead of being medium. The cook on the other burgers at the table were more appropriate. Wouldn't come back as there are much better beers and burgers in Chicago, at much better prices.

I visited Goose Island last night with two friends. After waiting at least five minutes at the hostess stand for someone to greet us (while several servers where standing near by and glanced at us several times) we were finally told to seat ourselves.  Our waitress greeted us, came back and took our drink order and then our food order. We never saw her again until the end of our meal. She asked if we needed anything else and I said no, we would just take our checks. She came back with one check - no big deal, we would just ask her to split it when she came back. We put our three credit cards in the checkbook and waited for her to return. She asked if we wanted to split it three ways evenly and I asked if we could have our own separate checks. It was like that flipped a trigger for her and she rudely (and loudly enough for the table next to us to hear and turn around) scolded us for not telling her to split the checks at the beginning. She claimed ""I don't remember what each of you got and I don't MAGICALLY know your names to match your orders to your meals. You didn't tell me at the top so now I'll have to go back and redo it."" I have never in my life had a waitress make such a big deal about splitting the check. I have been a waitress for five years and it takes 30 seconds to do.

We sat at the bar, and the bartender was friendly and helpful, describing the different beers and offering us several small samples so we could decide what to order, which is a real plus when there's a selection of unfamiliar beers, you don't want to get stuck with something you don't like. Goose Island has so many varieties you can't not find something you like, unless of course you don't like beer to begin with. My favorite food item there is the chips - they're salty with a very slight sweet tang, and they go perfectly with the beer. Any of the beers. I also got a veggie burger, which was good, but pretty standard veggie burger bar fare. I would have ordered the sweet potato fries if I hadn't just been chowing down on the chips. The restaurant is roomy and pleasant, with easy parking (a definite plus for the area) and right off the Red Line.

2014-06-23,3.0,"I came in for the tour and sat at the bar hoping to taste several beers. It's a clean, appropriately spaced bar/restaurant and the servers are nice and approachable. They had quite the selection of beers on draft and I wanted to sample a great number of them, however, only a handful of beers come in a glass less than 10oz. I found this a bit annoying only because I am from out of town and wanted to try everything. I ended up ordering a 10oz beer and brought it on the 'brewery' tour. Good thing I did because the 'tour' was really boring. I put tour in quotes because you stand in a humid fermentation room for about 40 minutes while the tour guide starts with the ancient history of beer. Not a history of Goose Island beer but ancient history.... Half way into it the tour guide briefly speaks about Goose Island and then seemed like she recited the Wikipedia page on beer. I know it's not the tour guide's fault, she actually seemed pretty cool, however, her tour is not.  After the tour you sit in a tasting room and try about 8 different beers and get a cool logo pint glass. This is the best part of the tour because the guide talks about the beers they brew and you learn that what's brewed at Goose Island Clybourn, stays at Goose Island Clybourn.  Which means that if you like their beers, you'd have to return to the Clybourn brewery to taste it, they don't  bottle it. What they do bottle are the recipes that Busch purchased and are brewing/bottling at their other site. That was pretty sad to learn.  Long story short, sign up for the brewery tour but skip the actual tour and join the tasting afterwards.",0.9809,0.835,0.129,0.036,0.5796666666666668

He asked if we wanted another burger which my Dad obviously said no. Then he asked for all my Dad's information which he replied ""I'm not giving that to you.""

The good thing perhaps is that they offer almost all varieties of Goose Island beers (obviously) that you wouldn't be able to find most other places.  Note that since GI was bought out, about half of their beers aren't made on the premises anymore so it won't be any ""better"" here.  That being said, many still are made on site and will surely be fresher than purchase from somewhere else. The brewery tour: Informative and fun.  You get a free pint glass at the end of the tour, but when I was on tour last spring they botched the tasting a little.  The order was different on some of our seating and some of us even had duplicates.  They did their best to fix it, but ended up getting it more jumbled in the process.  The tour guide was concerned and tried to rectify it, but it really just came down to whoever did the pouring.   Probably doesn't happen often, that the tasting was messed up but the tour is worthwhile and it would be a nice place to go to be able to try all different kinds of Goose Island.  The food though, I think you could probably bypass.",0.9931,0.841,0.144,0.015,0.520528318903319

You also get a pint glass, not too shabby for a $10 tour. I was with my sister, who doesn't even like beer, and even she had fun. Plus I got to have her beer, so win-win.  Restaurant: I don't remember what the name of the burger I had was- it had a mushroom, Swiss, & crème fraiche sauce, but it was tasty. Their bacon jam is the thing dreams are made of.  Overall, I was pretty impressed with this place. They don't do any bottling at this location & make small batches that are available at the restaurant.

The beers range in price based on alcohol content, however most of the beers allow you to purchase a 10oz pour for $3.50 which is awesome because then you can try a variety.

Of course, Goose Island has some solid beers (nothing spectacular or pushing the envelope, but I will never say no to a Green Line), and their food was pretty good as well. Just as the 3 stars indicate - it was A-OK. So many better breweries to go to, though!  The service was kind of the worst, but we were all drinking and watching the game so it wasn't a HUGE deal. Right when the game ended, though, they made a huge point that we should be leaving (I'm sorry, its 11 pm on a Saturday night... I would have rather them just said, hey - we are closing up this area, do you want your tab transferred to the bar, or are you finishing up?.... but no, passive aggressively glaring at us seemed to work great.). I came back later that night for a final drink and the bar server seemed very annoyed that we were there as well (I swear to god we are not a loud or needy group what so ever!).

Their beer here tastes 5x better and they have a bunch of beer they brew exclusively for the brewpub. I honestly say I've never had a bad beer here. The tour is also pretty neat. You're only in two rooms, but you get a good lesson during the tasting portion. The only downside to this place is the food. They usually have nothing I want to eat. The menu is seasonal, but when I try something new I usually don't care for it. I like their pulled pork, rabbit spring roll things, and these peppery ribs. I think the pulled pork might be year round, but I don't want to go there just pulled pork. Everything else, didn't really hit the spot. Oh wait, they do have the best pub chips in the business.

2013-09-21,3.0,"Aside from my general love affair with Goose Island, I am not the biggest fan of the Clybourn location. Of course, with Goose Island you can count of a great beer list, some cocktails and wine, and an elevated bar-food menu. I either haven't been given a specials menu either time I've been there, or they don't do specials there like they do at Wrigleyville, so that's a little bit of a let-down. I genuinely enjoyed the fish tacos appetizer and could have eaten a million of the pretzels with the dijon mustard. The main courses haven't blown me away. The veggie burger has good flavor when you eat just the patty, pico de gallo, and chipotle mayo by itself, but there is a super high bun-to-meat ratio, and you totally lose the good flavor if you eat it all together. The man friend gets his standard cheddar burger, same as the Wrigleyville location, which is always good (but as he points out, that's pretty hard to mess up). We were disappointed this last time that his fries weren't cooked all the way through.  I agree with Emma K - the service has never been good for us. There's always a lag between sitting down and making drink orders, usually at least 5 minutes and closer to 10 minutes. They also don't seem too excited if you're not ordering a beer. This location is definitely more set up for the beer-drinking crowd, with a couple of large rooms seemingly set up for tastings and a bigger bar area. There are also several doors and it can be difficult to find the hostess stand.

Honestly, it's just standing in a room listening for a bit and then a tasting. After the tour, the tasting begins! Now this is well worth the cost and was pretty fun. We learned a bit about the brews and were given samples of 6 of their beers. Our guide helped in explaining them all the best she could. The room in which they do the tasting is pretty cool.

However, I tentatively put the room on hold, and then called to confirm, and a different person answered the phone, and said that he could help me. He told me that by putting my name down, I was automatically confirmed. Another one of my friends called, and was told that nothing was confirmed. A little confusing. I would recommend just sticking with Erin when planning. Luckily, all turned out well. The night of the party, we had the Bier Stube to ourselves. We were allowed to decorate and provide our own music. We had rented the room from 7-10, which included our own private server. Since it was a Friday, people didn't arrive until 7:30, 8, or 9.

I usually make a point of trying something new, but default to the veggie chili if I'm not feeling adventurous. I love the breadth of beers here. There are always interesting Belgians to try, some of which are priced at $4 or $5. Bartenders always welcome me to taste something before I order it.

The veggie burger is awesome and I've heard the black earth burger is also top notch.  But I'll admit-- I haven't made it very far on the menu because 75% of the time I go, I have to get the fish and chips.  I would go so far as to say these are the best fish and chips in Chicago! The breading is light and crispy, you get a really good size serving, and the fish quality has always been great.  My whole family came in from Cleveland and all unanimously agreed...and they're pretty hardcore fish and chips critics!  And of course, you have to try a beer! The fights are the best way to go...five samples of beer.  The beer menu is organized really well so you can see what beers are unique to the brewpub's location.  While 312 will probably always be my favorite beer in the city, you can get that anywhere.

Bar food? Eh, I've certainly had better. You know the selection isn't worth much when I order a salad - I would take a sandwich over a salad 100% of the time & the only sandwich that jumped out at me was the pulled pork which I'd ordered last time. That was a 2 star sandwich so I chose the calamari Greek salad. That gets 2 stars, too, as did my husband's fish tacos. The pub chips were really good with tons of seasoning on them.

To start, we got the flatbread (wild mushrooms, goat cheese) and the hummus (which came with delicious pita triangles, tomato and cucumber slices, olives, and a little chunk of feta). These were good. Nothing fancy, but good. My entree is where I (or Goose Island) went horribly wrong. I got the housemade veggie burger. It's my thing to always give a housemade veggie burger a try. I respect a place that doesn't just heat up a frozen Gardenburger(r). This burger was HORRIBLE. It was just way, way, way too spicy. It kind of ruined my night to be honest.

The bartender whose name was Adan was truly sincere and helpful in explaining the menu to us (trust me we were being super indecisive and taking a century). When I told him that my stomach hurt and that I did not want to drink he said ""hey it happens, I'm just glad you're here."" That literally put a smile on my face! He even offered to put bitters in my ginger ale because it alleviates tummy pains.  We ordered the fish tacos $8 for two and it was a huge taco. The fish was juicy and there were actual chunks of fish. We also ordered the burger and had a side of the sweet potato fries for the extra $2.

My wife wanted to go out somewhere that was a little more low-key this past Saturday to celebrate her birthday. We had been to this Goose Island on another occasion and it seemed like a great spot. Knowing that there could potentially be a lot of us, because my wife is so popular, I called a couple weeks ago and made a reservation for between 20-25 people. I thought I told them on the phone that we'd just be drinking and hanging out, but maybe I didn't.  When we arrived on Saturday they had an area down a couple of stairs, just off the bar, waiting for us... it was much bigger than I anticipated. At that time there were only 4 of us there so I really felt terrible because seeing as how we were just drinking, I wasn't sure when everyone would show up and for how long they would stay... The waitress was extremely friendly and attentive even when it was just the 4 of us. It took about an hour before everyone started to arrive and I believe we ended up having right around 20 people, which was good because I felt terrible when it was just a few of us in this massive area. Even though we didn't eat, everyone seemed to have multiple drinks which made me feel better for the waitress. I don't know if they would have sat all those tables had we not been there, but I'm the type of person that feels bad if we just sit somewhere and don't spend money.  So a huge thank you to the waitress, who's name escapes me even though she introduced herself to me, for everything on Saturday night.

2013-03-02,5.0,"Chicago is in the thick of the U.S. craft beer explosion, but Goose Island's been doing its thing for much longer and it shows. The best craft brewers in Chicago tend to either be distribution microbreweries only or in-house brew pubs/restaurants. Goose Island does both, at two locations no less, and it doesn't sacrifice quality to do so. GI-Clybourn has it all. If you love drinking craft beer from the source, there's no better option, and the best part is that if you love trying tons of different beers, the beer menu changes virtually every week. If you haven't been in awhile and you come back, it's like a whole new experience. Only 15 percent of the beer menu is the stuff you can buy at a liquor store or find on tap somewhere. The rest are rotating taps in every beer style you can imagine. Even if you don't like beer that much, the staff here will find you something that you'll love. The food is definitely not the highlight if your reason for dining is upscale pub food, but it's superior to your average bar and grill and they definitely get creative. More times than not, I'm satisfied. Pulled pork in Honker's Ale BBQ sauce, duck poutine ... My favorite appetizer is the sweet potato fries with curry ketchup. Don't come here if you don't love beer, but the food will definitely not ruin the experience and in my opinion should enhance it. GI-Clybourn caters to every crowd. I've been for appetizers and a quick drink at the bar, dinner with a few friends, their awesome Beer Academy the last Wednesday of the month and even for a bachelor party. The place is huge, so unless you come on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll probably have no problem sitting down. Given their capacity, I can't speak to the service when it's insanely crowded, but the bartenders and servers are extremely nice and especially knowledgable.  No other craft brewer offers the full-service restaurant experience with as many beer options except Revolution Brewing, and it's always insanely crowded over there in Logan Square.

Mussels may not have been the best preparation of all time, but they were not turned away and quickly disappeared. We enjoy the Goose Island experience so much we even stayed for brunch dessert. Today they were out of carrot cake, but had a single-serving red velvet cake layered with cream cheese frosting that was a worthy replacement.

Rarely will you have to wait long, and if you do there large brown leather couches in the front are quite delightful.

I then had the pulled pork with fries and was so full after half a sandwich, that I got to take the other half home for later.

I really enjoyed the entire experience and plan on bringing friends from outta town to try this place. It is one of a kind.! SIDENOTE: I was able to talk with a brew master a few weeks ago, and I told him how at first when I had heard that Budweiser had purchased them I became worried that my Chicago beer would loose it's flair, and quality. He told me how working for them has actually been a blessing. The only thing that has changed is that their classics and high volume beers (312 for example) is no longer brewed in the brew pubs and in Chicago, but rather a larger plant. This has allowed them to expand their new projects and beers that they produce specifically for the brew pubs, and the brew house here is practically run without Budweiser's tainted approval. Since micro brews are up and coming the merger was great and now gives the menu of beers a much deserved applause. I am excited to return regularly and see what other things they brew up.

The people running the event were great and I think the staff at Clybourn are fantastic in general but I found the beer school-ing a little lacking. Maybe I've gone to one to many beer events but I was really hoping for some advanced beer knowledge here at Goose Island and the class came off really more of an introductory level. The offerings were well-selected but would've been nice for them to throw something at us that's a little more rare, experimental, or noteworthy than the things I can find myself at Binny's or on tap at Clybourn.

2012-11-04,5.0,"If you love craft beer, you must make a pilgrimage to Goose Island Clybourn. Goose Island opened for business in 1988 and is rightly credited with the revival of craft beer in Chicago as well as the revitalization of the neighborhood in which it is located. Nevermind that A-B purchased Goose Island Brewery in 2011, the pubs (Clybourn & and the newer Wrigleyville) were never part of the deal and retain their local, Chicago, craft beer bar character. Speaking of bars. Goose Island has a gorgeous, antique bar serving as the centerpiece of its Clybourn pub. It's a massive, solid wood structure with fine woodcraftsman details and a beautiful patina. I wish I could remember its history. It's everything a bar should be. There is additional seating -- high tables and booths -- along the walls of the bar area. There's a pool room off to one side, rooms for special events and private parties, and rooms for main restaurant seating. We always sit in the bar area. It's the heart of the brewpub. My husband & I were introduced to Goose Island in 1994. At that time, 1800 Clybourn was not in a bustling yuppie shopping district. Heck, it did not even anchor a strip mall. The building stood in a sketchy neighborhood among a handful of languishing manufacturing facilities. You had to really want to go there. After our very first visit, we were committed to making the trek again and again... even though that means a 20-mile drive from the 'burbs for us.  We knew next to nothing about beer when we first became regulars at Goose. We had no idea what to order. The most exotic thing I'd ever tasted before 1994 was a Molsen Canadian. Yet the Goose Island staff somehow convinced me to try Old Clybourn Porter and I was hooked. Before long my husband and I had earned several MBAs (Master of Beer Appreciation) and our names, along with dozens of others, are still proudly displayed on the walls of the brewpub. We owe our love and understanding of beer to the staff at Goose Island. Then and now, the staff at Goose are very knowledeable. They taste all the beers, understand styles, understand food pairings, and are more than prepared to help you navigate the beer menu ... even if until now you've been a committed lite beer drinker. The food at Goose is very good. This was not always the case. Back in the day you'd come for the beer and you'd tolerate the food; with a few exceptions. The Stilton Burger has been around as long as I can remember and it's always been incredible. It's a pepper-crusted burger topped with Stilton cheese, roasted garlic cloves, German mustard and sandwiched between two solid slices of pumpernickel bread. These are not shy flavors! The Pub Chips have always been a hit too. Now whenever possible, Goose Island sources ingredients from local farmers, growers, and artisans. And they have a chef who knows what to do with these exceptional ingredients. You can't go wrong with a burger (beef or lamb) or a pork belly sandwich. I recently had the country fried duck livers which were outstanding! Unfortunately, the scallion biscuits served with  the livers were rocky and dry. The artisan cheese platter, charcuterie platter, or Ploughman's platter are always good choices. Really nothing better with a great beer, IMHO, than a well-curated selection of cheese and charcuterie. Another thing I like about Goose island Clybourn is it's not the usual bar scene; even on Friday and Saturday nights. Couples, groups of friends, coworkers, and families come to relax and enjoy food, drink, and conversation.  I realize I haven't recommended beers to you, but beer preferences are so personal. I like nearly every brew from Goose Island with the exception of 312. Talk to the waitstaff and let them be your guide. Be adventurous! I will say this ... if you've ever had Honker's Ale in the bottle, I urge you to try it on tap. I think it's an entirely different animal on tap and still one of the finest ales Goose Island has ever produced.",0.988,0.903,0.085,0.012,0.49661064425770307

The chili was pretty spicy but still good (although I have a pretty low threshold for what I consider ""spicy""), the pretzel was exactly what a soft pretzel should be like (soft, chewy, warm, and with the right amount of salt), and the sandwich was really good, but the bread was really hard to bite off/chew and got hard pretty quickly. The boyfriend got the barbecue pulled pork sandwich (standard but good) and the jalapeno cheddar pretzel, which he loved. The chips he got as a side to his sandwich were really good, too - the seasoning they used was slightly sweet but it worked really well. We sat in the bar area and had Stacy as our server - she was really knowledgeable about the beer menu and gave both of us great suggestions based on what we told her we liked. He got the Flight Delay, Extremely Naughty Goose, Belgian King IPA and Midway IPA, all of which she suggested when he said he liked more bitter, hoppy IPAs. He was definitely pleased with all of those suggestions. For me she recommended the Wallonia and Sofie, since I'm a pretty new beer drinker, and they were both great. (She said Sofie is a pretty good starter beer because it's light and has bubbles like champagne, so a lot of people are converted if they start with that!) She also made sure to come check on us to make sure we were doing okay and to see if we needed anything else, and was quick to come take our order and give us our check when we were done.

The tour is $10 and at the end you get a line of 6 beers waiting for you as well as a Goose Island pint glass that you can take home. The tour was pretty standard, but not super interesting to me. It was nice getting to try different beers that aren't sold in stores. You do need to make a reservation though, FYI. My favorite beers are Green Line and Matilda, so we took home two growlers of those. I like that their menu gives you descriptions of all the beers, alcohol content, and what size you can get of each. It's really helpful when deciding what you might like. Then of course, you can always get a flight and taste beers that way. The food was pretty good. Slightly better than regular bar food, but for the combo of great food and beer, I'll still put all my money on Two Brothers. They've just nailed it.

This location is definitely the more chill of the two and I feel like you can get a better bar experience here than in Wrigleyville, where you're limited to what you can get and how you get it on game/concert days (see review).",0.9902,0.73,0.199,0.071,0.5602802994107341

2012-10-01,4.0,"Finally after years of ordering Goose Island (originally for myself -but more recently only for others), and LOVING the beer taps designed as the perfectly adorable goose head, I made it TO an actual Goose Island Brewery in Chicago.   I could not bear to enter this place for a few years, as it saddened me too much to be around all of this beer, and not be able to try it.  But fast forward to now, where I am still bitter and frustrated at my gluten intolerance - yet now capable of enjoying it vicariously through others, and I was READY to hit Goose Island.   And the BEST PART - they now have a gluten free ale on tap.  Even better, I found ....a gluten free menu.  We only went during the afternoon, between meals.  But both of us ordered food AND a beverage, and were very pleased with our experience. The Clybourn location is located in walking distance from the Red Line , tucked in a strip mall type of building along with a Patagonia.  Out front was the Goose Island beer bus/van of some sort dropping off folks who were there taking the tour. We had the option of being seated in the dining area, or finding a spot in the bar.  We actually found a table in the bar area, and were served immediately.  I tried the fish tacos, which were a perfect snack to accompany my gluten free beer.  The gluten free menu included :  an Artisanal cheese sampler, Charcuterie, Hummus plate, four different burger choices (Black Earth, Stilton, Primer Cheddar, and a Lamb burger), soup & salads, the tacos I got, and a few other options.   The regular menu was a bigger version of my special ""gluten free"" menu.  My dining companion got a burger with cheddar, & some house cured bacon, which he was perfectly satisfied with.   Here is what I ordered for my beer selection: Queen-OA | Gluten Free Ale | 6.1% .  It was described per the menu as - Cherry blossom color, Ruby Red grapefruit aroma, effervescent citrus flavor, light body IT WAS DELICIOUS.  I have been on an entirely grain free diet this year, and opted to add some grains in during this trip ; partially as a test to see how my body would react, and partially because I REALLY wanted to try some of the new gluten free beers I have been hearing about.  This was a good decision.  This beer was the perfect way to ""test"" out grains.  It was very refreshing, & a gorgeous color. My dining companion tried the Harvest Ale (ESB).  He again, was quite satisfied with that.  We most definitely need to get back to Goose Island in the near future though.  This was too brief of a visit to get the full experience.   I would definitely recommend checking Goose Island out if you are a lover of craft beer, and in Chicago.  I did not take the tour, so I cannot speak to that part of it.  But everyone I saw appeared to be having a grand time.",0.9993,0.737,0.241,0.022,0.5732715372059636

We loved the beers (Summer School, Willow St. Wit, Virtue RedStreak Cider, and Florence), appetizers (cheese sampler and artichoke fritters), and entrees (black earth burger and duck poutine). All of these were truly scrumptious -- I can't decide if the best part was the richly-flavorful-but-not-greasy artichoke fritters or the perfectly succulent duck in the poutine. I wouldn't have complained to have more duck in the poutine but I think that's more me being greedy for how good it was than a legitimate paucity (and the non-duck ingredients were far more than an afterthought -- exceptional cheese curds!). The cheeses in the cheese platter and their accompaniments were high-quality and very enjoyable, and it was hard to steal only a couple bites from my girlfriend's burger. Given the excellence of the other food, I was really surprised by how bleh the desserts were. I ordered the poached pear dessert and it was tasteless and bland, served completely plain with a small scoop of ice cream. My girlfriend got some kind of chocolate dessert with bacon in it, which I didn't try because I'm not a chocolate eater, which she said was ok but didn't contain much bacon.

The place wasn't too crowded for a Saturday night and plenty of seats can be found at the bar. We found a spot and had a great view of the television to watch the Blackhawks-Coyotes game. I decided to stick with the beer found only in the brewery itself. Why would I get 312 if I can find it at every 7-11 or bar in Chicago? I started with the Aviator only because the Lincoln Park lager was out and then I got the Four Star. Both beers were very good. My friend liked his beers as well. I wanted dessert and got the dark stout infused chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream. It was very rich and delicious. However, I did had to wait a long time for the cake. When I asked about it, the waitress apologized and went to check on it. She came back with my cake and told me it was on the house and a round of beers were on her as well.

2012-04-03,2.0,"I was excited to come back home to Chicago and hit up Goose Island! We highly recommended this place to friends and family and being a property owner in Lincoln Park I have a hidden interest in ensuring institutions like this are around forever for convenience and property value. This leads me to the reason I am writing this review... We chose this place over the abundance of other locations that are in the area that are very similar/comparable. We met family and friends and I spoke the world if this place. I received one of those coupons they send to Lincoln Park residents to encourage them to come back in. Loving the beer, it didnt require much convincing.  We arrived, I immediately showed the coupon to the cashier (date on coupon was a few months expired) and asked her if it was okay to use it. She said yes and we were off to ordering! Food prices are above average, food quality was okay. Salad was bad (two halves of a per on top of mixed greens with a bit of Gorganzola) Beer selection was to die for and of course it tasted great! When the check arrived we noticed the coupon was not deducted. We asked for an adjustment and the cashier indicated that she would not be able to honor it. Not the end of the world, however, what followed was one of the most unacceptable behaviors I have ever seen in an establishment. (click on my reviews on yelp, I have never given any establishment such a low rating). The manager went out of her way to embarass us by yelling that the coupon had expired, called us liars (questioned how we got the coupon and whether we actually lived in Lincoln Park). There is no other side to the story here.. this is the way it went down.  Recap:  Don't come here if you are hungry. Menu is okay at best and the prices are not worth the food. Avoid anything that involves anything more than just getting a beer. Get the sampler and drink plenty! The only reason this place got 2 stars is because I have been here before and received good service. They won't WOW you, but you get enough to enjoy the beer. What it lacks to get to the five stars: Food value, SERVICE, professionalism.",0.965,0.846,0.108,0.046,0.46187908496732033
2012-03-30,3.0,"They're lucky their beer is good because the food is only so-so and the bartenders are terrible. When we walked in, we got the bartender's attention and asked him if we could change one of the TVs so my friend could watch the Kentucky-Florida SEC championship game. When my friend said she wasn't sure what channel the game was on, the bartender made a completely unnecessary smartass comment about her not being ""much of a fan."" After making an inaudible wisecrack to another bartender, he changed the channel. When my friend politely thanked him, he gave a big ""You're welcome!"" like he did something more than pick up a remote control. We decided to order some food from the bar. I had the cheddar burger with bacon and my friend had the veggie burger. While my friend enjoyed her lunch, my burger was a little too dry and charred. Maybe if our bartender had been paying attention when I asked for it to be cooked medium, it would have come out right. The bright spot was the beer. They had a nice sampler deal: four 5 oz. beers for $8, or, if you want a pint, you can sample it before you buy. My favorite was the Honest Stout, which unfortunately seems to be only a limited edition. The hopfest and the american amber ale were tasty as well. They had lots of choices that you can't find it stores, so if you like Goose Island beer, it's definitely worth stopping by. Once again, though, we were frustrated by our bartender's complete lack of attention. We had to flag down another bartender to get refills and to give us our check.

On my order we subbed the regular fries for sweet potato fries, and  I ordered the 1/2 pint of IPA. Our server was very nice. But I had to take off a star for a few minor reasons..#1 both our entrees came out with NO duck whatsoever on our Duck Poutine and since it was delivered by a food runner, it took some time to flag down our waitress to point out the mistake. She did apologize and took it back to the chef who had also sent his apologies. Once we received the proper dish, I enjoyed every bite. I loved the added flavor of the sweet potato fries to the savory duck. But my friend who had never had Duck Confit before felt that it was too salty but still delicious.

2012-02-20,4.0,"Can you make someone who recently just gave up meat and doesn't drink much (at all) go to a brewery for dinner? No, not really. With that, I was pretty surprised that I picked Goose Island for a dinner on a Saturday night. My friend's sister was in town, and thus I put my personal reasons aside to join them for dinner.  Even more surprising was that I really liked it here. The place was big, and crowded, but the wait wasn't long -- well, I didn't have to wait since I arrived late, but still, they didn't complain, so it must have been a short wait. When we sat down, it seemed like every tables in the restaurant was filled. It had a very laid back and warm feeling inside. Nothing fancy or intimate, but I'd definitely recommend this place for a gathering with friends or family (casual one). Knowing that we were at a brewery, we had the  beer fight and ordered one for myself. I honestly could not remember all we tasted, but for someone who doesn't like the taste of beer, I thought they had some pretty delicious options. My favorite personally was the Green Line, Rumble Bee, and Honest Stout - the best one - very rich and tasty.  The best part, I thought, was the food. I had the vegetarian burger, and it was seriously super amazingly delicious! It had a spicy kick to it, and my friend was drinking water after each bite, so if you don't do well with spicy food, beware. Otherwise, please order it. The black bean patty was probably marinated in some Mexican spices, very well done and did not fall apart (my pet peeve with black bean burgers), and it went perfectly with the Pepperjack cheese. I never thought I would enjoy food here, and it seemed like the food wasn't their strong point, but I honestly can rave all day about this burger. For a second during the meal, I thought I was liking it so much because I was hungry, but who was I kidding? I had a double serving of pasta about 2 hours before that burger was served (yes, I'm a fat ass, I admit it). So hunger was definitely not the case here.  My companies enjoyed their food as well, as the pulled pork and steak sandwiches received great approvals. Their fries were alright. The sweet potato fries came with a curry flavored sauce (they're big on spices here), and I really really liked the sauce, but my friend begged to differ.  Although we did not see any of the brewery itself, which is kinda the attraction here, I very much enjoyed my time here. The bill can be high if you like to drink, with a beer and an entree each, and a beer fight and extra order of fries to share, it came to about $110 for the 4 of us (tax & tips). Not overpriced but not cheap either, as their beers range from 5-10 each. Server was nice and she kinda disappeared by the end but other staff took care of us just fine. The hostess was very nice, and I say this because I've experienced more than often mean or careless hostesses that bother me so much!

On a recent visit, the place was packed.  Had to wait 15 minutes for a table, which was a first.  I was anxious to try the English Beef Stew after reading a rave review at Chicagoist.  It was absolutely awful.  Like the worst crock pot mess ever.  Biggest problem was that I think somebody in the kitchen had an ""accident"" with the pepper.  It was loaded with pepper and inedible.  I ate as much as I could, and left the rest.  The crispy leeks on top were the least offensive part of the dish, while the Stilton biscuits were the second worst aspect.  Stale, salty, and flavorless.  At the ridiculous price of $15 for this brown disaster, I felt obligated to mention this to the server, which I have maybe done twice in my life.  She did get it removed from the check, so that was appreciated, and fair.  Oh, and the soup of the day was crap, too.  Only highlights were the Pub Chips and the fries.  That's it. Service is generally terrible.  I think we had this server once before, and she's as insincere and inattentive as they come.  I was in desperate need of a beverage to dilute the pepper from the stew that was eating away at my tongue and throat, as well as wash away the foul Makers Mark cocktail I ordered.  Couldn't even get eye contact as she passed by to other tables at least 6 times.  Needless to say, I left thirsty! Lastly, when did this place become a family destination??  It's a brew pub, for chrissakes!  The number of strollers, babies, and small unruly children was like I've never seen there before.  Unfortunately, 2 of them were in the booth behind me bouncing around like maniacs.  Didn't make the meal from hell any better!

2012-01-25,3.0,"Goose Island is interesting. Everything served on tap at the Clybourn location is brewed in-house, which keeps it feeling small and unique. They keep their staples on the menu but also switch out new beers frequently. It's nice for regulars to get something new and also for infrequent customers who don't want to relearn an entirely new menu each time they visit.  Their food is good too. I always get the stilton burger which means I'm not allowed to speak to anyone the rest of the day (BLUE CHEESE AND GARLIC!!!!) and my girlfriend always gets their veggie burger.  Service at the tables has never been great for us. It's usually a pissed off looking girl who would rather stand around the service station instead of giving us menus. And even though prices are clearly marked on the menus we always get sticker shock. I guess because most draft beers are $6-7. Which is strange, most brewpubs I've been to their beer is cheaper.  Their tour is nice, but probably the most glossy and least interactive of any brewery tour I've been on. It was $10 and had about 25 people on it. We walked through their ""brewery"" and saw some barrels aging, some beer gurgling. I mean, a tour's a tour - walk around, sniff some hops, you know. They led us then into a party room where we had 6 small glasses laid out with different beers in them. We tasted each one and then the tour guide talked about them. It was nice but it felt more like a class rather than an informal chat about beer. Again, just completely different than any brewery tour I've ever been on. I mean, we sat down. In chairs.

Goose Island was my first taste of craft beer while taking a tour of the facilities for my Microbiology class. We ended up staying after the tour, with my professor no less, to do a beer tasting. It was wonderful and I've never looked back! I thought beer and I were just two things that were never going to see eye to eye. My favorite Goose Island brew? Probably Marisol but you can only get that at two locations in the city; Public House (they never have it in stock) and Rick Bayless's Mexican place. I love Green Line as well as 312. If you're actually dining in Goose Island, you should get a sampler and try season things, you will probably be pleasantly surprised.  The food is also pretty stellar. I normally order a burger with fries. The truffle cream that the fries come with upon request is the best that I've ever had. The quesadillas aren't bad either and they do have seasonal options that pair nicely with the new beer offerings. It is also best to follow Goose Island on Facebook because they post information on new beers all the time and every Thursday at 7:00 they host beer premiere Thursday so you get the chance to try something new.

2011-12-18,2.0,"Review of Brewery Tour and Tasting: Overall not one of the more exciting brewery tours/tasting I've been on. I like the style tours where you get to learn a little history of the brewery, see the fancy production area with the ""this is how beer is made"" bit and then leisure time to try the different beers in my newly acquired pint glass.  This tour didn't seem to come with much in my style. They don't produce most of their beers at this location, so you get the bit on how beer is made in the small room where they're brewing but don't see much of anything. Then they shovel everyone into a tasting room, line up seven glasses (of admittedly higher quality beer than the goose island standards). But they rush you through the tasting so fast it's hard to enjoy. Not to mention sitting at a table surrounded by strangers is kind of an awkward, forced environment for me. Besides having to essentially pound my drinks after the tasting so they could clear us out for the next tour, they don't label what drinks your having in each glass. Unfortunately, my memory is a lot less stellar when I can't see a name in writing (esp while attempting to rush through 7 beers), so I won't ever get to buy that lovely juniper flavored one I liked (cause I can't remember what it is called).

I've been on bunch of brewery tours.  Brewery tours have two parts: (1) the history/science (hops, barley...) lecture and (2) the tasting.  Goose Island Clybourne has pretty much disregarded part 1, which is fine since most people look forward to part 2. Once we got to the tasting room, the tour guide was eager to bring us through 6 different types of Goose Island brews, 3 of which were unavailable in bottle or tap at the time.  For the beer aficionados out there, the tour guide's descriptions from one type to the next were a nice peak into the head of Goose Island brewer bragging rights. Goose Island had the most guided beer tasting session of any tour I've been on.  While the description of the brewery seemed incomplete and perhaps misinformed (Goose Island started at Clybourne, off Goose Island?) the second half was well worth the visit.  Plus, you get a pint glass.",0.9145,0.86,0.098,0.042,0.41759259259259257

We ordered our food and when we got it we had some issues. The main thing was that by pulled pork was not edible at all. The plate was PURE GREASE.

2011-10-23,4.0,"As someone who really enjoys a beer...basically a beer in any situation exponentially increases the enjoyment of the situation, I could not go back to Chicago without stopping off at a Goose Island establishment. Being from New York, there is a adequate distribution of Goose Island in the area, but mainly for there larger production beers (312, Honker's, Harvest etc.) and their bottle line up (Matilda, Nightstalker, Sophie...). Walking into the brew pub itself and seeing so many additional beers at my disposal...I got excited. Started with a flight. Uncle Dunkel, Harvest, Dunkel Weizenbock and ESB. The Dunkel Weizenbock was fantastic. As was the Uncle Dunkel. Even the Harvest tasted a lot better from the source and on tap, then in any 6 pack that I could buy in NY. Then, because the gentleman next to me suggested, I had a pint of the Midway IPA, and was once again impressed by the ""hidden"" gems of Goose Island that I only had some idea of their existence. Then finished up with a 1/2 pint of the Honest Stout. Another winner that I have never seen in any form on the East Coast. And another point that can't be overlooked. Even though it was 1PM on a Thursday, there were still other people drinking at the bar. No one likes drinking at a bar alone...that much. The only food we ate while we were there was a quesadilla. While it was slightly off the beaten path in terms of typical quesadillas (I believe it was chorizo filled), it came out in such a perfect flattened, edges lined up, stuffing perfectly even and not really falling out of the slices, that I would not be in the least bit surprised to find out that it was just frozen and reheated. But nonetheless pretty good bar food to go with a flight and some additional tastings. Ever since the sale of Goose Island to InBev I was concerned that the quality and attention to detail would go down, in the name of mass production, because, well, that's what InBev does. But if the beers sampled at the Clybourn Pub are any indication, the future is still bright for Goose Island, and the attention to detail is certainly still there.

Because of my hometown roots, Goose Island Brewery holds a special place in my heart ... Upon checking in, we exchanged $7 a piece for some swanky, yellow wristbands. (Update: The tour now costs $10, but is still worth every penny.) This tour fee also entitles you to some free beer (totaling approximately a pint and half) and a complimentary logo pint glass, which is very nice. The aforementioned wristbands were our tickets to the inner sanctum of the brewery ... The tasting portion of the Goose Island Brewery tour is definitely the most organized and structured one that I've attended. We entered a large meeting room equipped with two long tables cutting through it ... No matter how tempting it may be to start gulping them down, resist the urge. Delayed gratification is a virtue. The reason to wait is that your tour guide will provide much-appreciated context to the beers that you're drinking. As we drank our beers, our expert guide, Wil, described each one, including the malty and bitter notes we might expect to taste ... The tour at Goose Island is a good one, although more for the tasting afterward than the actual tour.

I had the home-brewed Root Beer, which I had had before (from the grocery store); while it was good, it erred on the mellow side -- I like a creamy background but with a bit more of an herbal punch in root beer, and the latter was missing in this one. My mom was NOT happy when she ordered the ""Gooseberry-tini,"" some sort of fruity concoction, which she thought tasted like cough syrup (I had a sip; it did).

I think the food is here is just OK, but the beer definitely more than makes up for it. Pros - Beer! All kinds of beer! The restaurant had a number of ""regular"" Goose Islands (Geese Island?) like Honkers and 312, but also a number I'd never seen. I recommend the Summer Camp IPA. For those worried about the long-term effects of the recent Anheuser-Busch takeover of Goose Island, the menu offered a few ""guest"" beers as well.  - This place is BIG. Like, we-couldn't-find-our-friends-we-were-meeting-and-had-to-call-them-even-though-we-were-in-the-same-building big. That's pretty nice if you have a large party, or are planning on the whim. Cons - As previously mentioned, I think the food is only mediocre. I had the fish and chips, which tasted pretty run-of-the-mill. Then again, if you're coming to Goose Island for culinary intrigue, you may want to reevaluate your life choices. - The location is a little tricky to get to without a car. It's close enough to the North/Clybourn red line stop to walk, but it's a bit off the beaten path. If you're new to Chicago and want to see what all this fuss is about with 312, or if you're visiting and just want to get out of the hell that is Pizzeria Uno/Due/allthatcrapdownthere, then Goose Island could be a nice balance between true Chicago and familiarity.",0.8418,0.758,0.145,0.097,0.4966684830321195

Leave it to my beer loving friend from Denver to finally get me there.  After scoping out all of our possible brewery options, we decided on Goose Island.  Mostly because we could walk but also because we didn't feel like making a production out of dinner.  Perfect choice. I'm not a big fan of Belgian beers, which seems to be Goose Island's bread and butter.  I love dark beers and I really only found one beer that appealed to me.  The Liquid Inspiration was the only dark option on the menu.  It was good but I was hoping to have a few more choices.  My friend, however, was like a kid in a candy store, committed to trying as many options as possible.  She enjoyed the Uncle Dunkel, Pere Jacques and the Dream - a local collaboration.  I could appreciate all of them but they were just not my cup of tea. Our server was sweet as pie and very patient as we had several beers and ordered appetizers over a few hours.  We were originally planning to have dinner but the appetizers are huge.  We found ourselves stuffed after three of them.  The hummus was great and I appreciated that they served it with fresh cucumber and tomato.  The cheese sampler was interesting and I enjoyed trying some new types of cheese.  I also liked that they served reasonable portions of each so that I didn't devour too much.  The pretzels were also great, loved the jalapeno cheese sauce!

The place was jumping with activity and stout lovers from front to back.

It was also pretty cool to see that they treated everyone equally even at their own brewery. We managed to shimmy up to the nearest bar corner post and jumped right into the madness ordering up many many, and possibly a few too many taster portion swigs of heavy handed stouts. This was the kind of event where each sip delivered a leathery cowboy hand slap reminder that we were drinking man sized stouts.

After a short cab ride from Union Station, we are soon ready to drink some beer once we stake our our corner at the large rectangular bar that surrounds the bartenders.

Let me start off by saying I have never been impressed with the 312 which seems to be offered at most places (too light for my taste), but I do like the Honkers Ale and Matilda.  After arriving at the brewery on a weeknight I was pleased to see they had a nice chalkboard listing of beers on tap. And the waitress was super chill and seemed to know her stuff.  With so many choices, my buddy and I decided to each try a sampler of 4 each so we could try a broader range.  My buddy went for the pint afterwards, and I decided to try an additional 4 tasters. I liked the Kilgubbin quite a bit, a nice Irish Style Red Ale, very drinkable. The Midway IPA is an excellent IPA and beats out the regular IPA in taste and as its name implies is midway between the lower ABV content regular IPA and  the stronger Lake Effect IPA (good but too strong for session drinking).  Unfortunately they didn't have any of their nut brown or porters to taste since they are not in season, but I did enjoy their Oatmeal Stout.  On the lighter side, I did NOT like the Green Line American Style Pale (funky taste to me), but I did like the taste and name of the Citrine Bombshell Belgian Golden Ale.  The most strange one I tasted both in name and flavor is the Tingly Tongue.  I strongly suggest getting a taster of this one before you go for a full pour as it is very complex (peppercorn and Thai chili) and I appreciated it, but neither me or my buddy could finish the taster.  They also offer some great guest brews.  I liked the Finch's Cut Throat Pale Ale and the Flossmoor Station Pullman Brown Ale. On the food side, my friend tried the hangar steak sandwich which looked quite good.  I tried the Black Earth Burger which was good, but the goat cheese croquette ontop (looked like an onion ring) was a little strange for my taste.  My buddy got the very tasty seasoned homemade potato chips while I got the sweet potato fries as my side.  We liked them both, but I suggest going for the chips as they go well with the beer tasting.  Next time I think I would try the pork sliders as those looked good on another table nearby.",0.9981,0.768,0.198,0.034,0.49792735042735053

I would recommend that instead, Goose Island describe the brewing process as part of their overview of the beer tasting.

There was about 30-35 people on our tour and once everyone arrived and checked in, the entire group was ushered into a tiny room with huge tanks and then our tour guide started his speech.  It wasn't much of a tour since we spent about 30-40 min. standing in the same small space listening to the guide talk about the process of making beer, which was fine but I think most of us there were mostly interested in just sampling the beer! Once the guide finished his presentation, we were lead to a bigger room with long tables and chairs.  Everyone was seated at a placemat with 5 rather tiny pre-portioned samples infront of them.  The guide walked us through each sample as we tasted.  And that was the extent of the ""tour"".  We each received a Green Line Pale ale glass as a parting gift (whoopee). Dissatisfied with the stingy samples , we grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered full-size servings of the beers we had tasted during the tour and a basket of their tasty housemade chips.   The tour was a bit of a waste of time, not to mention it cost $10/person.  A far cry from the Sam Adams tour we did in Boston where the guide talked for about 20 min, and then lead us to tasting room where pitchers were passed around for all to share (and that tour was free!).

I have a poor tolerance for un-interactive tours (sorry, I'm a teacher), and this was just the worst.  I know Goose Island is a small brewery, and it's cool that there's only one room.  But charging $10 for a tour is a bit ridiculous.  I don't really know what the hipster said, because I zoned out after about 5 minutes of standing still. The beer tasting that followed was nice, but maybe a little more beer for the cost?  It's a tasting, but we did pay enough money for two drinks... Whatever, I tried it, now I will tell my friends to save themselves the time and just buy a 12-pack of 312.  I'll read the Wikipedia article on brewing beer to them while we get drunk.",0.4613,0.835,0.085,0.08,0.721875
2011-04-24,4.0,"Goose has come a long way since first introducing the beers that made them a well-known player in the craft beer game outside of Chicago (312 and Honker's Ale). Matilda's launch in 2005 made me a believer, and the birth of Sofie undeniably cemented my love. In my dreams, Sophie flows freely from my faucets and without calories, just like water. Atta girl. It's surprising that I'm not here more often considering my adoration for a bevy of beauties including Sofie and her sisters, Matilda, Fleur, Lolita and Juliet (and a dude by the name of Pere Jacques). It may have something to do with the food (it's fine, but not wow-worthy), the size (need to lose your date? You can do that without trying here) or the prices ($9 for pretzels? Yeesh). Besides all the Goose brews, the brewpub is always good for a couple guest drafts on tap (which, by the way, is a nice show of confidence, right?). If you're having a difficult time deciding on a beer, the staff has always been more than helpful in making a rec... or, take matters into your own hands and design a custom four-flight.  If it wasn't for the prospect of enjoying Sofie on draft, you can bet you'd find me parked on a bar stool at Hopleaf sipping on a Saison of some sort and savoring Belgian-style mussels for one.

2011-04-20,2.0,"Our one disappointment in Chicago. As a craft beer fan, I was hoping that this place would be much more... I don't know. Something. There was a great lack of character, and a lack of anything to help this joint stand out or be memorable. The waitstaff didn't seem to want to be there which was a stark contrast from everywhere else we'd eaten during the weekend we spent in Chicago. We got short questions, very little explanation about anything on the menu, and really, no explanation about the four menus we were handed when we sat. I felt somewhat unwelcome, and we tipped as such.  The food matched the decor of the pub, explicitly. Nothing wanted to stand out on it's own, each ingredient sort of just there on my burger and my future wife's cuban sandwich. It was good, sure. Great? Not even compared to a McDonalds. To be fair: There was a basketball game on TV, and a lot of people were there for that. I think the first game malaise may have set in and some of the waitstaff wanted to watch the game rather than give food to people. I get that. But, at the same time, be a little more excited about something. Walking around like a zombie? Probably not going to win you or your restaurant many stars. When I return to Chicago, I'll return to Goose Island. The beer was worth the trip and the star and a half, which needed to be rounded down.

2011-04-18,5.0,"What can I say, I love the Goose.  With all the recent news of their acquisition by AB, I knew I had to return to the brewpub for some pints and chow.  It has been far too long since we've been to the Goose. It's pretty much just as I remembered it. A good pub scene with a solid menu and outstanding beers. I was hoping that they would have that Bourbon County Stout that knocked me on my ass the last time I had it. No luck, it was not to be. What will we be drinking then? The Willow Street Wit for my little lady and a pint of the Midway IPA for me. Sadly, I was informed that the cask for the Midway had just broke down. However, I could still have a pint off the draft. Giddy up. That was a damn tasty pint and it packed a punch too. I'd dare say that it was the best beer I've had since their bourbon one. I couldn't stray from it for round two, Green line for my lady. We enjoyed every pint and it just confirmed that Goose Island is one of the best craft brewers around.  We started with the chicken quesadilla, mole chicken, queso fresco, pico de gallo, salsa roja. It was great. The menu had all the hits I remembered and a few new choices. I always loved that Stilton burger, but decided to pass on it. Would it be the banh mi, pork bbq or the Cuban? I went with the Cuban and it was a scrumptious sandwich. I'm used to it being pressed, but the tasty Slagel farms pork and ciabatta more than made up for it. I like how they source their ingredients from local farmers and growers. Rotisserie chicken sandwich for red was a hit for my picky eater. We both got the sweet potato fries with curry catsup and those were great.  The Goose was all that I remembered loving and then some. The Midway was a nice surprise, the hipster infestation was not. I'm pleased to say that I've seen no signs of the AB swill takeover, the Goose is still going strong.  I hope it doesn't ever change.

I've been dining there for quite a while, and over the past couple of years there's been an obvious effort to expand and upgrade the beer menu and the food offerings. It has retained pub faves such as fish & chips, and added many dishes featuring organic/local meats and cheeses. Tonight, we were in a walleye frame of mind, so had the fish & chips. Very satisfying -- tender, beer-battered walleye chunks served with very decent (not sweet, not too gloppy) coleslaw and tender, nearly crispy fries (much improved over past fries). We were also pleased with a small house salad with commendable oregano vinaigrette. I enjoyed a couple of Belgian-style ales -- they were tasty and nicely presented in appropriate stemware.

Like many others, I'm only reviewing the brew pub, not the beers, which are excellent. Where to begin with the shitshow that is this brew pub? The beginning seems like a good place. We walk in, and there is no hosting station. We stood around for a good 5 minutes, being passed by servers and runners, before one of them pointed out that there was in fact a hosting station, but on the other side of the restaurant. Something they should possibly consider making clear to those who come in the other door. We went over to the station and then still had to wait even though there were a gazillion empty seats. We eventually got seated. And then it got interesting. We had, hands down, the worst server ever. She was delightful, however, because she was so bad it reached the point of comedy. She was not unpleasant, mind you, she was just utterly incompetent. There were three of us, but only one menu. First act of brilliance. We asked for two more and she never brought the menus before asking what we wanted to drink. We decided to share since getting two more menus was beyond the realm of possibility. We ordered a few different food items and we each did a four-flight of beers. She came back with our beers mixed up and had to try and figure them out from memory, of which there clearly was none. This was laughed about in a stoner/airhead manner. I have to admit, it was funny. It got funnier when she spilled the bowl of bread all over me. One would think that at a brewery intending to highlight beers, they might actually want to get the flights correct so people knew what beers were what. Or at the very least have servers who can keep track of them. Nope. All in all, the place was a joke.  Stick to ordering their beers elsewhere.",0.9882,0.774,0.167,0.059,0.5497569444444445

I booked a beer tour for my BF and me.  Being from STL I expected a walking brewery tour and was surprised to find out that our tour lead us into one brewing room where the beer making process was explained to us.  However, the unique part of this tour was when we were taken into a large room and seated in front of six little beer samples.  There the brewer walked us through each one and patiently answer all our questions.  It was both informative and fun.   My BF and I decided to stay for dinner after the tour and was quite impressed by their quality of food.  We ordered the soft pretzels to share and my BF exclaimed that they were the best soft pretzels he has had so far!  I agreed with him!  The pretzels were doughy and soft inside and had just the right outside texture.  The japaleno cheese pretzel was our favorite.  Then for our entree we spilt the steak sandwich and some sweet potato fries.  We thought the steak was a little chewy but we liked how it the spread and the arugula on the sandwich complimented the juicy yet chewy steak.   My only complaint about this place was about our waitress Sara.  We saw her many times around our section but she only came to our table twice the entire time..once to take our order, and then we had to flag her down to get our bill.   Oh perhaps we saw her one more time when she quickly dropped off our beer and promised she would have our waters for us in her next trip.  We had to ask the other server who brought us our sandwich to get us our waters.  He came back in less than a minute's time so I am assuming that the trip to get water isn't three miles away.  She never even came back to check to see how our food is.  Since the rest of the servers were great,  I didn't feel a need to take a star away for that.",0.9794,0.907,0.086,0.007,0.482936507936508

When we first started, AJ was our server.  He was a very cool guy and answered our questions well.  He always came by to see how we were doing and was nice the whole time.  I wish he had been our server the whole night, but he had to check out somewhere down the line.  I gave him a fat 30%+ tip for being great.   We got stuck with Sydney after that.  She seemed really cool and fun in the beginning, but as the night progressed, she became rude and seemed annoyed at our group.  She thought I was trying to scam her into adding beers onto my MBA passport that I didn't drink.  Why would she even assume that?  I haven't done anything to make her assume that. That just left a bitter taste in my mouth, and it wasn't from the hops.  Afterwards, we needed help finding chairs to add to our table, so I asked her, ""Hey, are there any extra chairs anywhere?""

The selection of their own beers on draft is impressive - in addition to a few guest beers, including the local Philly-area brewery Victory Prima Pils! - but I went straight for their specialties, starting off with the Stone Fruit Sour Ale (Kolsch) - a collaboration with the chef of local Chicago eatery one sixtyblue.  The weather was warm that week, so it was a perfect cool-down beer. For eats, I went for the pulled pork sandwich with their sweet potato fries.  Be warned.  SO MUCH FOOD.  The tangy bbq sauce made with their Honker Ale covered the pulled pork shoulder on a gigantic brioche bun.  Cool tip: the bartender told me they give the spent grain from a brewed batch of beer to local farmers to feed their pigs. They then buy back these pigs to serve in the brewpubs.  Genius?  I think so.  Anyway, this food was more than enough for two people. But back to the beer.  I had to dive into some of the brews in their Belgian series, so I tried the tart saison Sofie beer (aged in wine barrels with orange peel) and the Matilda, a dry Belgian style Pale Ale, which were amazing. Last but not least, it was time for the behemoth - the highly acclaimed Bourbon County Stout - a bourbon aged imperial stout which packed a punch at 13.5 ABV.  And it was amazing.

As it is, I went here with my friend and his girlfriend for his birthday to do the tour and have a few beers after The tour of the brewery itself was relatively small, but the tasting part was easily the best. We went into the main room where they have their big tanks and one of the brew masters explained the variety of beers they make and what they make. I was more looking around at all of the stills of beer as I'm very familiar with and was just enjoying checking out the barrels behind me. We then moved into a room to taste through 6 different beers. The brew master explained the differences in the beers and asked us if we liked/disliked the beers in front of us and why we liked or disliked it. The good thing was that they didn't give us any of their most common beers, in fact the most known beer that they gave us was the matlida, so there's definitely no complaints there. After the tour we moved to the bar and sat down to have a few more beers and get a bit of food in us. I grabbed some of the IPA and got myself some fish n chips. They did a damn good job on the fish n chips and the serving was pretty big as well.  My only complaint would be that they need to open up the food menu more.

Not the server's fault, although she really didn't ever look to be attempting to hustle at all (nor did anyone else for that matter). We counted at least six other tables she was serving - there were probably more around the corner. So she's in the weeds, so to speak, and it's management's fault for under-scheduling. When the check finally comes, they're trying to charge $4 to add a side of fries I had to ask for because they were somehow mistakenly left off the plate even though they come with my burger.  We decide to ask for a manager. Her excuse (which she said was ""not an excuse"") is that the Chicago Marathon has made them busier than usual today. Seriously? It wasn't that busy, plenty of open tables. You had to know the Marathon was coming, it was no secret, so why not staff up? A second off-handed excuse was basically that ""it's a bar."" Sooooo, our expectations were too high? You offer supposedly gourmet food, have a host stand, booths, tables, waitresses, etc. Looks like a restaurant to me. My mistake, I guess. One I won't make again as I won't be back.  Then, despite our insistence that it wasn't necessary, she comped a meal and the drinks. Okay, thanks, but it really just shows you still weren't listening. We didn't want a free meal, just our check fixed to reflect what we actually ordered (and to offer the subtle observation that you're understaffed, since we called you over here). Anyway, on top of all that, the food wasn't really anything special. Nothing you can't get at a dozen other places within walking distance, some of it considerably cheaper. The burgers were bland and, well, so bland I can't call it anything other than bland. They left no other impressions. The fries that finally came out were totally run-of-the-mill, nothing impressive. Soup was okay, even tasty, but still not really significantly better than similar offerings at other restaurants in the area. The beer is the only bright spot. Everyone knows this so I won't beat that drum any further except to say that, thankfully, most of it is available at your local grocery store so you don't have to come here to get it. Come to think of it though, as good as GI's beer is, why come here for it when you can get the same beer - and actually much more considering the other equally great brands available - at just about any reasonably decent bar in the city?

I ordered a burger, and my husband ordered a salad. The burger wasn't horrible, but it was hardly gourmet, as advertised. The salad had so much oil, it was completely overkill. After I convinced my husband to return it, (which the guy at the bar was pretty cool about) he got it back, and found the oil partially reduced. Big deal? Maybe not, but over-dousing a salad pretty much kills it. I love Goose Island beer. But, unless I'm just coming out for drinks, I won't be stopping by again. (Also the ambiance was pretty boring).",0.9864,0.772,0.195,0.033,0.5395833333333333
2010-10-08,3.0,"For someone who's not a beer guy (at all), I find that spending time at Goose Island isn't that bad at all. Parking is the hardest part, but after 8:00 things lighten up considerably. My one complaint is that it's quite pricey. My wife and I kicked things off with their Oatmeal Stout (cask) and Sofie. I liked both. No, I have no idea what to look for in a good beer, but I know this beer wasn't bad. We hadn't eaten dinner yet, so I order the mole pollo with a buttermilk breading, and my wife had a chicken pub sandwich with bacon. The chicken was $9, and the sandwich was $11. These weren't very large portions, either, so I was hoping the quality was worth it in the end. They were ok. The chicken (all dark meat: one thigh, one leg) was moist and tender, and I appreciated the buttermilk breading, but I don't remember either heat or spices on the mole. I think the ingredients were all there, they just didn't stand out like mole I've had in the past. Certainly none of the smokiness I've associated with previous moles. My wife's sandwich came with fries, which were good, though nothing special. The sandwich was quite good--yay bacon--but at $11, it had to be. For dessert, we had by far the best dish of the night - honey ricotta cheesecake with vanilla ice cream. This was well, well worth the $8 -- the crust of the cheesecake was steeped in honey, and honey was poured all over the top of the cheesecake. The ricotta gave the cheesecake an ideal, almost strangely crunchy texture. It was very, very good. This wasn't bad food by any stretch of the imagination, I just thought it was about 20% too expensive. Fortunately some good beer made up for it. It's definitely much better than your average bar food.",0.9959,0.748,0.206,0.046,0.5452083333333332

I have had some Goose Island beers back home (Boston), and I've liked most of them, but it was nice to try some of their smaller batch offerings. Quality beers all around.  The food looked good but was the tiniest bit pricier than I would expect in a place like this. We weren't very hungry so we split a cheese plate ($16 i think?) that was pretty tasty and came with pistachios in addition to the usual cheese/bread/jam situation. Good times.

2010-09-02,4.0,"After wandering the streets of Cabrini-Green for about an hour, we were able to make it to the Goose Island pub in the early afternoon for a few celebratory beers. However, before reviewing a few of our more memorable brews, we have to commend or compliment the glory that is the Stilton burger. Pumpernickel bread with full roasted garlic cloves topped with an abundant amount of Stilton cheese, the burger is the epitome of indulgence in regards to bar food. Truthfully, even at a fancier restaurant, the burger could have been comparable to some of the gourmet burgers we have had in the past. 312 Urban Wheat Ale: For one reason or another, the beer reminds us of the microbrews back in the Northwest; smooth with a notable finish. While the beer is definitely worth trying while you are in Chicago, save a bit of time at the brewery if you plan on drinking elsewhere at some point during your trip because 312 Urban Wheat Ale is offered at nearly every bar in the city. Black Imperial IPA: Simple dark brew with a high alcohol content, the Black Imperial IPA ranges somewhere above eight percent and had a smooth beginning with a hoppy finish that rounded out the end of our meal relatively well. Green Line Pale Ale: As far as local urban Chicago brews, the Green Line Pale Ale is considered to be environmentally sustainable and remains one of our favorites in the city. With a hint of Amarillo hops, the Green Line Pale Ale is amazingly light on the palate and was actually our choice to complement the heaviness of the Stilton burger. Hex Nut Brown Ale: With a relatively low alcohol content, the Hex Nut Brown Ale was a good complement to the chicken club sandwich that we had ordered. The initial malt flavor with the stronger finish complemented nicely with the saltiness and the relative dryness of the sandwich and reminded us of the popular Mac & Jack brew of the Northwest. Pere Jacques: Darker beer with a heavier European flavor, the taste of caramel is definitely present and it seems that the heavier finish would be complement for exotic flavors with a rooted citrus flavor. However, one glass of the Pere Jacque at the end of a meal is probably ideal to sip slowly as it is definitely not a beer to indulge in quickly. While there are dozens of beers to choose from, the above five are the brews that have left a lasting impression with us, but the bartenders are courteous and attentive and each of them are than willing to showcase their brews with endless samples. And, especially if you are looking for an education on beer or would like to experience all the brewery has to offer, sit at the bar because sitting anywhere else means slower service with less attention from the staff unless you only plan on ordering food.",0.982,0.917,0.08,0.003,0.41856739305891844

As in, they swished their beer around and sniffed it prior to drinking to detect the subtle odors of elderberry or some such nonsense.  My worries were for naught. While beer takes center stage, the food was not forgotten. I had the Goose A-Peel with the calamari salad and a side of sweet potato fries with curry ketchup. The beer was nice, but I couldn't really taste the alleged clementine flavor. Easy enough to drink and didn't weigh me down. The salad was actually decent. Crisp greens, tangy dressing, and the fry on the calamary kept the whole thing from being too healthy. My favorite of the night, however, were the sweet potato fries. The curry ketchup that came with, to be exact. The curry was subtle and went really well with the saltiness and earthiness of the sweet potatoes.  Service was tattooed and pleasant.

Needless to say, I LOVED the beer-sampler special at Goose Island! And I love that they kept the menus with beer descriptions at the table for us to read while we were trying everything. Its definitely a must do if you're going to be drinking here. And five samples for $8?! Not bad! Also, if bar food is your favorite food group (like me!) you definitely need to dine here as well.

So off we went. Somewhere in my Goose Island hiatus the menu changed.  Trust me, that's a good thing.  While it's by no means a big menu, they cover the bases with things like burgers, fish & chips, salads, soups and small plate appetizers.  Hell, they even have duck confit flatbreads, for crying out loud.  That's a huge menu upgrade from the Goose Island of yesteryear. I dove hungrily into my veggie burger topped with pico de gallo and the side salad with the house vinaigrette.  My veggie burger was nice.  It was a great surprise to have it topped with pico de gallo for a bit of heat and Latin flair.  The side salad was actually mixed field greens with tomatoes and carrots.  The only disappointment was the vinaigrette.  If something is touted as the 'house' dressing, I expect it to have some oompf, but this dressing was nothing more than vinegar and oil.  Fine by me, but not what I had in mind. My bro-in-law dominated his fish and chips (the verdict was ""awesome"") and my dad was in love with his Stilton burger.  Once I assured him that Stilton is a type of British bleu cheese, he went for it.  Its pepper-crusted burger, Stilton cheese, roasted garlic cloves and German mustard served on pumpernickel bread.  Kind of stinky from the cheese and garlic, but dad reported it was one of the best burgers he's had in a long time.  And very ""different.""  I'm going to assume it's different for him because he lives on a pretty steady diet of suburban standbys like Chili's and TGIFridays, but I'm glad he went for something outside his comfort zone and really enjoyed it. Our server was top-notch, too.  She brought my little nephew his kiddie cheeseburger and fries right when they were ready, kept our diet Pepsis (no Coke products here, which stinks) full and was incredibly pleasant. I'm happy I found my way back to Goose Island.  It's a Chicago institution for a reason, you know.",0.9949,0.82,0.147,0.032,0.5515282392026578

The service was good except for one hitch, they handed us the wrong bill, and gave us the 60 dollar bill of the people next to us, not the 15 dollar bill which was ours. But, it was a simple mistake. So, no big deal. They suggested beers which would be good, helped us set out a good flight, were really knowledgeable about their product. When I go to a place which is a brewery, what really makes or breaks the place is if you can tell if the people their actually love beer, or if it's just another product that they are slinging. The people here definitely seemed to be in the category of having a love for beer, and it showed ith their excellence. The fries we had with aioli was pretty good, was ooked well, the sauce was good. In total, I would go back for the beer, which was very good. Maybe next time If I had more time I would eat more. Not a lot of vegetarian option on the menu though.

2010-03-23,2.0,"I've been to Goose Island twice now. The first time was a great experience, we did the tour sampled lots of beers and really enjoyed the food. That was about a year ago. Their beers are decent, somewhere between a Miller and a true craft beer in my opinion. Depending on when you go they do have some good guest beers as well. I recently went again with the same group as a year ago and was heavily disappointed. I don't know if they've either let their quality slip or it was because  on the previous trip we were partially drunk from the tour and sampling. I'm basing all of my following points on my most recent trip. First of all the beer. Not bad, I definitely like their stuff better on tap than out of the bottle. Like I said before, decent guest beers but all their house beers seem a bit safe and watered down. I'm not sure if they've change or simply my tastes have matured more. Their guest beers were definitely better than their house beers, however they don't have a very large selection of those. There are many better choices in the city for getting various craft beers. Food: I'd give this 3 stars. Love the hot wings, mussels were decent, and everything else was average. The price was very high though in my opinion considering the quality. I doubt they have a chief coming up with these recipes. More likely they simply pulling out frozen and premade stuff honestly. Its not bad, but its not that great either. Also their menu is very small for such a large place. Service: BOOOOOOOOO. Our waitress was terrible and we often had to flag her down just to get another round after waiting with empty glasses for far too long. Even after ordering you'd have to remind her about things otherwise chances are high she'd forget you even ordered anything. During our time there their system went down and we couldn't order anything at all so we sat there with no beer or food for probably our first 15 to 20 minutes there. Atmosphere: Meh, nothing great or bad about it either way honestly. It was rather loud, but what else would expect at that sort of place on a Friday night. The Tour: Not a waste of time, but nothing special at all. They take you on a ""tour"" of their tiny little operation there which only serves to provide the tap house with beer or uncommon specialty beers. They don't offer tours of their larger facility which is a big disappointment. If you've been on any other tour before then you'll find this unexciting and dull. It is nice getting to taste all their beers after the tour though, however I personally only liked a handful for them. I'm giving them a 2 overall. Had my most recent experience been the only one it'd be a 1 but since my previous trip was more enjoyable I'll kick them up to a 2. I don't know if they're changed things or we just came on a bad day but I highly doubt I'll ever be returning to Goose Island after my most recent trip.

2010-03-08,4.0,"Brewery Tour Review Only:  Every Sunday Goose Island offers three tours in the afternoon.  They are $7/person and fill up quickly, so you better call about a week (or more) in advance if you want to do it.  If it's already full, you can get on the wait-list and they do call everyone else to confirm, so chances are you still might make it! Our 4pm tour group consisted of about 35-40 people.  We were led through the restaurant to the behind the scenes area where we were looking at the huge drums (This is pathetic that I can't even think of the technical term, especially since I JUST went on the tour) where they brew the various beers for the restaurant.  Our tour guide was great, very personable and informative.  He passed around containers of hops and barley for everyone to sniff and check out.  This is more of a lecture while standing in the beer-brewing area, so don't picture yourself wandering around through the bowels of Goose Island, it's really just not that big.  We stood and listened to the beer-brewing lecture for about an hour (be warned, it's not very warm back there, so be prepared to keep your coat on), people were able to ask questions, and then we went to the tasting room. Two long tables were set up for the tasting and pitchers of beer got passed down the tables and everyone filled up their own glasses (we got to try six different beers).  I would definitely recommend sitting towards the front of the room where the pitchers are launched, because everyone was trying to ration the beer out by the end of the table every time.  One strange thing - our guide had three pitchers of every beer but kept giving two pitchers to the other table and only one to ours every time... which I didn't understand because there were the same number of people at each table and we ended up rationing out for the last 1/3 of our table, while the other table kept ending up with leftovers.  Boo.   The whole tour/lecture/tasting took about 2 hours and you got a Goose Island pint glass to take home.  Bonus!   They also have a shared parking lot (which is busy, so you may or may not get lucky), or there's pretty easy metered street parking around. BOTTOM LINE:  The guide was very knowledgeable and informative and it was interesting to learn more about all the different beers that I didn't even realize Goose Island makes.  The tasting was fun, but definitely sit towards the front.  This is something I'd do once but wouldn't feel the need to do multiple times.",0.9902,0.883,0.103,0.014,0.498494560994561
2010-03-07,5.0,"I've been going to Goose for over 10 years. This is the spot to go to for great craft beer from Chicago. The variety of beer ranges from the dangerously drinkable (312, Honkers, Green Line) to the on-the-edge-of-a-hangover-and-loving-it (Bourbon County Stout, the Belgians, the Russian Imperial Stout). First Thursday of the month, they unveil a new beer for tasting. I think this is around 6 p.m. Don't quote me. Usually, this stuff gets consumed pretty quickly. Last time I was lucky enough to try this, they had the Frankenporter, a porter which was freakishly hopped. I can't imagine many people heading to Goose without having a beer. Still, if you're looking for non-beer, Goose makes excellent sodas. Their orange cream soda and root beer are right tasty. Food. It's pub food. But it's really, really good. The burgers are great. I had a pork tenderloin sandwich which was really tasty. I dig the soft baked pretzels. And yes, the pub chips are pretty fantastic. Become a frequent visitor. Earn your MBA (masters of beer appreciation). Drink different beers, get free growlers along the way. My review wouldn't be complete without mentioning what Goose means to the area and to craft brewing in the midwest. Before Goose Island came along, that little area was pretty crappy in terms of businesses. In 20+ years, that area has transformed into someplace cool to shop, eat and drink, much because of Goose. Several former Goose employees have gone on to either work at other beer companies or start their own (the new cat's whiskers Revolution comes to mind). So, head to Goose.

2010-03-03,4.0,"I've held off reviewing Goose Island Brew Pub whilst I settle an internal conflict - do I review Goose Island based strictly on my beer drinking experience, or do I rate this place keeping in my mind my thoughts on the food too?    If it's based purely on beer - 5 stars, hands down. Their beer is pretty amazo - even 312 (which is EVERYWHERE...even Podunk, Iowa, also known as my hometown)isn't bad. I especially heart Pere Jacques (inundation of fruity maltiness in a highly alcoholic Belgian style ale) and the mother of all beers, the Bourbon County Stout (their website states it best - ""an intense mix of charred oak, chocolate, vanilla, caramel and smoke. One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer"")...yes, yes it does.  I've tried most of their ""regular"" beers, and have yet to try one I don't like. Happiness in a glass, that Goose Island beer. Now, moving on to their food, because being an upstanding Yelp citizen, I feel I must do my due diligence here. Okay, so you're not gonna be bowled over by the grub here. Fair enough. However, there are a few gems to be noted.  * Bavarian Pretzels - these things are flippin awesome (especially paired with the Bourbon County Stout mustard). Carbo loading you can't help but love.   * Pub Chips - surprisingly good. I'm not a chip fan, but these ain't bad * Cabot Cheddar Burger - Loves me some cheese.  I think they may have debuted a few new items on their menu, so there is a distinct possibility the food has improved somewhat since my last experience there.

The servings are of perfect size for tasting (see my photo). My first beer was the Kölsch. It was smooth on the tongue and easy to drink. I liken it to Samuel Adams Summer Ale. The Oatmeal Stout was next, and it was also very delicious. Third was the Dunkel, which was a bit too strong for my tastes. It seemed to me that this beer had too much going on.  Finally, there was the Burbon County Stout. Let me tell you, this stuff is strong. It has a whopping 13% ABV and a very strong aroma of burbon. When burbon is made, it is aged in wood barrels. When they are finished making the burbon, these barrels are sent to Goose Island, and they age their beer in them.

(And let the record state that I HAVE eaten here about 4 years ago... so I at least get a ""chicago green card"" hehe). The atmosphere of the bar just fills the entire place.  The bar is always occupied with inquisitive faces of the new beers on tap, and the tables have people sitting in front of tasty looking food.  For those who hate TV on walls, stay away because they are present on most walls.... but know that they are not loud, and most people are too involved eating to even care to look.  The beer is my favorite in Chicago.   Honker's Ale is a classic standby for any occasion.  The Summer Ale is the best for the beaches.  The Mild Winter Ale is wonderful for staying indoors and watching movies with hearty food. And the Matilda is a very fine belgium-style beer that makes me wanna kiss the next girl I meet called Matilda. Delicious.  No worries if you are unsure about your beer to drink. They have a nice beer menu and the waiters/bartenders are super helpful and offer samples for no charge.  The food is outright great, albeit, a bit pricey.  The menu is not very vast, but what they have is done with much care and love of the food.  The Beer Nachos was splendid - had a very nice touch of beer IN the cheese.  The tiny shredded pork burgers were great too - but a bit pricey at $4 for a slider.  Come here with friends and plan on spending a few hours.  You know you wanna try the beers that you can't find in the stores!  And heck, try out the rest of the beers on tap while you are at it!  :-)     (Just a short walk from the North Ave Redline stop).

They have lots of their good stuff on tap.  The list is different every time you go and I appreciate that they offer a handful of beers you can't buy in bottles, making it worth a trip.  Yet the prices for their beers is awful high considering you're at the brewery.  I regularly get their beers on tap at other places for cheaper.  I love doing the sampler, but at 14-16 bucks you do suffer some sticker shock.

To start from the beginning, about three months out from our wedding date, it was clear our original venue wasn't working out, so we began looking for a new one. When I first met with their event planner, Sandra, I was impressed by her professionalism and amiability. I never imagined Goose Island would be willing to close for a private event on a Saturday, but (lucky for us) they were!  Goose Island had made some impressive revisions to their menu in the last year, shifting to a more local, seasonal focus, and that was reflected in the catering menu. We had great options to choose from, at fairly low prices. All of the food we tasted and settled on was delicious. Because of the nature of the space, we had to have a buffet, which I was initially against. However, the staff was responsive and we were able to come up with an arragnement that didn't involve 180 wedding guests standing in line for one buffet. The day of the reception went wonderfully! The Goose Island staff set up the table decor, etc. for us, and did a great job. It looked beautiful, and everything was where it should have been. The staff was responsive and friendly throughout the night; no one seemed to lack anything. They also let us offer our guests brewery tours, which was a cool touch.

The Sriracha wings are out of this world, as are the pork sliders. The nachos are huge and come with everything (and are deliscious), and even the falafal I had here was really good - spicy, flavorful, and a great pairing with my beer. And, of course, the beer. I love it all. The beer menu changes ever so often based on the seasons, and always has a good mix of everything - so if you come with picky beer drinkers, there's something here even for the boring Bud Light fan.

We begin ascension with Replicale, a refreshing beer that i swear has some banana in the mix, along with orangey, lemony citrus flavors. Alone, it's very light with almost no head. Later with platter of cheesy nachos, the beer turns to Kool Aid. This would be great ice cold during a hot summer unlike our current conditions. As our flight continues, we rise to Fleur, an ale that according to the menu is ""infused with hibiscus.""  Maybe. What it does possess is that smooth quality found in Belgian-style ale that comforts the tongue and later the stomach. The taste of the Fleur is totally lost in the nachos. It just can't hold up to the powerful flavors on the plate yet delicious on its own. Next up into the clouds its a celebration b-tches. Actually, it's Celebration Red, a ""dark crystal malt"" with a ""brilliant red hue."" Of the tastes, so far, this is the most familiar to me. This is a fuller bodied hop fest variation on Killian's Red. For me, this beer holds up best with the nachos. Wonderful. Finally I arrive at my destination of the Night Stalker, a ""pitch black imperial stout"" that has this incredible chocolate roasted nutty flavor that would be great in a float. The Night Stalker at my ascension quickly sends me back to earth with a level of 11.7 percent alcohol. The closest thing this resembles is Guinness Stout but it's so much tastier.

As for the latest incarnation of the menu, kudos to John Manion. I appreciate the thoughtfulness in using local products and the result is fantastic.

The Cuban sandwich was delicious--I'm slowly learning that one really can't go wrong with two types of pork. The steak sandwich had a lot going on, but was quite tasty.  The pork slider was nicely complemented by its slaw topping and the fish taco was fan-freaking tastic. I agree with the other reviewers on the fries--the old ones were better, but I was no means offended by the current version. The potato salad was heavy on the stone ground mustard which was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s! The portions are pretty big, so I definitely skipped dessert. I did partake in a half pint of the Willow St. white ale--a Belgian style ale and a half of IPA (my favorite). The service was solid.

Granted, my wife and I ordered our usual two servings of fried fish and potatoes, so we're not looking at the whole spectrum of the menu, but we were heartily disappointed. Service remained affable. We were here about 6 weeks ago and had no problem devouring the savory 12+ ounce portion of fish that settled so comfortably like a rock in my belly, nicely accompanied by zesty oh-so-garlicky thin-cut fries. This was downed with a couple of brews, and the meal was kicked off nicely by some onion rings ding-a-linging their way down my gullet. That is what I like, and was what I expected upon entering the restaurant this evening. This time, we were greeted with a TINY 4-5 ounce portion of four paltry Walleye strips. Although nicely done, my five-year old took one off each plate, leaving us with THREE small fish sticks and a funnel of cold pasty fries. And they weren't garlicky or thin cut. If you're going to give me crappy fries, at least make them HOT. The coleslaw was despicable: warm, Tex-Mex seasoned, watery and inedible.

For dinner the Stilton Burger came recommended to me by my friendly server.  I gave it a go.  The menu describes it as ""Pepper-crusted burger, Stilton cheese, garlic cloves, German mustard, pumpernickel bread.""  It was $12.   A bit steep for a burger in my books, but I'm not familiar with Chicago prices so I don't know what the going rate is.  It was cooked to order.  I liked the garlic cloves.  The stilton cheese takes a bit of getting used to, it is nice to try something a little different from the usual American cheese or faux Swiss that one normally finds on burgers.  The bread was decent, but not OK.  It came with a large mound of pretty tasty fries. I tried two beers while I was there.  I had enjoyed the Honker's Ale the night before at another venue.  This time I tried the India Pale Ale and the nitro Dead Goat Porter.  Both were quite tasty, I certainly would not object to drinking either of those again.

After our snacks were devoured, we ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which is served with shoestring fries,  blue cheese on the side and some coleslaw (I think - I had a few Matildas, so the coleslaw is in question, but not a deal breaker.)  Sandwich was very good - it was devoured as well.

FOOD:  The food was alright.  We had nachos which I thought were awesome.  Then I had a buffalo chicken sandwich which was mediocre.  The garlic fries were strong, but good.  My fiance had the Ceasar chicken wrap which she said was no better than the one at Baker's Square. DRINK:  We really need not go here.  Goose Island beer is very good.  I tried a different one that I have had and then had a couple of the usuals.  I like the Mild Winter.  They had a few special brews on tap also.  It is worth going to the brewery for the fresh taste and to get the special brews. ATMOSPHERE:  This is where it could have gotten better.  For some reason, we were in a room with children screaming.  I dont know why people bring children to a brewery for dinner, but it annoyed me.  Plus, we were sat in the side room right next to a door.  Rather cold after we just walked in the cold to get there.  Not much of a mood in there.  Would have preferred to sit in the nice large warm room with fancy wood everywhere and an eleborate bar.

Oh dear. Another cataclysmic error on my part. I'll begin with the exhortation in the lead paragraph. This venue got a reprieve, bunky, thanks to the real estate and banking _crash_, which combined to prevent Goose Island's money-grubbing landlord from selling the space to a Chili's or Outback Steakhouse. Get here. Today. There will always be a good beer here which you shall enjoy. That is, unless you're one of the deluded dunderheads who think that beer begins and ends with allusions to ""less filling"".

It is a strong beer, coming in a goblet, and commanding a higher price [but it was one of the two beers on special on Thursday]. I had planned ahead and arrived here from Mr. Beef on Orleans. Eating one (or two) italian beef sandwiches there will definitely stave off any problems from consuming high-alcohol beers on draft here.  The venue has DirecTV® and (I believe) the NFL and Major League B**eball out-of-market packages.

Last year at this time, it tried to increase the *size* of its pub burger and the price it correspondingly charged for it. This caused as much of a brouhaha on the Chicago Beer Society's listserv as I can ever recall. It recanted on the size and price a few months thereafter. [*Then* came the announcement that its landlord didn't want to renew the lease.] Goose Island Clybourn earns the five-star rating based on the quality of its beers, its historical significance to the culinary scene of the City of Chicago, and its catalyst for reviving a hum-drum neighborhood [in 1988] into one which puts revenue into the city's coffers. Transit options: The *best* Winter route here is the Brown or Purple Line ""L"" to _Armitage_; and walking south along Sheffield Ave. Sheffield is residential. Its sidewalks are generally swept.

The pretzels were a bit salty, but the onion rings were pretty good.  The veggie burger was excellent, although I didn't have it this time, I have in the past and it's outstanding.  I had the tuna steak on french bread, and my mistake was to order garlic fries.  You would have thought they'd be perhaps cooked in garlic with some seasoning.  Turns out, they're plain fries with four-plus cloves of garlic smooshed on top and around the fries.  Seriously? Their beer is good, I wasn't overly impressed with their selection this time, but the shitty service (and their take on ""garlic fries"") made me a little disappointed their lease had been renewed.",0.9621,0.716,0.173,0.111,0.5299272486772487

I was pleasantly surprised at the juiciness and seasoning on the patty. I bit my boyfriend's burger to compare and mine was actually much more flavorful. I did however like the corn salsa and chili peppers (it doesn't come with actual chili) that they put on his burger.  In the end, the whole meal was nothing spectacular.

Made a special trip North of downtown after visiting the Skydeck at Sears Tower and was not disappointed with what we found. The building is some sort of converted brick structure with a bit of a rambling interior layout. When we entered there was a windowed area that looked into the brewery so you had an idea of what was going on there. The decor inside was what one would expect from a bar with lots of wooden booths and brick walls and old beer memorabilia. There was a large central bar with plenty of folks bellying up for a pint or three. The wi-fi was good and the beers were plentiful. The dizzying array of choices reminded me a bit of Rogue Brewery back home, and that is not always a compliment. I sometimes think a brewery that tries to do too many beers sometimes can lose focus on the styles they do well.  I tried a few beers and came away with mixed results. The pale ale was nothing special but they had a well crafted belgian style ale with good yeast tanginess balanced well with malt and hops. Oh yeah, they make their own soda pop as well.

When we arrived, we checked in and got wrist-banded (they even carded my grandparents... they loved it) and gave us each a nice quality souvenir pint glass  We ordered beers at the bar to carry with us on the tour (they were not included in the $5 admission.) They then brought us into a little classroom where we sat in rows and looked through the pamphlets they gave us.  We all got a little excited when we saw the six sampling glasses set at each seat. Our tour guide came in and gave us a little overview of the brewing process.  I'll be honest - he is in the wrong profession.  He was a pretty terrible tour guide.  He seemed like a nice guy but he seriously should not be giving tours - he was long-winded, overly technical, extremely unengaging and just overall bad.  He mentioned that he also works in marketing for Goose Island - he should not quit his day job, that's for sure.  Regardless, he eventually took us down to the room to see where the brewing actually happens.  It was a small room and we crowded in and listened to him go on for a while.  This may be a really fantastic tour with a different guide - I certainly hope he doesn't do all of them. Even so, though, it wasn't much of a tour - we just stood in the room for a while and then went back up to the room.  I was glad we had ordered beers in advance so at least we had something to drink while our eyes glazed over. I felt like I didn't learn much about brewing or Goose Island - I learned about the molecular structure of hops, but not anything that the average layperson could take away. After the ""tour,"" we went back to the classroom for the tasting.  Now this part actually was fun!  Our guide passed around pitchers and we each got to try a sample of six different beers.  The papers they had given us gave a nice description of each beer we tried and it was really interesting to compare the different flavors.  Everyone in my group really enjoyed this part - even Nana kept going back to the pitcher!  The atmosphere was pretty lively and fun and we hung out for quite some time. Overall, this was a fun activity for my group.  I wish they would call it a sampling or a tasting or something, rather than a tour.  It really wasn't much of a tour and our guide was just not good.  However, the tasting portion was a lot of fun and the souvenir glass plus the six samples were definitely worth the $5.  I probably wouldn't go back a second time, but if you have guests or are just looking to pass a Sunday afternoon, there are definitely worse things to do in Chicago.",0.9971,0.809,0.157,0.035,0.4721616895345709

2008-02-25,5.0,"I could compose a poem on how much I love Goose Island, but will stick to writing this review instead. This is a brewpub with the volume turned way up - the brews are first rate, and the food raises the bar on the usual greasy bar food you find at most places. Sure, the menu's predominantly American standards like burgers, sandwiches, nachos, chili, and onion rings, but they're presented and taste like no other pubgrub you've tasted. Might be the quality of ingredients or focus on flavor rather than oil, either way it's great. And the food only serves to highlight the beers even more - be it the signature 312, or one of the reserves like the Pere Jacques.  On a sidenote, try Goose Island's weekend brewery tour. It's given by the owner, who's both knowledgeable and extremely friendly. The tasting includes half a dozen brews that you serve yourself, ie: no tiny pre-portioned samples. You come away feeling informed, with a free souveneir glass to boot. All for just $5!",0.985,0.786,0.185,0.029,0.5117063492063492

My first trip was with a good friend that had given up on the place because of bad food and lackluster beers.  He decided to give it a shot and sure enough, we were both sold.  The kitchen was closed when we got there, but our server tracked down a couple baskets of pub chips. Many, many, many, many trips back for dinner with friends and the occasional birthday party, GI became a staple.  The regular cast of brews are all solid and the seasonal and small-batch beers gave me an opportunity to expand my beer knowledge.  I'm almost finished with my second MBA card, but thanks to stingy rules and an outdated MBA card, I doubt it gets finished. The food has always been a bit pricey for a pub, but I put up with it because it was usually a better quality and the great beer made up for it.  That was until Tuesday... I had heard that the menu was re-worked a little, but I didn't expect to see price jumps in pretty much everything on the menu.   $10 for beer nachos?! $13 for a burger with cold, crappy fries?! $14 for a plate of what used to be Chicago's best fish and chips but now is a cheap white fish substitute for the walleye that formerly hit the spot (if that was walleye, they need to get new fishermen). The mini-munchies are gone, as is the brat, the brisket, and apparently the sealant in their roof (seriously, snow was falling inside). Where have you gone, enjoyable but slightly overpriced Goose Island?  Instead I get bland food and a cold, snowy table. You get two stars for the beer, GI.  It deserves more... especially that Oatmeal Stout I had on cask the other night... but the negative stars for price gouging and a crappy new menu throws everything out of whack. Sometimes, you try something new, like Pepsi Clear or New Coke, and you realize what you had all along was great.  This is one of those times, GI.  Fix it.

So you have loads of people, three bartenders, and you literally have to yell and wave your arms to get the bartenders' attention!

2007-08-08,4.0,"I know what you're thinking: are the differences between the Wrigleyville location (2 stars) and the North/Clybourn location (4 stars) really that pronounced?  I'd have to answer yes for several reasons. The menu is the same, and the food is equally well-prepared at both brewpubs.  The service seems to be more relaxed and friendly here, but the food doesn't separate the two.  The service difference, however, is probably worth about a half a star. The beer selection is much larger, all year round.  There's no need to wade through several blander styles during the summer, though lighter beers are of course still available.  It's nice, however, to have the option of having a strong weizenbock (one of my favorite styles, and very hard to find) in the early summer or a couple of lighter wheat beers even during the winter.  The big improvement in beer, year-round, is probably worth another star. The crowd is also much better, in my opinion.  It's not nearly as crowded at most times, and the people who do come here tend to be friendlier and more knowledgeable about the beer.  It's much easier to strike up a conversation with the boozehound next to you here than it is at the Wrigleyville location, and most bars in the city in general.

Luckily they had rented a 50 or so inch Samsung HDTV for use on the patio. We grabbed a few tables up close for our party and started the long journey which is Superbowl Sunday. We were politely informed that we would have a day waitress and a night/game waitress and that 18% gratuity would be added to each bill. No problem. The first waitress was very nice and really knew her beer. The brew master had even created an orange tinted beer called none other than, ""Da Beer"" for the special day. Awesome. Yeah... until we realized the TV was set in standard definition mode and they couldn't figure out how to run it or the heater to the building.  After some messing around with the heat, I asked if they would switch the TV to the high def channel, but they refused. Because they only had one sound system throughout the bar, we would be getting the SD channel's sound while we watched the HD channel.

Way too much too eat on top of a meal, but worth the gluttonous feeling it leaves in my belly. One of my favorite things about this Goose Island location are the Brewery tours and Beer Academy.  I have been on the brewery tour four times and have done the beer academy once.  The Brewery tour is every Sunday at 3 and 4:30 I think, and for $5 you can learn about how beer is made, a beer glass to take home,  and then get enough beer to drink to walk out quite wobbly.  Plus the fact the guy who teaches the class is very funny.

TVs all around to make sure your ESPN I.V. doesn't fall out. It's a tad overpriced, but it is a local brewery, and the beer is sure as hell a lot better than MGD/PBR type stuff, so just shell out and shut up. There are a couple pool tables upstairs, a nice bar, and more intimate booths for dinners there. You can get a sampler of small cups of all the brews they have too, which is nice if you are a beer connoisseur. In fact, I will sum up the place this way - if you enjoy trying different beers and exploring different microbrews, this place is totally worth going to. If you are not there to appreciate the beer, the place is pretty much like another Applebee's or TGIFridays. K?",0.9756,0.735,0.207,0.058,0.604320987654321

My wife and I ventured last week, and I got the ""Legendary Stilton Burger"" with the ""famous Pub Chips"". My wife got ""Chicago's Best Fish N' Chips"" along with Honker's Ale. As for the latter, I don't know if it was the area's best, but she enjoyed it. The Stilton, which is a black crusted burger with roasted garlic cloves and served on pumpernickel, was very good. Easily the best burger that I have had so far in Chicago (though I have only lived here for less than a month). Those ""famous"" chips were alright but a bit too sweet for my taste.

My group and I decided not to deal with him anymore and got a table with a waitress to watch some games and order food.  Well apparently she got the memo that I wasn't liked because her service was horrible too.  I've been here before and I've never felt like this, and I've never been treated like this before anywhere else.  I won't be going back, and if you look at my other reviews, I don't write bad reviews.  This place was messed up.",-0.0971,0.838,0.078,0.084,0.5416666666666666
2006-08-07,3.0,"Well. You know. Goose Island has amazing microbrews, which is a rare find in the land MGD. Not only this, but they have amazing and AWARD WINNING microbrews. I recommend the Saison and the Rye PA, if you like medium to dark brown ales. The fact that this place has an amazing and (sort of) free juke box just makes it all the better. Add to that a notable dinner menu, and score -- you've got me coming back for me.  The thing about the juke box is that last time I was there, it was off. The bartender said there was a problem with it or something, and they were playing his ipod. Whatever. He had good taste in music (imho), so it didn't matter -- but if you're there when it's fixed, get this: if you select from their completely sweet collection of CDs, the jukebox is free. if you wanna go on the internet and find your favouritest song ever ever ever, then you gotta pay. But i'm just fine with Bowie, the Beatles, Roxy Music and the Clash... so it's free. Hello.  So, there's the beer, and there's much to choose from. I've already recommended a few so I'll move on to dinner. The salads are large, enough for two really, and the entrees are DEFINITELY large enough two -- gf and I split the buffalo meatloaf. It was delectable -- rich and moist and very meaty and still lean. The brocolli was perfectly al dente and the mashed potatoes were awesome. I'll definitely try another entree sometime soon. However, we did manage to order cheesecake on a whim -- it's not worth it. It was good, but not 7 dollars for a tiny, tiny piece good.

I had a Summertime Ale which was great but the Matilda(special brew that they only do for a short time) was outstanding! I normally drink the India Pale Ale when out at other places. They also have flights which give you a taste of  four different brews. If you normally like your beer cold, you may be a little taken aback by the warmer temperature that they serve the beer at to enhance the flavor. The food is really good too--I had the mussels which they serve in a very hearty stew.  Plenty of parking in the lot that they share with Bed, Bath & Fucking Beyond.

When you finally are seated, the waitress makes an appearance to collect your order, may or may not deliver your food, and then disappears for the rest of the evening. Because it's a restaurant as well as a bar, you get the families with shrieking toddlers AND drunken brawlers.

They weren't overly busy for a Saturday night other than the bar area, but our server was really bad about walking up to the table, taking the late arrivee's order, but then not checking to see if anybody else needed anything. There was no music, aside from the TV that we could hear from the bar area, so the noise level was not too bad.
