I lucked out there. As I walked across Ashland avenue to Las Pasaditas restaurant, I spied the 'hole in the wall' store front appearance. My past experiences with 'hole in the wall ' Mexican food establishments has been mostly favorable. I ordered the medium guacamole and side of chips  (note to self and to anyone reading my foodie review) their medium is equivalent to other restaurants side order +. However, it was delicious if not a bit on the $$ side for its tiny size. I also ordered 1 chili relleno taco and 1 carne asada taco. I asked for the tomato, lettuce, onion and cilantro. They forgot the cilantro (I did not complain as the cook was wielding a knife and appeared to know how to use it) therefore, i ate the tacos as presented. Actually, I devoured them due to being hungry, angry customers who looked mostly like street elements and freshly released or soon-to-be convicts. One woman was complaining in half English half Hispanic (while her BF withered in shame over her emotional demonstration) about how a true Mexican restaurant would never, no not ever be short on beans especially on a Sunday.  She changed her mind and took her and her BF' s order to go as she too was Theatre bound. Yes! I agreed between carnivorous bites that no beans to go with the rice was disappointing whether it was Sunday or not hence, my giving the restaurant -1 star less in my rating. Scanning my watch. I handed in my tray and thanked the cook for great food and fled to the Theatre with time to spare and safety in numbers as the show was sold out. Yes!

2016-06-06,4.0,"The perfect late night food after an impromptu bar crawl of my own making. Most people opt for the sit down restaurant next door, but for a bit of the old in-out, in-out, stop into the express location off Ashland. The service is quicker albeit at the expense of a smaller menu; strictly tacos and burritos and sans rice and beans. The meats are as follows: carne asada, pollo, barbacoa, and lengua (tongue). Though the experience will be rendered invalid should you order anything besides the carne asada tacos with cilantro and cebolla. Paz was clutching the cash register to stay upright and almost ordered 3 lengua tacos before I stopped her and corrected the order for her. We were in desperate need of grease and meat after making a night of hopping bar to bar. She only agreed to go to the first one after some minor groveling on my part, assuring her we were meeting up with The Bae, except when she wasn't at Schubas I said she was actually at Flat Iron, and then Bangers & Lace, and then EvilOlive, the whole time I'm buying us round after round, her refusing and then gulping the cosmo as I tip it to her lips. La Pasadita's carne asada maintains a char grilled flavor after the skirt steak exterior has reached an acceptable crust, then chopped and cooked further, which separates the meat into pulled strips normally seen through slow cooking methods, and what doesn't immediately go into a tortilla to be served is placed in a warming bin, where the carne is allowed to soak in its own juices, a bonus for anyone ordering the carne asada burrito as it catches the liquid, reabsorbing it into the meat. It's tempting but I go with four tacos instead, making sure to ask for one tortilla on each instead of two. The carne's so tender and juicy that this means the tortilla will grow soggy and fall apart if I'm not careful, but I don't mind a little messiness (nudge, nudge. Eww). Either way Paz doesn't get the joke, who's sitting in a booth but still managing to sway, her eyes half open, the overhead lights catching in the saliva that rolls off her bottom lip, glimmering. I have to literally unwrap the taco for her and put it in her hand (""Put something,"" she mumbles, taco in hand, ""in my drink,"" before I legit push the taco in her mouth.) For drink options, I advise you to skip the Mexican Coke (a recent article proved there is no real difference between Mexican Coke and our domestic version. It's all in your head) and order the large horchata (rice water), a cinnamony concoction that's yummy and is served in a Styrofoam cup big enough for two, except Paz passes out so I have no finish it on my own (Le sigh).

It is shocking because many mexicans like to eat a nice MEATY taco and this place should know NOT TO SKIMP BUT like many other mexican taco spots in Chicago, that know how to make a well salted skirt steak taco, they price high but pack low. This trend in Chicago needs to end or new comers need to come and set a better standard. Places love to get customers but hate to pack tacos. No one with an appetite should have to pay almost $3.00 a taco and not fulfill their hunger. This is where the good supermarket tacos win and could soon trend above many ""backsliding"" taco joints.   Keep in mind,  it is really not hard to buy a pack of arranchera (skirt steak) for under $10, salt, and give a quick sear, and chop. With that in mind,  taco joints should really try to regard that some people do buy tacos to avoid the work but not because they are ignorant of how to make a similar taco... Therfore,  give a proper taco, not a children's size taco.  Now,  as for the lengua tacos they were fair in portions but needed a bit more chopping (slightly more). Overall, the steak and lengua meat had a great salted & charred taste, the salsa was good, the place could use upgrades, and the portions should reflect the price. Hope they make a change because they've been around for a while but many new comers are eager to step into the arena and set a new standard...

Maybe one day I'll try the chicken tacos and a burrito.  Food is always cooked to order in front of you. So it's always hot and fresh which is a definite score 4 me. Service is always quick. I will advise that the tacos aren't cheap. They're  $3.00 a pc, but worth every single penny! Steak Burritos are $10. I usually eat 2 and I'm full. They're a decent size.

Not the best eating area, but it serves it's purpose, same with the bathrooms. It's a weird area, still up and coming, but def still got your hipsters lurking and ordering burritos!

2015-02-11,3.0,"La Pasadita is Spanish for ""nexus of the universe,"" since this corner of Ashland and Division has so many Pasaditas it would make Lewis Black's head spin. I think I'm reviewing the right one, which is the one just north of the other one. La Pasadita is German for ""chewy meat product,"" which is a minus in an otherwise tasty carne asada burrito. Its beef is well-marinated and tasty, but get a tough chargrilled piece, and you'll be gnawing on that bad boy for ages. La Pasadita is Chinese for ""meat stuffing,"" because its burritos come with enough meat to stuff a socking and not much else. There's cilantro and onion, with a spicy salsa verde on the side. That makes it a burrito in the sense that it uses a large tortilla, but you could call it an oversized taco and that would be more appropriate. La Pasadita is French for ""mucho dinero,"" which is what it costs to make this a burrito proper. You can add guacamole, sour cream, cheese, and tomatoes, but that'll cost you an extra $2.50 for a sparse spoonful of the good stuff, on top of an already expensive burrito. This location also serves rice and beans on the side, but I don't think you can add it directly to the burrito to make it a ""super burrito."" According the the cashier, that can be done at the La Pasadita directly south of this La Pasadita. La Pasadita is English for ""pretty good,"" which is what their burrito is.

The chile relleno taco is pretty awesome as well and about the best bet on the menu if you're vegetarian or just want the most food for your money.  Free chips and salsa while you wait is definitely a plus and they let you BYOB if for some odd reason you're hear before the bars let out.

Ordered a carne asada burrito earlier today, $8. Sounds reasonable. An extra $1 for guacamole. Again, totally reasonable. Would I like cilantro and onion on that? Asked the young gentleman at the counter. Yes I would. As my wife ordered her pollo asada burrito and had to pay extra for cheese, something that's rarely an extra charge in burrito experience, I noticed on the menu board most things that come standard in a burrito cost extra here. While processing this, my wife asked for a cup for water. No water. Not even bottles to purchase. Really? That's fucking weird, but okay. We sit down, and realize we didn't get chips, so I go back up and ask. No dice, there are no chips. What the fuck? Isn't this a taqueria? Now that's super weird, but whatever, we're hopeful. The burritos come, and what the fuck? Where's the rice, beans, and fucking pico de gallo salsa? We're fairly new to Chicago, and I don't really now how you guys do here, but back in California $8 gets you a minimum of rice, beans, cheese, salsa, onions, cilantro and choice of meat. Chips and salsa are $2 more at the most, and guacamole and sour cream will run you an extra $.50-$1.50 depending on that restaurant. Now I've had plenty of great tacos so far here in Chicago, but I don't know if I can handle your standard of burrito if this is what I have to look forward to.

I remember coming here with my father as a child through-out the years and such; everything was great:  amount of meat on my tacos(now mediocre), customer service and bathroom(which are disgusting). La Pasadita failed on all these, and it's truly a shame.  Allow me to begin on the authenticity, which is there, however not at all worth $2.50 for steak taco and $3.00 for a lengua taco, and $4.50 on small tortas.  NOT AT ALL WORTH IT that price, when they add such mediocre amount of meat, cheese and beans to my tortas! The meat on the tacos is as well pinched.   Their prices have risen in the past years, which I guess is what they think is reasonable, due to their location and the demographics that keep changing.  However, if you're going to raise your prices still offer me the same amount of meat to my tacos and tortas! Frustration doesn't end just there.  Their customer service makes it worse.  I had to remind our waitress 2 times, for both my limes and horchata (rice water); I guess flirting for over 5 minutes, with a man that was about to pay was more of a priority.  And of course, after she was done smiling and giggling she managed to forget my limes and horchata.  Come on lady, get it together.  Just when I knew I wasn't going to eat lunch here anymore; a quick trip to the bathroom finalized me ever wanting to come back.  Their ladies bathroom was filthy.  There was toilet paper all over the floor and no bathroom soap.  A restaurant, in fact any business should ALWAYS be aware of their bathrooms.  Bathrooms tell a lot about a business and this just topped it off.   I won't be coming here any longer.  Nothing is impressing, their carna asada is grilled ok, fine, but that's all.   They keep raising their prices and yet still believe reducing the amount of content is OK, as if there bolillo(Mexican torta bread) wasn't small enough! PS-If what you're looking for good authentic Mexican food, you don't have to trouble far, ""La Traspasada"", is on Ashland and Chicago.  Here they serve real tacos, burritos and tortas packed with meat!  It's small but they don't lack flavor, authenticity, and amount.   I myself will only go here from now on.",0.9912,0.798,0.143,0.059,0.4660749506903352

I want a margarita with my food, dammit!  However, they are BYO so off to the liquor store we go.   #2:  The inside is dingy. I understand they originated in 1976 and apparently that means updates are not necessary. #3:  One of my favorite parts of eating at a Mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa. 2 BIG thumbs down for La Pasadita. The chips were too hard and the salsa is served in plastic squeeze bottles. Can you put it in a bowl for easy dipping? Can you make it fresh? #4:  I ordered the carne asada dinner. The meat came out sliced in tiny pieces and served with cooked onions. Um...isn't this fajitas? Typically, carne asada means ONE piece of meat. #5: Service is blah.  I had to remind the server 3 x for an extra cup for my beer.

She didn't really elaborate beyond that but we all know how much the latinos love to be close to their familia so it sort of made sense to me.  Yeah, that's not exactly a mystery solved but I feel somewhat more enlightened now, don't you? I digress.  So the question is, does it make a difference which location I go to?

The first burrito I have eaten in America with no filler just over a pound of meat wrapped in a tortilla with some fresh diced onion and cilantro for flavor.  The decor isn't for the faint of heart in the old yellow building with about 10 bar stools in the whole place and traditional Mexican music blaring from the speakers. The building is old and decrepit, but the character it has is what makes this place great. The menu features about 5 types of meat either served as a taco or burrito and always popular Mexican beverage, horchata, rice milk with cinnamon and sugar.  I ate a combo burrito of Carne Asada and Lengua(tongue). The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The burrito is wrapped in foil and served with a squeeze bottle full of homemade green tomatillo salsa, which has a hint of spice. The horchata comes from a large freezer chest where it is ladled out of a large container into a styrofoam cup. The horchata is perfectly sweet with a hit of cinnamon and horchata slush covers the bottom of the cup.  Locals adorned the place and chattered over the music. We (my gringo friend and I)  drew stares as we walked in. After the initial culture shock, the staff was friendly and the regulars quick to make recommendations.  La Pasadita shows it's weathered facade inside and out, but after eating some authentic Mexican food from this joint, you will understand how eating in this hole in the wall only makes you feel cozy and comfortable as you uncomfortably try to finish the huge burrito.

After reading this, I figured out that the restaurant I went to was El Largo, the long one, and I must say it was kind of a disappointment. I'm not looking for frills when it comes to my taco fix.

2010-06-27,5.0,"La Pasadita is one of the great authentic taquerias in the city of Chicago. The value is pretty exceptional, which is to say the prices are reasonable, and also that what you get in return is of fine quality.  The menu is as simple as it gets, which will no doubt turn off people used to shopping a tome-like menu to find their favorite dish. But what these people do, they do spectacularly, which is always superior to an extensive menu in my opinion.  You can have your tacos prepared with the traditional cilantro and onion accompaniment, or you can get lettuce and tomato if you're into that sort of thing.  The steak is charbroiled for excellent flavor and texture. The barbacoa is steamed and heaping with chunks of seasoned beef. Whatever you choose, it'll be worth the low price of admission in flavor and size. Everything on the menu is big, and lethal because they're all stuffed with generous portions of meat.  The staff is typical of the best Mexican spots anywhere: they're polite, lightning-fast, and perpetually busting their asses every shift (so don't be afraid to drop a buck or two in that tip jar).

I added some sour cream and then decided that I wanted to try la lengua (tongue for those who don't speak espanol) taco. They were out of guac when I was there, which I was fine with.

I would definitely get it again, especially since I truly do believe in using as much of the animal as possible. The burrito was delicious as well! Tender steak, not at all gristly.

You've got La Pasadita I (my numbers, not theirs for the record) next door which is a fully stocked sit down restaurant.  La Pasadita II, a cosy little taco shack, sits across the street.  Then you've got this one - ""the trey"" - the runt of the litter.  This LP (I verified the address to be sure) is a simple taqueria serving only five kinds of tacos and five kinds of burritos for the late night drunken munchers of Ukrainian Village. There is nothing wrong, of course, with simplicity.  I love a good quick serve taco cart (that's what she said).  The problem with ""trey"" (we're on a nickname basis) is that the burritos and tacos on the menu are not the simple sort you can just roll up and slap on the grill.  I waited quite a while for my chile relleno tacos (I can only imagine how long the wait would have seemed if I had gone drunk instead of sober) as the line in the restaurant started to grow. Had it been worth the wait, I would give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  But the two tacos I got - besides the dry breaded chilis - had cilantro and onions but nothing that would actually add to the flavor or consistency of the total package.  Plus they were pricey little buggers at $3.50 a pop!  Not bad, but not $3.50 times two good! I sat in the booth below a sign that said these were named the best taco in Chicago by Check, Please.  This must have been won by another location (obviously with the same name) because these were not close. Is it better than Flash Taco one blue line stop further as a quick stop?  Yes.  But that's not saying much.  What isn't?  It was good enough to make me wonder about the other two La Pasaditas, but I will not be rushing back to this Taste of Chicago version!  There are two seemingly better choices (with the same name) right there, after all!",0.9801,0.844,0.102,0.054,0.4489612511671336

Granted, La Pasadita still pales in comparison to what terrific taco promised land should be. The chips were stale and desperately aching for a salt bath, the two salsas offered (green and black) came in squeeze bottles and were pretty far from impressive. My super tacos were good but not much of a departure from a late night Burrito House mess deconstructed on lukewarm corn tortillas.

Of course, I grew up on the East Coast and spent a lot of time in New England, so walking into a Mexican joint and ordering a great taco is something I've never experienced before visiting Chicago/California.   My best bad Mexican food story - we were driving through the snow in backwoods New Hampshire one beautiful January night.  We pass by a diner/hair salon, and the sign claimed to have Mexican food.  We had to try it!   So this guy named Rich opened the door; the restaurant and men's barber shop were separated by a glass window.  In the shop there was a red hound barking loudly but without much fervor; it stopped barking when I stared at it.  Rich was apparently the sole proprietor there - he took your order, he cooked and served the food, and he shaved your beard and cut your hair.   He was really friendly, too - a lot of people in New Hampshire hate New Yorkers, who stand out like a sore thumb, but he asked us all these questions and was really interested in getting to know us. Of course, nothing on the menu was Mexican - broiled fish, T bone steak, baked chicken breast, etc.  Confusing.  But there was one Mexican dish: guacamole.  $9, the same price as the most expensive item on the menu.  But the best part was that the menu said there would be a table side presentation.  We asked Rich about it, and he showed us this huge stone bowl.  So we ordered it. A few minutes later, he came out with a plate of tortilla chips.  Then he grabbed the bowl, and as we watched, poured in some avocado flavored green powder and sour cream, and then served it to us on our side plates. Fan fucking tastic.  The fish was pretty good though. Back to La Pasadita, though.  The people here are annoying as hell, but the food is soooo good.  I've had problems both times I've come here with the service.  The first time, I ordered two chicken tacos, which are $1.55 each, and a side of sour cream, which the menu said was 50 cents.  The tacos were great, and they gave me a huge side of sour cream.  When I went to pay, I was told the sour cream was 3.50.  I pointed to the menu, where it said 50 cents, but they told me it was 50 cents for the small side and they had given me a large side.  I told them I didn't ask for a large side, but they told me that since I ate out of it, I had to pay the 3.50.  Kind of stupid since my two tacos cost 3.10. I promised myself I wouldn't go back, but I did today.  I made sure I asked for a small side of sour cream.  Twice.  The food was great, but the claimed to have no sauce that was spicier than the green and black sauce that was on the table.  I know this is not true, since they gave me a special spicy salsa verde the first time I went.  That annoyed me.  I also noticed that everyone in the restaurant got their food on a plate and were given a fork and knife.  I was given none of those; they were wrapped up like they were to go and brought to my table.  They knew it wasn't to go, though.  I asked for a plate, fork, and knife, and only got a plate and a fork. But the stuffed chilis are sooo good.  The tacos have tons of cilantro, and you get a whole bowl of tomatos and chips with everything you order.  I can probably find good food elswhere, but it's hard when you know there's a place that always has it.  Unfortunately, I'll probably be back.",0.9923,0.786,0.134,0.08,0.49652160704792275

Found the steak meat to be tough/chewey and not particularly tasty or well-seasoned. Tacos were also very greasy, and too little 'filling' of onions and cilantro. Also, we paid the extra 50cents for gaucamole, and there was barely a quarter-teaspoon if that on any of the Tacos. And, dissappointed there was no option to add real Avocado (which is my preference). The usual free Tortilla Chips were also not very well-made or tasty, and the 3 sauces to go with only so-so. The only positive note I'd make is that it is BYOB, so you can definately eat (& drink) on the cheap. But, for my money (and tastebuds), TACALITLAN beats this place hands down.

Parking on the street wasn't a problem though the place was nearly full by 5 p.m. on Saturday.  It's a small place, and a group of four had to split up since the larger booths were taken.  Given the crowd, this might be a great place for some.  However, I prefer La Condesa a block away on the northeast corner of Augusta and Ashland.  It costs a little more, but the flavors are really wonderful.",0.9603,0.854,0.108,0.038,0.5830584415584416
