2017-07-30,5.0,"Will's was my home away from home when I lived in Chicago. From the moment I first walked in, I knew I would be frequenting this place often. If you're a Packer fan, of course this is the must visit spot for the Sunday game. If you're not, no worries, the fans are friendly and the bartenders aren't picky about who orders drinks! Every night of the week they have some type of drink special. If it's your first time, note that during game days there's no table service, so you order from the bar and take a number to your table.  Over the years I've seen this bar change for the better. The staff is always friendly and welcoming, and they have done amazing things to their outdoor patio, which for the winter months becomes covered with a tent and heaters! Jimmy, Rob and Gus are three of the best bartenders around, and they are always there to greet you with a smile and a cold beer, or a bloody mary if necessary.  Fun fact, I love this bar so much I actually moved around the corner from it for a while. Now that I'm far away in Denver, I wish I could still frequent this place for a Sunday Funday or after-work pick-me-up... but alas, I still am trying to find a bar in Denver that can make me feel as home to Wisconsin as this wonderful bar has done for me! Long story short, drop in for an old fashioned, a Leinenkugel or whatever beer you'd like (they have plenty draft & bottle selections.

There were many sections of the bar to hang out:  the patio, the tent, the bar itself.  It was a pretty cool atmosphere.  We sat on the patio and stayed warm next to the metal fire pit.  Loved the grilling and free halftime raffle:  cheese curds $8, burgers and hot dogs for $3, onion rings, and the raffle was generous with Will's Northwoods Inn and Badger paraphernalia give-aways. I would say 80% of the crowd is in their 20's. It's a college crowd.  It felt very safe.  Nobody was in a drunken stupor or inappropriate.  There are plenty of TV's and speakers; in fact one could say it was almost too loud and echoey. Areas for improvement: 1. Dry vs wet wood for the fire pits.  Got smoked out.  Maybe gas heaters? 2. Protect the wooden benches from rain so on game day they're not wet and dirty.  Nobody wanted to sit on them. 3.  More chairs and bar stools.  3.5-4 hrs of standing.  Ugh. 4.  Muddy grilling and raffle area.  Grass protection mats would've been perfect.

From booking the party to closing down the bar on Saturday night, the entire process was fantastic. Kevin and Rob were both so helpful with planning the event and catered to whatever we needed. The day of the party, every single staff member was so polite and did a great job helping us set up for the party. Literally every person (Bartenders, bouncers, bar backs, etc.) shook my hand and introduced themselves. Dan, our bartender for the night was great too; friendly, accommodating, and handled our rowdy crowd like a pro. The customer service at this place was above and beyond (it's probably because they hire so many nice folks from Wisconsin) and I recommend Will's to anyone that looking to host a party!",0.993,0.686,0.281,0.033,0.48485958485958486

French fries - Great. Chicken sandwich- Not...great...pretty bad. Probably just an off day...? Today i decided to go in and try the southern food they have. A Wisconsin bar in Chicago, wasn't expecting TOO much. Chicken gumbo - Surprisingly actually really good. I prefer seafood gumbo but not being in NOLA or actually in the gulf, chicken is a good idea. The flavors were great, not TOO spicy but a nice bite, tasted authentic enough! My only complaint is there's too much STUFF in it, peppers, onions, celery, large chunks. If they made it the same but smaller dices, and less stuff, it'd be amazing! Served with the rice on top too. I was pleasantly surprised with it's flavor and authenticity. Fried pickle spears - I've had better. They were still pretty great (how can you go wrong?) But the pickles were a little shriveled and there was too much breading. Still good. Next up, must try the poutine!!! The service has always been decent-good. No complaints!  Came in with my dog and they didn't allow dogs inside (understandable) but did on the patio. Despite it being January, they served me out there (it was 52 degrees though!) And were nice.

You can get a big old cup of beer for $7 and $5 for refills with the same cup. The 2nd time I was here was this past weekend for the Bears and Packers game. The bf and I were running late and we got there right when the game started. I took a risk and wore my bears shirt. I gotta tell ya I was kind of scared. Most people were nice, but of course there were some drunk ignorant people. It also felt good to know that there were other fans in the building.

It also happens to be dangerously close to my apartment, and one of my favorite places to drink away a summer afternoon. The place is packed during any Wisconsin game, but still manages to be reliably friendly and fun. If you're a semi-recent UW grad, you're guaranteed to run into at least 3 familiar faces from the streets of Madison. Thought you'd never see that Friday-night 'Brats dance partner again? Joke's on you. If they live in Chicago, they're here. This leads to lots of happy, hilarious, and only sometimes awkward, reunions.  An aquarium of lake fish, hunting trophies, wood paneling and northern memorabilia lend to the northwoods theme. It could easily be mistaken for the basement of any of my Wisconsin family members (though they only dream of having several delicious beers on tap).  Will's is also a great stop when it's not in a WI sports frenzy. Free darts and popcorn, a Euchre league and excellent beer specials make a perfect casual hangout. The expansive and comfortable beer garden has TVs, which staff will change to any channel you request. PLUS Will's has the best cheese curds I've found in northern Illinois, besting Culver's. If you go during a Wisconsin game, keep your cup! The first beer is $7, with refills at $5. I've been drinking out of the same Will's cup for a year and a half and saving a few dollars every time.

There is some bartender that works there who was all kinds of rude to us for no reason.

The worst part was halfway through our meal she stormed over and told us we had to ""close our tab"" because she was leaving. Fine. As we settled up mid-meal, though, she lingered over our table as we're tipping her which was uncomfortable and pretty much a no-no you learn the first day in Waitressing 101. On top of that, she didn't even leave and instead ruined our meal with her incessant yelling and over-the-top weird jokes.

Also - they have a raffle at half time.  The announcer is so annoying, and loud, and it takes forever for people to bring their # up since the place is so crowded.  I don't know how it's possible, but they were definitely calling numbers roughly 1-1000... and if that means there were 1000 people at Will's I almost believe it. Like I said, it has a fun theme, and a couple hours before the game it's great.  I'd 100% rather be watching it in my living room though, which is a pretty harsh statement coming from me, since I hate sports and bars/drinking is really the only thing that usually salvages it for me.

The decor of the bar is Northwoods Wisconsin hunters paradise.  You'll see a lot of taxidermy on the walls including a couple of Moose, a bobcat, and their primary fish, the Musky.  There is also a lot of memorabilia from Badger and Packer teams and players in the past. They have a bunch of special events throughout the year.  There's always a chili cook-off on Superbowl Sunday which I haven't won... yet. They host a weekly euchre night on Wednesdays which gets a lot of action.  At the end of the Summer they have a block party called ""Musky Fest"" where they crown a ""Musky Queen"" and have lots of live bands.  It's a free and fun event.",0.9957,0.809,0.177,0.014,0.442936507936508

But the staff are all really good people, and they work their asses off to make the bad things right. But...there's just way too many problems. To be fair, I don't give a damn about Wisconsin any more than any other state. Maybe a homesick Packer-Backer would overlook a lot for the sense of familiarity. People obviously love this bar. The first visit was a lazy Sunday afternoon, and the less said, the better. The manager did a great job of hearing out our complaints...none were present on our second visit. We thought a Friday night with the playoffs on might be more this bar's speed. The crowd was great -- a bit older and more subdued than our favorite sports spots. The servers were sweet (and surprisingly gorgeous), but completely overwhelmed. My wife got someone else's dinner, they kept forgetting the soda for the non-drinkers, and our cocktails got smaller and weaker as the night went on. We chose to leave early to finish the game elsewhere. The Badger burger was pretty good, but it wasn't enough. It seems like if you catch this place at the right time, it could be great. But, we've visited when it was empty, we've been back when it was busy (but not really slammed)...I'm not sure we're going to keep experimenting.

They even let us put on the Ohio State vs. USC game last year for my birthday and the place is a freaking Wisconsin bar! 2. It costs nothing to reserve the party room. NOTHING. We learned last year that finding a place with a private room that doesn't require a minimum or a charge for the room is darn near next to impossible. 3. Although they now have a food menu (woowee!), you are allowed to bring in your own food. Thus making it easy for me to bring 2 dozen cupcakes from Molly's bakery, and others to bring crock pots of sloppy joes. 4.

2010-02-13,3.0,"I've been through Lincoln Park Zoo and Wrigleyville millions of times and have gone up and down through crazy town watching legitimate idiocy here there and around the block five times. A few weeks ago I went through Yelp to compile a list of darts with corkboards that I have not yet visited and Will's Northwoods Inn was on TOP of the list. Great reviews, detailed web site with excellent pictures, a Packers bar? So what? Football season is over! After hitting up the all-you-can at Durkin's, I convinced six friends to follow me out to Will's Northwoods Inn and we got to the back area to play darts. Unfortunately the tables had reserved signs everywhere even though no one was there. We began to shoot darts and the bar darts were actually sharp. The corkboards were in good to excellent condition with the center board being the best. The scoreboard was the smooth plexiglass with white pencil and damp towel - great! The came in the birthday party, a manager let us know that they reserved the table and that we would have to move, the birthday girl was nice enough to let us stay so it was not a problem. We continued to play darts and I enjoyed the decor from the giant ass moosehead mounted up on a far off wall and the giant overhead collection of antlers that hung over the darts. There is a feeling that you're in a cabin when you're at Will's Northwoods and it's rather comfortable. Despite their comforting trappings, the people that reserved the party prove to me why the next generation of people coming out of college will be designated: The Dumbest Generation. One girl was telling the other girl, ""Get the %#$!$ out of my face! I %@%!%! hate you!"" A very unattractive one kept trying to hit on my friend and would not leave us alone!!! After I asked what she thought of that fact he had a girlfriend she snapped back at me, ""I don't see any ring, what the $R!$@! do I care?!"" Arrogant, bunk, and full of self-entitlement, I was ready to run her through with a dart right then and there! Then as we threw darts the Lakeview DePaul trash did not give us an inch to throw. Very bad dart etiquette as we had no space to play and people found it inconceivable that we brought out own darts and kept asking us to use our darts that we brought to the bar even though there was a set of bar darts (that were sharp mind you) I just wanted to scream!!!!!! I went to the back bar to get a glass of water to calm down. Nope, surrounded by idiots from the party and no bartender in sight after five minutes. GREAT! Fury just reached a new level and I couldn't stand it anymore!!!! I was trapped in a sea of college kids and had no way out! Bars are a business and people can choose to run their business any which way they like. You can't control who walks into the bar or how they behave. I spend more time than I should in bars and my favorite bars are where the owner will come out, chit chat with people about anything and everything. These are the bars I come into time and time again across winter, spring, summer, autumn, and back again because I know the people that run it are great people and friendly as hell and I am willing to tolerate the bs because of it. After finishing up a match of darts I moved me + 6 over to yet another dart bar. Playing darts is my favorite hobby, but I will have to try to come back when it is less crowded!",0.972,0.843,0.104,0.053,0.5591609779109779
2010-02-09,4.0,"This a late post as I am new to yelping. I was in Chicago at Will's back in April of 09' after a Cubs game and dinner at Gino's. 1st off I am a huge fan of neighborhood bars like this. This place made me feel right at home even being that I live now in Orlando, Fl. Plus I was with some friends who had never been to Chicago before so taking them to a place that was LOCAL like this, was perfect. Not to mention a great story. As we got there it was still kinda early and I think a bachelor party was going on.  There were 8 of us sitting at the bar right inside the door. Well one or both gentlemen (a loosely used term here for people not in our group) next to us had very obnoxious gas. So I got up and moved over near the counter where you walk up by the door for some fresh air. So there I sat in my Cubs jersey, Green Irish Cubs hat, plaid shorts, flip flops, minding my own business enjoying a drink , when a series of people walk in and hand me their drivers license. So of course I look at it and hand it back (my improv training working out). One of the couples from Orlando with us are police officers and they thought that it was funny because I always say how I feel at home in Chicago and needless to say without anything being said people start handing me their license when they walk in the door. So this goes on for about an hour when my buddies wife (one of the police officers) walks over and asks if I am even looking at the date. I say no I am not a cop or a doorman but yes. So for about 1.5 hours I look at everyone who walks in driver license without once asking to see it. So my point is, This could only happen in a neighborhood bar that welcomes everybody and makes you feel at home, Whether your from Chicago, Wisconsin, Minnesota or Florida you'll be right at home in Will's",0.9713,0.889,0.096,0.015,0.4954199646507339

I went to Vince Lombardi Middle School and my mom now lives up in the real northwoods of Wisconsin (almost the U.P.). So I think I'm qualified to judge a place's Wisconsinness. Will's is as Wisconsin as you can get without making a trek north of the border. Lots of wood, dead animals. Packers stuff, UW stuff. One of those cloth towel thingies in the bathroom that no one likes. The only way you can tell you're in Chicago is 1. you can breathe (you can still smoke in bars in Wisconsin...yuck) and 2. the prices. But I don't think they could even pay their rent if they charged real northwoods prices here! This is the place to go in Chicago to watch a Packer game, if you can take the crowds. It does get packed! If you want a table, go several hours before kick-off. However, despite the crowds you could still generally navigate around, get into the bathroom, and get drinks from the bar (if you're willing to lean over some strangers). With the exception of one tool (who probably should be medicated) and his friends (see Bailey H's review) everyone was pretty nice. This is a bar, not a bar and grill and they do not sell food. During Packer games they grill out brats and burgers and hot dogs, but you have to wait out in the cold to get them and there can be lines...but there is a big flat screen TV outside so you can continue to follow the game. Also, from what I saw the burgers came off on the rare side, so if you like a well-done burger I wouldn't eat these. But hey, it's free! Just be aware this isn't a restaurant. I can safely say now that I've discovered this little piece of ""back home"" right here in Chicago, I'll be visiting again.

Inside the bar, they have a separation in the middle so really it like two separate rooms. Expect to get your drink in a plastic cup, and definitely take advantage of the popcorn machine!....This place gets really packed on the weekends but its still really fun.  There is also an abundance of really gung ho sports guys but they are all supper cool and whenever I go here I end up making a  plethora of new friends, even if it is just for the night!",0.9949,0.756,0.244,0.0,0.35399449035812675
2007-09-05,3.0,I like this place. They have kid rock on the jukebox and there is free popcorn.  Always really nice people in here too. It feels like you are somewhere in Wisconsin. A good place to go when you are just looking for a place to relax and drink a couple of pitchers of beer.,0.945,0.719,0.281,0.0,0.8000000000000002
2007-06-29,4.0,"The only thing that would make this bar more Wisconsin-like would be charging Wisconsin prices for the beer.   Plenty of stuffed animals (including a badger) and old fishing notices, such as one of a 1963  walleye competition, are on shelves and the walls. Leinie's on tap, Simpson's on tv, no annoying un-invited conversation from other patrons, and a bartender with a cigarette permanently attached to his lips. Maybe there is only food here during game days, because they don't have a kitchen.  You can order pizza, though, or bring food in. This is the kind of bar you want to stop in on your way home from work for a pint or two.",-0.7003,0.925,0.012,0.064,0.6416666666666667

Bonus if you love Wisconsin. Tucked away in a residential street (Racine just south of Belmont). A nice garden area to sit and conversate amongst the humid air in the summer, complete with the largest freestanding moose sculpture/creation I've ever encountered.  Decent beer selection, dartboards, pool tables, TV's, friendly staff. The food is marginal, you are better off filling up before you come...(Gino's East is down the street, among others).   Parking is atrocious...though the west side of Racine is non-permit. (Every other street is permit after 6pm, and the meter people are hawks, don't attempt unless you like valeting your car for $50).  Go Badgers and Moose!

Recently, I stopped by Will's for a night of dart-watching (Lame, I know.  I don't play darts.  I didn't really watch darts either come to think of it.  I guess I just wanted to say that they have dart boards).   Darts woo-hoo!    My one complaint about Will's is the $20 credit card limit.  I call BS.  No way does that fly with me big Willy!",0.8635,0.741,0.161,0.098,0.525132275132275
