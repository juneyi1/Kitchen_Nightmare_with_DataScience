2017-08-31,5.0,"I feel like I am sharing a secret that I should not.  I had no idea there was a Filipino brunch place. I like any brunch place that is not the usual American fare. I think it got lost under my radar since I have not gone out for brunch in a while and they close at 3pm. The place runs like a diner. The staff was friendly and waitress welcomed us with complimentary bowls of Filipino style congee!! (This gesture already scores points with me!). It was topped with a lemon slice which was a nice touch that I have not tired before. The waitress kind and wanted to know if we tried Filipino brunch and if not, that was the place to start.  I had the tocino which is an awesome value ($10). It's sweet marinaded roasted pork shoulder. It was really good. The plates came with 2 eggs any style (score!), additive garlic rice (score!), and dessert cup of warm chocolate rice pudding (I think it had cinnamon)...score again!  The staff was nice and they checked on us to see if we liked the food. Can't wait to go back.  There was decent free street parking near by on Sunday.",0.9934,0.748,0.242,0.01,0.6148148148148149

2017-08-06,4.0,"Uncle Mike's is hidden gem that visitors wouldn't know about. I learned about this restaurant from a friend who lived in the area and we had made plans to meet here for breakfast. It is about a 20 minute Uber ride from the Mag Mile area.  From the moment I walked in it felt like a quaint mom and pop hole in the wall restaurant. I went on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was alive and vibrant with lots of chatter, waitresses bringing out food, and welcoming guests. Entrance space is tight and there is no formal hostess stand. You wait at either entrance until a waiter can seat you. The wait was short, about 5-10 minutes for a table of 3.  Before you even order you are welcomed with a warm bowl of congee. Lightly salted with a twist of lemon. A nice way to start off my meal.  I ordered and would recommend the Tocino breakfast which comes with garlic rice, eggs (any style), salsa, and a chocolate pudding dessert. Everything was great! I had a cup of coffee with breakfast and the small vintage cups make you feel like you're having breakfast at grandma's.  Service was quick and friendly.

If you decide to order Uncle Mike's Filipino dish definitely try out the Longaniza (sweet chorizo style sausage- chargrilled with the grill marks, garlic rice, with two eggs any style you want it paired with some pico de gallo).

You can get items for under 5$ for a stack of two pancakes all the way to about $15 for a meal good for two, unless you've got a huge appetite. I shared a stack of regular pancakes with my mom. She also ordered a dish with fish to go with it. It was some kind of fried fish that came with two eggs, garlic fried rice, and some kind of sweet porridge to cleanse your palette. They give a complimentary rice dish in a bowl made with coconut milk, a lemon slice, green onions, and chicken broth. Really good for whetting your appetite! Probably why I was so full! I only ate one pancake, an egg, and a bit of fish and I was good. This place looks like your grandma's: funky tiles, random coffee mugs, and mismatched decor. The coffee tasted like crap though! Nothing special, just like Folger's or Taster's Choice rubbish. It really wasn't all that busy when we came at 8:30 on a Saturday morning, but the space is small.

2017-01-18,5.0,"After multiple bad experiences at eating at Filipino restaurants in the Chicago area, Uncle Mike's is the savior when it comes to Filipino restaurants. If you want Filipino food, look no further because Uncle Mike's is the best place for Filipino food! Parking: free street parking in the front Ambience: his restaurant is very welcoming and it feels like you're eating at home here. It's a small restaurant but plenty of seats if you come when it's not crowded. My parents came here to the U.S. from the Philippines and they said it reminded them of being home back in the Philippines, bringing up memories of their grandparents cooking traditional Filipino foods for them. The food is definitely authentic! Food: I love that they are open at 5:00AM so it's great if you're hungry knowing that you can go to Uncle Mike's for a hearty breakfast before work. It's better than eating cereal or McDonald's breakfast early in the morning! I usually order the longanisa (chorizo) or the tocino (pork shoulder). Portions are very generous and you're more likely to box your food unless you're starving haha. Each dish comes with garlic rice, lugao (rice porridge), and two eggs any style! I have also tried the skirt steak, which is huge, but I felt like it was a bit chewy and fatty, so I'll stay with my usual choices of longanisa or tocino. You get lots of food for a great value!  Service: Service was excellent! It reminded me of being at a Filipino party, where there is so much food and where relatives encourage you to eat more food even though you're full. I've been here on two separate occasions and I loved that Uncle Mike treated us like family. He made us spaghetti and even chicken curry which were not on the menu, on the house. He noticed that my dad ate all of his rice and asked the waiter to bring my dad another plate of garlic rice, for free. He even brought champorado (chocolate rice pudding) and my dad absolutely loved it, saying that his Lola (grandma) used to make it all the time for him until she passed. Usually, at other Filipino restaurants, we ask for certain items on the menu but they tell us that they don't have it because they ""ran out of it,"" which leads to disappointment. Or if we want more of a certain item, other Filipino restaurants will charge us extra or make their portions stingy and small for the sole reason of profit. Other Filipino restaurants leave us disappointed or hungry, which is disappointing when you crave Filipino food for the taste and memories. Uncle Mike's is an exception and you will leave this place happy and satisfied!

2016-12-22,5.0,"Folks, I have found my default brunch location!  Great service, delicious and generous portions.   Feel good here.    Filipino breakfast is my kind of breakfast.   For being a rice eater myself, I've not had garlic rice before, which is why it was such a pleasant surprise to have this flavor in my rice.  (I bought some more garlic @ the grocery store after eating at Mike's) I've heard about Uncle Mike's huge portions so I was very excited to be wowed.   I believe the combos are a tad bit smaller than the stand alone plates, but I'd rather have the variety - so the combos did the trick.   Written on a chalk board - diners get free ""soup"" and tea.   My surprise was that the soup was actually congee (a rice porridge made with chicken broth, chicken, green onion, and a slice of lemon).  I've never had congee with lemon before but it really accented the congee well. Nice pieces of dark meat chicken simmered for a long time demonstrated  to.me  the care and pride that Uncle Mike's take.  Congee is comfort food for me growing up - as we always had congee every morning.  Its a slow process and when done properly, and it just speaks of love.  The menu is expansive - I suppose you could still get omelettes and skillets and sandwiches like any diners, but why bother when the fillipino breakfast offers a more lasting impression? The key for me was to try as much as I could with this meal- so I opted for the combo meals.   I had to have tocino and longonisa - it was fab.  Gotta have it with runny egg yolk, adds a nice rich ""sauce"" for everything. It. Ame with a side of pico di Gallo (perfect because I could eat this with breakfast all the time), a side of taro rice pudding - which was yummy.  This dish reminds me of ""5-5-4"" (for those in the know BBQ pork w/ rice and a fried egg) only 10 times better! Other dish was the Skirt steak and Bangus (milkfish) which also came with a side of taro rice pudding.  I thought the star was gonna be the skirt steak - and yeah it was definitely good!  But I really liked the milk fish.   I ate it with fins, tail and head in all.   One of the staff came over and said he does exactly the same thing, only he likes the larger milk-fish (I guess I'll have to take that challenge next time!).   It was crunchy and just awesome to pick at - crunchy like a potato chip for the head and fins.   I dipped it into the vinegar based sauce (I really should have learned what this is called as I've seen it at other Fillipino restaurants before - any help on that Yelpers?).  The skirt steak was marinaded in what I'd call a sweet marinade kinda like terriyaki sauce but lighter.  I'd ask for this steak to be a bit charred and medium - as the carmelization added a good component to the taste.  I had this with a soft scramble which was done perfectly.  I like that it was served with a side of A1 sauce.  (I love A1 with eggs) and this acidity with the savory sweet of the skirt steak...Well you know...is pretty darn good man. The service experience was very friendly as we interacted with several of the staff.  They all checked in on us frequently, and kidded around with my kids.  They were a key part of our great experience.   The interior is more spacious than I thought it would be as there was as the space is rather long and narrow.  Mike's place utilized a bar-style seating to take advantage of the transition space between the front main dining room and the back dining room.  Decor in the back room is somewhat lacking, but the front room is splendidly decorated with beautiful accents and even Christmas lights, offers a cozy space for enjoying the company in conversation and the awesome food!   I already fwded my rec to my out of town family.  We gonna go here from now on!",0.9995,0.76,0.233,0.008,0.5804347826086957

The garlic fried rice was tasty and fluffy (albeit plain), but the fresh pico made up for it! My eggs were cooked perfectly over easy. Not much is better than runny egg yolk + rice! The tocino was good! I like that some pieces had a bit of char. The SPAM (you have the option of regular or spicy) was a great spice addition to the meal. There is also got sauce and Sriracha available. My +1 had the combo with milkfish and longaniza. I reaallllyy liked his sausage - next time I'd opt for that!  Oh, and the rice porridge with dried garlic, green onion, and lemon?! Money. Seriously. Service was friendly! We sat at the counter and were constantly checked on. Our waters and coffees were refilled and were offered boxes for leftovers.  My +1 sat next to Uncle Mike himself - nice guy with cool stories! - and scored us keychains, heh.

The chicken and rice soup is a nice way to start your meal, ask for seconds if its your fancy, its FREE.  For seating if there is room, sit in the main area near the cashier/entrance.

That was ok. Not my favorite. The tocino was really good. It was cooked just right and the right blend. It wasn't too sweet like most tocinos I've had. The egg was egg - nothing special.

2016-09-08,5.0,"This was my first visit to Uncle Mike's Place and I really could not find anything to reduce my rating from a full five stars. Having never been to a Filipino Restaurant I knew this would probably be a DIFFERENT dining experience, and I was not mistaken. Before I get to my review of my breakfast entree, we were served a Lemon Chicken Rice Soup with Ginger. Soup before breakfast at 10:30am was different! The soup was very tasty, but I still felt the need to add a dash of pepper. I ordered the Tocino Breakfast which consisted of Anise Wine-Cured Pork Shoulder and eggs over a fried garlic rice. The deep red colored pork was shocking but AMAZINGLY tender and flavorfully SWEET. That was different - but good different. Then there were my over-medium eggs over the garlic fried rice. The garlic was a light garlic - not overpowering - as was the fried texture and taste. My somewhat goopy egg yolks were just as I prefer. Then there was the little cup of brown stuff which I thought was like refried beans. Boy was I wrong! I'm not sure what it is called, but it was a cold, chocolate flavored, sticky rice pudding thingy. (Of course I didn't realize it was a cold item until after I blew on a forkful and put it in my mouth! lol) It was quite tasty! I ordered coffee, and again I didn't ask what kind they served, but it seemed darker - even with several creamers - and richer, yet not at all bitter. The portions were quite generous as well - I'm not a small guy, and I ended up bringing half my pork and rice home as leftovers for tomorrow! My dining companions ordered the Tocino and Skirt Steak Combination With Eggs, and while they enjoyed their well prepared skirt steaks, they really enjoyed the Ticino even more. Service was good, attentive, solid. The price was great too - $9.50 for my meal, including free pre-meal soup, and leftovers! The decor is interesting, there is a sunshade hanging just inside the door, so if you are over 6' tall be careful as you enter! Also there are a couple of stuffed monkey dolls hanging around the window shades and other chotchkies, sprinkled around the dining area. It's not the largest place so seating may be limited, but we did not have to wait at 10:30 on a Thursday.

2016-05-29,5.0,"This place most def lives up to its hype. Came to Chicago for a 4 day rendezvous and visited this place twice. Hands down best filipino breakfast i've had in my life. This place is easily missable, it's on the corner of a district that isn't so glamorous. Diamond in the rough comes to mind. Parking is just where ever you can find a spot in the neighborhood or street.  Walked in, you can go left or right, plenty of seating and great for groups. The Today show highlighted the skirt steak breakfast and that's exactly what I ordered. To start, they give everyone a generous bowl of lugao which is a rice porridge, but mix in ginger, lemon and garlic to spruce up the flavor. So I ordered half skirt steak filipino breakfast. I kid you not the plate it came on was literally a serving tray (like 14"" diameter maybe) laden with the juiciest skirt steak, made medium rare as I ordered, a small side of steak sauce, garlic fried rice, two eggs on top of rice (anyway you like, but sunny side up seems to be the filipino way), a side of a tomato/cilantro/garlic salsa (tasted like ceviche but without the seafood) along with a serving of champorado (chocolate tapioca pudding, not sweet at all). All this for $12. Holy mackerel, this is a deal of a lifetime. Got to meet the owner, the actual Uncle Mike who was sweet to pull up a chair and hang/chat with us for like half an hour. He is there everyday, very involved in the running of this very successful establishment. he cooks and makes sure that you had the best experience ever. For a caucasian guy (he married a filipino lady), he can cook a mean filipino dish, and even picked up some of the filipino customs as well. He came back with more lugao for us to take home.  Will always come back here whenever I'm in Chicago. This has the overall five star experience for food and excellent customer service.",0.9895,0.842,0.129,0.028,0.445436507936508

2016-05-24,5.0,"i never even knew what filipino breakfast was until Uncle Mike's came into my life. I've consistently gotten their tocino breakfast combo which is grilled cured pork shoulder with eggs, garlic fried rice, and a bowl of lugao (aka congee aka porridge). It does the trick everytime. I leave with a full belly and extremely satisfied. Their house coffee is, surprisingly, good! Like really, really good for a diner. I usually get 3 refills. Why not when it's free? Sometimes, maybe when they had the chance to eat breakfast before working, will give out free dessert! I got chocolate rice pudding once. It doesn't sound appetizing, but low and behold, i gulped it in a minute. My bf has gotten the bangus breakfast, which is the boneless marinated milkfish, and the longanisa breakfast - sweet chorizo sausages. Every breakfast combo comes with eggs, garlic rice, and a bowl of porridge which has a hint of lemon. Plates are HUGE so i always have leftovers. The grilled pork and sausages are only $9.95, milkfish was $14.95.

2016-05-23,3.0,"Me, my sister and cousin came here recently as recommended by a friend. Seating was no problem as it was adequate and a spacious restaurant! Yet, having been familiar with Filipino food, we came here hoping to indulge ourselves in the full-filipino breakfast experience; however, this is a distorted notion in one too many ways! First of all, from the moment you enter and get seated I swear from the waitress/waiter taking your order to the cook do not expect to see any hint of Filipino. The Lugaw(porridge-which is essentially congee)with chicken bits they serve would be tastier with some patis(fish sauce) and calamansi(Chinese orange). I absolutely enjoyed my Tocino and skirt steak combo[the best part wasn't the skirt steak, it was the pico de gallo and cilantro garnish on my plate and side of champorado(soft sweet rice in chocolate)]. My sister thought her Longanisa and skirt steak should have been cooked abit[I agree on the Longanisa(sweet chorizo) but I think they might have mixed up my medium with her well done]. Generally service was good as the waiter was able to find us some banana catsup and get us some patis for our lugaw, and they apologized and brought us a new batch of not spicy spam for my niece! Price was reasonable for portion! Ultimately this is an Asian-Mexican American fusion joint!",0.96,0.855,0.118,0.027,0.4914562289562288

Kids loved their pancakes. The chefs here definitely know how to cook. Service was great as well. Our waitress, was very nice and attentive. Everyone was just bustin their asses on this busy day. One thing I want to get out here though is that I think Mike is not as nice as everyone thinks. When we came in before, wasn't that busy if I remember correctly, Mike was just throwing things everywhere in the kitchen and cursing out loud. Everyone out front could hear but didn't mind because we were all enjoying our food. I witnessed the same thing today except for the barrage of kitchen materials flying around. Mike you are an a-hole if you talk to your staff that way. Maybe that's why your restaurant seems understaffed. I'm giving Uncle Mike's 4 stars for excellent food and great service.

2016-04-11,2.0,"My fiance and I decided on Uncle Mike's for breakfast as we were up early enough on Saturday morning to beat the crowds and were in the mood for something a little different than the standard bacon and eggs. The 4-star-rated FIlipino breakfast seemed to perfectly fit the bill. Yelp, you did me dirty this time.  Arriving before 8, we were told to sit anywhere we liked, as only one other table was in use at that point. Our server immediately brought water and a bowl of lugow, a chicken and rice soup with some lemon slices, that was pretty watery and bland for our taste. Adding salt helped highlight the lemon and green onion flavors as garnish, but overall I felt it was under seasoned and would have preferred a bolder taste. For my main meal, I chose the Tocino (pork shoulder) and my fiance got the longanisa (chorizo). Both meals come with garlic rice, eggs, some salsa, and a small cup of chocolate tapioca pudding. We continued to be underwhelmed by the food; the garlic rice was good, but I thought it could have used even a bit more garlic. The pink-hued pork shoulder slices had a little more fat in the meat-to-inedible-fat ratio than I prefer, and reminded me of less flavorful Chinese BBQ spareribs in taste. My fiance felt similarly about the pink-hued sausages on his plate. The chocolate tapioca pudding, at the risk of repeating myself again, had a hint of cocoa taste, but ended up more closely tasting like watered-down instant hot chocolate at a large group event, and I just didn't enjoy the gummy tapioca with only a mild hint of sweetness; I have a thing about chewy food textures, and this set it off. They didn't overcook my over-easy eggs is the best thing I can say about what we ate.  Despite the large portion sizes, from start to finish we felt like the taste of the food had been muted to about half of what it should have been; if Guy Fieri needed directions to Flavortown, I would point him far in the opposite direction. The service itself was quick, but we spent $30 for one of the most mediocre meals we've ever eaten. We wouldn't eat here again.",0.9777,0.891,0.088,0.021,0.49631242740998843

2016-03-30,3.0,"Hands-down, probably the most attentive service I have ever had in a coffee shop!  But I headed here for the 4 & 5 star Yelp rated menu , and frankly, it really fell short of all the hype.  I ordered the ""famous"" marinated skirt steak which appears in approximately 40% of the pictures posted for this restaurant!  (Do we need another pic of the same steak & hash browns?) The server did inform me that the price had gone up a few dollars from that which was listed on the menu. No problem.  I requested  my hash-browns & toast well done and the steak medium rare. When order arrived , she  noticed that the hash browns were not well done , & offered to have them further cooked. The steak was rare , so she took it back for further cooking as well.  By the time my plate came back for the third time the eggs & potatoes were cold!  The skirt steak , lukewarm.   While skirt steak tends to be a cut of beef that requires some chewing, my order had not been properly handled in the kitchen. A quick sear on the flat top and proper butchering would have helped . Even though I tried slicing on a slight angle across the grain, it was extremely difficult to chew. While my 1/2 order was more than ample in portion size , the texture made it very unpleasant . The marinade was perhaps a little too vinegary for my liking , and lacked salt.  Overall, the staff here are extremely friendly and very helpful. The coffee , delicious. Was it an off day at Uncle Mike's today? Not sure . Maybe I'll come back and try the fried milkfish & eggs.

2016-03-16,3.0,"Pros: Near the Red Line, about as authentic as it gets both in portion and taste.  Cons: Breakfast/Lunch hours only, smaller venue but optimized space Uncle Mike's was only a 5-10 minute walk from the Red Line which was perfect for my friends and I. I got pretty stoked for an authentic Filipino-American breakfast and so were my friends. The total count was ~ 9 people.  The servers was kind and attentive, and the service was quick considering the large group we came with. The food itself was pretty good and definitely authentic but whether it was the large group or what, my bangus/tocino combo was lukewarm, something I wasn't too happy about. The taste was pretty on point though and the portions are truly Filipino. When it comes to large parties, they're usually seated in the back part of the restaurant which wasn't an issue until the waitresses were scraping off plates into a garbage can right next to our table! I understand the space-crunch but there was still a kitchen we were seated against and I was put off by bus-boy duties being handled barely a few feet away from our table. I know it's a casual atmosphere there but that was a little too close for comfort. Bonus: Maybe it was due to timing, but we got some extra arroz caldo to go since I think they were about to close soon.",0.9958,0.762,0.223,0.015,0.5746159754224271

If you dine in, you get champorado as a desert. It comes with the main dish. I guess if  it's take out, this is not included because both of my orders for take out did not have it.

The skirt steak was done precisely as I ordered it, tasted great with the marinade and I would highly recommend it. However bringing it down was the scrambled eggs on top of the dish. The eggs were not at all fluffy and, instead, were flat and dried out. The Chopped steak was overcooked and had a strange consistency. The biggest disappointment though was the bill. I was charged 10% more than the menu price for the skirt steak breakfast. The staff pointed out that the higher price was on the last line of a chalkboard that was behind my field of vision. I told them that it wasn't right to charge more than what was on the menu. I ordered from the menu.

I, on the other hand, went with the ""Tocino,"" which were wine-cured pork shoulders.  The taste resembled with the Chinese cha siu, except it was savory.  This reminded me of my childhood home in Taiwan, where lots of street vendors in the night markets sold Taiwanese-style sausages.   Daddy J. certainly was fond of his skirt steak.  By the way, our entrees were presented using an XL circular plate, with various side dishes (pico de gallo, coconut sweet bean jelly, and garlic rice with eggs of any style).  Thus, Uncle Mike's knew how to feed his children!   I personally don't think Uncle Mike's is the ""cheapest"" option in the city: $32 and some change with two (2) breakfast entrees and two (2) large bottomless coffee.  Yet you will probably be full until dinner time if you're a normal-appetite individual like myself.",0.9861,0.867,0.128,0.006,0.4964120370370371

2015-05-23,5.0,"Stopped into Uncle Mike's for my 3rd visit and the quality of food, level of service and overall experience has been superbly consistent each time. During this visit, ordered the Filipino Breakfast - medium rare skirt steak, sunny side eggs and garlic rice.  Grits or hash browns are the other two side item options, but the rice compliments the dish to my liking. The steak is super tender with great flavors.  Mike uses a simple yet effective marinade, consisting of soy sauce and 7-UP and various other spices.  The meat is juicy and thankfully avoids being over-chewy, a pitfall of many other skirt steak options at all-too-many breakfast diners around the city. The eggs were cooked perfectly and when mixed into the rice, provide a nice textural contrast to the dish.  A touch of black pepper and sriracha hot sauce add a level of heat that only adds to the dish's multi-layers of flavor: savory, salty & sweet.  While the portion may be a bit on the larger size (always a good problem), the leftover meat can be reheated and turned into a tasty steak sandwich for lunch or dinner. In terms of service, this place makes you feel like you're actually visiting family, as its name suggests.  During each visit, Mike made the rounds to check on food quality and to socialize with regulars and or first time customers.  Don't be surprised to get more food than you order, particularly in the form of a complimentary bowl of Lugao, made fresh daily.  Or possibly a taste of an off-the-menu item the cooks are working on in the kitchen.  In addition to Mike's charm and generous approach, the servers are knowledgable, attentive and round out the overall dining experience. In a world of cut-throat business, minuscule food margins and the turn and burn nature of many food establishments, Uncle Mike's Place is a nice change of pace, that serves phenomenal food.  I highly recommend to drop by for a great breakfast/lunch and stick around for the conversation.",0.9973,0.778,0.199,0.022,0.5356105006105005

This is one of my favorite brunch places in Chicago because of the food and its fantastic value. Portions are very sizeable and excellent for the price. But I have only had the combos, thus I have no opinion on the rest of the fairly large menu (sandwiches, omelettes, etc) because I'm always too busy stuffing my face with the meats, egg, rice, and lugao.  The complementary lugao (rice porridge) bowls vary in quality, some days they seem a little more watery than others, but overall are excellent. The fried garlic bits, green onions, occasional chicken pieces, and rice in a chicken broth garnished with a lemon is really the best way to start any meal on a weekend morning.  The garlic rice is also very good. Light and when topped with a couple over-easy (or however you prefer) eggs, is perfect with the various meats.  The pork shoulder is excellent. Sweet and savory with a bit of crispy fat. So good. The skirt steak is also quite good, well marinated and flavored. Both the half and full sizes are satisfying/filling and come with A1 sauce. The sausages are also delicious as sausages should be; definitely of the sweet Asian variety though. Don't be expecting the heavy salty punch of European encased meat mash. The combos also come with a small dish of diced tomato and onions that go nicely with everything else on the big plates.   The milkfish is a little more disappointing. I've only had it once and it was fairly dry and the flavor non-descript.  Service is pretty good. Once, near the end of our meal, we got extra cabbage-borscht-like soup on the house for no discernable reason. I don't think they knew that I am a big fan of soup...but maybe they somehow did. Sometimes the kitchen seems to get pretty busy and the food takes a little longer to come out but I would never call the service here slow.  We are usually seated within 15 minutes, even on a busy late Saturday morning. Parking is easy, or the 65 bus drops you off right in front of the restaurant. Place is easy to find.

On an early Sunday morning, it's nice that Uncle Mike's is open early so right after church, we can satisfy our cravings. Uncle Mike was there together with only 2 servers. It was busy but the servers were quick. Uncle Mike also helped out a bit. He even gave us hot tea and lugaw (hot, rice chicken congee/soup) while waiting for our meal. Food is always good here no matter what!!!!  This is the ONLY Filipino breakfast place that has survived for so many years in downtown Chicago, that's why we continue to patronize it and even bring friends here. So expect it to be a busy place especially on weekends, that's why we always go there earlier (like around after 8am). My favorite here is the tocino (sweet meat) and bangus (fried milk fish) and their pancakes too are so good, it makes me remember the pancakes (which we use to call hotcakes) I've had in the Philippines growing up. Uncle Mike's Filipino dishes mixed with Continental/American breakfast is truly great match!   We Filipinos are grateful and appreciate that Uncle Mike's is continuing to serve the community by introducing Filipino breakfast to other people of various ethnicity who would like to try something different. Thank you for welcoming us to your restaurant and for opening up your doors as early as 6am so we can satisfy our cravings which makes us miss our motherland (Philippines) more.",0.9961,0.789,0.197,0.014,0.5753348214285715

We were already upset how we were greeted at the restaurant, but what killed our mood was when they tried to squeeze the 6 of us in a small table that can barely accommodate 3-4 people.   The servers were working really hard,  and instead of John either entertaining the customers or refilling coffee cups,  or taking some parts away,  he was just standing there most of the time.

One thing is for sure: do NOT getting the Uncle Mike's burger. I'll tell you why. Location: It is located in the middle of no where. It is on the edge of Ukrainian Village and West Side. However, there is tons of free street parking.  Price: I ordered the marinated steak combo that was displayed as $15.95. The restaurant charged me $16.95. When I asked why the extra charge, the cashier flipped a sign at the cash register saying ""Our beef prices have gone up."" I did not care about the extra charge, but just be aware that you will be paying more for beef products. Food: Ordered a marinated steak combo (lugao, 2 eggs, steak, garlic fried rice, chocolate pudding) and a Uncle Mike's burger deluxe (deluxe = comes with 2 sides) (1) The lugao that comes with it is basically congee with green onions, ginger, pork, and a slice of lime. It was not really that good if you compare it to any Chinese congee. (3 out of 5) (2) The steak I ordered was probably overdone since it came out quite black when I asked for medium rare. The steak they use is the thin and long with cross cuts. (3 out of 5) (3) The rice that comes with it is garlic fried rice. They basically put garlic oil and rice together. It tasted bland while I was anticipating something more... flavorful. Still not as good from a Chinese perspective. (2 out of 5) (4) The eggs were OK. (You can't really must up with eggs as a restaurant.) (3 out of 5) (5) I ate a small sample of the chocolate pudding. (Don't like chocolate.)  (6) The Uncle Mike's burger was not good at all.

We arrived at 10:30 on a very busy Sunday.  Know that this place, since being featured on a local food show, is packed all the time so you will probably have to wait.  Now that the weather is turning colder, they are encouraging you to use their side door (facing Grand) as what used to be the main entrance opens directly to the dining area making it freezing in there for the patrons. Lucky for us- our friends had gotten there at 10, secured a table and we were seated immediately. The menu has a mix of Filipino breakfast favorites (including a SPAM breakfast) as well as American classics such as pancakes, omlettes, etc. We ordered a range of foods from the pumpkin pancakes to a custom omelette to a couple of those crazy Filipino breakfasts.  When the plates came- the portion sizes were huge!  But we must have all been hungry as we cleaned our plates by the end. Service had a few timing issues with our food coming up at different times, we had to repeatedly ask for coffee and the darn door kept opening to let in the cold air which made for a chilly breakfast.

I ordered the baby bangus with overeasy eggs served with garlic rice.  Our meals came out pretty quickly and were served on gigantic plates.  The only thing about those plates was that our entrees weren't that large.  They took up the whole table unnecessarily.  Maybe I'm being a little too nit-picky.  Anyway, the food look ok, so I dug in.  The eggs and rice were pretty ordinary.  I'm not sure I like to eat fish for breakfast, but it was probably the best part about my meal, but was definitely a ""baby"" sized portion.

After being seated, we were each given a glass of cold water.  Since we were both familiar with Filipino food, it did not take us very long to decide what we were going to order.  Perhaps, since the restaurant was full, it seemed our server took a long time in getting to us.  When she did arrive with pen and paper in hand to take our order, she never asked what we would care to drink!  Usually, in this type of setting, you are offered coffee.  We were not, but we ordered some anyway and the refills were far and few between.     I ordered a full Skirt Steak Breakfast, which is supposed to be a house special.  I saw this dish on a segment of Channel CLTV's ""Chicago's Best.""  The host commented on how large the cut of meat was.  The one that I was served couldn't have been more than 6 ounces before it was cooked.  Furthermore, my guess is it was marinated by using soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, and perhaps a touch of mono-sodium glutamate.  There was nothing special about that. The second plate was a small order of Boneless Bangus (Milk Fish).  When the fish arrived to our table, it was full of bones.  We asked to speak with the manager.  The manager apologized and offered to replace the fish with another Boneless Bangus.  We accepted his offer.  While waiting for the replacement order, we could not help but notice that the manager was speaking with the server who waited on our table.  After which, she came to our table to inform us that only the large order of Bangus was boneless.  I asked, ""Since it is not described that way on the menu, how are we supposed to know this?""  She replied by letting me know that the writing of the menu was not her responsibility.    Each breakfast plate came with Chicken Arroz Caldo (Chicken Lugao) - but it did not have any chicken in it.  It was tasteless and instead of calamansi, they buried a slice of lemon in the bowel.  Also, a sizable portion of fried garlic rice was included with our orders.  Unfortunately, it was not the best fried garlic rice that I had ever tasted.  Two eggs are also included.  We ordered one set sunny side up and the other over easy.  Both arrived over cooked! We continued to eat our breakfast while waiting for the replacement fish to arrive.  When it finally arrived, we asked the server to pack it to go.  She did and even offered us the small Bangus that had bones in it free of charge.",0.9789,0.896,0.077,0.027,0.5909593837535012

I went for brunch on Sunday morning and ordered a short stack of pumpkin pancakes, two sunny side up eggs and an order of longaniza. The server seemed attentive at first, quickly taking our order and checking in on us periodically, but it was when the food arrived that things took a turn for the worse. He proceeded to set our food down in front of us and while I received my longaniza, there were no eggs in sight and worst of all, the pancakes were buttermilk! Picking my battles, I decided to address the pancake issue and politely asked, ""Are these pumpkin?"" He looks at me square in the faced and says, ""Yes."" The juevos on this guy! I mean everyone at the table knew it was a bold faced lie. Shocked by his incredulousness and placated by the delightful smell of the pancakes, I decided not to push the issue further. The eggs were never to be seen. Needless to say, I don't think i'll be going back for a long time, if ever.

If you are looking for typical breakfast fare (cakes, meat, potatoes, omellets), they've got you taken care of. They also have what looks like a nice lunch menu, although I've never had anything off of it. I usually come and get one thing, and one thing only: FILIPINO BREAKFAST COMBO They have several kinds, the most common combo is the Tocino (pork shoulder cured with anise and something sweet) and Longanisa (sausages w the same marinade/rub as the tocino). The flavor is incredible. Simply incredible. You get a nice hunk or two of shoulder, w two small sausages. It's clear they are made in the backroom.  Add to this garlic flavored rice, two eggs however you want them, a small bowl of chocolate rice/tapioca pudding, and a pre-breakfast bowl of porridge/soup called Lugaw, also made in house. I have nothing else, other than give this place a try.

My boyfriend was happy to see that he can get an American breakfast with his favorite Filipino dish on the side. (Longanisa). I ordered the Bangus (Deep fried Milkfish that is marinated with garlic and vinegar) and Tocino with garlic friend rice and a side of tomatoes and onions). The server brought us out a concoction that the chef made with spaghetti pasta, mungo beans, and tripe-I was not a fan of it. The server didn't even know what to call it. It was totally weird. My boyfriend ordered the Potato pancakes with a side of Longanisa (Cured sweet pork).  We waited for what seemed to be a bit ""too long"" in our book but eventually got our brunch. The tocino was good but I felt like it was too fatty. The bangus was ""meh"" at best. It was very bone-y. Really nothing worth writing in capital letters for. My boyfriend, on the otherhand had perfectly cooked potato pancakes served with apple sauce and sour cream. His longanisa was delightful. He was kind enough to share his meal success with me.

It was really busy but regardless, the staff kept a positive energy up, with the exception of one waitress (not ours). She was really condescending to fellow servers and the cooks who were obviously doing the best to crank out food as quickly as possible.

Pretty extensive classic breakfast items but they are known for their Filipino breakfast items. Parking - street parking isn't hard to find around the area which makes it that much better since lack of parking sort of deters me from going to certain restaurants.  Longaniza and Tocino combo - came with garlic fried rice and 2 eggs any style. So delicious and definitely hit the spot! A minor complaint: the Tocino was a little dry.

Honestly, this huge combo filipino meat and egg dish was so flavorful and really satisfying. Not only is it huge, but the flavor is intense for breakfast, which is exactly what I enjoy since I am all about the savory and not the sweet.  The Filipino combo I ordered came with 2 types of Filipino meats, two large eggs served over rice(perfect for over soft to let the yolk run through the rice), some pico and a cup of soup which is similar to congee only with more flavor.

All in all, this not so small diner on the outskirts of Ukie Village is a great place to come anytime of the day.

Let's recap: Uncle Mike is not Filipino, but his wife is, and their Filipino breakfasts now take center stage on the Uncle Mike's Place menu. You get your choice of tocino (marinated pork), longganisa (Filipino chorizo), Spam (original or spicy), bangus (fried milkfish), skirt steak or porkchop as your meat, or you can combine them. I say go for Spam and longganisa. You also get eggs and garlic fried rice, some sasawan (vinegar salsa-like condiment) a bowl of soup (lugau - Filipino rice porridge) and champorado (chocolate rice pudding). I haven't had an issue with service at all the last few times I've come, and while I do wish they had other Filipino offerings (just because there aren't that many places in Chicago that do Filipino food), their breakfast is excellent. You also get a good amount of food, perfect for satiating cravings after a long night out. They've definitely upped their game in the past three years, and it shows.

All the food was under cooked, and the eggs were a little cooked but almost raw. I pointed this out nicely to our server. Instead of him remaking the food, they did nothing to the hash and potatoes (which came out cold this time), and simply threw the eggs back on the grill instead of remaking them. The toast was also rather hard. Coffee tasted like they use chlorine based soap in their mugs and/or coffee machine.

It comes with eggs, fried rice, and a bowl of amazing lugao - a simple but amazing congee with shallots and green onions. I would go just to get a big bowl of the lugao, it is that good. They're also known for their sweet chorizo - or ""longanisa"" - and pork shoulder breakfasts. Because Uncle Mike himself is always tinkering with the recipes, no two meals are exactly the same.

We've decided that cheating on each other for the food is totally acceptable. This place had been on my to do list for a long time. I finally made it there a few months ago, and I've been back as often as humanly possible. Each time I've gone, I get the Filipino breakfast. In fact, I think it's my favorite breakfast in the entire city, now that Ramova is closed *sad face*.  Breakfast starts with a bowl of lugaw. It's a garlicky rice porridge with chicken and lemon. I want to eat this every day in the winter, and whenever I'm under the weather. Next comes the main event. Both the tocino (anise cured, thick cut bacon) and the longonisa (anise cured sausage, similar to chorizo) are a sure bet. Besides your choice of meat, breakfast is served with garlicky rice, topped with two eggs your way. I recommend fried so that you can break the yolk and mix it in the rice. Mouthgasm. It also comes with a side of red beans that are almost chocolaty. I know it sounds weird, but it's delicious. There's also a small side of something similar to a pico de gallo, that I steer clear of because they put devil lettuce (cilantro) in it. Add some Intellegentsia coffee and great service to the mix, and you've got a winner in my book. The fella has branched out further through the menu, and everything that he's ordered has also been phenom. Fruit plate is huge, fresh, and cheap. Blueberry pancakes are to die for. He got a spinach, tomato, feta omelet on the last visit that was great.

Honestly, if I ever have a tocinolog or bangus craving, I only have one place in mind: Uncle Mike's. The prices are about $12 a plate which is a little more than I am used to for breakfast but the portion size fits the bill. Also, I always go for the combo where you can select from two of the following: tocino, longonisa and/or hot and spicy Spam. To round off the entree it comes with a side of garlic rice and diced tomatoes and onions in vinegar. They even throw in a small bowl of lugao. It is somewhat bland without any of the fixings so don't be afraid to ask for Patis, Realemon or vinegar; they have it. Add in a small or large bangus to share with friends and you are back in Mom's kitchen. I kept one star off because the service can be shotty at times especially if you are in a big group.

The laminated menu reminded me of bad diner food, the coffee from Metropolis I don't like and the waiters noticeably lagged after 7 hours of Sunday brunch. Girlfriend ordered the steak and eggs only to be told ten minutes later by a tired waiter that uncle mike had run out of skirt steak. She changed her order to patty melt. The surprise was the food had quality. First we received a lemony garlicky rice porridge called lugao. The waitstaff though understandably hobbled after the bulk of a ninety plus degree shift covered coffee refills and worked as a team. A second server brought mayonnaise for my partner's patty melt. The French fries were hand cut. The potato salad was homemade. My sausages were sweet. My rice was garlicky. My eggs were cooked to perfection- over easy. I think there was fish sauce in the salsa. And despite leaving full I still limped to hoosier mama for a big piece of banana cream pie that I scarfed in its entirety like a sick dog.",0.8658,0.833,0.107,0.06,0.4239495798319327

2012-05-26,5.0,"I've never had Filipino food before (except for the egg rolls) so was on board when my friend, J, suggested we go for Friday brunch.  It's a super casual diner atmosphere so I would have felt comfortable showing up in my pj's.  There was no wait so we picked a sun-drenched table and as soon as we sat down our waitress brought us our menus and a large soup bowl of lugao for each of us.  Lugao is like a rice porridge with great chicken and lemon flavor - I loved it!  And the bowl was pretty big - I would have been happy and full with just a bowl of that!  When our waitress came by I asked her what the popular dishes were under the Filipino breakfast category (the menu has plenty of American breakfast foods too) and she said the Loganiza (this delicious sweet chorizo - mmm, now my new fave!) and Tocino (2 slabs of pork shoulder with a bit of a sweet taste).  Perfect - there was a combo dish of that!  Then the waitress asked how I liked my eggs - the pictures in the menu were over easy so I went with the eggs in the pics.    Out comes a HUGE plate of amazing food - good amount of garlic rice with 2 perfectly done over easy eggs, a bowl of sweet rice pudding (??, not sure what it was but tasted just like a Hawaiian dessert called haupia), a small bowl of pico de gallo, 2 tocinos and 2 slabs of loganiza.  As you're reading this, it might sound like the most random combo of foods, but everything on the plate just paired so nicely with each other I wanted to be sure I had a little of everything on my plate in each bite.  I ate a lot but still had enough leftover for it to be a complete dinner meal the next day. After we paid, someone from the kitchen came out and brought us 2 huge containers of their chicken noodle soup.  She explained that since they make the soup fresh every day and they were closing up for the day soon, they were giving it away to all of their customers.  I had the soup when I got home and it was delicious and you can tell it was homemade chicken broth with big chunks of white meat chicken, good portion of noodles and fresh herbs.  FANTASTIC! We need more brunch places like this - unique and delicious homemade food, good portions, and great service in a unpretentious setting where you can lay back.  Will be back!",0.9982,0.769,0.219,0.012,0.647803220171641

Good value for your $: - free house tea - free soup (aka lugaw, a simplier version of congee) for dine-in with roasted garlic - bottomless intelligensia coffee - Filipino breakfast dishes can serve 2 without overeating Longaniza with Tocino, yum!

2012-05-06,3.0,"Awkward!  (sing-song voice).   This is how I felt when I walked in out of the rain this morning with my wife and my sis-in-law.  We parked west of the store front and walked past the side door, because I don't usually think of side doors as entry ways.   So we walked into the corner/front door and squeezed past some diners to what I would have assumed to be the host/hostess station.  The gentleman manning said station was doing something when I walked up to it, but gave me a hello and a how ya doing.  I replied with a cheery ""hey, doing all right"" and waited for him to retort with a ""can I help you?"" or  a ""How many?""  I stood there for what felt like a commercial break before he finally said something to me.   ""How can I help you?""  ""Um, table of 3?"" He looked around the dining room and then says, it's going to be a little bit of a wait.  I understand how that's possible, so I say it's fine, and walk back to the far wall to wait for our table.  Before I can even settle in on my wait, he's back to tell me there's a table for 2, but is wondering if we don't mind squeezing in.  I thought, if it's just going to be a couple of minutes, why would I want to squeeze into a 2-top?  I said yes anyway, not knowing that sitting at a table for 2 would mean that I would initially be invisible for a short part of our meal.   We were shown to our table and got extra chairs since there was only one there.  After we all sat down, we got 2 menus.  I deferred them to the ladies.  Coffee mugs came, but only 2.  My sis-in-law asked for another mug from one of the bussers, who then replied, ""A mug of what?""  ""Just an empty mug, we only have 2""  Right after that, our server came and said are you ready to order?  i never even got to glance at the menu!  I guess it didn't matter because I knew what I wanted, but I just don't like to feel like I'm not in the room.  Like I need to ask for my own mug and menu?  It was just weird/strange.   So the food?  It was good!  We each ordered something different... Wife - Spicy spam Me - Tocino and Longaniza Sis-in-Law - Bangus (marinated Milkfish) We were eating a bit of a late breakfast so they ran out of Lugao unfortunately.  I was looking forward to it.  Instead we got 3 bowls of Black eyed pea and pork soup, and while that doesn't have the same effect on my heart, it was satisfactory as a pre-meal for me.  It came with rice, and the soup had good smoked flavor from the pork, and was piping hot.   Spicy Spam - A staple of all Filipino households, this spam was sliced thick and fried to a crisp.   Longaniza and Tocino - 7/10.  It was good, it wasn't exceptional, but that's only because I've been eating it all my life and with the exception of uncooked or extremely fatty versions of these cured pork based meats, they're pretty much all the same,  The tocino on my plate was well done and lean looking, and since my wife was wavering between the tocino and the spam, I ordered a side of tocino for us to split.  The second tocino that came was not the same as what showed up on my plate.  the side order had huge HUGE hunks of fat and was not as well done as mine, so I ended up giving her my lean well done Tocino and ate the fatty ass not-so-well done Tocino.  That's LOVE.   Bangus - One of the best things to happen to fish...Marinated in vinegar and smoked then fried.  Sounds digusting, tastes great to Filipinos all over the world!  Lucky for me, my sis doesn't like the fatty part of the fish which is THE BEST PART.   All of our meals came with garlic fried rice, I just felt like mine wsan't garlicky enough although my wife had garlic taste in her mouth after the meal, so maybe I just have a higher garlic threshold?   Overall, I liked what I ate and I would come back to try other things like the famous marinated skirt steak, but I would hope for less awkwardness the next time around.",0.9985,0.811,0.153,0.036,0.5165048840048841

We went in and immediately seated at a comfortably large table for two near the window.  THE LAYOUT: The decor had some filipino stuff that looked like they grabbed it out of my grandma's kitchen. The tables were large enough to seat several people, and I didn't feel like it was too crowded even though the place seemed quite busy. THE SERVICE: Service was prompt and efficient, but not as friendly as I would've expected. I may be used to my family saying ""ka-in ka-in!"" (english translation = eat! eat!)  I've been to other filipino restaurants before also that seemed a lot more welcoming, but maybe they were overwhelmed on a busy Sunday.  But... SOMETHING WEIRD. So, I came there with a caucasian friend, and I looked at the menu, which seemed lacking to me since I was expecting some filipino food to be on there. He joked, saying ""they probably gave us the White menu"". I looked around at the other tables with filipino people sitting around, and I was flabbergasted. I asked the waiter ""Excuse me, but can I see... the other menu"". He seemed reluctant to provide it for us, and handed us the Filipino menu. Then, when my caucasian company ordered his filipino breakfast, the waiter asked, ""... with the garlic rice?"" in a way that made us feel... different. Maybe they just didn't want to give us culture shock from garlic rice. I also noticed we were given small bowls of lugao with our meal, but everyone else had way bigger bowls. Aside from this, the experience was pleasant. Moving onto THE FOOD. The food was great. Tocino, longanisa, garlic rice, lugao... all good stuff. I do wish the garlic rice had more garlic involved, but it was pretty good.  Their champorrado was tasty. That is the brown-colored sweet rice that is usually served for breakfast or as a dessert. A bit pricey for a breakfast for two, but on a lazy Sunday, it's worth the trip.

I thought it was just the front seating section but there is a whole 'nother space in the back with tables. Plus about 5 stools at the counter. Service is not overly friendly, except for the lady who owns the place. She is super nice! But man, the food makes up for anything Uncle Mike's may be lacking. We got there about Noon and had to wait quite a long while for a table, leaned against the wall as a long line formed behind us.

Cured pork shoulder that is cooked to perfection and tasty beyond belief! Seriously, take a bit of that with some rice and egg on the fork...Holy Jeebus! Heaven on earth! The garlic rice by itself is fantastic, too! The meal came with some eggplant soup which had a good broth but was packed with veggies and as a matter of my taste, I'm not a fan of that.

My favorite was actually the ""lugao"" (rice oatmeal/porridge or congee) - served only on the weekends - which also happens to be free! It is so extremely flavorful because they put garlic, ginger, and fresh lemon juice in it, and when you spoon some fish sauce on top of it and mix it all in, it is the bomb! Other tasty Filipino treats was the ""bangus"" (grilled dried whole milkfish - beware of bones) and the combination breakfast of ""tocino"" (similar to Chinese cha-siu, aka sweet bbq pork) and ""longanisa"" (Filipino sausages). Oh, and they also make a mean spicy Spam that's red! Do they soak it in hot sauce or something?  If you haven't noticed, these aren't for you if you're on a diet.  These breakfasts range from $9-15 and comes with eggs (your way), garlic fried rice, and something similar to coconut rice pudding.  What I didn't like was that it took a while for us to get our food, and the ""best marinated skirt steak"" might have actually been the worst. First, it was overcooked, and second, did you say it was marinated? Cuz I didn't notice.  Since the lugao was the only thing I loved, I probably won't come back because I would rather learn to make it on my own.

My family is from the province of Pampanga, which Anthony Bourdain called ""the culinary capital of the Philippines"".  Needless to say, I've been spoiled like a Hilton heiress when it comes to breakfast.  Uncle Mike and the crew do it very well here.  I expected the Filipino staples (longanisa, tocino, steak), but was pleasantly surprised at the other options.  Bangus (milkfish)? Seriously? And in two sizes - baby, and bigatin, which seeing that word on the menu made me chuckle.

The food is great, the price is very reasonable, and he hooks it up with so much more extra food. I always leave with a to-go bag and an aching stomach, in a good way of course, from all the food he provides. What i like about this place other than the food and staff, is the location! Its so well off hidden that not a lot of people would even notice or find it. I love finding places like these.",0.9742,0.779,0.191,0.03,0.46712121212121205

I've passed this place every M, W, and Friday for the past 2 years on the way to the gym and always wondered what this place was all about. One of my friend's went there last week and posted pics and I just had to check this place out.  The whole concept of the diner offering a Filipino breakfast seemed pretty different and we're adventurous people so why the heck not? So we woke up bright and early this morning and made way to Uncle Mike's. Tip: Don't try to open the door at the corner, you'll look like a dummy like I did. Go to the side door. We got in and it looked like there was a line but it was just a large party ahead of us. I was surprised at how big this place was because it looks tiny on the outside. Uncle Mike must be making a killing because it was packed in here! The menu is rather extensive but I had been yearning to try this Filipino breakfast business. I got the Bangus and my bf got the combo (with sausage and pork shoulder). The Bangus was banging. It was very flavorful. The sausage and pork were also very tasty. I actually prefer the sausage here in comparison to the other one's I've tasted from the Filipino grocery stores. It had a much more subtle flavor and wasn't quite as sweet as its counterparts. I also liked that the sausage wasn't electric red like the other ones. The pork shoulder was nice and tender. The garlic rice was pretty good as well. (The meal was also accompanied with some salsa-type concoction, a chocolate tapioca-like pudding and we were started off with a congee of sorts. It started with an L) I have to mention that the pictures posted on here do not give this place justice. The pictures on Yelp appear to be a normal size plate but what they bring you could probably feed a Filipino family of 4. The plate is, no-joke, 16""! It looks like a freaking wall clock. Next time we go, we are going to try their American breakfasts. The plates looked redic! These plates were just as big.

2011-01-29,4.0,"I've been meaning to try this place for a while with their Filipino breakfast, and it was worth a visit, probably repeated visits. After meeting a buddy there we just grabbed a table and were immediately offered coffee, which is a huge plus since I needed it.  And the servers were Johnny on the Spot with the refills because they frequently stopped by to enable my caffeine addiction.  The decor in the front made it feel like a diner but the back made it seem like I was in a family member's fixed up basement. My friend is a regular there and said I could get a combo of longanisa and tocino; so I got that with garlic rice, over easy eggs, and greek toast (they ran out of wheat and multigrain).  You get complimentary soup, I got the lugao, and it was a taste of my childhood with warm rice porridge, chicken (albiet not much) and lemon to add some acid. A great start. The food took longer than I expected, especially for a breakfast place, but when it did it was a huge portion. Lots of tocino and links of longanisa (locally made evidently), good amount of garlic rice topped with my eggs, and a fresh salsa with visible rocks of sea salt.  The garlic rice was very flavorful and the eggs were done right. The meat was nice and fatty, which is how it should be and the salty salsa cut the fattiness of the meat just right. My friend gave me some of his skirt steak and that had a great marinade and it was nicely cooked and juicy. Needless to say I finished it all but I probably should have taken a doggie bag since I was ready to burst.  I really didn't know what to to with the bread since that's usually not part of a Filipino breakfast, but I ate it anyway since I ate all the garlic rice and had meat left. It was super filling, delicious, and reminiscent of my childhood.  It even came with complimentary champorado (chocolate rice pudding sorta thing), but I wish they gave that to us after the entree instead of with it because it became very congealed and cool when I got to it. It was tasty and authentic and I'll probably go again since I have to try the bangus (milkfish) Filipino breakfast, I didn't see that listed. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a hearty breakfast with attentive service.  I even met Mike and he seems like a good guy; I was surprised he wasn't Filipino, but he knows his stuff.",0.9982,0.794,0.197,0.009,0.537817896389325

I guess I know of this place because a bunch of my friends told me about the Filipino breakfast, but don't get it twisted this place is a full scale diner.  I looked at the menu and they got errrythang...from omelette's, to Monte Cristo's to skirt steaks. I plan on coming here often enough that I will have tried out the majority of the menu by this Summer. The prices are fairly cheap considering the quality of the food you get. The place itself is bigger than it seems once you are inside.  The Filipino breakfast can be described in one word...LEGENDSOME. That is ""legendary"" and ""awesome"" squished together. I had the Tocino breakfast or what we call ""tocilog."" The other is the Longanisa breakfast which is called ""longsilog."" I don't have time to explain so please Google it if you desire an explanation. They also have Spam, which is really more of a Hawaiian breakfast staple. They offer Skirt Steak, and Pork Chops under Filipino Breakfast as well.  OK, back to my Tocino breakfast...*buuuuuuurrrp* looks like I'm done. Tocino is cured pork, and it was the cure for my man-size hunger. The breakfast comes with eggs, garlic fried rice, toast, a side of tomato, onion, vinegar dip, and a small chocolate rice porridge or ""champurrado."" I enjoyed every bite of my meal, and I'm already plotting my return trip.

To be honest, this place doesn't deserve 5 stars.... BUT 6 or more!! The environment was calm nice and quiet with some background music (near closing they switch over to songs in tagalog), and the staff/waitress were kind and polite and so accommodating. What we all had was the Tocino breakfast I think, two eggs, two links of filipino sausage, slices of pork, rice and a bowl of chopped tomatoes and onios, and either patis (fish sauce) or vinegar. I forgot. We really enjoyed it.. and it can take a while to finish eating this plate, or we were just taking our time. Then without expecting we were given a complimentary plate on the house. It was some tasty grazed beef slices, forgive me I forgot what it was called, but it was good. So we're were finishing that up as much as we can and given another complimentary plate of Spam, with rice sprinkled with dried seaweed shreds. And the Spam tasted unique with this hint of spice, and is better than the canned Spam or other Spam that I tasted, for example the Masubi at L & L.  So, again we we're finishing that up, and we were at the fullest already. Then given a complimentary plate of camote (sweet potato). I haven't had camote as a dessert that often, but again this was good and tasty.  We could not finish everything I still had some pork slices and beef and spam and rice and toast, oh yeah forgot also had toast on the side with our breakfast. So we took the rest home in a box. And later we saw a gentlemen that would appear to be Uncle Mike himself. One of my friends just spoke and had quite long conversation, just talking about anything ordinary like filipino culture and where we were vacationing out of and so on, and if related or anything of that sort. Then we paid/tipped graciously and took a group picture with him. Now, I don't know why given the complimentary meals and dessert (probably because I was Facebooking where I was and taking pics of the food), but we went on a weekday about near the last hour and a half before they close. I'd think we were lucky? I don't know. We're unsure when's the next time we're ever going to be in Chicago IL again, probably not for a while. We went during the freezing time.

If you're like me, you find the average brunch fare to be a bit on the boring side.  However at Uncle Mike's, brunch is not just comprised of pancakes and eggs (though those items are on the menu if that's what you're in the mood for).  It's all about the Filipino breakfast menu on the chalkboard.  I've had the tocino (pork shoulder) , longaniza (Flipino sausage) and the bangus (deep fried milkfish) and all three were delicious, with the tocino receiving extra brownie points for its tasty sweet flavor. Each meal off o the Filipino menu starts off with lugaw, which is more or less like Filipino congee.  Topped with scallions and peanuts and containing chunks of chicken, it's warm and delicious goodness that totally hits the spot on a cold wintery day or after a long night of hard drinking.   Along with the lugaw, each dish also comes with two eggs, toast, a tomato/onion relish and a heaping pile of rice that's coated with sesame oil.  TIP: get your eggs over easy and then bust that yolk all over the rice -- the epitome of sinfully good. Delicious food aside, Uncle Mike's also boasts outstanding service and a warm atmosphere that's more like a small community where people know each other on a first name basis.  Uncle Mike himself is often at the restaurant, catching up with his customers and sending out complimentary food to make sure you enjoy your meal.  I've yet to leave Uncle Mike's without being absolutely stuffed and carrying doggie bags home for later.  In short, Uncle Mike's is a great option you're craving a different yet hearty and delicious brunch.  Highly recommended!",0.9948,0.802,0.183,0.015,0.6298348348348347

Yesterday I had a most unfortunate experience at Uncle Mike's and want to share it with the world. Yesterday, mere moments after our food arrived, a party of about 10 loud, obnoxious people came in and sat at a big table next to us. This cackling woman was sitting about 18 inches from my face, and the volume of her voice and cackling was appropriate for a night club. I tried to drop subtle hints by talking REALLY LOUD to Chris, and asking Chris to repeat everything he said. But those efforts yielded zero results. She just persisted, and her noisy children joined in the chorus by screaming and talking loudly. Like mother, like undisciplined urchins. Ugh. So I took my breakfast and moved to an unoccupied table at the far end of the dining room, but I could still hear her cackling and ridiculously loud voice. The only way to escape the noise would have been to move to the next dining room or go outside. ALL that I wanted was to eat my pumpkin pancakes and bacon in peace. Was that too much to ask? It makes me wonder where such people are raised. I would suggest, perhaps, a barn. But that is insulting to animals who inhabit barns. FML. Let me be clear about one thing: our server was great, the pumpkin pancakes were quite good, the bacon was crisp and delicious, and the orange juice tasted fresh-squeezed. This is all about the unfortunate arrival and subsequent behavior of the large party at the next table.

2010-09-17,4.0,"My friend from work first introduced this place to me. She had heard about it from 190 North when they featured places in Chicago that served Filipino food. Uncle Mike's Place features Filipino breakfast dishes. I have already gone twice since first hearing about it You are given a choice of longanisa (filipino breakfast sausage), tocino (cured pork), a combination of the two, and, a recent addition, spam...yes, that's right. Every one of these will come with fried eggs, toast, and garlic fried rice. Lugao is also served before the main dish comes out. Afterwards, you are also given a small bowl of champorado. Essentially, this is a chocolate rice pudding...what I like about it is that they put a dollop of nutella on top which gives it a nice sweet kick! FOOD: Having been raised in a filipino household where both my parents cooked Filipino food on a regular basis, I tend to be a little more critical of other Filipino foods. That being said, I will start by saying that overall I found the food to be fairly decent. You definitely get the feel that this is an authentic Filipino meal. The portions are large, which I like. The first time I went, I had the tocino which I enjoyed. Eaten with the garlic fried rice, it is a symphony of flavors. Which brings me to my next point. The garlic fried rice, when eaten alone, leaves something to be desired. It could use a tad more garlic and salt. Also, texture-wise, it could be just a little more moist. Otherwise, a decent interpretation of the dish. SERVICE: The servers here are friendly and are very accomodating. That is, if you want to make substitutions to your meal, it is done with little hassle and always with an understanding smile. Also, the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time. No complaints here. APPEARANCE: Don't expect a trendy or high-class look to this place. It's a simple neighborhood restaurant and therein lies the charm of Uncle Mike's Place. FINAL THOUGHTS: I am eager to return to Uncle Mike's. If I can pry myself away from the Filipino breakfast plates, I would very much like to try their other selections as I hear that those are good as well. I'd recommend this place to anyone especially if they are looking for a good introduction into the world of Filipino breakfast.",0.9864,0.85,0.121,0.029,0.48812545787545797

Then came the actual breakfast, the combination plate off the chalkboard, which was filled with delicious goodness (tocino, longanisa, GARLIC fried rice, over easy eggs). Apparently, the longanisa we had was ""not as good"" a batch so the chef served up some ""better"" ones on the house. We also got a deliciously fresh mango plate which just made the experience that much better.  Service was excellent.

2010-08-10,4.0,"So why is it ""Filipino"" anything when it comes from the Philippines?  What the hell is up with the PH-to-F phenomenon? Or is it ""fenomenon""? So a while back I got tired of hearing people tell me, whether they even attempted to be nice about it, or more likely- were just very blunt about saying (in a whiny voice) ""your reviews suck because they are too long and you must like hearing your own voice and you are full of yourself and you like to write about stuff that has no relevance to the place you are reviewing,"" and on and on and on... Simple, and quick is the new mantra- so let's just see how long I can keep my streak of this style going. You come here for one of two things (though I hear the skirt steak is pretty amazing too): tocino and longanisa. Both are breakfast items for around $8 and Filipino.  Both are porky.  Both include rice and a nice tomato and onion based salsa (with fish sauce).  Both have a couple of eggs any style you ask for. Tocino is basically the same cut as what we would know as a really thick cut of bacon, but is marinated and turned pink and tastes amazing.  Longanisa is a small, yet thick sausage that has an incredible flavor and really is worth driving from anywhere in the metropolitan Chicago area for trying. That's it- just go for those things and you won't feel disappointed. Sorry- won't pheel disappointed.",0.9509,0.851,0.106,0.043,0.6013588263588263

Well - not if you really like margaritas with your breakfast fare but in that case you have more serious problems and it doesn't really matter to you anyway. Ahhhh....do I love my new 'hood. Walking distance from 6 or 7 places to welcome me, all fresh and preppy, to serve me my first meal of the day. And yes, please do not doubt - not even for one second - that I am fresh and preppy when I jump out of bed.  That would be rude, and everybody knows it is MY job. Sunday morning - rainy, windy, gray and an escape in the Philippines sound just like what my tour operator ordered. I sit down, look for the Filipino menu on the wall, debating between tocino and longanisa, opt for the first one, and wait - coffee in hand. I survey the decor. Flower tiles reminiscent of a tattoo parlor, a weird wooden sculpture with a bird, a family of penguins - 7 to be exact - just hanging out on the cornice. Beautiful green ceiling, old Chicago style. All the customers are busy with their plates. Our chicken lugaw arrives; very similar to a rice porridge, or to a Chinese congee....delicious. And then......well I exchanged my tocino for the very flavorful longanisa. Garlicky, spicy and slightly sweet - it's my new crack.  Tocino is...........an acquired taste I'd say. I was expecting bacon, Mexican style (duh) and it was definitely porky, but also very, very pink and way too sweet for my porky taste buds. On a second take it was not that bad, the texture was interesting but with longanisas at hand reach there was no hesitation. I stole Reuben's plate. And I am not even ashamed of it. That's what wives do, right? I decided that I really liked rice with my eggs and meat, much more so than the usual heavy, oily hashbrowns. Unless they are from Sunrise Cafe. Or a couple of other places. But still - rice is good, peeps. Real good. Especially with garlic and slightly cripsy. Garlic sausage + garlic fried rice = breakfast of champions.

2010-07-24,5.0,"You must try the Filipino breakfast! My boyfriend and I went to Uncle Mike's Place for the second time today, and it was even better than the first time.  We decided to go, because my Mom read about this place in the paper.  There was a long article about the Filipino breakfast, which is especially interesting since this is not a Filipino restaurant.  This is one of two places in Chicago that I've heard of that serve Filipino breakfast. (If you know more, please let me know) ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE: The first time we went there, it was within a week or two of the article, it was midday on a Sunday, and it was nice out.  That plus the delicious food probably explains why the place was PACKED.  They have a seat-yourself policy, so if there are no tables you just need to keep an eye out for people getting up and stand somewhere out of the way.  We got lucky, and one of the waiters/bus boys (a friendly older guy) made eye contact with us and said he'd watch for a table for us in the back, since we were standing closer to the front and they have a back area with more tables.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful when we could catch her, but the unfortunate part about the place being so busy was that she was covering quite a few tables. Today we went around 9:30 AM, and it was raining, and we had no problem getting a table as soon as we came in.  The front area was busy, but there was no one sitting in the back yet.  We basically had our own personal waitress.  She was super nice and friendly.  She (or the kitchen) made one mistake by giving my boyfriend eggs over-easy instead of scrambled with cheese.  When we told her, she was apologetic and amended the bill.  No big deal. FOOD: I think this is the first place I've been where the food reminded me of being a kid eating a home-cooked meal.  I wasn't born in the Philippines, but growing up in a Filipino household, it was always a special treat to wake up Sunday morning to the smell of garlic fried rice, eggs, and longaniza, and that's how I felt walking down the street to Uncle Mike's Place. Both times, I ordered the longaniza (Filipino sausage) Filipino breakfast, and my boyfriend ordered the tocino Filipino breakfast.  They both come with garlic fried rice, two eggs however you want them, your choice of toast, and a side of a tomato-onion-vinegar combination.  The best way to eat it is to get a big spoonful (or forkful) of rice, egg, longaniza, and tomato-onion-vinegar in one bite.  Believe me.  You'll love it.  Just consider the toast a bonus. Today was especially awesome, because we were each offered a complimentary bowl of lugaw. Yes please!  I'm not sure if they're trying to introduce a new dish or if the chef was just in the mood, but I'm not complaining.  If you don't know what it is, the easiest way to describe it is probably that it is a Filipino chicken and rice porridge.  It's a great dish, because no matter what ethnicity you are, it has a home-cooked familiar taste to it.  It was NOT a little teacup of it either.  It was a nice bowlful of lugaw.  Definitely made my day.  My boyfriend liked it, too. PRICE: $7.95 for a huge breakfast?!  Amazing!  Like I said, it was longaniza, garlic fried rice, two eggs, a side, and toast all for $7.95.  Such an awesome value. I know my review is somewhat incomplete, but haven't you ever been to a place where that one special dish was so damn good that you could care less what their other food tasted like?  I plan on going back again and again.  Maybe I'll try something new next time, but I figure I can get pancakes at any breakfast place.  Might as well stick with food that I already know is DELICIOUS.

2010-07-20,5.0,"Long Live Filipino Breakfast!!! I have never tasted their main menu only the dishes on the Filipino Breakfast, because it's just so #$)%&@) goood!!! The dish comes with garlic fried rice, two eggs, toast, and choice of sausage, pork shoulder, spam, skirt steak, or pork chop.  I had the first three but not the later two (one being that I don't eat beef).  The pork shoulder and sausage are truly truly the best Asian flavored meat I have had in Chi town.  I am sorry to BBQ King and all these other restaurants in Chinatown and Argyle, but it's just soo much better.  The meats are marinated to the perfect amount and the sausage reminded me of my childhood in Taipei and Bangkok.  The spam was good as well but spam is and always have been on the salty side for me.  So imagine two sunny side up eggs'  (my personal preference) broken yolk flowing over the garlic fried rice with either pork shoulder or sausage dipped in the yolk, and did I mentioned the homemade sauce? ( a mixture of fish sauce, vinegar, and more) all mixed into one  into your mouth with all the different flavors dancing accordingly energizing different parts of your pallet.... please tell me you are drooling now because I am!!!  You think that's it right? just a big plate of rice and meat..... NOPE!!! they have homemade Lugaw, which is Filipino for porridge or congee.  Sorry to hate on Chinatown again..... but that bowl of congee reminded me of the streets of Asoke in Bangkok where I used to grab my breakfast during summer vacation...  On top of that Uncle Mike is such a genuine man.  We contemplated his dishes and the next thing you know he was explaining to us how to make it.  Additionally once Uncle Mike learned that we are from Thailand he began to talk about his  adventure with sticky rice, and the proper way to make the sticky rice for mango with sticky rice.  Fantastic place and I am such a fan that I even wrote to DDD on Food Channel begging them to come!",0.99,0.81,0.138,0.052,0.4842460317460318

The food was definitely good.  My wife liked her tocino and I was a fan of the longaniza.  I especially liked the garlic fried rice.  The taste wasn't overwhelming, but it definitely had a flavor that complemented the meats.  The portions were quite generous in my opinion for $7.95, and the huge bowl of fruit for the American breakfast was a nice touch.  My daughter definitely enjoyed that.  Would I go back there?  Sure.  I just wouldn't go when I'm absolutely starving.",0.9962,0.761,0.225,0.014,0.6893162393162393

We showed up at 11:30, and were able to find parking on Grand.  We walk in the door and the tables are are filled up, there are a few people standing along the wall.  We walk over to the cashier and tell him we'd like a table and he tells us to go find any open table.  What?!  ok fine, so we wait (only about 5 minutes) and then a table gets up and leaves.  As we walk over to the table one of the busboys (complete jerk) tells us to hold on and actually asks a couple that had just walked in if they were looking for a table for two.    Whatever, so we sit down and we ask for coffee from our busboy.  He flips our cups over...and comes back 10 minutes later with some coffee.  I ask for cream, he nods and then walks away and doesn't come back with cream.  in his defense maybe he doesn't speak English?  Not sure.  I tried to flag down another busboy and no response.  I actually went up to their little bar area and poured my own cream.   Our waitress comes over and takes our order - we get the Filipino breakfast special with the tocino (tastes a lot like BBQ pork) with garlic fried rice and 2 eggs, and a spam/egg sandwich.  We then proceed to wait for 45 MINUTES for our food.  I'm not joking - it would have been faster to go get deep dish pizza at the busiest Giordano's in the city.  This place is utterly ridiculous.  The food wasn't even that good - the garlic fried rice was a little bland and not as flavorful as you would expect, the tocino was good but very fatty, and the spam/egg sandwich was something I could have made at home...but oh yeah, in only 2 minutes.

Uncle Mike's has its own parking lot, ample street parking (without meters!), and the Grand Ave. bus that drops you at its corner (remember, the red line stops at Grand Ave.!)  Perusing Uncle Mike's website or regular menu, you will not find the Filipino fare. Upon entering the restaurant, look immediately to your left at the holy chalkboard of Filipino breakfasts: longsilog (Filipino sausage), tocilog (Filipino pork), spamsilog (Spam). The meats all come with garlic rice, eggs, sawsawan kamatis (diced onions and tomatoes in vinegar) and a choice of either lugaw (chicken broth rice porridge with a tinge of green onion and ginger) or tea.  PRO-TIP #1: You don't have to limit yourself to one type of meat. I asked for a mixed plate of tocino and longanisa and was charged the standard $7.95. WIN!!!  PRO-TIP #2: Watch out for the coffee refills! My friend was charged for full cups of coffee even though his cups were only topped off.

2009-08-08,5.0,"My sister has been the hype machine for this place ever since she was introduced to it probably like 2-3 years ago. She has been trying to get my family to go here to try to Filipino breakfast the entire time but we live in the burbs while she's in the city. Since my friend and I had time before a wedding yesterday, we decided to grab food with my sister to see what all the hub bub was about. It did not disappoint. THE GOOD: So I hate it when people hype things up to me. I'm the type of person who gets overly excited when someone tries to talk up a movie, a food dish, a restaurant, etc. So my expectations tend to be through the roof and I'm always disappointed (except for one thing, ""The Hangover""). This place is pretty damn good. Apparently I have to go with my sister everytime since she's a regular and knows all the ins and outs of what they have. Every entree comes with soup, but through my sister's request, the waitress gave us arroz caldo, a rice soup with chicken, ginger, and garlic. It was good but lacked a lil flavor. Still pretty good for a diner though. I had the marinated skirt steak, eggs, and garlic fried rice while my sister had the tocino, and my friend had the Monte Cristo that they serve with syrup instead of jelly. Tocino was probably the highlight of the meal. Straight up tender and flavorful. Better than what my grandmas used to make since they would char the hell outta it. Steak was great too. Made the way I like it which is medium rare, it pretty much was the entire plate and was only $13. My friend had the Monte Cristo was really good, but I didn't try it. It looked hearty with the amount of ham they put inbetween the 2 pieces of french toast. The service was very attentive. I drink a lot of liquids and probably had like 4 refills for diet coke that our waitress did pretty quick without even having to be asked. The environment was nice and quiet even with it being 2/3rds full. I hate loud places and I actually had a confortable conversation with my sister and could hear the high class comedy stylings of my friend Justin S.  THE BAD: The garlic fried rice actually wasn't that good. I've had it better in other places, and it seemed to lack flavor. It pretty much tasted like burnt rice with salt.  THE UGLY: There actually isn't an ugly to this. That's how good this place is.

2009-03-23,2.0,"Went here for brunch yesterday and we were...full. *shrug* I liked the sort of kitchy decor, the Ricky Martin album playing through the tracks, the apparent locals and family members there for breakfast. That was pretty cool.  The service was just okay. When we first got there a busser coming out of the (tiny) kitchen nearly ran us over...tight space, there. Then, after we sat down my companion got coffee right away, but I didn't. Maybe they were just changing the pot. Then the server took our order without writing anything down, which made me wonder if she was going to remember all of it (later, she had messed up on a part of the fruit plate, but apologized and swiftly brought the correct item). Our coffee cups went empty about three times and stayed that way until we gestured for a refill, each time.  The food was okay. Within a few minutes of sitting down, the server started bringing out little dishes of some kind of french toast/bread pudding stuff for everyone to try. It was soggy pieces of bread hit with some maple syrup. Mush in the mouth. Nice concept, generous thing to do, but it needs more development. My companion got an omelette, which he said he really liked (and it was HUGE!) but when I asked why he was just picking at it, he said it had too much cheese. ""Too much cheese?"" What is this? But seriously, there was a MOUND of cheese on top of the omelette. He couldn't taste anything else, he said. I got the tocino with 2 eggs and the garlic basmati rice. I hadn't ever had tocino before; it was like thick-cut bacon, only with more fat. It was also electric hot pink, and tasted like it had been simmered in maple syrup. I think I only got maybe a couple ounces of real meat off what I was served. Maybe you're supposed to eat the fat? Immaterial, as I always trim my meat. Oh, well. The garlic rice was just that: sauteed garlic and rice. The garlic was gone for the most part, meaning, it was bitter and acrid-smelling. It permeated the rice, which just didn't do it for me, texturally.  The fruit plate we split was delcious, even with the canned peaches. I happily buttered my toast with the butter tabs provided on the table and then slathered on some cherry jelly (as I don't believe I'd ever had cherry jelly), but upon lifting the slice of toast to my mouth, I discovered that the kitchen had already buttered the bread between the pieces, i.e. on the bottom of the slice I'd just buttered with the stuff from the table. Why have butter on the table if the kitchen butters the bread for you? Oh, well.  We went up to pay at the register just before a guy came in the front door for a pick up. My companion stood in front of the lady (proprietress?), bill and card in hard, and she looked at the guy walking over and said, ""pick up?"" The guy stammered yes, but then gestered to us. The woman flicked her wrist dismissively at us before handing the guy a bag of food and taking his payment. So I guess we didn't matter. Okay.  We left full, but not necessarily happy. This place isn't as far as my de facto Sunday morning brunch companion and I have gone for brunch, but I don't think we'll be adding it to the rotation. I had hoped that maybe the Filipino side of the place would have given the menu more character, but in actuality, the Filipino dishes were actually quite few. The slightly high-ish prices for the menu items can be justified with proper execution, which was unfortunately lacking. I was disappointed with how this went down.",0.978,0.869,0.085,0.046,0.5225412387177094

2008-10-03,4.0,"I wanted to try this place due to the recommendation of my roommate. She told me that they served Filipino breakfast.  Being the terrible Filipino I am, I had no idea what that meant, and had to find out. The two menu items in question were the Loganiza and Tocino.  I have never had either, and chose the Tocino.  Our food came quickly enough, and I was pleased to see a large pile of meat on my plate next to the eggs and garlic fried rice.  I have never had garlic fried rice either, and I was surprised at the pungency of it, but I think it worked well with the Tocino, which was carmelised and sweet.   I will definitely be back.",0.8735,0.859,0.111,0.03,0.5392857142857143

2008-08-07,3.0,"I didn't think this place was anything special. After being told that their meat delivery did not come that morning (although disappointing, it encouraged me to think that they get fresh meat,) our options were limited. I got the Santa Fe omelet, which was good, as were  the home fries...but, if you mess that up then your breakfast license should be revoked. I was looking forward to something different like the fillipino stuff mentioned, but there was none of that. Also, I would have gotten the marinated steak, but I had steak last night.  Given the options (read: its a diner) and the quality I would say 4 or 5 stars, but the price doesn't seem to go with it...it ended up being $20 for 2 omelets and 2 waters and for a place like this I expected cheaper.",0.7096,0.87,0.091,0.039,0.4173280423280423

2008-02-26,5.0,"I grew up just north of Uncle Mike's, and this spot's been been a second home to me since leaving Chicago. I've brought my entire family here; Sunday brunch is tradition among my friends. - There's always (street) parking. It does get busy, but I've never had trouble getting a table. - Mom, who's picky about her coffee, always has at least four cups. - Large servings whether at 5:30am or 3:30pm. - The marinated skirt steak is a must. If you're a fan of Filipino Tocino, and its combo, Tocilog, ask for garlic fried rice and eggs. There's some debate over whether you actually get more meat with a half-skirt or a full-skirt (width vs. length), but I always order the full. I was a steak and eggs regular prior to learning of the marinated skirt steak. - My nice and nephew love the pancakes and went nutty over the (large) fruit plate. Finally, you can't go wrong with a place that's been servicing the community for about a century (as I've heard it--a diner since WWII and before that, a general store). It has survived every other diner spot on Grand from Ashland to the Patch, and remains a true working  class mom-n-pop establishment.",0.9871,0.844,0.156,0.0,0.48170329670329676

Uncle Mikes sold out and raised their prices big-time!  New menus, fancy website and fancy prices.  Omlettes are $2.50 more to start... if I want those kinds of prices I'd just hit up Dodo or Milk & Honey.  Part of the appeal here was the value - good, cheap breakfast eats and locals.  I don't think any true locals will be coming here much anymore... too bad.  I guess it was the rising popularity and yuppies like me looking for a deal that drove them over the edge. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great spot, totally local.  Off the beaten path of West Town.  We found it walking one morning and finally had a chance to head back for breakfast.  Took a take-out menu and want to try some lunch one day.  Deffinately not a trendy spot like some down the road or on Chicago but that is good; greasy spoon type place with college hungry prices.  We both had fresh, big omlettes, coffee and some free soup for $19.  That is hard value to find.  Def. will become a regular spot for us.",0.9641,0.806,0.156,0.038,0.4891618104118104
