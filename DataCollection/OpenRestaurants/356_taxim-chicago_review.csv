The restaurant was capable of catering to my friend's pretty complex dietary restrictions with grace and deliciousness, as my other friend and I enjoyed the classics straight off the menu. Only wrinkle was momentary harassment by homeless person walking by, and that was not long lived. They also have a roof top dining area, which would have been perfect, but was already fully booked.",0.9136,0.754,0.222,0.024,0.6232142857142858
2017-08-28,5.0,I LOVE this place. Don't be intimidated by the unique and foreign menu. There's a lot of Greek but the food is familiar and not too adventurous. The lamb kebabs are always a group hit. I like their wine selection and I really enjoyed the shrimp grape leaves (just be warned they're a little spicy!) My brother in law wanted an Irish coffee and instructed them how to make it and they were troopers! It wasn't even on the menu!,0.8584,0.783,0.157,0.06,0.48055555555555557
2017-08-24,2.0,"Yikes, the service was so so bad. The food was quite good once it finally arrived, but it was like pulling teeth to get it, or even get anyone to come to our table. It was empty when we went for brunch on a Sunday morning around 11am, which should have indicated something. We did sit on the rooftop terrace, which was beautiful. We ordered a variety of brunch dishes, including a side of fruit. I saw the table next to us with a beautiful plate of fresh figs, so I asked the waitress if we could get the same thing as an appetizer. She didn't know what all was on the fruit plate listed on the menu (despite carrying it out minutes earlier for the other table), so I pointed and she confirmed it was the same dish, that we could get it as an appetizer. I ordered the Kayiannas, a veggie scramble. I got it with the potatoes. Fast forward to 30 minutes later and the fruit shows up. 30 minutes to cut up a small plate of fruit? Eventually, yes, our food did show up. It felt like an hour, but it was probably closer to 45 minutes. The food tasted amazing. I did ask for ketchup, then hot sauce, both of which they didn't have. The food runner also said they didn't have ""any sauces,"" so I asked for the red pepper sauce that was on my friend's plate. He brought some, about 10 minutes later. We were eventually able to get the check (another 10-15 minute wait) and get out of there, but not without an active search for the waitress.",0.9811,0.859,0.114,0.027,0.5166666666666666

I wasn't too crazy about their hummus, and a lot of the food was really salty causing some heartburn later. I ordered the duck gyro, and it came out deep fried. Was not expecting that all, creative and tasty, but if you're wanting a real gyro do not order this item.  The desserts are to die for! We all shared their donuts which literally melt in your mouth.

2017-08-19,1.0,"Can't say enough about the views, great rooftop, but the service was so beyond terrible it pretty much ruins the dining experience.  Food was ok. First, one of my biggest issues with restaurants is when they force you to place your entire order all at once telling you they will portion it out.  It's usually a way for them to rush you through the meal to turn tables faster.  However, we had even a worse case when our group of 6 all had our entrees come out 5-10 minutes apart.  Nothing like going to dinner with other couples only to eat separately or cold food. We told our waitress and she didn't care. Second issue is the terrible service and then automatically having a generous tip included for you.   Third is when we mentioned the experience and issue we had with service to manager upon leaving he just said yeah they are short staffed and nothing beyond that.  THATS NOT A GOOD EXCUSE when running a restaurant.   Won't ever be back - poor service kills restaurants, don't put up or support it",-0.0716,0.724,0.142,0.134,0.5087301587301587

Before you think anything, it wasn't what you think.  First, the beet salad was thinly sliced (hoping for a bigger portion) with a garlic sauce around it.  The garlic flavor wasn't strong, and almost had a hummus texture.  It was excellent.  The duck gyros was unlike what I have ever had.  They season the duck gyros similar to a regular gyros without ruining its texture.  They then wrap it in a phyllo dough, so it kind of looks like a greek egg roll (and almost feels like it, too).  They have a great Greek wine selection and it was very enjoyable. I had a Sauvignon Blanc from Greece and it was a clean and crisp wine.

Hummus - nothing bad to say, nothing good though. We arrived early and they had just opened not long prior so I suspect it was still cool from the fridge to showcase any acid flavor.  Baba ghanoush - just as cold as the hummus but damned flavorful. I could taste balsamic vinegar I think - probably from the roasting of the eggplant. I would get this again without pause.  Fried cauliflower- we like cauliflower but the other yelp pics and mentions made us know we had to try it. It's very good.

They have small plates up there and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. They get huge points for serving sage tea, which I fell in love with in Turkey (it's awesome, try it) and haven't seen much of it in the US at any restaurants. Their cocktails have some thought put into them and are executed pretty well. For anyone looking for a good rooftop when it's nice out, I'd definitely recommend this.

We chose the former and had the chance to sample a fair number of Taxim's offerings -- my two favorites were the black lentils and the okra -- the flatbreads are tasty though a bit salty and very heavy.  The shrimp and hot peppers pack some serious heat.  And the beet salad is a good stand-by to have something healthy, crunchy, and clean tasting.

2016-06-01,4.0,"We had reservations at this lovely Greek restaurant on a Saturday night. We were seated right at our reservation time. The restaurant was very busy; they also have a rooftop dining area, but we were told there was a long wait for an outdoor table. I'm not sure if you can request outdoor when you make your reservation. The restaurant has definitely maximized their seating by lining the tables up sided by side down the middle of the dining room, with only about two inches between each table. Hope that you get to sit next to someone interesting! Not the venue for a romantic date. Another problem with the seating is that the server has to stand behind you to talk to you.  Once we got comfortable with the seating we tackled the wine list - how cool, it's all Greek wines and they are all very reasonable...so wine it was! The server was awesome at guiding us to a wonderful bottle of wine. We ordered an appetizer with the wine, a baba ganoush type dish, made with eggplant and served with pita. It was yummy! We decided on five additional small plates and one entree to share between the four of us. This was the perfect amount of food. Our entree was duck, which was amazing. Other small plate favorites were the okra and the calamari. Not such a favorite, the fried cauliflower, not bad, it was just kind of boring. We enjoyed our food and our wine, the only reason for deducting a star is because of the service. Our food took FOREVER to arrive. And to top it off our server never came by to apologize or tell us the kitchen was slammed or anything. Luckily good wine and good company and then good food, when it finally started to arrive 65 minutes later, made for a nice 4 star evening.",0.9979,0.719,0.244,0.037,0.5985938135938137

We're generally not big fans of Greek food, having spent time (and even my husband living there) but after hearing such rave reviews, we made a rare(ish) trek down to Wicker Park to give it a shot.  The goods: the decor is beautiful and very reminiscent of the Greece we know. The tzatziki was amazing, as was the fried cauliflower and braised lamb shank. The wine list is extensive and that which we ordered was flavorful and robust. The service was also great.  Now to the bads: the artichoke and fingering potato dish. I wanted it to have so much more flavor and it was just too much olive oil which made it unenjoyable. The duck gyro was just, what? The duck was overcooked and dry, we wanted the soft pita and got fried pastry instead. THE PRICES. I know WP has gotten pricey lately, but this place was an expensive meal given some of the options in the area.

I'm not a fan of the bench with too many overstuffed pillows. Its awkward for everyone, they slide around, the person seated last has to deal with all of the extras. We arrived a little early thinking we could hang at the bar and have a drink. Good thing they were empty and could seat us right away because there really isn't a bar to hang at. The service was just ok. She explained a number of dishes to us, and came around from time to time. She did take a plate that still had food on it without asking if we were finished. That is one of my pet peeves at a restaurant. I had a glass of wine that was ok. My boyfriend tried one of the Greek beers and it was outstanding. It was the darker beer of the two and was like delicious coffee.  To eat we had olives which were eh. A lot of them were bitter or really sour. I was on my own with them as my boyfriend only sort of likes olives. He likes them when the brine is tame and with nice flavors like citrus. The pickles were just a few peppers and I think okra. It was 90% olives. We had their version of hummus but it was called something else. It was very expensive for what you get. We liked the pita that it came with.  We also tried the pastry. If it hadn't been served with the house-made feta then it would have been just a boring, but nice, pastry. The cheese was the star.  The fried cauliflower was great however they were really stingy with the cheese. If they had doubled what they gave us then it would be outstanding. As it was the plain friend cauliflower was nice but dry.  The octopus was the star of the night. That was delicious. Wonderful flavors, perfectly cooked. By the time we ate all of these dishes we were kind of ready to go. It didn't feel celebratory so we decided to go somewhere else for dessert.

2015-09-05,1.0,"Let me preface with I am not one to write a poor review unless it's absolutely warranted. That said, my experience at Taxim was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had at any Chicago restaurant after dining in this city for 8 years.  Why was it bad? The service.  Our party of 7 on the rooftop had a server that had to be called over to even order drinks, ask for menus, and fix a very wobbly table. It took 45 minutes for us to order and receive a round of drinks and then finally put in our dinner order. The waiter was flustered and a poor communicator when trying to order. Once we finally ordered, our 1st appetizer came out 30 minutes later. It was okay, I've had better hummus and pita from the grocery store.  It's now been an hour and a half since we arrived and we've still only had 1 appetizer and a couple rounds of drinks. Our inattentive waiter comes over and asks if we're ready for the check. What!?!? We've only received one app and are still waiting on salads, skewers, and our main courses!  We asked for the manager at this point as its 10pm, we're hungry and clearly our waiter has no idea what's going on with our order. The manager comes over and he's just as poor of a communicator as the waiter. Tells us the kitchen lost our ticket, they'll comp us some food and then storms off as we're still talking to him.  We wait another 10mins. At this point we've decided we're going to find dinner elsewhere and tell the waiter to just cancel our order and bring the check.  We wait 10mins. The bus staff and waiter come out with plates of skewers after we had already  said to cancel the order and bring the check. We tell him we do not want this food and just want to leave. He YELLS at us and says THIS IS FROM THE CHEF! Great, we're not eating it and please bring us our check.  We wait as we watch the waiter and manager fiddle with the POS system. Instead of causing a scene back at our table, I walk up to them and kindly ask for the check there and reason with them that we should at the very least get some of our drinks or the 1 appetizer comped. They agreed and print out a check. The check has ALL OF OUR FOOD THAT WE NEVER RECEIVED ON IT. I hand it back and say no I'm sorry we're not paying for this and they say oops we printed the wrong one. Next try, the check has ALL OF OUR DRINKS ON IT AND 18% GRATUITY INCLUDED.  I say I'm sorry please remove the grat and comp some of the drinks. Next try, he prints off a check with all the food on it and no grat. Nope. After the 4th attempt at printing off a viable check we had made up our minds this place was a joke and we are leaving. The manager says loudly YOU DONT HAVE TO PAY and we left so quickly as the thought of being in that place 1 second longer made me sick.  In summary, the service was so poor that even if the food we never received was the most delicious Greek food in the world, I would still never return to Taxim. I will in fact recommend against going there if I ever hear someone speaking about it.  Get your act together, Taxim.

After almost three years living in the burbs with minimal visits into the city as of late, I am out of touch with the trendy, posh filled restaurants of Milwaukee Ave in Wicker Park.  We enter, they have a rooftop and we decide to sit up there b/c it's a nice summer night. Turns out the upstairs has a different name, and therefore a different menu than the one we looked at before coming here. Yeesh, had to go downstairs again. Luckily, the dining room is beautiful with the high ceilings and nice ambient lighting. Still though, wt...? The highlight of the meal was the octopus. I have NEVER had octopus that isn't the slightest bit rubbery in texture until trying this dish. The octopus was tender, the onion was an amazing compliment to the sauce that was used. A+ I would come back for this dish alone. In fact, this dish alone is the reason Taxim gets three stars.  The rest is downhill. Our waitress was a beautiful and well spoken woman, but when we asked what she recommended, we got a robotic description of a few menu items without an inkling of excitement or notion that she had even tried the dishes. As a former server, I LOVED it when people asked for recommendations!! This didn't seem to be the case on this evening. I decided on the duck gyros based on Yelp. This is a weird dish to me, as it resembles absolutely nothing to that of a gyros sandwich from the bread to the meat. It was duck meat rolled up into egg roll form, cut into four pieces and placed on top of a lake of tzatziki sauce. Too much sauce, the sauce was heavy on the cucumber/pickle flavor and it overpowered the dish. The Pontian Satz ""bread"" was like phyllo dough.  My buddy scored the winning dish with the lamb chop dish. I was able to try some and thought it was good enough to possibly get me to come back here, along with that octopus.",0.9901,0.849,0.13,0.021,0.6071666666666666

2015-08-13,4.0,"Best take on Greek food I've found in Chicago! Like I've said before I'm no expert on Greek food, but I do consider this a unique, fresh take on Greek food. We were really torn between 3-4 stars (AKA my boyfriend remembered a 3-star experience and I remember a 4-star experience)!  The ambience is really nice, but in order to fully experience it, I would recommend sitting in the back of the restaurant. Otherwise, you are seated at the front window having every passerby on Milwaukee watch you eat your meal..  We decided to stick with smaller plate options to share. We ordered 5, which was 1-2 too many, which is a common theme between that my boyfriend and inexperience.  Veggies- we got the eggplant served with pita. It's served cold which was surprising but it was perfect and the flavored were all great. This was one of my favorite dishes!  Small plates - fried cauliflower was meh. I wasn't too impressed. Lamb kebabs were ok, nothing special. I really think I prefer gyro meat over kebabs. Octopus was tasty, but I always think octopus is served too salty. The pork belly was surprisingly the best small plate we ordered, huge fan!",0.9902,0.707,0.223,0.07,0.5200549450549451

2015-08-10,4.0,"Dinner at Taxim was fantastic! Had an 8:30 reservation on Friday night and they seated us right away. The interior is quite lovely and not what I expected (just based on the years of walking by and seeing the deli style counter at the front). The decor is very true to mediterranean restaurants and reminiscent of my trips to Greece and Turkey. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. She recommended their driest rose (the Akakies), which is also available by the glass and went especially well with the phyllo cheese plate. For food, we decided to go with an assortment of small plates rather than traditional entrees.  Hummus--what everyone says is true: you don't expect something as basic as hummus to be noteworthy, but theirs is great! I loved the lemon flavor. The house made pita bread is really good as well.  Baby okra--a nice veg option Prassopita--SO tasty! I could have easily eaten two of these phyllo pastries. You can definitely taste the dill (so if that's not your thing, beware) and the goat feta was delicious.  Fried cauliflower--flavorful and not greasy Fried beer battered mussels--I don't remember much about this one. It was just ok and we probably could have just skipped it. Ground lamb--I'm not big on lamb, but I really liked this. The spices and yogurt blended really well.  Loukoumades--I don't think you can ever go wrong with fried donuts. You get 4 of them in the order and they're all a decent size. We actually only split one and took the rest home because we were so full.   After paying, we took the rest of our wine upstairs to their newly opened rooftop. We actually wanted to eat dinner up there to begin with, but they serve a different, limited menu up there. That was really the biggest bummer of the evening. Not sure if this is a business decision or something with permits because the rooftop isn't really so far away that they couldn't carry the orders from downstairs. Anyway, I loved the rooftop space! It pretty much spans the whole roof so there are a lot of tables, a separate bar, a loungey seating area, and you don't really hear much of the Milwaukee Ave noise. All they need to do to spiff it up a bit more is string some market lights around. You could definitely stop by just for apps and drinks.  Overall, I really enjoyed the ambiance and food at Taxim. It would easily please anyone: date, family, group of friends. Definitely great for groups. Pricing was fair.",0.998,0.758,0.206,0.035,0.5895067821067821

2015-05-17,1.0,"A great disappointment We had friends in from Dallas for the Restaurant Show, and I was searching for a neighborhood gem. Past reviews of Taxim were strong, and the menu was diverse and interesting. We were greeted immediately upon arrival, and was offered a table that was suitable, although it did not meet our Open Table request. The noise was deafening. The room is all hard surfaces without so much as a curtain or upholstered seat to absorb the noise. The owners need to rethink that aspect of the decor as a conversation was difficult if not impossible to maintain.  The menu was as presented on line, but the execution certainly did not match the online reviews. Each plate seemed skimpy or full of fillers. For instance, the heirloom tomato salad with feta (Greek salad) had tomatos that were under ripe and sliced paper thin. The sardine small plate which was voted ""taste of the year"" was full of lettuce and we could barely find the sardines - not white and a few very small pieces. The artichoke item was full of potatoes with few artichoke slices, and although tasty, was not satisfying if one was looking forward to artichokes. The duck gyros, although tasty, came with a plate full of fries. . . once again, more fries than duck. I will say that the bottle of wine we ordered was the best item of the evening. The service was very slow, to the point of cancelling the dessert we ordered. It took 2+ hours to eat, and we found ourselves constantly waiting for the next plate to be brought out. This was an embarrassment as we had hoped for a more memorable experience to share with our restaurateur friend. I cannot recommend Taxim",0.9172,0.845,0.095,0.06,0.4881175595238096

The interior of Taxim was probably the best surprise of the evening. It's a beautiful and well-decorated space. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant and the atmosphere was great. Our waitress came over right away and helped us navigate the wine menu. None of us were familiar with the Greek wines on the menu, but she helped us select a Pinot Grigio-esque bottle that was very delicious and under $30! When it came to ordering, we decided to share multiple plates. There were a bunch of items we were debating between and our waitress was helpful in recommending some. First, Taxim makes all of their own phyllo and it's awesome. We particularly enjoyed the one with dill and goat feta. The squash fritters (kind of like falafel), roasted eggplant, grilled octopus and fried cauliflower were all incredibly flavorful and well cooked. These dishes were also easy to share which worked well for our group. We also ordered items in waves which was really nice. When we were still hungry or wanted to try something new, our waitress was there to grab our order. The only entree we tried was the duck gyro and it rocked. This is definitely not your typical gyro, but it was incredibly flavorful and rich. It was actually great to share, large portion and came with a ton of tasty duck fries.  Overall, Taxim exceeded my expectations in every way. The decor was beautiful, wine reasonably priced, service attentive, and every dish we tried was delicious.

Was a little disappointed they didn't have traditional baklava for dessert.  The closest thing is the Saraglí me stáka Krítis, but by that point I wasn't interested anymore.",0.9281,0.855,0.103,0.042,0.5635531135531135

2014-07-04,2.0,"While the appetizers were good, they were tiny. It felt very stingy. We ordered fish for our main meal. It was seasoned well, but it was not clean on the inside. My boyfriend is from Turkey and he eats whole fish all the time. He immediately knew that the fish was improperly cleaned such that there was dried blood all over the inside that made the fish bitter. While we were displeased with the cleanliness of the fish, we were more displeased with the way the waitress handled the situation. When we told her about the fish, she asked us if she should consult the owner. After consulting the owner, she asked us if we wanted a new fish, but since we had somewhere else to be soon, we said no, but my boyfriend wanted to show the waitress what dirty fish looks like as a favor to the restaurant, so they make sure the fish is clean in the future, and as he was opening up the fish to show her, she literally just walked away. I was stunned.... it seemed like she really did not care about the customer. I was sure they were going to compensate us somehow since we did not eat half of our fish and we did not take them up on their offer to get a new one. Disappointingly, they charged us for everything, including the coffee and dessert. Overall, the restaurant felt very stingy. This is not how a professional business should deal with their mistake. Honestly, if the waitress had given us something for free as a apologetic gesture, we probably would have come back. If you are looking for an authentic Greek/ Mediterranean dinner, just go to Greek town.

The arugula salad, though, was almost inedible because of the amount of salt on the salad! On the description it sounded kind of like the Middle Eastern fattoush. It was obviously their twist on it, just WAY TOO MUCH salt ! We got the lamb chops and chicken. The lamb chops were delicious. The chicken had a great crunch to it and the potatoes were great. But again. A super heavy hand with the salt. I ended up drinking more water than the wine I ordered because of how salty all my items were. Boo. I was looking forward to a nice buzz with my meal!

My favorite dish from the ""Salads and Vegetables"" section of the menu is the Fakés Kas. Fróssos - lentils with house made feta and a balsamic reduction.  The acidity of the vinegar balances the lentils perfectly, and the feta is unbelievable.   In the small plates section, you must try the fried cauliflower with capers and the wood grilled octopus with fennel.  The octopus is charred nicely and I love the crispy ends.  If you're being adventurous, get the ouzo (an anis flavored apertif) that is paired with the octopus.   For entrees, you cannot go wrong with either of the lamb dishes**.  The duck gyro is also delicious, but it is a bit underwhelming in comparison to the ridiculously good lamb dishes.   Overall, if you're looking to have a wonderful and authentic Greek/Mediterranean experience, Taxim is your place.  If you've been on the fence about visiting Taxim or simply haven't gotten around to it yet, Taxim should shoot to the top of your list. **I was watching TV the other day and my Tivo changed the channel to record an old episode of Iron Chef.  The Chef of Taxim, David Schneider, was the challenger at kitchen stadium!  I know, I know, it's old news, but I thought it was cool.  The secret ingredient was lamb, and the judges went nuts over his main entree.  This chef knows lamb.",0.9956,0.779,0.195,0.026,0.6389211309523809

I rarely complain about portion size but Taxim needs a reality check. For prices in the $9-12 range, there should be more than they give you. The spinach and phyllo pastry appetizer is literally the size of a dinner roll and it was $10. Give me a break.  As a side note, they brought out a plate of something (I think feta and olives? Or yogurt and olives) on the house. We also didn't have to pay for the long-ass hair that came out of said yogurt.

The waitress went down a list of several items that were NOT available (about 5) and when we asked for suggestions she basically just read the menu to us. We ended up ordering the beet salad, fried cauliflower, and the fish gyro to share. The beat salad was just OK for me. The fried cauliflower was not good at all. It was very salty and greasy almost. Not to mention the fact that the pieces were so small (and so little of them) it just tasted like fried batter. The fish gyro was PHENOMENAL. I was expecting perhaps something on the side besides a few scatter chips for the price point...definitely not worth $20. They did this weird thing where they took our plates away before the gyro came which would be fine except that we were still eating off of them. It was odd. Decor is great, it's very cozy and of course the location is perfect. Though it does seem overpriced, I am willing to give it another shot when some of the items I actually wanted to try are available.",0.9311,0.851,0.104,0.045,0.47208994708994706
2013-09-30,5.0,"Like so many other Yelpers have said, this is terrific, authentic Greek food.  Greek food with the chef's personality showing through.     The setting was excellent, not too formal, very Greek, very welcoming and relaxing.  With good table spacing. We shared a wood-roasted eggplant dish, revithia, and a xoriatiki salad.  Each are standard Greek dishes, but these were a bit more - fresher and more flavorful.  The pita bread served with the dishes was outstanding, light and fresh and warm. Based on all the raves from Yelp Friends, I had to go with the duck gyro.  It was all everyone said it would be, a truly unique duck dish (for me).  I already know it'll be all I order whenever we go back - forget the rest of the menu! I was less than excited about the chocolate halva dessert.  Next time I'll skip dessert to finish my duck gyro, although taking one section home for a later lunch worked out great.   They had a good assortments of excellent Greek wines.  I noticed a number of reviews unimpressed with the service.  Ours was fine, although we were with good friends and in no hurry to be gone, so if it was slow we didn't notice.   Definitely our #1 Greek restaurant in Chicago now.",0.9923,0.688,0.248,0.064,0.4353535353535354
2013-09-29,3.0,"Taxim gets 3 stars instead of 4, because of the noise. It is such a loud and noisy place that turns its 4.5 star food into a 3-star dinning experience. The food is outstanding and creative. In fact the food concept is awesome: small dishes similar to spanish tapas; Greeks call them mezedes. The food tastes fantastic. The smoked eggplant salad is outstanding. The kokoretsi, though not authentic, is a pleasant diversion. The pork belly is very well seasoned. The wine list is remarkable and showcases small, boutique wineries from Greece. But the noise, oh the noise. The music is very loud to begin with. That forces the patrons to keep their voices raised. The dinning room is acoustically bright, amplifying the ambient noise. If Taxim's management figures a way to tone down the loud noise in the dinning room, Taxim will be one of the best eateries in town where a couple may hold a conversation while enjoying their delicious dishes.",0.9886,0.767,0.209,0.024,0.65024154589372

Since parking is tough in the area, people from our party were running late, so our waitress tok forever to come over just to take a drink order and later our food order. For drinks, the waitress suggested a greek white wine which was great. My boyfriend had the Hibiscus cooler drink which was really light and great. Some friends were drinking cocktails and they really enjoyed them. When we finally got to order our food, they said they were out of the fish gyros and shrimp appetizer which a lot of us wanted to order. I had read other reviews about them running out of items, and that was pretty annoying. The cauliflower appetizer is awesome though. I also had some of my friends lamb kabob starter- the lamb was awesome with such a rich flavor.

2013-09-01,3.0,"I was really looking forward to going here after watching the rave reviews on ""Check Please"" and as a lover of authentic Greek food, I was even more excited.   I would say that it is average among the Greek restaurants I've been too, and here's why 1)  Service, very good, the best part of the evening. 2)  Comfort, not so good.  Booths and chairs are a bit too hard to sit on for extended periods, and the pillows are not much help. 3)  Atmosphere - really lovely place, although it was a bit too loud and dark. 4)  Food.  Now the most important part of any restaurant is the food, and I am an avid cook because I love good food.  I just find many restaurants to be a little too hyped and the meal is not the true quality of what I'm used to.   Appetizers were the eggplant spread, the shrimp filled grape leaves, and the wood grilled octopus.  The eggplant spread was just ""okay"" and the bread it came with wasn't even warm, or tasted homemade, which is what I would expect from such a place.  However the dolmades were terrible.  I don't understand the point of wrapping a shrimp in a grape leaf.  The leaf was just the exterior to a very overcooked, hard, rubbery shrimp that had way too much salt.  I am a genuine believer of properly salting food, and I use ample salt myself, but this was just way too much.  Four shrimp, for ten dollars, and they weren't even tender or tasty.   The wood grilled octopus was awesome though.  Very tender, melt in your mouth flavor, with just the right amount of seasoning, spices and wood grilled flavor.  My only complaint is that the portion size is tiny, especially for the price.  You mostly get onions and fennel for that price.   Next, the entrees. I had the duck gyro, and honestly, I don't understand all the rave reviews about it, unless I came on a bad night.  My duck was very dry, overcooked, rubbery, and it sat on top of a thick pasty yogurt sauce with a tiny bit of the pomegranate marinade.  I've seen this dish presented on ""Check Please"" with more pomegranate marinade.  It looks like I got the leftovers from the spit they cooked this on, like some dried out gyro meat you would get at a corner dive.  I also thought there was way too much cumin in the flavor.  I don't mind cumin, but it is a strong spice, and I felt that's all I tasted,. Honestly, it was like eating shards of dried out cumin jerky.  The duck fries were also a bit soggy, and I think they were sitting out a while. My husband had the chicken dish, and it was tender, moist, juicy and flavorful with the right amount of seasoning and spices.  I wanted to switch orders with him. We had the chocolate semolina halva desert, and it was good except for the super sour kumquats on top.  Now I understand perhaps the chef wanted to put something sour with something sweet, but they were just poorly paired.  We scooped them off and finished the cake, which was moist and rich.  The marscapone had a sour flavor too, and I'm not sure why.  In any case, I don't like sour with my sweets, so that was not a win for me either.   They also don't serve cream with coffee, but milk instead, which was odd.  I am used to cream, and I had to pour a lot in my coffee to get it somewhat acceptable for my liking.  Therefore, I surmised it was just milk, and not even whole milk.  I could be wrong there, but it was unusual ""cream.""  My husband loved his drinks, and since I don't drink, there was nothing for me to say in that regard.   Therefore, the evening was average, but barely acceptable.  The server was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu as well.  I don't know if I'll be back, but that octopus is the only reason I will be.  It was heavenly.  I wish they would make it into an entree.",0.9981,0.802,0.157,0.041,0.5355664682539681

The food was great, and light, which embodied the eastern Mediterranean basin's food culture.  The service, however, was mediocre. From the moment we walked in, to the moment we stepped out, we were beyond dissatisfied with the staff. We had reservations for 8 made on Mother's Day, and when we walked in five minutes before our reservation, we were stared down and told we would have to wait for our table to get prepared. We waited, without any acknowledgement, and alas, almost 25 minutes later, in a merely empty restaurant, we were POINTED in the direction of our table. Disgusting. The staff (waiters/receptionist/busboy) all spoke in Spanish amongst one another, and in front of us as we tried to order off the menu. As we asked questions, they would confer with one another in Spanish. Awkward.  The water/table-cloths/utensils were the hardest to get a hold of. When a table takes 30 minutes past reservation time to get prepared, you certainly are expecting-at least- the necessities to already be properly placed. Overall, the food was delectable, and the crowd was very nice.

2013-08-14,5.0,"In my life I've had a lot of experience with Greek food, from Athens and Piraeus, to the mountain villages and islands, and every stop in between. I won't harp on about ""oh, I'm so Greek..."" yadda yadda yadda, I've just spent a large part of my life in the country.  So when I came to Chicago years ago, and everyone boasted about Greektown, I went. I was thoroughly disappointed with the food (stop lighting saganaki on fire and yelling ""opa!,"" too, we all know its cheap cheese covered in booze to get rid of the poor flavor) and wine selection.  Since then, I found fantastic Greek food in a traditional sense in Mythos on Montrose, but I wanted to find a fancier Greek place I could take my friends for traditional, fresh Greek food.   Taxim is that place.  I went a little crazy on the menu, so bare with me. We went through about 9/20 things offered on the top of the menu, with some highlights being the roasted beets, the fried peppers, the lamp shoulder with grilled cherries, the sausage, the shrimp wrapped in grape leaves, and the octopus. Mostly everything was outstanding, but the two highlights, far above the rest were (surprisingly) the octopus and the shrimp.  First off, the thought of octopus THIS good in the Midwest was beyond me. It was tender, like it had been marinating forever, it was fresh, it was...most likely some of the BEST octopus I've ever had in my life. And I was in the Midwest...what the hell?  The shrimp, grilled in fresh grape leaves were juicy, and sweet. The quality of the seafood amazed me. A nice vegetarian dish would be the fried peppers; sweet, spicy, dry on the outside, bursting with flavor on the inside... fantastic. Also the xoriatiki was a nice taste of home. Bottom half of the menu, the mains; only half of us still had room to proceed. So many things to try but we kept it traditional with the sourvlaki and yuvetsi.  I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon in my yuvesti, its just never been my thing, although the amount in this really complemented the dish. The lamb was falling off the shank, and was done perfectly.  My buddy who got the souvlaki let me try, and the meat was cooked perfectly, plenty of oregano, plenty of lemon.  The fries were also crisp, and well flavored.  Going back, I'll have to try the tsipouro sea bass. Deserts: Well, we weren't going to stick around, but the rain came, so we did.  Unfortunately we missed the last piece of boughatsa, which was sad. This guy loves him some boughatsa. We decided on the loukamades, and unfortunately I found them a bit dense. They were sat in a cream with honey and cinnamon, but they were thick, and heavy, instead of being smaller and lighter. They were, however, delicious.  There were a ton of cookies I wanted to try too, next time.  Alcohol: They have tsipouro, which I recommend for anyone and everyone. It's not as sweet as ouzo, not cloudy with ice and water, and easily goes down.  They also have mavrodaphne.   Wine: This is honestly  1/2 the reason I really wanted to come here, unfortunately at the time they didn't have the wine I really wanted (listed on the website, wasn't in stock that day, gotta love daily wine lists!), but there were plenty of other Greek varieties, both red and white.  I prefer Malagousia to Assyrtiko, and there around 4-6 of each. They also had a sparkling moscofilero which the girls loved.  On the reds, you have your Xinomavros (including the higher end Boutaris), agriorgitikos, and other varietals, with a lot more options than the white. Here's where I sound like a pompous jerk: This place had the most Greek wines I've ever seen on a menu, besides Avra in New York...where I worked as a bartender.  Good - The service is fantastic, the wine list is amazing (you WON'T find a better Greek wine list almost anywhere), the seafood tastes like it was fresh out the sea, the spices are true to Greek culture, they're small/local farm when they can, the bathrooms are clean, they update menus daily, they run out of things (meaning its made in limited quantities, which is a GOOD thing), and they have tsiprouro.   I really wish I could use their wine distributor for personal use. Bad - The bad at this place happened to be all things I personally wanted, I feel it doesn't reflect on Taxim, but I can't have a good above, without a corresponding bad. They didn't have kokoretsi the day I went, and homeboy loves him some lamb guts. The loukamades may have been a bit big and a bit dense.

We ventured to Taxim this past weekend after seeing it on a recent episode of Check Please.  The videographer (or whatever they may be called) did an amazing job of making this place look GINORMO.  It is not.  It is quite small. We arrived early, as we always do, and planned to sit at the bar for a couple of drinks before dinner.  There is a bar, but no seating and it would just be awkward to kind of stand and hang out....not really that kind of set up.  So, we ran across the street for a pre dinner drink and then popped back over in time for our reservations. The hostesses at the front were super nice and friendly and sat us right away.  The waitress we were assigned was super nice and very informative for us newbies.  We opted to start with a drink a piece, Fakes Kas. Frossos (lentils), and the Htapodaki sti schara (grilled octopus).  The lentils came and I thought they were delicious.  My husBAND is not a lentils fan so I basically ate them all myself.  The octupus still had not arrived by the time I finished the lentils.  Weird.  We then both ordered the braised lamb shank.  Our entrees arrived and the octopus still had not arrived.  We let the food runner know who went and alerted our waitress.  She came over and explained that the particular station that handled the octopus had gotten backed up.  No worries.  We ate our entrees...which were very good.  The octupus appetizer still had not arrived.  They came by to clear our plates and another waitress/hostess asked if we wanted a dessert menu and another drink.  This was exactly 1 hour into our dinner.  This was the first time anyone asked us if we wanted a 2nd drink...also we had to inform her that we were still waiting on our appetizer so we would skip the dessert.  The octopus finally arrived and was super freaking delicious.  Our waitress did have the octopus removed from our bill which was very nice of her considering we devoured it. So, in summary, this is not a destination restaurant where one might opt to spend multiple hours hanging out with friends and chatting, drinking, and eating the night away.  It is, however, a restaurant with VERY good food.  The service seemed a bit off the night we were there, but I wouldn't say it was bad...just kinda slow.  We will definitely venture back in, but will come during a time when it's not a rush dinner time.",0.9967,0.79,0.163,0.047,0.5390537240537241

I not only enjoyed the food, but also the great service from the attentive waiter who explained ingredients and Greek words and made excellent wine suggestions. I was in a party of three and we had: Two Salates kai Ladera (Salads and Vegetables): - Pantzaria me karydoskordalia- roasted beets with greens, Thracian-style walnut skordalia, feta.  ---The walnut skordalia was a type of puree that perfectly accented the bright, sweet beets. - Nerokardamo kai seskoula- sautéed wild watercress and swiss chard, seared halloumi. ---Properly cooked to leave a fresh taste and slight crunch to the vegetables, love the halloumi cheese! Three Mezedes (Small Plates) - 'Chicagopita'- ramps, fresh dill, lemon and goat feta stuffed in house-made phyllo----a 'go-to' dish for the less experimental or those who just love phyllo-stuffed dishes, quite tasty.  - Htapodaki sti schara- wood-grilled octopus, fennel and red onions ---If you are looking for a big wow-factor, this is it! YUMMY, strong grilled flavor sets off the octopus perfectly! - Kebap yiuourtlou- wood-grilled spiced lamb shoulder, house-made yogurt, grilled tomatoes ---Delicious, same flavoring as the octopus with the wood-grilling. When I go back, I might try something different so as not to have two similarly flavored dishes. But I love lamb! And this was great! Two Kyria Piata (Mains) - Arni yuvetsaki me kritharaki- braised lamb shank in a yuvetsi (terra cotta dish), orzo sheep myzithra ---nice portion, the TENDEREST lamb, juicy and so flavorful. They know how to do it right! - Duck gyro - spit-roasted Gunthorp farms duck breast and leg rubbed with pastourma spices, mint yogurt sauce, Pontian satz bread, pomegranate reduction, pickles, duck fries ---another restaurant standard, and for good reason. Very tasty. I was looking forward to trying the duck fries, since I read about this craze when I was in London and hadn't yet tried it upon returning to Chicago. Maybe these weren't typical, but I found the duck fries nothing to write home to Mom about. I'll try again. Wine: Hatzimichalis 2006, Cabernet Sauvignon - Atalanti A GREAT suggestion by our waiter that met the desires of everyone in our party. Full-bodied, round, velvety mouth-feel and a bit of plum.   Dessert: Gosh, I don't remember!!!  Too much wine? Will edit in if recalled. One thing, not the restaurant's fault at all, that did put a slight damper on the evening was the loud conversation at the table next to us. When they left and another couple arrived shortly thereafter, they also spoke at decibals loud enough for everyone two tables over to hear. Anyway... Both couples were oblivious to the heads that continuously cranked around to see who was speaking so loudly.

2013-06-07,4.0,"Loved, loved, loved my experience at Taxim last night.  Taxim is the epitome of what a true and authentic Greek/Mediterranean restaurant should be - unlike the more tacky and touristy versions in Greektown.  The decor is subtle and classy and the restaurant offers a nice open space and welcoming ambiance. The cocktail menu was surprisingly interesting and 3 of us chose the visino sour, which is essentially their take on an old fashioned.  Delicious!  My friend's husband went with the second drink on the list, which was a gin martini with cucumber that was also delicious.   The food is prepared fresh with high quality ingredients.  The menu is original and even standard items like hummus have a new and refreshing take.  Not to mention, this is an excellent place to bring vegetarians - tons of options!  We started with the ""Chicagopita"" to share for the table, which was a stuffed phyllo of goodness and was perfect to split into 4 solid portions. My friend and I decided to share a few small plates while the boys went with entrees: Tzatziki - a traditional yogurt dish but somehow this was far and away the best version I'd ever had.  Smooth and freshly made, with plenty of flavor and very refreshing. Baimes Laderes - the baby okra dish was also a winner.  It is literally a bowl of baby okra with a little bit of sun dried tomatoes and one piece of bread but the okra was tender and spiced to perfection. Politiki Melitzanosalata - this is essentially their version of baba gannouj but more amazing than any I've had before.  Infused with seasoning and small bits of herbs to make it more substantial instead of the usual smooth blend. Revithia kas Frossos - Taxim's take on hummus.  Another winner and a special dish that goes above and beyond your every day hummus. Garides se abelofylla dolmades - large shrimp wrapped in grape leaves and grilled with a grilled hot pepper.  This was possibly the only dish I didn't love.  The shrimp was seasoned well and grilled well, but the grape leaves were over grilled and a little too wilted and overpowering.  If you're someone who is obsessed with grape leaves, you'll love this.  But if you're lukewarm to them, you might not care for the wilted nature of this dish. Duck Gyro - my fiance ordered this entree and absolutely loved it.  It was worth the high praise on yelp.  Quite honestly, I thought the dish was worth it just for the amazing fries. Kotopaulo sto fourno - my friend's husband went with the half chicken and also said it was well worth it. Service was very nice and friendly, but my only complaint is that the dishes do take quite a while to come out.  Even the drinks took an abnormally long time.  We had a 7:45 reservation and didn't leave until 10pm.  The food is well worth the trip, the service and ambiance are great, the cocktails are excellent, just make sure you allow a good amount of time for your visit.  We will definitely be back.",0.999,0.725,0.246,0.029,0.5606153641679958

I wish I had ordered small plates instead of an entree because I sampled some at the table and they were better than the chicken and potatoes I ordered. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I have to commend the excellent service here. We stayed past closing on a Monday night and the hostess didn't force us to leave.

2013-03-02,4.0,"My fiance and I came here to celebrate our anniversary together and we had a pretty good time. It was a weekend night and with our reservations, we were seated within 5 minutes. The decor of the restaurant is beautiful, especially the main dining room. the vaulted ceilings and dim lighting with cool artwork, which made for an awesome vibe. My issue here was how uncomfortable the seats were. I was on the bench side of the half booth/half-seat table and I was so close to my neighbors that I could hear their conversation and had a pretty hard time getting in and out of my seat. It was almost like a wooden bench I was sitting on with pillows and it even made my butt fall asleep, lol. I'm not a large person by any means, so I can empathize with anyone that is even slightly larger than me or isn't as able-bodied to get around as easily. The service was also pretty slow. We had to get our waiter's attention multiple times and remind them of our orders placed. I understand it was a packed house with lots of demands going on, but maybe they need to be staffed a little more when they're at full capacity. It wasn't the waiters fault. He did the best he could and he's only human but it still kind of ticked me off. We started with the chicagopita, chickpeas and grilled octopus (AMAZING!). I had the sea bass which freaked me out a little since they present it totally whole at first (bones and all) and then later take it back to chop it up. My bf had some meat (I forget) and we shared the greek yogurt desert with honey. The food was perfect and that made up for the other flaws, so I'm trying to not let the other stuff get the best of me. I'm not sure if I will go back because there are other greek restaurants that have given me better service for the same level of food (e.g., Greek Islands and others in Greektown) but my night at Taxim was pretty decent.",0.9907,0.827,0.14,0.032,0.5049481697440881

The service was absolutely fantastic. Our waiter was great at making wine suggestions, perfect in terms of proposing how much food to order, and thoughtful in assessing dietary restrictions. He was patient with our billion questions and coursed out a meal assembled of lots of small plates fairly well. Taxim isn't really a small plates place, although they definitely have a lot of that on the menu. My party just happened to be one that puts a high premium on variety so we ended up constructing a meal out of their smaller offerings. Although in general people seemed drawn to different dishes the clear winner was the revitha kas which must be Greek for hummus. It was smooth and delicious and we were practically licking the plate clean to fight over the last few tastes of tahini goodness. I favored the Kolokithokeftedes as well, a great mix of a house made yogurt, cabbage slaw, and butternut and acorn squash fritters. The food was solid and pleasing to a lot of different palates.

I had the Aegean Sea Bass, and my only regret was that it was so big that I could not finish it. But is was probably the best fish I have ever had in my entire life.

Firstly, I made the reservation a week in advance for myself and a few friends to which I was told that I did not have to purchase tickets but that I agreed to purchase food that would amount to $30 or more per table. I agreed, not seeing a problem with this.  To my horror, after my friends and I had been there the entire night, we were told that there was an actual cover to watch the band perform. The cover was really not anything to cry about but I felt as though I had been duped by the hostess who had told me that there would be no cover at all. This dishonestly really put a dent for this restaurant as I was really going to give it 5/5 stars. Okay, now that my rant is over, let me tell you more about the restaurant. The decor was really minimalistic as compared to the pictures in the actual site that had flowing curtains and Mediterranean carpets and made you feel as though you were in Greece or Persia.

2012-08-04,5.0,"Yes, this as about as good as it gets.  I'm a vegetarian, and ""mainstream"" restaurants don't often get 5 stars from me - usually due to lack of choice and/or lack of flavor in that one token vegetarian dish the chef thought to toss on the menu to appease us.  So not true at Taxim.  I had plenty of choices and everything we had was delicious. We started with the roasted eggplant with peppers dish and the beets.  Both were yummy, but the beets were outstanding.  The best part of the beet dish was the garnish of garlicky, herby greens.  I could have eaten a giant bowl of those greens alone and been happy-happy-happy. The next round was the lamb sausage (for my friend, which got a decent review) and the lentils for me.  Excellent flavor, albeit a bit overcooked for my taste.  I would have preferred them to be a bit al dente, but they were soft and a little mushy - but never mind the texture, they tasted great. We had good service, just attentive enough, neither pushy nor absentee.  and never pushy.  The waiter was friendly and offered suggestions, left us alone to eat in peace, but came back just in time to make sure we were taken care of. For a hot summer evening, we wanted a rose wine (a real rose, none of the white zin junk).  With two on the menu, one that was by the glass - the more expensive one and one that was available in bottle, a bit less expensive.  He recommended the less expensive one saying it was actually better than the pricer rose.  I like knowing that a waiter doesn't push something just to drive up the final bill. He was right.  Nice, dry, refreshing wine and just what we wanted. After sharing 4 small plates, we were stuffed.  I really wanted to try the artichokes, the Chicagopita and so much more, but there was no more room in this inn.  I'll be back.  I gotta love a place that I can return to wanting to try more dishes on the menu. Now, I'm off to buy beets (mostly for the greens) and see if I can recreate that dish at home.  And if I can't get close enough, I'm calling ahead next time to see if Taxim will make me an entire place of just the greens.  Those two tablespoons of goodness are worth the visit alone.",0.9975,0.767,0.195,0.038,0.5450902583255524

Our server was encouraging us to order more food, but we were both completely stuffed after we finished our last plate.  Overall, our server took good care of us. We were looking to have a long relaxing leisurely meal and that is exactly what happened. There are definitely some gems on the menu, and they are worth trying. The absolute best thing we ordered was the grilled octopus. It was smoky and succulent. The second best thing was the Chicagopita, it was a little Spinach pie in phyllo dough, which apparently they make the dough there. We both agreed we would just come back to eat the octopus, the Chicagopita, and finally try the duck gyros.  As for things that were not outstanding -- our other two dishes -- the arugula salad and the lamb sausage were okay. The lamb sausage had the texture of breakfast sausage which is definitely not my favorite sausage.  The sausage is spicy too but they give you a healthy helping of yogurt to save you.

I had a chicken dish that smelled delicious. My first bite and all I tasted was way too much salt! I peeled off the skin to just eat the meat...and the meat had virtually no flavor. My girlfriend had the skewered pork and that, too, was overly salty. Olive oil soaked the food instead of being drizzled for flavor making the fries with her meal completely soggy. And it cost 3x a similar meal in Turkey.  We will never eat there again. I don't understand how anyone can say the food here is tasty.

I went there with two friends and we shared 6 small dishes and an entree. One major sanitary concern I had was that none of the dishes came with serving utensils. I guess they expected us to use our already used, germy forks for splitting up portions. After an extensive wait trying to find someone to help us, we finally got the attention of a server to bring us a large fork. I would have expected each dish to come with one after this first request, but unfortunately the staff wasn't that intuitive. The chickpeas and beet cold plates were good. All the hot plates were on the oily side, but the tasted fairly good. The lamb was a liitle gamey and grisly...not exactly they best quality.

We split the ""pureed chickpeas"" cold starter (i.e. hummus), which was so delicious that we ordered a second one! The lamb sausage starter (which were pretty much gyros) was also quite good, but I remembered that I don't really like the taste of lamb, which was too bad. We both had the duck gyros as a main dish, which was delicious and unique. The duck fat fries on the side were bomb. My only complaint with the dish was that parts of the duck were a little gamey, which made eating the wrap hard at times. I found this restaurant based on SeriousEats.com's reviews of most romantic restaurants in Chicago, and I definitely will agree with that!

Everyone ordered drinks and we also ordered a bunch of small plates, both hot and cold, to start us off. The server did a good job mixing my drinks -- I ordered a Tom Collins (which he served in the wrong glass, but it still tasted good) and then a Sidecar later. Also all of our small plates were very good and came out in a timely fashion. We got the eggplant, octopus, okra, squash rissoles, and the pork loin. The squash and the okra were my two favorites of the bunch. Very delicious, fresh, and well made. And the pita was addicting! Unfortunately, our entrees took a VERY long time to come out of the kitchen, and then everyone agreed that they weren't great. As a matter of fact, the consensus at the table was that the chicken was the best dish. *The chicken.* When is the chicken ever a restaurant's best dish? Everyone else ordered either the duck gyro, the fish gyro, or the lamb shank. They make their gyros with phyllo dough instead of pita. I'm sorry, but phyllo dough does not a gyro make. That was more like a Greek taco. While the duck was very good, I did not enjoy the wrapper; I took the phyllo off. I wish they had put that on the menu, because I wouldn't have ordered it. None of us ordered dessert. They automatically include 18% gratuity to parties of 6 or more. I didn't feel badly about that, however, because our service was really very good.

Food is pretty good, had one main fish course and about 7 starters between us.

The space itself is warm and inviting, and the service has always been very solid.  The last time we were there, our server (Corey?) was excellent.  It was actually his birthday, but he brought us an unexpected free dessert, as well as some samples of a tasty white wine.  It was the perfect end to a great meal!",0.9845,0.806,0.194,0.0,0.539298245614035
2011-12-06,4.0,"We and another couple had dinner at Taxim last night, a restaurant in the vibrant Wicker Park area.  The restaurant is a single storefront space with only a blackboard on the sidewalk and a small sign on the wall next to the door to announce its presence.  You walk in by a small bar area, and the restaurant space itself is a series of copper topped tables.  Tables adjacent to the walls have wooden benches decorated with a variety of throw pillows of different designs and colors--suggestive of Arabic motifs.  The ceilings are very high, giving the room a pleasant sense of openness. Corey, our waiter, was very knowledgeable about the menu, which was very helpful since Taxim is not your average Greek restaurant, but shows influences from Cyprus, Turkey, and other parts of the eastern Mediterranean.  We started with roasted red and yellow beets served with wilted Swiss chard, counterbalanced by a garlic walnut skordalia (a puree of the walnuts and garlic with Greek olive oil) and a nice feta triangle.  Another small plate was a leek pie made with phyllo dough, goat feta, dill and lemon.  Green lentils cooked in olive oil and water, served with a balsamic reduction and a triangle of sheep's feta and semolina pita bites was delicious as well.  Baby okra with fresh coriander, tossed with olive oil and thinly sliced pieces of sun-dried tomatoes was a hit with 3 out of the 4 of us, with my wife not so keen on the taste of the okra.  I felt there was no greasy or slimy feel to the baby okra, and although the sun-dried tomatoes were too salty by themselves, they countered the need for seasoning of the okra.  The only miss on the appetizers was the average and uninspired roasted eggplant variation on babaghanoush. Main plates are a good sized portion, and we shared 4 entrées.  We had 2 orders of the excellent duck gyro, roasted duck breast and leg meat served wrapped in ""Pontian"" satz bread with a mint yogurt sauce, with duck fat french fries.  Oven roasted whole sea bass was perfectly cooked, and deboned at tableside, served with nicely sautéed dandelion greens.  I ordered the fish gyro, a roasted sea bream served in the same satz bread but with a tahini sauce.  I found the bream to be fishy smelling, and excessively salted, and could not recommend it. We had no room to sample the desserts, but they did look interesting.  The wine list is a very extensive introduction to Greek white, reds and a few roses.  We had a very nice Santorini Assyritko, full of fruit with a good acid balance.

2011-11-01,3.0,"I went to Taxim recently with a group of 10 people for a friend's birthday. We had a pretty good experience, but there were some negatives.  A plus was that I liked the look of the restaurant. I liked the exposed-brick walls, the high ceilings and the lantern-style light fixtures. It was cozy and intimate inside, though it was also very loud when we were there for dinner on a Saturday night.  Our waitress, Allison, was very friendly and attentive. When she came over to our table when we first got there, she actually recommended ordering one of each of the hot and cold appetizers and one of each of the entrees for a group of our size. But instead of taking her advice, which we thought would be WAAAAAY too much food, we ordered a few appetizers and entrees to share.  Everything tasted good, but we were all really taken aback by how small the portions were. We definitely did not order enough food! I mean, obviously Allison recommended ordering a lot more, but we were like, yeah, each appetizer is an average of $9, and each entree is about $25, so yeah ... I don't think so. I mean, our bill still came out to $800, but I think everyone was still hungry when we left. Like I said, the food was tasty and the flavors were right-on. A couple appetizers that stood out were the Revíthia Kas Fróssos (pureed chickpeas, lemon, garlic, fresh green chickpeas served with pita) and the Garídes koúpes (lamb-encrusted shrimp with feta). Super tasty, but the portions were super tiny considering the price (the shrimp was $12 and the chickpea dish was $6). For an entree my husband and I ordered the Duck Gyro. We chose it mainly because it was one of the few entrees on the menu where we thought we knew what we were getting. Boy, were we surprised when the Duck Gyro came out looking like two egg rolls. It was definitely a unique interpretation of a gyro! It was tasty, but, again, the portion was small. As for the service, like I said, our waitress was really great. Another negative of our night, however, was that there was way too much lag time between when we finished our appetizers and when the entrees came. There was at least a 45 minutes between appetizers and entrees. Our waitress was very apologetic and said the kitchen was backed up, but it was kind of frustrating--especially since we barely had anything to eat for appetizers. Then, of course, when the entrees finally came out, we were disappointed by the portion size. Also, I think if the entrees would have come out faster, we would have ordered dessert. We were afraid we would be stuck there waiting for it for another 40 minutes and decided to leave. Overall, the food at Taxim was good, there just wasn't enough of it. The service was good when it came to our waitress, though there was too much lag time between when appetizers and entrees came out.

The bottom line is - this place is a huge find and secret.  Only half the tables were full on a Monday evening. that very fact is a tragic reflection of our culture, but that being said, it is an opportunity for people to put this place on the map and give it its' due!   Good grief - there wasn't a single dish that came out of that kitchen that wasn't extraordinary, and a couple were truly transcendent!  Humble hummus is an exquisitely light concoction, closer to whipped cream than to the dense clay you can get at the store.  There was smelt wrapped in grape leaves, an extraordinarily tender grilled octopus, an eggplant puree that was worthy of tears, and roast duck gyros that were truly sublime.

They're filling, delicious, and do not disappoint. The atmosphere is nice. The selection of wines is also nice. I had previously had the opinion, based on my experience, that Greek wine is like Michigan wine, well intentioned, but just not my style. Thanks to Taxim I no longer believe that. Every server recommended wine I've tried has been nice. If I had more time to eat out I think I'd eat at Taxim every week.

2011-09-06,4.0,"Taxim has been opened more than 2 years now.  It took me this long to make it there.  In that time, I could've travelled to Greece on foot (and flippers) many times over lol.  Anyway, I regret not having been to Taxim sooner, so now I need to make up for lost time. Taxim is not your big fat Greek wedding.  The dining room was sultry and mysterious on a late Saturday evening.  The food is also not of the Greektown variety.  The menu is fairly descriptive, but our waitress was also very adept in explaining the dishes.  From the all-Greek wine list, the Skouras Zoe rose was vibrant with luscious fruit.  I could almost feel the Mediterranean breeze. There's a huge variety of cold and hot mezes.  By all means, get plenty to share.  Everything I've tried was good.  Pureed chickpeas with fresh green chickpeas.  This is the summer of fresh green chickpeas in Chicago.  The little Prassopita of leeks and goat feta in phyllo was sublime.  I wish I could wake up everyday and have this for breakfast.  The lamb-encrusted shrimp needed a bit more explanation, until I realized that it is pretty much kefta wrapped around shrimp.  It's an interesting take on surf and turf, but the lamb might have been too aggressive for the shrimp.  Lastly, the Dolmades of smelts was a revelation.  If you know dolmades, imagine that, but with unexpected smokiness from the grill. For mains, I had the Oven-Roasted whole Aegean Sea Bass in lemon and olive oil, and sautéed dandelions.  So I asked our waitress, ""It's from the Aegean?""  She goes, ""Yes, they are flown in every day.""  I had a momentary pang of guilt in the name of locavores everywhere.  But then I bite into the sweet white flesh, punched up wit lemony tang and sharp bitterness of the dandelions.  All was forgotten. For dessert, the house-made yogurt with Peloponnese fir tree honey and walnuts.  A few years ago, I had a transcendental moment in Italy eating a simple dessert of fresh ricotta with fruit jam.  This was a similar experience.  The texture of the yogurt was like nothing I've had before. Why 4 stars?  Taxim is a very unique restaurant unlike any other in the city.  The atmosphere is terrific.  The food is inspired, delicious and unique.  If I close my eyes, I could feel my bare feet soaking in the warm cerulean Grecian waters.",0.9939,0.832,0.138,0.031,0.5689123376623376

We ordered the octopus upon the insistence of our server and were NOT disappointed.  It was tender and beautifully seasoned.  We also got the baba ghanooj style appetizer and the beet salad with skordalia - I could eat these two items every day of my life, they were out of this world.  The fried zucchini and whole sea bass were also incredible.  The prices on glasses of wine were also quite reasonable. Our server was on top of his game, even though he was very obviously being seated more than he was comfortable with.  I get pretty pissed off when I see that one server is not only taking care of tables inside and outside but also being oversat in both sections.  That's just careless to the customers and to the server, as either section can't see that he's got tables in both places and thus don't realize how busy he actually is, which can often lead to unpleasant customers and lower tips for a server that is actually working his ass off.  But I digress, because the service was awesome.  He was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and spoke so passionately about certain items that we knew they must be delicious.

We were there at 7:30 on a Saturday, so the noise level was a little high but not unreasonable and I appreciated that there was plenty of space between tables so that I didn't feel pressed up against the neighbors, something that happens all too often in popular restaurants these days. The service was great.  Everyone was very low key and friendly, but our server Demetrious also knew the menu top to bottom, gave great recommendations and even fixed my lady friend up with a great wine for her tastes (The wine list is filled with Greek wines, so the extra help was much appreciated). But it's really all about the food and that's where Taxim really came through.  I had an appetizer of grilled octopus which was just beautiful.  Cooked to perfection with the flavor of the grill coming through and served with some sweet grilled red onions which did a great job complimenting the octopus.  Then for my entree I had the duck gyro, on my server's recommendation and I loved it.  Everything on the plate was delicious.  The duck was well seasoned and juicy and the great yogurt sauce it came with really completed the flavoring of the dish.  Even the pickles and the fries were exceptional. Finally for dessert, we tried the fried dumplings in cream and honey, which were incredible little beignets swimming in sweet creamy goodness.  If that doesn't sound awesome to you then we're probably not going to get along.

The mashed roasted eggplants and lamb-encrusted shrimp were tasty as well. However, the house-marinated olives were far to briny for me. Even if they were good, I would expect them to be served as a condiment and not as an extremely small-sized side dish. For main courses, we had the duck gyro, Amish chicken and lamp chops. The chicken was the best out of the three. It was cooked perfectly and the portion size was perfect, but the dish could have used more fingerling potatoes and garnishes. The  lamp chops, while cooked correctly, were not trimmed correctly - two of our pieces had gristle. The overall taste was rather flat. The almond currant bulgar wheat pilaf that came with the lamb was excellent! The duck was a major disappointment. The dough was mushy and the duck pieces were overcooked and had the taste of reheated poultry. The duck fries were great. I  asked for ketchup, so that at least part of the meal could be salvaged into good fast food, but none was available. So we settled for the ""okay"" yogurt sauce.

When the entrees did arrive, one person was forgotten about. They did apologize and quickly (8 minutes?) later brought out an entree for him.

2011-01-23,4.0,"Came here with two friends on a recent Friday night. I ended up very pleasantly surprised. I love mediterranean food, but Taxim stood out for the presentation of the food and the occassional unique dish or preparation, which reminded me of those innovative upscale American restaurants that delight you with ingredient pairings you never would have thought of. We chose to be seated immediately closer to the entrance, rather than waiting for one of the darker (more romantic?) tables in the back to open. The three of us girls split 6 small plates and a dessert, which left us feeling perfectly full, and not bloated. Plus we each got a taste of everything we ordered for just $22 per person with tax and tip, not bad for a more upscale place.  Chickpeas - your typical hummus, tasted great with pita Eggplant - a warm, less lemony babaganoush. I generally like anything eggplant, and this did not disappoint. I especially liked the sesame seeds sprinkled on for extra flavor. Leeks - a definite win. None of us noticed the phyllo in the description, so when a soft, crispy, flaky, thick pancake-like dish came out, it was a pleasant surprise (I love phyllo!). Lentils - the balsamic reduction added an unexpected twist to the dish, but I'm still not sure that I like it that way Snails - didn't taste like much to me, but I find that tends to be the case with snails. For a small plate, though, there was a generous portion of snails (I'm pretty sure a typical french restaurant only serves 12, albeit bigger ones, per entree). Butternut and Acorn Squash - another of my favorites. I'm a big fan of butternut squash, and these were incredible. The house-made yogurt was nice and thick and complimented the rissoles well. Almond and walnut dessert - basically a baklava, we were told. I typically find baklava to be overly sweet and sticky, but theirs was the rare exception. Crispy tubes of phyllo packed with nuts, a hint of honey, and some ice cream. It is a little pricier than I usually like to pay for a meal out, and far from my neighborhood, but I would definitely recommend everyone try Taxim at least once.",0.9984,0.704,0.256,0.04,0.5545555555555555

Each dribble of sauce or bit of cheese was PACKED with flavor! The first cold plate we ordered was their fire-roasted eggplant spread with their homemade pitas. Delish... only enough for one greedy person. Next we had one of their hot plates: their lamb sausage. Please don't make someone share this with you. It was the most flavorful, decadent item we tasted. The type of eating experience you simple never forget. We had the goat-stuffed quince next... which was an exciting blend of spice, savor and sweet. It was topped with their homemade Greek yogurt, which prompted us to order their yogurt, walnuts and honey for desert.  Our waitress was lovely, knowledgeable and quite attentive. My only complaint is  the price of the restaurant.

2010-11-14,5.0,"My boyfriend and I went to Taxim last night in search of a finer Greek food experience.  I had super high hopes, and I was not disappointed. Our waitress was friendly and well informed.  She took her time with us, did not make us feel rushed, and treated us with respect.  At many finer dining restaurants, my boyfriend and I are treated differently because we're in our 20s.  Although many of the diners were in their 30s and 40s, we were served very well. We started with the greens, and they were fantastic.  Served with toasted haloumi cheese and a slice of lemon, the flavor lingered on the tongue.  I recommend this for an appetizer. I had the lamb shoulder, and it was AMAZING.  It reminded me of my childhood, and my grandmother's cooking on Easter.  I felt like the critic in Ratatouille.  Memories of my childhood came flooding back to me with each bite.  It was a true food experience. My boyfriend had the duck gyros.  He was nervous about getting duck because he is generally not a fan.  Instead of being wrapped in pita, they are wrapped in a crepe.  The crepe was outstanding. If you like duck, this is for you.  If you're not generally a duck eater, I would choose something else.  The dish came with duck fries and a nice mint yogurt sauce, and they were delicious. At Taxim, I had the best Greek meal I've had in Chicago (besides my grandmothers cooking).  The decor and ambiance stands out as classic against some of the cheesier restaurants in Greektown.  I am thrilled to see Greek food expanding in the city, outside the Halstead mainstay.  This place is a must.",0.9929,0.789,0.18,0.031,0.4786000000000001
2010-11-09,1.0,"Note:  This review relates only to the grilled octopus appetizer!!  First, let me start by saying that my friend and I are big fans of Santorini in Greektown.  The bar was set high by our experience there.  The grilled octopus at Santorini is delicate, chewy, tender, and grilled to perfection with the perfect char.  It's the sort of thing where you want to close your eyes to fully savor it. The lemony oily juice it is served in compliments the dish nicely and is perfect for dipping hunks of crusty bread into.  In addition, Santorini serves a perfect combination of octopus pieces, i.e. smaller curly parts and bigger chunky pieces.  We've picked up the octopus appetizer to go on two occasions--the portion is generous and they give you a half loaf of warm bread and chunks of cut lemon. Price:  $11.50. Verdict: AWESOME.  Now... on to the experience at Taxim.  We were looking for a neighborhood option for our grilled octopus fix last night and thought we'd give Taxim a try.  HUGE MISTAKE!!  The flavors are fine, but the portion was literally 5 smallish pieces of octopus, and an overwhelming amount of onion and fennel.  Price: $14.  Verdict:  GUILTY of unforgivable stinginess.  Totally disappointing and overpriced. So, if you want delicious grilled octopus go directly to Santorini and don't look back.  Taxim needs to try harder!",0.9422,0.795,0.153,0.053,0.633611111111111

The decor and ambiance were very nice and totally transported you to another place. The seating, as typical of many a Wicker Park restaurants, was very cozy and as we were early for Saturday night dinner, it was no problem at first. But as the restaurant started filling up, our neighbors forgot all rules of politeness and started eavesdropping on our conversation without even pretending to not be listening.  Initially, we thought this would be a great date spot! However, when full, the conversation becomes hard to maintain because the acoustics are such that sound bounces and unless your vocal chords are exercised enough to keep a loud conversation rolling, no conversation could quickly become the preferred route as it did for us.  The wines were very expensive and we ended up skipping that. Between the two of us, we ordered 4 appetizers - the hummus, the eggplant, the greens, and the lentils. The meal was filling, but not satisfying, because the same pita bread with different dips just didn't feel like it was enough of a comprehensive meal. The eggplant and hummus were also nothing special. The lentils were really good, but not sufficient alone to bring either of us back here..!  None of their entrees are vegetarian so we didn't have much choice there either!

It is incredible to see how this strip of Wicker Park has changed over the years. I remember when there was really not a lot of activity and lots of empty warehouse style buildings. Now it is incredibly congested with lots of cars and people. A great change of scenery from the pace at Lincoln Square (if only for a night). Taxim is a beautiful restaurant with very tall ceilings, huge windows in the front, nice big arches in the interior and classy Greek decorations. The service was excellent. The menu is great with a lot of appetizers that look good and an interesting list of entrees. We decided to go the ""tapas"" route and order a bunch of appetizers. This was really excellent and refined Greek food. 5 of the 6 dishes we ordered were vegetarian options. The Greek hummus (can't remember the name) was exceptional, as was the pork belly dish. The greens with cheese were somewhat bitter but balanced with the saltiness of the cheese and the acid of the lemon. I didn't try the fig but was told it was great. The creamy semolina cake that came with it was delicious. The ramps in phyllo with cheese were also very tasty and rich. This place really exceeded my expectations. We really wanted to try a dessert (they all sounded great) but decided to leave something for our next visit. I look forward to going back and trying some of the entrees and desserts.

2010-07-11,1.0,"Went to Taxim on 7/10/10. By far the pictures on the site were very deceiving. Ordered the roasted eggplant with homemade pita. It was very good but also about half the size of the picture on the site. I ordered a double portion of the grilled octopus appetizer for my entree. It came on a side salad dish ($28) and again was the size of a small salad. I spoke to the manager and she explained that octopus was very expensive. She did exchange the dish for another dish which she said would come out in a ""couple of minutes"". It finally came after the others in my party were finished with their meals and their dishes were removed. Unbelievably BAD service!! I have Greek relatives and have had octopus on a number of occasions at many Greek and Italian restaurants. I know for a fact that octopus ranges from $5-$8 per lb. Also in our group, we ordered the lamb chops and Chillean sea bass. Lamb chops were overdone and fatty. The sea bass was more like red snapper-- also overcooked and dry with many bones in it. Overall a very disappointing dinner. After reading all the positive reviews I could not believe our meal was so poor. Also the site states that prices range from $18-$25. NOT so. The sea bass was over $30 and the lamb chops around $28 I have five daughters who live in Chicago(3 married). They are always looking for new restaurants to try.

I went here with my sisters and Brother-in-law (BIL) - all who appreciate a good meal. We loved it!! Taxim's cuisine is actually more Turkish than anything. The decor is also more Eastern Mediterranean/Byzantine rather than Grecian. The light fixtures, copper tables and plaster ceiling are really great and set a cool mood. The place was bustling, but we had no wait at all! Food: We started with the beets served with feta cheese and skordalia, the rampopita, cauliflower with zucchini and the octopus. The octopus dish was amazing - it's served with fennel and red onions. The onions really brought out the octopus flavor. The sheep's milk feta cheese and the skordalia (a thick walnut based sauce) were also great with the beets.  The cauliflower is served with kasseri cheese which was the highlight of that dish. The ramps are served with fresh house-made phyllo which Taxim absolutely nails.  For main dishes, we split the lamb shoulder and the fava bean and goat cheese dumplings. The lamb is braised with red wine and served with delicious orzo. I probably could have used more meat, but the dish was great. The dumplings come with eggplant, tomatoes and turkish yogurt. The yogurt is the best part - it's made in house and is delicious.  For dessert we had the rolled phyllo pastry with cretan clotted cream and walnuts. HOLY CRAP!! - I can't believe dessert was the best part. It was AMAZING - similar to a warm churro with spiced yogurt.  Drinks: The entire wine list is comprised of Grecian wines.

2010-04-22,5.0,"Taxim, is a phenomenal and unique eating experience. I know that it's billed as ""modern greek"", but that is not an adequate description as this food is on a level unto its own. Everything is extraordinarily fresh and well prepared, yet simple allowing the natural flavors of the main ingredient to stand out.  Each dish was unique and so flavorful, I couldn't believe how the flavors popped in my mouth.  I went with a group of 6 so we were able to try many different dishes.  My favorites were: - eggplant salad - grilled peppers - octopus - pork belly - duck gyros (the flavoring is reminiscent of N. Indian spices- is not reflective of traditional greek flavors) - fava bean dumplings - turlu The wine list is great, although on the expensive side for greek wines. ($12 for a glass of greek wine? perhaps since the Euro it's gotten more expensive????) The deserts are good. Not as outstanding as the food.  Lastly, the only two buzz kills during this incredible meal were: 1) the waitress was not very attentive, particularly since we were a group there for a special occasion 2)they did not provide adequate bread with the dishes being shared in a large group and we had to repeatedly ask for more.

First of all, I love that someone took Greek food and made it modern.  Don't get me wrong, I love Greektown but the restaurants there feel very pedestrian.

2010-02-12,3.0,"I had dinner at Taxim just the other night. I would say that both the service and the atmosphere were very nice, and if you are looking for a more trendy and romantic Greek restaurant with good flavors this is a good spot.  Overall the food was good. It definitely had a more interesting presentation then normal Greek food but the flavors were ultimately the same. We had the octopus which was very good and a nice size portion. I really enjoyed the leeks and onions that came with it. We had the hummus which had a great flavor and I loved the onion, capers, and house made pita bread that came with it but if you look at their web page it was very misleading. They show it in a bowl as a much larger portion and with a very creamy texture, but it is actually a rather small portion on a plate with just a rough puree. If you prefer a more creamy and liquid hummus as some do this is not what you will get. We also got the pork belly which was just so so. I felt it was not crispy enough and although I like the idea of a sweet accompaniment, it was difficult to get the onions and pork in one bite so you had to eat them separately.  For an entree we shared the duck gyro which was a huge portion. I would recommend splitting it as an appetizer if you are going with four people as four huge pieces of it is a bit much as it is a pretty basic flavor. It was suppose to come with a pomegranate sauce which would have added a nice sweet contrast but I did not see that on the plate.  We also got the $10 wine flight. I enjoyed all the wines. Ultimately the bill was about $90 for two people for 3 appetizers, one entree and two wine flights. I didn't really feel that the dinner was what my expectation of $90 meal would be. I also felt that despite the effort to make a more refined and trendy Greek dishes, the flavors were the same and basically you ended up with the same typical meal with out the left overs to take home bc the portions were smaller.  I will say I really appreciated the server bringing us extra pita and sauce for no charge and giving us a very nice table.  If I want to romanticize Greek food then I would go back but if i just want traditional fare for less money and left overs then I am heading to Greektown.",0.9971,0.767,0.193,0.04,0.4942397660818713

2010-01-12,4.0,"I will now qualify my stars by saying that I would really go with 3.5 stars. Here's why, and I'll start with the good: SERVICE - Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, patient, efficient, and had excellent timing. When my friend and I ordered a second wine flight each, although the bar was running low on reds, he said, ""I'll make it work,"" and indeed he did, bringing us back what we wanted plus a surprising and delicious rose. He was a total pro. FOOD - We ordered 5 things, and the food started off incredible, but got a little less impressive as the meal wore on. The highlights of the meal were the beet small plate, that came on top of this heavenly walnut-garlic puree that I want to crawl inside of and live forever. We also got the greens with seared haloumi, which was a garlicky, delicious delight. These are both small plates - it's worth noting that the small plates at Taxim are not that small - I could have had 3 all vegetable small plates and been very satisfied. Between the 2 of us, we ordered 4 small plates and one large, and it would have been too much food if it weren't for our lackluster big plate. Our server recommended the octopus, which was surprisingly smoky, meaty, and good. We also got, based on other Yelp reviews, a layered veggie thing that was pretty good. The one true disappointment was the duck gyros. I am so sad to say this as I adore a) duck and b) gyros. The duck was just very dry, and the sauces, which were really yummy, were barely on the plate. I wanted more, MORE (of the sauce). Definitely the only disappointing dish. I would definitely go back to Taxim for more wine and more vegetarian small plates. They use a variety of excellent cheeses that take the veggie plates over the top. The decor is lovely, and overall I really enjoyed my experience.",0.9977,0.707,0.252,0.041,0.5231525573192239

The benches/chairs are a little hard, but no pain in the butt was reported. The place was very empty at first, half full by the time we left. Now to the really good stuff - the food! Pureed chickpeas with pita: Enjoyed by all, the favorite of the 18 year old in our group. The waiter gladly brought more pita. Beets with greens and garlic puree: My absolute favorite. The 20 year old in the group who doesn't like beets went for seconds.  Green Lentils: Again, enjoyed by all, but two skimpy, skimpy slices of bread? Come on! The only misfire - the two slices looked sad all by themselves. 6 skimpy slices would fit on the plate and look better.  Reminded me vaguely of refried beans.  Leeks in phyllo: A perfectly acceptable dish, but no ones favorite. The other stuff was too good.      Octopus: Yes, please, can I have more? If not for the beets, my favorite. Perfectly smoky and not a tough piece in the bunch. Grilled nicely with green onions. Beets and octopus would be a good meal here.  Turlu: Very good again. A keeper.  By now the four of us were pretty full but we had two entrees coming. Not sure if our fullness hindered our impressions but here goes: Duck Gyro: Served in a thin, crispy crepe-thick pita. Stuffed with lots and lots of duck. I was surprised to get three large 'gyros"" the size of mega-eggrolls. Pretty good, but too many better choices to order this one again.   Amish Chicken: A smaller than expected deboned chicken cut into pieces, lightly breaded and fried/oven baked. I mean this in a good way - it reminded me of high-end shake and bake. I might go for this again with a veggie small plate for a side.   I can see why prices are a downer to some reviewers but you get what you pay for. Good food and good ambiance cost more than McDonalds. If you're price sensitive I'd recommend the beets, lentils and chickpeas for a grand total of $17. You'll like it and you'll be really full.  Finally, the wine flights available for $10 on Sunday are small pours of the four wines they offer by the glass. You can get red or white.

2009-12-20,4.0,"I didn't know much about Taxim when I went last night, but I have to agree with those who saw very strong Turkish influences in the food. Overall I enjoyed all the dishes we had, but while the ingredients were high quality and fresh, the execution seemed to be a little on the safe side. There are so many exciting flavors in Aegean cuisine so it was a little disappointing especially since the two dishes that I had never seen on an American menu before were not available (sahlep ice cream though you can get that at the Turkish festival in Daley plaza every year and the lamb intestine dish that Turks call kokorec). Still we enjoyed a wide variety of well prepared dishes and there were enough unique items on the menu that I'd be willing to go back to try more. We started off with their roasted eggplant salad, a plate of olives, and the okra dish. I thought the eggplant salad was closer to Turkish patlican salatasi than baba ghanoush because the lemon flavor was stronger than the tahini flavor (was there tahini in it? I didn't pick up any). I like my eggplant smokey and this was good but not great in that department. It was served with pine nuts and good pita bread, but not what I would consider authentic pita. The okra dish was simple and delicious. The olives were middle of the road, nothing compared to the crunchy olives I ate growing up in Detroit or on my recent trip to Spain, but certainly better than most supermarket olives I get in Chicago. We followed those dishes with the grilled octopus and the leek pie. The octopus was very tender though they didn't serve very much of it on the plate. Grilled octopus is one of my absolute favorite foods, and while this version was good, I kind of prefer the big hunks of charred octopus with vinegar you get at Greek Islands. Also they served it with somewhat large chunks of roasted onions and fennel root that were nice as a complement but there was too high a ratio of roasted roots/bulbs to octopus on the plate. They recommend having the octopus with ouzo, which I really enjoyed. The ouzo was sweet and really warmed up your mouth while you drank it. The phyllo breading on the leek pie was excellent. Crispy on the outside with poppy seeds and chewy on the inside, I think they got this dish pretty much dead on. For mains we had the roasted lamb and the duck gyros. The lamb was served medium rare with a mild oregano skordalia that really didn't hold up to the meaty lamb flavor. The lamb itself was very tender and juicy, but the sear on the oustide was lacking the traditional lamb flavor I was craving. They cut the lamb into four servings so we could share it easily but that meant that each of us didn't get very much of the seared lamb, which I think was a detriment to the dish overall. The duck gyro didn't taste like duck to me. They say they cooked it with pastirma spices, but I didn't really pick that up. To me pastirma has a strong cumin and hot paprika flavor that really kicks you in mouth, and these duck gyros were nothing like that. Once again the meat was moist and tender, but seemed more mild that what I'm accustomed to in Aegean cuisine (granted duck gyros are something of a fusion dish). I'm not sure I totally understood the concept of this restaurant. Chicago could definitely use some meze style restaurants, and the menu at Taxim definitely offers a range of authentic and interesting options. Yet they prepared many of the dishes in a way that mutes the flavors that make the cuisine unique and delicious. I have to go back to try the kokorec and the sahlep because those are dishes that are so hard to find, and if the sea bream is anything close to the stuff you can get on the Mediterranean coast that dish alone would be worth the price of admission. But as it stands I enjoyed my meal at Taxim, but it fell short of the lofty expectations I had after reading over the menu.",0.9988,0.78,0.176,0.044,0.5228219811131203

The space is decorated in a very cool Middle Eastern vibe. We ordered 4 of the small dishes and were totally stuffed leaving and were shocked by how reasonably priced it is!

The food itself was outstanding; not overcomplicated and attentive towards the nature of the ingredients.  The standout for me was a fava bean salad with lamb confit and yogurt, though all the dishes were really well managed.  We made a wise decision to order two dinners and load up on the appetizers, which gave us a real wide selection of flavors in the single sitting.  Even my friend, who views eating as a necessary evil that often simply drains him of cash, enjoyed his meal. The atmosphere was dark and the noise level was a bit on the loud side, but anyone who goes out for Mediterranean food looking for a airy, well-lit, tranquil evening isn't managing expectations appropriately.

But, we were soothed because he came by and filled my wine again, which I thought was nice. We even let it slide that he didn't bring the bread with okra. BUT, then the bill came and he CHARGED us for the glass of wine and the pita! This is way too upscale of a place to charge for more pita and who ever heard of just bringing wine by without being asked and charging for it?

2009-08-23,5.0,"WOW. Taxim just restored my faith in restaurants. After a recent run of disappointments I was oh so pleasantly delighted with this authentic greek/med fare. It was really a fine dining experience without the pretentious attitude that comes with some higher priced restaurants and it made my night.  I learned only later that they use organic ingredients and the meat is locally grown, and the recipes are family ones that grow as the chef travels around the Mediterranean. I went this wkd when visiting a friend in Chicago and we waited at the seats upfront while a table opened up. I loved the decor, great ambiance, comfy cushions and dim lighting. Yes, the tables were pretty close together, giving it a rather communal feel but upon being seated I did not feel the tables near us were too loud where I could hear anyone else's conversation, in fact, the overall noise factor made it possible to only really hear the conversation at one's own table. It's a more intimate seating, so it's not ideal for conversation, but who cares, I was so enthralled with the food, as were my friend and my cousin, that we didn't NEED to talk, just EAT! It being a late dinner and all, we simply shared a few dishes - for appetizer we had the Piperies -roasted red and yellow peppers with capers, this delish garlic confit and a cheese I cannot pronounce that was thinly shaved on top. It was served with mini pitas. and was sooo flavorful I just savored every bite for as long as I could.  We also had the roasted eggplant, zucchini and potato appetizer with feta cheese which I enjoyed. And then came the main dish. ohhh. Goat kebab so tender and subtly spiced you could not help but sigh and savor with gratitude. It came served with rice and yogurt. It was just perfect. Not over-spiced in the least, but certainly not lacking anything either.  This meal made me very happy.  For dessert we tried both the chocolate semolina halva and the boughatsa. The former was ehh, just ok, the soaked kumquats were a bit too intense for me, and the halva not nearly chocolatey enough. But that boughatsa. was just. awesome. It was this phyllo pie with custard and vanilla and lemon. They did not overkill with the sugar so it was not too rich, just right. Although I would have preferred a crispy phyllo. I don't think it was meant to be crispy, I was just in the mood for something akin to baklava. Not the best dessert i have ever had, but it satisfied. I enjoyed the ambiance, friendly and attentive service, knowledgeable staff (easy on the eyes too), and fine ingredients. Everything you see in the menu description is what you get, no additional frills, but the flavors just pleased me so so much. They were simple yet married so well with each other.  I want to go back and get the goat  kebab for myself next time, I want to try the pomegranate duck, and a few more apps. To anyone going to Chicago I recommend this restaurant. I think it's absolutely worth the splurge. Well, except for the wine which was quite pricey. My table was satisfied with the $26 bottle of red from Southern Greece, the cheapest one on the list.

All the food is organic:  the meats are from free range local farms, the fish, organic and imported from Greece.  I was really impressed with the thought that went into the cuisine.  This is not typical Greek food.  Per the owner, most of the items on the menu were old family recipes, and traditional recipes discovered on his travels throughout the mediterranean that represent more historical Greek cooking, from when the Byzantine empire stretched across Asia minor.

2009-07-12,4.0,"BF and I ate here the other night and had a very pleasant dinner.  Usually I'm not keen on eating in Wicker Park as some of the dining establishments can be over-hyped and underwhelming but overpriced, but Taxim had good food at a reasonable value and the service and decor were excellent. We started with two glasses of the Greek Sauvignon Blanc, which was reasonable at $7/glass.  We decided to make a meal of several dishes form the hot and cold appetizers menus and ended up feeling much fuller than we thought we would be.  We basically ordered everything on the top half of th emenu that did not involve meat or eggplant (BF has an allergy).  LOVED everything:  1. baby arugula salad with bits of haloumi cheese: argula was very fresh; dressing had a lemony zing; fried or grilled pieces of cheese very tasty 2. peppers--tender and flavorful, draped with elegant and not overwhelming slices of cheese and a sprinkling of capers.  yummy. 3. lentils stewed in reduced balsamic and sprinkled with fresh feta cheese--one of my favorite dishes--earthy and satisfying. 4. ramp in phyllo pastry (served with a small triangle of feta): beautiful and delicious.  It reminded me of a well-made breakfast pastry, one that I wish I could have every morning. 5. baby okra!! who knew you could have little tiny okra pods the size of your thumbnail?!  They were so delicious!  but by then we were getting really full... 6. house marinated olives. the only ordinary and not-super-impressive item on the menu.  They were ok, but no comparison other olives that we like a lot better.  We're picky about our olives. by the time all our dishes were eaten (and believe me, we ate everything), we were almost too full to order dessert, but could not resist the Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts.  We don't regret ordering it because it was heavenly! The other nice thing about the restaurant is that they have a great wine list of mainly Greek wines that can't be found anywhere else.  our waitress was extremely generous with sample pours for us, once she established that we had an interest.  Overall, the service was wonderful and the whole experience quite enjoyable (I also really liked the copper-topped tables and Joseph Aboud dinnerware.  Beautiful).  My only surprise was that there weren't more diners there on a Friday night (maybe we were there early, I don't know.  We ate between 5:30-6:30 on a beautiful summer day.   Anyway, it was good.  We'd recommend it and we'd go there again.",0.9992,0.732,0.26,0.008,0.6171474358974359

We sampled a number of the wines on their list and didn't find much of interest--or aligned to the cooking. YMMV.

We started with a lovely bottle of Greek sparkling wine and ordered a few appetizers to start. Let me just say - they were absolutely fantastic... the lentils, the peppers, and oh my God the okra!

While I enjoyed my gyro very much, I cannot WAIT to go back and order the chicken.  So finally...dessert. At this point I was maybe the fullest I've been in a long time, but, in typical Marissa fashion, I had to try at least 3 desserts, especially my favorite Greek dessert - yogurt with honey and walnuts. Delicious (even though my future mother-in-law's homemade yogurt is most definitely more delicious). I ate every bite...a move that perhaps wasn't the smartest considering the extreme and uncomfortable fullness that hit me once we left the restaurant. The other two desserts we tried were the bougatsa and something that I forgot the name of...it was like a baklava - phyllo dough around walnuts and honey.

2009-07-01,3.0,"I really liked Taxim.  I had higher expectations than what they delivered, but it was very good.  In fact, their yoghurt, which i believe they make (?) was some of the best I've ever had.   Upon deciding between two dishes on the menu, we asked our waiter, who was very decisive and didn't give any reasoning behind his swift choices.  They were good ones, though.  He steered us toward the lamb confit with fava beans which was the winner of the night.  The flavors were earthy and deep with hints of cinnamon and clove.  But i wanted larger pieces of confit.  The texture of the favas was just perfect with the creamy yoghurt.  The eggplant meze was decent, but a bit greasy, and the arugula salad tasted good but was missing some zing... It felt too easy and simple.  It needed more than just the arugula and the haloumi, perhaps something crunchy and some more acidity. As for the main dishes, the duck gyros were really tasty but i wish the duck wrapped inside the pide was more fatty and more recognizably duck.  It could have been steak for all i knew.   The goat-stuffed zucchini and eggplant were tasty also, but not worth 21 dollars.  I would say, at most, 14 dollars for that dish.  It tasted very good and was a good portion size, but it didn't seem creative or refined enough to warrant a 21 dollar price tag.  I mean, it's a traditional dish, and they didn't do anything to class it up more than the plate it was on. Lastly, we had the salep dondurma, or orchid root ice cream, dusted with clumps of pistachio crumbs.  It was some good dondurma (turkish ice cream bound with gum arabic to give it a chewy texture).   The decor is great, as I felt very comfortable the whole night in the space.  The service was good, not great...fulfilled their duties but didn't wow us.  As a whole, I liked my Taxim experience and I will probably try it again in another season, to see how the menu changes.  However, I would rather go to the real Taxim in Istanbul.",0.997,0.785,0.186,0.03,0.5453486394557823

Ya know, the whole not underwhelmed, not overwhelmed situation. A-OK. Adequate. Lovely even, but missing a certain spark I had hoped for.

The decor is classy, gorgeous, and they've done a bang up job with the place.  However, the tables are so close together. This is my ONE pet peeve. Just make it communal dining. I realize this place is ""hot"" right now, but if I have a reservation for 2 on a Saturday night at 7pm, I do NOT want to be smushed between two parties of 4 (older couples) jabbering away, and basically all up in my food. It's just...not comfortable for me. No elbow room, and if you are on the bench side it is nearly impossible to get up to go to the restroom, etc. Pain.  Partially, I think my issue is with the price point. $32 Sea Bass, while well cooked and de-boned for me tableside by David (the owner) himself...was, bland...and accompanied by dandelion salad. (A note, it's bitter and it's not very good. I like almost anything, and couldn't even eat most of it.) So I ate the fish. For that amount of coin, it needed a little more oomph. My friend's duck gyros were a clear winner though, and at around $20, still a bit expensive...if not a walk on the wilder side, and worth the extra bit. Appetizers: Cold eggplant (very good), Lentils (also very, very good...creamy, cold, garlicky), and the ramp/dough pastry type dish that escapes me. Very good. The apps were very much the bright spot of the evening (besides the company!) Desserts: also quite weak (as many reviewers have mentioned). A greek yogurt with honey (wonderful) is better suited for breakfast, and the chocolate cake topped with candied kumquats was...OK. This is definitely something easily remedied, and I encourage them to do so STAT. Dessert can save the day, yo.  Wine list is nice (Greek authentic), and the servers are very knowledgeable.  Service was simply impeccable, and the pace was wonderful. I think I really could get on board with this place. Next time, I'll need a table in the corner, minus dandelions, plus some hella (pun intended) dessert improvement.  A hefty bill for being somewhat disappointed in the desserts and main dish...but I would most definitely recommend friends to try it, and it is worth a looksie if you are bored with traditional Greek Town fare.

2009-06-02,2.0,"Taxim definitely seemed more authentic than all those restaurants down in Greek Town., yet still had a few tricks up its sleeve. One of the great things about Taxim is that it has outdoor seating, so you can enjoy a nice spring or summer day while people watching in Wicker Park. The interior of Taxim is also nice, in case you do not want to sit outside. To start, my wife and I looked over the wine list. My wife ordered a Greek Island Merlot and I ordered a Cypriot Beer. Both were good. Then we proceeded to look over the menu. Taxim's menu is split up into three parts: cold meze (think appetizers), hot mezes. and Mains. Since we are both trying to watch what we eat (to get in shape for the summer) we split one hot and cold meze and each had our own main dish. We started off by splitting the house marinated Kalamata olives and the Koukia Me Kavourma, which was fresh shelled fava beans, lamb confit, and a house-made yogurt. The olives were very good. The Koukia Me Kavourma was essentially a fava bean salad with a few bits of lamb, and a delicious herbal yogurt, but heavy on the fava beans. For main dishes, my wife ordered the Duck Gyro, which consisted of a crispy tortilla roll-up stuffed with roasted marinated duck with a pomegranate glaze ontop a fresh mint, walnut yogurt mousse. The flavor was terrific, maybe even better than terrific, but our duck was a little overdone and tough to eat. Even that did not stop us from devouring it! My main course was a long roll of cooked ground goat, next to a long mound of rice, next to a long strip of greek yogurt. It did not look very appetizing and the flavor although good was nothing exeptional and left me with order envy. But at least we had dessert to look forward to right? Well kind of. There were two options: a Greek yogurt (and at this point we have had 3 different Greek yogurts) or a chocolate semolina halva. Disappointed we declined dessert and went to a local ice cream place close to our house (Bobtail). The food was good (duck Gyro great) as was the service, but the rest of the dishes were only okay and lacked a strong dessert option in our opinion.",0.9904,0.849,0.126,0.025,0.5200230880230879

First the space- it has almost a Moroccan feel with little lanterns hanging from the high ceiling, copper topped tables and bar reflecting the light, huge copper platters lining the walls and lots and lots of velvety gold and burgandy pillows lining the settees.  We had no idea what to order so we put ourselves into the helpful hands of our server , Chris, who didn't steer us wrong all night. First up- 6 of the small plates to share. The menu is broken into cold and hot small plates so we asked for 3 from each.  All were delicious. My favorites were the peppers and cheese, the hummus and the pastry like thing served with some of the best feta cheese I have ever tasted. The others- fava beans, olives and okra were good as well- but if you order nothing else- go for the pastry like dish. I wanted it all to myself but I was good and shared.  On to the entrees. We sampled 5 different ones. I had the duck gyros (unlike anything you could imagine- the pita is grilled and almost crunchy and the duck tender and moist. The sea bass (loup de mer) came with head and tail and they were quick to filet it and re-present it. We also had the lamb (two kinds one a shank and the other more of a kabob) Even the goat was a winner!  There was no room for dessert but I will definitely check that out on my next visit.  Service was great; friendly, attentive and quick with the drinks. The owner stopped by several times to see how we were doing which was also nice. Oh and I should note- they were very accommodating of our group- even pushing our reservation back a bit when we decided we wanted to have one more drink at the place we were at beforehand. I love when the guest comes first!  Mediterranean food in a beautiful setting? Stellar service? A place that cares about your business?

Since we came without a reservation on a Saturday -- and they were fully booked that night -- we had to make do with cafe seating on stools. The tables in the front are pressed right up to the glass -- try to avoid these seats if you can since it's really drafty up there. I was freezing! The service for the stools/tables was wanting. We felt pretty frustrated because we couldn't get our server's attention for the entirety of the two hours we spent there. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and expect that it would be better if seated at a ""normal"" table. Really, though, if you're gonna seat people there for dinner service, you really ought to provide...service. We had a cold roast eggplant mezze with toasted pine nuts. Delicious. We also ordered a pastry with ramps encrusted with nigella seeds and a slice of feta. Also delicious, but at $12, was too expensive for what was given.  Our entrees were fantastic -- I had a braised lamb shank with faro and fennel salad. The faro was tossed with preserved lemon, which was the perfect counter to the rich lamb ($23). Friend had a ""baby vegetables stuffed with lamb."" Also quite good. Both dishes plated, and in the dark light, looked remarkably similar (stuff set on grain pilafs). We thought the two mezze were too expensive, but all told, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and a dessert was $65. A decent value. And we were stuffed. It was too loud for my tastes on a Saturday night -- friend and I had to yell to talk. Not good.

Yes, I'm crazy but this place will make you cray-zee for their food.  I even had the same dishes (hummus, ramp, & chicken entree) both times. Just as good each time. Maybe I'm not crazy, actually.  Now I went to Greece last year for two weeks and none of the food we had was as good as Taxim.  But Taxim is different so don't expect opa's,  flaming cheese or a salad full of tomatoes, onions and feta. They take traditional Greek dishes/ingredients/flavors and enhance them or turn them on their head, in a good way.  I've tasted the duck gyros and other dishes and have smiled with every bite.  The chicken entree' is TO DIE FOR. It's a cripsy, juicy, lemony, buttery party in your mouth (insert joke here). It looks unassuming when it comes out, but soon you'll be groaning with pleasure and slicing chunks off to share with everyone at your table.  The people that ordered the duck gyros will do the same. See, sharing can be fun!  Decor/Experience: From the moment you enter and get a friendly welcome, you realize how nice the decor is. It's hard to tell from the outside what the inside is like.  Less is more there, which is just enough IMO.  Everyone I've dined with noted that they liked the decor and some felt they weren't eating on Milwaukee Ave.  Nice.  Service: Spot-on. Friendly, quick but not annoying or in the way. I had the same server both times I've been there and she was friendly, knowledgeable about the Greek wines (get a free taste!) and even noted that they are getting known for their duck gyros (they must be reading this page).  Someone I was with had a special request (no potatoes) so they substituted those for a nice side salad on his chicken entree.  Again, frickin' spot on with no resistance. Summary:  Go there, get a reservation on the weekend.  Take your friends so they'll have a renewed respect for your dining recommendations. Take people from out of town, even if they haven't had ""greek"" food. There's something for every taste there.",0.9978,0.744,0.217,0.039,0.509077380952381

2009-05-04,5.0,"If I've learned one thing through Yelping, it's that when it comes to food, wine and champagne, always trust Rob L. He will NEVER steer you wrong. Another shining example of his food and wine prowess is finding Taxim. For this, Rob, I will be indebted to you for quite some time!  I walked by Taxim twice before I finally found it. There's no sign outside and the store front on Milwaukee is pretty nondescript. But when you walk in you are treated to absolutely beautiful surroundings. It's small, but gorgeous. High ceilings, luxe chandeliers and copper-topped tables fill the space that's lined with booth seating and lots of comfy pillows. Definitely NOT your typical cheesy, Greektown decor.  The food... oh my God... the food. It's just delicious. When you think Greek food, you think mousaka and pastitsio.  If you're looking for Saganaki, you're not going to find it.  Taxim takes Greek food to a seriously upscale place, so leave your preconceived notions at the door. We did a few appetizers and small plates to get started. The shining stars for me were the lentils with feta cheese and some kind of turnover served with sharp feta cheese. Your mama's lentils, these are not! They're so soft and flavorful and are served with just the right amount of cheese. The turnover was amazing as well. The crust was soft and the sharp, salty feta was the perfect accompaniment.  Entrees were phenomenal, too. I ordered the 1/4 chicken, which came perfectly seared on the outside, so moist on the inside and just the right amount of lemony seasoning. Served with fingerling potatoes and roasted garlic cloves, it was heaven on a plate. We also sampled the roasted lamb on a skewer, which completely changed my mind about lamb. When lamb is well seasoned and cooked perfectly, it's a great protein. I'm glad I got to experience lamb the way it should be done!  Desserts are nothing to scoff at, either. Our chocolate cake was wonderful, but my favorite was the Greek yogurt with honey and candied almonds. So unexpected, so light... the perfect finish to an amazing meal.

The high archways and the lanterns were beautiful. For a restaurant that just opened, the look of the place was very polished. They also had some great Moorish sounding music playing, but with the bare brick walls and high ceilings, it was barely audible in the main dining area over the noise of the patrons. Despite the loud dining room, Taxim is a perfect setting for a romantic dinner for two or a girls night with eight friends. The food and wine were fantastic. I definitely recommend the green lentil warm appetizer. It was such a simple dish, but the flavor and texture was phenomenal. I also thought the duck gyros were excellent. Both dishes I can see myself ordering again and again. The service was slow, but pleasant and attentive. Because of the slow dining pace here, I would definitely recommend having a reservation. We'll be back and hopefully by our next visit a certain kink will have been worked out. I was a disappointed to see that there was no 3 or 6 course tasting menu that's been advertised in the paper and online. I even asked about it when I made my reservation four days prior and they assured me it would be available. So if you want to try the tasting menu, be sure to call ahead to see if it's available and if they say it is, just know they're probably lying.

My Sunday evening experience at Taxim served two fabulous purposes; one was to celebrate the fabulous Rob L.'s birthday while the other was to ring in a very festive Greek Easter (uh, purely coincidental). Coincidence, yes, however it did work in our favor as our phenomenal meal there was comprised of a speciality Easter five course prix fixe menu boasting some of the best and most standout dishes on the Taxim menu in combination with special 'delicacies' and a bit of showboating too... ahem, carving a roasted lamb on a marble slab in the middle of the restaurant? Yes, Chef David... you're not only adorable but full of flair!  The restaurant is impeccably decorated in the most simple yet glamorous fashion - the ideal compliment to the decadent food! Gorgeous bronze lanterns hang from every surface of the ceiling casting gorgeous diamond shaped reflections on everything... lush velvet pillows, gleaming white marble floors, beautiful high-back dark wood chairs set beside bronzed tabletops... In a word, it's SEXY. Super lusty thrusty fabulously lit. Sexy.  You know what else is sexy? Expertly prepared Greek fare without the cheese. No, not that cheese. The cheesiness that is most of our current Greektown establishments. Taxim successfully pulls a one over and modernizes the Greek experience with class and taste. Mmmm speaking of taste...  Be sure to pop a bottle of Greek bubbly - similar to Moscato - prior to your first taste of items like the Rokasalata - a delightful starter salad of baby arugula and pan-seared haloumi doused in a mint-lemon vinaigrette. So fresh and citrusy with that hint of salty, gooey baked cheese... trés delicious! Next move on two total treasures: the Faki - warm lentils with sheeps feta and a balsamic reduction and the Rampopita - the crusty phyllo encrusted braised leeks with fresh garlic and dill atop a little pillow of feta... Oh Em Gee!!! I could easily make a to-die-for meal of simply these dishes, but of course there's more! We had the house speciality that night of roasted lamb with warm pita, housemade tzatziki and roasted potatoes - delish! Such amazing comfort food and served with such generosity, there was easily enough for 10 people, but alas, we only had 4... I hear that the duck gyros (complete with pomegranate glaze and walnut yogurt mousse) are also not to be missed, and I intend to find out!  Taxim was so all-encompassing, so spot on, so.... perfect, that my original group has already secured a second reservation to go back. How's that for a first impression?!

2009-04-20,5.0,"Before ever stepping into a place, do you ever feel like, ""Tonight, will tonight be better than alright? Yes, tonight will be something spectacular and special."" After being here once, I was craving to come back. I was excited to think about visiting Taxim one more time. They did such an ""wow"" factor on me that first time, impressing me with food, style, service backed with plenty of substance, I needed to find a time to come back.  Last night I did. Celebrating my birthday, (um, yeah... you missed it), and with three other April babies, (Brett D, Caroline A and Matt C), we descended to dine on a stormy, chilly rain soaked night to celebrate our fortuitous births. I hope next time I go Mother Nature could at least cut out on the precipitation. A few weeks ago I had called and made reservations, (and if you plan on going, especially the weekends, I would do so, apparently they are getting packed!), and let them know I wanted to come in for my birthday and to ask a few questions. Now, I know when I first went, there was no sparkling, very necessary to us to help ring in our special days, and asked if we could bring in a bottle, but to my surprise their Greek sparkling had just arrived for service. Great. Plans were made, reservation was set, mouth started to water. Fast forward to the day of, I got a call from David, the owner, confirming my reservation, wishing me a happy birthday, reminding me that they still had sparkling, (nice memory recall!), and to let me know that since it was Greek Easter, they would be having a special 5 course meal planned where they were grilling two whole lambs. Excellent! I let my dining compatriots know the new turn of events, and really it couldn't have gone better. Sitting down, we ordered the dinner along with three small plates from the regular menu to start off with, the gluttony began! We started off with a hot plate of baby okra, sun dried tomatoes in a little olive oil. So simple, so wonderful and okra gained a few new fans. We had the ""hummus"" the pureed chickpeas, garlicky and lemony but oh so delicious. Finally we had the lentils. Yes. Lentils. O. M. G. Get them. Slightly sweet, savory, matched with creamy and salty feta, they was amazing. Whether we dived in with pita bread or simply on a spoon, we couldn't get enough. Then the real deal started. The first course was a simple salad, peppery mixed greens, a vinaigrette with a zing of lemons cut and balanced the saltiness of the seared haloumi cheese. Needless to say, the first bite was savored, the bites after that were inhaled. The second course was the rampapita, the phyllo dough stuffed with ramps and served with a feta with olive oil and lemon juice over it. Proud member of the clean plate club here. Now, the third course simply said that it was a Greek specialty. Hmmmm okay... well, now we know why it was. Brought out on a tray, on a skewer, was the specialty, a delicacy. The heart, the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, the entrails wrapped in the small intestine and then char grilled. We looked at each other, some with nervousness, a hint of trepidation and a splash of scared thrown in, but our gastronomicness got the best and we chowed down. Splashed with some lemon, wrapped in a pita, slathered with a little eggplant, it was really good. This coming from someone who still has nightmares from the time dear ol' mom made us liver and onions. *shivers* Then the main course, oh me oh my... a huge family style plate of roasted lamb and potatoes with homemade tzatziki sauce and pitas. By this point we were fairly full, but the amount that was there begged to be noshed on a little. We ate. We savored. Tender, soft, succulent, amazing. Then finally we waddled our way to dessert. Food babies growing inside of us, we trudged on to finish off our chocolate cardamom cakes, with chantilly cream. Somehow, albeit not to our growing stomach waist lines content, but certainly to our tastebuds, we finished our dinner. Looked around and waddled out.  Before we left, David stopped by, wished me a happy birthday, thanked us for coming and asked us to come on by again. Oh... don't you worry, we will be back. Oh yes... we will be back indeed!",0.9988,0.802,0.168,0.031,0.4873342781879367
2009-04-20,5.0,"This is a fabulous Greek restaurant. Like others have said, it is not the typical Greek-town type restaurant, not that they are not good, but Taxim is not cut from the same mold, and is rather unique. The decor is impressive, the owner paid such attention to detail with the beautiful lighting, copper bar and table tops, and the arches......I love arches.  The food is equally as impressive. Unique combinations of flavors will please. All four of us were delighted with the food. We tried three appetizers and entrees, and all were quite good, with my favorites being the phyllo appetizer stuffed with ramp (wild onions) and feta, and the duck gyros entree. The wait staff was great - very knowledgeable and attentive, and the owner is hands on. He came to our table and answered all our questions and filled us in on his concept for the restaurant along with alot of interesting Greek history that influenced the incarnation. I can't wait to return to try more of the menu and chill in the lovely byzantine atmosphere.",0.9952,0.723,0.255,0.022,0.6358695652173914
2009-04-11,5.0,"The food and decor was fabulous!  We got the revithia, like hummus, (pureed chickpeas, garlic, lemon, sauteed fresh green chickpeas) but tasted very greek. it was very fresh, not heavy.  The rampopita (ramp, green garlic, fresh dill, goat feta, and house-made phyllo) was perfect especially with the goat feta.  The house-made yogurt and main dishes we got were delicious too.  One of the best parts was the dessert.  We got the chocolate semolina halva with cardamom syrup, candied blood orange, and chantilly cream.  The halva was moist, not too dense, dark chocolaty and the cream was so light and wonderful.  there were walnuts that gave a little crunch.  The owner/chef was very attentive and went around to our table and others to make sure everything was good.  Great service!  I would definitely go back for sure.  The owner said they're getting a wood burning oven in the next few weeks and going to add more to their menu.",0.9949,0.729,0.271,0.0,0.5658119658119658
2009-04-08,5.0,"A rave. A RAVE review from me.  It's no secret that I love Greek food so when I heard that a Hellenic bite was moving to my block, I was already excited.   The biggest thing I walked away with after eating roughly 60% of the menu with 3 girlfriends: this place is not trying to be Greektown. This is Greek food translated for the neighborhood, not a replacement. The restaurant itself is beautiful with a collection of metal lanterns decoration archways.  I also liked that the main seating area was set back away from the busy of Milwaukee Ave.  Although that location makes it extra-accessible. Onto the food (finally right?): Started with peppers, olives, eggplant in yogurt sauce and some phyllo, green onion and dill deliciousness. All good but then there was the hummus.  Best I've had, tied with Semiramis I think. Crisp and creamy at the same time somehow. For dinner the four of us split the duck gyro and as Rob noted below, that's a must-order.  More great yogurt sauce for dipping and a nice balance between savory meat and sweet pomagranate marinade.  We also ordered the whole-roasted fish which Henry filleted for us.  moist, flavorful and light without feeling scant.  It was a tough choice though and I'm looking forward to trying the chicken on my return and hopefully a summer moussaka special! Dessert was tough because we were full but couldn't resist.  We went with the chocolate cardamom cake with chantilly cream.  It came with a full bowl of extra cream on the side after I made a few comments to Henry (seriously, the full wait staff seemed lovely but try to get into his section).  Then we were gifted with the other dessert choice because ""You have to try it, you'll love it."" Greek yogurt thinned out with honey and kumquats.  Even Eden had a SoupBox.   Throughout dinner we had a few different kinds of wine, all of which are Greek, all of which were tasty and none of with I remember beyond St. George. Bottom Line: It's been a while since I had such a complete experience from a brand new spot.  If this is what we're starting with, what shall we expect when they're ROOF DECK opens? Why did I just tell Yelp that? I meant to keep that part to myself...",0.9915,0.841,0.126,0.033,0.4851141282959465
