Located in the historic Monadnock building which is worth a look see.  This is a very narrow review as I did not have lunch only a drink.   Dark comfortable pub like atmosphere.  No Wi-Fi.   Obviously a go-to place for lawyers and related folks as it is located near the correctional facility and federal buildings.  Obviously lots of regulars, judging by the greetings from the bartender.  Sat down at the bar and was waited on promptly. No complaints there. Specifically asked for a Tanqueray and Tonic while I considered eating lunch there.  Bartender gave me my requested drink, sans lime wedge.  Who serves a G&T without a lime?  After tasting the drink, decided against eating lunch there. I was NOT given Tanqueray as requested but whatever the house rail gin was.  yuck.  Weak drink to boot - $8.  If you're going to serve weak drinks at least use some decent booze!   Again this is a very narrow review and doesn't include the food.",-0.69,0.872,0.053,0.074,0.47522875816993476

My colleague had a vegetarian dish, and raved about it.  At a pub/bar -- right??!  Awesome.  We both had that sweet tooth after dinner and got the cheesecake.  Just the right portion and awesome!  Their wines -- cab and sauvignon blanc were great.  Lots of beers to choose from too.

Tucked away in the very cool, old monadnock building sits Cavanaugh's, a pub/restaurant that hasn't changed since 1989 when it opened.  This is the place your new boss would have taken you to lunch in 1991 when you got your first post-college job.  The wallpaper, complete with borders is still the same.  The wood floor is original from when the building was built. They have real booths and bus boys bring you fresh hot bread as you are seated.  Gluten free you ask?  Ha, get real!  Nope but if you want a big bowl of comfort food goodness, get the mac and cheese with peas and ham.  Their version of calamari is delish and a screaming deal at under $10.  You get a large portion of very lightly fried calamari tossed with hot giardiniere.  Thank you god.  Their soups are homemade and they have three a day.  Their Italian wedding soup is good as is their corn chowder. After work, come here and belly up to the bar with work friends and order some tater tots with your beer or get an old fashioned paired with their very good hummus. Their wait staff are all wonderful.  Professional servers at what I think may be a dying breed of a sit-down restaurant in a major city with low menu prices.  Go here and keep these types of indie restaurants in business.  Dear lord we have enough conveyor type food places serving protein bowls with plastic forks!!!!",0.9888,0.81,0.162,0.028,0.48616482283148943

This review easily could have been a 1 star rating had it not been for the customer service I had received.  As I say, first impressions matter and I was definitely impressed during my first visit to Cavanaughs. To top things off, I ordered a banana creme pie because my friends were treating me to celebrate my birthday.  The banana creme pie was DELICIOUS!!!!!!! One of the best pies I've had!

I used to bounce around the menu a lot, but now I get the same thing every time- the grilled chicken sandwich. It comes with a slice of ham and swiss cheese melted on it. The real reason I get the sandwich is for the cajun dipping sauce that comes on the side. Its pink, slightly sweet and incredible. I would drink this sauce out of a pint glass if it was socially acceptable.  They also have a really good mix on the diet cokes.

2008-10-07,3.0,"I am not a big fan of their food, but the atmosphere is perfect for a business lunch or meeting if you're working in the loop. Very classic Chicago - the restaurant is nestled amongst other classic urban options such a shoe repair shop and boutique clothing spots. It's like stepping back in time when you enter this building.  The food is, at times, disappointing. They always advertise a quiche of the day, and I swear every time I go there and order the quiche they tell me they are out. FYI - if you are going to run out of quiche before lunchtime even starts, then please do not keep putting in on your lunch specials menu! Thank you.",0.9187,0.804,0.141,0.055,0.33981481481481485

They recently changed their menu, I'm not a huge fan but the food is good, I just think it could be better.  I usually just go here to drink after work, and it's my favorite spot in the loop.",0.9603,0.628,0.326,0.045,0.655
2008-08-13,4.0,"I went here last night with a couple of my co-workers.  We were just kind of wandering down Jackson looking for food on our way from work to Grant Park for the movie.  One of my co-workers had been here before and thought it was pretty good so we went.   I was mostly impressed.  My bacon cheeseburger was really good.  They put a ton of bacon on it!  My friends enjoyed their rueben and grilled chicken sandwich. My only complaints are about the spicy cheese and spinach dip - it wasn't very spicy (and I'm incredibly sensitive to spicy foods).  It pretty much tasted like nacho cheese and creamed spinach mixed together.  It also has a vague resemblance to green paint.  The acoustics were also a problem.  It wasn't very crowded at all, but it sounded like there was a full house.  All the wood makes this place really echo-y.",0.9259,0.831,0.138,0.032,0.5802777777777778

This place has been around for evahhhhhhhh and it has a huge, steady lunch crowd.  While I was there late afternoon there were some bodies assembled, including a federal judge whom I know, enjoying some food and beverage. Bar service was spot on.  See when its not busy is when one usually gets the crappy McCrapper service so I dared her to dis me.  And she didn't.  Friendly, cheerful.  Great Potato Leek Soup (one of my favorite things on earth!) and decent menu.  Really good burger and fast!  Not a fake Irish bar, a nice bar with an Irish name.   Decent wine selection and a clean environment.  Took a minute for my check but hey, there was a mini rush.  And bartender gave me a newspaper to read....which is a personal favorite thingy......",0.8703,0.82,0.121,0.059,0.6333333333333332

2008-01-11,3.0,"If you work in the area and can find you way through the building and into Cavanaugh's this is a decent place to come for lunch. It's usually busy, but I have never had to wait for a table.  The food is solid, and served in pretty big portions for the price, and the service is average. The ceaser salad is excellent and huge, but the burgers are just okay.  Plymouth, right around the corner, is a better choice if you want a burger and they don't tend to overcook them like Cavanaugh's does.",0.9753,0.763,0.237,0.0,0.5456709956709956
2007-09-19,3.0,"Went here for a lunch date and was surprised that i even found the place. it's down a little side street off jackson. I had read the burgers were good so we both got one. I ordered mine medium rare but i think it cooked more under the heating lamps waiting to be picked up. other than being a little overcooked, it was pretty good. i really liked the fries. we were there at 1 and the place was almost empty. a good place for a last minute sit-down lunch in the loop. there was only one waitress but she was pretty quick with the refills",0.9722,0.773,0.212,0.016,0.6253267973856209

It's a rustic, dark, wood interiored bar and grill place with the irish pub feel to it. There's a few TV screens airing games and it is comfortably located in downtown. On a hot humid day, it is calm, quiet, cool, and nestled comfortably away from the loud busy lunchtime streets of Chicago.",0.959,0.767,0.233,0.0,0.5987179487179487
