Ended up getting a few drinks and having dinner.  All I have to say is that they have been in biz for 22 years for a reason. Cannot go wrong eating here!  You can always tell a good Italian restaurant by its bread...  and that bread - with the side of oil and roasted garlic - was excellent. And it only continued from there.  Quaint, warm ambiance, great food - what more can you ask for on a Friday night?! The answer is 'nothing'.",0.9133,0.803,0.15,0.047,0.6032407407407407

2017-05-18,5.0,"Wow, I was so impressed with delivery from Tarantino's! It was amazing how well the food traveled, and I'm sure this place will become a regular on my dinner rotation.  First main was the pork chop (9/10), which had beautiful char marks from the grill and came bone-in. Juicy, tender and perfect if you're craving a big hunk of meat. It was served on a bed of mashed potatoes, jus and cabbage, with a grape chutney that lent a refreshing acidity to the dish. Next up was the fusilli pasta (9/10), which had a surprising amount of flavor despite only using a few ingredients. Creamy yet sweet and spicy, the sauce was seamlessly integrated with the pasta and sausage.  This place is a big win if you're too lazy to make or go out for dinner but still looking for something out of the ordinary.",0.9381,0.845,0.144,0.012,0.5705942205942206

2017-05-09,5.0,"Location/Atmosphere: This restaurant is located by several other stores, restaurants, and other types of businesses in the Lincoln Park area.  Both metered street parking and valet ($10) parking is available if you are driving here.  CTA train and bus lines are super close by as well.  The interior of the restaurant has several tables and a full bar for seating purposes, but a reservation is highly recommended since it gets pretty crowded.  The exposed brick and relaxed lighting provides an ideal atmosphere for a date night.   Drinks: This place has a nice wine list (mostly by the bottle), but there are cocktails and beer on the menu as well.  The negroni I ordered was well done, and the sazerac was amazing.  I would rate the sazerac to be a 10/10 due to how well balanced it was.   Food: We shared the fried calamari, and I ordered the black linguine as my main dish.  The fried calamari was put on top of a fresh marinara sauce and topped with chopped olives.  This is an appetizer I would likely get again during another visit.  The black linguine is a great option for seafood lovers and has a fantastic flavor to it.

We figure it's kind of hot out anyway so we don't say anything. We sat for about 10 minutes before any waitress or anyone came over to us. This gave us time to already decide on our appetizers. We ordered 2 appetizers as we ordered wine. I had to ask for water 3 times before I got one. We finally got bread and she brought over our wine. We placed our orders. Anytime you waned water, you had to try and flag someone down and it seemed impossible. After a while, we almost finished our first bottle of wine and ordered another. She brought it over and was about to start pouring it into my dads glass and he had to mention to her that he needed to taste it first and didn't want her to pour it into his current glass of wine (just in case the new bottle was corked. This is just common knowledge). All of us at our table were discussing how hungry we were and how long it was taking to get our appetizers. At one point we had to ask the hostess if she could get our waitress for us because we hadn't seen her in so long. She finally came over with our meals. My dad proceeded to say thanks, but I don't want my meal yet because we wanted out appetizers first. She completely forgot. She said they had been sitting in the back and she just never went and brought them to us. She asked if she should bring them out and take back our meals. Um, no thank you, I'd rather eat my meal while it's hot than let it go sit back in the kitchen while we eat our appetizers that have been sitting for 45 minutes.

We arrived late on a Sunday, table for 5, all of us showing up at different times. We were accommodated rapidly, not ushered to the bar and told that the entire party had to be there.  This is a big thing for me, because I find it annoying when restaurants make you wait for the entire party, luckily I guess this place was not busy. The hostess gave her recommendations, as did our server. Our party had someone who wanted the Rigatoni without the tomatoes, not only did they leave the tomatoes off, but they switched the creamy tomato sauce out for him. Someone else in our party really wanted spaghetti  and meatballs, which are not on the menu. The server went to the kitchen and returned informing us they would be able to make it for him. So kudus for the restaurant being super friendly, very accommodating, and very fast. The food was pretty good too. Although the butternut squash ravioli, a beloved dish by my wife, was not very good, I'd pass on that. I ordered the fusili which was spicy enough, filled with sausage. We also got the arugula salad, which to me was more meh. Overall, great place to dine. Great service. Good food. Kind of pricey.

2014-09-09,3.0,"Torn between 3 and 4 stars... I enjoyed their simple menu and wasn't overwhelmed by a million choices. We were greeted kindly upon arrival (and exit) and seated promptly Saturday evening and the place was quite busy, with just a few empty tables. We had the eggplant parm to start, and it was delicious. Perfectly seasoned and cooked, and not heavy or greasy at all. However, this took a tad long to come. We waited for our entrees for around 40 minutes and we were starving, so we asked for the bread, which came right away. Now I know why it's only available upon request, because this was one of the best bread I've had. It was super fresh and the accompanied olive oil/eggplant pairing was delish. Our waitress was nice and checked up on us adequately, although never to update us on our status of food or to address the empty bread basket (guess they are stingy with that). She really only ever asked us if we were good on drinks. Our food finally came, and am glad that it came piping hot...so at least it wasn't just sitting at the counter all this time. Either they had some mishaps, have a small kitchen, or it really takes that long to cook our food, but likely the former two. Our waters were constantly refilled though which is always a plus in my book. I had the black linguine and everything was pretty good. I had three giant shrimps that were cooked perfectly. There were many mussels, although small which were also cooked well. The sauce was a light spicy marinara that was perfectly proportioned to my pasta. My bf's butternut squash risotto was amazing and might get that myself next time. It was also nice to see the portions being quite satisfactory. Would definitely come back for the food, but if slow service again, I'm not so sure I would return after that. Also felt that they are more overpriced than need be. Average entrée cost is $20-23, but feel that the upper teens would be the usual overpriced cost for a nice Italian place.",0.995,0.803,0.166,0.031,0.5586233211233211

Our server was very friendly and attentive, always coming by to check up on us. Comp bread is upon request, and we could understand why. It was soft and delish, texture was almost perfect.  We ordered the egg parm for appetizer, which was special of the day. It took a while for it to come. It was quite tasty, and surprisingly not heavy. Our actual entrees, however, took even longer. Much longer. Sometimes, I get it feels longer than it really is when you are waiting. But, no. We were actually in conversation for most of the time, but still eventually at some point realized our food still hasn't came. Throughout this time, our server was still consistently checking up on us, but it would have been nice if she updated us on our dinner as well. I'm not sure if that was the norm, because it may have seemed they have a small kitchen, and everything was made to order. Which is fine, but at least give us a status though.  When our entrees did come, it was pretty tasty. Portion sizes were pretty generous as well. My stomach was satisfied. Also, the dinner menu is pretty simple and short. But sometimes, it's nice to keep it that way. No fuss or indecisiveness.  The setting is cozy and comfortable. They also have outdoor seating as well.

Who does that? Waitress left us with empty glasses for half the night, dirty dishes for the other half.

He asked if we wanted wine, but we had never been given a wine menu so... more waiting while he went to find one. When he came back again to take the order, we asked what beer was on tap but he didn't know and had to go check... more waiting. When we followed up with ""what kind of goose island"" he didn't know. (He seemed confused when we followed up with.. ""is it the 312, the Green Line?). The timing of the meal was off from then on. Our appetizer came before our drinks. Our food came about 30 minutes after we had finished our appetizers. The waiter never came to ask if we wanted any other drinks after our meal arrived (especially annoying because I told him that I would order wine with my meal when he first took our order). We also never got bread with our meal, which he said was because it was 'in the oven.' When they finally brought it out, we were just about finished with our meals.

The calamari was soggy, the fish and potatoes were dry, and the shrimp was cooked in a way that there was absolutely no flavor. The pasta was okay but left a lot to be desired. I'm not much of a foodie, but this was bad even by normal dining standards. I had a better meal at coco pazzo cafe for lunch yesterday ($10 sandwich), and a better meal today at go roma ($7 sandwich). I'm also not a wine expert, so I usually go for one of the cheaper wines on the menu, which is fine at a Prosecco or Coco Pazzo, but my advice would be to steer clear of the cheap bottle of Chardonnay at Tarrantino's. I drank one and a half glasses (it was awful), my date had maybe one or two sips. All in all, $110 including tip for one of the most awful restaurant meals I've ever experienced.

I always thought it looked cute and wanted to try but then I'd forget all about it and go somewhere else.  Keri had recently been here, loved it, and wanted to go back, so we decided to eat here last night. It was just the right choice for a Sunday night; it was lively in here, but not loud, and the atmosphere exuded warmth. We each started with a glass of red wine while we looked over the menu; a Napa Cabernet for her, and a Lodi Zinfandel for me. Their wine list was small, but thoughtfully chosen. For starters, I opted for the carpaccio and she ordered a Caesar salad. The appetizers were very good, but not so filling that we'd ruin our appetites.  I had a hard time deciding between the tagliatelle with vegetables and the butternut squash ravioli, but since Keri was ordering the ravioli, it just made sense that I shouldn't order the same thing since I knew she'd give me a taste. To that we also ordered some polenta fries which we 'd share.  Our mains arrived and mine looked even better than the menu described. It was fettucine-like noodles in a light garlic-olive oil sauce, positively brimming over with colorful, sauteed vegetables. The sauce was delicate and could have used a little bit more garlic, but the vegetables were full of flavor. I counted no less than eight different ones used: spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, peas, carrots, zucchini, asparagus, and red and yellow peppers. I absolutely loved it.  Keri's pasta was equally as good, if a tad rich, but it was a butter-sage sauce, so richness was to be expected. Her pasta had a nice balance of flavors though - sweet from the squash, buttery from the sauce, herby from the sage, and nutty from the parmesan and pine nuts. I'm not sure I could have eaten such a decadent dish for my entree, but a half-order as an appetizer would be ideal.  We were halfway through our pastas when the server tried to bring over an order of truffle fries. While they looked great, we explained that we ordered polenta fries. It was another ten minutes before the polenta fries were brought to us, but our server said she would comp them since we had to wait so long. That was appreciated.  We declined to order dessert since we were both full, but I did note that they have profiteroles on the dessert menu, which is one of my favorites, so I'll be sure and save room next time I come here.  Service was gracious and efficient (save for the polenta fries snafu).

Thoroughly enjoyed walking around the Lincoln Park neighborhoods and Tarantino's strikes me as being a nice, neighborhood kind of place.

The Beet Salad with a generous helping of arugula, green apples, walnuts and gorgonzola cheese was one of my favorite dishes on our trip to Chicago. The Arugula Salad with a risotto cake and shaved parmesan was also simple and excellent. There were no weak points on the entrees (we chose a daily special), side dishes and we ordered Chianti by the glass. Beautiful dining atmosphere with brick walls and low lighting. On a warm evening the patio was very popular, but we dined inside.  We were sitting in a row of tables for two and they are a little cramped. I would have loved a little more space rather than hear the intimate details of my neighbors remodeling plans.

2010-08-17,2.0,"My girlfriend and I have been driving by Tarantino's for months and have been excited to try this little Italian restaurant on Armitage. With the weather now warm, we finally went the other night without making a reservation. When we showed up, all the tables outside were full and the inside was rented out for a private event. We wanted to eat outside anyway and the owner was very quick to get us a table (we waited 4 minutes). That was the best service we received for the rest of the night as there was only one waitress for about 12 tables in the outside area. The bread we were served was awesome, but I was disappointed by the beer selection (which included Newcastle and Harp on draft, bud light, Heineken and a couple other domestics by the bottle). I know it is an Italian restaurant, but the beer selection was still brutal. The menu was fairly extensive and had dishes from farfalle pasta to braised lamb shank. I ordered fried oysters with spicy mayo and pico de gallo for an appetizer and salmon with greenbeans and corn/bean salsa as the main course. My girlfriend ordered a braised pork chop and a garden salad. The oysters were great, very well done and the sauce was amazing, the salad was also very good. I wish I had ordered another appetizer because the entrée took 50 minutes to arrive as we snacked on bread. My salmon was overcooked, the greenbeans were very plain and the salsa was not fresh. I have never asked a waiter to return my food, this was a first, and I felt like a jerk doing it, but for an expensive Italian restaurant the entrée was unacceptable. I got my meal replaced with a farfalle pasta dish that arrived in five minutes. The pasta was undercooked and the sauce was tasty, but there was nothing special about it. I felt that I could cook the same pasta dish at home for 1/10 the price. The pork chop was better than my overcooked salmon, but the side of mashed potatoes was a little cold. It was hard to get the waitresses' attention for water refills and additional glasses of wine as she was the only one out there. They could have used at least one more person on staff that night. The owner was very nice and it seemed that there were plenty or regulars there with whom he sat down and chatted with. At the end of our 2 hours 15 minute meal, I was extremely disappointed with my meal-especially after wanting to try it for so long.

Of all the times I've passed (hundreds) and never come in, I never would have expected it to be so modern and open on the inside. It's perfectly decorated and lit, and has an old Chicago-style ceiling that I love.  The first course of mojito martinis ripened our appetites, and prepared us stiffly for the amazing meal to follow.  Appetizers of Heirloom Tomatoes and Parmesan Shrimp were both portioned quite well; not too large, not too small. They were both superbly complimented with contrasting flavors. The Parmesan Shrimp were simply awesome.  The Black Linguini and special Shrimp and Vegetable Risotto were fantastic. That's basically all there is to say.  Also, get the Chocolate Molten Cake... And now, a word about our waiter. Thomas was his name and he was spectacular. I think he is the best waiter my girlfriend and I have had in a very long time. He gave us time, never rushed us.

2010-01-16,4.0,"Fab neighborhood restaurant in Lincoln Park. Very nice bar area which was incredibly busy and crowded when we went (a Friday night). There was a real nice buzz and atmosphere. Service was a bit disorganized while we waited for our table which was 30 minutes late but they did give us our drinks free which helped! :) Magarita was fine and Martini pretty good. The calamari was tasty, light and avoided being too chewy. The mussels were a great appetizer, plump with enough zing to make them really tasty. For entrees the salmon was light and flaky (huge portion) and the rack of lack perfectly cooked to medium rare.  the lamb had great flavors and was sooo tender. The potatoes were a bit average though. Good wine list and nice to see them focus more on Italian choices rather than just the usual US suspects. The Amerone was a top choice. All in all a really nice restaurant. We'll be back for sure.",0.9945,0.661,0.287,0.052,0.6549603174603175

The first time, it was hectic; our server was clearly overwhelmed and over-sat. Our drinks were delayed and almost forgotten. The second time, however, the service was nice and laid back. Our server was attentive, helpful, and funny. She definitely seemed knowledgeable with regard to the wine list and menu, and offered various pairing suggestions. I have had the rigatoni with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, proscuitto, and peas in a cream and parmesan cheese sauce and the fusilli with sausage in a spicy tomato cream sauce. I liked the look and sound of the fuisilli better, but I preferred the rigatoni. Both are definitely good. And actually I think the fusilli makes better leftovers than the rigatoni; which brings me to another point worth mentioning: the portions are nice and generous. The pizzas are delish, more like a traditional Northern Italian pizza - very, very thin, not so saucy. Reminded me of the pizzas they serve at Volare, which are even better. Not a fan of the Caesar Salad - very bland.  Also, a member of my party ordered the lamb shank medium rare and it was cooked practically well done, which was definitely disapointing.

Not sure if it was my utmost devotion to my favorite Italian (La Scarola) or just coincidence...  Either way, I finally ventured inside last week for a last minute dinner with a friend. I was somewhat surprised by how small it was, it looked bigger to me from the outside. It's just one room with exposed brick, a small bar and nice low lighting. Pictures on the wall provide some history of the area and the family that owns the place.  The menu had lots of familiar favorite staples.... my Beef Carpaccio appetizer was perfect.... good beefy flavor with a generous helping of filet, lots of parmesan and arugula. Mmmm. I had the butternut squash ravioli for my main course... it came topped with toasty pine nuts, roasted butternut squash and a sage butter sauce. Mama Mia it melted in my mouth and was as smooth as...well...buttah! My friend had the pork chop and it was HUGE with a sweet and tart anise sauce.  Everything was timed well and our server Tom was a doll!

2007-06-19,2.0,"Went to Tarantino's last week and was quite disappointed.  The service was incredibly slow, taking 45 mins to receive our entrees -- the excuse was that the additional tables on the patio in summer overloaded the kitchen's capacity.  In my opinion, if the kitchen can't handle the load, why add the tables? I ordered the salmon with portobella mushrooms and spinach.  It was incredibly salty and ultimately a very boring dish.  My boyfriend ordered the cornish hen which was basically a couple boney drumsticks with a few small cubes of polenta.  There simply wasn't enough food to qualify as an entree! When the server finally checked in on us, I politely let her know that I was a bit disappointed (citing the reasons above).  She subequently brought over the manager and I reiterated my feelings.  Like ""Sarah B.""'s review below, I was surprised that the manager wasn't more interested in fixing the situation - maybe a complimentary dessert or glass of wine?  NADA. In short, Tarantino's is a let down.  With all the good Italian restaurants in Chicago, this one isn't worth going to, despite the great Armitage location and nicely decorated interior space.",-0.6207,0.842,0.071,0.087,0.49219576719576724

I can't even eat this stuff.""  He told me that he completely understood & would void out my charge & rip up my bill.  He also told me to ask specifically for him next time I called/came in.
