2017-07-11,4.0,"Pretty neat spot with a cool nautical theme and some nice menu options. Two visits ago I had the Philly cheese steak, which I remember being a little disappointed by...I think it was that the food didn't come out as hot as expected. The last time I was there I had the fish and chips, which was really, really good. It came with two fairly big battered pieces of cod, some hot and crispy steak fries, a mound of coleslaw, and tartar sauce. The coleslaw ran around most of the plate, which would have been a problem if it tasted bad, but it tasted great. Would definitely order again, and/or go back for their all you can eat fish fry night.  They have some nice looking salads too from what I could see at other tables. Also they have a few tables outside where you can sit with your dog, which is great, although it's not a huge space (3 somewhat tightly packed tables). They do seem pretty dog friendly though.",0.9843,0.761,0.194,0.044,0.5657619047619048

The food is (in Cookie Monster voice) gooooooood. I don't even like breakfast food and I can't get enough of this place.  - Bottomless Mimosas for $10- $20 I don't think you could ask for more you really don't have to because they fill up your glass constantly. I'm so glad I took a Lyft to this place because there's no way I could drive home after that. Maybe I'm a lush but after a while I said hey just hold the sugary orange juice and give me straight champagne. Lol   - Its a comfortable place to sit and catch up with a friend, eat alone, or watch the game.  - The crowd does not mingle but as good as the food is I don't think you need them too. You can enjoy yourself all by yourself.  Cons- Honestly, I can always find an area of opportunity but I really like this place.

The ribs I ordered were badly burnt and not good at all. We asked the waiter to bring us 2 burgers instead. The burgers were very good.

Big plus for us is that it's within walking distance from where we live.  We were greeted by the bartender when we walked in and decided to sit at the bar.  The bar was otherwise full with patron and maybe a few tables inside and a few outside on the patio.  We were there just to have a few drinks, which we did.  They have a pretty decent beer selection both draft & bottle/can.   After a drink or two we ordered an app to share, as we were looking for a pull dinner.  While the menu had what seemed to be good variety and great options, we decided on the bacon wrapped fried potatoes.  This was a recommendation from the bartender when we asked her to help us decide.  Let me say...they did not disappoint.  The patron next to us even ordered them after he saw and smelled ours.  The potatoes were crispy and bacon was cooked to perfection around them. The overall décor, I'd say was divey nautical with a twist. Casual, but comfortable. It's dimly lit, but with the multiple large screened tvs that were running it was fine.  It was a bit warm the night we stopped in and the patio doors were open making it humid & warm in the restaurant, too.  About 30 minutes in, we felt the air kick on and it didn't shut off the remainder of the time we were there.

Nice, friendly, and useless. Decor: Nice boat assclown. Drink: This is not a good beer selection, Tom Waits and Steinbeck on 48 gin fizz binder could not write this beer selection as a ""good beer selection"". Hey kids have you ever heard of this thing called an IPA, it is all the rage, and the cool dudes love it - so we are going to tell you we have 6 of them (mind you we only have 2, and them some standard Am-Bev shit).

She opened her line of credit by telling us that they were doing a domestic beer and burger night for 8 bucks - what a bargain. I said thanks and looked at the beer board, while limited and not great I did notice some quality choices. I asked to have the Three Floyds and a burger medium rare, and my friend asked for an Anti-Hero and a burger medium. Off she bounced in her hooters in wanna be outfit. Only to come back and tell us that we could not have those beers, why we asked? Because they are imports she replied, you can have Bud, Bud-light, Amstel, Stella, Miller lite, and Heineken.  What I reply - half those are from around the world, Three floyds is an hour away, and Anti-Hero is in the city.  They are imports she replies. How I ask I do not make up the rules sir. I confused about the rules, do you know what the word domestic means? A strange blank look came over her face, as if I had asked too many questions, and capacity was full. Forget it - we will just order the beer we want, with a burger and skip the special. After finding out that 4 of the beers on the menu are not in stock we settled on a green line. Later after a burger that did not know the meaning of fresh, she comes over to ask us a statement ""your food was great right"". I was polite and said not in the least, but it sustained human life through the consumption of, so from that point of view your stellar; humans did not die tonight because of this plate of food"".

The big win for me was their loaded tater tot nachos and their skillet chocolate chip cookie. There are those comfort foods in life, and those two things are definitely very high up there on my list of great bar food options. Both were very large portions so Emily S. and I had some trouble finishing them both, but we put in all our effort to try and give those tots and cookie their last hurrah.

When the plate was brought out it had coleslaw, fries and of course the fish. It had two big pieces of fish. You can tell that just by looking at it that it was not your average fish dinner. The fish was amazing and very meaty. It was probably one of the best battered fish I have had in a long time. They also served it with a zesty sauce.

He had the burger, I had the buffalo wings and were both disappointed. I realize this isn't a restaurant, but I guess we had both gotten spoiled by the gastropubs on the north side (where we used to live). Despite being told the fries were hand cut, they were clearly frozen. And so were the wings. And so was the burger patty. Which may have been OK, but at that price point ($3 for a side of fries), I had very different expectations. If you own a restaurant, just don't serve frozen wings. It's no better than what we could have gotten at a skating rink.  We were only there for a quick lunch, but could have spent $30 at a waaaay better bar that hand presses their burgers and hand-breads their wings. I don't think I've ever been more disappointed.",0.9337,0.797,0.136,0.067,0.5971794871794871
2014-12-29,1.0,"I had heard good things about Weather Mark, but quickly changed my opinion once I was there.  I can't give a review of my food or anything like that because I never saw a waitress/waiter during the almost 20 minutes (18 to be exact) of sitting there. I had walked in and saw the sign say ""Please seat yourself"", the bar was fairly crowded so i took a seat at one of the tables.  After about 7 minutes of not being greeted by anyone, I had thought that there may not be a waitress/waiter and I need to go to the bar to get my drink and food, but I then I saw a couple guys bus the table of the 3 ladies sitting 2 tables over from me and the bartender come around and give the ladies their check.  I then assumed that the bartender saw me and was going to bring over some menus and waters.  About 10 minutes later the bartender never came to greet me and I decided to walk out.  Mind you this was a Friday night around 5pm so the restaurant was not busy by any means and I assume at least one person working in the bar had to have seen me in the 18 minutes that I was sitting there.  I even moved tables to accommodate an additional friend that was coming to meet me.  To paint a clearer picture, there were about 8 people sitting at the bar and only 2 tables full; the table of the 3 ladies and myself.  Kind of hard to miss me when it isn't that full.   It's very possible that I just came at a bad time or I really needed to go to the bar to order, but needless to say, I won't be going back to this place.",0.1371,0.912,0.043,0.045,0.5504901960784313

We had a horrible waitress who had an attitude from the time we arrived and took forever to take our orders and hardly checked up on us throughout the meal. She was rude and didn't do simple things like refill waters, etc. Also, the restaurant was having some sort of private event that night so there were men up on ladders hanging signs and cardboard boxes everywhere which seemed really unprofessional while patrons were there eating.

This year, I stopped in after a Bears game and it was packed (I assume this was due to the freezing weather outside!).  We lucked out and again ran into people we knew!  Yay!  We had some bbq shrimp 'wings' this time.  I thought the flavor was ok, but the shrimp was a little weird and overly fried.  I saw others eating all sorts of other snacks and they were all gone, but I think everyone had the same opinion...food was ok, but nothing special.  Service was again really friendly. I think for food - stick with the sandwiches and skip the appetizers and you'll have a great time!

2014-09-22,2.0,"Just okay. Came here on a Thursday. Asked to sit at a table that was marked 'Reserved' to have a modicum of privacy from other diners. Normally, I wouldn't ask, but the restaurant had multiple tables and booths open, and this was just a regular two top table, nothing special. The busser, doubling as a hostess was shut down by the waitress, and refused to seat us there, so we were sat in between two other tables not spaced apart at all, and able to hear every intricacy of their conversations. For some reason, whomever was managing that night had our waitress serving a wedding party in the back, and three regular table in the front. Which meant the busser dropped waters off immediately, but then we were not greeted by the waitress until about 10 minutes after being sat. Either the waitress was rude, or overworked, or both, because when we were greeted, it wasn't really warm or inviting, just ""Do you know what you want to drink?"" in a very flippant tone. When I ordered a vodka club soda, she for some flashed me this weird, quasi-dirty look. Uh, alright. Food was ordered. Ordered a burger without a bun, medium rare. Food took quite some time, and was cooked well-done. I didn't send it back as I didn't want to wait 20 minutes for the kitchen to make a new plate. Once we got our check, we realized that our call drinks (Vodka Club Soda, and a Gin and Tonic) were poured with top shelf liquor, which is absolutely bogus. Call-drinks at any bar are poured with well/rail, or at the very least, the waitress should ask for liquor preference. What should have been a 5/6 dollar cocktail, became an 8 dollar cocktail. I'm not going to lose my shit over 2 bucks, but this is also a bullshit move by the waitress to pump up the check amount. Overall, there are better options with better food and better service in the South Loop. I appreciate a good neighborhood dive bar, but this place left a really bad taste in my mouth. Also, that 'Reserved' table? Was not sat in the 90 minutes we were there.",0.5085,0.812,0.102,0.086,0.4743867417304917

They have lots of TVs and is a fun nautical setting with a nice bar and an open air setting in the front when warm.  My complaint is in the past the food was always quite good. This time the quality of the food really went down hill. I ate before and after the game. The breakfast skillet I ordered was almost all potatoes and cheese. They must have only used 1 egg and the tomatoes and onion i ordered to out in it were non-existent. I returned after the game and had a veggie burger. It came out cold and the cheese was unmelted. No-lettuce or tomato etc. I know they get busy on game days but the kitchen lacked effort.

A spot that was open by 10:30 AM for drinks and brunch before we had to go meet our friends. After searching on Yelp I came across Weather Mark! It caught my eye because of it's nautical sailing theme. What better way to start a day of boating then to enjoy some brunch in a bar with real boat sails, pirate decorations and $3 mimosas, am I right? It was a beautiful day, so we sat out front on their patio. Service was great. Our waitress humored our ridiculous husbands and was quick to refill drinks! Loved their fresh mimosas which were perfectly proportioned (70% champagne, 30% OJ). Brunch was delicious as well. I got the classic breakfast with two eggs, toast, fruit, hash browns and sausage....YUP, all of that. And only for like $8! What a steal.  It seems like they have awesome specials every day.

2014-07-20,3.0,"Came here on a summer Sunday in July. This amazingly was my first time here even though I've lived on the South side for years. I walked into a bright, spacious place. The only patio I observed was in front of the place and it has like 2 or 3 tables that were of course, full. Place had an energetic vibe. Music was a bit loud but hey, it's a bar! My server engaged me promptly and my first brew arrived shortly thereafter. I asked about the 3 alarm wings and she said they were so hot that only one patron she knows of finished an order. I've heard that before;) anyway, decided to go for 2 alarm. They came out and they looked like the mini wings you get frozen at a grocery store. They tasted fine and were surprisingly spicy. Their scrawny size of 8 puny wings would prevent me from ordering them again. Main entree was fried cod. It was lite and crispy although it was quite heavily breaded:/ the cabbage coleslaw was good. The fries were large, bland steak fries that were not seasoned in the least. I didn't eat them. The beer & specialty cocktail list were fairly robust. Wine list is minimal. One obvious negative for me was the tiny glass of bourbon I got! I swear if anyone can open a spot on the South side where they know how to pour a drink, it will be a gold mine! My drink came in one of the smallest cocktail glasses I have ever seen! It's was filled to the brim with ice. The Bullet bourbon in the glass looked almost as clear as water?!

I went on a late Wednesday night.  I appreciate the beer selection & specials.  However, the mixed drinks I tasted were awful, which is why I ended up w/a beer or 3!  The salad was OK, but the Spinach Dip was horrible!!!  The dip tasted & looked like soup!

Don't mind if I do! The questions seemed easy enough, but my friend and I were not competing very well after a few beverages. No problem, it was free and the emcee didn't care that we were goofing off the whole time. We didn't come in last, but...we didn't make our former teachers proud. The bar was relatively crowded with 20, 30, 40-somethings and beyond. As someone who is knocking on 40's door, I was glad to see older folks sitting at the bar instead of a room full of horny 25-year-olds.

Our waitress was attentive for the most part but she had a friend eating at the bar & seemed slightly distracted by said friend's presence.

Totally chillin' and watching the NY college football game. Food was good--standouts included the chipotle-flavored Hollandaise on the Eggs Benedict and the wonderfully crisp side of bacon. The flank steak with the Steak 'n' Eggs was excellent quality and very nicely cooked--crispy browned edges and medium-rare center.  We weren't there to get blitzed so the 5:1 OJ/champagne was okay with us--we drank at least 3 carafes of the stuff. Our server was attentive and owner Mark made us feel very welcome.

From a delicious filet and appropriate sides, to tater tots and a burger (or a turkey club, if I'm feeling guilty) I've always been able to find something on the menu to satisfy my craving of the moment!

I guess I've always been biased since they took away Thursday night Karaoke - the ONLY reason I began to patronize Weathermark anyways. But a recently, I visited on a Friday nite after work... nothing going on but the noisy folks huddling to themselves in certain spots. I took an empty chair at the front end of the bar, in anticipation of getting buzzed and munching. The girl behind the bar (dark curly hair, name unknown) barely gave me a glance as I tried getting her attention to ask for a menu. The place was a tad busy, but at the time Miss Thing was chatting away with customers at the other end of the bar. So, she finally came over, asked me for my order and I ordered a beer. She asked me if I wanted to start a tab. I had originally anticipated ordering several drinks so I said, ""okay"" and requested a menu. Btw, Weathermark needs to desperately print new menus, as SEVERAL items I tried to order are no longer offered there. Plus, where are the waiters/waitresses?? Anyway, I chugged my beer and ordered two appetizers: quesadillas and potato skins.... and had to ASK for sour cream and salsa on the side. So halfway thru finishing my bites, Ms. Thing finally comes around to take my next order: Three Sheets to the Wind, one of the cocktails I used to order on the regular. Then by the time I finished everything, I'd become tired and impatient with the noise/unattentiveness of the bar girl, so I said, ""Check, please"" and prepared to pay my bill and go. Apparently, Ms. Thing had an attitude because I wasn't gonna run up a $100 tab on the iced-up drinks and half-assed service. But I didn't care. Overall, to me this place isn't what it used to be. The food is okay. Drinks are okay, depending on what nite you go there. It also seems to cater to a certain crowd, a crowd that I don't wish to be apart of, thank you.

Perfect, it's Tuesday. We walk over and it's a nice looking place, comfy looking couch/loungy setup to the right, and standard pub tables and stools to the left. There were some weird fabric sails that separated the groups of couches, reminded me of the interior of a Great Clips, which probably isn't a good thing? We seat ourselves and are given menus. We order a round of beers and decide to get a bunch of wings and some sides/appetizers. That was when things turned bad. I don't think any one thing came out _good_.

Somewhere in there, my friend convinced us to reconsider the amount we plan to tip at the end of the meal. Leaving a tiny tip is hard for some of us to do, but we managed. He had a good point, almost all the issues were service related, slow/cold food, forgotten drinks, forgotten dipping sauces. I understand that the kitchen may have made a special order food incorrectly, but the server should notice those things as they're running the food. The food is ok at best, while the service is sub par.",0.9945,0.778,0.182,0.04,0.6121825396825397
2011-09-13,1.0,"Our group came here on a Tuesday night since we live down the street and there wasn't much of a crowd.  We heard about their 50 cent wings special and wanted to try it out.  We waited a couple minutes before a waitress said to sit anywhere we wanted.  The service was a bit slow, but I think there was only one or two waitresses working this night.  We ordered 50 wings with both blue cheese and ranch dip, potato skins with bacon on the side, and two sides of tator tots.  She asked if we wanted plain or chili tator tots.  We were confused because we didn't know there was a choice when you ordered sides of tator tots.  So we ordered one with chili and one that was plain. The food took awhile to come out, but we were enjoying our beers and conversation until she came back with the potato skins with bacon on top.  We had to ask her if this was a mistake since one member in our party cannot eat pork.  She sent it back and brought out one set of tator tots (but not the other).  Apparently the chili tator tots was an appetizer, which explains the earlier conversation.  We wanted two sides of tator tots, not one side and one appetizer.  The wings came out, with only two sides of celery and two blue cheese dips.  We had to ask for the ranch dressing and we didn't even bother asking for more celery.  The wings were cold and the side of tator tots were cold.  The only thing that seemed hot out of the oven was the potato skins that were presented to us incorrectly the first time around.  The teriyaki and honey BBQ sauce were also terribly salty.  When one member of the party asked for water, it was forgotten until she came back and remarked that she thought he ordered a water and brought it over.  We decided that it was just time to finish our drinks and go.  Even though we live close by, I don't think we'll be going back.",0.6129,0.913,0.05,0.037,0.48561850027367265

I enjoyed every ounce of that poor turkey's arse.  2. Steak fries were spot on! Lightly seasoned and fresh out of the grease just like I like em!

Thumbs WAAAY Down: *Bartender #1's shift was over, so Bartender #2 might have been able to save this experience for us.  (Ha, who am I kidding?!) *Bartender #2 basically ignored me while I tried to get her attention to ask for the bill.  We made eye contact....and she looked away and continued her convo with the gentlemen at the end of the bar. *FINALLY asked her for our bill, but she basically looked annoyed and surprised because she didn't know if Bartender #1 ever charged us.  (She hadn't, of course.) *Took my bill and the card, but decided to stand and talk to the couple at the OTHER end of the bar.  (Ummm, helllo?  We wanted to get out of that place ASAP!  Just run my charges!)

We were sitting at a filthy table for about 15 minutes before anyone came by with menus or to take a drink order from us.  We should have known then.  Silly us, we stayed and tortured ourselves anyway.  We ordered an appetizer right away to get things started.  Hummus, a cold premade option that was most likely available in the kitchen and just needing to get scooped into a bowl and sent out to the table took 35 minutes.   Wanting to be out and enjoy the weather, we still stayed.  We must be idiots, we had ordered Eggs Benedict and nachos for lunch.  Once again, nothing too crazy, no special order or substitutions...  Over an hour later, we still had not received out food so we went back and found our server and the manager and let them know that we would not be waiting any longer and considering they still had not started the order, we would be leaving.  The manager could not have cared less and the chefs in the kitchen were standing there talking.   I wish I could say we were the only table that this happened to but this was par for the course in the entire restaurant.  I made sure to pass on the information to everyone that walked in the door.  I wish someone had warned me on our way in as well.

2010-01-18,5.0,"Dear Weather Mark, we love you.  It's the quintessential neighborhood bar, but with a nice, calming atmosphere and above-average bar food. Love the sailing inspired decor of the place... there are giant sails separating the booths and a giant action shot of some competitive sailing above the bar. As we saw the owner, Mark, on a sailing club boat last year on the Fourth of July for the fireworks, that's no doubt where the inspiration for the bar comes from.  The bartenders and waitstaff are all incredibly friendly and the service is great... Mark is also around constantly and always stays to chat with the regulars on a first-name basis.  Now, a double plus are the food/drinks. The beer on tap is the most crisp and clean tasting that we've had in the city... we've seen the lines for the beers on tap being cleaned twice already the past year. We remarked something to that effect to one of the bartenders, and he informed us that even the beer vendors tell them that they're lines are the cleanest they've seen. That's always a good sign! We love love love the buffalo wings Weather Mark has (our favorite wings anywhere!), and the sweet potato fries are a must also. Definitely go on Tuesdays where they have 50 cent wings. Have never tried their entrees, but they look to be delicious and a cut above regular bar food.  Perfect neighborhood bar for a relaxed evening with friends or family.

Unknown K, I couldn't agree more, but I can add more. This place, in a word, sucks. Sucks rotten eggs and bad fruit. We went there once and will never ever set foot in Weathermark again. Aside from the service being poor and slow, my husband and I were the victim of the ""bill switch."" We were there on a sleepy (and I do mean sleepy) Saturday night, the night before Easter, to have a few drinks. Aside from the 7 or 8 other scattered patrons the only other bodies belonged to a private party of about 10. We had 2 drinks each and decided to leave because the waitress behind the bar was overly preoccupied with the middle-aged Eurotrash sitting next to us. She made us start a tab and leave our credit card with her even though the place was virtually empty. We paid for our 4 drinks, which came to about $30, took our card and receipt, and left. What a surprise we had the next day. Long story short: they charged US for the party of 10, and switched the bill. I suppose it was an accident, although I'm not sure how it happened with only a handful of patrons, but suffice to say we weren't happy to have a $600+ charge on our credit card. We immediately called WM and were told that the manager wasn't in because it was Sunday, so we'd have to call back on Monday...huh? I told them that was absolutely not going to happen, and they were going to correct their mistake immediately. We walked over and they removed the charge, and barely muttered an apology. The manager did call us 2 days later, and basically had an ""eh, it happens"" attitude. Eh, your place sucks.",-0.9869,0.77,0.061,0.169,0.44701951951951957
2008-07-11,3.0,"As a ""youngin"" who's been in the working world for a year now, this place is fun, but only when I'm with the age-appropriate group. My coworkers range from 23-mid 30's and I'd say the crowd here hits the older end of that demographic. The first time I ended up here was at the very end of the night of my 21st birthday celebration with coworkers and I met some great characters. But on the weekends with my girlfriends, I'd say it'd be one of the last places we'd end up. One night, I walked in with a friend and not a single person in there was under the age of 30. We stuck out like sore thumbs and left after a few minutes of awkward staring. Not to be age-ist in any sort of way, but let's be honest, it's always more comfortable to be in a sea of people that aren't staring at you. Other than that, it seems to be your better-than-average locals bar, the decor is nice and the room is a really nice, open loft-like space with some decent deals on burgers and drinks and a sweet bartender who makes you wonderful grapefruit shots upon request - or your 21st birthday.

It comes with two toppings (lettuce and tomato count as one topping) and the burger is excellent. Also worth getting: the delicious club wrap (turkey or veggie). The mixed drinks are kind of expensive ($9), but the $18 Mai Tai pitcher is well worth it. The Weathermark is pretty spacious, so to get cozy try one of the couch booths.

Last night, my boyfriend and I returned for dinner at the Weathermark.  Ehhhh, not so good.  We go out to eat a lot and I can honestly say the quality/price ratio was awful.  We started with the quesadillas, because they were half off.  I give them a solid C.  Mushy.  Also, a tiny plastic shot glass of Pace salsa?  Gag.  The burger was obviously cooked from frozen as it was dry and overcooked with burnt edges.  It was simply not good.  AND!  ANNNND they allow you two topping.  Good choices like avocado, cheese, bbq sauce etc... BUT, get this, lettuce and tomato counts as a topping.  HUH?  The sweet potato fries were pretty good, but greasy.  I had the apple salad.  The dressing was very acidic and I felt like my mouth was melting off of my face.  It actually burned to eat it.  for $7 I was very disappointed, it was as if they didn't even try!  In short, the overpriced crappy bar food mad me angry. The drink specials were kind of crappy and my Newcastle was a little skunky.  The other drinks I have gotten were okay. I do like the environment.  Everyone who works here has been friendly and efficient.  I like the modern nautical theme.  It isn't too distracting and not at all kitchy.   I think this is a nice diverse, laid back place for drinks and maybe an appetizer.  It's nothing special.  I would not recommend anyone to go out of these way to visit this place and would never advise anyone to eat dinner there.",-0.6157,0.763,0.123,0.114,0.5163059163059164

Second, they have great specials throughout the week, such as Monday's $5 burger and a pint ('domestic' only, I'm afraid), and Tuesday's $0.25 wings.  Otherwise, they have a friendly atmosphere, a nautical theme, with a huge selection of rums, and a friendly staff.

My veal meatloaf was quite good, very flavorful with a touch of spice, and a rich, velveety mushroom gravy to die for. While they have a limited wine list, they specialize in Rum drinks.

It is supposed to be sailing themed but there are no real ""relics"" that you would expect to find in a bar called ""Weathermark Tavern"". There are a few model boats shoved on top of the food prep area-they could have done marvelous things with old ship's bells, navigation lights, netting. Even if they wanted to do the sail-racer theme, they could've done kevlar covered chairs and alot of stainless cable. It is just mind-bogglingly thematically confused. The entrance looks like an office building. Very sterile and cold.           The best thing? The servers and bartenders and cooks. They were all charming and extremely sweet and helpful.

Decorated in a nautical theme (big sails on the walls, pictures of sail boats, etc) this place is spacious but has a nice feel to it.   The sails on the walls help to define little seating clusters (couches) along the wall opposite the bar.   The bar is a great place to grab a bite to eat or to have a nice cold one.  I didn't eat but the guy next to me was certainly enjoying a very good looking quesadilla.  Their menu seems to skew toward southwestern bar food which seemed unusual to me but maybe I am the only one missing the connection between boating and the southwest!!
