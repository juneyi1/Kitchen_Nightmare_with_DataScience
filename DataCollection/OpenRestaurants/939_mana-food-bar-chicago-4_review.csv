2017-09-04,4.0,"The Food: 4/5. I went to Mana about 3-4 years ago for the first time and didn't like it much as I got something that was a salty block of tofu with nothing else and other things were short on vegetables and high on carbs. Glad I gave Mana another try because it brought its A game so I went two nights in a row. I absolutely loved the cold salads that were nice and refreshing and gnocchi was my favorite thing on the menu, it was fantastic.  Gnocchi - 5/5 (wow!) Avocado&Arugula salad -5/5 Panzanella - 5/5 Gyoza - 5/5  Mana Slider - 4/5  Rice noodles - 3/5 Polenta - 3/5 ( more of a personal problem as I don't love polenta) Curry - 2/5 (the curry flavor was good, but they need a different way to cook okra to make it less slimy) Pina Colada  Slushie - 5/5 (surprisingly not too sweet)  Mana Lemonade - 2/5 (too sweet) The Service: 4/5. The service varies a lot. The last time our waiter was very friendly but repeatedly messed up or forgot our order. Overall: 4/5. One of the best vegetarian spots in Chicago.",0.9301,0.822,0.122,0.056,0.5678395061728395

Caponata, creamy polenta with Mushrooms (madness), sliders are insanity. Most delicious vegetarian food in the city. Cocktails are something really special and made with real fruit purée, so natural and refreshing. I'm in love with the  Shakerita. I always have 2 or 3. Staff is highly trained and professional and always no nice and welcoming. I recommended it for business meeting (as something different) between my boss one year and the Alderman and he was very grateful for the idea as the place is really special. I tried to reserve a booth but they couldn't guarantee (as it goes against their policy) but finally they put the effort to accommodate him upon arrival!

Waited at the bar so took the liberty of ordering a a raspberry jalapeno margarita in slushy form...and boy was that good I had a second order with dinner. It's actually pretty spicy, good amount of spice to the drink. We were seated outside shortly after, in the corner. Seatings a bit crammed and space is tight. They recommend about 4-5 small dishes for 2 people so we went with that. Started off with the beets and those were delicious. Next we had the curry, mapo tofu, collard greens which were really good, I never get greens because they tend to be boring but these were not. Last dish was the gyozas..which was ordered on the raving reviews. This is something I don't get, they tasted like every other potstickers I've ever had. I'm Korean so potstickers in my blood, nothing special about these. They were a bit disappointing and wished I could have replaced them with another dish.

In fact I am already planning my next trip back it was that good.  We split the Saag Paneer, Mushroom Saute over creamy polenta, curry coconut corn with sugar snap peas over brown rice with fresh mint and each had a mana slider.  The Saag Paneer was my favorite dish followed closely by the mushrooms and polenta.  The small size dishes are easily shared between two people, but still make you feel like you are getting more than just two bites of the dish (which can be a probably with shared plates).  The small size also allow you to sample more menu items (because let's be real everything on the menu sounded delicious).  The ambiance was clean and simple with wood accents that gave the restaurant a modern yet non-pretentious feel.  I had one of their frozen Gin drinks that was limey and extremely tasty.

2017-03-26,3.0,"A friend and I came here for dinner. We're both staunch carnivores, so I'm not sure what kind of sickness came over my friend to suggest coming to Mana Food Bar, but I digress. Between my friend and I, we ordered two Mana Sliders, Burrito, and small orders of both the Saag Paneer and Rice Noodles. The Mana Sliders are served on a Hawaiian roll, with a patty composed of mushrooms and rice and spicy mayo. The patties were definitely filling and savory due to the mushrooms, but the seasoning otherwise was pretty lacking. Despite being a tad bland, I actually enjoyed the sliders considerably. Far better than other faux-burgers served at other places, as the texture and moistness of the patty was spot on. The Burrito was straight up a potato burrito with trace amounts of the other listed ingredients (poblano pepper, white cheddar, arugula, black beans, and charred tomato salsa). The potatoes were flavorful, but I was hoping for something a little more inventive as far as vegetarian burritos go. The potato in this context seemed to be merely a filler, and nothing more. The Saag Paneer was rather disappointing. The dish seemed rather gritty (from the spinach perhaps?) and I wasn't a fan of the taste in general. Nothing else to note, really... The Rice Noodles were fantastic. They come with a healthy kick of spice that might be too much for some. Still, the lemongrass / basil curry was flavorful and rich. The noodles were well done. The chili peanuts provided a nice crunch and contrast in texture with the noodles and green beans. It would seem like overall I had a pretty good meal, but the reason that I give Mana Food Bar three stars (good) is because nothing really seemed inventive. The Rice Noodles were like any other rice noodle dish minus the meat. You could argue that for the Burrito, while the Saag Paneer is traditionally a meatless dish. This isn't a big issue, as most of the food was pretty good, but such a restaurant serving rather standard vegetarian dishes would not warrant an excellent (4 star) or perfect (5 star) rating without the food being superb or sublime. When I mean inventive vegetarian dishes, I would like to cite the recipes that are found in Michael Anthony's ""V is for Vegetables"". The book boasts novel creations with non-traditional pairings (my favorite recipe in that book is roasted whole leeks with tangerines). There are definitely many other vegetarian restaurants that try to push the boundaries of vegetarian cuisine, instead of hashing out dishes that simply replace the meat with a starch or were vegetarian to begin with.

Goat cheese dip: warm goat cheese served over rich marina with toasted Italian bread. EXCELLENT. Granted, I've found this dish tends to be pretty stellar no matter where you go. Highly recommend for a shared app. Rice noodles: yuck. Noodles were a pile of mush and were served not cold yet not hot either--kind of an awkward slightly Luke warm. There was very little sauce on them and the only flavor I could pick up was spice. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Peanut sesame noodles: these had a lot better texture than the rice noodles (firmer noodles) and they were served chilled with plenty of creamy peanut sauce. Excellent flavor. Would recommend. Potato burrito: nope! I could have made a better burrito in my sleep. It's basically a tortilla stuffed with 90% black beans and like 5 pieces of potato. It's served with a very bland salsa.

We had reservation at 8:45, we were seated in the back area by the bar. I ordered gyoza and bi bim bop. Gyoza was alright, nothing great about it. My friend received his order first. He ordered sesame noodles which were good, avocado and aragula (a joke), and brussels sprouts were too salty for me. Now, my bi bim bop took 45min and by this time the place wasn't busy anymore. My friend had finished his meals already, I told the server and my order came right away in that moment. How difficult is to put rice, fried vegetables, and an egg on top? It was alright, for the long I wait I was expecting something better. I think the best was my Pink Martini. The reason of my low rate was the service, the waitress that took care of us wasn't nice or friendly, and she wasn't attentive either. I don't know her name, but she was wearing a blue blouse, medium brown hair, blue eyes, and she was making drinks too. When I was eating my bi bim bop I put it on the side because I was gonna show a picture to my friend she came to the table and put the side of sauce I had over my plate and asked if we wanted something else. She thought that I was done with my plate, I still had food left. Why she didn't ask if I was done? When I told her that I haven't finished my food yet, she said ""oh! Do you still want it?"" And she took off the sauce from the plate like seriously?? Do you think I'm gonna eat that after you put the sauce on my food? I told her no, it's fine. That really pissed me off, that was so rude from her, and she didn't even apologize. If it wasn't for the poor service I would give it another try, but customer service is very important to me.

2017-01-06,4.0,"4 stars means ""Yay! I'm a fan."" We were definitely fans and would come back...especially for the baked goat cheese dish and to try the dishes we didn't get to. Baked Goat Cheese: 5/5. Everything from the bubbling cheese concoction to the tender bread was perfect. I could've ordered 3 more of these without trying anything else and still have been so satisfied with my meal. My friend isn't a huge goat cheese person, and he still loved this.  Burrito: 4/5. Really solid, hearty burrito. Already comes cut in half so it's perfect to share for 2. As native Texans, the flavors of the charred salsa, black beans, poblanos and potatoes really reminded us of home. Kick this up a notch by dipping in any leftover baked cheese you have (we barely had any but definitely cleaned out the bowl!).  At this point, we were pretty full but had 2 dishes yet to come out. We tried a little of both and packed the rest to go. Luckily, our favorite dishes of the night came out first. We weren't huge fans of the last two. Rice Noodles: 1/5. We just did not enjoy this one, but we'll put that on personal taste preferences rather than on the integrity of the dish. I can see how others might enjoy this, but this very sweet noodle dish jus didn't have the right set of ingredients for either of us.  Mapo Tofu: 3/5. My friend liked this a lot more than I did. While the dish was plenty flavorful, I didn't care for the combination of black beans with tofu and butternut squash. I found myself getting confused on whether it was a Chinese or Mexican dish. We were so full in the end and happy we got to try a variety of dishes! While very small, this is a great place to try out some new flavors and have an intimate dinner. I probably wouldn't come here with a group of larger than 4.

Pretty decent, spicy.  Sweet and sour tofu - decent tofu, delicious sautéed veggies.  Gnocchi - decent, but a bit bland. Adding their hot sauce made it much better.

They've never seated me unless my whole party is present, even though I've never seen the restaurant full. I know this is pretty standard at some places but it just seems unnecessarily strict when theres so many empty tables. I once called to make a reservation at 7pm and the woman who answered literally said ""Really? At 7pm, our most popular time?"" (it was very much a ""how dare you?"" tone) she managed to ""fit us in"" and when we showed up the restaurant was practically empty. The last time I was there my friend and I were waiting for one other person and not only would they not seat us, they made me sign in on their waiting list.

2016-08-01,5.0,"All I can say is wow. A vegetarians treasure. The service was excellent and while the ambience was not my style, it was in line with the philosophy of the food so all is well.  My wife and I shared several dishes (she needs GF) and they were all fantastic. By far the best dish was the special potato soup with roasted garlic and relish. The broth was perfectly smooth with a creamy, but not excessively thick texture. The relish on top had a fantastic acidity that balanced the dish smoothly. While not the finest potato soup I have tasted (that honor goes to hot potato cold potato at Alinea), this was pretty darn close. Seeing as you get a full bowl of it, that is impressive. I had two complaints about the dish, both of which attest to the quality. First, it was a special item so we had no price. Had we known it was only $4 we would have ordered 2. Second, it was so great, that even the amazing dishes that followed fell short of this one. The second dish we had was the veggie chili. It was flavorful and not overwhelming. Even with big pieces of Jalepeno present it did not burn. While the flavors were fairly 1 note, its chili so its not supposed to be so deep. The third dish we had was the beet salad. It was just ok. The ingredient quality was top notch but the balance was a bit out of whack. The blue cheese really overwhelmed everything and the sherry vinaigrette was not enough to bring it back. I think an aged balsamic would have been bold enough to stand up to the cheese and bring out the sweetness of the beet. The fourth and fifth came out together and it was an amazing contrast on what a ""curry"" is. One was rice noodles with a green Thai curry and one was okra with an Indian Curry. The Thai curry was herbacious and lovely with a light burn of heat. The Indian Curry was much more assertive with heavy spices and tons of flavor. Both great dishes in their own way and contrasted well. The last item we ordered was a slider. It was really for me because it was not gluten free. It really just made my mouth happy. I would really consider coming and just ordering half a dozen of them, a couple beers and call it a night. Overall great experience.",0.9983,0.765,0.213,0.022,0.52502052545156

2016-05-11,3.0,"Mana Food Bar was actually more of a 3.5. This is the kind of place you take your non-veg friends or family to and they just don't get excited over veg food from it. It's good but not great and nothing particularly stands out to make them order it over meat.  Service was friendly and there's a cute, intimate setting of booths as well as a bar. Most menu items can be ordered as a small or large portion, depending on the size of your group and your hunger. We split all of the following amongst our group of four: - Mana Sliders: Brown rice and mushroom based. These were served with a spicy (bright orange) mayo on a potato bun. The bun could certainly have had more going on and almost out-trumped the burger in size. Burger itself had good flavor and was definitely homemade. The mayo was also a bit overwhelming. The burger had solid flavor without so much bun and sticky mayo - side note, I'm not a big mayo fan ever. - Caponata: This was good. It was a mix of eggplant and tomato and quite saucy. The toast, similar to the bun of the burger, was nothing special. The dish was good but we've had better caponatas and nothing stood out (not super garlicy or fresh tasting). - Saag Paneer: Being married to an Indian, I've tried my fair share of Indian dishes while dating, etc. This was off the mark, sadly. Our dining companion had raved about it, so we got the large serving. You didn't taste the dish, as they tried making the whole dish incredibly creamy. Spinach was there, but also barely noticeable because of the cream sauce itself. And almost no spice at all! Not the best Indian copycat. Filling, though - so if you're hungry, could be a good order. - Sweet & Sour Tofu: Tasty and a good mix of sweet and sour. The tofu was seared well and you could combine it nicely with the other flavors, so it didn't have too much of the plain tofu flavor to it. Brighter flavors in this one. - Curry: Our favorite dish of all. By no means would we call it a traditional curry, but it had more flavor (still not spicy) than the saag paneer and a very comforting feel to it. We loved the mix of the cauliflower, lentils and mint - really adding to the flavor punch of this one. - Mushroom saute: Good but again not outstanding. Polenta was cooked well and wasn't too buttery or oily. It had sort of a mashed potato texture - a plus in my book! A solid amount of mushrooms well-sauteed on the top of the polenta, but the mushrooms didn't have that much flavor to them. They were juicy and large but not well-spiced. Nothing in particular was bad, but nothing stood out as amazingly good. If we lived in the city it certainly wouldn't be a regular spot for us, but maybe if we wanted something we knew we could order most things on the menu without having to have a special eye for vegetarian options, we'd go back.",0.9979,0.753,0.19,0.056,0.5082909627685747

2016-04-18,5.0,"This establishment was a gem of a find.   My wife and I are both vegan, and while visiting Chicago, we found it challenging to find decent places with both, quality food and good service. The entrees come in two sizes, large and small.  The smalls are the size of a tapa, and you can expect to make a meal out of two to three per person.  That is one of the perks of this place, my wife and I got four different ""small"" entrees which enabled us to try a variety of food, all of which were excellent.  We had the burrito, a curry with cauliflower and lentils, a broccoli, tofu with rice, and goyza (basically, pot stickers without the pork), and then three different sorbet flavors.  They were all excellent.  My wife and I really enjoyed each, and it was a pleasure to have such a variety available in one meal. The appearance of the establishment is a hole in the wall.  When you walk in you will find a very small dining area -- but there is more space in the back.  I would recommend that you make reservations.  They are not required, but given the size of the place, I could see that you might have to wait otherwise, though we were seated immediately without them, but that was on a Monday night. The wine list is limited in selection, but those they carry seem to be quite good.  They also have three different sakes along with full bar service. Our server, Elizabeth, was great.  She was knowledgable about the menu and offerings, suggested various wines to my wife based on her tastes, and was very helpful in general.  Service was prompt and we were checked in on enough to keep us happy, but not too much to be irritating.

2016-03-25,4.0,"I must admit that the global vegetarian menu made me a bit skeptical. Brown rice and tofu just can't compete with a juicy steak or fresh slices of raw fish. Meatless dishes often lack that spark of flavor and sometimes taste dry and bland, or worse gloppy and gooey. So I decided to order cocktails with dinner instead of wine like I usually do. Cocktails, while tasty, generally overpower the food flavors. Once I tasted their food, I regretted my cocktail strategy. Their perfectly prepared and well-crafted dishes really deserve a nice wine or sake pairing. All the vegetables were slightly crunchy and seasoned just right. The polenta that came with the Mushroom Saute was one of the best polentas I've tasted, with just the right amount of asiago cheese.

This time, I walked in at 4:00 right when they opened. Totally empty. The woman offered me a seat at the bar. I asked whether I could sit at a table, since they were empty. She said she'd check with the host because they had reservations. I replied, ""I promise I'm leaving in half an hour, I have an appointment."" She looked at me slightly askance and insisted she'd check with the host. Really? I went to the bathroom, came back, and saw they'd put the water on the table so I sat there. Strangely, people came in after me and the host chirped, ""Sit wherever you'd like!"" OK then. Meanwhile, my waiter was taciturn bordering on surly. Me: ""Do you have chardonnay?"" Him: ""No. [pause] The white wines are in the middle of the list."" Thanks bruh, that's helpful. I seemed to recall that the dishes were on the small side, so I asked. He replied, ""There's a small and a large."" Yeah again you're winning on helpful. Especially since 5 minutes later I hear another couple ask about the size of plates and he cheerfully explains how ""We're a small dish place"" and continues with details about several dishes. Bruh are you mad at me because I sat at a table?  He brings me the first dish and puts it down in front of me. I was a server myself for years, maybe I'm old school but I always said ""Enjoy."" Not this guy. He isn't wasting a syllable on me. Another couple came in and sat behind me and this guy becomes Chatty Charlie. Literally I had to turn around to look, just astounded to see that it was the same guy. He is cracking jokes and even the pitch of his voice has increased. I finish first dish. Look at menu, choose second dish, but waiter isn't returning. Another worker notices and holds a menu over her mouth to tell him to come and look in on me, so he does.  I'm halfway through the second dish, dude is flitting around the room chatting with everyone but doesn't deign to ask me how it is. So when he passes me to talk to the other couple I announce, ""This is very good."" He says, ""Uh..... ok."" #notpickingupclues In summary, the food is fantastic so I will definitely be back.

2015-12-30,4.0,"Note: I think that this whole tapas/""small plates"" thing is kinda a BS ploy to get you to spend more money for very little amounts of food. Mana isn't cheap but it is wonderfully tasty. I love the fact that Mana serves food that isn't trying to be vegetarian but just is. No weird texture issues with fake chicken or fake cheese or any of the above. The food is almost always on point although service here can be a true hit or a miss. I've been here at least five or six times over the past three years so you can bet your bottom dollar I know a thing or two. AMAZING:  - Bi Bim Bop: trust me, I'm Korean and I know what good bbb is. This one isn't trying to be authentic because it has its own amazingly wonderful flavors and sauces. I'm not one to usually say this, but the carrots in this dish are weirdly PHENOMENAL.  - Mushroom Sauté: Everyone's favorite - I see every table get this all the time. The polenta is creamy in your mouth with the tanginess from the asiago cheese. The juiciness and garlicky-fragrance of the mushroom sauté is to. die. for. *The mushroom can sometimes be a wee bit salty but this varied on my different visits. DECENT: - Avocado, Arugula and Tomato: pretty straightforward, great dressing - Brussel sprouts: Crunchy and zingy. Can be too salty sometimes. - Mana slider: a lot of people wax poetry about this little guy so I guess it makes it on the decent list. Not the most mindblowing thing I've eaten but they're downright dependably tasty if they're not too charred! SKIP: - Potato Pancake: think latkes! and then think, wet soggy latkes that are nothing like latkes. this is a sweet potato pancake that lacks the crunch factor so beloved in savory pancakes. it's not really worth your time. - Maki: BORING Juice:  - apple, pineapple and cucumber = refreshing Service: - Blegh, it's a small place that can get pretty crowded. Come at off times because it's infuriating when you wait 15+ min between your dishes while the party that came after you somehow seems to receive all the things you've ordered, first.

2015-10-28,2.0,"I'm not vegetarian and each time I choose to go to a vegetarian restaurant I go in with the same expectations as I have for a carnivorous restaurant - the feeling of satiation after a meal, that umami sense and taste we all desire, and that psuedo belief that we have for about a day that we'd totally be able to give up meat cause the food that you had was just that damn good. Sadly, I didn't feel any of those things at Mana. My boyfriend and I went to Mana on a Friday night for dinner and it was just alright. Nothing special and I probably wouldn't go again. We did as a matter of fact have one stand out item - the baked goat cheese with tomato sauce and toast was delicious. However, I'm pretty sure you could find this anywhere so it's not anything super unique. Honestly, it tasted like a cheese pizza when you put it all together which is probably why we liked it so much. If you do go to Mana (or if you are on Yelp at Mana right now), get it! It was pretty good. The rest of the meal was pretty lackluster. We got the Ma Po Tofu, Ravioli, and 2 sliders, so we could each have our own. While the eggplant in the Ma Po Tofu was pretty good, the tofu was absolutely flavorless and there was barely any rice in the dish. The Ravioli was fine also - it tasted like a ravioli and sauce that I could have made out of a box at home (yay for Buitoni). And those famous sliders that I haveheard so much about. For $3.50 a pop, I'd expect them to have a little piece of gold in them, or at least taste like a little piece of heaven in my mouth. Instead, it was bread encasing a salty mush that had no bite. The texture of the slider was all soft and there was absolutely no interesting element to the slider.  Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend Mana in general or as a vegetarian restaurant. Tofu should never come completely flavorless and the prices are a bit high in my opinion for the quality and quantity of food presented.",0.9856,0.797,0.147,0.056,0.6324323062558356

She met with me at the venue multiple times to go over everything and was nothing but sweet everytime. She literally comforted me when everything was overwhelming.  I digress...

2015-09-05,4.0,"I saw this place on yelp looking for smoothies. Of course, though, I definitely wanted to try the food. It's hard to find good vegetarian places that match my tastes and my apparently but unintentionally high expectations. I was with my friend, and neither of us were averse to vegetarian. We decided to small plate. We ordered the beet salad, bibimbap, linguini, and one slider.  First, the service was slow, yet amiable and personable. The slow service was nerve wracking since I had parked on the street, and disgruntlement to my friend who hadn't eaten dinner last night nor breakfast and lunch today. The beet salad (yellow beet, arugula, Amish blue cheese, hazelnuts) came out first. It was so delicious! I totally recommend. Unfortunately it was the only dish we ended up really liking.  Next was the linguini, which actually had ground red chili, chopped tomato, and clumps of cheese, cooked in olive oil. It was quite good: a subtle flavor that became increasingly spicy towards the end, ending with a little salty.  Next came the bibimbap. My friend was most excited to eat this. Unfortunately, my friend had a bite, pronounced it extremely salty. I tried three to four grains of brown rice: yup, saltier than eating plain salt. Thankfully, our waiter was kind enough to address the problem. Since we were also waiting on the slider, we decided not to switch the order but cancel the dish.  The slider was quite interesting. The patty is made of brown rice loosely held together the same way clumps of steamed white rice are - by the starch - and then roasted? It was held together in the shape of a patty. It was stuck to the bun by way of a spicy mayo that was more sweet and lightly tangy than spicy. My friend liked it. I thought it was just okay. It came with lightly pickled cucumber - basically cucumber soaked in vinegar.  I would have liked to come back for the smoothie, but the food was overall a bit disappointing. The only thing we enjoyed was the beet salad. I will try to come back to try the smoothies.  I really liked our waiter. He was funny and personable.  I want to give Mana Food Bar 4 stars, but I think it is an overall solid 3/5. The food was adventuresome, but I think the long wait time for such small dishes spoiled our enjoyment because we were quite hungry, and would prefer to fill our bellies with food and not water. In the end, I'm giving it a four because personable waiters have become a rarity considering some experiences I had, but I implore people to be mindful of the wait time.

They seemed to be chatting with each other and other guests for long periods of time, and we waited at least 15 minutes to order despite a somewhat empty restaurant. We started out with some drinks, the seared tofu with brown rice, and the sesame noodles. The waitress tried to tell us something about ordering an additional item with the tofu (something along the line of other guests enjoy it more with a side). It was quite odd, but we decided to start with those dishes first. When they did arrive, they were less than stellar. The portions were tiny for the price (coming from a SF/Bay Area guy that is more than wiling to pay for good food). The tofu was a salt attack, and I could barely finish the portion. The random brown rice on the side was tasteless. The sesame noodles were average at best, but certainly not worth the price. We decided to end our meal and head elsewhere for a better dinner.

2015-07-08,3.0,"I am definitely no vegetarian/vegan, but if a vegan place has this high of reviews, I'm down for trying something new!  I was walking through Wicker Park with some friends on my last night in Chicago. We were looking for a great last meal to end my day on and I looked up ""food"" on Yelp and found Mana Food Bar with it's 4.5 star rating. I was a little skeptical since I personally am not vegetarian/vegan, but I wanted to give it a shot anyways.  This is probably the fanciest little vegan place I have come across. Their outdoor seating is quite pretty. There was actually a wait for this place so we put our names down and waited for a text message to come our way. We were seated at the bar and given our menus. The place is very dim so it was sort of hard to see unfortunately. I decided to go with two popular items: the ravioli and the potato pancakes. The ravioli comes in a small and large portion. I opted for the small. The ravioli is filled with artichoke which I unfortunately could not taste due to the overpowering sauce. The ravioli is literally drowning beneath a blue cheese tomato sauce. The sauce is delicious, but the blue cheese overpowers every flavor on the plate. All I could taste was a rich blue cheese, hint of tomato and the texture of the ravioli pasta. Sadly, no artichoke.  On the other hand, the potato pancakes were a hit! I wasn't sure what to expect but I was very surprised. It comes with sweet and white potatoes and an apricot currant chutney. The pancakes were crisp and I loved the combination between both kinds of potatoes. I would never think of potatoes pairing with apricots but I liked the combination! The apricot chutney wasn't overly sweet and had a very nice tanginess to it. I liked the small chunks in the chutney because it added some texture to each bite. The only thing I didn't like was that after some time, the chutney on top of the pancakes would start to make the pancakes mushy. Picking them up with the fork would cause everything to fall apart and it was hard to eat. Portion size wise, it's pretty small. If you're looking for a really hearty and filling meal, this might not be the place for you if you're trying to get your moneys worth. I was happy with just a small meal that night so it was enough. For both small dishes, it costed around $20 without tip. The food does seem like it is made from high quality ingredients though.  Service was decent, but could have been better. My ravioli came out and the rest of my party's food came out. The waitress left telling us to have a good meal without mentioning anything about my missing pancakes. Thankfully they came out a few minutes later. The bartender was our server, and although he was friendly, he was busy half the time. We did get our water refilled once at a timely manner. They also were willing to split our checks which we appreciated. Overall, the place wasn't my cup of tea but I did enjoy trying something new.

2015-05-02,3.0,"M and I saw Mana on the television show ""Check Please!"" and then she met a friend there for dinner. She loved it! She loved it SO much that we went on an impromptu date to Mana last night. It was alright. It's just not my scene. I'll readily admit that it was good (which is why I rate it A-OK) but nothing really captured me. The atmosphere was tight (rather than intimate), busy (not ebullient), and rushed (instead of chill). The employees were absolutely friendly and obviously dedicated and good at their jobs. I loved them and wanted to hang out with them; however, they were juggling too many balls and could hardly dedicate much time to any single group. We went at 6:00 PM on a Friday and we had a reservation. I sat at the bar until M came and (because the bar tender was so nice) we chose to forgo our table in the new back section and stay at the bar. It was a good time and vantage point to see how things are at Mana. I liked my Almond Horchata and Nigori cocktail. I had two of them. It was sweet and creamy and I liked the flavor partner of the rice wine. M had a margarita (also made with sake) which was sweet and refreshing. We ordered the beet salad, the gyoza, two sliders, and the curry. I did not find the beet salad to be satisfying; however, the dressing was very fresh and had a strong taste of raspberries. I did not like the tofu cubes in the gyoza, but M LOVES tofu so she was a big fan. The sliders were a tad too salty and soft for my preference, but M LOVED them. It was kind of like eating a sloppy joe sans barbecue. Neither of us liked the curry and brought about half of it home. I asked the bar tender (who was cute as pie) if the tofu was non-GMO and she said that nearly everything at Mana is non-GMO. That's great! I hope it's true. By the end of the meal we were eager to go home and relax on the couch. We just needed some time away from the hullabaloo.

As a long-time vegetarian I have tried several veggie friendly restaurants in Chicago and none of them fell short of their reputation. We went to eat at Mana on a Saturday late-afternoon: our experience started off well, our waitress was very attentive and made some suggestions. The sake cocktails which they are known for are nothing special and so was the rest of the menu. The only good thing we had that night was the baked goat cheese, other than that all the food lacked in taste and any kind of seasoning. After about 45 minutes our waitress disappeared and we weren't able to find her for the rest of the night. We ordered 2 sliders, mind you they weren't meat thus didn't require a certain amount of cooking time and waited for 40!!!! Minutes to get them. By that time we were highly annoyed yet none of the other waiters seemed to care and shrugged the wait off quite easily. Overall I would not recommend this place to anyone with developed taste buds.

2015-04-27,4.0,"Mana is great! I stopped by here during my first trip to Chicago last week. It was highly recommended by a guy I met while traveling and I'm glad I got the chance to visit.  I started off with the small Bulgogi. It was good. It's basically a block of grilled tofu with some soy glaze on it. My only complaint is that the glaze was incredibly salty which wasn't an issue when eating the tofu but there were a couple slices (literally) of mushroom on top that were completely inedible because of how salty the glaze was. I also would have liked some more mushroom on top of it...maybe about 5 pieces that weren't doused in the soy sauce.  Next came our sliders. These were adorable. They're simple (mushroom and rice patty) and the spicy mayo on them pulled the whole thing together. They are also served with some spicy cucumber slices (pickles I guess). They were delicious. My meat-eating bf had 5 of these sliders so he definitely enjoyed them. I liked them too.  Then I had the small potato pancake. It was delicious. It's a bit like a dessert to be honest. It's sweet but not too sweet and the creme they serve with it makes it taste so rich. It's delicious. I just wish it was thicker since the edges were quite burnt and the pancakes is incredibly thin. For $7.50 I would have liked for it to be thicker/bigger. Even though I was full I really wanted to try the rice noodles. I'm soooo glad I did. It was delicious. The server brought a bottle of some green pepper sauce to the table with the serving of noodles and some chopsticks. The pepper sauce is delicious; my bf and I loved it on the noodles. If you like Thai inspired flavours and lots of ginger, get the noodles!  Altogether, we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Mana. It's a bit loud in there so I don't know that I recommend it for a first date but definitely good for couples, just be prepared to speak loudly. My favourite thing about Mana is that they have small and large portions of most of the menu items so you can order several small portions so you can try many at your individual visit. I recommend you check it out if you're vegetarian or not. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'll be going to Mana for lunch or dinner for sure. :o)",0.9991,0.715,0.264,0.021,0.6103384246780473

After deciding not to come here the first time due to way too long of a wait, we were lucky to get in here with only a few minutes waiting time. Score! We were seated at the bar, which was more than okay by me if it means not having to wait absurd amounts of time.  The menu has a ton of stuff that looks really delicious and the prices aren't cheap for a ""$$"" restaurant, so we had to choose carefully to keep it in the more affordable realm. We decided to split two entrees: the cold sampler and the large potato pancake. It irked me a little that we never mentioned anything to our server about wanting to split the food, but the sampler came out first with two plates and then the pancake came out also with two plates. It worked for us because it's what we decided, but I found that just a little odd. Maybe our waitress was just that observant!  Now, on to the food. The tree cold appetizers were all good. I especially enjoyed the one with red onion and avocado in it. The quinoa was also quite good. My favorite was the potato pancake, though. The first thing that struck me was that it looked darker, thinner, and smaller than I was expecting. I wonder what the small size would have looked like? It was cut into different pieces and had this incredible sour cream (maybe it was vegan--I don't care!) to go with the pancakes. It was definitely a struggle to have to share with my girlfriend.  Even better than the food was the service. I was so impressed that our friendly waitress/bartender gave us free samples of a really great lemon drink with real bits of lemon in it.

We arrived again on a weekday night and they were able to seat us at the bar after only a few minutes. Score! The place is tiny, which is why it can be so tricky to snag a table without waiting at least 45 minutes. It being tiny also meant that, while sitting at the bar, that the woman sitting next to me kept accidentally elbowing me in the arm.  The service here was IMPECCABLE. Both the host and the bartender/server were very friendly and I felt that we were well taken care of the whole meal from start to finish. While perusing the menu, we were given a sample of a lemony drink, which was great. We decided to share two dishes. I chose the cold sampler (basically three salads for $12) and he got the large potato pancake. Salads were our server's three favorite and they were great. One had avocado, one had quinoa, and one had red onion. They were great! Very small portions of each, though. The potato wasn't what I was expecting. It was thin, not thick, almost burnt, but it tastes AMAZING. One of the best potato pancakes I've ever had, for sure.  My only complaint is that I found the portions to be too small and too expensive for what you get. I could have easily eaten two of the ""large"" potato pancake and I'm not a big person. I ended up reducing a star for that, but food is definitely five star-worthy. The Michelin bib gourmand designation certainly didn't mislead me here. I will absolutely be back to try more!

2015-01-16,5.0,We had a wonderful meal at Mana Food Bar tonight....I am a vegetarian and I took my husband and kids there since I'd heard great things. We had a reservation and were running late so we called to let them know. They were helpful in telling us our table was taking longer than expected..once we got there the table still took ages and with kids this can be difficult..but everyone was super nice and asked if we wanted food or drink while we waited. Once we were seated they were super apologetic and thankful for our patience. Ok the food -- wow it was great. Everything was wonderfully seasoned and super flavorful. The rice noodles were great as was the polenta with mushrooms (a dish that they brought accidentally.) I don't event eat mushrooms and I ate half the dish! Really well cooked and flavored mushrooms. We had the saag paneer which was very different and a great fresh take on this Indian dish. I'd maybe like some acid on it or pickles onions but that is just me.

The goat cheese is sinfully divine. It's thick, potent, and mixed with a SPICY tomato sauce on the bottom that really gets the taste buds moving--also served with a wondrous pile of rustic bread. The avocado and arugula salad is a delightful mix of arugula, avocado, pickled onions, and salt/pepper in a zesty vinegar-based dressing. Amazingly mixed with perfect proportions of dressing to salad mix. I highly recommend Mana--to vegetarians, vegans, and meat-eaters alike.

The ravioli was spot on and the Fritters were killer.  Only draw back is place is super small.  But a huge plus is you do to have to be on high alert that the pizza you are 3 bites in actually is using fake cheese bcs it's a Vegan Place. like that Karyn's.,0.9686,0.687,0.238,0.075,0.5314652014652015

It's extremely cute, affordable, and has tons of vegetarian options many of which you wouldn't even know were meatless. Perfect to satisfy your protein cravings without killing your chances at some after dinner dessert. ;-) Tis true. You wouldn't want to go if you were in a time crunch. It's about the size of a Smart Car, super popular, and they don't take reservations so you can imagine the wait at times. If you do decide to try your patience in line or grab a drink nearby (which they let you do) the menu is absolutely amazing from start to finish.  You can share almost everything and I suggest you do. Between the two times I've visited I've only gotten through about half of the menu but can verify that the trio of salads, sliders, mushroom polenta, veggie burrito, brussels, goat cheese dip, toasted ravioli, and beet salad are all unbelievable.  They serve beer and wine as well, but drink wise the most buzzworthy option is the freshly squeezed juices. Finish off your meal with one of those and you'll feel way more amazing that anything you'd have at a steakhouse.  In short Mana is amazing.",0.9906,0.796,0.193,0.01,0.7179138321995466

We came on a Sunday night 7pm and was quoted a 30 minute wait but only waited 15.  I would say seating-wise, it's best to come here as a party of 2 or 4. The menu is small and offers a variety of dishes in a small and large size. There are lots of asian inspired dishes like BiBimBop and Saag Paneer. If you're sharing, order a bunch of small plates and dine tapas style. The three of us ordered 7 small dishes to share and it was perfect so you get a small taste of everything.  What I loved: peanut sesame noodles, caponata, mushroom saute, and the sliders. We also got gyoza, curry, potato pancake, which were good but not great.  You won't miss the meat because everything's flavored very nicely. They also have an extensive smoothie/fresh juice section.  I ordered the peach/oat/almond milk smoothie. It was yummy but I wish there was more oat/texture (a la Irazu's oatmeal shake). It's also more filling than it looks.  I only realized this by the end of the meal when everything started to expand in my stomach, once again a result of ""eyes bigger than stomach"" disease.",0.9948,0.742,0.239,0.019,0.5341774891774892

However, if you aren't used to spicy foods, then you will probably find both of those meals to be quite spicy. And the pineapple ginger sake cocktail is AMAZING!!! I wish that I could just drink that anytime I ever wanted to drink alcohol again. Also, the service was excellent. They were very friendly and accommodating.  So, you may be wondering why I gave this place only 3 stars. Why? Because the portions are ridiculously small for the prices. I mean like fancy restaurant small. I bought two cocktails and one entree and spent $38, not including tip. Honestly, for that reason alone I will probably not be all that likely to ever eat there again.

2014-03-30,5.0,"This restaurant is heaven on earth. Where to begin? The restaurant itself had a pretty cool atmosphere. My friend and I were a bit skeptical at first because- be warned- it is very very small, but the food proved to be well worth the wait. Literally, anything off of that damn menu would be great. Tip- instead of a large sized dish, get a few small sized ones and split them with the table! To drink, they had a full bar that looked nice and sophisticated, but being underage, I got the pineapple avocado smoothie which was AWESOME. Guys, it was brilliant. I don't know what kind of magical unicorn dust they put into that thing, but it was kick ass. We got a few small dishes like I said above, I think they were the kale and radish (?) salad, mushroom polenta, sliders, and one other thing that I forgot the name of. I'm usually a pretty picky eater, but these were all awesome and the sliders are on my list of favorite dishes EVER. Also, shoutout to the waiter who served us, who when overheard that I wanted to try tofu and was wondering what dish to put it in, said that (and he knew what he was talking about) if we were up for it, he wanted to throw in a surprise dish so we could try tofu for the first time in the best way possible, and let me tell you, he was sooooooo right. If you're a tofu person, ask for seared tofu with soy sauce and mushrooms. I don't think it was on the menu, and he didn't charge us for it either (since it was his idea, just so this new vegetarian could try tofu!). I'm aggravated at myself for forgetting his name, because he was such a great waiter- very nice, knew what he was talking about, thoughtful. Check this place out if you ever get a chance.

2014-03-03,3.0,"Seems like from all the reviews out there, it was either REALLY REALLY REALLY good.... or A-OK. I'm sorry, but I have to side with the A-OKs. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish, or maybe I have had good vegetarian food in the past, which was much better than this. This is a hipster dimly-lit restaurant/bar located in the Wicker Park. The place is small... houses about 20 people. They have 3 tables seating 4 and a couple of booths that comfortably seat 2, but we squeezed in 4 as the lighting was the best there. Every other seat was pretty dim, but I guess that is the ambiance. The rest of the restaurant was bar seating, where there was a decent selection of liquor. This place apparently is known for its veggie dishes. We ordered the Baked Goat Cheese for an appetizer. The warm gooey cheese went well with the hardened toast slices that came with it. It was a perfect combo. My friend ordered the chilli, which he said was good. I ordered the Ma Po Tofu, and it was ok. Don't order this if you're expecting the ma po tofu you would get at a chinese restaurant. This dish was fill of black-bean sauce and little bit of brown rice on the bottom. I had to order a side of quinoa to soak up the extremely saltiness of the black-bean sauce My other friends ordered a few drinks and the Sesame Noodle and they said it was good, including the non-alcoholic horchata.  Overall, decent food... I wouldn't say its the best I've had, and yeah, I know... this place isn't a chinese restaurant, so I shouldn't really review it negatively, but gah, I'm now craving ""real"" Ma Po Tofu, which this place left me desiring. BATHROOM REVIEW: The bathrooms were kind of tricky. In the dimly-lit area, the picture of the mens and womens bathroom was the same. There were no letters, just drawings of silhouettes. I suppose you have a 50/50 chance of guessing the right bathroom. No worries, these are single private bathrooms so its all good. Inside, it was extremely clean and roomy. They had one of those xcellerator hand dryers that felt like it can blow the skin off your hands. Sit or squat? Sit!!",0.9942,0.749,0.179,0.072,0.48290598290598286

We showed up 30 min from that call and waited yet another 30 min! The infrastructure of this restaurant was poorly designed which leads to these infrequencies and frustration of patrons.

It was tart and spiced well. My friends said the sliders - which are the specialty at Mana Bar - were a bit dry. And the goat cheese/tomato sauce also came with overcooked toast.

We recently have a new vegetarian in our family - So, this seemed like the perfect place to try. Oddly enough, schedules went array that day so two of us ""non-vegetarians"" decided to still head down on our own to check it out.   What was appealing was that these were ""small plates"" which allowed us to try a variety of things (since vegetarian dining is a bit new to us).  The waiter was super friendly and super helpful, too. I can't say enough about how excellent the service was. Perfect combo of friendly, helpful, funny, personable - without being overbearing.  My dining companion started with one of the sake cocktails which they loved. Being that I was on meds and driving, I stuck with water. But, the cocktail menu is extensive (and oh so tempting). They also have a huge selection of juices and smoothies that sounded fabulous.  Our waiter made some very helpful recommendations and gave us some fabulous background on the restaurant and their philosophy re: actually using whole vegetables in their cooking (vs. meat substitute products, etc.).  Between the two of us , we had the following: Caponata (small size) - The flavor was bold and fresh. It was a very filling - but, light at the same time (if that even makes sense). It was served with delicious toasted bread.  Mana Slider - You won't miss the meat on this one! The texture was great and there was no lack of flavor. The patty of mushroom with brown rice bursted with flavor that was complimented perfectly on a Hawaiian roll. The spicy mayo was good - but, I didn't get very much flavor from it. The homemade pickles on the side (that you could put on the slider) were plentiful and were awesome (on their own or on the slider) - more, please!  Mushroom Sauté (small size ) - Here is what I have to say about this dish: Try it! The polenta was perfectly done, definitely on the richer side, though. And the mushrooms seemed to scream with flavor. Delicious is an understatement.  Bi Bim Bop (small size) - Whoa! Yum. Definitely on the spicy side. That said, it was the perfect level of heat for me. They also achieved the right amount of burn - not too much, not too little - without sacrificing darn good flavor. Rice was cooked perfect for me, as were veggies. The egg, perfectly done, was like a bow topping off a wonderfully wrapped present.  Creme brûlée - What can I say about this? Who doesn't love creme brûlée? And, if you don't, I'll help you out. That said, it was very good. However, not much different than others I've had. They had some wonderful sounding homemade sorbets of interesting flavors - look forward to trying that next time.  I will be back - for sure - with or without ""my vegetarian""!  There were so many other things I wanted to try and can't wait to go back to do so.

This place is as small as it can get and the wait times can be long on Fridays and Saturdays. But it is totally worth it as the food and the service is nothing short of amazing. To begin with we had the Mushroon Sliders, Gyoza and Chilli. Not many people can warm up to the idea of eating these items without meat, but if you try them, chances are you are start loving vegetarian cuisine. The highlight of the slider is the pickle which serves as a palate cleanser for every bite. The chilli was equally good and the Gyoza might take sometime for me to warm up as it tastes best with meat and not Tofu. After having food from US and Japan for appetizers, we decided to try food from Korea and Mediterranean. The BiBimBap and Baked Goat Cheese  are definitely worth trying though I do feel that they have been toned down to suit American taste buds. Some of the other items we tried were the Potato Pancakes, Sauteed Mushrooms and the Tamales.  Overall we left the place impressed with not just the food but also the service and the prices are definitely reasonable.

Hers was the pineapple and fresh ginger, which ended up being a little overpowering. I ordered the cucumber sakerita, which was pleasant and did indeed taste like a margarita.  The food is kind of pricey for what you get, but is admittedly well done. I got the small size pumpkin ravioli and it was really delicious. My friend got the vindaloo and really enjoyed it.

They're moist, cooked perfectly and have a warm spice.  I confess, I went back a couple nights later to take advantage of the happy hour special - two sliders and a beer for seven bucks.  I am seriously hooked on the sliders.  My only minor criticism would be that I wish the buns were whole grain, as they're the mushy white bread kind.   I also have to mention that service was fantastic on both nights.  Our servers were attentive and patient as we discussed the next small plate to order.  On both nights parking was easy.  I could see vegans/vegetarians and carnivores finding something delicious here.",0.9923,0.76,0.208,0.032,0.5482473544973544

Then my boyfriend got the butternut squash ravioli and I got the goat cheese roasted with spicy tomato. I'm big on goat cheese and this one blew me away.

At 2:30 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon, the inside of the restaurant looked dark--too dark--and moreover, I did not see anyone apparently working there in sight. The inside of this place looks like it would not be a comfortable place to hang out solo, since it seemed to be emphasizing some kind of hip and ""sexy"" feel that would put couples/those on a date in the mood... Considering I was dining solo, and appreciate both a quiet and a well lit space when dining alone, I already knew the indoor dining space was not going to be comfortable for me as a party-of-one. Before I decided to leave, and I was hesitant to do that as well because I just walked half a mile to eat here, the server showed up and asked how he could help me. Then I noticed the patio outside, which frankly is kind of ugly with green tables, and said I would like to sit over there. As I look over the paper menu and consult with Yelp, I notice that the baked goat cheese, mana slider, and ravioli all sound appealing... But when the server came to take my order he said they were having a special of a black bean soup & slider for $6.50. So price won out this time. The slider was absolutely delicious. My fellow Yelpers were spot on about that one. The black bean soup, however, was only mediocre and the beans did not taste completely cooked (not recommended as a highlight on Yelp).

2013-09-23,4.0,"A small, tasty, gourmet vegetarian restaurant... much-needed in Chicago! The space is small, very long and narrow.  It gets loud easily but not too overly so.  It feels very contemporary and sleek, which goes with their equally modern albeit somewhat schizophrenic menu. They offer Asian dishes like rice noodles, southwestern dishes like chili, Mexican dishes like burritos, Eastern European dishes like potato pancakes and even Italian dishes like ravioli.  That being said, all the flavors of these varied dishes work surprisingly well together! My friend and I ordered 5 small sized dishes to split between the two of us, and ordered a couple of cocktails (total came to about $57).  I got the rose sangria with pear nectar-- the pear really came out, and the cocktail was super light and refreshing overall.  My friend got the cucumber sakeria, which had a little more flavor, definitely more tartness and very fresh.  Both were tasty! Food-wise, I LOVED the Mana sliders.  They were super flavorful, and the texture was absolutely perfect.  That's the kind of dish where you use a fork to scoop up all the little tidbits that fell when you were eating with your hands.  GREAT spicy mayo, great patty, perfectly toasty but soft bun.  I was also pretty crazy about the rice noodles.  They were abundantly peanutty and just the right consistency, again with layered flavors.  That was a dish I couldn't leave any leftovers. One issue I have with some of their dishes in general is simply that they're not super interesting.  The avocado, arugula, and tomato salad is one example of that-- it's certainly not adventurous in the same way the other dishes are, and I'd go so far as to say it's not that creative.  To me, the gyoza kind of fall into that category as well.

2013-09-10,1.0,"I'm new to Chicago, and my daughter took me here. I brought my registered service dog with me, of course, as being epileptic, he accompanies me everywhere. He is, naturally, trained, quiet, and everyone loves him. Keeping my end of the deal as a person with a service animal, I immediately, upon entering, stated that he was such. The gentleman behind the bar asked me what that meant and admitted he didn't know the rules, so I informed him of them, and we were seated on the patio with no problems. I noticed, however, that just outside the patio entrance is a sign posted ""No Dogs Allowed"" with a line drawn through an image of a person with a dog on lead. There was no caveat stating anything about ""with exception to service dogs,"" as there is supposed to be when posting such a sign. I let it go, enjoyed my dinner and drinks, and easily overcame the ridiculousness of the young lad who later came on shift and walked over to our table after we had clearly been sitting there and eating a good while just to say, ""Um, we actually don't allow dogs here."" I went to the loo midway during my meal and decided to compliment the chef, Jill Barron, on the way out. She thanked me. Seemingly, all went well until it was time to leave and I was standing at the door to the loo waiting my turn, and Ms. Barron came out, saw the dog, and said, ""We don't allow dogs here."" I graciously replied that he was a service dog. She replied, ""It doesn't matter. We don't allow any kind of dogs here."" To this, I informed her that she was legally bound to allow my service dog into her establishment. At this, she stated that she had the legal right to supersede that law as a proprietor of this restaurant. I informed her that I would look into that, and she snapped, ""Please do!"" I was shocked! I wonder, would she have spoken so harshly and decisively to me had my handicap been more visible, say like blindness or in a wheelchair? Doubtful. But who knows? Word on the street is that she treats her employees pretty badly, as a friend who has lived her 5 years just told me today. Anyway, my daughter and I left with a very bad taste  in our mouths that was, to our relief, absolved as we walked a half a block up the street where my service dog was greeted by 2 lovely young womyn at the host desk of 4 Star Restaurant Group, asking if my dog wanted a treat, as they had a huge container of them and were passing them out to all passing by dogs! I'm not totally sure, but I believe one of them may have been the manager, Michelle Bieke. That's the name on the card she gave me, anyway. At any rate, we relayed the above story to these two bright and cheery young womyn, and they were equally shocked and said that my dog was welcomed any time. Since then (not the mention the countless times before then), my dog has been loved on at every establishment I've entered. It's incredible to me that this Jill Barron actually believes she is exempt from Federal Law! What an ego maniacal mentality. (Rather typical of a head chef, wouldn't you say?) My next move, of course, it to report her to the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as to let the city know of one of its establishments' guilt in breaking Federal Law!",0.9856,0.839,0.106,0.055,0.5292654435511578

As girls are wont to do on a Saturday night, they tried all the drinks ($9). The chai spiced plum nigori was milky but not overly rich and the plum added a depth of flavor . The cucumber sakeritas were also delicious and the pineapple ginger drink was so crisp and gingery, some girls thought they would be perfectly content with mana's drinks for life. And so in a group of 8, the ladies got to try nearly everything on the menu. The Mana sliders, potato pancakes and baked goat cheese seemed to get rave reviews so they started with those 3. They brought out a vegan menu to accommodate dietary restrictions. The Bibimbap, the saag paneer and the blue cheese endive salad was balanced, pleasant renditions of common staples. The ravioli with english peas and mushroom saute over creamy polenta disappeared so quickly some girls weren't even sure if they made it to the table. A curry cauliflower with kale and grilled asparagus with sweet miso sauce and black sesame seeds were also devoured joyfully.

2013-08-05,4.0,"This is a 4.5 review.  I think the only thing that's keeping it from being 5 stars is the ambiance (the seating is cramped) and the (not sure how to say it) professionalism of the staff.  This is not to say the staff is unprofessional.  They absolutely are not.  It's just that they don't seem to be at the level of professionalism as other restaurants in the area.  They're a little too laid back, I guess, which isn't a bad thing - it's just not representative of 5 star dining. Ok, onto the food.  Everything here is absolutely fabulous.  You can't go wrong no matter what you order.  A couple notes - the burrito is very spicy.  Stay away if you don't like heat.  The collared greens are incredibly smokey.  The texture is good, but there's a little too much smoke for my taste.

We got the cold appetizer sampler that came with the panzenella, quinoa and arugula with avocado.  All of it was good, but it wasn't ground breaking.  Each dish left you feeling as though yeah I could go home and make those relatively easily.  The Ma Po Tofu, was a little bland and one not and wasn't that great either.

The restaurant itself is small, so we sat on the patio seating. Now, this was my first time going to a vegetarian-only restaurant, but this was an ideal first-impression.  We started off with cocktails. I had the Almond Horchata which was combined with nigori (sake). Although this doesn't taste like my beloved Rumchata, it is quite refreshing. My friend ordered the Watermelon and Mint. Super fruity and refreshing as well.  As for food, Mana seems to be tapas-style serving. I ordered the MANA SLIDER, which is a MUST. As their description says it consists of brown rice & mushroom w/spicy mayo. I really liked the flavor and texture of the sliders. I've had portobella mushroom burgers before, but this was an interesting twist with the brown rice added.  I also had a side of the red cabbage slaw w/sesame & ginger, which complemented the sliders.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but friendly. Would I come back? ABSOLUTELY. and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.

Unfortunately I wasn't that hungry, otherwise I would have ordered more. Instead I opted for the baja corn and one slider. Let me state that I don't really do mushrooms. China has turned me off from eating them, unless they are in something. The slider was sooo good, with a spicy mayo on top. The corn was great and just enough, as they give you two small ones and are smart enough to put a wooded stick in them so you don't feel awkward picking it up.

I do think the cocktails are a tad pricey but they do make them strong enough for you to forget about it. And the fact that you can get a 'small' portion of food for half the price is really smart.

But for the sake of Yelp! glory, and because Mana deserves so many more good words, I will elaborate. Mana, to start, is quite small, cozy if you will, which I was totally OK with. It kept the decibel level lower and the experience more low key--no running around or anything like that. We were seated at the bar, which is long, staggered wood surface, and ordered some lovely wine to start the evening. I think it was the Malbec; I know it was quite tasty. Our palates freshened, and our bodies warmed on alcohol (as MtB would say), we took to the menu. And oh, the menu. We unintentionally took a world tour--started in Japan with the Gyozas, headed to India for some saag paneer, left for the Mediterranean with Spanikopita and baked Goat Cheese (or is that italian? French?), traveled to the American South for collard greens (though they were prepared much differently than they would down there), and ended a bit north (maybe the Pacific NW?) for the Sliders. In a word, everything consumed that night was scrum-tastical-yum. (It's still one word with the hypens...). I haven't had vegetarian pot stickers (Gyoza) in a long time; these made me wish I had found some. The saag paneer rivaled my favorite Indian place back in Iowa City (yes, Iowa City), which is saying a lot. The spanikopita was the best I've had in years. And the sliders, though a bit fragile, were delectable. I can say only good things about all the food. And then came dessert. I'm not much of a dessert person, but the chocolate... something crazy that we had, was pretty damn tasty. I think it had a caramel chip on top, and I remember it being pretty thick. I think food coma was setting in and had clouded my memory of the specifics, leaving recollection of only the general wonderfulness. Just eat it. I'd been to other tappas places, but it was lovely having a fully vegetarian menu; I didn't have to navigate it for hidden bacon here or there, or chicken stock in soup, and so on.

Bibimpop and mabo tofu both came with rice and were flavored JUST right. No, they're not going to be traditional style, obviously it's a fusion/inspired taste, but I think that it was done very well. Definitely reminds you of the original but has its own twist. Mac and Cheese was nice and creamy and I LOVE horseradish so that was just a nice surprise for me. Sliders don't even need to be talked about since everyone has already raved about it. But yeah it's so creamy and deliciousssss! Desserts - chai tea creme brulee (SO GOOD), and chocolate cheese cake (TDF!) I'm usually not a big chocolate dessert person but this one was not too sweet and the cheesecake was JUST creamy enough but does not overkill.",0.9883,0.813,0.163,0.024,0.6006802721088436

2013-01-27,4.0,"I came to Mana Food Bar with some friends on a Saturday night and was really impressed with what they've put together here. The menu is divided into cold and hot plates (and apparently the hot plates tend to be a little bigger). Most options are also offered either as small or large sizes. We were a little concerned about whether a ""small"" offering could be shared well among 4 people but it totally works out. We were told by our server that anything that everyone seemed to really agree on should maybe be ordered large and so we did this with the curry but it ended up that was the one dish we didn't finish.  I'd really recommend going small on everything, it doesn't seem to me that you get much of a price break for going large (it's seemed to be about twice the price of the small) and the small sizes give you a higher chance of hitting on something you really like. In the case you have a herculean appetite you can always re-order something. I also thinking that small sizes with a larger group keeps the price down. I spotted a couple other reviewers say that they thought it was overpriced but our group got out of their for just under $20 a person (with some drinks ordered) and we felt like we got a lot of food.  The food offerings were quite eclectic which always gives me pause at a vegetarian restaurant. Do I order something that is usually vegetarian at another restaurant as well but sounds good (mac & cheese?) or do I try to find the most unique thing on the menu. I tend to follow the latter doctrine, that I go to vegetarian places to order things I can't find elsewhere but some of the other folks were non-vegetarian so they probably aren't used to ordering mac and cheese at a BBQ place like I am. I thought the real stand out dishes were the baked goat, creamy polenta with mushroom saute. The chocolate cheesecake dessert was also pretty awesome and usually despite having a crazy sweet tooth I'm left disappointed at restaurant desserts that just don't deliver. I did think that some dishes were good but not as creative. If you can make a veggie chili at home that you really like, don't order it here! Again, this kinda relates to my doctrine of going to a vegetarian place to order stuff that I can't do myself.  The only downside of Mana Food Bar was that it took forever to get a table. We came at 7:30 on Saturday and were told it would take an hour. Turns out it took closer to two. We were told that this was pretty atypical from the host but once we were seated it seemed like the service was really leisurely (I'm hesitant to say slow, because they were so friendly, but they definitely weren't rushing anyone through). With a space this small, that's going to ensure that the tables don't turn over very fast.",0.996,0.832,0.139,0.029,0.5151811919736448

2013-01-10,5.0,"Living nearby, I'd been wanting to try this place for the past few years, but it never seemed to make the cut, until this past New Years Eve. We decided sort of late in the day that it would be fun to go to dinner with some friends before the NYE parties started, so I started calling around the city about 5 PM trying to find a reservation, which of course proved impossible.  The host at Mana told me that they didn't take reservations, but that they were pretty uncrowded and he had a 6 top that would be leaving in about an hour, so if I wanted to give my name and keep in touch with him about our plans, he'd try to seat us when they left.  Super accommodating and friendly, I love that! We weren't able to make it as early as we needed to to snatch up that 6 top, so I called him to let him know we'd take our chances at coming a little later.  He said he'd still keep us in mind and do the best he could, and let me know that they still weren't super packed for the holiday. We finally made it, where he greeted me and apologized that we would in fact have to wait a little bit, but offered us seats at the bar.  We were a bigger group and felt sort of in the way (it's tiny in there), so we opted to go across the street for a drink while we waited.  He took my number and called me about 15 minutes later saying, ""come on back!"" Enough about the amazing service, on to the food! I recommend coming with a group of friends so you can sample a larger variety of plates.  They have small plates and the menu is divided into hot items and cold items- for most of the items you can get a small portion or a large portion, which our waiter informed us was usually better if everyone was sharing everything.  My favorites were the sag paneer, bim bam bop, and the little side of polenta I got for myself. Can't speak much on their cocktails since I stuck with wine that night, but the overall feeling at my table was that everything was tasty.  They even adjusted one of their cocktails for my pregnant friend and made it a ""mocktail"" for her. Overall, great experience, good food!  We ate until we were stuffed and got out of there for around $30 a person, including drinks.  The awesome service was a big PLUS for me as there are so many times where a restaurant experience ruins gets ruined by a rude or inattentive waitstaff.

I decided to walk around rather than sit around in an awkward silence with such an unfriendly server. When I met up with my friend we decided to sit outside. It was probably one of the last summery days we were going to get to enjoy in Chicago.  I decided to order the goat cheese because, like I've said before, goat cheese can make anything taste good. And my friend ordered the beet salad and an avocado smoothie. My goat cheese was incredible. Actually it was one of the best goat cheese dishes I have gotten and I have gotten many. There was a ton of baked goat cheese on top of a delicate but plentiful amount of spicy marinara. Simply delicious. My friend loved his salad, but I did not try it. However, I had a sip of his avocado smoothie which was also delicious. I never knew how sweet and fruity an avocado smoothie could be (it was mixed with pineapples and a few other ingredients).  Ever since my first visit to Mana I have been craving the baked goat cheese. There is no way I will ever try something that can compete with it.

2012-09-04,4.0,"By far, my favorite vegetarian restaurant in the Chicago area.  Mana stands tall above the crowd in a city that has many great veggie options by 3 distinct factors: 1. Mana's menu manages to combine ethnic flavors from all over the world while still offering their own original creations.  The tapas style small plate options allow customers to try a variety of these flavors without having to pick just one. 2. Mana prices their food as a direct reflection of the cheaper cost incurred by vegetarian meals, rather than inflating all of their prices because being vegetarian and vegan is the trendy thing to do these days. 3. Mana proves that just because you're vegetarian, you don't have to eat bland food. I've been to Mana twice now and both times have been absolutely delightful.  I recently took my vegetarian parents who have a very particular taste for spicy and more flavorful food.  For two people who are used to the overpowering taste of Indian cuisine, they were thrilled to be able to enjoy new flavors at an all vegetarian establishment. I haven't tried much from the cold section of the menu, but here are my recommendations from the hot section: Mana Sliders - you can't leave Mana without trying the sliders.  They are full of flavor, have a hearty texture that is more ""meaty"" and less grainy, and they are pretty filling.   Potato Pancake - a great option to end your meal on, as this has a sweeter taste to it. Ma Po Tofu - a very tasty choice with a little bit of a kick to appease the spice lovers.  The black bean and chili paste flavor the tofu nicely and portion is a good size for sharing. Ravioli - one of Mana's very original creations.  The description sounds sketchy, but the blend of mint pesto and a zesty tomato is quite genius.  The sweet pea filling is perfectly matched with the hint of mint. Saag Paneer - I typically avoid saag paneer in Indian restaurants because I find the blended spinach consistency to be way too similar to baby food.  Mana's version of saag is more like chunks of spinach and is an Indo-american flavor fusion. Baked Goat Cheese - one of their least original items, but always a great starter dish. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.  Prices are very reasonable and each small plate is typically good to share between 4 people.  Service is friendly and quick.  The small space offers a cozy and hipster but casual vibe.  Mana's only downfall is that they don't take reservations.  I've never had to wait for more than 20 minutes or so, but I've also never gone on a weekend evening.",0.9974,0.811,0.173,0.016,0.5885068870523416
2012-09-01,1.0,"Eek. I'm not sure what happened when we went to Mana on Friday night. It looked nice, we were excited about the menu, and the service was good.  We got two salads: The spinach and pear and the heirloom tomatoes with tapanade and blue cheese. Both were great! But what came after was a total failure. We tried the mac n' cheese. It was completely awful! It was very bland and watery. Think kraft mac n' cheese with some horseradish powder, but then you put a little too much milk in so all the ""sauce"" hangs out at the bottom of the bowl. It also wasn't even as boldly flavored as kraft mac n' cheese. We were actually pretty stunned to get it in a restaurant. Then we got the Ma Po Tofu. Also bland! Maybe they are trying to play to people with very sensative palates because they actually brought it out with a green hot sauce, as if expecting that it wouldn't have much taste and would need something. Also, if you have ever had Ma Po Tofu in, say, Chinatown, you would know that whatever they served (lets call it tofu and still semi-hard eggplant in black bean chili paste) was not really Ma Po Tofu.  And then we got the Spanikopita. Now, it's really hard to mess up Spanikopita, and it's hard to make it bland since half of it is feta cheese. But honestly... ONE Spanikopita was almost $8.00. Too much for what we got.  All in all a pretty terrible experience after those salads, which honestly, you could make at home. It's called a mustard vinaigrette and some good quality tomatoes.

Mana's all-vegetarian menu is excellent in that it does not try to mimic or imitate meat products.  Instead it offers small plates (also available in a slightly larger format) from a variety of culinary types, so no matter whether you're in the mood for Japanese or American, Mana has you covered with ingredients in their unadulterated forms. Although I loved the concept, I felt as though the food fell short of my expectations.  For example, let's consider the Mana Slider - a brown rice and mushroom burger.  Not only was the taste of the burger bland, but the texture was very dry and crumbly AND it was not worth the $3.50 price tag per slider. The sesame noodles were a slight improvement.  Cold wheat noodles were prepared in a sesame peanut sauce.  Both the sauce and noodles had an overly gritty texture, which made it difficult for me to enjoy the actual taste of the sauce. We also shared the potato pancake, which can be repurposed as dessert because it is naturally so sweet and the golden raisin pear chutney pairs so well with the lightly fried pancake.  This was the one item from the menu that I actually really liked on that particular evening.

I love mushrooms, and the mushroom saute was incredibly tasty. The sauce and the mashed polenta was incredible. It was well made and melted in my mouth. I am used to have creamy mushrooms with mashed potatoes, but the polenta was certainly a better choice because of its texture. Next time I am certainly getting the large option. 5/5 2. We also got the Saag Paneer, which  was a moderately spicy and the spinach did a good job to balance out the paneer. If you want this dish spicier, they also bring you some green hot sauce that had a good kick to it. Overall, I think it was another 5/5 because it disappeared from our plates.  3. Although reluctantly, I decided on the Bi Bim Bop. I am used to having this dish on a still sizzling plate, so I was half disappointed it came in the same kind of bowl as the other two dishes. This, however, did not deter from the taste of the dish. After mixing in the egg, and adding a bit hot sauce --just because-- I enjoyed it quite a bit.

My party of 3 shared the Ma Po Tofu:   spicy eggplant, tofu, Chinese black beans and red chili paste over brown rice.  Again, ridiculously flavorful.  The tofu was still a nice consistency and held together well though it was not deep fried. The last thing we shared was the Bulgogi:  seared tofu with soy shitake mushrooms.  The tofu was seared to perfection.  Crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  It was also so flavorful.  The shitake mushrooms that accompanied the tofu were a little too salty on their own for my tastes but when eaten with the tofu, the saltiness mellowed out drastically. This place is definitely a little pricey considering the portions are on the small side, so it might be best to order the ""large"" sized dishes to get a better bang for your buck, especially if you're in a group of four or more.  They also have a stellar happy hour special that offers two Mana Sliders and any beer of your choice for $7.  Buy the beer and get the sliders for free!

I also tried the BULGOGI - seared tofu with soy shiitake mushrooms...slightly salty for my taste but I believe it was the shiitake mushrooms that gave it that kick.  The soy glaze was mouthwatering! Of course we had small portions so we also had the MA PO TOFU - spicy eggplant, tofu, chinese black beans and red chili paste over brown rice...OMG! has to be the best way I have ever eaten eggplant in my life! This dish packed an amazing flavorful punch that kept me coming back for more! Overall I'm a groupie of the mushroom sliders and you can't beat 2 sliders and a beer for $7.50 from 4-6pm everyday!!

Baked Goat Cheese - I mean, how can you go wrong?  Baked goat cheese with tomato relish and toast.  It was just so good and a good size for sharing with a few friends. Side of Creamy Polenta with Asiago - just like heaven. Fiddlehead Ferns - This was my personal favorite dish!  Fiddlehead ferns (imagine a texture between asparagus and brussel sprouts) served with sauteed snap peas, brown rice, miso glaze and apricots.  It was heavenly.  If I were to just order an entree, this would definitely be it! Mac & Cheese - My husband loved this take on mac and cheese with pepper and horseradish.   The noodles were nicely done and it had just a hint of spice.

There is something about taking whole ingredients and being able to incorporate them together into delicious dishes that is so impressive to me. It's simple but, it speaks volumes. We came in on a Sunday night at 9 and this place was still quite busy. It was quaint indoors and had a nice dining patio outdoors as well. There is no mistaking that this place is all sorts of Hipster with it's obvious location in Wicker Park and it's choice of food but, if I could pluck this place out of Chicago and place it in San Diego, I would do it in a heartbeat! We ordered the Sampler Plate as an appetizer: Five Spiced Tofu, Quinoa and, the Tomato, Avocado and Arugula Salad. The Five Spiced Tofu was my favorite. I read a lot of reviews that it was rather bland but, to be honest..it's firm tofu..what flavor did you expect it to take on when it's not smothered in sauce? The subtle flavors of the five spice tofu with the pickled red onions, tomatoes and basil complimented so well. The second favorite was the Tomato, Avocado and Arugula Salad. It had a similar flavor profile to the tofu in that it also contained tomatoes and pickled radishes. The Quinoa is also good though not our favorite. It was fresh with hints of orange and citrus.  In addition to the sampler we also ordered a Mana Slider and the Mushroom Saute. The Mana Slider wasn't bad for a vegetarian patty. The bread was toasty and it came with a powerful and spicy green sauce and refreshing cucumbers. The Mushroom Saute over the Polenta is a MUST! The cheesy and creamy polenta, the strong flavors of the mushroom saute..do yourself a favor and get this! It was our favorite dish out of the night.

Note, a small salad = tiny. Spinach and Pear Salad -- fine, salad. Hummus -- fine, a bit chunky, good tooth-feel? Five Spice Tofu -- fine, but bland (tiny, too). Ma Pao Tofu -- yum, ample size. Miso Brussels (REALLY SPICY) -- as though someone dumped a pound of horseradish mustard in w/ them -- delicious, but aggressive!! + 2 teas = $62 w/ tip. Classier than the Chicago Diner (duh), less spendy than Green Zebra, but was is amazing? No. But will I return? Yes.

But, after eating dinner at Mana Food Bar a few Saturdays ago, I am a convert! First of all, the atmosphere is lovely. The restaurant is gorgeous, I absolutely love the lighting. It is a small restaurant, and they don't take reservations, so I could see that being an issue. But, luckily I was just there with one friend, and we were there early before seeing a show. We sat at the bar and had great service. None of the cold plates really appealed to us, but all the hot dishes we had were great! The horseradish mac & cheese was delicious, though we both would have liked a more intense horseradish flavor. We also loved the slider, the mushroom saute, and the spanikopita. Interestingly, the best dish of the night was the brussels sprouts - the miso mustard sauce was fantastic.

2012-02-14,5.0,"Conclusion: I know conclusions are usually last, but my consulting experience has ingrained in to my mind to communicate in pyramid structure. Bottomline, I loved Mana.  It was really really good.  I don't know why I hadn't gone there earlier.  It's been in my bookmarks for forever.  I think one of my concerns had been that Mana would be one of those vegetarian restaurants that served entrees that were all about fake meats.  You know those places that try to simulate meat using soy or gluten or whatever.  Well, Mana was not about that at all.  Everything we had was just good ole vegetarian food.  They accomplish a wide variety of options by spanning cuisines.  You can get the Indian Palak Paneer, the Chinese Ma Po Tofu, the Italian Pasta, and on and on. Ambiance: The restaurant is really really small.  There only like 2 booths and 4-5 tables.  There are a number of seats along the bar.  The decor is pleasant. Getting seated: I do have to say that the one thing that is kind of annoying at Mana is that they don't take reservations.  So the wait was kind of long.  You can call in 20 minutes out to cut down some of that wait time.  While waiting, the bar is pretty accessible and they also have one of those enclosed heated tent thingies where you can wait without freezing. Service: The hostess was polite and the bar tender was really cool.  After getting seated, the waitress was also good.  Not great... not professionally trained hospitality management good, but she was good enough.  She was helpful with the menu and she came to check on us a couple of times and so on and so forth.  Definitely can't complain. Food: Here's where I thought Mana shined the most.  I may be biased being a vegetarian, but the stuff we tried was very flavorful and we loved the tapas-style concept so we could try a variety of entrees.  There's a cold side and a hot side to the menu.  On the cold side we had 5 spice tofu, which was interesting.  It's a salad-like item which unique flavored tofu and that caprese-ish taste as the dressing.  Then we had the maki rolls which were also really good.  No wasabi and the rolls don't even have rice.  It was like salad sushi.  Really interesting.  On to the hot side, this is where things got even better.  Oh, and they bring out the cold stuff first and the hot stuff later; I think the cold stuff is a first course kinda like salady course and the hot food is like the entrees.  The Ma Po Tofu was flavorful and was good.  The dumplings with soy sauce were really really good.  Fried perfectly soft and also crispy.  The best of all were the sliders.  Awesome veggie pattie; I think it's mushroom based.  It was so good.  I had just one slider, but I would LOVE to make a meal of like 5 of them just by themselves.  Last of all, we splurged and went for the creme brulee for dessert.  It was awesome!  I think they could've done more of the torched sugar layer on top, but the inside was like... idk... divine.  There was something different about it.  I don't know what they make it with, but I did taste a hint of caramel.  I think...  Anyway, it was really amazing.  They gave us some complementary brownies with baked-in cherries.  They were OK, but I didn't want to ruin the taste in my mouth from the creme brulee.",0.9993,0.729,0.23,0.042,0.6046759259259262

We ordered our wine and decided on four small plates to share: butternut squash ravioli, sliders, potato pancake, and bi bum bop. The ravioli came first and was good, but I thought that this was just another overly hyped up place by my friend. Then the sliders came. Absolutely delicious!! Amazing spices and so many layers of taste. The potato pancake with the chutney was equally as delicious along with the bi bum bop. They make their own green chile sauce which I wanted to drink. Apparently, according to our server, Phil, they are on the verge of selling their sauces. Yes please. Phil was great as well. Attentive but not overbearing. We never felt rushed even though there was a line to get in and we were finishing our bottle of wine. I can't wait to go back and try the saag paneer, okra with cheese grits and tamale.

My first selection was the day's special of lentil chili.  It was flavourful and came in a small bowl.  Perfect tasting size.  Next, I had the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash, accommpanied by olive oil, garlic, arugula, walnuts and asiago cheese.  It was delicious.  The bitterness of the arugula and tartness of the asiago cheese complemented the butternut squash.  For dessert, I tried the chocolate sorbet.  It was not to my liking, so I only had two spoonfuls.   My companion had the potato pancakes with pear chutney and crema.  I tried the pancakes plain and they were nothing spectacular.  Hence, the sauce.  Her tamale made of blue corn and plaintain was quite bland.  She enjoyed the tomato jam that came with it.

We ordered a lot of food so here goes: Avacado, pineapple, and coconut water- very good but a but pricey for $8 a cup.  Entrees: baked goat cheese: served with spicy tomato sauce and toasts. This was a bigger portion than I had expected...goat cheese was so nice and creamy. Nice chunks of tomatoes in it too.  Potato pancake: sweet and white potato with apple cranberry chutney and crema. Loved the thin pieces of pancake with the nicely sliced cranberries...it was soo yummy! Chili- corn, black beans, chickpeas, green onions and white cheddar. Nice and tasty chili. Chunky and perfect cup without the huge portion so you don't get sick of it.  Curry- spicy potato and peas over coconut basmati rice with cilantro relish. Curry was very good, but wished there was more curry instead of being so chunky.   Gyoza: six pan seared dumplings with soy sauce to dip. I don't really know what I was going to get with this....but it reminded me of egg rolls...it was good.  Mushroom sauté: over creamy polenta...not the biggest fan of this. Didn't see anything special about it.  Mana slider: brown rice and mushroom burger with spicy mayo....Oh my.....amazing sliders.....a must get....need I say more....the sauce was amazing.  Ravioli: butternut squash stuffed pasta with olive oil, garlic, arugula, walnuts, and asiago cheese. Nice ravioli....I have had this somewhere else....but the butternut squash inside was nice and creamy, while the asiago cheese could sometimes be a little overbearing for the ravioli, but it was done almost perfect here.

2011-12-28,4.0,"My ""I eat anything"" friend  was visiting town and wanted to go out for dinner. We don't talk daily so it was news to me when she announced that she had recently become a vegan. That knocked every one of my ""ooh, I want to try that place"" options out of the running and the search was on. I know that the vegetarian options in the city are plentiful but I wasn't quite sure about vegan. One of the reasons I love yelp is the search option. I typed in vegan and looked for  an average of at least 4 stars. Mana was one of the first few places to catch my attention since they also had vegetarian options and not just Vegan.   So...we arrive on a weekday evening and the place is pretty  small but we were quickly seated at the bar where I ordered a nice glass of tempranillo. Their wine list isn't huge but they have some nice selections. My friend and I started with the hummus and as simple as it is, the hummus was really good and fresh. For the main event I had a brown rice and mushroom burger with spicy mayo known as the mana slider and okra braised with tomato, cayenne, cumin and served over buttermilk blue cheese grits. Everything was seriously awesome!  Great flavors, no weird texture issues, and quite filling. We ended the meal with another glass of wine, this time a malbec and a nice dark chocolate mousse of some sort. I can't recall the exact name for it, but it was delicious and sadly I was too full to have more than a few bites. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the service.

2011-11-08,5.0,One of my favorite places in the neigborhood. I'm not a vegetarian but the food is so good you don't miss the meat. I like the ambiance especially when you can eat outside and people watch on Division. Love that they offer small and large plates. My faves are the mana slider and the sweet potato pancakes. Great for casual lunch or dinner try to go during the week as its pretty small and gets crowded on the weekends and no reservations.,0.9863,0.656,0.318,0.026,0.645436507936508

It's small inside (cozy? more like a little cramped) but I haven't had to wait for a table yet.  Baked goat cheese is delish. Chili was good but not my favorite (I guess I just prefer mine with meat, but husband who is a bona fide meat-eater said he thought the chili was great). The sliders live up to the hype-- EAT THEM. Basically I haven't tried a bad thing yet, and everything is yummy. For dessert, you can't beat the chocolate pot de creme. It's like... grown up chocolate pudding. Freaking delicious. I love the touch of creme fraiche on top.  I'm not giving up meat/dairy/whatever any time soon, but it's nice to try a place that is delicious and just HAPPENS to be veg as I'm trying to eat a more plant-based diet. Truthfully, if it tastes bad, it doesn't matter if it's good for you because you won't want it. Mana is delicious, hands down.

2011-11-03,3.0,"Based on my understanding of the word ""mana"", calling your restaurant that is a bit ambitious. So had to try it. Honestly, it took me about 10 minutes to realize I was looking at a vegetarian menu. That could be a good thing - the food options had enough going on in them to hide the fact they lacked meat - or a bad thing - there was way too much going on in this menu. The menu has an identity crisis. Thai, Italian, Indian, Chinese, Korean, American... I guess the common ground of all being vegetarian is enough? Not for me when it is small plates, as we ordered multiple dishes which led to way too much confusion in my mouth.  I suggest ordering the large portion of one item instead of sampling multiple items, to avoid the lack of cohesion that you get when you order tapas at a Spanish place for instance. We had: sesame noodles (decent, but can get same taste but more for the money at a chinese takeout); saag paneer (enjoyed it); bi bim bop (not very exciting and egg was overdone); and okra (i wished the okra had not been whole so that it could have absorbed some flavor and been easier to pair with the grits, which were wonderful). It was a bit cramped and loud. Service was good. Maybe the ""mana"" is in that they can magically hide the fact that there is no meat on the menu. I, though not being vegetarian, rarely care about such a thing, so no spells were cast on me. That being said, I will return for the chili!",0.1254,0.857,0.064,0.079,0.4629770766867542
2011-11-03,5.0,"Author's note: I am not a vegetarian. BUT this place was AMAZING. It's a cozy, small place right on Division that you could easily walk by (unless you paid attention to the outdoor patio with heaters).  We had a group of four and were seated in a equally cozy booth. Only one of us was a seasoned vet, so we asked the waiter how to best order (the menu is full of small and large dishes). We opted to order a few dishes then go split-sies. First up - AVOCADO, ARUGULA AND TOMATO salad: at first glance, we thought we ordered the small, but it turns out it was the perfect size to start the meal. Equal parts avocado, argula and tomato - it wasn't dressing overload. GYOZA: perfectly sized dumplings with perfectly sized soy dipping sauce. Yes please! BAKED GOAT CHEESE: I'm not a goat cheese fan so I didn't try it BUT I can vouch for the rumblings of my co-eaters. Lots of ooohs and ""ahhh this is soooooooooo goood"" RAVIOLI: had a slight kick to it, but I dug the tomatoes in that sauce. Mm! SPANIKOPITA: this was easily my favorite part of the meal. Flaky filo filled with spinach and feta? Oh my tummy! I could have devoured the whole thing but luckily was taught to share at an early age. CREAMY POLENTA: okay, maybe this was my favorite part too. I am now a polenta lover! To cap it off, we ordered the green tea cheesecake and banana-chocolate sorbet. I can only comment on the sorbet because I'm not a cheesecake eater.

Looking at the menu ahead of time, I had no idea what to expect.  I kind of expected to show up at some sort of hole in the wall place, but Mana was really nice.  As others have said, the restaurant itself is tiny, but even on a cold-ish, rainy night we were able to eat on the patio.  And by patio, I mean solid, tent-like enclosure. As a vegetarian, it's always overwhelming to go to a restaurant where I can eat everything, so I convinced my dining companion to share a bunch of things with me.  Between the two of us we split chili, a salad, sushi, goat cheese, sliders, artichoke ravioli, sliders, and a couple desserts.  Oh, and hummus.  There wasn't anything I didn't like, to be honest.  Every dish was fresh and flavorful...but the goat cheese...amazing!  I could have eaten the entire crock of it myself.  The one disappointment?  The sliders.  Not sure why everyone likes them?  Maybe I was still in lust with the goat cheese, but I just didn't enjoy mine.  Glad I only ordered one!

2011-10-20,2.0,"Wow, after reading a sampling of the reviews, I was really expecting a great dining experience. I even went in with a more open attitude, as I normally dismiss vegan-friendly establishments as a complete waste of time/money/thought. Sadly, Mana only succeeded in further ingraining the negative stereotype I have of these socially conscious frotteurs who try to claim that ""fresh = best."" That mantra can most definitely apply, but not in this case. Highlights - the chili was indeed outstanding, flavorful, peppery, hearty, and could stack up to most meaty doppelgangers out there  And the portions were solid for 4 offerings we tried Lowlights 1) mushroom/brown rice slider was all rice with a hint of mushroom and had the consistency of that burned rice you get at the bottom of the rice cooker - it's like they intentionally overcooked rice, scooped out the edible portion on top, then scraped out the crusty gunk at the bottom for use as the glorious foundation for the slider. 2) saag paneer - bland, bland, bland. how could an indian inspired dish, with cheese cubes no less, be so devoid of taste? when I eat indian, i expect my senses to be assaulted with spices and the occasional rake across the eyes as said indian tries to defend himself against my cannibalizing his still wriggling torso  3) rice noodles with kimchee - as a korean, i felt most offended by this abomination. it seems like they were trying to make the traditional korean soup, chigae, but failed both in execution and innovation. if you're going to go the ""fusion"" route, at least get the basic flavor right! and the broth was lukewarm, which is just a horrible temperature for chigae. The space is also extremely cozy, which is code for cramped as shit. I realize you need to maximize space, but you literally couldn't slide a single White castle patty between the space that separated our table from our neighbors.    The service was great, which saved this from being a 1 star experience.  If i'm going to sell ou to vegan/vegetarian again, I'll stick with Native Foods.",0.9559,0.783,0.13,0.087,0.5144308943089432

One of my friends is vegan and she had plenty of choices, which is always a bonus because she often has difficulty finding more than a scant few vegan options in vegetarian restaurants. I loved that we had the option of ordering small portions for most dishes. We did that to create a a tapas-style meal so we could try a lot of things. Each dish was better than the one before! The standout to me was the sweet pea ravioli with tomato, mint pesto and asiago. Do not NOT order this if you go. It's a-mazing! The only thing that was not exceptional was Mana's version of a tamale. It was not nearly as flavorful as the other dishes. The other thing about this place is the ambiance. It is small but very tastefully decorated--a mix between modern and rustic with no pretension. It has a cozy, romantic feel. It would be a great place to bring a date. The service was good but not excellent, but hey, we all left feeling really happy having stumbled upon some of the best vegetarian food in the city. Highly recommended.",0.9973,0.702,0.25,0.049,0.5715765765765767

My traveling companion (a meat lover) and I (a vegetable lover) stopped into Mana last Friday night on a whim after several local  recommendations. Well, we were VERY glad that we did. There was a very nice outdoor seating area (as is the Chicago way), but it was a steamy hot evening, so we chose to sit inside. The inside of the restaurant is quite small, and all the tables were taken, but they had a nice bar area (with very cool bar stools). The atmosphere was relaxed and fun. We sat down, ordered some wine, and started to systematically work our way through the menu. Everything was very good, and we would recommend the Avocado, Arugula and Tomato Salad, the Ravioli with Sweet Peas, Tomato, Mint pesto, and Asiago Cheese, and two yummy sides...Asparagus with Black Sesame Seeds and Miso Mustard Sauce, and the Baja Corn. Waitstaff was also friendly, relaxed, and didn't mind us spending time enjoying our food. Even the meat lover was pleased! I can't wait to go back.",0.9973,0.712,0.273,0.015,0.4892676767676768

The fact that it's vegetarian only made it that much better.  3 of us were able to easily get a table because we came in early for dinner around 5. I would definitely call to make a reservation if you're going at a more normal time for dinner because it's a really tiny restaurant. There's tables which have booth seating on one side and chairs on the other side. You end up sitting extremely close to whoever is at the next table. I was a little unsettled when I didn't see the table/booth seat next to me get cleaned down well when the couple that was sitting next to us left (they had a small child with them who had been spilling stuff all over the place). It's pretty dark in the restaurant so there's no way to really tell how clean things are.   We shared the baked goat cheese which was absolutely delicious, albeit spicier than any of us expected. We ran out of toast to have with the baked goat cheese, but our waiter brought out extra toast although it was towards the end of our meal. I really appreciate that he recommended dishes when my friend asked about what he liked on the menu. I ordered the sliders, which contained brown rice, which I thoroughly dislike, but they were really delicious. They tasted healthy and flavorful. I would definitely recommend an appetizer to have with them since they are pretty small, especially if you're a guy. One of my friends ordered the bi bim bop which she really liked. My other friend ordered the rice noodles, which he said was decent but lacked a ton of flavor. All of our meals didn't end up being very pricey which is also nice.

Now, he has been here before, but this was my first visit, and I have to say that I wish I had been going here for a long time.  The food is amazing and the service (which some have had issues with) was fine. Sure, it is a very laid back and the small staff might take a few minutes to get to you, but they are nice, and once your order is in, I found that the place ran like clockwork. We ordered a sampling from the menu and our food came out in intervals and the servers were nice.  After settling on some drinks we decided on the pickles to start and what came out was a small tapas portion of okra, pickled tomatoes, and rhubarb. It was a nice start. After this came our seared tofu which was great. This was the sort of thing you try to make at home but can never pull off. Simple, and perfect. After this our Saag Paneer came out and this was a unique spin on this Indian classic. I really loved it and it was again that kind of simple dish you would make at home if you knew you wouldn't mess it up. Why bother, just come here! Next came the famous sliders and again I was very happy with what we had. We also had an order of Collard greens and likewise, I wanted to and think I can start cooking these at home more often. Yum. The last thing we had was the rice noodles and I have to say that I was not really a fan of this dish. It was good, and the presentation was perfect, but I wish we had opted for something else.  The small plates came and were more than enough for two of us to be happy and experience some wonderful food.  The bill for two was about $80 with all that food and two drinks each. They seem ok with people drinking lots of water so if you want to drink from the water bottles they bring to you, go ahead and save the $30.  One thing, as long as the patio is open they are running a two slider and one beer special between 4 and 6 pm. This happy hour is a steal, and I am probably going to go here a bunch of times.

Most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are pretty homey/comfortable, which is great and all... except if you want to feel like an adult about to have a night on the town.  I had the thai coconut dish.

My friend had the sliders and I can't remember what my other friend had. There is a ""small"" and ""large"" option for each dish.

2011-06-20,2.0,"There are 381 reviews on Mana, so why is this one any different? Because I did not enjoy my experience at Mana. For months I've been dying to go here. After hearing raves from my friends and with an average of 4.5 stars on Yelp, how could I go wrong? Not to mention, the owners also run Sushi Wabi, Veerasway and De Cero. All of which my boyfriend has positive regards for. Mana does have outdoor seating, if you can tolerate the traffic noise of Division. My highly-anticipated experience of dining outside was cut short when I was painfully bitten by several red mites. It also took our waiter a considerable amount of time to give us our menus and take our orders. The restaurant wasn't busy at all. He just stood behind the bar the entire time. Anyway, we moved inside to avoid being bitten by more bugs. FYI: The bug bites did not affect the star rating, as Mana has little to no control of the outdoor ""unpleasantries"". Here is opinion of the food: Watermelon Lemonade -- Just awful. It tasted like bitter watermelon rind. It was also too watery and lacked any lemonade flavor. (Note: Watermelon lemonade is very popular at summer festivals. The difference is that those lemonades are served with chunks of watermelon.) Seaweed Salad -- Bitter and bland, but I liked the subtle smoky flavor the sesame dressing. Beet Salad -- A good, but typical beet salad. The crisp, slightly tangy apples paired well with the sweet sliced beets. Bulgogi -- Essentially, a block of tofu marinated in soy sauce. The mushrooms was very savory and delicious. Had it been sliced and served with rice like real bulgogi this dish would've been really good. Ravioli -- Tasted frozen but the sauce was delicious enough. $7 for three SMALL pieces of frozen ravioli is an outrage. Slider -- At $3.50 a pop, it's pretty pricey for a slider. It was one of the better veggie burgers I've had. The mushroom and rice patty with the spicy mayo was heaven .... in two bites. At almost $50 for lunch for two people, Mana is expensive. The small dishes were very small, with the exception of the Beet Salad. I am no stranger to tapas, and just three tapas can fill me right up. Not Mana's tapas-style dishes. We left the restaurant feeling (very) hungry. The food was average AT best, but OVERPRICED. I can justify paying more for good vegetarian fare, but I have had much better elsewhere. What a shame. I had such high expectations for Mana due to its reputation and rating. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to ANY of them. I don't know what other people were thinking. It must be ""vegetarian blinders"", as my boyfriend calls it. Instant adoration of a restaurant because it is vegetarian.  Note: The maximum indoor capacity is 34 people, but it's not worth the wait (or visit).",0.9936,0.793,0.141,0.066,0.5166579327105643

2011-05-09,5.0,"Wow! We've been to Mana twice now, and both times the food was excellent. This place also has the rare distinction of being even better the second time I ate there! I wish I could remember what we ordered the first time, but it was a while ago.  This most recent visit, we started with the sampler appetizer, for which we chose 5 spice tofu, avocado, arugula and tomato salad, and seaweed salad. All were delicious but my favorite was definitely the avocado salad. The amount of dressing was perfect, and everything tasted incredibly fresh. My husband also ordered the soup of the day, which was spicy tomato and artichoke soup. It was not amazing, but definitely had a ton of artichoke flavor. I probably wouldn't order it myself. For the main dishes, we ordered sliders, gyoza dumplings, and ravioli which I believe had mint pesto, tomato sauce, and peas. The sliders were basically the best veggie burgers I've ever eaten. Perfectly cooked with tons of mushroom flavor. The sauce was flavorful but not overwhelming. I swear I could eat about 10 of these. The gyoza dumplings were good, not out of this world (they paled in comparison to everything else). The ravioli was delicious--the sauce was very hearty, almost meaty in texture, and the overall flavor combination worked perfectly. I usually don't like mint-flavored foods, but I loved this. In general, the ingredients are extremely fresh and the flavors in every dish complement each other really well. The dish sizes were perfect and I left feeling very satisfied (although my husband said he wishes the portions were a bit larger). The restaurant is cozy, so be prepared for a wait (we sat at the bar and were seated right away on at 6:30ish Saturday night), and it can get loud depending on the size of the other parties. So that said, I probably wouldn't go with a large group of people, especially since I don't think they take reservations. But I will definitely be back for a nice date night with my husband.

2011-04-19,5.0,"Mana I love this place!  What an adorable little restaurant - you're lucky enough to even find the place and you're liable to walk right before realizing you've passed it. Once you get inside, you're greeted by a friendly host and although you may have to wait a LONG TIME (like an hour or more at peak times), they happily take your cell phone number and will call you when your table is ready. Yes the restaurant is small and yes you have to squeeze yourself through the tiny crevices between tables to get to your seat, but it's so worth it, I'm happy they crammed the tables in there.  Now, Mana is a vegetarian restaurant. And they don't serve any faux meats. And I appreciate that, mainly because faux meats in general scare me and never live up to my expectations because they never live up to the real thing. Instead of boca-burger esque sliders, their sliders are mushroom and bulgur sliders which are DELICIOUS. I also loved their Beet Salad and Polenta with Asiago cheese....it tasted straight up like mac & cheese. Service is fast and attentive.  Mana makes you happy to be a vegetarian - and I'm not, but I strive to be more often. You never miss meat when you're dining there and the uniqueness and versatility of their menu makes it so much fun. For dessert, we had the lemongrass creme brulee and the raspberry cheesecake, both delicious. I will say one oddity we encountered was that they only serve French Vanilla flavored coffee. Now I personally hate even the smell of flavored coffee, so that was a little unusual that they wouldn't have regular coffee, but oh well.  All in all service is great, food is amazing (you'll want to order everything off the menu), and the bill, not bad at all my friends.

We were pretty hungry so we ordered the five spice tofu, sesame noodle salad, bibimbop, mana sliders, sweet potato pancake, and chili. The sesame noodle salad and the potato pancake were delicious. The chili was decent. I really liked the cheese they put on top. Everything else was kind of meh. The five spice tofu didnt' have that much five spice flavor and there were only a few slices of tofu (mostly veggies).  Not very exciting. The bibimbop sauce was too salty and didn't taste like real bibimbop. I guess it's a variation on bibimbop but I wasn't a fan of the sauce. The mana sliders were so heavy, I could barely get one down. The patty kind of overpowered the spicy mayo too. All i could taste was rice and mushroom.

2011-04-16,4.0,"I'm one of those people who typically hates vegetarian restaurants...fake meat? Not my thing.  But Mana does it right. No fake meat here, just creative food.  The restaurant itself is incredibly small, and the ambiance is sleek and modern (if not a little dark and lacking dimension). The food at Mana is served as small or large plates, which gives you the option of sticking to one larger dish, or trying a variety of small plates. We went with the small plates, as there were several things on the menu we were curious about. We tried: Pickled Things: Mana pickles their vegetables in-house, so the selection is always different. Our plate consisted of pickled wasabi string beans, white kimchi and turnips. It was...interesting. Definitely not bad, just...unexpected. I think it's a plate worth trying, as you never know what you'll get.  I was particularly hesitant to try the pickled turnips, and they actually ended up being my favorite. Crisp, fresh and...well, pickle-y. Sliders: If you go here, I demand you try these.  You will thank me later, I promise. I think the ""patty"" is made with brown rice and mushrooms, and is topped with a spicy mayo.  Just trust me, you won't be sorry. 4 bites of awesomeness. Pierogis:  This was actually my favorite dish of the evening. The filling was farmer's cheese and potato, and they were sautéed in some kind of brown-butter sage-y goodness, and had some sautéed apple chunks as a garnish, which complemented the pierogis perfectly. Rich, velvety and delicious. Bibimbap: What this version lacked in meaty-ness, it definitely made up for in flavor.  The sauce they used was excellent - not too spicy, but just enough kick to remind you that this was not a boring vegetable stir-fry.  The vegetables were cooked to perfection, with just enough snap to keep them tasting fresh.  If you were coming here on your own and only wanted to try one thing, this would be a great choice. Really, the only qualm I had about Mana was the service. It wasn't particularly bad, but the servers were very short (in manner, not in height...hah).  They didn't seem to be particularly happy to be there, even though the restaurant wasn't busy and (I'd like to think) we were quite easy to please as customers.  Overall, if you're craving vegetarian food, go to Mana.

2011-04-15,3.0,"I've had Mana's sliders at festivals and record fairs, and they are pretty flavorful. Made from rice and mushrooms, the sauce is perfect and the patty stays together. Looking at Mana's menu a thousand times, I knew I wanted to try the place and get a better feel for what they were all about. I finally made it out here on a Thursday night. We were a party of three and at 7:15pm, the wait was about an hour, hour and a half. Okay, that was expected. The place is tiny - and I mean, tiny - so we gave our number to the hostess and got some drinks while we waited.  An hour and fifteen minutes roll by, no call. Okay, that might be normal. One of us goes to check and they said that a table would be ready in 15 minutes, so we saunter down. Once we get there, there are no tables ready. We wait for about 20-30 more minutes after ordering a couple drinks. Finally, we were given a table and were able to order. Among all of the dishes we ordered, the chili, slider, sweet potato pancake, and the baked goat cheese stood out. We could do without the ravioli, and the asparagus my friend ordered came at the very end (while the chili came out first?). Small dishes were fairly small. Large dishes were fairly large. I definitely feel that some of the food here is overpriced - $9 for baked goat cheese and 5 tiny slices of burnt and wimpy bread? Really? $4 for a tamale? I get that this place is a ""food bar,"" but I didn't get the prices in relation to food portion. Maybe that's just me. We also ordered a bottle of wine, and our waitress poured some of the wine into one of my glasses that had a different wine in it. Yeah, not cool. I didn't really stop her, either, but honestly - I just didn't care at that point.  The coconut and lime juice sake cocktail was fresh and delicious, which was a definite plus. Don't know if it was worth $8, but it was good. Don't know if I'll ever come back here.

2011-04-11,4.0,"I'll admit, I'm a bit conflicted on this place. I have all these wonderful thoughts and aspects that I loved about Mana, but when I drill down to each dish and think critically about the food I'm left wanting more. Part of that is probably the nature of a strictly vegetarian restaurant and the niche market it serves. Mana doesn't need to appeal to everyone (and they certainly couldn't fit them anyway) but it does a great job of filling a void that Chicago lacks with respect to the vegetarian and vegan friendly crowd. Mana is a very small storefront on Division (and just a block from my new place :) with simple but great wood decor and seating that reflects the subtle Asian influence. As the name implies, there's a long bar that runs the length of the other side of the space - and since we're all crossing our fingers for more good weather, there's a nice outdoor seating area.  The menu is great and approachable, divided into Hot and Cold dishes. Each item is offered in two sizes so you can customize how much you want to share and eat family style or not. Lucky for me my three companions were up for trying lots of dishes. Unfortunately we did not get to enjoy any of the sake list or cocktails (we had already had plenty before arriving late in the evening). And this is where my conundrum starts - I really like the space, the service, the concept, the menu and the value. I just don't know if there are enough things to draw me back on a regular basis (and for other people like me that enjoy meat and fish). My three favorite dishes were the sliders, sesame noodles and asparagus. The mushroom and rice sliders are probably their most famous dish and for good reason. They were fantastic and served with a slightly spicy mayo on a delicious (read: likely unhealthy) mini bun. We ordered three to start, and ended up getting three more later. Yea, silly but amazing. The sesame noodles are a staple on most Chinese/Asian restaurant menus. Mana does a nice job with them and I appreciate the kick with the peanut sauce. I'd order that again. The asparagus was our last (before sliders round 2) dish and pretty good. It's simple but they were well grilled and served with a tasty sauce.  The other four plates we ordered had varying degrees of satisfaction. The pierogis were only ok, the best part being the apples and dill on the side. I liked the arugula, avocado and tomato salad though it was quite simple and plain enough to replicate at home. My least favorite dish was the tofu. I didn't enjoy how it was cooked or flavored (hard and rubbery almost) even though the vegetables with it were pretty good. Finally, I was recommended to try to the Bi Bim Bop (with hot pepper miso and vegetables over brown rice and sunny side up egg). There was a lot of potential and good flavors but I don't think the execution was all there. We loved the spicy sauce and brown rice and there didn't seem to be enough vegetables to make it worthwhile. After all of that did I mention that it only cost $20 per person before tip? Not too bad.  Mana is by far the most interesting and best tasting vegetarian restaurant I've been to in a while and they deserve all the praise from their devoted following. It's a fun time with good food, especially if you're looking for a healthy break from the routine.",0.9994,0.712,0.25,0.038,0.5950608797767886
2011-04-07,5.0,"Having a birthday that falls during lent while you're trying to give something up can be hard.  So, when I gave up meat for lent this year, I knew my birthday dinner would have to be at a veggie restaurant.  I have dabbled and enjoyed the fine vegetarian cuisine of Chicago Diner, Pick me up Cafe, Soul veg etc.  But there isn't anything quite like this experience that I have found, for vegetarians, in Chicago.   Mana was amazing! The menu had a lot of different types of cuisine ranging from American to Mexican and Asian.  I thought the portions and ordering style were both fun (great for groups/sharing) and vast. As my partner said, it was sort of tapas style meets vegetarian.  As a person who LOVES burgers, I will say you cannot miss out on the Mana Slider.  Sometimes even the best of meat substitutions miss some of the flavor and savory satisfaction of a real meat burger, but this did not.  This is hands down, the best non-meat burger that I've ever had.  It was made with brown rice and mushrooms but you could ALMOST be fooled into thinking it was ground beef.  And GOOD ground beef.  There was simply nothing we tried that we didn't like and you can really pick and choose from a great variety of options. Beyond the food, the waitstaff was super friendly and our food came out very quickly! The ambiance is very modern and chic, it has a great New York, tiny packed foodie spot quality to it.  A great spot for a date or a special occasion!  It isn't the cheapest date but I will say that I did feel rather full afterwords and if you're looking to peruse a great new veggie spot, then put on your nice shoes and jacket and check this one out!

Other things to try that were also delish were the Beet Salad and the Mushroom Saute.

MANA is such a cozy and comfortable bar that greeted warmly. I sat in the front, dark leather booth and observed how someone obviously put a lot of love and  money into designing this shop.  My server seemed genuinely eager to help me get started so I ordered a nice glass of the Rhone blend to sip on while waiting for my friend to park and come inside.  I told my server about our Karyn's experience and she sympathized and said she hoped that I'd really enjoy our lunch with them, recommending a few dishes. There are so many intriguing items on the menu that I it was hard for me to make a starter decision. Ultimately I picked the maki roll wrapped in collard greens and stuffed with avocado, carrot, brown rice and a few other veggies.  I was concerned that the roll might be miniature-sized but it it was somewhat thick and hearty. I grew up in Mississippi and wondered if the collard greens would be too tough to eat raw, but they were quite tender and wonderful. Why hasn't this been tried before or often seen? It was amazing and I much preferred it to the traditional rice and seaweed wrappings. The ponzu sauce complimented it well. My friend arrived, we discussed the menu and bit and he opted for the Spanakopita with red cabbage, I ordered a side of the mouth-watering garlic black beans that had a nice refried beans type consistency.  I also ordered a large rice noodles in thai coconut milk broth with butternut squash, tofu, basil, mint and green onion along with the bi bim bop - hot pepper miso and vegetables over brown rice and sunny side up egg. Adding the butternut squash to rice noodles certainly kicked the dish up a few notches, creating such a slightly sweet broth.  There were a few fresh basil and mint leaves that underscored the freshness of all ingredients. Lovely dish!  And it was my first time having bi bim bop. I loved the charred, juicy taste and the egg was pure gluttony. We finished up with a couple desserts, my friend opting for the smokey chicago sorbet with a dried slice of pineapple I think and I went for some sort of raspberry mousse over chocolate brownie slither drizzled in caramel. Both were exceptional. The sorbet made me want to light up a couple Romeo y Julieta Dominican cigars and swig a goblet of Cognac.

I first tried Mana back in the summer of 2010 but we sat out on the patio. Last night I finally went inside to dine. I will tell you it's a super tiny set-up inside, but very cozy and comfortable. They do a great job with their layout inside. The service at Mana is beyond excellent. Servers are prompt, friendly and knowledgeable.   Our party started off with the pickled vegetables (I don't like pickled things) and they were amazing. Hands down best pickled vegetables I ever had. We then had the Mana sliders and they had brown rice and mushrooms, with a little spicy mayo and a side of pickles I believe they were only 3 bucks each of goodness.  The pineapple and fresh ginger sake cocktails were so fresh, they made me feel like a million bucks. This place is gem, I can't wait to go back.

2011-02-24,5.0,"Like the next person, I can appreciate the succulence of a piece of pork belly, or enjoy a melt-in-your-mouth bite of real barbecue chicken, but overall, I try to steer (har har) clear of meat. Maybe it's because, oh, I don't know, I grew up in England during the 90s and Mad Cow disease was rampant and frightening and no one wanted to run the risk of eating contaminated meat? But, as an adult, I went back to meat, only to find that it mostly doesn't make me feel all that hot, and the stone-in-your-stomach sensation can be a bit much. A few bites of chicken are great, a whole big chunk? Not so much. With that in mind we decided to check out Mana Food Bar in the trendy Wicker Park neighborhood. The entire menu is vegetarian in an intimate setting - a setting that was so popular that by the time we left, there was a line out the door. Some of the tables along the left of the image are a teensy bit too close for comfort, particularly when one is seated next to an overeager young hipster with one too many ""likes"" and long hair.

2011-02-13,5.0,"I REALLY liked this place! So, lets start from the beginning. We came in on a Wednesday and it was PACKED. But that's not saying much since  a. it's a popular place and  b. it's TINY, seriously. I am 4'11.5 (yes the .5 makes a significant difference) and I felt squashed.  Word of advice: Bring a very thin jacket, because there's no room to put it anywhere besides right between you and the person at the next table who is only a foot away.  Also, the lighting was very dark, which I am not a fan of. It also did not let properly judge the decor, which seemed standard trendy.  Important fact: I am vegetarian i.e. finding a place where I can eat everything already makes my heart leap. And to find a place where the food is not made of grass and flavor-less tofu is unimaginable. This place is a like the lost city of Atlantis to me. Alright, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get where I am going.  Mana is a tapas restaurant, which is great for me because I love variety and usually can't eat too much. However, boys be warned. Portions are small (thought you can get a bigger portion) and expensive. You might want a pre-meal this.  NOW, let's talk FOOD!  BAKED GOAT CHEESE served warm with spicy tomato sauce and toasts: Mmm, good. Not enough bread for the amount of goat cheese they give you and you can ask for more ONCE before they charge you. We asked twice and we got charged :(  MANA CHILI corn, black beans, chickpeas, green onions and white cheddar: good, but wasn't anything unique MANA SLIDER - brown rice and mushroom burger with spicy mayo: you HAVE to try this. So yummy and so simple! It is definitely not a manwich type sandwich and you will be craving more after eating this tiny little thing.   RAVIOLI tomato pasta filled with pumkin in a sage cream sauce: I definitely licked the plate clean. I could drink the sage cream sauce! Gross, but true. The pumpkin ravioli and sage pairing was perfect. BUT, there were only 3 raviolis!! for 7.75!! Man oh mana. How you tease me.

Very convenient for getting a sense of the menu. The food was great, for those thinking a vegetarian place will be light on the stomach, this food is very rich, so arrive hungry. The best items our table had were the mushroom polenta and the pierogies, though the goat cheese tart was excellent as well. They have some interesting beers and the drink menu in general is pretty well assembled. The only flaw was that they overdressed their salads and cold dishes: dressings should enhance not overpower. Other than that it was great, and I'd gladly return. Ambiance - Really small - I understand the desire for coziness but why not expand when there are people literally waiting outside to eat. I understand creating an exclusive-high demand vibe, but there's money to be had no? Inside it's kind of minimalist chic trendy, with dubstep that's a smidgen too loud.

We also had the rice noodles and pot stickers.  Both were yummy--pot stickers were sort of what you'd expect (you know, all pot stickery and stuff, how else do you DO a pot sticker?), and the rice noodles were perfect for a really bitter cold Chicago night.  The small was right on with the appetizers, I don't know if I could have finished a large. Did I mention the blue cheese tart?  Minus one star because they have not yet upgraded it from ""tart"" to ""pie"" or ""cake"" or even ""AIDS quilt-sized."" Or maybe the minus one star is because I was facing a drugstore Goth couple all through the meal (you know, the type of people who scoff at Hot Topic like the joke that it is, then buy all their black nail polish and shit at Walgreens and try to act like that means they're being all casual-Goth, or fashion-Goth, or maybe not-Goth, when really they're being the lamest and truest form of Goth there is?).  The couple, seated at the bar, just could not keep their silver dragon-ringed fingers off each other, apparently each needed the other to help with the eating of the tiny foods on small plates.  ""Delirium!  I must massage thy throat to help the shiitake mushroom make its final descent to thine entrails!""*  Maybe the minus one star is because the waitress didn't step in and put an end to the heavy dinner petting by saying ""Look, you guys are making everyone puke their food back up and the bowls here aren't big enough for that."" Perhaps, more accurately, the minus one star is because the tables are really, really, REALLY squished together, and for some reason, the people sitting at them seem to think they're on the El and leave their giant Chrome bags lying on the floor.  You're lucky to get a table, you're lucky if you can fit between the tables and find your footing to get across to the seat on the other side, and if blue cheese turns your crank, you'll be lucky to fit through on your way out. *Thanks to Type O Negative for those lyrics about shiitake mushrooms.  That's from their food album, right?",0.3855,0.85,0.08,0.07,0.45381136950904377

Just to reiterate, you definitely wont walk out with a lingering hungry feeling after sharing a couple of plates. Cons: -Get there early on weekends.

2011-01-26,5.0,"Food:  5 Service:  4 Atmosphere:  5 Value:  4 Do not adjust your screens.  This is not a test.  Yes, that's right, my first 5-star review has arrived like mana from heaven.  Well, actually from a ""food bar,"" whatever that means.  My brother and sister-in-law (also kosher like me) were in town visiting so my wife and I couldn't think of a better time to make the trek out to Wicker Park (or Ukranian Village, or West Town, or whatever neighborhood it's actually in) and brave the wait at this trendy spot allegedly turning out some of the best vegetarian food in the city.   We arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday night and they told us the wait would be 45 minutes.  I was expecting at least an hour so I was pleased.  Sure enough, at 7:13, my wife's cell phone rang and our table was ready.  When I sat down to look at the menu, an odd, unfamiliar feeling came over me.  Something didn't feel right.  You know, that feeling that 99% of all you ""regular eaters"" have you have whenever you go to any restaurant.  I. could. order. anything. I. wanted.  Just for one night, I ceased being Neil ""No Substitutions"" G. and became Neil ""No Restrictions"" G.   After undertaking a complicated, quadratic formula-like ordering strategy, the four of us decided on the following:  Avocado, Arugula, and Tomato Salad, Beets Salad, Cauliflower, Curry, Mushroom Saute, Mana Sliders, Ravioli, Rice Noodles, Brussel Sprouts, and Collard Greens.  I won't go into detail about every dish, but rather, just hit the high points.  Low points, you say?  Um, no, there weren't any.  Sorry.  [Editor's Note:  If a dish is not mentioned, assume it was quite good, but not spectacular] The sliders are their most popular item and there's no reason why they shouldn't be.  The amount of creativity, love, and care that goes into this 3-bite masterpiece is mindboggling.  Imagine the fanciest veggie burger you've ever had (similar to DMK, see my review) sitting a top a soft, pillowy bun, perfectly accented with spicy mayo and homemade pickled cucumber slices.  Each bite was simply blissful. The mushroom saute was memorable because I wasn't expecting much from it.  Mushrooms and polenta.  Seems pretty straight forward, right?  Wrong.  There's nothing straight forward about the richest, creamiest, most velvety polenta I've ever had.  The mushrooms were not overdone and added a nice textural balance.  I have no idea what kind of sauce they were sauteed in, but it was delicious, just like every other component.  This was vegetarian comfort food at its best.   Conversely, I was expecting a lot from the ravioli, but it didn't let me down.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and didn't cave under the weight of the pumpkin filling.  The filling itself was smooth, creamy, and seasoned quite nicely.  Given that pumpkin is typically bitter I was happy to see them do it justice.  The sage butter sauce was like icing on the cake-sweet, rich, and decadent-with a hint of savory spices. Brussel sprouts seem to be the hot new side item at every restaurant, but I've never had sprouts like these.  Frankly, It was also nice to see some sprouts not deep fried in duck fat, braised with pork belly, or sauteed in bacon grease.  The sprouts were charred beautifully and the miso-mustard they were lightly tossed in was so good I tried to replicate it in my home kitchen.  The dish was sweet, spicy, savory, yet slightly earthy.  Simple, but still unique.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone with a live pulse, sense of taste, and a general desire for awesomeness.  You'll notice I gave it a 4 for value, as the bill came out to a mere $35/person including tax, tip, and a drink.  I hope Mana doesn't read this review because I would gladly pay a lot more for this heavenly dining experience.  Now go forth my loyal readers, and spread the gospel that is Mana Food Bar.  May you one day tell your children and grandchildren about the legendary tale of Neil G.'s first 5-star review.   [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]",0.9996,0.737,0.23,0.032,0.5920543007128373

We briefly considered the logistics.  Go to the grocery store, buy asparagus, go to my apartment, prepare it together, eat it, and then go back to his hotel.  Eh.  I had been wanting to go to mana food bar ever since I had sampled their mushroom sliders at the Design Fair, and I knew they had asparagus on the menu.  We decided to stop there on the way to his hotel at O'Hare after a couple hours of shopping. The food, unfortunately, was boring and overpriced.  The asparagus was fine - no complaints, but for about $67 for two people and no drinks, the dinner was a big yawn fest.  Bland bland bland.  After an assortment of different shared plates, including a mild bibimbap, a simple roasted asparagus, a blue cheese tart (which was so tiny I felt like laughing when they brought it out), and a mushroom sautee over polenta, one taste profile remained with me: lemon miso.  Yes, I get it - lemon miso is the theme of your restaurant.  Just rename the damn restaurant ""A Touch of Lemon Miso.""   The only thing that was really good to me were the mushroom sliders, which were quite filling and had the desired kick, derived solely from the mayo.  We asked for a couple of sides of brown rice to go, in case my dad got hungry at the hotel (we stopped at Jewel to get actual plain yogurt, because those are the two staples to make any simple indian man happy: brown rice and yogurt) and the rice was undercooked and slightly crunchy, even though the rice that came with our meal was cooked perfectly. The service was unfriendly and inattentive .  It took our server almost twenty minutes to remember to come and take our orders, despite the fact that we were the only ones in the restaurant when we first walked in.  They literally just stood a few feet away from us, at the bar, chatting up about something that happened at a party. Overall, the dishes ranged from excellent to just all right, with the dining experience as a whole being insipid and forgettable.  I'd recommend throwing in an extra $20 to $30 and going to Green Zebra - similar concept at several times the quality.",0.9833,0.837,0.106,0.057,0.46149825783972115

We had the pickles, 5 spice salad,baked goat cheese, and sliders as well as the Cucumber Sakerita. Everything was spectacular. The trouble is, we kept seeing a different server every time. We had no idea WHO our real server was. Also, when someone would come to the table to drop off a dish, some basic server etiquette was neglected. We were never asked: 'how is everything?' or 'may I get you anything else?' I had to flag someone down twice to get a new drink. We also dirtied our plates after our first small plate item, so we stacked them up to be taken. No one brought us new clean ones for our next item. We had to ask for them. To top it all off, we were asked if we wanted dessert and settled on something. We sat and waited and waited and waited until finally I had to say to a server, we have been waiting for our dessert for quite some time and would just like to leave now. Please bring us the check. The entire time we were sitting down, there were tables turning over, but I was amazed that even though people were leaving, it took the staff 10 minutes to clean the tables and seat the new folks who were waiting. It was like I was watching serious server chaos. They were not short staffed either. There was a bar tender, and 3 servers, a bus boy and a manager. It's not a big restaurant! As a veggie, I REALLY wanted to like this place but it will take me awhile to want to try it again. The service was that horrible.",0.8218,0.828,0.099,0.073,0.5182005237560793
2010-09-04,2.0,"This was one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've had in a while. We decided to get some dishes here because it has a 27 in Zagat, which is a score that usually means some very good things. But this hardly has earned its reviews. The first dish we had was the spinach ravioli in a red sauce with cheese. The ravioli didn't taste like much, but I am not at all exaggerating when I say that I found the combination of the acidity of the sauce and the sourness of the cheese tasted just like vomit.  The second dish was a vegetarian Bi Bim Bop. It tasted like Lean Cuisine Chinese food. Pretty crappy. I posit that anyone with a wok and 20 minutes to think about how spices work can do better. Third was the Mushroom Saute, which another reviewer described as ""melt in your mouth delicious."" It's not. The mushrooms are sour due to poor seasoning choices, leaving a reminder of rot in the mouth. The polenta over which the mushrooms are served was quite good on its own, though it had more fat in it than the entirety of Wisonsin. My dining companion repeated the phrase ""cheese butter wow"" a few times. And finally, there was the Latka. They tried to dress it up, and admittedly it was one of the better latkas I've had, but the Mana ""Sweet Potato Pancake"" is something that every Jewish person on earth has had but better.  The drinks were fine. The food wasn't vomit-inducing (after the first course), but it's definitely not good. I would never recommend that anyone go there.",0.9761,0.79,0.142,0.068,0.4721111111111111

It's a tiny, streamlined place with small tables and friendly/helpful staff.  We had pleasant and attentive service. Probably my favorite thing about this place is that you can order large entree sized portions OR tiny tapas style dishes.  I like the latter so I can try more! I ordered 2 sliders because I was told I had to.  They had a good smokey flavor, and GREAT texture, but were pretty mild in general.  The bun was surprisingly soft and sweet,and buns are something I would usually forgo in a review. I also got the 5 spiced tofu (small sized) which was cold and fresh and tasy with ripe tomatoes and basil and cucumber.  Don't order it if you don't enjoy the natural taste of tofu, though.  The dressing is light and accents the natural flavors and doesn't smother them. I shared the avocado salad as an appetizer with my boyfriend.  I would definitely order my own next time because it was delicious and tiny.  Lots of pepper and creamy avocado chunks! My boyfriend ordered the spinach ravioli.  It was ok--tasty but not at all special.  I'm not really sure why he ordered that anyway...

Well, I certainly know I'm not - my oft and greedy consumption of all things animal clearly point to the other end of the food chain spectrum - but if all veggie options were as phenom as those at Mana, I think maybe I could be!  Absolutely loved my weekend lunch here filled with all kinds of good-for-you, fresh, wholesome delights that were positively perfect for a blisteringly hot summer day. Keepin' it light made me feel shiny and bright, and to be honest, I wasn't the least bit thwarted by my protein hiatus because everything was downright tasty, flavorful and nomnomnommy. Starting off with a peach, oatmeal and almond milk smoothie was definitely the optimal kick off to my vegtastic indulgence... it was refreshing, heavenly and spot on sweet without over doing it. Opt for one of these or a 'just squeezed' concoction from Mana's juice bar, it's the tastiest way to get your fill of fabulous fruit for the day.  You've probably already heard about the magnificent brown rice and mushroom Mana Sliders, but what you didn't know is they've unequivocally received the seal of burger approval from this Iron (non deficient) Maiden. Adored every square inch of their smoky, savory, slightly chipotle spicy fabulousness and my-oh-my, that bread! Looks like the pretzel bun just got usurped. This soft, airy, carby delight truly made my lunch first class. Not to be overlooked, however, are the salads and noteworthy cold items; wonderful for cooling down my hot engines was the 3-item sampler trio that allowed me to try the almond and currant packed red quinoa with tangerine dressing, a pleasant spinach and pear salad with walnuts and the amazingly piquant jicama, mango and cucumber salad with cilantro and chili lime salt. Wonderful, seasonal, beauteous.  A really enjoyable overall experience with my only small star retraction coming from really dragging slow service that on any day other than a lazy Saturday just would not fly. Slowing down is OK, slowing down my animal protein consumption is even better. Mana, you're marvelous, even minus the meat!",0.9991,0.697,0.287,0.017,0.6119576719576718

We definitely ordered too much but missed out on a ton of things we wanted to try. Sweet Potato Pancakes and the Sliders are what the waitress suggested we keep on our order, as they are known for those dishes. The pancakes were a good finisher, sweet and salty. The sliders were UNbelievable. I have never tasted anything like them, other reviewers called them flavorless but I thought they were very interesting and complex. The three-salad sampler was good to sample these dishes so that later we could pick one. Otherwise the portions are so small, I'd rather just have one.  For this visit it was perfect. The asparagus was the only dish that didn't blow my mind. It was just asparagus. Maybe I was just too full by the time that got to the table. Cocktails were clean tasting, fresh, and creative (I had the cucumber,  my mother had two of the ginger/pineapple). They are sake-based, and we sort of wished they were made with harder stuff.

Upon finding yourself at this quaint Division St. location, you are happily greeted by a bright and cheerful front of the house staff.  The sultry atmosphere of Mana Food Bar is delightfully elegant; maintaining the sophisticated elegance of European night-life with the upscale couture of American cuisine.  Exposed Brick, Dark Wood table-tops, and perfect lighting make it wonderful it sit, inside OR out.  The outdoor patio is perfect for larger groups or just yourself, as you can sit and watch life roll by on lively Division St. The menus are neat, creative and cool.  Delicious cocktail and fruit juice concoctions are sure to please.  Sake and Coconut Water cocktails, fresh pineapple juice, these are only a few of the wonderful options which delight the palate and quench the eyes. I thoroughly recommend going with a few others so you can make the most out of the menu.  Everything is very affordable and extremely tasty.  It's very clear that the chef has carefully created every meal with the freshest, organic ingredients--leaving no mistake for intrusive flavors, as every bite is sensational and allows all the flavors to blend delicately in your mouth. The Spinach and Pear Salad, the Five Spice Tofu Salad, Bulgogi, Gyoza, Ravioli, and the Bleu Cheese Tart are some of the most wonderful things I could ever eat.  I make it a point to eat here first before going out of town, because Mana would certainly make a masterful last meal if God-forbid something happened. If the menu is overwhelming, feel free to ask anyone around you for their input.  All of the staff is wonderfully helpful and polite, and the customers around you probably have wonderful insight as they are probably there for their 3rd or 4th time.  Make sure to leave room for dessert, because the Lavender Creme Broulee is out of this world.

Just west of Alliance Bakery, you'll find this little food haven ... the menu is rather broad, which is pleasing to all taste buds. With food creations prepared with love and real interest in their consumer's pleasure, you'll find that every item has it's own pizzaz of appeal.  If I may, and I will, suggest my favorite choices - 1) Pot Stickers AKA Gyoza 2) Baked Bree 3) Pear Salad 4) Sliders !!!!!!!!!!! These four items tend to be on my regular order. Don't forget to ask your always friendly and knowledgeable  server what the specials of the day are, as they tend to be out of this world. ( Fiddle Head Fern Special = BREATH TAKING!!!!!! )  So if your afraid by the title , vegan , stop being so wound up, and give Mana a try.

Desserts are always worth trying, as are the fresh squeezed juices (the apple juice? just like biting into an apple!)  I have to admit that we haven't been super impressed with many of the appetizer-type items- the pickled plate was a let down for the pickle-obsessed bf, and a lot of the stuff are things you could get elsewhere (spinach and pear salad? make it at home and save room for another slider!)

Other reviewers have compared it to Green Zebra (favorably or unfavorably) and I will too: simpler, more affordable, not-quite-as-amazing but still really excellent. We got there a little before 6 on a Friday night and so had no trouble being seated right away. Obviously, the space is tiny and they'll be a wait at any popular time. The space is decked out in serene grays and interesting, stylized, chunky wood fixtures. The ambiance was great, except the lighting was pretty dim for so early in the evening. Service was friendly and professional, a great balance between caring about our food and experience and not intruding on our dinner. We split a selection of cold and hot dishes (how I love small plates). Also helpful that you can choose a small or large portion for the plates. Cold: the 3-dishes sample platter of 5 spice tofu, red quinoa, and pickled veggies (pearl onions, daikon, okra). The red quinoa was the best of the bunch, hearty but balanced lightly with citrus and mint. The sour pickles made a great contrast and the tofu was delicious, if not life-changing. Hot: The mushroom saute over polenta. Co-sign all the rave reviews already mentioned. I don't like mushrooms but I ate plenty of this dish. A variety of perfectly cooked meaty, saucy mushrooms over creamy polenta with just a little kick of sharp cheese. We also tried the day's special of aspargus and fiddlehead ferns in Chinese black bean sauce over brown rice. The asparagus was lovely (the small ones are perfectly in season at the moment) as were the fiddleheads. The only trouble in this dish was the black bean sauce, which was more soy-sauce salty than fermented-black bean earthy/sour. It was still wonderful. We finished with a peach oatmeal smoothie and a banana chocolate smoothie for dessert, which were refreshing and tasty. A total bill of $50 for the two of us was a good value for the yumminess and quantity of food and the enjoyable atmosphere.",0.9986,0.717,0.251,0.033,0.5744159928122193

I was with a party of three and we were asked to sit at the bar; soon after a four-person booth opened up and before we could get to it they seated a couple there instead.

2010-04-25,2.0,"THE FOOD:  I have been to Green Zebra three times and must say that 70% of they're food is spot on delicious, the other 30% is decent.  That being said, of the eight different dishes we had last night from Mana, ALL of them were comparable to Green Zebra's 30% (in style, presentation, and taste) but cost about the same, with the exception of the creamy Polenta (think creamy, garlic, butter mash potatoes with polenta in lieu of spuds) which was a modest two dollars.  Side note to the patron who greeted us at the door who said "" This is the best vegetarian restaurant in the City "",  you either have no taste buds or have never been to another vegetarian restaurant. THE SPACE:  Think Matchbox converted to a restaurant, but with a few tables jammed in.  If you are mildly claustrophobic do not attempt this place unless the outdoor seating is available.  Mana takes a minimalistic approach when it comes to it's space.  The lights are kept low and the walls and ceiling are painted with up to three tones of green.  If you go alone, unless you request another spot, chances are you will be seated at the bar facing an empty painted brick wall. The place seems very unrefined.  I swore it must have recently opened, but to my surprise it's coming up on it's second anniversary.  THE SERVICE:  I'm not sure if the area is so overpopulated with arrogant, pompous, self serving people to the point that, in the short time Mana has been there, the waitstaff has just been beaten down or if it is Mana's intention to have robots waiting on you.  There was absolutely nothing personable in the service.  There was no exchange of information beyond what we wanted and were we finished and I am not exaggerating this point.  Don't get me wrong, the food came up on a reasonable time, the plates were bussed quickly and the water was refilled almost instantly and I commend the staff for this, but the degree to which I felt served by robots (and I am referring to the entire staff on the floor) leaves me to begin and end this portion of my review on this note. CONCLUSION:  I usually give a restaurant three attempts before I review or even make a decision about going back again, but this time once will suffice.  BTW, I have sheets of skin hanging from the roof of my mouth today after being burned by the Blue Cheese Tart.   There was no warning that it was hot at all and I couldn't sense it through the crust as I picked it up in my hands.  If I had functioning pain receptors in the roof of my mouth I'd probably be suing.",-0.9114,0.874,0.05,0.076,0.45462962962962966

The polenta was out of this world; smooth, yummy with a hint of cheese. The mushrooms were sauteed and flavorful, full bodied and meaty in the most non meaty way. It was the right call. It was very filling, which is what I look for when I am not eating meat. My boyfriend got the quesadilla special, also with mushrooms, which was also good and pretty spicy as well. Yay mushrooms and yay spicy food! We also got two sliders, which were the perfect combination and so very, very, very good. Didn't make me miss white castle one bit! For dessert, we got the cheesecake and the creme brulee. The creme brulee could have been cooked a little longer (too puddingy, not custardy enough) but the cheesecake was good. Overall, they both had really good flavors, so you can't hate on that! We went pretty earlier, like we were over 65 (6pm) and we had no wait but then again. It was early.

2010-03-01,3.0,"I'm torn about whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars (as you can see, I decided to go with 3, and I'll explain why, of course).  The food here is delicious. There's really no other way to put it. The tomato pumpkin ravioli with sage cream sauce was practically a religious experience. I also had spanakopita with a side of red cabbage slaw, and both of these were wonderful as well. One of my friends had the Mana chili and that, too, was unbelievable.  The reasons this place loses points, at least from my perspective, are as follows: 1. The restaurant itself is TINY. This means long waits and an overall cramped and crowded dining experience. 2. It's expensive. The food is served tapas-style, and that is both an asset and a liability in my opinion. I went with four friends, and we all had two small dishes each (which were, as I mentioned, absolutely amazing). It was fun to mix and match, try each other's choices, etc. But a mere three hours later, we were all hungry again.  This place is absolutely worth a try.

2010-02-18,5.0,"I was really impressed by Mana!      I needed a place to meet a girlfriend who was visiting home from South Korea, hadn't seen her in over a year. Did some Yelp-searching and stumbled upon this place. It looked great, menu looked even better, and it was within short biking distance from Logan Sq. Sold.      It was this past Monday. I think I got there at around 5:30. We were one of two parties in the place, but that didn't last long. It filled up over the next hour, but I never noticed a wait for tables, and there seemed to always be at least a few seats open at the bar. I start with these facts because I NEED to give thanks to our waiter who was SO patient with us! We must've been there for three hours, mostly talking and not so much ordering, but he was still attentive and checked back often without showing disdain(I am a server and I realize this is a pain in the ars, taking up valuable real estate when the place could easily fill up)  So...sorry, and thank you!      We (finally) started with the baked goat cheese. Leah informed me its hard to come by in Korea and she'd been dreaming about it, so our meal probably wouldn't have started any other way. It was fantastic! The spicy tomato sauce was perfect and as promised by another reviewer, our toast was quickly replenished for us.      I then ordered the mushroom sautee with polenta. Let me say, I am obsessed with mushrooms and these did nothing to disappoint! The sauce was awesome. I'd never had polenta prepared that soft before, but it went wonderfully with the meatier texture of the mushrooms.      Leah ordered the tomato pumpkin ravioli which i tried a bite of, of course, and I immediately had order-envy. The sage in the cream sauce makes it. Tastes like Christmas, and Christmas tastes great!      We were both drinking the Two Brothers' french country ale, which was also fantastic. Great body, not too sweet, not too boozy. MUST find this beer for home!      I really appreciated the spartan nature of the decor/furnishings. Its devoid of wall-decor for the most part, but the wood really plays a part in warming the place up. Definitely not so bare that it becomes some kind of pretentious arty void. It really enables you to focus your attention on your experience: your company and your taste buds. I might not have painted the bricks behind the bar, but thats just me. I love love love that they provide you with a large glass bottle of water. Perhaps this is my server-side talking, because constantly refilling water glasses can get tedious, especially if you're busy. But also, as a customer, its nice to refill at your own leisure. The fact that it was a GLASS bottle and not a plastic pitcher really did something for me too.      I will absolutely be returning to Mana, hopefully sooner rather than later.

I wish that I could afford to eat there as often.  There is nothing better than a couple Sakeritas and the squash salad (seasonal and not there right now).  After a few sakeritas a pear nectar sake cocktail or the ginger pineapple cocktail is also delicious.  I am not a rich person or a drunk, but I am definitely worth the flavor adventure of a few of their cocktails.  I would actually rather get another drink and leave hungry if I had to choose because its always nice to fit in a glass of wine as well- they have a great selection. As the bar is my favorite place, I am always pleased to see John working back there (I haven't been there since fall....hope he's still there) because he gives the best menu advice and service- i ate there my first week in the neighborhood and he was kind enough to go through all of the ins and outs of the local businesses.   As for the food, on the current menu must haves are the creamy polenta with mushroom saute, beets, mana sliders, and ravioli.  I'm not a huge fan of the blue cheese tart as it is a bit extreme on flavor- especially if you eat that towards the end of the meal- it doesn't settle well if you are full.  I just can't wait until the squash is back on the menu........  I prefer to eat there in summer- the restaurant is so cramped so its nice to get a table in the outdoor section.  The bar is nice, but if you have more than 2 people it just doesn't work.  I'll call in take out sometimes and that is also a nice option if you're not up for waiting.",0.995,0.785,0.183,0.032,0.5748079877112137

I would highly recommend the second choice because there is so much delicious food at Mana. My girlfriend and another friend went for dinner on a Thursday night. The place is very small, there are only 6 tables and about 8-10 seats at the bar. They do not take reservations. I walked in around 6:20 and there were three open tables. By 6:45 all of the tables were taken and there was a line beginning to form. They offer most items in either a small (tapas) or large quantities. We had the following items: Pickled: Three kinds of different homemade pickled vegetables. They serve this on a rotating basis and we had kim chee, asparagus and radishes. This was okay, I wasn't the biggest fan. Caponata: Chilled eggplant, tomato and caper relish with grilled bread. This was pretty amazing and the grilled bread is great. If you eat all the bread and still have caponata left, they will bring you more bread. Hummus: They offer you the choice of vegetables or grilled bread to eat with your hummus which was good. Asparagus: Grilled with spicy miso mustard and sesame roasted peppers. This was really good especially the spicy miso mustard which I wish I could buy and use at home. Bulogi: Seared tofu with soy shitake mushrooms. Really enjoyed this as well. Black Beans with garlic: Who would have thought that black beans and garlic with some other special spices could taste so good. Mana Slider: Brown rice and mushroom burger with spicy mayo. Ok this was a little bit of vegetarian heaven in my mouth. You may be tempted to order more but then you will miss out on all the other food.

The downside to Mana, for me, was the hostess. There are no reservations, you sign in when you arrive. We signed in, and many people came and were seated before we were. We had been waiting for upwards of 30 minutes and a couple came in and she seated them, while we were still waiting. They waited less than 5 minutes as she converted a 4-top table to two 2-top tables.

It's not too filling and leaves you feeling warm inside. Now the sliders. What can I say? Get two..at least.

We got a table right away on a Friday night, but that may be due to raging snowstorm outside. We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender who was just awesome, really friendly and genuine. Go for the brown rice and mushroom sliders, goat cheese dip and peanut noodles (ask for them warm). Skip the eggplant unless you're into babyfood (although the soy glaze is delicious). Also recommend the ginger cocktail.",0.8621,0.829,0.116,0.055,0.5592261904761905

Until, of course, I discovered that fish = crazy delicious, and denying myself hamburgers all my life = crazy wrong.  That being said, I can still appreciate some tasty-ass all veggie meals on occasion and this place DELIVERS! Lemme break it down:  Mana sliders: YES, PLEASE!! Really satisfying patty made of brown rice and mushrooms. A soft bun and chipotle sauce finished it all perfectly!  Sesame Noodles: Thin, wheat, noodles w/ a rich peanut sauce and diced carrots, celery, and green beans. Really nice dish to share.  Sweet Potato Pancake: AWESOME!! Like a latke w/ apple sauce and caramelized onions and thick luscious sour cream.  Three salad sampler: Red quinoa (good, but not blowing anyone away); spinach and pear (wonderful dressing), and seaweed salad (fresh + tasty).  Tomato Pumpkin Ravioli: only real disappoint. Just not that tasty, except for the cream sauce (which I usually don't like).  If this was all we ordered (btwn the three of us), our bill would have been about $20 a piece, including the tip; perfectly reasonable for the amount of food, I think.

I have a confession to make!  I am not vegan or veggie eater - I love my steak, but this place definitely has me wavering between letting go of my love for steak and becoming a veggie-eater forever!!  O____O True story!  If all vegetarian and vegan eateries were just like Mana Food Bar, there will no longer be a day where an animal will have to be sacrificed!!!  We ordered a lot of food between the two of us and it was plate-lickin' clean yumminess!!  From our sampler of their cold dishes including the amazing pear and spinach salad, cucumber seaweed, and even their red quinoa! WOW!  With a great beginning like that, our excitement for our main course could not be contained!   Before our main course, we were going order two glasses of wine with our meal - but their interesting sake cocktail list changed our mind.  My friend had the coconut water and fresh lime and I had the pear nectar with nigori sake!  Thumbs up - hands down! Yum!   Seriously, 5 stars goes to their rice noodle!  Rice noodle sounds pretty boring, but not with it in a Thai coconut milk broth with butternut squash, pressed tofu, basil, mint and green onion!!!!  I can not even describe the sensation of how great this dish was - but as to further evident my love for this dish - we had a larger order of it togo so that we can savor its yummy again the next morning in our hotel!  I also recommend EVERYTHING that we had including: the mana slider (instead of a beef patty, it was brown rice mixed with mushroom and greatness! mMmMm), bi bim bo (my least favorite dish, but still yum!), and the creamy polenta (mMmmMm).  With such a great beginning, we could not have resisted a happy ending to end our meal.  Their melt-in-your-mouth lemon tart with a soft crust and strawberry goodness was WOW!!  Mana Food Bar is definitely bookmarked as a place for me revisit with their amazingly cute trendy modern ambiance, awesome service, and food that will make you wonder why you ever ate meat products - THUMBS UP!!!",0.9987,0.704,0.257,0.039,0.6159544159544159

Regardless of the season though the food and cocktails are wonderful. I actually dislike pretty much all cocktails but their sake cocktails are amazing!!!. I especially like the watermelon one as long as they do not forget that little chunk of fresh melon.  The food is also great. I love their eggplant with miso. Usually egg plant dishes can be bitter and dry or too greasy and stringy when you bite them. This was the best egg plant I have ever had. It was very tender with a nice char. The mana sliders are of course wonderful. I would never eat a burger again if i could get this recipe. I also enjoyed that little cabbage Asian salad.  The sweet potato pancake and also the squash salad with pesto are great. The chick pea salad is also something I crave and have tried to make at home.  The only thing that I have ever had there which was really just bad was their tofu and mushroom dish.

2009-10-25,5.0,"My husband and I are very midwestern vegetarians - we love the lifestyle, love not eating animals... but we're no so keen on rabbit food. In fact, a vegan blogger (The Urban Housewife) who stayed with us once dubbed us the fake meat king and queen. I know it's creepy, but I like to eat and demand to feel full and satisfied when I'm done. I simply don't have the kind of pallet or appetite that allows me to eat a bunch of vegetables and feel happy. It's been 10 years for me, 20 for my husband...we'd come to accept our position on the fake meat throne. Until Mana.  We first had a taste of Mana at the Renegade Craft Fair - a couple of mushroom sliders in the sea of stuffed owl dolls and ironic unicorn t-shirts. I wanted 5 more.  A few weeks later we stopped in and once we got past feeling like a couple of bulls in a China shop (it's quite small!) we were shocked and amazed to not only be presented with dish after dish of flavorful, satisfying veggie dishes, but to be full and happy 100% fake meat-free.  Harlan did a gorgeous job with the interior (leading us to question whether or not there is ANYTHING he isn't good at) and the service was awesome.

I thought I was in heaven when I ate this at Cafe Baba Reeba, but this trumps their dish hands down. Also like everyone has said, their sliders are very good. Second time I went, I ordered 2, then had to ask the waitress back to order another one. This easily one of the most unique and best tasting restaurants I've been to in Chicago.

2009-10-09,5.0,"I swear I'm not one of those yelpers who believes every restaurant deserves 4 or 5 stars, even though my previous reviews could prove to you otherwise. But for all of these places, ESPECIALLY (yes, all caps) Mana Food Bar, all 5 stars were rightly earned. First of all, upon walking into Mana I immediately felt like I had stepped into a fabulous yet somehow low key restaurant in Manhattan. The vibes that emanate through Mana are very hip but albeit not at all pretentious. Anyhow, after a long day at work and a horrific commute to the city, I met my sister in this cozy space, sitting at the bar sipping her Pineapple and Ginger Sake. Once we moved to our booth for dinner, I ordered the freshly squeezed pineapple juice and it was quite simply, amazing.  I'm a firm believer in trying many new things - and last year a huge commitment that I made was to become a vegetarian. And I'm not talking a pescatarian with the occasional fish dinner here there, no, I'm talking the no dairy, no meat, seriously hardcore vegetarian. I should also say that this lasted all of 6 months, but hey! Had I lived in the city and with people who fully supported my choice not to eat meat, it would've definitely lasted.  What I absolutely enjoyed about this place was the option to order ""small"" or ""large"" dishes - we'd ordered 4 small dishes between us, Baked Goat Cheese, Lasagna, Sweet Potato Pancakes (aka the best thing you'll ever put in your mouth ever and this is a promise!), and brown rice and beans. The first dish to come out was the Baked Goat Cheese - the cheese itself sat on top of a warm layer of tomato sauce, kind of like marinara but not as thick. The toast that accompanies the goat cheese is comparable to the concept that peanut butter and jelly are a match made in food heaven.  The second dish to be served was the....oh God, wait for it...the Sweet Potato Pancakes. Sweet Potato Pancakes. Sweet Potato Pancakes. Sorry no, we didn't order 3 of them, I got a little sidetracked reminiscing about this dish. I'd had sweet potato pancakes before but never like this, there's truly a marriage of something spectacular in the works here and you really do have to try it yourself because there are no words. The lasagna was meaty in a literal-not-real-meat kind of way, it was comprised of generous heaps of eggplant and other vegetables, the top layer of mozzarella was absolutely divine. Our side of beans and brown rice didn't really compliment anything else we ordered but in a way it was a side that absolutely held its own that one needn't order anything to accompany it specifically.  The waitress who served us was very gracious, refilling our bottle of water if it so much as reached half way. And oh my goodness the water here is actually really tasty. I forgot to ask the waitress what kind of water it is...and I swear I'm not one of those crazies who can differentiate between tap and spring water, but my sister mentioned she read a review about the water just tasting phenomenal and I wholeheartedly agree. Anyhow, the water at each table is in a clear bottle with no label and no cap, I'm not sure why this was exciting but damnit, it was. In summation, our dining experience at Mana was unforgettable, we left feeling beyond satisfactorily sated, and not in a greasy-food-I-can't-breathe kind of way, but in a pleasant-I-still-have-room-for-an-espresso kind of way. Mana Food Bar is a restaurant that allows the most religious of meat eaters to realize and appreciate that food can be just as hearty, complex and rich in texture and flavor without having any meat on the menu.",0.9981,0.766,0.173,0.061,0.5636270715816168

I did notice it was a bit warm in there, but since the place is about the size of my studio apartment I can see why. Here is what we had (in order of presentation): Drinks: I ordered the Sakerita by reccomendation by our waitress. It was phenomneal. The combination of cucumber and sake was so refreshing. I can see downing several of these on a hot day on their outdoor patio. My boyfriend had the pineapple ginger which was also equally as delicious. we both had two. Appetizer: Small Camponata. A combination of eggplant and tomatoes it was served with grilled bread. It was very light and a great starter. First Course: Small Vegetable Curry. Califlour and peas with a curry sauce served over brown rice. The sauce was amazing and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. I never thought when I was a kid that I would willingly order something with cauliflour AND peas. And would want to eat it again. Second Course: Small Mushroom Lasagna. The tomato sauce tasted and so fresh and they served it with fresh basil. Anything with fresh basil gets extra points with me. This was our favorite until the next dish served... Grand Finale: Mana Sliders. There were the best part of the meal. They seemed so simple from reading the description on the menu, but the flavor and texture blew me away. I have never had a veggie based sandwich this good. Actually this is one of the best sandwiches I have had. Its is served with a spicy creamy sauce which adds a nice kick. We ordered it with the cabbage salad on the side and I put a little on the burger. It added a nice crunch to the already delectable dish. I highly reccomend this. My boyfriend ordered some sorbet, but I was so full that i just had a bite. One of the flavors was avocado coconut and the other plum. Both were good but the avocado coconut was our favorite of the two for the simple fact that you don't have avocado for dessert every day.

Maybe they were under staffed that night?  Even when she was at our table it was always brief and she seemed to be in a real hurry to get to her other tables!  The food was pretty good, I would probably give it 4 stars, portions weren't bad either.  Three of us shared three small sizes for appetizers, then each had a large size for entree.  They forgot to bring us one of our appetizers and then charged us for it, and again we couldn't get a hold of the waitress for 5 min after we received the bill and realized the mistake!

The artichoke ravioli had a sauce that was so good I could have drank out of a cup by itself. The only issue there was that the sauce was so strong it overpowered any taste of artichoke. The blue cheese tart was also delicious, but keep in mind these are pretty decent sized and very rich. We could have split one and it would have been plenty. Our final dish was the sliders.

2009-07-06,5.0,"Mana is a very small restaurant on Division Street that one can walk by and not even know it's there. After hearing that the interior looked a bit like Avec, J. suggested that we go there for my birthday. Needless to say, it was a good choice! I was glad that it was nice 'n' warm outside, because: 1. it was finally nice to be able to sit outside, and  2. because the patio has more seating than the inside.     We tried several dishes, including the mushroom saute, spanikopita, the Mana sliders and the spicy noodles (my favorite). As each dish came out, we were waiting to see which one would ultimately be the bad one. However, after nine dishes, 2 bellies completely full, and each dishes licked clean, it's safe to say that the ""bad"" dish never came. Equally as tasty are the drinks. We both had the chai plum and nigori sake, cucumber sakerita and the pineapple and fresh ginger. Not to take away from the food, but the drinks were at the same caliber.   Another point that I should make is that I am quite the carnivorous eater, and prefer a nice cut of meat with my veggies. However, Mana is a vegan restaurant, which I thought might pose a problem when J chose to go there. The funny thing is, while ordering, eating and digesting of the food happened, it didn't cross my mind once that there was no meat of any kind! Therefore, if you are like me and typically need more than just veggies on a plate, this place is as good as it gets for even meat eaters with taste buds! If you go here, I recommend trying many different small dishes (as a lot of them come in both ""small"" and ""large"" sizes) and the sakerita; you won't be disappointed! The only downside I could see is the seating, especially in the colder months. Mana has maybe 5-7 tables/booths inside, plus limited bar seating. However, after checking out the inside, it looks dark, elegant and minimal. Plus, the limited seating could mean a quiet and a romantic setting for two...if you can grab 2 seats that is!

2009-07-01,5.0,"Suck it Gordon Ramsay!!  The night before Veggie Supper Club I was watching Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, which was featuring a vegetarian restaurant in Paris. Usually, I'm a fan of Gordon and his foul-mouthed, tough love approach to restaurants, but Gordon's comments about vegetarians made me want to reach through my TV and bitch slap him.  Why? He has some of the following things to say about vegetarian food:  *I know their [vegetarians] food is bland in general  *Unfortunately it's a f-ing vegetarian restaurant  *Boring, bland vegetarian food  I know our last few supper clubs have for the most part been misses, but to label vegetarian food generally boring and bland is just ignorant! Gordon needs to get his butt over to Mana because my meal there was anything, but boring and bland! Ok, end rant and on to my dining experience. I like that many of Mana's dishes come in two sizes: small and large. It allows you to try multiple dishes or share things family-style. Being a painfully picky eater I scoped out the menu ahead of time and made some mental notes about things I wanted to try. I ended up ordering the Artichoke Ravioli and Bleu Cheese Tart. Both of my dishes were amazing! The sauce on the ravioli was creamy, tomato-y and had some zing to it. The tart was deliciously creamy and the caramelized onions and slaw on the side complimented it nicely.  I was also lucky enough to try some of my fellow diners dishes too. The squash salad, rice noodles, veggie chili, and baked goat cheese were all amazing. I also tried a sip of one of their sake drinks, the coconut water and lime sake drink; it was the only thing I tried that I found bland and disappointing. The place itself is neat, but tiny. We were fortunate enough to snag a seat on the patio. I think the patio may seat more people than the inside portion of the restaurant - like I said it's tiny. The inside has a bar and a few tables, it is NOT ideal for groups of more than 4. I have to imagine the place seems kind of like a cave in winter since the walls are painted a dark slate.

And then I realized.  The fireworks were inside my head.  It was just Mana blowing my mind. After six months of Veggie Supper Club, I might have been a bit jaded (especially after the last two month's hype fail).  But Mana, despite what you may have heard, is actually better than advertised.  From the first side (a very large, almost meal sized, bowl of polenta for $2) to the last main I finished (amazingly yummy goat cheese) to the veggie chili, every meal was made with care, full of flavor, and finely presented. In presentory fact, Mana might seem fancy at first with its large selection of cocktails and dimly lit back room, but it's actually quite friendly.  When I tried to order more toast points for my goat cheese, the server actually downclassed me (a feat that's hard to do) and said, ""toast."" I want to go back a bunch of times and try everything on the menu at least once (which with very large small sizes at less than $10 - that the restaurant has no problem with people sharing family style - is actually possible). In fact, I'm creating a new holiday and thinking about going back today.  I declare today International Mana Day.  Sorry Canada, but I just like Mana better.  And apparently Mana Food Bar comes with its own fireworks built in.",0.9645,0.865,0.101,0.035,0.3984767316017316

The quinoa was great, the pineapple salad thingie was okay, and the walnut lettuce salad had an amazing mustard vin.  The only disappointing dish was the ravioli...it tasted like something I make at home.  OH, the curry dish was great as well.  I had a tasty torrontes and my gf a crisp sav blanc.  We had about 7 dishes plus 3 glasses of wine (total) and the bill came out to $80.  Did I mention we were too stuffed for dinner?  So, yes, its affordable, healthy, and yummy.  Okay fine, a little pricey for lunch but like I said, we ordered like we hadn't eaten in days!  I kinda think of it as Green Zebra's little sister...not as high end or thought out but still delicious.

Mana certainly proves that idea wrong.  I am always on the hunt for vegetarian food that offers more than just a plate full of vegetables stir fried or five different types of cheese between two slices of bread.  With so many different types of vegetables to choose from it is a shame that restaurants don't offer more variety. But Mana has brought something interesting to the table. Each plate offered such amazing flavor that I made sure that I ate slowly to savor each and every bite.  They offer a wonderfully creative assortment of choices it took me some time to decide which ones to choose. In the end, I don't think I could have gone wrong with anything on the menu. I had the salad special which was tomato and artichoke hearts, followed by sweet potato pancakes and the blue cheese tart.  I appreciate the small plate sizes (or larger servings if your want) because they were perfect for sharing. I definitely left satisfied.   Accolades go to the hostess and wait staff.  We waited almost 40 minutes for our table after being told it would be a 20 minute wait.  We didn't care, the food was worth the wait, but the hostess did care that her time estimate was off.

2009-03-29,5.0,"One of my main beefs (ha!) with eating vegetarian is that most vegetarian food isn't very substantial. I'm not always in the mood for a plate of plain grilled vegetables, ya know? That's why I loved Mana so much. The entire menu is veggie, but everything is so flavorful and satisfying that even my adamantly carnivorous friend Joe G. seemed to enjoy it. If more restaurants offered this kind of food, so many more people would go veggie. (And I would be full of happiness rather than bloodlust.)  Between four of us, we tried 9 small plates. This was more than enough food. I honestly loved every single dish we ordered, and saw several more on the menu that sounded delicious.  The biggest winners, ranked in ascending order by deliciousness. 4. Bulgogi. This was the only fake meat item we tried. It's a perfectly prepared slab of tofu with soy mushrooms. I loved the flavor and texture of this. My fiancee expressed some concern that the saltiness would make him bloated. (He seems OK today).  3. Eggplant with miso sauce. It sounds so simple, but this was really well executed. The miso is a little bit sweet and really compliments the slightly tart eggplant. 2. Sweet potato pancake with cranberry chutney. To be fair, I've never had a potato pancake I didn't like, so I'm somewhat biased. But this was a good twist. It wasn't greasy like some, and the cranberry topping was a good compliment to the chives and sour cream. 1. Polenta with mushrooms. We all loved this so much that we ordered another plate in lieu of dessert!   Maybe the only one we wouldn't order again is the curry. It tasted good, but it wasn't really different from chana masala from any middle-of-the-road Indian buffet.  Mana also has a fun selection of cocktails. I was accidentally served a ""Sakerita"" when I thought I'd ordered ""sangria."" The mistake worked out well because the drink-- a lime and cucumber margarita made with sake-- was really tasty.  They also seem to have a good beer selection. Mana is tiny and doesn't take reservations, so get there early, or be prepared to wait at the bar with a drink for a while. The interior has an industrial-chic look to it.

First, I loved the space - very, very small and minimalist but since it was packed it had a fun, lively feel. Going with a huge group might be hard though. We sat at the bar which seemed fitting as this place isn't being gimmicky when they bill themselves as a food bar. The bar is used almost exclusively for ordering small plates - not really a place you'd sit just to order cocktails. We started with the goat cheese dish which was great but nothing special since goat cheese is everywhere these days. Next we had the Mana sliders (brown rice and mushroom burgers) which were out of this world! I don't know what made them so delicious but they were better than any gourmet kobe beef burger I have ever tried (Social House in Vegas giving them a run for their money though). I actually think the reason I loved this place so much was because of these amazing sliders! Next we had the mushroom saute which was a mushroom polenta dish. The polenta was great and although rich and creamy it didn't feel heavy. We also had the bi bim bop which I didn't like since it was really sweet and I was expecting it to be savory after our server said it was really spicy. Finally, we finished with the sweet potato pancakes which although great were a bit too sweet for my liking. The cranberry took away from the sweet potato flavor but if you like sweeter dishes then this would be perfect for you. I guess my sweet tooth is strictly reserved for dessert. And speaking of dessert...we had the chocolate cheesecake which was simple but good. All in all I had a great time and left extremely full.

It sounds like a decent amount of food, but we got the small portion of each. The bill came to around $30 before tip with two Diet Cokes. After tip it was like $130 because we're really bad at math.  Needless to say, my fat ass was hungry again like 45 minutes later, and I negated any healthy choices I made at Mana by eating dinner at Tecalitlan. Still, Mana is kind of foodie (remember when I said I had avocado in my sorbet?), so it's definitely worth putting down your gyros for a light meal at Mana, especially if you're going heavy on the sauce and you don't want to throw up gyros, which I think would be disgusting.

That said, I was excited to hear a new vegetarian restaurant had opened and even more excited after reading the excellent reviews. BF and I met a little over 7 years ago at good ol' Gold Star across the street, so it was amusing dining in our formerly dumpy former neighborhood. And onto the meal: We got there early, about 5:45 and were the only 2 other people in the place save for the staff and another couple. The space was cozy and I liked the wood. We started out with a beer for my fella and a ginger pineapple sake drink for me. Oh, was that delicious and refreshing. Not too sweet or cloying. I tried not to drink it as a shot and mostly succeeded.  Everything on the menu looked delicious, but based on recommendation, we split the pumpkin ravioli (INSANELY DELICIOUS!), then ordered a slider, a large spanokopita and the sweet potato pancakes. I wasn't sure what the portions would be like and inquired a little to our waiter. He seemed to think we might be fine, but might also order a little more later.  The slider was cute as a button and exponentially tastier! The sweet potato pancake was delicious, as was the bite of BF's spanokopita. Only problem was...BF was still totally hungry. I was fine with the portion sizes, but that spanokopita, for $8, was really, really tiny. Instead of ordering more, we decided to spend our money on sweet, sweet cheap booze at our old stomping grounds across the street...Gold Star. So, in short, the food was really delicious. Portions were a bit small (we ordered the small sizes, except the spanokopita, so maybe the large sizes would fare better on a hungrier day without breaking the bank). Drinks seemed about average priced. The ONLY thing I want to comment on is that I wish the waiter had taken the time to fill us in a little on portion size and helpfully suggest that we take that into account when ordering.

2009-02-05,5.0,"Update-08/2009 -- Many months later and I finally came here again. It was too long! The food was again excellent. I tried a couple new things and had some old favorites. I can add the red quinoa to my list of recommendations. I was in a party of 7, and we went midweek. We were promptly seated outside. I believe everyone enjoyed their meals. I will not wait 6 months to go back! -- First of all, I am an omnivore, but they still let me into Mana. I was nervous that I would get found out and kicked to the curb, but I needn't have worried. Turns out you don't have to actually be a vegetarian or vegan to eat there. Phew! So I've only eaten there once, but I've been inside twice. Tried going there on a Friday night . . .but were told there was a 2 hour wait! I heard the place was small, but I had no idea how small until I got there. My apartment is bigger! We didn't wait the two hours, but resolved to go back during the week, as it smelled quite good in there. Plus I read all the reviews on here before I went and they had my mouth watering. Anyway, attempted again on Thursday night. Got there at 7 and there was a short wait (15ish minutes). It looks like that was the time to go, because shortly after that the place really filled up! Service was very good. The bartender was very friendly, and the waitress was also friendly and attentive. The food. . . did I mention I was an omnivore? I like meat. The food was excellent. The mushroom saute over creamy polenta was very tasty, as was the goat cheese. I am a lasagna connoisseur; I've had it all over the place. And I think the lasagna there was some of the best I've had. Not THE best, but definitely top 5. Oh, and the sliders. . . I liked the taste, but the texture may be a bit off-putting for some meat-eaters. I'd still order them again though. Most dishes come in small or large sizes. We did our meal tapas style with a bunch of smalls, but for people who just want their own thing, entree-size portions are available. Prices are a little on the high end, but reasonable for the quality of the food, IMHO. I didn't try the dessert, but next time I go I definitely want to sample the cheesecake. One odd thing. . .the place was almost entirely filled with women. In addition to my party of 3 guys, there was the male bartender, one other male patron and around two dozen women. Nothing personal girls. . . but when y'all get into a group and have a drink or two, you CAN get quite loud. Just thought I'd mention that. I don't know if that was a fluke or if there are just a lot more veggie chicks than dudes. Perhaps this is an untapped dating scene! Long story short (too late): Highly recommended, based on my first (successful) visit.

Try two small portions to make the most of the varied, interesting menu.  The DL:  The curry with cauliflower, peas, and sweet potato is more like a Japanese curry than the more familiar Indian or Thai kinds: there's no coconut milk and it seems to be tomato based. It was excellently spiced and well portioned. If you are a fan of turmeric, cumin and coriander, you ought to try it out.  For those who always find themselves ordering American-foodie refashionings of Italian dishes (I know you must be out there---I am one of you), the tomato pumpkin ravioli in sage-cream sauce is delicious! The pickled vegetables are extremely pungent; order only if you've got a penchant for vinegar and don't mind the taste of kimchi a la americain. The rice noodles in coconut milk tasted like a Thai yellow curry; the vegetables were fresh. Use some of the house-made hot sauce--they really know how to spice it right. Oh, and don't miss the baked goat cheese or spinakopita. These people know how to handle cheese.  Lines are long and the space is tiny, so go early.

If you're the kind of person who loves to try a large variety of flavors at a single meal, you'll probably really enjoy Mana Food Bar. I personally was really excited that everything could be bought in a smaller or larger size, as it allowed a lot more sampling than you can normally get without shelling out a ton of money.  My boyfriend (omnivorous) and I agreed that the slider ($3.50), sweet potato pancake, and creamy polenta ($2) were extremely strong dishes. I could live off frozen veggie patties and he's never had a meatless burger in his life -- we were both blown away by the brown rice and mushroom slider. He even said that he'd happily never eat meat again if only he knew how to make burgers like those. When we go back someday, we'll definitely order several rather than splitting just one.

Mana's interior is cozy, and we chose to sit at the bar which is something we find ourselves doing more and more.  Service was only so-so in that one of the dishes we ordered (the sweet potato pancake) was never put in or brought out, and we received all of our food without anyone realizing it hadn't been brought out to us. We started with a sampler of cold items- Pickled Vegetables, Squash Salad, and a Thai Pineapple Salad.  All were good- though my favorites being the wonderful flavors coming from the pickled green tomato, and the over-all flavor and texture of the squash salad- which was much like a pasta salad with a really good pesto sauce. The main courses were good too- the Bulgogi was rich in flavor and the tofu piece was the perfect medium texture.  While the Bib Im Bop was wonderfully flavored with good amounts of spice, I couldn't get over the fact that it wasn't a real Bib Im Bop (since it was served and put together in a bowl- none of the crusty rice bits that I love were a part of the dish).

Our favorite was for sure the pumpkin raviolis which truly were a taste explosion. However, the other dishes were a VERY close second. We also think that the menu was very seasonal, using only ingredients that would be readily freshly available, but will have to wait and see what they do come spring.

The place was pretty empty so there wasn't any trouble getting a seat. Neither one of us are vegetarians but we do love a good vegetarian dish when its well done. The two of us ordered three small dishes and one slider. The small size was surprisingly large. Along with the mushroom slider we ordered the pumpkin ravioli, the yellow curry special and sweet potato pancakes. Everything was delicious. I'm not sure if I can even put into words how tasty the pumpkin ravioli was. To wash all these wonderful dishes down both of us tried one of the smoothies. I had the avocado one and my fiancée had the carrot one. I enjoyed the avocado a lot more but I'm not a huge carrot juice fan. Service was good, nothing speedy I didn't feel like we were rushed out the door and I didn't feel like we were sitting around waiting for anything too long. I can see myself going back again and showing some people how good vegetarian can be.",0.993,0.72,0.219,0.061,0.5421164021164022
2008-11-25,5.0,"I. Can't. Breathe. Help me.  I am. SO.VERY.FULL. Unbelievable, incredible, amazing. I do not have enough words. Thank you Yelp, thank you, thank you, thank you! I would've *never* gone here unless you had told me to do so. I'm vegetarian, you see, and I can't *stand* hippie vegetarian places that place fake meat on the menu, and it was with definite trepidation that I looked at this listing. I thought to myself, ""ew, another vegetarian restaurant"" and gladly dismissed it.  Then I looked at the menu. No seitan crap to be seen. No smoke flavored anything. And definitely no fake daals or curries that are better left to an Indian restaurant.  Could it really be possible? I wondered. Can a vegetarian place *really* do upscale and non-fake meat, at moderate prices, and still be, dare I say it, satisfying? What I am about to tell you, Yelp, is between you, me, and the Interwebs. We were two girls. And we ordered (takes a deep breath): the veggie chili, the baked goat cheese, the lasagna, the sweet potato pancake, the eggplant with miso, and the lemon tart to finish ourselves, I mean the meal, off properly. And between the ecstatic moans, and the loud groans, it's a wonder that we didn't finish off anybody else in the restaurant as well. I could have stayed there forever. If you go, reader, beware. You will find yourself doing insane things.  They can seat only 27 people indoors, yet you will wait until you can get in.  You will search, vainly, on the menu, for the value for money things, yet order the small portions without guilt.  You, who have always tried to order less than your eyes want, will find yourself ordering four or five dishes.  You, who always tried to keep costs down will appreciate the food even though your wallet will be moderately lighter.  You will wish for a gun to your head so that you can tell the murderer that you want Mana's goat cheese and veggie chili to form your last meal. You, who shuns bars as unintimate, will realize that their bar stools swivel, quite attractively, towards your date for the night...and will sit there and order mucho stuff. And most importantly, is that after eating here, you, you meat eating Chicago man, you guzzlers of hot dogs and steaks, you-proudly-Midwestern-meat-munching-maids-and-matrons, yes, yes, you.

2008-08-22,3.0,"Recently Amish S and I have been going to meat heavy restaurants, so I suggested a veg place like Mana.  I did my research on yelp, so I knew what to expect and what were the most popular dishes.   I ordered the nigori sake w/ pear nectar which was made with Snow Beauty nigori sake, agave nectar, and canned Jumex pear nectar.  Nigori is unfiltered so it's a cloudier and creamier.  It was very light and certainly tasty.    However, since Mana is striving to be more natural and organic, I was expecting fresh pear puree.    So you can easily make this by grabbing some nigori from Mitsuwa ($10) and Jumex (80 cents) at any mercado.   They took the pho off the menu because there were too many mixed reviews.  We shared the bulgogi, mushroom and polenta, and 2 sliders.  The tofu bulgogi was way too salty and the sauce tasted like thickened soy sauce.      I think they may be able to take the edge of the saltiness by using Asian pear puree, mirin, and some brown sugar to round off the flavor.  The mushroom and polenta was decent.  But, I have to say the best polenta I have had to date was from Scylla.  It was proscuitto wrapped shrimp accompanied by  polenta cake topped w/ egg yolk (I have a pix posted in my profile).  Last but not least, the sliders... get my 100% approval.  I could eat 10 of those sliders, and it is the greatest reason for me to go back.  [I have also uploaded some pics]         Our tab came out to about  $35 including T&T and was the right amount for lunch portion.  For dinner, you probably need to share two more small plates for fullness.  $35 is slightly high for lunch prices and I can see how people can express concern for price.  But, I guess you have to think of it as, you would spend about the same at a Spanish tapas restaurant.  I actually enjoyed my exp. here much more than Ba-ba-reeba.  Overall, I greet Mana with open arms, and I really like the direction they are going with this concept. The only thing I can think of that may solidify return customers is if they give a psychological bonus like maybe provide free korean style ban chan, which wouldn't cost the restaurant much.  Or maybe have happy hours.  I don't know something that may pushes a little more value for the money.",0.995,0.841,0.147,0.011,0.465995115995116
2008-08-17,3.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by Mana Food Bar.  I'm not a foodie, and I gravitate toward budget restaurants, so I was a little worried that the serving size wouldn't live up to the cost.  It did.  The flavors were worthy and portion sizes reasonable.  I was able to leave full and happy for $25 (including tax and tip).   I appreciated being able to choose from small or large sizes for most dishes.  My favorite dish was the mushroom saute polenta - I would go back for this reason alone.  The bluecheese potato salad was very good, but so rich that it should be eaten with something else.  The chili was only so-so; spicy seemed to be the only flavor it had.  Wash it all down with house-made lemonade, which can be ordered tangy or sweet.  Mine was so tangy that I even added a little water to it, and one $2 glass lasted the course of my meal. I have to commend the accommodating wait staff allowed us to move from   our indoor table to one that opened up outdoors even thought we had already ordered.  The indoor space has a sleek look with white brick walls and unique wood chairs, but it also becomes quite cramped and loud as it fills.",0.9725,0.855,0.126,0.019,0.6198984126984127
2008-08-17,5.0,"WARNING: LOVE THIS PLACE...VERY LONG REVIEW!! I'd been meaning to check out Mana, but the reviews on here had me a bit worried. If you're feeling the same way, I say GO! I went yesterday for lunch with a friend of mine who actually doesn't like many vegetables (both of us are meat eaters). A definite reason to hesitate, but since it was my birthday brunch, she said she'd love to give it a try. SERIOUSLY one of the BEST meals I've had in Chicago. SO creative. Tons of flavor. FRESH, FRESH, FRESH ingredients. Beautiful interior. FAB staff. Ok, now for a confession: we liked it so much, we actually grabbed my husband last night and went back for dinner. Here's the lowdown on the food: For lunch we shared (all small portions): Thai Watermelon: it's a mixture of cubed watermelon, cucumbers, mint and green chilies. SO good. The balance of flavors is perfect. If you don't like it too hot, just don't eat any of the chilies and you'll be fine. Seriously tasty! Buckwheat Soba Noodles: A little more cooked than I had expected for soba noodles and the dish was served warm (again, surprised me), but SO good. Not too peanut-y, which I thought was a good thing. Yummy! Mana Sliders: We each had one. They're a mixture of brown rice and mushrooms with a spicy mayo sauce. OMG, SO good. My friend doesn't even like mushrooms (the waiter assured her it wasn't mushroom-y) and she loved it. A must have when you go! They're small, so you can try other things as well. Baja Corn: One order comes with 2 pieces (a cob cut in half on the bias) each on a stick. Can I just say heaven? The lime chili powder is phenomenal. And, they're fresh grilled. A-MA-ZING! Mana Chili: Very fresh and layered with flavors. The first bite we each took we thought, ""ok, standard chili."" Just wait...the flavors are very layered and develop as you eat it. Outstanding! I recommend mixing it all up before you eat it.  We each also had the fresh squeezed lemonade (which you can order sweet or tart). We each got the tart and it was FAB. And where else can you pay only $2 for fresh squeezed lemonade these days?  Our entire bill came to $33 plus tip. Ok, on to dinner: (yes, I'm blushing...I've never eaten at the same restaurant two times in one day) For dinner we shared: Bi Bim Bop: I love bi bim bop anyway (my favorite is at Joy Yee Noodles) and this was no disappointment. You won't miss the meat AT ALL and the flavors are an explosion in your mouth. The rice is cooked perfectly and the veggies are SO fresh. Oh, I forgot, we each started with a drink at the bar while we waited a few minutes for our table. I got the watermelon (with fresh mint) sake cocktail (wonderful flavor and not too alchohol-y). My friend got a glass of wine and my husband got a beer from Colorado. Everybody was very happy with their selections. Even better - they didn't make us settle our tab and then move...we simply tipped the bartender and then they moved our drinks over to our dinner tab. EASY PEASY! We also shared the soft polenta, which according to my Italian husband was cooked ""properly"". The mushrooms on top were to die for and it was just a heavenly dish all around. What else? Oh, yes, we had the grilled asparagus with truffle oil - perfectly cooked with a perfect crispness to them. My husband (he doesn't like to pick at a bunch of small dishes...he prefers to order his own meal) got the buckwheat soba noodles, but added tofu. Again, he was expecting it cold (as I had), but he really enjoyed the flavor. He also ordered a special dish available last night - a jicama salad. VERY fresh! I must make a special note as to the service. When we went in for lunch, we ran into two guys at the bar. One of them, John, looked familiar and it turns out he picked out my frames at d/vision when he was working there last year. We all started chatting and it turned out that he was a runner at Mana and we were all gushing about how much we loved the food. Fast forward to dinner: we walk in and run into John - he's working. Yes, we were totally embarrassed that we had just been there for brunch, but John loves Mana too, so he completely understood. Then our waiter, Chase, comes over to our table. Gives us a ""do I know you kind of look""...lo and behold he had been there for lunch with John and then left with his girlfriend before we really had a chance to chat with him. Look, if two employees are going there for lunch when they're NOT working - you KNOW it's good. And the service is, not surprisingly, excellent. I (obviously) will be going back. Mana has definitely made it into my ""rotation"" of restaurants. I highly recommend that you give it a shot. Enjoy!",0.9998,0.689,0.261,0.049,0.5329761904761905

I had heard mixed reviews on the service, but it's all about going one hour before they close. I went with my friend who has a gluten allergy, so our options were a little limited.  We started with the collard greens, which were super tasty.  Moved on to the corn, which had a great flavor, although I'm not that much of a corn fan. Also had the grilled mushrooms and polenta, and I had the mushroom slider, which I think was my favorite thing.  Wait, I take that back, my favorite thing was the Watermelon Sake drink.  Delicious!!!

I live 2 blocks from Mana Food Bar.  It's a vegetarian restaurant and I'm a vegetarian.  However, after having dinner here with my also-vegetarian boyfriend (well, he eats seafood, but let's not quibble), I won't be back.   The service was great and we got a prime outside spot with no problem for an early dinner.  Our server was very nice and helpful.  But the food just didn't do it for me.  We got a three-salad sampler to start - we chose the pickled veggies, watermelon salad and the raw ""pasta"".  Pickled veggies were pretty bad, but the watermelon salad and raw ""pasta"" were okay.  Then we got a few sliders and some roasted corn to share.  The sliders in my opinion were pretty flavorless and really mushy.  The corn had a hint of lime and spice - nothing special.  I had the bi bim bop for an entree - the sauce had decent flavor but there was more sauce than actual vegetables and rice and not many vegetables at all really other than some okra (okra being kind of a weird choice and which also was featured heavily in the pickled vegetables mentioned above), so overall, not very good.  The boyfriend had the polenta with mushrooms which he actually thought was pretty good.  We got all small/appetizer portions and each had 1 drink.   After all was said and done, I was pretty unsatisfied with my meal, was still kind of hungry, and we walked away about $75 poorer.  So, despite our friendly Christian Siriano look-alike waiter, we won't be back.",0.6727,0.756,0.126,0.118,0.49306992027580254
2008-08-07,2.0,"I've been to Mana twice; the first was exceedingly excellent. We ate a few selections for light meal and all was excellent.  Second time was far more polarized--some of the dishes were excellent, others were embarrassingly and shockingly improper. A few good things to start: Vegetarian restaurant--yay! nice décor (could use some art). Warm, approachable staff.  I do try to 'stay positive,' but this is a case of the bad food wholly eclipsing the good food and everything else. To get straight to the point, the ""maki"" was so so so wrong.  Firstly, ""maki"" is a pretty particular word.  It means something  (veg, fish, etc) encased in rice and wrapped in sheets of nori.  Our maki was ""raw vegan"" style (not mentioned on the menu), which is collard greens wrapped around an absolute hodgepodge of vegetables, including asparagus--August asparagus.  Sometimes I would be happy to order such a dish, but to serve raw vegan maki instead of maki, without menu clarification is incomprehensible.  It's like having ""hamburger"" on the menu, but then serving fried chicken.  Just because you say  ""it's a hamburger,"" does not make it a hamburger.  This was not maki. this was a salad roll. Culinary disaster #2 was advertised as raw--the 'raw pasta.'  Usually such a dish contains long juliennes of summer squash and zucchini, so as to approximate the shape of speghetti, and is well flavored, as these vegetables aren't exactly flavor bombs.  Ours was a fairly erratic assemblage of chopped (not juliened) zucchini, tomatoes and not enough pesto.  It had the appearance and taste of aimless, clueless preparation. One final and noteworthy gastro-crash was the be bim bop.  Like many dishes on the menu, it is purported to contain ""vegetables,"" a menu description that I have come to loathe, as everything I eat is ""vegetables."" You might expect a few things here--carrots, red pepper, broccoli.  What we got was almost all OKRA.   Okra, if you are from Mars, is loved by 3 people and loathed by the rest of the world.  You don't just put it in things.  You say ""warning: this dish contains okra.""  This okra featured the most loathed aspects of okra--sliminess and fibrousness. Also, okra is a fruit.  The whole dish was covered in a thick, sweet sauce, much unlike any of the 1000 bi bim bops I have eaten. conspicuously absent from the dish is kimchi, a hallmark of bi bim bop. and shouldn't there be some raw veggies?  shredded cucumber or carrot matchsticks? All around, the menu is a little funny--given the selections, I'd like to see some things cleared up--label vegan and raw dishes, maybe.  A bunch of misspellings (arrugula).  Wine and beer on back.  4 absolutely random beers.  So completely random and mismatched to the concept.  A bunch of wine--didn't try.  Some ""sake cocktails"" which we tried, and were so-so on.  Use of vegetables, as noted above, is haphazard, not thought out. Not every vegetable is appropriate to every dish. Vegetables, oddly, are used with out vision or cohesion at a vegetarian restaurant. Also, if you have anything like a serious appetite, expect to shill out $30 or more for food alone.  Is there hope here? absolutely. I will be back, but will give them some time to play out the food a little.  I'd love to see this place succeed, but they have to do a bit better across the board--and having had some delicious and well prepared items, I know they can.",0.9924,0.799,0.138,0.063,0.5462731279137528

2008-08-02,4.0,"Perhaps the best restaurant meal I have eaten in the city. Inventive, delicious, interesting flavor combinations, and - significant for a vegetarian restaurant - Mana does not attempt to lure meat-eaters in the doors by featuring the novelty of fake meat.  This latter strategy, practiced by many (most?) vegetarian restaurants seems senseless to encourage  converts or continued patronage, because while soy-derived products flavored with smoke and other such things may taste fine to vegetarians,  they will not take like meat to carnivores. And it is for this reason that I particularly appreciate Mana, because I believe I could take other vegetarians and the meat-eating stragglers in the bunch to Mana without feeling that anyone had to compromise. As other reviewers have said, the pickled vegetables are incredible, with hints of curry and cinnamon and overtones of deliciousness. The summer salad was enjoyable, I likely would not select that again. However, I must say - the Thai watermelon that our server specifically warned us was extremely spicy - had not a scintilla of spice. I told our server that, while tasty and refreshing, I thought we received a defective batch.  The chili was tremendous. Vegetarian chili is very easy to make and very difficult to make special, and this was something that I will continue to order from Mana. Sliders were good, but I ordered mine without the mayonnaise which rendered it a bit dry - still satisfying. Finally, the cocktails were outstanding. Take advantage of the outdoor seating in the summer, as the inside is ""quaint"" with ""mood lighting"" (tiny and dark, but still a nice decor).

2008-08-01,4.0,"I just went here for dinner.  The entire menu is vegetarian (though not quite vegan - a lot of stuff seemed to have cheese/butter/etc in it), and I'd say most of the concepts are pretty well executed.  I'd suggest going here with a few friends so you can order more things and share them tapas-style.  Since I tried so many different and interesting things, here is the breakdown of what I had: watermelon salad: the Thai-style spices made for a really great flavor, but the intensity paled in comparison with everything else.  Also, the salad was mostly cucumbers...and given that it's called a watermelon salad, I would have expected more watermelon.   raw pasta: I wouldnt recommend this...its basically squash and tomatoes marinated in pesto sauce...it's good, but there are so many other things that are more worth trying. slider: delicious and served with Asian-style pickled cucumbers...surprisingly nice texture and flavor for something that is essentially brown rice on a bun.   pho: good god, what an awesome play on traditional Vietnamese fare.  The broth (traditionally beef-based, but I don't know what they used in this case) was full of spices (anise, clove, maybe even cinnamon), and the noodles had soaked up all of the flavor.  Apart from the standard basil, lime and bean sprouts that usually go in pho, they had also spruced it up with mint leaves, arugula and snow peas.    maki rolls: I was surprised to discover that the maki rolls were not wrapped in seaweed, but in some sort of leaf.  The server said the were collard greens.  Usually when I think collard greens, I picture a slimey green mush that's stewed with bacon.  I'd never seen collard greens in a raw form before, but they looked fresh and delicious.  I can't remember the exact ingredients wrapped inside, but I was impressed to see enokitake mushrooms in the mix.   grilled corn: slightly charred on the edges, buttered, and sprinkled with what seemed like soul food seasoning - chilli powder/pepper/paprika-ish mixtures.  Very crisp and fresh corn and extremely tasty. bulgogi: the most impressive thing we tried.  In coming to a place that emphasizes fresh natural ingredients, I was hoping to avoid any fake meats, but the bulgogi is actually just a rectangle of tofu - nothing that tries too hard, no texturizing processes or anything.  But boy did they make that rectangle of tofu taste good.  The flavors for the bulgogi were probabaly the most intense of everything that we tried, and it blew my mind.  I think normal bulgogi only really has garlic, scallions, sugar and soy sauce as its primary ingredients, but there had to have been much more than that to this tofu.   avocado, pineapple, and coconut water smoothie - it seemed a bit warm and the pinepple was a bit overpowering...but I did like the concept of using avocado as a creamy texturizer.  I was debating between one of the smoothies or the coconut-lime sake cocktail and will likely opt for the cocktail next time.   All in all, a really great dining experience....although you might wind up hungry again an hour later when dining on mostly low-carb veggie-heavy dishes that come in relatively small portions.  But...I will definitely be back.",0.9979,0.807,0.169,0.024,0.5425480769230769

2008-07-24,3.0,"Duplicate posting.... I was here for one of the maiden voyages.  I'm always happy to find new veggie places, especially closer to the fine dining end.  Metromix had stated that Mana would be more Green Zebra, and less Veggie Bite, which already won me over.  Further more, I was intrigued by the notion of dishes being available as large or small plate, especially for my first meal there. The decor is lovely and very ""green-"" heavy on the reuse/ recycle feel.  The people were SO nice!  Because of the size of the joint (max 34 diners,) your server is never more than a couple feet away.  The menu offered dishes from Greece (ye ol' Spanikopita of veg and catering ubiquity,) Korea (Bim Bop,) Italian pastas, a Thai salad, and of course, Hummus and Tabouli, without which no vegetarian place is truly complete... The meal had high points and low points.  I will provide constructive criticism, rather than lashing out, so the owners can try to improve a couple things. The first beef I had was with the pricing of some dishes.  I know real estate is damn expensive in Wicker these days, but an 8 dollar smoothy had better come with some booze in it.  Ours, the Avocado Pineapple Coconut Water, was good, but had uneatable chunks in it, and was about half the size I expected for the money. Secondly, the beer list was seriously lacking.  No west coast beers and no Ipa?  Come on.  Vegetarians love beer!  And variety. Now to the food.  The watermelon salad was painfully hot.  We got a salad sampler, and though good, the only thing that stood out to me was the unbalanced heat of the melon.  I'm sure this will get ironed out. The Ravioli was excellently cooked- al dente, lovely filling, but not seasoned as I would have expected, especially given the ""spicy"" tomato sauce advertised in the menu.  I have to wonder if the chef actually tasted this sauce or the melon salad. Now the deal breaker.  The shared plate size tofu Bulgogi was SUPERB!  What an excellent dish.  As good as the dish was, my heart sank when it came to the table.  The serving size was tiny, even by Green Zebra standards.  As a fine dining enthusiast, I don't mind paying 6 bucks for a tiny plate, but not that tiny... I honestly left hungry. I felt overall that for the pricepoint and goals of the place, the small plates could have benefited from bolder seasoning (besides the watermelon,) and better presentation.  Also, paying dinner prices for lunch?  Even Zebra cuts their prices for the Sunday brunch, which I pray Mana adds as well... at a lower cost to the diner. Mana could make some minor adjustments and have a serious winner here.  Wicker Park needs a step up from Earwax and Handlebar, but honestly, with the exception of the Bulgogi, there was nothing that made me want to come back and spend 40 bucks for lunch again, especially given the serving size of that one stand out dish.   Who am I kidding?  With the limited number of options available for vegetarians, of course I'll come back... a more cohesive product and value for the buck dining experience will get Mana at least one more star, and alot of my money in the coming year.",0.9967,0.795,0.156,0.05,0.5057302461847917

Veggie burgers can be kind of sketchy, but this was amazing.  The consistency was perfect and full of flavor.  I can't wait to actually go eat there because the drink menu had some creative cocktails on it!  Interesting food that is light and healthy as well as tasty!",0.9827,0.666,0.334,0.0,0.6990909090909091
