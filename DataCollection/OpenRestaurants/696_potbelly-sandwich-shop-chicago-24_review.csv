2017-04-24,1.0,"I actually already contacted the Potbelly corporate offices about this I was so blown away by the awfulness of the sandwiches I just got from this Potbelly location. This afternoon, my boyfriend and I visited this Potbelly location for the first time and everything was fine until we began eating our sandwiches. I got a Turkey, he got a Big Italian with avocado on white with Provolone cheese, which he specifically asked for.   When I first bit into my sandwich I noticed a very very odd flavor from my sandwich, and after a couple of other bites, I realized it was from the pickles. The DID NOT taste like normal Potbelly pickles and almost tasted like they were soapy or they had gone bad. I had to take them off the sandwich in order to even continue eating the sandwich (which is really sad because they are my favorite part of the sandwich typically).   The sandwich was just so poorly made overall, there was literally no turkey or mustard on 1 side, just bread, onions, and lettuce. The other half of the sandwich was PACKED with turkey and was dripping mustard. It was just disappointing to have the sandwich be so inconsistent.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend's sandwich also was very poorly made. The avocado he received was practically rotten and should definitely not have been served to a customer. Secondly, the person making the sandwich put provolone cheese on one-half of the sandwich and SWISS cheese on the other half, without telling him or asking him if that was okay. Which was really unfortunate since he really does not swiss cheese and did not even order it. I really just couldn't believe the person making the sandwich thought that a customer wouldn't even notice that!",-0.9067,0.87,0.048,0.082,0.4148888888888888

Raspberry Lemonade - was looking for something refreshing on the warm and humid day, but this was more like an overly sweetened Icee.  Very thick and hard to drink.  Once it melted, it was super sweet and I had to get several cups of ice water that did much better on the thirst quenching front.

The first one I went to was on Taylor Street in Little Italy, but I come to this one a lot more often.  Potbelly's is the closest thing in Chicago to Santa Cruz's Joe's Pizzas and Subs. Joe's Pizzas and Subs was my favorite sandwich place back in Santa Cruz where I went to college -- I'd always order either the turkey sub or the pastrami sub. Here at Potbelly's, I'd either get the turkey or the wreck sandwich with ""everything on it, easy on the peppers.""

The staff are always friendly, and you gotta admit, Potbelly's is a lot better than Subway or Quizno's -- those places can feel so cold sometimes.  Sometimes, they have their bad days... I hate it when the water taste like toilet water (or what I'd imagine toilet water to taste like because I've never actually had water from the toilet). Other times, their pickles taste a little funny to me as though it's been marinated for too long. But on most days, I feel like I'm in love. The toasted sandwiches brings me back to Santa Cruz and I fall in love all over again. And their vegetable garden soup is delicious and always steaming hot.  I do not recommend their salads though. Maybe it's just not my thing. Or maybe it's because their chicken salad salad isn't actually chicken... It tasted like tuna to me. o_O Or maybe it's because I don't like their croutons; they taste too much like slightly toasted bread rather than fully toasted and crispy bread as I imagine croutons should taste like.

2009-03-01,4.0,I like the fact that I can shop and grab a bite of food here at the shopping center.  I heart the chicken salad sandwich and their potato salad.  It's good and it give me enough energy to keep shopping!,0.7777,0.809,0.191,0.0,0.5375000000000001
2009-01-14,5.0,"This Potbelly's has NEVER let me down.  As bad as I can feel ordering food when it's below 0 outside, the delivery peeps are super cool and friendly.  I order for delivery a lot from here.  Not once have I had a wrong order or a cold sandwich.  They really do have their shit together and I love that in a sammich shop!  The Wreck is my favorite and I cannot pass up their AppleBanana smoothies... even if it is going to be -30 degrees today!  I recommend this one (Sidenote: I've only been inside for p/u, I cannot vouch for cleanliness.)",0.7639,0.709,0.175,0.116,0.6401709401709401
2008-03-08,1.0,"I hate chains - this is one of those experiences that reminds me why I try to avoid them. the place was empty with the exception of a couple people eating at tables, including another employee who was just hanging out, sitting at one of the tables. I walk up and make my selection and, when asked if they could help me I tell the young lady (no name tag)  what I want - she says you have to order down here....and leads me to the other end of the counter where - I must have had an etcha-sketch conversation earlier....yes.  she made me say what I wanted, again, from the top.    WHAT?! I go back to the register to pay...yup - she's the same person who rings me up.  I'm thinking ""what about my sandwich, where is it?""   The sandwich was good, I liked that it was heated.  However, service was poor.  Apparently, in this store, the only way you get friendly conversation / interaction, is to be one of the employees that work at that Potbelly's.  That's the only time they brightened up and showed any life / animation at all -  The table tops were dirty. One of the customers who came in after me had to ask to have his table cleaned. Yeah, I really liked the sandwich, but that's not enough to bring me back to poor service.  Boo PotBellys...BOO!",0.3599,0.861,0.081,0.058,0.5319444444444444

2008-01-15,4.0,"Yeah I'm giving Potbelly's 4 stars...what of it? I love Potbelly's...take it or leave it. This one is located in the Bloomies building. Is that place a ghost town or what by the way? The building is almost scary to walk through and the people that are walking around in there are mostly employees. Sheesh.  Oh..I was reviewing Potbelly's that's right. So I had the ham and swiss with everything except oil and with light mayo. Mmm, mmm was that ever good. I mean what's not to like? It's a toasted sandwich for gods sake. They also sell my baked Lays. Yum. They're not only tasty but they're also waistline friendly. The sandwiches are pretty big so I only ate half of mine...but that just meant a little tasty treat for the hubby when I got home. ;) I love you Potbelly's...you're okay in my book.",0.9785,0.768,0.193,0.039,0.6464635854341736
2007-08-08,3.0,We meandered here one lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon for a beverage and found the place deserted. They have a mean banana smoothie though! I am not a huge fan of this shopping complex as the vibes are just all over the place with lego structures/sculptures (at least they had these still when I was there last) and then fantabulously expensive boutiques (and Nordstroms!) right next door.,-0.7191,0.894,0.0,0.106,0.5210978835978836
2007-07-06,5.0,"I used to work here and I'll still eat the food every day. So good. The most filling sandwich in my opinion is the Meatball. It blows Subway's out of the water...and the meatballs are all beef. Everything is sliced and prepared fresh in the mornings (cookies included) and though you'll pay a bit more than you would at Subway, you'll walk away totally stuffed. And for the love of god, people, it's A WRECK! I can't tell you how many people call it by other names (Trainwreck, The works, etc).",0.8382,0.808,0.141,0.051,0.540625
2005-12-05,4.0,I love love love the cookies here..especially the oatmeal chocolate chip! My favorite sandwich is the works sans salami! Yummy! This location in the mall seems to be busy no matter what time of day it is.  My only complaint is that they don't offer (or didn't when I was there) jalapeno chips!,0.9576,0.626,0.31,0.064,0.6142857142857142
